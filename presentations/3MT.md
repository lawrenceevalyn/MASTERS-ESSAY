Like most English majors, I went to graduate school because I wanted to read *everything*, but I've had to change my definition of what it means to read something. I study the very first Gothic novels, which are essentially supernatural romance novels from the eighteenth century, and if there's one thing that hasn't changed about supernatural romance in the last 200 years, it's that it comes in *bulk*. Most scholars study a manageable number of books, by key authors like Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis, and they do great work teasing apart how those authors write differently from each other. Sometimes, however, they take those observations about Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis and try to define the genre as a whole, saying, "this is the Female Gothic, so that must be the Male Gothic" -- and that's where my research steps in to say, "are you *sure*?"

So, to get a look at a much wider range of books, I tracked down bibliographies that tell me not just when and where a book was published, but what happens in it. From these resources, I've created a spreadsheet that includes sub-genres and plot summaries of/for roughly 600 Gothic novels, but my most exciting results so far come from the 208 books for which I have a list of motifs. I looked at 70 motifs that appeared in at least 20 novels, things like 'shipwreck' and 'apparent peasant of noble demeanor', and I tried to see which motifs, if any, can/could be used to tell the difference between books by women and books by men.

By now you've probably noticed that one of my pie charts here is just a green circle. The difference between the two colors in each pie chart directly reflects the difference between the percentages, and in the case of dueling, there is no difference. If you know that a book has a duel in it, you still don't know anything about whether its author is more likely to be a man or a woman. In fact, more than half of my pie charts turned out to be vaguely greenish circles. Only two motifs were really strongly female-dominated, libertines and miniature portraits. That makes it even more interesting that there were almost thirty motifs that were male-dominated, not all of which are the kinds of things a scholar of the Gothic would expect. Lots of dungeons, lots of demons, but also lots of caves and lots of letters being written.

A lot has been said about the Female Gothic, but my research suggests that if we look beyond the most famous authors, most women's books fell into a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. Instead, if we wish to study a sub-group of authors whose writing is shaped by their gender, I argue, we need to turn our attention to the Male Gothic.

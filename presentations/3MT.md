Like most English majors, I went to graduate school because I wanted to read *everything*. I started studying the very first Gothic novels, which are essentially supernatural romance novels from the eighteenth century, and if there's one thing that hasn't changed about supernatural romance novels since then, it's that there's a *lot* of them. Most scholars look at a manageable number of the really big-name novels, by authors like Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis, and they do incredible work teasing out the details of how those two authors write differently from each other. But then sometimes they take those observations about Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis and they say, "this defines the Female Gothic, and that defines the Male Gothic" -- and that's where my research steps in to say, "are you *sure*?"

Unfortunately, one thing that has changed about supernatural romance novels in the last 200 years is how hard they are to get. So what I've done is tracked down a bunch of bibliographies that have information about these books, and created a gigantic spreadsheet to start making connections between the different little bits of information that each bibliography has. My spreadsheet has a little over 600 titles in it, but the really exciting results so far come from the information about motifs that I have for 208 of these titles.

- orphan: 26 women / 18 men (44 total)
- dungeon: 19 women / 39 men (58 total)

- but people who read romance novels don't read ten or twelve books over the course of 40 years, and we have a lot of evidence suggesting that the people who read these Gothic novels did so by checking them out from libraries, which were just becoming popularized then, so people would return the last volume of something that gets studied a lot, like Frankenstein, and they'd check out something that has been completely forgotten for two hundred years, like "" and "There Is A Secret, Find It Out" (those are real book titles, by the way).

- If it's not possible for an experiment to say you're wrong, it's not a very good experiment.

Like most English majors, I went to graduate school because I wanted to read *everything*, but that's not always practical. I study very early Gothic novels, which are essentially supernatural romance novels from the eighteenth century, but if there's one thing that hasn't changed about supernatural romance since then, it's that it comes in *bulk*. Most scholars study a manageable number of important novels, by authors like Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis, and they do great work teasing apart how those authors write differently from each other. Sometimes, however, they take those observations about Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis and try to define the genre as a whole, saying, "this defines the Female Gothic, and that defines the rest of the Gothic" -- and that's where my research steps in to say, "are you *sure*?"

So, to get a look at a much wider range of books, I have tracked down bibliographies with information about roughly 600 Gothic novels, and created a spreadsheet to start making connections. The most exciting results so far come from the information about motifs that I have for 208 of these books. I looked at 70 motifs that appeared in at least 20 novels, things like 'shipwreck' and 'apparent peasant of noble demeanor', and tried to see which motifs, if any, could be used to tell the difference between books by women and books by men.

By now you've probably noticed that one of my pie charts here is just a green circle. The difference between the two colors in each pie chart directly reflects the difference between the percentages, and in the case of dueling, there is no difference. If you know that a book has dueling in it, you still don't know anything about whether its author is more likely to be a man or a woman. In fact, 40 of my 70 charts turned out to be vaguely greenish circles. Only two motifs were really strongly female-dominated, libertines and miniature portraits. That makes it even more interesting that there were so many male-dominated motifs, not all of which are the kinds of things a scholar of the Gothic would expect. Lots of dungeons, lots of demons, but also lots of letters being written, and lots of caves.

The disparity between the large number of male motifs, and the almost complete absence of female motifs, suggests that the current discussion of gender in the Gothic is reversed. There's been a lot written about what defines the Female Gothic, but my results suggest that if we look beyond the most famous authors, women's books primarily fell into a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. Instead, if we wish to study a sub-group of authors whose writing is shaped by their gender, I argue, we need to pay attention to the Male Gothic.





<!--The details of all of these different motifs can change which books we read and how we read them. People at the time thought that Ann Radcliffe wrote better books than the person who wrote "There Is A Secret, Find It Out" -- but they didn't think of her novels as a fundamentally different *kind* of book, the way we think Twilight is just not comparable to Pride and Prejudice. My research provides a way to take the big famous books, and instead of comparing them just to different kinds of big famous books, to put them back in the context in which they were read.


- dueling: 28 women / 26 men (54 total)
- orphan: 26 women / 18 men (44 total)
- dungeon: 19 women / 39 men (58 total)

- but people who read romance novels don't read ten or twelve books over the course of 40 years, and we have a lot of evidence suggesting that the people who read these Gothic novels did so by checking them out from libraries, which were just becoming popularized then, so people would return the last volume of something that gets studied a lot, like Frankenstein, and they'd check out something that has been completely forgotten for two hundred years, like "" and "There Is A Secret, Find It Out" (those are real book titles, by the way).

- but they didn't have the idea of a division between "high culture" and "low culture" that we do today. All novels were supposed to be "high culture".

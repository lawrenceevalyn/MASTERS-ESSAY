On the program it says I'm here to talk to you about "Distant-Reading Gendered Gothic Motifs", but that's unforgivably vague without even being catchy. A more accurate title would be "Reading Metadata: Visualizing Gender Divides in the Gothic Novel 1790-1830." A catchier title would be "Reading Hundreds Of Books When You Don't Have Any Books: Some Pie Charts."

I want to start with some background on my research questions and loop back to some results at the end, but spend the bulk of my time exploring the visualization of metadata as a research practice.

So, a little bit of set-up on how the Gothic was read. At the birth of the Gothic novel in the 1790s, the genre's position in the literary landscape was startlingly similar to that of modern-day romance novels, in both popularity and reputation. Jane Austen's delightful Gothic parody Northanger Abbey actually has a great depiction of the Gothic reading experience.

[Primary evaluation: are they all horrid?]

Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho and The Italian have been receiving critical acclaim since the day they were published, but the rest of these books were deemed so unimportant that for a long time twentieth-century scholars assumed that they had never even existed. But all the evidence I've seen suggests that readers didn't see Radcliffe's books as being exclusively in conversation with non-Gothic literature, or with one or two other rarified Gothic masterpieces, the way critics often examine them; readers may have thought Radcliffe was a better writer than Eliza Parsons, who wrote The Mysterious Warning and The Castle of Wolfenbach -- but the difference in skill didn't change the fact that they were "of the some kind."

So my research tries to put these key texts back into context with their genre as a whole, using the power of spreadsheets. The most obvious answer would be to get a couple hundred novels, scan them, and start examining what they say -- unfortunately, my MA program is not that long. So I turned to bibliographies, and especially to one bibliography by Ann Tracy, The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs.

This is the Index to Motifs. [Tracy's use of 'motif'].

From here, I knew I needed to keep digesting all this data further, and it occurred to me that I had a prime opportunity to sort of check up on some of the critical conversation that happens around the Male Gothic versus the Female Gothic.

not "discrete bounded entities" but "conditional expressions of interpretative parameters"


texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (John Frow, *Genre*, 2). 


The first thing I noticed was that I'd color coded girls and boys with pink and blue, even though that's both historically inaccurate and ridiculous.

The second thing I noticed was that both circles were the same size, which makes them look equally important. I decided to make the box itself a fixed size, to indicate the possibility space of all 208 novels under consideration, and then to scale the charts themselves based on 

Then I started thinking about the fact that, if the motif is 50/50, there isn't actually a difference between books by men and books by women. The two colours make it look like there are two groups, which happen to be equally balanced, my question *is* whether there are two groups. [So I did the colours].

So, this, I think, is the ultimate proof that my visualization has taken the numbers in Tracy's index and transformed them into something that can form the valid basis of further reading: a lot of stuff that looked really promising now looks really boring.

These are all preliminary results, but the experimental process of prototyping and iterating was [good, and you should do it]. Thanks!



<!-- So, the first thing to talk about is why I am reading hundreds of books in the first place.

According to the information gathered by Peter Raven and James Garside, the number of new novels published in Britain each year rose from roughly twenty a year in the 1770s to roughly ninety a year in the 1790s

In response to this new torrent of novels, then, readers' expectations changed. -->

# TO DO

## Program correctOCR.py
- Make file name changes be based on variables
- Scale program to multiple files.
- Consider removing:
    * punctuation marks?
    * single letters?
    * "chapter" and "vol"/"volume"?
    * the word "page" (due to Zofloya)?
- at what stage will I want to remove stopwords?
- **would it help to remove everything that's not in a dictionary?** --> except for words that are capitalized? (to preserve names) - it would be just like reading a moldy manuscript that's missing key details and cuts off right at a cliffhanger...

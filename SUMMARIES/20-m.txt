FATAL SECRETS, OR, ETHERLINDA DE SALMONI. A SICILIAN STORY

Count Ormando Beraldi takes in his dissipated cousin Ricardo, whose own father has cast him off, and rashly leaves him alone with his wife Theodora. Theodora even more rashly squeezes Ricardo's hand in gratitude for some kindness, which lights "a flame of libidinous desire" in his heart. Ricardo's libidinous impulse comes to nothing at the time, but during a later absence of the Count's he replaces all the servants with his own followers, locks up and threatens Theodora, and subsequently kidnaps and imprisons the Count himself. Theodora dies. Ricardo, now lord of the castle, brings home and raises Etherlinda, his illegitimate child by Alicia, the daughter of his neighbor Salmoni. The Count's child Ormando Jr. is raised as an orphaned dependent while Etherlinda is to inherit the estate. Alicia, after she was earlier abandoned by Ricardo, went to the Count for charity and so attracted him that he entered into an affair with her and set her up in another castle; when Ricardo learns of this he adds her to his prisoners. Young Ormando and Etherlinda fall in love. Ricardo offers his consent to their marriage on condition that Ormando murder Alicia, but Ormando refuses. At the end, Ricardo, who never in the course of their relationship learned Alicia's last name, discovers that she is his own sister, whereupon he kills himself. This genealogical information is kept from Etherlinda, who is permitted to marry Ormando. Alicia enters a convent.

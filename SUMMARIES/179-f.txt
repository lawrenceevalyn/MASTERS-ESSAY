THE CORSAIR'S BRIDE. A LEGEND OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY

The Della Monti family go to Sicily, where mother and baby die, leaving Rosalita alone with her father. She and Arthur de la Pole are in love, but Arthur has to go back to England, where he has political connections; he is Clarence Plantagenet's grandson. When he gets home, everyone is gone. They have been arrested, and he sees one of his brothers beheaded. Meanwhile a shipwrecked stranger has been talking passionate love to Rosalita and saying that she cannot escape him. And indeed she cannot, for pirates later carry her off to Hayradin Barbarossa, who turns out to be the importunate stranger. He is now gentle but firm in his insistence and marries her in a Christian ceremony, so she is obliged to recognize the validity of the union. Rosalita's father and Arthur weep over her supposed dishonor. However, she escapes, disguised, with the help of one of Barbarossa's other wives, and there is a joyful scene of reunion. They wash the dye from her face and persuade the Pope to annul her marriage. The novel ends happily except for the political executions of some secondary characters in England.

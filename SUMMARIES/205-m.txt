THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. A NOVEL

Sigismund Archdale, though illegitimate, was raised by the Earl, his father. His legitimate and unprincipled half-brother Lord Portcennis has inherited. Late in the novel Archdale, having been wounded, is nursed by Mrs. Mordent, an attractive widow whom he once met at a masquerade, and a clergyman named Hervey, who is able to inform Archdale that his father and mother really were married and that his half-brother is the illegitimate one. Archdale becomes Earl and marries Mrs. Mordent. His half-brother, now disinherited, leads an unhappy life with his shrewish wife and mother-in-law, who resent his poverty. Between Archdale's initial entrance and the establishment of his legitimacy the author employs a number of colorful devices which have little apparent bearing on the main plot: suspicions of parricide, duels, dead servants, exploration of ruined abbeys, and a madman who moans about his suicide son.

THE ROMANCE OF THE APPENINES

A young outcast arrives in Naples and is mistakenly identified as a bravo. He is taken to Roberto, who is shocked to see in the boy's face a resemblance to his murdered brother Henrico. The boy is no boy at all, but Roberto's niece Viola in masculine clothing. Roberto had supposed her to be dead, having arranged for her murder himself when he had her father killed. (Roberto was jealous of both Henrico's inheritance and his wife.) During the little time Viola spends in her uncle's house - he soon sends her into the keeping of some banditti - his guest Lorenzo, Duke d'Urbino, falls in love with her. The bandits are not a bad lot. Both Rinaldo, the leader, and Beatrice, a female member of the troop, are kind to Viola, and the melancholy bandit Vincentia is particularly interesting. Actually Vincentia is not a proper bandit; he was released from the bandits' dungeons and has saved Rinaldo's life. Viola soon discovers that he is her father Henrico, who did not after all die under Roberto's attack. Lorenzo, accompanied by Viola's servant Rondello, comes to release her, though she dislikes escaping without her father, and takes her to his own parents. Then Lorenzo disappears and Rondello, through Roberto's machinations, is accused of his murder and brought to the Inquisition, where he in turn accuses Roberto. The matter is resolved by the sudden arrival of Lorenzo. Roberto bursts a blood vessel and dies, Vincentio/Henrico is re- leased, and Lorenzo marries Viola.

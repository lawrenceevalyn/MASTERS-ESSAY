ZITTAW THE CRUEL, OR, THE WOODMAN'S DAUGHTER. A POLISH ROMANCE

The woodman's daughter Ingonda is engaged to marry Count Timoska but is kidnapped before the wedding by wicked Prince Zittaw. He also drugs and imprisons her father and the Count. All three victims hold fast to virtue. Zittaw rapes and kills the wife of Ingonda's servant; the servant frees the Count in retribution. When Zittaw tries to kill the servant, he finds the ghost of his rape victim. Ingonda stabs him as he is in the process of murdering her father. The Count rescues them. A dying officer (there is a battle outside) directs them to Zittaw's imprisoned wife, who also dies. Ingonda and the Count are married.

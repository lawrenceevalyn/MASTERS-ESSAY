THE MARCHIONESS!!! OR, "THE MATURED ENCHANTRESS"

Lionel Southampton means well and is an affectionate husband and father, but when he goes off to Parliament his wife worries more about his morals than about those of her son at Eton. She needs to worry about her husband for he falls into the clutches of a fascinating woman, the Marchioness, who teaches him to gamble. His wife stops writing, his son frets himself into the grave, and his daughter declines. The Marchioness tells him that it is all his own fault: how could he have supposed that anyone who loved him would start him gaming? He finally dies. The Marchioness neither reforms nor dies in agony; at the novel's end she is as unabashedly worldly and loose-living as ever.

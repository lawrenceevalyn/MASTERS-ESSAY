THE WATER SPECTRE, OR, AN BRATACH

Murchardus is godfather to Donald, infant son of his friend Roderic, Thane of Dungivan. Wishing to inherit Roderic's title and estate, he arranges for Donald's kidnapping and drowning. Allan, to whom these tasks are assigned, discovers between the kidnapping and the murder that his own baby has just died; his wife Jannette persuades him to keep Donald and throw the body of their dead child into the river in Donald's place. Murchardus plans to murder Roderic next. Some years pass while the Thane goes off to the crusades, but the murder takes place immediately upon his return.
The Weird Sisters, who feel a protective interest in Donald, tell him of Murchardus's usurpation and give him a magic white flag which will help him in one moment of danger and one only. The Sisters also inform Murchardus, in response to questions he asks, that he will be harmed by no human power, that he will die at the third appearance of Roderic's specter, and that the next owner of Dungivan will be the rightful heir with his bride Lady Catherine. Their prophecy is doubly displeasing to Murchardus, for he is himself courting Lady Catherine and he has already seen Roderic's specter once. It appears for a second time at the close of his interview with the Weird Sisters. Donald and Lady Catherine do fall in love, despite apparent differences in class, and are persecuted and more than once captured by Murchardus. Donald has been taken out in a boat and is about to be strangled when he remembers to wave the white flag; his father's specter appears, and a second boat, from which Murchardus is watching, sinks straightaway with its villainous occupant. Donald's title is restored and he marries Lady Catherine.

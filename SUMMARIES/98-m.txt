THE ISLE OF DEVILS. AN HISTORICAL TALE, FOUNDED ON AN ANECDOTE IN THE ANNALS OF PORTUGAL

Irza is shipwrecked and washes ashore on the Isle of Devils. She earlier admired it from a distance but was told that the place was evil, a spot where the damned congregate. Upon her arrival she is attacked and bitten by horrible dwarves but is rescued by the Demon King. Smitten by her beauty, he kneels to her and leads her to his cave. Although he is huge, black, hairy, and terrifying, he behaves like a gentleman and Izra is able to tolerate him. At some point the chastity of their relationship breaks down and Izra produces an infant, the image of his father, about whom she has very ambivalent feelings. After a period of insanity, the result of seeing her demon lover beat out the brains of her human lover who has tried to rescue her, she has a second child who looks altogether normal and upon whom she dotes. When more rescuers arrive and force her to go with them - she objects to leaving her younger child, whom its father has kept with him as a sort of hostage - the Demon King retaliates by flinging the human child into the ocean. Then, wild with grief, he flings himself and the demon child into the ocean as well. The tale is in verse.

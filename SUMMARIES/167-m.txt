ZASTROZZI. A ROMANCE

The villain Zastrozzi and the passionate and unscrupulous Matilda are in league against the lovers Verezzi and Julia, Matilda because she wants Verezzi herself, and Zastrozzi to avenge the seduction and abandonment of his mother by Verezzi's father. Verezzi is imprisoned, starved, and then told that it was all a fever dream. After he recovers, he saves Matilda from jumping off a bridge. She takes him home and works on him - counterfeits sensibility, declares her love. Finally she tells him that Julia is dead (a lie) and nurses him through his consequent collapse. (Her nursing is counter to the doctor's recommendation, for Verezzi tends to faint whenever he finds himself in Matilda's arms.) After setting up a scene in which she rescues him from stabbing, Matilda finally persuades Verezzi to marry her. Beause the Inquisition has begun to pursue her, she takes Verezzi to Venice, where he chances to see Julia, alive. After some fluctuation he commits suicide, for Julia arrives just as Matilda has won him back. Matilda snatches the dagger from his bosom and kills Julia as well. She and Zastrozzi are both taken by the Inquisition. She has a pretty vision and repents, but Zastrozzi stays imperturbable and mean to his last gasp on the rack.

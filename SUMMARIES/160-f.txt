THE FORTUNES OF PERKIN WARBECK. A ROMANCE

Mary Shelley believes that Perkin Warbeck was indeed the Duke of York who was thought to have been killed in the Tower by Richard III. The novel follows his adventures from his late childhood to his execution. The particulars of his attempts and ultimate failure to regain the throne of England, which constitute the principal part of the plot, may be omitted here, since there cannot be much suspense about events that have become history. Much of the novel's interest lies in the delineation of characters - the boy Richard; his betrayer Robin Clifford, who destroys himself by his own dishonor; Richard's sister Elizabeth, who suffers as the wife of Henry VII; Monina de Faro, who loves Richard and promotes his claim; the elderly Jane Shore, and others.

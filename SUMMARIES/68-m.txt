ANNA ST. IVES. A NOVEL

In this epistolary novel, Anna Wendbourne St. Ives travels to the continent, where she hopes she may meet Coke Clifton, the brother of her best friend, Louisa. Although both families have engaged in surreptitious matchmaking toward this end, Louisa has some misgivings that her brother may be a libertine. Further, Anna admires Frank Henley, the son of her father's comic but slightly sinister steward Abimelech, but is nervous about class difference. Anna is, however, sufficiently impressed by Frank's character and charity to take him along to France. Tensions between Henley and Clifton are complicated by Henley's twice saving Clifton's life. Clifton adores Anna and proposes to her but becomes increasingly incensed and desperate at learning of the matchmaking, at Anna's and Frank's attempts to reform him, at the catholicity of Anna's kindness. His marriage is delayed by his mother's insistence on a large dowry, which Abimelch despotically refuses to produce for his employer unless his own son Frank is to be the bridegroom.
The result of Clifton's anger is his decision to mask and play the hypocrite, to pretend reform and plot seduction. When he sees that Anna and Frank now plan to marry, and to Serve and Improve society, he decides to kidnap them both. Clifton proposes to rape Anna as an act of dominance but he encounters problems. On his first attempt she mashes his arm in the door, and on a subsequent occasion she simply talks him out of it. Clifton plans to kill himself after he accomplishes the rape (if he ever does) and has really repented but feels compelled to keep on as he has begun. He is not enjoying his project. Anna escapes over a wall and persuades Clifton to save Frank, who is about to be murdered by his jailer. Clifton is wounded and prefers death to benevolent nursing but is finally won round to goodness and recovery.

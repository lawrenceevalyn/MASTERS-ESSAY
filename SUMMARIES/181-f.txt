MADELINA. A TALE FOUNDED ON FACTS

Madelina and Rosamond are dissimilar sisters. Rosamond is playful and lighthearted; she marries Sir Essex St. Aubin after a pleasant and uneventful girlhood and has no particular troubles. Her sister Madelina is more serious and suffers from complications of the affections. She and Captain Glenmorris are in love, but her father wishes her to marry Lord Ormington. Madelina and Glenmorris part, promising to live for each other, but Madelina later hears a story that Glenmorris has married a rich heiress. After she recovers from the decline into which this news precipitates her, she marries Lord Ormington to please her father. Ormington dies in the end, and Glenmorris is single after all, so Madelina is free to marry the man she loves.
Many of the incidents in the novel seem designed principally to show the characters of the two sisters, though there is also a Gothic sighting of a white monk at some ruins and an account of a mysterious voice which says, "My hour is not yet come." There are, as well, some minor characters more lurid than the heroines and their heroes. Two girls suffer acutely as a result of relationships with men. Janetta, the "pity of all Rhydol," is insane during the two years she survives her drowned lover and runs wild in all weathers gathering flowers for his grave. Ellen, an orphan raised by Margaret Annendale, is betrayed and seduced by a friend of the family with whom she is left while her guardian travels to India. At the time of the novel she is pregnant and mildly deranged, and at last she goes into a decline and dies.

THE CASTLES OF ATHLIN AND DUNBAYNE. 1 vol. London: T. Hookham, 1789
The castle of Athlin is inhabited by the widow Matilda and
her children Osbert and Mary. When Osbert is old enough to
participate in the traditional feud against the house of
Dunbayne, he attacks the Baron Malcolm with the aid of his
friend Alleyn and is captured. The Baron covets Mary and II says she may be exchanged for Osbert, who will otherwise be II killed. Mary heroically consents to the exchange, though
she loves Alleyn, a relationship that is discouraged because he is a peasant, despite his refinement.
Meanwhile, Osbert has found a secret panel and gone ex- ploring. He discovers Laura, a young woman with whom he falls in love. She is locked up with her mother, who was married to the late Baron, Malcolm's elder brother, and to whom the castle should belong. Osbert escapes and is at- tacked at his castle by the Baron, who dying confesses that Laura's brother is not dead after all. The Baroness sees a birthmark and recognizes Alleyn as her missing son, so he is permitted to marry Osbert's sister. Since Alleyn has twice rescued Mary from kidnapping and has all the while borne the snobberies of Osbert, it is no less than he de-
serves.

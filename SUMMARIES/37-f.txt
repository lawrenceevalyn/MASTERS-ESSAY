THE PASSIONS

There are six principal characters in this novel: Baron Rozendorf, who speaks for reason; Count Wiemar and his beautiful wife Julia; Count Darlowitz and his virtuous wife Amelia; Countess Apollonia Zulmer, the villainess. Apollonia, who is a sort of Viennese bluestocking, misconstrued the attentions of Count Wiemar in his bachelor days and determines to get revenge for her embarrassment by destroying the thing he loves most, i.e., Julia. To effect this she befriends Julia, introduces her to feminism, anthropology, and relativism, and tries to make her read La Nouvelle Heloise; though Julia is so innocent as to be almost unteachable, these ideas enable Apollonia to make her secretive with her husband and somewhat unwary about her growing preoccupation with Count Darlowitz. Rozendorf sees it all coming but is unable to stop it. When Darlowitz, who reciprocates and feels terribly guilty, decides to solve the problem by fading away, Julia confesses her love and persuades him to live, secretly planning to pine away herself. Revived by an exchange of high platonic notes, neither dies after all. Amelia, however, does; although encouraged by her mother to live and be reconciled to her basically decent husband, she has visions of angels and expires. Darlowitz commits suicide. Wiemar, though he has not in fact been cuckolded, thinks Julia is polluted and refuses to live with her anymore. When Julia writes to Apollonia for help, she receives from that lady a cold note of dismissal and revelation and goes mad. Rozendorf is unable to persuade Wiemar to do more than send Julia money, though he seems to love her still. She escapes from her keeper and dies, barefoot, in a storm, on the doorstep of her old home.

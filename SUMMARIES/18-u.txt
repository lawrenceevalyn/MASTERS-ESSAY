COUNT RODERIC'S CASTLE, OR, GOTHIC TIMES. A TALE

Roderic the Hardy retires from public life because Astolpho, the new king, seems to be hostile toward him. With Roderic goes his son Rhinaldo, though Rhinaldo is in love with Isabel, the previous king's daughter, who is still at court. Rhinaldo finds adventure even in retirement, for while sheltering in a ruined mansion he encounters assassins, one of whom he kills and consequently is obliged to impersonate. There are exciting times at court too, some of them due to a villain named Rhodolpho, who among other outrages tries to rape Isabel. Quite a lot of the conflict is political, and in the end the usurper Astolpho is delivered into the hands of the rightful king Emmanuel, who is not, as people had supposed, dead. Roderic is not dead either, though he too was supposed to be so; on one occasion Roderic intended to assassinate Astolpho in his bed but found that his accustomed fealty had made him unequal to the task, and Astolpho, seeing him hover by the bedside, supposed himself to be receiving a ghostly visitation. With the political world in order, Rhinaldo and Isabel are free to marry.

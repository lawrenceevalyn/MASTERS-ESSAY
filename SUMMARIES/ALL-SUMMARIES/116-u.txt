THE MIDNIGHT GROAN, OR, THE SPECTRE OF THE CHAPEL

Horatio has left home after being informed that Miranda, whom he loves, is his sister. Sheltering from a storm in a convenient but ruined castle, he sees a ghost that leads him to a diamond ring and a putrefying female corpse. He finds himself locked in. When he escapes he discovers a secret assembly of men, Miranda's natural father presiding, who are dipping daggers into a bowl of blood. He is told that he must join their assembly or die by torture. Meanwhile Miranda has been sought and nearly acquired by several (sequential) men who are willing to marry her by force. She escapes all her difficulties by various means, however, and after some resolution of family mix-ups, Horatio and Miranda, not siblings after all, marry each other.

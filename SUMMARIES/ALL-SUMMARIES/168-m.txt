MARY JANE. A NOVEL

Radmill, a businessman, takes his family to Brighton. He has a son, Henry, and an adopted orphan, Mary Jane. Radmill's old friend Northcote goes into fits of rage every time Mary Jane talks to a man; in the case of Barville this is a sound reaction. He is a dissolute young man with a reputation as a seducer, and he kidnaps Mary Jane during a theater fire, after which he shuts her in a castle in Wales and tries to take "indecent freedoms," which are somehow deterred by a miniature of her parents. In the castle Mary Jane drops her candle while exploring and inadvertently picks up, instead, a human jawbone with scraps of putrefying flesh, a mistake that she fails to notice until a servant discovers it on her table. Later she comes upon the corpse from which she had removed it - Sickelmore provides loathsome detail - and pockets a diamond ring lying nearby. Barville is just prevented from killing her by someone whom we later discover to be her foster brother Henry, who has been having adventures of his own while in pursuit of her. Mary Jane escapes and goes home by public transportation, only to find the house locked up and to discover that she has lost the fare for the hackney coach. She gives the coachman the diamond ring. A pawnbroker recognizes the ring and reports it, but Henry arrives just in time to save Mary Jane from the officers of justice. We discover that Mary Jane is the child of Barville's elder brother by Northcote's daughter. Barville kills himself. Henry and Mary Jane marry.

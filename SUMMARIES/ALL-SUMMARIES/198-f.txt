THE KNIGHTS OF CALATRAVA, OR, DAYS OF CHIVALRY

The story takes place in the twelfth century. The knights Theodore and Alphonso are brothers; Alphonso is the good one, Theodore the bad. They both love Felicia, who prefers Alphonso. Theodore has her sent to a convent, but Alphonso follows her, and there he discovers Clara, another of Theodore's victims. Political changes free Felicia from the convent and make it possible for her to marry whom she likes. Theodore dies in battle, having left a confession that he was really married to Clara but had persuaded her that the marriage was bogus. Alphonso and Felicia marry; Clara becomes the new Abbess.

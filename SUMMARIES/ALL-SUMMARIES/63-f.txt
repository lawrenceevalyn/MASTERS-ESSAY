DUNCAN AND PEGGY. A SCOTTISH TALE

Duncan, who will someday be chief of the Campbells, is living with his uncle the Colonel. He defends Peggy, about whose poverty the other children are cruel, and the Colonel educates her and makes a settlement on her. Duncan and Peggy fall in love, to his parents' considerable disapproval; he proposes before going into the army. Peggy and the Colonel go to London and stay with Lady Beugle, Duncan's aunt who tries to find a man for Peggy so that her own daughter Eleanor can have Duncan. Peggy is unshaken in her loyalty to Duncan, despite the honorable advances of a nice old man who tries to give her a diamond necklace, and the attractions of Lady Beugle's son Wilmot. After the Colonel learns from Peggy's foster grandmother that the girl was born of a passing Jacobite who died in childbirth, he is opposed for political reasons to her marrying Duncan. Some years earlier the old woman's only son, Alan Grant, carrying a miniature portrait, went to hunt for Peggy's real family and never came back; but suddenly he appears, hav1ng survived slavery, dungeons, and Cherokees, to announce that Peggy is the Colonel's granddaughter. Duncan's engagement to Peggy is now acceptable. After some additional trouble (e.g., Peggy is arrested for shooting out the front teeth of a woman who earlier abducted her), the novel ends happily and Peggy's father is discovered alive.

ABBOT OF MONTSERRAT, OR, THE POOL OF BLOOD. A ROMANCE

Fernandez and Isabel, who have eloped in search of a cooperative priest to marry them, spend the night in the monastery of Montserrat. Isabel's father has opposed the marriage because of an ancient boundary dispute with Fernandez's father, who disappeared after losing the lawsuit. Fernandez's mother had been carried off by bandits some years earlier. (It is bandit country, in fact. The monastery pays protection money to Roldan, formidable chief of the local bandit troop.) At the monastery Fernandez discovers that a dying monk is his missing father, so the marriage receives a parental blessing after all.
Also at the monastery is a malcontent monk named Obando. He is accosted on several occasions by a demon who exudes yellow light and tries to corrupt him. At last he bargains away his soul in return for finding his long-lost brother, possession of aforementioned Isabel, and the post of Abbot. He discovers that Roldan is his brother. Roldan captures Isabel for him but forbids him to rape her, and she will not give in. Fernandez and others in the company whom Roldan also captures are released by Roldan's ex-mistress, who proves to be Fernandez's missing mother.
Though Obando becomes abbot by murdering his predecessor, his new position fails to make him happy. His crimes finally bring the bandits against the monastery from one side, the Inquisition from the other. Just then the demon carries him away through the roof, leaving the two forces to fight it out. (The bandits lose.) Obando repents in midair and is dropped back into the holocaust, where monks promise to pray for him, so perhaps his soul is not lost. The lovers marry and Fernandez's mother comes to live with them.

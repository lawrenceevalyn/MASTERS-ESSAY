ARIEL, OR, THE INVISIBLE MONITOR

Rosaline, a foundling raised in a good family, keeps hearing a mysterious voice which is followed by soft music; at first it says amorous things but later it sustains her in her various difficulties with utterances like "Virtue is its own protector, and innocence is ever the peculiar care of the Deity." After some initial uneasiness she learns to trust it. Her invisible monitor calls himself Ariel. Rosaline, evidently too attractive for her own good, has a great deal of trouble with importunate suitors: she is frightened by the advances of her foster brother Adolphus, though he is a good man and she apparently loves him; she is desired by both a count and a marquis, who stab each other; and she falls into the hands of a baron who locks her in a dungeon to force her marriage to a confederate of his. Ariel, who has earlier admitted his corporeality, leads her out of the Baron's dungeon. He has been in love with Rosaline all along. However, revelations of identity prove Rosaline to be the long-lost daughter of Baron St. Alvars, and as Ariel is really Bertrand St. Alvars they are too closely related for marriage, so he hands her over to Adolphus. The story is embellished by concealed doors, familiar-looking miniatures, and a madwoman who dresses in white and sits singing and praying on a tomb. All moans and other mysterious noises are accounted for in the end.

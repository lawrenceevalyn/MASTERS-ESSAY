THE SPECTRE CHIEF, OR, THE BLOOD-STAINED BANNER. AN ANCIENT ROMANCE

When wicked Rosalviva finds that his father is on the opposite side of a territorial dispute, he orders him murdered by the servant Barbaro. Then he accuses his good brother Marcellus of the murder and takes Marcellus's sweetheart Angelia. He is prevented from raping Angelia by seeing the ghost of his father beside the bed, which is curious because his father is not dead after all. In fact, he is so full of vigor that he kills Barbaro with an ax and hangs him up to rot, then shits Rosalviva up in the tower with his body. Marcellus and Angelia marry. The father goes to a monastery.

With THE SPECTRE CHIEF is bound BARON FITZALLAN
The hero is called home to the bedside of a dying guardian but is captured en route and put in a dungeon by his enemy Baron Fitzallan. He dreams while imprisoned that his wife is being stabbed and is calling for help. A ghost (the ghost of his father, as he later discovers) lets him out of the dungeon and gives him a dagger with which to take vengeance. Fitzallan confesses that he killed the hero's father and has captured his wife because he lusts after her. He dies of stab wounds, seeing demons.

THE WOOD DAEMON, OR, "THE CLOCK HAS STRUCK"

Una is warned in a vision to save the child Leolyn from the Wood Daemon, who is said to drink a child's blood every year. Count Hardyknute, whom Una considers marrying for social reasons, has secretly pledged the Daemon an annual victim in return for wealth and good looks. He always kills children because they can die innocent. Leolyn is the true heir to Hardyknute's place and title, and for years has been sheltered by Una's aunt; he is tongue-tied but is supposed to recover when he is ten. Hardyknute snatches Leolyn, stands on a bed, pulls a string, and sinks into the "fatal cavern." Aided by the ghosts of Leolyn's parents, Una duplicates the bed maneuver and joins them in the cavern. If Hardyknute does not sacrifice either Leolyn or Una to the Daemon by one o'clock he will be the Daemon's slave forever. Una delays the sacrifice by asking to pray, and Leolyn pushes the clock ahead, whereupon the Wood Daemon carries off Hardyknute. Una embraces the peasant boy to whom she was engaged before she was distracted by her ambition to marry into the aristocracy.

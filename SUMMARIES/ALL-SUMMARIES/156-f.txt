THE BALANCE OF COMFORT, OR, THE OLD MAID AND MARRIED WOMAN. A NOVEL 

Mrs. Vernon, who married imprudently, is living a meager life with three daughters still at home. The eldest, strong-willed and socially ambitious, marries a rich man who proves to be parsimonious. They quarrel and are unhappy. The second daughter is a romantic and marries a poor clergyman; they anticipate an idyllic love-and-a-crust rural life. But the clergyman is extravagant beyond their means and proves to be jealous of the baby. As people of excessive sensibility, they suffer even more than the other couple. The youngest and brightest daughter, Althea, visits her sisters and is appalled. She begins to consider being a spinster like her mother's friend Mrs. C., a wise and charming woman whose independence, contentment, and gracious domestic arrangements look a lot better than the available specimens of matrimony. Mrs. C. rather hopes to convert her to spinsterhood; Althea is her favorite. However, Althea finally makes a really good marriage and concludes that she is happier than she would have been alone, but that in general a single life is best. The moral, explicitly stated, is that the old maid loses occasional happiness and avoids much trouble; the balance will not change until more reason is brought to bear upon marriage.

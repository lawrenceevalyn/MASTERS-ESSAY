THE ITALIAN, OR, THE CONFESSIONAL OF THE BLACK PENITENTS. A ROMANCE

Vincentio di Vivaldi falls in love with Ellena Rosalba, whom he has seen in church. The attraction is reciprocal and Ellena's aunt permits Vivaldi's suit. His mother, however, is outraged because Ellena has neither title nor wealth. Consequently, the Marchesa di Vivaldi and her evil confessor Schedoni conspire to kidnap Ellena the week before Vivaldi plans to marry her. When Vivaldi tries to go to Ellena's house, a mysterious monk, who seems to be supernatural, warns him away. Pursuing, the hero finds Ellena in a convent, where the Abbess is forcing her to take the veil. He helps her escape, with the assistance of her friend Sister Olivia. But their wedding is interrupted by men who claim to be officers of the Inquisition and summon Vivaldi for abducting a nun. He is wounded and Ellena carried off again. We know from a previous conversation that Schedoni has agreed to kill her.
Ellena is locked up in a derelict marble house near the sea and guarded by an old man. When Schedoni comes to stab her he discovers that she is wearing a miniature of him as a younger man and concludes that she is his daughter. That being the case, he wants her to marry Vivaldi after all and sets about freeing the prospective bridegroom from the cells of the Inquisition. In the meantime, Vivaldi has been secretly told to ask certain questions at his trial; they result in Schedoni's being accused of fratricide and of the violation and death of his brother's widow. Olivia turns out to be the widow in question, not dead after all, and in fact Ellena's mother. She assures Ellena that Schedoni is not her father but her cruel uncle. Vivaldi's mother has the decency to repent and die. Vivaldi and Ellena marry.

THE ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION, OR, THE HISTORY OF MARIA WILLIAMS. A TALE FOR MISSES AND THEIR MAMMAS

West says that the purpose of her novel is "to counteract evils incident to romantic conclusions which youth are apt to form" and suggests that any reader over sixteen may be bored.
When Maria Williams is taken out of school after her father's death, her mother allows her to choose their place of residence. She chooses the village where her friend Charlotte Raby lives. Charlotte is wealthy and generous but flighty. She is allowed more entertainments than Maria, e.g., a regimental ball. Maria, on the other hand, acquires a taste for philanthropy, some of it assisted by Charlotte's contributions, and establishes a little school. After marrying a Major Pierpoint (a match that does not turn out well) Charlotte tries to play go-between for a man who fancies Maria. He is really Henry Neville, a baronet, who will marry Maria if marrying is the only way to get her, but he is using the name of Stanley. Maria is pulled into the conspiracy so far as to keep Stanley's interest a secret from her mother, but she is saved from further involvement by Neville's remorseful suicide upon seeing the corpse of a girl he has seduced. Maria marries a much nicer man and at last loses touch with Charlotte, for the two women have become hopelessly unlike.

THE BRAVO OF VENICE

Count Rosalvo, banished by an enemy, is starving in Venice. He hires himself out under the name of Abellino to a band of assassins, to whom he proves himself by beating them all in a test of strength. He is extraordinarily ugly, with only one eye and a big mouth, but this appearance is merely a disguise. His first assignment is to murder the Doge's niece Rosabella. Instead he kisses Rosabella and murders his chief; the murder is part of his plan to kill the other bravos and be the only one in Venice, thus acquiring all the business and discovering which villains employ assassins. At this time a handsome stranger, Flodoardo, comes to the Doge and offers to destroy all the bravos. He and Rosabella immediately fall in love. The discerning reader comes to suspect that Count Rosalvo is managing yet another alias. The difficulties of wearing two hats climax when Flodoardo is promised to Rosabella on condition of his capturing Abellino. At a large dinner party, to which a number of conspirators against the Doge have been invited, he manages an approximation of this feat by a quick exit and change of costume. The guests are understandably angry. However, Rosabella pleads for him, and he satisfies the Doge by identifying the conspirators and restoring several important statesmen he was supposed to have killed in his capacity as bravo. As he managed really to kill his enemy the Prince, who was courting Rosabella too, the story ends happily for him.

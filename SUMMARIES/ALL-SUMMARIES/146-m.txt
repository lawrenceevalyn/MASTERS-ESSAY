A SUFFOLK TALE, OR, THE PERFIDIOUS GUARDIAN

Marshall Duroc leaves France for political reasons and goes to live in Ireland as De Claridge. His son Alfred, at a military academy, makes an exceedingly bad friend - William O'Connor, who plans to be a doctor. Alfred becomes a soldier and is stationed near William, to whom he confides his love for Louisa, a beautiful cottage girl. William advises seduction rather than marriage, but Alfred proposes and goes to tell his family. When his father refuses consent, Alfred and Louisa run off to Gretna Green. William, who wrote a misleading letter to Alfred's father and thus helped dissuade him from giving his consent, continues to make epistolary trouble in hopes of becoming Alfred's guardian, in charge of paying out his allowance. He gets his chance when Alfred goes into foreign service at his father's request, having been promised a later family reconciliation. William is now in a position to defraud Alfred of both affection and property.
Alfred and Louisa go to Fredericton, New Brunswick, where Louisa dies of what sounds like pneumonia. During their absence De Claridge dies of a broken heart. When Alfred, who has been pining and writing poetry about Louisa's death, goes home on leave, he finds that William's house is remarkably elegant for a village apothecary's and begins to suspect some financial fraud; when he asks for an account, William has him arrested for debt. His imprisonment causes his mother to die of shock, and William will not even let him out to bury her. After several months of imprisonment Alfred becomes mildly insane, finally killing himself. Nothing happens to William except that he is not happy, for nobody likes him.

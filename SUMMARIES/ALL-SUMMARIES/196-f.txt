THE REFUSAL. A NOVEL

West embellishes her novel with elaborate chapter titles and a witty introduction lamenting the death of Prudentia Homespun (herself). The heroine is Emily Mandaville. Her crochety uncle calls her away from the aunt with whom she has been living, to come and live with him. West refers to this move as "CHAPTER II. The heroine liberated from a convent to be confined in a castle, where, having enchanted her keeper, she prepared for herself imaginary fetters." Emily's uncle likes her and finds her a husband, Sydney Avondel, whom she marries at the end of the first volume. ("CHAPTER VIII. An instance of Mrs. Prudentia's bad management. Hymen pops into the first volume with very little prearrangement, and thus the narrative ceases to be interesting.")
Avondel struggles to be faithful to Emily despite his attraction to Selina Delamore. He and Emily have a little boy whom they call Sydney after his father. Soon Paulina, an Italian friend of Avondel's whom he describes as "original," moves into the neighborhood. Emily dreads her advent but is fascinated by her for some time. Paulina wears wild and revealing costumes and has a little boy who is also named Sydney, in honor of Avondel's having saved them from a tiger. She claims to love Avondel with holy platonic affection. Paulina works on Avondel's susceptibility and starts a rumor that Emily is her aunt's illegitimate daughter and consequently ineligible to inherit any money. At last Avondel comes to despise Paulina, who is at one point arrested as a felon. But he is killed in a duel and Emily leads a sad life as a widow. Paulina preserves her reputation by marrying a respectable man who wants her money, but she is not happy either. "CHAPTER XXXIV. Instead of distributing rewards and punishments, Mrs. Prudentia concludes with an essay on the advantages of affliction."

AN ANGEL'S FORM AND A DEVIL'S HEART

The angelic form referred to in the title belongs to the Marchioness of A, formerly a Miss Fitz-Arthur. The novel is full of complicated love affairs, old jiltings, mysterious godparents, and people who look like other people. Edward, the hero, is much taken with the friendly overture of the Marchioness, who not only is old enough to be his mother but turns out really to bear that relationship to him. He has been raised by her ex-servant Alice, by Alice's admirable husband, MacKenzie, and by Alice's mother. He also possesses a mysterious godfather, Maurice Colville, who turns out to be his paternal grandfather. Because of his considerable artistic talent, Edward is sent to a London art school where he makes additional complicated social connections. At last a housekeeper tells secrets, Edward's true father claims him, the Marchioness commits suicide with laudanum and Edward discovers that Janet, the girl he loves, is not his sister. A particularly interesting secondary character is an unpleasantly headstrong girl named Clara, who pursues Edward, ruins her family with extravagance, and finally misses her mother's deathbed blessing by eloping at the wrong time with a man who later takes mistresses while she turns to gaming.

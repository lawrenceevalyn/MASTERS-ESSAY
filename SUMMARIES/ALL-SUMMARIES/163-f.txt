LODORE

Lodore is the surname of a virtuous, obscure, and vaguely unlucky family. The son Henry (who had at Eton a friend remarkably like the juvenile Shelley) marries Cornelia Santarre on her sixteenth birthday. She is so dominated by her mother that he takes the baby Ethel and goes to the States after offering her a chance to come along. Twelve years later, on the way home, he is killed in a duel. Ethel lives with her paternal Aunt Bessie, her fashionable mother having rashly promised not to see her. Affection develops between Ethel and Edward Villiers, who was her father's second in his duel. Though poor, he is a gentleman; he somehow sacrifices his prospects to marry her. Ethel and Edward survive in London on love and little else, ducking bailiffs until he is finally arrested. The couple is "living within the rules" in a horrid house when Ethel's mother finds them and resolves to give them everything and retire to Wales. En route to Wales she comes down with scarlet fever, and the couple later finds her in the same town as Aunt Bessie, grown thoroughly lovable.

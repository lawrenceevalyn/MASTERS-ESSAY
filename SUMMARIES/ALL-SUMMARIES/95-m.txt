LONGSWORD, EARL OF SALISBURY. AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE

Sir Randolph, retired knight, is surprised to discover that a pilgrim with a big sword whom he sees disembark from a small boat is his old general, the Earl of Salisbury. The Earl is accompanied by a younger pilgrim who is introduced as the daughter of his friend and former enemy Les Roches. Salisbury, who is the illegitimate son of Henry II, wants nothing more than peace and retirement with his wife Ela. He has had an exhausting time since Sir Randolph last saw him, having been shipwrecked in France, where he made friends with Les Roches and where they both suffered the persecutions of the jealous and vindictive Count Malleon. There have been escapes, betrayals, kidnappings, and misunderstandings, and at last Les Roches has disappeared; his daughter Jacqueline and the Earl still hope to find him. Jacqueline is also separated from the young man whom she loves and who helped her when she was kidnapped for politico-military reasons by his father, Count Chauvigny.
Sir Randolph reluctantly tells the Earl that his castle has been taken by Raymond, nephew to the king's favorite. Raymond would like to have Ela as well. He and his villainous friends try to make her marry him by threatening to harm her child, and she falls gravely ill from shock and strain. Her forced wedding to Raymond is interrupted by the announcement of Salisbury's impending arrival, though he does not actually come to the castle for some time. He has been incorrectly informed that his wife has married Raymond and has gone to demand his rights from the king. This gives the villains time to quarrel among themselves and, after an abortive attempt to poison the Earl, they come to bad ends. Les Roches, whose sudden arrival caused the Earl to drop his poisoned cup, is reunited with his daughter, young Chauvigny arrives to fight for justice, and marriages are made and resumed.

THE FASHIONABLE FRIEND. A NOVEL

Henrietta Melville and Colonel Beaufort are secretly married; only her friend Caroline Tylney and his friend Henry Courtney know about it. In fact, the neighbors think that Henrietta is being kept, and Caroline's parents will not permit her to visit. (The novel is epistolary.) Henry is supposed to take care of Henrietta while her husband is away on military duty, but he falls in love with her and burns Beaufort's letters as they arrive. When she realizes what is going on she runs away and leaves her child with Henry, who repents. Her marriage is fragile, for she and Beaufort were underage and he can abandon her if he chooses. When he comes back he mistakenly believes her to be a loose woman, but his father has faith in her, and Henrietta's name is finally cleared.
Her friend Caroline has trouble with suitors. She is pursued by Mr. Danby but loves Mr. Cornwall. Her father has offered to Mr. Cornwall Caroline's elder sister Lucy; the anger and confusion generated by that misunderstanding require no description. Caroline is sent into the country to be guarded by a vengeful and hostile Lucy, but Lucy's conspiracy and sexual intimacy with Danby are opportunely brought to light. Danby and Lucy are compelled to marry, and Caroline is permitted to marry Cornwall.

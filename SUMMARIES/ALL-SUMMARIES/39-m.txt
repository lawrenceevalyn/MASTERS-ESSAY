SIR FRANCIS DARRELL, OR, THE VORTEX. A NOVEL

Sir Francis Darrell and his friend Vernon in their correspondence say a lot about the Vortex, by which they mean the social whirl, the maelstrom of fashionable dissipation; Darrell warns Vernon that the Vortex is dangerous and not at all a game. Darrell himself is not received in "scrupulous society," but he attracts the notice of Augusta Saville, an upright young lady who thinks she should try to steady him. Dartford, who is already steady, wants Augusta, but he does not seem to interest her very much. Influenced by Augusta, Darrell begins exploring his Bible. He has trouble with the problem of evil, for he wants a God of Love but can see little evidence of dominant goodness in the world. Correspondence with Vernon is now full of reports about his progress with biblical studies (excess of black bile, says Vernon), and he begins to correspond with Augusta as well. Augusta's father would like her to marry Darrell, but she feels that she cannot marry someone from whom she differs on so important an issue as religion. At last Darrell feels that he is obliged to believe in the devil if he is not to lose the God he has so painstakingly found. He sends Augusta a manuscript account of his past sins and waits in suspense to see whether she will have him. Just then someone stabs him and he seems likely to die. Augusta goes to pieces, says she was overzealous to think everyone should be Roman Catholic, promises to be whatever religion Darrell likes (though she has him confess and receive the sacrament), and marries him on what she thinks is his deathbed. His unexpected recovery provides a happy ending. The author explains that he intended to let Darrell die at the end but was dissuaded by a friend.

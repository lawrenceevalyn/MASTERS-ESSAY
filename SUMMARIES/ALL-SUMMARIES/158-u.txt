KOENIGSMARK, THE ROBBER, OR, THE TERROR OF BOHEMIA

Herman and Theodore are sitting in a German inn, talking about Adolphus Rosenburg, who was assassinated in the forest after one year of marriage. He was lured to his death by a woman's cries and a white form. Another man in the inn tells a related story about an ancestor of his who was asked by a lady in the forest to destroy a spider. The spider had yellow eyes and grew larger and then disappeared; the man was unable to kill it; his sword bounced off the spider as it would off a rock. The next day he saw a wolf turn into a man. On both days he heard mysterious voices speak of his "punishment."
Herman and Theodore hear a plot against Rosenburg's father-in-law; Koenigsmark evidently wishes to capture Adelaide, Rosenburg's widow. The two heroes, with friends, attack the robber and his men, but Koenigsmark's body is apparently impervious to knife-blades. Theodore is imprisoned by Koenigsmark but later helped to escape by a kindly robber who is of noble origins. Rosenburg's ghost has offered encouragement from time to time and now asserts that Theodore should not kill himself, for Adelaide's child needs him. Certainly it needs someone, for its mother, who has become mildly deranged, loses it in the forest. It is recovered, however. (Adelaide is not the only lunatic in the story; another woman sits under the gibbeted bones of her hanged lover and raves.) After Koenigsmark's capture, Rosenburg's shade makes a final appearance, and Adelaide, electing to follow it, dies. A man with a mask passes by and stabs Koenigsmark as he is put on the rack. Since the robber dies this time, albeit with a loud laugh, everyone assumes that the masked man was an evil spirit.

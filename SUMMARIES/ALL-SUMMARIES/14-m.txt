SIR RALPH WILLOUGHBY. AN HISTORICAL TALE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY

Sir Ralph Willoughby, whose father Lord Uffington is in political exile from England, goes to the court of Elizabeth I and fills in, first, with Lord Burleigh. Burleigh is contemptuous of Willoughby's poetic tendencies and at last dismisses him, though not altogether for that reason; various people have conspired toward his downfall. Essex next takes him up (Willoughby has a precognitive dream of him with an open and bloody neck), and after further machinations he falls into Raleigh's hands. Raleigh hopes to extract the secrets of both Burleigh and Essex. Willoughby is beginning to be disillusioned with court life and with ambition in general. Before he can thoroughly embrace the simpler life he contemplates he is shipwrecked and becomes temporarily lunatic with fever; while he wanders and raves and hallucinates, people imagine that he is Essex in disguise. Later, when James comes to the throne and knights him, Willoughby finds himself involved in court intrigue again, for Salisbury things he aspires to Lady Arabella Stuart - he does find her very attractive - and takes the opportunity, when Raleigh accidentally implicates Willoughby in a trial, to destroy him. His manuscript scheme for an epic poem counts heavily against him. He is executed for treason.

THE EXILES, OR, MEMOIRS OF THE COUNT

As the subtitle suggests, the Count de Cronstadt's adventures are principal to this epistolary novel, though Reeve devotes some space as well to his two friends and correspondents, J. s. Berkeley and Monsieur de Courville. De Cronstadt's father, turned out by his family for marrying a social inferior, died prematurely, as did his wife and all his children except the hero. After the death of his parents, de Cronstadt was taken in by his paternal uncle, a not unkindly miser and alchemist, who immediately forbade clandestine marriage on pain of disinheritance. But one day de Cronstadt rescued a beautiful cottage girl, Jacqueline Volker from sexual assault. He and Jacqueline fell in love, despite her mother's anxieties about class difference, and somehow passion, misunderstandings, and good intentions combined to lead him into the very circumstances he was supposed to avoid. His clandestine marriage has been happy, and De Cronstadt has managed to escape his uncle's attempts to matchmake. But when the correspondence of the novel takes place, matters have been intolerably complicated by De Cronstadt's marrying his general's daughter Melusina; he has succumbed to social and professional pressures despite his love for Jacqueline and their little boy Frederic. The difficulties of maintaining two good marriages are aggravated by Peter-Paul Schneider, a vengeful and blackmailing servant (earlier dismissed by De Cronstadt) who wants Jacqueline for himself. Schneider finally destroys her, first sending her into a decline by telling her about De Cronstadt's bigamy and then sending her into shock by brandishing a pistol. De Cronstadt pursues and kills him but in the process is fatally wounded. His will amply provides for both of his families, his uncle having previously died in an alchemical mishap and left De Cronstadt his fortune.

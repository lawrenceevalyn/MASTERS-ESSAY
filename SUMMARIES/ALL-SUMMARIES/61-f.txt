MONTALVA, OR, ANNALS OF GUILT

Stephano Montalva and Ferdinando D'Rosorio, whose parents are friends, grow up together. D'Rosorio is good, Montalva bad. Montalva is a seducer of girls, a borrower of money, a faithless friend. He loves Valeria but will not marry her because she is poor. Instead, he seduces her with promises of marriage and after the birth of their daughter puts Valeria in a convent and the child out to nurse. Mother and child die. Jealous of D'Rosorio's child and money, Montalva poisons him and acquires both. He tires of the child and hires a man to help drug it and spirit it away, pretending that it is dead. The accomplice later dies.
Montalva, in Spain, begins to notice other people doing kind deeds and starts to feel wicked and sorry. He finds a girl (Ellen Dudley) who still loves the seducer who deserted her, and he supports and lives with her. When she has a child and leaves Montalva, he goes after her and invites her back even though he learns that the child is not his, but she refuses to come. He has begun to do other mildly good deeds and to feel new emotions, like pity. He finds in a convent a girl he believes to be D'Rosorio's child, the one whom he drugged and cheated of her inheritance; she does not want to stay cloistered. A demon disguised as a minstrel tempts him to kill her and avoid the rack of the Inquisition, then disappears in blue flames. As Montalva approaches the girl's bed with a dagger, the ghost of Valeria informs him that it is his own child Isobel, who did not die but was kidnapped in infancy. Montalva dies in agonies of remorse. Isobel marries her lover and they found a monastery with D'Rosorio's money.

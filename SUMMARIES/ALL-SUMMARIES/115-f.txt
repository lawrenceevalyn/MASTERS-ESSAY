THE VEILED PROTECTRESS, OR, THE MYSTERIOUS MOTHER. A NOVEL

Pemberton tells his wife that their marriage is not valid, that he is already married to someone else, and that Pemberton is not his real name. He leaves her two thousand pounds and an apologetic note. She decides not to tell their three-year-old son, and in order to maintain his respectability she calls him Henry Pembroke and sends him to live with a friend who calls herself Mrs. Wilson. Four months later Henry is told that his mother has died. The reader soon surmises that she has not, but is the new and heavily veiled companion of Mrs. Jane Meredith, a blind woman. The three women - Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Jane Meredith, and Henry's mother - form a kind of secret committee devoted to Henry's welfare. They send the boy away to school, where he is kindly treated and where his mother comes to see him from time to time. He calls this mysterious woman his Veiled Protectress and apparently believes her to be Mrs. Meredith. While Henry is still a boy both Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Meredith die, and he is given into the guardianship of Sir Herbert Charleville, a pleasant man with a new wife. Henry has a number of adventures in his boyhood, but the one w1th the farthest-reaching effect is his rescue of Anna Farnham from her drunken foster father. Some years later, after he has embarked upon a military career, he discovers that Anna is the daughter of his Colonel and marries her. The major revelation, however, is that his mother is not only alive but is the wife of Charleville, his guardian.

THE HOUSE OF RAVENSPUR. A ROMANCE

The Earl of Ravenspur's younger brother Lord Henry is inferior (though cunning) and therefore jealous. The brothers go to Italy for a royal wedding - the son of Edward III is marrying Victorine - and there meet the bride's friend Angelina Frescati, who wants the Earl but is willing to settle for marriage to Lord Henry. Victorine also wants the Earl and later appears to have pined to death; at any rate she dies, warning Ravenspur to beware his brother. Ravenspur is by that time married to his real love, Lady Geraldine Fitzhugh. Lord Henry makes trouble for his brother, at first relatively minor trouble like competing against him at a tournament (the motto on Henry's shield is "My time will come"), and later serious trouble, like undermining the king's trust in him until he is arrested for treason and sent into exile, leaving Henry to become Earl. Geraldine is pregnant at the time; her old father dies of grief. The servant Jacques remains faithful, and Clod the fool, though Clod now works for Henry.
Henry and Angelina have a son, Harry, who is a brat, "spoiled and riotous." His foster sister, a foundling named Gertrude, when she grows up prefers a convent to marrying him for the convent is at worst merely boring. In the convent she sees the ghosts of both Ravenspur and Geraldine, and it is thought when she disappears that the ghosts have carried her off, but in fact she has been abducted by Father Rupert. By this time the reader has begun to suspect that Ravenspur and Geraldine are alive and back in the country, as is indeed the case. Gertrude is aided to some degree in her difficulties by Lord Edward Saltoun, who marries her at the end. The Ravenspurs' adventures are recounted at length. There are complications of villainy and kidnapping and some dealing with the Inquisition, but at last Henry admits that Gertrude is the daughter of the rightful earl, and the novel ends with the establishment of justice.

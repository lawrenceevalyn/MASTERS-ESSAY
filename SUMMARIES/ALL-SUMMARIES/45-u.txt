FATAL VOWS, OR, THE FALSE MONK. A ROMANCE

Count Savani, owner of Savani Castle, has two dissimilar sons, Montavole (bad) and Alberto (good). Montavole, who has left home young, makes an appointment to talk to a man who has saved him from robbers. The man calls himself Rinaldo and swears Montavole to friendship; if Montavole defaults, the Sword will ruin his family and kill his son, if he has any. Rinaldo was preceded at the interview by a female specter who told Montavole to "beware of holy St. Peter's Day." After their father's death the brothers both marry. Montavole and Leonora have a son. Alberto's wife dies in childbirth (as does the child) after her husband disappears during a walk, leaving behind no evidence but a bloody cloak and a sword.
Twenty years pass. Leonora is nursed on her deathbed by an orphan girl named Miranda, who loves and is loved by Alphonso, the son of the house. He is obliged to marry, in order to save his father from debt, a woman named Cassandra, but Cassandra accidentally drinks poison and dies. Miranda is persecuted by a monk named Roderigo. She makes friends with Alonzo, a cottage boy who has been deranged for ten years as the result of falling downstairs. At the end of the story Alonzo is killed by Montavole's ruffians but proves to be Montavole's own son. Someone swapped babies. Alphonso is Alberto's son, and Alberto is not dead after all. Alphonso and Miranda marry, and Rinaldo is executed.

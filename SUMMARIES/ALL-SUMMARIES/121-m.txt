THE EPICUREAN. A TALE

Alciphron is elected, at twenty-four, to be chief of the Epicureans. Unfortunately he is constitutionally not much inclined to pleasure. He dreams that a man tells him to go to the source of the Nile for eternal life and he sets out, contemplating ruins and Time. In Memphis he sees and begins to pursue an extraordinarily beautiful girl. He rows to the city of the dead and pursues her into pyramids and finally down a well. Letters of fire lead him toward a secret. To reach it he must go through a forest of burning trees with serpents of fire, through a flood with wailing specters floating down it, and up a set of stairs which break away under his feet. Then he dangles from a brass ring which ultimately lets him down in a garden where a priest tells him that he has won victory over his body, He is initiated into the odd sect responsible for these adventures, but at the moment of Great Illumination the beautiful girl persuades him to run away with her. A secret Christian, she takes him to her brethren. Alciphron pretends, and even tries, to convert so that he will be allowed to marry her, but in his heart he cannot believe in this new religion. However, they are betrothed. When they go back to the city she is martyred and dies in his arms, after which he really becomes a Christian and dies in a later persecution.

THE MAID OF THE HAMLET. A TALE

After Matilda's parents die in America, where her father was sent on military duty, she is adopted by their dearest friend, Mr. Belmore. Mr. Belmore has lost his patrimony to a distant relative who discovered some long-lost and pertinent papers, but he and Matilda are not destitute. They move to a smaller house and in the new neighborhood find two particularly interesting men. The first is Bromley - young, elegant, and sexually unscrupulous. He has designs on Matilda and pursues her unremittingly despite her lack of response and, later, her change in marital status. Roche presents from time to time evidence of Bromley's earlier escapades, e.g., a discarded woman with three children, a spaniel once given him by a woman he ruined.
More interesting than Bromley is the recluse Charles Howard, said to be mad, proved to be philanthropical, and clearly attracted to Matilda despite his disillusionment with women. He has some reason to be jaundiced, for he is married to, though apparently not living with, an especially perfidious woman, formerly the wife of his friend Pelham. (She told him that she was a widow, when in fact she was divorced.) Matilda likes Howard very much, but while he is away with the army she marries Hartland, a friend of her guardian's, more from amiability than from love. In the end, however, Hartland dies and Howard's wife is drowned in a shipwreck, so Matilda and Howard marry each other.

THE CONFESSIONAL OF VALOMBRE. A ROMANCE

Theodore is left in infancy at the monastery of Valombre by a man who murders the abbot. He is raised by Father Betsolin and is good, though a little passionate. He wants to become a monk, but Betsolin tells him to see the world first. At about that time a mysterious stranger offers to help Theodore discover his origins, binding him with a terrible oath of secrecy. Theodore goes on a mission for the monastery and discovers Montaubon, the mysterious stranger, operating as the leader of banditti. Montaubon identifies himself as Theodore's father; the boy is horrified but develops an interest in saving his father's soul. Montaubon seems to imagine that he sees the ghost of the murdered abbot. Later a ghost tells him to repent, and he falls downstairs and fractures his head. But Father Betsolin reveals that Theodore's father was really the murdered Duke of Vermandois. In fact, Montaubon is Theodore's uncle and the murderer in question. Theodore finds a sister, as well as identifying his parents, and manages to dig up and move his father's bones to the family vault. He marries Juliette, a convent boarder with whom he has been in love, and attributes his good fortune to Father Betsolin's correct principles.

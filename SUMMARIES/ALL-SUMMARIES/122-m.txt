THE HAUNTED CAVERN. A CALEDONIAN TALE

The novel begins during the reign of Henry VI. Sir James Wallace, who owns a ruined castle in Aberdeenshire, is a bad man - "of a sordid disposition, deceitful, cruel, and designing, his heart ... a stranger to humanity or compassion." He sends his wife Matilda away to a corrupt convent in Rouen but keeps his infant daughter Jane at home. Matilda, who was given him in marriage by an ambitious father, loved Alan Duntrone, who is said to have died of wounds in France. Jane is raised with and falls in love with her cousin Eldred, son of Matilda's mysteriously missing brother Archibald. Her father, however, supports the suit of Donald of the Isles, a ferocious man who is willing to take her by coercion. A forced wedding is planned, but Jane and Eldred, with the blessing of a veiled and mysterious female figure, elope and are hidden by Ambrose the hermit. (Ambrose has interesting tales to tell of the wars, of Joan of Arc, of pirates and imprisonment and captivity by one Muley Abdallah, whose daughter effected Ambrose's release.)
Shortly after the elopement Jane takes a nap under a tree and disappears; Eldred falls ill. He finally discovers Jane at Donald's, looking pale and unhappy. When he tries to carry her away he is wounded and captured. In his dungeon (the cavern of the title) he discovers a rusty dagger and a skeleton and hears unaccountable moans. One day a manuscript written by his missing father falls on his head; Eldred concludes that the bones are his father's too. When he is released from his prison he sets about avenging his father's death, but his attempts are interrupted by a pilgrim who removes a false beard and claims Eldred as his son. Other reunions follow: Eldred rescues Jane just as she is being forcibly married to Donald; Jane's mother, the mysterious female who blessed the elopement, is restored to her; and Ambrose identifies himself as Alan, the long-lost love of the now fortuitously widowed Matilda Wallace.

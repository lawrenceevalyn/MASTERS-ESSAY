ST. BOTOLPH'S PRIORY, OR, THE SABLE MASK. AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE

In Cromwell's time St. Aubuspine goes with his wife and their daughter Roselma to live in a moldering priory with a bad reputation. The household is nervous, given to ghost-seeing and general jumpiness: St. Aubuspine is hiding and expects harm and ruin of some sort; Roselma is a reader of bloody manuscript romances. Some shipwrecked people admitted to the priory from charitable motives include De Rochemaude, a stranger whom Roselma's father suddenly urges her to marry, despite the distress of her mother. Roselma is willing to marry De Rochemond, though she does not love him, but is frightened by his passion and haste. The ceremony takes place in the ruined chapel and is disrupted by the servant Pierre, who makes a stifled effort to say something about the bridegroom; by a party of Independents who arrest the father of the bride; and finally by a huge figure in black whose voice turns the bridegroom pale. Upon reading a packet handed him by the mysterious figure, De Rochemonde says that he and Roselma must part forever. Then, apparently changing his mind, he says that they will not part, that they are married; but in any case he is obliged to leave before the marriage is consummated. Roselma's mother dies, raving about a secret. When, two volumes later, the secret is revealed, we discover the De Rochemonde is "iniquitous Adolpha," a former royalist turned agent for the Independents, and Roselma's uncle. St. Aubuspine supposedly killed Roselma's real father in order to acquire her mother, but the father did not die after all and was the figure in black who warned against the incestuous wedding. Roselma marries the Marquis of Valmont, a heroic young man who has behaved well at various points in the story.

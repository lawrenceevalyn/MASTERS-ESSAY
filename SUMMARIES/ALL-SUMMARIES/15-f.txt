CLARENTINE. A NOVEL

Clarentine Delmington, an orphan, is about thirteen as the novel begins. She lives with her uncle's family. Her foster brothers Edgar and Frederick are so fond of her that they resent the caretaking she voluntarily lavishes upon their youngest sister Emma; they wish that Clarentine would be more fun. Young Somerset, another cousin, appears as the story begins and inquires about her welfare, as he too wishes to take care of her. Later the household is enlarged by the temporary acquisition of Julia, whose mother has gone abroad with an ailing son. Although limp and spiritless at first, Julia improves under Clarentine's influence and develops an interest in Edgar. Edgar, however, wants Clarentine and proposes to her, which gets her into serious trouble: he does it at night, alone, in the parlor, and they are seen. At last he promises himself to Julia, and Clarentine is forgiven. She receives a proposal also from a Mr. Eltham, who continues impetuously to pursue her after her refusal. After a variety of troubles, Somerset and Clarentine decide to marry each other, and Clarentine's foster sister Sophia accepts Eltham.

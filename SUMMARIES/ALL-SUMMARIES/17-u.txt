THE CAVERN OF HORRORS, OR, MISERIES OF MIRANDA. A NEAPOLITAN TALE

This chapbook concentrates on the establishment-of-identity plot, producing along the way a fine assortment of coffins, bones, blood, daggers, and creaking doors. The heroine Miranda is ostensibly the youngest daughter of a Neapolitan vendor of fruit and ice snow. She ordinarily lives in a convent but has been extricated to help with the family business. She attracts the attention of several men, most important of whom is the young Cavalier Napolo di Lagana, who later sends notes to her convent. After adventures that include being kidnapped by a father and son who wish to sell her to the Moors, she discovers the identity of her real parents, establishes her legitimacy, and marries Napolo.

THE WANDERINGS OF WARWICK. A NOVEL 

Captain Warwick is a friend and brother-in-law to Orlando, the hero of The Old Manor House (published in the year previous). He has inherited General Tracy's estate and returned to England with his wife Isabella. This volume is his account to Orlando of their wanderings from the time of their marriage until their coming home. They have been to North America and to Jamaica and have spent some time in Spain and Portugal. Several of the anecdotes seem to have other people at the crux of the adventure; the narrative is studded with military exploits, privateers, flagellation, suspicions of infidelity, bullfighting, imprisonment, and so on. Warwick at one point reduces his family to beggary by gaming but asserts that poverty was good for him, because it made him consider himself the steward of his two boys rather than a man of the world.

FATAL REVENGE, OR, THE FAMILY OF MONTORIO. A ROMANCE

Ippolito and Annibal are the two eldest sons of the Count of Montorio. They are close to each other but dissimilar; Ippolito is fond of luxury and high living, while Annibal is inclined to stay at home and muse. The sinister confessor Schemoli works hard during the course of the novel to convince the brothers that he has supernatural power and that they must obey him and kill their father. His devices are complex and ingenious and provide the principal business of the novel. His approach with Annibal is to pass himself off as a specter who requires, indeed demands, aid and obedience. He impresses Ippolito chiefly with his omnipresence and consequent inescapability. Both young men are persuaded that they are predestined to be parricides and at last perform the deed. Schemoli, however, has made a miscalculation which requires explanation. He was Orazio, the former count of Montorio. His wicked brother led him to kill a man supposed to be his wife's lover. Orazio killed the man with relish and in front of his wife, who died of shock, cursing him. He later discovered that his brother's hints had been misleading and so he fled, leaving behind his two boys. When he comes back to take vengeance on his brother, he fails to recognize Annibal and Ippolito as his own sons and makes them murderers. They go into the army and are pardoned. Orazio dies of a broken blood vessel.

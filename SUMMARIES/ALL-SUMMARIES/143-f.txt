THE TWO MENTORS. A MODERN STORY

Edward Saville's guardian, Richard Munden, wishes to make him a man of the world, i.e., something of a rake. To this purpose he sends Edward to visit the racy Lady Belmour, who guarantees to loosen his principles. Edward's virtue is preserved by his own sound judgment, though he does not perhaps walk quite so straight a line as his old tutor, the Reverend Mr. Jarvis Jones, would like. Jones writes him affectionate and morally improving letters that provide a nice counterpoise to Lady Belmour's influence. Edward makes friends with Sukey Jones, Lady Belmour's goddaughter, formerly ruined by Lord C but now reformed and penitent. At one point Lady Belmour waggishly locks the pair in a bedroom overnight; they spend the night in conversation but pretend to have made love, thus satisfying their hostess's expectations.
After Edward goes to stay with another acquaintance, Sukey keeps him informed of the machinations of the Belmour set, a kindness especially useful after one Belmour disciple, a Lord S, kidnaps Sophia Melcombe, to whom Edward has just proposed. Sophia is locked up with Miss Freewill, who has been kidnapped by Lord S's friend Clayton, until the girls are rescued by Edward and his friend Mr. Elliot, who covets Miss Freewill. The whole kidnapping episode is unusually cheerful; for instance, the notes that the rescuers lift to the girls' window rhyme ("Be of good cheer/ Relief is near"), as do the girls' replies. In the end Edward marries Sophia and Mr. Elliot marries Miss Freewill, who is a little fast but has money.

THE SPECTRES, OR, LORD OSWALD AND LADY ROSA, INCLUDING AN ACCOUNT OF THE MARCHIONESS OF CEVETTI WHO WAS BASELY CONSIGNED TO A DUNGEON BENEATH HER CASTLE BY HER ELDEST SON, WHOSE CRUEL AVARICE PLUNGED HIM INTO THE COMMISSION OF THE WORST OF CRIMES, THAT STAIN THE ANNALS OF THE HUMAN RACE. AN ORIGINAL ROMANTIC TALE

The handsome stranger Rudolpho, who looks like their dead Lord, is sheltered from a storm by two servants. That night the castle resounds with spectral sighs, falling armor, and so on. (Background: Oswald, who had the bulk of his mother's estate and a mean, jealous, profligate brother named Francisco, was married to Lady Rosa. Shortly before the birth of his second child, Oswald died of a bowel complaint during a visit from his brother. The corpse showed signs of poison. A false will said that Rosa was not his wife and left everything to Francisco. Francisco locked Rosa in a turret and carried off the infant Malvina.) Specters of Oswald and Rosa appear to Rudolpho, telling him to "save a sister's honour and forgive a father's murder." Just in time he prevents Francisco from raping Malvina and learns that he is the true heir of the castle. Francisco even counterfeited his own mother's death; she is released from her dungeon at the age of seventy-one. Rudolpho marries Francisco's wealthy daughter.

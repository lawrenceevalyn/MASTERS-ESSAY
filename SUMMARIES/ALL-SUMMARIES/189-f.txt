ROSALIND DE TRACY

As the novel begins, the heroine, Rosalind de Tracy, is riding alone through a gathering storm and blunders into a stone quarry frequented by drunken smugglers, where she is forced to spend the night. The next day she informs a kind lady named Mrs. Smith, who puts her to bed and gives her tea, that she has no friends and at eighteen has lived quite long enough. She has been raised by Sir Raymond Cecil and his wife since her mother (no relation to the Cecils) died in childbirth. As Rosalind explains to Mrs. D'Acre, a cousin of Mrs. Smith's who takes the girl to live with her, Lady Cecil has died - she was chased, while pregnant, by a pet buffalo and subsequently died as a result of the terror - and Rosalind has been driven from the house by Sir Raymond's insistence that she marry a friend of his. She has escaped with three hundred guineas of her own and a pistol in her pocket; though she afterward admits that she was imprudent, Sir Raymond is irreconcilable.
The man he intends for her, and whom she properly fears, is Signor Mondovini; he may have been the owner of a hand that seized her arm in her room one night. She is also pursued by Mr. Johnson, son of the family's late housekeeper, who lurks unpleasantly in the park and gives her an unsolicited miniature of himself. As the novel proceeds, Mondovini's villainy and Rosalind's identity are made plain, for Mrs. D'Acre was once engaged to Mondovini, who then bore a different name. Before the projected wedding Mondovini went to bed with his fiancee's sister Charlotte, who later died at the Cecil's estate after giving birth to Rosalind, a coach accident having induced labor as she was running away. A monument is belatedly erected to Rosalind's mother ("Charlotta infelix") and Mondovini is obliged to marry one of his surviving victims, a German lunatic who has wandered into the plot from time to time.

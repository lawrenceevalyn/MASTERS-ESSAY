MANFRONE, OR, THE ONE-HANDED MONK. A ROMANCE

This is a complicated and not very skillful tale of intrigue, with lots of dungeons, passages, rescues, and assassinations. The heroine Rosalina is subjected to four kidnappings, two imprisonments, two attempted rapes, and four miscellaneous attacks. Small wonder that she sits in church reflecting on the "instability of human grandeur." Most of these attacks come from the Prince di Manfrone, alias Grimaldi, alias Romellino, whom her father wishes her to marry in discharge of a debt; a few of the attacks (but none of the rapes) are by her father himself, who has had a long career of treachery and bloodshed. Rosalina's lover is Montalto, whose father we discover to be not, as suspected, dead, but imprisoned by Rosalina's father, the Duca di Rudolpho. Rosalina has a bad time with weddings, too. A forced marriage to Manfrone is thwarted by a specter in monk's garb who refuses to perform the ceremony. A private marriage to Montalto is thwarted by an attack on the monk and the kidnapping of Rosalina. (No matter; we know later that the monk was no clergyman at all, but Manfrone. The marriage would not have been valid.) When Rudolpho finally decides to encourage the marriage, both he and Montalto are stabbed on the eve of it, the former fatally. The principal villain of the story - both fathers of the couple are fairly villainous as well - is Manfrone, later disguised as the monk of the subtitle; he lost his hand during an early rape attempt on Rosalina, when her father, not recognizing him, cut it off. The skeletal hand is later found wrapped about the dagger in Rudolpho's breast. Manfrone almost wins, for he locks Rosalina up at the end of the novel - if she does not consent to marriage at the end of a week, he will rape her - but on the climactic night Montalto rescues her just in time, and they end happily.

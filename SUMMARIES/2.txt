2: Barbauld, Anna Laetitia "SIR BERTRAND. A FRAGMENT" from
MISCELLANEOUS PIECES IN PROSE London: J. Johnson, 1792
Sir Bertrand, traveling across a heath, loses his way in the
dark. He blunders into a ruined house equipped with gliding
hghts and tolling bells. There he encounters a series of
horrid stimuli - blue flame, detachable hand, mysterious
shriek, armed figure - which culminate in his kissing a lady
who rises from a coffin. When he kisses her, the building
falls down and he finds himself in a luxurious benqueting
room with a beautiful woman and attendant nymphs. The woman
thanks him for releasing her from enchantment.

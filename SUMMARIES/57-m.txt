THE WOODLAND FAMILY, OR, THE SONS OF ERROR AND DAUGHTERS OF SIMPLICITY. A DOMESTIC TALE

Emily, Caroline, and Ethelia are sisters. Emily her father's favorite, is innocent, beautiful, unassuming, and shorter and her sisters. Mr. Arthur Sunderland sees Emily and admires her sentiments. He is so upright that the two men of fashion - Captain Frederic Mountdale, an atheist, and Mr. Alfred Clairfort, something of a fop - who pursue and plan to seduce Caroline and Ethelia respectively, think that he is a Quaker. Nevertheless Sunderland and Emily meet, lose their heads, and are ruined. Caroline and Ethelia are ruined too, for despite Emily's advise to the contrary they elope with their suitors only to find themselves mere mistresses. Sunderland promises to reclaim Emily's sisters and makes her promise to keep his name a secret until he gives her permission to tell it. An awkward promise, for while he is away Emily's pregnancy becomes noticeable to her parents; her mother dies and her father calls Emily a matricide.
Meanwhile, Caroline and Ethelia's men have gone abroad; Ethelia would like to go home but Caroline is too proud, so they go into the world and come under the protection of Mrs. Montague, who periodically bewails old sins. Ethelia, having fortuitously reunited Mrs. Montague with an old beggar woman who is her long-lost mother, goes home herself at last, coincidentally arriving just in time for her own mother's funeral. News of their mother's death softens Caroline to repentance, and Sunderland comes back to throw himself at Emily's feet and announce that he is the Marquis of Grandeville and wishes to marry her. Mountdale and Clairfort come too, penitent, and throw themselves at Caroline's and Ethelia's feet respectively. Other miscellaneous relationships are accounted for, and the three sisters marry their lovers.

ANECDOTES OF TWO WELL-KNOWN FAMILIES

Elinor reads romances and lives in the castle where her father is chaplain. A little foolish as a result of inexperience, she stands in contrast to both the sophistication of the lords and ladies and the plainspoken common sense of some of the servants. She wanders about the castle trifling with keys and cabinets, suspects that she has parents who will not own her, and fantasizes about a mysterious lover who has sent her a letter signed "Edmund." The tone of the first volume is best represented by the incident in which she discovers a miniature in a drawer - in which a servant is hunting for bile pills. The curious thing about the novel is that Elinor's view of the world proves to be essentially correct. The love letters are genuine and written by the son of the castle's new owners; he has been hiding in the house and flitting around the grounds, apparently from love of her and in the end marries her. Further, she is discovered to be the child of Baron P (who earlier planned to seduce her) and his wife. Elinor turns out well and has a happy life.

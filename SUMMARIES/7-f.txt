ELLEN WOODLEY. A NOVEL
Ellen Woodley and her brother Valentine are the intelligent and upright children of a poor rural clergyman. A wealthy farmer from the neighborhood sends Valentine to Cambridge to study for the ministry. Their richest neighbors, Sir Henry and Lady Alford, who made their fortune in India by some extremely unscrupulous means not specified, invite the Woodleys to dinner to see whether the clergyman will undertake the education of their son Edwin. The boy is vain, feeble, foppish, and inclined to be sadistic with animals, but Sir Henry endorses Woodley's stern approach to his training and Edwin so improves that Ellen falls in love with him. His family disapproves of the match for reasons of class, but Edwin stays faithful through the temptations of London, Bath, and Brighton, while Ellen pines at home. After Woodley dies, Ellen goes as a paid companion to Lady Lexington in London, but her background and temperament render her new environment uncongenial.
Edwin and Ellen are at last permitted to marry. They have five children and little money. Edwin worries about losing his ancestral home; Valentine tutors their children without pay. Then one day four-year-old William pulls a string that he sees in an India cabinet, and a secret drawer opens to reveal gold and diamonds and a letter signed Omiah. The letter is from an Indian whose family have been raped and killed by Europeans; it counsels mercy and warns against pride and luxury. Edwin and Ellen are enabled by this windfall to continue their happy and virtuous lives in the family home.

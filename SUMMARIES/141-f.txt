Sir Philip Harclay discovers when he comes home from the wars that his friend Lord Lovel is dead and that Lovel's estate is in the hands of the Lord Baron Fitz-Owen. Edmund Twyford, a cottager whom Fitz-Owen has taken into his family and educated, reminds Harclay of his lost friend and so wins his heart that, after making an unaccepted offer to adopt him, he prom1ses Edmund his protection at any time. Later Edmund comes to need it, both because the Baron's jealous nephews try to bring his name to dishonor and because he begins to have odd suspicions about his parentage. As a trial of courage, Edmund is sent by his foster father to sleep for three nights in an apartment said to be haunted, it having been the scene of some shocking murders connected to the late Lord Lovel's family. He is visited by the ghosts of his real parents, Lord and Lady Lovel, an experience that is reinforced by the conversation of a faithful old servant and a priest who wish to see Edmund come into his own, and by further if less spectacular supernatural encouragement. He discovers that he was born out of doors as his mother was fleeing from the scene of his father's murder and was brought to his foster mother by the man who found his mother's corpse. Although Edmund is distressed that his benefactor the Baron should feel some part of the disgrace attendant upon the fall of the murderous kinsman who sold him Lovel's estate, he goes to Sir Philip Harclay for aid in establishing his rights. Harclay challenges the usurper and wounds him, causing him at last to confess to the murder of Edmund's father. When Edmund returns home the doors of the castle spontaneously fly open to receive him. After he has given proper Christian burial to the bones of his parents he is married to Emma, the Fitz-Owen daughter, with whom he has for some time been in love. He settles down on the family estate and lives a long and happy life with his family and friends.

THE MILESIAN CHIEF. A ROMANCE

Armida, heroine of this piece, is unusually interesting. She is even more effortlessly talented and intelligent than the average Gothic heroine, but she is given to posing and loses her confidence when not sufficiently admired. Her great regret as the novel opens is that she does not feel love; no wonder, for she is courted chiefly by a sinister boor named Wandesford. When she and her father move from Italy to Ireland she meets a highly romantic and impoverished cousin, Connal, who is involved in revolutionary activity out of loyalty to his demented grandfather. He saves her life several times and they fall in love, which provides them with mutually satisfying scenes of misunderstanding and reconciliation. Ultimately Connal kills Wandesford, who has come to Ireland and continued to make trouble, but not until Armida has taken poison; it is slow-acting poison, for she has time to follow him, as a bride, to his political execution and die across his body.
Partway through the story a heretofore hidden wife of Armida's father arrives with a son. The son and Connal's younger brother Desmond fall in love, to Desmond's horror. But the son, Endymion, turns out to be a girl, whose real name is Ines. Ines goes mad and raves like a Shakespearean lunatic over the body of her lover, who is executed with his brother. The novel as a whole is full of specters, funeral bards, drownings, and Celtic gloom.

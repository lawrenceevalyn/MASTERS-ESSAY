THE SON OF THE STORM. A TALE

Lord John Oceanus O'Carroll, who was born aboard ship and consequently has a passion for the sea, finds a pair of orphans and adopts them. They are Henry and Laura, to whom O'Carroll has added the surname Tempest. Henry becomes a clergyman and Laura proposes to keep house for him, having refused an offer from Dalton, whose social rank exceeds hers. O'Carroll is subject to what his friends think are fits of lunacy: once a year at midnight he sees his father's ghost. The ghost turns out to be a manifestation of his guilty conscience; he broke a promise to his father and contracted a secret marriage. He discovers at last that the twins are his own children from that marriage, sent back to England by their mother. Laura accepts Dalton's proposal. The author makes much of filial piety and the misery that results from disobedience or secrecy.
O'Carroll is instrumental in solving the problems of some other people in the novel. Charles Woodville is engaged to marry Susan, daughter of the Duke of Montcastle. Though only fifteen, Susan has a serious vice, learned from an older school friend - she is addicted to gaming. Despite the sympathy of her cousin Arthur (a playful young man who is given to surreptitious charity, e.g., he adopts a baby and supports an old lady), Susan falls into bad company and accumulates heavy debts. It is Lord John O'Carroll who pays them when Susan reforms. At first she feels too corrupt to marry Woodville, but he persuades her in the end.

NETLEY ABBEY. A GOTHIC STORY

Edward de Villars goes to the crusades with Prince Edward. On the way he finds Bertram, a beautiful Sicilian orphan whom he takes under his protection. Wounded by a poisoned Saracen blade, De Villars is close to death until Bertram sucks out the poison and seems likely to die in his protector's stead. At this point Bertram confesses himself to be a woman, Isabel, who so admired De Villars at a tournament that she has followed him in disguise. After she is rather miraculously cured by some Saracen medicine, De Villars marries her.
Some years later De Villars, become a widower, retires with his grown offspring Edward and Eleanor to an estate near Netley Abbey. Hildebrand, Lord of Netley Castle, is the nephew of De Villars's old friend Sir Raymond Warren, who is said to have died with his daughter Agnes two years earlier. Young Edward, out for a walk, hears a feminine scream from the Abbey and tries to investigate but is sent away by the abbot. Later he goes back disguised as a minstrel, intoxicates the monks, and rescues the girl; she turns out to be Agnes Warren. Meanwhile, Sir Hildebrand has proved an unpleasant neighbor. His proposal to Eleanor having been turned down, he has become hostile to the De Villars family and even more so to a mysterious black knight whom Eleanor seems to love. The knight subsequently rescues her when she is kidnapped by Hildebrand and reveals himself to be young Raymond, the son of Sir Raymond Warren; he was away at war when his cousin Hildebrand locked up his sister Agnes, starved Sir Raymond to death, and usurped the title to Netley Castle. Agnes reports that Hildebrand was once frightened away from her by the ghost of her father. Hildebrand and the abbot from whom Agnes escaped kill one another. Raymond and Eleanor marry, as do Edward and Agnes.

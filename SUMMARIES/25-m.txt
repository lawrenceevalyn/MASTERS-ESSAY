THE SKELETON, OR, MYSTERIOUS DISCOVERY. A GOTHIC ROMANCE

Rotaldo and his sister Eleanora live in a castle with their aged father and are attracted to extraordinarily refined peasants, Almira and Adolphus. Rotaldo's clever and hypocritical friend Maurice tries to kill him and is himself fatally wounded, whereupon he confesses to several misdeeds: he arranged Adolphus's kidnapping and hoped to have him convicted of Rotaldo's murder; he tried to rape Eleanora (Adolphus stopped him) but wept and persuaded her to forgive him. Adolphus discovers that the castle in which he is imprisoned really belongs to him and that he and Almira are cousins. The real Baron has been murdered; his skeleton is the one that figures in the chapbook's title. The usurping Baron dies amid visions of specters clanking their "infernal chains." The couples marry and virtue triumphs.

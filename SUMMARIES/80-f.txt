THE ABBEY OF SAINT ASAPH. A NOVEL

After Sir Malcolm Douglas is killed in battle, Lady Douglas raises their children (Elinor and Lionel) by herself. She also takes in and educates Jennet Aprieu, whom she found in a cottage. Jennet and Lionel fall in love at once, though they are only children. Later Lionel brings home a Harrow friend, Clement Montague, who forms an attachment to Elinor. Clement's younger brother Henry also loves her but defers to his elders. Clement and Elinor marry and have a daughter; suddenly Clement announces that he was twenty, not twenty-one, when they married, so the union is not legal. Further, he declines to be married again, saying that this way it will be eas1er if they tire of each other. Elinor leaves him and goes into service, only to discover that her mistress is, in a different sense, Clement's mistress. Lionel feels that Elinor has dishonored him. He also stabs a man whom he finds with Jennet, though Jennet in fact has not permitted anything untoward to happen.
Jennet's family has inherited a little farm near the Abbey of St. Asaph, where the ostensibly supernatural goings-on of the story take place. On one occasion a ghost in the abbey ruins wraps Jennet in its long arms and she faints. On another occasion she is locked in a vault with open coffins and sees a skeleton with glowing eyes shake itself. (Uncanny phenomena are explained at the end; e.g., there was a rat inside the skull.) Jennet discovers in the midst of her wedding to Lionel that her real father is Sir Edred, who has survived fraternal usurpation and attempted murder. Elinor has been imprisoned for debt at Clement's instigation, but they are reconciled at last and Clement is revealed to have been of age after all. Clement's brother Henry marries a suitable young woman by whom Jennet was earlier employed.

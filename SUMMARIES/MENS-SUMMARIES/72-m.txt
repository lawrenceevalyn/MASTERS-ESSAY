THE RED BARN. A TALE, FOUNDED ON FACT

The Red Barn is a fictitious account, with appendixes, of the Polstead murder, which was first reported in the London Times of April 22, 1828. A young woman named Maria Marten, having been promised marriage by William Corder, whose child she had already borne, went in male attire to meet him at the Red Barn. After some time during which her parents received letters penned exclusively by their purported son-in-law, her mother dreamed that the girl was dead and buried in the barn. When the floorboards were taken up the family discovered Maria's decomposing body. Corder, when apprehended, was running a female boarding school with a wife for whom he had advertised in the papers; he was convicted and hanged.
Huish says that in his novel he proposes to exhibit the fatal results of loose habits. The names are thinly disguised - Marten is given its alternative spelling, Martin, and William Corder becomes William Barnard. The bulk of the novel takes place before the murder and deals with the principal characters' previous relationships, but Barnard is apprehended before the end.

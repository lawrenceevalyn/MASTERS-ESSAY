THE HAUNTED CASTLE. A NORMAN ROMANCE

Ignatius, fighting for King Philip, is resting in the woods one day when he sees a girl and her elderly male companion being attacked. He rescues them and later meets the man, Reginald Lace, again; Lace offers Ignatius a chance to marry the girl, his niece Adelais. Ignatius likes this suggestion but wants first to solve the mystery of a particular haunted castle that a hermit has told him was formerly owned by Manfredi, inherited by Manfredi's brother, and subsequently sold. As Adelais is said to be Manfredi's orphaned daughter, the haunting is of some interest to the hero's prospective in-laws. Ignatius's own background is mysterious (found as an infant on the bosom of a dead woman, he was adopted by the bachelor Du Pin and later ejected by Du Pin's heir Du Dorf), and he begins to fear, during the course of his discoveries, that Manfredi was his father too and that Adelais is consequently his sister. The exploration of the castle involves sliding doors, subterranean passages, a bloody ghost, a murder weapon, and at last a tablet identifying Manfredi's murderer as his brother Hendred. Although Ignatius is now in line to inherit Du Pin's estate, Du Dorf having been killed in a duel, he is upset about his relationship with (and perhaps to) Adelais and decides to go into a monastery as Du Pin had originally wanted him to do. At the monastery he finds the murderer Hendred, now the penitent Friar Francis, and learns that there was some baby-swapping at the time of Manfredi's death: Adelais is not his sister, but the daughter of Reginald Lace and Lace's murdered wife Antoinette.

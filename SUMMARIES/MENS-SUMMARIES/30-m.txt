ETHELWINA, OR, THE HOUSE OF FITZ-AUBURNE. A ROMANCE OF FORMER TIMES

Two orphans, Augustine and Emma, are taken in by the Fitz-Auburnes. Augustine and his foster sister Ethelwina fall in love. Godfred, the father, is lost in a military expedition, and little Arthur Fitz-Auburne is kidnapped. The obvious villain is Cousin Leopold Lord St. Ivor. Emma is devoted to Arthur's memory, but Leopold desires her. The ghost of Ethelwina's murdered father pursues Leopold and makes Ethelwina swear vengeance. She keeps the murder weapon, a switchblade dagger, with which she confronts Leopold. He falls into fever and madness but first shuts her up in a dungeon where she is comforted by the ghost of her mother. She finds Arthur in an adjacent dungeon; he says that his father used to be there as well. Ethelwina feels that she is the cause of all the trouble because Leopold lusts after her, but the ghost tells her not to worry. After throwing herself between Arthur and an executioner's ax, Ethelwina finally has to save him by promising herself to Leopold. (She plans to back out and apologizes to God for her perjury.) She and Arthur escape, fleeing Leopold and the voice of a putrid corpse which demands burial. On the way home they find and rescue imprisoned Augustine, but then Leopold captures Emma, so the others go back to rescue her and kill him. The young people bury the insistent corpse, marry each other, and are happy.

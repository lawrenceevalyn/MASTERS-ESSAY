SALATHIEL. A STORY OF THE PAST, THE PRESENT, AND THE FUTURE

Salathiel covers only the beginning of Salathiel's career as Wandering Jew, from the Crucifixion to the Destruction of Jerusalem. Salathiel explains that the latter event marks the end of his life as a family man and the beginning of his real wandering. Many of the events that take place in the early years are political, since Salathiel is a Jewish Nationalist and a leader of rebellion. Other incidents are more recognizably Gothic. More than once Salathiel or members of his family fall into pits, holes, or dungeons. He has fantasies of nautical isolation like the Ancient Mariner's and suffers real shipwreck as well. Various members of his family are kidnapped and recovered. Once he supposes himself to be buried alive eternally. Some of his family become Christian and he defends a previously despised son-in-law from Nero's lions. Until the fall of Jerusalem, Salathiel manages in some degree to overlook the reality of his Wanderer curse, though he is pursued by rumors that he has had some kind of accursed dealings with the supernatural. However, when the Temple falls on him and he thinks that death will extricate him from Christ's curse, he once again hears the words "Tarry thou till I come" and is miraculously extricated from the ruins; then he knows that his wandering is inescapable. He speaks of his later years only briefly, as when he mentions paying homage to Luther, watching Ra- phael paint, and so on.

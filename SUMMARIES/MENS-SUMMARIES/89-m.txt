MYSTERY. A NOVEL

Charles Melford is in love with Margaretta, but both their fathers die before he can get permission to marry her. Leaving her in the friendly care of a Mrs. Wallace, he travels to Italy. There he meets the Marchese di Marvaldi, with his wife Laura and his daughter Paulina. The Marchese offers Charles his daughter, but Charles refuses because of Margaretta. Paulina's mother is a greater hazard to his fidelity; Laura pursues and seduces him and later follows him out of town, asserting that she has left her husband forever. She disappears for a while, but he discovers her lying on a street in Rome and takes her back to England, where he finds that Margaretta and Mrs. Wallace's son are in love. Distressed and wishing not to get in Margaretta's way, he marries Laura, who has by that time announced that her husband is dead. Immediately Laura takes him back to Venice, and there is the Marchese with his wife Laura and his daughter Paulina - a happy but disconcerting family group. So who is the woman Charles has married? Laura's twin sister Antonia, as it turns out.
Years earlier, Antonia explains, the Marchese, confused about the twins, briefly and accidentally courted Antonia, who was so incensed at his marriage to Laura instead of to her that she followed them to the altar and there vowed to take revenge on her sister and brother-in-law. This she has done by disgracing the family with a bastard child and by marrying someone as eligible as the Marchese (i.e., Charles); having made these revelations she completes her revenge by stabbing the Marchese, after which she poisons herself. Charles discovers that Margaretta is Antonia's illegitimate daughter by the father of one of his friends. Having been married to her mother, Charles would certainly be forbidden by the church to marry Margaretta, so he resigns himself to her marrying the Wallace boy.

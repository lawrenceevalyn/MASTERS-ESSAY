TALES OF TERROR. WITH AN INTRODUCTORY DIALOGUE

Including the introductory dialogue there are twenty tales, all of them in verse. An oddly assorted group, they include a comic poem about the ghost of a twenty-two-year-old cook who returns to haunt her faithless lover, and a version of Little Red Riding Hood, as well as more predictably heroic, sentimental, and quasi-mythic poems. The tales include such excitements as poisoning, fratricide, shape-changing, seduction, corpse-kissing, shipwreck, suicide, exorcism, remorse, and attempted infanticide. The disconcerting moral at the end of "The Wolf-King; or Little Red-riding-hood" typifies the crudity and grimness of many of the verses - "Get not to bed with grandmummie, / Lest she a ravenous wolf should be!" (See Montague Summers's A Gothic Bibliography for a detailed discussion of why the attribution to Lewis must be false.)

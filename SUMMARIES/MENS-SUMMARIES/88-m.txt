THE MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, OR, THE DAYS OF QUEEN BESS. A ROMANCE

William de Mowbray's daughter Rosalind (whose name was chosen by her godmother Queen Elizabeth I) has suffered from parental tyranny. Though her dying mother made De Mowbray promise that Rosalind could marry according to her heart, he refused to sanction her preference for Edward, a peasant he with whom she had grown up, and tried to make her marry Lord Rufus. Further, he had Edward imprisoned in Flanders, but Rosalind was secretly married to Edward already and was pregnant. Her father spirited the baby away, told her that it had died, and hoped that it had - at the hands of his confederate.
Rosalind is living with her father as the novel begins; he is warden of the borders and is about to be attacked by moss-troopers, led by Allanrod. He is warned of the attack by Donald, a former moss-trooper whose sister Allanrod has raped and whose father he has killed. Allanrod captures De Mowbray and wishes to marry Rosalind. A forced wedd1ng is prevented, however, by the advent of Edward, in black armor, who has escaped from imprisonment. (The story of his escape occupies several chapters.) Lord Rufus has offered earlier to save Rosalind from marriage to Allanrod, but this shows extraordinary duplicity, for we discover at the end of the novel that Rufus and Allanrod are the same man. He is also the real father of Edward and kills himself after these revelations of identity. The reader has earlier been exposed to a manuscript account of his villainy, written by Eloise, who turns out to have been Edward's mother. A brother is identified as well. Further, Edward and Rosalind discover that their baby is not after all dead and recover it.

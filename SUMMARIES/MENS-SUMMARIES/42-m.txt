KLOSTERHEIM, OR, THE MASQUE

Klosterheim is a German city run by an unscrupulous Land-grave and a pack of villainous soldiers. The caravan in which Paulina, the heroine, is traveling, is one of many attacked outside the city walls. Paulina loves Maximilian, who is off on a mysterious mission. While she is in Klosterheim some terrifying things happen. An unknown man who calls himself "The Masque" takes such thorough control of the city that he can cause up to a dozen people at a time to disappear without a trace. He leaves warnings and notes, and nobody feels safe even at home. The Landgrave traps him once but emerges so shaken from a conference with him that he faints. Meanwhile, Paulina is being pursued by people who want a trunk of mysterious and important papers with which she has been entrusted. She is duped away from a convent haven and imprisoned, but the Landgrave's daughter helps her escape. The Masque has threatened to hold a trial of the Landgrave on a certain date and on that night reveals that he is Maximilian and the true heir of the late Prince, whom the Landgrave murdered. Wishing to make a counterrevelation, the wicked Landgrave unveils the corpse of a young woman which so far as he knows is Paulina; it is instead the body of his own much beloved daughter, whom the guards shot by mistake. The Landgrave repents and dies, and Maximilian and Paulina marry.

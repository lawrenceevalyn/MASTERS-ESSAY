MUNSTER ABBEY. A ROMANCE, INTERSPERSED WITH REFLECTIONS ON VIRTUE AND MORALITY

Mr. Belford, who owns Munster Abbey on the River Ex, marries Miss Melvilie. They have a daughter Aurelia. Mr. Belford has also an apparently incorrigible brother Charles, who was born during a terrible storm. Despite Belford's support and encouragement, Charles has twice robbed his brother's house, once even stealing a diamond-studded miniature of their mother which he later penitently returned. Charles is about the only dark spot in a peculiarly sunny novel, and by the time Aurelia is grown the family discovers that Charles has a good job at Leghorn and is virtuous and prosperous. Aurelia turns down several eligible suitors but falls in love (at first sight) with Lord Altamont, and he with her. At one point after their engagement Aurelia goes with her family to meet Altamont at Dover and, when he does not arrive, becomes ill from fear that he may be dead; but he is mereiy delayed. Altamont and Aurelia marry and have children, Charles marries a Miss Draper, Belford founds two academies, and everything turns out well.

THE INVISIBLE ENEMY, OR, THE MINES OF WIELITSKA. A POLISH LEGENDARY ROMANCE

The interest in this novel lies less in the events than in the skill and anonymity of the villain who masterminds them. Leopold is raised as a peasant because his title and property have been usurped by Lafrance. He recovers his title and marries Rhodiska, whom Lafrance also desires. Their married life is marked by extraordinary persecutions. A letter tells Leopold that Rhodiska is unfaithful. They find a body hidden in a trunk in their house. Their crops are burned and their animals killed. Their son is kidnapped. They go into exile, whereupon they stop hearing from their friends, at least one of whom turns out to be in a dungeon. They do receive a letter from their persecutor, however, saying that all their friends are false. When they recover their son, their daughter is kidnapped. At last they are all bundled into a coach and taken to Lafrance, the perpetrator. (The bandits who convey them to Lafrance try to create the illusion of a ferry by paddling in containers of water and singing.) Lafrance tries to seduce both Rhodiska and her daughter by offering to release the men in their family, but they resist. At last the villain is defeated and the novel ends in appropriate weddings and executions.

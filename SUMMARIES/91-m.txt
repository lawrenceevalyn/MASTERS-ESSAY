THE INVISIBLE ENEMY, OR, THE MINES OF WIELITSKA. A POLISH LEGENDARY ROMANCE

The interest in this novel lies less in the events than in the skill and anonymity of the villain who masterminds them. Leopold is raised as a peasant because his title and proper- ty have been usurped by Lafrance. He recovers his.title ~nd marries Rhodiska, whom Lafrance also desires. Thelr marrled life is marked by extraordinary persecutions. A letter
tells Leopold that Rhodiska is unfaithful. They find a body hidden in a trunk in their house. Their crops are burned and their animals killed. Their son is kidnapped. They go
into exile whereupon they stop hearing from their friends, at least o~e of whom turns out to be in a dungeon. They do receive a letter from their persecutor, however, saying that all their friends are false. When they recover their son,
their daughter is kidnapped. At last they are all bundled into a coach and taken to Lafrance, the perpetrator. (The bandits who convey them to Lafrance try to create the il~uÂ­ sion of a ferry by paddling in containers of water and slng- ing.) Lafrance tries to seduce both Rhodiska and her daugh- ter by offering to release the men in their family, but they resist. At last the villain is defeated and the novel ends
in appropriate weddings and executions.

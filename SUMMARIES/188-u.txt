THE THREE GHOSTS OF THE FOREST. A TALE OF HORROR. AN ORIGINAL ROMANCE.

The place is Orleans, the year 1640. The Baron Arnhalt has three daughters; if any one of them should die unmarried, her share of the estate will go to her cousin Orlando, Count Brissac, who Arnhalt hopes will marry one of the girls. Isabella, who is noble and amiable, is eighteen when her father dies. Octavia, the next eldest, is handsome and witty but wicked and designing. Adela, the youngest daughter, who is boarding in a convent, resembles Isabella in character. Orlando and Octavia are friends, which means in effect that Orlando knows her character too well to marry her; he prefers Isabella. Octavia marries Honoria, whom she has stolen from Isabella, and later (we discover at the end) persuades Orlando to have him murdered. Widowed, she moves back in with Isabella, whom she shortly persuades Orlando
to abduct. After Orlando's death-or-dishonor threats, even the one he makes while wearing a Tartar disguise, fail to move Isabella, who prefers death, Orlando is rather sorry about the abduction but feels that he must keep her incarcerated. At that point Adela complicates matters by coming home from the convent and winning Orlando's affections. Terrified that Octavia may tell Adela that he is a villain (and, as he later says, hearing that she plans to poison him), Orlando arranges to carry Octavia to a convent; one of the hired ruffians stabs her, on his own initiative, and is informed by Honorio's ghost that he died by the same sword. On that same night, Isabella escapes from imprisonment only to be killed by a robber before she has gone very far. People claim to see three ghosts in the forest, Isabella's and Honorio's together, and Octavia's skulking along separately. Isabella's ghost leads Adela aside one evening and makes what is for spectral tradition an unusually long speech, warning her to shun Orlando. Orlando dies soon, making a deathbed confession to Adela, who afterward becomes a nun.

JULIA. A NOVEL, INTERSPERSED WITH SOME POETICAL PIECES

The purpose of this novel, says the preface, is "to trace the danger arising from the uncontrouled [sic] indulgence of strong affections," calamitous even to the virtuous, for "though we do not become the slaves of vice, we must yield ourselves the victims of sorrow." The plot is complicated by the presence of three Mr. Seymours and two Miss Cliffords. The youngest and best of the three Seymour brothers is Frederick, who is upright, strong, and intelligent. Though engaged to marry Charlotte Clifford, he falls in love with her cousin Julia Clifford. Julia loves him too, but they try to stifle their attraction and the contracted marriage takes place. Frederick suppresses his passion less successfully than Julia does hers. We see him treasuring her lost glove, for instance, and telling her at intervals how he feels, which always offends her sense of propriety. Gossip about Frederick and Julia at last reaches even Charlotte's ears, after which Frederick becomes increasingly lovelorn, Charlotte increasingly cold to her rival, and Julia increasingly wretched. After a bit the two women are reconciled, and Frederick seems to like Charlotte the better for her tolerance. Charlotte and Frederick produce a son. Frederick at last contracts a fever and dies, pleading to be buried in the same grave as Julia; Julia never marries, devoting herself to Charlotte and Frederick's child. The author observes that, but for Julia's unconquered weakness for Frederick, she would have been "above the common lot, fortunate and happy."

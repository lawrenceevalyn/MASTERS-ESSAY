THE HISTORY OF MISS MEREDITH. A NOVEL

Harriet Meredith does not believe in love, so is willing to marry Authur Williams, the son of an old friend, to please her father. Emma Montague, her correspondent, is in love with George Oldham, a libertine, and is prepared to lose Â£25,000 by marrying without the consent of her parents. Each girl fruitlessly tried to persuade the other out of her folly. Emma's story is simple enough: her husband takes all the money he can get and leaves her, after which she goes abroad to avoid the humiliation of going home; her mother pines and dies, and Emily at last comes penitently back. Harriet and the Earl of Bleville are greatly attracted to one another, but too late, for she has promised herself to Williams. (Both Williams and Bleville write to and confide in their friend Sir Edward Stanley.) Harriet's marriage is not easy: Williams becomes jealous and difficult resenting even Stanley; a villainous Lord Richmore contributes to his suspicions. At last Williams dies of a fever. Stanley, who has married Emily's sister Isabella tells Bleville to come home and marry Harriet, which he does.

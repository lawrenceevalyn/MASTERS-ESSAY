CONTRAST

There are two pairings in this novel, one of which ends happily, one unhappily. Horatio de Montville and Adelaide have a happy ending, after some tensions and complications, for Adelaide is both the girl Horatio's godfather wishes him to marry and the nameless girl whom he discovered confined to a crumbling villa and instantly loved. For Helena and
Mountflorence, whose father and mother, respectively, have just married each other and are now matchmaking for their children, a promising beginning comes to no good. Helena marries Mountflorence reluctantly, though she appears to love him; the wedding is full of ill omens - the bride faints, the bridegroom loses the ring and discovers it outside on a tombstone. The problem is that Helena was previously married to an unpleasant man whom she believed to be drowned in a shipwreck, along with all witnesses to their marriage. Having unexpectedly seen him alive, she runs away, forgetting to leave the explanatory note that she has written to Mountflorence. Although her first husband really does die subsequently, Helena is ignorant of this and dies too. Mountflorence is grief stricken and has nothing to look forward to except the Resurrection.

RINGROVE, OR, OLD FASHIONED NOTIONS

Emma Herbert is not wanted at home. She has been spoiled since her mother died and has acquired a stepmother who dislikes her. Her debut was not a great success, nor is she appreciably domestic. So her family sends her to Ringrove, her grandmother's house, to get her out of the way. Mrs. Loveday, the grandmother, is pro-feminist and against husband-hunting, forced charity, misanthropy, and joyless lives. She is fond of giving moral lectures. Emma reluctantly makes friends with Ellen, a wholesome and right-thinking girl who lives with Mrs. Loveday. When Emma finds herself infatuated with Frederick, the midshipman whom Ellen loves, Ellen tries to step aside. Realizing this, Emma begins to appreciate Ellen and better evaluate her own emotions. Proposed to by a solid citizen named Dick Smith, Emma has a happy and rational marriage. Ellen and her midshipman marry, and both survive a rumor that he is lost at sea.

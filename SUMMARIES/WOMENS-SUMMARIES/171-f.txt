THE ORPHAN OF THE RHINE. A ROMANCE

Julie has a son, Enrico, by the Marchese de Montferrat, who pretended to marry her. Later the Marchese gives her an additional infant (someone else's) to raise. The child is Laurette; she and Enrico like each other very much. When the children are grown, Julie moves to new quarters and makes friends with an abbess who tells her about a Sister Cecilia, whom Julie suspects to be Laurette's mother. But Cecilia dies, denying that she ever had a daughter, and Julie is beginning to fear that Enrico and Laurette, who are falling in love, are half-brother and sister.
A man named LaRoque, whom Julie frees from a tower where he is imprisoned and guarded by Montferrat's servant Paoli, tells a story of stabbing his wife accidentally when he intended to stab his mistress. Discovering that Julie had a hand in LaRoque's escape, Montferrat has her kidnapped. Meanwhile a white-robed monk gives Laurette a miniature supposed to be of her real mother and promises to reveal the secret of her birth. The monk also says "Beware the Marchese de Montferrat" - good advice, for Montferrat later proposes to Laurette, is turned down, and kidnaps her. Enrico, home on leave, has gone to hunt for his mother and comes back to find Laurette missing as well. Fortunately LaRoque helps him to recover her and tells him that his mother is safe too. LaRoque also informs him that he is the lawful child of the Marchese, for the marriage was valid after all. When Laurette's origins are clarified, it appears that she is not Enrico's sister, so the couple are free to marry.

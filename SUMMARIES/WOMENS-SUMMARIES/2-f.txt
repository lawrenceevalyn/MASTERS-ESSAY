SIR BERTRAND. A FRAGMENT

Sir Bertrand, traveling across a heath, loses his way in the dark. He blunders into a ruined house equipped with gliding lights and tolling bells. There he encounters a series of horrid stimuli - blue flame, detachable hand, mysterious shriek, armed figure - which culminate in his kissing a lady who rises from a coffin. When he kisses her, the building falls down and he finds himself in a luxurious banqueting room with a beautiful woman and attendant nymphs. The woman thanks him for releasing her from enchantment.

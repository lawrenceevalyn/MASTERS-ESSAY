THE HIGHEST CASTLE AND THE LOWEST CAVE, OR, EVENTS OF THE DAYS WHICH ARE GONE

This novel, which begins rather innocently with the passionate Matilda de Montgomery giving her consent to Richard de St. Evremond, winner of a tournament, and which has much to say about the evils of war, settles down by the third volume into remarkably lurid villainy. Matilda, married to St. Evremond and mother of a son, is shaken by the unexpected birth of a little brother, Jocelyn. Jocelyn's arrival means that she and her son will not inherit and causes her father to lose all interest in her. Her bitterness and jealousy, which lead her to villainy, are perceived by the other villain of the story, the confessor Austin, whose own life has been embittered by the discovery of his aristocratic origins and by his perpetual scheming to regain what he sees as his property. Austin encourages her most sinister desires - he will blackmail her later - until he has persuaded her to kill her baby brother. She first makes friends with the infant lest it cry when she carries it off, then drugs the nurse and with Austin carries the child to a particularly dark and loathsome cave on the premises. There they leave it, Austin having pushed her hand down on its chest to crush it. After this Matilda is melancholy and stupified with guilt. At last she falls into lunacy and dies. Austin's punishment is to be isolated in a monastery and kept on the verge of starvation.

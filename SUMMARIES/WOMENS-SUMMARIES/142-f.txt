THE SCHOOL FOR WIDOWS. A NOVEL

Mrs. Strictland hears that her old friend Mrs. Darnford, whom she is trying to find, is living in a haunted house and taking care of a madwoman. The two widows correspond; their letters, describing the difficulties of their marriages, supply the greater part of the narrative. Mrs. Darnford's husband was affectionate but dissolute. In debt as a result of profligate living, he tried to sell Mrs. Darnford (or rent her, perhaps) to his friend Lord A, and in retaliation she left him. After his death she worked for a while as a governess and then started a little school; everywhere she went she left people influenced for the better, girls set up in honest trade, and so on.
Captain Maurice, the father of one of Mrs. Darnford's pupils, asked her to take care of mad Isabella during his absence. Isabella and her late husband Don Antonio escaped together from monastic life and were close friends with Captain Maurice. Don Antonio after a time became strange and withdrawn and at last died of a beating administered by Maurice in self-defense; Isabella has been mad since his death. She buttons his clothes over a chair and talks to them. Maurice loves her but has not taken sexual advantage of her dependence.
Mrs. Strictland's husband was the opposite of Mrs. Darnford's- he had no vices except avarice but was exceedingly disagreeable. After their wedding he took her home to Woodlands, a purportedly haunted old house where she felt imprisoned. The Strictlands finally achieved a kind of marital truce, despite Mrs. Strictland's patronage of the child Reginald Henry Marney, said to be the rightful heir to Woodlands, whom her husband beat for begging at the door. Mr. Strictland's will is fairly equitable but raises obstacles to her remarrying.
At the end of the novel an uncle arrives to provide for Reginald, Isabella gets a new keeper, and the principal characters still living retire happily to Woodlands, which no longer feels gloomy.

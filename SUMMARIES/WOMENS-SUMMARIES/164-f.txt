MATHILDA

Mathilda, whose mother died giving her birth, is brought up by an unloving aunt and dreams constantly of her father's return. When he comes back their relationship is briefly idyllic, but soon he becomes negative and withdrawn and repulses her caresses. Bent on getting at the source of his trouble so that she can comfort him, she pushes him into confessing that he desires her. She is terrified and appalled and dreams of trying to catch him as he leaps over a precipice. Her dream is precognitive, except that she arrives too late even to try. After her father's suicide she breaks down and, when she recovers a bit, goes off to be a hermitress. Her only companion in sorrow is Woodville the poet, and even he refuses to make a suicide pact with her. At last she gets lost, sleeps out in the rain, and develops consumption. She is happy in the contemplation of death, for she expects to be reunited with her father.

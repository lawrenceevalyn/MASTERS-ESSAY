MARGIANA, OR, WIDDRINGTON TOWER. A TALE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY

Margiana Widdrington's father is a supporter of Richard II but tells his daughters to attend Henry IV's court. Margiana finds Ethelred Winburne Lord Delancey engaging but does not return his love. The excitement begins when the girls stay with their uncle Bertram. Margiana reads manuscript romances and hears shrieks in the night; the next day her uncle unconvincingly explains that he was unwell and cannot bear pain. They meet Ethelred's younger sister Arlette, who is fond of dressing up in armor and playing imaginative games.
Later in the novel Margiana disappears and is thought to have been murdered. She is discovered half-starved and imprisoned with her faithful dog. Since Ethelred has believed her dead he has married her sister Genevieve. Genevieve dies of shock at a false rumor that Ethelred is dead, but even though Margiana now loves him he cannot marry her, for he is her brother-in-law. This problem is resolved when papers reveal Genevieve to be the child, not of Margiana's father and his mistress, as he thought, but of the mistress and a page. Ethelred and Margiana marry. Ethelred's father is shown to have committed fratricide; he has killed himself as well. There are many other complications - an aunt tortured by thumbscrews, Arlette's flight to the North Pole which leads to her reunion with her mother, and so on, but everything comes right in the end.

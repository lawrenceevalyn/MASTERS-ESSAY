FALKNER. A NOVEL

John Falkner is raised after his mother's death by a female relative who has a daughter named Alithea. Although the two young people have an idyllic juvenile romance, the girl later marries while Falkner is in India. When he comes home he plans an elopement to which she consents, but her child is accidentally left behind and she has convulsions and drowns before Falkner can take her home to it. He buries her secretly and for the rest of his life feels like a murderer. The novel takes place during the years of his guilt-stricken wanderings. He adopts Elizabeth, an orphaned child who keeps him from committing suicide on her mother's grave, taking her partly out of gratitude and partly because her mother is discovered to have been a friend of Alithea's. Their paths cross several times with those of the Nevilles, the husband and son of Alithea who are hunting for her abductor and planning revenge. Elizabeth falls in love with the Neville boy, Gerard, and vice versa, which is awkward. Finally Falkner confesses his identity to the Nevilles and is prosecuted after the body has been exhumed, but the postilion who helped with the elopement is persuaded to testify to the accidental nature of Alithea's death, and Falkner goes free. He is never free from guilt, however, and never forgives himself. Despite some doubts about the propriety of their union, Elizabeth and Gerard marry and are happy with the decision.

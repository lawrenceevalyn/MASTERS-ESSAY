WHO'S THE MURDERER? OR, THE MYSTERY OF THE FOREST

Sleath's title is a little misleading, for the plot is principally concerned with the identification of Cecilia, the heroine, as sufficiently upper-class to marry the Marchese de Varano's son. As a small child Cecilia passed through a number of hands before coming to Madame Villeneuve and her brother De Sevignac, who raised her, so her origins are difficult to trace. However, she fortuitously encounters her half-brother, who recognizes a parental miniature in her possession in time to establish her identity for Varano. The Varano family seems not to be put off by the particulars of her background: her father married an escaped nun and was burned by the Inquisition; Cecilia's mother sent her away in her infancy because her old convent wanted the baby as a penitential offering. Horrid touches include a body in a sack, nightmares of blood and death, and the tortures of the Inquisition.

SIR ETHELBERT, OR, THE DISSOLUTION OF MONASTERIES. A ROMANCE

The story begins in 1516. It is St. John the Baptist's Eve and people are celebrating with bonfires near Dunraven Priory in Wales. Suddenly they hear a tolling bell and see a ship burning with blue flames and a small boat escaping the conflagration apparently unmanned. The priest Kenrick Blundel who is devoted to truth, sees through the supernatural appearance of these events to discover their natural causes, and what is more important to the plot, he rescues Lord St. Oswald, who is heir to the local castle. Lord St. Oswald's daughter, Lady Adela de Mandeville, marries De Rhone, and their daughter, Lady Mary, is the heroine of the novel. She is a delightful little girl, sturdy and genial and not at all ladylike, but her father seems not to love her. When Adela apparently drowns (in fact she is forcefully detained by some Ursuline nuns who like her fancy work), De Rhone brings home his mistress Rosamond, who takes over supervision of the nursery, and their illegitimate daughter Rhona, a crafty and beautiful little girl whom Lady Mary learns to hate. The foundling Algernon Fitzrivers is the other most important character. Because of the obscurity of his origins, Rhona withholds from him any affection, but Mary and Algernon help each other out of various dangers and fall in love. Their romance is imperiled by the news that Algernon is the true heir to Adela's honors and estates, for Mary feels that she cannot conscientiously marry Algernon and assume the position wrested from her mother. When the final mysteries are unraveled they are discovered to have included baby swapping as well as assassination and other villainy, and Algernon is able to marry Lady Mary after all. Rhona marries too and emigrates to the continent.

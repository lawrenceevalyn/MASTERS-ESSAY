THE EAST INDIAN, OR, CLIFFORD PRIORY

Elinor Clifford lives with her father and widowed aunt and has a moderately active social life. She likes Sir Clement Darnley, who is restricted by parental will from marrying before his twenty-fifth birthday; in the meantime (two years) she is instructed to be nice to her father's friend Lord Felgrove, who has proposed. Ultimately Felgrove proves to be a villain, ruining her father and causing his death. It is after this, when Elinor moves in with her great-uncle Sir Gervas, that her adventures begin. Her room in Clifford Priory has dark purple hangings on the bed and reminds her of The Mysteries of Udolpho. Gervas is a nice old man, despite some parsimony and pettishness, and treats his niece kindly. But disturbing things happen. For instance, the coffin of Elinor's father disappears and is discovered to have fallen through a rotten trapdoor into a vault. Elinor reads the manuscript tale of a dead uncle's troubles and imagines that she sees his ghost. Her worst experience occurs when she blunders into the wrong room and seems to see two unburied bodies in "her" bed. Gervas explains that they are his wife and child, whom he is saving out of sentiment so that all three of them can be buried together when he dies. The figures turn out to be waxwork - the real bodies are in crimson velvet coffins underneath them - but Elinor has a bad moment when Sir Gervas tells her to pull down the coverlid. At last the old man dies, and after some alarms Sir Clement Darnley comes back and marries her.

MIDNIGHT WEDDINGS. A NOVEL

Edmund Browning, son of a squire who married his cook, is mean, stubborn, and stupid, but does well as a cadet in the East Indies and comes home a nabob at thirty. Edmund and his crochety spinster sister Penelope lord it over their brother Thomas, who rose to secretary and married (gossip says) a formerly kept woman. Edmund marries Penelope's paid companion, is made Baron Vilmore, and has a son who is clever, proud, handsome, and essentially noble, though not from principle. On the eve of his son's parentally arranged marriage to Leonora M'Dougall, Edmund falls ill and, dying, confesses that his son is not really his. His own son died of a tantrum at an early age and he kidnapped this boy, whose real name is Octavius, as a replacement. So Octavius, whose fiancee breaks the engagement upon hearing Edmund's confession, finds himself out in the world hunting for his real parents. A French Minister sees his birthmark and afer some mysterious arrangements introduces him to his real father; Octavius is the illegitimate son of Louis XV and is made Duke de Valentinois.
Leonora is sorry now that she broke her engagement. At a masked ball that Octavius also attends she elopes with and marries someone whom she supposes to be him. (This seems to be one of the midnight weddings of the title; I cannot account for the plural.) The groom is really a crafty valet; Leonora and her family are furious and blame the episode on Octavius, whom they consequently arranged to have pushed out of a boat in hopes of drowning him. He is rescued by fishermen and lives to discover that his mother is Lady Trelawney, to learn that a girl to whom he has been attracted is really his sister, and to be married by the king's arrangement to a fascinating woman whom he met at the masked ball which undid Leonora.

THE DANISH MASSACRE. AN HIS- TORICAL FACT

Edrie Streou, the wicked and treacherous Duke of Mercia, is dying in a cave as the novel begins. He is discovered by a man whose son and grandson he has killed, and who, lost in the fog, happens to hear his groans. The Duke leaves some papers which provide the material of the story, though it is not told from his point of view. King Ethelred is somehow controlled by Mercia, who is behind the scheme of slaughtering Danes in quantity. Princess Elfrida at one point reluctantly consents to marry Mercia on the condition that he stop persecuting a Danish family (that of her friend Athela) to whom he is particularly cruel. Athela's agony is principal to the story and reaches a peak when she goes to Ethelred about her husband's death, and Mercia murders her children in front of both her and the king. Finally the only important survivor in this grim novel is Elfrida, who is consoled for her troubles by finding a good man and making a happy marriage.

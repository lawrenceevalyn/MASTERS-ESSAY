THE LIBERTINE

Gabrielle Montmorency, though raised in a Swiss cottage "free from contagion of society" by her misanthropic ex-gamester father, is secuced and impregnated by the Count Angelo D'Albani, who stopped for shelter and prolonged his stay. When her father learns of her disgrace he dies (literally, judging by the symptoms) of a broken heart; his death induces Gabrielle's labor and the child Agnes is born. Gabrielle finds Angelo and, in male attire, takes a job as his page; she plans to acquire child support. Both Angelo and his mistress Oriano rather fancy the page. Oriano tries to kill Angelo, first with poison, then by hired assassins, but Gabrielle foils both attempts. When, on the second occasion she is wounded, her identity is revealed and Angelo takes her to live with him again. Still unmarried, they produce a son, Felix. Angelo later runs off with Oriano's half-sister Paulina.

Millborough, an unscrupulous female domestic who knows the family secret, lures already spoiled Felix from his mother and corrupts him, and has a blatant affair with his father, whom she finally deserts after he is ruined by gaming. Gabrielle takes Angelo in again, out of pity. They starve until a friend leaves Angelo the money he won from him; at last they marry. Soon after, Gabrielle herself dies of heartbreak. Having promised to hunt for their children, Angelo goes to Paris, where he finds his daughter (recognition via miniature) as he is about to seduce her. Learning that she has already been deflowered, he puts her in a convent to repent and, in the midst of an argument about which of them has been more cruel to her, stabs her lover before her eyes. Escaped to England, he ignorantly helps to apprehend and sentence to death a highwayman who turns out to be Felix. Angelo finds that he cannot pray and commits suicide. Dacre points out that fathers' sins are visited upon children.

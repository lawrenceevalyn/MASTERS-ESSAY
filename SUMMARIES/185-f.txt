TREACHERY, OR, THE GRAVE OF ANTOINETTE

Corisande de Roussillon's somewhat despotic father promises her in marriage to the Duke de Briancon, though neither her mother nor her brother Mortaigne approves of the engagement. Despite this involuntary engagement Corisande is having a romantic life, for she is finding anonymous poems in a purportedly haunted boathouse from which music emanates at odd hours. Further, she sees and afterward dreams about a youthful hunter, who will turn out to be Louis D'Avignon, boathouse poet and ultimately husband. He also saves Mortaigne's life in battle and becomes his friend, subsequently sharing adventures like going through trapdoors in ruins and being locked in.
Both Corisande, gone into a convent to escape the threatened marriage to the Duke, and Mortaigne, in his gentlemanly wanderings, meet some people who will be unexpectedly important to the denouement - two cottage girls, a hermit, a nun, etc. The gist of the revelations is that Louis is the brother of Gabrielle, a cottage girl who asked Mortaigne to take her to a religious sanctuary, and that both Louis and Gabrielle are the offspring of the hermit, formerly Everard St. Sauverne, who is brother to the nun Mathilde, a new convent friend of Corisande's and an old friend of her mother's. Louis and Gabrielle's mother (Antoinette) died in childbirth through the cruelty of her brother (Corisande's father), the Marquis de Roussillon. Everard was in love with Corisande's mother Hortense and once arranged to elope with her, but De Roussillon somehow substituted himself for Everard and married her instead. Everard was driven to the religious life by his cozening brother Eugene but seems to have embraced it sincerely, for we find him trying to induce the Marquis de Roussillon to repent, which the Marquis does at last on his deathbed. Corisande marries Louis; and Mortaigne marries Louis's sister Gabrielle, to whom he has proposed earlier in the novel.

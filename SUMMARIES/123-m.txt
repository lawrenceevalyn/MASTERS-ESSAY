THE MYSTERY OF THE BLACK TOWER. A ROMANCE

Leonard the peasant boy goes off to fight the Scots and makes good. He becomes friends with Edgar de Courci, a local nobleman who loves a girl named Julia. Leonard himself loves Emma but nearly loses her when his parents neglect to give her the letters he encloses in theirs. His adventures include exposure to some apparently supernatural phenomena in the Black Tower when he goes home on leave, and an encounter, back in the army, with a crazy, half-naked recluse named Hildebrand. (Hildebrand unwittingly killed his own son, whom he misunderstood to be an adulterous visitor to his wife.) Emma is kidnapped by the vicious Lord Edmund Fitzallan, who locks her up in the Black Tower. She is put in a haunted room to sleep, and when one morning she is missing the maid is certain that a ghost has taken her. Meanwhile Leonard has been captured and imprisoned by a lecherous Baroness; unfortunately, when she tries to kill her husband he kills her instead, and she dies without explaining that Leonard is locked up. Leonard, notwithstanding, makes his escape, in the course of which he falls through a floor, accidentally puts his hand on a "clammy and putrid" corpse, and has other mishaps. He also finds and rescues Emma, killing Fitzallan, who tries to prevent their escape. Fitzallan, dying, produces a confession which clarifies family relationships: the murdered son of the recluse Hildebrand was Leonard's father. As children, Leonard and his sister were imprisoned in the Black Tower with their mother who tied a miniature on him and dropped him from a window: Leonard is restored to his title and marries Emma; his sister Julia, the same Julia loved by his friend Edgar, is a friend of hers. The Black Tower is converted into a monastery.

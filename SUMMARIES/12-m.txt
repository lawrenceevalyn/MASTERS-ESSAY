LE FORESTER. A NOVEL

Hugh Le Forester, an ancient profligate, long ago succeeded to the titles and estate of his elder brother by having his nephew Eustace raised in a cottage, kidnapped, and sent to be sold into slavery. Saved by a shipwreck, Eustace came back to England and spent the rest of his life trying to regain his father's estate. Eustace's son Godfrey is the hero of the novel. A bookish and sensitive boy, he is taunted at Cambridge by Hugh's spies and finally attacked and knocked out by ruffians despite the preventative efforts of Emily Mason, to whose looks (sixteen and melancholy) he is attracted. As a result of the attack he suffers a long illness and some resultant imbecility but recovers at last. Emily coincidentally visits the house where he is recovering.

At one point Godfrey is obliged to kill an assassin (for which he will later be prosecuted) and is afterward subject to tearful depression. The narrative is interrupted in the second volume, most of which deals with the tribulations of Godfrey's father Eustace, a record of which is preserved in manuscript. With the resumption of the principal plot, Godfrey suffers further persecution, including kidnapping, imprisonment, and trial for murder. After his acquittal he and Emily elope, since there seems no hope of winning her father's consent. But her father and Hugh, she discovers, are the same man; as he is dying, apparently of a stroke brought on by attempting to shoot Godfrey, he gives his consent to their marriage. Godfrey's claim to the estate is validated.

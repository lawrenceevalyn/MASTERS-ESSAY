THE INFERNAL QUIXOTE. A TALE OF THE DAY

Lucas is opposed to Modern Philosophy and especially to the theories of Godwin. The novel, with a preface allegedly by Satan, recounts the infamous career of Marauder, a man who embraces these pernicious doctrines. Marauder poisons the mind of a girl named Emily with Godwin's views of marriage and persuades her to elope without benefit of clergy. Wilson Wilson, on the other hand, is conspicuously religious and good, and Emily's sister Fanny is good; they like each other.  Wilson, though a carpenter's son, is a trustee of Marauder's estate and tells him that he is not the true heir, which leads to a certain amount of legal machination on Marauder's part. Marauder challenges Wilson to a duel, but Wilson is against dueling on principle and makes the man who carries the challenge read tracts and scripture. Meanwhile, Marauder, who is involved in an Irish uprising, is getting into lengthy discussions of religion and Modern Philosophy, and Emily is weeping and tiring of being a mistress. Hearing that Wilson and Fanny plan to marry, Marauder decides to kidnap and seduce the latter. Wilson rescues her. Marauder at last goes berserk and jumps off a cliff.

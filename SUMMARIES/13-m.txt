MARY DE CLIFFORD. A STORY INTERSPERSED WITH MANY POEMS

George and Mary are the last son and daughter of the De Clifford family and are very fond of each other. Mary's social life takes a lively turn when George's set notices that she is no longer a child. Only two of the young men are important to the plot. Woodvile, brilliant and eccentric, is George's favorite and ultimately Mary's. There are disturbing rumors that he will marry Emily, his sister Elinor's friend, but these are dispelled when Mary and Woodvile admit their love for each other. Peter Lumm, a nouveau riche neighbor whom George barely tolerates, proposes to Emily with her mother's encouragement but is turned down. Lumm is a pretentious dunce who claims to admire Milton and asks whether he has written anything lately. (Brydges tells us that Mary's library includes Petrarch, Spenser, Milton, Cowley, Thompson, The Castle of Otranto, and the novels of Mrs. Smith.)

A dispute over an old debt, settled by Woodvile's father without receipts and revived by Lumm's steward, leads to a duel between Lumm and Woodvile. Woodvile is killed. Lumm flees to the continent. Woodvile's mother dies of grief, as does Mary after several months of shock, fits, and lunacy. At the end of the novel Woodvile's sister Elinor is low in health and spirits, and Mary's brother George is not expected to recover from his melancholy.

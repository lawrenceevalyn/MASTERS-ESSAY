THE IRISH GUARDIAN, OR, ERRORS OF ECCENTRICITY

Mackenzie's preface makes a statement in favor of virtue in novels, citing those of Dr. Moore and Mr. Dallas as good examples, and assures the reader that in the novel at hand all the errors of the Irish Guardian's conduct arise from his goodness of heart.
The Irish Guardian is Captain Derrick, who some years before the story begins found a female infant in Portugal; its family was being tortured to death for political reasons and it was to be executed with the others. Derrick presented the baby, Almeria, to his married sister to raise and later taught the little girl to think of him as an uncle. As the novel opens she is grown up and in love with Frederico de Lima. She and Captain Derrick (both in masculine clothing) have just survived a shipwreck together. Their affairs are complicated by those of Frederico, a man much persecuted - drugged, straight-jacketed, and imprisoned in Portugal, where much of the story takes place. At one point, incited by the villain Polygon, the Inquisition arrests Almeria and accuses her of being contracted in marriage to her own brother. Investigation shows that the charge is based on a statement of Derrick's; he hotly asserts that he said Almeria and Frederico "loved like brother and sister," not that they were. (Presumably his unlucky statement is one of the errors arising from his goodness of heart.) After further complications the couple are aided by Count de Lima, who has appeared in several guises during the story - Favorita the hermit, a Spanish officer, an Inquisitor. Lost relatives are discovered, e.g., a sister for Almeria, and justice prevails.

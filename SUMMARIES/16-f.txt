THE HORRORS OF OAKENDALE ABBEY

Laura is sent to haunted Oakendale Abbey by Lord Oakendale, who wishes to seduce her. She is alone in the world except for one female servant, for not only her parents but her subsequent guardians are dead or missing. (Her earliest recollections are of being put on a ship by people in exotic clothing; the ship was captured and she was taken to a French prison where her identity papers were taken from her. The surgeon De Frene, who liberated and adopted her, has lately been decapitated for political reasons. Madame de Frene and Laura, who left Paris together after De Frene's head was delivered on a pike, were somehow put on two different ships. Eugene Rayneer, whom she loves, has sent no word since he was called back to England by his guardian. Oakendale has acquired Laura by pretending to send her to his sister in London in order that she may better search for her adopted mother.) Laura is brave, but it is a frightening abbey; it is later revealed to be the headquarters for a body-snatching business, which accounts for some of her nastier discoveries.

Lord Oakendale arrives at the Abbey to find that Laura has escaped. Not an altogether wicked man, he worries a little about her safety, but in fact she is being cared for by a philanthropic female neighbor. Sudden revelations of identity show Eugene Rayneer to be the bastard son of Lord Oakendale's wife, and Laura to be the daughter of Oakendale's brother William. Grateful at having avoided incest, Oakendale repents and becomes respectably avuncular. He does make trouble by opposing the marriage of Laura and Eugene and indeed nearly tries to force a renunciation from Laura when he is dying, but he relents. The marriage takes place and Eugene is permitted to inherit from his natural father, Lord Vincent.

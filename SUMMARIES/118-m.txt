GRASVILLE ABBEY. A ROMANCE

Clementina is put in a convent by her father for economic reasons but runs away with a rich gentleman named Percival Maserini. They marry and hide in caves to escape pursuit by officials who think Clernentina poisoned her sister in the convent before she escaped (she did not). Maserini goes to his father's horne, Grasville Abbey, but finds the bellpull rusty, his father dead, and talk of "strange doings" in the Abbey, which his wicked Cousin D'Ollifont inherited after killing Maserini's father with false reports about the deaths of his children. D'Ollifont is afraid to sleep in the abbey. Maserini is determined to explore it; the next morning a servant finds footprints, blood, and the miniature Maserini was wearing, with the ribbon torn as if by wrench- ing.
Clementina bears twins, Alfred and Matilda, and lives in Paris. When she dies she writes Alfred a note to tell him who she thinks killed his father but dies before she puts the name down. The twins go to their only receptive relative, a rich liquor merchant in London. The son of the family teaches Alfred gaming and helps D'Ollifont pursue Matilda. When Alfred hears this and discovers that the woman he loves is being taken out of town to avoid him, he repents of his association. Count D'Ollifont intends to seduce Matilda and carry her off, but an anonymous warning permits Alfred to shoot and wound him. Alfred and Matilda go to live in Grasville Abbey and take in a stray girl, Agnes. At the Abbey, mysteries are unraveled. Supernatural effects were provided by a hermit who has been blackmailed into assisting D'Ollifont's villainy. The twins' father returns to explain his mysterious abduction. Agnes is reunited with her mother. D'Ollifont dies in guilty agonies.

THE VAMPYRE. A TALE

Aubrey travels with an older and interesting nobleman named Lord Ruthven but later disapproves of and leaves him. ' Aubrey begins to think that Ruthven may be supernatural. Later Aubrey meets and becomes attached to Ianthe, an innocent but well-informed Greek girl, who tries to tell him about vampires. He does not listen until a vampire, Lord Ruthven in fact, kills Ianthe. Aubrey falls ill from shock and Ruthven nurses him. Ruthven is wounded by robbers and, dying, makes Aubrey promise not to reveal his death for a year and a day. During that period Ruthven appears and courts Aubrey's sister. At the expiration of his oath Aubrey manages to tell about Ruthven, but it is too late; the vampire has married the girl and taken her away.

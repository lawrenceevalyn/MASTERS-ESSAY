THE NECROMANCER, OR, THE TALE OF THE BLACK FOREST

Herman tells his friend Hellfried about a strange experience. Once he stayed at an inn where his money and watch were somehow removed from his person. A mysterious stranger returned the watch, an action that upset the ghost of Herman's mother. The ghost appeared a second time, conjured up by the stranger; at its appearance Herman suddenly found himself in a speeding carriage with Something snoring beside him. The carriage overturned and a nobleman rescued him.
Hellfried believes him, having had a strange experience himself. He tells of a wicked nobleman who used villagers as hounds (and sometimes prey) for hunting and so was condemned to ghostly hunting every night. Hellfried was pressured by the example of his friends' bravado into spending the night in the nobleman's uninhabited castle, where he indeed saw the ghosts. A mysterious old man later raised the nobleman's ghost and that of his lady (still maritally incompatible) and locked the young men in the vault.
A document from one of Hellfried's friends tells yet another story. A soldier who was one of the ghost-seeing company above tries to find out more and made friends with a man called "The Austrian." The latter knew a military man named Volkert who dabbled in necromancy, and once, though forbidden by his general to play with the occult, conjured a live man, nearly killing him in the process. Volkert was frightened by that one himself. The narrator and the Austrian went back to the town of the ghostly hunt. There they discovered the "ghosts" to be bandits. But a Father Francis raised a different ghost for them, and the Austrian recognized the priest as Volkert. At the end Volkert was exposed as having been in league with the robbers.

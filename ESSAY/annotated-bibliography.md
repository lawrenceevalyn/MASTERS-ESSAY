* "This dissertation will use the quantitative and qualitative tools of corpus linguistics to analyse a corpus of Gothic Fiction from the nineteenth century with the purpose of describing the genre in terms of its use of language and seeing how the results correlate with themes that have emerged through more traditional literary analyses." (5)
* "According to McEnery et al., and supported by Sinclair, corpus linguistics can be defined as “a collection of (1) machine readable (2) authentic texts (including transcripts of spoken data) which is (3) sampled to be (4) representative of a particular language or language variety” (McEnery et al. 2006, pp.5, Sinclair 2004)." (15)
* only ELEVEN (!) texts, and NO RADCLIFFE!!! (16) --> so apparently I can claim to be doing 'corpus linguistics' even if I only work with the tiny, tiny fraction of canon texts that I have human-corrected OCR of.
* "Within the different time periods the texts were selected randomly" (17) -- ??? -- From what list? How were they randomized?? I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
* **WordSmith Tools 5.0 (Scott 2008)**: keyword analysis, frequency analysis, concordance lines and extracts (probably only useful with clean OCR), collocations and clusters
* "The ideal size of a reference corpus is at least five times the size of the smaller corpus (Berber-Sardinia 2000)" - but BNC seems problematic for being too contemporary? Maybe use something from ECCO?
* Noticed a lot of pronouns and vocatives, but this might just be because they're comparing novels to non-novel texts? Body parts sounds like a solid observation, though!
* concordance lines are REALLY cool
* "If the words that describe the themes or the feelings elicited from the reading of the texts are used fairly infrequently, how is it that these themes and feelings are so easily associated with the genre of Gothic fiction? This can partially be explained through the high frequency of the words seemed and looked of which the tenth most frequent cluster is looked as if." (33) - Hmmm. Mostly on board, I suppose. "This helps to associate seemed and looked as if with the Gothic elements of the novels so that even when the Gothic words are not present, the association remains." (33)

## Research Question

My interest in the Gothic novel 1790-1830 is focused on the role of non-canonical texts, and how we can make sense of the wider body of novels that formed the context for the trailblazing works which are currently studied. My goal was to extract as much meaning as possible from the metadata available to me, to form the hypotheses that will drive the next phase of my research during my PhD. In particular, I wanted to see if I could find defining characteristics of the Female Gothic or the 'school of Radcliffe.'

Based on Frow's argument that individual texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), 
I argue that the 'school of Radcliffe', as it would have been identified by 18th century readers, cannot be defined by Radcliffe's works alone. Gothic readers were famously voracious, reading Radcliffe's works immediately alongside large number of now-forgotten Gothics, and it is these non-canonical works which would have defined the shape of the Gothic as a whole as that genre emerged.


## Critical Frameworks

Although my inquiry is essentially historicist, my objects of inquiry were actually two bibliographies of the Gothic: Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830, and Frederick Frank's The First Gothics. For each bibliography, I looked critically at what model of the early Gothic is implied by the information presented, and translated that model to a form that can be visually interpreted.

## Ann Tracy

The way Tracy structures her "Index to Motifs" treats each motif as a Boolean indicator, something that is either there or not-there; she elides any sense of the importance or intensity of a motif within a work, treating the motifs themselves as the object of inquiry for future scholars, with the novels simply as a place to go looking for the motifs.

I made 92 charts of motifs or motif sub-categories that appeared in at least 20 novels, examining each for gendered usage.

Many of the individual motifs represent unexpected findings -- for example, subterranean passages are far less female-dominated than one might have expected, particularly if Radcliffe's six subterranean passages are excluded.

However, my most important result is the birds-eye-view discovery that more than half the motifs aren't gendered at all, and there are only five things which can be used as markers for female authorship. The more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered. [fainting]

This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female
terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic
mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it.
The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be
a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic.

## Frederick Frank

For the 178 texts indexed by both authors, Frank provides 131 unique classifications. I broke down each element of these classification into 'tags', which I could then track individually. [“Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements)” > "domestic", "gothic elements"] Whereas Tracy treated her motifs as independent and stable, Frank is not interested in his
Gothic types in and of themselves.

These are the 45 tags that emerged, and here is the gendered breakdown of the eleven most popular tags. The marginalized nature of our male Gothic is evident in the low numbers of Schauerromantik and Lewis-ian novels -- in fact, there were so few novels marked as either imitations of the Monk or as monastic shockers that I had to reduce my arbitrary cut-off of 10 to 9 simply to be ably to consider Lewis. And again, our sample is dominated by a non-gendered mainstream.

But for the first time we also see a female Gothic, connected to sentimental writing-- which explains why this female tradition was not visible in Tracy's motifs, since sentimental novels are not characterized by flashy imagery.

Approaching from one direction, 50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic (fig. 100). If
you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and
sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, 25% of sentimental novels are
also Radcliffean (fig. 99). Gothic types which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are
sentimental, naturalized or explained, and high Gothic, in that order.

## The Sentimental Novel

If there is a female Gothic, then, it has its roots in sentimental fiction. In turning to the sentimental novel, I return to a version of the history of the Gothic prevalent in the 1950s and 60s, in which the Gothic does not grow out of a German tradition, but out of the French, as part of a process of intensification from the sentimental novel to the novel of sensibility to the sensational and Gothic novels. This body of criticism, exemplified by Ernest Baker and JMS Thompkins, has fallen out of the critical conversation somewhat justifiably for the fundamental realist teleology which defines their approaches. However, we can reject their assumption that the goal of the novel is to become realist, without rejecting their argument that the development from sentiment to Gothic was a matter of intensification, rather than of change in type. 

This allows a new way of understanding the genre itself, in which moral sentiment, and its connection to the emotional experience of the reader, was the throughline which connected the Gothic deeply to its non-Gothic literary context, and to the broader intellectual debates of the end of the Enlightenment.

## Conclusion

My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to
retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself. I
have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers
as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool. In doing so, I have found
evidence at various points of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with
some critical conceptions. However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large
body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel
nature of any binary distinctions one might wish to draw. McCarty argues that “a good model
can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its
theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question” — of these, he
says, “failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result” (McCarty).
Accordingly, my failure to find a an obvious or stable gender divide within the Gothic is
valuable as evidence that in the broadest context of the Gothic, the conversation occurring
between novels is not driven by authorial gender.

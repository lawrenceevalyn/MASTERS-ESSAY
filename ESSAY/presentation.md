## Research Question

My interest in the Gothic novel 1790-1830 is focused on the role of non-canonical texts, and how we can make sense of the wider body of novels that formed the context for the trailblazing works which are currently studied. My goal was to extract as much meaning as possible from the metadata available to me, to form the hypotheses that will drive the next phase of my research during my PhD. In particular, I wanted to see if I could find defining characteristics of the Female Gothic or the 'school of Radcliffe.'

Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101).

## Critical Frameworks

So, my objects of inquiry were actually two bibliographies of the Gothic: Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830, and Frederick Frank's The First Gothics. For each bibliography, I looked critically at what model of the early Gothic is implied by the information presented, and translated that model to a form that can be visually interpreted.

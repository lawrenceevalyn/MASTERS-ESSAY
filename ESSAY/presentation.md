## Research Question

My interest in the Gothic novel 1790-1830 is focused on the role of non-canonical texts, and how we can make sense of the wider body of novels that formed the context for the trailblazing works which are currently studied. My goal was to extract as much meaning as possible from the metadata available to me, to form the hypotheses that will drive the next phase of my research during my PhD.

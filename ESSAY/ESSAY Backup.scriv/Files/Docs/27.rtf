\f0\fs24 \cf0 However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the \'91high\'92 Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank\'92s bibliography, 
\i The First Gothics
\i0 , which includes a classification of each text\'92s \'93Gothic type\'94. Frank\'92s \'93types\'94 are, like Tracy\'92s \'93motifs,\'94 clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications \cb2 (CITE APPENDIX)\cb1 . Many of these are \'93unique\'94 only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: \'93Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)\'94 and \'93Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),\'94 for example, clearly refer to the same general \'93type.\'94 In order to render his assessments useful for my own project, however, it was necessary to reduce his minute distinctions into broader categories. This process of reduction became, in its own right, my second experiment: at each stage of my gradual process of simplification, I asked, \'93Which distinctions of genre appear to be borne out by differences in authorship or content?\'94 This process of reduction also led to my second [result]: in my historicist reading of the bulk of the early Gothic the operant genre distinctions are not really to do with horror vs terror, but rather the domestic vs High Gothic.}

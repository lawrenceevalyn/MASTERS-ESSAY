\f0\fs24 \cf0 The first thing these design choices make apparent is the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary, in keeping with my [observations of Tracy\'92s motifs]. The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged \'93terror\'94 and only 24 (13%) tagged \'93horror\'94. Of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books as pure \'93horror mode.\'94 However, although the relative scale of each mode accords with what we saw in Tracy\'92s motifs, the smaller horror mode no longer seems to be so strongly male-dominated. And if we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, separating out the \'93horror-terror\'94 mixed-modes books from the rest, our gendered expectations are [even more wrong]: the 10 pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors, and it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship.}

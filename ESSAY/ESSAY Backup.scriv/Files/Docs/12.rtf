\f0\fs24 \cf0 When we examine those motifs which do not themselves encode a gender, we discover another surprise: of the 31 motifs that involve a notable disparity, the only two in which women outnumber men are libertines and miniature portraits. The remaining 29 are all examples of motifs used primarily by men.\
If we go looking for the Female Gothic plot-- in female vulnerability, or in the restoration of broken family ties, for example-- the results are underwhelming.\
And if we turn our attention to those images-- like blood, caves, and subterranean passages-- which have been simplistically aligned with the feminine, we find that, in the larger body of Gothic works, these have much more often appeared in works by men.\
Caves and subterranean passages have perhaps been the most misperceived. Although Ann Radcliffe, critically credited with defining and refining the tropes of the female Gothic, makes heavy use of both motifs, she is one of very few female authors to do so. When her three caves and six subterranean passages are excluded from the sample, both motifs become even more decidedly male.\
Perhaps these men are, like Henry Walpole in The Castle of Otranto, presenting underground spaces as avenues of flight or sanctuary for distressed women; even if so, the association is no longer likely to be, as early feminist critic Juliann Fleenor characterized the Female Gothic, an expression of an unnameable conflict with patriarchy (28). It is more likely, instead, that these caverns have appeared as the secret meeting-places of conspirators, as part of a German-influenced tradition of tales about criminal underworlds and evil Illuminati.}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 I began with the ten-page \'91Index to Motifs\'92 included at the end of Ann Tracy\'92s bibliography. Tracy uses the term \'93motif\'94 broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is \'93scholars with particular interests\'94 (195), who wish to locate new books to close-read that contain difficult-to-find individual story elements, such as \'93doppelganger\'94 (198) or \'93garden as a scene of temptation\'94 (200). Accordingly, Tracy has prioritized presenting a wide range of distinctive individual motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, her preface to the index indicates that highly popular motifs were intentionally excluded: \'93the abundance of murders,\'94 she says, \'93argued for the retention\'85 of specialized murders only\'94 (195), and castles have similarly been ignored. [Tracy\'92s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness.] [It treats each individual novels as a bucket of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar.] [The information presented alongside each novel\'92s bibliographic entry, by which critics are meant to determine whether they want to read the book, is a plot summary.] [Her summaries point out distinctive details, such as \'93a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides\'94 (74) ][The bare facts of the plot are thus treated as the primary site of interesting investigation.] [The motifs themselves \'97 Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens \'97 thus become the stable objects of study, which may or may not become visible in individual texts.] [Intertextual and chronological relationships are minimized in favor of [motifs]]. [In this model of the Gothic, the Gothic is defined by free-floating concepts, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.]}

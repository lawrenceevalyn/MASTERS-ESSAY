<p class="p3">The separation of Ann Radcliffe from her peers is not in keeping with how readers of the day experienced the gothic.</p>

<p class="p3">The gothic calls for a large-scale examination.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc34"></a>general methods</i></h3>
<p class="p3">To take the first clumsy steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography <i>The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs</i> and Frederick Frank’s <i>The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel</i>; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc80"></a>my ultimate argument</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, my fundamentally historicist methods will lead me to argue that gender in the Gothic does not operate as a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Monk binary. Instead, I suggest a reading of the genre in which [I HAVE CONCLUSIONS]</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc55"></a>many experiments</i></h3>
<p class="p3">I carried out a wide range of experiments. The bulk of my paper today will discuss the most fruitful/successful of those experiments, but the pool from which I selected this experiment was broad.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc56"></a>why no texts?</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which only exist for the most critically-examined novels. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the ‘school of Radcliffe’; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc54"></a>key terms</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The key terms for my approach are “modeling” and “deformance.”</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc38"></a>McCarty summary</i></h3>
<p class="p3">McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints <i>of</i> historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints <i>for</i> new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (CITE), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models <i>of</i> that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (CITE). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus of full texts for famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (CITE); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may</p>

<p class="p3">But if my spreadsheet and graphs model “the Gothic novel”, they also deform it.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc57"></a>70 pie charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">So basically I made 70 pie charts. [Preliminary mention of what I will argue about these pie charts.]</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc61"></a>biggest charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc59"></a>39 neutral charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc60"></a>29 male charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them indicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc64"></a>male incest</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc75"></a>male horror</i></h3>
<p class="p3">To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc58"></a>libertines, miniatures</i></h3>
<p class="p3">In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc62"></a>male/female chars</i></h3>
<p class="p3">For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc66"></a>not a binary</i></h3>
<p class="p3">These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. This method allows us to perceive The Male Gothic as weird incest stuff off in the corner, but it does not follow that the other stuff is The Female Gothic.</p>

<p class="p3">The unbalanced nature of our attempted binary is borne out by my investigation of Frederick Frank’s bibliography, <i>The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel</i>.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc68"></a>tagging methods</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications <span class="s1">(CITE APPENDIX)</span>. Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” [In order to deal with this, I broke down the types into “tags”]</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc73"></a>main genres</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The sample is dominated by the high Gothic and by the terror mode, both of which are largely gender-neutral affairs. However, horror is not nearly so evenly matched against terror as we might have hoped — nor as male-dominated. And mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole: history, domestic, sentimental, naturalized, Schauerromantik.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc76"></a>men are in the corner</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Indeed, in accordance with the conclusions I drew from Tracy’s motifs, the Male Gothic operates as a distinct minority of the genre as a whole. Even including ‘Monk-ian’ in this list requires a bit of fudging; this category includes 3 texts named as imitations of The Monk, 5 texts named as ‘monastic shockers,’ and The Monk itself — and even then this only provides 9 novels, below my initial arbitrary threshold of 10.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc78"></a>women: Radcliffean</i></h3>
<p class="p3">And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, <i>does</i> bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. This bright yellow rectangle suggests that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc79"></a>Radcliffe: sentimental</i></h3>
<p class="p3">In contrast, this technique allows me to see an emerging “school of Radcliffe” — and it’s the sentimental novel.</p>
<p class="p3">[Of all the novels tagged Radcliffean, what else are they tagged?]</p>
<p class="p3">50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic! If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order.</p>
<p class="p3">25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean! genres which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized, and high, in that order. (terror and monastic shocker are actually on par!! but this is an artefact of the much lower numbers of monastic shockers)</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc69"></a>women: sentimental</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Instead, the main gendered trend we see is the female dominance of ‘sentimental’ novels.</p>

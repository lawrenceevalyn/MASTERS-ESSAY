<p class="p3">Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy’s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy’s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various “motifs” can be found. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as a simple starting point for in-depth explorations of particular topics. However, a modern spreadsheet program renders trivially easy what would have been a monumental feat of correlation in 1981 when Tracy’s work was published, and I have adapted her index to a different purpose: charting the genders of the indexed authors, I have asked which motifs — if any — can serve as predictors of the authorial gender of a given text. If we know that a novel has a subterannean passage in it, for example, or a monastery, or a prophetic dream, do we know anything about who wrote it? This particular framing of the question— not “what do men and women each write about?” but “what, if it appears, can be used to distinguish between men and women?” — was chosen to avoid [[FIND THE ARTICLE ABOUT UNPROVABLE CIRCULAR HYPOTHESES]]</p>

<p class="p3">However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank’s bibliography, <i>The First Gothics</i>, which includes a classification of each text’s “Gothic type”. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications. Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” In order to render his assessments useful for my own project, however, it was necessary to reduce his minute distinctions into broader categories. This process of reduction became, in its own right, my second experiment: at each stage of my gradual process of simplification, I asked, “Which distinctions of genre appear to be borne out by differences in authorship or content?” This process of reduction also led to my second<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from bioliogically essentialist writing to [Dr Miles]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc51"></a>still small sample</i></h3>
<p class="p3">However, this more sophisticated approach still seeks to define gendered approaches to writing based on a tiny number of writers.</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc52"></a>voraciousness</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The separation of Ann Radcliffe from her peers is not in keeping with how readers of the day experienced the gothic.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>

<p class="p3">The gothic calls for a large-scale examination.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc34"></a>general methods</i></h3>
<p class="p3">To take the first clumsy steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography <i>The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs</i>; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”The sonnet is, perhaps, the form least likely to leap to mind when one sits down to discuss the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance. Even if one resists the urge to view the entire era through the lens of modernism, the next most obvious site of artistic experimentation is the use of dialect in poetry, and other attempts to capture the authentic voice of Harlem life. In contrast, the sonnet, as Amitai Avi-Ram has noted, is often read as conventional and inherently conservative (32). However, if we form our picture of the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance not based on the subsequent popularity of individual works or authors, but by examining the anthologies which explicity sought to define ‘Negro verse’ during the height of the movement itself, the sonnet appears not just as a recurring tradition but a site of innovation. On the rare occassion that a scholar considers a Harlem Renaissance sonnet at length, discussion of its form often begins and ends with the choice of the sonnet itself. And indeed, innovation within a fixed form is subtle and limited, easily overshadowed by more dramatic poetic inventions. Nonetheless, it is by no means impossible, and close examination of the wide range of sonnets circulating at this period reveals innovations at three sites of increasing subtlety: subject matter, sestet rhyme schemes, and manipulation of the volta. The varying experimentation by different poets serves different aesthetic and political goals, but as a whole, the Harlem Renaissance sonnet, despite its archaic European form, creates a small self-sufficient canon.</p>

<p class="p3">I carried out a wide range of experiments. The bulk of my paper today will discuss the most fruitful/successful of those experiments, but the pool from which I selected this experiment was broad.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc56"></a>why no texts?</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc38"></a>McCarty summary</i></h3>
<p class="p3">McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints <i>of</i> historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints <i>for</i> new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (CITE), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models <i>of</i> that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (CITE). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus of full texts for famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (CITE); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may</p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc57"></a>70 pie charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">So basically I made 70 pie charts. [Preliminary mention of what I will argue about these pie charts.]</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc61"></a>biggest charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc59"></a>39 neutral charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc60"></a>29 male charts</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them imdicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc64"></a>horror, incest</i></h3>
<p class="p3">The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc66"></a>not a binary</i></h3>
<p class="p3">To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</p>
<p class="p3">However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the province of women. Ann Radcliffe may have founded the terror-Gothic school, but women and men appear to have followed in her footsteps equally. Moreover, the existence of two opposing schools does not prove the equal footing of those schools; setting aside questions of gender to look at the relative prominence of various motifs, readers are vastly more likely to encounter the temporary terrors of abduction and confinement than the more permanent horrors of bones and corpses. Even death, which could reasonably appear in either school of novel despite its horrifying potential, is unexpectedly scarce compared to the widespread fainting.</p>
<p class="p3">In the wider context of the Gothic, then, it seems that the terror-Gothic and the Female Gothic are, in fact, simply the Gothic-- with the male horror-Gothic as the outlier subgenre in which an author's writing has been shaped by his gender.</p>
<p class="p3">a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc58"></a>libertines, miniatures</i></h3>
<p class="p3">In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>

<p class="p3">However, I will argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. Here I turn to Frederick Frank.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc68"></a>gothic types</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications <span class="s1">(CITE APPENDIX)</span>. Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” [In order to deal with this, I broke down the types into “tags”]</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>

<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc71"></a>Radcliffe/Monk</i></h3>
<p class="p3">Frank directly identifies many works as imitations of other works. 12 works are identified as ‘Radcliffian’ (18 counting Radcliffe’s own 6 works), 3 as imitations of The Monk, and 5 more as ‘monastic shockers’ (4 and 6 when The Monk is counted twice and included in both categories). The gender breakdowns of these categories are precisely what we would expect: all 18 Radcliffian novels are by women, and 7 of the 9 novels identified as Monk-ian or as monastic shockers are by men.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 14.0px Times"><i><a id="doc70"></a>horror/terror</i></h3>
<p class="p3">However, this binary is not at all what we see when examining Frank’s categorization of horror and terror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

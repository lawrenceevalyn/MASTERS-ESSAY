<p class="binderItem"><strong>Gendered Gothics</strong><br/>As the first step toward a more comprehensive perspective, therefore, I have begun by surveying the 208 novels described in detail in Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs, treating these texts as an approximate model of the Gothic in this period. For each 'motif' identified by Tracy as appearing in a large enough number of works to be worths examining in further detail, I have calculated how often it has been deployed by men versus women. The question is thu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Male and Female Characters</strong><br/>For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women. Not all of the individual motifs involve a particularly noteworthy contrast, but in general, monasteries are much more often discussed by men, and convents only weakly more by women...<br/>
...with a similar trend in clergymen versus abbesses and nuns.<br/>
However, when it comes to libertines versus loose women, each is more often written about by authors of the op...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Female Gothic</strong><br/>When we examine those motifs which do not themselves encode a gender, we discover another surprise: of the 31 motifs that involve a notable disparity, the only two in which women outnumber men are libertines and miniature portraits. The remaining 29 are all examples of motifs used primarily by men.<br/>
If we go looking for the Female Gothic plot-- in female vulnerability, or in the restoration of broken family ties, for example-- the results are underwhelming.<br/>
And if we turn our attention to those i...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Male Gothic</strong><br/>A male interest in crime and conspiracy is also suggested by the predominantly-male authorship of banditti and piracy, and Inquisition and secrecy.<br/>
However, even more striking are those motifs which suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but ra...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusions</strong><br/>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.<br/>
However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the provi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Thesis</strong><br/>Literary discussions of gender at the birth of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century have grown ever more nuanced and detail-oriented over the years. [We have gone from, for example,  Fleenor’s societal emphasis on relationship to patriarchy to a more literary emphasis in Wallace & Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions.] [However, to accomplish this more sophisticated approach, scholars have of necessity focused in greater detail on smaller numbers of texts.] [My goal, in applying a la...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>voraciousness - Frow</strong><br/>[My interest in placing Radcliffe back into the broadest possible context is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers the way that ‘literary fiction’ is separated from ‘romance novels’ today.<br/>
This readerly voraciousness is p...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>general methods</strong><br/>To take the first steps toward that understanding, I have created and carefully examined visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs and Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies” and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and In...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>modeling - McCarty</strong><br/>In determining my approach to [intentionally seeing broadly rather than in detail], I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blue...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>modeling - sensitivity</strong><br/>Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, [it] is no longer a model at all, but the [thing itself]; tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study (too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence), and so models are always “fictional” (McCarty CITE).  “Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness.” (McCarty CITE). [The...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>modeling - Samuels & McGann</strong><br/>So, pragmatic reasons are one reason a model might diverge in “isomorphic exactness” (McCarty CITE) from that which it models; the other is what McCarty terms “distortion” (CITE), but which Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle  mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation paraphrases and distorts artistic works in service of its own performative ope...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>methods</strong><br/>I began with the ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’ included at the end of Ann Tracy’s bibliography. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is “scholars with particular interests” (195), such as “garden as a scene of temptation” (200), who wish to locate new books to close-read. Accordingly, Tracy has prioritized ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>model</strong><br/>This description of my methods emphasizes places where differences between books have been intentionally reduced. However, this [whatever] does not result in a loss of [knowledge]. Instead, [Pivoting metaphor]. [I deform her index to produce a model of the Gothic that is sensitive to what particular elements of the ‘Gothic toolkit’ authors are more likely to use.] [My deformed version of Tracy’s index is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but sensitivity to one th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>design</strong><br/>The charts’ design is meant to render the charts a fruitful body for interpretive readings. The size of each circle, for example, reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two colors in each chart reflects the difference between the percentages. This latter choice is motivated by my desire to identify motifs that have strong predictive power: if a motif is used completely equally by men and women, for example, it is n...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male gothic</strong><br/>Nonetheless, an identificable gendered school does emerge: 29 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>female gothic</strong><br/>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; [the Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusions</strong><br/>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male ho...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>methods</strong><br/>In order to better define that Gothic mainstream, I turned to a second bibliography, which classified novels by their ‘Gothic type’; here, too, the unbalanced nature of our attempted binary becomes obvious. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). [They were meant to be read by a human who wants to know more about an individual book, not me...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>many schools</strong><br/>The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high or pure” Gothic (64); “terror mode” (63); “history” (30); “domestic” fiction (28); “horror mode” (25); “sentimental” fiction (24); “Radcliffean” novels (19, which includes 6 novels by Radcliffe); “chapbook” stories (17); “natural” Gothics, consisting of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary m...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male gothic</strong><br/>Indeed, in accordance with the conclusions I drew from Tracy’s motifs, the Male Gothic operates as a distinct minority of the genre as a whole. Even including ‘Monk-ian’ in this list requires a bit of fudging; this category includes 3 texts named as imitations of The Monk, 5 texts named as ‘monastic shockers,’ and The Monk itself — and even then this only provides 9 novels, below my initial arbitrary threshold of 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>female gothic</strong><br/>And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, does bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. This bright yellow rectangle suggests that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information, but the gendered trend suggested by Frank’s gothic types is not defined by flash...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>sentimental novels - McIntyre</strong><br/>This may explain the comparison of Udolpho to Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzled Clara McIntyre. In response to a review which declated Udolpho to be “the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s Simple Story,” McIntyre is taken aback by the expression “this kind” (94). She says, “The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story” (94)...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>return to older criticism</strong><br/>My results here suggest a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels— rather than German horror stories— as the forbears of the Gothic. [These frameworks are sensitive to different aspects of the Gothic.] Ernest Baker, for example, argues that “[t]he sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emoti...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>reject realist teleology</strong><br/>These earlier approaches have largely been superceded now, partly for their now-charming willingness to render emotional judments on authors — Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95), for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful — but more subtly problematic in these earlier...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>sensation, sentiment, sensibility</strong><br/>These critics sugest viewing the Gothic in terms of its relation to sensation, sentiment, and sensibility — all of which, Baker argues, are distinguished from each otehr only by “intensification”, and not in terms of fundamental type (120). [What does this model allow us to see? — in some ways it’s a return to Punter as well (?), to talk about the operation of fear itself  (“a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423)). We can also use this model to be aware again of Radcliffe...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>[My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself.] [I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool.] [In doing so, I have found evidence of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions.] [However, I r...</p>

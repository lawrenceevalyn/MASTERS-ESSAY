<p class="binderItem"><strong>Methods Intro</strong><br/>To address these questions, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Modeling</strong><br/>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the c...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>thesis</strong><br/>Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro / methods</strong><br/>My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy’s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy’s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various “motifs” can be found. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro to Frank</strong><br/>However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank’s bibliography, The First Gothics, which includes a classification of each text’s “Gothic type”. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts un...</p>

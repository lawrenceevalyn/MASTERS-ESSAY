<p class="binderItem"><strong>driving Q: 'school of Radcliffe'</strong><br/>Literary discussions of gender at the birth of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century have grown ever more nuanced and attentive to detail over the years. At its inception and [for a long time after], the genre as a whole was often dismissed as unserious due to a percieved [alignment with women]. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the Female Gothic, Gothic writing “written and consistently read by women” (The Female Gothic 7), to stand as a worthy subject of inq...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>genre - Frow</strong><br/>[My interest in placing Radcliffe back into the broadest possible context is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers the way that ‘literary fiction’ is separated from ‘romance novels’ today.<br/>
This readerly voraciousness is p...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>general methods</strong><br/>To take the first steps toward that understanding, I have created and carefully examined visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs and Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies” and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and In...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>modeling - McCarty</strong><br/>In determining my approach to [intentionally seeing broadly rather than in detail], I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (n. pag.). B...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>deformance - Samuels & McGann</strong><br/>So, pragmatic reasons are one reason a model might diverge in “isomorphic exactness” (McCarty) from that which it models; the other is what McCarty terms “distortion,” but which Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation paraphrases and distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>editing - Leah Price</strong><br/>[It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to [echo?] McCarty.] [The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price.] In The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel, Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann’s classification of “[e]laborate schola...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>salience</strong><br/>[My own modeling framework is informed by all of these.] [My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation.] [Sensitivity: the selection of a particular dataset renders particular distinctions more salient than others.] [Tracy’s motifs emphasize what happens. Texts are fragmented. The description of someone who is ‘a parricide’ in Melmoth (CITE) is placed on equal footing with [other parricides]] [In contrast, Frank’s Gothic types emphasize a work’s over...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Motifs</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy's model</strong><br/>I began with the ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’ included at the end of Ann Tracy’s bibliography. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is “scholars with particular interests” (195), who wish to locate new books to close-read that contain difficult-to-find individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” (198...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model</strong><br/>My own adaptation of Tracy’s bibliography [accepts this model and elaborates on it.] [Tracy is always pointing outward to the books themselves, but I have foregrounded the motifs.] [I turn my attention to those motifs prevalent enough that their multiple appearances constitute an object worthy of study.] Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs indexed appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from my study. [This leaves me with 70 motifs, which form the fou...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>design</strong><br/>Influenced by Joanna Drucker’s warnings that [graphs] too easily give the impression of a quantitative and objective truth which cannot exist, particularly in humanities [investigations] (“Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display”), I have [made my graphic design decisions procedurally generated]. [The goal is for the visual presentation of each chart to qualitatively indicate [stuff], and thus make them a fruitful body for interpretive readings.] I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male gothic</strong><br/>And indeed, an identifiable gendered school does emerge at a glance: 29 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rathe...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>female gothic</strong><br/>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; [the Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusions</strong><br/>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male ho...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank's model</strong><br/>In order to better define that Gothic mainstream, I turned to a second bibliography, which classified novels by their ‘Gothic type’; here, too, the unbalanced nature of our attempted binary becomes obvious. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use than my own quantification: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, Frank provides 131 unique classifications. Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “D...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model</strong><br/>Just as I had to work against the grain of Tracy’s preference for uniqueness and difference in order to [seek connections and correlations between motifs], so too have I [worked against the grain of Frank’s model], this time in the reverse direction: I have sought to separate out each strand, to treat it as [a category existing beyond the texts it applies to], so that [I can examine each one individually]. Rather than trying to define a single “Gothic type” for each work, I divided each “Gothic ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>design</strong><br/>My graphic design choices, as I sought to render each chart legible in terms of this driving question, followed similar principles as my motif chart designs. However, since each chart was specialized to a particular sub-question, each chart has its own slighly different procedure. [Stacked bar graphs let me consider all of the most-common tags as a group.] [Showing the raw counts, rather than [presenting] each bar as a percentage, allows the size of each bar to convey the relative prevalence of ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no terror/horror</strong><br/>The first thing these design choices make apparent is the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary, in keeping with my [observations of Tracy’s motifs]. The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged “terror” and only 24 (13%) tagged “horror”. Of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books as pure “horror mode.” However, although the relative scale of each mode accords with what we saw in Tracy’s ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Radcliffe/Lewis</strong><br/>And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, does bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. Frank identifies twelve novels as explicit imitations of Radcliffe; the “Radcliffe” tag includes those twelve, and Radcliffe’s own six novels — and every last one is by a woman. Radcliffe’s opposite in this binary is the “Monk / monastic” tag; no works were identified as imitations of Lewis himself, but nine (including The Monk itself) are identified as an imitation of The Monk, a “mona...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>many schools</strong><br/>An answer is suggested by a broader look at the tags beyond horror and terror which [are popular in Frank’s Gothic types]. Mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole; the eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high Gothic” (63); “terror” (62); “history” (29); “domestic” (27); “horror” (24); “sen...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>female gothic</strong><br/>To be precise about the nature of this connection, I [made several pivot tables] along the same principles of [predictive utility] that structured my examination of Tracy’s motifs. Approaching from one direction, 50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic. If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, 25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean. Gothic types which are likely to inc...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sentimental Novels</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>return to older criticism</strong><br/>My results here suggest a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels— rather than German horror stories— as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, argues that “[t]he sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and g...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>realist teleology</strong><br/>[Emotional content] is salient as a distinguishing factor because Baker, like many of his contemporaries, writes from  the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. [Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not so obviously mediated as Tracy’s or Frank’s; rather than explicitly deforming the texts under consideration into summaries and metadata, Baker proceeds [by referring to the texts themselves in their entirety]]. However, as Leah Price observes...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>sensation, sentiment, sensibility</strong><br/>These critics sugest viewing the Gothic in terms of its relation to sensation, sentiment, and sensibility — all of which, Baker argues, are distinguished from each other only by “intensification”, and not in terms of fundamental type (120). Thompkins, too, argues that ‘fantastic’ plot elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it: in the Gothic, she argues, "the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the r...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>[My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself.] [I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool.] [In doing so, I have found evidence of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions.] [However, I r...</p>

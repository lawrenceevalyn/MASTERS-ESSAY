<p class="binderItem"><strong>more sophisticated</strong><br/>Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from bioliogically essentialist writing to [Dr Miles]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>still small sample</strong><br/>However, this more sophisticated approach still seeks to define gendered approaches to writing based on a tiny number of writers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>voraciousness</strong><br/>The separation of Ann Radcliffe from her peers is not in keeping with how readers of the day experienced the gothic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>need to go big</strong><br/>The gothic calls for a large-scale examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>general methods</strong><br/>To take the first clumsy steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”</p>

</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Methods</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>many experiments</strong><br/>I carried out a wide range of experiments. The bulk of my paper today will discuss the most fruitful/successful of those experiments, but the pool from which I selected this experiment was broad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>why no texts?</strong><br/>Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>key terms</strong><br/>The key terms for my approach are “modeling” and “deformance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>McCarty summary</strong><br/>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the c...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sam&McG summary</strong><br/>But if my spreadsheet and graphs model “the Gothic novel”, they also deform it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I've made</strong><br/>[I’ve made a deformed model of Tracy’s bibliography, which is itself a deformed model of the Gothic]</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Results</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>70 pie charts</strong><br/>So basically I made 70 pie charts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>biggest charts</strong><br/>The defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>39 neutral charts</strong><br/>Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>29 male charts</strong><br/>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them imdicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effe...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>horror, incest</strong><br/>The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." Thi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>2 female charts</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male/female chars</strong><br/>For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women.</p>

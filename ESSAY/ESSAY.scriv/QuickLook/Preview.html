<p class="binderItem"><strong>more sophisticated</strong><br/>Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from biologically essentialist writing to [Dr Miles] <br/>
[• Brief sketch of criticism on Male vs Female Gothics over time – from Fleenor’s societal emphasis on relationship to patriarchy to a more literary emphasis in Wallace & Smith’s New Directions. ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>still small sample</strong><br/>However, this more sophisticated approach still seeks to define gendered approaches to writing based on a tiny number of writers.<br/>
[• But a more closer literary focus requires narrowing the field of Gothics under examination.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>voraciousness</strong><br/>The separation of Ann Radcliffe from her peers is not in keeping with how readers of the day experienced the gothic.<br/>
[• This narrower focus is not in keeping with how, e.g., Ann Radcliffe was perceived as readers – she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers (as ‘literary fiction’ is separated from ‘romance novels’ today)]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>John Frow: genre</strong><br/>This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but a self-defining process. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), [explain this idea]. Genres function by “mediat[ing] between a social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, “and the text which realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its de...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>general methods</strong><br/>To take the first steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs and Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies” and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpret...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my ultimate argument</strong><br/>Ultimately, my fundamentally historicist methods will lead me to argue that gender in the early Gothic does not operate as a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary. Instead, I suggest a reading of the genre in which [I HAVE CONCLUSIONS]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>many experiments</strong><br/>I carried out a wide range of experiments. The bulk of my paper today will discuss the most fruitful/successful of those experiments, but the pool from which I selected this experiment was broad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>why no texts?</strong><br/>Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which only exist for...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>key terms</strong><br/>The key terms for my approach are “modeling” and “deformance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>McCarty summary</strong><br/>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the c...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Motifs</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy's goals</strong><br/>I began with the ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’ included at the end of Ann Tracy’s bibliography. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is “scholars with particular interests” (195), such as “garden as a scene of temptation” (200), who wish to locate new books to close-read. Accordingly, Tracy has prioritized ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>nuance</strong><br/>However, this [whatever] does not result in a loss of [knowledge]. Instead, [Pivoting metaphor]. [I deform her index to produce a model of the Gothic that is sensitive to what particular elements of the ‘Gothic toolkit’ authors are more likely to use.] [Sensitivity to one thing is traded for sensitivity to another.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>70 pie charts</strong><br/>The charts’ design is meant to render the charts a [fertile?] body for interpretive readings. The size of each circle, for example, reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two colors in each chart reflects the difference between the percentages. This latter choice is motivated by my desire to identify motifs that have strong predictive power: if a motif is used completely equally by men and women, for example, it is...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>29 male charts</strong><br/>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them indicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effe...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male incest</strong><br/>The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." Thi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male horror</strong><br/>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>libertines, miniatures</strong><br/>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>39 neutral charts</strong><br/>[The Female Gothic is outnumberd by the Nobody Gothic] More than half of the 70 motifs not strongly gendered. Three — “dueling and other single combat,” “elopement (any),” and “relative, lost, discovery of” — are even perfect ties.<br/>
Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>biggest charts</strong><br/>Moreover, the more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>male/female chars</strong><br/>The more we seek a neat binary in the model, the more we find that it is unbalanced. For example, my sample suggests that men write more about men (male fainters, male abductees, clergymen), though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women (female fainters, female abductees, nuns and abbesses).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>not a binary</strong><br/>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. This method allows us to perceive The Male Gothic as weird incest stuff off in the corner, but it does not follow that the other stuff is The Female Gothic.<br/>
• And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>transition to Frank</strong><br/>• In order to better define that Gothic mainstream, I turned to a second bibliography, which classified novels by their ‘Gothic type.’ <br/>
The unbalanced nature of our attempted binary is borne out by my investigation of Frederick Frank’s bibliography, The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tagging methods</strong><br/>Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, may be subtly different from each other, but [TRANSITION]. I divided each “Gothic type” into a set of tags, an...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>main genres</strong><br/>The sample is dominated by the high Gothic and by the terror mode, both of which are largely gender-neutral affairs. However, horror is not nearly so evenly matched against terror as we might have hoped — nor as male-dominated. And mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole: history, domestic, sentimental, naturalized, Schauerromantik.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men are in the corner</strong><br/>Indeed, in accordance with the conclusions I drew from Tracy’s motifs, the Male Gothic operates as a distinct minority of the genre as a whole. Just including ‘Monk-ian’ in this list requires a bit of fudging; this category includes 3 texts named as imitations of The Monk, 5 texts named as ‘monastic shockers,’ and The Monk itself — and even then this only provides 9 novels, below my initial arbitrary threshold of 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women: Radcliffean</strong><br/>And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, does bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. This bright yellow rectangle suggests that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Radcliffe: sentimental</strong><br/>In contrast, this technique allows me to see an emerging “school of Radcliffe” — and it’s the sentimental novel.<br/>
[Of all the novels tagged Radcliffean, what else are they tagged?]<br/>
50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic! If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order.<br/>
25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean! Genres which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized, and high, in that order...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women: sentimental</strong><br/>Instead, the main gendered trend we see is the female dominance of ‘sentimental’ novels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>sentimental novels</strong><br/>This suggests a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw the sentimental novel— rather than the German Schauerromantik— as the forbear of the Gothic.</p>

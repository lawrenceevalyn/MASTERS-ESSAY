<p class="binderItem"><strong>more sophisticated</strong><br/>Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from bioliogically essentialist writing to [Dr Miles] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>still small sample</strong><br/>However, this more sophisticated approach still seeks to define gendered approaches to writing based on a tiny number of writers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>voraciousness</strong><br/>The separation of Ann Radcliffe from her peers is not in keeping with how readers of the day experienced the gothic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>need to go big</strong><br/>The gothic calls for a large-scale examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>general methods</strong><br/>To take the first clumsy steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”The sonnet is, perhaps, the form least likely to leap to mind when one s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>many experiments</strong><br/>I carried out a wide range of experiments. The bulk of my paper today will discuss the most fruitful/successful of those experiments, but the pool from which I selected this experiment was broad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>why no texts?</strong><br/>Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>key terms</strong><br/>The key terms for my approach are “modeling” and “deformance.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>McCarty summary</strong><br/>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the c...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sam&McG summary</strong><br/>But if my spreadsheet and graphs model “the Gothic novel”, they also deform it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I've made</strong><br/>[I’ve made a deformed model of Tracy’s bibliography, which is itself a deformed model of the Gothic]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Motifs</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>70 pie charts</strong><br/>So basically I made 70 pie charts. [Preliminary mention of what I will argue about these pie charts.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>biggest charts</strong><br/>The defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>39 neutral charts</strong><br/>Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>29 male charts</strong><br/>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them imdicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effe...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>horror, incest</strong><br/>The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." Thi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>not a binary</strong><br/>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.<br/>
However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the provi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>libertines, miniatures</strong><br/>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Genres</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>not horror/terror</strong><br/>However, I will argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. Here I turn to Frederick Frank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>gothic types</strong><br/>Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” [In order to deal with this, I broke down the types into “tags”]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>main genres</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Radcliffe/Monk</strong><br/>Frank directly identifies many works as imitations of other works. 12 works are identified as ‘Radcliffian’ (18 counting Radcliffe’s own 6 works), 3 as imitations of The Monk, and 5 more as ‘monastic shockers’ (4 and 6 when The Monk is counted twice and included in both categories). The gender breakdowns of these categories are precisely what we would expect: all 18 Radcliffian novels are by women, and 7 of the 9 novels identified as Monk-ian or as monastic shockers are by men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>horror/terror</strong><br/>However, this binary is not at all what we see when examining Frank’s categorization of horror and terror. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women: sentimental</strong><br/>Instead, the main gendered trend we see is the female dominance of ‘sentimental’ novels.</p>

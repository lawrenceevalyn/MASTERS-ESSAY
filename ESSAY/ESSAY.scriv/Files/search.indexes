            <Text>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic. </Text>

            <Text>Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX).

Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, may be subtly different from each other, but [TRANSITION]. I divided each “Gothic type” into a set of tags, and tallied the use of each tag the same way I tallied Tracy’s motifs. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” (315), was tagged as “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Similarly, Radcliffe’s Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” (302), tagged as “high,” “Gothic,” “terror mode,” “horror mode,” and “Radcliffean.” By allowing each individual phrase of Frank’s ‘Gothic types’ to become its own tag, rather than attempting to define my own categories and sort each genre types into them, I allowed the most important categories to emerge on their own.

            <Text>The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high or pure” Gothic (64); “terror mode” (63); “history” (30); “domestic” fiction (28); “horror mode” (25); “sentimental” fiction (24); “Radcliffean” novels (19, which includes 6 novels by Radcliffe); “chapbook” stories (17); “natural” Gothics, consisting of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary murders (11); “Schauerromantik” novels (11); and “Monk-ian” novels classified either as imitations of The Monk or as monastic shockers (9, including The Monk).
The sample is dominated by the high Gothic and by the terror mode, both of which are largely gender-neutral affairs. However, horror is not nearly so evenly matched against terror as we might have hoped — nor as male-dominated.

            <Title>male gothic</Title>
            <Text>Nonetheless, an identificable gendered school does emerge: 29 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men. To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</Text>

            <Title>female gothic</Title>
            <Text>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; [the Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the Everybody Gothic]. More than half of the 70 motifs not strongly gendered. Three — “dueling and other single combat,” “elopement (any),” and “relative, lost, discovery of” — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. Only one of those 5 charts shows a notable contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. </Text>

This bright yellow rectangle suggests that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information, but the gendered trend suggested by Frank’s gothic types is not defined by flashy plot-devices like skulls and incest. Instead, the emerging ‘school of Radcliffe’ suggested here is deeply tied to the sentimental novel. To be precise about the nature of this connection, I [made several pivot tables] along the same principles of [predictive utility] that structured my examination of Tracy’s motifs. Approaching from one direction, 50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic. If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, 25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean.

            <Title>reject realist teleology</Title>
            <Text>These earlier approaches have largely been superceded now, partly for their now-charming willingness to render emotional judments on authors — Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95), for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful — but more subtly problematic in these earlier works is the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. J.M.S Thompkins, for example, founds his dismissal of the Gothic in his assumption that the ‘goal’ of the novel itself is to become realist: “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probable, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern" (57). However, we can reject this assumption without rejecting Thompkins’ observation that ‘fantastic’ plot elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it: in the Gothic, he argues, "the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-teller's stock in trade” (57), rendering these stories [as functionally the same as what he terms the sensational novel.]</Text>

            <Text>This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but a self-defining process. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), [explain this idea]. Genres function by bridging the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). 

Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Frow concludes that “what we learn, in ‘doing’ genre (in performing and transforming it) is the values we share or don’t share with others and the means with which to challenge or defend them” (144).

            <Title>return to older criticism</Title>
            <Text>My results here suggest a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels— rather than German horror stories— as the forbears of the Gothic. [These frameworks are sensitive to different aspects of the Gothic.] Ernest Baker, for example, argues that “[t]he sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (175). In this history of the genre, [German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre]: “Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors” (Baker 176). [Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of varying gradations of fear.] [What Baker is sensitive to is the emotional content.]</Text>

            <Title>Gendered Gothics</Title>
            <Text>As the first step toward a more comprehensive perspective, therefore, I have begun by surveying the 208 novels described in detail in Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs, treating these texts as an approximate model of the Gothic in this period. For each 'motif' identified by Tracy as appearing in a large enough number of works to be worths examining in further detail, I have calculated how often it has been deployed by men versus women. The question is thus framed, not as, "what do men usually write about?" but rather, "what motifs, if any, serve as useful predictors for an author's gender?"-- a framing which does not attempt to define pre-determined categories, but rather places its emphasis on potential points of difference, and which therefore makes its first task proving the existence of that difference.
At first glance, the gendered differences are not, in fact, particularly striking. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.
Moreover, the motifs characterized by a strong contrast tend to appear in relatively few works, making up a correspondingly minor part of the average reader's experience of the genre. Of the five most-represented motifs-- fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions-- the suicide mentions show the greatest contrast, with a ratio of 61% male authors to 39% female.
On the whole, then, male and female writers seem to have more commonalities than they do differences.</Text>

            <Text>“Most critics who have given any attention to Mrs. Radcliffe as a novelist have decided that she is important chiefly for her use of the supernatural, and for her emphasis upon landscape. Although she is, indeed, a pioneer in both these fields, it has seemed to me that, after all, her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure.” (McIntyre 77)
“Mrs. Radcliffe’s method is founded upon the principle // which Walpole tried with imperfect success to embody in his work — the principle of suspence” (79-80)
Radcliffe’s peers are “Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mrs. Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith” (93)
“One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: ‘This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s /Simple Story/.’ The expression, ‘this kind,’ is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” (McIntyre 94) “…the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art. Mrs. Radcliffe, it is true, was strictly moral… but her main interest does not lie there.”</Text>

            <Title>Male and Female Characters</Title>
            <Text>For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women. Not all of the individual motifs involve a particularly noteworthy contrast, but in general, monasteries are much more often discussed by men, and convents only weakly more by women...
...with a similar trend in clergymen versus abbesses and nuns.
However, when it comes to libertines versus loose women, each is more often written about by authors of the opposite gender.
Overall, then, it seems that women are reluctant to describe gender-segregated societies and spaces involving men, but feel the opposite impulse when it comes to disapproving of men's sexual activity.
Men are also much more interested in their own gender than women when we look at the gendered subjects of activities like abduction and fainting. Both are generally a female affair, and female abductees and fainters are written about by both men and women. However, the minority of male abductees and fainters have been written about more often by men.
This, then, is our first surprise: rather than finding each gender writing mostly about itself, women appear to be equal-opportunity subject matter, whereas men are mostly of interest to men.</Text>

            <Title>The Female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>When we examine those motifs which do not themselves encode a gender, we discover another surprise: of the 31 motifs that involve a notable disparity, the only two in which women outnumber men are libertines and miniature portraits. The remaining 29 are all examples of motifs used primarily by men.
If we go looking for the Female Gothic plot-- in female vulnerability, or in the restoration of broken family ties, for example-- the results are underwhelming.
And if we turn our attention to those images-- like blood, caves, and subterranean passages-- which have been simplistically aligned with the feminine, we find that, in the larger body of Gothic works, these have much more often appeared in works by men.
Caves and subterranean passages have perhaps been the most misperceived. Although Ann Radcliffe, critically credited with defining and refining the tropes of the female Gothic, makes heavy use of both motifs, she is one of very few female authors to do so. When her three caves and six subterranean passages are excluded from the sample, both motifs become even more decidedly male.
Perhaps these men are, like Henry Walpole in The Castle of Otranto, presenting underground spaces as avenues of flight or sanctuary for distressed women; even if so, the association is no longer likely to be, as early feminist critic Juliann Fleenor characterized the Female Gothic, an expression of an unnameable conflict with patriarchy (28). It is more likely, instead, that these caverns have appeared as the secret meeting-places of conspirators, as part of a German-influenced tradition of tales about criminal underworlds and evil Illuminati.</Text>

            <Title>The Male Gothic</Title>
            <Text>A male interest in crime and conspiracy is also suggested by the predominantly-male authorship of banditti and piracy, and Inquisition and secrecy.
However, even more striking are those motifs which suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects.
Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.
The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</Text>

            <Title>Conclusions</Title>
            <Text>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.
However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the province of women. Ann Radcliffe may have founded the terror-Gothic school, but women and men appear to have followed in her footsteps equally. Moreover, the existence of two opposing schools does not prove the equal footing of those schools; setting aside questions of gender to look at the relative prominence of various motifs, readers are vastly more likely to encounter the temporary terrors of abduction and confinement than the more permanent horrors of bones and corpses. Even death, which could reasonably appear in either school of novel despite its horrifying potential, is unexpectedly scarce compared to the widespread fainting.
In the wider context of the Gothic, then, it seems that the terror-Gothic and the Female Gothic are, in fact, simply the Gothic-- with the male horror-Gothic as the outlier subgenre in which an author's writing has been shaped by his gender.
These results remain preliminary, at least until a sample can be assembled which involves more texts at fewer levels of mediation. However, they serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. Research at a large scale provides a unique opportunity to compare the critical perception of a body of work to contemporary readers' experience of that same body; here, it has focused only on one specific way of seeking gendered imagery, but future projects can easily expand to investigate plot structure or chronology, and in a few years perhaps even style. And in the mean time, those scholars of the Gothic who study deeply only a few texts at a time can discuss their observations regarding potential expressions of a male viewpoint without needing to seek its exact analogue among female writers.</Text>

            <Text>Punter, David. The Literature of Terror: A History of Gothic Fictions from 1765 to the Present Day. London and New York: Longman, 1980. Print.
	This book, perhaps the first to pay serious scholarly attention to the wide reach of the Gothic, puts forth “a set of descriptions which will both help to identify the historical Gothic while suggesting reasons for its survival and for the multifarious forms in which it has survived” (20-21). Examining works from the birth of the Gothic to his present day, Punter identifies the unifying element of the Gothic as fear, expressed through a “dialectic of comfort and disturbance” and “a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423). In his final proposal of “a theory of the Gothic,” he argues that “Gothic fiction becomes a process of cultural self-analysis, and the images which it throws up become the dream-figures of a troubled social group.” with “the glance over the shoulder”—a nostalgic attempt to understand the past—as the inherent function of the ghost-story. The Gothic, “at the psychological interface between the well-ordered psyche and its rebel subjects,” may not provide an escape, but can provide “refuge while at the same time undermining the architectural fabric” of the bourgeois ideology which attempts to “naturalise” the unstable situation of society (425-6).

            <Title>Price</Title>
            <Text>Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument.
Just as her rational explanations allowed Radcliffe to incorporate empowering myths unapologetically into modern literature, so too do her “embellishments” allow her to demonstrate her literary seriousness. Price herself notes that the prevalence in the novel of material that ought not be skipped, particularly her original poetry, “differentiates Radcliffe,” in reviewers’ minds, “from mere entertainers” (97). But Radcliffe doesn’t simply write and quote poetry: she also fills her text with landscapes and architecture, drawing on the literary traditions of travel narratives; with moral contemplations that wouldn’t be out of place in popular sentimental novels; with dramatic structures and staging that owe an obvious debt to the theatre; and, of course, with all the traditions of romance. Even the frustrating digressions of her comic servants come straight from Shakespeare. Walpole had, much earlier, “designedly” introduced bumbling servants based on the model of a “higher authority,” namely, “the great master of nature, SHAKESPEARE” (22). Indeed, Walpole provides a direct description of the Gothic-as-new-Classic framework, comparing Shakespeare to “the Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus… inserted a little boy measuring his thumb” (22). But whereas Walpole must explain and justify his lineage, Radcliffe allows it to go without saying. Walpole’s preface points to specific characters, and scenes, but Radcliffe attributes her epigraphs, whichever play they are drawn from or character they are spoken by, to, simply, “Shakespeare.” In the strength of her unifying vision, Radcliffe is like the Romantic poet, discussed by Tilar Mazzeo; she subordinates all her literary borrowings to a singular goal, ‘mastering’ them with her individual genius, and thus transforms them. Udolpho’s “beauties” go beyond embellishment to create a deeply intertextual novel, which is built upon diverse foundations but stands upon its own authority.

            <Text>The novel of sentiment:
“Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox, both brought up in the school of Richardson, yielded eventually to the taste for something less humdrum than domestic realism, and at the same time, far from renouncing or abating their fits of emotional indulgence and their pervading sentimentality, screwed up the tension, and dragged their lovers and heroines through stranger trials and more sensational adventures than could be counted among ordinary contingencies.” (Baker 91)
“Richardson had founded the English novel of sensibility; but, after all, sensibility was ot an object with Richardson, who wrote to inculcate prudence and self-control. … But sensibility soon became an object of engrossing interest and an end in itself” (Baker 95)

“That amoral person Sterne cared nothing for edification… He fondled his sensibility, he never tired of playing with it; he was a debauched sentimentalist, aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95 Baker)

“It would be inexact to say that the influence of Richardson was waning towards the end of the seventeen-sixties; if his novels were tending to go out of favour and to be superseded by new kinds of sentimental fiction, it was simply that he had established a cult and his devotees had gone beyong him.” (Baker 96) - Sterne and Mackenzie as prime examples
“It was the French Richardsonians, pursuing a trend already observable in their own lierature, who first outwent their acknowledged leader.” (Baker 97)

“Some signs of the romantic scene-painting soon to be a marked characteristic of Gothic fiction are observable in Julia de Roubigné, and may reasonably be credited to the example of Prévost, who loved to set the stage gloomily for the experiences of his ill-starred lovers.” (Baker 110) “sensitivity to the sombre and dearful, which was presently to reach a fever-pitch in Charlotte Smith and Mrs Radcliffe” (Baker 110)

“moral improvement was decidedly the chief end that he [i.e., Mackenzie] envisaged in estimating the value of fiction; in other words, he takes exactly the same view as Dr Johnson and most other critics of that day” (Baker 112)
but Mackenzie doesn’t consider himself a sentimental novelist?

Henry Brooke more sentimental than Mackenzie — “Brook’s hero and his friends burst into tears alike in sympathy with grief and at any example of human affection or of nobility of soul.” (Baker 115)

novel of sensibility is mostly a more intense novel of sentiment (Baker 120). At first, “Sensibility accepted the rule of reason” (Baker 121), but over time “though fiction came by various stages nearer to life,” “In the later romances… sensibility was forced like a hot-house plant, and grew more and more artificial, affected, pretentious” (121).

“The novels of Prévost contain all the materials for the novel of sensibility. They also have in them a good part of the material that was son to be utilized in what came to be nicknamed the Gothic novel.” (Baker 130) primarily “his gloomy scene-painting”
“Prévost was less than half a realist, and much more than half a romancer” (Baker 131) …a variety of French authors who build on &amp; exaggerate Prévost

“The most distinguished English novel in line of descent from Richardson, which shows unmistakable traces of some infusion of blood from… Prévost… is that novel by Mrs Frances Sheridan, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph… (1761)” (Baker 141)

The History of the English Novel, Volume V: The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance

Enormous interlude on Fanny Burney, who “provides an interlude of natural comedy in the long monotone of solemn and pretentious sentimentalism” (154)

“Mystery and Wonder, Fear and Suspense, Sensation and Terror, are some of the labels affixed by different historians to the romantic novels that traded in one or another, or in all of these excitements, during the last few decades of the eighteenth century. The rather absurd term ‘Gothic’ is perhaps more convenient, and may be allowed to include both those than contented themselves with a discreet use of fear and suspense, and also those which sought the grosser sensations of terror and brutally aimed to make the flesh creep.” (Baker 175)
“It was a term applied first in derision… Then it was amiably accepted by Walpole and others, who confessed a fondness for what they called Gothic, little as they understood the real nature of what they admired, and grotesque as were their attempts to imitate it.”

“The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (Baker 175)
“Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.” (Baker 176)</Text>

            <Text>“The usual object of interpretation is ‘meaning,’ or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable … In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and … some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ‘for’ the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essentual idea(s).” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)
They “propose… another way of engaging imaginative work” which “moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into … performative operations.” They argue that “concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)

Emily Dickinson’s habit of reading poems backward is “a spendid model for… deformative criticism” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). “Her procedure… follows a romantic awareness… that poems lose their vital force when they succumb to familiarization” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). Despite affinity with modernist techniques of estrangement, “Dickinson’s critical model is performative, not intellectual” (Samuels &amp; McGann 29). “Reading Backward short circuits the sign of prose transparency and reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 30)

“First, imaginative work has an elective affinity with performance: it is organized as rhetoric and poiesis rather than as exposition and information-transmission. Because this is so, it always lies open to deformative moves.” Second, “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33) “Here we want to point out that lines of performative and deformative critical activity have always existed,” including “Elaborate scholarly editions” and “translations” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33).
“Because ‘a translation [involves] the necessity of settling many points without discussion,’ [D.G.] Rosetti observes, it ‘remains perhaps the most direct form of commentary’ that can be brought to literary work.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34). For people who dislike Rosetti’s translation, “The critical thoroughness and integrity… is exactly the problem.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34).

“Deformative scholarship is all but forbidden, the thought of it either // irresponsible or damaging to critical seriousness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34-5), likely because the prime example is “Forgery” (35) and the category also includes “mistaken and deviant readings produced… by students unaware of an ignorance in their … understanding” (35). But they set these aside in favor of “interpretive deformation,” as exemplified by “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (Samuels and McGann 35).
“The reluctance shows… that interpreters — even radical ones — do not commonly locate hermeneutic vitality in the documentary features of literary works. Because meaning is assumed to develop as a linguistic event, critical deformance plays itself out in the field of the signifieds.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Critical and interpretive limits are thus regularly established” to excluse consideration of “the physical artifact, whose stability and integrity is taken as inbiolable” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35).
“From an interpretive point of view, this assumption brackets off from attention crutical features of imaginative works… so basic and conventionally governed — they are alphabetical and diacritical. they are the rules for character formation, character arrangement, and textual space, as well as for the structural forms of words, phrases, and higher morphemic and phonemic units— that readers tend to treat them as preinterpetive and precitical. In truth, however, they comprise the operating system of language” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Linguists, semioticians, bibliographers, and cognitive theorists regularly explore these territories, but their work is not normally concerned with interpretation in the customary sense — that is, with explaining aesthetic and stylistic features of works” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).
“But this enlargement of the subject matter of criticism does not define the most significant function of deformative operations. Far most important is the stochastic process it entails. … When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “…we are brought to a critical position in which we can imaine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work,” so that “customary rules are… held in abeyance, to be chosen among… to be followed or nor as one decides,” resulting in “the dramatic exposure of subjectivity as a live and highly informative option of interpretive commentary” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).

They focus on “poetic deformations,” “organized into four types:” (36) reordered, isolating, altering, and adding (36-7). They focus on reordering and isolating poems, taking Wallace Stevens as their experimental ground.

“deformance does not banish interpretation. The reversed text is still subject to, still giving of, interpretive readings. Deformance does want to show that the poem’s intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40).

“we may usefull regard all criticism and interpretation as deformance. Scholars murder to dissect, as Wordsworth famously observed” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46) *** JUST LIKE LEAH PRICE’S ARGUMENT —> Despite approaching the matter from very different projects, [both] have reached a similar conclusion about the [state of criticism] which makes my own approach differ not in fundamenal kind from the norm, but in degree and in [reflexiveness? obviousness?].
“Interpretation is the application of scientia to poiesis, or the effort to elucidate one discourse form in terms of another.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46).
“Interpretation for della Volpe… always displays a gap between the work being examined and the student. But this gap does not represent a failure of criticism, or even a mysticism of poiesis. It locates the source and end and test of the art being examined” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47). The gap comes into being as soon as the critic must paraphrase the text. “Interpretation, then, is a constellation of paraphrases that evolve… from an uncritical to a critical moment” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47)
In della Volpe’s work, “to attempt a socio-historical paraphrase is to experiment with the poetical work, to subject it to a hypothesis of its meanings. As in any scientific experiment with natural phenomena, the engagement with the ordinary phenomenon inevitably exposes the limits of the hypothesis, and ultimaely returns us to an even more acute sense of the phenomena we desire to understand. … By contrast,” their deformances “place primary emphasis on the preconceptual elements of the text” because “social and historical formations seem to us far less determinate, far more open to arbitrary and imaginative construction, than the appear in della Volpe” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works… allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49) 
“To essay a more direct application of ‘interpretation’ to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment withthe work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. … one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)
“To deliberately accept the inevitable failure of interpretive ‘adequacy’ is to work toward discovering new interpretive virtues… This attitude toward literate comprehension, and the kind of criticism it inspires, gains its power by baring its own devices.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)</Text>

            <Text>Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel. </Text>

            <Text>My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy’s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy’s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various “motifs” can be found. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as a simple starting point for in-depth explorations of particular topics. However, a modern spreadsheet program renders trivially easy what would have been a monumental feat of correlation in 1981 when Tracy’s work was published, and I have adapted her index to a different purpose: charting the genders of the indexed authors, I have asked which motifs — if any — can serve as predictors of the authorial gender of a given text. If we know that a novel has a subterannean passage in it, for example, or a monastery, or a prophetic dream, do we know anything about who wrote it? This particular framing of the question— not “what do men and women each write about?” but “what, if it appears, can be used to distinguish between men and women?” — was chosen to avoid [[FIND THE ARTICLE ABOUT UNPROVABLE CIRCULAR HYPOTHESES]]</Text>

            <Text>However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank’s bibliography, The First Gothics, which includes a classification of each text’s “Gothic type”. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” In order to render his assessments useful for my own project, however, it was necessary to reduce his minute distinctions into broader categories. This process of reduction became, in its own right, my second experiment: at each stage of my gradual process of simplification, I asked, “Which distinctions of genre appear to be borne out by differences in authorship or content?” This process of reduction also led to my second [result]: in my historicist reading of the bulk of the early Gothic the operant genre distinctions are not really to do with horror vs terror, but rather the domestic vs High Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from, for example,  Fleenor’s societal emphasis on relationship to patriarchy to a more literary emphasis in Wallace &amp; Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions.

Fleenor: It argues that, whereas terror-Gothic novels relate to other Gothics, horror-Gothic relates “directly to a patriarchal paradigm—that the woman is motherless, that she is a defective male, and that she has for her God the male, not the absolute” (7). It emphasizes the Gothic as literature “written and consistently read by women” (7), and argues that “…the Gothic form allows us – as readers and as writers – to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name” (28), i.e., the conflict between a woman and her prescribed societal role.
In his essay “‘Mother Radcliffe’: Ann Radcliffe and the Female Gothic,” Robert Miles argues that The Italian, as a direct response to The Monk, is able to make use of both Female and Male Gothic “narrative grammar” (56). </Text>

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

—

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Text>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (CITE), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (CITE). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus of full texts for famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (CITE); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions.</Text>

My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs and Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies” and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation.” After carrying out a wide range of experiments, I have selected two of the most fruitful to discuss in depth: I have charted the gendered use of 70 Gothic ‘motifs’ identified by Tracy, and [explored Frank’s classifications of the same novels’ various ‘Gothic types’]. Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. I don’t wish to replicate this emphasis of attention. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the ‘school of Radcliffe’; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]</Text>

[Over the course of two large-scale literary ‘experiments,’ in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I have asked what schools, if any, make themselves apparents, and whether there is cause to believe that the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same.] [My preliminary results suggest that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream.]</Text>

            <Text>Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, [it] is no longer a model at all, but the [thing itself]; tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study (too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence), and so models are always “fictional” (McCarty CITE).  “Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness.” (McCarty CITE). [The key idea is that models are constructed, and the construction of a model makes it sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others.]</Text>

            <Title>voraciousness - Frow</Title>
            <Text>[My interest in placing Radcliffe back into the broadest possible context is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers the way that ‘literary fiction’ is separated from ‘romance novels’ today.
This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but a self-defining process. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategicall fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Accordingly, any investigation of Radcliffe’s use of genre must begin with an understanding of what she’s using.</Text>

            <Title>why no texts?</Title>
            <Text>Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which only exist for the most critically-examined novels. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the ‘school of Radcliffe’; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]</Text>

            <Title>29 male charts</Title>
            <Text>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them indicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. [This accords with existing discussions of Matthew Lewis’s Male Gothic]. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.</Text>

            <Title>modeling - Samuels &amp; McGann</Title>
            <Text>So, pragmatic reasons are one reason a model might diverge in “isomorphic exactness” (McCarty CITE) from that which it models; the other is what McCarty terms “distortion” (CITE), but which Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle  mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation paraphrases and distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations. 
 
they class “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” — [which is basically my stuff] — as non-interpretive (26).
[Therefore, that stuff that didn’t look “interpretive” actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]
Accordingly, if my spreadsheet and graphs model “the Gothic novel”, they also deform it.</Text>

            <Title>Tracy's goals</Title>
            <Text>I began with the ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’ included at the end of Ann Tracy’s bibliography. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is “scholars with particular interests” (195), such as “garden as a scene of temptation” (200), who wish to locate new books to close-read. Accordingly, Tracy has prioritized presenting a wide range of distinctive individual motifs, such as “hand, cold, seizing heroine” (200), rather than broad categories. Indeed, her preface to the index indicates that highly popular motifs were intentionally excluded: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only” (195), and castles have similarly been ignored. Tracy’s omissions work at cross-purposes to my own approach — despite Tracy’s assertion that castles “are so pervasive a device that no purpose can be served by the recitation of two hundred novels that have them” (195), I would have liked to compare them to manor houses, cottages, abbeys, and convents — and I have had to discard much of her work. 138 of her motifs have been disregarded entirely, because they appear in fewer than twenty novels. Additionally, most of the motifs which she breaks down into detailed sub-categories have been reduced back to their stem category. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine” (203), but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader category of “poison (any),” which applies to [X] novels and thus allows [subcategorization].</Text>

            <Text>Moreover, the more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [relate back to critical conversation? is there somebody who has defined the Gothic based on fear itself?] Only one of those 5 charts shows a notable contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. </Text>

            <Text>The more we seek a neat binary in the model, the more we find that it is unbalanced. For example, on the basis of the male-dominated authorship of books containing male fainters, male abductees, and clergymen, it might be tempting to argue that each gender write more often about itself. However, there is no corresponding evidence that women write more about women (female fainters, female abductees, nuns and abbesses).</Text>

            <Text>The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</Text>

            <Text>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic. </Text>

            <Title>29 male charts</Title>
            <Text>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them imdicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.</Text>

            <Title>Gendered Gothics</Title>
            <Text>As the first step toward a more comprehensive perspective, therefore, I have begun by surveying the 208 novels described in detail in Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs, treating these texts as an approximate model of the Gothic in this period. For each 'motif' identified by Tracy as appearing in a large enough number of works to be worths examining in further detail, I have calculated how often it has been deployed by men versus women. The question is thus framed, not as, "what do men usually write about?" but rather, "what motifs, if any, serve as useful predictors for an author's gender?"-- a framing which does not attempt to define pre-determined categories, but rather places its emphasis on potential points of difference, and which therefore makes its first task proving the existence of that difference.
At first glance, the gendered differences are not, in fact, particularly striking. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.
Moreover, the motifs characterized by a strong contrast tend to appear in relatively few works, making up a correspondingly minor part of the average reader's experience of the genre. Of the five most-represented motifs-- fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions-- the suicide mentions show the greatest contrast, with a ratio of 61% male authors to 39% female.
On the whole, then, male and female writers seem to have more commonalities than they do differences.</Text>

            <Title>women: Radcliffean</Title>
            <Text>And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, does bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. This bright yellow rectangle suggests that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information.</Text>

            <Title>Male and Female Characters</Title>
            <Text>For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women. Not all of the individual motifs involve a particularly noteworthy contrast, but in general, monasteries are much more often discussed by men, and convents only weakly more by women...
...with a similar trend in clergymen versus abbesses and nuns.
However, when it comes to libertines versus loose women, each is more often written about by authors of the opposite gender.
Overall, then, it seems that women are reluctant to describe gender-segregated societies and spaces involving men, but feel the opposite impulse when it comes to disapproving of men's sexual activity.
Men are also much more interested in their own gender than women when we look at the gendered subjects of activities like abduction and fainting. Both are generally a female affair, and female abductees and fainters are written about by both men and women. However, the minority of male abductees and fainters have been written about more often by men.
This, then, is our first surprise: rather than finding each gender writing mostly about itself, women appear to be equal-opportunity subject matter, whereas men are mostly of interest to men.</Text>

            <Title>The Female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>When we examine those motifs which do not themselves encode a gender, we discover another surprise: of the 31 motifs that involve a notable disparity, the only two in which women outnumber men are libertines and miniature portraits. The remaining 29 are all examples of motifs used primarily by men.
If we go looking for the Female Gothic plot-- in female vulnerability, or in the restoration of broken family ties, for example-- the results are underwhelming.
And if we turn our attention to those images-- like blood, caves, and subterranean passages-- which have been simplistically aligned with the feminine, we find that, in the larger body of Gothic works, these have much more often appeared in works by men.
Caves and subterranean passages have perhaps been the most misperceived. Although Ann Radcliffe, critically credited with defining and refining the tropes of the female Gothic, makes heavy use of both motifs, she is one of very few female authors to do so. When her three caves and six subterranean passages are excluded from the sample, both motifs become even more decidedly male.
Perhaps these men are, like Henry Walpole in The Castle of Otranto, presenting underground spaces as avenues of flight or sanctuary for distressed women; even if so, the association is no longer likely to be, as early feminist critic Juliann Fleenor characterized the Female Gothic, an expression of an unnameable conflict with patriarchy (28). It is more likely, instead, that these caverns have appeared as the secret meeting-places of conspirators, as part of a German-influenced tradition of tales about criminal underworlds and evil Illuminati.</Text>

            <Title>The Male Gothic</Title>
            <Text>A male interest in crime and conspiracy is also suggested by the predominantly-male authorship of banditti and piracy, and Inquisition and secrecy.
However, even more striking are those motifs which suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects.
Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.

            <Title>Conclusions</Title>
            <Text>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.
However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the province of women. Ann Radcliffe may have founded the terror-Gothic school, but women and men appear to have followed in her footsteps equally. Moreover, the existence of two opposing schools does not prove the equal footing of those schools; setting aside questions of gender to look at the relative prominence of various motifs, readers are vastly more likely to encounter the temporary terrors of abduction and confinement than the more permanent horrors of bones and corpses. Even death, which could reasonably appear in either school of novel despite its horrifying potential, is unexpectedly scarce compared to the widespread fainting.
In the wider context of the Gothic, then, it seems that the terror-Gothic and the Female Gothic are, in fact, simply the Gothic-- with the male horror-Gothic as the outlier subgenre in which an author's writing has been shaped by his gender.
These results remain preliminary, at least until a sample can be assembled which involves more texts at fewer levels of mediation. However, they serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. Research at a large scale provides a unique opportunity to compare the critical perception of a body of work to contemporary readers' experience of that same body; here, it has focused only on one specific way of seeking gendered imagery, but future projects can easily expand to investigate plot structure or chronology, and in a few years perhaps even style. And in the mean time, those scholars of the Gothic who study deeply only a few texts at a time can discuss their observations regarding potential expressions of a male viewpoint without needing to seek its exact analogue among female writers.</Text>

            <Text>Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel. </Text>

            <Text>My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy’s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy’s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various “motifs” can be found. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as a simple starting point for in-depth explorations of particular topics. However, a modern spreadsheet program renders trivially easy what would have been a monumental feat of correlation in 1981 when Tracy’s work was published, and I have adapted her index to a different purpose: charting the genders of the indexed authors, I have asked which motifs — if any — can serve as predictors of the authorial gender of a given text. If we know that a novel has a subterannean passage in it, for example, or a monastery, or a prophetic dream, do we know anything about who wrote it? This particular framing of the question— not “what do men and women each write about?” but “what, if it appears, can be used to distinguish between men and women?” — was chosen to avoid [[FIND THE ARTICLE ABOUT UNPROVABLE CIRCULAR HYPOTHESES]]</Text>

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Text>To take the first clumsy steps toward that large-scale examination, I have deployed data visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs; my experimental method is informed by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation” and by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies.”</Text>

            <Text>However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank’s bibliography, The First Gothics, which includes a classification of each text’s “Gothic type”. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” In order to render his assessments useful for my own project, however, it was necessary to reduce his minute distinctions into broader categories. This process of reduction became, in its own right, my second experiment: at each stage of my gradual process of simplification, I asked, “Which distinctions of genre appear to be borne out by differences in authorship or content?” This process of reduction also led to my second [result]: in my historicist reading of the bulk of the early Gothic the operant genre distinctions are not really to do with horror vs terror, but rather the domestic vs High Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>McCarty summary</Title>
            <Text>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (CITE), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (CITE). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus of full texts for famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (CITE); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may</Text>

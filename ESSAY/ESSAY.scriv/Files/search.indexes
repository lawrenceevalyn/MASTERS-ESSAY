            <Title>conclusions</Title>
            <Text>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic. </Text>

            <Text>Influenced by Joanna Drucker’s warnings that [graphs] too easily give the impression of a quantitative and objective truth which cannot exist, particularly in humanities [investigations] (“Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display”), I have [made my graphic design decisions procedurally generated]. [The goal is for the visual presentation of each chart to qualitatively indicate [stuff], and thus make them a fruitful body for interpretive readings.] I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually represent Tracy’s treatment of each motif as a self-contained field which may or may not have distinct divisions within it. The size of each circle reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two colors in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages.  I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose starkly-constrasted colours nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif [is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps], its chart doesn’t have two camps. [All these design choices further emphasize my model’s sensitivity to each motif’s gendered use.] [Each chart is able to immediately provide an answer to the question, “does knowing that this motif appears in a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book’s author?”]</Text>

            <Title>tagging methods</Title>
            <Text>Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). [They were meant to be read by a human who wants to know more about an individual book, not mechanically used to map similarities between a large number of books]. Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, may be subtly different from each other, but [TRANSITION]. I divided each “Gothic type” into a set of tags, and tallied the use of each tag the same way I tallied Tracy’s motifs. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” (315), was tagged as “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Similarly, Radcliffe’s Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” (302), tagged as “high,” “Gothic,” “terror mode,” “horror mode,” and “Radcliffean.” By allowing each individual phrase of Frank’s ‘Gothic types’ to become its own tag, rather than attempting to define my own categories and sort each genre types into them, I allowed the most important categories to emerge on their own. [The axes of distinction to which my model is sensitive are thus based on what is actually seen.]</Text>

            <Title>main genres</Title>
            <Text>The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high or pure” Gothic (64); “terror mode” (63); “history” (30); “domestic” fiction (28); “horror mode” (25); “sentimental” fiction (24); “Radcliffean” novels (19, which includes 6 novels by Radcliffe); “chapbook” stories (17); “natural” Gothics, consisting of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary murders (11); “Schauerromantik” novels (11); and “Monk-ian” novels classified either as imitations of The Monk or as monastic shockers (9, including The Monk).
The sample is dominated by the high Gothic and by the terror mode, both of which are largely gender-neutral affairs. However, horror is not nearly so evenly matched against terror as we might have hoped — nor as male-dominated. And mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole: history, domestic, sentimental, naturalized, Schauerromantik.</Text>

            <Title>Frank's model</Title>
            <Text>In order to better define that Gothic mainstream, I turned to a second bibliography, which classified novels by their ‘Gothic type’; here, too, the unbalanced nature of our attempted binary becomes obvious. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use than my own quantification: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, Frank provides 131 unique classifications. Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. [Whereas Tracy treated her motifs as independent and stable, Frank is not interested in the Gothic types themselves.] [Similarly, his “Critical Synopsis” of each text is not interested in recapitulating the details of the novels’ events. Instead, each synopsis describes the origins of any literary borrowings, briefly discusses the plot in terms of its structural tropes, and places the work’s attitude into a broader context.]
The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearence turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as his own first sentence [suggests]:
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107)
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs… spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf,” which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people. Unlike Tracy, then, Frank is interested not simply in what happens, but in how it happens. [His object of study is the text, and the connections between it and its most closely related texts.] His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, describes the novels as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements)” (204), tying it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traced systematically — no helpful index like Tracy’s attempts to collect them. Instead, [his Gothic types model the Gothic as [a web of connections].] </Text>

            <Title>male gothic</Title>
            <Text>And indeed, an identifiable gendered school does emerge at a glance: 29 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men. To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</Text>

            <Title>female gothic</Title>
            <Text>In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the ‘Female Gothic’ is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; [the Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the Everybody Gothic]. More than half of the 70 motifs not strongly gendered. Three — “dueling and other single combat,” “elopement (any),” and “relative, lost, discovery of” — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. Only one of those 5 charts shows a notable contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. </Text>

            <Text>Indeed, in accordance with the conclusions I drew from Tracy’s motifs, the Male Gothic operates as a distinct minority of the genre as a whole. Even including ‘Monk-ian’ in this list requires a bit of fudging; this category includes 3 texts named as imitations of The Monk, 5 texts named as ‘monastic shockers,’ and The Monk itself — and even then this only provides 9 novels, below my initial arbitrary threshold of 10.</Text>

            <Text>To be precise about the nature of this connection, I [made several pivot tables] along the same principles of [predictive utility] that structured my examination of Tracy’s motifs. Approaching from one direction, 50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic. If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, 25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean. Gothic types which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized or explained, and high Gothic, in that order. This particular [picture of the Female Gothic] may explain the comparison of Udolpho to Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzled Clara McIntyre. In response to a review which declated Udolpho to be “the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s Simple Story,” McIntyre is taken aback by the expression “this kind” (94). She says, “The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story” (94). McIntyre begins to draw a connection based on “the ethical purpose of the book,” which in Inchbald is “rather too obvious for successful art,” but decides that although Radcliffe’s writing “it is true, was strictly moral,” Radcliffe’s “main interest” does not lie in moralizing, and Udolpho’s project is along a different line.

Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), [explain this idea]. Genres function by bridging the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). 

Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Frow concludes that “what we learn, in ‘doing’ genre (in performing and transforming it) is the values we share or don’t share with others and the means with which to challenge or defend them” (144).

            <Title>return to older criticism</Title>
            <Text>My results here suggest a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels— rather than German horror stories— as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, argues that “[t]he sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (175). In this history of the genre, [German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre]: “Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors” (Baker 176). [Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of varying gradations of fear.] [What Baker is sensitive to is the emotional content.]</Text>

            <Title>Gendered Gothics</Title>
            <Text>As the first step toward a more comprehensive perspective, therefore, I have begun by surveying the 208 novels described in detail in Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs, treating these texts as an approximate model of the Gothic in this period. For each 'motif' identified by Tracy as appearing in a large enough number of works to be worths examining in further detail, I have calculated how often it has been deployed by men versus women. The question is thus framed, not as, "what do men usually write about?" but rather, "what motifs, if any, serve as useful predictors for an author's gender?"-- a framing which does not attempt to define pre-determined categories, but rather places its emphasis on potential points of difference, and which therefore makes its first task proving the existence of that difference.
At first glance, the gendered differences are not, in fact, particularly striking. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.
Moreover, the motifs characterized by a strong contrast tend to appear in relatively few works, making up a correspondingly minor part of the average reader's experience of the genre. Of the five most-represented motifs-- fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions-- the suicide mentions show the greatest contrast, with a ratio of 61% male authors to 39% female.
On the whole, then, male and female writers seem to have more commonalities than they do differences.</Text>

            <Text>“Most critics who have given any attention to Mrs. Radcliffe as a novelist have decided that she is important chiefly for her use of the supernatural, and for her emphasis upon landscape. Although she is, indeed, a pioneer in both these fields, it has seemed to me that, after all, her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure.” (McIntyre 77)
“Mrs. Radcliffe’s method is founded upon the principle // which Walpole tried with imperfect success to embody in his work — the principle of suspence” (79-80)
Radcliffe’s peers are “Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mrs. Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith” (93)
“One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: ‘This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s /Simple Story/.’ The expression, ‘this kind,’ is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” (McIntyre 94) “…the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art. Mrs. Radcliffe, it is true, was strictly moral… but her main interest does not lie there.”</Text>

            <Title>Male and Female Characters</Title>
            <Text>For the most part, my sample suggests that men write more about men, though without corresponding evidence that women write more about women. Not all of the individual motifs involve a particularly noteworthy contrast, but in general, monasteries are much more often discussed by men, and convents only weakly more by women...
...with a similar trend in clergymen versus abbesses and nuns.
However, when it comes to libertines versus loose women, each is more often written about by authors of the opposite gender.
Overall, then, it seems that women are reluctant to describe gender-segregated societies and spaces involving men, but feel the opposite impulse when it comes to disapproving of men's sexual activity.
Men are also much more interested in their own gender than women when we look at the gendered subjects of activities like abduction and fainting. Both are generally a female affair, and female abductees and fainters are written about by both men and women. However, the minority of male abductees and fainters have been written about more often by men.
This, then, is our first surprise: rather than finding each gender writing mostly about itself, women appear to be equal-opportunity subject matter, whereas men are mostly of interest to men.</Text>

            <Title>The Female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>When we examine those motifs which do not themselves encode a gender, we discover another surprise: of the 31 motifs that involve a notable disparity, the only two in which women outnumber men are libertines and miniature portraits. The remaining 29 are all examples of motifs used primarily by men.
If we go looking for the Female Gothic plot-- in female vulnerability, or in the restoration of broken family ties, for example-- the results are underwhelming.
And if we turn our attention to those images-- like blood, caves, and subterranean passages-- which have been simplistically aligned with the feminine, we find that, in the larger body of Gothic works, these have much more often appeared in works by men.
Caves and subterranean passages have perhaps been the most misperceived. Although Ann Radcliffe, critically credited with defining and refining the tropes of the female Gothic, makes heavy use of both motifs, she is one of very few female authors to do so. When her three caves and six subterranean passages are excluded from the sample, both motifs become even more decidedly male.
Perhaps these men are, like Henry Walpole in The Castle of Otranto, presenting underground spaces as avenues of flight or sanctuary for distressed women; even if so, the association is no longer likely to be, as early feminist critic Juliann Fleenor characterized the Female Gothic, an expression of an unnameable conflict with patriarchy (28). It is more likely, instead, that these caverns have appeared as the secret meeting-places of conspirators, as part of a German-influenced tradition of tales about criminal underworlds and evil Illuminati.</Text>

            <Title>The Male Gothic</Title>
            <Text>A male interest in crime and conspiracy is also suggested by the predominantly-male authorship of banditti and piracy, and Inquisition and secrecy.
However, even more striking are those motifs which suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects.
Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.
The masculine impulse to 'go farther,' to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in my sample novels' treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</Text>

            <Title>Conclusions</Title>
            <Text>To force one's readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.
However, it does not follow that the terror-Gothic must therefore be the province of women. Ann Radcliffe may have founded the terror-Gothic school, but women and men appear to have followed in her footsteps equally. Moreover, the existence of two opposing schools does not prove the equal footing of those schools; setting aside questions of gender to look at the relative prominence of various motifs, readers are vastly more likely to encounter the temporary terrors of abduction and confinement than the more permanent horrors of bones and corpses. Even death, which could reasonably appear in either school of novel despite its horrifying potential, is unexpectedly scarce compared to the widespread fainting.
In the wider context of the Gothic, then, it seems that the terror-Gothic and the Female Gothic are, in fact, simply the Gothic-- with the male horror-Gothic as the outlier subgenre in which an author's writing has been shaped by his gender.
These results remain preliminary, at least until a sample can be assembled which involves more texts at fewer levels of mediation. However, they serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. Research at a large scale provides a unique opportunity to compare the critical perception of a body of work to contemporary readers' experience of that same body; here, it has focused only on one specific way of seeking gendered imagery, but future projects can easily expand to investigate plot structure or chronology, and in a few years perhaps even style. And in the mean time, those scholars of the Gothic who study deeply only a few texts at a time can discuss their observations regarding potential expressions of a male viewpoint without needing to seek its exact analogue among female writers.</Text>

	This book, perhaps the first to pay serious scholarly attention to the wide reach of the Gothic, puts forth “a set of descriptions which will both help to identify the historical Gothic while suggesting reasons for its survival and for the multifarious forms in which it has survived” (20-21). Examining works from the birth of the Gothic to his present day, Punter identifies the unifying element of the Gothic as fear, expressed through a “dialectic of comfort and disturbance” and “a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423). In his final proposal of “a theory of the Gothic,” he argues that “Gothic fiction becomes a process of cultural self-analysis, and the images which it throws up become the dream-figures of a troubled social group.” with “the glance over the shoulder”—a nostalgic attempt to understand the past—as the inherent function of the ghost-story. The Gothic, “at the psychological interface between the well-ordered psyche and its rebel subjects,” may not provide an escape, but can provide “refuge while at the same time undermining the architectural fabric” of the bourgeois ideology which attempts to “naturalise” the unstable situation of society (425-6).

            <Title>Price</Title>
            <Text>Building toward a reading of the writing style of George Eliot, this book examines in detail the historical conditions of the rise of the anthology and its relationship to the seemingly un-anthologizable novel. Of particular interest is her detailed investigation of the many reworkings of Clarissa published alongside that text, from tables-of-contents meant to help readers ‘catch up’ to a current volume to editions consisting only of the Bible verses Clarissa reads. Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. She concludes with an argument that the works of George Eliot are written intentionally to anticipate their anthologies.

These changes are in keeping with Leah Price’s argument that editing a text does not simply produce a deformed version of the original, but rather produces a new text. Price takes Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa as the prime example of a novel surrounded by re-edited versions of itself; as she notes, each new abridgement reveals its editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13). In the years after Clarissa’s completion, alternate versions proliferated, each rewriting Richardson’s text to suit a new niche: abridgements in which the epistolary format has been replaced with an impersonal retrospective narrator (15); collections of “moral sentiments” excerpted and arranged alphabetically (17); an anthology of the Bible verses mentioned, but not quoted, in the novel, intermingled with both excerpts and summaries (24). Even the index of chapters, originally prefixed to the second edition “in the expectation that readers would have forgotten the beginning by the time they reached the end” (13), circulated as an independent pamphlet that could not just supplement the full text, but potentially replace it (17). Most importantly, several of these rewritings were carried out by Richardson himself; as the author of the original, he would have no need to identically replicate his own approach, but must have arranged each new editions with a different slant.
Richardson’s case establishes the general principle; when Price turns her attention to Radcliffe, she sees Radcliffe’s works as primarily interesting for their intermingling of prose with poetry. Radcliffe’s “beauties” (92), she argues, play the same role as do Richardson’s sentiments: readers may attempt to race through the book “wth. a View only to Story” (Richardson, qtd. in Price 21), but the structure of the book itself will discipline them.  Price’s description of Clarissa seems equally apt for the works of both authors: “the sententious passages which pepper the novel itself are designed less (through their content) to inculcate specific moral lessons than (through their structure) to regulate the pace of reading” (21). However, there is no need to interpret Radcliffe’s “embellishments” (95) as punitive. If nothing else, epigraphs and poems are an unlikely choice of corrective for an author battling the sin of skipping, since their typographical isolation allows readers to identify and ignore them almost without a thought.  Rather, I argue that Radcliffe’s notably extensive “beauties” are, like the technique of the explained supernatural, part of the political-aesthetic agenda discussed above.
Just as her rational explanations allowed Radcliffe to incorporate empowering myths unapologetically into modern literature, so too do her “embellishments” allow her to demonstrate her literary seriousness. Price herself notes that the prevalence in the novel of material that ought not be skipped, particularly her original poetry, “differentiates Radcliffe,” in reviewers’ minds, “from mere entertainers” (97). But Radcliffe doesn’t simply write and quote poetry: she also fills her text with landscapes and architecture, drawing on the literary traditions of travel narratives; with moral contemplations that wouldn’t be out of place in popular sentimental novels; with dramatic structures and staging that owe an obvious debt to the theatre; and, of course, with all the traditions of romance. Even the frustrating digressions of her comic servants come straight from Shakespeare. Walpole had, much earlier, “designedly” introduced bumbling servants based on the model of a “higher authority,” namely, “the great master of nature, SHAKESPEARE” (22). Indeed, Walpole provides a direct description of the Gothic-as-new-Classic framework, comparing Shakespeare to “the Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus… inserted a little boy measuring his thumb” (22). But whereas Walpole must explain and justify his lineage, Radcliffe allows it to go without saying. Walpole’s preface points to specific characters, and scenes, but Radcliffe attributes her epigraphs, whichever play they are drawn from or character they are spoken by, to, simply, “Shakespeare.” In the strength of her unifying vision, Radcliffe is like the Romantic poet, discussed by Tilar Mazzeo; she subordinates all her literary borrowings to a singular goal, ‘mastering’ them with her individual genius, and thus transforms them. Udolpho’s “beauties” go beyond embellishment to create a deeply intertextual novel, which is built upon diverse foundations but stands upon its own authority.

            <Text>The novel of sentiment:
“Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox, both brought up in the school of Richardson, yielded eventually to the taste for something less humdrum than domestic realism, and at the same time, far from renouncing or abating their fits of emotional indulgence and their pervading sentimentality, screwed up the tension, and dragged their lovers and heroines through stranger trials and more sensational adventures than could be counted among ordinary contingencies.” (Baker 91)
“Richardson had founded the English novel of sensibility; but, after all, sensibility was ot an object with Richardson, who wrote to inculcate prudence and self-control. … But sensibility soon became an object of engrossing interest and an end in itself” (Baker 95)

“That amoral person Sterne cared nothing for edification… He fondled his sensibility, he never tired of playing with it; he was a debauched sentimentalist, aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95 Baker)

“It would be inexact to say that the influence of Richardson was waning towards the end of the seventeen-sixties; if his novels were tending to go out of favour and to be superseded by new kinds of sentimental fiction, it was simply that he had established a cult and his devotees had gone beyong him.” (Baker 96) - Sterne and Mackenzie as prime examples
“It was the French Richardsonians, pursuing a trend already observable in their own literature, who first outwent their acknowledged leader.” (Baker 97)

“Some signs of the romantic scene-painting soon to be a marked characteristic of Gothic fiction are observable in Julia de Roubigné, and may reasonably be credited to the example of Prévost, who loved to set the stage gloomily for the experiences of his ill-starred lovers.” (Baker 110) “sensitivity to the sombre and dearful, which was presently to reach a fever-pitch in Charlotte Smith and Mrs Radcliffe” (Baker 110)

“moral improvement was decidedly the chief end that he [i.e., Mackenzie] envisaged in estimating the value of fiction; in other words, he takes exactly the same view as Dr Johnson and most other critics of that day” (Baker 112)
but Mackenzie doesn’t consider himself a sentimental novelist?

Henry Brooke more sentimental than Mackenzie — “Brook’s hero and his friends burst into tears alike in sympathy with grief and at any example of human affection or of nobility of soul.” (Baker 115)

novel of sensibility is mostly a more intense novel of sentiment (Baker 120). At first, “Sensibility accepted the rule of reason” (Baker 121), but over time “though fiction came by various stages nearer to life,” “In the later romances… sensibility was forced like a hot-house plant, and grew more and more artificial, affected, pretentious” (121).

“The novels of Prévost contain all the materials for the novel of sensibility. They also have in them a good part of the material that was son to be utilized in what came to be nicknamed the Gothic novel.” (Baker 130) primarily “his gloomy scene-painting”
“Prévost was less than half a realist, and much more than half a romancer” (Baker 131) …a variety of French authors who build on &amp; exaggerate Prévost

“The most distinguished English novel in line of descent from Richardson, which shows unmistakable traces of some infusion of blood from… Prévost… is that novel by Mrs Frances Sheridan, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph… (1761)” (Baker 141)

The History of the English Novel, Volume V: The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance

Enormous interlude on Fanny Burney, who “provides an interlude of natural comedy in the long monotone of solemn and pretentious sentimentalism” (154)

“Mystery and Wonder, Fear and Suspense, Sensation and Terror, are some of the labels affixed by different historians to the romantic novels that traded in one or another, or in all of these excitements, during the last few decades of the eighteenth century. The rather absurd term ‘Gothic’ is perhaps more convenient, and may be allowed to include both those than contented themselves with a discreet use of fear and suspense, and also those which sought the grosser sensations of terror and brutally aimed to make the flesh creep.” (Baker 175)
“It was a term applied first in derision… Then it was amiably accepted by Walpole and others, who confessed a fondness for what they called Gothic, little as they understood the real nature of what they admired, and grotesque as were their attempts to imitate it.”

“The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (Baker 175)
“Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.” (Baker 176)</Text>

            <Text>It it selling that Samuels and McGann refer to their deformations as a “deformative program” which is “run… through a particular work” to produce unpredictable but replicable”results” (36).
[Samuels and McGann initially exclude modes of criticism that “do not aim to be interpretive” from their analysis; their examples of ostensibly non-interpretive criticism are “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” but [would include models like mine] (26).] [However, they ultimately conclude that it’s all interpretive (46).] 

Role of experiments: Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40). “‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
they class “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” — [which is basically my stuff] — as non-interpretive (26). [Therefore, that stuff that didn’t look “interpretive” actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]



“The usual object of interpretation is ‘meaning,’ or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable … In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and … some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ‘for’ the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s).” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)
They “propose… another way of engaging imaginative work” which “moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into … performative operations.” They argue that “concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)

Emily Dickinson’s habit of reading poems backward is “a spendid model for… deformative criticism” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). “Her procedure… follows a romantic awareness… that poems lose their vital force when they succumb to familiarization” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). Despite affinity with modernist techniques of estrangement, “Dickinson’s critical model is performative, not intellectual” (Samuels &amp; McGann 29). “Reading Backward short circuits the sign of prose transparency and reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 30)

“First, imaginative work has an elective affinity with performance: it is organized as rhetoric and poiesis rather than as exposition and information-transmission. Because this is so, it always lies open to deformative moves.” Second, “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33) “Here we want to point out that lines of performative and deformative critical activity have always existed,” including “Elaborate scholarly editions” and “translations” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33).
“Because ‘a translation [involves] the necessity of settling many points without discussion,’ [D.G.] Rosetti observes, it ‘remains perhaps the most direct form of commentary’ that can be brought to literary work.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34). For people who dislike Rosetti’s translation, “The critical thoroughness and integrity… is exactly the problem.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34).

“Deformative scholarship is all but forbidden, the thought of it either // irresponsible or damaging to critical seriousness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34-5), likely because the prime example is “Forgery” (35) and the category also includes “mistaken and deviant readings produced… by students unaware of an ignorance in their … understanding” (35). But they set these aside in favor of “interpretive deformation,” as exemplified by “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (Samuels and McGann 35).
“The reluctance shows… that interpreters — even radical ones — do not commonly locate hermeneutic vitality in the documentary features of literary works. Because meaning is assumed to develop as a linguistic event, critical deformance plays itself out in the field of the signifieds.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Critical and interpretive limits are thus regularly established” to excluse consideration of “the physical artifact, whose stability and integrity is taken as inbiolable” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35).
“From an interpretive point of view, this assumption brackets off from attention crutical features of imaginative works… so basic and conventionally governed — they are alphabetical and diacritical. they are the rules for character formation, character arrangement, and textual space, as well as for the structural forms of words, phrases, and higher morphemic and phonemic units— that readers tend to treat them as preinterpetive and precitical. In truth, however, they comprise the operating system of language” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Linguists, semioticians, bibliographers, and cognitive theorists regularly explore these territories, but their work is not normally concerned with interpretation in the customary sense — that is, with explaining aesthetic and stylistic features of works” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).
“But this enlargement of the subject matter of criticism does not define the most significant function of deformative operations. Far most important is the stochastic process it entails. … When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “…we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work,” so that “customary rules are… held in abeyance, to be chosen among… to be followed or nor as one decides,” resulting in “the dramatic exposure of subjectivity as a live and highly informative option of interpretive commentary” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).

They focus on “poetic deformations,” “organized into four types:” (36) reordered, isolating, altering, and adding (36-7). They focus on reordering and isolating poems, taking Wallace Stevens as their experimental ground.

“deformance does not banish interpretation. The reversed text is still subject to, still giving of, interpretive readings. Deformance does want to show that the poem’s intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40).

“we may usefully regard all criticism and interpretation as deformance. Scholars murder to dissect, as Wordsworth famously observed” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46) *** JUST LIKE LEAH PRICE’S ARGUMENT —> Despite approaching the matter from very different projects, [both] have reached a similar conclusion about the [state of criticism] which makes my own approach differ not in fundamenal kind from the norm, but in degree and in [reflexiveness? obviousness?].
“Interpretation is the application of scientia to poiesis, or the effort to elucidate one discourse form in terms of another.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46).
“Interpretation for della Volpe… always displays a gap between the work being examined and the student. But this gap does not represent a failure of criticism, or even a mysticism of poiesis. It locates the source and end and test of the art being examined” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47). The gap comes into being as soon as the critic must paraphrase the text. “Interpretation, then, is a constellation of paraphrases that evolve… from an uncritical to a critical moment” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47)
In della Volpe’s work, “to attempt a socio-historical paraphrase is to experiment with the poetical work, to subject it to a hypothesis of its meanings. As in any scientific experiment with natural phenomena, the engagement with the ordinary phenomenon inevitably exposes the limits of the hypothesis, and ultimaely returns us to an even more acute sense of the phenomena we desire to understand. … By contrast,” their deformances “place primary emphasis on the preconceptual elements of the text” because “social and historical formations seem to us far less determinate, far more open to arbitrary and imaginative construction, than the appear in della Volpe” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works… allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49) 
“To essay a more direct application of ‘interpretation’ to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment withthe work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. … one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)
“To deliberately accept the inevitable failure of interpretive ‘adequacy’ is to work toward discovering new interpretive virtues… This attitude toward literate comprehension, and the kind of criticism it inspires, gains its power by baring its own devices.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)</Text>

            <Text>Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel. </Text>

            <Text>My own adaptation of Tracy’s bibliography [accepts this model and elaborates on it.] [Tracy is always pointing outward to the books themselves, but I have foregrounded the motifs.] [I turn my attention to those motifs prevalent enough that their multiple appearances constitute an object worthy of study.] Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs indexed appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from my study. [This leaves me with 70 motifs, which form the foundation of my experiments.] Tracy’s boolean treatment of these motifs has already elided many details; in her index, a motif either exists in a work or it does not, with no attention paid even in the detailed summaries as to how the motif is presented or the importance of its presence. The brief description of [a character] as “a parricide” (CITE) in Melmoth the Wanderer, for example, is sufficient to have that work indexed under “parricide” (Tracy 202), placing it on equal footing as novels like [X] and [Y] in which the murder of a father plays a central role in the plot. I have further distilled each motif to its simplest case by ignoring the detailed sub-categories which Tracy sometimes provides.  “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine” (203), but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader category of “poison (any).” This new motif applies to 30 novels, a large enough group that it becomes possible to look for patterns within in. This description of my methods emphasizes places where differences between books have been intentionally reduced. However, this [whatever] does not result in a loss of [knowledge].

            <Title>editing - Leah Price</Title>
            <Text>It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to echo McCarty. The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price. In The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel, Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann’s classification of “[e]laborate scholarly editions” (33) as deformative criticism, Price argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. The process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13), and thus gives us a new thing to examine. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts— when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize or categorize scenes, chapters, or books— our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Price’s project is more interested in the literal anthologizing undertaken by publishers than in the mental anthologizing implicit in the scholarly act of thinking about several books at once; her ultimate argument is about the works of George Eliot, not about the methodology of literary criticism. Nonetheless, her observations, once anthologized in abridged form alongside digital humanities thinkers, allows us to ‘bare the devices’ of literary criticism itself.

            <Text>My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy’s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy’s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various “motifs” can be found. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as a simple starting point for in-depth explorations of particular topics. However, a modern spreadsheet program renders trivially easy what would have been a monumental feat of correlation in 1981 when Tracy’s work was published, and I have adapted her index to a different purpose: charting the genders of the indexed authors, I have asked which motifs — if any — can serve as predictors of the authorial gender of a given text. If we know that a novel has a subterannean passage in it, for example, or a monastery, or a prophetic dream, do we know anything about who wrote it? This particular framing of the question— not “what do men and women each write about?” but “what, if it appears, can be used to distinguish between men and women?” — was chosen to avoid [[FIND THE ARTICLE ABOUT UNPROVABLE CIRCULAR HYPOTHESES]]</Text>

            <Title>intro to Frank</Title>
            <Text>However, I argue that these gendered patterns are not due to a male/female horror/terror split, but rather reflect the gendered patterns of the domestic and sentimental Gothic vs the ‘high’ Gothic. In order to connect [these gendered patterns] to genres, I turned to Frederick Frank’s bibliography, The First Gothics, which includes a classification of each text’s “Gothic type”. Frank’s “types” are, like Tracy’s “motifs,” clearly intended for a different sort of scholarly use: for the 178 texts under consideration, he provided 131 unique classifications (CITE APPENDIX). Many of these are “unique” only from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, clearly refer to the same general “type.” In order to render his assessments useful for my own project, however, it was necessary to reduce his minute distinctions into broader categories. This process of reduction became, in its own right, my second experiment: at each stage of my gradual process of simplification, I asked, “Which distinctions of genre appear to be borne out by differences in authorship or content?” This process of reduction also led to my second [result]: in my historicist reading of the bulk of the early Gothic the operant genre distinctions are not really to do with horror vs terror, but rather the domestic vs High Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>Just as I had to work against the grain of Tracy’s preference for uniqueness and difference in order to [seek connections and correlations between motifs], so too have I [worked against the grain of Frank’s model], this time in the reverse direction: I have sought to separate out each strand, to treat it as [a category existing beyond the texts it applies to], so that [I can examine each one individually]. Rather than trying to define a single “Gothic type” for each work, I divided each “Gothic type” into a set of tags, and tallied the use of each tag the same way I tallied Tracy’s motifs. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” (315), was tagged as “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Similarly, Radcliffe’s Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” (302), tagged as “high,” “Gothic,” “terror mode,” “horror mode,” and “Radcliffean.” By allowing each individual phrase of Frank’s Gothic types to become its own tag, I allowed the most important categories— and their relationships— to emerge with as little critical intervention as possible. My further [analysis of gender] followed the same principles as my [analysis] of Tracy’s motifs: each chart was built to answer the question, “does knowing that this tag is associated with a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book’s author?” Because Frank’s classifications are subjective attempts to [assess the overall tone of a work in context], rather than [boolean checklist items], an answer of “yes” to this question no longer tells us “this motif is a useful predictor of gender,” but rather indicates “the critical [definition] of this genre tag is responding to a gendered usage.”</Text>

            <Title>more sophisticated</Title>
            <Text>Criticism about gendered gothics has grown more sophisticated, moving from, for example,  Fleenor’s societal emphasis on relationship to patriarchy to a more literary emphasis in Wallace &amp; Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions.

Fleenor: It argues that, whereas terror-Gothic novels relate to other Gothics, horror-Gothic relates “directly to a patriarchal paradigm—that the woman is motherless, that she is a defective male, and that she has for her God the male, not the absolute” (7). It emphasizes the Gothic as literature “written and consistently read by women” (7), and argues that “…the Gothic form allows us – as readers and as writers – to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name” (28), i.e., the conflict between a woman and her prescribed societal role.
In his essay “‘Mother Radcliffe’: Ann Radcliffe and the Female Gothic,” Robert Miles argues that The Italian, as a direct response to The Monk, is able to make use of both Female and Male Gothic “narrative grammar” (56). </Text>

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

—

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Text>The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high or pure” Gothic (64); “terror mode” (63); “history” (30); “domestic” fiction (28); “horror mode” (25); “sentimental” fiction (24); “Radcliffean” novels (19, which includes 6 novels by Radcliffe); “chapbook” stories (17); “natural” Gothics, consisting of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary murders (11); “Schauerromantik” novels (11); and “Monk-ian” novels classified either as imitations of The Monk or as monastic shockers (9, including The Monk). 
Mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole: history, domestic, sentimental, naturalized, Schauerromantik. Indeed, in accordance with the conclusions I drew from Tracy’s motifs, the Male Gothic operates as a distinct minority of the genre as a whole. Even including ‘Monk-ian’ in this list requires a bit of fudging; this category includes 3 texts named as imitations of The Monk, 5 texts named as ‘monastic shockers,’ and The Monk itself — and even then this only provides 9 novels, below my initial arbitrary threshold of 10.</Text>

            <Text>[Emotional content] is salient as a distinguishing factor because Baker, like many of his contemporaries, writes from  the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. [Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not so obviously mediated as Tracy’s or Frank’s; rather than explicitly deforming the texts under consideration into summaries and metadata, Baker proceeds [by referring to the texts themselves in their entirety]]. However, as Leah Price observes, it is impossible for human memory to hold an entire novel at once, let alone the whole history of the novel; Baker, like any scholar, must [mentally abridge the novels] as he [writes about them], [and his abridgements take for granted the idea that the ‘goal’ of the novel itself is to become realist]. [Because Baker does not “[bare] its devices” (Samuels and McGann 49), this framework remains implicit in the moralizing judments throughout his work.]  Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95), for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful; his [research] is not easily divorced from [his realist teleology]. J.M.S. Thompkins, too, dismisses the Gothic [on the basis of these kinds of assumptions]: with the rise of the Gothic, she says, “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probable, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern" (57). [Both critics model the novel itself as a training-ground for the mind, through which habits of thought are established, and which therefore ought to inculcate the ‘right’ mode of thought.] [Accordingly, both model the Gothic as a dangerously emotional and disordered mode of thought, notable not for its plots or sets or even the kinds of emotions induced, but for the overpowering experience.]</Text>

            <Title>McCarty summary</Title>
            <Text>McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (CITE). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling, McCarty says, “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (CITE), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (CITE). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus of full texts for famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (CITE); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions.</Text>

            <Text>The first thing these design choices make apparent is the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary, in keeping with my [observations of Tracy’s motifs]. The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged “terror” and only 24 (13%) tagged “horror”. Of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books as pure “horror mode.” However, although the relative scale of each mode accords with what we saw in Tracy’s motifs, the smaller horror mode no longer seems to be so strongly male-dominated. And if we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, separating out the “horror-terror” mixed-modes books from the rest, our gendered expectations are [even more wrong]: the 10 pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors, and it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship.</Text>

            <Text>And yet, it seems that the Radcliffean novel, as a categorization, does bear scrutiny as a gendered tradition. Frank identifies twelve novels as explicit imitations of Radcliffe; the “Radcliffe” tag includes those twelve, and Radcliffe’s own six novels — and every book included is by a woman. Radcliffe’s opposite in this binary is the “Monk / monastic” tag; no works were identified as imitations of Lewis himself, but nine (including The Monk itself) are identified as an imitation of The Monk, a “monastic shocker,” or both. Of these nine, seven are by men. The ‘school of Radcliffe’ does thus appear to be a female-dominated school which stands in contrast to a smaller, less-distinct but male-dominated ‘school of Lewis’ — which raises the question of why neither the Tracy’s motifs nor Frank’s horror and terror Gothic types showed evidence of these schools.</Text>

            <Text>But "algorithmic criticism" — criticism prompted by the algorithmic manipulation of literary texts — either does not exist, or exists only in nascent form. The digital revolution, for all its wonders, has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies, which, despite numerous revolutions of a more epistemological nature, remains mostly concerned with the interpretive analysis of written cultural artifacts. Texts are browsed, searched, and disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation. Even text analysis practitioners avoid bringing the hermeneutical freedom of criticism to the "outputted" text. Bold statements, strong readings, and broad generalizations (to say nothing of radical misreadings, anarchic accusations, agonistic paratextual revolts) are rare, if not entirely absent from the literature of the field, where the emphasis is far more often placed on methodology and the limitations it imposes.


The computer is certainly incapable of offering "the shift to a redemptive world-view" as a solution to the problem at hand; it is wholly incapable of inferring this from the data. But is it likewise the case that computational results — the data and visualizations that the computer generates when it seeks to quantize and measure textual phenomena — cannot be used to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead one to such a conclusion?
It is useful to put the question this way, because in doing so we refocus the hermeneutical problem away from the nature and limits of computation (which is mostly a matter of methodology) and move it toward consideration of the nature of the discourse in which text analysis bids participation.



But in literary criticism — and here I am thinking of ordinary "paper based" literary criticism — conclusions are evaluated not in terms of what propositions the data allows, but in terms of the nature and depth of the discussions that result. The scientist is right to say that the plural of anecdote is not data, but in literary criticism, an abundance of anecdote is precisely what allows discussion and debate to move forward.


These are provocative results, but the provocation is as much about our sense of what we are doing (the hermeneutical question) as it is about how we are doing it (the methodological question).

If algorithmic criticism is to have a central hermeneutical tenet, it is this: that the narrowing constraints of computational logic — the irreducible tendency of the computer toward enumeration, measurement, and verification — are fully compatible with the goals of criticism set forth above. For while it is possible, and in some cases useful, to confine algorithmic procedures to the scientific realm, such procedures can be made to conform to the methodological project of inventio without transforming the nature of computation or limiting the rhetorical range of critical inquiry. This is possible, because critical reading practices already contain elements of the algorithmic.

Any reading of a text that is not a recapitulation of that text relies on a heuristic of radical transformation. The critic who endeavors to put forth a "reading," puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced. This basic property of critical methodology is evident not only in the act of "close reading," but in the more ambitious project of thematic exegesis. In the classroom, one encounters the exegete instructing his or her students to turn to page 254, and then to page 16, and finally to page 400. They are told to consider just the male characters, or just the female ones, or to pay attention to the adjectives, the rhyme scheme, images of water, or the moment in which Nora Helmer confronts her husband. The interpreter will set a novel against the background of the Jacobite Rebellion, or a play amid the historical location of the theater. He or she will view the text through the lens of Marxism, or psychoanalysis, or existentialism, or postmodernism. In every case, what is being read is not the "original" text, but a text transformed and transduced into an alternative vision, in which, as Wittgenstein put it, we "see an aspect" that further enables discussion and debate.

It is not that such matters as redemptive world views and Marxist readings of texts can be arrived at algorithmically, but simply that algorithmic transformation can provide the alternative visions that give rise to such readings. The computer does this in a particularly useful way by carrying out transformations in a rigidly holistic manner. It is one thing to notice patterns of vocabulary, variations in line length, or images of darkness and light; it is another thing to employ a machine that can unerringly discover every instance of such features across a massive corpus of literary texts and then present those features in a visual format entirely foreign to the original organization in which these features appear. Or rather, it is the same thing at a different scale and with expanded powers of observation. It is in such results that the critic seek not facts, but patterns. And from pattern, the critic may move to the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading.


 Algorithmic criticism would have to retain the commitment to methodological rigor demanded by its tools, but the emphasis would be less on maintaining a correspondence or a fitness between method and goal, and more on the need to present methods in a fully transparent manner. It would not be averse to the idea of reproducibility, but it would perhaps be even more committed to the notion of "hackability." For just as one might undertake a feminist reading of a text by transporting a set of heuristics from one critical context to another, so might the algorithmic critic undertake a particular type of reading by transforming a procedure that has been defined in terms of that most modern text, the computer program.
Algorithmic criticism undoubtedly requires a revolution of sorts, but that revolution is not one of new procedures and methods in contradistinction to the old ones. Algorithmic criticism seeks a new kind of audience for text analysis — one that is less concerned with fitness of method and the determination of interpretive boundaries, and one more concerned with evaluating the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates. Such an audience exists, of course, and has existed for the better part of a century in the general community of literary critics from which text analysis has often found itself exiled. For this reason, text analysis practitioners should view the possibility of such a revolution as both welcome and liberating —not a critique of their methods, but a bold vote of confidence in the possibilities they hold.

            <Title>many schools</Title>
            <Text>An answer is suggested by a broader look at the tags beyond horror and terror which [are popular in Frank’s Gothic types]. Mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole; the eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: “high Gothic” (63); “terror” (62); “history” (29); “domestic” (27); “horror” (24); “sentimental” (24); “Radcliffe” (18); “chapbook” (17); “naturalized,” which refers to “natural Gothic,” “documentary Gothic,” and “explained supernatural” novels which consist of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary murders (11); “Schauerromantik” (10); and “Monk imitation / monastic shocker” (9). [This variety of ‘types’ suggests a different picture of the main threads of the Gothic, which doesn’t function via binaries at all.] [It remains mainly non-gendered.] However, the bright yellow rectangles of ‘Radcliffe’ and ‘sentimental’ together suggest that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy’s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition — the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information, but the gendered trend suggested by Frank’s gothic types is not defined by individual plot-devices like skulls and incest. Instead, the emerging ‘school of Radcliffe’ suggested here is deeply tied to the sentimental novel. </Text>

            <Title>general methods</Title>
            <Text>To take the first steps toward that understanding, I have created and carefully examined visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs and Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty’s “Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies” and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s “Deformance and Interpretation.” After carrying out a wide range of experiments, I have selected two of the most fruitful to discuss in depth: I have charted the gendered use of 70 Gothic ‘motifs’ identified by Tracy, and explored Frank’s classifications of the same novels’ various ‘Gothic types’. Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. [I don’t wish to replicate this emphasis of attention.] My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the ‘school of Radcliffe’; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.</Text>

            <Text>[My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself.] [I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool.] [In doing so, I have found evidence at various points of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions.] [However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel nature of any binary distinctions one might wish to draw.] [McCarty argues that “a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question” — of these, he says, “failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result” (CITE).] [Accordingly, my failure to find a an obvious or stable gender divide within the Gothic is valuable as evidence that in the broadest context of the Gothic, the conversation occurring between novels is [not about gender].]</Text>

            <Title>procedurality - Ramsay</Title>
            <Text>Ramsay’s writing on algorithmic criticism of oft-cited in conjunction with the idea that methodology is not a concern unique to sciences or to computational inquiry; “ordinary ‘paper based’ literary criticism” (n. pag.) has its own methodologies, which are no less important for being generally invisible. However, I take many of his ideas more strongly than he himself states them. For example, Ramsay provides an excellent illustration of a critical methodology at play:

In the classroom, one encounters the exegete instructing his or her students to turn to page 254, and then to page 16, and finally to page 400. They are told to consider just the male characters, or just the female ones, or to pay attention to the adjectives, the rhyme scheme, images of water, or the moment in which Nora Helmer confronts her husband. The interpreter will set a novel against the background of the Jacobite Rebellion, or a play amid the historical location of the theater. He or she will view the text through the lens of Marxism, or psychoanalysis, or existentialism, or postmodernism. In every case, what is being read is not the “original” text, but a text transformed and transduced into an alternative vision, in which, as Wittgenstein put it, we “see an aspect” that further enables discussion and debate. (n. pag.)
An algorithm, in computational terms, is simply a series of steps executed under pre-defined conditions  — like “turn to these pages, in this order” or “for each scene, determine whether economics are at play, and in what way” — and yet Ramsay says here that “critical reading practices” only “contain elements of the algorithmic” (n. pag., emphasis mine).

He says that “[a]ny reading of a text that is not a recapitulation of that text relies on a heuristic of radical transformation” (n. pag.), but no reading is or can be a straightforward recapitulation.
He notes that “[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a ‘reading,’ puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (n. pag.)

            <Title>modeling - McCarty</Title>
            <Text>In determining my approach, I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, defines a distinction between models “of” something and models “for” something (n. pag.). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (McCarty), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (McCarty). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus containing full texts of famous Gothics. However, immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions.
Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, the object of study is no longer a model at all, but the thing itself. Tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study— too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence— and so models are always ultimately “fictional” (McCarty). Because these fictions have been created with particular goals in mind—because, McCarty says, “modeling is pragmatic”—he argues that “the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness” (McCarty). Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” provides a metric for evaluating that fruitfulness: “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates” (Ramsay). This seems to be what McCarty implicitly means when he terms something “fruitful”: whether or not the model has revealed what we expected, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact correspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle” (McCarty), and more of an imagined destination that spurs valuable journeys. As a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. Models need not be perfectly accurate, only sensitive to the desired area of difference.</Text>

            <Title>driving Q: 'school of Radcliffe'</Title>
            <Text>Literary discussions of gender at the birth of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century have grown ever more nuanced and attentive to detail over the years. At its inception and [for a long time after], the genre as a whole was often dismissed as unserious due to a percieved [alignment with women]. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the Female Gothic, Gothic writing “written and consistently read by women” (The Female Gothic 7), to stand as a worthy subject of inquiry regardless of literary status due to its direct relation to a patriarchal paradigm and its ability to “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name” (28). Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have moved [from societal relationships to intertextual ones], as exemplified in [Robert Miles’s complex reading of The Italian as making use of both Female and Male Gothic “narrative grammar” (56).] [However, to accomplish this more sophisticated approach, scholars have of necessity focused in greater detail on smaller numbers of texts.] [My goal, in applying a large-scale digital methodology to this [field], is not to duplicate the research on individual novels carried out by other scholars, but to open up new ways of understanding the relationships within the broader body of texts.] [Throughout my essay, I will touch upon the implications my findings might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest in is the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself.] [This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifiable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but [I will argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics]]. [Over the course of two large-scale literary ‘experiments,’ in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I have asked what schools, if any, make themselves apparents, and whether there is cause to believe that the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same.] [My preliminary results suggest that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream.]</Text>

            <Text>My own modeling framework is informed by all of these. My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation. My two ‘texts’ – Tracy’s and Frank’s bibliographies – are themselves two very different deformative models of ‘The Gothic Novel,’ and each render different distinctions more or less salient. When forming my research questions, I begin by asking what a given source of information allows me to be sensitive to. Tracy’s motifs emphasize events and singular images, with each detail systematically tallied. In contrast, Frank’s Gothic types emphasize a work’s overall tone, and his evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. The two are thus able to usefully complement each other. As I work with these texts, I dwell upon procedure as a way to meditate upon the implications of earlier critics’ frameworks. Because I must iterate all of my decisions at least 178 times when I decide to include a new axis of distinction in my spreadsheet, much of my ‘research’ has been developing procedures that work with each model, deforming books into spreadsheets and then into images in ways that will render their implicit models explicit and obvious. Rather than visualizing data, then, my goal has been to render models legible. My graphs thus amplify Tracy’s and Frank’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their results accord with our expectations.

            <Title>genre - Frow</Title>
            <Text>[My interest in placing Radcliffe back into the broadest possible context is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers the way that ‘literary fiction’ is separated from ‘romance novels’ today.
This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategicall fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Accordingly, any investigation of Radcliffe’s use of genre must begin with an understanding of what she’s using.</Text>

            <Text>Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which only exist for the most critically-examined novels. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the ‘school of Radcliffe’; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]</Text>

            <Text>Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them indicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. [This accords with existing discussions of Matthew Lewis’s Male Gothic]. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.</Text>

            <Title>deformance - Samuels &amp; McGann</Title>
            <Text>McCarty also describes models which are not merely partial in some particular set of details, but which “deliberately” diverge from their source “in order to study the consequences” of the changes. McCarty terms these intentional manipulations “distortion,” but Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call them “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations. Whether the final interpreted meaning is “resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable” — whichever framework is used for the method of “reading along thematic lines” — the method itself, they argue, is neither transparent nor the only option (26). Although “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity,” both scholarly editions and translations of texts take critical interpretations and write them onto the texts themselves (33). Similarly, “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (35), typically undertaken in service of a particular point, constitute deformation. Placing themselves in this tradition, Samuels and McGann apply several deformative interpretive approaches to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. Each deformation is a procedure for rewriting a poem — reordering its lines from last to first, or deleting all the words but the nouns or the verbs — which spurs a new interpretation of the new version of the text. The key advantage of these deformations is a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study: the procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing” (30) by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. When readers cannot ignore the critic’s act of re-writing, we are implicitly asked to engage again with the author’s earlier act of writing. This defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (36), because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work.</Text>
            <Comments>For a recognition of the methodologies of “ordinary ‘paper based’ literary criticism” (Ramsay), I could also have taken Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” as my foundation. Ramsay argues that “[a]ny reading of a text… relies on a heuristic of radical transformation” (Ramsay), noting that “[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a ‘reading,’ puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (Ramsay). However, Ramsay ultimately subordinates his computational experiments to “the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading” (Ramsay). I take Samuels and McGann as my starting-place largely for their willingness to treat their created texts seriously as new and separate objects of interpretation.</Comments>

            <Title>Tracy's goals</Title>
            <Text>I began with the ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’ included at the end of Ann Tracy’s bibliography. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. This index is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; its intended audience is “scholars with particular interests” (195), such as “garden as a scene of temptation” (200), who wish to locate new books to close-read. Accordingly, Tracy has prioritized presenting a wide range of distinctive individual motifs, such as “hand, cold, seizing heroine” (200), rather than broad categories. Indeed, her preface to the index indicates that highly popular motifs were intentionally excluded: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only” (195), and castles have similarly been ignored. Tracy’s omissions work at cross-purposes to my own approach — despite Tracy’s assertion that castles “are so pervasive a device that no purpose can be served by the recitation of two hundred novels that have them” (195), I would have liked to compare them to manor houses, cottages, abbeys, and convents — and I have had to discard much of her work. 138 of her motifs have been disregarded entirely, because they appear in fewer than twenty novels. Additionally, most of the motifs which she breaks down into detailed sub-categories have been reduced back to their stem category. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine” (203), but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader category of “poison (any),” which applies to [X] novels and thus allows [subcategorization].</Text>

            <Text>Moreover, the more popular a motif is— i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre— the more likely it is to be non-gendered.

[Tracy’s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness.] [It treats each individual novels as a bucket of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar.] [The information presented alongside each novel’s bibliographic entry, by which critics are meant to determine whether they want to read the book, is a plot summary.] [Her summaries point out distinctive details, such as “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides” (74) ][The bare facts of the plot are thus treated as the primary site of interesting investigation.] [The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — thus become the stable objects of study, which may or may not become visible in individual texts.] [Intertextual and chronological relationships are minimized in favor of [motifs]].

General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration-- nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms "actual" incest, only "incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion)." This kind of narrative discretion is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors, and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented-- and all six are by men.</Text>

            <Text>These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic vs Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic. </Text>

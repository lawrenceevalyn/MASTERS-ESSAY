[Over the course of two large-scale literary \'91experiments,\'92 in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I have asked what schools, if any, make themselves apparents, and whether there is cause to believe that the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same.] [My preliminary results suggest that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that both are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream.]}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 My graphic design choices, as I sought to render each chart legible in terms of this driving question, followed similar principles as my motif chart designs. However, since each chart was specialized to a particular sub-question, each chart has its own slighly different procedure. [Stacked bar graphs let me consider all of the most-common tags as a group.] [Showing the raw counts, rather than [presenting] each bar as a percentage, allows the size of each bar to convey the relative prevalence of each tag.] I have also continued to use colour contrast to indicate gendered difference, when a chart examines a gendered difference.}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 So, pragmatic reasons are one reason a model might diverge in \'93isomorphic exactness\'94 (McCarty CITE) from that which it models; the other is what McCarty terms \'93distortion\'94 (CITE), but which Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call \'93deformance.\'94 I take this term from their essay \'93Deformance and Interpretation,\'94 which seeks to untangle  mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation paraphrases and distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations. \
 \
they class \'93bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis\'94 \'97 [which is basically my stuff] \'97 as non-interpretive (26).\
[Therefore, that stuff that didn\'92t look \'93interpretive\'94 actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]\
Accordingly, if my spreadsheet and graphs model \'93the Gothic novel\'94, they also deform it.}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other: the differences between them are eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel. }

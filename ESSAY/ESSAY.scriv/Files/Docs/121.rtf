\f0\fs24 \cf0 These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are necessarily perfect binaries. And indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. This model suggests that, rather than a balanced opposition of Radcliffe\'92s female terror Gothic vs Lewis\'92s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. The existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic. }

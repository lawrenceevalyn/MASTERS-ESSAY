\f0\fs24 \cf0 Only one of those 5 charts shows much of a contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.}

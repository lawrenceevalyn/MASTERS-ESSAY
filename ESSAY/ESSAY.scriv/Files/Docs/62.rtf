\f0\fs24 \cf0 The more we seek a neat binary in the model, the more we find that it is unbalanced. For example, on the basis of the male-dominated authorship of books containing male fainters, male abductees, and clergymen, it might be tempting to argue that each gender write more often about itself. However, there is no corresponding evidence that women write more about women (female fainters, female abductees, nuns and abbesses).}

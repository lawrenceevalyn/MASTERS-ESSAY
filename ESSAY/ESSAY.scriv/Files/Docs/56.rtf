\f0\fs24 \cf0 Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic\'92s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which only exist for the most critically-examined novels. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the \'91school of Radcliffe\'92; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]}

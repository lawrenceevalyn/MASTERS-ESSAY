\f0\fs24 \cf0 These earlier approaches have largely been superceded now, partly for their now-charming willingness to render emotional judments on authors \'97 Baker\'92s excoriation of \'93that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne\'94 for being a \'93debauched sentimentalist\'94 who \'93fondled his sensibility,\'94 \'93aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness\'94 (95), for example, evaluates 
\i Tristram Shandy
\i0  along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful \'97 but more subtly problematic in these earlier works is the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the 
\i realist
\i0  novel. J.M.S Thompkins, for example, founds his dismissal of the Gothic in his assumption that the \'91goal\'92 of the novel itself is to become realist: \'93the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probable, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern" (57). However, we can reject this assumption without rejecting Thompkins\'92 observation that \'91fantastic\'92 plot elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it: in the Gothic, he argues, "the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-teller's stock in trade\'94 (57), rendering these stories [as functionally the same as what he terms the sensational novel.]}

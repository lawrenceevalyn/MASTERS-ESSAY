\f0\fs24 \cf0 In contrast to the wild abundance of male tropes, in my model of the genre, the \'91Female Gothic\'92 is defined by only two things: libertines, and miniature portraits. These two motifs together immediately suggest a Female Gothic less like [X] and more like Jane Austen, whose ordered and rational novels are replete with rakes and miniatures. However, their paucity also suggests that this immediate response may be too hasty; [the Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the Everybody Gothic]. More than half of the 70 motifs not strongly gendered. Three \'97 \'93dueling and other single combat,\'94 \'93elopement (any),\'94 and \'93relative, lost, discovery of\'94 \'97 are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is\'97 i.e., the larger a role it plays in making up the genre\'97 the more likely it is to be non-gendered. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic as a genre appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. Only one of those 5 charts shows a notable contrast between men and women, which is in keeping with the bulk of my results. }

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'93One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: \'91This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald\'92s /Simple Story/.\'92 The expression, \'91this kind,\'92 is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.\'94 (McIntyre 94) \'93\'85the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art.

\f0\fs24 \cf0 An answer is suggested by a broader look at the tags beyond horror and terror which [are popular in Frank\'92s Gothic types]. Mingled in with our Radcliffean and Monk-ian novels are all kinds of schools not generally accorded particular importance for the field as a whole; the eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence are, from most popular to least popular, as follows: \'93high Gothic\'94 (63); \'93terror\'94 (62); \'93history\'94 (29); \'93domestic\'94 (27); \'93horror\'94 (24); \'93sentimental\'94 (24); \'93Radcliffe\'94 (18); \'93chapbook\'94 (17); \'93naturalized,\'94 which refers to \'93natural Gothic,\'94 \'93documentary Gothic,\'94 and \'93explained supernatural\'94 novels which consist of entirely explained or non-supernatural elements, including those based on authentic contemporary murders (11); \'93Schauerromantik\'94 (10); and \'93
\i Monk
\i0  imitation / monastic shocker\'94 (9). [This variety of \'91types\'92 suggests a different picture of the main threads of the Gothic, which doesn\'92t function via binaries at all.] [It remains mainly non-gendered.] However, the bright yellow rectangles of \'91Radcliffe\'92 and \'91sentimental\'92 together suggest that the problem, while hunting for the Female Gothic among Tracy\'92s motifs, was not a lack of a female-dominated tradition \'97 the problem was the method. The particular deformation of the motif-charts allowed my model to be sensitive only to certain types of information, but the gendered trend suggested by Frank\'92s gothic types is not defined by individual plot-devices like skulls and incest. Instead, the emerging \'91school of Radcliffe\'92 suggested here is deeply tied to the sentimental novel. }

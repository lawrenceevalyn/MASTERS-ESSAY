\f0\fs24 \cf0 My own adaptation of Tracy\'92s bibliography [accepts this model and elaborates on it.] [Tracy is always pointing outward to the books themselves, but I have foregrounded the motifs.] [I turn my attention to those motifs prevalent enough that their multiple appearances constitute an object worthy of study.] Due to Tracy\'92s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs indexed appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from my study. [This leaves me with 70 motifs, which form the foundation of my experiments.] Tracy\'92s boolean treatment of these motifs has already elided many details; in her index, a motif either exists in a work or it does not, with no attention paid even in the detailed summaries as to how the motif is presented or the importance of its presence. The brief description of [a character] as \'93a parricide\'94 (CITE) in 
\i Melmoth the Wanderer
\i0 , for example, is sufficient to have that work indexed under \'93parricide\'94 (Tracy 202), placing it on equal footing as novels like [X] and [Y] in which the murder of a father plays a central role in the plot. I have further distilled each motif to its simplest case by ignoring the detailed sub-categories which Tracy sometimes provides. 
\f1  \'93Poison,\'94 for example, is indexed with categories for \'93blade,\'94 \'93chaplet,\'94 \'93kiss,\'94 \'93letter,\'94 \'93orange,\'94 \'93plant on grave,\'94 and \'93sacrificial wine\'94 (203), but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader category of \'93poison (any).\'94 This new motif applies to 30 novels, a large enough group that it becomes possible to look for patterns within in. This description of my methods emphasizes places where differences between books have been intentionally reduced. However, this [whatever] does not result in a loss of [knowledge]. Instead, [Pivoting metaphor]. [I deform her index to produce a model of the Gothic that is sensitive to what particular elements of the \'91Gothic toolkit\'92 authors are more likely to use.] [My deformed version of Tracy\'92s index is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but sensitivity to one thing is traded for sensitivity to another.] [The motifs which Tracy implicitly treats as [existing outside the novels] are now exposed for explicit investigation.]}

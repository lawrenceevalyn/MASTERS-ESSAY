\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'93The sources of Gothic romance\'85 are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abb\'e9 Pr\'e9vost and elaborated later on by Baculard d\'92Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abb\'e9\'92s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion\'94 (Baker 175)\
\'93Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.\'94 (Baker 176)}

50% of Radcliffean novels are also high gothic! If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order.\
25% of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean! genres which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized, and high, in that order. (terror and monastic shocker are actually on par!! but this is an artefact of the much lower numbers of monastic shockers)}

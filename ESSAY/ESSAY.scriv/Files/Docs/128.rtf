\f0\fs24 \cf0 My results here suggest a call back to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels\'97 rather than German horror stories\'97 as the forbears of the Gothic. [These frameworks are sensitive to different aspects of the Gothic.] Ernest Baker, for example, argues that \'93[t]he sources of Gothic romance\'85 are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abb\'e9 Pr\'e9vost and elaborated later on by Baculard d\'92Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abb\'e9\'92s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion\'94 (175). In this history of the genre, [German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre]: \'93Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors\'94 (Baker 176). [Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers\'92 \'93feelings of superstition\'94 in service of varying gradations of fear.] [What Baker is sensitive to is the emotional content.]}

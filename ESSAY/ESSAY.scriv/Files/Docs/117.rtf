\f0\fs24 \cf0 Influenced by Joanna Drucker\'92s warnings that [graphs] too easily give the impression of a quantitative and objective truth which cannot exist, particularly in humanities [investigations] (\'93Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display\'94), I have [made my graphic design decisions procedurally generated]. [The goal is for the visual presentation of each chart to qualitatively indicate [stuff], and thus make them a fruitful body for interpretive readings.] The size of each circle, for example, reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two colors in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages.  I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose starkly-constrasted colours nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif [is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps], its chart doesn\'92t have two camps. [All these design choices further emphasize my model\'92s sensitivity to each motif\'92s gendered use.] [Each chart is able to immediately provide an answer to the question, \'93does knowing that this motif appears in a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book\'92s author?\'94]}

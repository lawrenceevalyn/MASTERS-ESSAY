\f0\fs24 \cf0 The charts\'92 design is meant to render the charts a fruitful body for interpretive readings. The size of each circle, for example, reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two colors in each chart reflects the difference between the percentages. This latter choice is motivated by my desire to identify motifs that have strong predictive power: if a motif is used completely equally by men and women, for example, it is not a useful tool to draw distinctions between two camps. Accordingly, if the motif [is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps], its chart doesn\'92t have two camps. [Preliminary mention of what I will argue about these pie charts.]}

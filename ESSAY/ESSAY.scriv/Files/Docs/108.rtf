\f0\fs24 \cf0 [My interest in placing Radcliffe back into the broadest possible context is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published
\i  The Mysteries of Udolpho
\i0 , widely recognized as a master of her craft, 
\f1 she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of the circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers the way that \'91literary fiction\'92 is separated from \'91romance novels\'92 today. 
\f0 This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow\'92s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but a self-defining process. Individual texts, Frow argues, \'93do not \'91belong\'92 to genres but are, rather, uses of them\'94 (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategicall fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the \'93social situation\'94 of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that \'93realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands\'94 (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize \'93where a text \'91belongs,\'92\'94 Frow argues, \'93we read\'85 for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke\'94 through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of \'93which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,\'94 and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Accordingly, any investigation of Radcliffe\'92s use of genre must begin with an understanding of what she\'92s using.}

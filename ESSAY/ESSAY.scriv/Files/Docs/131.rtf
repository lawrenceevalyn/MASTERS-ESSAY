\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this model, the Gothic is defined as a spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility \'97 all of which, Baker argues, are distinguished from each other only by \'93intensification\'94, and not in terms of fundamental type (120). Thompkins, too, argues that \'91fantastic\'92 plot elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it: in the Gothic, she argues, "the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-teller's stock in trade\'94 (57), rendering these stories [functionally the same as what she terms the sensational novel.] [We can reject their realist teleology without rejecting this sensitivity to emotional response.] [Doing so allows us to better place the Gothic in context with other eighteenth century works, as it participates directly in Englightenment conversations about human nature and rationality.] [It also allows us to see the \'91school of Radcliffe\'92 in a new light, returning to Clara McIntyre\'92s assessment that \'93her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure\'94 (77), in her development of suspense.]}

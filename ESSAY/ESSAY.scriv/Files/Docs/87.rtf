\f0\fs24 \cf0 This readerly voraciousness is particularly [important] in light of John Frow\'92s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but a self-defining process. Individual texts, Frow argues, \'93do not \'91belong\'92 to genres but are, rather, uses of them\'94 (2), [explain this idea]. Genres function by \'93mediat[ing] between a social situation\'94 of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, \'93and the text which realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands\'94 (14). \
any investigation of Radcliffe\'92s use of genre must begin with an understanding of 
\i what
\i0  she\'92s using.\

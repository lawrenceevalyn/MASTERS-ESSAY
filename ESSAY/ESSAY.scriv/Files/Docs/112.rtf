\f0\fs24 \cf0 Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, [it] is no longer a model at all, but the [thing itself]; tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study (too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence), and so models are always \'93fictional\'94 (McCarty CITE).  \'93Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness.\'94 (McCarty CITE).

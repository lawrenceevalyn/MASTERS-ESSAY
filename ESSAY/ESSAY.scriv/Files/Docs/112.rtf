\f0\fs24 \cf0 [My own modeling framework is informed by all of these.] [My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation.] [Sensitivity: the selection of a particular dataset renders particular distinctions more salient than others.] [Tracy\'92s motifs emphasize what happens. Texts are fragmented. The description of someone who is \'91a parricide\'92 in Melmoth (CITE) is placed on equal footing with [other parricides]] [In contrast, Frank\'92s Gothic types emphasize a work\'92s overall tone. His evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. We are given no guidance as to what might cause a work to be \'91CATEGORY ONE\'92 versus \'91CATEGORY TWO\'92.] [The two bibliographies are thus, themselves, two very different deformative models of \'91The Gothic Novel\'92.] [I\'92ve chosen these two because they complement each other.] My procedural visualizations of each bibliography\'92s content further deform and model each bibliography, emphasizing the [focus?/sensitivity] that each already has.] [My visualizations turn them into new objects to be read and interpreted.] [Tracy is more about individual moments.] [Frank is more about qualitative overall assessments.] [But my use of them has allowed the implicit axes of distinction to be obvious.] [I\'92ve been able to see whether these distinctions are fruitful, and whether they accord with out expectations.]}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Frank directly identifies many works as imitations of other works. 12 works are identified as \'91Radcliffian\'92 (18 counting Radcliffe\'92s own 6 works), 3 as imitations of The Monk, and 5 more as \'91monastic shockers\'92 (4 and 6 when The Monk is counted twice and included in both categories). The gender breakdowns of these categories are precisely what we would expect: all 18 Radcliffian novels are by women, and 7 of the 9 novels identified as Monk-ian or as monastic shockers are by men.}

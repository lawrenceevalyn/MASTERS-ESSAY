\f0\fs24 \cf0 As the first step toward a more comprehensive perspective, therefore, I have begun by surveying the 208 novels described in detail in Ann Tracy's The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs, treating these texts as an approximate model of the Gothic in this period. For each 'motif' identified by Tracy as appearing in a large enough number of works to be worths examining in further detail, I have calculated how often it has been deployed by men versus women. The question is thus framed, not as, "what do men usually write about?" but rather, "what motifs, if any, serve as useful predictors for an author's gender?"-- a framing which does not attempt to define pre-determined categories, but rather places its emphasis on potential points of difference, and which therefore makes its first task proving the existence of that difference.\
At first glance, the gendered differences are not, in fact, particularly striking. 39 of the 70 motifs-- 55% of them-- are distinguished by less than a 60-40 split, with three perfect ties. Of the 31 that show a notable contrast, only eight show a difference of more than 70-30.\
Moreover, the motifs characterized by a strong contrast tend to appear in relatively few works, making up a correspondingly minor part of the average reader's experience of the genre. Of the five most-represented motifs-- fainting, confinement, abduction, storm, and suicide mentions-- the suicide mentions show the greatest contrast, with a ratio of 61% male authors to 39% female.\
On the whole, then, male and female writers seem to have more commonalities than they do differences.}

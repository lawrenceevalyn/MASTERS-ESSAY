\f0\fs24 \cf0 To take the first steps toward that understanding, I have created and carefully examined visualizations of metadata regarding 208 early Gothic texts. My data derives from Ann Tracy\'92s bibliography 
\i The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs
\i0  and Frederick Frank\'92s 
\i The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel
\i0 ; my experimental method is informed by Willard McCarty\'92s \'93Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies\'94 and by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann\'92s \'93Deformance and Interpretation.\'94 After carrying out a wide range of experiments, I have selected two of the most fruitful to discuss in depth: I have charted the gendered use of 70 Gothic \'91motifs\'92 identified by Tracy, and [explored Frank\'92s classifications of the same novels\'92 various \'91Gothic types\'92]. Most in need of explanation, I suspect, is my decision not to focus on any of the experiments which involved actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic\'92s first flourishing. [However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. I don\'92t wish to replicate this emphasis of attention. My goal is not to examine Radcliffe herself, but the \'91school of Radcliffe\'92; although I can see less clearly, I can see more broadly, which suits my particular questions.]}

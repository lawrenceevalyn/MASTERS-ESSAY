\f0\fs24 \cf0 [My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist \'97 sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself.] [I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as \'91Gothic,\'92 but rather what constitutes \'91normal\'92 within this pool.] [In doing so, I have found evidence of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions.] [However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel nature of any binar distinctions one might wish to draw.] [McCarty argues that \'93a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question\'94 \'97 of these, he says, \'93failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result\'94 (CITE).] }

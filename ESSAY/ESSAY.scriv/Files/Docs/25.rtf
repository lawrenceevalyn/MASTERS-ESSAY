\f0\fs24 \cf0 My first and simplest attempt to find historical bibliographic evidence of contemporary genre categorization was my search for the Female and Male Gothics in Ann Tracy\'92s bibliography. In addition to her invaluable plot summaries of 208 novels, Tracy\'92s text includes a ten-page index listing the novels in which various \'93motifs\'94 can be found. Tracy uses the term \'93motif\'94 broadly, to encompass a wide range of images, plot elements, and character types, because the index itself is built to be used as a simple starting point for in-depth explorations of particular topics. However, a modern spreadsheet program renders trivially easy what would have been a monumental feat of correlation in 1981 when Tracy\'92s work was published, and I have adapted her index to a different purpose: charting the genders of the indexed authors, I have asked which motifs \'97 if any \'97 can serve as predictors of the authorial gender of a given text. If we know that a novel has a subterannean passage in it, for example, or a monastery, or a prophetic dream, do we know anything about who wrote it? This particular framing of the question\'97 not \'93what do men and women each write about?\'94 but \'93what, if it appears, can be used to distinguish between men and women?\'94 \'97 was chosen to avoid [[FIND THE ARTICLE ABOUT UNPROVABLE CIRCULAR HYPOTHESES]]}

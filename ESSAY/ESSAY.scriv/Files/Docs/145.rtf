\f0\fs24 \cf0 Just as I had to work against the grain of Tracy\'92s preference for uniqueness and difference in order to [seek connections and correlations between motifs], so too have I [worked against the grain of Frank\'92s model], this time in the reverse direction: I have sought to separate out each strand, to treat it as [a category existing beyond the texts it applies to], so that [I can examine each one individually]. Rather than trying to define a single \'93Gothic type\'94 for each work, I divided each \'93Gothic type\'94 into a set of tags, and tallied the use of each tag the same way I tallied Tracy\'92s motifs. The novel 
\i A Suffolk Tal
\i0 e, for example, listed in Frank as \'93Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)\'94 (315), was tagged as \'93domestic\'94 and \'93Gothic elements.\'94 Similarly, Radcliffe\'92s 
\i Italian
\i0 , listed as \'93Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)\'94 (302), tagged as \'93high,\'94 \'93Gothic,\'94 \'93terror mode,\'94 \'93horror mode,\'94 and \'93Radcliffean.\'94 By allowing each individual phrase of Frank\'92s Gothic types to become its own tag, I allowed the most important categories\'97 and their relationships\'97 to emerge with as little critical intervention as possible. My further [analysis of gender] followed the same principles as my [analysis] of Tracy\'92s motifs: each chart was built to answer the question, \'93does knowing that this tag is associated with a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book\'92s author?\'94 Because Frank\'92s classifications are subjective attempts to [assess the overall tone of a work in context], rather than [boolean checklist items], an answer of \'93yes\'94 to this question no longer tells us \'93this motif is a useful predictor of gender,\'94 but rather indicates \'93the critical [definition] of this genre tag is responding to a gendered usage.\'94}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Of those charts that did seem to indicate a gendered trend, 29 of them indicated male dominance of largely the things we would expect men to dominate. These motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death may be slightly female-dominated, but murder is male-dominated, as are blood, corpses, and bones. These motifs suggest that men are more likely not to simply mention death as a plot device or an inevitability, but rather to dwell vividly upon its effects. Similarly, human sacrifice, putrefaction, starvation, and torture all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply.}

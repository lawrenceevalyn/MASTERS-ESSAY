Dear Dr. XXXXX,

I write to you in your role as Managing Editor for Eighteenth-Century Studies. I am currently revising an article on the early Gothic which I would like to submit to ECS, and I hoped you could give me some information. How long does it generally take the journal to let authors know whether their manuscript has been sent on for review? Are there any special or theme issues coming up?

On a very nitty-gritty level, my article involves quantitative analysis best illustrated with a number of figures -- I see that ECS accepts illustrations when pertinent to the article (and of course I have the copyright as I made them myself), but could you tell me, what is the journal's policy on printing in colour? And is there a ballpark number of figures which would be most appropriate to the journal?

Many thanks for your time.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gende...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the imp...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>can't ID a genre in isolation</strong><br/>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (R...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I'm modelling here</strong><br/>[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.] [Whether ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>not all models are computational</strong><br/>[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>also need sensitive interpreters</strong><br/>[These non-computational models are important to remind us that it is not just the model which must be sensitive, but its interpreter.] Samuels and McGann ([[take this fact] as permission to]/[simply extend the accepted procedures of scholarly editions and translations, which write their critical interpretations into texts, when they]) radically rewrite the works they study — putting the lines of poems in reverse order, or deleting everything but the nouns — in quest of a fruitful defamiliarizat...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank and Tracy are models</strong><br/>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy values uniqueness</strong><br/>[First, let us examine Tracy’s model, as implicit in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prior...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Tracy</strong><br/>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitiviti...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Male Gothic</strong><br/>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Female Gothic</strong><br/>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>[Shared?] Gothic</strong><br/>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the mo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no binaries</strong><br/>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel]. These results serve as...</p>

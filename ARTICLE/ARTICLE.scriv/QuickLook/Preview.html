<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gende...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the imp...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>can't ID a genre in isolation</strong><br/>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (R...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I'm modelling here</strong><br/>[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.] [Whether ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>not all models are computational</strong><br/>[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>also need sensitive interpreters</strong><br/>[These non-computational models are important to remind us that it is not just the model which must be sensitive, but its interpreter.] Samuels and McGann ([[take this fact] as permission to]/[simply extend the accepted procedures of scholarly editions and translations, which write their critical interpretations into texts, when they]) radically rewrite the works they study — putting the lines of poems in reverse order, or deleting everything but the nouns — in quest of a fruitful defamiliarizat...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper examines hundreds of popular Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I care about female gothic</strong><br/>[By turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic (particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”), I examine a mass of books that nobody wanted to get stuck reading even when they were first published][(cite garside on publishers’s exasperation)] [nowadays “Almost all of these novels have long since been deservedly forgotten.” (CITE review of Garside)] [More generalist works, too, like The Oxford Handbook, generally a historicist / bibliographical work, take an aesthetic subgenre ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery generally went hand-in-hand with dismissals of the genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consiste...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: bibliographies</strong><br/>Having declared an interest in bibliographies and the turn of the nineteenth century, Peter Garside and James Raven’s monumental The English Novel, 1770–1829 immediately demands consideration. Lee Erickson aptly called it “magnificent” for its scope. [But Garside isn’t so interested in the qualitative.] [A meticulous and comprehensive compendium of precise physical details can’t feed my desire for the idiosyncratic / the aesthetic] [He emphasizes “the full title given to the work, the imprint of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank and Tracy are models</strong><br/>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Mo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>key findings up front: what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy values uniqueness</strong><br/>Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elem...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Tracy</strong><br/>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitat...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-dominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>subterranean passages</strong><br/>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterrane...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>Instead, in this model of the genre, the women’s Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no binaries</strong><br/>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank values context</strong><br/>Having explored one bibliographic model in depth, we now have a point of comparison for our next model of men and women’s Gothics. Although it attempts to model the same field, Frederick Frank’s bibliography encourages a very different understanding of the texts he indexes. Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favo...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Frank</strong><br/>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>Frank’s women’s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women’s writing. Unlike Tracy, he indexes far more women than men (X men and Y women, compared to her X men and Y women), in keeping with the idea of a female-authored deluge of writing. [Transition,] three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” work...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model. Like in Tracy, the men’s tags generally apply only to very few novels, reflecting a minor tradition. Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these minor men’s tags. The ones that do exist reinforce the conclusions we drew more strongly based on Tracy’s model. Men outnumber women in the “Germanic” tag (which encompasses “German”, “Germanic”, “Schauerroman”, “Rauberroman”, and “Ritterroman”) — of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%). “Horro...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>Frank’s Gothic mainstream [is largely non-gendered]. The two most prevalent tags [in the corpus as a whole, representing all Gothic without attention paid to authorial gender] are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole. Our only hint of a gendered trend is the third most prevalent tag, “terror” (34% of works), which, at 50% female, is just above the female baseline. [This is not exciting.] The next two tags in...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>this CRIES OUT for correlation</strong><br/>Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It’s been a open question to this point whether Frank’s Gothic types were responding to actually gendered usage or imposing gendered interpretations. When it comes to assessing a work as “polemical” versus “didactic”, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author’s gender. [But Tracy’s boolean motifs — although they may be prone to false ne...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>some horror motifs</strong><br/>[There are some horror motifs, and they seem reasonable] At the top of the list is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif. [This striking result lends credence to the work of scholars like Robert Miles who take conspiracy as a central horror-Gothic concern.] [Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the exact same level of increase — 48% more secret doors in “horror” novels than in the corpus as a whol...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>weaker terror motifs</strong><br/>The “terror” tag, as expected, is less strongly defined by its motifs. Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within “terror” works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points — none of them represent even a 20% increase over the baseline. [This is in sharp contrast to the 43 motifs which appear in “horror” works with a 20% or greater increase in frequency.] If we examine the top of the “terror” list anyway, the tag shows an anemic increase in fainting (1...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank-and-Tracy-based conclusion</strong><br/>[This correlation, essentially, confirms that our rough guess was right re: Tracy’s motifs, that the men’s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women’s Gothic less so.] [It also suggests that, when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it (men’s horror) at the expense of non-motif-ifiable features which better define the mainstream.]<br/>

Everybody takes the generic categories of “male” and “female” Gothic for granted, though we quibble over what makes up each one. My interest is in something less fine-grained: not the exempary literary aesthetic of the Female Gothic, but the popular social phrenomenon of a women’s Gothic. I use two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic. My met...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gende...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the imp...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>can't ID a genre in isolation</strong><br/>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (R...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>my approach to experimentation</strong><br/>My approach to literary experimentation is shaped by Willard McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling”, with influence from Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s discussion of “deformance”, to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty points to modeling as “a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world”. My spreadsheets and graphs of early Gothic novels thus constitute models [seeking to capture the gen...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>reasonable to think authoresses are different</strong><br/>[As the name implies, the social role of the “authoress” was distinct from that of the “author”.] [Radcliffe, and many of her female peers, published as “Mrs Radcliffe” rather than using a first name, highlighting her gender of the title page.] [And of course, everybody else thought the genre was by and for women as well.]</p>

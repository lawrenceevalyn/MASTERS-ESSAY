<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gende...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I care about female gothic</strong><br/>[By I turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic (particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”), I examine a mass of books that nobody wanted to get stuck reading even when they were first published][(cite garside on publishers’s exasperation)] [nowadays “Almost all of these novels have long since been deservedly forgotten.” (CITE review of Garside)] [but they are much less uniform so I will seek to attend to their real variety]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>can't ID a genre in isolation</strong><br/>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (R...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: bibliographies</strong><br/>[Garside’s bib would be the obvious choice here. It’s aptly called “AMAZING” (CITE) for how amazing it is.] [But Garside isn’t so interested in the qualitative.] [He emphasizes “the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified”] [He’s interested in “the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers” (CITE)] [The key editorial intervention is the inclusion of contemporary reviews (also The ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank and Tracy are models</strong><br/>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>key findings up front: what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the imp...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy values uniqueness</strong><br/>Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elem...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Tracy</strong><br/>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitat...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>subterranean passages</strong><br/>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterrane...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. O...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the mo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no binaries</strong><br/>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank values context</strong><br/>[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative struc...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Frank</strong><br/>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 216 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. [My model [imposes a slightly more systematic ontology, treat...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>[In Frank’s model of the Gothic, it is the women’s Gothic which is most immediately visible.] [Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect.] [43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but those 43% are responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” works, and a striking 77% of the “sentimental.”] [Interestingly suggests that 18thC critics weren’t entirely wrong when they panicked about women writing senti...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>[A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model] [Like in Tracy’s the men’s tags are mostly visible among the tags which apply only to very few novels / make up a minor tradition.] [Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these] [But men actually outnumber women in the “Germanic” tag (which encompasses “German”, “Germanic”, “Schauerroman”, “Rauberroman”, and “Ritterroman”) — of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%).] [“Horror”, too, is disproportionately male — 42%, fairly above their b...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>[Frank’s mainstream is a little more female than Tracy’s.] [The two most prevalent tags are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have men women and unknown at almost perfectly their baselines] [But the third most prevalent tag is “terror” (34% of works), which is 50% female, a bit above the female baseline.] [The next two tags in prominence highlight Frank’s [embrace of multiplicity?]: “mode” (27%) and “elements” (27%), which generally appear as qualifiers for his oth...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>some horror motifs</strong><br/>[There are some horror motifs, and they seem reasonable] [Top of the list is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif] [Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the exact same level of increase — 48% more secret doors in “horror” novels than in the corpus as a whole.] [“Horror” Gothics also have 47% more prophetic dreams, 46% more corpses, 40% more drugging, and 39% more banishment.] [In all of these, “h...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>weaker terror motifs</strong><br/>[The “terror” tag is less strongly defined by its motifs.] [It has no motifs which appear with 20% greater frequency in “terror” works than in the baseline.] [This is in sharp contrast to the “horror” tag, which had 43 motifs occurring in horror works with 20% greater frequency or higher.] [“Terror” shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than baseline), suicide mentions (18%), female fainting (18%), and secret doors (18%), but all of these appear more in “horror” works than they do in “t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>motifs: seduced by scenery</strong><br/>[This correlation, essentially, confirms that our rough guess was right re: Tracy’s motifs, that the men’s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women’s Gothic less so.] [It also suggests that, when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it (men’s horror) at the expense of non-motif-ifiable features which better define the mainstream.] [Frank’s more subjective model [takes more work to render graspable / provides fewer thi...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Baker: sentimental -> Gothic</strong><br/>I thus return to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, [tells this kind of history in his YEAR work TITLE:<br/>
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>the teleological model</strong><br/>Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. [Nonethel...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>reject teleology, keep emotion</strong><br/>I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: [its understanding of the Gothic as continuous, rather than a break]. [The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as] as spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by “intensification,” and not in terms of fundamental type. Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, “the accepted themes were repeated ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>learned a valuable lesson about models</strong><br/>[The framework of modelling makes it possible to go ever farther back in our research past] [Surface reading and computational analysis can look like a break with the past] [But they don’t have to be!] [Continuities in the history of the Gothic; changes of quantity, not fundamental kind] [Continuities in the pattern of our research; changes of tools, not fundamental kind]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gende...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review: female gothic</strong><br/>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what I do</strong><br/>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the imp...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>can't ID a genre in isolation</strong><br/>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (R...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I'm modelling here</strong><br/>[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.] [Whether ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>not all models are computational</strong><br/>[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank and Tracy are models</strong><br/>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy values uniqueness</strong><br/>[First, let us examine Tracy’s model, as implicit in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prior...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Tracy</strong><br/>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitiviti...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Male Gothic</strong><br/>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Female Gothic</strong><br/>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>[Shared?] Gothic</strong><br/>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the mo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no binaries</strong><br/>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel]. These results serve as...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank values context</strong><br/>[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] [Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens.] His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative str...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>same novel different types!!!</strong><br/>Most strikingly, The Mysteries of Ferney Castle is listed twice, once under each of its disputed authors, and receives a different Gothic type in each entry: Pure or high Gothic (terror mode) at entry 188 by Robert Huish, and  Gothified history (Radcliffean imitation) at entry 222 by G. Lambe.</p>

</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Frank</strong><br/>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” becomes “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Simi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Male Gothic</strong><br/>[In Tracy, the Male Gothic was a distinct [grouping] of what seem to be horror-Gothics, outnumbered by [the Shared Gothic].] [Frank does confirm the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary.] The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged “terror” and only 24 (13%) tagged “horror.” The more-popular terror mode is non-gendered (53% female, 47% male), while the horror mode tends toward male authorship (62% male). However, of those 24 novels ta...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>[Shared?] Gothics</strong><br/>[All kinds of schools not often accorded central importance to the Gothic, but none of them dominate.] The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence, from most popular to least popular, are “high Gothic” (35%), “terror” (34%), “history” (16%), “domestic” (15%), “horror” (13%), “sentimental” (13%), “Radcliffean” (10%), “chapbook” (9%), “naturalized or explained” (6%), Schauerromantik (6%), and “Monk imitation / monastic shocker” (5%). Only “high Gothic” ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Female Gothic</strong><br/>However, Frank’s model does point toward a [female] gendered tradition in Radcliffean and sentimental novels. Frank identifies twelve novels as explicit imitations of Radcliffe; the “Radcliffe” tag includes those twelve, and Radcliffe’s own six novels — and all eighteen are by women. Nearly as strongly predictive of female authorship is the “sentimental” tag (92% female). [Tracy’s model was not sensitive to these features because they are not defined by individual plot devices.] [By looking at w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>sentiment explains Simple Story</strong><br/>The picture which Frank’s model paints, of a Female Gothic equally as tied to the sentimental novel as to the high Gothic, [points toward a new understanding of the Gothic’s geneaology generally.] [This new sentimental geneaology makes some things about the Gothic more clear.] [A full acknowledgement of the Gothic’s sentimental ties can explain, for example, the comparison of Udolpho to Elizabeth Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzles Clara McIntyre in Ann Radcliffe in Relation To Her Time.]...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Baker: sentimental -> Gothic</strong><br/>I thus return to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, [tells this kind of history in his YEAR work TITLE:<br/>
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>the teleological model</strong><br/>Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. [Nonethel...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>reject teleology, keep emotion</strong><br/>I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: [its understanding of the Gothic as continuous, rather than a break]. [The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as] as spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by “intensification,” and not in terms of fundamental type. Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, “the accepted themes were repeated ...</p>

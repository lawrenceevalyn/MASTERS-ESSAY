            <Title>my model of Tracy</Title>
            <Text>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitivitity to [???] for sensitivity to [?????]] An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate a Male Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.</Text>
            <Comments>Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts. 
I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.</Comments>

            <Title>Frank values context</Title>
            <Text>[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] [Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens.] His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception. Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, Frank provides 131 unique classifications. [His “types” accord with Frow’s understanding of genre; it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses.] His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), correcting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traces systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.

            <Comments>The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.
Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.</Comments>

            <Title>Male Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</Text>

            <Text>[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Samuels and McGann, then, [embrace the reality of mental modeling]/[use these necessary models to their fullest extent] [by doing what McCarty calls “distortion”]</Text>

            <Title>footnote for pie charts</Title>
            <Text>The graphic design decisions underlying my graphs are procedurally generated. The goal is for the visual presentation of each chart to qualitatively indicate relationships, and thus make them a fruitful body for interpretive readings. I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually represent Tracy’s treatment of each motif as a self-contained field which may or may not have distinct divisions within it. The size of each circle reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two shades of gray in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages. I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose stark contrast nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif itself is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps, its chart doesn’t show two camps. All these design choices further emphasize my model’s sensitivity to each motif’s gendered use. Each chart is able to immediately provide an answer to the question, “does knowing that this motif appears in a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book’s author?” </Text>

            <Text>[These non-computational models are important to remind us that it is not just the model which must be sensitive, but its interpreter.] Samuels and McGann ([[take this fact] as permission to]/[simply extend the accepted procedures of scholarly editions and translations, which write their critical interpretations into texts, when they]) radically rewrite the works they study — putting the lines of poems in reverse order, or deleting everything but the nouns — in quest of a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study. Their procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing” by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. This act of defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know”, because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. [My computational models are partly anout the actual pieces of information I manipulate, but also partly about re-understanding the limits of our knowledge about the early Gothic.]</Text>

            <Title>sentiment explains Simple Story</Title>
            <Text>The picture which Frank’s model paints, of a Female Gothic equally as tied to the sentimental novel as to the high Gothic, [points toward a new understanding of the Gothic’s geneaology generally.] [This new sentimental geneaology makes some things about the Gothic more clear.] [A full acknowledgement of the Gothic’s sentimental ties can explain, for example, the comparison of Udolpho to Elizabeth Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzles Clara McIntyre in Ann Radcliffe in Relation To Her Time.] In response to a review which declared Udolpho to be “the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s Simple Story,” McIntyre is taken aback by the expression “of this kind”. She says, “The reviewer must surey be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” McIntyre draws a tentative connection based on “the ethical purpose of the book,” which in Inchbald is “rather too obvious for successful art,” but decides that although Radcliffe’s writing, “it is true, was strictly moral,” Radcliffe’s “main interest” does not lie in moralizing. McIntyre has thus identified what I argue is the key connection between the two works, but overlooks its significance: moral sentiment, and its connection to the emotional experience of the reader, is the throughline which connects the Gothic deeply to its non-Gothic literary context, and to the broader intellectual debates at the end of the Englightenment.</Text>

            <Title>my model of Frank</Title>
            <Text>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” becomes “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Similarly, Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “high”, “Gothic”, “terror mode”, “horror mode”, and “Radcliffean.” This process generated 45 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two novels. [My model of the Gothic types, then, has X assumptions and priorities.] From there, my search for gendered types followed the same principles as my analysis of Tracy’s motif, asking, does the association of this tag with a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author? [Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different moves], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Perhaps for that reason, Frank’s Gothic types do not point toward a clear Male Gothic tradition, but do show a Female Gothic.]</Text>

            <Title>Female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who are using them.] Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a new Female Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, [whose] ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. However, [four is a small number, and unlike the wide-ranging male motifs which were well over the 60% line, it would only take a very few writers — or one domestic Ann Radcliffe — to produce these results]. The paucity of female motifs suggests that [seeing/defining a genre here] may be too hasty: this Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the [Shared??] Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>Frank and Tracy are models</Title>
            <Text>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. [Although only 178 of Tracy’s 208 novels also appear among Frank’s 500 entries, the two usefully complement [/shed light on] each other.] The procedure of graphing each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct Male Gothic and Female Gothic modes.</Text>

            <Title>Baker: sentimental -&gt; Gothic</Title>
            <Text>I thus return to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, [tells this kind of history in his YEAR work TITLE:
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbés novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance through its course. It was all derivative of the cult of emotion…
In this history of the Gothic, German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre:
Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appettites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors[.]
The Gothic is well-established before the first hints of “German folk-lore”, which only arrives “later on” and only in the works of “those who had become acquainted” with it. Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of the central emotional experience of fear. Baker’s historical model is not sensitive to the features of the Gothic which now draw attention — he does not make his distinctions based on politics or aesthetics or gender — instead, he defines the Gothic by its emotional manipulations.</Text>

            <Text>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. [This is basically mathematically inevitable, and points to the impossibility of a genre being one genre with two non-overlapping schools.] In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [Include percentage of total novels per motif.] Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows a gendered divide.</Text>

            <Title>the teleological model</Title>
            <Text>Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. [Nonetheless, he writes on the basis of a model of the genre’s history / what’s important about it] The assumptions of his model, however, remain implicit in the moralizing judgments throughout his work. Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness,” for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful. J.M.S. Tompkins, too, dismisses the Gothic on the basis of these kinds of assumptions: with the rise of the Gothic, she says, “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probability, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern.” [We often talk about the “magic lantern” of the Gothic in positive terms, but Tompkins clearly sees this “slip[ping] farther away” as a problem.] Both Baker and Tompkins model the novel itsels as a training-ground for the mind, through which habits of thought are established, and which therefore ought to inculcate the “right” mode of thought. Accordingly, both model the Gothic as a dangerously emotional and disordered mode of thought, notable not for its plots or sets or even which emotions are induced, but defined entirely by the emotionally overpowering nature of the reading experience.</Text>

            <Text>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel].

However, of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books are pure “horror mode.” If we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, seaparating out the “horror-terror” mixed-mode books as a third mode, our gendered expectations fall apart: the 10 pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors. Instead, it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship (71% male).

            <Text>I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: [its understanding of the Gothic as continuous, rather than a break]. [The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as] as spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by “intensification,” and not in terms of fundamental type. Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, “the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-tellers stock in trade.”  [The “fantastic” elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it.] We can reject their realist teleology without rejecting their sensitivity to emotional response. Doing so allows us to better place the Gothic in context with other eighteenth century works, such that the Gothic participates directly in Englightenment conversations about human nature and rationality.</Text>

            <Title>monastic shockers</Title>
            <Text> Radcliffe’s opposite in this binary is the “Monk / monastic” tag; no works were identified as imitations of Lewis himself, but nine (including The Monk itself) are identified as an imitation of The Monk, a “monastic shocker,” or both. Of these nine, seven are by men. The ‘school of Radcliffe’ does thus appear to be a female-dominated school which stands in contrast to a smaller, less-distinct but male-dominated ‘school of Lewis’ — which raises the question of why neither Tracy’s motifs nor Frank’s horror and terror Gothic types showed evidence of these schools. </Text>

            <Title>Abstract feedback from Alyssa</Title>
            <Text>Hello from Detroit!

That's so exciting about the chapbook! It throws a wrench in the works, but having two plagiarized works to draw on could bring out some really interesting new conclusions (or significantly strengthen the existing ones).

1. The most important idea was that men and women don't write substantially different gothic texts.

2. Each individual sentence is very clear. They feel a little disjointed, but once I read through the abstract the whole picture fell into place. The only place where I could use a little more context is the last sentence. That's in part because I'm missing some of the vocabulary and background knowledge, and in part because I'm not sure how your analysis connects to that conclusion. It sounds like an idea with some sweeping implications, so it might deserve a little more context. 

3. I think you could maybe trim down a little here: 

"This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers."

To

"This paper examines hundreds of popular Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers."

26 to 21 words--not a huge difference, but it might give you some room elsewhere. That change depends on whether the goal of "hundreds" in the original sentence was to indicate the overall size of your sample or the large number of female gothic writers in the eighteenth century... my version would cover the former, but is less effective at communicating the latter.

Let me know how it goes! I love being a part of your process with these things.

Love and luck,

            <Text>[All kinds of schools not often accorded central importance to the Gothic, but none of them dominate.] The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence, from most popular to least popular, are “high Gothic” (35%), “terror” (34%), “history” (16%), “domestic” (15%), “horror” (13%), “sentimental” (13%), “Radcliffean” (10%), “chapbook” (9%), “naturalized or explained” (6%), Schauerromantik (6%), and “Monk imitation / monastic shocker” (5%). Only “high Gothic” and “terror” apply to more than a quarter of the works. [Frank doesn’t really show a unified Gothic at all.] [But it’s mainly non-gendered, and definitely doesn’t operate by binaries.]</Text>

            <Text>Humanities journals are less likely to publish abstracts, but they are still a useful tool in thinking through your article and getting it through the peer review process. In the humanities, published abstracts often tend to omit information on the methodology or findings. The order of information also tends to be looser than in social science abstracts. The basic ingredients of a solid abstract in the humanities can include the following. 
	•	Context-that is, information on the historical period, the geographic region, the social conditions surrounding the human creations being investigated 
	•	Subject-the literary or artistic works being discussed, their creators and dates 
	•	Claim for significance-announcement about the uniqueness of the subject or your approach to it 
	•	Theoretical framework-often more suggested than stated, the theory you are using to discuss the subject, such as feminist or psychoanalytic approaches
	•	Argument-what your analysis of the subject revealed about the subject, current approaches to the subject, or society
	•	Proofs-your evidence for your argument about the subject, or the elements of the subject that you analyze (such as textual passages) </Text>

            <Title>conclusion: no binaries</Title>
            <Text>My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself. I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool. In doing so, I have found evidence at various points of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions. However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel nature of any binary distinctions one might wish to draw. McCarty argues that “a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question” — of these, he says, “failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result” (McCarty). Accordingly, my failure to find a an obvious or stable gender divide within the Gothic is valuable as evidence that in the broadest context of the Gothic, the conversation occurring between novels is not driven by authorial gender.</Text>

            <Text>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.</Text>

            <Title>lit review: female gothic</Title>
            <Text>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”, to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”. Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [social] relationships to intertextual ones, as exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”. These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go back to the social reality of gender.]</Text>

            <Text>The novel of sentiment:
“Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox, both brought up in the school of Richardson, yielded eventually to the taste for something less humdrum than domestic realism, and at the same time, far from renouncing or abating their fits of emotional indulgence and their pervading sentimentality, screwed up the tension, and dragged their lovers and heroines through stranger trials and more sensational adventures than could be counted among ordinary contingencies.” (Baker 91)
“Richardson had founded the English novel of sensibility; but, after all, sensibility was ot an object with Richardson, who wrote to inculcate prudence and self-control. … But sensibility soon became an object of engrossing interest and an end in itself” (Baker 95)

“That amoral person Sterne cared nothing for edification… He fondled his sensibility, he never tired of playing with it; he was a debauched sentimentalist, aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95 Baker)

“It would be inexact to say that the influence of Richardson was waning towards the end of the seventeen-sixties; if his novels were tending to go out of favour and to be superseded by new kinds of sentimental fiction, it was simply that he had established a cult and his devotees had gone beyong him.” (Baker 96) - Sterne and Mackenzie as prime examples
“It was the French Richardsonians, pursuing a trend already observable in their own literature, who first outwent their acknowledged leader.” (Baker 97)

“Some signs of the romantic scene-painting soon to be a marked characteristic of Gothic fiction are observable in Julia de Roubigné, and may reasonably be credited to the example of Prévost, who loved to set the stage gloomily for the experiences of his ill-starred lovers.” (Baker 110) “sensitivity to the sombre and dearful, which was presently to reach a fever-pitch in Charlotte Smith and Mrs Radcliffe” (Baker 110)

“moral improvement was decidedly the chief end that he [i.e., Mackenzie] envisaged in estimating the value of fiction; in other words, he takes exactly the same view as Dr Johnson and most other critics of that day” (Baker 112)
but Mackenzie doesn’t consider himself a sentimental novelist?

Henry Brooke more sentimental than Mackenzie — “Brook’s hero and his friends burst into tears alike in sympathy with grief and at any example of human affection or of nobility of soul.” (Baker 115)

novel of sensibility is mostly a more intense novel of sentiment (Baker 120). At first, “Sensibility accepted the rule of reason” (Baker 121), but over time “though fiction came by various stages nearer to life,” “In the later romances… sensibility was forced like a hot-house plant, and grew more and more artificial, affected, pretentious” (121).

“The novels of Prévost contain all the materials for the novel of sensibility. They also have in them a good part of the material that was son to be utilized in what came to be nicknamed the Gothic novel.” (Baker 130) primarily “his gloomy scene-painting”
“Prévost was less than half a realist, and much more than half a romancer” (Baker 131) …a variety of French authors who build on &amp; exaggerate Prévost

“The most distinguished English novel in line of descent from Richardson, which shows unmistakable traces of some infusion of blood from… Prévost… is that novel by Mrs Frances Sheridan, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph… (1761)” (Baker 141)

The History of the English Novel, Volume V: The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance

Enormous interlude on Fanny Burney, who “provides an interlude of natural comedy in the long monotone of solemn and pretentious sentimentalism” (154)

“Mystery and Wonder, Fear and Suspense, Sensation and Terror, are some of the labels affixed by different historians to the romantic novels that traded in one or another, or in all of these excitements, during the last few decades of the eighteenth century. The rather absurd term ‘Gothic’ is perhaps more convenient, and may be allowed to include both those than contented themselves with a discreet use of fear and suspense, and also those which sought the grosser sensations of terror and brutally aimed to make the flesh creep.” (Baker 175)
“It was a term applied first in derision… Then it was amiably accepted by Walpole and others, who confessed a fondness for what they called Gothic, little as they understood the real nature of what they admired, and grotesque as were their attempts to imitate it.”

“The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (Baker 175)
“Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.” (Baker 176)</Text>

            <Text>“Most critics who have given any attention to Mrs. Radcliffe as a novelist have decided that she is important chiefly for her use of the supernatural, and for her emphasis upon landscape. Although she is, indeed, a pioneer in both these fields, it has seemed to me that, after all, her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure.” (McIntyre 77)
“Mrs. Radcliffe’s method is founded upon the principle // which Walpole tried with imperfect success to embody in his work — the principle of suspence” (79-80)
Radcliffe’s peers are “Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mrs. Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith” (93)
“One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: ‘This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s /Simple Story/.’ The expression, ‘this kind,’ is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” (McIntyre 94) “…the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art. Mrs. Radcliffe, it is true, was strictly moral… but her main interest does not lie there.”</Text>

            <Text>Frow, John. Genre. London and New York: Routledge, 2006. Print.
	This book’s central task is the reframing of the text-genre relationship, arguing that texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2). Genres function by “mediat[ing] between a social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, “and the text which realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Frow concludes that “what we learn, in ‘doing’ genre (in performing and transforming it) is the values we share or don’t share with others and the means with which to challenge or defend them” (144).</Text>

            <Text>Dear Mr. Evalyn,

Thank you for your enquiry.  It generally takes about a week, sometimes less, for initial review, when the editor and I read a submission and decide whether to send it out for review.  We don’t currently have any CFPs out for special issues.  We do indeed accept illustrations; unfortunately, we don’t currently print in color.  You might look at Michael Gavin’s recent article in 50.1, “Historical Text Networks.”  He was able to create enough difference in grayscale to make the distinctions clear on his graphs.  We have some flexibility in terms of number of figures; we’d prefer not to exceed around 10, but that isn’t a hard-and-fast number.  Please let me know if I can answer any further questions, and thank you once again for your interest in ECS.

Sincerely,

            <Text>Punter, David. The Literature of Terror: A History of Gothic Fictions from 1765 to the Present Day. London and New York: Longman, 1980. Print.
	This book, perhaps the first to pay serious scholarly attention to the wide reach of the Gothic, puts forth “a set of descriptions which will both help to identify the historical Gothic while suggesting reasons for its survival and for the multifarious forms in which it has survived” (20-21). Examining works from the birth of the Gothic to his present day, Punter identifies the unifying element of the Gothic as fear, expressed through a “dialectic of comfort and disturbance” and “a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423). In his final proposal of “a theory of the Gothic,” he argues that “Gothic fiction becomes a process of cultural self-analysis, and the images which it throws up become the dream-figures of a troubled social group.” with “the glance over the shoulder”—a nostalgic attempt to understand the past—as the inherent function of the ghost-story. The Gothic, “at the psychological interface between the well-ordered psyche and its rebel subjects,” may not provide an escape, but can provide “refuge while at the same time undermining the architectural fabric” of the bourgeois ideology which attempts to “naturalise” the unstable situation of society (425-6).

            <Title>what I do</Title>
            <Text>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]</Text>

            <Title>Price</Title>
            <Text>Building toward a reading of the writing style of George Eliot, this book examines in detail the historical conditions of the rise of the anthology and its relationship to the seemingly un-anthologizable novel. Of particular interest is her detailed investigation of the many reworkings of Clarissa published alongside that text, from tables-of-contents meant to help readers ‘catch up’ to a current volume to editions consisting only of the Bible verses Clarissa reads. Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. She concludes with an argument that the works of George Eliot are written intentionally to anticipate their anthologies.

These changes are in keeping with Leah Price’s argument that editing a text does not simply produce a deformed version of the original, but rather produces a new text. Price takes Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa as the prime example of a novel surrounded by re-edited versions of itself; as she notes, each new abridgement reveals its editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13). In the years after Clarissa’s completion, alternate versions proliferated, each rewriting Richardson’s text to suit a new niche: abridgements in which the epistolary format has been replaced with an impersonal retrospective narrator (15); collections of “moral sentiments” excerpted and arranged alphabetically (17); an anthology of the Bible verses mentioned, but not quoted, in the novel, intermingled with both excerpts and summaries (24). Even the index of chapters, originally prefixed to the second edition “in the expectation that readers would have forgotten the beginning by the time they reached the end” (13), circulated as an independent pamphlet that could not just supplement the full text, but potentially replace it (17). Most importantly, several of these rewritings were carried out by Richardson himself; as the author of the original, he would have no need to identically replicate his own approach, but must have arranged each new editions with a different slant.
Richardson’s case establishes the general principle; when Price turns her attention to Radcliffe, she sees Radcliffe’s works as primarily interesting for their intermingling of prose with poetry. Radcliffe’s “beauties” (92), she argues, play the same role as do Richardson’s sentiments: readers may attempt to race through the book “wth. a View only to Story” (Richardson, qtd. in Price 21), but the structure of the book itself will discipline them.  Price’s description of Clarissa seems equally apt for the works of both authors: “the sententious passages which pepper the novel itself are designed less (through their content) to inculcate specific moral lessons than (through their structure) to regulate the pace of reading” (21). However, there is no need to interpret Radcliffe’s “embellishments” (95) as punitive. If nothing else, epigraphs and poems are an unlikely choice of corrective for an author battling the sin of skipping, since their typographical isolation allows readers to identify and ignore them almost without a thought.  Rather, I argue that Radcliffe’s notably extensive “beauties” are, like the technique of the explained supernatural, part of the political-aesthetic agenda discussed above.
Just as her rational explanations allowed Radcliffe to incorporate empowering myths unapologetically into modern literature, so too do her “embellishments” allow her to demonstrate her literary seriousness. Price herself notes that the prevalence in the novel of material that ought not be skipped, particularly her original poetry, “differentiates Radcliffe,” in reviewers’ minds, “from mere entertainers” (97). But Radcliffe doesn’t simply write and quote poetry: she also fills her text with landscapes and architecture, drawing on the literary traditions of travel narratives; with moral contemplations that wouldn’t be out of place in popular sentimental novels; with dramatic structures and staging that owe an obvious debt to the theatre; and, of course, with all the traditions of romance. Even the frustrating digressions of her comic servants come straight from Shakespeare. Walpole had, much earlier, “designedly” introduced bumbling servants based on the model of a “higher authority,” namely, “the great master of nature, SHAKESPEARE” (22). Indeed, Walpole provides a direct description of the Gothic-as-new-Classic framework, comparing Shakespeare to “the Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus… inserted a little boy measuring his thumb” (22). But whereas Walpole must explain and justify his lineage, Radcliffe allows it to go without saying. Walpole’s preface points to specific characters, and scenes, but Radcliffe attributes her epigraphs, whichever play they are drawn from or character they are spoken by, to, simply, “Shakespeare.” In the strength of her unifying vision, Radcliffe is like the Romantic poet, discussed by Tilar Mazzeo; she subordinates all her literary borrowings to a singular goal, ‘mastering’ them with her individual genius, and thus transforms them. Udolpho’s “beauties” go beyond embellishment to create a deeply intertextual novel, which is built upon diverse foundations but stands upon its own authority.

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

—

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Text>My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] </Text>

            <Text>It it telling that Samuels and McGann refer to their deformations as a “deformative program” which is “run… through a particular work” to produce unpredictable but replicable”results” (36).
[Samuels and McGann initially exclude modes of criticism that “do not aim to be interpretive” from their analysis; their examples of ostensibly non-interpretive criticism are “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” but [would include models like mine] (26).] [However, they ultimately conclude that it’s all interpretive (46).] 

Role of experiments: Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40). “‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
they class “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” — [which is basically my stuff] — as non-interpretive (26). [Therefore, that stuff that didn’t look “interpretive” actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]



“The usual object of interpretation is ‘meaning,’ or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable … In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and … some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ‘for’ the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s).” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)
They “propose… another way of engaging imaginative work” which “moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into … performative operations.” They argue that “concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)

Emily Dickinson’s habit of reading poems backward is “a spendid model for… deformative criticism” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). “Her procedure… follows a romantic awareness… that poems lose their vital force when they succumb to familiarization” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). Despite affinity with modernist techniques of estrangement, “Dickinson’s critical model is performative, not intellectual” (Samuels &amp; McGann 29). “Reading Backward short circuits the sign of prose transparency and reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 30)

“First, imaginative work has an elective affinity with performance: it is organized as rhetoric and poiesis rather than as exposition and information-transmission. Because this is so, it always lies open to deformative moves.” Second, “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33) “Here we want to point out that lines of performative and deformative critical activity have always existed,” including “Elaborate scholarly editions” and “translations” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33).
“Because ‘a translation [involves] the necessity of settling many points without discussion,’ [D.G.] Rosetti observes, it ‘remains perhaps the most direct form of commentary’ that can be brought to literary work.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34). For people who dislike Rosetti’s translation, “The critical thoroughness and integrity… is exactly the problem.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34).

“Deformative scholarship is all but forbidden, the thought of it either // irresponsible or damaging to critical seriousness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34-5), likely because the prime example is “Forgery” (35) and the category also includes “mistaken and deviant readings produced… by students unaware of an ignorance in their … understanding” (35). But they set these aside in favor of “interpretive deformation,” as exemplified by “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (Samuels and McGann 35).
“The reluctance shows… that interpreters — even radical ones — do not commonly locate hermeneutic vitality in the documentary features of literary works. Because meaning is assumed to develop as a linguistic event, critical deformance plays itself out in the field of the signifieds.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Critical and interpretive limits are thus regularly established” to excluse consideration of “the physical artifact, whose stability and integrity is taken as inbiolable” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35).
“From an interpretive point of view, this assumption brackets off from attention crutical features of imaginative works… so basic and conventionally governed — they are alphabetical and diacritical. they are the rules for character formation, character arrangement, and textual space, as well as for the structural forms of words, phrases, and higher morphemic and phonemic units— that readers tend to treat them as preinterpetive and precitical. In truth, however, they comprise the operating system of language” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Linguists, semioticians, bibliographers, and cognitive theorists regularly explore these territories, but their work is not normally concerned with interpretation in the customary sense — that is, with explaining aesthetic and stylistic features of works” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).
“But this enlargement of the subject matter of criticism does not define the most significant function of deformative operations. Far most important is the stochastic process it entails. … When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “…we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work,” so that “customary rules are… held in abeyance, to be chosen among… to be followed or nor as one decides,” resulting in “the dramatic exposure of subjectivity as a live and highly informative option of interpretive commentary” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).

They focus on “poetic deformations,” “organized into four types:” (36) reordered, isolating, altering, and adding (36-7). They focus on reordering and isolating poems, taking Wallace Stevens as their experimental ground.

“deformance does not banish interpretation. The reversed text is still subject to, still giving of, interpretive readings. Deformance does want to show that the poem’s intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40).

“we may usefully regard all criticism and interpretation as deformance. Scholars murder to dissect, as Wordsworth famously observed” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46) *** JUST LIKE LEAH PRICE’S ARGUMENT —&gt; Despite approaching the matter from very different projects, [both] have reached a similar conclusion about the [state of criticism] which makes my own approach differ not in fundamenal kind from the norm, but in degree and in [reflexiveness? obviousness?].
“Interpretation is the application of scientia to poiesis, or the effort to elucidate one discourse form in terms of another.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46).
“Interpretation for della Volpe… always displays a gap between the work being examined and the student. But this gap does not represent a failure of criticism, or even a mysticism of poiesis. It locates the source and end and test of the art being examined” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47). The gap comes into being as soon as the critic must paraphrase the text. “Interpretation, then, is a constellation of paraphrases that evolve… from an uncritical to a critical moment” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47)
In della Volpe’s work, “to attempt a socio-historical paraphrase is to experiment with the poetical work, to subject it to a hypothesis of its meanings. As in any scientific experiment with natural phenomena, the engagement with the ordinary phenomenon inevitably exposes the limits of the hypothesis, and ultimaely returns us to an even more acute sense of the phenomena we desire to understand. … By contrast,” their deformances “place primary emphasis on the preconceptual elements of the text” because “social and historical formations seem to us far less determinate, far more open to arbitrary and imaginative construction, than the appear in della Volpe” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works… allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49) 
“To essay a more direct application of ‘interpretation’ to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment withthe work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. … one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)
“To deliberately accept the inevitable failure of interpretive ‘adequacy’ is to work toward discovering new interpretive virtues… This attitude toward literate comprehension, and the kind of criticism it inspires, gains its power by baring its own devices.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)</Text>

            <Title>Tracy values uniqueness</Title>
            <Text>[First, let us examine Tracy’s model, as implicit in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of distinctive individuals motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, the most popular motifs were intentionally excluded: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,” and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”. Tracy’s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — thus become the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.</Text>

            <Text>But "algorithmic criticism" — criticism prompted by the algorithmic manipulation of literary texts — either does not exist, or exists only in nascent form. The digital revolution, for all its wonders, has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies, which, despite numerous revolutions of a more epistemological nature, remains mostly concerned with the interpretive analysis of written cultural artifacts. Texts are browsed, searched, and disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation. Even text analysis practitioners avoid bringing the hermeneutical freedom of criticism to the "outputted" text. Bold statements, strong readings, and broad generalizations (to say nothing of radical misreadings, anarchic accusations, agonistic paratextual revolts) are rare, if not entirely absent from the literature of the field, where the emphasis is far more often placed on methodology and the limitations it imposes.


The computer is certainly incapable of offering "the shift to a redemptive world-view" as a solution to the problem at hand; it is wholly incapable of inferring this from the data. But is it likewise the case that computational results — the data and visualizations that the computer generates when it seeks to quantize and measure textual phenomena — cannot be used to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead one to such a conclusion?
It is useful to put the question this way, because in doing so we refocus the hermeneutical problem away from the nature and limits of computation (which is mostly a matter of methodology) and move it toward consideration of the nature of the discourse in which text analysis bids participation.



But in literary criticism — and here I am thinking of ordinary "paper based" literary criticism — conclusions are evaluated not in terms of what propositions the data allows, but in terms of the nature and depth of the discussions that result. The scientist is right to say that the plural of anecdote is not data, but in literary criticism, an abundance of anecdote is precisely what allows discussion and debate to move forward.


These are provocative results, but the provocation is as much about our sense of what we are doing (the hermeneutical question) as it is about how we are doing it (the methodological question).

If algorithmic criticism is to have a central hermeneutical tenet, it is this: that the narrowing constraints of computational logic — the irreducible tendency of the computer toward enumeration, measurement, and verification — are fully compatible with the goals of criticism set forth above. For while it is possible, and in some cases useful, to confine algorithmic procedures to the scientific realm, such procedures can be made to conform to the methodological project of inventio without transforming the nature of computation or limiting the rhetorical range of critical inquiry. This is possible, because critical reading practices already contain elements of the algorithmic.

Any reading of a text that is not a recapitulation of that text relies on a heuristic of radical transformation. The critic who endeavors to put forth a "reading," puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced. This basic property of critical methodology is evident not only in the act of "close reading," but in the more ambitious project of thematic exegesis. In the classroom, one encounters the exegete instructing his or her students to turn to page 254, and then to page 16, and finally to page 400. They are told to consider just the male characters, or just the female ones, or to pay attention to the adjectives, the rhyme scheme, images of water, or the moment in which Nora Helmer confronts her husband. The interpreter will set a novel against the background of the Jacobite Rebellion, or a play amid the historical location of the theater. He or she will view the text through the lens of Marxism, or psychoanalysis, or existentialism, or postmodernism. In every case, what is being read is not the "original" text, but a text transformed and transduced into an alternative vision, in which, as Wittgenstein put it, we "see an aspect" that further enables discussion and debate.

It is not that such matters as redemptive world views and Marxist readings of texts can be arrived at algorithmically, but simply that algorithmic transformation can provide the alternative visions that give rise to such readings. The computer does this in a particularly useful way by carrying out transformations in a rigidly holistic manner. It is one thing to notice patterns of vocabulary, variations in line length, or images of darkness and light; it is another thing to employ a machine that can unerringly discover every instance of such features across a massive corpus of literary texts and then present those features in a visual format entirely foreign to the original organization in which these features appear. Or rather, it is the same thing at a different scale and with expanded powers of observation. It is in such results that the critic seek not facts, but patterns. And from pattern, the critic may move to the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading.


 Algorithmic criticism would have to retain the commitment to methodological rigor demanded by its tools, but the emphasis would be less on maintaining a correspondence or a fitness between method and goal, and more on the need to present methods in a fully transparent manner. It would not be averse to the idea of reproducibility, but it would perhaps be even more committed to the notion of "hackability." For just as one might undertake a feminist reading of a text by transporting a set of heuristics from one critical context to another, so might the algorithmic critic undertake a particular type of reading by transforming a procedure that has been defined in terms of that most modern text, the computer program.
Algorithmic criticism undoubtedly requires a revolution of sorts, but that revolution is not one of new procedures and methods in contradistinction to the old ones. Algorithmic criticism seeks a new kind of audience for text analysis — one that is less concerned with fitness of method and the determination of interpretive boundaries, and one more concerned with evaluating the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates. Such an audience exists, of course, and has existed for the better part of a century in the general community of literary critics from which text analysis has often found itself exiled. For this reason, text analysis practitioners should view the possibility of such a revolution as both welcome and liberating —not a critique of their methods, but a bold vote of confidence in the possibilities they hold.

            <Title>good stuff on critical frameworks</Title>
            <Text>Critical Frameworks 
In determining my approach, I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, elaborates upon a distinction made by Clifford Geertz between models “of” something and models “for” something (McCarty). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural 

1 After much experimentation, I have opted not to pursue analysis of the words of any actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. It is the nature of my project to rely on the work of my scholarly predecessors, but I did not wish to replicate this emphasis of attention.

ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (McCarty), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (McCarty). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus containing full texts of famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (McCarty); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions. 
Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, the object of study is no longer a model at all, but the thing itself. Tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study— too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence— and so models are always ultimately “fictional” (McCarty). Because these fictions have been created with particular goals in mind—because, McCarty says, “modeling is pragmatic”—he argues that “the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness” (McCarty). Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” provides a metric for evaluating that fruitfulness: “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates” (Ramsay). This seems to be what McCarty implicitly means 
Lawrence Evalyn 4 
when he terms something “fruitful”: whether or not the model has revealed what we expected, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact correspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle” (McCarty), and more of an imagined destination that spurs valuable journeys. As a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. Models need not be perfectly accurate, only sensitive to the desired area of difference. 
McCarty also describes models which are not merely partial in some particular set of details, but which “deliberately” diverge from their source “in order to study the consequences” of the changes. McCarty terms these intentional manipulations “distortion,” but Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call them “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations.2 Whether the final interpreted meaning is “resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable” — whichever framework is used for the method of “reading along thematic lines” — the method itself, they argue, is neither transparent nor the only option (26). Although “criticism... tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity,” both scholarly editions and translations of texts take critical interpretations and write them onto the texts themselves (33). Similarly, “heretical and... 

2 For a recognition of the methodologies of “ordinary ‘paper based’ literary criticism” (Ramsay), I could also have taken Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” as my foundation. Ramsay argues that “[a]ny reading of a text... relies on a heuristic of radical transformation” (Ramsay), noting that “[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a ‘reading,’ puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (Ramsay). However, Ramsay ultimately subordinates his computational experiments to “the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading” (Ramsay). I take Samuels and McGann as my starting-place largely for their willingness to treat their created texts seriously as new and separate objects of interpretation.

nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (35), typically undertaken in service of a particular point, constitute deformation. Placing themselves in this tradition, Samuels and McGann apply several deformative interpretive approaches to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. Each deformation is a procedure for rewriting a poem — reordering its lines from last to first, or deleting all the words but the nouns or the verbs — which spurs a new interpretation of the new version of the text. The key advantage of these deformations is a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study: the procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing” (30) by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. When readers cannot ignore the critic’s act of re-writing, we are implicitly asked to engage again with the author’s earlier act of writing. This defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (36), because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. 
It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to echo McCarty. The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price. In The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel, Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann’s classification of “[e]laborate scholarly editions” (33) as deformative criticism, Price argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. The process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13), and thus gives us a new thing to examine. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts— when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading,

summarize or categorize scenes, chapters, or books— our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Price’s project is more interested in the literal anthologizing undertaken by publishers than in the mental anthologizing implicit in the scholarly act of thinking about several books at once; her ultimate argument is about the works of George Eliot, not about the methodology of literary criticism. Nonetheless, her observations, once anthologized in abridged form alongside digital humanities thinkers, allows us to ‘bare the devices’ of literary criticism itself. 
My own modeling framework is informed by all of these. My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation. My two ‘texts’ – Tracy’s and Frank’s bibliographies – are themselves two very different deformative models of ‘The Gothic Novel,’ and each render different distinctions more or less salient. When forming my research questions, I begin by asking what a given source of information allows me to be sensitive to. Tracy’s motifs emphasize events and singular images, with each detail systematically tallied. In contrast, Frank’s Gothic types emphasize a work’s overall tone, and his evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. The two are thus able to usefully complement each other. As I work with these texts, I dwell upon procedure as a way to meditate upon the implications of earlier critics’ frameworks. Because I must iterate all of my decisions at least 178 times when I decide to include a new axis of distinction in my spreadsheet, much of my ‘research’ has been developing procedures that work with each model, deforming books into spreadsheets and then into images in ways that will render their implicit models explicit and obvious. Rather than visualizing data, then, my goal has been to grasp models. The procedure of graphing each

bibliography amplifies Tracy’s and Frank’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their results accord with our expectations.

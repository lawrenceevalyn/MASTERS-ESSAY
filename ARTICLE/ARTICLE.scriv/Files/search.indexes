            <Title>what about the Garside???</Title>
            <Text>It’s an ASTONISHING bibliography but not at all qualitative
Provides a foundation for future inquiry
Though really I should use it as my backbone for all my othe databases / correlations…
What could the Garside do that would change what I have to say here?
… It might have information on print runs, and on norms in popular literature from which the Gothic diverges :/
But, I am not actually interested who is writing Gothics: I am interested in what those Gothics are about

Batchelor investigates how women thought about their literary labors and how these perceptions evolved over the course of the century. Both books seek to augment traditionally male-centered literary history and to provide new ways of understanding the contribution of gender to the construction of the novel. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017

In the decades during which Smith was writing, Batchelor reminds us, literary careers were being professionalized (as can be seen in debates over copyright and the rise of literary reviews) as well as masculinized. Smith’s response to this cultural shift was to emphasize in her prefaces, footnotes, and semi-autobiographical plots the domestic labor that “both occasioned and impeded her literary career” (91), and to insist upon what hard work it all was.

Batchelor’s careful tracking of the way in which the discourse of literary authorship came to reinforce the social constructions of gender will help us to historicize what we know about women writers, and to reinterpret what they said about their authorial labors.

            <Text>Ordering’ Novels: Describing Prose Fiction, 1770–1832
Peter Garside 
The Oxford Handbook of the Eighteenth-Century Novel 
This essay considers the way in which various types of fiction were projected at their original readers, primarily through the title pages, but also through reviews and circulating-library catalogues. Increasing use was made of ‘Novel’, ‘Romance’, and ‘Tale’ as main descriptors, with Novel gradually gaining prominence in the later eighteenth century, Romance enjoying a moment of popularity round the turn of the century, and Tale or Tales achieving ascendancy by the 1820s. Additional components in titles, such as the Sentimental, Gothic, and Historical, helped communicate different subgeneric types of fiction. Eventually, a three-tiered system stretched from ‘common’ circulating fiction to novels of reputation, the latter signalled by the use of the larger octavo format and through the development of distinct author identities (even when published anonymously). The Magnum Opus collected edition of Scott’s novels made him a classic in his time, finally establishing the novel as a fully established genre. 
p.2: In more recent years an interest in specific fields, notably Gothic and women’s studies, has led to a number of advances being made, albeit in ways which sometimes arguably have the effect of highlighting to the point of exaggeration, while risking further obfuscation of other (often interrelating) modes -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.2: Owing to a major bibliographical breakthrough, it is now possible to cover that territory more fully, over the full timespan in question, and in ways which potentially take us closer to earlier forms of ordering fictional output -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.2: The transcription of details from original title pages among other things allows a much clearer view of the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers: all entries include the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 &lt;— Garside’s model
the novels included … for the years 1770–1832 amount to 3,958 titles

Naming the Form 
p.4: During this period three descriptive labels, ‘Novel’, ‘Romance’, and ‘Tale(s)’ eventually became predominant, as illustrated in Figure 23.1, showing their percentage usage relative to total output of new titles annually. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
#
p.4: In the earlier eighteenth century the term ‘Novel’ appears to have been most commonly applied to shorter works, chiefly of an amatory nature, many of these being translations from French. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 p.4:  None of the ‘classic’ male English fictions of the mid-century appears to have described itself as a Novel in its titles. The term is, however, found in a number of single female domestic fictions between 1720 and 1750 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017  p.4: distinct shift is noticeable in 1769, with five new titles including the term, of which four are two-volume productions -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.4: It is only during the later 1780s, at a time of accelerating production (see Figure 23.2), that ‘Novel’ becomes fully established as a term, with nearly half of new titles in the year 1785 (twenty-three out of forty-seven) featuring it as a main generic denominator, often in alliance with an indication of epistolary content -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.5: The subsequent decline in the use of the term, with just 15 per cent of new works in the 1820s calling themselves novels, is a complex matter, intimately connected with the alternative labels of ‘Romance’ and ‘Tale(s)’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.5:  any practical use of Romance in the titling of new fiction is rare for much of the later eighteenth century, with less than ten new novels featuring the termin their titles between 1770 and 1789, representing barely 1 per cent of output -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017          p.6: The optimum point occurs during the years 1809–11, when nearly 25 per cent of new titles called themselves romances. This, however, was followed by a sharp decline in 1813–15, the time of Walter Scott’s advent as a novelist, leading to a fairly steady petering out thereafter, with ‘Romance’ taking third place behind ‘Novel’ and ‘Tale(s)’ in all but one year to 1832 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.6: The use of the term ‘Tale(s)’ to distinguish both single items and multiple collections was relatively well established by 1770 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.6: The use of ‘Tale(s)’ for substantial single works of fiction becomes more common in the 1780s and 1790s, when at certain high points as many as 20 per cent of new titles described themselves this way. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017    p.6: the label appears to have acted as a magnet for authors wishing to accentuate the un-novel-like natural qualities of their works -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.6: One telling feature of the 1790s is the more frequent use of ‘Tale’ in relation to a growing number of ‘German’ titles (as in ‘A Tale, From the German’), whereas in the case of French counterparts the choice of ‘Novel’ would be more usual -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.7: It is also possible to discern distinct patterns amongst individual authors, indicating a more than arbitrary adoption of the main terms available -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017      p.7: authors and/or their publishers shifting judiciously between the three terms, sometimes as a reflection of length, but also as a means of denoting the nature of content -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017      p.7: It is equally true that generic labels could be bandied around fairly arbitrarily onoccasions. Some titles indicate unwillingness on the part of the author to be tied down byany of them -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.8: circulating library catalogues, where the baggier subheadings used by the longer-established libraries, such as ‘Novels, Romances, Imaginary Histories, Lives, and Adventures’, generally give way to tighter versions, expanding no further than ‘Novels, Tales, and Romances’. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.8: tendency at the end of our period for novels to include no main generic label at all -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.8: the genre no longer needed to engage so much in selfidentification. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

The Growth of Subgenres 
p.8: The development of a number of distinctive subgenres of fiction, notably during the period of high production in the later 1780s and 1790s, helped make titles more crucial than ever in directing readers towards their favourite kind of reading, or in tempting them to try ‘something new’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.8: One of the most durable over the period proved to be ‘Domestic’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: a steady decline in the flow of new fiction offering a picaresque and/or bawdy content. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: One effect of the decline of an older kind of peripatetic narrative, however, was to allow fuller exposure to a species of object-centred ‘It-narratives’, centring on inanimate objects, after the fashion of Charles Johnstone’s Chrysal; or, The Adventures of a Guinea (1760–5) -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 ….. p.9: Combining with a version of the equally long-standing ‘secret history’, in which the follies of society are exposed from the perspective of supposedly ingenuous observer, this mode of writing also comes into view again during the scandalous days of the Regency -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: One of the most potent phrases found in fiction of the later eighteenth century is ‘In A Series of Letters’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.10: a strong conjunction with novels also proclaiming their ‘sentimental’ credentials -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.10: Coexisting with this mode there is the more intense ‘sensibility’ school of fiction, stimulated by translations of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse (1761) and Goethe’s Werther (1774), though numerically this always represented a minority field -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.10: As a whole the optimum period for the production of sentimental novels in English appears to have been between 1787 and 1790, when at least 30 per cent of new titles are categorizable as belonging to this mode. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.10: Although historians of the Gothic have claimed a fairly unbroken genealogy from Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (first issued 1764; subtitled ‘A Gothic Story’ in its second edition of 1765) to late exponents such as Radcliffe and Lewis, the fully-fledged Gothic romance only really coalesced as a recognizable form in the later 1790s, absorbing in the process several characteristics of the sentimental novel. 
p.10:  In terms of density of production the optimum years for the mode were between 1794 and 1807, with at points over a third of new titles exhibiting Gothic characteristics. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.11: A combination of ‘Romance’ with a number of other keywords, including ‘Cavern’, ‘Forest’, and ‘Abbey’, would likewise have pointed to a Gothic novel in the relatively decorous Radcliffeian ‘terror’ tradition.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: In contrast, titles following the ‘horror’ school of M. G. Lewis’s The Monk, characterized by its sadism and voyeurism, tend to be far more aggressive in their nomenclature, with visible ghosts and demons upstaging haunting spirits, brutal robbers outnumbering banditti, and nunneries supplanting convents. Not surprisingly, ‘Monk’ is the most common signifier by far, appearing in a leading position in some fifteen titles, with the greatest concentration between 1802 and 1809. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: In a few instances, titles jumble together Radcliffeian and Lewisian components, as in T. J. Horsley Curties’s The Monk of Udolpho (1807), whose naming (Curties claimed in his foreword) had been largely determined by the priorities of his publisher, J. F. Hughes -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.11: Another noticeable feature of the years leading up the publication of Scott’s Waverley (1814) is the large number of novels claiming to be historical fictions, an aspect of literary (p. 399) output which until recently has been relatively ignored. In fact, in its time, perhaps no other subgenre made a greater effort through titling to make its presence known -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017       p.11: Between 1786 and 1814 some seventy titles can be found describing themselves as Historic(al) Novels, Romances, or Tales -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: Admittedly some of the earlier of these novels can on examination prove to be little more than sentimental or Gothic-type fictions in period costume; while in the early 1810s especially there are instances of the mode being appropriated as a fairly thin veil for contemporary scandalous matter. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.12: Another interesting feature of this mode is its original willingness to appear under all three main generic labels. Between 1800 and 1814, however, ‘Romance’ became by far the main descriptor.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.12: At this point, the historical romance (though largely overwritten by subsequent developments) stood in a much stronger position than both sentimental and Gothic novels, themselves eventually outnumbered even by their parodies, and either absorbed into other modes or, in unmediated form, consigned to the lower ‘trade’ end of the market. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017


‘High’ and ‘Low’ Fiction 
p.13:  Early review notices indicate a fairly pervasive recognition that a golden age of novel-writing had been succeeded with one marked by mediocrity, and not infrequently new novels are viewed as being imitative of past masters such as Richardson while lacking their creative spark. At the same time, there is rarely any indication of the possibility of descent beyond the second-rate -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.13: A distinct shift in this situation, however, becomes noticeable from the later 1780s, following a large surge in production. One fairly immediate sign is a new impatience bordering on intolerance to be found in the established monthly reviews, still committed to commenting, however briefly, on all titles issued by the London trade. Symptomatic of this is a new tendency to figure novels in metaphorically grotesque terms -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017  p.13: three-tier system of grading, with those works picked out for special praise usually being consigned to second-rate status, ahead of the morass of ‘common’ novels -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.13: With the next surge of production in the later 1790s the system of comprehensive reviewing was stretched to breaking point, making the policy of all-inclusion well-nigh untenable -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: the gap between circulating library fiction and more upmarket products was by no means as clear as it would become by the 1820s. William Lane of the Minerva Press, for example, included novels by Godwin and Bage in his earlier lists, and was capable on occasions of producing items similar to those at the higher ‘carriage-trade’ end of the market -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: Another sign of the prominence achieved by authors such as Mackenzie and Burney is the large number of imitations generated in their wake -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: the heady post-Revolutionary ideological climate, which gave fresh purpose to the sentimental novel -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

Histories of the novel:
p.15: Godwin’s Things As They Are (1794), according to its Critical reviewer, ranked ‘greatly above the whole mass of publications which bear the name of novels’, excepting perhaps ‘the productions of Fielding, Smollet [sic], and Burney’.13 The inclusion here of Burney matches a tendency at this stage for more general observers to link different generations of novelists with some degree of equality -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.15: A parallel realignment of the canon is also perceptible in novels such as Robert Bisset’s reactionary Douglas; or, The Highlander (1800), with Fielding granted precedence over Richardson, Burney being separated off from Radcliffe and Smith, and Godwin and his circle excoriated out of existence in the most violent of personal attacks. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.15: The early 1800s show the reputation of fiction at one of its lowest points. At the same time, as a form of popular reading matter the genre by now was palpably unstoppable, with an optimum peak of 111 new titles being reached in 1808 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.15: The idea that fiction had reached an absolute nadir, demanding radical reformation, can be found in a number of key texts at this point. One major intervention came in the form of Hannah More’s evangelical Cœlebs in Search of a Wife (1808) -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.15: Scott skims a thin layer of ‘insipid’ sentimental fictions, before biting on the new scurrility: ‘we have now the lowest denizens of Grub-street narrating, under the flimsy veil of false names, and through the medium of a fictitious tale, all that malevolence can invent (p. 403) and stupidity propagate’. Delving further, he confronts a number of formulaic imitations of Radcliffe and Lewis, amidst which the Fatal Revenge stands out as the product of a gifted, if misdirected, writer.16 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.16: The introductory sequence, mockingly speculating possible subtitles, parallels the Maturin review in proceeding through the Radcliffeian Gothic (‘a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing has been long uninhabited’), a more Lewisian ‘Romance from the German’, a ‘Sentimental Tale’ (‘sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp’), and a ‘A Tale of the Times’ ( ‘a dashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled’).18 Eschewing such possibilities, Scott then settles on a tale of men and manners, set just within living memory, adopting at first a narrative tone strongly reminiscent of Fielding -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.17: In bearing the lead title of Waverley Novels on its spine labels and title pages this employed the same mantle descriptive term as the main body of post-1774 collected sets of ‘classic’ fiction -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.17: As such it offered infallible proof that the genre, collectively known as the novel, had now in its contemporary form come to full fruition. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017</Text>

            <Title>footnote for pie charts</Title>
            <Text>The graphic design decisions underlying my graphs are procedurally generated. The goal is for the visual presentation of each chart to qualitatively indicate relationships, and thus make them a fruitful body for interpretive readings. I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually represent Tracy’s treatment of each motif as a self-contained field which may or may not have distinct divisions within it. The size of each circle reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two shades of gray in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages. I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose stark contrast nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif itself is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps, its chart doesn’t show two camps. All these design choices further emphasize my model’s sensitivity to each motif’s gendered use. Each chart is able to immediately provide an answer to the question, “does knowing that this motif appears in a book tell me anything about the likely gender of that book’s author?” </Text>

            <Title>Female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who are using them.] Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a new Female Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, [whose] ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. However, [four is a small number, and unlike the wide-ranging male motifs which were well over the 60% line, it would only take a very few writers — or one domestic Ann Radcliffe — to produce these results]. The paucity of female motifs suggests that [seeing/defining a genre here] may be too hasty: this Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the [Shared??] Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.</Text>

            <Text>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. [This is basically mathematically inevitable, and points to the impossibility of a genre being one genre with two non-overlapping schools.] In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [Include percentage of total novels per motif.] Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows a gendered divide.</Text>

            <Title>lit review: female gothic</Title>
            <Text>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”, to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”. Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [social] relationships to intertextual ones, as exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”. These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go back to the social reality of gender.]</Text>

            <Title>no binaries</Title>
            <Text>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel]. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>Abstract feedback from Alyssa</Title>
            <Text>Hello from Detroit!

That's so exciting about the chapbook! It throws a wrench in the works, but having two plagiarized works to draw on could bring out some really interesting new conclusions (or significantly strengthen the existing ones).

1. The most important idea was that men and women don't write substantially different gothic texts.

2. Each individual sentence is very clear. They feel a little disjointed, but once I read through the abstract the whole picture fell into place. The only place where I could use a little more context is the last sentence. That's in part because I'm missing some of the vocabulary and background knowledge, and in part because I'm not sure how your analysis connects to that conclusion. It sounds like an idea with some sweeping implications, so it might deserve a little more context. 

3. I think you could maybe trim down a little here: 

"This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers."

To

"This paper examines hundreds of popular Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers."

26 to 21 words--not a huge difference, but it might give you some room elsewhere. That change depends on whether the goal of "hundreds" in the original sentence was to indicate the overall size of your sample or the large number of female gothic writers in the eighteenth century... my version would cover the former, but is less effective at communicating the latter.

Let me know how it goes! I love being a part of your process with these things.

            <Title>the sentimental &amp; the Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Sentimental
One of the most potent phrases found in fiction of the later eighteenth century is ‘In A Series of Letters’ … a strong conjunction with novels also proclaiming their ‘sentimental’ credentials
Coexisting with this mode there is the more intense ‘sensibility’ school of fiction, stimulated by translations of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse (1761) and Goethe’s Werther (1774), though numerically this always represented a minority field
As a whole the optimum period for the production of sentimental novels in English appears to have been between 1787 and 1790, when at least 30 per cent of new titles are categorizable as belonging to this mode.
the heady post-Revolutionary ideological climate, which gave fresh purpose to the sentimental novel

Gothic
Although historians of the Gothic have claimed a fairly unbroken genealogy from Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (first issued 1764; subtitled ‘A Gothic Story’ in its second edition of 1765) to late exponents such as Radcliffe and Lewis, the fully-fledged Gothic romance only really coalesced as a recognizable form in the later 1790s, absorbing in the process several characteristics of the sentimental novel.
In terms of density of production the optimum years for the mode were between 1794 and 1807, with at points over a third of new titles exhibiting Gothic characteristics.
A combination of ‘Romance’ with a number of other keywords, including ‘Cavern’, ‘Forest’, and ‘Abbey’, would likewise have pointed to a Gothic novel in the relatively decorous Radcliffeian ‘terror’ tradition.
In contrast, titles following the ‘horror’ school of M. G. Lewis’s The Monk, characterized by its sadism and voyeurism, tend to be far more aggressive in their nomenclature, with visible ghosts and demons upstaging haunting spirits, brutal robbers outnumbering banditti, and nunneries supplanting convents. Not surprisingly, ‘Monk’ is the most common signifier by far, appearing in a leading position in some fifteen titles, with the greatest concentration between 1802 and 1809.
In a few instances, titles jumble together Radcliffeian and Lewisian components, as in T. J. Horsley Curties’s The Monk of Udolpho (1807), whose naming (Curties claimed in his foreword) had been largely determined by the priorities of his publisher, J. F. Hughes

Historical
Another noticeable feature of the years leading up the publication of Scott’s Waverley (1814) is the large number of novels claiming to be historical fictions, an aspect of literary (p. 399) output which until recently has been relatively ignored.
Admittedly some of the earlier of these novels can on examination prove to be little more than sentimental or Gothic-type fictions in period costume; while in the early 1810s especially there are instances of the mode being appropriated as a fairly thin veil for contemporary scandalous matter.
At this point, the historical romance (though largely overwritten by subsequent developments) stood in a much stronger position than both sentimental and Gothic novels, themselves eventually outnumbered even by their parodies, and either absorbed into other modes or, in unmediated form, consigned to the lower ‘trade’ end of the market.</Text>

            <Text>The editors invite contributions on all aspects of the eighteenth century. Essays employing interdisciplinary perspectives or addressing contemporary theoretical and cultural concerns relating to the eighteenth century are especially encouraged. Articles which are selected for publication are those which make a significant and original contribution to their field. The editors also invite submission of previously unpublished or little-known primary sources, with translation or commentary.
Article submissions are first screened for their appropriateness for the journal. Articles which are considered for publication are sent to two reviewers: one reviewer, generally drawn from the author’s home discipline, serves as a specialist in the subject matter at hand while the other, generally drawn from a second discipline, approaches the article from a broader thematic perspective. Based on these initial reviewers’ reports, the article is either rejected, returned for revisions, or passed on to the editorial board for another level of review.  Once in the hands of the editorial board, each article is read by at least one additional reviewer. These editorial board reviewers make publishing recommendations to the editor, who makes the final decision regarding publication.
Manuscripts should not exceed 7,500 words, including notes. Style must conform to The Chicago Manual of Style 16th edition, with endnotes. Quotations from foreign texts should appear in the body of the essay followed by translations. Please supply an abstract of 100 or fewer words with your paper. Illustrations are accepted if pertinent to the essay (authors must secure glossy prints or digital files and reproduction rights if the essay is accepted).

            <Title>2000 Garside The English Novel, 1770–1829: A Bibliographical Survey</Title>
            <Text>The English Novel, 1770–1829: A Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fic- tion Published in the British Isles. General editors, Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schöwerling. Volume 1: 1770–1799. Edited by James Raven and Antonia Forster, with the assistance of Stephen Bending. Vol- ume 2: 1800–1829. Edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Schöwerling, with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin Wünsche. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. xix+864; xiv+753. 
The entries are richly detailed. In addition to author, title, and pub- lishing information, they give a novel’s number of volumes, pagina- tion, format, and price; and they provide references to contemporary reviews, to the libraries holding copies, and to any short-title catalog number. The copy examined by the bibliographers is specified along with its shelf-list number. The list of libraries is valuable for future his- torians, since most titles have few extant first-edition copies. The notes include information about dedicatees, issue variations, subscription lists, included advertisements, subsequent editions, translations, and attributions. The first volume has fuller notes, with extracts of reviews from the Monthly Review and the Critical Review. 
As one would expect, titles with no known first-edition copy occur more frequently in the first volume. Nevertheless, fully 90 percent of its 1,421 titles have survived, while in the second volume over 98 percent of its 2,256 titles have. 
Moreover, of the hundred titles in the second volume that are known to survive only in a copy from the remarkable Schloss Corvey Library, a mere five were not listed in the English Catalogue of Books or not noticed in the reviews. This suggests the bibliographers have drawn their net very tightly in applying their finding methods to the short-title catalogs and that only a handful of novel titles are likely to have eluded them.

            <Text>Dear Mr. Evalyn,

Thank you for your enquiry.  It generally takes about a week, sometimes less, for initial review, when the editor and I read a submission and decide whether to send it out for review.  We don’t currently have any CFPs out for special issues.  We do indeed accept illustrations; unfortunately, we don’t currently print in color.  You might look at Michael Gavin’s recent article in 50.1, “Historical Text Networks.”  He was able to create enough difference in grayscale to make the distinctions clear on his graphs.  We have some flexibility in terms of number of figures; we’d prefer not to exceed around 10, but that isn’t a hard-and-fast number.  Please let me know if I can answer any further questions, and thank you once again for your interest in ECS.

Sincerely,

            <Title>histories of the novel</Title>
            <Text>Histories of the eighteenth-century British novel have nearly always sought to explain how and why the novel transformed itself over the course of the century, and, as a result, these histories nearly always end up offering a teleological and selective account. This collection employs several strategies to avoid such a problem
/
Despite the numbers of novelists to which it directs new attention, this history often tacitly perpetuates existing hierarchies of value, rather than defining these or challenging them on the behalf of the works it reclaims. 
While it is possible that a subsequent history of the novel might differentiate itself from this one by taking an explicitly aesthetic turn, it is also possible that the approaches pursued so rewardingly in this volume might be taken further with digital technologies.
Clifford Siskin argues for seeing the history of the novel in the eighteenth century as a complex process of emergence rather than a triumphal rise. 
 Suggesting “emergence” as a more useful term than “rise” to describe the genre’s history, especially in the context of scholarship that highlights new data and a multitude of texts, Siskin brings in the idea of “novelism” from his earlier work to argue that it was this novelism— discourse of and about the novel—that ultimately generated the idea of Literature.
In this book, the history of the novel looks rather like a Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting, packed with individuals, some in the foreground and some in the background, but all presented with great detail and all, in their di erent actions, contributing to the overall e ect of the image. And it is full of life and activity.  This feels right: the history of the novel is not a uni ed narrative, but precisely the kind of diversi ed picture presented in OHNE.

“Major Authors and Traditions” section gathers fourteen essays, with ten focusing on subgenres.  The remaining four essays are devoted to the authors that the editors consider major in this period: Smollett, Laurence Sterne, Jane Austen, and Scott. 

Godwin’s Things As They Are (1794), according to its Critical reviewer, ranked ‘greatly above the whole mass of publications which bear the name of novels’, excepting perhaps ‘the productions of Fielding, Smollet [sic], and Burney’.13 The inclusion here of Burney matches a tendency at this stage for more general observers to link different generations of novelists with some degree of equality

A parallel realignment of the canon is also perceptible in novels such as Robert Bisset’s reactionary Douglas; or, The Highlander (1800), with Fielding granted precedence over Richardson, Burney being separated off from Radcliffe and Smith, and Godwin and his circle excoriated out of existence in the most violent of personal attacks.

Scott skims a thin layer of ‘insipid’ sentimental fictions, before biting on the new scurrility: ‘we have now the lowest denizens of Grub-street narrating, under the flimsy veil of false names, and through the medium of a fictitious tale, all that malevolence can invent (p. 403) and stupidity propagate’. Delving further, he confronts a number of formulaic imitations of Radcliffe and Lewis, amidst which the Fatal Revenge stands out as the product of a gifted, if misdirected, writer.
The introductory sequence, mockingly speculating possible subtitles, parallels the Maturin review in proceeding through the Radcliffeian Gothic (‘a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing has been long uninhabited’), a more Lewisian ‘Romance from the German’, a ‘Sentimental Tale’ (‘sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp’), and a ‘A Tale of the Times’ ( ‘a dashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled’).18 Eschewing such possibilities, Scott then settles on a tale of men and manners, set just within living memory, adopting at first a narrative tone strongly reminiscent of Fielding

How much rewriting of the novel’s literary history lies ahead is suggested by a comparison of James Raven’s table of the sixty-seven novels published from 1770 to 1799 that went to five editions or more by 1829 with Gary Kelly’s English Fiction of the Romantic Period, 1789–1830 (London: Longman, 1989). Thirty-nine of those very popular novels first appeared in the overlapping years from 1789 to 1799, but Kelly mentions only twenty of them.
Novels accounted for at most 8 percent of all books published and were a niche business dominated by publishers like William Lane of Minerva Press fame and Henry Colburn of silver-fork-novel renown.
Lane's rise to pre-eminence coincides with a large upsurge in titles in the late 1780s, and the Minerva's dominance in this respect continued almost unabated until the 1820s. In all but three years (1807, 1808, and 1818) Lane and/or Newman were responsible for at least 25% of new titles — and on two occasions, in 1795 and 1801, Lane actually claimed more than half of the annual total. Colburn's contribution begins with a trickle in 1806, and develops only slightly in numerical terms until the floodgates open after the financial crisis of 1825/26. From then to the end of the decade Colburn effectively replaced the Minerva by publishing at least 25% of new titles, culminating with exactly half (thirty-four out of sixty-eight) in 1829. Other publishers — for example, Hookham in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, or Longmans early in the nineteenth —took a clear stake in fiction, but only one can be said to have dominated in a way comparable to Lane and Colburn. From 1807-08 J. F. Hughes of Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, claimed his own quarter share of titles, outstripping in both years the Minerva Press, which was experiencing something of an ebb in its fortunes during the transfer of control from Lane to Newman.
In Hughes's output it is possible to trace an accelerating movement, sometimes involving the same authors, from sentimental and Radcliffian pot-boilers, though anglicized schauerroman and Monk-like horror, to 'fashionable' anecdote and scandal. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that Gothic and sentimental novels continued as mainstays of his production to the end. Of sixty-four titles examined at first hand, the majority fall in almost equal proportions into the broad categories of sentimental, Gothic, and scandal fiction. The list is completed by a smattering of 'historical' novels (though the distinction between these and the Gothic and/or sentimental is sometimes blurred), and two late pseudo-Irish works.

            <Title>what I do</Title>
            <Text>Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]</Text>

The decades under consideration saw the consolidation of the 'classic' fiction of Richardson, Fielding and Smollett, the publication of Sterne's Tristram Shandy, an array of secondary 'adventure' and 'spy' narratives, and the emergence of a distinctly female 'circulating library' novel. Castmg his widest net Raven manages to trawl almost 1,400 items of fiction, as opposed to the 391 and 338 items listed in McBurney and Beasley respectively. Different methods of selection and arrangement make direct comparison difficult, but Raven's book has definitely widened the scope of novel searching in a number of significant ways 
p.2: Raven notes the presence of subscription lists — a surprisingly small count of nineteen  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
Raven also follows McBurney and Beasley in adopting a catholic view of what constitutes fiction in the period: a position matched by recent cntical studies which have stressed the pliability of the new-found genre. Critics are free to theorize, but bibliographers in Raven's position must propose some broad principles of selection and, in individual cases, bite the bullet of whether or not to include.  … Nearly three hundred titles (court memoirs, fables, voyages, political satires, essays, moral tales, but not chapbooks) are included under this heading [of ‘miscellany’]
Unlike McBurney, Raven itemizes in-period reprints of works originally published before his starting-point of 1750 — most strikingly, seventeen non- chapbook versions of RobinsonCrusoe — as well as similarly listing separately subsequent editions of new works first published in his own period to 1770. On this basis, the main listings feature more than two hundred Irish reprints. The principle of separate entries is even extended to works which appeared by volume in stages. 
p.3:  Raven's categorization of items according to narrative type (collection of tales (C), epistolary (E), miscellaneous (M), narrative novel (N) -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
This highlights the continuing success of Smollett's first original work of fiction (on an edition count, Roderick Random was the fourth most popular novel in the century) and provides one of many pointers to the importance of reprinting to the contemporary trade ('classic' works by the four main male novelists account for almost seven per cent of fiction titles published in 1750-70) 
ome forgotten successes are unearthed. Charles Johnston's Chrysal; or, the Adventures of a Guinea (1760), the most prominent of a bevy of'spy' adventures, is itemized on no less than thirteen occasions, indicating a sizeable Johnston industry in the 1760s; Robert Goadby's Apologyfor the Life ofMr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew, originally published in 1745, appears no less than eight times in the checklist's 'Miscellanies' section, a ubiquitousness which is reflected in surviving circulating Library catalogues (where, by the way, it is invariably placed under 'Novels and Romances'). Also brought into view is the vogue enjoyed by certain 'elegant' feminine fictions in the 1760s. notably Mrs Frances Brooke's History ofLadyJulia Mandeville (1763; no. 769), with two new London editions and a Dublin reprinting in the year of publication, and Mrs Frances Sheridan'sMemoirsofMissSidneyBidulph(1761;no 670),whichwasevidentlygiven a new lease of life with the publication of its Conclusion along with a third edition and the same author's History ofNourjahad in 1767 (nos. 1134-38).

Overall the checklist enumerates to 1,363, to which must be added ten or so items with a suffix 'a'. By excluding 'miscellanies', Raven then narrows to a more stable base of 1,077 works of fiction. Within that reduced total there is a yet smaller group of 531 new novels 
Notwithstanding the multifariousness of publishers handling fiction, it seemed odd that the highest market share achieved by any one house in each decade was 5.4 per cent (the Nobles in the 1750s). Perhaps the root cause lies in the disparate nature of the works itemized. Take, for instance, the year 1750. From twenty-two 'new' London titles listed, only ten are of full (or multi-) volume size, out of which only three can be counted as original English works with 1750 on the imprint — two of which were published by the eminently recognizable firms of Mary Cooper and Andrew Millar! 
p.5: One solution to the problems posed might be to return to McBurney's original agenda, itemizing only full-length novels by English authors and translators at the date of first publication. As he argued, selectivity by onginahty and size at least offers the compensation 'of indicating more clearly fictional trends and the degree of onginal impetus during the period -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017</Text>

Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] </Text>

In this book, the history of the novel looks rather like a Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting, packed with individuals, some in the foreground and some in the background, but all presented with great detail and all, in their di erent actions, contributing to the overall e ect of the image.

            <Text>Critical Frameworks 
In determining my approach, I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, elaborates upon a distinction made by Clifford Geertz between models “of” something and models “for” something (McCarty). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural 

1 After much experimentation, I have opted not to pursue analysis of the words of any actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. It is the nature of my project to rely on the work of my scholarly predecessors, but I did not wish to replicate this emphasis of attention.

ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (McCarty), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (McCarty). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus containing full texts of famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (McCarty); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions. 
Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, the object of study is no longer a model at all, but the thing itself. Tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study— too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence— and so models are always ultimately “fictional” (McCarty). Because these fictions have been created with particular goals in mind—because, McCarty says, “modeling is pragmatic”—he argues that “the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness” (McCarty). Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” provides a metric for evaluating that fruitfulness: “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates” (Ramsay). This seems to be what McCarty implicitly means 
Lawrence Evalyn 4 
when he terms something “fruitful”: whether or not the model has revealed what we expected, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact correspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle” (McCarty), and more of an imagined destination that spurs valuable journeys. As a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. Models need not be perfectly accurate, only sensitive to the desired area of difference. 
McCarty also describes models which are not merely partial in some particular set of details, but which “deliberately” diverge from their source “in order to study the consequences” of the changes. McCarty terms these intentional manipulations “distortion,” but Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call them “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations.2 Whether the final interpreted meaning is “resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable” — whichever framework is used for the method of “reading along thematic lines” — the method itself, they argue, is neither transparent nor the only option (26). Although “criticism... tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity,” both scholarly editions and translations of texts take critical interpretations and write them onto the texts themselves (33). Similarly, “heretical and... 

2 For a recognition of the methodologies of “ordinary ‘paper based’ literary criticism” (Ramsay), I could also have taken Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” as my foundation. Ramsay argues that “[a]ny reading of a text... relies on a heuristic of radical transformation” (Ramsay), noting that “[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a ‘reading,’ puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (Ramsay). However, Ramsay ultimately subordinates his computational experiments to “the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading” (Ramsay). I take Samuels and McGann as my starting-place largely for their willingness to treat their created texts seriously as new and separate objects of interpretation.

nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (35), typically undertaken in service of a particular point, constitute deformation. Placing themselves in this tradition, Samuels and McGann apply several deformative interpretive approaches to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. Each deformation is a procedure for rewriting a poem — reordering its lines from last to first, or deleting all the words but the nouns or the verbs — which spurs a new interpretation of the new version of the text. The key advantage of these deformations is a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study: the procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing” (30) by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. When readers cannot ignore the critic’s act of re-writing, we are implicitly asked to engage again with the author’s earlier act of writing. This defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (36), because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. 
It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to echo McCarty. The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price. In The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel, Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann’s classification of “[e]laborate scholarly editions” (33) as deformative criticism, Price argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. The process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13), and thus gives us a new thing to examine. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts— when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, 
Lawrence Evalyn 6 
summarize or categorize scenes, chapters, or books— our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Price’s project is more interested in the literal anthologizing undertaken by publishers than in the mental anthologizing implicit in the scholarly act of thinking about several books at once; her ultimate argument is about the works of George Eliot, not about the methodology of literary criticism. Nonetheless, her observations, once anthologized in abridged form alongside digital humanities thinkers, allows us to ‘bare the devices’ of literary criticism itself. 
My own modeling framework is informed by all of these. My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation. My two ‘texts’ – Tracy’s and Frank’s bibliographies – are themselves two very different deformative models of ‘The Gothic Novel,’ and each render different distinctions more or less salient. When forming my research questions, I begin by asking what a given source of information allows me to be sensitive to. Tracy’s motifs emphasize events and singular images, with each detail systematically tallied. In contrast, Frank’s Gothic types emphasize a work’s overall tone, and his evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. The two are thus able to usefully complement each other. As I work with these texts, I dwell upon procedure as a way to meditate upon the implications of earlier critics’ frameworks. Because I must iterate all of my decisions at least 178 times when I decide to include a new axis of distinction in my spreadsheet, much of my ‘research’ has been developing procedures that work with each model, deforming books into spreadsheets and then into images in ways that will render their implicit models explicit and obvious. Rather than visualizing data, then, my goal has been to grasp models. The procedure of graphing each

bibliography amplifies Tracy’s and Frank’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their results accord with our expectations.

            <Title>2005 Garside J. F. Hughes and the Publication of Popular Fiction, 1803-1810</Title>
            <Text>THE HISTORY OF POPULAR FICTION in the Romantic period is often associated with the careers of two entrepreneur-publishers, William Lane and Henry Colburn. The prolific output of novels by Lane, and his successor A. K. Newman, is described in considerable detail in Dorothy Blakey's The Minerva Press, 1790-1820 (London, 1939). Colburn's promin- ence as a publisher of fashionable novels in the 1820s has also been sketched out in Matthew Whiting Rosa's The Silver-Fork School (New York, 1936)
With issues of this kind in mind, in the last few years I have been constructing a comprehensive file of novels published between 1780 and 1830: employing sources contemporary with the period—circulating library catalogues, William Bent's London Catalogue, listings in reviews — alongside more modern library catalogues and bibliographical compilations. The result is a collection of almost three thousand original titles (reprints, miscellanies, and shorter tales are generally excluded), with in most instances a note of the publisherofthefirstedition. 
Notunexpectedly,theresultsservetoconfirm several presuppositions about the Minerva Press and Colburn 
 Lane's rise to pre-eminence coincides with a large upsurge in titles in the late 1780s, and the Minerva's dominance in this respect continued almost unabated until the 1820s. In all but three years (1807, 1808, and 1818) Lane and/or Newman were responsible for at least 25% of new titles — and on two occasions, in 1795 and 1801, Lane actually claimed more than half of the annual total. Colburn's contribution begins with a trickle in 1806, and develops only slightly in numerical terms until the floodgates open after the financial crisis of 1825/26. From then to the end of the decade Colburn effectively replaced the Minerva by publishing at least 25% of new titles, culminating with exactly half (thirty-four out of sixty-eight) in 1829. Other publishers — for example, Hookham in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, or Longmans early in the nineteenth —took a clear stake in fiction, but only one can be said to have dominated in a way comparable to Lane and Colburn. From 1807-08 J. F. Hughes of Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, claimed his own quarter share of titles, outstripping in both years the Minerva Press, which was experiencing something of an ebb in its fortunes during the transfer of control from Lane to Newman.
If a handful of titles on the border between fiction and scandalous memoir are included, the number so far noted of novels published by Hughes, … totals exactly one hundred 
p.17: The tide of taste, likewise, was beginning to turn. Hannah More's Coelebs in Search ofa Wife (1808), which had reached twelve editions by the end of 1809, signalled the start of an evangelical assault on 'fashionable' life and literature. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.19: In Hughes's output it is possible to trace an accelerating movement, sometimes involving the same authors, from sentimental and Radcliffian pot-boilers, though anglicized schauerroman and Monk-like horror, to 'fashionable' anecdote and scandal. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that Gothic and sentimental novels continued as mainstays of his production to the end. Of sixty-four titles examined at first hand, the majority fall in almost equal proportions into the broad categories of sentimental, Gothic, and scandal fiction. The list is completed by a smattering of 'historical' novels (though the distinction between these and the Gothic and/or sentimental is sometimes blurred), and two late pseudo-Irish works. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

She says, “The reviewer must surey be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” McIntyre draws a tentative connection based on “the ethical purpose of the book,” which in Inchbald is “rather too obvious for successful art,” but decides that although Radcliffe’s writing, “it is true, was strictly moral,” Radcliffe’s “main interest” does not lie in moralizing. McIntyre has thus identified what I argue is the key connection between the two works, but overlooks its significance: moral sentiment, and its connection to the emotional experience of the reader, is the throughline which connects the Gothic deeply to its non-Gothic literary context, and to the broader intellectual debates at the end of the Englightenment.</Text>

            <Title>Baker: sentimental -&gt; Gothic</Title>
            <Text>I thus return to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, [tells this kind of history in his YEAR work TITLE:
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbés novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance through its course. It was all derivative of the cult of emotion…
In this history of the Gothic, German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre:
Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appettites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors[.]
The Gothic is well-established before the first hints of “German folk-lore”, which only arrives “later on” and only in the works of “those who had become acquainted” with it. Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of the central emotional experience of fear. Baker’s historical model is not sensitive to the features of the Gothic which now draw attention — he does not make his distinctions based on politics or aesthetics or gender — instead, he defines the Gothic by its emotional manipulations.</Text>

            <Title>the teleological model</Title>
            <Text>Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. [Nonetheless, he writes on the basis of a model of the genre’s history / what’s important about it] The assumptions of his model, however, remain implicit in the moralizing judgments throughout his work. Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness,” for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful. J.M.S. Tompkins, too, dismisses the Gothic on the basis of these kinds of assumptions: with the rise of the Gothic, she says, “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probability, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern.” [We often talk about the “magic lantern” of the Gothic in positive terms, but Tompkins clearly sees this “slip[ping] farther away” as a problem.] Both Baker and Tompkins model the novel itsels as a training-ground for the mind, through which habits of thought are established, and which therefore ought to inculcate the “right” mode of thought. Accordingly, both model the Gothic as a dangerously emotional and disordered mode of thought, notable not for its plots or sets or even which emotions are induced, but defined entirely by the emotionally overpowering nature of the reading experience.</Text>

            <Title>reject teleology, keep emotion</Title>
            <Text>I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: [its understanding of the Gothic as continuous, rather than a break]. [The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as] as spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by “intensification,” and not in terms of fundamental type. Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, “the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-tellers stock in trade.”  [The “fantastic” elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it.] We can reject their realist teleology without rejecting their sensitivity to emotional response. Doing so allows us to better place the Gothic in context with other eighteenth century works, such that the Gothic participates directly in Englightenment conversations about human nature and rationality.</Text>

            <Text>The novel of sentiment:
“Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox, both brought up in the school of Richardson, yielded eventually to the taste for something less humdrum than domestic realism, and at the same time, far from renouncing or abating their fits of emotional indulgence and their pervading sentimentality, screwed up the tension, and dragged their lovers and heroines through stranger trials and more sensational adventures than could be counted among ordinary contingencies.” (Baker 91)
“Richardson had founded the English novel of sensibility; but, after all, sensibility was ot an object with Richardson, who wrote to inculcate prudence and self-control. … But sensibility soon became an object of engrossing interest and an end in itself” (Baker 95)

“That amoral person Sterne cared nothing for edification… He fondled his sensibility, he never tired of playing with it; he was a debauched sentimentalist, aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95 Baker)

“It would be inexact to say that the influence of Richardson was waning towards the end of the seventeen-sixties; if his novels were tending to go out of favour and to be superseded by new kinds of sentimental fiction, it was simply that he had established a cult and his devotees had gone beyong him.” (Baker 96) - Sterne and Mackenzie as prime examples
“It was the French Richardsonians, pursuing a trend already observable in their own literature, who first outwent their acknowledged leader.” (Baker 97)

“Some signs of the romantic scene-painting soon to be a marked characteristic of Gothic fiction are observable in Julia de Roubigné, and may reasonably be credited to the example of Prévost, who loved to set the stage gloomily for the experiences of his ill-starred lovers.” (Baker 110) “sensitivity to the sombre and dearful, which was presently to reach a fever-pitch in Charlotte Smith and Mrs Radcliffe” (Baker 110)

“moral improvement was decidedly the chief end that he [i.e., Mackenzie] envisaged in estimating the value of fiction; in other words, he takes exactly the same view as Dr Johnson and most other critics of that day” (Baker 112)
but Mackenzie doesn’t consider himself a sentimental novelist?

Henry Brooke more sentimental than Mackenzie — “Brook’s hero and his friends burst into tears alike in sympathy with grief and at any example of human affection or of nobility of soul.” (Baker 115)

novel of sensibility is mostly a more intense novel of sentiment (Baker 120). At first, “Sensibility accepted the rule of reason” (Baker 121), but over time “though fiction came by various stages nearer to life,” “In the later romances… sensibility was forced like a hot-house plant, and grew more and more artificial, affected, pretentious” (121).

“The novels of Prévost contain all the materials for the novel of sensibility. They also have in them a good part of the material that was son to be utilized in what came to be nicknamed the Gothic novel.” (Baker 130) primarily “his gloomy scene-painting”
“Prévost was less than half a realist, and much more than half a romancer” (Baker 131) …a variety of French authors who build on &amp; exaggerate Prévost

“The most distinguished English novel in line of descent from Richardson, which shows unmistakable traces of some infusion of blood from… Prévost… is that novel by Mrs Frances Sheridan, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph… (1761)” (Baker 141)

The History of the English Novel, Volume V: The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance

Enormous interlude on Fanny Burney, who “provides an interlude of natural comedy in the long monotone of solemn and pretentious sentimentalism” (154)

“Mystery and Wonder, Fear and Suspense, Sensation and Terror, are some of the labels affixed by different historians to the romantic novels that traded in one or another, or in all of these excitements, during the last few decades of the eighteenth century. The rather absurd term ‘Gothic’ is perhaps more convenient, and may be allowed to include both those than contented themselves with a discreet use of fear and suspense, and also those which sought the grosser sensations of terror and brutally aimed to make the flesh creep.” (Baker 175)
“It was a term applied first in derision… Then it was amiably accepted by Walpole and others, who confessed a fondness for what they called Gothic, little as they understood the real nature of what they admired, and grotesque as were their attempts to imitate it.”

“The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (Baker 175)
“Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.” (Baker 176)</Text>

Although she is, indeed, a pioneer in both these fields, it has seemed to me that, after all, her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure.” (McIntyre 77)
“Mrs. Radcliffe’s method is founded upon the principle // which Walpole tried with imperfect success to embody in his work — the principle of suspence” (79-80)
Radcliffe’s peers are “Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mrs. Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith” (93)
“One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: ‘This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s /Simple Story/.’ The expression, ‘this kind,’ is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” (McIntyre 94) “…the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art.

	This book’s central task is the reframing of the text-genre relationship, arguing that texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2). Genres function by “mediat[ing] between a social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, “and the text which realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Frow concludes that “what we learn, in ‘doing’ genre (in performing and transforming it) is the values we share or don’t share with others and the means with which to challenge or defend them” (144).</Text>

	This book, perhaps the first to pay serious scholarly attention to the wide reach of the Gothic, puts forth “a set of descriptions which will both help to identify the historical Gothic while suggesting reasons for its survival and for the multifarious forms in which it has survived” (20-21). Examining works from the birth of the Gothic to his present day, Punter identifies the unifying element of the Gothic as fear, expressed through a “dialectic of comfort and disturbance” and “a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423). In his final proposal of “a theory of the Gothic,” he argues that “Gothic fiction becomes a process of cultural self-analysis, and the images which it throws up become the dream-figures of a troubled social group.” with “the glance over the shoulder”—a nostalgic attempt to understand the past—as the inherent function of the ghost-story. The Gothic, “at the psychological interface between the well-ordered psyche and its rebel subjects,” may not provide an escape, but can provide “refuge while at the same time undermining the architectural fabric” of the bourgeois ideology which attempts to “naturalise” the unstable situation of society (425-6).

            <Title>Price</Title>
            <Text>Building toward a reading of the writing style of George Eliot, this book examines in detail the historical conditions of the rise of the anthology and its relationship to the seemingly un-anthologizable novel. Of particular interest is her detailed investigation of the many reworkings of Clarissa published alongside that text, from tables-of-contents meant to help readers ‘catch up’ to a current volume to editions consisting only of the Bible verses Clarissa reads. Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. She concludes with an argument that the works of George Eliot are written intentionally to anticipate their anthologies.

These changes are in keeping with Leah Price’s argument that editing a text does not simply produce a deformed version of the original, but rather produces a new text. Price takes Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa as the prime example of a novel surrounded by re-edited versions of itself; as she notes, each new abridgement reveals its editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13). In the years after Clarissa’s completion, alternate versions proliferated, each rewriting Richardson’s text to suit a new niche: abridgements in which the epistolary format has been replaced with an impersonal retrospective narrator (15); collections of “moral sentiments” excerpted and arranged alphabetically (17); an anthology of the Bible verses mentioned, but not quoted, in the novel, intermingled with both excerpts and summaries (24). Even the index of chapters, originally prefixed to the second edition “in the expectation that readers would have forgotten the beginning by the time they reached the end” (13), circulated as an independent pamphlet that could not just supplement the full text, but potentially replace it (17). Most importantly, several of these rewritings were carried out by Richardson himself; as the author of the original, he would have no need to identically replicate his own approach, but must have arranged each new editions with a different slant.
Richardson’s case establishes the general principle; when Price turns her attention to Radcliffe, she sees Radcliffe’s works as primarily interesting for their intermingling of prose with poetry. Radcliffe’s “beauties” (92), she argues, play the same role as do Richardson’s sentiments: readers may attempt to race through the book “wth. a View only to Story” (Richardson, qtd. in Price 21), but the structure of the book itself will discipline them.  Price’s description of Clarissa seems equally apt for the works of both authors: “the sententious passages which pepper the novel itself are designed less (through their content) to inculcate specific moral lessons than (through their structure) to regulate the pace of reading” (21). However, there is no need to interpret Radcliffe’s “embellishments” (95) as punitive. If nothing else, epigraphs and poems are an unlikely choice of corrective for an author battling the sin of skipping, since their typographical isolation allows readers to identify and ignore them almost without a thought.  Rather, I argue that Radcliffe’s notably extensive “beauties” are, like the technique of the explained supernatural, part of the political-aesthetic agenda discussed above.
Just as her rational explanations allowed Radcliffe to incorporate empowering myths unapologetically into modern literature, so too do her “embellishments” allow her to demonstrate her literary seriousness. Price herself notes that the prevalence in the novel of material that ought not be skipped, particularly her original poetry, “differentiates Radcliffe,” in reviewers’ minds, “from mere entertainers” (97). But Radcliffe doesn’t simply write and quote poetry: she also fills her text with landscapes and architecture, drawing on the literary traditions of travel narratives; with moral contemplations that wouldn’t be out of place in popular sentimental novels; with dramatic structures and staging that owe an obvious debt to the theatre; and, of course, with all the traditions of romance. Even the frustrating digressions of her comic servants come straight from Shakespeare. Walpole had, much earlier, “designedly” introduced bumbling servants based on the model of a “higher authority,” namely, “the great master of nature, SHAKESPEARE” (22). Indeed, Walpole provides a direct description of the Gothic-as-new-Classic framework, comparing Shakespeare to “the Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus… inserted a little boy measuring his thumb” (22). But whereas Walpole must explain and justify his lineage, Radcliffe allows it to go without saying. Walpole’s preface points to specific characters, and scenes, but Radcliffe attributes her epigraphs, whichever play they are drawn from or character they are spoken by, to, simply, “Shakespeare.” In the strength of her unifying vision, Radcliffe is like the Romantic poet, discussed by Tilar Mazzeo; she subordinates all her literary borrowings to a singular goal, ‘mastering’ them with her individual genius, and thus transforms them. Udolpho’s “beauties” go beyond embellishment to create a deeply intertextual novel, which is built upon diverse foundations but stands upon its own authority.

            <Title>conclusion: no binaries</Title>
            <Text>My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself. I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool. In doing so, I have found evidence at various points of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions. However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel nature of any binary distinctions one might wish to draw. McCarty argues that “a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question” — of these, he says, “failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result” (McCarty). Accordingly, my failure to find a an obvious or stable gender divide within the Gothic is valuable as evidence that in the broadest context of the Gothic, the conversation occurring between novels is not driven by authorial gender.</Text>

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

—

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Text>It it telling that Samuels and McGann refer to their deformations as a “deformative program” which is “run… through a particular work” to produce unpredictable but replicable”results” (36).
[Samuels and McGann initially exclude modes of criticism that “do not aim to be interpretive” from their analysis; their examples of ostensibly non-interpretive criticism are “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” but [would include models like mine] (26).] [However, they ultimately conclude that it’s all interpretive (46).] 

Role of experiments: Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40). “‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
they class “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” — [which is basically my stuff] — as non-interpretive (26). [Therefore, that stuff that didn’t look “interpretive” actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]



“The usual object of interpretation is ‘meaning,’ or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable … In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and … some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ‘for’ the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s).” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)
They “propose… another way of engaging imaginative work” which “moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into … performative operations.” They argue that “concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)

Emily Dickinson’s habit of reading poems backward is “a spendid model for… deformative criticism” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). “Her procedure… follows a romantic awareness… that poems lose their vital force when they succumb to familiarization” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). Despite affinity with modernist techniques of estrangement, “Dickinson’s critical model is performative, not intellectual” (Samuels &amp; McGann 29). “Reading Backward short circuits the sign of prose transparency and reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 30)

“First, imaginative work has an elective affinity with performance: it is organized as rhetoric and poiesis rather than as exposition and information-transmission. Because this is so, it always lies open to deformative moves.” Second, “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33) “Here we want to point out that lines of performative and deformative critical activity have always existed,” including “Elaborate scholarly editions” and “translations” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33).
“Because ‘a translation [involves] the necessity of settling many points without discussion,’ [D.G.] Rosetti observes, it ‘remains perhaps the most direct form of commentary’ that can be brought to literary work.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34). For people who dislike Rosetti’s translation, “The critical thoroughness and integrity… is exactly the problem.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34).

“Deformative scholarship is all but forbidden, the thought of it either // irresponsible or damaging to critical seriousness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34-5), likely because the prime example is “Forgery” (35) and the category also includes “mistaken and deviant readings produced… by students unaware of an ignorance in their … understanding” (35). But they set these aside in favor of “interpretive deformation,” as exemplified by “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (Samuels and McGann 35).
“The reluctance shows… that interpreters — even radical ones — do not commonly locate hermeneutic vitality in the documentary features of literary works. Because meaning is assumed to develop as a linguistic event, critical deformance plays itself out in the field of the signifieds.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Critical and interpretive limits are thus regularly established” to excluse consideration of “the physical artifact, whose stability and integrity is taken as inbiolable” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35).
“From an interpretive point of view, this assumption brackets off from attention crutical features of imaginative works… so basic and conventionally governed — they are alphabetical and diacritical. they are the rules for character formation, character arrangement, and textual space, as well as for the structural forms of words, phrases, and higher morphemic and phonemic units— that readers tend to treat them as preinterpetive and precitical. In truth, however, they comprise the operating system of language” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Linguists, semioticians, bibliographers, and cognitive theorists regularly explore these territories, but their work is not normally concerned with interpretation in the customary sense — that is, with explaining aesthetic and stylistic features of works” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).
“But this enlargement of the subject matter of criticism does not define the most significant function of deformative operations. Far most important is the stochastic process it entails. … When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “…we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work,” so that “customary rules are… held in abeyance, to be chosen among… to be followed or nor as one decides,” resulting in “the dramatic exposure of subjectivity as a live and highly informative option of interpretive commentary” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).

They focus on “poetic deformations,” “organized into four types:” (36) reordered, isolating, altering, and adding (36-7). They focus on reordering and isolating poems, taking Wallace Stevens as their experimental ground.

“deformance does not banish interpretation. The reversed text is still subject to, still giving of, interpretive readings. Deformance does want to show that the poem’s intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40).

“we may usefully regard all criticism and interpretation as deformance. Scholars murder to dissect, as Wordsworth famously observed” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46) *** JUST LIKE LEAH PRICE’S ARGUMENT —&gt; Despite approaching the matter from very different projects, [both] have reached a similar conclusion about the [state of criticism] which makes my own approach differ not in fundamenal kind from the norm, but in degree and in [reflexiveness? obviousness?].
“Interpretation is the application of scientia to poiesis, or the effort to elucidate one discourse form in terms of another.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46).
“Interpretation for della Volpe… always displays a gap between the work being examined and the student. But this gap does not represent a failure of criticism, or even a mysticism of poiesis. It locates the source and end and test of the art being examined” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47). The gap comes into being as soon as the critic must paraphrase the text. “Interpretation, then, is a constellation of paraphrases that evolve… from an uncritical to a critical moment” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47)
In della Volpe’s work, “to attempt a socio-historical paraphrase is to experiment with the poetical work, to subject it to a hypothesis of its meanings. As in any scientific experiment with natural phenomena, the engagement with the ordinary phenomenon inevitably exposes the limits of the hypothesis, and ultimaely returns us to an even more acute sense of the phenomena we desire to understand. … By contrast,” their deformances “place primary emphasis on the preconceptual elements of the text” because “social and historical formations seem to us far less determinate, far more open to arbitrary and imaginative construction, than the appear in della Volpe” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works… allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49) 
“To essay a more direct application of ‘interpretation’ to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment withthe work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. … one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)
“To deliberately accept the inevitable failure of interpretive ‘adequacy’ is to work toward discovering new interpretive virtues… This attitude toward literate comprehension, and the kind of criticism it inspires, gains its power by baring its own devices.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)</Text>

            <Text>[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] [Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens.] His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception. Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for his 500 texts, Frank provides 309 unique classifications. [His “types” accord with Frow’s understanding of genre; it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses.] His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), correcting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traces systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. [They are hardly even deterministic: Most strikingly, The Mysteries of Ferney Castle is listed twice, once under each of its disputed authors, and receives a different Gothic type in each entry: Pure or high Gothic (terror mode) at entry 188 by Robert Huish, and  Gothified history (Radcliffean imitation) at entry 222 by G. Lambe.] Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.

            <Comments>The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.
Most of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.</Comments>

            <Title>Ramsay</Title>
            <Text>But "algorithmic criticism" — criticism prompted by the algorithmic manipulation of literary texts — either does not exist, or exists only in nascent form. The digital revolution, for all its wonders, has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies, which, despite numerous revolutions of a more epistemological nature, remains mostly concerned with the interpretive analysis of written cultural artifacts. Texts are browsed, searched, and disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation. Even text analysis practitioners avoid bringing the hermeneutical freedom of criticism to the "outputted" text. Bold statements, strong readings, and broad generalizations (to say nothing of radical misreadings, anarchic accusations, agonistic paratextual revolts) are rare, if not entirely absent from the literature of the field, where the emphasis is far more often placed on methodology and the limitations it imposes.


The computer is certainly incapable of offering "the shift to a redemptive world-view" as a solution to the problem at hand; it is wholly incapable of inferring this from the data. But is it likewise the case that computational results — the data and visualizations that the computer generates when it seeks to quantize and measure textual phenomena — cannot be used to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead one to such a conclusion?
It is useful to put the question this way, because in doing so we refocus the hermeneutical problem away from the nature and limits of computation (which is mostly a matter of methodology) and move it toward consideration of the nature of the discourse in which text analysis bids participation.



But in literary criticism — and here I am thinking of ordinary "paper based" literary criticism — conclusions are evaluated not in terms of what propositions the data allows, but in terms of the nature and depth of the discussions that result. The scientist is right to say that the plural of anecdote is not data, but in literary criticism, an abundance of anecdote is precisely what allows discussion and debate to move forward.


These are provocative results, but the provocation is as much about our sense of what we are doing (the hermeneutical question) as it is about how we are doing it (the methodological question).

If algorithmic criticism is to have a central hermeneutical tenet, it is this: that the narrowing constraints of computational logic — the irreducible tendency of the computer toward enumeration, measurement, and verification — are fully compatible with the goals of criticism set forth above. For while it is possible, and in some cases useful, to confine algorithmic procedures to the scientific realm, such procedures can be made to conform to the methodological project of inventio without transforming the nature of computation or limiting the rhetorical range of critical inquiry. This is possible, because critical reading practices already contain elements of the algorithmic.

Any reading of a text that is not a recapitulation of that text relies on a heuristic of radical transformation. The critic who endeavors to put forth a "reading," puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced. This basic property of critical methodology is evident not only in the act of "close reading," but in the more ambitious project of thematic exegesis. In the classroom, one encounters the exegete instructing his or her students to turn to page 254, and then to page 16, and finally to page 400. They are told to consider just the male characters, or just the female ones, or to pay attention to the adjectives, the rhyme scheme, images of water, or the moment in which Nora Helmer confronts her husband. The interpreter will set a novel against the background of the Jacobite Rebellion, or a play amid the historical location of the theater. He or she will view the text through the lens of Marxism, or psychoanalysis, or existentialism, or postmodernism. In every case, what is being read is not the "original" text, but a text transformed and transduced into an alternative vision, in which, as Wittgenstein put it, we "see an aspect" that further enables discussion and debate.

It is not that such matters as redemptive world views and Marxist readings of texts can be arrived at algorithmically, but simply that algorithmic transformation can provide the alternative visions that give rise to such readings. The computer does this in a particularly useful way by carrying out transformations in a rigidly holistic manner. It is one thing to notice patterns of vocabulary, variations in line length, or images of darkness and light; it is another thing to employ a machine that can unerringly discover every instance of such features across a massive corpus of literary texts and then present those features in a visual format entirely foreign to the original organization in which these features appear. Or rather, it is the same thing at a different scale and with expanded powers of observation. It is in such results that the critic seek not facts, but patterns. And from pattern, the critic may move to the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading.


 Algorithmic criticism would have to retain the commitment to methodological rigor demanded by its tools, but the emphasis would be less on maintaining a correspondence or a fitness between method and goal, and more on the need to present methods in a fully transparent manner. It would not be averse to the idea of reproducibility, but it would perhaps be even more committed to the notion of "hackability." For just as one might undertake a feminist reading of a text by transporting a set of heuristics from one critical context to another, so might the algorithmic critic undertake a particular type of reading by transforming a procedure that has been defined in terms of that most modern text, the computer program.
Algorithmic criticism undoubtedly requires a revolution of sorts, but that revolution is not one of new procedures and methods in contradistinction to the old ones. Algorithmic criticism seeks a new kind of audience for text analysis — one that is less concerned with fitness of method and the determination of interpretive boundaries, and one more concerned with evaluating the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates. Such an audience exists, of course, and has existed for the better part of a century in the general community of literary critics from which text analysis has often found itself exiled. For this reason, text analysis practitioners should view the possibility of such a revolution as both welcome and liberating —not a critique of their methods, but a bold vote of confidence in the possibilities they hold.

            <Text>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. [Each word of Frank’s Gothic types becomes its own tag.] Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “high”, “Gothic”, “terror”, “horror”, “mode”, and “Radcliffean.” This process generated 254 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two novels. [My model of the Gothic types, then, has X assumptions and priorities.] From there, my search for gendered types followed the same principles as my analysis of Tracy’s motif, asking, does the association of this tag with a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author? [Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different moves], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Perhaps for that reason, Frank’s Gothic types do not point toward a clear Male Gothic tradition, but do show a Female Gothic.]</Text>

However, of those X novels tagged as horror, X were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere X books are pure “horror mode.” If we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, seaparating out the “horror-terror” mixed-mode books as a third mode, our gendered expectations fall apart: the X pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors. Instead, it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship (X% male).

            <Text>Alex Wetmore, Men of Feeling in Eighteenth-Century Literature: Touching Fic- 
tion (Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave, 2013) 
“Alex Wetmore argues for the congruity between the printed bodies of sentimental books and the mechanized men of feeling presented within their pages.”
“Sentimental novels by Henry Brooke, laurence Sterne, tobias Smollett, and Henry Mackenzie are the focus of Men of Feeling”
“Wetmore introduces a useful term, “corporeal defamiliarization,” to denote how sentimental novels denaturalize their status as touchable book-objects.”
“Wetmore compellingly argues that sentimental self-consciousness can be understood to have the matter of the book and the body at its fraught center. Sentimental self-reflexivity, therefore, is not the metafictional, proto-postmodern irony that our moment in history might tempt us to identify it as being.”
“sentimental  fiction’s corporeal defamiliarization works in tandem with the genre’s palliative goal of expanding and extending nervous sensibilities.”
“Wetmore argues that toward the end of the century, the connective tissue binding sentimentality to self-referentiality was severed. newly suspicious approaches to sensibility are deployed in works across the political spectrum during this period: for example, Mary robinson’s The Natural Daughter (1799); Elizabeth Hamilton’s Memoirs of Modern Philosophers (1800); and robert Bage’s Hermsprong (1796). Each text reworks devices of corporeal defamiliarization deployed by Smollett, Mackenzie, and Sterne, respectively.”

“In contrast to post-Romantic modernity’s “axiomatic presupposition of a deep inner core of selfhood,” this ancien régime approached the borders of the self as “mutable, malleable, unreliable, divisible, replaceable, transferable, manipulable, escapable, or otherwise fuzzy around the edges.””

Gothic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 
“Once-dominant psychoanalytic and feminist interpretations have given way to critical work drawing on political and religious history, print culture studies, theories of media and remediation, and new formalism.”
“Edward Jacobs substantiates her role in establishing a new discursive mode: radcliffe’s “reproducible set of generic conventions” (52) cooperated with the cataloging practices of circulating libraries to form a readership inclined “to approach books less as unique texts than as members of genres””
“acobs claims in his informative chapter that radcliffe’s inclusion of poetry in her novels staged an opposition between two modes of reading: the “‘deep’, contemplative, repetitive reading” of “high” literary texts, and the super cial consumption of plot-driven entertainments associated with a “popular” and feminized media market”
 Dismissing the Gothic–romantic binary as a “hangover from the Victorians,” robert Miles develops the concept of a “popular romanticism” (117), in which radcliffe leaves unresolved the opposition between a disciplined, secular, and Enlightened modern subjectivity located in linear time and a porous premodern subjectivity “embedded in nature, which is animated, alive with spirits that effortlessly cross spatial and temporal boundaries”
in her chapter on how the ruined abbey in The Romance of the Forest represents “the historical and religious past that a modern, secularising culture was trying to bury” (100), Diane long hoeveler demonstrates her impressively extensive reading by citing parallels from obscure Gothic novels for the discovered manuscript topos, the villain who dies by poisoning himself, and the Gothic abbey as setting.

            <Title>I don’t think the question of defining the gothic is</Title>
            <Text>I don’t think the question of defining the gothic is interesting… or do I?
I definitely don’t want to undertake definition through individual monumental works. I think it’s partly historical happenstance that we have canonized the particular works that we have
(I’m thinking here about The Making of a Marchioness, and the way that this third-tier Burnett has become so rich and important to me; there are surely reasons that it’s not as enormously popular as A Little Princess, and indeed that The Secret Garden beats out A Little Princess too, but — those reasons aren’t, I don’t think, due entirely to literary superiority. There are other things too.)
Implicitly I see the Gothic defined as “stuff that other people looked at and thought was Gothic enough to jot down” — and I see the next step to be seeking continuities within the works and connections/“synergies” between the criticism. 
(I DEFINITELY need to combine Frank &amp; Tracy to get at this point though — e.g., what motifs are most predictive of the sentimental? Of horror? What kinds of stories have subterannean passages?) — I can do that with pivot tables in Google Sheets</Text>

            <Title>Abstract outline</Title>
            <Text>Humanities journals are less likely to publish abstracts, but they are still a useful tool in thinking through your article and getting it through the peer review process. In the humanities, published abstracts often tend to omit information on the methodology or findings. The order of information also tends to be looser than in social science abstracts. The basic ingredients of a solid abstract in the humanities can include the following. 
	•	Context-that is, information on the historical period, the geographic region, the social conditions surrounding the human creations being investigated 
	•	Subject-the literary or artistic works being discussed, their creators and dates 
	•	Claim for significance-announcement about the uniqueness of the subject or your approach to it 
	•	Theoretical framework-often more suggested than stated, the theory you are using to discuss the subject, such as feminist or psychoanalytic approaches
	•	Argument-what your analysis of the subject revealed about the subject, current approaches to the subject, or society
	•	Proofs-your evidence for your argument about the subject, or the elements of the subject that you analyze (such as textual passages) </Text>

            <Text>"Temporary Failure of Mind": Déjà vu and Epilepsy in Radcliffe's 
The Mysteries of Udolpho 
Brandy Lain Schillace 
At the time The Mysteries of Udolpho was published, déjà vu had not been connected to epilepsy. Yet, as déjà vu routinely accompanies epileptic seizures, it is no surprise to find them linked in fiction, even if that link is not clinically explained; the disease and its symptoms pre-exist scientific authentication. Reading Udolpho with an understanding of the epileptic condition—its relationship to melancholy, its production of anxiety over self-boundaries and its mimicry of madness—opens new possibilities for gothic criticism. As a symptomatic text, The Mysteries of Udolpho connects manifestations of epilepsy to the Gothic's preoccupation with dreamy or altered states.
p.275: In its representations of the dreamy, the disorienting, and the doubled, The Mysteries of Udolpho explores not the supernatural, but the psychological and the neurological. Reading Udolpho with an understanding of the epileptic condition—its relationship to melancholy, its production of anxiety over self-boundaries and its mimicry of madness—opens new possibilities for gothic criticism. By exploring current and eighteenth-century understandings of epilepsy and its auras, and by reading Emily as an epileptic subject designed to court the empathy and identi cation of her readers, we see how Radcliffe’s most terrifying horrors are those that threaten the mind and lead to the dissolution of the self. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.286:  the gothic tradition was in dialog with epilepsy discourse at a time when fractures of identity were recognizable and terrifying phenomena. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.286: Udolpho and the gothic tradition that followed in its footsteps combine memory, identity boundaries, madness, and the dreamy and altered states they so often illustrate to create a horror that was not tied to the supernatural—at least not directly -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.287: Our own lingering interest in the Gothic suggests a way in which participation in literature, gothic or otherwise, forces us to confront the disorienting spectralization not of others but of ourselves—and it is we as readers who crave, even more than Emily herself, the “suspense that enthrall[s] the vulgar” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017</Text>

            <Title>Tracy values uniqueness</Title>
            <Text>[First, let us examine Tracy’s model] [Tracy’s bibliography, published in 1981, indexes 208 novels, X by women, X by men, and X unknown.] [Her selection methods are not systematic; rather, having travelled to a range of archives to examine works with promising titles which turned out not to contain any demons, .]  [Tracy’s most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of distinctive individuals motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, she intentionally excluded the most popular motifs: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,” and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”. Tracy’s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — thus become the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.</Text>

"No Colour of Language": Radcliffe's Aesthetic Unbound 
This essay reads Ann Radcliffe's celebrated landscapes in light of their remarkable infusion with "every colour that paints the rainbow"—an infusion that links Radcliffe's gothic fictions with contemporary aesthetic theory. But that theory often doubled as a kind of early speech act theory, and against its background, I argue, Radcliffe's colors emerge as a mode and method of signaling the presence and politics of linguistic mediation. Radcliffe herself identifies "tint" and "hue" with the ever-inadequate "colours of language," allowing us to read Radcliffe's landscapes as subversive pictures of nothing but the (here feminine) perception that frames them.
“It is a pity that Ann Radcliffe’s “language” should so often lament its own insufficiency of “colour,” when color is one of the qualities that most vividly distinguishes her prose fiction from that of virtually all of her predecessors and contemporaries.”
“Here, I would like to approach these complementary effects of abstraction and coloration as fundamentally linguistic devices which in Radcliffe’s hands find themselves further filtered through the scrim of specifically feminine perception.”
p.386: In all their “rich colouring” (SR 104), Radcliffe’s landscapes cannot in truth be said to consist in more than the “beauties and effects” of the English language; in an importantly literal sense, there is nothing more to them. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.387: Just so, when we turn to Radcliffe’s use of specific “hue[s]” to enhance her scenery, we often find color detaching itself from material bodies, not to abandon them but to span the chasm that apparently divides those bodies from ideal forms and values. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.389: Because the descriptions she derived from those authorities aim to make us see nothing through them, but everything in them, they sabotage their own pictorial pretensions. This amounts to true aesthetic critique, even as it challenges from within a culturally cherished superstition about written language -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.389: Thus obsessively repeated textual “effects” like light’s dissolution into mist, or its refraction into color, are not in themselves merely slavish reflections of Burke’s sublime, Reynolds’s abstraction, or for that matter, the Newtonian optics from which both of these ideals were derived. Rather, such Radcliffean signatures trace—indeed literalize—the circumstances under which aesthetic figure and cultural ground become one. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017</Text>

            <Title>my model of Tracy</Title>
            <Text>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitivitity to [???] for sensitivity to [?????]] An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate a Male Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.</Text>
            <Comments>Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts. 
I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.</Comments>

p.616: The terrific flood of books about the gothic novel continues unabated. A vastly popular mode of undisputed resonance and influence offers great opportunity to scholars of enterprise and energy.  -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617:p.616: Watt, the more political of the two scholars, assesses the labels that might be applied to different writers; Gamer, the more formalist (as his subtitle reflects), focuses more on moral and psychological atti- --  tudes. Both studies regard authors as speaking within and to their immediately contemporary circles -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: both books lack the political passion of David Punter or the psychological intensity motivating both New Critical readings (Robert Kiely’s Romantic Novel in England, still the best in this line, remains unmentioned) and the subsequent Freudian and post-Freudian work of Eve Sedgwick and Terry Castle. The literature of (German) terror is now a garden of (English) delight. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: The depth of Watt’s and Gamer’s research persuades me that on historical grounds they are basically right and will help set gothic studies in a calmer view. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Whether the gothic is best seen with this kind of wide-eyed clarity is an open question. There is a New Positivism in these books that wants settled truths and definitions. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Watt is a nominalist. His governing premise is that the gothic is manifold: “The Gothic romance is a hybrid genre, its diverse affiliations best understood by way of detailed case studies of authors, works, and publishing events, and via a focus on the kinds of classification made by contemporary critics and reviewers” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Watt unearths a popular tradition of stories of recovered order and restored houses. Even though the narratives are only intermittently or glancingly gothic, they form an important context for the plot structures of better-known works. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
Still, it is easier to feel more respect than enthusiasm for so level-headed a book. In taking its evidence apart, nominalism loses its thrust. The book dis- solves into its object, becoming itself the recuperative loyalist romance that it finds in its materials. Diversity turns out to be the mark of drift; nothing has the power to upset the apple-cart, and the wagon rolls onward, albeit unevenly, to- ward its market reward. The four featured authors exhibit in different flavors a common tendency to retreat from commitment into irresponsibility or consola- tion. Nothing too frightening endures. 
Consequently, the book is perhaps most useful in provoking a response. Its critique lays the groundwork for a defense of the gothic. 
Gamer follows (and acknowledges) Watt in arguing for the diversity of the gothic. “I define the gothic neither as a mode nor as a kind of fiction (the ‘gothic novel’) but . . . as a ‘shifting’ aesthetic” (4). Objecting to Fredric Jame- son’s conception of genre as ideology, he stresses “gothic’s ideological flexibility” and “mutability” (45, 51). He gives shape to the flux by configuring it in terms of more settled oppositions such as masculine and feminine, elite and popular, ma- ture and adolescent, modern and antique, real and romantic. An insistence on contradiction gives positioning precedence over invention. 
p.621: What is the gothic? That is the core question neither of these books really even poses. (Perhaps they are too impressed by Robert Miles’s Gothic Writing, 1750–1820: A Genealogy [London: Routledge, 1993], which says (p. 4) that gothic is an “ambiguous, shifting term, but then the textual phenomena to which it points are shifting and ambiguous.” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: Neither book here sufficiently distinguishes the popular German ghost stories from the better novels that departed from them. Mary Shelley and her companions read one of those books on a rainy afternoon, and she wrote Frankenstein in response. But though she calls it a “ghost story,” it transparently isn’t one. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: For surely, even as they sought the approbation of readers and reviewers to dignify their enterprise, writers also had to endow their works with a content and a purpose.  -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: Gamer, like Watt, has written an account of prosaic gothic that will stand as a valuable prolegomenon to a study of the poetic richness of gothic meanings. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017

            <Title>Male Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.</Text>

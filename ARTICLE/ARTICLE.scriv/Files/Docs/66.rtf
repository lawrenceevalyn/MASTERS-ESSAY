[In Tracy, the Male Gothic was a distinct [grouping] of what seem to be horror-Gothics, outnumbered by [the Shared Gothic].] [Frank does confirm the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary.] The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged \'93terror\'94 and only 24 (13%) tagged \'93horror.\'94 The more-popular terror mode is non-gendered (53% female, 47% male), while the horror mode tends toward male authorship (62% male). However, of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books are pure \'93horror mode.\'94 If we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, seaparating out the \'93horror-terror\'94 mixed-mode books as a third mode, our gendered expectations fall apart: the 10 pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors. Instead, it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship (71% male). [It seems, then, that although the relative prominence of the two modes accords with our expectations based on Tracy\'92s, the critical identification of terror and horror does not have a basis in gendered patterns of use. ???]}

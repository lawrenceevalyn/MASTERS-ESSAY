More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four \'97 elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives \'97 are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is \'97 that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre \'97 the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. [This is basically mathematically inevitable, and points to the impossibility of a genre being one genre with two non-overlapping schools.] In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [Include percentage of total novels per motif.] Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows a gendered divide.}

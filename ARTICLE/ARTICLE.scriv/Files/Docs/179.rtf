\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 [The first thing I want to question is whether it makes sense to treat Gothic works by women as a category.] [Basically everybody proceeds from the assumption that the Male Gothic and the Female Gothic are things.] [Even fairly generalist works like The Oxford Handbook, generally a historicist / bibliographical work, take the aesthetic subgenre of the \'93female Gothic\'94 for granted.] [David Richter defines both male and female camps: \'93\cb1 The \'91female Gothic\'92 is \'85 a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The \'91male Gothic\'92 is a punitive tragedy\'85in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure.\'94 (CITE The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance p 479)\cb3 ] [Even Barbara Benedict\'92s \'93\'91Male\'92 and \'91Female\'92 Novels?\'94 says \'93\cb1 the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world\'94 (CITE p 364)\cb3 ]. [but they are much less uniform so I will seek to attend to their real variety]}

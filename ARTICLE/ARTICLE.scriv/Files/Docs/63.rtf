Adapting Frank\'92s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex \'93Gothic types\'94  by dividing each \'93type\'94 into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://40A71AA1-AC4F-4C83-88DE-25B4DCC306F5"}}{\fldrslt tag.}} This process generated \cf2 \cb1 216\cf2 \cb3  unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two novels. [My model of the Gothic types, then, has X assumptions and priorities.] From there, my search for gendered types followed the same principles as my analysis of Tracy\'92s motif, asking, does the association of this tag with a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work\'92s author? [Because Frank\'92s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of \'93yes\'94 to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different modes], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Perhaps for that reason, Frank\'92s Gothic types do not point toward a clear men\'92s Gothic tradition, but do show a women\'92s Gothic.]}

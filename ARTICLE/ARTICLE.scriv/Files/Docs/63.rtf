Adapting Frank\'92s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex \'93Gothic types\'94  by dividing each \'93type\'94 into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as \'93Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)\'94 becomes \'93domestic\'94 and \'93Gothic elements.\'94 Similarly, Radcliffe\'92s The Italian, listed as \'93Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)\'94 becomes \'93high\'94, \'93Gothic\'94, \'93terror mode\'94, \'93horror mode\'94, and \'93Radcliffean.\'94 This process generated 45 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two novels. [My model of the Gothic types, then, has X assumptions and priorities.] From there, my search for gendered types followed the same principles as my analysis of Tracy\'92s motif, asking, does the association of this tag with a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work\'92s author? [Because Frank\'92s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of \'93yes\'94 to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different moves], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Perhaps for that reason, Frank\'92s Gothic types do not point toward a clear Male Gothic tradition, but do show a Female Gothic.]}

Adapting Frank\'92s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex \'93Gothic types\'94  by dividing each \'93type\'94 into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://40A71AA1-AC4F-4C83-88DE-25B4DCC306F5"}}{\fldrslt tag.}} This process generated \cf2 \cb1 216\cf2 \cb3  unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. [My model [imposes a slightly more systematic ontology, treating each \'93tag\'94 as informative on its own [regarding the horizon of critical expectations]] [but still preserves the possibility for things to overlap].] [I ask whether the association of this tag with a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work\'92s author] [Because Frank\'92s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of \'93yes\'94 to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different modes], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Transition sentence: maybe that he shows a strong female gothic  but a more elusive male one?]}

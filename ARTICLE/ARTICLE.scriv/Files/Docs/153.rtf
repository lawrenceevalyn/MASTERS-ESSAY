[This correlation, essentially, confirms that our rough guess was right re: Tracy\'92s motifs, that the men\'92s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women\'92s Gothic less so.] [It also suggests that, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3DF4758A-6A4B-448D-A246-0D1C3DB96E40"}}{\fldrslt when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it (men\'92s horror) at the expense of non-motif-ifiable features which better define the mainstream.}}] [{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5DC0F661-C844-478C-BCAF-54AA8072C4A5"}}{\fldrslt Frank\'92s more subjective model [takes more work to render graspable / provides fewer things to count that feel obviously countable] but it ultimately reveals the women\'92s Gothic in the sentimental.}}]}

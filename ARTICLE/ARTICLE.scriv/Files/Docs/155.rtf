[The \'93terror\'94 tag is less strongly defined by its motifs.] [It has no motifs which appear with 20% greater frequency in \'93terror\'94 works than in the baseline.] [This is in sharp contrast to the \'93horror\'94 tag, which had 43 motifs occurring in horror works with 20% greater frequency or higher.] [\'93Terror\'94 shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than baseline), suicide mentions (18%), female fainting (18%), and secret doors (18%), but all of these appear more in \'93horror\'94 works than they do in \'93terror.\'94] [Although terror is very similar to the baseline, it can still be distinguished from horror.] [One motif appear with triple frequency in terror works compared to horror: \'93speech, unfinished, on deathbed\'94] [Appearing a little more than twice as often are \'93good abbess\'94, and \'93good clergyman,\'94 and a little less than twice are \'93attempted or contemplated suicide\'94 and \'93lunacy\'94] [None of these motifs drew our attention the first time, so it is interesting to see them distinguished now] [But they simply reaffirm that terror is mainstream / isn\'92t gendered]}

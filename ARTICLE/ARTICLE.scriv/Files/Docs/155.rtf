The \'93terror\'94 tag is less strongly defined by its motifs. Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within \'93terror\'94 works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points \'97 none of them represent even a 20% increase over the baseline. In sharp contrast, the \'93horror\'94 tag shows 43 motifs with a 20% or greater increase in frequency. \'93Terror\'94 shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than baseline), suicide mentions (18%), female fainting (18%), and secret doors (18%), but all of these appear more in \'93horror\'94 works than they do in \'93terror.\'94 Although terror is very similar to the mainstream, it can still be distinguished from horror. One motif appears with triple frequency in terror works compared to horror: \'93speech, unfinished, on deathbed.\'94  Appearing a little more than twice as often are \'93good abbess\'94, and \'93good clergyman,\'94 and a little less than twice are \'93attempted or contemplated suicide\'94 and \'93lunacy.\'94 [None of these motifs drew our attention the first time, so it is interesting to see them distinguished now] [But they simply reaffirm that terror is mainstream / isn\'92t gendered]}

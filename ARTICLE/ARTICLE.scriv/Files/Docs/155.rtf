The \'93terror\'94 tag, as expected, is less strongly defined by its motifs. Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within \'93terror\'94 works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points \'97 none of them represent even a 20% increase over the baseline. [This is in sharp contrast to the 43 motifs which appear in \'93horror\'94 works with a 20% or greater increase in frequency.] If we examine the top of the \'93terror\'94 list anyway, the tag shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than baseline), suicide mentions (18%), female fainting (18%), and secret doors (18%), but all of these appear more in \'93horror\'94 works than they do in \'93terror.\'94 Fainting, suicide, and secret doors might allow us to distinguish terror and horror Gothics from [sentimental?], but they [are not useful in defining a terror/horror divide / distinguishing terror and horror from each other].] [To seek out that distinction, we can again compare the two tags to each other instead of just comparing terror to the baseline.] [From this view too], however, there are fewer motifs, with weaker correlations: whereas there were three motifs which appeared four or five times more often in horror works than terror works, there are no motifs which distinguish terror that strongly. One motif does appear with triple frequency in terror works compared to horror: \'93speech, unfinished, on deathbed.\'94  Appearing a little more than twice as often are \'93good abbess\'94, and \'93good clergyman,\'94 and a little less than twice are \'93attempted or contemplated suicide\'94 and \'93lunacy.\'94 None of these motifs drew our attention when we examined Tracy alone, because they are not strongly gendered. [It is interesting to see them distinguished now, and consider them as potential markers of a terror Gothic as distinct from a women\'92s Gothic.] [But they simply reaffirm that terror is mainstream / isn\'92t gendered]}

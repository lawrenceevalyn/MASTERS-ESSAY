[
\i I need some kind of actual introduction here.
\i0 ] Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same.\cf3 \cb4  In doing so, \cf3 \cb1 I find that \cf2 men\'92s and women\'92s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. }

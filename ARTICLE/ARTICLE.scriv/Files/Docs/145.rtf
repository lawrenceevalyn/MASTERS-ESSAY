[A men\'92s Gothic is more elusive in Frank\'92s model] [Like in Tracy\'92s the men\'92s tags are mostly visible among the tags which apply only to very few novels / make up a minor tradition.] [Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these] [But men actually outnumber women in the \'93Germanic\'94 tag (which encompasses \'93German\'94, \'93Germanic\'94, \'93Schauerroman\'94, \'93Rauberroman\'94, and \'93Ritterroman\'94) \'97 of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%).] [\'93Horror\'94, too, is disproportionately male \'97 42%, fairly above their baseline 31%, though not astonishing.] [As mentioned above, \'93Lewisite\'94 is about the same.] [More strikingly male-dominated are two Gothic threads which would be completely invisible in Tracy\'92s motif-focused view: \'93polemical\'94 and \'93prototypical\'94 works.] [12 works are identified as \'93proto\'94 or \'93early\'94 forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%)] [Suggests a genre that has more masculine roots than it does a destination.] [A slightly larger group of works, 19 total, exists between the tags \'93polemical,\'94 \'93philosophical,\'94 \'93political,\'94 and \'93radical/revolutionary\'94 \'97 of these 19, 13 are by men (68%)][The highest male percentage that applies to more than one work is for \'93polemical\'94 Gothics, which fiercely flog some viewpoint or another: 83% of these six works are by men.] [This stands in contrast to \'93didactic\'94, also related, but 50% male and 50% female (12 didactic texts, 6 each)] [is this critical evaluation or a real difference????] [come to some kind of conclusion re: men\'92s Gothic]}

In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe\'92s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who are using them.] Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a new Female Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen\'92s, [whose] ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. However, [four is a small number, and unlike the wide-ranging male motifs which were well over the 60% line, it would only take a very few writers \'97 or one domestic Ann Radcliffe \'97 to produce these results]. The paucity of female motifs suggests that [seeing/defining a genre here] may be too hasty: this Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the [Shared??] Gothic.}

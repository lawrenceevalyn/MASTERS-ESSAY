[There are some horror motifs, and they seem reasonable] [Top of the list is \'93Inquisition\'94 \'97 63% of \'93horror\'94 Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif] [Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the exact same level of increase \'97 48% more secret doors in \'93horror\'94 novels than in the corpus as a whole.] [\'93Horror\'94 Gothics also have 47% more prophetic dreams, 46% more corpses, 40% more drugging, and 39% more banishment.] [In all of these, \'93horror\'94 is distinguished from the mainstream and also distinguished from \'93terror\'94 \'97 they occur two to three times more often with the \'93horror\'94 tag than with \'93terror\'94.] [Horror and terror are most sharply distinguished, though, by \'93actual incest\'94, which occurs five times more often with \'93horror\'94 than with \'93terror\'94. Interestingly, however, this represents 3 \'93horror\'94 tagged works and 2 \'93terror\'94 tagged works \'97 possibly the \'93terror\'94 ones are \'93horror-terror\'94? We know from Tracy that they are certainly all by male authors.] [The next strongest distinguishing motifs are \'93Satan and lesser demons\'94 and \'93loose woman\'94, both of which appear four times more frequently in \'93horror\'94 than in \'93terror\'94. Three times more frequent in \'93horror\'94 works are \'93rape\'94, \'93pre-nuptual death\'94, and \'93banishment.\'94] [All of these motifs paint a distinct horror tradition, which our earlier models also allow us to see as male.]  [But it complicates our understanding of \'93horror\'94 by introducing motifs which previously were not male-dominated enough to get mentally put in that bucket.]}

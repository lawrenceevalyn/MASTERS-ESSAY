[Context: the first flourishing of the Gothic; Male and Female Gothics] [Subject: \'91the school of Radcliffe\'92 itself] [Claim for significance: there\'92s kinda a male Gothic, but not really a female Gothic; mostly non-gendered] [Theoretical framework: modeling and deformance; explored the implicit models of two bilbiographies to build my own model] [Argument: the Gothic as a popular movement is not enormously shaped by authorial gender; moreover, its debt to German ghost stories is less than has been assumed. The Gothic\'92s roots are in the French sentimental novel.] [Proofs: correlations of motifs and Gothic types]}

[Frank\'92s mainstream is a little more female than Tracy\'92s.] The two most prevalent tags are \'93Gothic\'94 (83% of all works) and \'93pure/high\'94 (39%), both of which have [men women and unknown at almost perfectly their baselines] [But the third most prevalent tag is \'93terror\'94 (34% of works), which is 50% female, a bit above the female baseline.] [The next two tags in prominence highlight Frank\'92s [embrace of multiplicity?]: \'93mode\'94 (27%) and \'93elements\'94 (27%), which generally appear as qualifiers for his other assessments, as in \'93terror mode\'94 or \'93sentimental elements\'94.] [A lot of the tags have to do with Frank offering qualifications of some kind (mode, effects, Gothified, imitation).] [The Gothic is not monolithic; things mostly come from other places/ are interconnected] [Nothing for Frank is just one genre.] Horror and terror, for example, are far from mutually exclusive. Of the 53 \'93horror\'94 works, \cf2 \cb1 26\cf2 \cb3  (\cf2 \cb1 49\cf2 \cb3 %) are also tagged \'93terror\'94. These \cf2 \cb1 26\cf2 \cb3  are \cf2 \cb1 50\cf2 \cb3 % by men, making the horror-terror mode more predictive of male authorship than horror alone. Of the remaining \cf2 \cb1 27 works which are purely horror, no terror, there are 9 by women, 9\cf2 \cb3  by men, and \cf2 \cb1 9\cf2 \cb3  unknown \'97 [not a men\'92s horror Gothic at all.] [This is the reverse of Tracy \'97 Tracy showed a male horror and equal-opportunity terror mainstream; Frank shows equal-opportunity horror, and female terror] [Between the two, the only part that\'92s consistent is that terror vastly outnumbers horror.] [There are gendered currents, but none of them are striking enough to start making predictions about the many unsigned works.]}

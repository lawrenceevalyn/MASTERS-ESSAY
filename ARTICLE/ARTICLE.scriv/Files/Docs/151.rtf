[Obviously we need to correlate now] [It\'92s been a persistent problem/question whether Frank\'92s Gothic types were responding to actually gendered usage or imposing gendered interpretations] [With polemical vs didactic, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author\'92s gender] [But Tracy\'92s boolean motifs \'97 although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly lacking/vague in interpretive detail \'97 are at least safe from false positives] [We can evaluate the potentailly-gendered basis of Frank\'92s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag] [Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy\'92s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives] [But we can still hope for some true positives] SO: Does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell me anything about what motifs it probably has?}

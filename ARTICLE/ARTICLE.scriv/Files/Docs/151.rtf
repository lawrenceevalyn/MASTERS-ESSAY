\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It\'92s been an open question to this point whether Frank\'92s Gothic types were responding to actually gendered usage or imposing gendered interpretations. When it comes to assessing a work as \'93polemical\'94 versus \'93didactic\'94, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author\'92s gender. [But Tracy\'92s boolean motifs \'97 although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly lacking/vague in interpretive detail \'97 are at least safe from false positives] [We can thus evaluate the potentially-gendered basis of Frank\'92s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag] [Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy\'92s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives] [But we can still hope for some true positives] [SO:] Does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell us anything about what motifs it probably has? [For both \'93terror\'94 and \'93horror\'94, we can examine the motifs which distinguish it from the baseline mainstream Gothic, and which motifs distinguish it from the other tag.]}

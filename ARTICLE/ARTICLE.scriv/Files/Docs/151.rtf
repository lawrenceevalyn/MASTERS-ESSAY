\f0\fs24 \cf0 Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It\'92s been a open question to this point whether Frank\'92s Gothic types were responding to actually gendered usage or imposing gendered interpretations. When it comes to assessing a work as \'93polemical\'94 versus \'93didactic\'94, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author\'92s gender.

[But Tracy\'92s boolean motifs \'97 although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly lacking/vague in interpretive detail \'97 are at least safe from false positives] [We can thus evaluate the potentially-gendered basis of Frank\'92s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag] [Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy\'92s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives] [But we can still hope for some true positives] [SO:] Does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell us anything about what motifs it probably has? [For both \'93terror\'94 and \'93horror\'94, we can examine the motifs which distinguish it from the baseline mainstream Gothic, and which motifs distinguish it from the other tag.]}

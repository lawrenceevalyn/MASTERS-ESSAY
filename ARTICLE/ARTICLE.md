# Abstract #

Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.

## thesis: my bibs have thin description ##

[This paper emphasizes the continuities between newfangled computational approaches to literature and the most traditional/old-fashioned literary research, archival bibliographical research] [Heather Love turns to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods … I propose (qualitative computational modelling?) as another method which seeks the same goals] [[Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) (CITE Love Thin 404)] but with the reward that “one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” (Love Thin 407)]  [I add to this that good descriptions offer themselves up for reuse and recombination, by rendering somehow graspable that which they describe] [Love says that “Good descriptions are in a sense rich, but not because they truck with imponderables … They are close, but they are not deep; rather than adding anything “extra” to the description, they account for the real variety that is already there.  (Love 377)”] [It is the work of accounting for real variety that both bibliography and computation demand: the systems/models must have a way to cope with odd cases] [I use computational interventions to interrogate the literary models represented in two older bibliographies] [In so doing, I argue, I demonstrate the utility of qualitative description for the field, a promising avenue toward revisiting older scholarships / maintaining / re-forging connections with the work that has come before] [I also seek to bridge the gap between historical and aethetic attempts to study the Gothic in the late 18thC]

## I care about female gothic ##

[By I turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic (particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”), I examine a mass of books that nobody wanted to get stuck reading even when they were first published][(cite garside on publishers’s exasperation)] [nowadays “Almost all of these novels have long since been deservedly forgotten.” (CITE review of Garside)] [but they are much less uniform so I will seek to attend to their real variety]

## lit review: female gothic ##

Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”[^cf1], to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”.[^cf2] Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [relationships between women and their world] to [relationships between texts]. [More generalist works, too, like The Oxford Handbook, generally a historicist / bibliographical work, take an aesthetic subgenre of the “female Gothic” for granted.] [David Richter defines both male and female camps: “The ‘female Gothic’ is … a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy…in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure.” (CITE The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance p 479)] [Even Barbara Benedict’s “‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Novels?” says “the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world” (CITE p 364)] [This shift is] exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”.[^cf3] These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go halfway between the early discussion of woman vs. patriarchy and book vs. book, to consider [???].] [mention here in passing something about how it’s reasonable to expect different things produced by authoresses?] [Is there, in the works being written, a women’s Gothic?]

## can't ID a genre in isolation ##

My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”[^cf4]. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] 

## lit review: bibliographies ##

[Garside’s bib would be the obvious choice here. It’s aptly called “AMAZING” (CITE) for how amazing it is.] [But Garside isn’t so interested in the qualitative.] [He emphasizes “the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified”] [He’s interested in “the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers” (CITE)] [The key editorial intervention is the inclusion of contemporary reviews (also The notes include information about dedicatees, issue variations, subscription lists, included advertisements, subsequent editions, translations, and attributions?)] [Instead of Garside, I am using Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank.] [Both of these bibliographies are old and their basic title, publisher, etc, info is surely duplicated in Gardside] [But both also offer substantial qualitative descriptions of the works they list, including summaries of their contents.] [Ann Tracy indexes 208 works from the years 1753-1857, of which 103 are by female authors, 95 by male, and only 10 unknown.] [Frederick Frank indexes 499 works published in the years 1753 to 1835 (with one outlier by Beckford not published until 1912)]. [215 of Frank’s authors are female, 156 male, and 128 unknown.] [Because Frank does not include all of the works included by Tracy, only 178 works are indexed in both texts.] [Both show substantially higher counts of female authorship, and lower counts of anonymous authorship, than were typical of novels as a whole] [This might be selection bias or it might reflect more underlying reality than expected to the period’s assumption that women wrote Gothics; this paper won’t answer that question, but will statistically normalize raw book counts] [Transition sentence; reiterate the question I am trying to answer - did men and women write differently?]

## I'm modelling here ##

[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.][^cf5] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.][^cf6] [Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”][^cf7], a term for which Stephen Ramsay provides a useful definition:  “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates”[^cf8]. In other words, whether or not the model has revealed something we expected to see, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact corerspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle”[^cf9], and more of an imagined destination which spurs valuable journeys. [This allows us to cope with the fact that] as a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. No model needs to be accurate in all points, so long as it is sensitive to the desired area of differences. [Not all models are computational] the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text.[^cf10] As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Samuels and McGann, then, [embrace the reality of mental modeling]/[use these necessary models to their fullest extent] [by doing what McCarty calls “distortion”] [This is the source of my claim for continuity between what I do and what bibliographies do]

## Frank and Tracy are models ##

My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,”[^cf11] [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. [Although only 178 of Tracy’s 208 novels also appear among Frank’s 500 entries, the two usefully complement [/shed light on] each other.] The procedure of graphing each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct Male Gothic and Female Gothic modes.

## key findings up front: what I do ##

Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]

# Ann Tracy #

## Tracy values uniqueness ##

Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”[^cf12], who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of highly distinctive motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, she intentionally excluded the most popular motifs: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,”[^cf13] and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”.[^cf14] As a model of the Gothic, Tracy’s bibliography elides continuities to increase its sensitivity to points of difference. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — are thus constructed as the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.

## my model of Tracy ##

I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works.[^cf15] Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitative interpretation inherent in my framing of this question.[^cf16] An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs[^cf17] indicate a men’s Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.

## men's Gothic ##

Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror Gothic, as contrasted with the terror Gothic. Identifying the horror Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror Gothic writer. Together, these motifs point to a distinct men’s Gothic in the Lewisian horror tradition.

## subterranean passages ##

In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterranean passages and secret doors. But beyond Radcliffe, these tropes have been disproportionately adopted by men, not women. The critical emphasis on subterranean passages and caves as crucial Gothic tropes can likely be explained by who makes the “top 10” lists of their use:

Although neither motif appears widely throughout the Gothic, they repeat within the works of all four authors typically taken as the landmark writers of the genre: Walpole for the Gothic’s birth, Radcliffe and Lewis for its flourishing, and Maturin for its end. Anything prominently used by all four is surely ripe for closely-read comparison. But those comparisons illuminate more about the individual authors than the Gothic’s general usage; and, in the case of subterranean passages, they tell us more about Radcliffe than they do a women’s Gothic.

## women's Gothic ##

Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. Or, looking at their prominence in the top ten for each of these tropes, one might be tempted to investigate Regina Maria Roche and Louisa Sidney Stanhope as the unexpected representatives of the women’s Gothic. However, the paucity of female motifs suggests that defining a genre here may be too hasty. The male motifs represented a variety of elements used by many different men, such that no one author could be responsible for the patten being identified with his author. These female motifs are far less robust: if we ignore either Roche or Stanhope, we are down to just two female-dominated motifs, and if we ignore both, we are left with zero. When it comes to the inclusion of particular story elements, then, this women’s Gothic is outnumbered not just by the men’s Gothic but also by the mainstream Gothic.

## mainstream Gothic ##

More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. The neutrality of the most popular motifs is essentially a mathematical inevitability: nothing can achieve more than 50% popularity while being used by only 50% of authors. The Gothic mainstream must be defined by that which is available to all authors within the genre. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting (present in 77% of all novels), confinement (66% of novels), abduction (57%), references to suicide (47%), and storms (44%). Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows hints of a gendered divide.

## no binaries ##

This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men’s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women’s Gothic.

# Frederick Frank #

## Frank values context ##

[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception.[^cf18] Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for his 500 texts, Frank provides 309 unique classifications.[^cf19] [His “types” accord with Frow’s understanding of genre; it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses.] His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), connecting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traced systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. They are hardly even deterministic: The Mysteries of Ferney Castle is listed twice, once under each of its disputed authors, and receives a different Gothic type in each entry (“Pure or high Gothic (terror mode)” at entry 188 by Robert Huish, and “Gothified history (Radcliffean imitation)” at entry 222 by G. Lambe). Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.

## my model of Frank ##

Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag.[^cf20] This process generated 216 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. [My model [imposes a slightly more systematic ontology, treating each “tag” as informative on its own [regarding the horizon of critical expectations]] [but still preserves the possibility for things to overlap].] [I ask whether the association of this tag with a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author] [Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different modes], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Transition sentence: maybe that he shows a strong female gothic  but a more elusive male one?]

## women's Gothic ##

[In Frank’s model of the Gothic, it is the women’s Gothic which is most immediately visible.] [Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect.] [43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but those 43% are responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” works, and a striking 77% of the “sentimental.”] [Interestingly suggests that 18thC critics weren’t entirely wrong when they panicked about women writing sentimental novels] [Something about trusting Frank’s assessments??? Like maybe he thinks they’re sentimental bc he knows they’re by women???] [This women’s Gothic also does appear to be a “school of Radcliffe”.] [Frank is very interested in tracing the sources of various works, and identifies by name another author as a model or influence for 114 works (23%)]. [Of those 114 works, 58 have Radcliffe as their precedent (51% of works with a named source)] [After Radcliffe comes Lewis, with 13 imitators, then Walpole (12), Clara Reeve (6), and Charlotte Smith (5). [Radcliffe’s followers are disproportionately women (38 of the 58, 66%), and Lewis’s are disproportionately men (6 of the 13, 46% — well above the 31% male baseline in the corpus)] [This didn’t show up in Tracy because it doesn’t operate by identifiable motif (though it also doesn’t contradict Tracy)]

## men's Gothic ##

[A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model] [Like in Tracy’s the men’s tags are mostly visible among the tags which apply only to very few novels / make up a minor tradition.] [Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these] [But men actually outnumber women in the “Germanic” tag (which encompasses “German”, “Germanic”, “Schauerroman”, “Rauberroman”, and “Ritterroman”) — of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%).] [“Horror”, too, is disproportionately male — 42%, fairly above their baseline 31%, though not astonishing.] [As mentioned above, “Lewisite” is about the same.] [More strikingly male-dominated are two Gothic threads which would be completely invisible in Tracy’s motif-focused view: “polemical” and “prototypical” works.] [12 works are identified as “proto” or “early” forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%)] [Suggests a genre that has more masculine roots than it does a destination.] [A slightly larger group of works, 19 total, exists between the tags “polemical,” “philosophical,” “political,” and “radical/revolutionary” — of these 19, 13 are by men (68%)][The highest male percentage that applies to more than one work is for “polemical” Gothics, which fiercely flog some viewpoint or another: 83% of these six works are by men.] [This stands in contrast to “didactic”, also related, but 50% male and 50% female (12 didactic texts, 6 each)] [is this critical evaluation or a real difference????] [come to some kind of conclusion re: men’s Gothic]

## mainstream Gothic ##

[Frank’s mainstream is a little more female than Tracy’s.] [The two most prevalent tags are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have men women and unknown at almost perfectly their baselines] [But the third most prevalent tag is “terror” (34% of works), which is 50% female, a bit above the female baseline.] [The next two tags in prominence highlight Frank’s [embrace of multiplicity?]: “mode” (27%) and “elements” (27%), which generally appear as qualifiers for his other assessments, as in “terror mode” or “sentimental elements”.] [A lot of the tags have to do with Frank offering qualifications of some kind (mode, effects, Gothified, imitation).] [The Gothic is not monolithic; things mostly come from other places/ are interconnected] [Nothing for Frank is just one genre.] [Horror and terror, for example, are far from mutually exclusive] [Of the 56 “horror” works, 26 are also tagged “terror” (41%). [These 26 are 50% by men, making the horror-terror mode more predictive of male authorship than horror alone]] [Of the remaining 27 works which are purely horror, no terror, there are by by women, 9 by men, and 9 unknown — not a men’s horror Gothic at all.] [This is the reverse of Tracy — Tracy showed a male horror and equal-opportunity terror mainstream; Frank shows equal-opportunity horror, and female terror] [Between the two, the only part that’s consistent is that terror vastly outnumbers horror.] [There are gendered currents, but none of them are striking enough to start making predictions about the many unsigned works.]

# Conclusion #

## this CRIES OUT for correlation ##

[Obviously we need to correlate now] [It’s been a persistent problem/question whether Frank’s Gothic types were responding to actually gendered usage or imposing gendered interpretations] [With polemical vs didactic, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author’s gender] [But Tracy’s boolean motifs — although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly lacking/vague in interpretive detail — are at least safe from false positives] [We can evaluate the potentailly-gendered basis of Frank’s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag] [Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy’s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives] [But we can still hope for some true positives]

[^cf15]: Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts.

[^cf16]: I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually represent Tracy’s treatment of each motif as a self-contained field which may or may not have distinct divisions within it. The size of each circle reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two shades of gray in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages. I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose stark contrast nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif itself is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps, its chart doesn’t show two camps.

[^cf17]: I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.

[^cf18]: The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
	“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
	To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.

[^cf19]: Most of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.

[^cf20]: First, Frank’s phrases were split so that each word became one tag. Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “Pure”, “or”, “high”, “Gothic”, “terror”, “horror”, and “modes.” Then, irrelevant words were deleted, and synonymous ones combined. Frank always uses the phrase “Pure or high”, for example, so those were merged into “Pure;high”.

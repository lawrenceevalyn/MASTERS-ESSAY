# Abstract #

Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.

Reading Gender and Genre from a Distance: Detangling Binaries in the Eighteenth-Century Gothic

# introduction #

## lit review: female gothic ##

Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”[^cf1], to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”.[^cf2] Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [social] relationships to intertextual ones, as exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”.[^cf3] These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go back to the social reality of gender.]

## what I do ##

Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]

## can't ID a genre in isolation ##

My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”[^cf4]. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] 

## I'm modelling here ##

[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.][^cf5] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.][^cf6] [Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”][^cf7], a term for which Stephen Ramsay provides a useful definition:  “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates”[^cf8]. In other words, whether or not the model has revealed something we expected to see, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact corerspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle”[^cf9], and more of an imagined destination which spurs valuable journeys. [This allows us to cope with the fact that] as a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. No model needs to be accurate in all points, so long as it is sensitive to the desired area of differences.

## not all models are computational ##

[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.][^cf10] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text.[^cf11] As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Samuels and McGann, then, [embrace the reality of mental modeling]/[use these necessary models to their fullest extent] [by doing what McCarty calls “distortion”]

## Frank and Tracy are models ##

My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,”[^cf12] [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. [Although only 178 of Tracy’s 208 novels also appear among Frank’s 500 entries, the two usefully complement [/shed light on] each other.] The procedure of graphing each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct Male Gothic and Female Gothic modes.

## key findings up front ##

My findings:
- No male/female binary
- No horror/terror binary
- Sentimental geneaology, not German ghost stories

# Ann Tracy #

## Tracy values uniqueness ##

[First, let us examine Tracy’s model, as implicit in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”[^cf13], who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of distinctive individuals motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, the most popular motifs were intentionally excluded: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,”[^cf14] and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”.[^cf15] Tracy’s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — thus become the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.

## my model of Tracy ##

I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.][^cf16] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitivitity to [???] for sensitivity to [?????]] An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs[^cf17] indicate a Male Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.

## Male Gothic ##

Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.

## Female Gothic ##

In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who are using them.] Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a new Female Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, [whose] ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. However, [four is a small number, and unlike the wide-ranging male motifs which were well over the 60% line, it would only take a very few writers — or one domestic Ann Radcliffe — to produce these results]. The paucity of female motifs suggests that [seeing/defining a genre here] may be too hasty: this Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the [Shared??] Gothic.

## [Shared?] Gothic ##

More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. [This is basically mathematically inevitable, and points to the impossibility of a genre being one genre with two non-overlapping schools.] In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [Include percentage of total novels per motif.] Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows a gendered divide.

## no binaries ##

This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel]. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic.

# Frederick Frank #

## Frank values context ##

[Now let’s turn to a bibliography which models the Gothic with completely different priorities, and see how this model overlaps with Tracy’s / whether it shows similar male, female, and neutral Gothic schools.] [Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens.] His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception.[^cf18] Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for the 178 texts indexed by both authors, Frank provides 131 unique classifications.[^cf19] [His “types” accord with Frow’s understanding of genre; it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses.] His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), correcting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traces systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.


## my model of Frank ##

Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have sought to separate out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. The novel A Suffolk Tale, for example, listed in Frank as “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” becomes “domestic” and “Gothic elements.” Similarly, Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “high”, “Gothic”, “terror mode”, “horror mode”, and “Radcliffean.” This process generated 45 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two novels. [My model of the Gothic types, then, has X assumptions and priorities.] From there, my search for gendered types followed the same principles as my analysis of Tracy’s motif, asking, does the association of this tag with a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author? [Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question does not necessarily indicate that [women really did write in different moves], but instead means that the critical identification of this generic element is responding to authorial gender.] [Perhaps for that reason, Frank’s Gothic types do not point toward a clear Male Gothic tradition, but do show a Female Gothic.]

## Male Gothic ##

[In Tracy, the Male Gothic was a distinct [grouping] of what seem to be horror-Gothics, outnumbered by [the Shared Gothic].] [Frank does confirm the unbalanced nature of the terror/horror binary.] The terror mode enormously outnumbers the horror mode, with 62 novels (35% of the sample) tagged “terror” and only 24 (13%) tagged “horror.” The more-popular terror mode is non-gendered (53% female, 47% male), while the horror mode tends toward male authorship (62% male). However, of those 24 novels tagged as horror, 14 were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere 10 books are pure “horror mode.” If we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, seaparating out the “horror-terror” mixed-mode books as a third mode, our gendered expectations fall apart: the 10 pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors. Instead, it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship (71% male). [It seems, then, that although the relative prominence of the two modes accords with our expectations based on Tracy’s, the critical identification of terror and horror does not have a basis in gendered patterns of use. ???]

## [Shared?] Gothics ##

[All kinds of schools not often accorded central importance to the Gothic, but none of them dominate.] The eleven tags which correspond to at least nine novels and their respective prevalence, from most popular to least popular, are “high Gothic” (35%), “terror” (34%), “history” (16%), “domestic” (15%), “horror” (13%), “sentimental” (13%), “Radcliffean” (10%), “chapbook” (9%), “naturalized or explained” (6%), Schauerromantik (6%), and “Monk imitation / monastic shocker” (5%). Only “high Gothic” and “terror” apply to more than a quarter of the works. [Frank doesn’t really show a unified Gothic at all.] [But it’s mainly non-gendered, and definitely doesn’t operate by binaries.]

## Female Gothic ##

However, Frank’s model does point toward a [female] gendered tradition in Radcliffean and sentimental novels. Frank identifies twelve novels as explicit imitations of Radcliffe; the “Radcliffe” tag includes those twelve, and Radcliffe’s own six novels — and all eighteen are by women. Nearly as strongly predictive of female authorship is the “sentimental” tag (92% female). [Tracy’s model was not sensitive to these features because they are not defined by individual plot devices.] [By looking at which Gothic types go together, a Female Gothic emerges.] Approaching from one direction, half of the Radcliffean novels are also high Gothic. If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, a quarter of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean. If you know a book is sentimental, you know it is probably [????]. The Gothic types which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized or explained, and high Gothic, in that order.

# Sentimental geneaology #

## sentiment explains Simple Story ##

The picture which Frank’s model paints, of a Female Gothic equally as tied to the sentimental novel as to the high Gothic, [points toward a new understanding of the Gothic’s geneaology generally.] [This new sentimental geneaology makes some things about the Gothic more clear.] [A full acknowledgement of the Gothic’s sentimental ties can explain, for example, the comparison of Udolpho to Elizabeth Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzles Clara McIntyre in Ann Radcliffe in Relation To Her Time.] In response to a review which declared Udolpho to be “the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s Simple Story,” McIntyre is taken aback by the expression “of this kind”.[^cf20] She says, “The reviewer must surey be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.”[^cf21] McIntyre draws a tentative connection based on “the ethical purpose of the book,” which in Inchbald is “rather too obvious for successful art,” but decides that although Radcliffe’s writing, “it is true, was strictly moral,” Radcliffe’s “main interest” does not lie in moralizing.[^cf22] McIntyre has thus identified what I argue is the key connection between the two works, but overlooks its significance: moral sentiment, and its connection to the emotional experience of the reader, is the throughline which connects the Gothic deeply to its non-Gothic literary context, and to the broader intellectual debates at the end of the Englightenment.

## Baker: sentimental -> Gothic ##

I thus return to an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. Ernest Baker, for example, [tells this kind of history in his YEAR work TITLE:
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres[ Antres??? is this right?????? Lawrence Evalyn, 2017-04-18, 10:36 PM], castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbés novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance through its course. It was all derivative of the cult of emotion…[^cf23]
In this history of the Gothic, German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre:
Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appettites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors[.][^cf24]
The Gothic is well-established before the first hints of “German folk-lore”, which only arrives “later on” and only in the works of “those who had become acquainted” with it. Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of the central emotional experience of fear. Baker’s historical model is not sensitive to the features of the Gothic which now draw attention — he does not make his distinctions based on politics or aesthetics or gender — instead, he defines the Gothic by its emotional manipulations.

## the teleological model ##

Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. [Nonetheless, he writes on the basis of a model of the genre’s history / what’s important about it] The assumptions of his model, however, remain implicit in the moralizing judgments throughout his work. Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness,”[^cf25] for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful. J.M.S. Tompkins, too, dismisses the Gothic on the basis of these kinds of assumptions: with the rise of the Gothic, she says, “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probability, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern.”[^cf26] [We often talk about the “magic lantern” of the Gothic in positive terms, but Tompkins clearly sees this “slip[ping] farther away” as a problem.] Both Baker and Tompkins model the novel itsels as a training-ground for the mind, through which habits of thought are established, and which therefore ought to inculcate the “right” mode of thought. Accordingly, both model the Gothic as a dangerously emotional and disordered mode of thought, notable not for its plots or sets or even which emotions are induced, but defined entirely by the emotionally overpowering nature of the reading experience.

## reject teleology, keep emotion ##

I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: [its understanding of the Gothic as continuous, rather than a break]. [The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as] as spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by “intensification,” and not in terms of fundamental type.[^cf27] Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, “the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-tellers stock in trade.”[^cf28]  [The “fantastic” elements did not render the Gothic a fundamentally different sort of story than those which preceded it.] We can reject their realist teleology without rejecting their sensitivity to emotional response. Doing so allows us to better place the Gothic in context with other eighteenth century works, such that the Gothic participates directly in Englightenment conversations about human nature and rationality.

## holistic model of the Gothic ##

[^cf16]: Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts.

[^cf17]: I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.

[^cf18]: The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
	“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
	To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.

[^cf19]: Many of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.

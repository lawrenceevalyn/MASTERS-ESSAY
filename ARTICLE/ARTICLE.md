# Abstract #

Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.

Reading Gender and Genre from a Distance: Detangling Binaries in the Eighteenth-Century Gothic

# introduction #

## lit review: female gothic ##

Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”[^cf1], to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”.[^cf2] Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [social] relationships to intertextual ones, as exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”.[^cf3] These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go back to the social reality of gender.]

## what I do ##

Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]

## can't ID a genre in isolation ##

My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”[^cf4]. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] 

## I'm modelling here ##

[Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, I’m not doing “data visualization”, I’m modelling.] [Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”.][^cf5] [Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the [scholarly] process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and [narrativizing/imagining] information.][^cf6] [Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”][^cf7], a term for which Stephen Ramsay provides a useful definition:  “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates”[^cf8]. In other words, whether or not the model has revealed something we expected to see, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact corerspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle”[^cf9], and more of an imagined destination which spurs valuable journeys. [This allows us to cope with the fact that] as a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. No model needs to be accurate in all points, so long as it is sensitive to the desired area of differences.

## not all models are computational ##

[Not all models/experiments are computational]. Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s work on “deformance” highlights [[the intervention of interpretation?] that underlies all critical analysis.] [From X to “elaborate scholarly editions” and translations of texts, which write their critical interpretations into the texts themselves, Samuels and McGann argue, criticism is always deformative.][^cf10] Here Samuels and McGann find perhaps unexpected support in the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text.[^cf11] As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Samuels and McGann, then, [embrace the reality of mental modeling]/[use these necessary models to their fullest extent] [by doing what McCarty calls “distortion”]

## also need sensitive interpreters ##

[These non-computational models are important to remind us that it is not just the model which must be sensitive, but its interpreter.] Samuels and McGann ([[take this fact] as permission to]/[simply extend the accepted procedures of scholarly editions and translations, which write their critical interpretations into texts, when they]) radically rewrite the works they study — putting the lines of poems in reverse order, or deleting everything but the nouns — in quest of a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study. Their procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing”[^cf12] by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. This act of defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know”[^cf13], because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. [My computational models are partly anout the actual pieces of information I manipulate, but also partly about re-understanding the limits of our knowledge about the early Gothic.]

## Frank and Tracy are models ##

My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves deformative models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,”[^cf14] [the editorial processes behind each bibliography make] each model sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. [Although only X of Tracy’s Y novels also appear among Frank’s 500 entries, the two usefully complement [/shed light on] each other.] The procedure of graphing each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct Male Gothic and Female Gothic modes.

# Ann Tracy #

## Tracy values uniqueness ##

[First, let us examine Tracy’s model, as implicit in her ten-page ‘Index to Motifs’.] Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. It is clearly built for a different kind of scholarly use than that which I have made of it; it is intended for “scholars with particular interests”[^cf15], who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of distinctive individuals motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, the most popular motifs were intentionally excluded: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,”[^cf16] and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”.[^cf17] Tracy’s model of the Gothic is sensitive to uniqueness. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — thus become the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.

## my model of Tracy ##

I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. [I ask, does this model allow us to see a Female Gothic?] [More specifically, does the presence of any given motif in a work constitute meaningful information regarding the probable gender of its author?] [I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appeared in at least 20 of her 208 works.][^cf18] [My model is now far less useful for locating outlier texts for closer reading, but I have traded sensitivitity to [???] for sensitivity to [?????]] An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs[^cf19] indicate a Male Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.

## Male Gothic ##

Reading the motifs in order from most female-dominated to most male-fominated involves a constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror-Gothic, as contrasted with the terror-Gothic. Identifying the horror-Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror-Gothic writer.

## Female Gothic ##

In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. [Radcliffe’s six novels account for X of the secret doors written by women, X of the caves, and X of the subterranean passages] [So these certainly are Radcliffean elements, just not Female Gothic in terms of the other authors who are using them.] Instead, in this model of the genre, the Female Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a new Female Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, [whose] ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. However, [four is a small number, and unlike the wide-ranging male motifs which were well over the 60% line, it would only take a very few writers — or one domestic Ann Radcliffe — to produce these results]. The paucity of female motifs suggests that [seeing/defining a genre here] may be too hasty: this Female Gothic is outnumbered not just by the Male Gothic but also by the [Shared??] Gothic.

## [Shared?] Gothic ##

More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four — elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives — are even perfect ties. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. [This is basically mathematically inevitable, and points to the impossibility of a genre being one genre with two non-overlapping schools.] In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothis appear to be fainting, confinement, abduction, storms, and references to suicide. [Include percentage of total novels per motif.] Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows a gendered divide.

## no binaries ##

This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstread, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it, [and perhaps the slightests general tendency for women to write more domestic novel]. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a Male Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed Female Gothic.

[^cf18]: Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts.

[^cf19]: I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.

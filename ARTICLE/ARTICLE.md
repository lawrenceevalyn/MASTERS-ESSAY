# Abstract #

Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. The role of “authoress” may come with unique constraints, but the popular Gothic is not strongly divided by authorial gender. Continuities within the corpus suggest a revised geneaology of the Gothic, de-emphasizing German ghost stories in favour of the French sentimental novel.

Reading Gender and Genre from a Distance: Detangling Binaries in the Eighteenth-Century Gothic

# lit review: female gothic #

Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery [generally went hand-in-hand with dismissing the entire genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women.] In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”[^cf1], to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”.[^cf2] Contemporary critics, such as those collected in Diana Wallace and Andrew Smith’s Female Gothic: New Directions, have turned their attention from [social] relationships to intertextual ones, as exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”.[^cf3] These [observations] are finely-observed, but [too fine for me]. [I want to go back to the social reality of gender.]

# what I do #

Over the course of two literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binary, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]

# can't ID a genre in isolation #

My [work] to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [She was producing better Gothics, not a different kind of book entirely — quote someone; maybe Gamer? (Romantics later declare themselves a different kind of thing)] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”[^cf4]. [Genre is not a stable identifier but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.] [Accordingly, Radcliffe’s works cannot be identified as Gothic — or as Female Gothic — in isolation.] 

# my approach to experimentation #

My approach to literary experimentation is shaped by Willard McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling”, with influence from Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann’s discussion of “deformance”, to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty points to modeling as “a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world”[^cf5]. My spreadsheets and graphs of early Gothic novels thus constitute models [seeking to capture the genre as it was experienced by its popular readership]. 

# reasonable to think authoresses are different #

[As the name implies, the social role of the “authoress” was distinct from that of the “author”.] [Radcliffe, and many of her female peers, published as “Mrs Radcliffe” rather than using a first name, highlighting her gender of the title page.] [And of course, everybody else thought the genre was by and for women as well.]

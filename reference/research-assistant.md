## Ennis The Research Assistant

### Finding Full Texts

**11 August 2014**: agreed to rate of $1.50 per book for Ennis to download txt files & record sources for full texts.

**1 September 2014**: full texts are done! Ennis did:
* 40 to 150: 110 books
* 156 to 208: 52 books
Total: 162 books x $1.50 = **$243**
Lawrence will pay Ennis as soon as he's paid his tuition (just to make sure that check doesn't bounce)

**October**: agreed that, rather than having Lawrence pay Ennis now, the $243 will be deposited in the shared bank account once it exists in January.

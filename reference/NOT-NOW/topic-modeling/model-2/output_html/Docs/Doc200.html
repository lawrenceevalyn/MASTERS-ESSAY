A POLISH LEGENDARY ROMANCE

The interest in this novel lies less in the events than in the skill and anonymity of the villain who masterminds them. Leopold is raised as a peasant because his title and property have been usurped by Lafrance. He recovers his title and marries Rhodiska, whom Lafrance also desires. Their married life is marked by extraordinary persecutions. A letter tells Leopold that Rhodiska is unfaithful. They find a body hidden in a trunk in their house. Their crops are burned and their animals killed.

Hello everyone! My name is Lawrence Evalyn; I'm a graduate student at the University of Victoria, and I'm not quite good at titles yet -- on the program it says I'm here to talk to you about "Distant-Reading Gendered Gothic Motifs", but that's unforgivably vague. A more accurate title would be "Reading Metadata: Visualizing Gender Divides in the Gothic Novel 1790-1830." A catchier title would be "Reading Hundreds Of Books When You Don't Have Any Books: Some Pie Charts."

I want to start with some background on my research questions, and then spend the bulk of my time exploring the visualization of metadata as a research practice.

At the birth of the Gothic novel in the 1790s, the genre's position in the literary landscape was startlingly similar to that of modern-day romance novels. In particular, the Gothic novel was connected in the popular imagination with the emerging institution of the circulating library, a precursor to the modern public library which for the first time made it straightforward to readers to read books without having to purchase them. 

<!--Instead of purchasing a few novels and rereading them several times, readers began to borrow novels from subscription-based circulating libraries, read them voraciously once, and then return them for the next novel that looked like it offered a similar reading experience. The Gothic exploits this reading pattern by building novels around a central element of suspense, keeping readers turning the pages until they finally discover the dark secret at the end. What this means is that, when a reader finished with Ann Radcliffe's *Mysteries of Udolpho*, which has been receiving attention and praise from critics since the day it was published, that same reader would take volume three back to the library, pick out a new triple-decker Romance, and possibly start reading that same day a book like "Who's The Murderer?" or "There Is A Secret, Find It Out." So, I'm starting with the premise that, any time we attempt to define the 'normal' boundaries of the Gothic as a genre, we *have* to include "Horrid Mysteries" and "The Nuns of the Desert" and all of the other books which contributed to the genre directly alongside those texts which have since been canonized.-->

texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (John Frow, *Genre*, 2). 

My actual focus today is going to be on the experimental process I employed in order to [live up to] that premise, but

So, now I want to spend my remaining ten minutes telling you about how this pie chart came to be.
[Got my information from Tracy -- a process of taking information and rendering it digestible.]

Now that I finally have a pretty circle, it's definitely digestible -- which means I can move on to phase two. Phase two is iterating these first graphs several times, in order to make them actually accurate.

The first thing I noticed was that I'd color coded girls and boys with pink and blue, even though that's both historically inaccurate and ridiculous. I also noticed that the defaults were ugly, so I fixed those.

The second thing I noticed was that both circles were the same size, which makes them look equally important. I decided to make the box itself a fixed size, to indicate the possibility space of all 208 novels under consideration, and then to scale the charts themselves based on 

Then I started thinking about the fact that, if the motif is 50/50, there isn't actually a difference between books by men and books by women. The two colours make it look like there are two groups, which happen to be equally balanced, my question *is* whether there are two groups. [So I did the colours].

So, this, I think, is the ultimate proof that my visualization has taken the numbers in Tracy's index and transformed them into something that can form the valid basis of further reading: a lot of stuff that looked really promising now looks really boring.

[Some of the actually interesting results - subterranean passages]

These are all preliminary results, but the experimental process of prototyping and iterating was [good, and you should do it]. Thanks!



<!-- So, the first thing to talk about is why I am reading hundreds of books in the first place.

According to the information gathered by Peter Raven and James Garside, the number of new novels published in Britain each year rose from roughly twenty a year in the 1770s to roughly ninety a year in the 1790s

In response to this new torrent of novels, then, readers' expectations changed. -->

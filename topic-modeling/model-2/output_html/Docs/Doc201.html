A POLISH LEGENDARY ROMANCE

The interest in this novel lies less in the events than in the skill and anonymity of the villain who masterminds them. Leopold is raised as a peasant because his title and property have been usurped by Lafrance. He recovers his title and marries Rhodiska, whom Lafrance also desires.

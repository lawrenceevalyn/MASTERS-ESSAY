A ROMANCE 

Henry the foundling is informed that his foster sister Matilda, whom he fancies, is his real sister; their father has been murdered for his estate by their stepfather (who is also their uncle). Wishing to escape this awkward situation Henry goes to join the army but is captured en route by Italian banditti. During his escape from them he finds his father alive and discovers that Matilda is really the banditti captain's daughter, substituted for a stillborn child of his mother's.

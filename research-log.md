Opening paragraph:
Scholarly discussions of subgenres within early Gothic novel typically focus on the stylistics of horror versus terror. However, when I examine the popular gothic at scale, these two modes collapse into each other, the differences between them eclipsed by those between the High Gothic and the sentimental Gothic. Correlating Frederick Frank's genre classifications of 208 Gothic novels with Ann Tracy's index of motifs contained within them, I will argue for a revival of a much earlier critical framework which traces the Gothic's origins directly to the sentimental novel. 

Outline for rest of paper:
-- really don't see horror vs. terror: Frank's subjective Gothic types struggle to decide between them, and his ultimate choices don't seem to be based in any motifs. (This makes sense, since horror/terror is all about *how* something is included, not *what* is included.)
-- but this does not mean no distinctions are visible at this scale: the domestic/sentimental novel is strikingly distinct, defined (with a few exceptions) by its lack of most (high) Gothic motifs
-- previous criticism about the sentimental Gothic says [x]
-- my model suggests [y] (notice the dueling!) --> really want to dig into the details here to show how reframing the Gothic conversation around the sentimental opens up useful new readings.
-- maybe end with a close reading of a sentimental novel? or sentimental elements in a traditional Gothic novel?

Criticism to read:
* ernest baker, history of the english novel
* clara macintyre
* enid railo, the haunted castle: a study of english romanticism
* J M S thompkins the popular novel in england

Novels to read:
* Charlotte Dacre's sentimental ones -- Libertine & Passions
* Charles Maturin's Wild Irish Boy??
* Clara Reeve - anything but Old English Baron
* Regina Maria Roche - anything but Clermont
* Mary Shelley - Lodore
* Charlotte Smith - Marchmont

(interesting that many 'big name' Gothic writers also have sentimental/domestic novels under their belts which we largely don't read or discuss!)

crossdressing - definitive of history genre

inquisition over time

make a database? **

dueling - a lot of dueling; seen as a feudal/aristocratic tradition - gentlemanly honor is above the law
more prevalent in domestic/sentimental - because they include aristocrats and matters of honor, very invested in clash between aristocracy and middle class
Richard Cronen - Paper Pellets : journalists duel over reviews

My actual research feels like a way to find answers, but it's really a way to find useful questions

More orphans in domestic/sentimental; name number of noble peasant & orphan in High Gothic: suggests that basic trope of High Gothic is the foundling (about the question of legitimacy, noble blood), but domestic/sentimental detaches the orphan from this plot * (who has the first noble peasant? - Walpole, from Shakespeare)

Is there non-familial murder? Did she not index it because it wasn't turning up?

* Which is the first High Gothic with poison? --> next time; very widespread sensationalist poisonings in France
Udolpho poisoning is even more interesting if she's the first to use the motif, because Emily's assistant is named after a famous poisoner

Goal for next meeting: start drafting the argument

## 22 November 2014

Condensed all High Gothic types to High Gothic; condensed Domestic and Sentimental to Domestic/Sentimental; for Natural Horror, identified with next most appropriate category; for others, condensed to Other Gothic; deleted types for ANECDOTES OF TWO WELL-KNOWN FAMILIES (Parody), THE MARCHIONESS!!! OR, "THE MATURED ENCHANTRESS" (Parody) and THE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM (Picaresque) for being non-Gothic.

Condensed Political/Philosophical into Other Gothic because there were only 5.

## 13 November 2014

Potential structure for essay: models of the early gothic: Tracy's model; Frank's model; combined model; initial notes on what a model made of full text would look like; strengths and limitations of each model, implications.

## 11 November 2014

Eek, since the last log update I have:

Last meeting (Nov 4), typed up Frank's Gothic Types for all 208 of Tracy's that he included in his own index. Found that he had WAY TOO MANY types; condensed them somewhat in a "main type" column.

Initial findings: Domestic & Sentimental are strongly female-dominated, none of the others are male-dominated. Main chunks of the pie are Chapbook, Domestic, High Gothic, High Gothic (terror), History, and Sentimental.

This week, started smashing the Gothic Types into Tracy's motifs. Pie charts are no good, but bar graphs seem promising -- in particular, history and the various High Gothics all seem to look similar, with domestic/sentimental identifiable in their *lack* of various motifs (e.g., murder).

Potential structure of essay: Driving question is 'what categories usefully distinguish among these texts?' First attempt, gender: do seem to see a male tradition. Resulting assumption: male/horror holds, but terror is the norm and thus not female. Second attempt, genre: now there's no male tradition, but there is a female one. Resulting assumption: horror/terror no longer holds, but male/female might. Final conclusion: critical conversation should return to a consideration of the domestic/sentimental in the Gothic, because this is the framework best supported by the data.

## 4 November 2014

Notes to follow up on from meeting with Dr Miles--

ernest baker, history of the english novel
clara macintyre
enid railo, the haunted castle: a study of english romanticism
J M S thompkins the popular novel in england
1920s criticism - approached gothic as an offshoot of sentimental fiction prior to David Punter

useful work for classifying things - m hadley
the undiscovered genre: a search for the german gothic novel -- argument: such rapid interchange, you can't identify where things start or who's to blame for what

## 17 October 2014

Brought all the keywords to Dr Miles on Oct 8 -- rapidly became clear that BNC isn't a suitable corpus, because it singles out "upon" as the most statistically significant word, but a quick look at google n-grams shows that this is almost certainly a chronological trend. Need an 18th century corpus; ECCO would be perfect, if only they would give it to me.

I think it's time to go back to the counting-and-making-graphs stage of things: Frederick Frank's "gothic type" designations, and the epigraph/chapter information I was going to track manually. If only that didn't seem so *tedious*.

## 30 September 2014

Removed the problematic BE and HAVE entries from the lemma list, re-ran the wordlists for m and f summaries, also did wordlists for Udolpho and Monk. May actually NOT remove character names/ titles/ etc because they are making some interesting appearances on the summaries wordlists.

---

Got started with WordSmith Tools!

Wanted to do some keyword analysis but the reference corpuses aren't available freely; sent requests for BNC and a Canadian corpus.

Did some wordlists in the mean time. Found stoplists and lemma lists online, but couldn't figure out how to remove BE and HAVE; the stoplist wasn't catching them. (Maybe remove them from the lemma list? Later-- gee, it's annoying that I have to switch to Windows to run this software.)

Definitely need to go through that stoplist again to remove, for example, "de" and "st".

Is there some way to know whether the differences actually... matter? Statistically speaking?

## 16 September 2014

Met with Dr Miles; set next meeting for Sept 30. Goal for this term: acquire, and write up, *all* data intended to be used in the essay.

Set up the spreadsheet to record bibliographical data: pages and chapters per volume (recorded and actual), to calculate pages per chapter, and the presence of epigraphs. If it comes up (hasn't yet), a 'y' will only be recorded for epigraphs if they continue beyond the first chapter.

Current research fear: the keyword frequency techniques I'm currently interested in are best-suited for studies of stylistics, which are absurd to attempt on Tracy's summaries. But I'm not convinced that topic modeling will be *more* relevant.

It's important to stick to testing specific hypothesis... with the summaries, my null hypothesis is that men's books and women's books are about roughly the same kinds of things, so they'll be characterized by similar keywords. (Is that the right use of 'null hypothesis'?) If they produce basically similar keyword lists, I'll note it briefly, note that it might also reflect the obvious limits of my use of summaries-as-proxy, and then move on to whatever was more fruitful.

## 15 September 2014

Updated to-do list in preparation for meeting with Dr Miles. Current plan: no topic modeling, because there just doesn't seem to be any reason for it. Instead, a variety of frquency-based analyses, looking for evidence of gendered difference, first in plot summaries and then in *Udolpho* vs. *Monk*.

## 1 September 2014

Full texts are done!! 162 of 208 exist in some kind of digital form; of those, 7 are human-corrected OCR, 115 are horrid OCR, and 40 are PDFs.

## 26 August 2014

Realised that University of Illinois has some great digitized texts that I have access to despite their not appearing in UVic's catalogue; at book 147, started searching it, too. http://quest.library.illinois.edu/illinoisharvest/

## 21 August 2014

Really, I'm interested in how Radcliffe's rationalizing conclusions compare to her imitators. Are other explanations more plausible, more detailed? Less? How many forgo the explanation altogether?

Maybe I could read just the last chapters of a wide range of books, to see what kinds of explanations they offer. Or I think Tracy usually specifies if things are explained in the end?

## 17 August 2014

Started gathering less-concrete setting data in addition-- so, now 'Place' and 'Year' include all locations and centuries definitively indicated by Tracy; 'Area' is an adjective based on the 'feel' of the story and especially the characters' names; and 'Era' is either 'past' (potentially with some elaboration) or 'contemporary', based on the plot structure and especially the presence of noble castle-owners.

## 14 August 2014

JUST found out about the Oxford Text Archive (!!!) - knew I should have been doing more reading of other work to this point! But it looks like it's only going to have a very few texts, alas.

## 12 August 2014

Should have noted yesterday -- in fine Academic Spouse tradition, Ennis will be taking over the acquisition of OCR full texts, following the procedure described Aug 7 (minus acquisition of PDFs), for $1.50 per book. The relief from burnout is *incredible*. If things resolve satisfactorily for both, may hire zir to re-OCR from PDFs? But first will see what results can be extracted from the corpus as it exists.

## 7 August 2014

Just a note on how I'm sourcing books now-- I copy-paste the title from my spreadsheet into UVic's search system, and into a books.google.com search that only shows 'full view' results. I download the NCCO OCR (if it exists) and any PDF versions UVic provides that look like they're better scans than the Corvey microfilm. I make a note of all google editions, in case I want to rip them later. It goes pretty quickly!

So far it looks like accessibility skews firmly in favour of novels, and away from weird-man chapbooks.

## 4 August 2014

Realizing that google OCR is much, much better than NCCO, probably due to quality of PDFs? Definitely thinking that re-OCR-ing from pdfs is going to be my best bet. Not sure about copyright status of google books? Have to research whether I can extract PDFs (or, please, heaven, please!) txt files *without* breaking DRM.

It does look like, with NCCO Corvey as a back up, a lot more of these are available than I thought. I expect I'll have 150 to 200 in the end!

## 3 August 2014

Very annoyed to discover that #101, TALES OF TERROR, is in *verse*! **Verse!!** Not a novel at all! And this on top of, apparently, not really being written by Matthew Lewis.

Unsure how to proceed-- wish I could just strike through the text; maybe hide the row?

## 30 July 2014

Research ideas jotted on sticky notes in my room:
* Why is there so little cannibalism in the Gothic?
* Could find average chapter length of each book by skipping to the end, seeing what number the last chapter was, and dividing the page numbers by that
    - add no. of pages & no. of chapters to spreadsheet
* Can find all character names by extracting all capitalized words, discarding duplicates, manually discarding non-names.
    - What about two-word name combos? i.e., Lord O'Sinister. Just discard titles & work with, e.g., O'Sinister?

## 27 July 2014

Decided that, if full texts are available as pdfs from sources other than NCCO (i.e., if pdfs of halfway adequate quality are available), I should snag those and run my own ocr on them. Asked mum for ocr recommendations.

## 26 July 2014

Started tracking down full texts of Tracy's novels:
- If multiple e-texts are available, choose the one with the best OCR that still appears to follow the original text. Then manually delete any paratextual information that would not have been included in the original.
- Paratextual information that *was* in the original-- including running titles/chapter headings, indexes, notes, etc-- shall remain.

(Huh, it would be super interesting to algorithmically extract just the poems, quotes, and epigraphs in all these works... but probably easier to do it as a human.)

**Should I use my Gothic 'canon' as training texts to identify the topics?** Or will this make it impossible to identify when books diverge interestingly from that canon?

## 22 July 2014

Right now entering only setting information that is unambiguous, based on mentions of dates or places.

Most info is less certain, however. Perhaps add era categories of 'the past' and 'the present'? And place categories of 'Italian' when going based on names?

Decided to mark time periods based on the main tale, rather than the frame narrative, where such frames exist.

## 20 July 2014

Suggestions from mom:
- use ls* and redirect to filenames.text to get names for program to run
- if I can write the program so I say 'run program.py on file.txt' then I can write a shell script that can just call that program through every file (a shell script is just a file of shell commands-- )

## 15 July 2014

Starting poking around with topic modeling.
- model-2 is now 100 topics, 15 topic words, 600 iterations.
- model-3 is now 50 topics, 15 topic words, 600 iterations.
- model-4 is now 15 topics, 15 topic words, 600 iterations.

Tried to make network maps of any of these with Gephi, had no idea what I was doing, accumulated more readings to-do.

## 10 July 2014
correctOCR.py now executes all seven cleanup steps listed below. To-do list updated with next goal: scale program to multiple files.

Right now multi-volume works have a txt file per volume. Is that what I want? If not, it's probably not worth writing a program to merge them, can just do it with Automator.

## 7 July 2014
### Experimenting with cleaning OCR of full texts
Tried these out manually, started poking with python to do it.

#### Steps to be applied to all book files to ameliorate, as much as possible, the horrid OCR.

1. Delete disclaimer at top of each file.
    - "Disclaimer: This file is generated from OCR (optical character recognition), which is a technology that converts images of text into text. While the technology is good at deciphering legible text, there are limitations and some text may not have been extracted correctly."
2. Find "¬ " and replace with nothing.
3. Find "- " and replace with nothing.
4. For the digits 0 to 9, find "# " and replace with nothing.
5. For the digits 0 to 9, find "#" and replace with nothing.
6. For the following symbols, find and replace with nothing.
    - *
    - •
    - ■
    - ^
    - >
    - <
    - ~
    - %
    - \
    - /
7. Find "vv" and replace with "w".

#### Steps to consider?
- Maybe remove the word "chapter"? And "vol"/"volume"?
- Maybe remove punctuation marks? Or put spaces in front of them, so if there are words affiliated with exclamation marks/ other interesting punctuation marks, that can count.
- *Is there a way to remove line breaks systematically?*
- Is there a way to remove roman numerals? (Probably not without ruining some words...)
- *Is there a way to just say 'remove everything that isn't a letter'?* If so, run it **after** steps 1 and 2, for which the removal of the space is important.
- Do I want to remove hyphens that don't have spaces after them? If so, probably replace with a space?

## 29 June 2014
FULL TEXTS! FULL TEXTS!! FULL TEXTS!!!
This changes everything! Eventually. The OCR is... horrid.
So, the plan is still to read up on topic modelling while running tests on the plot summaries, and *then* forming a plan regarding which full texts (and how many) to clean up. (Prooobably time to check in with Dr. Miles, too.)

## 24 June 2014
Running it with exactly two topics is *extremely* exciting at first glance, usually dividing them immediately into "mother" and "father" topics. Slightly perplexing that this is not universal, though, and that the rest of the topics are often a bit mystifying.
* model-1 is two topics, 20 words per topic, 500 iterations

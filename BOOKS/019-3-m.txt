SALATHIĽL
CHAPTER I. The evening came at last» the burning calm was followed by a breeze breathing of hie, and ou the sky sailed, as if it were wafted by that gentle breeze, the evening star. The lifeless silence of the desert begau to be broken by α vanetj of sounds, wild and sad enough in them¬ selves, but softenmg by distance, and not ill suited to that declining hour, which is so natural an emblem of the decline of life The moaning ot the shepherds hom, the low ot \OL IU, A
ihe iolding heitls, the long, deei) cry oí the tainei, even the scream of the vulture wheel¬ ing home fiom the corpse leit by some leeent wreck on the shore, and the howl of the jackall venturing out on the edge of dusk, came with no unpleasing mêlant holy upon the wind We stood gazing impatiently from the tent door at the w est, that still glowed like α furnace of molten gold " Will that sun never go down' said I " We must wait his leisure, antl he seems de¬ termined to tantalize us " "Yes, like a rich old man, deteimined to try the patience oí his heirs, and more tenacious of Ins wealth, ihe more his powers of enjoyment decay." " Philosophy, from those young lips 1 Yet, the desert is the place for a philosopher " " That I deny," said my sportive com¬ panion " Phi'osophy is good for nothing, where it has nothmg to ridicule, and where it will be neither fed nor flattered Its true place is the w orld , as much as the true place
of yonder falcon ıs wherever it can find any thing to pounce upon Here your philosopher must libour for himself, and laugh at bimself, an indulgence in which he is the most tern perate of men In short, he is fit only for the idle gay, ridiculous, and timid world Г' e desert is the soil for а much noblei plant If you would train a poet into flower, set him liere " " Or a plunderer ' " No doubt —They are sometimes much the " But the desert produces nothing—but Arabs " *' There are some mmds even among Arabs and some of their rhapsodies are beauty itself The very master of this tent, who fought and killed, 1 dare not say how many, to secure so precious a prize as myself, and who, after all his heroism, would have sold me into slavery for life, spent half his evenings sitting at this door, chanting to every star of heaven, and rhyming, with tears in his eyes, to all kinds of tender remembrances."
" But he was a genius, a hea\en born acci¬ dent , and his merit was the moie m being a genius in the midst of such α scene ' " 14 о —every thing round us this hour is poetry The silence—those broken sounds that make the silence moie striking as they decay— those fiery continents of cloud, the empire oi that gieatest of sheiks the sun, lord of the red desert of the air—the immeasurable desert be low ' Vastness, obscurity, and terror, the throe ¡»pints that work the profoundest wonders of the poet, are heie in their native rtgion And now," she said, with а look that showed there were other spells than poetry to be found m the desert, " to release you, I know bv signs infallible that the sun is setting ' I could not avoid laughing at the mimic \ubdom with which she announced her dis co\er\, and asked whence she had acquired the ficulty of solving such raie problems " Oh, by my ncomparable knowledge of the stars She pointed to the eastern sky, on which they began to cluster in showeis of diamond " I ha\e to thank the desert for it,

with marriage You, of course, finding that you had nothing to prevent your leaving the desert, took the female resolution of staving in xt, and, as you might discard the young »heik at your pleasure, refused to have any other human being " " Can you think me capable of such a horror' She stamped her little foot in indignation on the ground, then turning on me with her flash ing eye, penetrated the ptratagem at once by my smile " Then, hear the rest I mounted my dromedary, galloped for three days without sleep, and, at length, saw the towers of Jerusa lem —glorious Jerusalem I passed through crowds that seemed to me a gathering of the world, streets that astonished me with a thou sand strange sight', and, overwhelmed with magnificence, delight, and fatigue, arrived at a palace, where I was met by a host of half adoring domestics, and was led to the most venerable and beloved of wise and holy men, who caught me to his heart, called me Naomi,

" Forbid it, the spirit of romance 1 must see whether the gallantry of the sheik lias not provided against that misfortune " She flew into the tent, and, drawing back a curtun, showed me two mares of the most famous breed of Arabia " Here are the Koshlam, said she, with playful malice dancing in her eyes " I saw them brought ш in triumph last night, stolen from the pastures of Acbmet ben Ah himself, first horse stealer and prince of the Bedoweens, who is doubtless by this time half dead of grief at the loss of the two gems of his stud I heard the achievement told with great rejoicing 1 ·, and a very curious specimen of dexterity it was Come forth," said she, leading out two heauti ful animals, white as milk " Come forth, you two lovely 01 phans of the true breed of Solo mon ,—pnncesses with pedigrees that put kings to shame, unless they can go back two thousand years, birds of the Bedoween, with wings to your feet, stars for eyes, and ten times *he sense of your masters, m your little tossing heads "

CHAPTER II I üiRECTFD our flight toward Masada The star, were brilliant guitlea ind the cool ness of the Arabian night which forms so singular a contrast to the overpowering ardours of the day relieved us from the chief obstacle ol desert travel At day break we reached a tract near the sei shore whose broken and burnt up ground showed that there had lately encamped the army the sound of whose march filled my reveries in the isi md It was evening when I caught the ghmpse o f the distant mountain of the fortress My heart bounded fearfully at the sight An im pression of evil was upon me Yet I must go on, or die
" There said I, " you ste my home, and yours while you desire it You will find fr ends, delighted to receive you, and a protection that neither Rom in nor Arab can violate Heaven grant th it all may be as when I leit Masada' The fur gnl gratefully thanked me " I have been long, said sue, ' unused to kindness and its voice overpowers me But if the duty, the gratitude, the f uthful devoted ness of the orphan to her generous preserver, can deserve protection, I si all yet have ьогае claim Suffer me to be your daugb*er She bowed her head before me with filial reverence, I took the outstretched hand, that quivered in mine, anu pressed it to my lips The sacred compact was ratified in the sight of Heaven More formal treaties have been made, but few sincerer We rapidly advanced to the foot of the ridge that, now defining and extending, showed its well known features in their rugged gran deur But, to come in sight of the fortress, I bad still one of the huge buttresses of the mountain to round My companion, with the
quick sympathy that makes one of the finest charms of woman already shared ш my omi nous fears, and rode by my side without a word My eyes were fixed on the ground —I was roused by a clash of warlike n tisíc The sus pense was terribly at an end The spears of а legion were moving ш а glittering line down the further declivity Squadions of horse m marching order were drawi up on the plain The baggage of a little army I iy under tho eye w uting for the escort of the troops now descendmg from the fortress The story of my ruin was told in tint single glance All was lost The walls of the citadel, brf tched in every direction gave signs of a long siege The "White Stag of Naphtah no longer lifted its head in pride on the battlements disman thug and desolation were there But what horrors must have been wrought, before the Romans could shake the strength of those walls 1 In what grave was I to look for my noble brother and my kinsmen ? Last and most
fearful whit hul b en the fate of Minam and my children ' Conscious that to stay was to give myself and my trembling companion to the cruel mercy of Romt· I yet was unable to leive tbe spot I holered round it as the spirit might hovei round the tomb Maddening with bitter yearn ings of heart that intense eagerness to know the worst which is next to despair I spurred up the steep by an obscure path that led me to а postern There was no sound within I dashed thiough the streets Not a living being was to be seen, piles of fire wood lighted under ine principal buildings and at the gates, showed that the fortress was tkstined to imme diate overthrow War had done its worst The broad sanguine plashes on the pavements showed that the battle had been fought long and desperately within the walls The f imous armoury was a heap of ashes Ditches dug across the streets and strewed with broken weapons, and the white remnants of what once
was man walls råisen within walls and now broken down stately houses loop holed and turned mto little fortresses fragments of noble architecture blocking up tbe breaches graves dug m every spot where the spade could open a few feet of ground frigmenL of superb fur niture lying half burnt where the defender ad be n forced out by conflagration gave sad evidence of the struggle of brave men agunst overpowering numbers But where were they who had made tl e prize so dear to the conquerors Ί Was I tread ing on the clay that once breathed patriotism and love' Did the wreck on which I leaned as I gazed round this mighty mausoleum cover the earthly tenement of my kinsmen and still dearer the last of my name ? Was I treading on the grave of those gentle and lovely natures for whose happiness I would rejoicingly ц ауе laid down the scept e of the world ? In my agitation I spoke aloud My voice rang through the solitude round me and re turned on the ear with a startling distinctness Living sounds suddenly mingled with the echo
A low groan came from the pile of ruins beside me I listened, as one might listen for an answ er from the sepulchre The voice was heard agam. A few stones from the shattered wall gave way, and I saw thrust out the withered, bony hand of а human being. I tore down the remammg impediments, and saw, pale, emaciated, and af the point of death by famine, my friend, my fellow soldier, my fellow-sufferer, Jubal ' Joy is sometimes as dangerous as sorrow. He gave a glance of recognition, struggled foi- ward, and, uttering a wild cry, fell senseless mto my arras. On hts recovering, before I could ask him the question ne trest to my heart, it was answered. " They are safe, all safe,' snid he. " On the landing of fresh troops from Italy, the first efforts of the legions were di¬ rected against this fortress The pirates, in return for the victory to which you led them, had set me at liberty I made my way through the enemy*s posts , Eleazar, ever generous and noble, received mo after all my wanderings with the heart of a father, and we determined on defending this glorious trophy of your he-
roism to the last man. But, with the wisdom that never failed him, he knew what must be the result, and at the very commencement of the siege sent away your family to Alexandnu, where they might be secure of f rotection from our kindred." " And they went by sea'" I asked shudder- ïngly, while the whole terrible truth dawned upon my mind " It was the only course. The country was filled with the enemy." " Then they are lost ' Wretched father, now no father Man maiked by destiny. The blow r has fallen at last Tbey perished. I saw than perish. Their dying shrieks rang in these ears. I was their destroyer From first to last, I have been their undoing ' ' Jubal looked on me with astonishment My adopted daughter, without any idle attempt at consolation, only bathed my hand in her tears. " There must he some misconception here," said Jubal " Before we left that accursed dungeon, they had embarked with a crowd of females from the surrounding country in one of
the annual fleets for Egypt Before we sailed from the pirate's cavern, they were probably sate in Alexandria" "No' I saw them perish I heard their dying cry I drove them, involuntarily but surely drove them, to destruction," was the only voice that my withering bps could utter I remem¬ bered the horrors of the storm, the desperate efforts of the merchant galley io escape, its fatal disappearance. Faintly, and with many л reviving agony, ï g&ŕe the melancholy reasons for my belief. My auditors listened with fear and trembling " There is now no use in sorrow," said J ubai sternly, " and as little m struggle I too have lived till the light that hghtmed my dreary hours is extinguished 1 have known the ex¬ tremities of passion. If suffering could have atoned for my offences, I have suffered A thousand years of existence could not teach me more Here let us die " He unsheathed his poniard. " Here let us die 1 " I exclaimed with him, and my pormrd glittered in mv hand.
My young companion, in the anxiety of the moment, forgetting the presence of a stranger, flung back the veil which had hitherto covered her face and figure, and clasping my half raised mn, said in a tone, so lov , yet penetrating, that it seemed the whispers of my own con science— " Has death no fears'" She fixed her ejes on me, and waited breathless for the answer " Daughter of beauty, said Jubal, as a smile of admiration played on his sad features, ' thoughts like ours are not for the lovely and the young May the Heaven that has stamped that countenance be your protection through many a year ' But, to the eary, rest is happi uess, not terror Prince of Naphtah, this fair maidens presence forbids darker thoughts, we must speed her on her way to security, before we can think of ourselves and our misfortunes " The daughter of Anauus," «aid she, ш а lone of heroic pride, " has no fears The boldest w amor of Israel never died more boldly than that venerable parent Within his sacred robes there was the heart of a soldier, a patriot,
and а king Let me die for а cause like his, at the foot of the altar, let, my blood be poured out for my country, let this feeble form sink in the ruins of the Temple, and death will be of all welcome things the most welcome But I would not die for a fantasy, for idleness, for noth ng, put up those weapons, warriors, and let us go forth and see whether great things are not yet to be done " She bignificantly pointed towards Jerusalem " It is too late, said Jubal, glancing with a sigh at his own wasted form " What ? said the heroine, " is it too late to be virtuous, but not too late to be guilty, too late to resist the enemies of our country, but not too late to make ourselves worthless to her holy cause 7 If Heaven demands en ac count of every wasted talent, and mispent hour, what feurtul account wilt be theirs who make all talents, and all hours, useless at a blow ' ' " Maiden, \ou have not known what it is to lose every thing that made earth a place of hope," said I, gazing with wonder and pity on the fine enthusiasm that the world is so fatally
empowered to destroy " May not the tired traveller hasten to the *»nd of his journey with out a crime ? " May not the slave/ said Jubal, "weary of his chain, escape unchidden from hu? captivity 7 " And may not the soldier quit his post, when caprice disgusts him with his duty 7 was ťie maiden s answer, with a lofty 'ook " Or may not the child break loose from the place of instruction, and plead bis d sgust at discipline ? As well may man, placed heie for the service of the highest and most benevolent of beings, plead his own narrow and ignorant will against the supreme command, daringly charge Hea¬ ven with the injustice of setting him α task ahove his strength, and madly insult its power under the hollow pretext of relying on its com¬ passion —This wisdom is not my own It was the last gift of an illustrious parent, when, ш my agony at the sight of his mortal wounds, I longed to follow him " Live, ' said he, " while you can live with virtue The God who has placed us on earth, best knows when and how to recall us If self destruction were uo cnme
ш one instance, it would be no crime to uni versal mankiud, the whole frame of society would be overthrown by a penmssion to evade its duties on the easy penalty of dymg Our obligations to country, family, man, and Hea ven, would be perpetually flung off, if thev were to be held at the caprice of human in sensibility Jubal looked intently on the young oracle and, bending with oriental deference, was yet unconvinced " Man was no* made to endure, wh^n endurance is useless Is there to be no end to the mind s anxiety, but the tardy decay of the frame ? Is there no tune for the return of the exile ? or, what is this very feeling of despan, but a voice within—an unwritten com mand to die ' Naomi turned to me, with a look imploring my aid But ΐ was broken down with the tidings that had just reached me Jubal wrapped his cloak round him and was striding into the shadow of the ruin Naomi, terrified at the idea of death, seized the corner of his mantle Will you shrink from the evils of
hfe ? ' she adjured, "and yet have the dreadful courage to defy tbe wrath of Heaven ? Shall worms like us, shall creatures covered with weaknesses and sins, wboee only hope must be m mercy, commit a crime that by its very nature disclaims supplication, and make., repentance impossible ' ' With the energy of fear, she threw back the folds of the cloak, and arrested the hand, with the digger already unsheathed in it She led back the reluctant, yet unresisting step of the suicide, and said, in a voice still trembling " Pnnce of Naphtah, save your brother." I held out my arms to Jubal, the sternness of his soul was past, and Se fell upon my neck Na orni stood, exulting in her trmmph, with the countenance that an angel might wear at the return of a sinner "Pnnce of Naphtah," said she, "if those who wen dear to you have perished, which Heaven avert' you may have been thus but the more marked out for the instrument of solemn uses to Israel The virtues that might have languished in the happiness of home, may be vol in a
summoned into vigour for mankind Wur nor, and she turned her glowing smile on Ju bal, " this is not the time for valour and ex penence to shrink from the side of our country Faction may be repelled by patriotism violence put down by wisdom , the powers of the people rousri by the example of a hero even the lust spaik of life may be made splendid by mingling with the last glones of tbe chosen people ot God Jubal β wasted cheek reddened with the theme but bis emotion was too deep for language he led tbe way , we passed in silence through the silent streets, and, without seeing the face of ι human being, reached the dismantled gates of Masada
CH\PTER III. Jubal guided us down the declivities among ramparts and trenches, and after long windings, where every step reminded us of havoc, brought us to a httle hamlet m the recesses of the val¬ ley, so secluded, that it seemed never to hav с heard the sound of war. The thunder of the falling masses of fortifi¬ cation as the fire reached their props, awoke me soon after midnight, and I arose and tasted the delicious air that makes the summer night of Asia the time of refreshing alike to the frame and to the mind I found Jubal already abroad, and gazing on the summit of the mountain, where the sullen glare of the sky, and the crash
of buildings showed that the work of devasta tion was rapidly going on, He gave me some of the details of the siege The Rom uıs had found the fortress so hazard ous to tht advance of their rei u forcements, that its possession was essential to the conquest of Judea Cestius, my old antagonist, solicited the command, to wipe off his disgrace , and the whole force of the legions was brought up Bnt the generalship of Eleazar, and the intrepidity of the garrison baffled every assault, with tre mendous loss to the enemy. The siege was next turned into а blockade Famine and dis ease were more formidable than the sword, and tlie brave defenders weie reduced to α number scarcely able to man the walls " We now, ' said Jubal, " fought the battle of despair we saw the enemy s camp crowded every day with fresh troops, and the provisions of the whole country brought among them in lavish profusion, while we had uot а morsel to eat, while ou» fountains ran drv, and our few troops were harassed with mortal fatigue Yet no man thought of surrender. Lleazars
courage, — а courage sustained by higher thoughts ¿ban those of the soldier, the fortitude of piety and prayer,—inspired us all, and we went to our melancholy duties with the calm ness of those to whom the grave was inevitable " At last when our reduced numoers gave the enemy a hope of overpowenng the defence we were attacked by their whole force But, if they expected to conquer us at their ease, never weie men more deceived When the walls gave way before their machines, they were fought from street to street, from house to house, from chamber to chamber Eleazar, active as wise, was everywhere, we fought in ruins—in fire Multitudes of the enemy perished, and more deaths were given by the knife than the spear, for our arms were long since exhausted The last effort was made On the spot where you found me When every defence was mastered by the perpetual supply of fresh troops, Eleazar, passing through the subterranean to attack the Roman rear, left ine in command of the few that survived We intrenched ourselves in the armoury For
three days че fought, without tasting food, without an hour's sleep, without laying the weapons out of our hands. At length the final assault was given. In the midst of it we beard shouts which told us that our friends had made the concerted attack ; hut wo were too few and feeble to second it. The shouts died away —we were overpowered; and my first sensa¬ tion ofieturning life was the combined agony of famine, wounds, und suffocation, under the rnins that I then fhdnght my living grave." " By dawn," said I, "we must set out for Jerusalem." " It has been closely invested for the last three months ; and famine and faction are doing their worst v. 'thm the walls. Titns is without, at the head of a hundred tlraosahd of the legionaries and allies. To enter will bè néjctto impossible ¡ and when once entered, what will be before yon mit'thé madness »fertil discord, and finally, death by the hands of an enemy utterly m- ftriated against dnr nation!" " Td Jfcrusolem, at all risks ; my fate it mingled with thai ui' tbe last stronghold of our
fallen people What matters it to one whose roots of happmess are cut up like mine, m what spot he struggles with man and fortune' As a son of Judea my powers are due to her саиве, and every drop of my blood shed for any other would be treason to the memory of my fathers. The dawn finds me on my way to Jerusalem." " It is spoken hke a prince of Naphtah, but I must not follow you. The course of glory is cut off for me, unless something may still be done by collecting the fugitives of the tribes, and harassing the Roman communications But Jerusalem, though every stone of her walls is precious to my soul, must not receive my guilty steps. I have horrid recollections of things seen and done there. My mind is still too full of the impulses that drove it to frenzy. Onias, that wily hypocrite, will be there to fill me with visions of terror- There too are—ethers." He was silent, but suddenly resuming bis firmness, " I have no hostility to Constantius, I even honour and esteem him, but my spirit is still too feverish to bear his presence, I must live and die far from all that I have ever known."
He lud bis faoe ш his mantle, but the agi tation of his form shoved more than clamor¬ ous grief. He walked forth into the dark ness. I was ignorant of his ри.роье, aud lin gered long for his retuin. But I saw him no more Disturbed and pained by bis loss, I had scarcely thrown myself on the cottage floor, my only bed, when I was roused by the cries of the village. A detachment of Roman cavalry marching for Jerusalem had entered, and was taking up Us quarters for tne mght. The pea¬ santry could make no resistance, and attempted none. I had only time to call to my adopted daughter to rise, when our hut was occupied, and we were made prisoners This was an unexpected blow, yet it was one to winch, on second thoughts, I was reconciled In the disturbed state of the country travelling was totally insecure, and even to obtain a con¬ veyance of any kind was a matter of extreme difficulty The roving plunderers that hovered in the tram of the camp were, of all plunderers, the most merciless. By falling into the hands
of the legionaries we were at least sure of an scort I might obtain some useful information of their affairs , and once ш sight of the titv, might escape from the Roman lines with more ease as a pn oner, than I could pass them is an enemy The cavalry moved at day brenk , and before night we saw in the horizon the hills that sur round Jerusalem But we had filli evidence of our approach to the centre of struggle by the devastation that follows the track of the best disciplined army, groves and orchards cut down, corn fields trampled, cottages burnt, gardens and homesteads ravaged Further on we traversed the encampments of the auxilia nes, barbarians of every colour and language within the limits of tbe mightiest of empires To the soldier of civilised nations war is а new state of existence To the soldier of barbarism war is but α more active species of his daily life It requires no divorce frum his old habits, and even encourages his old objects, cares and pleasures We found the Arab, the German, the Scythian, and the
Ëtliiop hunting, carousing, trafficking and quar¬ relling as if they had never stirred from their native regions The hordes brought with them their families, their cattle, and their trade In the rear of every auxiliary camp was a regular mart, crowded with all kinds of dealers Through the fields the barbarians were following the sports of home Trains of falconers were flying their buds at the wild pigeon and heron Half- naked horsemen were running races, without saddle or rem, on horses wild and swift as the antelope Groups were lying under the palm groves asleep, with their spears fixed at their heads others were seen busy decorating them selves for battle, crowds were dancing, gaming, and drinking As we advanced, we could bear the ν anety of clamours and echoes that belon ·ξ to barbarian war —the biaying of savage horns, the roars of mirth, rage, and feasting, the shouts of clans moving up to reinforce the besiegers, the screams and lamentations of the innumerable women as th a wains ar d litters brought back the wounded , the barbarian howlmgs over the hasty grave
of some chieftain, the ferocious revelry of tlie discoverers of plunder, and the inextinguishable sorrows of the captives We passed through some miles of this bois terous and bustling scene, in which even α Romon est* ort was scarcely a sufficient security The barbarians thronged round us, brandished their spears over our heads, rode their horses full gallop against us, and exhausted the whole language of scorn, ridicule, and wrath, upon our helpless condition But the clamour gradually died away, and we entered upon another region, totally denuded of lifr and of the means of life, a zone of silence and solitude interposed between the dangerous not of barbarism and the severe regularity of the legions. Far within this circle we reached the Roman camp, the woild of disciplined war The setting sun threw his flame on the long vistas of shield and helmet drawn out, accord¬ ing to custom, for the hour of exercise before nightfall The tribunes were on horseback in front of the cohorts, putting them through that boundless variety of admirable movements, in
which no scldiery were so dexterous as those of Rome But all was done with character siic silence No sound was heard but the mt wired tramp of the manoeuvre, and the voice of the tribune The sight was at once absorbing to the eye of one, lik- 1 me, an enthusiast in soldier ship, and appalling to the lover of his country Before me was the great machine, the resistless, living energy, that had levelled the strength of the most renowned kingdoms With the feeling of а man who sees the tempest at hand, in the iir mediate terror of the bolt, I could yet gp£o with wonder and admiration at the granueur of the thuuder cloud Before me was at once the perfection of power and the perfection ot discipline Here were no rambling crowds of retainers, no hurry- ïngs of troops startled by sudden attack, no military clamours All was calm, regular, and grand In a country, the seat of the most fu¬ rious war ever waged, I might have thought that I saw but a summer camp in an Italian plain As the night fell, the legions saluted tbe part¬ ing sun with homage, according to α custom
which they had learned in their eastern cam paigus Sounds, less of war than of worship, тоъе Hutes hitathedin low and dulcet h arm о nies from the lines, and this iron soldiery, hound on the business of extermination, mcved to their tents in the midst of strains made to wrap the heait in softness and solemnity I awoke at sun-rise But was I in a land of enchantment ' I looked for the immense camp —it had vanished A few soldiers collecting the prisoners sleeping about the field were all that remaired of an army Our guard ex¬ plained the wonder An attack on the trenches, in which the besiegers had been dm en m with serious loss, had determined Titus to bring up his whole force. The troops moved with that habitual silence which eluded almost the waking ear They were now beyond the hills, and the hour was come at which the prisoners were ordered to follow them But where was the daughter of Ananus' I had placed her m a tent with some captive females of our nat? j. The tent was struck, and its inmates were gone On the spot where
it stood, a flock of sheep were already grazing, with a Roman soldier leaning diowsily on his spear for their shepherd. To what alarms might not this fair girl be exposed ? Dubious and distressed, I followed the guard in the hope of discovering the fate of an innocent and lovely child, who seemed, like myself, marked for misfortune. In this march we went almost the whole circuit of the hilts surrounding Jerusalem and I thus had for three days the opportunity that I longed for, of seeing tbe nature of the force with which we were to contend The troops were admirably armed There was nothing for superfluity, yet those who conceived the system, knew the value of show, and the equip¬ ments of fhe oflicers were superb The helmets, outrasses, and swords, were frequently inlaid with the precious metals , and tbe superior oflicers rode richly capansoned chargers, pur¬ chased at an enormous price from the finest studs of Europe and Asia. The common sol¬ dier was proud of the brightness of his shield and helmet on duty both were covered, but
on their festivals, the most cheering momens was when the order was given to uncase their arms Then, nothing oould be more beautiful than the aspect of the legion One striking source of its pcmp was the multitude of ban- nets, every emblem that mythology could feign, every animal, every memorial connected with the lusto y of soldiership and Rome, glittered above the forest of spears, gilded serpents, wolves, lions, gods, genu stars, dtadems, im¬ perial busts, and the eagle paramount over all, were mingled with vanes of purple and em¬ broidery The most showy pageant of civil life was dull and colourless to the crowded magnificence of the Roman Ime Their system of manoeuvre gave this magni ficence its full development With the ancient armies the principle was the concentration of force AU was lone by impulse The figure by which the greatest weight could be driven against the enemy s ranks, was the secret of victory The subtlety of Itthan imagination enlightened by Greek science and fertilised by the experience of universal war, was occupied ra
the discovery ; and the Held exercise of the legions displayed every form into which troops could be thrown. The Romans always sought to fight pitched battles. They left the miuor services to their allies; and haughtily reserved themselves for the master-strokes by which empires are lost or won. The humbler hostilities, the obscure akirmiahings and surprises, they disdained ; ob¬ serving that, while " to steal upon men was the work of a thief, audi to butcher them was the habit of a barbaria« ; to fight them was the act of ή soldier." ,
CHAPTER IV Ат the elosi of a weary day we reached our final station upon the hill Scopas seven furlongs from Jerus ilem Bitter memory was busy w ıth me there Fiom the spot on which I flung myseli in heaviness of heart, huddled among a crowd of miserable captives, and wishing only that the evening gathering over me might be my last I had once lookel upon the ainiy of the oppressors marching into my toils and exulted m the secure glories of myself and my country But the prospect now beneath the eve showed only the fiery track of invasion The pastoral beautv of the plain was utterly gone
The innumerable garden houses and bummer dwellings of tho Jewish nobles, gleaming in every variety of graceful architecture, among vineyards and depths of aromatic foliage, wer' levelled to the ground, and the gardens turned into a sandy waste cut up by trenches and military works in every direction Tn the midst rose the great Roman rampart, which Titus, in despair of conquermg the city by the sword, drew round it to extinguish its last hope of provisions, or reinforcements, a hideous bound¬ ary, within which all waa to be the sepulchre I saw Jerusalem only in her expiring strug¬ gle. Others have given the history of that most memorable siege My knowledge was li¬ mited to tbe laet hideous days of an existence long declining, and finally extinguished in hor¬ rors beyond the imagination of man I knew her follies, her ingratitude, her crimes, but the love of the eity of David was deep m my soul, her lofty privileges, the proud me¬ mory of those who had made her courts glo¬ rious, the sage, the soldier, and tae prophet, lights of the world, to which the boasted diurni-
nation of the heathen was darknes3 filled my spirit with an immortal homage I loved her then I love her still To mingle my blood with that of my perish ing country was the first wish of my heart But I was under the rigour of the conhnemert inflated on the Jewish prisoners My rank was known, and while it produced offers of new distinction from my captors, it increased their vigilance To every temptation I gave the same denial, and occupied my hours in device« for escape In 'he meanwhile, I saw with terror that the wall of circuim aliatimi was closing and that a short period must pkrce an impassable barrier between me and the city After a day of anxious gazing on the pr» gress of this wall of destiny I was aroused at midnight by the roaring of one of those tempests, which sometimes break ш so fiercely upon an eastern summer The lightning struck the old tower ш wh oh ï was confined and I found myself riding on a pile of rums Escape ш the midst of a Beman camp seemed as remote as ever But the storm which shook solid
walls, made its way at will among tents, and the whole encampment was broken up A column of inf mtry passed where I wis extri eating myself from the ruins They were going to reinforce the troops m the trenches against the chance of an attack during the tempest I followed them Tho night w as terrible The lightning that blazed with frightful vividness, and then, left the sky to tenfold obscurity, led us through the lines The column was too late, and it found the besieged already mounted upon the wall of circumvállation, and flinging it down ш huge fragments The assault and de fence were alike desperate The mght grew pitchy dark, and the only evidence that men were round me, was the clang of arms A sudden flash showed me that I had reached the foot of the rampart The besieged, carried away by their native impetuositv, poured down in crowds Their leader, cheering them on, was struck by a lance, and fell The sight rallied the enemy I felt that now or never was the moment for my escape I rushed in front, and called out ray name At the voice the wounded
leader uttered а cry which I weil knew. I caught him from the ground. A gigantic cen¬ turion dartod forward, and grasped iny robe. Embarrassed with my burden, I was on the point of being dragged back, the centurion's sword glittered over my head. With my only weapon, a stone, I struck him a furious blow on the forehead The sword fell from his grusp, I seized it, and keeping the rest at bay, and iu thfj midst of shouts from my country¬ men, leaped the trench, with the nobler trophy m my arms. I had rescued Constantius ' Jtrus.ilem was now verging on the Idst horrors. I could scarcely find my way through btr ruins The noble buildings were destroyed by confla¬ gration, or 'he assaults of the various tactions. The mouuments of our kings and tr>bes were lying m mutilutiou at iny feet. Evciv man of former eminence was gone Massacre and exile were the musters of the higher ranks, and even the accidental listinctions into which the hum¬ bler in birth oi opulence were thrown by the few past years, involved a fearful purchase of public ha¿urd lake men in an earthquake, tho ele-
vation of each was only a sign to him of the workmg of an irresistible principle of ram But the most formidable characteristic was the change wrought upon the popular mmd A single revolution may be a source of public good But a succession of great political changes is fatal alike to public and pnvate virtue The sense of honour dies, m the fierce pressures of personal struggle Humamty dies, in the sight of hourly violences Conscience dies, in the conflict where personal safety is so often en¬ dangered, that its preservation at length usurps the entire mind Religion dies, where the religious man is so often the victim of the un¬ principled Violence and vice are soon found to be tbe natural instruments of triumph m a war of the passions and the more relent less atrocity carries fhe day, until selfishness, the mother of treachery, rapine, and carnage is the paramount principle Then the nation perishes, or is sent forth in madness and misery, an object of terror and nfection, to propagate evil through the world The very features of the popular physi-
ognomy were changed The natural vividness of the courtennnce was there, but hardened and clouded by habitual ferocity I was sur¬ rounded by a multitude, in each of whom ï was compelled to see the assassin The keen eye scowled with cruelty , the cheek wore the alternate flush and paleness of despe¬ rate thoughts Tho hurried gatherings—the quick quarrel—the loud blaspl emy, told me the infuriate temper that had fallen, for the last curse, on Jerusalem Scarcely a man passed me of whom I could not have said, " There goes one from a murder, or to a murder " But more open evidences startled me, ac* customed as I was to scenes of military vio¬ lence 1 saw men stabbed in familiar greetings in the streets, mansions set on fire and burned in the face of dav, with their inmates screaming for help, and yet unhelpcd, hundreds slain in rabble tumults, of which no one knew the origin The streets were covered with the wrecki of pillage, sumptuous furniture plundered from the mansions of the great, and plundered for the mere love of rum, mingled with the more
hideous wrecks of man-runburied bodies, and skeletons, left ,to whiten in the blast, or to be torn by the dogs. . Three factions, divide^ Jerusalem, even while the Roman battering-rams were shaking her colossal towers. Three armies fought night and day within the, city, carrying on the ope¬ rations of war with more then civil fury. Streets undermined, houses battered down, granaries burned, wells poisoned, the perpetual shower of death from the roofs, made the external hostility trivial : -ι ad the Romans required only patience to have been bloodless masters of a city, which yet they would have found only a tomb of its people. I waudered, an utter stranger, through Jeru¬ salem. All the familiar faces were gone. At an early period of the war ^any of the higher ranks, foreseeing the event,, had lçft the city, at a later, my victory over Cestius, by driv¬ ing back the enemy, gave a free passage to a crowd of others. It was at that time re¬ marked that the chief fugitives were Christians ; and a singular prophecy of their Master was declared to be the warning of their escape.
It ıs certain that, of bis followers, including many even of our priests and learned men, scarcely one remained They declared that the evil menaced by the Divine Wisdom through Moses—(may he rest in glory') was come, that tbe death of their Master was the consummating mme , and that, in the Romans, the nation " of a strange speech," flyirig on " eagle wmg3 from the ends of the earth," was already com missioned against a people stained with tbe blood of tbe Messiah Fatally was the word of the great prophet of Israel accomplished, fearfully fell the sword to smite away root and branch , solemnly, and by a hand which scorned the strength of man, was the deluge of rum let loose against the throne of David And still through almost two thou sand years, the flood of desolation is at the full uo mountain-top is seen rising, no spot is left clear for the sole of the Jewish foot, no dove returns with the olive Etern il King, shall this be for ever' Wilt thou utterly reject the chil dren of hım whom thy nght hand brought from VOL Ш С
the land of the idolater f Wilt thou for ever Inde thy might from the tribes whom thy servant Moses led through tho burning wilderness' Wilt thou not bring back the broken kingdom of thy servant Isricl' Stilt we wander in darkness the tenants of a prison whose walls we feel at eierystep the scoff of the idolater, the cap tive of tbe infidel hav θ we not abided without king or priest, or ephod or teraphim many days, and when are these days to he at an end' Yet is not the deluge at 1 ist about to subside ' Is not the Irumpet at the hp to summon thy chosen are not the broken tribes now awaiting thy command to come from the desert·—from the sea—from tbe dungeon— from the mine— like the light from darkness 7 I gaze upon the stars, and think, countless and glorious as they are, such shall yet he thy multitude and thy splendour, people of the undone ' The promise of the King of Kings is fulfilling, and even now, to my withered eyes, to my struggling prayer, to the deeper agonies ol л supplication thut no
tongue can utter, there is a vision and an answer.—On my knees worn by the flint, I hoar the midnight voice; nnd weeping wait for the dny that will come, though heuven and earth should pass nwav.
, CHAPTER V. ' far ars* object vu, to Mceruùn the fate of rov fumify. Frem Constantina I сопИ learn ióthŕng; for the ieveritj et hal wound bad re- änced hım to aneh * state, tkat he recognised no one. Γ sat by him day after day, watching with bitter aoHdtude fbr the return of his sehse«. He raved continual!» of bis wife, and етегу ether name that I loved. Tbe affecting eloquence of hu appeals »ometuaes plunged me into the deepest depression; sometimes drove me out to seek relief fram them even in tbe borrón of the streets; I vas tbe most solitary of men. In those melancholy wander¬ ings, none spoke to me; X spoke to none The kinsmen whom I had left ander the com-
mand of my brave ¿on, were slain or dispersed and on the night when 1 saw hu» battling with his native ardour, the men whom he led to the foot of the rampart were an accidental band, excited by hu brilliant intrepidity to choose him at the instant for their captain In sorrow, indeed, had I entered Jerusalem The devastation of the city was enormous dnnng its tumulti The great factions were reduced to two, but in the straggle, a large portion of thVJtaaple wai bunad The stately chamber· ot the pneate were dust and embers The cloutm which eneuvlad the saaetuary wer j beaten down, or left naked t» th« nuta bon of tae ками*, whwh now, a» by the pecu liar wroth of Heaves, had ascomed a fierce and отшош indemenoj, Trameadw bursts of tempaat shook the Oityi and the popular mmd was kept in perpetual alarm at the acci¬ dents which followed 4ho·» storm·. Fir.« were constantly «tosed by the lightning, deInges ot rain fiToded the «trwts, aid, falling on the shattere roofe, increased the asuery of their famishmg inbabitauts the keenest seventy of
winter in the irndst of spring, added to the suQer- ïngs of a people doubly unprovided to encounter it, by its unexpectedness, and by their necessary exposure on the battlements and m the field Within the walls, all bore the look of a grave, and even uat grave shaken by some convulsion of nature From the battlements, the sight was despair The Roman camps covered the hills, and we could see the soldiery sharpening the very lanees that were te drmk our blood. The fires of their night-watches lighted up the horizon round. At every fire we could see our future slayers. We heard the sound of their trumpets, and their shouts, aa the sheep in the fold might hear the roaring of the lion aad the tiger ready to leap their feeble boundary Yet the valour of the people was never wearied out. The wall, whose circle was to shut »» up from the help of man or the hope of escape, van the grand objeot of attack and defence, and, though thousands covered the ground at its foot with their corpses, the Jew was still ready to rush on the Roman spear.
This valour was spontaneous, for subordination had long been at an end. The namesi of John of Giscala and Simon, influential as they were in tbe earll ŕ r periods of the war, had lost their force, in the civil fury and desperate pressures of the siege. No leaders were acknowledged, but hatred of the enemy, iron fortitude, and a determination not to survive the fhll óf Jeru¬ salem. ' In this furious warftrtre, I took ,my share with the rest ţ handled the spear; ¡aid fought and watched, without thinking of any distinction of rank. My military experience^ and the per* sonai strength which enabled me to render prominent servioes in those desultory attacks, often excited our warriors to ' offer me com¬ mand ; but ambition was dead within me, I was one day sitting beside the bed of Con¬ stantius, and bitterly absorbed in gazing on what I thought the progress of death ţ when I heard an universal outcry, more melancholy than human voices seemed made to utter. My first thought was that the enemy had forced the gates. I took down my sword, and gloomily
prepared to go out and die I found the streets filled with crowds hurrying forward without apparent direction but all exhibiting a sorrow amounting to agony wringing their bands beating their bosoms tearing their hair and costing dust and ashes on their heads A large body of the priesthood came rushing from the Temple with loud lamentations The Daily Sacrifice bad ceased 1 The perpetual offer mg, whioh twice <t day burned m testimonial of the sins and the expiation of Israel, the pecu liar homage of the nation to Heaven was no more' The siege had extinguished the re¬ sources of the Temple, the victims could no longer be supplied» and the people must perish without the power of atonement This was the final cutting off-—the declaration of the sen tence-rthe seal of the great condemnation — Jerusalem was undone ! Overpowered bv this fatal sign I was sadly returmpg to my worse than solitary chamber ior there lay, speechless and powerless the noblest creature that breathed in Jerusalem yet a source of perpetual anxiety to me from
his utter helplessness and the deep affection which I bore him when I was drivéti aside by a new torrent of the people exclaiming— The prophet 1 the prophet 1 woe to the city of David M They rushed on in haggard multitudes and in the midst of them cameamad fellow bound ing and gesticulating with indescribable wild ness His constant exclamation wafl^- ' Woe— woe—woe expressed id a tone that searched the very beart He stopped froiii time to time and flung out some denunciation against the popular crimes, then recommenced his ory of Woe 1 and bo mded forward agoiti He at length came opposite to where ï -stood and his features struck me as resembling some that I had seen before But they wore full of a strange impulse—the grandeur of inspiration mingled with the animal fierceness of frenzy The eve shot fire tinder the sharp and hollow browa the nostrils contracted and opened like those of an angry steed and every musole of α singularly elastic frame was quivering and ex
posed from the offe cts alike of mental violence and fumine. " Hot Prince of Kapbtalt' w« meet at Usti" Was fais exclamation his 'countenance fell, and a tear gushed from lids that looked incapable of btnhan weakness " I found her Шу beauty, my bride I She wás in the dun geon The seal ring that I tore frórti that villain's finger was worth a mine of gold, for it opened the gates of her prison Come forth, girl 1 " With these words, he caught by the hand, and led to me a pale creature, with the traces of loveliness, but evidently in the last stage of mortal decay She stood silent as a statue In compassion I took her hand, while the multitude gathered round us in curiosity I now remembered Sobat the Ishmaelite, and his story " She is mad," said Sabat, shaking his head mournfully, and gazing on the fading form at his side " Worlds would not restore her senses But there is α time for all things" He sighed, and cast his full eye on heaven
" I watched her day and night," he went on, " till I grew mad too But the world wdl have an end, and then all will be well. Come, wife, we must be going To-mgUt 'here are strange things within the walls, and without the walla. There will be feasting, and mourn¬ ing , there will be blood, and tears then comes tbe famine—then comes the fire-*—then the sword, and then all is quiet again, and for ever' But Heaven is mighty. To mght there will be wonders T watch well your walls, people of tbe ruined city To mght there will be signs, let no man sle<m, but those that sleep m tbe grave Pnnreof Naphtali' have you too sworn, as I have, to die'' He lifted his meagre hand ' Come, ye thunders, come, ye fires vengeance cries from the sanctuary Listen ' undone people, listen ' n ition of sorrow to the trumpets of the ministers of wrath Woe—woe·—woe ' Pronouncing those words with a voice of the most sonorous, yet melancholy power, he threw himse'f into a succe p sion of strange and fear-
ful gestures, then beckoning to the female, who submissively followed his steps, plunged away among lhe multitude I heard the bow) of " Woe—woe—woe I ' long echoed through the windings of the ruined streets, and thought iliut I heard the voice of the angel of desola¬ tion. The seventeenth day of the month Tamuz, ever memorable ш the sufferings of Israel, was the Jast of the Daily Sacrifice Sorrow and fear were on the Ыу , and the silence of the night was broken by lamentation from the mul titudc. I retired to my chamber of affliction, and busied myself ш preparmg for the guard of the temple, to withdraw my mind from the gloom that was, beginning to master me Yet when I looked round the room, und thought of what I had been, of the opulent enjoyments of my palace, and of tbe beloved faces that surrounded me tht re, I felt the sickness o f the heart. The chilling air that blew through the di¬ lapidated walls, the cruse of water, the scanty
bread, the glimmering lamp, the comfortless and squalid bed, on which lay, in the last 'stage of weakness, a patriot and α hero,—bemg ftiU of fine affections and abilities, reduced to the helplessness of an infant, and whom, in leav¬ ing for the night, I might be leaving to perish by the poniard of the robber,—unmanned me I cast the scimitar from my hand, and sat down with а sallen determination there to linger until death, or that darker vengeance which haunted me, should do its will The night was stormy , and the wind roiled in long and bitter gusts through the deserted chambers of the huge mansion But the mbd ıs the true place of suffering, and I felt the season's visitation in my locks drenched about my face, and my tattered robes swept by the freez¬ ing blasts, os only the natural course of things I was sitting by the bed-side, moistening the fevered lips of Constantius with water, and pressing on him the last fragment of bread which I might ever have to give, when I, with sudden delight, heard him utter for the first time articulate sounds, I stooped my ear to
catch accents so dear, and full of hope But the vords were a supplication He prayed to the Christin'« God ' I turned away firam this resistless conviction of his belief But this was no time for debate, and I was won to listen again His voice was soarcely above a whisper, but his language was the aspiration oí a giowing heart His eyes were closed, add evidently unconscious of my presenoe, in his (ngn communion with Heaven, he talked of things of which I had but imperfect knowledge, or none, of blood shed for the sin» of man, of a descended Spirit to guard the path of the servants of Heaven, of the unspeakable love thut gave the Son oi God to torture and «ortal death, for the atonement of that humaq iniquity, which nothing hut such a sacrifice could atone He named the names dear to as both, and praying " for their safety if they still were in life, or for their meeting beyond the grave, resigned himself to the will of his Lord ' I waited ш sacred awe till I saw, by the sub siding motion of the lips, that the inward prayer
which followed, was done, and then, anxious to gam information of my family, questioned him But, with the prayer, the interval of men¬ tal power passed away. The ted was drawn over his senses once more, oad his answers were unintelligible, Yet even the hope of his restoration lightened шу gloom, my spinte, naturally elastio, shook off their leaden weight X took up the Bcimitar, and pressing the cold hand of my noble fellow- victlm, prepared to issue forth to the Temple, The storm was partially gone, and the moon, approaching to the full, was high ш heaven, lighting her way through masses of rapid «loud The wind still roared in long tilasta, as the tem¬ pest retired, like an army repulsed, and indig¬ nant at being driven from the spoil But the ground was deluged, and a bittei sleet shot on our half-naked bodies. I had far to pass through the streets of the upper city, and then- aspect was deeply suited to the melancholy of the hour Vast walls and buttresses of the burned and overthrown mansions remained, that, in the
spectral light, looked Uke gigantic spectres Ranges of inferior rums stretched to the utmost glance, some yet Bending up the smoke of recent conflagration, and others beaten down by the storms or left to decay. The immense build¬ ings of the chieftains, once the scenes of all but kingly magnificence, stood roofless and window- less, with the light sadly gleaming through their fissures, and the wind singing a dirge ot rum through tbeir lifeless halls. I soarcely met a human being ¡ for the sword and famine had tearfully reduuxl the onoe countless population. But I sometimes startled a (light of vultures from their meal, or, ш the sinking of the light, stumbled upon a heap that uttered a cry, and showed that life was there, or, from his horrid morsel, a wretch glared upon me, as one wolf might glare upon another that came to rob him of his prey, or the twinkling of a miserdble lamp, in the corner of a ruin, glimmered over a knot of felony and murder, reckoning their hideout gains, and carousing and quarrelling with the deggerdrawn. Heapsofbones, whitening m the an*, were the monuments of the wasted ţ dour of
my countrymen and the oppressive atmosphere gave the sensation of walking m a sepulchre I dragged on my limbe with increased diffi cnlty through those long avenoes of misery and death that black silent and split mto a thou sand shapes of rum» looked less like the streets of a city than the rocky defiles of a mountain shattered by lightnings and earthquakes But we were strong m that dreary strength which man denves from excess of calamity Mental and bodily suffering seemed to have done their worst Withm the city there was not suste nance for the tenth part of even its reduced popuhtion for а week to come our armouries were exhaust°d—our bodies naked—our limbs withered by perpetual wounds and watching I should have welcomed the assault which closed this lamentable struggle against impos sibiitties On the summit of the hill I found a crowd of unhappy beings who came tike myself actuated by zeal to defend the Temple from the insults to which its sanctity was now nightly exposed Faction had long extinguished the native ho
mage of the people Battles had been fought within its walls, and many а corpse loaded the sacred floors, that once would have required solemn ceremonies to free them from the pollu¬ tion of on unlicensed step. And what a band were assembled there 1 Wretches mutilated by wounds, wotn with sleepleisneas, haggard with want of food, ehi- vermg together on the deobvrty, whose naked elevation exposed them to the whole tscle- meucy of the Bight, flung, like the dead, on the ground, or gathered in little knots among tbe ruined porticoes, with death ш every frame, and despair in every heart. I was sheltering myself behind the broke.: columns of the Grand gate, from the bitter wind which searched every fibre, and was sinking into that chilling torpor which benumbs body and mind alike, when α clash of military music, and the tramp of a multitude, assailed my ear. I started up, and found my miserable compa¬ nions mustering from the various hollows of the lull to our post on the central ground of Mount Monah, where the view was boundless on every
side. A growing blaze rose up from tbe valley, and flashed upon the wall of circumvailattôm The sounds of cymbal and trumpet swelled : the blaze advanced rapidly; and going (he circuit of the wall, the helmets and lanoes of cavalry were sem glittering through the gloom ;- a crowd of archers preceded a dense b~dy of ihi legionary horse, at whose b?ad rode the Roman general and his chief officers. Ou this night the fatal wall had been completed, and Titns was going its round in triumph. Eveťy horseman carried a torch ; and strong divisione of Infan¬ try followed, bearing lamps and vessels of com¬ bustible matter on the points of their spearö. As the whole moved, rolling and bending with the inequalities of the ground, I thought that I saw a mighty serpent coiling his burning spires round the prey that was never to be rescued by the power of man. But the pomp of war below, and the wretch¬ edness around, raised reflections of such bitter¬ ness, that, when Titus nnd his splendid troop reached the foot of the Temple-hill, one outcry of sorrow and anticipated ruin burst from us all.
The conqueror heard it, and, from the in¬ stant manœuvra)? ofins troops, was evidently alarmed he had known the courage of the Jews too long, not to dread the «Hoots of their despair And despair it was, fierce and untameable ! I started forward, exclaiming, " If there is a man among you ready to stake his life for his oountry, let Jura &llow me " To the laat hour the Jon· was a warrior. The crowd grasped fteir spears, and we sprang down the cliffs. As we reached the outer wall of the city, I reetr.uned then exhaustless spirit, until I bad »ugly ascertained the state of the enemy, Titus was passing the welUknown ravine near the Fountain gate, where the ground was diffi¬ cult for cavalry, frem. its being chiefly divided into gardens, I threw open the gate, and led the way to the circumvallatifuh The centmels, occupied with looking on the pomp, suffered ns to appioacb unperceived, we mounted the wail, overthrew every thing before ns, and plunged down upon the cavalry entangled in the ravine The bravery of the legions was not proof
against the fury of our attack. Even onr wild fate» and naked forme, Been by the uncertain glare of the tombes, looked soarcely human. Horse and man were rolled down the declivity : the arrival of fresh troops only increased the con¬ fusion s their torches made them α mark for our pikes and arrows ; every point told ; and every Boman that fell, amied a Jew. The conflict became murderous : and we stabbed at ont ease the troopers of the Emperor's guard, throngh their mail, while their long lances were use¬ less· The defile gave us incalculable advantages ; for the ganlt-n-walls were iinpassable by tbe cavalry, while we bounded over them like doer. A.U was uproar, terror, and rage. We actually waded through blood. At every step I trod on horse or man ; helmets and bucklers, lances and armour, lay in heaps: the stream of the ravine soon ran purple with the proudest gore of the proud legions^· At length, while vre were' absolutely op¬ pressed with the multitude of dead, a sudden blast of trumpets, and the loud shouts of the
enemy, led me to prepare for a still fiercer effort A tide of cavalry poured over the ground, a gallant figure, cheering them on, v.th his helmet in his hand, galloped in their front, I withdrew my wearied followers from the exposed situation into which their success had led them, and, postiug them behind a ram¬ part of Roman dçad, awaited the charge. It camq with the force of thunder, the pow¬ erful horses of the imperial escort broke over our rampart at the first shock, and bore us down like stubble Every man of us was under their íeet m a moment, yet the very number of our assailants saved us the narrowness of the place gaye no room for the management of the horse t the darkness assisted both our escape and assault, and, even lying on the ground, we plunged our knives in horse and rider with taruble retaliation The cavalry at length gave way, but the Ro man generul, a man of the heroic spirit that is only inflamed by repulse, rushed forward among the disheartened troops, and roused them by his cues and gestures, to retrieve their lionour.
After a few bold words, be charged at their head I singled him out, as I saw lus golden eagle gleam in the torch light To capture the son of Vespasian would have been a triumph worth a hundred lives Titus was celebrated for personal dexterity m the management of the horse and lance, and I could not restrain my admiration of the skill with which he pene¬ trated the difficulties of the field, and the mas¬ tery with which he repelled or overthrew all that opposed him Our motley ranks were already scattering, when I called out my name, and defied hm *o the combat He stooped over bis charg°r's neck to discover his adversary, and, seeing before him a being as blackened and beggared as the most dismantled figure of the crowd, gave a laugh of fierce derision, and was turning away, when our roar of scorn recalled bim He struck in 'he spur, and, couching his lance, he bounded towards me To have waited his attack must have been destruction, I sprang aside, and with my full vigour flung the jave lin it went through his buckler He reeled,
and a groan rose from the legionaries, who were rushing forwards to his support he stopped them with a fierce gesture, and, cast¬ ing off the entangled buckler, charged again But the hope of the imperial diadem was not to be thľs cheaply hazarded The whole circle of cavalry rolled m upon us, I was dragged down by a bundred hands, and Titus was forced awiy indignant at the zeal which thwirted his fierv valour In the confusion I was forgotten, slipped through the concourse, and rejoined my conn try men, who had given me over for lost and now received me with shouts of victory The universal cry was to advance but I felt thit the limit of tnumph for that night was come the engagement had become known to the whole range of the enemy β сатрв, and troops without number were already pounng down I ordered а retreat, but there was one remaining exploit to make the nights service memorable Leaving a few hundred pikemen outside the circumvállation to keep off any sudden attempt I set every hand at work to gather the dry
we ds rushes and fragments of trees from the low grounds into ι pile It was laid against fhe rairpart I flung the first toreh aud pile and rampirt were soon alike m a blaze Vo lumes of il ime carried by the wmd, rolled louud its entire circuit The Romans rushed down in multitudes to ex tinguish the fire But this became continually more difficult Jerusalem had been roused from its sleep ind the extrivigint rumours that α great victory was obt lined Titus slain, and the enemy s camp t ike ι by storm, stimulated the na tur û spirit of the people to the most boundless ι onfidente Every Jew who could find a lance in mow or a kniit hurried to the gates , an I ihe spice between the walls aud the cırt ura val la tion wa crowded with an army, which in thit trisis of superhuman exultation peihaps no dis ciphutd forte on earth tould have outfought T\ othing could now save the rampart Torches innumerable, piles of fagots, arms, even tht dead all things that could burn, were ßuug upon it Thousands who at other times, might h ive shrunk forgot the name of fea* leaped VOI UI D
into the very midst of the flames, and, tearing up the blazing timbers, dug to the heart of the rampart, and filled the hollows with sulphur and bitumen, or struggled their way across the tumbling ruins, to throw themselves among the Roman spearmen and see the blood of an enemy before tbey died War never bad a bolder moment Human nature, roused to the wildest height of enthu¬ siasm, was lavishing life like dust The ram part spread α horrid light upon the havock every spot of the battle, every group of the funous hying and the trampled and deformed dead, was keenly visible The ear was deafened by the incessant roar of flame, the falling of the huge heaps of the rampurt, and the agonies and exultations of men revelling in mutual slaughter In that hour came one of those solemn signs that marked the downfall of Jerusalem The tempest, that had blown at intervals with tremendous violence, died away at once, and a surge of light ascended from the horizon, and rolled jp rapidly to the zenith The phenome-
non instantly fixed every eye There was an indefinable sense in the general mmd that ι sign of power and Providence was about to be given The battle ceased, the outcries were followed by utter silence, the armed ranks stood still, m the very act of rushing on each other all faces were turned on the heavens The light rose pale and quivering, like the meteors of a summer evening But in the /enith it spread and swelled mto a splendour, that distinguished it irresistibl) from the won¬ ders oi earth or air It swiftly eclipsed every star The moon vanished before it, the canopy of the sky seemed to be dissolved, for a * iew mto a bnght and infinite region beyr* id fit for the career of those mighty beings to whom man is but α feather on the gale As we gazed, this boundless field was trans formed into a field of battle, multitudes poured across it in the fiercest convulsions of combat, horsemen charged, and uied under their horses feet, armour and standards were trampled m blood, column and line burst through each
other At length the battle stooped towards the earth, and, with hearts beating with inde¬ scribable feelings, we leeogmsed in the fight /he banners of the tribes It was Jew and Ro¬ man struggling for life, the very countenances of the combatants became visible, and each man below saw a representative of himself and his fortunes above The fate of Jewish war was there written by the baud of Heaven, the fate of the individual was there predicted in the individual triumph or fall Whut thought of man can concen e the intense interest with which we watched every blow, every movement, e\ery wound of those images of ourselves ? The light illumined the whole horizon below The legions were seen drawn out in front of the camps ready for action, every helmet and spear-point glittering in the radiance , every face turned up, gazing in awe and terror on the sky The tents spreading over the hills, the thousands and tens of thousands of auxiliaries and captives, the little groups of the peasantry roused from sleep by the uproar of the night,
and gathered upon ihe knolls and eminences of tneir fields, all were bathed in a flood of preter¬ natural lustre But the wondrous battle approached its close The visionary Romans shook, column and co¬ hort gave way, and the banners of the tnbes waved m victory over the field Then first, human voices d ired to be heard From the city and the plain burst iorth one mighty shout of tnumph But our presumption was to be soon checked A peal of thunder that made the very ground tremble under our feet, rolled from the four quarters of the heaven The conquenng host shook, broke, and iled in utter confusion over the sapphire field If was pursued, but by no sem¬ blance of the Roman Au awful enemy was on its steps Flashes of forked fire, like my riads of lances, darted after it, eloud on cloud deepened down, as the smoke of a mighty fur¬ nace, globes of light shot blasting and burning along its track. Then, amid the doubled roar of thunder, rushed forth tbe chivalry of Hea¬ ve» , shapes of transcendent beauty, yet with
looks of wrath that withered the human eje, armed sons of immortality descending on tbe wing by millions mingled with shapes and in struments of rum for which the mind has no conception The circle of the heaven was filled with the chariots and horses of fire Flight was in vain the weapons were seen to drop from the Jewish host their warriors sank upon the splendid field Still the immortal armies poured on, trampling aud blasting, until the last <rf the routed was consumed The angry pomp then paused Countless wings were spread, and the angelic multitudes, having done the work of vengeance rushed up¬ ward with the sound of ocean m the storm The roar of trumpets and thunders was heard, until the splendour was lost in the heights of the empyrean We felt the terrible warning Our strength was dried up at the sight despair seized upon our souls We had now seen the fate of Jeru salem No victory over man could save us from the coming of final ruin Thousands never left the ground on which they stood, th°y perished
by their own hands, or la} down and died of broken hearts The rest fled through the night, that again wrapped them in tenfold darkness The whole multitude scattered away, witb soundless steps aud in silence, like an army of spectres
CHAPTER VI iN the deepest dejection that could o\er- whelm the human mmd I returned to the city, where one melancholy care still bound me to existence I hastened to my comfortless home, but the battle bad fluctuated so far round the walls, that I found myself perplexed among tbe ruins of a portion of the lower city, a crowd of obscure streets which belonged almost wholly to strangers and the poorer population The faction of John of Giscala, composed chiefly of the more profligate and beggared class, had made the lower city their stronghold, before they became masters of Mount Monah , and some desperate skirmishes, of which con
flagrations were the perpetual consequence, laid waste the principal part of a distnct built and kept up with the haste and carelessness of po¬ verty To find a guide through this scene of dilapidation was hopeless, for every living crea¬ ture, terrified by the awful portents of the sky, had now fled from the streets The night was solid darkness No expiring gleam from the burnt rampart, no fires of the Roman camps, no lamp on the Jewish battlements, broke the pitchy blackness Life and light seemed to have penshed together To proceed soon became impossible, and 1 had no other resource than to wait the coming of day But to one accustomed as I was to hardships, this inconvenience was trivial I felt my way along the walls to the entrance of л house that promised some protection from the night, and flinging myself into a corner, vainly tried to slumber But the rising of the storm, and the rain pouring upon my lair, drove me to seek a more sheltered spot within the ruin The destruction was so effectual, that this was diffi¬ cult to discover, and I was hopelessly returning
to take my chance in the open air, when I ob served the glimmer of a lamp through a crevice m the upper pnrt of the building My fi ist im¬ pulse was to approach and obtain assistance But the abruptness of the ascent gave me time to consider the hazard of breaking in upon such groups us might be gathered at that hour, ш a period when every atrocity under Heaven leigned in Jerusalem My patience was put to hut brief tri il , for, in a few minutes, I heard a low hymn It piused, as if followed by prayer lhe hymn began agam, in accents so faint, as eudently to express the fear of the worshtppeis But the sounds thrilled through my soul I listened in a struggle of doubt and hope Could I ht de teived ' and, if I were, how bitter must be tlu discovery ' I sat down on the foot of tin rude stair, to feed myself with the fancied delight, before it should be snatched from me for e\er But my perturbation would have risen to m ulne s, had I stopped longer I climbed up the tottering steps, half-way I found mjself ob structed by a door, I struck upon it, and с died
aloud. After an interval of miserable delay, a still higher door was opened, and a figure, dis¬ guised in α mantle, tremblingly looked out, and demanded my purpose I saw glancing over her two faces, that I would bave given the world to see I called out " Miriam '" Over powered with emotion, my speech failed me 1 lived only in my eyes I saw Miriam fling oft the mantle with a scream of joy, and rush down the steps I saw my two daughters follow her with the speed of love , the door was thrown back and I Ml fainting into their arms Tears, exclamations, and gazings, were long our only language My wife flung her arms round me, and hung over my wasted frame with endless embraces and sobs of joy My daughters fell at my feet, bathed my cold hands with their tears, smiled on me in speechless delight, aud then wept agam They had thought me lost to them for evei. I had thought them dead, or driven to some solitude which forbade us to meet again on this side of the grave For two vears, two dreadful years, α lonely man on
earth, a wifeless husband, a childless father, tried by every misery of mind and body, here, here I found my treasure once more On this spot, wretched and destitute as it was, m the midst of publie misery and personal woe, I had found those whose loss would have made the riches of mankind beggary to me My soul overflowed Words were not to tell the feverish fondness, the strong delig 1 that qui¬ vered through me, I wept with woman s weak¬ ness , I held my wife and children at arm s length, that I might enjoy the full happiness of gazing on them, then my eyes would grow dim, and I caught them to my heart, and in silence, the silence of unspeakable emotion, tried to col lect my thoughts, and convince myself that my joy was no dream The night passed in mutual inquiries The career of my family "had been deeply diversified On my capture in the great battle with Cestius, in which it was conceived that I had fallen, they were on the point of coming to Jerusalem to ascertain their misfortune The advance of
the Bomans to Masada precluded this They sailed for Alexandria, and were overtaken by a storm " In that storm," said Miriam, with terror painted on her countenance, " we saw a sight that appalled the firmest heart among us, and to this hour recalls horrid images The night had fallen intensely dark Our vessel, labour* ing through the tempest during the day, ai.d greatly shattered, was expected to go down be¬ fore morn, and I had come upon the deck pre pared to submit to the general fate, when I saw α flame upon the honzon I pointed it out to the manners, but they were paralyzed by weariness and fear, and instead of approaching what I conceived to be a beacon, they let the vessel drive before the wind I watched the light , to my astonishment I saw it advancing over the waves It was a large ship on fire, and rushing down upon us Then indeed there was no insensibility in our manners, they weVe like madmen through excess of fear, they did every thing but make α resolute effort to escape the danger
"The blazing ship came towards us with ter¬ rific rapidity. As it approached, the figure oi a man was seen on the deck, stunding unhurt in the midst of the burning The Symn pilot, hitherto the boldest of our crew, at this sight, cast the helm from his hands in despair, and tore his beard, exclaiming, that we were un done Го our questions he would give no other answer than pointing to the solitili y being who stood calmly in the centre of conflagrition more like a demon than a man " I proposed that we should make some effort to rescue this unfortunate man But the pilot was horror sti tick at the thought, and then gave up the tale, that it cost him agonies even to utter He told us that the being whom our frantic compassion would attempt to save, vvab an accursed thing, that for some crime too inexpiable to allow of his remaining among ere ι lures capable of hope, he was cast out from men stricken into the nature of the condemned spirits and sentenced to rove the ocean in lire, ever burning, and never consumed ' I felt every word, as if that fire weredevour
ing my flesh The sense of what I was, and what I must he, was poison My head swam, mortal pain overwhelmed me And this ab¬ horred th ng I was, this sentenced and fearful wretch I was, covered with wrath and shame, the exile from human nature and I heard my sentence pronounced, and my existence tie clared hideous, by the hps on which I hung for t onfidence and consolation against the world Flinging my mantle over my face to hide its writhings, I seemed to listen , but my ears re¬ fused to hear In my perturbation, I once thought of boldly avowing the truth, and thus fieeing myself from the pang of perpetual con ceulment. But the offence ind the retribution were too real and too deadly, to be disclosed, without destroying the last chance of happiness to those innocent suffertrs I mastered tlie convulsion, and again bent my ear ' Our story exhausts you, ' said Miriam but it is done After а long pursuit in which tli burning ship followed us, as if with the e\ press purpose of our ruin, we were snatched from a death by fire, only to undergo the chance
of one by the waves, for we struck upon a rock. Yet it may па»е been owing even to that chase that we were saved The ship had driven us towards land At sea we must have perished, but tlu shore was found to be so near, that the country people, guided by the flame, saved us without the loss of a life Once on shore, we met with some of the fugitives from Masada, who brought us to Jtrusulem, the only remain ing refuge for our unhappy nation To prevent u recurrence of this torturing subjett, I mastered my emotion so far as to isk some question of their means of support during the siege But Miriams thoughts were still busy with the sea After some hesitation, and as if she dreaded the answer, she said , " One extraordinary circumstance made me take a strong interest in the tute ol that solitiry being on boird the burning vessel It once set med lo have the most striking likeness to you I even cried out to it under that impression, but fortuuate it was for us all that my heedless cry was not answered, for, when it approached us I could set its countenance change it threw a
sheet of flame across our vessel that almost scorched us to death, and then, perhaps thinking that our destruction was complete, the human fiend ascended from the waters in a pillar of in¬ tense fire " I felt deep pain in this romantic narrative. My mysterious sentence was the common talk oí mankind' My frightful secrtt, tint Iliad thought locked up in my own heart, was loose as the air' This was enough to make life bitter But, to be identified m the minds of my family with the object ot universal horror, w is a chance which I determined not to conti mplate My secret there was still safe , and my resolu¬ tion became fixed, never to destroy th it safety by any frantic toniidence of my own
CHAPTER VII While, with my head bent on my knees, I hung in the misery of self abhorrence, I heard the name of Constantius sorrowfully pronounced beside me The state in which he must be left by my long absence flashed upon my mmd, I threw back the mantle, and saw Salome It was her voice that wept, and I then first observed the work of woe m her form and features She was almost a shadow, her eye was lustreless, and the hands that she clasped in silent prayer were reduced to the bone But before I could speak, Miriam made a sign of silence to me, and led the mourner away, then returning, said, I dreaded lest you might make any inquiries
before Salome for her husband Religion alone has kept her from the grave On our arrival here we found our noble Constantuw worn out by the fatigue of the time, but he was our guardian spirit in the dreadful tamults of the city When we were burned out of one asy Ium, he led us to another It is but a week since he placed us in this melancholy spot, but yet the more secure and unknown He himself brought us provisions, supplied us with every comfort that could be obtained by his impo¬ verished means, and saved us from want But now, —the tears gushed from her ejcb and she could not proceed " Yes—now," said I, " he is a sight that would shock the eye we must keep Salome in ignorance, as long as we can ' " The unhappy girl knows his fate but too well He left us a few days since, to obtain some intelligence of the siege We sat during the night, listening to the frightful sounds of battle At day break, unable any longer to bear the suspense, or sit looking at Salome s wretch edness, I ventured to the Fountain gate, and
there heard what I so bitterly anticipated—our brave Constantius was slam ' She wept aloud and sobs and cries of irre pressible anguish answered her from the cham ber of my unhappy child The danger of ι too sudden discovery pre vented me from drying those tears and I could proceed only by offering conjectures on the va nous chances of battit the possibility of his being made prisoner and the general difficulty of ascertaining ilie fates of men in the irregular combatb of a populace But Salome sat fixed in cold incredulity Esther sorrowfully kissed my li md for the disposition to give them a ray of comfort Miriam ga¿ed on me with а sad and si irUuug look as if sht felt th it I would not tamper with their distresses yet was deeply perplexed for the ibsuc At last the de 1 iy gitw pan ful to myself and taking Salome to my arms in 1 pressing ι kiss of parental love on btr pdle cheek I whispered he lives I was overwhelmed with transports and thanksgivings Precaution w as at an end If

uudisturbed by the riots of the crowd, too bare to invite tbe robber, and nyen its vase and naked chambers, its gloomy passages, and frowning easements, were congenial to the mood of my mmd With Constantius insensible and uy iug before me, and with my own spirit dark¬ ened by an eternal eloud, I loved the loneliness and darkness When the echo of the winds came round me, as I sat dunng my miserable midnights watching the countenance of my son, and moistening his feverish Up with the water, that even then was becoming a commodity ol rare price in Jerusalem , I communed with me- mones that I would not bave exchanged for the brightest enjoyments of life I welcomed the sad music, in which the beloved voices revisited my soul, what was earth now to me, but a tomb ' pomp, nay comfort, would have been a mockery I clung to tbe solitude and obscurity that gave me the picture of the grave. But the presence of my family made me feef the wretchedness of my aboue. And when 1 cast my eyes round the squalid and chilling halla, and saw wandering through them those
gentle and delicate forms and saw them trying to disguise by smiles and cheering words the depression that the whole scene must inspire, I felt a pang that might defy a firmer philo¬ sophy than mine " Here ' said I to Miriam, as I hastened to the door, " I leave you mistress of a palace. The Asmonean blood once flourished within these walls, and why not we ? I have seen the nobles of the land crowded into these chambers, and every spot of them echoing with festivity They are not so tull now, but we must make the most of what we have Those hangings, that I remember the pride of the Sidonian who sold them, and the wonder of Jerusalem, are left to us ε +ill , if they are m fragments they will but show our handy work the more We must make our own music , and m default of menials, serve with our own hands The pile m that corner was once a throne sent by a Persian king to the descendant of the Macca bees, it will serve us at least for firing the walls are thick, the roof may hold out a few storms more, the casements, if they keep out vol m E
nothing else, keep out the day light, an un¬ welcome guest, which would do any thing but reconcile us to the state of the mansion and now, farewell for а few hours ' Minam caught my arm, and said m that sweet tone, which always sank into my heart " Saiatlnel, you must not leave us in this tem¬ per I would rather hear your open complaints of fortune, than this affectation of scorn for our oalamities They are many, and painful, I allow , though I will not—dare not repine They may even be such as are beyond human cure. But who shall say, that he has deserved better, or if he has, that suffering may not be the de¬ termined means of purifying and exalting his nature ? Is gold the only thing that is to be tried in the fire ? ' She waited my answer, with a look of de¬ jected love " Miriam, I need not say that I respect and honour yom feelings But no resignation can combat the substantial evds of life Will the finest sentiments that ever came from human Ьрь make this darkness light, turn this bitter
wmd into warmth, or make these hideous cham¬ bers but the dungeon ? " Samtbiel, I dread this language," was the answer, with more than usual solemnity u It is, must I say it, even uugrateful and unwise shall tho creatures of the Power by whom we are placed ш life, either defy his wrath, or dis¬ regard his mercy ? Might we not lie more se- veiely tucked than we are î Are there not thou¬ sands at this hour ш the world, who, with at least equal claims to the divine benevolence, (I tremble when I use the presumptuous phrase,) are undergoing calamities, to winch ours are happiness ? Look from this very threshold are there not thousands within the walls of Jeru¬ salem groaning in the pangs of unhealed wounds, mad, starving, stripped of every succour of man, dying ш hovels, the last survivors of their wietched race, and yet we, »till enjoying health, wiih a roof over our heads, with our children round us safe, when the plague of the first¬ born has fallen upon almost every house ш Judea, can complain ' Be comforted, my love, I see but one actual calamity among us, and,
if Coaa*antius should survive, even that ono would be at nn end " I tned to escape under cover of ridicule '* So, let fancy have its way, and never had it a more boundless field. Let us dream this rum into our palace, fill its walls with imagi nary opulence, and be happy in spite of chance or change. Here will I sit," said I, throwing myself on the remnant of an embroidered couch, " enjoy the delights of society m solitude, and feel every comfort of life in cold, squabdness, and privation." Miriam turned away with a vexed look, but soon, recovering her com posure, came hack to conquer with her irre sistible smile " I can forgive your unhappmess the spirit of man is not made to endure with the pa tience of woman. But, thoughts like yours are nurtured mto sadness by inactivity you must leave us for a while, and see how fir oui skill may not improve even this dwelling Go into the streets, and bring ns intelligence of what the Romans are doing Try the effect of suu-shine and air , and then return, and allow
the wonders that can be done even by helpless I obeyed the orders of my gentle despot, and h umed through the echoing halls of this palace of the winds As I approaohea the great avenues leading from the gates to the Temple, unusual sounds struck my ears. Hitherto, nothing in the sadness of the besieged city was sadder than its silence Death was lord of Jerusalem, and the numberless ways m which life was extinguished, had left but the remnant of its once proud and flounshing population But now, shouts, and still more the deep and perpetual murmur that bespeaks the move¬ ments and gatherings of а crowded city, aeto nished me My first conception was, that the enemy had advanced n force, and I was turn ing towards the battlements to witness or repel the general fate, when I was involved in the multitude whose voices had perplexed me It was the season of the paeaover, the Ro¬ man barrier had hitherto kept back the tribes but the victory that left it in embers, opened the gates, and we once more saw the sons of Judea filling the courts of the city of cities
CHAPTER VIII Nothing could be more unrestrained than the public rejoicing The bold mvnads that poured in hour by hour, many of them long acquainted with Roman battle, and distin¬ guished for the successful defence of their strongholds, many of them even bearing arms taken from the enemy, or displaying honourable scars, seemed to have come, sent by Heaven The enemy evidently disheartened by their late losses, and the destruction of the rampart which liad cost them so much labour, were collected in their camps, and access was free from every quarter The rumours of our triumph had spread with singular rapidity through the land,
and even the fearful phenomenon that wrote our undoing in the skies, stimulated the na tional hope No son of Abraham could believe, without the strongest repugni nee, that Hea ven had interposed, and yet, interposed against the chosen people A living torrent came swelling into the gates, and the great avenues and public places were quickly impassable with the multitude Jeru salem never before contained such a mass of population Wherever the eye turned were tente, fires, and feasting still, the multitude wore an aspect not such as in former days. The war had made its impression on the in» most spirit of our oountry. The shepherds and tillers of the ground had been forced into the habits of soldiership, and I saw before me, for the gentle and joyous inhabitants of the field and garden, bands of warriors, made fierce by the sullen necessities of the time The ruin in which they found Jerusalem, increased their gloom Groups were seen every where climbing among the fallen buildings to find out the dwelling of some cbief of their
tribe, and venting furious indignation on the hands that had overthrown it The work of war upon the famous defences of the city was a profanation in their eyes Crowds ruahfed through the plain to trace the spot where their kindred fell, and gather their bones to the tardy sepulchre Others were exulting over the wrecks of the Roman, and burning them in heaps, that they might not mix with the honoured dead Bat it was the dilapidation of the Temple that strack them with the deepest wrath The whole nervous sensibility and na¬ tive reverence of the Jew were awakened by tbe sight of the humiliated sanctuary They knelt and kissed the pavements stained with the marks of eivil feud They sent forth deep lamentatiti s for the dismantled beauty of gate and altar They wrapped their mantles round their heads, and, covering themselves with dust and ashes, cbanted hymns of funereal sorrow over the ruins Hundreds lay embracing pillar and threshold, as tbey would the corpse of a parent or a child, or, starting from the ground, gathered on the heights nearest to the enemy,
and poured out curses upon the abomination of desolation—tho idolatrous banner that flaunted over the Roman camps and by its mere pre sence insulted and polluted the Temple of their fathers In the midst of this sorrow and never was there more real sorrow was the strange con trast of a violent spirit of festivity The pass over the grand celebration of our law was till now marked by a grave bornage Even its recollections of triumphant deliverance and illustrious promise were but slightly suffered to mitigate the general awe But the character of the Jew had undergone a signal change Desperate valour and haughty contempt of all power but that of arms were the impulse of the time The habits of the camp weie trans ferred through every part of life and the reckless joy of the soldier when tbe battle is done the eagerness for immediate indulgence and the rude and unhallowed resources to while away the heavy hour of idleness were power fully and repulsively prominent in the final coming up of the nation
As I struggled through the avenues in search of the remnant of my tribe, my ears were perpetually startled by sounds of not, I saw, beside the spot where relations were weeping over their dead, crowds drinking, dancing, and clamouring Songs of wild exultation over the enemy, were mingled with laments for their country, wine flowed, and the board, loaded with careless profusion, was surrounded by re¬ vellers, with whom the carouse was often sue ceeded by the quarrel Thp phansee and scribe, the pests of society, were as busy as ever, bustling through the con¬ course with supercilious dignity, canvassing for hearers in the market places as of old, offering their wordy devotions where they might best be seen, and quarrelling, with the native bitterness of religious faction Blind guides of the blind, vipers and hypocrites, I think that I see them still with their turbans pulled down upon their scowling brows, their mantles gathered round them, that tney might not be degraded by a profane touch, and every feature of their acrid and worldly physiognomies wrinkled with pride
put to the torture by the assumption of hu¬ mility Minstrels, far unlike those who once led the way with sacred song to the gates of the holy city, flocked round the tents, and companies of Greek and Syrian mimes, dancers, and flute players, the natural and fatal growth of a period of military relaxation, were erecting their pa¬ vilions, as in the festivals of their own profli¬ gate cities Deepening the shadows of this fearful pro¬ fanation, stood forth the progeny of terror, the exorcist, the soothsayer, tbe magician girdled with live serpents, the pretended prophet naked and pouring out funous rhapsodies, impostors of every colour and trade, yet, some of those abhorred and frightful beings the dupes of their own imposture, some utterly frenzied, and some declaring and doing wonders, that showed a power of evil never learned from man In depression of heart I gave up the effort te urge my way through scenes, that, firm as I was, terrified me, and turned towards my home, through the steep path that passed along
the outer Court of the Temple There all was the mournful silenoe suited to the Sanctuary» that was to see ita altars kindled no more But the ruins were crowded with kueehng and woe¬ begone worshippers» that, from morning till night, clung to the sacred sod, and wept for the departing majesty of Judah. I knelt with them, and mingled my tears with theirs Prayer calmed my spirit, and before I left the height, I stopped to look agota upon the wondrous expanse below. The clear atmo¬ sphere of the East singularly diminiaheidistance, and I seemed to stand close to the Roman camps The valley at my feet was living with the new population of Jerusalem clustering thiok a» bees, and sending up the perpetual hum of their mighty hive The sight was superb, and I involuntarily exulted in the strength that my country was still able to dis play ш the faoe of her enemies. " Here were the elements of mutral havock, but, might they not be the elements of preser¬ vation''—The thought occurred, that now was the time to make an effort for peace " We
had by the repulse of the legionaries shown the price which they must pay for conquest. Even since that repulse, a new force had started for¬ ward, armed with an enthusiasm, that would perish only with the last man, and tenfold in* creasing the difficulties of the conquest.** I turned again to the ruins, where I joined myself to some venerable and influential tóen, who alike shuddered at the excesses òf the crowd below, and the catastrophe that pro¬ longed war must bring. My advice pro&twed an impression. The remnant of the Sanhedrim were speedily collected ; and my proposal was adopted, that a deputation should immediately be sent to Titus, to ascertain how far he was disposed to an armistice. The regular pacifi¬ cation might then follow with a more solemn ceremonial. From the top of Mount Moriah we anxiously watched the passage of our envoys through the multitude that wandered over the space from Jerusalem to the foot of the enemy's position. We saw them pass unmolested, and enter the Roman lines; and from the group of officers
ofrank who came forward to meet them, we gladly conjectured that their reception was favourable Within an hour we saw them mov¬ ing down the side of the hill on their return, and at some distance behind, a cluster of horse¬ men slowly advancing The deputation bad executed its task with success. It was received by Titus with Italian urbanity. To its representations of the power subsisting in Judea to sustain the war, he fully assented, and, giving high praise to the forti¬ tude of the people, only lamented the necessary havock ot war. To give the stronger proof of his wish for peace, his answer was to be conveyed forma 1 ! v by a mission of his chief councillors and officers to the Sanhedrim. The tidings were soon propagated among the people, and proud of their strength, and irn- tated against the invader as they were, the prospect of relief from their innumerable pri¬ vations was welcomed with undisguised joy The hope was as cheering to the two pro¬ minent leaders of the factions, as to any man among us John of Giscala had been stimulated
into daring by circumstances alone; nature never intended him for a w imor Wily, grasp¬ ing, and selfish, Tuel without boldness, and keen without intellectual vigour, his only purpose was to accumulate money, and to enjoy power The loftier objects of public life were beyond his narrow capacity He had been rapidly losing even his own meaner objects his followers were deserting him , and a continuance of the war involved equally the personal peril which he feared, and the fall of that tottenng authonty, whose loss would leave him to insulted justice Simon, the son of Gioras, was altogether of a higher class of mankind He was M nature a soldier, and might have, in other times, risen to a pi ice among the celebrated names of war But the fierceness of the period inflamed his bold spirit into savage atrocity In the tumults of the citv he had distinguished himself by that unhesitating hardihood, which values neither its own hfe nor th it of others, and his boldness threw the hollow and artificial character of his rival deeply into the shade But he found a different adversary in the Romans His brute
bravery was met by intelligent valour, his rash¬ ness was punished by the disciplino of the le gions, and, weary of conflicts m which he was sure to be defeated, he had long left the field to the irregular sallies of the tnbes, and con¬ tented himself with prowess in city feud, and the preservation of his authonty agamst the dagger Peace with Rome would have relieved both John and Simon from the danger, which threat¬ ened to overwhelm them alike to the citizens it would have given an instant change from the terrors of assault to tranquillity to the nation, the hope of aa existence made splendidly se¬ cure and honourable, by its having been won from the sovereign of the world
CHAP! ER IX The movement of the Roman mission through the plam was marked by loud shouts Ab it approached the gates, our little Council descended from the Temple-porch to meet it, where one of the open places ш the centre of the city was appointed for tho conference The ap¬ plauding roar of the people followed the troop through the streets , and when the tribunes and st nntors entered the square, and gave ns the nght hand of amity, the universal acclamation shook the air A gleam of joy revisited my heart, and I was on the point of ascending an elevation in the centio, to announce the terms of this fortunate armistice,—to my astonish¬ ment I saw the spot pre occupied
Whence came the intruder no one could tell But tht rt ht stood, a figure tint fixed the uni versal eye He w ıs of lolty stiture Irown ns an Indian and thin as one worn to tlie 1 ist ex tremity by sorrow or famílii Conjtcture was busy He stemed alttrn tttly ·—ihe iugitive from a dungeon— ont of the hilf savage re cluses that sometimes came from their dens in tbe wilderness to exhibit among us the last humiliation of mmd and body,— a deiler in for bidden arts, attempting to impose on the rude credulity of the populace,—and a prophet, armed with the fearful knowledge of our np proachmg fall But to me there was an ex pression in his countenance that partook of all vet I gazed with an indefinable feeling that there was a something diflerent from all ш the glaring eye the fixed and livid scorn of the hp and the stern and grand outline of features, that uppeared alike overflowing with malignity and majesty No raau thought of interrupting hi n A powerful interest hushed every voice of the multitude, and the only impulse was eagerness
to hear tho lofty wiwlom, or the fatal tidings t ha* must bo deposited with such a being He himself seemed to be overwhelmed with the mignitudt of the thoughts lint ht was commissioned to disclose He stood for а w hilt with tlie look of one oppressed by а ft tu fiil dream , his bosom heaving his teeth gnash ing, every muscle of his meagre frame swelling and q u verm g He strongly clasped his bony arms across his breast, ns if to repress the a 0 i tation that impeded his words, then, stamping on the ground, in wrath at the faculties which thus sank under Ium at the important moment the tempest of his soul broke forth " Judah ' thou wert us a lion—thou wert as the king of the forest when he went up to the mountains to slay, md from the mountains came down to devour Thou wert as tht gar den of Tden every precious stone was thy covering, the sardine, the topaz, and the beryl were thy p ivements, thy fountains were of silver, and thy daughters that walked in thy groves were as the cherubim and the seraphim " Judah' thy temple was glorious as the sun rising, and thy priests were the wise of the earth
Kings came against thee, and their bones were an offering, the fowls of the air devoured them , the foxes brought their young, and feasted them upon the mighty " Judah' thou wert a¡* n fire in the midst of the nations—a fire upon an altar, who shall quench thee *—A sword over the neck of the heathen, who shall say unto thee, Smite no more * Thou wert as the thunder and the lightning thou earnest from thy place, and the earth was dark the heaven was thine, the earth was at thy feet Thou didst thunder, and the nations shook, and the fire of thy indignation consumed them " The voice m which this extraordinary being uttered those words was like the thunder The multitude listened with breathless awe The appc al in the language of their own prophets, was to them a renewal of the times of in spiration and they awaited with outstretched and quivering countenances the sentence, that their passions interpreted into the will of Heaven The figure lifted up his glance, that had hitherto been fixed on the ground, and, whethei it was the work of fancy, or reality, I thought
that the glance threw an actual beam of fire across the upturned visages of the myriads that filled every spot on which а foot could rest, roof, wall, and ground Bowing Ins head, and raising his bands ш the most solemn adoration towards the Temple he pursued, in a voice scarcely above a whisper, ytt indescribably impressive^— ' Sons of the faithful Abrah un, of Isaac and of Jacob, people chosen of God, elect and holy ' Will you suffer that house of holiness to be the scoff of the idolater ' Will you see the polluted sacrifice laid upon its altars * Will you be slaves and victims m the presence of the house of David ? ' A rising outcry of the multitude showed how deeply they felt his words A fierce smile lightened across his features at the sound He erected his colossal form, and cried out, like the Toar of a whirlwind, " Then, men of Jndab, be strong, and follow the haud that led you through the sea and through the desert Is that band shortened, that it cannot save ' Break off this accursed league with the sons of Belial
Пу every man to arms, for tho glory of the mighty people Will the Most High desert his ptople' Go , and let the sword that smote the C inianite, smite the Roman * He w ıs answered with furious exultation Swords aud poniards were brandished in the air The sifcty of the Romín officers became end uı gi red , and I, with some of the elders, dreading a result which must throw fatal obstacles in the way of pacification, attempted to control t 1 e popular violence by reason and entreaty But the spirit of the Romans, haughty With conquest, and long contempt of rabble prowess, disdained to take precautions with а mob and they awiited with palpable contempt in their faces the subsiding of this city efľerves cence But this silent scorn, which probably stung the deeper for its silence, was retorted by chmours of unequivocal rage, the mysterious disturber saw the storm coming, and flmgmg a furious gesture towards the Roman camps, which by glittering in the sun shine along the hills, he rushed into the loftiest language of malediction
"Tuke up u lament for the Roman," he shouted " He comes like a leviathan , he troublelb the waters with bis presence , and the mers behold bim, and are afraid " Thus saith the king, he who holdeih Israel in the hollow of his hand I will spread my net over thee, and my people shall drag thee upon the shore, I will leave thee to rot upon the land, I will fill the beasts of tbe earth with thee, until the} shall come and find thee dry bones and dust, even thy glory turned into а taint and a scorn " laft up а cry over Rome, and say, Thou art the leopard, thy jaws are ml with blood, and thy claws are heavy because of the multitude of the shun , thy spots ore glorious, and thy feet are like wings for swiftness. But thy time is at hand My arrow shall smite through thee , my steel shall go through thee I will lay thy flesh upon the lulls, tli> blood sball be red in the rivers, tbe pits shall be full of thee, " Tor, thus sait h the king, I have not for sak α my children Tor my pleasure, I have giveu them over for а little while to the hands
of the oppressor, but they have loved me—they have come before me, and offered up sacrifices , and shall I desert the land of the chosen, the sons of the glonous, my people Israel ' A universal outcry of sorrow, wrath, and tnumph followed this allusion to the national sufferings " Hoi exclaimed the figure " Men of Israel, hear the words of wisdom The burden of Rome By the swords of the mighty will I cause her multitude to fall, the terrible and the strong shall be on thee, city of the idolater, they shall hew off thy cuirasses, as the hewer of wood, and of thy shields, they shall make vessels of water There shall be fire in thy palaces and the sword Thy sons and thy daughters shall they consume, and thy precious things uhall be а spoil, when the king shall give the sign from the sanctuary He paused, and lifting up his fleshless arm, stood like а giant bronze pointing to the Temple To the utter astonishment of all, a vapour was seen to ascend from the summit of Mount Monah wreathing and white like the smoke that used lo mark the Daily Saonfice Our
first conception was, that this great interrupted nte was resumed, and the shout of joy was on our hps But the vapour had scarcely parted fiom the crown of the hill, when it blackened, and began to whirl with extraordnary rapidity it thenceforth less ascended than shot up, pti petit illy darkening and distending The hori /on grew dim, the cloudy canopy abo\e con tinued to spread and revolve, lightning btgan to quiver through, and we heard, at niterv ils, long low peals of thunder But no rain fell diid the wind was lifeless Nothing could be more complete than the calm, not a hair of oui heads was moved yet the heart of the countless multitude was penetiated with the dre ul of some impending catastiophe, that resttained every voice, and the silence itseli was twful In the climate of Jude ι we luu been accus touted to the r ipid r se and violent devastations oí tempests But tlie rising of this storm, so clost ly connecte ' with the appe trance of the stran b t, stimmoner, that it almost followed his comm md, imested a phenomenon, at all times fcuful, VOL III ι
with a character that might have struck firmer minds, than those of the enthusiasts round him To heighten the wonder, the progress of the storm was still faithful to the command Where ever this man of mystery waved his arm, there rushed a sheet of cloud. The bluest tract of heaven was black as night the moment he turned his ominous presence towards it, until there w аь no more sky to be obliterated, and, but for the fiery streaks that tore through, we should h we stood under a canopy of solid gloom At length the whirlwind that we had seen driving and rolling the clouds, like billows, burst upon us, roaring as it came, scattering fragments of the buildings far and wide, and cutting a broad way through the overthrown multitude Then superstition and terror were loud mouthed The populace, crushed and dashed down, exclaimed that a volcano was throwing up flame from the mount of the Tem pie, that sulphurous smokes were s ising through tlie crevices of the ground, that the rocking oi an earthquake was felt, and, still more terrible, that beings not to be lookod on, nor even to
be named, were hovering round them in the storm The general rush of the multitude in which hundreds were trampled down, and m which nothing but the most violent eftorts could keep any on their feet bore me iw iy for ι while The struggle was sufficient to absorb all my senses for nothing could be more perilous The dark ness was intense The peals of the storm w»re deafening, and the bowlings and fury ot the crowd, trampling and being trampled on, and fighting for life in blindness and despair, with hand, foot, and dagger, made an uproar louder than that of the storm In this conflict rather of demons than of men I was whirled away in eddy after eddy, until chante brought me again to the foot of the elevation There I beheld a new wonder A column of livid fire stood upon it, reaching to the clouds I could discern the outline of a human form within But while I expected to see ît drop dead, or blasted to a cinder, the flame spread over the ground, and I saw its strange inha bitant making signs like those of incantation

CHAPTER Χ The Roman troop had hitherto remained in stern composure The visitations of nature they were accustomed to sustain, tbe perturba¬ tions of a Jewish mob were beneath the no tice of the universal conquerors But the sight of the havock among their countrymen shook their stoicism, and the cavalry that formed the escort burst into indignant murmurs at the loud exultation of the multitude, until the commander of the troop, a young officer, whose arms and bearing showed him to be of the high est rank unable to restrain his feelings, spurred to tho front of the embarrassed mission ' How long,' exclaimed he, "senatore, shall
we stand here to be sculled it by these wretches ' The impenal guard feels itself disgraced by such a service Will you have the troop openly mutiny ' If they should ride away and leave us to ourselves, who could blame them 7 Decide what is to be done What will the noble Titus say, when we return to tell him that we stood by and listened to the taunts of those cooped-up slaves on him, the army, and Rome' But how long shall we be suffered even to listen ? Linger here, and before the day is out, before the hour is out, your lives will be at the mercy of those assassins And, by the immortal gods, richly shall we all de^er\ e our fate, for haung come mto this den but as masters, riding over the necks of those last and lowest of mankind " It was fortunate for the speaker that he spoke in a language but little known to our bold peasantry. The senators held their peace, and waited for the subsiding of the popular effervescence " Koble Sempromus," exclaimed the fiery ¿outh, to a grave and lofty countenanced man,
at the head of the mission " to remain here is only to risk vour s ifetv and the ho lour of the emperor Treaty with this [ copie ıs out of the question Give me the order to move now and I will be responsible for your security Or 11 ther give me the order to lisi erse this rabble and a single charge will decide the alfur He threw himself forward on his ho se s neck and fixed his look eagerly on the senator S countenance But the old Roman was tm moveable The magician who had stood with his robe wrapped round his arms in an attitude oí contemptuous ease awaiting the result of the demand burst into loud laughter The youi l soldiers indignation was roused by this ι tw object He turned to the scorner and cr) ng out Ha' is it you miscreant 7 you at le ist shall not escape me flung his tance full against his bosom I saw the weapon strike with ¡ ro digious force but it might as well have struck а rock It flew into splinters The Roman rushed at him with his drawn falchion His strange antagonist stood without moving a limb, and only raised his cold large
eye The charger, in hi» fiercest bound, in¬ stantly swerved* uid bad nearly unseated bis rider Nothing could bring Ьдт forward again femur and voice were useless The animal, a magnificent jet-black, of the largest Turcoman breed, strong as α bull and bold aa a lion, could not abide that stern eye He galloped madly round and round, but the attempt to orge hım against the stranger stopped him, a» tf Ue were stabbed Tuen, with every masele in his frame palpitating, his broad phest heaving;, his nostrils breathing out thick vapour, and the foam flying over his front like snow» he would plunge and roar, till, mastenng his powerful rider, be wheeled round, and darted away The shouts of scorn that rose from the po¬ pulace at every fresh failure doubly enraged the young Roman He made a final effort, and grasping the bridle in both hands, and dashing щ the spur, at length succeeded m forcing on the wearied charger The noble creatur« at qne immense leap reached the fated spot But there he was fixed, as if some power had trans formed huu into stone He no longer staggered
nor swer\ ed, but crouching down, with his feet thrust forward, his crest stooped, his nostrils on the ground, and bis brilliant eye strained and filmy, as if he were growing blind, stood gazing with a look of almost human horror The fu nous rider struck him on the head 4nth the flat of his falchion The charger gathered tip his limbs at the blow, reared straight as a column, and bellowing, plunged upon his forehead There was a general cry of terror even atììong the multitude, and they rushed forward to help him to nse But he rose no more He rolled over and over his rider, and ι tretching out his limbs with α convulsion, died The tumult was on the point of being re newed, for the soldiery pushed forward to bear away their officer who lay like a corpse ţ but the crowd had already covered the ground, and blows were given on both sides Indignant at the interruption of the armistice, and the in¬ jury that threatened the sacred person of atii bassadoTS, I forced my way through the crowd, and by exerting a strength with which few could cope, rescued the body of the young Roman,
and delivering it to the mission, protested against their construing the casual violence of rioters into the determination of the people ï had partially succeeded in calming their resentment, and in restrainmg the blood thirsty weapons that were already glittering in num berless bands, when u sound like that of a trumpet, distant, but blown with tremendous toree, struck ev erj ear at once The magician pointed to the heavens directly above his head A small fragment of cloud, that seemed to bave escaped ironi the mass of the tempest only to contrast with the bright¬ ness, was floating along the zenith He took up his parable " Have I not covered the heavens with а cloud ? saith the Mighty One. Have I not said to the sun, Be dark, and to the moon aud stars, Be ashamed ' Have I not luddeu mmc enemies ш the shroud, and said to the whirlwind, Go forth aud slay ? ' His gesture turned all eyes to the wrecks of the Roman camp, where the whirlwind conti nued to ravage and the thunders still roared. Then throwing himself forward, with a look
tull of wild grandeur, and ш a voice hollow and appalling as the storm, he exclaimed — ' Behold ' this day shall a wonder be wrought imong- von —tlm diy shall a mighty thing be brought to pass Kings shall see it, and trem¬ ble, yea, the heathen shall melt before thee Their strength shall be as water, and their hearts as the burning flax Sorrow slnll be on them, as the locust on the green field, and they shall flee as fiom a lion Behold ' in the cloud shall a sword be brandished before thee, in smoke and in fire shalt thou conquer For his angel shall come , and the sword nnd the (lame shall at this hour be a sign unto Israel ' ' Whether by tho proverbial sagacity of the wanderers ot the desert, by knowledge from some darker source, or simply by one of those coincidences which so curiously come to sublain the credit of daring conjecture, the little orbed vapour began to lengthen, and rapidly assumed the shape ot a sword ' Dreading the popular power of imposture, and the uees to which it would inevitably be applied, I was glad that this extraordinary
benig had thus put himself upon his tnul and I stood gazing in euger expectation that some passing gust would dissipate at once the cloud, and the reputation of the prophet Yet, utterly scorning the common pretensions of the rambling proctisers of forbidden arts, I knew that awful things had beta done, that, most of all in these latter days of our country, strange influences were let loose, perhaps to plunge into deeper rum a people guiltily prone to take refuge ш delusions I had heard prophecies hideous and unholy, yet which were never taught by man, I had seen a command of the elements thit ut terly defied philosophy to account for them If, in the last vengeance of Heaven, evil spirits were ever suffered to go forth and give their power to evil men, for the purpose of binding m the faster chains of falsehood a race who loved a lie, it was m those hours of signs antl wonders, that might, if possible deceive the very elect To my astonishment, the cloud suddenly changed its colour from white it became in tensely rtd, and, m a few moments more, it burst into a flame, that threw a broad reflection
upon the whole atmosphere It was, palpably a vast falchion of fire—the centre of а fiery halo. And irom that hour to the last of the glorious and unhappy city of David, that flaming sword, the sign of wrath predicted a thousand years before, blazed day and night over Jerusalem ' But its uiftant effect was terrible. The mul¬ titude, already indignant against the Romans, and restrained only by my desperate efforts, were now roused to the highest pitch of pre¬ sumption. To doubt of the help of Heaven was impiety, after this open wonder to spare an hour between this divine command and the extermination of the idolaters, was sacrilege. They poured round the unfortunate troop, and lustantiy overwhelmed them, as an earthquake would have overwhelmed them. A mass of human life, deuse as the ground it trod upon, broke over thein The Romans struggled he¬ roically I saw their charges often make fearful w ay, and their swords aud lances dnppmg with blood eveiy time that they were whirled round their heads But the conflict was too unequal one by one those brave men were torn

Iu the nervousness of the time, and doubtful from what region of earth or air my antagonist ш that place of spelle might come, I drew my dagger with a sensation that I had never telt in the field, and setting my hook against the wall, stood on my defence. But α groau and α fall at my feet made me sheathe the weapon, and ascertain how far I could relieve the sufferer. I raised him from the ground, and by the moon light recognised
the commander of the escort The dying struggles of his charger had crushed him, and tho multitude, too busy to try whether life was or was not totally extinguished, abandoned him to his fate. To leave him where he was, was to leave him to perish I owed something to the survivor of the unfortunate mission, and my short con¬ sultation closed, by carrying him on my shoulders to the door of my comfortless dwelling The Roman had formidab'y learned to dis¬ trust Jewish fidelity The gloom inside the entrance, looked the very colour of secret murder, and during the tune of his transit from the market place, he hid found leisure to couclude that he was the virtim of but a more dexterous assassin, who wished to join the profit of plunder to the nitional pleasure of revenge Hven the dismantled appearance of the exterior was enough for suspicion, and he firmly ordered that I should terminate my good offices at the threshold Irritated and insulted by his obvious meaning, I left him to his wish, and placmg him ш the fullest enjoyment of such secunty as

Yet, heroism and hard- hear ted ness '—I could not join them I had still something to learn, and the gny plnloso- phtr of the sword lost grcind with me I was retiring for the night, when I felt the soft hand of Miriam on my shoulder. " I hav t been anxious," said she, " to ask your opinion about this Roman " Her fine countenance, that reflected every tmotion of her spirit like a mirror, showed that the subjett was one ot deep interest " Is misfortune alwajs to pur¬ sue us, Saiatlnel '" " In what possible shape at pit sent' ' said I "We have spent some hours is amusing as I ever lemember What can have occurred since this morning, when your plulo sophy m ide so light of our actual ev Us '" " Тог,* t \tt rnal evils I have but little feeling," was her answt r " but I set in the chance that brought Septimius here to night something of the fate

fully visible, in midnight was tremendous. A blade, of the deepest hue of gore, stretched over the vast horizon, pouring from its edge perpe¬ tual streams and showers of crimson flame, that looked like showers of fresh blood. Boundless slaughter was in the emblem. Beyond it the circle of the sky was wan, the stars sickened, and the moon, though at the full, hung like an orb of lead The mighty falchion, the pledge of a terrible and inevitable judgment, extinguished all the beneficent splendours of heaven " There, there is the Sign that I have sten for months in my dreams," said Miriam, nt an awed \oite, " that has haunted me whenever I laid my head upon my pillow , that has bteii before mo in the day, wherever I mo\td , that I have seen colouring every object, evtry mo nient oi my lift, since I entered theso luted walls I have struggled to drive away the horrid image, I have wept and prayed But it was where nothing could unfix it.

The woe of millions, the blood of α nation, the ruin of the glorious fabric built by the hands of the Eternal for his glory and the good of mankind, the fall of Israel, is written
in letters of flame before our eyes, and can I complain of the chances and hazards which may fall to my share ' Henceforth, my husband and my love," and she threw herself into my willing arms, " you shall never be disturbed with my griefs, exercise your own powerful understand¬ ing, guard against evil by your talents and knowledge of hie, as far as it can be guarded against by man, and beyond that, disdain to repine or fear In my supplication I have committed our child into the hands of Him who sitteth on the circle of eternity ' Quivering with every finer feeling ot the heart, maternal love, matron iaith, and grateful adoration, she hung upon my neck until as if A portion oi her noble spirit had passed mto mine, I felt ι confidei ce and consolation like hei own
CHAPTER XII I WAS spared the ungraciousness of urging the young soldier's departure, for when I met him iitìxt morning, his first topic was the means of escape He had been since day-break examining from my turrets the accessible pas¬ sages of the fortifications, and had even, by the help of a peasant, despatched a letter to his friends, requesting either a formal demand of his person from the Jews, or some private eflort to extricate him But, with the night the glow of soldiership was gone In the fall of his charger he had been violently bruised. He complained of in¬ ward suffering, and his pallid face and feeble
words gave painful proof that he had much still to undergo Though even if he were per fectly recovered, the crowded battlements, and the popular rage, showed the impossibility of immédiat ι return Three days passed thus drearily At home I was surrounded bv sickness, or vexed by suspicion, the worse sickness of the mmd Sep timius lay in his chamber, struggling to laugh, talk, and read away the heavy hours , and, finally like all such strugglers, giving up the task in despair his ideas were in the Roman camp He professed gratitude of the deepest nature ior the service that I had done him now ior the second time, " if saving so unimportant a life was a service either to him or any one else Λ et he almost wished that he bad been left v, lit re he was found A man could not finish his cour&e better than among his gallant com lades , and with all his anxiety to return he felt no trivial concern as to the view which Titus might take of the whole unfortunate affair Of justice he was secure, but, to be questioned for his military conduct, was in itself a degra-
dation The loss of Sempromus too, a most confidential friend and councillor of the Empe¬ ror, would weigh heavily,—while there was nothing but his own testimony to sustain his honour agiinst the crowd of secret enemies, which every man of military rank was cert un to have In short," said he, " on my sleepless conch, I have turned true penitent for the loobsh curiosity, or boyish desire, of mining mysell with public matters, or extravagant ilin sion, which prompted me to volunteer, nay, solicit the command of an escort, which would have been by right put under the care of some mere tribune " I tried to cheer him, by saying that his had been only the natural desire of an active mmtl to see so singular a scene as our tity offered, or the honourable wish of а soldier to be fore¬ most wherever there was any thing to be done " It was more than either, ' said he, " there was actual illusion in the case I now feel that I was practised upon. You know the strange concourse of all kinds of people that follow a
tamp for all kinds of purposes —Plunderers, traders, and jugglers, crowding on our move¬ ments, as regularly as the crows, and with nearly the same objetts For a week past, I had found myself beset by an old, gibbering slave of this class Wherever 1 rode, the fellow was before my eyes, he contrived to mingle with my servants, and became a soit of favour¬ ite, by selling them counteifeit rings and gems at ten times their ν due The wretch was clever too, and as my ttnt hours began to be disturbed by the unusual gaiety of the listeners to his hes, I ordered him to be flogged out of the lines But twelve hours had not passed, before I found him gamboling again, and was about to order the instant infliction of the dis cipime, when ho threw himself on the ground, and implored " a moment of my secret ear ' Conceive who the fellow was r ' ' The impostor that harangued in the square ' " The very man. He told me that there were certain contrivances on foot, to bring me into disfavour - th the general, which I knew to be
the fact He gave me the names of the parties, which I felt to be sufficiently probable, and finished by saying, that having so long eaten of my bread, (a week,) and enjoyed my liberality, (the pron ise of the whip,) he longed to show his grati tude, by giving me an opportunity of putting my enemies to silence on the spot This opportunity was, to solicit the command of the escort required for the mission How he gained his wisdom, I know not, but I took the advice, weut instantly to Titus, found that an armistice was being debated m council, that there was some difficulty in the choice of an officer for a service, by no means likely to be a sinecure m point of either judgment or hazard, stepped forward, and, to the surprise of eiery body, disclaimed the privileges of my rank, and insisted on marching at the head of this hand ful this centurion's guard, into the formidable caty of Jerusalem ' " His object of course was your destruction I now see the cause of the harangue that roused the people, he «as in the pay of the conspi rators against you Yet, his appearance was
striking there was a vigour about his look and language, a fierce consciousness of power some¬ where, that distinguished him from his race He came too, au disappeared, without my being able to discover whence or whither ' " Oh, the commonest contrivance of his trade. Those fellows always come and go in a cloud, if they can lie was probablj beside you half the d iy, before and after You saw how little he thought of the lance that I sent to bring out his secrets He doubtless wore a corslet Otherwise there would have been one juggler the less in the world The truth is, I havr been duped, hut I have made up my mind to think nothing about the dupery The slave is cer timly clever, perhaps to an extraordinary de gree—a knave undoubtedly, and of the first magnitude But he has the secret of the cabal against me , ind that secret makes him at once fit to be employed, and dangerous to be pnuoked The blow of the lance yester¬ day showed him that I am not always to he trilled with In tact, prince, you might find it advantageous to employ him occasionally
yourself It was he who conveyed my letter to the camp this morning '" My look probably expï cssed my alarm at this species of envoy " You may rely on my honour," said the Ro man, " not to involve you in any of the fellow's inventions Slippery as he is, I have a hold on him too, that he will not venture to shake oft". And now, to let you into full confidence, I expect Ium back this very mght, when he will relieve vour city of an inhabitant unworthy of remammg among so polished a people, and jour house, my prince, of an inmate, than whom none on earth can be more grateful for your hospitality " He concluded this mixture of levity, address, and frankness, with a smile, and in a tone ot elegance, that compelled me to take it all on the more favourable side But against suffering the step of his strange emissary to pollute the threshold in which I lived, I expressed my plain determination " For that too I have provided," said he " My intercourse with the reprobate is to tako
place at another quarter of the city, a^ far as possible, and he laughed, " for reasons equally of mine ind yours, from this dwelling I have managed matters so as not to compromise any of my fnends, and, to make mj arrangements on that point still more secure, may I express a wish that neither Constantius nor any other per son of your house may be acquainted will r»iy intention of leaving them, and, I may sincerely say, leiving every thing that could gratify my best feelings,—this very evening ' This was an easy and graceful avoidunce of the difficulties which his longer residence threatened I gave him the promise of secrecy, cautioning him against reposing any dangerous confidence in his emissary, of whom I had an irrepressible abhorrence, and was about to leave the chamber, when he caught my hand, and said in unusual emotion— " Prince of Naphtah, I have but one word more to say You are a man of the world, and can make allowance for the giddiness of human passions Some of them are uncon¬ trollable, or at least, which I have never learned
to control, and in me perhaps belong to infe riority of mind But if, on my departure, you should hear с dummes aguıııst me— " Impossible, my young fnend, or if I should, you may rely on my giving tho calum¬ niators a veiy brief answer " Or, if even yourseli should he disposed to think severely of me ,—you know the tireum stauces under which α man of birth aud fortune must be placet!, in our profession " I do and am much more disposed to regret than to wonder at the consequences "If you should hear thut] had been issulod ııı an evil hour, by an unexpected temptation which I h id long lubom ed to rt bist , ass tiled by it under the most powerful circumstances thai eiei yet tasked the human mind , circumstance s to which, from the beginning of the world wisdom has been proverbially folly, and résolu tion weakness , if it should have mastered my whole being·—spirit, feoul, and body , if I were willing to give up the brightest prospects for its possession—to hazard life, hope, honours— The thought of Esther smote me I started
irom hım where he stood with hts fine head drooping like the Antinous and his figure the very emblem of passionate dejection Roman you are here as my guest and as such I have listened to you with patience until now But il any member of iny family is concerned in uhat you sty I desire in the most distinct terms that the subject shall be mentioned no more The daughters ot Israel are sacred Nt\er shall a child of mine wed with those who now lord it over my un h ıppy country He spread his hands and eyes in the broadest lstonishment Prince, can it be possible that \ou have so totally mistaken me My perplexi tics ire of an entirely different nature Do me justice I liugh at the triflings of bumun pas sion as unworthy of men of torninoli sense And allowing as every man of taste must allow the beauty of the fem iles of your distinguished house believe me that I have been too busy with matters of painful interest to h tie given more thin а g' ance to their unquestionable at tractions Now, let us understund euch other as soldiers and men of honour —Ihe chain with
which I am bound is not of roses, but of iron, a chain of invisible, yet stern infli'ences, that haurt my night, and even iny day Right glad should I be, to find myself free enough from that hideous bond, to be capable of admiring the beauty of woman " His voice faltered, and he turned away with a shudder, as from a visionary tormentor " What ' has that accursed dealer in spells, that man of desperate arts, if he be man, m volved you too in his net 7 I know the super stitions of your country, and how deeply they darken the understanding But dares the im postor soar so high ' He shook from head to foot, and clasped his hands with the violence of despair " You saw how he defied, how he mocked at me, how he spurned me when my abhorrence rose to the madness of attempting to strike Ium I might as well have flung the weapon at the clouds You saw the instinctive terror of my charger That animal was celebrated in our whole cavalry for its bold, nay, furious, spirit. Yet before the eye of that man of power and evil, it
cowered like a hare, and died of his glance By him the temptation has been offeied, of its nature I dare not speak, but it is dazzling, fearful, and must, I feel it,—must finally be fatal " " Then cast it from you at once Be a man —a hero " " It is hopeless—I must be the victim, 1 am hound irretrievably —Farewell, prince, we shall see each other no more." He flung himself upon the couch I offered bim assista ice advice, consolation, in vain The spirit of the soldier was extinguished The victim of fantastic illusion lay before me I left him to the care of tbe old domestic, and when I closed the door, thought that I had closed the door oí the grave

capable of being counteracted as tbe hostility of the plague After my final conversation with Septimius I had spent the day in one of those perplexing deliberations, and was returning with a weary heart, when, in an obscure street leading to the Upper City, I was roused from my reverie by tho sound of one of our mountain songs, Music has been among my cbiei solaces through existence, and the song of Naphtah at that moment of depression keenly moved me. I stopped to listen, m front of the minstrel s tent, in which a circle of soldiers and shepherds from the Galileos were sitting over their cups His skill deserved a higher audience He touched his httì ч harp with elegance, to a voice that re¬ minded me of the sportiveness and wild melody of a bird m spring The moon light shone through the tent, and, as the boy sat under the largo white folds m the fantastic dress of his art, α loose vermilion robe, belted with sparkling btones and turban of yellow silk, that drooped upon his shoulder like a golden pinion, he re-
sembled the Persian pictures of the Peri em bosomed in the bell of the lily The rude and dark featured listeners round hım might well have sat for the swart demons submissive to bis will But thoughts soon returned that were not to be soothed by music, and throwing some pieces of money to the boy, I hastened on The departure of the young Roman, and the influence that it might have on my family, and peculiarly on the mind of a creature doubly endeared to me by a strange and melancholy similitude to the temper of my own excitable mmd deeply occupied me, and it was even with some presentiment of evil that I reached home The first sound that I heard was the lamen¬ tation of the old domestics But I could not wait to solve their unintelligible attempts to ex plain the disaster I flew to my family Mi¬ rtam was absorbed in profound sorrow, Salome was in loud affliction Dreading eveiy thing that could be told me, yet with that sullen har¬ dihood winch long misfortune gives, I took my wife s hands, and, in a voice struggling for com-
posure, desired her to tell me the worst it once "Esther is gone'" was her answer Sht could articulate no more, the effort to speak this shook her whole frame But Salome broke out into loud reprobution of the baseness of the v\ retch who hid tumed our hospitality mto α sn ire, md whose life, twice saved, was employed oniy to bring misery on his preservei The blow fell upon me with the keenness of a sword "Was Esther, was my daughter, my innocent, darling Esther, consenting to this flight ? ' " I know not said Miriam " I dare not ask mjsolf the question If she can have for gotten her duty, to follow the stranger, if she cin have lelt her pirents'—no, it must hive been through some horrid artifice But the thought is too bitter Raise no more such thoughts in my mind She sank in silence But Salome was not to be restrained She asserted the total impossi¬ bility of Esther s having thrown off her allegi once to re ligion and filial duty " She must
have been either, ' s nd this generous and en thubi istic bt mg, " subjected to those dreadful arts ш which the idolaters deal, and deluded by visions aud evil powers, or carried away by at tual force Constantius has gone already in search of her , feeble as he is, he determined to disco\ er the robbers, and though his steps were tottering, and the effort may hazard his life, he would not be restrained, nor would I ìestram him, where I should ha\e so much rejoiced to hazard my own " I lose to depart Мшат clung to me ' Must ï lose all, Salatine! ? I am the guilty one, wife' I should hive gu irded against this I alone am to blame — Those tears reproach me more deeply than all the words ш the world —I will recover Esther Without her we all should be miserable. The Romau general is just I will demand her oi Septimius in his presence Мшат ' you shall sì e your child Salome ' you shall see your sister And now, come to my heart—come both, my last hope of happiness, the remnant of all that once promised to fill my declining
days with peace and prosperity —Weep no more, Miriam' Salome' I must not be un¬ manned at this time of trial Go to your chambers, and pray for me —Farewell i It was nearly midnight, and tho city sounds Were hushed, except where the crowds, which still poured in, struggled for their quarters The very fear of being thus disturbed kept up the disturbance of the population, and in the leading avenues the tents showed fierce watchers against this violence, sitting round their tables until wine either sent them to sleep, or roused them mto daggers drawing Subordination was at an ead, plunder and blood were to be dreaded by every man who ventured among those cham pions of freedom and property , and more than once this night I was compelled to show that I wore а weapon But the disorder which left the city α seat of dissolute not, was not suffered to interfere with the actual defence That singular mixture of rabble giddiness and sacred care, which distm guiehed my countr)men above all nations was fully displayed in those final hours ; aud the
walls that enclosed a million of rioters and rob- beis, were guarded with the solemn vigilance of a sanctuary No argument could prevail with the peasantry at the gate to let me pass My rank, and even my public name, went for little in the scale, against the possibility of my renewing the treaty with an enemy whom tbey now scorned, and I was doubting whether I must not lose the night by the reluctance of those rough but honest sen¬ tinels, when I was cheered by seeing one of the head men of their tribe arrive He had been a funous politician, honour and honesty were his declared worship, and his horror of humbler irotives was fierceness itself This was enough for me I knew what public vehemence means I took him aside, without ceremony put gold into his grasp, and saw the gate thrown open before me by the immaculate hand of the pa tnotic Jonathan But whilel had scarcely congratulated myself on having passed this formidable bârnei, and was still within the defences, the trampling
of horse echoed on the road. The night was clear, aud there was no hope of avoiding them, enclosed as I was with walls A lurge body of Idumeau horsemen came on, escorting waggons of provision. The foremost riders were half asleep, and I was in strong hope of eluding them all, when one of the drivers, 11 fhe wan touncss of authority laid his whip on me I rashly returned the blow, and the man fell oil bis horse insensible I was surrounded, charged with murder, was brought before their chief* tain, and iound that chieftain, Onias' My old enemy recognised me instantly , and, with undying revenge bring every feature, de maiided whither I was going " To the Roman camp," was the direct an s wer " The purpose 7 " " To have an interview with the Roman ge nera! ' " You come deputed by the authorities' " By not one of them " " I Ions; ago knew you to be a bold fellow,
but you exceed my opinion We cannot spare heroes from Jerusalem at this time, so you must turu back with us By what right ? By tbe right of the stronger W ıth what object ' fint you may be h inged as a deserter It will srvc you the trouble of going to fitus to be lnu D cd аь a spy I disdained reply and in tht midst oi а tinle of barbarı ins exulting over their capture as if thty hul tiken the chief e emy of the state was marched back to the walls Theie I w ıs not the only person disturbed by the idventnre The first glimpse of me caught by the captain of the night exhibited every thing that could be ludicrous in the shape of consternation To tbe inquiries howl was huilered to pass he answered by an appeal to his honour, which he agam valued in my pre sence too as the most invaluable possession of the citizen soldier He said the words with out a blush, and I even listened to them without a smile He probabiy trembled a little for his
bribe But be soon discovered by my look, that I considered the money as too far gone to be worth pursuing Yet Onias, who seemed to know him as well as I, fixed on bun a scrutinizing aspect, of all others the most hateful to a delicate conscience , and bis only resource was to heap opprobrium upon me. How I had contrived to escape the guard, said Jonathan, " was totally incon ceivable, unless it was by—' I gave him an assuring glance—" by imposing on the credulity of some of the ignorant peasants, possibly even by direct corruption But, to put that matter out of future possibility, he would proceed to examine the prisoner s person He proceeded accordingly, and from my sash took my purse, as a public precaution He was α vigilant guardian of the state, for the purse was never restored Onias looked at him, during his harangue, with a countenarce between contempt and ridicule "I must go forward now, said he, " but, captam, see to yonr pnsoner He must answer
before the council to-morrow, and as you have so worthily disabled him from operations with the guard, your own head is answerable for hie safe keeping " My enemy, to make all sure, himself saw me marched within the tower over the gate, comforted his soul by a part¬ ing promise that my time was come, and rode off with his Idumeans—to the boundless satis¬ faction of the scrupulous and much alarmed Jonathan The tower was massive, and there was no probability that any thing less than α Roman bnttenng-rdm would ever lay open its solid sides Tbe captain had recovered his virtue at the instant of my losing my purse, and I now could no more dream of sapping his integrity, than of sapping the huge blocks of the tower Whether 1 was to be prisoner for the night or for the siege, or to glut the axe by morn¬ ing, were questions which lay m the bosom of as implacable a villain, аз long-delayed revenge ever made malignant, but whit was to become of my child, of my family, of my share in the great cause, for which alone life was of value *
The chamber to which I was consigned wis at the top of tlie tower, and overlooked a vast extent of country Before me were the Ro man camps seen clearly in the moon light, and wrapt m silence, except when the solitary trumpet sounded the watch or the heavy treid ol а troop going its rounds was heard The city sounds were but the murmurs of the sink ing tide of the multitude The Spring was m her glory The air came fresh and sweet from the fields All was tranquillity, yet what a miss of destructive power was lying motionless under that tranquillity ' Fire sword, and man, were before me, elements of evil that a touch could rouse into tempest not to be allayed but by torrents of blood, and the ruin of empii es
CHAPTER XI\ Whih my mind was wandering a*ay m tl oughts of the madness of ambition in so brief a being us man I heard а loud climour of voices m the chimbéis below The rustic guaiti hod been enjoying themselves but their wme w ıs already out ind thty set their fices boldlv agnnst ihe disciplino which pretended to limit tin w mi of patriots so ťan and thirsty Ihc elaniour trose from ihe discovery tint the cell trs of the tower had been examined by α previous guirtl w' э provided for the temper anee oí their success >rs, by taking the whole tempt ition to themselves High words followed between the abettors of discipline and the parti
sans of the bottle, and if my door were but un barred, I might have expeditiously relieved the oaptain of his charge But its bolts were enormous, and I tned lock and panel in vain As I was giving up the eflort, a light foot step ascended the stairs, a key turned in the ponderous wards, and the minstrel of the tent stood before me. " If you wish to escape from certam death, ' he whispered, " do as I bid you." He looked from the casement, sang a few notes, and, on being answered from without, pulled up a rope, which we hauled in together. The task was of some difficulty, but at length a weighty hamper appeared, loaded with wine He took a portion of the contraband ireight in bis arms, and without a word disappeared. I heard his welcome proclaimed below with loud applause Half the guard were instantly on the stairs to assist him down with the remainder, but against this he firmly protested, and threatened, in case of а single attempt to interfere with his opera¬ tions, that he would awake the captam, and pub-
hely give back the keys of this incomparable private cellar to the legitimate hand The threat was effective, the unludiug of the ham¬ per was left to his own dexterity, and at length but one solitary flask lay before us " You deserve some payment for your trou ble," said be, with the careless and jovial air of Ins brethren " Here's to your night's enter¬ prise, whatever it be/ pouring out a few drops and tastingthem, while heforced a large draught upon me " And now good night my prince, unless you love the tower too much to take leave of this gallant guard by a window " " But, boy, if you are detected in assisting my escape'" " Oh ' I have been detected m all sorts oi irolics in my time, and yet here 1 am The truth is, prince, I have travelled m your conn try, and have an old honour for your name No later than to day you gave me the hand somest present I have got since I came within the walls. I know the noble captain below stairs to be a thorough rogue, and the mighty Onias to want nothmg for wickedness, but the
opportunity ш short, the thought occurred to me on seeing you, to ramble into the guani house, help the honest revellers below to α little moie wine than is good for their understandings, this contraband allair being а commodity m which, between ourselves, I deal, and furthtr, break the laws by assisting you to leave cap tam, sentinels, persecutor, and all, behind.— Now, if you value youi life, be tie s 1st tite tor the empty flasks, get into tl is 1 per ι 1 make jour way through the air 1 ke a l r l In two inmutes I sh ill be safe ei о 1 \oi need have no fears for me." I coiled the rope iound а beam, that my weight might not bring it down too suddtnly , foiced myself through the narrow window, and launched out mto air, at a height of α hun died feet But if I felt any distrust, it was brief I was rapidly loweied down, passing the successive casements, in which I saw the successive watches of the guard drinking, sleep ing, singmg, and discussing public affairs with village rationality Luckily no eye turned upon the fugitive, and the ground was touched at last
In another moment the mmstrel came, rather flying than sliding, down the rope I s ud something m acknowledgment of this service But he I ud his finger on his lip, and pointing to the rampirt, wheie α moving lamp showed lhat we were still within observation, leti mt thiough piths beset with thickets that no eye could penetrate, but, as he said " that of а sup plici ofgarr ons tl o Inband" But their mtncacy ofl red no I str etion to this stnp 1 ng , and atter a 1 mself with my per ploxities, he le 1 to tl t rgc of the pi un ( I have It elo said he, " in these bi ambles, fui tic lo He pirpose of avoiding the look out fro tl 1 ttle icnts, and of gn ing the moon time to hide hei blushing beauties She lay retldt mug with the mists on the hori zon " She Ins been often called our mother , and, as children of the moon, the minstrels are allowed the privilege of keeping later hours, ami being madder than the mob oi mankind But like outer children, we are sometimes engaged in matters which would dispense with the ma ternal eye, and to night, between assisting the
Galileans to their wine, and cheating them of their prisoner, I wished that she was many a iuthom below the ocean " Mother, said he throwing himself into an attitude, and pouring u gush of harmony from his little harp, " take а child s blessing, and begone The words wire ьрокеп to α kind of tune rambling, but singularly sweet " Do you know, said he with a sigh, as he turnt d and saw me gazmg in admiration of his skill, " I am weary to death of my profession " " Then, why not leave it ? you are fit for better things, your accomplishments are of the very nature that make their way in society " Why not leave it 7 Oh, for a hundred rea sons In the first place, I should be more wearied of every other I should be the bird in the cage, fed, sheltered, and possibly a favourite—But what bird would not rather take the chance oi the open air even to be beat by the storms of summer, and frozen by the winter's chill' No let me clap my pinions, and sing my song under the free canopy of tbe skies, or be voiceless, ond wingless, and—dead '
" Boy, this ıs the natural language of your years But the time must come when the spirit sinks, and man requires other charms in life than the power of roaming The common change of nature which compels us in the davs of sun-shine to provide for winter, is only a forewarning of the time when life shall require rest, an assured shelter, ami the presence of human beings who feel an interest m us. The wanderer comes at last, a broken hearted de¬ pendant, to solicit the alms of men who, with¬ out a spark of his genius, had the common sense to follow the track beaten for them by mankind " He made no answer, but hung his head over the harp, and let his fingers stray among the strings The moons edge was now touching the mountains "We must be gone," said I, "but, as I insist on your not exposing yourself to further hazard, remember to look for me within a few days in Jerusalem I owe you something for your night's service, which, if you are willing, shall be repaid by taking you into my house-
hold, should the siege be raised, if not, jou are but as you were * He was all nervous perturbation at the offer wept luughed, danced, rang а prelude upon the strings. Kissed my hand and finally bounded away before me I called to him, repeating my wish that he should go no further Impossible, said he, " you would be lost m α moment If I had not crossed the ground hundreds of times, I should never be able to And my road Half a mile forward, it is aH rampart, trench, and ravine You would be stopped by a mynal of sentinels Why, no thing on earth could get to the foot of yonder hills near as they seem, but an army —or a minstrel Remonstrance was hopeless, for he ran on before me, and ran with a rapidity that tasked even my foot to follow We soon came into the fortified ground, and I then felt his value He led me over fosse and rampart, up the scarp and through the palisade, with the sagacity of instinct But this was not all I repeatedly ¡«iw the sentinels within a few feet of us and
eipected to be challenged every moment , but not a syllable was heard I passed, with patrols of the legionary horse on either side of me, still not a word I walked through the rows of tents, in which the troops were np, and pre paring for the duties of the morning Not an eye fell upon me, and I almost began to believe myself, like a bero of the old fables, covered with a cloud The boy still continued racing along, u itti он reaching the summit of a mound at somd dis tance m front of me, he uttered a cry, and fell I had heard no challenge, and conceiving that his fall was accidental, hurried towards him A flight of arrows whizzed over my head and the black visages of a mob of Ethiopian riders came bouncing up a hollow beside me It was not my purpose to fight, even if I had any hope of success against marksmen who could hit an elephant s eye I called out tor quarter in every language of which I was capable But the Ethiopians only shook their woolly heads, laid hands on me, and began an
investigation of my riches, creditable to polished society Barbarians, with a tongue and phy siognomy worihy only of their kindred baboons, probed every plait of my garments, with an accuracy that could ha^ с been surpassed only in the most civilised custom houses of the em pire A succession of shrieks, which I mistook for rage, but which were the mirth of those sons of darkness, were the prelude to measures which augured more formidable consequences than the rifling of a man who had already undergone rifling by a professor A rope was thrown over my arms, and I was led towards the outposts Yet even the neighbourhood ot t'teir Roman friends did not seem the most congenial to my captors More than one con sulfation was held, in which their white teeth were bared to the jaw with rage, and their scimitars were whirled like so many flashes of lightning about each others turbans, before they could decide, whether my throat was to be cut on the spot to get rid of an encumbrance, or they were to try how far the emptiness of
my puise might not be made up to them by the reward for the capture of a =py in the trappings of α chieftain I gave up remonstrance, where, if I had all the tongues of Babel, none of them seemed likely to answer my purpose, and reserving the nice distinction between an ambassador and a spy for more cultivated ears, quietly walked onward in the midst of this ragged troop of thieves tbe moie insensible to honesiy or argument, as they were thieves privileged according to law But our approach to the camp bred another difficulty Tbe t-oop felt an obvious dismclina tion to come too close to the legionaries What¬ ever was tbe produce of their ìovmgs, might l>e inquired mto, end retained for the honour of justice and the benefit of its servants Un¬ tutored as the negroes were, they had acquired α know ledge of the latitude of the official con sen nee, and bowed to the mastery of the white in plunder, as in the other accomplishments ot an advanced age All could not venture to the camp, yet who was to be intrusted with the general interest,
so far as receiving the reward ? The discussion was carried on chiefly by gesture, which some¬ times proceeded to blows, antl at last wus wound up to such vigour, that a brawny ruffian, to preserve the peate, seized the rope, and drag¬ ging me out ot the circle, began sharpening his scimitar ou lus knife, to cut iny throat with the more certainty, and at once extinguish the con- troversy But, at the instant, α horrid outcry arose, and α figure, hideous beyond conception, not α foot high, blacker than the blackest, and darting flames from its mouth, bounded in among us, mounted upon a wild heust of a horse, that kicked and tore at every thing. The Ethio¬ pians shrieked with terror, and were scattered on all sides at the first shock , the ground w as so cut up hy the military operations, that they stumbled at every step, some were unhorsed , some lay desperately kicked and bitten, some probably had their necks broken, mid others carried home the tale to spiead it through the lantl of lions I heard it long after, exciting the utmost amaze ш a venerable circle sitting, round one of the fountauis of the Nile.
I was saved from being thus summarily made the victim of peace, but was as far as ever from freedom While I was endeavouring to loose the rope, a patrol of the legionary horst came galloping from the camp , md I was taken, with this badge of a bad character upon me But the flying negroes were tie mort amusing object There was just light enough to see them running and rolling about the plain, turbans flying off m the an , aud the few riders who coultl boast of keeping their seats, whirled awa_y over brake and brier, at the mercy ot then maddened horses Thn» display, which had been, at first, taken for the prelude to an assault on the lines, was now а source of pleas mtry , and the horsemanship oi the savages was ho noured with manv a ro ir My case с ime next under consideiation ' I was found at the edge of the Roman intrench ments, where to be found was to die, I was besides taken with the mark of reprobation upon me But I pleaded my own merits loudly, und appealed to the rope as evidence that I was not there by my own will The legion-
aries were better soldiers than logicians, ind my defence perplexed them until some pro founder one thought of inquiring, what brought me there at all The troop flocked round to hear how I should rebut this overwhelming question 1 mentioned my pu. pose in a few words The scale again turned in my favour, and I began to think victory secure, when a young Standard bearer, who was probably destined to rise in the state, declared, with a splenetic tongue and brow of office, that " m this day of cheating, too much precaution could not be adopted against cheats of all colours, that the more plausible my story was, the more likely it was to be a fabrication, that I might have volunteered my captivity only to give weight to my fabrication, and that, finally, as my escape might do some kind of mischief, while my hang ing could do none whatever, it was advisable— to hang me without delay " The orator spoke the words of popularity, and my fate was sealed But a new difficulty arose By whom was the sentence to be put in
execution , lor the duty would have sullied the legionary honour for life The demur was per¬ plexing , but the dignity of the cavalry must at all events be preserved A trampled African, who lay groaning in α ditch beside me, caught the sound of the debate, dragged himself out, and offered, mangled as he was, to perform the office for any sum that their generosity might think proper. Never was man nearer paying the grand debt, than I was at that moment The African recovered his vigour as by magic, and the young statesman took upon himself the supermtendance of this service to his country I was not idle, and raised my voice against this violence to a "negociator," but the troopers of the Imperial horse had been roused from their sleep on my account, and they were not to return, liable to the ridicule of having been roused by a false alarm While I still endea¬ voured to put off the evil hour, the trampling of a large body of cavalry was heard "The General ' ' exclaimed the young officer, who evidently bad an instinctive sensibility to the approach of rank.
" Let litus come, said I, ' or any man ot nonour and /lewill undeistand me I tore the badge of disgrace from my arms, antl stepped iorward to meet the great son of Vespasian My look of confidence alarmi d lho troop, and the Standard boaier made way for u man who dared to speak to the heir of the throne But the gcnerul was not Titus a bio id brutal countenance, red with excess, glared haughtily round I caught his eye, and he suddenly turned pale a whisper from one oi the oihcers put bun in possession of the circumstances, and he rode up to me " So, rebel ' you are come to this at last You have been taken m the fact and must undergo your natural fate * I demand tn be led to your general I scorn to defend m j seli before interiors "Inferiors' hc bit his livid lip " Traitor, you ore not now on the lull of Scopes, at the head of an army I recognised Cestius " Nor you, said I * on the plain, at the head of an army t and so much the more fortunate for both you and them —But I scorn to talk to men whoee backs
I huve seen. Lead me to your master, fu¬ gitive' The troops, unaccustomod to this plam speak¬ ing in presence of the tyrant of the legions, looked on with wonder. Cestui* himself was staggered » but the nature of the man soou re¬ turned , and in a voice of fury, he ordered a body of Arab archers, who were seen moving at a distance, to be brought up for the extinction ol a " traitor unworthy of a Roman sword." The Arabs, exhilarated at tho prospect of reward, came up shouting, tossing their lances, and shooting their arrows. As a last resource, İ solemnly protested against this murder, which I pronounced to be the work of а revenge dis¬ graceful to the nume of soldier, and, taunting Cestius with his defeat, demanded that, if lie doubted my honour, he should try, on the spot, which of our swords was the better. He answered my taunt only by a glare ot rage, and a gesture to tli <-liers, who instantly threw themselves into < half circle round me, with the expertness of proficients in the trade of justice, and bended their bows. I was de-
termined to resist to tbe last, and Hung out up braidings and scorn upon the murderer, which drove him to hide his head behind the troops, when another disturbance arose Scimitars waved, turbans shook, horses plunged, the deep order was broken, and at length a horse man, magnificently apparelled and mounted, burst mto the ring, and rushed fiercely round " What, you miscreants," he shouted, " what m the name of Beelzebub ıs aH this for ? who dares to take the command out of my hands ? down with your bows —-Commit murder , and I not present < Ί he first man that pulls a string bhall leave an empty saddle Draw off, cut throats, or, if you want to do the world a service, shoot one another ' I gazed in vain on this figure of cloth of gold and purple The turban that blazing with gems hung down on his forehead, and the beard that black as the raven's wing curled full round his lip, completely baffled me He looked at me in turn, thrust out a sinewy band, and, clasping mme, exclaimed with a loud laugh— " What, pnnce, does the plumage make you
forget the bird ' What can have brought you into the hands of my culprits ' I thought that jou were drowned, burned or a candidate for the imperial diadem, by this time The voice and manner recurred to me " My friend of the free trade ' said 1 " By no means But a loyal plunderer—in tho service of Vespasian, and in command of a thousand Arab cavalry, that will ride, run¬ away, and rob, with any corps in the servioe, and the word is а bold one * Our b ier conference was broken up by the return of Cestius, who, outrageous at the delay, and coming to inquire the cause, found fresh fuel for his wrath in the sight of the Arab cap tain turned into my protector With an exe¬ cration he demanded why his ordeis had been disobeyed The captain answered with the most provoking coolness, that "no Roman oflicer, let his rank be what it might was eutitled to degrade the allies into executioners ' The Roman grew furious with the slight in the face of the troops, who highly enjoyed it The
Arab grew moro stircastic, till Cestius was rash enough to lift his hand, and the Arab antici¬ pated the blow by dashing his charger ut htm, aud le iving the haughty general and his horse struggling togUher on the ground Au insult of this kind to the second in com¬ mand was, of course, not to be forgiven The Arabs bent their bows to make battle for their captain, but hc forbade resistance, and when the legionary tribune demanded his sword, he surrendered it with a smile, saying, that "he had done service enough for one day, in saving an honest man, and punishing a ruffian, and that he should justify himself to Titus alone. My fate was still undetermined But the legionaries soon had more pressing matters to think of The clangour of horns and loud shouts came in the direction of the city The plain still lay m shade, but I could see through the dusk immense crowds moving forward like an inundation The legions were instantly under arms, and I stood a chance of being walked over by two armies
But I was not to encounter so distinguished a catastrophe Some symptoms of my inelim tion to оьеаре attracted the eye of the guard md I was marched to the common repository of malef \ctors m the reír of the Unes
CHAPTER XV My new quarters were within the walls of one of those huge country mansions, which the pride of our ancestors had built to be the plague of their posterity , for those the enemy chiefly employed for our prisons Their pro¬ digious strength defied desultory attack, time made little other impression on them than to picture their walls with innumerable stams, and the man must be α practised prison breaker who could force his way out of their depths of marble. But ď my eyes were useless, my ears had their full indulgence Every sound of the con¬ flict was heard The attack was frequently
furious, and must have been close to the walls of my dungeon The various rallying cries oi the tribes rang through its cells, then a Romun shout and the heavy charge of the cavalry would roll along, till, after an encountering roar and a long clashing of weapons, the tumult passed wild away, to be rapidly renewed by the obstinate bravery of my unfortunate country men I felt as a m in and а leader must feel during scenes in which he ought to take а part yet to which he was vntuully as much dead as the sleeper in the tomb My life had been activity, mv heart w ıs in the cause, I had knowledge, zeal, and strength, that might in the chances of battle turn defeat into triumph My name was known, I heard it often among the t barging cries of the day But Ьте I lay withm im passible barriers A thousand times during those miser ible hours I measured their height with my eye, and longed for the hopeless vigour that could scale them, then threw myself on the ground, and, closing my ears with my hande, laboured to exclude thought from my soul
But mv fellow prisoners were practicii philo sophers to a man untaught in the schools tıs trut vet fully trained in that great acudeme worth all that Plato ever dreamed in—expe In my wanderings through mankind I never before had such an opportunity ot studying varittv of character Wi r ıs the bot bed that urge all our qualities goo I md evil into their broadest luxuriance The generous becomt munificent the mean turn mto the villanous nnd the rude harden mto brutality The camp is the great mn at which all the dubious quali ties set up their rest and a single camp ugn perfects the culprit to the height of his piofes ston There were round mc in these immense halls about five hundre 1 profligates any one of whose histories would have been invaluable to a seorn r of human nature Among the loose urmies of the East those fellows exercised their vocntton as regular ар pendages often lived in luxury and sometimes shot up into leiders themselves But the ap proach to the Roman armies required a master
hand The temptation was strong for the le gionary was the grand ravager war was always busy where he trod and like the lion he leit the larger share oí the prey to the jackall But justice inexorable and rapid was his rule in all cases but his own and the jackall suspected of trespassing beyond the legitimate distance from the superior savage run the most mi minent hazard of being disqualified ior all encroachments to come Three fourths ot my issocuttcs had played this perilous game md its penalties were now awaiting only the first leisure oí the troops Peace at all times vexa ttous to their trade had thus a double disgust ior them and the most patriotic sou of Israel could not have taken a more zealous interest in the defeat of the legions But philosophy still predominated and when the retiring soun Is showed the repulse of the tribes not а counte nance was the darker if hope w is at an end hi lanty took its place and the prison rung with the most reckless exhibitions of practical glee not ous songs and fierce mockeries at the power oí ι ods and axes The professional talents oi those
sons of chance were remorselessly displayed The mimic collected his audience, burlesqued the pompous tribunes and officials of the army, ind gathered his pence and plaudits as it he was under the open sky, and could call his head his own The nostrum vender had his secrets for the cure of every ill, and harangued on the im¬ potence of brand, scourge, and blade, where the patient had but the wisdom to employ his irre¬ sistible unguent The soothsayer sold fate at the lowest price, and fixed the casualties of the next four and twenty hours, an easy task with the principal part of his audience The minstrel chanted the honour and glory of a life unen cumbered bv care or conscience And the pit ferer, with but an hour to live, exercised his trade with an industry proportioned to the shortness of his time In the whole gang I met with but one man thoroughly out of spirits He had obviously been no favourite of fortune, for the human form could scarcely be less indebted to clothing His swarthy visage was doubly blackened by hunger and exhaustion, and even his voice had
a prison sound D iven away from the joyous groups by the naturi 1 repulsion which the care less feel for visages that remind them of the world's troubles he ook refuge in the torner where I Ivy, torment d by every echo of the battle His groans attracted my notice, and, not un willing to forget the melancholy and agitating scenes, in which every mement was draining the last hope of my country, I turned to the wretch beside me, and asked the cause of his " Ingratitude," was the reply " This is a villanous world, a man may spend his life m serving others, and what will he gain in the end ? Nothing There is, for instance, the pnnce of Damascus, wallowing in wealth, yet the greatest rogue under this roof has not a more pitiful stock of honour , witness his сон duct to me He was out of favour with his uncle, the late prince, was net worth more than the raiment ou his limbs, and as likely to finish his days on the gibbet as any of the knot of robbers that helped him to scour the roads
about Sidon. In his distress he applied to me I had driven a handsome smuggling trade be¬ tween Egypt and the north, and now and then gave him a handsome price for his booty The idea of bringing his uncle to a compromise was out of the question The attempt would have probably first brought ourselves to f he axe. I gave in my proposal, and named my price, it w as allowed to be fair I made my way into the palace, became a favourite, by giving up some of my old friends of the troop , was exalted to the honours of cup bearer, and on my first night of office, gave the old man ι cup which cured bim of drunkenness for ever And what, do you think, was my re¬ ward ' ' " I think I could name what it ought to have been ' " You conclude, half his heir's jewels and treasure, at the least —No, not a stone, not a shekel I was thrown into chains, and finally kicked out of the city, with a promise, the only one that he will ever keep, that if I venture into his sacred presence again, I shall leave it with
out my head There s a villam for you' There» gratitude ' He will never do good as long as he lives '" " That may still depend upon your assist¬ ance Return to him, aud give him the oppor tnmty ' " My next example was among the Romans It must be owned that they pay well for secret services But then, ingratitude infects them from top to toe I had been three years ш their employment, and, if I made free with a few of their secrets in favour of others, it was only on the commercial principle oi having as many customers as one can supply, still I helped them to the knowledge of all that was going on " At last a showy adventurer changed the scene of my labours Some insult from the prefeet stirred up his blood, and in revenge he sailed away with lus galley, und set up on his own account. The prefect had reason to regret the quarrel , for not a sail, from a shallop to a trireme, could touch the water from the Cyclades to Cyprus, without being
overhauled by the captain I was set upon his track, and got into his good graces by lending him a little of my information, of which he made such desperate use, that the prefect swore my destruction as a traitor To make up the quarrel, I tried а wider game, and was bring ing the Roman fleet upon the pirates in their \ery nest, when a whole course of ill luck came across me A pair whom, to the last hour of my life, nothing will persuade me to think any thing but demons sent expressly to do me mischief, broke up one of the finest inventions that ever came into the head of man " The consequence was, that the pirates, in steads .of being attacked, burned the prefects bed under him, and would have burned himself, if he had not thought a watery end better than a fiery one, leaped overboard, and gone straight to the bottom The whole blame fell upon me, and my only payment from the Romans was the cropping of my ears, and a declaration, sworn to in the names of Romulus and Remus, that if I ever ventured again within a Roman camp or city, I should not get off so well
There s ingratitude for you, never was man so unfortunate " if Quite the contrary , it appears to me, thai seldom was man so lucky If not one m a hun¬ dred would have your tale to tell, not one in а thousand would have lived to tell it " I had aheady recognised the Egyptian of the cavern. But gratituue, humanity, justice " Say no more about them Or, if any libel 1er of your masters start up, tell your story and confute him Whatever the Romans may be in the matter of justice, your case is an answer to all charges on their mercy He looked at m° with а ghastly grimace, and, as he threw back the long and squalid locks that covered his countenance, showed what beggary had done to the sleek features of the once su perbly clothed and jewelled sea-rover " But what ' said I, " threw a man of your virtue among such a gang of caitiffs as are here ? " Another instance of ingratitude I had been for twenty years connected with one of the leading men of Jerusalem, and I will say, that in my experience of mankind, I пате known no
individual less perplexed with any weakness of conscience He had a difficult game to play, between the Romans, whom he served privately, the Jews, whom he served publicly, and him¬ self, whom he served with at least as much zeal as either of bis employers The times were made for the success of a man who has bis eyes open, and suffers neither the fear of any thing on earth, nor the hope of any thing after it, to shut them He succeeded accord¬ ingly got nd of some rivals by the dagger, sent some to harangue m the dungeon, bribed, where money would answer his purpose, me naced, where thr ats would be current coin, and by tbe practice of those natural means of nsing in public affairs, became the hope of a faction But on his glory there was one cloud ---the prince of Naphtah ' ' I listened, all ear I had deeply known the early hostility of Omas but his devices were too tortuous for me to trace, and, till the past night, I had lost sight of him for years I asked what cause of bitterness existed between those personages
" A multitude, as generally happens, where the imagination becomes a parry, and the ac cuser is allowed to be tbe judge The pnnce, in youth, and before he attained his rank, bad the insolence to fall in love with the woman marked by Onias for his own He had the ad¬ ditional insolence to attract her, aud the com pletton of bis crimes was marriage Onias »wore his rum thenceforth Public convulsions put off the promise, and while he was driven to his last struggle to keep himself among the liv mg, he had the indulgence of seeing the young husband shoot up without any trouble into rank, wealth, and renown " " But has uot time blunted his hostility ' ' " Time, as the proverb goes, blunts nothing but a man's wit, his teetb, and bis good inten tions, said the knave, with a sneer on his grim visage " The next half is, that it sharpens wine, women, nnd wickedness. What Ошав may have been doing of late, I can only guess, but, unless be is changed by miracle, he has been dealing m every villanous contrivance
from subornation to sorcery I had mv own affairs to mind But, unless Satan owes hun и grudge, he Is now not tar from his revenge " I thought ot our meeting at tho city gates, and, alarmed at the thance of his discovering my family, asked, whether Omas had obtained any late knowledge of his rival " Ofthat I know but little," said he, " vet, quick as his revenge may be, unless my honest employer manages with more temper than usual, he will rue the hour when he set foot on tht track of the prince ofNaphtah If ever man possessed the mastery of the spirits that our wizards pretend to raise, the pnnce is that man I myself have hunted him for years, yet he always baffled me I have laid traps tor him that nothing m human cunning could have escaped, yet he broke through them, as ιί they were spiders' webs. I lured htm by his domestics into the hands of the Romans, und saw him sent to the thustiest lover of blood that ever sat on a throne Yet he came back, aye, came from the very cinteli oí Nero I mad
deued his friends against him, and he con¬ ti ived to escape evt n from the malice and mad¬ ness of his friends α matter which, you will own, is among the most memorable I hid hun plunged iato а dungeon, where I kept him alive, for certam reasons, while Onias was to be kept to his bargain by the prisone ! rf appearance Yet he escaped, and my last in telhgenoe of him ts, that this master of fate and fortune is at this moment Iwing in pomp m Jei iisalem, tbe spot where I have been for the last month m close pursuit of him Time, or some marvellous power, must have disguised him And yet, if I were to meet the man this night— " Look on me, slave'" I rose, and, grasping him by the throat, unsheathed my dagger. " You have found him, and to your cost Atiocious villain, it is to you, then, that I owe so much misery Make your peace with Heaven, if you can, for it would be a crime to sufier you to leave this spot alive." He was dumb with terror I held him with an iron grasp. The thought that if he escaped me, it must be only to let loose a murderer
against my house, made me feel his death au act of justice. " IJet me go," he at List muttered, " let me hve, I am not fit to die. In the name oi that Lord whom you worship, spate me" He fell nt my feet, in desperate and howling suppli¬ cation —" You have not heard all, I liave ab¬ jured your enemy Spare me, and I will swear to pass my days in the desert, a wanderer, never to come agam before the face ol man , to lie upon the rook—to live upon the weed—to dnnk of the pool—to macerate this miserable body, until I sink into the grave 1 " I paused, struck by the abject eagerness foi life ш a wretch selt- condemned, and whose life was ready to be thus vowed to misery. While I held the dagger glittering before him, his senses continued bound up by iear. He gazed on it with an eye that quivered with every quivering of the steel. With one hand he grasped my uplifted arm as he knelt, and with the other gathered his rags round his throat to cover it from the blow. His voice was lost m horrid gaspmgs, bis mouth was wide
open antl hvid , tlie h ur of his head started up, and wnthud with the de idly writhing of his features I shoathed the weapon, and his connu minee instantly returned into its old hollow gnmaco A ghastly smile grew npon it, us he drew from his bosom a small paJtet " If you hud put mc to death ' said the wretch, *' you would have lost your best fnend This packot contains a correspondence for which Onias would give all that he is worth in the world, and well he might, for the man who bas it in his hands, has his life The world is made up of ingr itittide After all my servioes slander ing here plundering there, hunting down his op ponents in every direction till they either put themselves out of the world, or he saved them tho trouble he had tho baseness to throw me off At the head of his troops, when he felt himself secure, he flung me mto scorn, he kicked me from his horses side, nay, ordered me to be turned loose, as he said, " to carry my treachery to the Romaus, if they should be fools enough to think me worth the hire ' I was watching my opportunity to enter Jeram-
lem, and stab hım to the heart, when I was taken by some of the plunderers that hover round the camp, was recognised as having done some things in my time too ingenious ior vulgar conceptions, and am piobahly to suffer, for the benefit of Rom in morality, as a robber and assassin, as soon as the legions shall have mur dered every шап, and robbed every house in Jerusalem The packet contained a close correspondence ot Onias with tho Roman authorities A sen¬ sation of triumph glowed thiough me,—I held the fate of my implacable enemy in my hand I could now with л word stnke to the eaith tht being whose artifices dnd cruelties had way laid me through hfe, the traitor to my country would perish by the same blow that avenged my own wrongs " The last hours of his culprit existence should be hours of that solemn and sel f acknowledged retribution, which seals the triumph of justice ' My nature was made for violent passions In lpve and hatred, ш ambition, in sewn, in revenge, my original spirit knew no bounds.
Time, sorrow, and the conviction of my own outcast state, softened those powerful and ha zardous impulses, and I found the value öf adversity Misfortune comes with healing on its wings to the burning temper of the heart, as the tempest comes to the and soil —It tears up the surface, but softens it for the seeds of the no¬ bler virtues, in even its feeblest work, it coole the withering and devouring heat for a time I had yet to find with what fatal rapidity the heart resumes its old, overwhelming passions. " I spare your life," said 1, " but on one condition —That you henceforth make Onias tbe perpetual object of your vigilance, that you keep him from injury to me and mine, and that, when I shall seize him at last, you shall be forthcoming to give pubho proof of his treachery " " This sounds well," said the Egyptian a* be cast his eyes round the lofty hall. " But it would sound better, if we were not on this side ot the gate. All the talking ш the World will· not lower those walls an inch, nor make that gate turn on its hinges, though for that, and
for every other too, there is one master key Happy was the time," and the fellow's sullen eye lighted up with the joy of knavery, ' when I could walk through every cabinet, closet, and cell, from the emperor s palace in Rome down to the emperor's dungeon in Cesarea " I produced a few coins, which I had contrived to conceal, and flung them mto bis clutch The sum rekindled life m hım , avarice has its enthu¬ siasts as well as superstition He forgot dan ger, pnson, antl ey η my d ıgger, m iht sight of his idol He turned the coins to the light in all possible wnys, he tried them with his teeth, he tasted he kissed, he pressed them to bis bosom Ncv er was lover at the feet of his mistress more rapturous, than this last of hu¬ man beings, at the touch of money in the midst of wretchedness md ruin, with the chance of immediate death, and the certainty of desperate and solitary hazard, even if he should escape. His transports taught me a lesson, and in that prison and from that slave of vice, I learned long to tremble at the power of gold over the human nund.
It was past midiught, and the noise of the cnmuials iound me had already sunk away. The floor was strewed with sleepers, and the only waking figuro was the sentinel as be trod wearily along the passages, when the Egypti in, desiring me to feign sleep, that bis fuither operations might not be embarrassed, drew himself along the ground towards him The soldier, a huge German covered with heard and iron, and going Ыь rounds with the insen¬ sibility of .1 machine, alt but trod upon the Egyptian, who lay crouching and writhing be¬ fore him I saw the spear lifted up, and beard a growl that made me think my envoy's cureer completely at an cud in this world He still lay on the ground, writhing under the German's foot, as a serpent might uuder the paw of а lion. I was about to spring up, and interpose, but bis tune was not yet come The spear hung in air, gradually turned its point upwards, and finally resumed its seat of peace on the Ger¬ man's shoulder. That ait of persuasion which speaks to the palm, aud whose language ig of
all nations, had touched tlie son of Woden I heard the sound of the coin on the mirhle a few words airanged tht details the sentmel dis¬ covered tliat bis vigilance was required in an other direction broke ofi his customary iound, ami walked away The Egyptian turned to me with a tnumphant smile on his villanous visage, tbe gate rolled on its hinge and he slipped through like a shadow On the instant, my mind misgave me I had put the fate of my family into the hinds of n sla\e destitute of even the pretence of principle In my eagerness to save, might I not have been delivering thorn up to their enemy 7 He had sold Onias to me, might he not make his peace by selling me to Onias The gate was still open fhe sentinel was gone to α distant part of the building A few steps would put me beyond bondage Yet I had come to recover Esther Ifl left the camp what hope was there of my ever seeing this child of my heart agam ? How could I enjoy liberty while I thought that she was in Roman hands ? would not every hour of my life
be embittered by the chance that she might be suffering the miseries of a dungeon, or he borne away irom every being that she loved into ι strange land ' or dying, and tailing on me for help in vain ' Those contending impulses passed through my mind with the speed, and almost with the agony, of an anow But the more I thought of tht Egypti m, the more I took his treachery for ceitam The present ruin of all predo minuted over the possible sufferings of one, and with a heart throbbing almost to suffocation, and a step scarcely able to move, I dragged myself towards the portal.
CHAPTER XVI. Вит I was not to escape, and anticipate the traitor. As I touched the threshold, a loud sound of trampling feet and many voices drove me back. By that curious texture of the feel¬ ings which prefers suffering to suspense, I was almost glad to have the question decided for me by fortune, and flung myself on the giound among a heap of the undone, who lay enjoying а elumber that might be envied by princes. Tbe gate was thrown open, and in burst α living mass of horror,—a multitude of beings ω whom the human face and form were almost obbterated, shapes gaunt with famine, black with dust, withered with deadly fatigue, and covered with gashes and gore.
The war had gone on fiom cruelty to cruelty To the Boman the Jew was а rebel, and he received α rt bel s treatment to the Jew the Homan was a tyi ant an 1 dearly was the price of his tyranny exacted Qu irter was seldom given on either side che natui il genero ity of the son of Vespasian ittcinpted for α while to soften the rigours of this furious sVsteni But the slaughter of the mission exasperated him, he declared the Jews α people incapable of faith and proclaimed a w ir of extermination The battle of the d iy had furnished the first opportunity of formal vengeance The people, stunulated by the arrival and ambition of Onias, hud made a desperate effort to force the Ro man lines The attat ks were reiterated with more than /alour, with rage and maduess, the Jews fought with a disregard of life that ap palled and had nearly overwhelmed even tbe Roman steadiness The loss of the legions was formidable, all their chief oihcers were wounded, many were killed Titus himself, leading a column from tho Decuman gate, was wounded by a blow from a sling, aud the state of tbe
ramparts as I saw them at day break torn down in immense breaches and filling \\ t\ e ditch with their rums showed the immi nent hazaid of the whole army Another hour of light would probably have been its ruin But Judea would not have been the more seoure for the factions relieved from the ] resence of an enemy would have torn each other to piece The loss of the Jews was so prodigious as to be accounted for ouly by their eagerness to throw away life Not less than a hundred thousand corpses lay between the camp and Jerusalem No prisoners were taken and the crowd that now approached were the wounded gathered oif the field to be crucified in atone ment to the memory of the mission The coming of those victims put an end to the possil lhty or the desire of sleep The im mense and gloomy ball one of those in use for the stately banquets customary among the leaders of Jerusalem was suddenly a blaze ot torches The malefactore and eaptives were thrown together in heaps guarded by a strong
detachment of spenrmen, that lined the sides, like ranges of iron statues overlooking the mixed md moving confusion of wretched life between Guilt, sorrow, and shame were there in their dreadful undisguise The roof i ang to oaths and screams of pain, as the wounded tossed and rolled upon each other, to bitter la¬ mentation, and more bitter still, to those self- accusing outcries that the near approach of violent death sometimes furiously awakens in the most daring criminals For, stern as the justice was, it still was justice, the Jewish character had fearfully changed Rapine and bloodshed had become the habits of the popu lace And among the panting and quivering wretches before me, begging a moment of life, I recognised many a face, that seen in Jerusa lern was the sign of plunder and massacre Repulsive as my recollections weie, I spent the greater part of the night in bandaging their wounds, and relieving the thirst, which scarcely less than their wounds, wrung them. There were women too among those wrecks of the sword, and now that the frenzy of the day
was passed, they exhibited a picture of tbe most heart-breaking dejection Lying on the ground, with muti! ited limbs and every lineament of their former selves dis¬ figured, they cried from that living grave alter¬ nately fjr vengeance and for mercy Then, tearing their hair, and flinging it as their last mark of atred and scorn at the legionaries, thcy devoted them to rum in the name of the God of Israel Then passion would give way to pain or а sense of ruin, and in floods of tears they called on the names of parent, husband, and child, whom they were to see no more It was known that, at day break the prisoners were to die, and the dm of hammers, and the creaking of waggons bearing the crosses, broke the nigit with horrid intimation At length, the stillness terribly told that all τ as prepared The night, measured by moments, seemed endless, and many a longing was uttered for the dawn that was to put them out of their misery. Yet when the first gray light fell through the casements, and the trumpet sounded for the escort to get under arms, nothing could
exceed the fury and despair of the crowd Some rushed upon the spears of the reluctant soldiery, some bounded in inad antics through the hall, others fell on their knees, and offered up horrid and shuddering prayers, manv flung themselves upon the floor, and m the paroxysm of writh and fear perished. Shocked and sickened by this misery, I with¬ drew from the gate, where the tumult was thickest, as the soldieiy were aheady driving them out, and returned to my old lair to await the stroke that was to fall upon myself But I found it occupttd A circle were standing round a speaker, to whom they listened with singular attention. The voice caught my ear, from the crowd round him I was unable to observe his features, but, once drawn within the sound of his words, I sh ired the general interest m thin extiaordtnary power He was a preacher of the new religion In my wanderings through Judea, it must be supposed that, I had often met with those Nazarenes Iheir doctrines had a vivid sun pUcity that might have attracted my attention
as a philosopher but the delight of philosophy was cold to their power The spk ndour and strength of their preaching realised the boldest traditions of oratory Yet their tnumph was not th it of or itory They disclaimed all pre tension to eloquence or literature, dt cluing that tven if they possessed them thev dared not sully by humm instruments of succ ss the glory due to Heaven They cirned this self dennl to the'angular extent of divulging every eitcumst ince calculated to deprive themselves and tlu ir doctrines of human distinction I hoy openly acknowledged that they were of humble birth and occupation, unie mied suméis like the iest of mankind, nnd m some instinces, guilty of former excesses of blind 7tal bigots and peisecutois of the new reh D ion even to blood Of their Master they spoke with the same openness They told of bis humble origin, his eareer of unf opularity and rejection and his death hy the punishment of а slave I о the scoífer at their hopes of a kingdom to be gi\en by the sufferer of that ignominious death,
they unhesitatingly answered, that their hope was founded expressly upon his cross, and that they lived and rejoiced in the expec tation that they were to seal their faith with their blood I had often seen enthusiasm among my countrymen but this was a spirit of a tl ıs t met and loftier birth It had the vigour of enthu siasm without its rashness, the innocence of ml incy with the wisdom of years , the solemn reverence of tbe Jew for the divino will, free from Ins j ilous and exclusive claim to the possession of the truth The law and the pro phets were perpetually in their hands, and they perpetually embarrassed our indolent doctors und acrid phansees with questions and inter pretntions, to which no reply eould be returned but a snter or an anathema But, in the power of conviction, in the master art of striking through heart and undtrslmd mg with sudden light, like the bolt fiom Heu ven I never heard, I never shall hear, their equals Го call it eloquence, was to humiliate this stupendous gift, the most practised skill ol
the rhetorician gave way before it like gossamer, like chaff before the whirlwind It broke its way through sophistry by the mere weight oi thought It had α rapid abundance and reality that swept thr hearer along In its disdain of the mere decorations of speech, in the bold and naked nerve of its language, whuh the sickly sophist called uncouthness there was an irresis tibie energy—the energy of the tempest, giving proof in its untameable and irregular rushinga of its descent from a region beyond the reach of man I never listened to one of these preacheis, hut with the consciousness that lie was the depo sitory of mighty knowledge He had the whole mystery of the human affections bare to his eye Among а thousand hearts one word sent con viction at the same instant All their diversi ties of feeling sorrow, and error, were shaken at once by that universal language —It talked to the soul 1 Of those overwhelming appeals, which often lasted for hours togetner, and to which I listened overwhelmed, nothing is left to posterity, but a few fragments, and those letter* which the Christians still preserve among their
sacred writings,—great productions, and giving alt the impression that it is possible to trans¬ mit to the future But, tbe living voice, the illumined countenance, the frame glowing and instinct with inspiration <—what can transmit them ? " Here, said I, as I often stood and heard their voices thundering over the multitude, here is the tiue power that is to shake the temples of heathenism Here is α new element, come to overthrow, or renovate the world I saw our holy law struggling to keep itself in existence, compressed on e\ ery side by idolatry, a little fountain feebly urging its way through its native rocks, but exhausted and dried up tlie moment it reached the plum But here was an ocean an ine\haustiblo depth and breadth of power, made to roll round the world, and he at the will ot Providence, the illimitable instru¬ ment of its bounty I saw our holy law feebly sheltering undents despoiled and insulted ordi nances the truth ol Heaven But here was a religion scorning α narrower temple than th* earth und the heaven '
Yet I turned away from those convictions A thousand times, I was on the point of throw¬ ing myself at the feet of tbe men who bore this transcendent gift, and asking, " What shall I do to be saved Ί ' A thousand times I could have cried out, " Almost thou persuadest me to be a Chiistian " But my doubting heart ' I make no attempt to account for myself, or mv career,—I have feltas strongly drawn back, as tt there was an actual hand forcing mc away—The illusion was a willing one, and it was suffered, like all such, to hold me in its captivity —But, even when I walked away, 1 have said, " Whence had those men this know ledge ' If angels from God were to come down to reclaim the world, could they tell us tilings different, or tell us more 7 ' I looked round upon the labours of ancient w isdom, and I saw how trivial a space its utmost vigour cleared, and how soon even that space was overrun by the ruukness of the world , and I said J -e is the central fire, the mighty re¬ servou oı ught, awaiting but the divine command to burst up m splendour, consume the impunties
of the world at once, and regenerate man kind But the veil was upon my face I laboured against conviftion, and, shutting out the sub ject from my thoughts, sternly determined to live and die in the fm t h of my fitheis I heard but the few and simple closing words of the speaker m this group of tht de vototi He was sorrowful th it the gospel had been so long committed to his h mds in vum He had through fear of his own inadequacy to the task of conveiting his brethren, and in re maining deference to their prepiditts, suffered the truth to decay, and seen the illustrious labours of the apostles without following their example " But' said he "I wis rebuked tho opportunity once neglecttd, was refused even to my prajers I was thenceforth in perils, in civil war, m domestic sedition I am but now come from a dungeon But, in my bonds it pleased hıra m whose hrnd aie the corners of the heavens to visit mc I knelt ana prajtd, acknowledging my sin, and beseeching him by the mercies of the Lord, that before I vol in ι
I died, might proclaim his holy truth beton 1 Israel In that hour, came u voice bidding me go forth, and, lo ' my ι hams fell from my hands, and I went forth And when I tamo to the gates of the dungeon, I willed to go foi wird to the city of Daud But I was forbid den and my steps itere turned here to awaki my brethren to knowledge btfore th»y perish The trumpets rang igam, «s a new crowd were drained off to execution My heart sank at the melancholy sound But among the eon vevts there was nota murmur " Kneet * said the preacher, "the hour is tom^ Let пч giv° thanks uuto the Lord They knelt and he poured out his spirit aloud in prayer " Now go forth,' he «aid rising alone, " go forth, redeemed of the Lord This night have ye к ночи that he is grucions Those things that God before hath showed by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer, he hath fulfilled But ye have heard, hut ye have been converted, that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, But ye
liave been called—but ye have been justified— but ye shall be glorified Our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as you have been par takers of his cross, so shall ye be of his kingdom Now be grace unto you, and peace from the Lord He hid his hands upon the kneeling martyrs and went slowly round, blessing them His face hud been hitherto turned from me, and I was too much impressed by his words, and the awful circumstances in which he stood, to even conjecture who he was But in moving round, he came before ше To my inexpressible sur prise and alarm, the teacher was Eleazar I had lost every trace of him since we parted in the fortress, and with sorrow of heart, had concluded him α sacrifice to the common atrocities prac tısed in our ierocious war His long absence was now explained But uo explanation could account for the extraordi nary change that had been wrought upon his countenance and mmd Always generous and manly, the softness of a nature made for do mestte life had concealed tbe vigour of bis an-
derstanding. Ho was the general reconciler in the disputes of the neigiibouring districts—the impartial judge—the unwearied friend; and his features wore the stamp of this quiet career. But the man before me bore uncontrollable energy in every tone and feature. The fail¬ ing flame of the torch that burned over his head, was enough to show the transformation of his countenance into force and grandeur; his glance was a living fire : the hair that floated 01 er it, changed by captivity to the whiteness of snow, shaded a forehead that seemed to have suddenly expanded into majesty. If I had met with such a man in a desert, I should have augured in him the founder, or the subverter of a throne. While I stood absolutely awed by his pre¬ sence, the gates were thrown open, and a strong detachment of spearmen poured in to gather up the gleanings of the hall. Then was renewed the scene of misery. The prisoneis struggled furiously against the honid death that was now certain. Their rage and imprecations were answered by the blows and curses of the sol-
diery Wretches that I had thought dea« started from the ground, and flung themselves at their feet, or rushed against the armed ranks tore the weapons out of their hands, and broke them in mad triumph through the hall or turned them against the shields and cuirasses with the force of frenzy Others dashed their foreheads agamst the walls and floor and died upon the spot Others sprang up the pro jections of the sculpture, and climbed with the agility of leopards to fhe roof to force the case ments But additional troops poured in, and the crowd were overwhelmed, and driven out to undergo their destiny During this long tumult the Christian con verts continued kneeling, and evidently ab sorbed by thoughts that extinguished fear Even the sounds from without, that terribly told what was going on, and every tone of which pierced me to the marrow, produced only a deeper supplication that light would be given to the souls rf the sufferers This patience probably mdu&ed the soldiery to leave them to the last, while they drove out tbe more un
tractable at the point of the spear like cattle to the slaughter I still stood aloof The sacredness of the moments that came before death were not to be interrupted The trans formed Eleazai had already passed away írom the things of this world I would not force them on him again, nor vainly and cruelly disturb the holy serenity of one at peace alike with man and Heaven At length the order came Now, my beloved brothers, beloved in the Lord, go forth, said Eleazar, with a noble exultation glowing in his countenance ' Quit ye like men, be strong fear not them who can kill only the body Even this mght saw you still in your sins—the wisdom that was before all worlds, hidden from you—without a Saviour But he that calleth light out of darkness, hath wrought in you The ear of the Lord has not been heavy, that he should not hear, his hand has not been straitened He has poured upon you that Spirit which is an earnest of your inherit ance, holy, incorruptible, eternal in the heavens Now, sons of Abraham, redeemed of Christ, kings and priests of God for ever, go, where
he is gone to prepare a place for you Go, to the house of many mansions ■* Go, to the king¬ dom of glory With tears and blessings, Eleazar took water and baptized the converts They sang a hvmn, and then rising moved towards the gate, the soldiers standing at a distance, and looking on it this moie than heroic resignation with eves of respect and wondei But I could restrain myself no longer I stopped Eleazar he in stantly recognised me, and the colour that shot through his cheek showed that with me came ι tide of memory I was speechless, I embraced him tears of old friendship dimmed ray eyes He was overpowered like myself, and could only exclaim— Salathiel, my brother —what misfortune bas brought you here'—But you are not to die '—Where is Miriam,—where are voui children 7 —You cannot be a prisoner'— Fiv from this dreadful place Never my brother, unless 1 can save vou —The tyrants shall have the blood of both upon then heads lhts ıs m ulness, Salathiel— impieta, eh
that you were this moment even as I am— m all bat death—It is your duty to live jou have many tiee to the world What have I ' or what service can I do *o the world equal to thai of showing in what peace α followei ol my Lord and Master can die' Agam, I say oh that you were at this moment awake to the truths, the holy and imperishable consolations that m d e the cross to mc more tnumphant than a thuwie ' The theme was η painful one He instantly saw my perturbation, and forbore to urge me But fixing his humid eyes on heaven, and with npbfted bands, be gave roe his parting bene diction " May the time come," said he, ' when the veil shall be taken away from the face of my unhappy kindred, and of my undone country ' When the days of the desolation of Isr iel come to be accomplished, let her kneel beiore the altar —let her weep m sackcloth, and repent of her iniquities so shall the sun of gloTy anse upon her once more ' Then, as if a flash of know ledge bad darted into his soul, he fixed his solemn gaze on me " Salathiel, you are not
fit to die, pray that you may not now sink into the grave you have fierce impulses, untamed passions, of whose power you have yet no con ception Supplicate for length of years rather endure all the miseries of exile, be alone upon the earth—weary, wild, and desolate but pray that you may not die, until you know the truths that Israel yet shall know Let it be for me to die, and seal my faith by my blood Let it be for you to live and seal it by your penitence But live in hope Even on earth, a day bright beyond earthly splendour, lovely beyond all tbe visions of beauty magnificent and powerful be yond thr loftiest thought of human nature, shall me, and we, even we my brother, shall on с irth meet a^aiii
CHAPTER XVII There was a thrilling influence in the words of Eleazar, that left me without reply, and for л while I stood absorbed When I raised my eyes again, I saw him following the melancholy tram down the valley of slaughter I rushed after him He would not listen to my en treaties, he would suffer no ransom to be offered for his life. I supplicated the tribune of the escort for a moment's delay, until I could so licit mercy from Titus The officer, himself deeply pained by the service on which he wai ordered, had uo authority, but sent a centurion with me to the general commanding 1 hurned my guide through the immense
force di awn out to \utness the offering to the shades of the Roman senators and soldiers The morning was stormy and driving clouds covering the ridges of the hills darkened tht feoble dawn so much, that torches were net es sary to direct the movement of the troops The wind саше howling through the spears .ind standards, but with it came the fiercer sounds of human agony As we reached the enti ance of the valley, the centurion pointed to the height where the general stood, ш the mitlit of а group of mounted officers wrapped in their t loaks, ugamst the sleet that came furiously whirling from the hills I darted up the steep with a rapidity that left my companion far below, and implored the Roman humanity for mv countrymen, and for my noble and innocent brother On my knee, on the knee that I had never before bowed to man, I besought the illustrious son of Vespa sian to spare men> " whose only crime was that of having defended their eountry I adjured the heir of tho empire " to rescue from an igno minious fate, subjects driven into revolt onlv bv
vioIűQces, which he would be the first to dis own. If, said I, "you demand money for the Uves of my countrymen, it shall be given even to our last ounce of silver if jc*. -s-cJi have territory, we will give up our lauds, und go forth exiles. If you must have life for life, take шше, and let my brother go free ' ' The genera' slowly removed the cloak which covered him to the eyes, and Cestius was before me. " So,' said he, with a malignant smile, "you can kneel, Jew, and play the rhetorician however, as you are here, your having escaped mc once, is no reason why you should laugh at justice а second time Here, Torquatus," he beckoned to an officer, " take this rebel to the crosses, and bring me an account of the way in which he behaves You see, Jew, that I have some care of your reputation A fellow, care¬ less as you are, would probably have died in some paltry skirmish, but you sball now figure before your countrymen, as а patriot should, and die with the honours of α native hero ' I disdained to answer The oflicer came up, attended by some spearmen, and I was led to
the valley A snow storm of extraordinary violence long gathering on the sky broke forth as I deseen led and it was only by grasping the rocks and shrubs on the side of the declivity thut we could avoid being blown away We staggered along blinded and half frozen The storm fell heavily upon the legions and the heights were quickly abandoned for the shelter of the valley The valley itself was a sheet of snow torn up by fierce blasts that dnfted it hazardously upon the troops ind threw every thing mto confusion But the sight that opened on me as I passed the first gorge efiaced storm aud soldiery antl might have effaced the world from my mind Thiough the whole extent of the huge naked md rocky hollow were plai ted crosses The i avine dark even in sun shine was now black is midnight and its only light was fiom the scattered torches and the fires into which the bodies of the victims were flung as they died to make room for others On those crosses hung hundreds writhing in miseries made only to show the hideous capability of suffering that
exists n our frame I was instantly recognised, and many a hand was stretched out to me, im plonng that I should mercifully hasten death I heard my name called on, as their pnnce, their leader, their countryman, to remember and re veng« Inceneed nnd horror struck, I raved at the legionenes and their tyrant master, until I sank upon the ground in exhaustion, covering my head with my mantle, that I might exclude alike sight and sound A voice at my side aroused me , α cross had jus* been fixed on the spot, and at its foot stood preparing for death, the man who had spoken I looked upon hie face, and gave an involuntarv cry For seven and thirty years I had not seen that face but I had seen it on а night never to be erased from my remembrance, or my soul I knew every feature of it through all the changes of years Manhood had passed into age, the bold and sanguine countenance was furrowed With cares and crimes But I knew at once the man who had on that night been foremost at my call, the daring rabble leader, who bad first shouted at
my fatal summons, and maddened the multitude, is I had maddened myself and him He turned his glance upon me At the cry His pnie visage grew black as death The past flashed upon his soul He shook from head to foot with keen con vulsion He gasped, and tried to speak, but no words came He beat his breast wildly, and pointed to the cross with dreadful meanmg The executioner, a brutal slave, scoffed at him as a dastird He heard nothing, but with his pallid eyes staring on me, and his hand pointed upwards, stood stiffening Life departed as he stood ' The executioner, impatient, laid his grasp upon htm, but he was beyoud the power of man. He fell backward like a pillar of itone I started from the corpse, and, utterly un¬ nerved, looked wildly round for some way of escape from this scene oi despair As I tned to penetrate the dusk towards the bottom of the valley, Eleazar was seen at the head of his little band, standing at tbe foot of a cross, sur¬ rounded by soldiers I thought no more of safety, and plunging into the valley, forced my

high life α prey to tailors, a figure for dctors to burlesque, and un inveterate weariness to the world But here is a despatch from the Emperor, md, unfortunately for human eyes written ш his own, most unreaduble, hand " The speaker stood up to the lamp, and gave me on oppor¬ tunitv of observing him. His countenance und figure struck mo, as what hp other word could express th in—princely. The features were handsome, and strongly marked Italian, and the form, though tendmg to breadth, and rather under the usual stature, was eminently dignified His ťoice too was remarkable. I never heard one that more completely united softness and m ijestv Here I could have but the shadow of a doubt that I had found Titus, yet I had that shadow Our meeting in the field, where we bad fought band to hand, gave me no recol lection of the man before me Titus might not even be among the three, and nothing but seizure and ruin could be the consequence of discovering myself to subordinates
" Good news, it ıs to be hoped," said both the listeners together, as they deferenti illy watched his perusal " None whatever, a mere private chiomcle, in the Emperor's usual style, all kinds of oddi ties together He laughs at me ior complain ing of want of intelligence from Rome, and nays that, unless we send him some, the poli tıcıans of the city will die of emptiness, or raise a rebellion j and that he is the most ill used per¬ sonage m the empire, in being obliged to sup¬ ply brains for so many blockheads, and keep up the reputation of an honest man, m the midst of so many knaves But he mentions, and for that I am deeply grateful, that he has just erected the golden statue, which I vowed so long ago to the memory of my unfortunate friend Britannicus, and is about to dedicate an ivory equestrian one to him, to be placed m the Circus He concludes the epistle with saying that, unless the British insurrection speedily blows over, he shall be a beggar, and must turn tribune for a livelihood, defends his impracticable manuscript» which, he says, I am
imitating .ıs fabt as I can, and repeats Ins old jest, that—J* I were not born to be a prince and an idler, I might have made my bread by mv talents for forgery " His bearers repaid the imperial merriment by its lull tributo of lojal laughter. Doubt v,as now at an end, and 1 advanced My step roused the party, and they started up, drawiug their swords Ľut the quick eye oi Titus recognised me, and satisfying his com¬ panions by a gesture, I heard him pronounce to them, " My antagonist, the pnnce ofNaph¬ tah." There was no time for ceremony, and I addressed him at on* e " Son of Vespasian, you are a soldier, and kuow what is dae to the braye, I come to solicit your men y , it ib the first time that I ever stooped to solicit man. My brother, a chieftain of Israel, is m your hands, condemned to the horrid death of the cross, he is virtuous, brave, and noble, save hmi, and jou will do an act of justice more honourable to your name than the bloodiest victory " Titus looked at me ш silence, and evidently
perplexed, then returned to his chair, and luu ing consultod with his companions, hesitatingly pronountcd ** Prince, you know not what you Jiave asked. I am bound, like others, by the Emperor's commands, and they strictly arc that none of your countrymen iiktn after the ofltr of peace, n ust live " Hear this, God of Israel, I crud " Киц of vengeance, hear and u member " ' \ ou are rash prmct, said Titus, gravely, " yet I can forgiv your national temper With others, eien youi venturing here, might bring you into hazard But, tbe perfidy of youi people make·* truce and treaty impossiblt They leave me no uUernative I lament the necessity It is tho desirt of the illustrious Vespasian to reign in peice But this is now at an end He paused and advancing towards nu offered his hand, with the words, " I know that there are brave and high minded men among your nation I have been astonished at the valour, nay, I will call it, the daring and heroic contempt of suflenng and death, that this siege

The picture of her ruin rose before ray eyes and tears forced their way, my strength was dissolved, my voice was choked The Romans fixed their looks on the ground, afiected by the sincerity of a soldier's sorrow I took the hand, that was again offered "Titus' in the name ofthat Being, to whom the wisdom of the earth is folly, I adjure vou to beware Jerusalem is sacred Her crimes have often wrought her misery—often has she been trampled by the armies of the stranger But she is still the City of the Omnipotent, and never was blow inflicted on her by man that was not terribly repaid " The Assyrian came, the mightiest power of the world, he plundered her temple, алД led her people mto captivity How long was it before his empire was a dream, his dynasty extinguished in blood, and an enemy on his throne'—The Persian came, from her protêt tor, he turned into her oppressor, and his empire
was swept away like the dust of tbe desert '— The Synan smote her the smiter died in agonies of remorse and where is his kingdom now ? —The Egyptian smote her, and who now sits on the throne of the Ptolemies '—Pompey came, the invincible, the conqueror of a thou sand cities the light of Rome, the lord of Asia riding on the very wings of victory But he profaned her Temple and from that hour he went down—down like а mill stone plunged into the ocean ' Blind counsel, rash ambition, womanish fears were upon the great statesman and warrior of Rome Where does he sleep 7 What sands were coloured with his blood ?

" You too, son of Vespasian, may be com VOL UI M
missioned for the punishment of α stiff necked and rebellious people You may scourge onr naked vice by the force of arms, and then you may return to your own land exulting in the oonquest of the fiercest enemy of Rome. But shall you escape the common fate of the instru ment of evtl ? —shall you see a peaceful old age'— sball a son of yours ever ait upon the throne'—shall not rather some monster of your blood eftace the memory of your virtues, and make Rome, in bitterness of soul, curse tht riavian name ? " Titus grew pale, and shuddering, covered his eyes with his mantle, as he sat His com panions stood gazing on me with the awed aspect of men gazing on the messenger of fate " Spare Eleazar," was aH that I could uttei Titus made a sign to the page, who fiew to bear, if not too late, the orders of mercy Whde we continued m a silence, that none of us felt inclined to break , a door opened behind me, and an oflicer entered It was SeptuniuB I seized him by the throat " Vil lain 1 give me back my child, base hypocrite '
give up my innocent daughter Where have you taken her ' lead me to her, or die " Titus rose in evident surprise and indigna tion " What do 1 hear, Septimius ? have you been guilty of this offence ' Prince, let lini loose, until Ins General shall hear what he luis to say for himself ' Septimius affected the most extreme and easy ignorance " Most noble Titus, ï have to thank you for having saved mj neck from the grasp of this hasty personage, but, beyond that, I have nothing to say for myself, or any one else —I never saw this man before —I know no moie of his daughter, than of the queen of Abyssinia, or the three formed Diana, and, by the goddess I swear, that I believe him to be perfectly under her influence t and either α lunatic, or a most excellent actor. Be honest, Jew, if you can, and acknowledge that you never saw me before m your life, ' I stood in astonishment., his effrontery struck me dumb* " You perceive, most noble Titus, ' he went on, " how a plain question puts an end to this public accuser's charges. But, m
his present state, whether affected or real, he should not be suffered to go at large suffer me to send him to my quarters, where he shall be taken sufficient care of, until we at least bud out what brought him here " "Ingrate," I exclaimed, " you make me hate human nature, is this my return ? better that I had left you to be trampled like the viper that you are ' The dark eye of the general fixed on Sep timius, seemed to require a graver explanation " Ingrate," retorted he " By Jupiter, the fellow's insolence is superb For what should I be grateful ? but for my escape from his detest able hands, or, perhaps, he means those of his countrymen Very probably he figured among the rabble that would have murdered me, as they did the rest of us —grateful, yes, I ought to be, for an exhibition of human villany, that I might search the world through without see ing again, or for the lesson, never to venture wiíhiD his walls on the faith of the traitors that hold them —But, let me be allowed to say, most noble Titus, that you condescend too much in
listening to any of this rabble, nay, that you hazard the safety of the state in hazarding your person within the reach of one of a race of assassins " Titus smiled, and waved back his com¬ panions, who, on the surmise, were approach- ing him ' Let me be honoured with your commands, urged Septimius, " to take this person in charge felon, or insane, I shall speedily put him in the way of cure " A tribune, breathless with haste, came ш at the moment with a letter which he gave to Titus, and retired to α distant pírt of the tent to aw ait the answer The colour rose into the Roman s cheek, as he looked over the paper, he showed it to his companions, and then pat it mto my hand I read the words— " An assassin, hired by the chiefs of Jerusa tern, yesterday passed the gates His object is the life of the Roman general He goes under pretence of recovering one of his family sup¬ posed to be carried off from the city, but who has never left his house He has communi-
cations with the camp, by which he can enter at pleasure, and the noble Titus cannot be too much on his guard ' The note was in an enclosure from Cestius, stating that it had been just transmitted to him from a high authority m Jerusalem I flung it on the ground with the scoin due to such an accusation, declaring, that it was unnecessary for " my enemy Cestius to have put his name to a document which so easily revealed its wnter." " You, of course, Septimius," said the general, settling his penetrating gaze on him, ' ( could know nothing of this lettéi ? " Septimius entered on his defence with se¬ riousness , and showed that, from the time and circumstances, no share in it could be attached to him Titus retired а few steps, and having consulted with the officers, who I perceived were unanimous for my being instantly put to death, addressed me in that grave and silver- toned voice, which characterized the singular composure of his nature " We have exchanged blows, and pledges of
honour, prince, and I will not suffer myself to belit ve that а man of your rar 't and soldiership tould stoop to the crime с rged here In truth, weie none but personal considerations to be in question, I should instantly set yon free But there are weighty interests connected with my life which make it seem fitting to my fnends and adviseis, that, in all cases, precautions should bo taken, which otherwise I should disdain To satisfy their minds, and the spirit of the Emperors orders, I must detain you for α few days Your treatment shall be lionour able ' Septimius advanced to again demand my custody But a look repelled the request, and I was directed to follow one of the secretaries •ofTitus
CHAPTER XVIII A troop of cavalry were at the tent door. "We set off through the storm, and, a few miles from the camp, reached a large building, peo pled with a host of high functionanes, attached to Titus, as governor of Judea. " You are a prodigious favourite with the general," said my companion, as we passed through a range of magnificent rooms furnished with Italian luxury, " orbe would never have sent you here He had these chambers fur¬ nished for his own residence, but your country men have kept him too busy, and for the last month he is indebted to you for sleeping under canvas "

the greatest interest in so meritorious α public servant, paid him а visit the next day as a physician, ordered him а variety of medicines, which the unfortunate governor was compelled to take, renewed his visit regularly every day, and every day charged him an enormous fee Beggary stared the governor in the face , ami never was a complication of disorders so rapidly cured —' I was riding out with him one d ty, a few miles from Rome, when we saw a fellow beating his mule cruelly j and, on being called to, insist ing on his right to ' do what he would with his own ' I was indignant, and would have fought the mule's quarrel But the Lmperor laughed at my zeal, and after some jestmg with the brutal owner, bought the mule, ouly annexing the condition, that the fellow should lead it to the stable —he actually sent him with the mule two hundred and fifty miles, on foot, to one of bis palaces in Gaul, with a hctor after him, to see that the contract was fair I v per formed —"One of his chamberlains had been soliciting

But tbe true sadness of the soul is not to be scattered by the life and loveliness of external things. I turned from the sun antl nature to fling myself on my conch, and feel that, where α man's treasure is, there his heart is also " What might not be doing in Jerusaltm * what fanatic violence, personal revenge, or pub¬ lic lítense might not be let loose, while I was lingering among the costly vanities of the Pa¬ gan ' My enemy, at least, was there, iu the possession of unbridled authority," and the thought was m itself ъ history of evil

CHAPTER XIX To me the prison and the palace were the same No believer m fate, and a strong be liever in the doctrine that, m the infinite majority of cases the unlucky have to thank only them¬ selves , feeling, too, that the manly and the wise disdain to act by borrowed will or wisdom I was yet irresistibly conscious ot my own stern exception That there was an influence hang ing over me, I deeply knew, that I might as well strive with the winds, was the fruit of my whole experience, and, with as much self re solve in me as I ever knew in man, and as lofty a calculation of the wonders that human energy may work, I abandoned myself on principle to
the chances of the hour —I was the weed upon the wave, and, whether above or below the surface, I kuew that the wave would roll on, and that I must roll on along with it —I was the atom m the air, and, whether I should float unseen for ever, or be brought into sight by the gilding ot some chance sun beam across me, my destiny was to float and quiver up and down —I was the vapour and whether, like the evening cloud, my after years were to evolve into glorious shapes and colours, or I should creep along the pools and vallejs of fortune till the end of une, —yet, there I was, still in existence, and that existence bound by liws incapable of the choices or caprices of I had yet to ietrn the hue burden of my great malediction for the circumstances of my hfe were yet adverse to its fated solitude of soul, i + s bitter conviction thit there was not a being under the canopy ot heaven whose heart was towards me, its dull and melancholy exile, m the midst of a world full of activity, hope, and passion I was still in the very eddy of VOL III N
life, and battling it with the boldest My family survived public cares, personal interests, glow¬ ing attachments, the whole vigorous activity of the citizen and the soldier, were mine I was still husband, father, friend, champion of а great people, my task was difficult and grave, bat it was ardent, proud, and animating I was made for this activity of the whole man, master of α powerful frame that defied fatigue, and was proof against the sharpest visitations of nature, and of an intellect, which, whatever might be its rank, rejoiced in tasking itself with labours that appalled and perplexed the multitude—in feeding and stimulating a per petual passion for the grand and the imagina tive — m giving itself up to an ambition, a de vounng and inappt ι scabie desire of doing some¬ thing, by which I should be rescued from the common obscurity, of planting in the waste the seed of a name which should spring up and flourish, and go on distending m vigour and majesty, when the more precocious fosterlings of the day were withered and dust. Idle as I knew tho praise of man, and sove-
reign as was my scorn for the meanness which stoops to the \ ulgar purchase of populai ity, I felt and honoured the true fame—that renown, whose statue is devoted, not by the suspicious and clamorous flattery of the time, but by the solemn and voluntary homage of the future whose splendour, like that of anew bom star, if it take ages to reach mankind, is sure to reach them at last, and shines for ages after its fount is extinguished whose essential power if it be coerced and obscured, like tint of man while his earthly tenement still shuts him in, is thenceforth to develop itself from strength to strength—the mortal putting on immor¬ tality In the whirl of such thoughts I was often car ned away, to the utter oblivion of my peculiar fate foi man and his associations weie strong within me, m defiance of the command The gloom often passed away from iny soul, as tho darkness does from the midnight ocean m the dash and foam of its own waters Niture is perpetual, and drives the affections, sleeping or waking, as it drives the blood through the
old channels It was only at periods, produced by strong circumstance, that I felt the fetter, but then, the iron entered into my soul ' To this partial pressure belongs the singular mation of such a fate as mine with an interest in the world, with my loves and hates, my thirst of human fame, my reluctance at the prospect of the common ills and injuiies of life I was a man, and this is the whole solution of the problem For ono remote evidence that I was distinct fiom mankind, I had ten thousand direct and constant, that I was the same But, for the partiality of the pressure, there was α lofty reason The man who feels himself above the common fate, is instantly placed above the con. mon defences of mankind He may calumniate am' ruin, he may burn and plunder, he may be the rebel and the murderer Fear is, after all, the great security But what earthly power could intimidate him ' What were chains, or the scaffold, to him, who felt instinctively that time was not made for his being, that the scaffold was impotent, that he should yet
trample on the grave of his judge, on the mouldered throne of his king, on the dead sovereignty of his nation ' With his mi pusstveness, his experience, his knowledge, and his passions, concocted aud blacken d by ages what breast could be safe against the dagger of this tremendous exile, w hat power be secure against the rebel machination, or the open hostility of a being invested with the strength of immortal evil ? What was to hinder a man made familiar with every mode of influencing human passions—the sage, the sor¬ cerer, the fount of tradition, the friend of their worshipped ancestors—from maddening the multitude at whose head he willed to march, clothed in the attributes of almost а divinity ' But I was precluded, or saved, from this fearful career, by tlie providential feeling of the common repugnances, hopes, and fears oi human nature Pain and disease were in¬ stinctively as much shunned by me, as if I held my hie on tbe frailest tenure, death was as formidable, as my natural soldiership would »uller it to be, and, even when the thought
oct urred that I might defy extinction it threw but a darker shado over tho common terrors to 11 iieeive that I must undergo the suffering t f death without the peace of the grave Man bears his igony for once md is done Mine mielit be borne to the bitterest extremity, but must be bomt with the keener bitterness of the knowledge ilmt it was in vain I w ıs recalled from those reveries to the world by ĺ paper dropped through а crevice in the r tfters above my head On seeing its sig n it ure Septimius v first impulse was to teir it in pieces But Esthers name struck me und I read through the letter You must not think me a villain though, I confess appearances are much in favour of the supposition But this morning, I bail no choice bt tween denying that I knew you and being utterly ruined This comes of discipline Titus is a disciplinarian of the first order, and the consequence is, that no man dares acknowledge nny little irregularity before him so far his morality propagált s knaves But I must clear myself of the chaige of having acted disinge
nuously by your admunblo daughter I fakt every power that binds the soul to witness tint I know not what is become of her nay, I am in the deepest anxiety to know the fate of one so louly somnoient and so high minded And now, print e that I am out of the reach of your frown let me have courage to disburdon my heart I have long known Es ther and as long loved her From the time when I was first received within your palace ш Naphtah, and I have not forgotten, that to yonr hospitality I then owed my life I was struck with her talents and her beauty When the war separated us and I returned to Rome neither in Rome, nor in the empire, could I see her equal To solicit our union, I gave up the honours and pleasures of the courl, fot the cam paign m your hazardous country I searched Judea in vain md it was chiefly in the vagne hope of obtaining some intelligence of Ľ=ther, that I solicited the command of our unfortunate mission Thore I felt ull hazard more than re paid by her sight to me lovelier than ever ' I will acknowledge that I prolonged my
confinement, to have the opportunity of obtain ing her hand But her religious scruples were unconquerable I implored her lea\e to e\ plain myself to you Even this, too, she refused, ' from her knowledge of your decision What then was I to do' Loving to excess, bewildered by passion, oppressed with disappointment, and seeing but one object on earth, my evil genius prompted me to act the dissembler " Under pietext of disclosing some secrets connected with your safety, I induced her to meet me, for the first and last time on the battlements There, I besought her to fly with me—to be my bride—to enjoy the illustrious rank and life that belonged to the Imperial blood, and when we were once wedded, to soli cit the approval of her family I was sincere, I take the gods to witness, 1 was sincere But my entreaty was in vain she repelled me with resolute scorn, she charged me with treachery to you, to hei, to faith, and sacred hospitality I knelt to her She spurned me In distrae tion, and knowmg only that to live without her was wretchedness, I was bearing her away to
tht 1 gate, when we were surrounded by armed men My single attendant fled I was over¬ powered, and forced to the gate, and I saw Esther, my lovely and beloved Esther, no There was an honesty ш this full confession, that did nore for the writer s cause than subtlti language The young Roman had been se¬ verely tried, and who could expect from a sol dier the self denial, that it might have been hard to find under the grave brow of philosophy ' Stern as time and trial had made me, I was not petrified into a contempt of the generous weak nesses of earlier years yet, to love a being like Esther—what was it, but to be just' and, while I honoured the high sense of duty which re¬ pelled a lover so dangerous to a woman's heart, I pitied and forgave the violence of a passion, lighted by unrivalled loveliness of form and mind It was growing late, and the steward, who made a virtue of showing me the more respect the more I was treated with seventy, came in to arrange my couch for the night, " he would
suffer no inferior hands to approach the person of one of the leaders of his fallen country. In truth, added he, " if I were not permitted to be your attendant to night, my pnnce might have been forgotten for every human being but myself is busy in the grand banquet- gallery " Sounds of instruments and voices arose " There, you may hear the music Titus gives a supper, in honour of the Emperor s birth day, and the palace will be kept awake until day¬ light for the Romans, with all their philosophy, are great lovers of the table, and Titus is re nowned for late sittings —Or would you wish to see them at their banquet ? so saying, he unbarred the shutters of a casement, command¬ ing a view along the gallery, of which every door and window was thrown open for the breeze If an ancient Roman could start from his slumber into the midst of European life, he must look with scorn on its absence of grace, elegance, and fancy But it is in its festn ities, and, most of ail, ш its banquets, that he would
feel the incurable barbarism of the Gothic blood Contrasted with the fine displays that made the table of the Roman noble a picture, and threw over the indulgence of appetite the colours of the imagination, with what eyes must he contemplate the tasteless and common-place dress, the coarse attendants, the meagre orna¬ ment, the want ot mirth, music, and intellectual interest—the whole heavy machinery that con verts the feast into the mere drudgery of de¬ vouring 1 The guests before me were fifty or sixty splendidly dressed men, attended by a crowd of domestics attired with scarcely less splendour, for no man thought of coming to the banquet n the robes of ordinary life The embroidered couch, itself a striking object, allowed the ease of position, at once delightful ш the relaxing climates of the south, and capable of combining with every grace of the human figure. At a slight distance, the table, loaded with plate ght- tenng under the blaze of a profusion of lamps, and surrounded by couches thus coverei« with rich draperies, was like a central source of light
radiating in broad shafts of every brilliant hue All that belonged to the ornament of the board was superb The wealth of the patricians, and their perpetual intercourse with Greece, made them masters of the finest performances of the arts The sums expended ou plate were enor¬ mous But its taste and beauty were essential to the refined enjoyment of the banquet Copies of the most famous statues and groups of sculp ture in the precious metals trophies of the victories of Greek and Roman models of the celebrated temples, were mingled with the vases of flowers and lighted perfumes, and, covering and colouring all, was a vast scarlet canopy which combined the groups beneath the eye and threw the whole into the form that a painter would love But tbe true skill was shown in the constant prevention of that want of topic, which turns conversation into weariness There was a per petual succession of new objects and excite ments. Even the common changes of the table were made to assist this purpose The coming m of each Course was announced by music, and
the attendants were preceded by a procession of muiHtreh dancing, chaplet crowned, and playing popular melodies Between the courses, a higher entertainment was offered in the Recitations, pleasantries read or acted by a cla°s of profes stonal sat rists of the absurdities of the day It is easy to imagine how fertile а source of interest tins must have been made by the subtle and splenetic Italian, moving through Roman life, the most various, animating, and fantastic scene, in which society ever shone The recitations were always looked to as the charm of the feast They were often severe , but their seventy was reserved for public men and matters The court supplied the most tempting and popular ridicule , but tbe reciter was a privileged person, and all the better humoured Cæsars bore the casttgation without a murmur No man in the empire was more laughed at than v espasian, and no man oftener joined in the laugh One of his morning's sports was to collect the burlesques of the night before, give them new pungency by a touch of the imperial pen, and then despatch them to
make their way through the world The strong- headed sovereign knew the value of an organ of public opinion, and used to call their perusal, "sitting for his picture" The picture was sometimes so strong, that the courtiers trembled But the veteran who had borne thirty years of battle, laid it up among " his portraits," laughed the insult away, and repeated Ins po pular s tying, " that when he was old enough to come to years of discretion, and give up the emperor, he should become reciter himself, and have his turn with the world " The recitations agun were varied, bv a sportive lottery, m which the guests drew prizes, sometimes of value, gems and plate , sometimes merely an epigram, or a caricature The banquet generally closed w.th a theatric dance by the chief public performers of the day, and the finest forms and most delicate art of Greece and Ibe na displayed—the story of Theseus and An adne, the flight of Jason , the fate of Semeie or some other of the brilli int fictions of their poetry In the preience of this vivid scene sat, tempering its wildness *y the majesty of
religion, the three great tutelar idols of Rome, Jove, Juno, and Minerva, of colossal height, throned at the head of the hall, completing, false us they were, the most smgular and daz¬ zling combination that man ever saw, of tbe delight of the senses with the delight of the mind To me human joy was always a source of en jovment, and in the sweet sounds of the harps and flutes, and the pleasant murmur of cheerful voices, I was not unwilling to forget the spot from which I listened But the pnsoner can not long forget bis cell, and closing the case ment I walked away ' Little I ever thought," sighed the old steward, " of seeing that sight But all nations hive fallen m their time, and perhaps the only wonder is, that Israel should have stood so long But it is still stranger to my eyes to see that gallery as it is to night many a long year it bus been shunned by Jew ard Roman alike, for the enemy give way to dreams and the fear of apparitions beyond any other people, and the mighty things done in the times of our
fathers, and which, though dishonoured m the mouths of the heathen, made their report know π through the earth, have made Judea a land of awe to its evil conquerors It is fifteen years this very day, since 1 saw the light of lamp or the foot of man, within those casements " ' Yet,' said I, " the great Ananus lived as became his rank, and there were then no d ш gers to disturb him in the midst of his people ' But there was one terrible event, which made those walls unhallowed, nay, even m this spot where we stand, I would not remam alone through the night, to have the palace for mv A rich and solemn strain of music that ushered in some change in the displays of the banquet interrupted m; question, while the old man s countenance assumed something of the alarm which he described ' That sound," said he, shuddering, " goes to my heart. It is the same that I heard on the night of death On that night Matthan the only son of my great master, was to be wedded to the daughter of the prince of Hebron,
end that gallery was bud out for the wedding feast, all the leaders of Jerusalem were there, all the noble women, all the chief priesthood , all the grandeur, wealth, and beauty of our tribe But Matthan was not the son of his fathers mind He was haughty, and the slave of passion, he had fled from his father's rooi years before, and taken refuge among the moun¬ tains The caravan passing through Galilee dreaded the name of Matthan, for he was bold, the chief of the hills saw his followers flying from his bide, for deadly was the spear of Mat¬ than , but he was generous, and often the slave rejoiced in the breaking of his chains, and the peasant saw his flocks cover the valley again, by the arm and the bounty oi Matthan "When he returned, danger or sorrow had wrought α change in turn like the passing from youth to ige His strength was withered, and his voice was broken down, like the voice of him that treads on the brink of the timely grave ' His noble father wept over him, and gave him welcome, and the palace was filled with
rejoicing for the coming back of the first horn But he took no delight m the feast, neither in the pruses of men, nor in the voice of the smger He wandered through his ftthers halls, even as the leopard, chained, and longing to escape to the desert and the prey ag un " Disturbances were beginning to be heard of m Jerusalem, and he fell into the hands of the evil Onus, the man of blood, betraft d hım into the secret ways of conspiracy against our conquerors His heart was bold, and his tern pei high, and he was easily drawn into the desperate game, by a villain, who stirred up the generous spirit of our nobles, only to sell their blood to Rome " He grew more lonely and violent d n day , he withdrew from the amusements ot his rank, and shut himself up in the wing of the palace ending in this towtr In this room, where we are sitting, I have seen his lump burning through the livelong winter nights, ind grieved over the sleeplessness that showed he was among the unhappy Into his chambir none were suffered to enter, but the moun

"I little dicamed what inhabitant wns then m this cell At last, а change was wrought upon him, he went forth, he took delight m the horse and the chariot, in the chase, and the feast, and the die He plunged into public life with the eagerness of one thirsting and bungenng for the applause of men He ha¬ rangued, he gave magnificent gifts, he filled up every hour with the labour of mind or body, like one to whom an hour of rest would be a blot in his existence His illustrious father, that he might bless his posterity before he died, coun¬ selled Ium to take to wife Thamar, the fairest and noblest of the daughters of Hebron The offer oi the alliance of Matthan was heard with joy, and the day of the marriage was ap¬ pointed "On that day I saw him come fiom the council hall, after receiving the congratulations of his friends I saw him passing along to his chamber, but I dared not cross him on his
way , I fled and hid myself behind the portal, even from the wrath of bis countenance He thought that he was alone , and then he gave way to his agony. Never did I behold such a countenance of wrath and woe It was bloated with prodigal living, and it was now flushed with wine, swallowed to drown thought, but misery was branded there. " He raved, he rent his bridal raiment, and cast it from him, he wept, he knelt and cursed the hour that he was born, he flung himsell upon the ground, and rolled in a convulsion ol rage and woe At the least sound he would spring up, and, drawing his scimitar, swear to put the intruder to death I remained in my refuge, yet more in fear of his countenance than of his sword He took letters fiom his bosom, read them, and then scattering their fragments in the air, devoted himself to ruin, devoted his Ime, Judea, the world " He tottered towards me, and I dreaded his rage at the discovery, but I saw, at a glance, that his mind was gone He was talking to the air, he clasped his hands wildly, his face
was covered with tears, he implored foi mercy, and fell. I hastened to bear Ium to a couch, be saw me not, but cried out against himself, as л betrayer and a murderer, the feeble slave of others' will, the guilty fugitive from honour, the criminal marked by the hand of Heaven ' I called for help His mountaineers rushed in they repulsed me, and, chiding him in then barbarian tongue, and seeming accustomed to those fits of sorrow, carried away in their irms the noble Matthan, complaining and crying like a child ' The evening fell, and I saw him ride forth at the head of Ins kindred to bring home the bride I he wretchedness of the day was past, and those who looked only on the lofty bearing, and heaid the joyous language of the leader of that tr tin, would have thought that sorrow had never touched his heart I watched for his leturn with fear and anxiety, for I deemed bis joy unhallowed and fearful " But, all was well, the bridal procession returned Mattban, glittering m jewels, came proudly reining bis steed white aa the snow,

But his gaiety was gone His countenance was wild and yet cold He looked like а man stricken to stone in the mulst of some fierce burst of passion He saw me not lie saw not the guests, he saw nothing but the dying lamp and the hurrying form. ( The chorus of the singing women announced that the bride was about to enter " I looked up at the tower, the lamp was twinkling its last, and the form was still seen wringing its hands The bridal preparations went on, and the hymn was hoard that denotes the ι eilmc of the bride But my eyes were fixed on the dying light, and the form, that now held a cup in it c hand A shriek was heard, so wild, that the guests sprang from their seats in alarm and astonishment My eye turned upon Mat than, but he had summoned up his strength, and,

But it is rumoured among the
attendants, that strange sights have been seen, and sounds of a bridal throng heard m the chambers through which their last melancholy march was made , though, whether it he truth, or the common fear of the vulgar, I know not, nor indeed wish too curiously to inquire "
CHAPTER XX As the old man spoke sounds arose not un suited to his tale But my inith m the legend did not amount to so sudden a realisation and I looked towards the gallery There from whatever motive every thing was in disturb ance The guests were hurrying from the tables Many had thrown the militaiy cloak over their festal robes eome were in the adjoining apart ments equipping themselves with arms and armour A group were standing round Titus evidently in tnxious consultation In the spa emus grounds below horsemen were mounting and attendants hurrying m all directions The calls of the clarion and trumpet echced through
the courts shortly liter, ι large body of ca valry came wheeling round to the portal of the gardens , und Titus went forth, conspicuous among the bustling crowd, for his manly com posure He give some orders, whi h were de spatched by tribunes galloping as for their lives, then, mounting Ins charger, rode slowly through the gates at the he id of his stately company himself the most stately of them all The woods surrounding the palace soon in tercepted the view of the imperial troop and after straining my eyes as long as I couid see the glitter of a helmet by the feeble moon, ind exhausting mv old companions understanding in conjectures of the cause oí this rapid ch mge, I turned to my casement, to make that pr lyer for the peace of Jerusalem which had been nightly on my lips from the hour wheu t ley first could pray and which no danger, nor sor row, nor disgust at mankind, nor the bitteiest despair, has ever silenced during ages From the dungeon has that suppl cation risen , írom the mine from the and sands of the wilder ness , from the savage shores of the farthest
ocean , from the bosom of the rolling waters, from the fires of the persecutor ; from the neld before the battle ţ from the field covered with its dead, from the living grave of the monk , from the cavern of the robber, from the palat e , from the scaffold ' While I continued in this outpouring of the soul, with my eyes fixed on the cloudy throne of Htm, whom no man hath seen nor can see ' the morn seemed to be advancing on the sky , α pale reflection spread over the masses of rolling vapour, it lingered, faded, grew richer, agam sank, and mght covered the earth, again swelled, and a fierce lustre turned the low and heavy clouds to the colour of conflagration "There is an attack on either the enemy s camp or the city," I exclaimed to my compa¬ nion, who was already dropping into slumber on his cushion (( Day break it cannot lit, for the middle watch has not been half an hour sounded H^lp me to escape , be but my guide through the chambers, and name your recom pense " The steward wrung his helpless hands, and
offered his life to my service, but described tht precautions of my jailers so fully, that I gave up the idea of immediate escape, and, after gazing at the sky until it became a sheet oi darkness onoe more, bade bim good night and flung myself down, to seek such rest as I coultl find upon my pillow But I was tossed by anxious thoughts, and sleep was a tardy visitant I heard the trt ad ing of the guard, till its recurrence irritated me The moanings of the wind through the frees told me that α storm was rising, and to get rid of the uneasy oonflict between the desire of sleep and the difficulty of shutting out thought, I rose, and watched the progress of ihe tem pest The lightnings flashed in broad beams througn the clouds, and the rain fell with the violenct of the southern storm But, through the Hash, powerful and deepening again shone the red illumination above the city, and neither the ro ir of the wind, nor the dash of the descending de luge, could extinguish tho shouts that, remote as they were, I knew to be shouts of battle
I measured the tower with my eye, I tried the strength of the bars, hut the attempt only erved to disturb mv companion, who had sur y íved his sorrows long enough to skep as soundly as if there were not a woe on eaTth W ien I used some of fhe common places of regret for the disturbance, " I am glad," said he, " that you awoke ще , for ï was dreaming the story of my unfortunate lord and his son over again ' " The natural result of your haviug so lately reuewetţ ite recollection, and of this having been the time of the catastrophe " " Aye, the time is much, ior every soul in the palace has had the story told to him to day the old retainers, who remember and weep over the days of their great master, are full of it There is perhaps scarcely a room under this roof where somo heart is not trembling tonight with ghostly fear, nor a peasants thatcb, wKre the death of Matthan and the Arabian has not made pile faces, nor a senti nel for miles round, who does not shiver at every falling leaf, and think of the shriek, the
avenging spuit md the bridegroom tricken ш his hour of pride But —Powers of Heaven preserve us ' look there ' I looked but it was to the old m ш whose countenance alarmed me with the idea that he had wrought his imagination to a hazardous extreme I took his cold hand, and telling him that I lelt myself unable to sleep, and should have the less merit in watching till morn gently laid his stiffened limbs on the couch and bade him try to rest He lay as unre sisting yet fixed as if he had been turned to ice But the eye stared through the casement till I followed its direction, yet with only the added belief that he was overcome by the common terrors of the household, for to me tenfold darkness lay upon every object from the ground to the battlements The departing officers and attendants kept the palace in tumult, but more than common urgency quickened them, and the last group and the last sound of voices soon passed awiy leaving ihe silence like the d rkoess eleeper than ever
I accidentally turned to the casement, and there—I saw а figure slight and shadowy, pass¬ ing backward and iorward in front of a quiver¬ ing lamp! My surprise was more startling than I would venture to communicate to my com¬ panion, already almost paralysed with iear But if I had conjured up а phantom to give force to the tat 3 , none could have been more closely similar The figure was enveloped in robes whose richness I could perceive evt n across the court, the gestures, the wild hurry of the pacings through the chamber, the general air of woe and distraction, were not to be mistaken. In the midst oi the silence 1 heard the creaking of bolts, and the fall of chains, that seemed to be at m side A single word followed, but that word ternblj comprehensive —" Death '' The sound was uttered m a hollow and sepul¬ chral tone, that left the imagination free to bh ipe the picture with what sullenness it willed But the sound was scarcely uttered, when I heard а shriek, wild as ever told of woe, saw
the figure sink down, und the lamp quiver, and expire ' The old man bad seen what 1 had seen, but the natural feeblenoFs of ago loft hun a mort helpless prey to superstitious fe-ir, und no attempt to explain ttuse smgular coincidences could calm him. He was convinced that the vtngeunce which had stricken his master s house was still abroad, and that he had beheld its munster Remonstrance was in vain, and he sank alterm\tely into the revenes and the stupefaction of spiritual terror I tended him with the more interest, from my being not altogether unimpressed with the possibility that his alarms were just I was no believer m tbe vulgar narratives oi super stition But nature has its mysteries tiuth or judgment might be commissioned from sources strange to human perceptions To give w αν to the workings of a sickly imagination, may oharactense the vulgar, the idle, and the weak , but to admit the power of Heaven to suspend its own laws for its own purposes, is among the soundest conclusions of the pious and the wise
"While I sat beside the couch, and watched the ebbs and flows of life, in a frame that I somotimes expected to see give way utterly, a j anıtı g of bolts agam struck my ear. I listened with a strange emotion. But the sound soon ceased, and I was firm again. 'Ihe old man had heard it, and in α new convulsion, grasped both my hands, and held me close The sound returned, it increased, I saw the wall of the tower open, and the figure stand before me " It is she, it is she," shuddennglv murmured my companion, fixing his eyes on it, aud holding me with the clasp of agony The heart beat thick within me But Τ inter¬ posed myself between the 'orpse-hke being whom 1 held in my arms, and the unearthly visitant, and demanded " for what purpose it had come ' The fagure started as I spoke, then, gazing intently on me as I turned to the light, threw up its ved, and fell at my feet The lovely Naomi was the spectre ' But per¬ fectly guiltless was the gentle girl of the ghostly ре *епоу of her presence, and the unfilial alarm into which she had thrown her adopted father,
whom she was delighted to find, but whom she candidly acknowledged, " she never dreamed of finding there ' " The t j« er contains a prisoner," said she tremblingly, " who must be saved this night, foi to morrow at day-break is his dreadful hour I knew that he would be condemned , and we agreed on a stgual by which I was to learn when the time was fixed I have watched all night for it, and almost betrayed myself by а ery of horror that I could not suppress at the sight of that signal just now. I had no re source but to bear my own message, and assist him myself in escaping from this place oi tyranny and sorrow " ' But, my child, who is the prisoner, or where ' ' She blushed, and said, " One who laved me when the world was against me He rescued me irom the hands of barbarians , and could I leave him to perish '" " Lead on then, and without delay , for day¬ break ts not far. But how shall we find our way to his dungeon f '

shipper poured out lus devotion But the time was flying , I insisted on interrupting this epi cunsm of the soul, and when Naomi found that she must feast no more she woultl allow none but herself the pleasure oi the surprise A sigh which swelled from the prisoner s heart, was echoed He turned suddenly, and pronounced her nume with a loudness of de¬ light, that nothing but the chance that protects the imprudent, could have prevented from bringing the guard upon us His quick eye soon caught me, where I stood in shadow, and he sprang forward to extinguish the intruder But the lamp saved us from the encounter, and lifting bis hands and eyes in amazement, he laughed as loudly as he had spoken. " In the name oi all the wondt rs of the world, exclaimed he, " are you here too* Where are we to meet next 7 We have met already in water, fire, and earth , and nothing is left for us now but the clouds Come, be honest, pnn e, and tell me whether it wds not lor the sake of some such experiment that vou ventured here, for between ourselves, it an
other hour finds us within these four walls, we shall know the grand secret, as assuredly as Titus wears а head, and has а scoundrel at his elbow " I was rejoiced to find lhat m attempting to save the life of Naomi s lover, I was discharging a debt to the preserver of my own To my mention of this service, he replied with soldier¬ like frankness, that, " I owed him no obli¬ gation whatever, he had long hated the in¬ tolerable insolence and cruelty of Cestius, and the debt was on his side, as I bad favoured him with an opportunity that every officer in the service would have been happy to possess His chastisement would do him good, ^s τ ell as the rest of the world, and thus, in fact, I might look upon myself as a benefactor to tlu human race " Naomi hung upon me, pale and anxiously listening to every sound abroad " This little trembler," said he sportively, as he took hei passive hand, " I am destined to meet always in alarm I first found her ilying from a troop of human brutes, who were robbing the baggage
of the Roman camp, I thought her worth something bitter than to keep goats on the Libanus, and weave turbans for some Syrian deserter, she was of the same opinion, and fell in love with me on the spot " Naomi ex¬ claimed ag unst this version of the storj " No matter for the mode," said lv, ' I give the facts I dazzled her ambition by the pro mise of a palace,—in the air, bi ibed her avarice by the display of a purse, unconscious of gold , and bewitched her senses by a speech, α smile, and a figure, that for the first time in my hie I found to be mesistible." Naomi again protested, and the dialogue might have consumed the night without their discu\ering the lapse of time , had I not inter¬ posed, and inquired, what further me ms of escape were ш our pow^r The lovely girl started from her waking dream, and pointed to α ring in the wall, which was connected with a concealed door I tried it, but it resisted my force At length we all strove at it together But no door opened Naomi wrung her hands " The unfortu

The legion aries posted to defend the valley were trampled down, and destroyed at the first charge De tacliment on detachment sent to extricate them, met with the same fate One of the few pn soners described the valley, when his detach ment reached its verge as having the look of ι living whirlpool, a vast and tempestuous rolling and heaving of infunate hfe, into which tht attempt to descend was instant desti uction " Every cohort that entered it, ' said the centu non, *' was instantly nigulphed, and seen no more.

We heaped the last Roman corpse on the pile, covered it with the broken spears, helmets, aud cu'iasses of the deul, and then left the care of the conflagration to the wind. From the valley to Jenisalem, our way was crowded with the enemy's posts, but the keen eye and agile vigour of the Jew eluded or anti¬ cipated the heavy-armed legionaries, by long experience taught to dread the night in Judea ,

herself as unexpectedly set at liberty as she had been seized At the gate of her prison the minstrel had met her and through the midst of the city, then m ils fiercest agitation, had with singular dexterity conducted her safeiy home A service of this kind was not to go unre¬ warded, and he was suffered to remain under oui roof until my return But by that time he had made his ground secure by such zealous service, and so many graceful and valuable qua littes, that even Miriam, sensitive and sagacious as she was, desired that he should he retained From his knowledge of the various dialects of Asm, and his means of unsuspected intercourse, but few events could occur of which he had not obtained some previous knowledge His adroit ness in availing himself of his knowledge I had already experienced ш mj escape fiom the gates, and it was to him that was due the flight of the negroes A stray eh irger, a mask, and the common juggler's contrivance of the breath¬ ing flames, made up the demon that defrauded the Ethiopian excht-quei But his dexterity m the arts of elegance and taste was singular his

had to sleep to-night at the bottom of the seo, I should wager my scimitar to a straw that our bodies would be found lying side by side I presume we mount the scailold to^ethtr to- n.orrow, for the benefit of Jewish molality. Well then, since our fat* s are to be joiued, let us begin by—supping together " He laid his store on the ground, but I was heart-sit к , and could only question luni ol Naomi and the misfortune whith hud betrayed him into the hands of the tyrant " Our history is the bntiest in the world," was the answer. " We found ourselves pursued, and we fled. The pursuers followed faster than my fair mistress could run, or 1 tould carry her. So, we were overtaken before we could i-leai the rocks And our captors were forthwith carrying us to the Roman camp in great joy at their prize But it was mtendod to be an unlucky day for the legions. We come across а Jewish troop headed by а ime bold fellow, who dashed upon the captors, and fluttered them like a flight of pigeons. Nothing could promise better than the affair, for my now captor turned out
to be au old friend, and one of the most gallant that ever commanded a trireme. Many α day the Cypnot and I chased (Nemesis for¬ give us for it 1 ) the pir.ttes through the Cyclades I, however, did not know then what pleasant personages the brothei s of the free-trade might 1)l " He smiled, and the sigh that followed the smile, told how little he had since found to lompens ite tor his old adventures. ' Your captoi was my son, my heroic Con¬ stantius ' ' I exclaimed Tin vt ry man When he had found me out under my Arab trappings, he was all hospitality, and invited me to share the honours of his princely iatlur's house His troop soon sec¬ tored, evtry man to his home, and I wus gazing at the head of an incomparable knave and early acquaiutantc, Jonathan, nailed up over the gate ior somt villany which he had not been as adroit as usual in turning to profit, when Constantius, myself, an*' that lovely and innocent girl, whom I tdi dl upv^r cť, e more" he stooped his brow at the recollection — " were seized by tlie
guard, separated, and sent, I suppose, alike to the dungeon " Shortly after midnight I was brought before the tnbunal. Ошав was my accuser, and I was astonished at the dexterity, number, and plausi¬ bility of his charges—magic, treachery, denial of my services to the country, the betrayal of my army, the refusal to push the defeated enemy to α surrender, lest by the cessation of the war my ambition should be deprived of its object, and last, and most astonishing, the assassination of my kınaman Jubal, through fear of his testimony. I made my defence with the fearlessness of one weary of life, and with the force of truth. Some of the charges I explained, others I promptly and effectually repelled To the im¬ putation of treachery I answered in a single sentence — " Read that correspondence with the enemy, and judge, which is the traitor " I took the Fgyptmns papers from my sash, and flung them on the table The aspect of my accuser at the words was
ono that might have made his sternest hater pity him He gasped—he trembled—he gnashed his teeth in rage and terror, and, finally, took refuge in the ranks of his followers. But the judges tnemselves were in visible perplexity they looked over the papers, held them to the lamps, and examined them in all imaginable ways, until the chief of the Sanhedrim rising, with а frown that fixed all eyes on me, flung the papers at my feet The deepest silence was round me as I took up the rejected proofs To my astonishment, they were utterly blauk ' I now recollected that, on my entrance, I had been pressed upon by the crowd. In that mo¬ ment the false papers must have been substi¬ tuted I saw the Egyptian gliding away from the side of Omas, and saw by the countenance of my accuser that the tidings of tb a robbery had just reached him He rose, and de¬ claimed against me with renewed energy. He was eloquent by nature the habit of public affairs had given e\en the form of his speaking that character of practical vigour and reality, which is essential to great public impression
lus passions were inflamed, his fortunes hung ш the scale—perhaps his life, and he poured out the whole collected impulse in a torrent of the boldest and most nervous declamation upon my head But my name was high, my rank was not to be lightly assailed, my national servicéi» were felt, and even the corrupt judicature summoned for my rum, were not so insensible to popular feeling, as to violate the forms of law to crush me lhe tnal lasted during the night. I had tho misery to sec my wife, my children, Constantius Naomi, my domestics, my fellow-warriors, every human being whom there was a chance of pei plexmg or terrifying into testimony, brought forward against me As a last resource, on the secret suggestion of the Egyptian, who had his own revenge to satisfy the adventures of the pirates cu em were declaimed npon, and the captain was summoned from his c«>Il His figure and noble physiognomy made him conspicuous ai d a general murmur of admiration arose on his advance to tho tribunal Miriam was at my side I felt her tremble, her colour went and
came and she drank in every tone of his voice with an intense anxiety But when, m answer to the questions of Onias, m detailed his story, and m answer to the ehurge of his bemg an enemy, denied that he was either Roman or Greek, Miriam's spint hung upon every woi d " A soldiers best pedigree," said he, conclu¬ ding, " is his sword I know no more than that I was reared m the house of a Cypnot noble to whom I had been brought by a trader of Alexandria My protector made me a sailor, and would h ive made me his heir but Roman insolence disgusted me, and I left my com¬ mand, bearing with rae no other inheritance than а heart too proud for slavery, my scimi tai and this signet which I bave worn from my infancy He took from his bosom n lai ge sculptured gem, fastened to a chain of pearls Miriam put forth her trembling hand for it, read, with a starting eye, her cwn name and mine, and exclaiming, " My son 1 my son ' ' tottered forward, and fell fainting into his arms I flew to them both, and never did my woe- warn heart beat with keener joy than when I
too clasped my son, my long-lost, my first* born. Yet clouds gathered instantly —Was ho not como to take the earliest embiace of his parents, m the crisis of their fate,—the promise of au unbrokeo lineage, given ш tho days when my country was in the jaws of destruction,— the son, the brother, the husband, awaking to those loveliest and happiest ties of our nature, only when the axe of the traitor, or the sword of the enemy, was uplifted to out them asunder for ever,—the prince, the patriot, the warrior, summoned to the first exercise of his noble eights and duties, when in the next hour a heap oi dust might be all that was left of him¬ self, his family, and his people ! I clung to him with a fondness thirsting io repay its long arrear. His desertion in the hanels of strangers, the early hardships, the loss of а mother's love and α father s protection, the insults and pr* nations that the struggler through the world must bear, the desperate hazards of his life, even the errors mto which necessity and circumstance had driven him, rose up w judgment against me, and I re-
proached myself for the acctdent, perhaps the irresistible accident, that gavo my и faut to the roaring waters But the tears and exclamations of the people round us recalled us I might then have walked from the hall without any man's daring to 1 iy a hand upon me T for the public feeling, touched by the discovery of my son, was loud for my instant libe.ation But I was not to be satisfied with this imperfect justice, and demanded that the tnbunal should pro¬ ceed The presence of my family was felt to be too strong for the fears of my accuser, and, de¬ manding no defence but truth, I implored of them to retire An impression, like that of tbe warning of a superior spint, struck on my mind us I pronounced the word It told me that I hud spoken the sentence of utter sepa¬ ration They came hand m hand to bid me farewell Constantius and Salome knelt be¬ fore me for final forgiveness My son and hi« betrothed bowed their heads to ask ray bless¬ ing Mint.ni and Esther came last, md silently
hung upon my neck, dissolved ш tears of match less anguish and love. I lifted my еуез and heart to Heaven, and, though oppressed with the terrible convictions ol my own fate, prayed for them, and put forth my hands, and blessed them ш the name of the God of Israel 1 saw them pass away My firmness could bear no щоге I wept aloud But with my sorrow there was given a hope— α light across the gloom of my soul Wheu I saw their stately forms solemnly move along through the fierce and guilty multitude, and the distant portal shut upou them, I thought of the sons and daughters of the gre »t patriarch, paesing withm the door of the ark. from tho mi 1st of a. con demned world Tbe mght was worn out, the people ex¬ hausted by the length of a ínul, protracted for the purpose, hud left the hall nearly empty, ond Omas, now secure of a tribunal that dreaded nothing but tiie public eye, urged the decision The judges were his creatures, through corruption or fear, his followers idone remained. Sure to be crusbed, the fluctua
tions ot ht pe were gone, ond I listened to the powerful md high wrought harangue of my enemy without a movement but of admiration for his extraordinary powers, or of pity for their perverter While he stood drinking in with ears and oyea the wonder and homage f the audnnce, I myself called for sentence " Scorning " said I, " to reason with under- stanaings that will not comprehend, and con¬ sciences that cannot feel, I appeal from the man of blood to the God of mercies, from the worse than man of blood, from the corrupter of justice, to Him who shall judge the )udge to the Mighty and the Holy One, who shall vet pass sentence ш the sight of earth and heaven " The chief α sessor rose, my condemnation was upon a lip quivering and pale he had already m his hands the border of the robe which he was to rend, m sign that the nitused was rent from Israel A confusion at tl e portal checked hım , and the words resounded, " Beware' shed not the innocent Mood " The voice was as a voice from the sepulchre, deep, melancholy, but searching to the very heart*
The guard gave waj, ard a man covered from head to foot with α sepmoUral garment rushed up the immense hall At tho foot of the tribunal he flung off tho garment, and disclosed a face and form that well might ha\e ranked bun among the dwellers of the grai e " I have come from the tombs/ exclaimed he " I had lain down to die in the resting place of my fathers, in the valley of Jehosaphat A man in white raiment stood beside me, and commanded me to come, and bear witness of tht truth The Romans weie round me, he led me through them,—the battlements were before mt he led me through them,—not, fury, and frenz> stood in my path through your city, he led mt through them,—and lo' here I come, and proclaim by his command, ' Beware '—shed not the innocent blood.'" Onias stood paralysed No memory of mme could recall the haggard features of the stranger. The chief of the tnbunal, in manifest confusion, required his name. " My name," he answered, with α wild wave of his band, "is nothing—air—is gone What I was, ts past; what I shall be, the tom h

Tht remnants of huge fires round pillars ot timber explained the nrjstery The enemy had undermmed the wall, and, by burning the props, had brought it down at the time of then assault. Onias, the planner of the attack, tor which he was to be repaid with the procurator- ship of Judea, bad placed me m the spot wl tie rum was to begin, and cheered his dying mo¬ ments with the certainty that, acquitted or not, there I must be undone I long lay contused and powerless among the rums. But the twilight air rev iv ed n.e, and I crept through the deserted mtrench- ments of the enemy, until I reached one of the gates, where I announced my name, and w as received with rejoicings. The heart of my countrymen was heroic to the last, and deeply was its heroism now de raanded, for the whole force of the enemy had been brought up for final assault, and when I entered, every portion of the walls was tht scene of unexampled battle Where the ground suffered the approach of troops, the enemy's columns, beaded by archers and slingers m-
munti able rushed to the rampart, climbing up the I reaches with their shields over their heads Ag unst the towers were wheeled towers filled with troops who descended on the wall, and fought us baud to hand Wc felt the perpetual blows of the b ittertng rams shaking *he batt e ments under our feet Where the ground repelled direct issault there the military m ι chines pouied havock, and those were the most dieaded oi all The skill of man, exerted for ages on the arts of compendious slaughter, has scarcely pi oduced the equals of those horrible engines They threw masses of unextinguishable fire, ol boiling watf'r of burning oil, of red hot flints oi molten met it from distances that precluded defence and with a for e that nothing could resist The catapult sliol stones of а hundred weight from the distance of furlongs, with the Rtraightness of an arrow and with an impulse thai ground every thing in their way to pow der lhe fortilule that scorned the Roman spear and exulted in the sight of the со hunns mounting the scaling ladders, as mount ing to sure destruction, quailed before the
tremendous power of the catapult The smgu lar and ominous cry of the watcher that gave notice of its discharge, " The son cortieth, ' wus a sound that prostrated every man npon his face, until the crash of the walls told th it the blow was given Every thought that 1 had now for earth was m the tower of Antonia But there the legion« rendered approach impossible, nnd 1 could only geze from a distance, nnd see, in the bitterness of my soul, the e lemy gradually forcing their way from rampart to rampart It was ш vain that I strove to collect a fevr who would join me m a desperate attempt to succour its defenders I was left alone, and sadly sitting on the battle¬ ments, I took tbe chance of some fnendly spear or stone Through all tbe roar I heard tbe voice of Sabat the Ishmaelite, fhe eternal " "Woe '— woe '—woe '" loud as ever, and in appalling unison Viti the hour He came rushing along the wall with the same rapid and vigorous stride as of old, but lus betrothed no longer lollowed him. She was borne in his arms I The stones from the engines thundered against the wall, they tore up the strong buttiesses like
Weeds, thev struck away whole ranks of men, and whhled their remnants through the air.

Roman nolity , and, to the last howr of our na¬ tional existence, Rome held out offers of peace, and lamented our iia.itic determination to bt undont But tho decree was gone forth from a mightier throne During the latter days of the sioge, о hostility, to which that of man wai> as the gram of sand to the tempest that drives it on, overpowered our strength and senses. Fearful shapes and voices in the air, visions startling us from our short and troubled sleep, lunacy in its most hideous forms, sudden death m the midst of vigour, the fury of the elements let loose upon our unhheltered heads, we had every terror and evil that could beset human nature, but реь ttlencc, the most probable of all щ a city crowded with the iamishing, the diseased, tht* wounded and the dead Yet, though the stvtets weie covered with the uubuned, though eveiy wall and trench was teeming, though six hundred thousand corpses lay flung over the rampart, and naked to the sun—-pestilence came not, for if it had come, the enemy would hav e been scared away. But the " abomination of de¬ solation," the pagan standard, was fixed« wbeie
it wus to remain until the plough passed over the nuns of Jerusalem ' On this night, this fatal night, no man laid his head upon bis pillow Ht at en and eartn were in conflict Meteors burned above us the ground shook under o ir feet the \olcano blazed the wind hurst forth in irrebistibls blasts and swept the living md the dead in whirlwinds far into the desert We heard the bellowing of the distant Mediterrane in as if itt.

We hovled to the caverns to hide ns ; we plunged into the sepulchres, to escape the wrath that consumed the living ; we would have buried ourselves under the mountains. I knew +ho cause, the unspeakable cause, and knew that the last hour of crime was at hand. A few fugitives, astonished to see one man among them not sunk into the lowest fee¬ bleness of fear, came round me, and besought me to lead them to some place of safety, if tuch were now to be found on earth. I told them openly, that they were to die; and coun¬ selled them to die in the hallowed ground of the Temple. They followed; and I led them, through streets encumbered with every shape of humait suffering, to the foot of Mount Moriah But beyond that, we found advance impossible Piles of cloud, whose darkness was palpable even in tbe midnight in which we stood, co¬ vered the holy hill. Impatient, and not to hb

Titus himself, at the most imminent hazard, forced his way to the portal, and besought mc to surrender, and save the Temple. But Jerusalem was marked for ruin. Whih I wa3 m the very act of checking the shower of spears, I heard the voice of one of those extra ordinary beings who, by mad predictions of the certain succour of Heaven, kept up the resist ance whilf there was a man to be slaughtered He was standing on the roof of a vast cloister, surrounded with a crowd of unfortunate men, whom his false prophecies were infuriating against the offer of life I recognised the im¬ postor, by whom the Roman mission had been destroyed The legionaries pointed m vain to the flames already rising round the cloisters But the predictions grew bolder still, and tht words of truce were answered by showers of mis siles The flames suddenly burst out through the roof, and the whole of its defenders, to the uum ber of thousands, sank into the conflagration "When I looked round after the shock, the im postor, without a touch of fire on his raiment, VOL III S

It was the fifth hour · the sun was scorching up their strength { and I looked proudly forward to victory and the preservation of the Temple. As I was standing on the portal of the court of the sanctuary, and gazing at the march of the defeated troops towards the tower ot An¬ tonia, I heard the voice of the Demoniac close to my ear.—" I told you that this day would end in nothing without me ' I turned, but he was already far away among the crowd, and before I could even speak, I saw him, torch in hand, bound mto the Golden window beside the
v I of tho Holy place The inner Temple was instantly m а blaze Our cries, and the sight of the flames brought b ick the enemy at full speed I saw that the fatal hour was come, and collecting a few brave men *ook my post before the vail of the Portico, to guard the entrance with my blood But the legions rushed onward, crying out that " thev were led by the Fates, and that " the God of the Jews had given his people and *· ty into then" hands ' The torrent was irres ıstı ble Titus rushed in at its head, exclaiming, that " the Divinity alone could have given the strong hold mto his power, for it was beyond the hope and strength of man ' My devoted companions were torn down in an instant. I was forced back to the vail of the Holy of Holies, fighting at random in the midst of the legionaries, who now saw no enemies but each other In the fury of plunder, they deluged the Portico and the Sanctuary with mutual blood The golden table of Pompey, the golden vine the trophies of Herod, were instantly torn
away Subordination was lost The troops trampled upon their officers Titus himself was s wed only by cutting his way through those madmen But I longed to tlie and give my last breath, and the last drop of my veins, to the seat of Sanctity and Glory I fought—I taunted—I heaped loud scorn and reprobation on the profaners —I was covered from head to foot with gore, but it was from the hearts of Romans—I toiled for death, but I remained without a wound Yet, woe to the life that came within the sweep of my scimitar The last blow that 1 struck wis at an impious hand put forth to grasp the vail that shut the Holy of Holies from the human gaze The hand flew from the body, and the spoiler fell groan mg at my feet He sent up an expiring look and I knew the countenance of my persecutor Cestius But a new enemy was come, conqueror alike of the victor and the vanquished— fire I heaid its roar round the sanctuary The Ro mans, appalled, fled to the portal but they
were doomed A wall of fire stood before them Ί hey rushed back, tore down the vail, and the Holy of Holies stood open The blaze melted tbe plates of tbe roof, in α golden shower above me. It calcined the marble floor, it dissipated in vapour the ines¬ timable gems that studded the walls AH who entered, lay turned to ashes So perish the profaners' But on the sacred Ark the flame had no power It whirled and swept m a red orb round the untouched symbol of tbe tbrone of thrones Still I lived, but I felt my strength giving way the heat withered my sinews^—the llame extinguished my sight I sank upon the threshold, rejoicing that death was inevitable Then, once again, I heaid the words of terror » — Taruy гнои till I comb —Theworld disappeared from before me.

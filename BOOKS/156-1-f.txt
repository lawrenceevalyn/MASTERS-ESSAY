gleet which had embittered the wed¬ ded life of Mrs. Verhoft, wh», anxious· only to prove to her lover the supe¬ riority of love over the dirty dross of liebes, married him in a moment of pas¬ sionate enthusiasm, and lamented the effects of her hasty folly through man/ years of Cool reflection. An inereasmg' family brought with it many wants, which a small and not increasing income scantily supplied; and the lover who had blessed the romance which had efta tleaïcd the mistress, frequently blamed, with no small asp-rity, tbe nonsensical stuff, whicli had no charms in the me¬ mory of a husband who daily groaned under its wide-extended influence. Some years of anxious Struggles suc¬ ceeded, and five children added more to their cares than tbeir comforts, when the death of a distant relation unexpectedly gave tbem wealth.

Isabella,
Isabella, with the romantic generosity of youth and inexperience, would will¬ ingly have overlooked this sad event» and have convmced her lover that her affection was independent of all worldly considerations, and Pluhpson was fully inclined to be equally absurd, for he fancied, like a raw college boy new to love and the world, that a wife so beau¬ tiful and so affectionate to share and alle¬ viate his cares, must recompense him for all his sufferings Love and a cottage, brown bread and potatoes, with the clear waters of the brook, appeared to tbem sufficient, and they beheved they should m their own persons revive and realize tlic blissful but visionary scenes of the ancient Arcadia Fortunately for them both, Mis Vernon saw with oidei and more experienced eyes, and positively prohibited aUfutureintercourse,till more fortunate prospects opened on tbe young divine A curacy of eighty pounds α -year appeared to her saber and reason¬ able
able mind in a very different view from that vi hieb «truck on the romantic ima¬ gination of Isabella. She could pierce through the brilliant veil with which love dazzled their optics, and see a dreary futurity, which poverty would embitter, and love himself refuse to soften. Unwillingly, and with many com¬ plaints of her extreme and ill-judged se¬ verity, they at last were obliged to yield to her authority, and solace themselves' with a distant view of the future. That forlorn, and almost desperate hope of a college living, alone presented itself; and tbe fellowship which Philipson had so lately laughed at, became now a wel¬ come resouiee He became a fellow— accepted the cm асу of Fairfield, and seemed to have no better chance than a drowsy dream of a tolerable living at the sober age of lift} when he would per¬ haps receive the í 'and of the no-longer fair Isabella from a sense qf honour —a poor succedaneum for love. The
The offers of Mr Arlingham to Miss Vernon opened a bnghter prospect to Isabella, for he was the patron of Fair field, and the incumbent was upwards of seventy No doubts could be entertain¬ ed of Mr Arhnglnm s desne to befriend the family of his wife when opportunity offered and Elizabeth having related to him the severe disappointment sus¬ tained by ber sister and Mr Phibpson, ventured to hint at the power he pos¬ sessed of one day giving them ease and affluence, by giving him the neb rectory m his presentation Elisabeth was a little surprised that her lover was very spai ing of his obser- v ations on the occasion, and somewhat indignant when he told her that he had, through life, made it a maxim never to giv с a promise of patronage which fu¬ ture events might render lum indisposed to perform At the same tune, he said it was very improbable that he should ev er wish to give the rectory in question to
to any one ebe , and that in the mean time, a small vicarage, of about a hun dred and twenty pounds a year, contigu¬ ous to Fairfield, and tenable with the cu¬ racy, so as to enable hiin to serve both, was likely to be almost immediately m his gift, and he should gladly present that to Mr Phibpson, if he thought tbat a, sufficient inducement for leaving col¬ lege, and thus relinquishing the certain, though distant preferment, which would he his m the course of years On this head Mrs Vernon was to be consulted, and her prudent fore ι ought would nave induced her to forbid а mar nage wluch still seemed full of hazard The young people, however, petitioned Mr Arhngham said so much, that Kb ïabeth insisted that it amounted to a promue, and she privately insinuated the assistance she should herself be both able and happy to afford and Mr Ar hngham at last tnmed tbe balance m Mrs Vernon s wavering mind, by giv mg
mg up to Isabella the few hundreds which were the property of Ehzabeth.and which would enable tbe young people to furnish the small vicarage, and bogin the world m tolerable comfort She at length, though still reluctantly, consent¬ ed and the happy sisters agreed, at tbo instigation of Phibpson, to be married on the same day Mrs Venions objections were again overruled, and she was prevailed on not to forbid the plan She was not then aware of the year qf grace, the advan¬ tages of which Phibpson imprudently gave up by marrying m such haste An income of between two and three hun dred a year was made up for the young parson and as he decided not to wait for the death ot the hearty incumbent of 1 airfield, she could offer no reasonable objection for his delaying his marriage upon any other view, since nothing else appeared in the interim Mr Arhngham was better mformed of
of college business, and was well aware that Phibpson very foolishly gave up a considerable sum. He mentioned to hint the prudence and propriety of wait¬ ing to secure this money which his year of grace afforded ; but Mr. Phibpson was too much in love to be wise; and Mr. Ar¬ hngham, at his request, promised to keep his folly a secret from Mrs. Vernon ; but 1 the cold look and emphatic shrug plainly bespoke Ms sentiments on the occasion, and those sentiments evidently tinctured his future manners towards his intended brother-in-law The smiles and joy which reigned around reconciled Mrs. Vernon in some measure to the precipitancy of Isabella's marriage, and she hailed with delight the returning smiles and bloom on the cheek of her happy daughter. It was settled that Althéa should ac¬ company Elizabeth on a tour they pro¬ jected to the Lakes, and gieatly they wished that Mr. Arlingham would ex¬ tend
tend the invitation to Isabella and Mr. Pluhpson, whom prudence would other¬ wise necessaiily confine at home, but Aıhngham was silent on the subject, and deheacv foibade Ebzabcths inter¬ ference Isabell i, who was of a very retired and domestic turt, seemed not to notice the omission, and Pluhpson, though lie would have bked the frohe, was too much a lover to regret its loss, since Isa¬ bella would be with him, and she was " all the it» Id ' The furnishing and beiutifying the pretty little vicarage would amply and delightfully occupy their time, and Mrs Vernon, at least, was glad they were not included in a tom w hich tVieti situation would render very unnecessary The day at length arrived winch was to unite the two pairs orlovers, and the diffeience of their prospects and condi¬ tion was apparent in the difference of their destinations on that important oc- casion
Cisión. Elizabeth'« delicacy and affec- tìou ßit her sister, forbade any display of dress er ornament beyond What Isabella coald afford to imitate, írtul a plain white muslin, with an "legantlace cap and veil, equally adorned each lovely girl. But after breakfast Ehzabeth exchanged this »imple attire for an elegant habit and hat ; and taking atı affectionate leave of her family, was handed, by the grave and sober Arlingham, to a splendid landau. Althea followed, and the carriage drove eft? in a dashing style, with four beauti¬ tul hörses and two· flashy out-riders; whilst Isabell« and her husband, in a humble hack chaise, drove quietly to Fermant Vicarage.

taken plac», but still they would intrude, and with tbem a fearful idea that she had been too yielding in allowing of so precipitate л marriage as tbat ot Isa, bella She had found it impossible to resist the importunate entreaties of Plu¬ hpson, or the wishes, better imagined than expressed, of both her daughters, and as she listened to their animated pic¬ tures of the future, and Isabellas intend¬ ed appropi lation of her small but suffi¬ cient income, she fancied then that she was not blamable in giving her sanction to an immediate union The sisters seemed to depend entirely en Arhng¬ ham's future pationage, and Philipson himself, though he had been disappoint¬ ed m the manneis oflus neh biother-in- law, which, quiet and cool to all, had been invariably соИ and distant to him¬ self, yet believed he would not refuse to assist the family of bis wife, if it should hereafter be required But though all these hopes had appeared to Mis Vei¬ non,

persuaded to give. But George Vernon was older in pnidence than in years, and highly approved the resolution of Ar¬ lingham in never making promises— a plan which be determined to adopt. He had intended to have been at the wed¬ ding of his sisters, but a few days before he had sent a letter of careless congratu¬ lation and good wishes, and without as¬ signing any sufficient reason, had declar¬ ed his inability to be present at the ee¬ iemony. He praised Elizabeth's choice, because Mr Arlingham was rich, and quizzed Isabella and " the parson," of whose future comforts he drew a ridicu¬ lous, but not very fraternal picture; and strenuously advised Altlıca to profit by the opportunity afforded her by the vi¬ sit she was about to pay at Westhaven Park, and make as good a match αϊ her elder sister had done. All this, now that Mrs. Vernon was left to herself, preyed upon her spirits, and repentance, as far as related to Isa¬ bella,
bella, came aggravated by the conviction that it came too late She felt the want of Althea at this moment, whose regu¬ lated and sensible mmd, and buoyant spirits, had always been ber greatest comfoit in former tioubles. She regret¬ ted she had not accompanied Isabella home, where the sight of their happiness (present happiness at least) might lave reconciled her to herself Her eldest girl did not live at home, and her house, so 1 itely the scene of gaiety and bustle, and filled with smiling faces, now seem¬ ed melancholy m the extreme From this uncomfortable state she [was roused by the unexpected arnval ¡of a very old md valued fnend, who cime unknowing of the events of the lnoimng, to pass a few weeks with Mrs. Vemon To this lady, Mrs Letiti* Charlton, Mis Vernon recapitulated the wh^le affur, and felt relieved by the communication Her spnits revived as she listened to her sensible old friend, c ä and

They appeir very pleasing, I allow, but that comfoi table spirit of opposition, so unfortunately im¬ planted m »lost minds, alone makes tbem seem doubly desirable, because to yoa unattainable Arhngham is, unluckily, not popular, for his habits are not those of conciliation, and consequently, those w ith whom he is at variance are more qit to bc pitied and over-rated, whilst he is, perhaps, undeservedly blamed " " But is it not hard, very hard, that I, whose habits were alwa} s so far remov¬ ed from any liung hke disputing, should be thus tied for life to sueh a quarrel¬ some creature ' ' Altliea smiled a little archly—"How fir you may claim any ment for good hu¬ mour, in a situation which never offered any inducement to a contrary conduct, 1 know not, but surely jou will not f 6 boast

"At the expence of your own quiet, ' said Althea, reproachfully " well, you must act as you please, but I must do tbe same, and as I find I cannot do any good by staying, I must be allowed to accept Mis Chailton s invitation and I shall accordingly write to day, and m vite her, with your leave, to come foi me vvhenevei it suits her I will come igam to you, however, whenever I can do any real good but do not send for me upon every frivolous dispute, of whicli you have so many—Itemember, Lhzabeth, though I call tbem, as in themselves separately they are, ft tvolous, they become, in the aggregate, dreadfully and fatally serious ' Three days after this conversation, Mrs Charlton αϊ rived at Westhaven, and such w as the effect Althea s advice lud at the time on her sister, that dunng that ladys continuance there, all wis peace and harmony, and Mrs Chailton really left them impressed with an idea that

He pressed her very cordially to return speedily to Westhaven, and actually presented

than she had witnessed at Westhaven Mrs Charlton promised to take her to 1 eltham Vicarage early in the spring, and desiring her m the mean time to make herself easy about her sisters, and enjo} the novel pleasmcs of a London winter, she amply provided her with the means, and set her the example by bei own cheerful participation —soberly Mis Charlton s acquaintance was very select, and of course not very extensive She had no saving clause for high-bred vice, nor did she disdain humble vutue Hei own mannei s, at once easy, correct, ад J al.vays cheerful, intimidated the u. cious, and inspired tlie good with confi¬ dence , and her house was the chosen re¬ sort of the gny, the young, and the ami able of both sext s, at the same time that it was the asylum of the unfoitunate und the refuge of the unhappy Do not let it be inferred from this that Mrs Charlton was a inethodistical woman, averse to gaiety and amusement—far it um
from it Sht was truly and ferventh religious, and she best shewed the true nature of religion, by its cheerful influ¬ ence on her spirits and temper She had not passed through her youth with¬ out many and 'cry severe trials, but the God in whom she trusted had assist¬ ed her through them , and though she had not ceased to remember and to feel, she gneved, if she still did grieve, in so htude—"I have no right," she would say, " to vex or trouble others with iny sorrowful feebngs A little exertion will bear mc through the hours I must give to society, and there are always times of retirement, for tbe indulgence of melancholy emotions, without damp¬ ing the spints of those around us " All this required an efloit, but Mrs Charlton was equal to any thing which made others happy, though at the ex¬ pence of her own feelings at the time Althea, to whom London itself w as a nov elty, and a source of continual plea¬ sure

when he can make her a pattern for me, seems to have lived with her hands m pastry, her feet in an old pair of wooden clogs, which I am often shewn, and her few ideas immersed in herbs, presei ves, and distilled waters, and. truly the small portion of brains nature bestowed on her only son, seem to be employed in matters very little more useful, and not so pacific However, madam Ailingham, meaning my magnanimous self, iny deai, is still the envy of the poor and humble, who gaze on the elegant carnage which rolls lazily through the paik, and fancy the lady wiapped m ' them there beau¬ tiful furs' must be as happy as she is warm Now and then a few noisy hun¬ ters enliven the scene, but,fortunatelyfor me, they drml. too mudi unne for Ai ling ham to invite them often Then I hav e occasionally a grand melancholy paity of starched county folks, who sit in judg¬ ment on ill they heai and sec, and whose whole conversation is respecting high shenfis,
sheriffs, grand junes, and the last county ball, where theypnde themselves on be¬ having rudely to the town families, with¬ out whose co-oper ition they must have sat still, or danced with their own Ian And yet amongst all this delectable dul- ness, I have the great satisfaction of knowing that Mr Arlingham thmks I ought to be the happiest creature alive, because I am mistress of Westhaven Park and a coach and my old friends ibout the Lea envy me for having mar¬ ried so uncommonly well w luist I envy those who are not married at all, or my sister Isabella, who writes m a style of happiness which would set aU grandeur at defiance " 1 perceive my Iettei consists princi¬ pally of compi unts You will lecture me, I know, for not being able, in a situ¬ ation hke mine, to find something to be happy with Wc don't quarrel much, foi Arhngham comes in tired to death to a very late dinner, of which lutre soup and

I believe men never forget, and seldom forgive from the heart, offences committed against thein by their wives, though they expect a very different tum of ideas from them; and thus it is that a woman's influence over her husband once lost, is never, by any future concessions, regained in any considerable degree, .particularly vvheie that of /¿Ü relations is allowed to preponde¬ rate, which is too often the case. Wlien people talk of positive happiness or mi¬ sery in married life, without any inter¬ mediate state of feeling, I am persuaded they are wrong. There is a gradual scale of sentiment—bliss, felicity, happiness, comfort, indifference, unhappiness, mi¬ sery. Now, in my opinion, much of the last is incurred by girls (I say girls, be¬ cause
rause men are always better informed as to the real nature of conjugal feehng) in sistmg upon the first They despise mere comfort, and after ill, I behev e that is the most easdy attained, and for funate are those couples, who in aescend- mg from the highest step, where they seldom remam even so long as the honeymoon, can stop at comfort Eh žabcih, I dare saj, will go one step low ei, md hit upon indifference If Is ι bella descends it will be to positive mi sci) "Oh 1 soonei may she bc removed fiom bliss on caith to bhss m heaven ' said Altlıca And so she would be for so well do I know bei affectionate lieart, that I am certain unkindness from Pluhpson would piove her death wai imt " We are going to grow inelancholv, said Mrs Charlton, observing the teai fut eyes of Althéa " I am glad to see Mi bedley and Mis Moieton approaching vol ι и the)

manly violence, which bad broken for ever the charm between them. He de¬ termined to make one penitential effort the following day ; and if that failed, she might go to the devil. He tried—be failed; but Althéa did not " go to the deyil." In the mean time, Altliea was relating to Mrs. Charlton tbe events of the even¬ ing, and was gratified by receiving her approbation at tbe close of her narrative. —" But I assure you," added Altliea, with something approaching to regret in her conptensmce, apd a stifled sigh, " I assure you J was very nearly taken in by thje man's «pecious manners and de¬ ceitful looks. I could liuve loved him, I really believe, and am very thankful that be pulled off that pleasing mask before I was irrevocably caught. I shall never be in such danger again, for I promise you I shall be doubly wary and suspici¬ ous in future." JMrs. <3torjton smiledr^· 1 ' Suspicion," said
said she, " is so little the attribute of youth, that this—what shall I eail it? —may I venture to say disappointment? —this error of yours in judgment will soon lose its prudential effect You will again believe in appearances, and again be deceived; fbr you, ingenuous and tamable aa you are, will not be able tq detect the thousand artifices which are practised to conceal the real temper and disposition. · Wrottesley is too impetu¬ ous to be artful, and the unexpectedness of the incident threw him off his guard. Perhapa some private pique, or dislike towards Mr. Boston, might rankle in his mind." " Oh! say no more,if you mean to be the advocate of Mr. Wrottesley," laid Althéa. " His only excuse is, that he Miai thrown off his guard.

Sedleyknew this,butheraeanly shut his eyes, or pretended to do so, to the truth, and took no other notice of the «¡icumrtance than to endeavour to avail himself of it by borrawing money of his wife, after he knew Mrs. Charlton had been -with her. At first she was ab¬ surd enough to acknowledge the tact, «pd give him the supply bestowed for a far different purpose, and this from a no¬ tion of duty ; but Mrs. Charlton con¬ vinced her that such an exeition of obe¬ dience was not only unnecessary, but wrong; and Sedley could no longer de¬ prive her of this only resource, though lie made it a conţinuţii cause of dispute, and
atid a plea for nevét advancing any bim¬ self. ÏIrs. 'Charlton was precisely the «on. of woman tb manage a négociation of kindness with address and delicacy, and Mrs. Sedley received the "little prestia for lite children" without feelmg hilht- blcd, and without the Inöst distant idea that tbe conversation between herself and her husband had reached the cars of any one. Mts. Charlton fully understood the difficult art of conferring a favour. No impertinent advice degraded the re¬ ceiver, or took from the pleasure of ac¬ cepting the useful gift. Her heart was all benevolence—her manner all kind¬ ness. She left Mrs. Sedley at least less wretched; and congratulated herself that she had arranged her leaving Färnhitm that day, when upon going dowh stairs, she saw various packages directed to Mrs. Layton in the hall, and that lady's confidential abigail busily employed iti receiving others from the chaise from which

CHAPTER XVHI. Гот nuglit tlınt I could ever read, Could ever Ileal ly tule or historj, The course of true love never did run smooth. SlUkUIFEAttC. Althea had now nearly had enougii of London and its pleasures. She began to languish for the delight of seeing Isa¬ bella, and sharing in all the quiet enjoy¬ ments of the vicarage. Her new-found experience, however, had made her sus¬ picious, and she intended to watch even Phibpson very narrowly. Mrs. Charl¬ ton had promised to take her to Feltham whenever she went; and as that lady had some business which detained her a little longer in London, Althea was obUged to restrain her impatience, and defer
defer a week oı two her wished-for change of abode 'Ihe conversation during their dnve home naturally turned upon those whom tbey had just left, and Althea could not suppress hereunositj to know why Mrs Sedley 'w as so evidently the peculiar с ire and favourite of Mrs Charlton, since she had owned there was no rela¬ tionship between thein •"Your curiosity is natural enougii, iny dear," replied Mrs Charlton, " and it shall be gratified, though to do so I must enter into some httlc detail of my они only history, which may tax jom jinticnce You know I was an only child, and heiress to а ν eıy tonsiderablofortune, anil tins ι η cumslance j on will not doubt, obtained foi me v a j eaily notice from the neighbouring fannhts who had sons lo dispose of, and bom the sons tbcm stiv es I « as not then the plain, pale, homelv person I am now, and I had not to tonrolain of а dearth of lovcis Mj voi ι к heart
heart soon made its own election ; and so fond were my parents, so indulgent to all my wishes, that though tlie chosen of iny affections was not the man they had mentally selected, they did not offer any opposition, and I believed myself the happiest creature in existence., Mr. El¬ mington was young, gay, and handsome; be was, besides, extremely sensible and well-informed, and appeared devoted to me. „Could a girl of eighteen expect more? I thought not of temper, for I never sawrhim otherwise than perfectly amiable, nor heard a seqtimentbut such as seemed to be the echo of my own. In short, Mr. Elmington appeared every thing which I or my parents could de¬ sire, and the preparations for our marri¬ age went on .rapidly. " Businessjelating to some of the mar¬ riage articles required Mr. Elmington's presence in town. My father's house was in Dorsetshire, and the immense dis¬ tance to wliieh he was condemned fbr a Sew
few days, offered a subject of most pa¬ thetic complaint to my lover. Every day for a week brought letters full of be- wailings at his cruel fate, which compel¬ led so long an absence, and I regularly replied in the same tone of despondency. The second week he seemed to bear it better, whilst I really bore It worse, for I began to find something not altogether satisfactory in his letters ¡ yet they were as frequent and as declamatory as ever, and read as well : but there is a degree of doubt and apprehension inseparable from real love, which tremble« for ever in the heart—a woman's heart especially, tor hers is ever the more genuine passion. I was dissatisfied with Elmington's ex¬ pressions, yet I knew not how he could have altered them, and I began to think his absence unnecessarily prolonged. To pass overall the painful incidents of that period, let me Say at once, that after se¬ ven weeks of suspense and wretchedness, η hich it is even now torture to remem- K 3 ber,
ber, iny father himself went to town, and found, after some trouble, that El- inington had been married a fortnights to a woman with a fortune infinitely su¬ perior to inine, and was then, with his bride, on α voyage to the Madeiras, for the recovery of her health. She had de¬ clared herself in a deep consumption when he married her, brought on, as he was made to believe, by love for him. He believed this tale at the time, and felt it some excuse for his conduct to me ; hut circumstances afterwards proved tliat he was only a convenient tool, selected by this artful woman to revenge herself on a faithless lover. She, like me, bad been deserted, and she believed that to murry another, would at once prove her own indifference, and wound the va¬ nity of her deceiver. * I cannot dwell upon the feelings which followed this dreadful blow. They were doubly embittered by the convic¬ tion that Elmington was cruelly deceiv¬ ed
ed in every respect relative to the charac¬ ter of the woman he had marned, and his dream of happiness must necessarily be trinsient So entirely I loved him, that, miserable as I was at his defalcation, I could have extracted some degree of comfort in believing he was happy, but the accounts my father brought of her levity, her temper, her total want of good principle, forbade the indulgence of such a hope, and I grieved at once for lum and myself Much as my parents wish¬ ed me to marry, they w ere too indulgent to harrassme· on. the subject, and my heart could never form another attach¬ ment sufficiently strong to induce me to change my name " The death of my mother, indeed, soon after my unhappy disappointment, threw lnyfathersoentirelyonmycaresfor all bis domestic comforts, tbat he soon be¬ came reconciled toa determination which secured them to lum for ever As to Mr Elmington, he received a punishment к i for
lor his conduct to me from the vcrj poi¬ son who seduced him to error, and a far more dreadful one than I ever lor a mo inent wished hım After two or three years of quarrelling and misery, Ins un¬ principled wife accidentally met with bei fiist perfidious lover, and the conse¬ quences were such as might be expected Irom a woman hke her She eloped « ith him, and a duel and dıvoıcc fol¬ low ed The guilty pau were mamed,. » Inch was itself a future punishment to each as tient, perhaps, as either deserv¬ ed Of tlıeır fate, whether they now hv e, or where, I know nothing, and my only hope is never to see or hear of hei agam " It was more than a year alter this affair had lived its day and been foigot- ten, except by the actual sufferers from it, that I was roused from the usual state of melancholy quietude into which I had gradually sunk, by a letter, the wuting of whicli was indelibly impres¬ sed, oa my remembrance It was from I'Jmington,

Althea met witli a very kind reception tirom Mrs. Penelope Mitralen, and at least a civil one from Mrs. Bridget, which was as much as she ever accorded to any one. The difference of both, however, as well as their situation, from that of Mrs. Charlton, was very striking, und Althea felt already as if she should be glad when her penance was perform¬ ed. The house was small, inconvenient, and shabby, with all the disadvantages of a house near town, without a man¬ servant, and none of its pleasures ; fbr of all tbe attributes of a public road— such as gaiety, bustle, and an ever- changing
dunging scene, the mansion got only the dust occasioned by this change, which blew m clouds ov er the wall which sepa¬ rated the road, from the dingy little gar¬ den, which it spoiled Nothing could. bc less enhv enmg than tins garden, into which tbe only sitting-room looked Altliea, indeed, from her chamber win¬ dow could see tlie tops of the carriages, and the outside passengers on а stagc- poich, but foi tint she had no great taste, though Mrs Marsden (Mis Bndget, the * Idei ) frequently expressed her adinua- tion of the look-out fiom th it и indow I he ladies vrere not very inspinng—the с its themselves looked grave and senten¬ tious—tlie parrot never spoke a word, and the only hvely thing in the house was an old spaniel, who was starved into activity, incessantly jumping up in hopes of victuals, if any one entered the room Mrs Charlton was aware of the narrow ness of these ladies' income, and Althéa's carnage was amply supplied with such deheacies
delicacies as she knew they could not procure, and did not dislike This at¬ tention, and Miss Voi non s quiet, pleas¬ ing manners together with her being " an excellent luiencr, gave her great inent with bei ancient hostesses, and finding lier sojourn there inev itable, she calmly resigned hcrsclt to cndeavoui nig to please them if possible Mi Mai selen, the fathei of these lathes, bad held a small place undei govein¬ ment, and this income, added to his ow n little fortune, bad enabled him to livo with comfort and decency, and bnng up a large fauni} respectably His fathei bad formerly been stew ard to Mi Chai 1- ton, and thus the MissMaisdens, when at their parents death the emoluments of office ceased, and pecuniai) embai rass- mcnls succeeded, became the immediate iare of the Chailton family Of many children, four only survived, tw о daugh¬ ters, married to little tiadesmen, and w ulcly dispersed, and tbe two now in¬ ti oduced,

With such a pair, Althéa's days wcie not the most agreeably spent, particu¬ larly as in their continual disputes they each appealed to her as an umpire, and. she was certain she must offend one if she gave a decision, and both if she with¬ held it To the rest of Mrs Bridget's recommendations, may be added a strong bias towards methodism, which influen¬ ced her very considerably in her choice of acquaintance With many of these peculiarities Mrs Charlton vias wholly unacquainted, for she saw them only oc¬ casionally, and then of course they were completely on ťieir guard, and kept all the overflowings of bile and anger to themselves till she had departed She knew they were thoioughly respectable. and believed them to be not unpleasant Had she known them exactly, Altlıca would not have lieen their guest 'lhe first evening of Miss Vernon s introduction at Kensington was given to a walk, in whicli they were joined bv severii
several of Mrs. Marsden's friends,, and Althéa only hoped they should not meet any of hers. The following day at breakfast, Mrs. Marsden proposed to her sister to invite a party for the evening—" I think Miss Vernon wul 'find it so dull here," said she. Altliea assured her she was by no means fond of company, and should be much happier alone. '' That is your politeness, my dear," leulied Mrs. Penelope, " but it is natural· at your age to like amusement ; I did myself. Who shall wc ask ?" " Why I think the Morleys, andigood Mr. Norris." " Mr. Norris I Lord, sister ! you must recollect if he comes we can only have a serious evening, and that would be very stupid for Miss Vemon. I want a pleasant, cheerful party."

" Yes, certainly, why not ? I hope 'tis all true ?" " Altliea, don't answer him ; let him buist in ignorance," said Mrs Pluhpson, " and tell me all about it by ourselves." "Ah, do, Altliea," returned he, "and then 1 shall hear it all again, and spare your blushes." " What I have to tell I have no ob¬ jection to say in general assembly.

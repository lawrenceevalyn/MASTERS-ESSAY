Drefden was the capital to which 1 was moft defirous of conducting him. Mauvice, duke of Saxony, who held his court there, and who was now only twenty-three years of age, was incomparably the moft at- compliihed prince of the empire. De¬ firous as I was that my only fon Ihould fill a diftinguifhed caveer, I thought I could not better prepare him fov the theatre of his native country, than by
thus initiating hun bef rehand m feenes of diftmflion and greatnefs He was delighted with his touv YV e had not proceeded nianv leagues from Conftance, befovc, indulging the bent of my mmd, I laid afide the hum bleiicfs of ouv appo ivance, and the ób¬ leme fiyle in vvhich wo travelled, and having procured a numerous cavalcade ot hoifes and few ants, I fet fovvvavd with confidevible magnificence YVe paffed through Ylunieh, Ratiibon and Pngue At Munich we found the court of the elcflov Ρ datine , the diet of the empire was fitting at Ratiibon, when we avnved at that city Chavles had been almoft entirely α dvangev to every thing princely and magnificent from the time he was tune yeavs of age , and he was now exaflly at that peviod of 4 human lift, when extevnal appeav¬ ances aie apt to m ike the dronged un II a predion

by fome extrinfic circumftance, Hiat you may not miftake them for a merchant's clevk or a city-magiftvate. The fenti¬ ment that he bveathcd as it were in- flinflively, as we retuvned from the firft time of our feeing duke Mauvice, was, At twenty-three years of age may I, in appearance,accomplifhmentsand fpirit, rofemble this man ' Here I was defivous of making a longev day than at the cities through which we had previoufly paffed, and of procuving fov my fon fome pevfonal in- tevcotivfe with this great ornament of thei age I judged this to be the move eafy, as, in our firft vifit to the palace, I had perceived forne Fvench noblemen of the ľvoteflant pevfuafion, who had refovted to the duke's court in feavch of employ¬ ment They appeared not to know me, but that was little to be wondered at, confidering that I had been feven years abfent
abfent from my country, and that the calamities by which I had been over¬ taken more than once during that pc nod, might be fuppofed to have pro¬ duced a greater effefl upon me than the mere lapfe of years would haver done Among the iell I remarked Gafpar de Cohgny, who was only twenty-one years of age it the time I quitted France, and had then been re¬ marked as one of the moft promifing young men his country had to boaft. His (lay here was expected to be fliort, his hopes in his own country, ftom the greatnefs of his conneflions, were of the higheft clafs, and he had only come to Drefden at the earned invitation of duke Maurice, who entertained an ar¬ dent affeflion for him My heart led me towards him, policy concurred ш diflaling the application, tm, if I were fortunate enough to gam his favour, my fon could not have a fnend bettei qualified,

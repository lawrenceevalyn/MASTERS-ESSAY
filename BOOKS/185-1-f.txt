The expanding verdure of spring, the gradual burst of vegetation, the softened landscape mellowed bv the sun's rich burnish, the pastoral village, the towering forest, the couchant valley, all—all were alike unheeded ; for sorrow, like
like a sordid mber, exclude* exuberant fancy, sorrow hugs its own hoards, sor* row treasures its world of cares. The mind surcharged, the eye wanders, as in apathy, о 'er creai ioiťs checkered beauties; no object can fix it, no lure beguile the seeming trance; It saps the faculties, If benumbs the heart, İt degenerates the boast of philanthropy, it compresses all in self. But while the labouring sigh de¬ noted the full-fraught tide οΐ maternal, οΐ sisterly interest, the marquis was lost in an illusion of his own creation : ¡t was not the turmoils of war, it was the towering strides of ambition which filled his copious mind—ambition, that foe to domestic comfort, that deadly bane to peace, that igtiù faium which leads man from astraigli? л îhornless frack, to plunge him midst the loud, the foaming ocean of diOficulties, cares, and perils. The marquis gazed upon the lovely features of his daughter; his eyes sparkled, his в i heart
heart dilated with exulting joy ; that daughter, so fair, so faultless, so obedient, so submissive to hts will ; and as he re- caHed his politic design in hastening her from Paris, a mintie of triumph passed o'er ris features. The matvhioness started, she looked with doubtful in· quirv ; that юок met a frown, and a r \'tin she wooed the banquet of her ossn re* fleet iocs. Ί (tough born of an illustrious isce, the hope, the aim, the raging pas «sion of the marquis, was fame and worldly exaltation: he sou/md Ow softer feel· ings of the bean, he ridiculed the* growth of sentiment; love was an illusion, friend¬ ship amenable to the sordid dictates of interest : hh own youth, his own pur¬ suits hid own, d no other model: he had sacrificed the early «low of voiuhfnl enîhralment, he lind puthrned the secrets of the heart to mould them to his own peculiar pvpo^o, he had stolen the pledge wliicì. coniidence had entrusted, he had su n tressed

The lady Corb:nde pined not for the gaieties of Paris, pined not for the splen¬ dors of courtly state ; off, midst the gilded ball, had her heart shrunk from the delusions of worldly forms, of worldly professions, oft coveted the rude haunts of her infant years, oft revised the spor¬ tive gambols of unsophisticated nature, Reared in the lap of tenderness, catching the fond lesson of love from the lip of maternal solicitude, the first sixteen years of
o: her exigence hacı passed in Provence, íhe brst sivteen vears of her existence h.îil known ao alloy, save the stern exoi- /anans of father St. Pierre, and the ie· ¿trair Ps imposed by the casual visits of t h * iri remis. f " Whld as colt untamed/' she had raní« oled amidst the solitude, she had s< iped the sweets of retirement, she had ended the honey-dew of instruction, she had blessed the hand which unfolded know¬ ledge, slie bad reaped the precious har¬ ves, of contera; hovv then did her eves sparkle, how then did lier heart daar!, when she beheld that solitude opening to her view, when, after au absence of eiiiht long months, she beheld the broad Γ5 «t? л bold front of the chateau, towering as in triumph amidst the surrounding wilder¬ ness ! But for the restraining presence of the father she feared, her arms had been thrown around the neck of the mo¬ ther she loved ; but for the freezing frown of authority, her lips had pro¬ claimed
claimed the effervescing thrill of joy. She bent forward ; she grrzccl from the window of the carriage ; her eyes pur* sued the troubled waves of the Tlho?pe, until they pierced a distant cop°e frin¬ ging its borders, until they singled a grev stone turret contrasting the foliage: thon her countenance varied; then a siah heaved the lawn upon her bosom ; vo* lumes seemed registered on the p'^ge oí memory, and thought faded to sadness the late sportive smile of joy. Momentary was the gloom, momen¬ tary was the incursion of care. The carriage paused; the burst of welcome echoed through the hall, and everv tongue teemed with the language of congratula¬ tion, Corisande heeded not the stiff, cold bend of the marquis; ¡die saw him pass through the hall ; she saw the floor close alike upon him and the meagre form of father St. Pierre, and then with a playful bound, she sprang* upon the neck of her delighted attendant, u Dear,

Wrapped ίη fancy's fond delusione, tranced in the ever-burnished visions of 'irst enthusiasm, Corisande perceived not the entrance of the marchioness—nay, -Tie started at the summons to the sup¬ per-board, as though her path too had been crossed by the boat-house spec¬ tre, and shrunk abashed from soaeiious inquiry, dreading to meet the penetra¬ ting glance of maternal interest. The meal was short and silent; the evening benison quaintly administered by father St. Pierre; for fatigue, chasing the bland jest and sportive smile, pre- seated a ready plea for wooing the pil¬ low's solitude; and whilst Corisande, dropping the airy loom of imagination, exchanges the wakeful dream for tin fairy-spell and floating imagery of Mor¬ pheus, be it the province of the historian to dive midst the tender folds of a young heart's enthralment.

Кием the ectidic' t dawn of infancy, it must be remembe. ed, the lady Corisande had been as a gem in the mine, buried, ob¬ jured from the comnion eve οΐ obser- ·* îiion, lost to the softening polish of so c 3 phisticatcd
phistîcated courtesy. Her intercourse with men had never extended bevond the household of the chateau—her scarce- to-be-nordnate<l experience gleaned from the exordiums of a frigid and dog* matic confessor; how then could the mind be curbed, 1 w ι evened from the dangerous, the exuberant flights of ro¬ mantic sentiment ? Пег heart knew no guile; she was a stranger to suspicion, beer use artifice had never blistered her path with its poisonous and corrosive mildew : she dived not bevond the Mia!- low surface of appearance; judging Irom heroin innate candour, the suneptitioir coverings of design were unguessed af, the every-day maxims of society им- кг.О'лП, From the earliest dawn of infancy, the \hn of gratitude had registet ed t'. e fond lestons of maternal instruction; in the gradual expansion of maturity, love and nature had perpetuated the germ : she reverenced the precepts of the mar¬ chioness;
chioness ; but lhe marquis, as í have be¬ fore observed, chilled the first dawning** of bland affection bv the harsh frown of supcrioritv. The first fifteen years of cxis.cnce were parsed in Provence. Co¬ risande knew not a world beyond her native mountains. Sportive as the light fawn, or agile squirrel, when liberated from the temporary confinement of in¬ struction, when escaping the crude les¬ sons of her spiritual director, often would she, alone, unattended,, wander amidst the deepest interstices of the surrounding scenery, would she mount the rocky pass, or seek health on the flowery banks of the roiling Rhone; οΐΐνη would her youthful fancy glow with phantoms of its own creation : often would she pic¬ ture beings like her brother, and then s»gh to pass the narrow limits which closed her from an illusive world. From the massive shelves of the li¬ brary, she had culled the exploits of t η ι ragen the rewards of faith ; she had с 4 lingered
lingered o'er the legendary lore of love ; she had read in the teeming page of many an ancient romance, of captive dames, and valorous knights: how then could the ardent mind of innate enthu¬ siasm gaze on the sylvan scenes around, how exist amid nature's glowing nursery of love and sentiment, without inhaling the dangerous stealing poison ? Corisande was pliant as the flexile üsier«*r^|« unskilled in the practices of the world, was unaided by experience; for the gibt which scarce ruffles the pa¬ rení oak, bends the sapling as in mock¬ ery. Etc \et she had numbered her six¬ teenth suiiinuiv ere \et hcv mind, as a blank page, received the impress of cha¬ racter, in the absence of her father, in the absence of her brother, wooing the cooling breeze of evening, Corisande wandered beyond the sloping pleasure- grounds of the t bateau, nor did the ridge of rocks, towering abo\e its turrets, act ss a beacon of return. The sun was sinking
knkhig ш the west ; its golden beam-, .efk-crini: on narme s emerald gaib a bril¬ liant kparc, softened the haun feature* ofe it h «i wt outkne.

Corrapde started. The blast was re- fc «rteai ; . \\v\ it swelled, and agam it 4 j eked
died away, lhe lonnds v\ere novel ; cv,- riosity beckoned onwards; unmindiul of impropriety, she sprung up the shelving path, and soon attained the summit. Al¬ ın ost bre-atkdess, her с lice Ir íl pr h ed and her ' ír По«! ting πι the bref/ e, she Mood upon a conned peak, with ber bon¬ net on her arm, looking as though the svlvan goddes-i of the waste. But tliough her eves sought m everv direction the new source of attraction, they rested but on inanimate nature ; no human being dotted the verdant surface of the mountain, no sound broke upon the monotonous roar of the distant cataract» Corisande marked the long level line of glory which the last beam oí the sua reflected ; she saw it drop beneath the horizon; she traced the stealing shade of dusky grey, and bieathing a half sigh of doubtful birth, began descending the steep. Suddenly a voice arrested her footsteps—suddenly a form obstructed her path, It was immediately at the base of ân

Here cnltr uaon chained the ad inning eye; here ihe clustering vine, and smiling ^ о olive*-
olive-grourd, the aîmend pale, the ьрга««.рц mu b prr у, the blossoming eta¬ per, bore wití cts to rhe diligence of toil; and there triumphant Nature, in her wild¬ est garb of water, rocks, and forests, snatched the t.ibute claimed by m;in. Coi isande bstened—Corisande was an enthusiast ; she hung upon the giant out¬ line ; she noted the dotting thickets of oliancler halfway climbing up the steep ; fehe too traced *■-" beautv sleeping in the lap of honor;" she too offered the heart¬ felt meed of praise. Remember, ye strict observers of etiquette, С msande knew not the imperative calls for introduction ; she had never graced tlie splendid ball¬ room, had never mingled in the gaudy show ; a novice in men and manners, the customs of the world were unguessed at, the iron laws of precision unknown: con¬ demn not then the imprudence of an in¬ experienced girl, nor tax modesty through the transient lapse of decorum, Corisande had reached the boat-house ere
ïïo ;he bid adieu to the stranger, and a« she fled towards the chateau, ere she gained the entra tice ¿»be paused- -perha; s ίο recover breath ; she turned—perhaps involuntarily— perhaps to trace *hc moonbeams dancing on the trouble ! surface of the rive,·— -perhaps—but 'tis hard to soh e the moľ/ves of volatile vouth. Corisande did turn, and did be¬ hold the graceful figure of the stranger, stationed on the verge of the cypress- grove» as though to watch her footsteps. A smile pla v etl on her features, a sen¬ sation of joy thi 'died at her heart; it vas the fir-»t time she had been watched a\cby the parent eve, and novel was the cast of her feelings. Again she fied, nor again did she pause until she had reached her own chamber ; then she took her station at the casement, and then she diligently watched the checkered sha¬ dows as they danced upon the lawn be¬ neath. But no human being crossed the path, no ideal hero stole upon the soli¬ tude ;
tude; the hoarse roar of the Rhone v.¿s unbroken, the shrill clarion of the hotn sounded but upon tnemorv. f * Mercy aid us!" exclaimed Michel¬ ine, long' îr.arking the patience with which Corisande preserved her station, " what charm can го$чЬЬ cha. n von, dear Κι Л y , to the window ? Nothing is to bc seen without but the moonbeams, notlvng heard but the murmur of the cataract/' " No, nothing, nothing but dre arv so¬ litude," faintly aitHuia.ed Continue, and then sheslaited, for aí tiiat instant a fifiute emerged f r om the . ! ^e ^пеЬые 1 - ing shrubbery, and took ι he path i «ime¬ diatei ν winding towards the chare ju. «r Cj i% lt must be a robber, * w hi spe re d Micheline, peering over the shoulder of her ) ou ι h fu I mistress. 4Í A robber !" echoed Corisande. *' What еье ?" pursued Micheline, at¬ tentively watching the slow progress of the stranger. u See how he looks to- wards tbe chateau Ί There, bow he stops
—í warrant he comes to reconnoitre, and it midnight, the saints and martyrs guard us î heading a whole host------ >" i{ Mel hinks/' interrupted Corisande, *' he looks more like a hero than a rob¬ ber." (i What, ii/disguise ?" questioned Mi¬ cheline. <c Heaven knows !" sighed Corisande, and then she scarcely dared to breathe, for the stranger paused immediately be¬ neath the casement. hC lïy St Mark/' whispered Mk holine, " if tae laîp;aak cf the mountains be as comeî v. our hearts must go wkh the booty { " Corisande smiled ; her heart already felt to acquiesce, for slie recognized the bunter she had met in her ramble. The , plume waved o'er his high forehead, and the bugle was still sdung across his shoulder. u What can he seek herek' pursued Micheline, '♦ bas arms folded, a,id his look
look so thoughtful ? í have heard love makes people melancholy; but then it must be hopeless love, and who can look in his face, and picture his love hope¬ less?" tf True/ murmured Corisande; fi ami yet, Micheline/' breathing a heavy sigh. r ' the world, father St. Pierre says, teems with strange capricious beings." u None more capricious than himself/' eagerly rejoined Micheline. ( · Why, lady, he makes no more allowance ior love than 1 should for falsehood. Ile sav s that iove is*----- ~- J ' (< Hush !" interrupted Corisande, for the stranger, as though awakening f.om abstraction, slowly pursued his patín "Who can he be?" exclaimed Mi¬ cheline; "such a noble form! such a dignified countenance í By St. Miry, if father St. Pierre were but to glance upon his shadow, we should have exordiums without endy and penitentiaries without mercy í we should be caged within these walks
wallsasthough the citadel was assai led, and the besieged in danger of surrender. 1 wonder what mighty harm could come of a parley ! What though I follow the stranger knight, and question him as to the import of his mission ?" ff Not for the universe/' said Cori¬ sande; ' f no doubt his mission is the sport of accident, and his knight-errantry the pursuit of the chase." Micheline shook her head in incredu¬ lity, and a summons to the supper-board checked any further discomse. Corisande arose, she bent her knee f о the buicdicitc of her confessor, she visited her oratory, she prayed for her parents, for her brother, and then she sought the peaceful calm of her pillow ; but not, as heretofore, did her thoughts sink to rest— not, as heretofore, did sleep close upon the active flights of youth. Fancy re¬ traced the mou n tain -hun ter, fancy re» called every panegyric he had uttered ; new beauties glowed in the prospect ot hev
her natal haunts; and when Morpheus strewed her downy cnurh with ρ ppies, the same figure rose to \iew, the same fearuies tinged imagination—the same figure, but not elad in the same habili¬ ments, for the garb of peace was re¬ signed, and the close casque and iron gyves of war bespoke the hero—the same features, but not glowing with the same placidity; courage sat upon the brow, defiance marked the outline. The din of arms succeeded, the clarion blast of battle sounded, and sword encountered sword. Rived by a thousand fears, Corisande marked the onset ; new interests fanned her hopes, new «sensations fluttered at her heart ; she saw the stream of life fast flowing, she heard the groan of parting nature, and yet she shrunk not; her eyes rested on the glowing features of the stranger, and her lips murmured prayers for his prosperity. Suddenly the laurel¬ led wreath of victory encircled his brows ; suddenly
suddenly loud shouts echoed through the vault of heaven: homage bent the knee before him ; Fame strewed the rose of triumph. She too would have approach¬ ed, 'be too would have joined the gra¬ tulation, had noi a chasm opened wide between them, had not a spectre image cried, ** Forbear !" Corisande's feet tottered on the shelv¬ ing steep, she shrieked, for an arm of Herculean strength pressed onward; she turned—she beheld her father * his frown was terrific—his vengeance sute. In \a¡n she stretched her arms towards the stranger ; the ab>ss intervened, she poised upon its terrifying he'ght, and yet parental rigour relaxed not. ín vain she tlunr to overhanging twigs: tn vain she srpphcMed mercy: the thrust, the sh-iek, de nart, were as one ; the illusions of vision ν ere dissolved, the fetters of sleep broken. Fraught w uh the ď Uy phantoms of imagination, Corrande started ftom bet pddw #
pillos ; her eyes sought the abyss, sought the stranger, and though the saffron beams of morning pierced within her chamber, it was long ere reality tri¬ umphed over fiction—nay, even then a father's frown of denouncement was re¬ called with dread, with shuddering horror» Unable again to woo the balmy trance of forgetfulness, she forsook her couch, and with a heart still heavy, and a frame im- refreshed, bowed to her morning's devo¬ tions, in vain she turned over the leaves of her missal, in vain she sought amuse* ment at her loom; the colours were too vivid, her eyes were dazzled by their glare, and even fancy ached at the crowd of images. The tapestry was rejected, and the library ransacked for some ro¬ mantic legend, some tale of love and venturous enterprize. But what were the exploits, what the magic ihrallsoi ancient story, what the enchanted speiis of witchery, what the syren charms of cap¬ tive beauty ? scarce could they sap the
tbe fancy, how then could they reach the heart ? Corisande was all heart, and the page of noetic fiction was renounced. Her lute too shared the same fate ; the sounds were discordant; scarce had she tuned it to the matin hymn, when the measure wild was broken, and fickle fan^y beck¬ oned to a new pursuit. She wrapped her cloak around her, she descended to the hall ; the servants were already risen ; unobserved., she stole from the chateau; the day was resplendent, the breeze fra¬ grant vvith its purloined stores of sweets. Quick from the burnished verdure did the «runbeam drink the sparkling dew- drop, quick did it exhale the humid va¬ pours, and dazzle with its brightness. The birds carolled in mid-air; the spor¬ tive fawn gambled o'er the pasture, crea¬ tion was arrayed in gladness, and every animated lay recorded praise, Cori- ^nde had no aim, vet she struck into 4 J ihe
the path which the stranger had pursued the preceding evening; jt led to the flower-dotted banks of the Rhone, and wound amidst the sombre gloom of the cypress-grove. Even at mid-day the sha¬ dow was profound, for the huge over* spreading branches mingled overhead f and the «Hinty turrets of the boat-house seemed as a base to rest on. Hoarse was the roar as the water broke beneath the archway, foaming the eddies which the obstruction produced; yet Co¬ risande ascended the stone-carved stairs, and gazed from the window which over¬ looked îhe flood. The apartment was small, but it was decorated by the sculp¬ tor's chissel ; grotesque vases ornamented the corners, and Parian busts occupied each narrow niche. Corisande threw herself upon the -ude bench ; she leant against the marble slab; she gazed upon the quickly-stealing cur¬ rent, from thence upon the mountain ridge,
ridge, which closed u uon the view. în the front spread a long line of diver¬ sified beauty, for vineyards and olive- grounds mingled in the blue ether of distance ; to the left giant steeps tower¬ ed to the horizon's limits, party-clad rocks of bituminous granite, beneath »whose cli ft sides, scowling midst the gloom like an eagle's nest, the husband¬ man pitched his little dwelling. Here the spiling smoke denoted a ha- man habitation ; and theie, fringing fan- taotic trags, the ptnpic clusteiing grape sprung as though the extorted effort of nature. Corisande s gaze wandered in wanton latitude; İt seemed to seek a iest- ing-place, }U knew not where. Coii- sande was mortal í Though she mourned no care, yet could she boast no pleasure: dissatisfaction marked the present hour, and sadness clouded the Calm which ought to have insured content? because hei life was uncheekered, her life was listless; because
because sameness steeped hei path, her path was valueless, Alas ! the past may produce a sigh, the future may teem wat h hope; but it seems as though the pre¬ sent alone excited inquietude. As she rose to quit the boat hoirc. fu, r y pointing to the mountain-path in w lach she had met the stranger, her eves fell upon the marble slab against which she had been leaning. InMantlv the moun¬ tain-path vani-hcd; instantly tlie hpnd borne huntsman superseded the lord point «r f attira íion, for the íaint o ithrrs of characters were discernible, and w ha* hand could trace those clnractcr , viva the hero of her last night's vdion ? Tí e deep flush of delight e)\ed her chee*, the quickening throb of experUaa / agitated her bosom: bhe bent over í ? e slab; she enget 1) sought ίο decipher the lines. The) wete the cxtcn pot\p ; cfir iion of srddened spirits—they v.ere r n apostrophe of the htait. ». v

Corisande read and re-read the stati - z.is; her whole feelings were inarms, every line thrilled upon her \oung h<n'*it > and heightened the glowing vermii of her í heek; nay, when »she returned to the chateau, it was bn't to snatch the ear/ pral of morning, to dispatch the qiiia»- iSCJ'jtud

Mìe heeded not the half-breathed shriek ofMichtline; she gazed from the case¬ ment—she beheld a boat gliding swiftly dow n the stream. The moonbeams played upon the erect figure of the boatman ; hi-i arms were folded, his face turned to» wards her, his eyes fixed upon the tur¬ ret-chamber. It was the hunter she had met upon the mountain-summit. The same garb of green enwrapped his grateful form—the same iight plume wa\ed over hisopen forehead ! Corisande quitted not her station until she had li.st sight of the stranger, until the wave had Lİosed over the track his boat had roade ; and even then it was with a sensa¬ ti 3 t "toii
non of regret, for ever aml anon did her eve seek the same direction.

Corisande, by no means a convert to the supertaious credence of her atten J- znt, rose to depart ; she even suppo-kd the tottering irame of Mit beline, anel fenced
forced many light pleasantries, ίο skorten ihe length of the distance. Nwt onte did sne banter her apprehensions; not once did she start a theme, from width, though consonant to her own heart, ti¬ midity fearfully shrunk ; vet Micheline could think of nought but the supposed speette, nor could all the subtilry of ar¬ gument, or the powers of reasoning, chase from lier mind the appalling con¬ tinuation. Thus the boat-house be¬ came a srene of terror, and its solitude unbroken, save by the undaunted Con¬ tunde. Week succeeded week, month rolled on month, but the spetti e, if spectre it was, no move visited the verdant grove* of the сЬаЧми- —no more did the shrill born e« ho midst the rocky cliffs—ne¬ mo: e ďd the labouring oar ruiïle the bhone's while bosom, Corisande droop¬ ed ; she knew not why, }ct sadne-·, .nvi discontent stole upon her qni-M ; л sîoinger to the new сры of her feeling, D i ;>h.ľ

Corisande listen¬ ed to tl e praises of her brother ; she enumerated his well-known virtues, she anticipated his rise to pre-eminence . br¬ co u rage was undaunted ; the m unifice tu e of his sovereign supreme. In the glo nous and ever-memorable battle oí ľon- taine-Françore, he had signalized his valour—he had shared in the perils oí his prince—he had heard the puissant Henry spurn every importunity to esc ipe —he had seen him, bareheaded, rush into

Alps f what a new field of regret did cher* lines spread before the intended removal to Paris ! it was evident the stranger had returned, had re-visited the boar-house, had lingered midst the soli¬ tude of the cypress-grove; perhaps in the eager hope of beholding the mlotre^s οΐ his poetic passion —perhaps to court the dangerous indulgence of ga/ing on the form which hadenwrapt his sense s Corı-uinde-, my fair readers, like ever, mother's daughter of ur ws alive to rhe pleading whrpeis of *c í love; cií) the ì * "J c.l u en i b.*
tell me, if regret at leaving Provence at tke very moment fate promised a solu¬ tion to the long-pending m>btcry, was unnatural ? Picture a being gifted, as was the mountain-hunter, with everv grace of external attraction, with every advantage of mental endowment, and then tell me, fair lady, if the radiance of your own blight eves, like Corisandcd would not have been dimmed with the tear of regret ? Tell me, if you too would not have conned by he»a î the eíľpaons of an unknown muse—if \ ou too would 4 not have quitted the boat hou^e with re¬ lut tance ? The grey eye of morning had scarcely pierced the eastern hemisphere, ss» а:ее had night's murky \aponij rolled before the rich tinta οΐ ъаШоп radiance, when the tiavelhng'Carriage halted л* dr d;a- teau gate. The nraq:a«s chivied the in¬ decorous cond« scension of iii5 daughter, as she wuhdre.v from the агаь oí the sobbing
sobbing Micheline ; the marchioness pressed her hand in ríe .ce; while Coii- sande embracing the ready nlea. went in the fullness of her heart. it wr. long ere the April cloud of ill-sup¬ pressed dejection yielded to the placid sunshine of content— eie she suflicienHy effaced the remembrance of the boat- house to admire the quit k-succeeding prospects, or fan the almost dormant ¿Lime οΐ anticipation —ere the busy throng of population—ere the novelty ¿nd customs of the world, extorted one smile or one observation. Corisande was a visionary, and Coruande, indulging m the rapture of thought, delved the mine of future perplexity. ín vain the sun burnished nature*·; rich and picturesque scenes; in \m· a cloud* less firmament shone upon their long and varied íicuk, C\i^ .* ч*е e. hoed the panegvnes of the тлп 'л'ьчкго, but ьЫ. the woods, the ..гди ( . /η , the i-xhs, the vulhtr, ν .ed n-t with »lu ν ;. ύ\ the > -»untaim*.,
mountains, the rocks, the vallies of her native province. In the brilliant circles of a gay metro* polis, the charms of the lovely novice fhone conspicuous; she was as the reti¬ ring lily amidst the gay parterre of beauty, for she coveted not the adula¬ tions of praise—-she shrunk from the ho¬ mage others wooed. Пег eyes sparkled not at the whisper.·*» οΐ the duke de Brian¬ çon ; her heart harboured not the Ьгез of mad ambition ; her cheek glowed not with the crimson flush of exultation ; she bowed with coy reserve to his com¬ pliments, and shrunk with chilling apathy from his proffered love, 4i How seldom/' said the marquis, at¬ tentively marking the features of his daughter, (C do we find a mind so gifted as de Bria η con's, so abundantly culti¬ vated, so nobly stored !" "Stored!" echoed Corisande, in ac¬ cents of surprise. '•That urbanity of manner," pursued the
«CUT*. tbc politic observer, ** which cLitu.s the heart captive, which steals upon the in¬ terest, which saps corfldence, which en¬ sures esteem. The noblest dames of the court contend for his notice, and happy is the bein» whom Heaven destines it* ih are his d igni ties/' Corisande spoke not, for her hcait joined not in the panegyric ; she had no¬ ticed the duke but asan oíbeious intruder for her favour, nor harboured one thought of envy towards the being so pi ized. í( It is sttange/' pursued monsieur de noussillon, his eves intently li\ed on the uovviiv features of his daughter, " that . pite οΐ the attractions of superior beauty and ¡superior grace, de Ľi Lincon should select a child, a novice, one whose -sim¬ plicity, whose total ignorance of the world-----'* lie paused; ,*e smiled; vet still no -elf-appreciation Unshed the fair cheek or »ts auditor: she was indeed a no\¡ee— St ,' 3
she was indeed ignorant of the woild " never had she, even iti imagination, sought ίο penetiate the intricate folds of the human heart; never had she guessed the sinister design which often lurks beneath the veil of pretended courtesy ; nor till the marquis continued, " De Briançon, long my friend, seeks at your hand a nearer alliance/* did «she suspect berseli the attraction which solved his frequent xisits at the hotel. Then she started, then her bosom swelled, and her cheeks glowed ; but not with the glow of plea¬ sure, not with the glow of gratified vanity ; it was amazement, it was regret, which spoke in every feature, which bent her eves on the ground, which chased even expression but r»dness. The smile vanished; a frown, stern and unbending, contneted the brow of the marquis. '- W h it am I to think ?" he exclaimed ; "Corkaide, beware, nor daie to fos¬ ter sentiments mimdal to a father's ·/ l '-ď lie
ïîe rose—he quitted the apartment. Corisande followed—-she tied down the gallery—she sought the solitude of her own dressing-room, and there unnoticed indulged her tears, Scenes of per¬ plexity and sorrow crowded on the fu¬ ture; she had perused the pages of ro¬ mance, till every sentiment had become tinctured, till her whole mind teemed with the witcherv of love and ei.thn- siasm ; how then could she accepta lover like the duke? how folget the m* stcrv c^ lhe boat-house ? how efface the maulx t ргкч fuj form of the mounîaîndntnter ? Corisande sought not to eiface it; alas! she wooed the pleasing phantom, wooed it till the impression mingled with her being, wrocd it t/1 it nightly filled the visions of ."dumber, and fa-med e verv an¬ ticipation of future bír. \n ú с cir¬ cles of grdefy she hciv.me thoughtful, to tbe light fantastic dance -indifferent; cold reserve iced her manner, crude ie- ; b 4 <"t ; on bleached her cheeks, •Gradually
Gradually were the fears of the mat** chioness excited ; gradually were the suspicions of the marquis realized: the one trembled for the health of a beloved child, the other dreaded lest love, a tiaitar to authority, should dare to brave his power, should dare subvert his plans. Yet spite of the most diligent scrutiny, he could stsbstantiate no charge, he could single no being whose approach flushed with nameless rapture, whose absence chased the fire of fond expectation. ' f «Strange !" thought monsieur de Jîoiïssillon, and then the menace of com¬ mand would momentarily rise as an ex¬ pedient; but policy, quelling the gust of passion, ever softened the expression of his features* The marquis was a courtier; he knew how to mould each action io his secret purpose : even the minds of men he had fathomed ; how then could a guileless girl baffle his discernment ? how subvert the deep-laid schemes of his ambition ? how brave the long-en~ ƒ of ced
forced rule of his authority ?

brave the bleak breeze upon the law«· The handsome form of the count de Vaudrecourt recurring to memory, as she pursued the path winding to the cy¬ press-grove, seemed to offer a solution to the enigma: she remembered his atten- tions, she recalled hts youthful attrac¬ tions, she sought to decipher some blush¬ ing proof of enîhralment ; and then she shuddered, for the denouncement of the marquis sounded as a death-peal in her ears. " Heaven defend my child!" she as¬ pirated, pausing immediately at the base of the boat-house. The wind baffling the current increased the sullen roar, for the swollen waves breaking against the hutments of the archwry receded white a*i the ocean's foam. " Why should I seek her here r" sighed the marchioness, turning from a spot so desolate. " The saints forbid her mind should be so jaun¬ diced, for here may melancholy be wooed even to insanity !" Re treating
Retreating from the damp cold gloom of the cypress-grove, she gazed anx¬ iously around, her feelings upon the rack, her spirits drooping beneath the pressure of suspense ; for few are the possible evils of life which suspense does not magnifv. Fuddenlv a hectic tint flushed her cheekj a ray of pleasure sparkled in her eye, for she traced the form of Corisande toiling up th*» steep, which towering almost to the horizon s limits, screened the chateau from the northern blast. " it is exercise, not moody care, she ' 4 seeks," thought the delighted mother, as she hastened to gain th^ mountain-path. The ascent was steep, yet the mar¬ chioness persevered ; often she paused, to recover breath ; and then, smiling at the elastic spring of youth, recalled the days of past activity ; that recai awaken¬ ed sadness, and that sadness was scarcely effaced, when Corisande, turning to view f :j tha
the couchant valley, hailed the approach of her mother. " Whither are you journeying ? 4> asked the marchioness, with an effort at gaiety she could but ill assume. f ' Is ; ours a self awarded pilgrimage? or has falber St. Pierre—-" " No, my mother/' interrupted Con sande, íf mine is no pilgrimage; mine/ 4 deeply blushing, c ' is a self-awarded gra¬ tification/' " Yet why should gratification point to solitude ? " asked the marchioness: " whv should it exclude the converse of social intercourse ?" Corisande's eyes were raised with an expression which seemed to say, f( Who here can î select as a companion ?" "Father St. Pierre is light/* thought the marchioness; " alas ! the pernicious visit to Paris has tinctured the life of my poor girl with sadness. Tell me/' she continued, as, aided by the arm of her daughter,
datighíer, they descended the mountain, " if transported once more to the great world, if again in the zenith of fashion, the name of that being whose society j ou would crave ?" Corisande paused, as though to recai the «iddy thron 'js who flutter in the sun- ¡T) J d beams of prosperous fortune, and then with an arch smile replied, " Not one; no, not one from all the crowds of Paris would î select to share my rambles/* 4i Not one !" repeated madame de Rous- sillon, incredulously. ft in truth, not one," pursued Cori¬ sande. " it is not the rhapsody οΐ un¬ meaning professions, it is unvarnished sincerity, it is the stability of friendship, my heart would crave." " The count de Vaudrecourt," mur¬ mured the marchioness " Wou'd die with ennui/' firmi ν re- plied Corisande, ťŕ in such an exile.

Con* sande seemed tranced in thought; hci íhecks glowed with vivid ctnnson; her eves beamed unusual radiance; hi vain the marchioness strove ίο so! v e their e\ort ssjon—-she spoke not, .she [aired not midst the scenes of iond ie шс ,n b ran c e —
sigh of her mother, yet even then she unfolded not the hidden hoard of ima» gined sorrow. The boat-house was soon lost to view, and the quick approach of Micheline augured some new occur- rence. " An express—a letter!" said Miche¬ line, almost breathless with ex pedi tion- ** For whom?" demanded the mar¬ chioness. " For my lord marquis/' replied the panting girl. ** One huge packet from Paris, and one from thearmv.'* " From Mortaigne !" exclaimed ma damede Roussillon, hurrying forwards. Corisande shadowed her footsteps, ver . when they reached the chateau, the mar¬ quis had retired with the important pack* ets to his library» " How 1 pine to hear of my brother !' said Corisande* " How 1 tremble for the safety of my «on 1" faltered the marchioness; yet she vb voulu
could not« and Corisande dare not in¬ trude upon the retirement of the mar¬ quis. Hi-, reign was coercive ; authority, not conciliation, his maxim. A whole hour, leadened bv the tardi- ness of suspense, wore away ; another bad nearly succeeded, when father St é Pierre was summoned to the library con¬ ference. " «Saints of mercv !" faltered the mar- 4Г chioness, " some dire event has hap¬ pened—some fatal accident has heîdilin mv beloved son.

hastened through the galleries; yet when she came within sight of the library, she pause! in trepidation. She started, for she beheld Michelinen with flushed cheeks, and guilt's swift motions, retreat from the door. She would .have pursued, but she lemembered the racked feelings of her mother, and with renovated courage, she knocked gen/y at the door, it wa*; opened by the marquis. She did not tremble, for his look foreboded neither sorrow or anger; the smile of exultation plav e d upon his features, and he listened to hv ι request with complacence; nay, a.: lie gave her the letter of the count de Moitdigne, he called him a hero, and patting her cheek with plavful ailectton., bid ner emulate bus heroi>m.

It f в w a··
was written in the wann ardour of health, in the enthusiasm of valour, in the bright anticipation of sanguine spirits. The count spoke of the movements of the army, of the heroism which pervaded every rank; he glowed with the enger zest of a soldier, he represented all alike as panting for the moment oí action, as grasping already, in imagination, the blood-steeped wreaths of victory. Yet when he reverted to the past, when he recalled the ensanguined plain, and touched on the scenes of obstinate con¬ tention, the feelings of maternal. o»f sis- tt rìv interest were studied; he softened the threatened per iî, he lightened the throes of sufferance; the agony of his w on nil wa« unthojght of, but the action of D !

But though relieved from present despair, still a thousand fears crowded on the mind of the anxious mother—a thousand doubts, which required imne ihnn common fortitude to b**iïle, 'lhe rashness of /ea! was admitted ; ahr î th ;t rashness might not always be tempeied by adventurous fuendship.

Consande trembled at the agitation of her mother; she read the outline οΐ her sorrows, yet she feared to question, for her ciimsoned cheek was turned even kom the scrutiny of her child. Her tears flowed, her arms were closely folded round her neck, Alas! she had often mourned, liad often shuddered at the barren picture of domestic peace; she had traced the dissimilarity of disposition, the strides of tyranny opposed to the week endurance of gentleness, till her heart shrunk at the contemplation—fill, but for the close ties of nature and of dur\, her lips had almost reprobated the unbending sternness of the marquis.

Strange V' thought Cori¬ sande, as she vainly wooed the repose of her pillow, f ' that a being to whose name I am stranger, should poison the peace of my life—should mingle in every rhoiiffht—should intervene between me and my duties. Ah, my mother! how is It that my weak, my foolish heart, so ob¬ stinately combata against my judgment ? how
Hiow is it, that cherishing a shade, an il¬ lusion, it tempts me to rebel even against the still, deep voice of con* science?" Corisande sobbed ; Corisande's pillow was steeped i n tears; she recalled the scene of the morning—she shuddered at the hid¬ den sorrows of her mother—she tried to guess the secret spring of woe, to dive be« nea t h the veil of fancied ills; but her cheek turned pale, her blood curdled at the faithful record of memory, at the thou¬ sand, thousand proofs of meek endurance, of opposing rigour. Ci Dear, de?r parent !" she murmured, <e is it for me to pang thy bosom ? is it for me to blight the little peace thy des¬ tiny has left thee ¡' is it for me to pour my fancied sorrows in a heart so deeply laden ?

—bbe feared to infringe the menîai pro¬ mise of foibearance— she feared lest the grey turrets of the boat-house, peering through the dark bosom of îhe c ν pre;*- grove, «should mock the sway oí lane led resolution. Corisande chose the way io conquest, for Corisande shrunk from the test of temptation ; a mother's peace was the deposit, duty, humanity the spur. Siiengthened by the pious office of de¬ votton, she descended from her oratory, a'-d was bending over her loom, when /Jr., c/ne, unii a -jnile írauphí with 'iCu.inL:, c\«Jam.ed, ( Ak.ck ! how iu'i you v% ^te vom rme, and wtrry чип eves iq cm such »cirtless images : ^i'other of Cod' with sirh a pros- yvit ш\ net die would i un counter, and tlače naught but -«iinK shows and /iaz/ling c qnquge«/' i( Sir h a pro-pec f ■ What me:, n \ou, Micheline r' demanded ine astoni lied Corisande. ŕ ' Oh

Besides ----- —** Corisande started—the needle dropped from her nerveless fingers—the blood forsook her cheeks; cold and motionless as marble, she clung to the supporting frame, her powers suspended, and her eyes wildly fixed upon the terrified atten¬ dant, u What have ï done ? what have 1 caid?" shrieked Micheline, ** Blessed martyrs !

ber, and quick as the lightning's flash, was that daughter in her arms; vet it was long ere they could reanimate the breathing statue, ere they could restore the warmth of circulation, ere they could recai the powers of action. Corisande was lost in the stupor of as¬ tonishment ; she saw their solicitude, sl.e heard the frantic exclamations of hci mother, yet she could not speak, she could not breathe one sigh of consola¬ tion ; she remembered naught save the words of Michehne ; nor till a Hood of tears leiieved tier pent-up feelings, could ăhe force even the faint '„mile of acknow¬ ledgment.

" Tt was í, dear lady," faltered the •weeping Micheline, unmindful of the reprehension her confession must pro¬ duce. tc Heaven help me î I thought to delight my young mistress, and my news has terrified her almost to death/* * f What news?" demanded the mar¬ chioness. Micheline mused for a moment; her cheeks flushed crimson—her eyes sought the ground. " What news?" again urged the alarm¬ ed mother. Micheline supplicated pardon, and then, with palpable confusion, followed the acknowledgment, that passing down the gallery, long after the arrival of the important packet, the voices of the mar¬ epus and father St. Pierre in close de¬ bate, had arrested her footsteps. The marchioness frowned— f< And you presumed to steal upon the conference ?" she sternly observes; " yeto meanly pur¬ loined-------"
' ïn truth, my lady/' interrupted fhe trembling girl, <l í heard my lord mar¬ quis speak οΐ marriage, and—and——" Corisande gasped for breath. fi Another time," whispered the mar- chioness, motioning for her to quit the apartment. " Stay, stay/" implored Corisande, clinging as though for succour to her mother's bosom, ÍC stay, Micheline, aud let me know my fate !" "Your fate !" repeated the distressed girl ; " holy saints! how mournfully you talk ! If my lord marquis had doomed vou to a cloister, you could not have kjoked more sorrowful.' 1 i( Would to Heaven he had!" mur¬ mured Corisande. The marchioness shuddered. Micheline crossed her bosom— <: Jesu Mariai prefer a cloister to a husband! fasting, and tears, and prayers, and peni- тепсе, to the world, and the world's plea- -aires * '* i' - Micheline
Micheline was indeed an infidel; for if on earth the extremes of Elysium and Purgatory could be tasted., the one seemed to beckon to the cloudless porch of livmen, the other to scowl within that living tomb, a convent. How then could she resolve a die so incongruous—how reconcile this violation to nature, this outrage to probability ? " Explain/' said Corisande, impatient of delay ; (s be quick, and tell the secrets which curiosity purloined ?" Michelined cheeks »lowed with shame —she trembled at the evident displeasure of the marchioness—she knew not how to excuse, how to exculpate the seeming dereliction. f< Alas I м she faltered, bursting into a fresh flood of tears, éí I intended no harm, id has my officious zeal offended р:Ы forgiveness.

chioness, raising her clasped hands fo heaven, " avert this dreaded, this bitter trial ! Oh, poison not the years of my declining life, with the misery, the men¬ tal struggles of my child í" The appeal was to the heart ; reserve was no longer mercy. Corisande sunk on her knees before her mother, and in. an instant the boat-house secret was re¬ vealed. The verses written on the mar¬ ble tablet, the rencounter with tbe moun¬ tain-hunter—nay, her own thoughts, her own hopes were confessed; her breast was the seat of innocence, and why should it nocence shrink from the eye of friendly scrutiny ? But the marchioness listened in silence ; though she clasped the hand of her daughter, and tried to force the smile of encouragement, still were her whole f« elings in arms; still did fear, distrust, anguish, struggle for preeminence, Iix- perience pictured the wary impostor, and oft did prudence strive to chide the indiscreet latitude of thoughtless youth ; but
but ever and anon did affection urge the ready plea—did innocence, education, . nd total ignorance of the world, present a thousand palliatives. (t Alas ! my child," she said, endea* vouring to attain the mastery of feeling, *' how little—how very little do you guess the artifices of mankind ! how lit¬ tle do von dive beneath the shallow gui з of assumed sentiment !" 41 What artifice could exist? what disguise could be a-.su med ?" interrogated Corisande; ' f had you heard the stranger — had you traced the emanations of soul in his speaking countenance, you too, my mother, would have banished suspi¬ cion as injurious and unjust." Th.e marchioness breathed a heav ν sigh ; she knew not what to argue, oi how to subveit the dangerousentHusiasm of her daughter: she trembled for her peace, but η о ufo r hjr probity; she knew the trmh to which ¿ an unsophisticated с* й heart
heart is oft exposed ; she knew the ava¬ rice of the world, and well she knew the attractive charms which might tempt a young impostor to play the lover, A thousand new terrors crowded upon me¬ mory, a thousand new dangers to torture the coward-breast of maternal interest. Corisande, her beloved, confiding, trusting Corisande, seemed beset with snares, seemed the tottering victim to her own romantic credulity, and the mysterious visitor of the boat-house as the tempting demon to destruction. She shuddered, yet could she not effice the appalling picture, court she not banish the degrading possibility ; for human nature, she felt assured, in all ranks, in ail ages, is alike waylaid by the same remplacions, alike seduced by the same weaknesses. ä ' Promise me/' said the marchioness when reason moulded the incongruous fantasies of her brain into something like order,
order, ςζ never alone to visit the boat- house ; never, by disguise, taciîîv to admit the evident love of this stranger." * f Love !" echoed the artless Corisande, her everv feature radkiied with the bur¬ nish of delight — "love ! ah, my mother, if I thought so------" "What then ?" demanded the almost* breathless mother. " Why then/* resumed the unconsi ious girl, her cheeks flushing the \ivid tint of pleasure, "Ishould be too^ too happv !" " Mistaken child !" rejoined madame de Roussillon. ίζ Happy ! holy Heaven! what but misery, what but \vo^, can a thwarted, an inauspicious love produce ? v*hat are the exchanged vows of faith ? what the stolen interviews of affection, opposed by adverse destiny ? Alas ! should he love as never man loved, pride -would intervene, and a father's curse v/otiki mildew each gilded promise, would blast each dawning hope·" Corisande shuddered, g «3 "Remember/*

Kacii dav excited more the astonishment of Mortaigne, for each day, each hour, evinced the virtues, the excellencies of D'Avi« non- —each dav, each hour, cc- mented stronger the close, firm bonds of grateful friendship. With admiration did the count trace the bright eiïusions of genius, with wonder witness the plastic ease of address, the nameless grace which marked the manners of his interesting elivr»
deve. The mind, the observations of D'Avignon, spoke the rich culture of persevering toil, the preeminence of education; his were not those superfi¬ cial aequuements which caught the iov- ing eye; no, they were the solid el ulu¬ lions of a well-stored m?nd, the bnlbant efí\¡siot>s of a tempereu judgment. D'Avignon was scarcely nioiteen ; his figure was tall, elegant, graceful; the flush of health dappled bis fine o\al fate; avd his features, not actually beautiful· bore the straup of sensibility and t n tu» re grandeur. A pensiveness, more of ha* bit than of nature, mellowed the lustre of his sloe-black eves; and the oft-heaved sigh of hidden birth, spoke a heart, t f not inured to misfortune, at least not unassociated with sadness. The bri Ilia n t effulgence of a meridian sun shone on the canvassed tent, as the count stood attheentrance,ashepushed aside the folds: he paused, for he beheld hisfiiend pacing the narrow limits, abstracted, lost ; h.·»
his helmet Jay upon the floor, his hand grasped his half-unsheathed sword ; and every energy of his mind seemed buoy¬ ant, as it were, upon the wing of fancy. f< Be thou/' he exclaimed, gazing upon the polished blade, " the passport to happiness ; be thou the passport to death or preeminence ! Yes, in the thickest heat of battle be my bosom pierced with a thousand wounds, or be my sword vic¬ torious ! >J 41 You are a strange enthusiast, D'Avig¬ non ľ' exclaimed Mortaigne. The youth started; the hectic of a moment crimsoned his cheek, and then it died away, pale as the sculptured marble. ťf Your pardon/'he at length faltered; " an enthusiast, but not strange ; for surely every soldier alike pants for the laurel of renown." " You parry well/' said the count, smiling, f 'yet surely some sinister pas¬ aion
sion actuates the wished-for preeminence. Victory hangs not upon a single arm ; patriotbm pants for the signal. zation of thousands. Come, confess, is it ambi¬ tion ? or^------" " Yes, ambition/* interrupted Ι>'Λ v ig¬ nori, his eyes darting fire; ** í would perish the atom that î am, or I would live to efface my—-my—3 would be wor» thy—" he paused for breath, then with an emotion which agitated his whole frame concluded—" your friendship/' ** No exploit of courage, no distinction of rank, can augment my friendship/* replied Mortaigne; " no, not the most pointed marks of royal munificence can, in my estimation, elevate the saviour of my life." His hand was extended; D'Avignon grasped it with fervour. " I would emulate the deeds of glory/* resumed the youth, scarce knowing what he uttered; fl I would graft, even on the stem
stem of an ignoble lineage, that which should snatch mv name from obscurity ; 4 -J ' i would ennoble it*^—I would become Again he hesitated, and again every feature appeared convulsed with the con¬ flict of hi j feelings. "Why all this mvstery? why all this perturbati cm ?" demanded the astonished Mortaigne. fi Reveal your secret grief, exphiin the source of sorrow; my lips shall be sealed at your bidding, and my interest, my services, the interest, the services of my family, all—all shall be at ν oar command." In vain Mortaigne urged ; DWvignon continued silent ; he folded his arms— he buried his face in bib breast—he tried to hide his emotions ; but the swollen tears rolled from his eyes on the ground. (i D'Avignow/* pursued the count, " rankles there a wound which interest must not probe—a gangrene which friendship
friendship must not soften ? Ab ! need î repeat your claims? My father, my mo¬ ther, join in the grateful fervour of their son; my sister, daily, nightly in her prayers, invokes a blessing on my pre¬ server." (: Ah God !" burst from the lips of the youth. " Tell me—tell me who you are?" urged Mortaigne, again grasping hh arm, and again gazing intently on his varying countenance. D'Avignon raised his dark eves from O .r the earth ; they met the expectant glance of the count ; again his cheek Hushed crimson, and again his agitation almost checked articulation. *' \\{\o are you ?'' repeated Mor¬ taigne. ťí You have honoured me with the ti¬ fle of friend/' faltered D'Avignon. f ' Honoured !" reproachfully uttered ihe count, " Be it so/' checking his eíľort
effort to speak ; " your family ? the place of your birth ? your father—where is ν our father ?'' t( In the grave," solemnly replied D'Avignon. ίζ And your mother?" interrogated Mortaigne. <f Javes," rejoined the youth, raising ¡as claiped hands to heaven— (f lives to pray for th rt runaway who has fied her ì)osom\ shelter/' li Was İt indeed the th'mt οΐ fame—- ws it In 'eed tì^e love of enterpiize, the bjpe of eonq-'tV, -which Inred vou from the quiet haunts of peace? * agiin (pu *>- : oned the count. t( Tell me, my friend—» η v.

as of a falling pile echoed from the k í; it beckoned to solution, and again he hastened through the damp and dcboLic passages.

D'Avignon ; ft I have encountered no living soul within the ruin.

Mortaigne broke from the restraining aim of his friend. ** I fear the search is vam/' exclaimed D'Avignon, closely following, if Yon path leads to the rampart ; let us desist, it teems with danger------ '* " Danger ľ' repeated a voice, and D'Avignon and Mortaigne alike un¬ sheathed their ¿»words. The vagrant moonbeams now darted athwart the gallery, and novv again a fi «rure «lid ed onward. Once it paused, and once it seemed to beckon; but when the friends advanced, again, with noiseless s*eps, it fled and disappeared. '* Let ns tarry till to-morrow/* again whispered D'Avignon ; t£ perchance some •■«wily snare-™—** 41 Vow,

Ci U thou art a corporeal substance, stand," exclaimed D'Avignon, springing to the spot on which the figure appeared to linger; but again it receded, and again» with noiseless Мер, it glided onwards. Intent upon elucidation, banishing every thought of self in the enterprize in which they had engaged, they boldly advanced, tmawed bv intricate curvings or occa- stonai gloom, now parsing through long and narrow passages, whose walks were mildewed by unwholesome damps, and now descending flights of Heep and bro¬ ken stabs, whose terminations seemed to close in darkness; but still the transient moonbeams fell upon the beckoning ligure, and «still each cheating movement teemed
teemed -with explanation^ ^ The mea¬ sured lash of the waves now sounded overhead, and the casual flash of a torch superseded the silver softness of the moon. The friends paused in irresolution. It was evident they were lured even within the earth's dark bowels; but why with so much caution, why with so much imstery, they had yet to learn. The light still trembled in distance ; sometimes it waved to and fro, as a bea¬ con, and then again it became stationary аз a brilliant star. " Let us sift it even to the centre/' whispered Mortaigne, as cautiously they ad\aneed· Again the light receded, and again their own footsteps broke on the blank of night, Ihe passage gradually became narrower, and more winding ; it wai roughly chiselled out in aiche c p through which the gaîhering winds murmured si discordant music/' Thick andunwhole- χ 3 some
some damps corroded the walls, whilst ever and anon the very footing felt pre¬ carious,, glazed as İt was by the slimy track of the crawling toad and dingy adder. Suddenly the rush οΐ waters be?» came more distinct ; suddenly the pas¬ sage terminated, or raTher it expanded into a large extensile vault, at the ex¬ tremity of which, by the aid of the torch which flamed in his hand, they dis¬ tinguished the figure. A serge cloak enveloped his giant limbs, and a close* drawn hood shrouded the outline of his features, He turned towards them ; he waved his hand as though to stay their progress., yet still they advanced. " forbear !" he cried ; but they did not tarrv. lie stooped down—he groped upon the earth—a square space gave ■wa\—he stood upon the very brink of the tra ρ -door. The friends pressed forward, panting to overtake, to unmask the nivsrerious inn ate οΐ the ruin, to bring to light the m id nig he-
midnight-haunter, to convict in open day all his spells, all his secret machina¬ tions. " Think not to escape me/' exclaimed the impetuous Mortaigne; and then as the torch fell through the chasm, he fan¬ cied the leap already taken, and with a rashness, with a bound which desperation scarce could warrant, he too sprung through the trap-door. D'Avignon he¬ sitated not a moment ; the example of his friend was not to be resisted—he looked around—he could distinguish no object in the overwhelming darkness—he could hear no sound—be pictured nought but treachery—he thought οΐ nought but Mortaigne overpowered—he pined for nought but to aid him in the hour of need. The dying embers of the lamp lay scattered on the floor beneath ; he felt for the steep descent, yet scarce ι ν touched the stairs : the voice of the count answered to hi¿ call-—that voice gave energy to exertion—that voice banished ι 4n every
every latent whisper of prudence. Yet scarcely had he passed the opening when reflection came like death, when reflec¬ tion came to reproach, to convict ; for the trap-door closed after him, and suc¬ cessful treachery sounded in the loud snap öf the secret spring which sealed up the entrance.

the natural tribute of affection, and the marchioness jo\ fully hailed the apparent iiow of unbroken spirits. But still the secret care at her heart was oppressive, «•»till the communication of Micheline tilled her wkh doubt and dismay. The smile of the marquis seemed but as a prelude to the disclosure of his de- Mgn ; the converse of father St. Pierre but as a strengthener to resolution; his ianguage was prophetic, his observai ions teemed with the \irtue of obedience, with tlie instinctive claims of duty. He recommended blind submission to a pa¬ rent's will; he spoke of unmurmuring acquiescera e as the sure indication of a meek and pious heart ; and when timidly »she ventured to dissent, when she breath¬ ed something like the natural bias of independence, his frown and his anathema spoke conviction to her feelings—spoke bis exordium but a weighty prelude to a more active mandate. Hours, days, wore away, and Corisande heroically 14
heroically persevered in her banishment from the boat-house; she scarcely trusted herself to gaze upon its grey turret, nor once alone courted the flower-fringed banks of the Rhone: she felt— she knew the weakness of her own heart, and the promise with which she had lulled the anxious fears of her mother, forbade every mental indulgence. But though she appeared fast falling into the calm of content, still when she tuned her lyre, it was to the notes of sadness, it wa.ï to chant her vesper service, or to warble some wild ditty to beguile the tedious- ne«ss of the hour. Often did she pace the matted galleries of the chateau ; often, in the dusky-grey of twilight, did she visit the chapel, and noiseless as a spectre, tarry amidst the aisles, recalling the deeds of other years, and musing over the entab¬ latures commemorating the dust of her family ; often did she bend her knee on the altar—often, supplì' ating protection J ß fur
for her absent brother, couple with Li¬ the name of his preserver ! Yes, D'Avignon, though unknown, though unseen, lived in the grateful heart of affection ; for true valour and true he¬ roism glowed in the brilliant exploits, in the dauntless deeds, which the sanguine feelings and nervous pen of the count de Mortaigne had perpetuated, Corisande had told her beads, and whispered an Ave-Maria, when the sound of an intruding step aroused her from her devotions. She looked up, but no inter¬ vening shadow darkened the aisles; the narrow ramje of arches checkered the silver radiance of the moonbeams, and the Parian bust of many a mouldering reliek shone conspicuous in distance. " it was fancy/' she exclaimed, gazing with pious security around ; ** fancy, the muse of superstition, which oft belying the senses, peoples the midnight gloom ; fancy------- " She

A sensation, if not of fear, at least of awe, quickened the pulsation at her heart; the tint of her cheek faded, and her lips became colourless as the marble against which she rested. fi Mother of God !" she aspirated, meekly crossing her bosom, " w;hat means this strange perturbation, this novel ter¬ ror? why do my knees tremble ? why do my eves close in inward dread? my con¬ science records no premeditated wrong, neither does »my heart harbour hatred against human being." " Whv then woo solitude even to mad- ness?" demanded monsieur de Roussil¬ lon, abruptly stepping from behind the shelter of a pillar; *' why------" But the loud shriek of the terrified girl checked any further demand, and the mai quis sustaining her in his arms, la* nìented his own ¡ncautionf It was long ere
ere Corisande forced a smile, and longer still, ere raiding her head from the shoul¬ der of her father, she repaid his zeal by returning composure ; but even then every transient scund renewed the trem- blinde agitation of her frame, and everv intervening shadow excited the start of nervous itritability. " You aie a strange, wild <-riri !" said the marquis, as lie drew her from the so¬ litude of the chapel; " yet, methinks, this propensity to gloom ^nd unsocial communion is more the îesulr of a toi- rupt taste than a natural bias." " Father St. Pieri e says," meek! v ob¬ served Corisande, i( that the heart can¬ not too frequently seek converse with itself; that to curb its rebellious spirit, to reduce it to subjection, is the tust step------" u h yours a rebellious spirit r' 1 inter¬ rupted the marquis; " does your heart already need so tight a rein ?" Corisande hesitated; but for the friend¬ ly
ly shelter of night, the marquis must have traced the vivid glow which flushed Per cheeks. ťť You are silent/' he resumed. " Say, child, U this the self-awarded penance for imagined bin ?" " Oh, no ! not sin/' exclaimed the e nthusi.istic Corisande; ťt thank Heaven, mv heart knows not the mildew οΐ sin ľ' mi " And vet vou shrink at everv passing; shadow/' rejoined th.e mnrquis; "you woo solitude*, thouuh the verv whispers of the breeze palsies your resolution." ,f 1 believe í am very weak," timidly replied Coricando. " 1 would cure you of (hat weakness," quickly pursued the marquis, <f or ra¬ ther, î would remove the possibility of its indulgence. Mirih and conviviality must supersede this morbid gloom ; the chateau must change its aspect·; every object, every Ĺ\ce must borrow a new garb ; you, Corisande, must bear the ¿rede of gratulation ; you must banish everv
every propensity to melancholy, ΐοτ you must act the herald of a father's wel¬ comed " Me, my lord ?" said Corisande, starting in terror. " Ye\ you,*' mildly restan cd tîıe mar¬ quis; tf you most be the goddess of the solitude; vou must hail the duke de Briarc;on with the smile of pleasure, not the far-strained grace of cold polite¬ ness " " As the friend of my father," faltered Corisande, * ( the duke de Briar çon will be received at the t ha tea u d é< Pshaw ! Ilıt friend of my fatl и " repeated monsieur de Roussillon, half playful, half ironically. ' f De Briançon is certainly my friend, Corisande; but de Biiançon hastens on a dearer, on a nearer mission. You are a novice in ihe heart of man, else would you know that the mask of friendship often veils the hopes of love—that local interest lurks beneath the surreptitious colouring of proilered
proffered service —that disinterestedness reigns not with passlonk' Corisande's cheek flushed crînison. " As your friend, my lord/' she again faltered, " the duke de Briançon will claim my attention." "As your favoured lover," said the marquis, unwilling longer to be misin¬ terpreted ; " as the futuie husband your father selects. Remember my eye will be upon you/' he continued, pausing at the door of her chamber; ' ( your actions, your looks will be watched. Beware how you oppose my mandate-—beware how you incur my displeasure ; for not even the weak tenderness of vour mother -will shield you from the bitter tax of dis¬ obedience/' Corisande bowed in silence, but when alone, when in the solitude of her own apartment, her tears flowed in rest rai ned, her sobs swelled almost to suffocation, (l Ala» í my father/' «she aiticulated, ·' to what а п»)1сьа doom world \ou f o nsi g n
consign me—to what years of heavy re- pinings, of persevering sufferance! to wed where the heart owns no interest- to live in the blank calm of mere endu¬ rance—to combat the truant flights of thought—to curb the wild sallies of ima¬ gination." She shuddered—she raised her clasped hands to heaven— " Oh ? if I had never seen thee," and a sigh heaved to the me¬ mory of the mountain-hunter— <r if 1 had never seen thee, the duke de Briançon would have been hateful to me." Her heart no longer shrunk with the pang of remorse; the indulgence of fu¬ gitive thought could not be guilt ; she threw open the casement—she gazed on ih« spot where she had last caught sight of the stranger, the tree against which he had rested, the swad upon which he had stood. The chaste moonbeams sil¬ vered the scenery—the cypress-grove waved over the grey turrets of the boat- house, and the gurgling undulation of the
the river soundecl like the moaning sighs οΐ sympathy. iS Dire, dire ambition !" sighed Cori- sande, as leaning from the window, she inhaled the pure breath of evening, " thou foe to peace, thou mildew to hope, thou subverter οΐ mittlren law«s, thou despotier of nature's feelings, Alas! what a false estimate of happiness is thine, my father, to seek for bliss in grandeur, for content in the circles of a court I Too sure am 1 indeed a novice, for my heart shrinks at the sacriiice which policy and towering pride enforces." Again her tears flowed, again her bo¬ korn heaved with convulsive a^ony. " Oh, my mother !" she sobbed, " dearest, best of friends, even thy ten¬ derness cannot save me ! I am doomed —I am devoted to misery ; grandeur, not happiness, is my destined portion." Unconscious of the approach of the marchioness, she stood with her arms folded, and her eyes iixed on the cloud- kv-p;
less firmament. Tla· wind blew the dark hair from her forehead; her cheeks, her lips were coroni less, for the darte beamr of the moon reflecting on her features, tinged them with almost marble white¬ ness. In vain the marchioness remonstrated, in vain bhe questioned , Corisande could only weep; and even when she found articulation, it was to inveigh aganrt bei- fate, to burden Ilea\en v.ah ргзгегь ior a release lio m endurara е. i( Fie, fie, Consande !d said the mar- chionc-r, gentlv chidaig the impatdnce oí* her daughter ; ťi veni íorzet that the С 4 . ι chastening rod of aiïliition is wisely or- iiained to temper and imjjrove the ficai t , that elated by the unvarvmg tide of prospeiity, man, buoyant on the vving oi self-consequenre, would even Io->e sighc of the gratitude due to hr Creator/* ŕŕ True, trap" sobbed Consande, raising to her bps the hand aíľcctionate.y clasped in her own; '* bur Ьишаа nature- ι

She paused, for the almost convulsed agitation of her mother betrayed the sus¬ ceptibility of her feelings. " Proceed/' urged the marchioness trembling, gasping for breath— " finish the picture, pursue the similitude ; detail the withered hopes, the blasted prospects of fond expectation. Oh God ! the snares of Treachery, the fatal, fatal trance of credulity ! Neither must v ou omit the moment of awakening thought; no, nor the heart -rivings of blank despair, of tor turing, agoni/mg conviction/' *· Alas! my mother!" sobbed the alarmed girl. 'i he inaridii o o t ss started—she pressed her hand upon her forehead—she ¡breed a sickly smile. u 1 had indeed forgot the present/ she articulated. u Tear not, my Corisande, my darling child ; you are no- vet sactiheed, vou are not vet the victim of insatiate ambition. 1 will fly to the nıanjıus— I will supplicate him on my kuer- ,
lentes; the voice of nature must pre- % aíí, the pleadings of a mother must prosper." * e Not tonight," implored Corisande ; * ( my best of mothers, not to-night. If you love me, if my peace is dear, if you indeed pitv me, suspend the trial. Hush all to forget fulness ; repose yourself this night, and I shall [eel comfort." <l Aias ■ there is no time to lose/' said the marchioness, snatching the pleader to her bosom. ,ť Fear not for me, my child ; ì have weathered so many storni*:, that the frown of unkinduess cannot harm me/* 11 Oh no, no, not to-night !" again pe¬ titioned Conquide ; íŕ vou must not brave the storm to-night; vour spirits are so agitated, your feelings so op¬ pressed, policy, humanity, all plead against it/' " Be it even as you wish, my love/' said ma-dame de Roussillon, kissing he* pale cheek. * 4 J go ; I leave you also ίο r vy u, ν ;

Bui though she bid her daughter good* night, thru ц,1 with pious composure shr nuunnrtd her pasting blesMn^, still affection, anxietv, bid her linger; and tifien did she return to whisper some new care, to enjoin some new caution Cox batide *iţîuggîed with ht r feelings - -she combatted her tears—she strove to tzhcât her mother i tito peace ; but no *ooner did the door close upon her be¬ loved
loved presence, no sooner did this appeal ti pon her gratitude cease, than the deso¬ late colour oí her own joyless expecta¬ tions returning, preyed like a mildew 011 her heart. Alas! how in a moment w.r overthrown all the pictures fancy had ever sketched of felicity ' how in a mo¬ ment did the giant sinde of ambition counteract all the visionary dreams of bliss !

Alive but to the softer feelings of the bf an. she had ever pictured hap- -Oi *· iiiue v, i
piness with the pencil οΐ a true vision¬ ary ; she had decked it immured from the busy haunts of men, shut onf from the prying eye of idle curiosity; she bad hemmed it round with a romantic bulwark οΐ Înnged rotks and verdant mountains; she had furnished it in the domestic calm of never-varying dutv, in the indulgence of serene contemplation, in the grateful incense of praise, and in the interchange of sympathetic hope, οΐ •sympathetic interest. Foor Corisande! it was solitude, it was the unsocial blank of seclusion, it was the undeviating indulgence of native enthu- siasm, which had iir-**t nurtured rhe ex¬ panding seeds of sympathy in her pure bosom; which had awakened, which hiid stamped it on every day-dream of «her imagination.

Corisande started from the sad indul¬ gence; she remembered the anxious fears of her mother, and she strove, for the sake of that mother, to reason her mind into composure. But though she sought her pillow, though she chased away her tears, t hou 2 h she laboured against the suffocating sob which swelled her bosom, yet day dawning on her sleepless eyes, found her torturing memory for one clue to extricate her from the labvrinth before her. Yet not alone did she watch the tardy movement of the hours; for pitv and deep-felt interest, chasing away the poppy balm of slumber, doomed the marchioness alike to a care- fraua b t vigil. «Γ? ΐ~ι * Morning dissolved the blank of night, and day again succeeded.

" To what unknown cause may i attri¬ bute this early vi&ur" he inquired, at¬ tentively noting those sure indications of broken iest, faded cheeks and sunken eyes. 4i í come to sue indulgence/* said the marchioness faintly ; " to supplicate for one who d reach» the heavy weight of a fa¬ ther's displeasure/* ťi îi you would speak of Corisande/ sternly replied the marquis, *■ she already knows how to insure my appiobation.

Olank, almost despairing, were the re¬ flections of the prisoners, as they groped around their miserable dungeon, as hope seemed to expire with the last ember of the deceptive torch, and darkness and lingering death seemed to close upon their late brilliant prospects. Bitter were the murmurs, loud the complaints which burst from the fevered lips of the indignant Mortaigne; patient the endu¬ rance
rance of the pious Dk\\ ignon: the one, basking in the sunshine of prosperous fortune, had never submitted to lite wholesome curb of self-control, la,d never felt the necessity of tempoiizka; his feelings; the other, in the mdl field of adversity, had bowed îo the cone«: kng scourge of passion, ba 1 quraied cf ku bitter cup of disappoka nent, had im¬ bibed that salutary medicane to the heart, patience and resignation. "Would ihat I had the \üîain here in my grasp !*' exclaimed Mortaigne, ^li¬ king his clenched fist against his fore« head* i: Fool, fool that I was, tu be thus cozened, thus duped !"

" Alas!" and his bosom swelled with a labouring sigh, " this is not the first blast of fate against which I have combatted. But the ppst must not be recalled, the present alone calls for exertion;" and then again, with extended arms, he groped around the narrow limitation of the dungeon, and then he sought out the stairs leading to the fatal trap-door. "Strange, strange Г' murmured Mor¬ taigne ; * f I have stood undaunted in the field of battle, ï have dared the sharpened point of adverse swords, yet in this sepul¬ chre, in this living tomb, my courage fails, and all my native heroism expires!

They drew near to each other, they scarcely breathed, for voices, borne on the night-breeze, pierced even the dungeon in which they were im¬ mured, ît was no flight of fancy—it was no deceptive lure of imagination ; the splash of the oar could be distinguished, and the succeeding blast of a bugle fan¬ ned the almost ás ing breath of hope.

Hour after hour wore away; the threats, the denouncements, the murmurs of Mortaigne became weaker; exhausted, be threw himself upon the earth's flinty surface—-he folded bio arms in despair— îıe trared upon the past, upon tho pre¬ sent, till even m iser ν yielding to lan¬ guor, he nrensibly sunk into slumber. blot so the care-worn D'Avignon ; the power·» of his гч nd ν cav ì.pa.bdued ; weak and un ■ ailing lainepa.aion had not «sapped hii: strength, or debased his forti¬ tude ; he lc tea himself upon the stone- stcyu

Snaps' and determined was the decision of the marquis; \am the arguments сь- $амч! to shake las dire resolves : the cha- fep.u, beset by «aane m pierio u -s adven¬ turer, was no longer a &afe rttieat; and Corisande, the destined &aciiiice to gran¬ deur, was condemned to the jov less soli- tude of a convent»
Deep was the woe, bitter the lamen - triions of the marchioness; even the pious arguments of the confessor, fadier St. Pierre, was an insult to her fee lings; and she siw the hour of separation ap¬ proach with a presentiment of unknown ills. Corisande too wept upon her bo¬ som : banished from a mother she adored, exiled amid a land of strangers, preju¬ dice darkened a eloisfcr\ gloom, and dh- t M u4 jaundiced eveiv anticipation. She felt it w:r iti vain to remonstrate—she •Lit It r is m vain to supplicate ; a υ¬ ΐ'· cr's will wrr imperious, and submission alone rennined. ľainful was the eflbtt to qucni the iring sob, to chase the ^riding* tear, to Îorce a smile, to sum¬ mon one external sign of cheerfulness; -ne fr it that care within which baffles the In ht mask of assumed gaie t v ; and th« night previous to her departure, she lis¬ tened to the admonitions of madame de VourUtoiî with feedings not to be con- t.o , ¡·· L m ¡j Y P. »
The moon was half-hid as they paced the shrubbery, and nature, in dead si- lence, scarce bowed to the iníhience oí îhe passing breeze. No busy echo reached their car, no murmur save thr hoaise bubbling of the rapid Rhone. Corisande moved ь; íen íly onwards; her hand was clasped in her mother's, her eyes were fixed upon the grev turrets of the distant boat-house; thought had claimed its wild latitude, and spire of the reprehensions of the niarqui-s, the little boat and the mountain hunter were re¬ called to view. €t To-morrow/ 1 said the marchioness, after a long and painful pause— if to¬ morrow, at this hour, you will be be¬ neath the roof which sheltered m v in- fancy, Shut out from the world, your e; e will see nought but the image of saints, your ear will hear nought but the offering of devotion/* Corisande started—the vision of ima¬ gination vanished—the picture of sad reality
reality returned. " To-morrow, my mo¬ ther/' she faltered, raising the hand of the marchioness to her lips, f< I shall be within the walls of St. Honorée —to-mor¬ row I shall be banished your arms—1 shall be condemned to the society of stran« gers," iC To-morrow/' pursued the marchio* ness, " you will visit haunts endeared to memory—haunts which sheltered me alike în the hour of sufferance, as in the calm of peace. You will sec sirangers and friends; some who doubtless will recai me in you, and some who may strive to awaken the enthusiasm of self- immolation/' Corisande shuddered ; again her eyes sought the direction of lhe boat-house, und again îlıc image of the stranger íl ut¬ tered at her heart. " Heed them not/' resumed lhe mar¬ chioness, anxiously marking the flushed check of her daughter. "Hope expires L· a cloister's gloom, and existence with¬ out
out hope is as a world excluded from the ravs of the sun ; it is a barren waste, in which no social influence remains; it is a blank in nature, in which the heart seeks not, claims not, knows not one spring of promise. Time may change the decrees of the marquis, but the veil once assumed admits of no redress/* " he assured î will never voluntarily relinquish you, my mother," exclaimed Corisande, i{ unless——" She patred.

The marchioness trembled ; her paia cheek grew still paler, and her eyes were s u Ou s ed in tears. iť Nature has gifted me but with little spirit/* pursued Corisande, regardless of the emotions of her mother, " vet shall «j that spirit be everted; and, spite of my father's presence, even at the altar's foot will î reject flic duke de Brianron/* "If vou had never wandered to the boat-honied arked the marchioness— *' if you had never beheld the mvste- rious stranger, would vour rejection of the duke íle Idunn.on be as firm : " Condindo hesitated for a moment; her features were dappled with a vivid hue, lier eves were bent upon the earth.- - "Oh, my mother ! why do vou probe so deep?" she at length articulated; then v. ¡th a faint «smile, 4t if I liad never beheld the mo u n td та h' auer/' die con¬ tinued

scarcely-tasted repast, under the plea of preparing for her journey, she has¬ tened to her own chamber. *'Holy saints!" exclaimed Micheline, vainly striving to sooth the anguished sobs of her young mistress, u what a world do we live in î To be driven from post to pillar—to be shut up like slaves İn a monasterv, because some spirit, or devil, forsooîrn has written love -л erses in the boat-house.

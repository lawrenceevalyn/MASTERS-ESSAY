founntic and beautiful , but the mind of Father Rupert was not attuned to the beauties of nature, and his apprehen sions respecting the numeious banditti and smugglers who were said to infest the mountain of Estrelles were so great that he thought it more advisable to per foim this part of their journey by water Ht therefore made arrangements ac tordingly, but the wind was perverse, and blew a hurricane, delay he could not and most unwillingly he ordered guides and mulps to take them to Frejus The environ«« of Frejus, a town of consider able importance in those times were luxuuaiit to a great degree, and the am phitheatre built by the Romans, which is now quite a picturesque ruin, was then а Ьле monument, of architectural skill The aqueduct drew forth even from the father, expressions of admira tion and appıoaclııııg Gertrude, he said, " Behold, daughter, the greatness of my progenitors exemplified in these superb

remains of Roman grandeur." Gertrude made no reply, but the words "and their vanity" rose to her lips, yet she wisely suppressed them. She had left her novice's dress at Toulon, and had assumed that of the female peasantry of the south of France, yet she still wore a veil which flowed to her feet. It was formed of a light sort of woollen stuff, of a pale gray colour. It parted in the front, and was bound round her head with a fillet, so that she could close it, or unclose it, at pleasure. When they passed through a town it was drawn together, and Father Rupert led her mule ; when they traversed the mountains or the plain, she was per¬ mitted to inhale the pure breath of heaven, and to gaze upon the surround¬ ing scenery ; and the passage over the mountain of Estrelles presented objects of peculiar beauty and grandeur. In many parts the road ran along the edge of a precipice, overlooking the sea ; in
4-
others it wound round iN brow, through woody dells, where the dark bright red of the cherry laurel enlivened its gloomy foliage, and foimed a pleasing relief to the sombre hue of the pinps Here and there, a spot sheltered fiom the north presented a small garden scene, where the myrtle and the rose united their sweets, and perfumed fhe air, while then path, adorned with s eet thyme marjoiam lavender, sage, tamarisk, and other wild herbs, formed a carpet so soft so elastic, and so odoriferous, that Ger trude thought she never had seen so de lightful a spot Just as Ihey had enter ed a little dell thus adorned, and watered by a purling stream, they heard a distant noise of arms Father Rupert halted and Nicolai spurring on his mule, turned a projecting rock, and discovered at a little distance, banditti attacking a party of travellers The guides, when infoimed of this circumstance, fled, but ere they reached the entrance of the
dell, were driven back and Tather Ru pert pushed on the mules, supposing theie was more safety where there wen many, than where tliere were few m number The travellers appeared to bi persons of distinction, and their chiel who was partly clothed m armour, fought gallantly At sight of our travellers some of the robbers advanced and b uk them surrender, but the knight no soom r obseived the rem of Gertrude s mule seized by one of them than he advanced and levelled the bandit to the earth His followers approaching and the giudei who had fled being compelled by the first law of natuie self defence to exeit themselves, the banditti, who were only a straggling party, were at length com pelled to quit the field Gertrude had been so ternfied when the knight who came to her rescue, felled the lobber that she had fainted there was no time for assisting her at the moment, fuithei than by lifting her from hei mule, and в 3

placing hcr on the ground upon a bank, whicli supported her, while the knight took his station in front of her Father Rupert showed he knew how to handle a sword as well as a layman, and Nicolai seemed to enjoy the terrors of the con flirt, and to set death at defiance When the banditti fled, the knight raised Ger trude, whose veil had fallen back and displayed a countenance where the lily reigned sole mistress, but it was a coun tenance not to be seen without emotion The knight felt its power, and fetching water from the rivulet, he bathed her cold forehead, and chafed her hands just is Father Rupert came near, the life blood of her cheeks began to glow, and her expressive eyes were fixed with astonishment on the gallant youth who supported hcr ' Thanks, my son,' said Father Ru pert, approaching, with but ill concealed marks of chagrin, and drawing his cowl over his face, " thanks, sir knight, thy
7
generous gallant conduct surpasses oui reward ' " Reward · ' exclaimed the knight ' had this lovely being icsembled Alicto yet she was a woman, and had a right to claim the service of any knight in Chris tendoni, and dishonoured would he bc who could refuse it But to ladies fair <ind beautiful as she, mankind bow as to beings celestial, ay, good father, and you must own that he who could refuse to shed his blood for her, were worst than cowardly, for he must be less than man " " My son, replied the father, ' this lady must not listen to such romantic sentiments, she is travelling to her friends, and needs no help " ' Lady, ' said the knight, who saw the colour fade and then return with quick transition, as Gertrude unwittingly fixed her intelligent eyes upon him, " Is then ought that I can do for you ' speak feai lessly, I will protect you—are you tiavel в*

ling to your friends ' for by my knight hood, reverend father, I do suspect you That lovely, trembling being, looks not as if she weie journeying towards/nciirf? Speak then, lovely lady, feai not, can I asswt you " " I have no friends," replied Gertrude, with a countenance of such despair, that the knight, placing himself by her side, exclaimed, " Nature may have with¬ drawn those who should have proved themselves thy fnends , but the lovely and the innocent find them every where Is there any home to which I can con¬ duct you ' ' Gertiude's agitation was excessive dunng this speech, but at length she rose by a great effort, and turning towards the knight, replied, " To Ravenspur nunnery—there lives the only being who can— " Ravenspur nunneiy '' echoed back the knight, heedless ot the many inter mptions offered by Father Rupert, " I

have a sister there " Ei lboldened by this acknowledgment, Gertrude asked her name, and was informed it was Susan Saltoun " I think, ' she continued, " I have seen you, sir knight ' Never to my knowledge,' replied the knight, " foi never could 1 have forgotten those tea tines having seen them once ' " At Rai enspur, when you visited loid Henry, I saw you fiom my tunet, re sumed Gertrude " Were you the un¬ seen charmer, whose lute used to lull me to repose' ah, well might Henry conceal—" " Forbear, my lord,' said Father Ru¬ pert, yet still in a feigned voice " Forbeai ' ' repeated the knight haughtily, " respect for your cloak, good father, not for yourself, chains my tongue Who are you' " Do you know me now, iny lord ' ' answeied the monk, throwing back his «owl
10
" Father Rupert," said the knight, while the monk, turning to Gertrude, and looking on her sternly, bade her close her veil and mount her mule, add¬ ing, " Ye«, sir knight, Father Rupert himself, who, commissioned by the lord of Ravenspur, conducts the lady Ger¬ trude, the future and betrothed spouse of lord Henry, to her intended husband " " Is this true ' ' inquired the knight, eagerly " Alas'" said Gertrude, "such I find is my doom but, sir knight, I am a stranger to you, and have no claim upon your pity—leave me to my fate Remembei me to your sister, =he will recollect theunfortunateGertrude.and"— " I will not leave you thus, ' said the knight, " I will accompany you into the presence of your friends, and of this be sure, that no one shall compel you against your will Would to heaven,— but regrets are vam —besides this spot is dangerous we must be gone— " But take couiage, beauteous lady
11
I pledge myself your knight, and at your command will travel to the world s ex tremest end to do you service " Gertrude thanked him by a look, and mounting her mule, they proceeded with all possible despatch to complete then journey to Frejus The knight rode by Gertrude s side, and courteously be guiled the time by tales of former times, which he so framed as to convey to her ears a tale of love he dared not openly confess He was capable of enjoying the beauties of the scenery by which they were surrounded, and when tliey arrived at Antibes, he had said so much that Gertrude, though she would have scorned the imputation, thought him the most gallant, handsome, and coura geous knight that had ever addressed her When they had emerged from the defiles of the mountain of Estrelles, which is eight miles in length, they entered upon a beautiful beaeh Ou u e

one side of them was the sea, on the opposite one, tlie wild coppice of sweet scented myille, the cherry laurel, &c , which charmed them by then beauty and fragrance Gertrude s heart sickened as they en¬ tered tlie town, and she became so faint that she could sc ircely guide liei mule Onher right lund iode tlieknurht.onthe left Father Rujiei t The lattei had pie served a total silence since they had re sumed their journey, and was racking his bram in devising means to get nd ot the knight, ere they reached Nice He found, however, that although he was a match for Gertrude, for the carl and countess of Mannelli, and for many heads of consummate wisdom, yet the little blind god, in despatching one ofhis best stringed arrows to the heait of the knight, had rendered him so clear sighted, or so suspicious, that, notwith¬ standing all the monk's hints, innuendos, and dark speeches, the Lord Edward
13
baltoiin kept closely by the side of the fair Gertrude He was the last to retire to rest at Antibes, and the first to rise on the following morning, when Father Rupert took a formal leave ofthe young man, saying, he had ordered a boat, and meant to proceed by watei The knight highly approved this arrange ment, and gave orders to his suite to proceed by land to Nice The monk was disappointed, and finding that he could not get nd ot this hotheaded, silly, troublesome young man, he des¬ patched Nicolai to the lady Angelina, trusting to hei ìntiiguing spuit to ex¬ tricate then from theu present di lemma Gertrude, in (he mean while, was a piey to contending feelings What she had most ardently sighed foi was now accomplished , yet she was not happy There was theo a being in the world who seemed capable ot understanding and sharing those sensations, which had
14
hitherto lost half their charms, from tlie absence of a kmdred soul to partake oi them , but, alas ι it appeared to her that this circumstance burst upon her at a time when she could not enjoy it, when the presence of Father Rupert repressed the observations which continually rose to her lips, and checked even the gay and independent Edward Their little voyage was peifonned in the afternoon, and when they arrived at Nice, to the surprise of Gertrude, An gelina was on the shore waiting for them, and extending her arms towards her victim, welcomed her with the most distinguishing marks of affection, calling hei ' beloved child,' and inquiring in the most earnest manner after her wel fare ' You look fatigued, my love, eome with me, you need rest, and we have a most delightful residence in this neigh bourhood, where you will soon regam your roses Ah > Lord Edward," she
15
continued, " how glad I am to see you, and how much we are indebted to your gallant conduct for the safety of our be¬ loved Gertrude And you, good father, pardon me that I welcomed you not before ' " Benedicite, daughter,' was all he could utter, so astonished was he at the conduct of the lady " Matchless wo man,' he silently ejaculated, " thy con¬ duct calls forth my warmest approba tion, there is a pleasure in seconding the schemes of mmds formed like thine Angelina was thus attentive to all , so easy was she, so unaffected, that Edward gazed upon her and the pale Gertrude with astonishment, but one expressive glanée from the latter, which she involuntarily gave him, explained the mystery, and by a returning glance he convinced her she was understood A burning blush suffused her cheek at this conviction, and the scalding tear of shame hung on her dark eyelids A
16
deadly paleness succeeded this glow, nnd her downcast eyes were not again raised from the ground " Oh heavens, ' she thought, what have I done ' He must scoin me, loathe me ' This thought chilled her soul, and with sensations which none but an ingenuous mind c<ui imagine, she entered a romantic castle, inhabited by the Count of Mai incili " Up¬ on returning to my native land, ' said Angelina, " 1 advised my loid to as sume one of the titles of my family It is attached to a beautiful villa wi- have on the confines of Tuscany There f.iy beloved Gertrude will have ample scope to indulge her highly cultivated mmd, both with regard to the beauties of na¬ ture and those of a superior cast She is well acquamted with Italian, my lord, for as I had always intended she sliould sec the beauties of my own brilliant clime, I wished hei also to be sensible of its still more beautiful language You will favour us with your company, my

lord, foi a time Lord Henry is absent, but he will return soon Gertrude, nay do not blush—Lord Edward knows thou art oui child from affection, but will bc more anon With language such as this did the Countess Mannelli flatter heiself she deceived Lord Edwaid Saltoun But the youthful knight was convinced by the glance of Gertrude that the lady was playing a pai t , and so enamoured was he ofthe modesty which had so evidently condemned that glance, that he resolved to ascertain from her own lip» whether she were a free agent, Ci vt hether she weie ıeally m a state of thraldom Fa thei Rupert, who watched his counte nance with intense attention, discerned this secret resolution, and trembled lest he should succeed Gertrude was press ed with affectionate e irnestnebs to w ıth draw and take some repose, and Ange lina leading her to the apartment pic pared for her, shut the poor girl in, and
18
fastening the outer bolt prevented her quitting it without her permission Lord Edward Saltoun had quitted England soon after his visit at Ravenspur Castle, and was therefore a stranger to the return of Richard Ravenspur and his family to the court of England Of Bolingbroke s return, and his subsequent accession to the thione, he had learnt vague reports, and the ladies having withdrawn, he solicited Tather Rupert to give him the particulars ol those events which had so lately changed the whole system of affairs in England With a perspicuity and clearness which interested Lord Edward, the monk entered into the most minute de tails, except those whicli related to the house of Ravenspur These he care fully avoided, and when this political discussion vvas ended, he asked the youthfullord where he was going when they met in the mountain of Estrelles Lord Edward smiled ' Truly, good
19
father, hc rpplied, " when I met you I was, I believe, m search of adventure With a heart free and unshackled, a stranger to the joys of love, which had never enlisted itself m the service of any one particular fair dame, I, as in duty bound, and like a gallant knight, resolved to seek out the distressed, to succour thera, avenge them, and to prove myself a loyal knight, not unwor¬ thy of the honour conferred upon me by the gallant Duke of Milan, when last I visited Italy s fair clime ' " Such schemes as these,' replied Father Rupert, sarcastically, "belit the young and indiscreet, they never leam experience till tıs bought, and that at no small price neither And so, my lord, you left your native land to enlist your self the champion of distressed damsels, or rather wayward gnls, who, upon the first opposition of their friends to their inclinations, have recourse to sighs and tears, complain of heaven and their
20
fate, till they meet some gallant knight who immediately falls in love, effects the lady's deliverance, and then finds to his sorrow that the affections of the beauteous fair one are perhaps unwor¬ thily engaged, and that he has risked his honour and his life, in order to pro¬ cure the gratification of a sinful passion to persons whom he never knew be¬ fore. Such, my lord, is very generally the fate of you knights-errant. If yours should partake of this romantic, pleas¬ ing, gratifying, and honourable nature, —remember you had a friend who warned you." As Father Rupert said this he rose to leave the room, for, with a fiend-like satisfaction, he had watched the chang¬ ing countenance of the knight as he re¬ capitulated a series of events, which might possibly be prophetic of Lord Edward's doom. " Stay, father," he exclaimed ; " explain yourself,—to what do you allude ť

22 " The child of bounty—a foundling ' replied Father Rupert, " one whom a soldier found, and the lady Angelina brought up and educated as her own ' ' Ah' a foundling'—a lovely one—of so unknown an origin '—But who was the slave who dared aspire to so much loveliness? For, indeed, good father she merits well that epithet,' said Lord Edward ' You 11 not believe me,' rejoined the father " for preposterous so it seeirs, that it looks more than improbable—im possible should be the word could I not prove it to you by your own observa tion —Clod, Lord Ravenspur s fool ' '— " I caught him seienading her under her window, while the transported fair one, placed chair upon chair, and table upon table, to behold this same Tom Fool " If this be true, ' observed Lord Edward, with considerable agitation, " I must confess, I think you are wrong to
33
accelerate her union in the noble family of Ravenspur If she be so dissolutely inclined, she deserves the severest punishment—she deserves to be—Oh, there is no trusting to these fair out sides,—fool that I was, why, I wonld have staked my honour upon her truth and purity, would have risked my life in her defence Ay, father, you may well smile ay, ay, smile on, good father ' —Lord Edward paced the room, as Father Rupert said, " What, m good truth, my lord, were you so far gone as this' What' love at first sight' Come, come, my young friend, and listen patiently, many an older head than yours, has been deceived—many a tougher heart than yours has been be sieged, and yielded at the first assault, but you «Лой, from her own lips, be convinced that what I say is true Another time, and you shall speak to her yourself I do not require you should believe my tale, upon mere as
24 nertion. But, I am sure, you will not refuse to believe herself.—I have an appointment with Lord Ravenspur, who is ignorant of this whole affair ; be care¬ ful, therefore, not to betray the secret I have intrusted to your keeping. I shall see you again in the morning." Father Rupert left the room, and Lord Edward walked up and down the apartment for some time ; again, and again musing upon all he had seen of Gertrude; all he had heard of her. The more he reflected, the more he felt it impossible she could be so depraved as to acknowledge an affection for a fool.' " And," said he, after a pause. and with a deep sigh, " the sooner J. quit this plaee the better, for, were she pure and spotless, as she is fair and beau¬ tiful, yet it would be cruelty for ipe to pay lier any particular attention, since the' pride of my father would spurn me from his door, should I choose a bride of an ignoble name—how much more would
25
he scorn to acknowledge as his daugh ter, a poor unknown foundling I will away to morrow—and yet, methinks, 'twere wtll that I should see her once, and ascertain from her own confessions, that she is worthless, it would enable me to shake hei from my heart without one single feeling of regret If I quit her now ----- The entrance of Angelina interrupted his meditations she apologized for the absence of her loid and her son, but hoped that Lord Edward ivould make it convenient to wait the arrival of the latter, " he" lord," she said, " would join them at supper Lord Edward returned his thanks, and gave that sort of answer which left him at liberty either to remain longer or go, as his judgment and inclination should lead him At supper the Count Manp»lli made his appearance, and the evening passed stupidly enough Lord Edward's eye» vol iv с

could not fix on one of them one cır cumstance alone appeared clearly and distinctly to her nind —Lord Edward coald and would defend hei „hchatUaid so, and she was very sure he waa no re créant knight, he was no base deoertei of the innocent, nor would he forsake her, who had solicited his aid, She had known knights who had delighted in oppression, but then their general con duct was so different to that of Lord Edward, that it was treason to make the comparison Having thus convinced herself she had one friend neai, in the midst of so many enemies, she closed her eyes, and sweetly slept till morning

Gertrude's countenance was at this moment crimsoned, but as she crossed the apartment, she saw Lord Edward at the door '—One flush now succeeded each other so rapidly, that had not tears at length lelieved her overwrought leclmgs, the result might haie been fatal " Retire, my lord," said Father Rupert, " retire, nor lurther humble the future bride ol Lord Henry Raven spur ' ------ These words acted like an electric shock upon Gertrude She started, then sunk upon her knees, and extending her arms and raising her eyes towards heaven, as if to implore its assistance, its ratification of the vow she was about to make, she solemnly piotested that she never, nevei would wed Lord Henry, whose unmanly conduct, m call¬ ing in the aid of his lathei and mother, and that of the monk, in order to inti¬ midate her into so hateful an alliance, rendi led him loathsome ю her, and a

disgrace not only to knighthood, but to manhood Several times the father had attempted to interrupt her, but carried on by the energy of the moment, she heeded not his repeated commands of silence, till she had concluded what she meant to say From Lord Eduard she turned haughtily, he had condescended to be come a listener, a spy upon the pnvacy of her ow n apartment, and, as her ideas collected themselves, she addressed her self to him thus " I blush, sir knight, at having craved the assistance of one, who appears not to fee' that the meanness of a listener is incompatible with the nobility of knighthood I have lived at court, my lord, and, though my name is unknown, many a knight there would have thought himself honoured had I solicited a favour from him I am heie in a fo reign land —" Gertrude, * exclaimed Father Rupert, astonished at the loftiness с 5

by Father Rupert whose malignity to wards her ippeared to be boundless Yet in this dilemma she resolved not to lorsake herself and when she heard Father Rupert and the knight quit the apartment she stok fiom her oratory uu 'astened the door of entrance of the former The persevering obstinacy with which the countess and her lord persisted in piosecutmg a match appa lently «o degrading to them astonished her and after mature consideration upun this subject she felt they must have more than common reasons to in duce them to act upon their present plan She was roused fron her medi tations by the apjiroach of footsteps ■md an attempt of some one to open the door Gertiude demanded who was there ι Open the door rejihed the count of Mannelli for so we shall in future eall Henry formerly Lord Ravenspur and Gertrude with a palpitating heart

obeyed The count entered closed the door after him, and for some minutes stood in that same spot, fixing his eyes sternly on his helpless victim his vary ing countenance bcpoke much agita tion , at length he advanced, and in accents somewhat softened from his usual manner, he said " Gertrude, I am informed by Father Rupert that you have behaved towards him with an inso lence which cries aloud for punishment ihat he, scorning to take advantage of his right, as your father confessor, to inflict a severe penance, has commis sioned me to remonstrate with you upon the subject, and to warn you from ie peating a fault of so great a magnitude The consequences, Gertrude, would be such as you are not aware of The result would bring down a punishment upon you, which would exceed your ut most imagination You are not aware perhaps of the influence ofthe fathers of St Dominick You are not aware that
42
they hold the principal offices of that dread tribunal the Inquisition." Gertrude gasped for breath ; imprison¬ ment in the dungeons of that terrific tri¬ bunal, its racks, its tortures, immediately presented themselves to her imagination. The count saw her terror; something like compassion rushed o'er hie heart, as he gazed upon the pale being before him. Gertrude fancied she saw this feeling gaining ground, and profiting by appearances so flattering, she advanced towards him, and entreated he would rescue her from the power of the monk. She clung to his feet, while her upraised tearless eye, the convulsive sobs which burst from her bosom, and the tone of agony with which she implored his pity, struck deep upon his heart, and kindled feelings to which it had been a stranger for many, many years ; ever since the days of his earliest youth, we had al¬ most said, of childhood. He trembled violently, and betrayed scarcely less
43
agitation than the panting victim at his lttt, while he replied thus, endeavour mg to raise her at the same time " Gertrude, there is one way by which all the dangers that threaten you can bc instantly averted There is one mode of conduct which will secure to you rank, wealth, and independence Why then hesitate for a single instant to do that which would restore you to liberty, and place you m a situation which would render you the envy ofthe half of man kind' The means ' ' said Gertrude in faltering accents, whose hold of the count had gradually relaxed, as she pro ceeded, " the means to effect this de ыгаЫе end ' Consent cheerfully to wed Lord Henry ' Never, was Gertrude's reply, as she hastily rose, and shook back the Mav ing locks which had escaped their confinement, and fell in wild luxuri

46
she was no longer sensible Surprised that she made no reply, he called to her to rise, but receiving no answer, he stooped to raise her,—he started back upon viewing her colourless cheeks and lips and called aloud for help, as hei senseless aim fell motionless from his hold His cries brought the countess, Jaquelina, and the monk to his assist ance The former was not affected, but desired Jaquelina would raise her and place her on the bed " A little cold water will revive her, you, my lord retire with the father, I will call you when she is restored to animation The count refused to leave the apart ment, and was so exceedingly agitated that he drew forth many contemptuous expressions from his lady, which he for a long time allowed her to utter without making any answer At Jpigth, how ever, roused by her sarcasm on his feel mgs, he replied, "Angelina, if you have relinquished those of a woman, at
47
least permit me to retain those of a man I shall not leave the room till Geitrude is restored to animation, nor will I then permit her to be tormented by the pre sence of Father Rupert or yourself " Truly, my lord, you improve,' re plied his lady, " Father Rupert and myself are infinitely obliged to you for the character you have bestowed upon u« —' " This is no time for foolish talk, re sumed the count sternly, " send for the jew s daughter Jaquelina, for the lady Gertrude's swoon appears as if 'twould lie eternal He shuddered as he spoke, and paced the room with hurried steps, while Angelina, with a countenance un moved, gazed alternately upon her lord and upon the senseless object of then contention Father Rupert was anxious to open a vein, and Jaquelina returning with intelligence that the jew and his daughter had left then dwelling, the count consented, but ordered his lady
48
and Jaquelina to quit the apartment, de sirmg that Jane, an English servant, they had brought with them, should attend Father Rupert having performed the operation.waitcd with some little anxiety for the result, and as soon as she gave symptoms of returning life, he quitted the apartment at a signal given from his lord, andjomed the countess, with whom lie had a long conference The latter indeed scrupled not to express her con tempt of her lord's want of resolution, to which Father Rupert answered by a smile, which fully evinced that his opi mons coincided with those of the lady This meeting produced no farther marks of his approbation of liei feelings, but his expressive glance at her, and the words, " ) our ìcmark is ]ust, lady, as he left the room, caused the blood to rush through her whole body, with a precipi tance which almost suspended respira¬ tion Contempt and disdain were strongly

marked on hcr expressive countenance and she softly exclaimed, ' ЛЬ ' ıs it so reverend father' Nay then we must break up all intimacy the band of confi dence is broken, but soft, Angelina, thou hast a dangerous game to play That monk has power, dissimulation, and will to accomplish an] plan he has set his heart upon he knows our secrets—ha» the master key to unlock them all—and expose us to the derision and contempt of a gazing world Ah' how could I suppose he would have been the slave that he has been to me, if he had not hoped for a field in which to gratifj his haughty soul and shameless passion» 4 las' alas' I must dissemble, for this aich-hend has changed the system, the slaie h.is now become the lord Fool that I was to intrust him, and to yield to his solicitations to repair to Italy Well, well, I lack not wit, good father, and since it must be so, we will even try who can play the deepest game One

power I have, I do perceive; and though I scorn to use it, and my heart repels thy daring insolence, yet it must lead thee to thy ruin, if thou attempt to thwart my plans. But soft, who comes here. It is he, whom this foul priest would in¬ jure. Now for a scene with him, for with him I must dissemble too." The Count entered in a thoughtful mood, and to his lady's demand of, " how fares Gertrude ?" he replied, " better, tliough her senses wander, and her trem¬ bling frame still declares that the con¬ versation, which at your suggestion and that of father Rupert, I pursued, has struck upon her frame till every chord vibrates with terror. Go not you to her apartment ; she 'shall not be harassed more to-day. Jane is with her, and I have given positive orders that she un¬ close the door to no one but me." Angelina said the command was un¬ necessary, as she had somewhat else to do, than to attend upon a wayward girl,
51
who seemed born for their torment and ruin ' " Let her return then to England, ' said the Count," I will find a trusty per¬ son shall convey her safe to Ravenspur Gratitude for this great service will close her lips, for all she has endured with us , and my brother, will at last have cause to bless, instead of curse, me ' "Yes, my lord,' replied his lady," and I hope that you will send a herald before her, to declare her name and breeding, that proper respect may be shewn her, and at the same time proclaim to all the world your own bright deeds.

have had a warning, will prevent my fall ing into so great an error ' " You consent then, my lord, that she should remain in Italy ' ' eagerly asked his lady " Yes," was the reply, " upon the conditions I have named to you break thera, and the contract between us is no longer valid " Agreed, my dear lord,' replied An¬ gelina, " agreed, and now let us dis miss this subject for others more enliven ing When shall we resume our joui ney'' " When Gertrude is fit to undertake it, ' rejoined the Count, and as he said this he left the room, where Angelina re mained for some time, musing on the un toward circumstances which had thus arisen to blight her prospects and those of her son, of whom she was most pas sionately fond Indeed, it was not pos sible for the countess to feel a moderate attachment or aversion, all with her par d3

took of the impassioned nature of her glowing clime, and her hate was alike herce and unrelenting, as her love was warm and glowing To the aversion she entertained for Gertrude was now added additional strength since she feared the timidity of her lord would expose her to the derision and contempt of a world, (of which she had hitherto been the ad miration), by restoring her unfortunate victim to her parents, and thus betraying that, whicli she would gladly conceal at any pnce She now thought of di vising future means of pioceeding in her deep laid plot, and it was not till he" lord again entered, and dinner was a ι nounced, that the present obtruded itself upon her imagination

WHEN Gertrude was first recovering from her fainting fit, she closed her eyes again, as if fearful of meeting some terrific object. The Count no sooner observed this, than he left the room, desiring Jane to close the door after him, and forbidding her to admit any one into the apartment except him¬ self. The shutting-to of the door roused Gertrude again; she fearfully opened her eyes, and looking slowly all around her, she asked Jane if they were alone ? " Yes, lady," replied Jane, " my lord has just left the apartment, and we are quite alone." о 4
56
Geitrude rose slowly, and again cast ing her eyes round the apartment, she took hold of her attendant's arm, and hurrying across the room hastily entered the oratory, the door of which she closed, adding, " We shall be safe here—no body dare enter—not even an Inquisitor himself " " The Holy Virgin forbid he should attempt it, ' replied Jane, " for I very much fear we should not be able to keep him out " " If you will but be courageous," re sumed Gertrude with a vacant look— " we shall be sure to succeed—and the Lady Abbess and the nun will reward you, for you know, Jane, I can give you nothing, I am so poor, I am not worth a noble, but we could escape, it would be a fine uung, would it not ' to cheat them all ' ' " Dear lady, said Jane, " youi head wanders sadly, compose yourself—I shall be hajipy to serve you without a
57
reward,—and tell me what has hap pened to distress you so ' ' " He talked, resumed Gertrude, with a solemn look, " of dungeons, and tor tures, and Father Rupert, and what could he say more appalling'—Oh, Jane, if they should take me to the Inquisition, don't you forsake me — ' Yes, yes—no, no, no—yes, I mean," said the affrighted girl, whose terrors of the Inquisition were to the full as great as those of her mistress, and she knew not what to reply " I am sure, ' resumed Gertrude, " he said so —Oh, that I were dead—laid m the cold peaceful grave, for there alone I shall find rest, but I am weary, Jane, very weary, my head aches, and my heart beats, as though t would leap from my bosom What has happened' Hark 1 sure I heard the sound of footsteps The familiars are come ' " Dearest lady,' replied Jane, " there is nobody coming—and my lord de d5
58
sired me not to admit any one but hnn self So pray, lady, do not distress yourself so much, for you really terrify me—pray now be seated " Did the Count say, I was to be alone' Are you suie he made no ex ceptions ' Did he not say, she added, with increasing agitation, " that Father Rupert was to be admitted, and—and— the officers ofthe Inquisition? " Dear lady, no—he said no one should enter your apartment, except himself, till you were quite well, and he looked so piteously at you, and sighed so— " Ah '' said Gertrude, " then he will not forsake me " " Do you know, lady, resumed Jane, endeavouring to turn the conversation, " that Lord Edward has left the castle, and that too without waiting to see Lord Henry—and Father Rupertaccompaniedhim to tho hall door, and I heard my lady and he say, they were, in truth, glad he was gone How handsome he ıs, don t you think so—dear
59
lady, and so graceful and so brave, and so gallant too But I think he was rather rude to go away in such a hurry He is gone to England , I wish I was going too—and look, lady, there is my lord's attendant just entering the court " A groan from Gertrude recalled Jane from the window where she had taken her stand, and she started as the coun¬ tenance of the former again assumed a death like paleness " Oh, do not faint again, lady—oh, what shall I do'—are you better'—shall I call any one"' " No," said Gertrude faintly, " un close the window, let me have air,— there now, I am better—only do not leave me, for heaven's sake do not for¬ sake me I shall not trouble any one long for my health cannot stand the re¬ peated fatigues and trials which daily beset me , yet I should not like to die alone ι ' " Die, lady," echoed back Jane, "you shall not die but live to be a great lady d6
00
yet I am quite Sure you are better, and if you would but lay down for a short time, you will get quite well—do, pray now, let me load you to the bed ' Gertrude submitted, and having thrown herself upon it, she closed her eyes that Jane might suppose she slept and passed the time in ruminating upon the late events, and arranging her ideas, which were still so fluctuating that it was with difficulty she could bring them to settle upon any one point At length, however, the natural strength of her mmd and constitution surmounted these difficulties, and the past, the present, and the future, assumed distinct forms She then reasoned with herself, and endeavoured to strengthen her mmd by recalling the observations of the lady Abbess to her recollection, and forti fj ing it by the precepts of religion Jane, who had watched her atten tively, saw, with delight, the composure which had replaced the violent agitation
61
of her countenance, and she softly artı culated, " The Holy Virgin be praised she is at last asleep Poor thing, how pale she looks A gentle tap at the door startled her, at first she pretended not to hear it, but its repetition compelled her to use Lpon asking who was there, the Count replied io her, and she opened the door Gertrude still pretended to be asleep, but her feelings almost betrayed her Marinelli gently touched her hand, it was cold as death, and turning to Jane, he desired she would fetch some bread and a little wine, which he ordered her to give to Gertrude when she awoke, adding, " I will keep watch till you return " Unfortunate girl," said the Count in a low voice, " would to heaven I could recai days and hours fled never to re turn that I could call back the fleeting moments of my life! alas'—how dif ferent would be, at this moment, my fate
62 and thine But I will stand thy firm friend —if thou canst not be restored to those who sigh to embrace thee, thou shalt not, at least, be made a wretched victim of ' Jane at this moment entered and in terrupted the Counts soliloquy, and Gertrude unable any longer to feign sleep, rose from the couch and seated herself upon it, she was unable to speak, and the Count looking »t her with ten¬ derness said, " Gertrude, I hope you are better You must not hurry your spirits, nor fatigue yourself, but retire early to rest, after taking some refresh ment, for the Countess is anxious to proceed on her journey Gertrude thanked him, and said, " she hoped she should be quite well on the morrow, as she should be sorry to derange the Countess s plans " The Count having shaken hands with her, quitted the room, and leaving her in a maze of doubt He then knew who
63
she was, it was evident, from the ex¬ pressions he had just made use ot " Was you living with your lord and lady when I was found, ' said Gertrude, addressing Jane after musing some time " Yes, lady, I was in the castle,' was the reply " Can you not, then, tell me .ill the particulars which attended that remarkable event » Was there no clue, Jane, nothing particular occurred at that time which could assist you to guess who my parents are ' " The good angels defend us, ex¬ claimed Jane, " how should I know any thing, lady, about your parents, when you were found in the court-yard of the Dalace, and, besides, I was but a child " "True," replied Gertrude, smiling, "how should you know, it was indeed a silly question, Jane, but I am going to ask a more rational one now—can you tell me where we are going? ' " Into Tus cany, lady,' said Jane, " and Nicolai says, and all the Italians say, that there
64«
never ivas so beautiful a place m this world as the castle Marinelli —you will be delighted, lady, for it is situated at the foot of the Apennines, and there is a convent just pressing througli one ot the glades which looks so beautiful from the castle, and the lady abbess is л fuend of the Countess, and there you who were so fond of the nuns at Ra venspur, will have an opportunity of in dulging your taste for the pleasures of a convent for my own part I have no taste that way, I eannot say I like such hard living and long fasting as the nuns of St Dominick are compelled to follow and I really think there is no necessity for our flogging ourselves, because St Catherine of Sienna choose to submit to such severe penances, that at last she killed herself I am very sure that if 1 were a nun, I should long to leap over the walls twenty times in a day I tremble at the very name of St Do шинок
65
" Hush · ' interrupted Gertrude, in a low voice, " there is some one outside the door —for mercy s sake, Jane, do not talk thus—remember, good wench that Father Rupert------ Jane s countenance had changed from white to red, and red to white, during the short space of time occupied by Ger trade in this speech, whicli was inter rupted by poor Jane, who, falling onher knees, began a solemn protestation of her high respect for St Dominick, and all the monks and nuns of the order, and wearied the Saint with prayers for his protection and prayers Gertrude saw that all attempt to stop her was vain , she therefore sat in de spair, for the effect of Jane s vehement prayer and protestations upon the monk, if indeed he were there listening, would lie a positive conviction to his mind that she had previously been using expres sions to the dishonour of the Samt, she now so vehemently commended
66
When at last want of breath compelled Jane to pause, Gertrude said, *' And now, Jane, if you have really finished your orisons, I would retire to rest, but not before I have advised you to avoid Father Rupert for some little time to come, and to be very cautious in future how you mention his patron Saint, even in your prayers, and as Nicolai ıs ------" Here Gertrude stopped, for she was fearful of proceeding in observations, which, if repeated, might do much more harm than any spontaneous observation made by Jane " Nicolai lady, you were going to say something about him—he is no fa vounte of mine, but that s no matter, if you have any message to send to him, I will deliver it with pleasure, though he always speaks so gruffly—he terrifies me to death " Gertrude assured her servant that she had no message to send to Nicolai, only again wished to caution her how she
67
talked about St Dominick " And now, Jane,' she added, " you may go, for I am very sure I shall sleep I shall close the door after you, and when I want you, I will blow my silver whistle Jane left the apartment, and when she entered the common sitting room for the servants, more than one voice in quired after the lady Gertrude " Is she better'' said Nicolai, " what hap pened, Jane to make the lady swoon '' " Ask Jaquelina, replied Jane, "she knows more than other folks, according to her own account—I was not there , all I know is this, thatthe lady Gertrude looks very ill, and very unhappy ' " Humph, answered Nicolai, " you had better keep that tongue of yours between your teeth, madame Jane—it may lead you into trouble What has she to make her unhappy' ' Why she does'nt like my Lord,' replied Jane, " and I wonder who likes to be compelled to marry a man she does
68
not like ' for my pait I should feel just as terrified ifl were she at marrying my lord Henry, as I should do, being, as I am, a servant, to marry you, Nicolai ' " Thank you for the compliment, said Nicolai, with a nod , " but, Jane, I have no more desire to have you for a wife, than you me for a liusband Come a little nearer this way, what 's the fool afraid of' I am married, Jane, and as soon as I get to Tuscany, I shall give up service, and return to my own home But in the mean while I want to ask you a few questions about the lady Ger trude Did Father Rupert terrify the young lady, or was 1* my Lord · " " I am sure I can't tell, replied Jane, " but I think it must have been the monk, for he always terrifies me when¬ ever he opens his lips " '* Go to, you are a fool," replied Ni¬ colai, " What can he do to you ' ' " Why he can put me in the inquini tion," resumed Jane—then recollecting
69
м hat Gertrude had told her, she added, not that he ivould, I am sure, for I have the greatest respect, Nicolai, for all the fathers of St Dominick, and paiti cularly for the Saint himself, and St Catherine, his bride " Hold your tongue, replied Nicolai, sternly, " say no more upon this sub ject, and be careful how you talk of Father Rupert to any one, but tell your lady that Nicolai would be just as pleased that he had not assisted m bringing her to Italy—don't forget that Jane and say, moreover, that I shall go to the castle with my lord but that ------ here he stopped, and after a pause he added, ' but that's enough for you to remember at once ,—go, go, and be faithful to her, and I will be your Inend but mind, Jane, if I catch you blabbing, you might as well cut out youi tongue at once, for I will be revenged upon you when you least expect it The Holy Virgin defend me, said
70
Jane, as Nicolai strode away, " what a pretty set of beings they all are ! and they look so gruff, and speak so sternly, that my heart quakes within me when they open their lips to me Oh that I had never quitted England ' " What i" asid Jaquelina, at the sound of whose voice Jane started, " what ' sorry to quit such a cold barren clime to visit this delightful country · Anil pray Mrs Prate a pace, what makes you sorry to quit England ' you had best not let my Lady know this, she would send you back to England in a twinkling, but it would be in a way you would not like ' " They are all alike,' ejaculated Jane " I never saw such a set of domineering, cross creatures in all my born days " " Get out of my way, said the cook, as Jane hastily crossed the kitchen to take shelter in her own sleeping apart ment, and there again lament her folly in quitting England.
71
It was long ere Gertrude could com pose her mind for sleep, and when she did sink into a slumber, she slept so long that Jane was alarmed Yet she did not communicate her unea siness to any one, but took her station at Gertrude's door, anxiously listening for the whistle It was long after sunset ere the signal was given, and she was just on the point of tapping at the door when Gertrude opened it " Ah, lady, I am so glad to see you, said the girl, " so glad, I began to be fnghtened—and you look better ' Gertrude smiled, and, after some con versation upon indifferent subjects, Jane rose, went to the door, opened it, step ped into the corridor a little way, and looking anxiously each way, then re turned, saying all was safe, she seated herself by her lady with an air of im portance, and began thus — " I have got a message for you from Nicolai, lady , he desired I would tell
72
you that he was sorry—no, that was not it—that he would have been just as pleased if he had not assisted in bringing you to England, to Italy I mean He then desued I would tell you that he is going to the wstle with my Lord, but that------and there he stopped and said that was as much as I could remember but I am sure I could have remembered a great deal more, and so that was all lie told me ' " A strange sort of unmeaning mes sage,' said Gertrude, "I do not quite comprehend it, therefore give as an an siver, that you have delivered your mes sage, and that I have no reply to make to it There is some one approaches, hush hark' ' Open the door," said the Count, and Jane springing from her seat obeyed, courtsying at the same time to the ground as she was leaving the room ' .Stay he continued, ' I am meiely come to inquire how the lady Gertrude
ТЗ
isî But you look better, Gertrude, and I think would be able to travel on the morrow—what say you ? " Gertrude assured him she was so far refreshed by this short repose, that a night's rest would enable her to com¬ mence her journey the next day." " Be it so, then," replied the Count, " I shall say tas much ; and do you, Jane, pass the night with your lady ; for in her weak state, it is necessary she should have an attendant to herself; and I depute you to this oflice." Jane's joy, as her lord proceeded, is not to be described, and it broke out rather boisterously, " Am I then," she said, " to be no longer under the govern¬ ment of the Signora Jaquelina?" " Make no questions," replied the count sternly, " but do your duty here, or you will find anothei arrangement will be made." Jane shrunk abashed from this rebuke of her lord, and retired to the further ._ VOL. IV. E
74 end of the apartment during his short stay ; but he had no sooner made his exit, and closed the door, than she hastily approached Gertrude, saying, " I may now then call you my lady. Oh ! I am so glad :—and Jaquelina will now have no business to order me about, and make me fold up my lady's robes,—I mean the Countess's robes, and do the drudgery, while she stood looking at me. No, no, Signora Jaque¬ lina, that 's all over ; and I shall take my seat oppo sie to her, and"— " You must remember, Jane, there will still be a considerable difference between you; for she is the waiting- woman of a Countess, you of a poor foundling," said Gertrude. " Ohi that 's nothing at all, my lady," replied Jane ; " for my lord al¬ ways desired you might he called the Lady Gertrude: and, besides, by and by, you will be a Countess too. Oh, how I wish you were !"
75
" Countess of what'" inquired Ger trade with a sigh '* Why," resumed Jane, ' I don t exactly know I tliought it would have been,—let me see, Countess of Fitz hugh,—but now that 's all done away, and so, it appears, is Ravenspur So it must be Countess of Mannelli, —then when my lord is dead, and my lady ----- you will go back to England then—will you not, lady ' ' " Do not talk thus," said Gertrude, whose eyes were swimming in tear», for Jane's speech had conjured up many pictures from which her soul recoiled " Do not talk thus, but prepare for bed I am weary , and my harassed spirits need repose I cannot talk, pray there fore say no more " Jane looked distressed " I am not angry, ' resumed Gertrude, " but I can neither bear, nor enter into, con versation " Jane silently obeyed the commands e 2

Florence just at sun-set. The delight of Gertrude, as she viewed this stately city, as she glanced at its marble palaces and fountains, its lofty arcades, and its magnificent streets, thronged with busy inhabitants, is not to be described ; while the scenery which surrounded it appeared to realize all the fairy dreams of the beautiful in landscape. Here the vines twined round avenues of chestnut and lime, forming a perfect and natural ärrade, while roses, ever- blooming, honeysuckles, and myrtles en¬ twined together, composed the hedges. In the distance, rose the lofty Apen¬ nines, now scarcely discernible, except their summits, where the sun's rays illumined their snowy tops, while at her feet flowed the gentle and poetic Arno. Gertrude was disappointed when com¬ pelled to enter the inn where they were that night to rest. She had not been molested on her journey by Angelina or Father Rupert, neither had Jaque-
79
line intruded herself upon her: the latter had received positive orders from the Count, to forbear offering her ser¬ vices where they were not wanted ; and thus Gertrude was relieved from the impertinent freedom of the waiting woman, who did not fail to revenge herself upon the innocent object of her disgrace, as she termed it, by fabricating a variety of slanders to the discredit of the former. These, however, Nicolai always contradicted, when they were uttered within his hearing; and when reproached by Jaquelina for taking part against her lady, he asked " if his lady then were the authoress of those slan¬ ders?" " For my part," he continued. " I have no reason, 1 am sure, to take the part of the young lady, only for justice- sake, for she has never shewed much liking to me. She always looks scared when she sees me, and yet I paid hei- all the respect I could do, when we e4«
80 were fellow-travellers : bu«' I must say, for all that, that I do not like to hear lies told of her, so Jaquelina you had better spare your breath ; for what you swear against her, I will contradict with an oath as strong ; and I wonder who would be believed soonest !" " Upon my word," replied Jaquelina, " one ivould suppose you were willing to rival the knight-errant Clod, the fool, with whom she had an assignation in the castle of Fitzhugh." " Jaquelina, "resumed Nicolai, " have a care how you provoke me. That as¬ signation, as you well know it, was a friendly visit from the poor honest fool ; and, by my troth, 1 honour him for his intentions, although I was bound in duty to counteract them. You know it was so, Jaquelina ; and I should be glad to know, if you would not, under the same circumstances, have been very happy to have listened to any fool, (and he ivould have been a
81
fool indeed,) who would have offered you the same services." Jaquelina tossed her head, and, with a smile of scorn, said, " Adieu, thou brave champion!—my lady, no doubt, will highly approve thy conduct, and duly appreciate thy services." " Jaquelina," retorted Nicolai, " you had best beware how you jeer me. I am not to be trifled with. My lady has found me hitherto what I always pro¬ fessed to be,—faithful. When my in¬ clinations cease to flow in that direction, I shall not need the interference of a waiting-woman to inform her they have altered their course. Be discreet, or you will find, that mine as deeply as you may, 1 will undermine you, if you provoke me. There is my hand,—your lady and self have nothing to fear from me. Villain as I am, I never yet be¬ trayed my trust—and that 's more than many an honest knave can say." Jaquelina disdained to reply, and e5
82 hastened to her lady, with a long story, and a poetical one of Nicolai s defence of Gertrude The Countess could easily distinguish betiveen the truth and falsehood of this tale, but she discovered, through its flimsy tissue, sentiments which might prove inimical to her plans She there fore sent for Nicolai, desiring he would explain himself upon the conversation which had passed between him and Ja quelina " A few words will do that, replied Nicolai "Jaquelina is always slandering the lady Gertrude, and although I have y our lad yship s interest so much at heart, that I would willingly assist in any plan to further the young ladys marriage with Lord Henry, yet I never will heai her unjustly defamed by Jaquelina oı any one else, I have three reasons for this —In the first place, all that Jaque lina says ıs supposed to spring from your ladyship or Father Rupert,—a con
83
elusion which would be greatly to the discredit of you both ;—and this is one of my reasons for contradicting her." The Countess coloured, and as Nicolai proceeded thus, her expressive counte¬ nance betrayed a degree of confusion, which seldom clouded her all-command¬ ing and obedient countenance. " In the second place, if the lady Ger¬ trude is to marry my young lord, I should be grieved that his lady were considered a woman of light fame and blemished reputation: and thirdly, my lady, I never could bear to hear any woman so grossly and falsely slandered without taking up her defence." ■ Nicolai probably forgot at this mo¬ ment the tale he told the wood-cutter ; or probably he thought that no slander, as both Gertrude's name and destination were not likely to be ever known to the peasant, and (herefore could not injure the object of his false tale. The Countess appeared convinced of eC
84 his integrity, as she called his fidelity to herself, and dismissed lum with a small present After his departure, she called Jaquelina, and forbade her in future to say any thing to the discredit of Gertrude, for Nicolai's opinion of the bride of Lord Henry, had given rise to ideas which, for a time, greatly in¬ creased the comfort and happiness of Gertrude and, when they quitted Flo rence, the latter, who had hitherto tra¬ velled with the attendants, was desired to take her seat in the carriage with the Countess and her husband The Count was pleased with this arrangement, and, as Lord Henry had not joined them, Gertrude enjoyed to the utmost the beauty of the country they were tra¬ versing The first day's journey lay through vineyards and olive gardens, at least the lanes they drove through were bor¬ dered with those beautiful and pic turcsque objects, intermixed with rustic
85
tottages and farm-houses ; the magnifi¬ cent remains of former villas, the spires of monasteries, and the turrets of lordly castles They rested the first night at the foot of the Apennines, whose tower¬ ing tops were hidden by clouds. Gei¬ trude rose with the sun on the following morning and watched the progress of the golden god of day, ' Rejoicing in tbe east The lessening cloud, The kindling; azure, and the mountain's brow, Illum'd with fluid gold, his near approach Betoken glad Lo ' now apparent all, lslant the dew-bright earth, and coloured air. He looks in boundless majesty abroad, And sheds the shining day, that burnish'd plays On rocks, and hills, and lowers, and wandering streams, High gleaming from afar* " Such was the scene which burst upon the view of the delighted Gertrude when the sun rose above the majestic * Thomson.
86 Apennines With silent adoration she raised her eyes to heaven, and poured forth her soul in prayer and praise Long time she remained wrapt in the most delicious train of thought, till the voice of Father Rupert broke the spell, and convinced her she was still a tenant of this nether world " Daughter, said the monk, " after having performed with safety so long a journey,—after having arrived within view of the close of that journey, you would have done well, methinks, to have followed the example of the lady Countess, who has this morning paid her devotions at the shrine of the Holy Virgin, situated m yonder dell, and from which she is even now re turning ' ' I knew not her intentions, replied Gertiude, " or I should have solicited permission to have accompanied her But, reverend father, I have not failed to return thanks to heaven foi its nevei
87
ceasing mercies, and in this vast temple of the Omnipotent, on this splendid altar, the earth, have I poured forth my prayers, my praises The friar started as he replied, ' Bc shrew me, daughter, but I could almost suspect from this unguarded speech that thou wert tainted with the infidel heresy of the Albigenses Let me hear no more such language, or I shall hold it my duty to a higher power than thy fnend the Count Mannelli, to cite you before a tribunal appointed to crush this heresy, and to convince thee that I have power, and if the necessity demands—the will, to do thee this important office Know, proud girl, that I artı one of its officers, thou well mayst shrink, but as thou valuest thine own safety and freedom, thou wilt not breathe to mortal ears the intelligence I have just communicated As a penance for this imprudence I for bid tliy quitting any apartment which thou mayst occupy for the purpose of a
88 solitary stroll, till thou arnvest at tke castle of Marinelli , and this privation must seem to spring from thine own free will, not from my injunctions With draw, and instantly " Father Rupert was dehghted to have an opportunity of resuming his authority over Gertrude, and he knew the penance he had enjoined, however trifling it might seem, was one which would be particularly disagreeable to her, and would also expose hcr to the implica tion of caprice in the eyes of the Count, whose conduct towards her of late had lost all its seventy indeed Marinelli was quite an altered man He had become silent and dejected, he seldom •«poke, and was frequently heard to pace his apartment with hurried and uneven steps Sometimes he would sit by the hour together and sigh till a sudden thought would glance on his mind, then would he quit the house and seek shelter in rocks or woods On this very morn
89 ing he had left the inn, and wandered among the woods which skirted the Apennines ; as he returned he saw Father Rupert in conference with Ger¬ trude, and, quickening his steps, hc joined the Father just as the former withdrew. " You have had a conference with Gertrude I perceive," said he ; " I trust you have not exceeded the limits of a confessor. I have resolved, father, and my purpose is not to be shaken, that her future days peacefully pass away— neither shall she be compelled to wed Lord Henry, if she still persists in re¬ jecting his suit. Little good can now result from this match. He can never hope to return to England and regain his father's honours: and small would be his advantage should he wed the daughter while the brother lives. I have hitherto, father, listened to your voice as to that of an oracle; but by adopting the plans you and my lady
90
have proposed, I have imbittered every moment of my existence In future 1 shall exercise my own judgment, and endeavour to regain my lost tranquillity Father Rupert, with well dissembled humility, applauded the resolution of the Count confessed that he himself began deeply to lament the part he had adopted with regard to the Lady Gertrude, and highly commended the Count's intentions respecting the latter He added, " that he had ш truth just laid a gentle penance on the lady, for he lamented to observe, that she had of late neglected confession, and that this morning she had strolled from the inn instead of accompanying the Countess to a celebrated shrine in the neighbour hood ' " So far, returned the Count ' you are not only authorized by me, but it is your bounden duty to interfere I shall not interrupt your fatherly authority And now, good father, let me confess to
91
you that I am most anxious to reach my home, that I may carry a plan into effect, which I have long meditated, and which I have hitherto deferred till the marriage of my son was completed. It is fully my intention to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, what the result may be time will shew." Father Rupert could ill dissemble the joy this intelligence afforded him, wliich gave him the master-key of the heart of the Count. He therefore drew his cowl close over his face, and thus replied: " My son, the intelligence you have just given me glads my heart : it speaks a disposition »bent on things which ap¬ pertain to anotlier world : if my superior would permit, gladly would I accom¬ pany you on this sacred pilgrimage; circumstances may, ere you take your departure, be so arranged, that I may share your dangers and yaur perils. In the mean while, my lora^ would ad¬ vise you to wait patiently tilt the mar-
92
nage of your son is happily completed you will then have no care on this side the grave, and we may together find out some rude hermitage, and there in soli tude and peace end our sinful days, and atone for the crimes of our life The Count sighed deeply, and waving his hand to the father, who still lingered as if waiting for a reply, but finding the Count silent the latter left him with a parting benediction, and then hastened to the Countess to communicate to her the tidings he had just learnt She re joiced no less than the monk in her lord s resolution, as she flattered herself it would eventually accelerate her wishes The Count had been actuated solely by ambition in all his proceedings against his brother, the Countess was impelled by two more powerful feelmgs—revenge and disappointed love She hated Ge raldine, because she had secured the heart of Richard Ravenspur, and her love for the latter, though hate had in
93
p*rt supplanted it, was nevertheless re vived by visiting that country, in «Inch it had firat taken root The northern blasts had chilled, not quenched it ind the recollections of the days of her earlv j outh, of his matchless form—his un equalled grace and skill in arms, re kindled that flame which had so long lain dormant Here too she would pic ture hım unaccompanied by the bane of all her bliss,—here he appeared alone and to those feelings of tenderness to which her heart clung, was added her admiration of his character as a knight and as a man under trials which would have shaken the virtue of hun dreds Her aversion to Gertrude in creased as her former sentiments re turned , for hers was not that pure flame which rejoices in the happiness of its object, although it cannot partake of that happiness No—it was a selfish passion, and ttas accompanied by envy and revenge, greatly, therefore, did she
94«
rejoice in the resolution of her lord, and in order to confirm it she assumed a pla¬ cidity towards Gertrude, which charmed her lord into a dangerous forgetfulness of her former rancour. Gertrude was no longer restrained, but was free mistress ofher actions ; and oftentimes, as they were ascending the Apennines, she left the carriage, and, accompanied hy Jane, followed the winding paths, which were impassable for a carriage. The lower parts of these mountains were covered with vineyards and olive-grounds; above these ap¬ peared the elegant cypress, the larch, the Lombardy poplar, the chestnut; and last of all, woods of the monarch of the forest, the stupendous oak. As they ascended beyond these, the rocks became more barren;—here and there tufts of brushwood fringed their sharp peaks, but this at last totally failed, and a species of lichen, which, in some shel¬ tered spots, shed its bright green over
95
these rude recesses, was the only sign of vegetation which appeared The highest summits were many of them co vered with snow, and the cold was so great, that our travellers rejoiced ex¬ ceedingly when the distant spues and turrets of a monastery rose above the rock they were ascending, and offered them a shelter for the night At the sound of their mules' feet some of the friars issued from the hospitable dwell mg, pointing to the muleteers those steps which were most accessible foi the weary beasts With difficulty they reached the friendly habitation, where the abbot gave them a hearty welcome Supper was provided for the guests and when the hour of rest approached the latter were conducted to one end of the building, which was set apart for the use of strangers It consisted of a long gallery with apartments on each side, at the stairhead was a Gothic door, which was closed upon our tra
96 vellers as soon as they had all entered Joyfully they repaired to the different apartments, and, weary with the fa tigues of their |ourney, they soon sunk to repose

groves, purling streams, refreshing foun tains, and shady bowers, formed de licious retreats from the mid day sun, while the extensive lawns and gay pas tures invited its inmates to their even røg wal'v But the spot which most engaged the attention of Gertrude was the wood at the back of the castle, composed principally of chestnut and lime trees, under the shade of their lofty branches she would linger till her wrapt soul held converse with the invisible spirits of a happier world For some time she had an opportunity of indulging this exquisite pleasure, for Lord Henry did not appear until a month had passed tranquilly away Ger trade had no cause now to complain of her lot —no one molested her —no one interfered with her solitary ram bles and in the delightful grounds of Mannelli she passed certainly some of the happiest hours of her existence But this quiet was interrupted by the
103
arrival of Lord Henry and a party of friends, whom he had brought with him from Venice, whither he had been since he left England;—and the following day the number of visiters was increased by a party of the Countess's relations from Milan. Among fhe rest was the Count Frescati her brother. All now was gaiety, and the lofty halls and long extending corridors resounded with the sounds of merriment. Each day brought fresh pleasures, and at length the Count¬ ess, who played the hostess to admira¬ tion, proposed a masquerade. This was an amusement agreeable to the taste of her guests,—and on the fourth day after this proposition, the festive scene was to take place. The ladies during this interval were occupied in superintendingtheir dresses, and, as Gertrude was to partake of the festivity, she also was busy with Jane in arranging the dress of the evening. At first she had proposed that of an F 4·
104«
English peasant, not on account of its beauty, but because she longed to wear that of her native land, yet she thought it would too conspicuously distinguish her, and she chose the Venetian dress, consisting of a black robe, a string of pearls round hcr waist, and a long black veil and masque In this sober dress she hoped to pass unobserved, for theie wcic one or two of the guests who had annoyed her with attentions whicli weie by no means gratifying to her Each lady kept her dress a secret, and on the evening preceding the wished for day, curiosity was on foot, and much raillery passed among the gentlemen upon this subject The evening preceding the entei tainment, Gertiude when the rest ot the company weie enjoying themselves in the gardens, put on her veil and descended into the wood, as ivas usual with hei, and there wandered just as she was emeiging from it, she heard

footsteps, and a peison enveloped in a long cloak was close to hci ere she could flee, and had caught hold of hei lobe Гог one instant only he detained her and that was to present a piece ot parchment to hei folded together, di- iccted to herself He then fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving hci motionless with astonishment, she had however presence of mind sufficient to conceal it, and with hurried steps she hastened to her apaitment A consi derable portion of time elapsed ere she could compose heiself to peruse its con tents, and when she had done so, they were so enigmatical, that she was but little the wiser The language was Italian and the meaning ran thus He whom you condemn is indeed guilty, yet is he innocent nevertheless Time and the morrow will explain more He who writes this has been thy foe hut he is now thy sincerest friend Thou mt walking on the edge of a flowery precipice, ivoid the wood in future and beware to-monow p5

107
The Countess looked at, and approved of, it except that she left an elegant ce lestial coronet on the table, the points of which were surmounted by pearls, this she desired Gertrude would plaee over her long flowing veil, in order to con fine it There was no resisting this request though she would gladly have rehnguished the elegant ornament which would render her dress more conspi cuous One of the saloons of the castle was ajipomted to he the general room for assembling but rustic cottages, artih eial caves and innumerable shady re treats with seats had risen in the plea sure grounds There needed no lamps to illumine the gardens, for a cleai Italian sky, assisted by the bright beams ot a full moon, caused a second day A gentle breeze waved the light foliage, and produced an agreeable freshness, which was mcieased by the numerous f G

109
hand—saying, aloud, " That hc would treasure that kiss till he returned fiom his intended peulous expedition ' The Countess approached at this mo ment " Whom have we here so young, so gallant, and so trim '' " One, leplied the page, bowing, " who lives but in the smiles of beauty Fan lady, could I but see that face of thine, I should indeed be lost, since thy noble form's enough to win our hearts ' As the page said this, he placed his hand upon his heart—sighed deeply— bowed—and, with the giace of an aerial sylph, he left them " What said the pai lous boy to you, my Gertrude ι inquired the Countess " His story ran to the selfsame tale as that he breathed anon,' replied the agitated Gertrude Had she indeed been unmasked, the Countess would have easily discerned that the tale was not all told The
110
frequent passing and repassing of other masks put a stop to the conversation, yet she drew Gertrude's arm withm hers, and approached the crusaders and tho peasants The latter were indeed exhibiting masks of irritation, whicli exceedingly diverted the knight,—the Countess interfered, and as she removed her mask, courtesy compelled the knight to pay his respects ίο his noble hostess The peasants, prohcting by this move ment, extricated themselves from their dilemma, and one of tliem joined the Countess and Gertrude, but the knight was by ttie side of the latter, and though he spoke not, she felt an indescribable sensation, for as Ihey drew near the confines of the chestnut wood, he advised the ladies ' not to enter it, for he had ıeceıved positive intelligence, that cer tain evil spirit« had taken up their abode there of late ' The Countess smiled, while the peasant pressed them to enter and partake of some refreshment at the
Ill
eottage hard by, where his dame would be proud to entertain such visiters " The knight opposed this, and said he had little doubt but that he (the pea sant) was in league with these evil spirits, and that, as a Christian knight, he was bound by duty to defend all who were in danger, ol whatever degree, but that when such illustrious ladies, one of them his hostess too, were un wittingly rushing to destruction, it be hoved hım to shew he could, and would, support his character " Avaunt, there fore, ' he continued, drawing his sword, ' thou vile magician avaunt, nor dare to molest these matchless ladies The peasant appeared to swell with rage, and darf ng forward, lie attempted to seize the knight s sword, when Gcr trade, tcrrihed, withdrew her hand from that ot the Countess and fled towards the château, which she hastily entered, md seeking her own ajiartmcnt, hei lontending feelings found relief in

gained its empire in the castle, yet peace was still a stranger, for the events of the evening had been so numerous ana so contrary, that many of the inha¬ bitants of this splendid dwelling were a prey to most of the evil passions of nature. The knight and his train had disap¬ peared, no one knew whither; but the peasants had doffed their clumsy habili¬ ments, and had resumed the elegant dress of their country; the chief of whom, Lord Henry, retired to his apart¬ ment, soon after the interference of the knight, and there gave vent to his rage and disappointment. Father Ru¬ pert, although he partook not of the en¬ tertainment, was nevertheless one of those who was very anxious to play his part in the frolics of the night; but it appeared as if some invisible agent had penetrated the inmost secrets of his heart, in order to foil them. The peasants were all creatures devoted to
115
hım, and their intention was to have decoyed Gertrude into the chestnut wood, where she was to have been led on, until she came to one of the outlets, a carnage was there in waiting, into which she was to ha/e been lifted, and then conveyed to a nunnery at some distance, the lady abbess of which was the identical sister Frances, whom we have seen so busy in the formei part of this romance Here Gertrude was to have been compelled to wed Lord Henry, for the Countess had just learnt from one of her emissaries who had been to England, that the will and heaps of treasure formerly belonging to the Earl of Fitzhugh had been disco¬ vered, and that by the former, his own estates were to be inherited by the eldest daughter of Richard, Earl of Ravenspur, not doubting, as he observed, but that the bounty of the sovereign would con¬ ter this ancient title upon the man whom slie should honour with her hand

And battle—which ш the wide fall Of nations, blends the rag.« rí all, Ita husb of passions, and the sleep Of energies once strong ша deep Julia Alpinul* But who shall bid Ret enge be still, Or say to Hate, thou 'st had thy fill? When Lord Edward quitted Nice, he stopped at the first post, and remained there one day only ; he then left his ser¬ vants behind him, and, in the dress of one of the Italian peasants, he retraced his
Ili)
steps and took up his abode m a cottage at no very great distance from the town but he had been there only one day, when a person entered the humble dwelling, inquiring for Lord Edward Saltoun The peasant to whom it be longed started, assuring the stranger " there was nobody m the hut of that name, for, besides himself and his wife, there was only a poor vine dresser " " I shall wait and ascertain that, replied the man, with an air of one having authority, " I would advise you, good people, to be careful how you harbour persons whom you do not know Do not let me interrupt your employment, I shall not molest you " The peasant and his wife looked aghast, while the stranger very com¬ posedly took a seat in the evening, Lord Edward returned, he stopped short at seeing a stranger, and would have retreated , but the latter a dvanced ,
120
saying at the same time, " My Lord, I hai с a few woids to say to you " The fewer the btttei," íeturned his lordship, forgetting lus .lasuincd cha racter The stranger approached close to lum, and laying his hand upon Lord Edward s arm, he said, " You are my pilsoner '' After which he whistled, and three 01 four men enteied and blindfolded the indignant knight They hurried lum along to some dis tance, them raising lnm upon a horse, which was led by one of them, they set off at a busk pace, never resting except at night, but proceeding on till they came to Maiseillcs where they got on ship board Heie they passed a few houis, two of the men lemaining in the apartment with Lord Edward, while the third went to the sea side, to see if the vessel wero in readiness to icceive them which they expected All was as it should be, and the wind being fair,
121
he returned to his pnsoner, whom they again blindfolded and then led him between them as a person of whom the Inquisition was about to take cog¬ nisance This tale, which had been whispered wherever they went, had the desìi ed effect, for so terrible were the operations of this tribunal, that its.verj name ivas sufficient to produce a sensa tion of fear A cabin was appropriated to the usi of the prisoner, while at the door two of his companions kept watch In this manner he voyaged for some day», and was then again taken on shore and con ducted to one of the principal inns where the fellows who had brought lnm thither, left hıra, leaving a small purse of money by his side Before they quitted the house, they told the people belong ing to it, that the gentleman was laid down to rest for a while, but that m about an hour's time he would want refreshment, and ordered a hot ıepast voi. iv о
122
for hım Having paid for one days entertainment in advance, the inn keeper promised them every attention should bc shewn to his guest, and the fellows, having repeated their commands, quitted the inn, and instantly re embarked A fair wind soon carried them out of sight, and they in a very short space of time regained their native land Lord Edward, in the meanwhile, learnt from the inn-keeper, whom he summoned and who brought him re freshment, that the place, to which he had been thus so curiously brought, was Barcelona This appeared to him a strange adventure, but he was resolved to conclude it more agreeably Upon repairing to the quay, he there learnt that the vessel which had brought him, had sailed above an hour smce He then asked if there was any one bound for Italy, and received as an answer that there was one clearing out for Leg horn he instantly engaged a passage
123
on board of her, and on the following day set sail for the garden of Europe He had a most prosperous voyage, and upon arriving at Leghorn, he there met with a friend who had just arrived from Nice, and amongst other subjects of news which the latter mentioned was the departure of the Count Marinelli and family for their castle in the Apen nines Having learnt this, Lord Ed ward hired mules and arrived in the neighbourhood, when the intended mas querade was the subject of general con versation His friend accompanied him, and together they planned the scheme of appearing as a party of crusaders at this much talked of entertainment As his lordship was wandering in the vici nity, he met Nicolai there was some¬ thing unusually gloomy in the counte nance of this man, yet his piercing eye recognised Lord Edward thiough the disguise he wore his countenance brightened instantly, and he begged his о 2
124«
lordship would favour him with л few minutes' conversation He then briefly detailed the particu lars of Gertrude s present situation , of her departure from England, and, finally, declared that she was daughter of Richard Earl of Ravenspur Lord Edward was thunderstruck, and as Ni¬ colai proceeded to unfold the plan which was to be carried into effect at the mas querade, Ins indignation and rage knew no bounds He swore to îelease her, and to restore her to her friends, and assured Nicolai he would make him in dependent in fortune if he would asaist lum in prosecuting his design " Why, replied Nicolai, " I want no reward to assist you, for my heart aches for the young lady, but if we can outwit Father Rupert, we shall do wonders However, I can learn fiom Jane as to how her lady will be dressed, and I will contrive to give her a hint about the party of English peasants
125
This plan of theirs frustrated, you must go to England, and send a trusty knave to tell the Earl of Ravenspur where she is " " I cannot leave her thus exposed, ' replied Loid Edward, " to so many dangers, but I will despatch my ser¬ vant to England, while you must keep a strict watch in the neighbourhood and in the castle ' Nicolai promised to do his utmost, and Lord Edwaid retired to communi¬ cate to his friend the resuli of this un¬ expected and extraordinary meeting The day which followed the masque¬ iade, Gertrude spent in her chamber, and learnt from Jane that Lord Henry was exceedingly indignant at the pro¬ ceedings of the unknown knight, and vowed vengeance if he could but dis¬ cover lum " But dear, my lady,' she continued, " what do you think Nicolai says'— o3
126
why, that he thinks the knight did right, for that, to his certain know¬ ledge, the wood was haunted that night by evil spirits, and he has so frightened me, that I would not go into it, except at broad day light, for all the world And then he told me that the prettiest walks were in the orange grove, and that there we might walk in safety, and he said, moreover, if I wanted to speak with him, that was the place and to say the truth, I was half affronted with him for supposing I should want to speak to him And then he told me there were friends ra the neighboui hood, who would assist me if I wanted their help At that I did laugh out¬ right, for he looked half asleep as he said all this, and then he was angry with me for asking him, if he were dreaming ' I said I should tell you, and he replied, Ay, with all my heart, so much the better adding, your lady has
127
some sense in her composition, but you have none —and then I left him in a huff" Gertrude was unusually thoughtful, and several times asked Jane, " if she were sure he had said all that? ' " Yes, my lady, quite sure, ' replied Jane " Be exceedingly particular in re membenng all he shall say to you ш future resumed her mistress, " that you may relate it to me word for word, —for then, Jane, you need fear nothing, as I shall not allow him to affront you, and really his conversation is very amusing ' " No, my lady, so I said, replied Jane, drawing herself up, " says I, my lady will not, I am sure, allow her waiting woman to be affronted " In the evening, Gertrude bade Jane accompany her into the orange grove, scarcely doubting but she should tliere see Nicolai and although she had о 4
128
hitherto received but small proofs of at¬ tachment or fidelity from lnm, yet, m her present perilous situation, she re solved to trust him, the more so, as she conceived she owed her late preservation to his interference She had walked for some time, and was on the point of re turning to the castle, when a boy about nme years of age, who was in the ser vice of the Count, approached towards her running, then stopping suddenly, he bowed profoundly, presenting at the same time a folded parchment, saying, ' Lady, Nicolai desired I would give you this letter, which you dropped yonder ' With some agitation and enmson checks she took it, thanking the lad foi his honesty " Ah, deai lady, replied the lad, ' I am uevei so happy as when I can approach fan ladies I wish, ' hi added with a sigh, I wish I were л page Pages aie so happy and if 1 were yours, lady, then I might kw»
129
your fair hand Oh I would treasure that kiss as the page does who was bound for the Holy Land, but is «till in Italy " Tliere, you silly boy," said Ger trude^cxtendmg her hand to him, which he piessed to his lips , " let that say, I undei sland all your fine speeches But pooi Jane, have you nothing to say to her' —" There is my hand too, ex ilaimcd Jane, and imitating precisely lhe manner of her lady but the page did not put it to his lips, and Jane with diew it hastily, while the boy, with an arch smile, s ud, ' 1 have never been л page but once, and then I kissed the fairest hand in the world I eould not, would not kiss ouglit but it—no, not for all the treasure in the world " Go, go, said Gertrude, smiling " go, Hyppolito, you must learn betti ι manuel» Hyppolito bowed, and was out of sight in a moment Nicolai w as seen in the о 5
130
d ы ta»ce, but this circumstance wa-f usual« for whenever Gertrude walked, he was always seen wandering about, and this he did by his lady's orders, who feared Gertrude might some day effect hef escape if she were left without a watch upon her actions. When Gertrude w,as alone, bhe opened the parchment, which Hyppohto had given her, and read the following words With feelings of the moat profound respect Lord Edward Saltoun dares to address himself to the lady Gertrude, with the most ardent hopes for liei happiness and peace. He is well aware that she entertains the most unfavourable opinion of him, from the impression made upon her ingenuous mind by his appearance at her chamber door But, as she is well acquamted with the subtle artifices of Father Kupert, he trusts he shall not lack opportunity to prove to her, for whose dear sake he would traverse all the known parts of the world, where danger most awaited him, that he is not deserving the scorn she justly cast upon him, when he, trembling with con¬ tending feelings, beheld her rise superior to the threats of Father Rupert But there is a fact, perhaps, he can communicate
131
at some future period, which shall prove his truth, his honour, his sincerity. He would say more: but, till he has given proof of worthiness, he is dumb upon a subject which his very existence hangs upon. Certain intelligence of the origin of the lady Gertrude has been communicated to Lord Edward, but till he can bring forward those who have a right to claim her, hc dare say no more. Messengers are, however, despatched to them. Let no entreaties prevail upon her to quit tho castlo The hour of deliverance is at hand ; Jane is affectionate but simple, trust her not more than ts necessary, Father Rupert can frighten her mto any thing. Nicolai and the Page are faithful and discreet. The perusal of this epistle, so interest¬ ing to Gertrude, occupied some time, for she was compelled repeatedly to pause ; the sensations it produced were so various and so opposite, that her bosom at one time beat high with hope, and now was chilled by despair. For although assistance was promised her, yet the dangers which seemed to beset her appeared so great, being unknown, that hope fled, and her situation assumed all the appearance of overwhelming 06
132
misery —the latter pait of the epistli, which held out the hope that there were beings in the world who would and could protect her, convey *d to her heart a feeling of delight she lud never yet experienced, but still she vas so sui rounded by enemies, and hır friends were so far distant, that the glov which had kindled her fine countenance fled, and left it so pale and wan, that she more resembled a marble statue than a living being Lord Edward, though he had not mentioned love, had contrived to insinuate its existence, and after ma turely pondering upon the crafty dispo¬ sition of Father Rupert, she felt, though she would not quite allow it, that the English knight was brave and noble,— handsome too and courteous , nay, more than all these—dear to her Yet she would have repelled this charge, had it been made against her, for, in those days of chivalry, where was the damsel who would have owned so much, until
133
her knight had proved by deeds of arms, by patient, unrepming servitude, that the lady of his love was fair and match less beyond all other dames—however high their great degree' But that he loved her, that she would admit,—every woid of Ins letter told her so—every look dunng their short tourney together had declared it, and now that she would trust herself to think upon the subject, she discovered innumerable traits which lonfirmed all she wished When Jane enteied, she found hei lady in a complete state of abstraction th 1 foimer had, howevei, a great deal to communicate, and without heeding the vacant look of Gertrude as she seen ed to listen to her, she began her tale thus — " Do you know, my lady, that there is to bo a fete to night, and then to morrow we are all going to Milan—to my lady s brother, the Count Fiescati, and there aie to bc tilts and tournaments
IU
anıl such grand doings ; and my lady is better to-night, and is expected to join the company in the saloon, where there will be a concert. You are to dress, my lady, and take your lute with you."— Gertrude heeded not the observations of Jane, and the waiting woman was obliged to repeat her story ; for she found that her mistress had actually been so engrossed by her own thoughts, that she had not heard a word of all that passed : when, however, she under¬ stood that they were going to Milan, she felt a sickness of heart which de¬ prived her of speech. "Dear! mylady," said Jane, terrified at the pallid looks of her mistress ; " do not faint. Why, I thought such glad tidings would revive your spirits ; I am sure I like a tourna¬ ment better than any other amusement in the world." " To-morrow!" repeated Gertrude— " to-morrow! to Milan—I cannot—can¬ not go."
135
" Not go, my lady, ' exclaimed Jane , " why what will you do' ' ' I know not,' replied Gertrude, with a look of despair, " but certain it is I will not quit this castle if I can possibly avoid it ' At this moment the Count entered, and, first inquiring how Gertrude did, he secondly proceeded to bid her pre pare for the concert—and thirdly ex plained to her their future plans To the expedition to Milan, Gertrude ventured to object, and also to entreat she might be permitted to pass the time of their absence ш the seclusion of the neighbouring eonvent The Count looked at her for some minutes with the utmost astonishment, then, assuming an expression of toun tenance which had been formerly very common to lum, he said, " I did not, Gertrude, expect you would make ob jections to accompany me any where, but your opinion upon the subject was
136
not asked—you are commanded to go, and I expect that on the morrow you will be ready to attend us. This is in¬ deed a caprice I was not prepared for, al¬ though the Countess has more than once endeavoured to convince me that you were capricious as well as self-willed, I would not heed her insinuations. Let me have no proof of this, or I cease to be your friend. There is but little time for you to prepare for the evening's en¬ tertainment, therefore I leave you." Jane advanced as he· retreated, and in an under voice asked her lady how she could venture to say any thing about not going to Milan? " Question me not," replied Gertrude, " but assist me to dress." Jane obeyed, and her mistress de¬ scended to the saloon in the Venetian dress she had worn at the masquerade, with her lute in her hand. The Count took no notice of her, but she was met in the middle of the apartment by the
137
Countess, who, taking her hand, ob¬ served that " she was sorry that the last evening s entertainment had robbed her of her roses " " But the lilies," interrupted Lord Henry, " agree better with the pensive cast of those soft blue eyes dearest Gertrude,' he added, " indulge us with that Italian air my mother taught you ' Gertrude, with a beatingheart,obeyed, and, taking the nearest seat, she par tially threw back her veil, and with a voice of harmony sang the canzonet Lord Henry had named Her perform ance drew forth great applause, and Lord Henry, stationing himself behind her chair, kept off all interlopers, for there lacked not those among the guests - who admiied our heroine After a short time had elapsed, he invited her to walk on the tenace which ran along one side of the saloon A row of orange and bergamot trees shaded it from the mid day sun, and at the still hour chosen
138
by the Countess and her friends lo en¬ joy the freshness ofthe evening breeze, the moon's full beams could scarcely penetrate the luxuriant foliage. Ger¬ trude could not refuse this invitation, and with a look of exultation hc led her to the terraee. There he poured forth the most ardent professions of love, And sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd, Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again. Yet Gertrude was silent for some time ; at last she collected all her strength, and said, " Cease, my lord, I prithee cease, nor thus distress me by language I cannot answer as you wish." "' Gertrude," resumed Lord Henry, leading her imperceptibly towards the chestnut wood, " why will you thus persist to refuse my love? Know you not you must be mine ? " Never," re¬ plied Gertrude, " will I resign my hand until I have a parent's authority to com¬ mand me."
139
" Gertrude," said Lord Henry, start¬ ing at the fervency of her manner, " are you in your senses ?" " Yes," my lord, " rejoined the now animated girl ; " I am calm and col¬ lected ; and, therefore, to spare yourself the mortification of a denial, and me the pain of refusing your petition, I pray, my lord, you never will repeat your re¬ quest—for here I solemnly declare never to plight my troth to any man, however noble his degree, unless sanctioned by a parent's blessing. No—I will seek some lonely cell, and there end my wretched days. But our absence will excite suspicion ; we will therefore, if you please, return to the saloon." " Nay stay," quickly interrupted Lord Henry ; " you go not yet, Gertrude ; you shall hear me. This idle nonsense, this parade of sentiment, of duty and piety, will not avail." " Let go rny aim, Lord Henry," ex¬ claimed Gertrude, whose high indigna-
140
tion gave her strength " Let go my arm—for shame, my lord—thus to msult a woman—whom you swore when you were made a knight to protect Re member your oath, my lord As she said this, by a sudden exertion she ex tricated her arm from his grasp, and fied with rapidity towards the castle She entered by the house door, and having gained her apartment closed the door, and in an agony of mind not to be de scribed, threw herself on the bed, m vain hoping that tears would bring her some relief, but her heart was too much oppressed to yield the kindly drop^ and she lay thus, her bosom heaving with ronvulsive sobs, till Jane entered her apartment The poor girl was so astonished at seeing her mistress in this condition, that she was leaving the apartment for some help, when Gertrude raising her self, entreated she would stay Jane instantly approached her mistress, and
Hl
by her kind and tender consolations so acted on the nerves and feelings of Ger¬ trude, that tears at length came to her relief " Jane," she said, in broken accents , " Jane, do not leave me, for mercy ь sake do not leave ine, I am very ill, and should not like to die alone " " Die, my dear lady ! ' echoed back Jane " Die '—you sliall not die—a little sleep will refresh you, but what has happened, that you arc thus distressed Oh, heavens ' I hear my lord and lady, do, pray, my dear lady, do pray be com posed heie they are sure enough ' The Count and Countess entered as she spoke, and the former desiring Jane to withdraw, she gladly obeyed and has tened down stairs " Gertrude, said the Count sternly, ' your conduct is that of a wayward, capricious girl, and as such, you shall be m future treated You said you were anxious to pass your hours in the
142
solitude of a cloister. Your wish shall be granted—to-morrow you commence your journey to a convent I have chosen as your asylum, not far from the sacred temple of our Lady of Loretto." " No, no," exclaimed Gertrude ; " let mc remain here—as a prisoner in the closest confinement—in solitude, in fast¬ ing, and in prayer I will pass my days, but let me not quit the castle or its im¬ mediate neighbourhood. I entreat, my lord, you will not compel me ; every hope I have on earth depends upon my residence here." The Count gazed upon her as if he would penetrate her inmost soul as he said, " Gertrude, is it possible that you can be thus inconsistent? Did you not yourself propose a retreat in a cloister? What are your hopes ? your every hope on earth? What vain chimera now oc¬ cupies your thoughts. By my knight¬ hood I now perceive that Father Rupert
143
was just in his opinion, when he said I should me the day I fostcied thee, a snake within my bosom ' Oh let me go then, * resumed Gcr trude, throwing herself at his feet, ' let me go back to England, poor as I am in a pilgrim s dress, I sliall find means to reach my native land " But now your every hope depended upon your residence here, replied the Count, with a sarcastic smile " Oh Gertrude, for shame '—but 111 hear no more At the dawn of day mules will be in readiness to convey you to the convent Foolish girl' thus to trifle with your friend, and force him to resign you, to play the fool with the noble Henry, and then to flee as though he were some rude bandit By my truth girl, my blood boils indignantly against you and I cast you off for ever but not to England, to tell false tales and vilify the characters of those who snatched you from destruction and saved you
14t
from a wretched fate Ungrateful a» you are But I leave you, and at your peril dare to resist my will in future " My lord,' replied Gertrude, my obligations are all cancelled by this charge of mgiatitude " Gertrude, ' said the Countess, with well dissembled kindness, " I dare not intercede for thee at present, but anon I 11 do my best Prepare thou, in the mean while, for thy journey, and I will send Jane to thine assistance Fare thee well, sweet love ' As the Countess concluded, she left Ihe apartment, and Gertrude remained hxed to her seat The entrance of Jane roused her, and she desired her attend ant to make a parcel of those things she sliould want in her intended journey, since she found little reason to hope she should be able to evade its completion

146
the convent in the neighbourhood of Loretto " Most assuredly,' was the reply ' she has by her inconsistency of con duct, disgusted me extremely, and I think it proper, she should bc made to feel that I am no fit subject for her caprice to play upon Yet Angelina, he added, " I am firm m my former resolution respecting her She shall not be compelled to wed my son, if she prefers the solitude of a cloister Where is Father Rupert' he alone shall con duct her to the convent, for I have perceived of late, that much of his opinion concerning this wayward girl, is but too true She has discomposed me more than I can bear —and this journey to Milan, which I had hoped to have shared with her, must now be performed without her My mind is harassed with these fresh and unceasing cares While I perform my pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which I sliall com
147
inence upon my return to Mannelli, she shall remain a hoardei in the convent and then, but it is no matter, stiange events may take place " " Dear · my lord," interrupted the Countess, " talk not thus, we sliall, I tiust, revisit llngland, and once more reign as masters in the proud halls of great Fitzhugh For this wayward girl, heed hei not, she will be weary oí the seclusion of the convent, long ere you leturn, and gladly will accept the ho nour we intend her Think no more ol her, my lord, but retire to rest, the moun tam tops proclaim the approach of day For Gertiude, think not of her, good, my lord, compose your harassed mmd " " Trust me, sweet, I will," replied the Count, and the Countess smiling bade him good night, and repaired to Father Rupert bhe knocked at his door, and the monk, in solemn tones inquired " who was there' the Coun¬ tess paused an instant ere she said, nä
148
" 'Tis I " In an instant the door was opened, and Father Rupert with a lowly lpok, bade her enter. " No, reverend father," said the Countess, " I await you in the saloon." " I follow, daughter," was the reply of the monk ; and the Countess calling her attendants desired they would un¬ close the lattices, and admit the fresh morning breeze." Her orders were obeyed, and the perfume of the rose, the honeysuckle, and the myrtle, intermingled with that of the orange, the citron, and the ber¬ gamot, stole upon her delighted senses. " This is a glorious sight, father," ex¬ claimed Angelina, as she gazed upon the rising sun, and kindling landscape. The monk sighed as he replied, " Yes, lady, it is a glorious sight ; too glorious for me to gaze upon, sinner that I am." Here he paused for some time, and Angelina looked upon him for one
149
instant, then turned her head away, as the monk resumed thus " Would to heaven, lady, I ne'er haa quitted my solitary cell, would to heaven I ne'ei had left the sacred walls of Padua, then I should ne'er have known the misery of guilt ' Again the monk paused, and fixed his piercing eyes upon the Countess he then proceeded thus " I should then have been a stranger to the danger of contemplating Heaven's last, best gift—more glorious far than the bright sun—more dazzling than his noontide beams." " Father," replied Angelina, with some effort, " father, you speak n riddles, which I would not, nay moie dare not solve. Nor," she continued with much animation, " must you in futuie dare to confess to me, who am no priest, the weakness of your nature Nor, as you value my future favour, ex¬ pose to me the secret workings of youi heart If they are guilty, Heaven for-
150
give you, but remember they who sm, knowing they sin, are guilty, I need not say, how deeply guilty ' The monk's blood for one instant rushed to his face, then forsook it, leav¬ ing it only a hue «o livid, that the Countess started back with affright, but what was her surprise vvhen the monk, falling on his knees, and catching her robe, besought her pity Scoin and contempt flashed from her fine dark eye, as she endeavoured to extricate her robe from his grasp " Fa¬ thei," she exclaimed, " is it possible ' Merciful powers' do the heavens not fall and crush thee This to me ' Be¬ gone, 01 instantly I call for those to help me, who will marvel much to see the stern and rigid Father Rupert on his knees to the Countess of Mannelli " The monk sprang from the ground, and darting at liei a look of fiend like exultation which made her tremble slowly entered the saloon, and took his
151
seat at the door through which the Countess must enter that apartment. For some minutes she remained mo¬ tionless on the spot where the father had left her; the fatal conviction that she was wholly in his power produced a faintness which ran shivering through her frame. " What will become of me ? ' were the first words she uttered. " Oh that I could recall even the last twelve months." A heavy sigh followed this apostrophe. Yet the urgencies of the case called for immediate action ; some line of conduct it was absolutely neces¬ sary instantly to decide upon. All which offered themselves to her imagi¬ nation were fraught with danger, and she remained so long ruminating that Father Rupert's patience was exhausted. Besides which, he feared this long de¬ bate with herself argued more of virtue than he had imagined she possessed. He therefore resolved on quitting the saloon, and by closing the door violently
152
he flattered himself he should rouse the Countess from hcr reverie, without ap pearmg intentionally to interrupt hei This little stratagem had the desired effect, the violence with which he closed the door alarmed her " Oh, heavens · she exclaimed, " he must not quit the castle thus, I must dissemble, down, proud heart, back, back, ye scalding tears , tlus is no time for woman s weak ness , I must be great and commanding in that villain's eyes ' As she con eluded this short speech she hastily entered the saloon, and hurried across it, opening the opposite door to that by which she had entered Her step was quick and light, and the father, who had stationed himself on the outside, was startled as she opened it A flush passed across his sallow countenance, but he soon regained his composuie ' Father, said the Countess, " I bave a lequest to make fiom my lord it is his pleasure that Gertrude should he
153
conveyed to the convent near Loretto, there to remain till his return from Milan, when she is to be united to our son if she consents willingly—if not, he intends sending her to England, and wholly himself to relinquish all idea ot leturnmg to his native land Gertrude will then be restored to her friends , but as he has this alliance much at heart, he is anxious she should be impiesscd with the idea, that the seclusion of that convent will be her future resting place, if she persists in refusing compliance to our wishes My lord has chosen you as her conductor thither, and we will delay our journey to Milan, that you may accompany us thither The cai duml my cousin, and the inquisito! general, will be the guests of Count Kiescati during our stay " Daughteı, resumed the monk, ' I am born but to obey your sovereign eominands I shall accompany the lady и 5
154
Geitrude, if such ıs your pleasure, and shall regulate my conduct so as to claim your future approbation " The monk did not raise his eyes during this speech, and the Countess, pretending to undei stand it as a sort of apology, extended her hand to lum, saying at the same time, " I am sure thou wilt, good fa ther, and thou mayest depend upon my warmest interest with my noble rela tives for thy promotion " In haste she left him, and the monk retaining for some minutes after her departure his lowly posture, might to a casual observer, have been depicted a» a fit subject foi a personification of hu mility , but a short degree of patience in waiting for the moment when he slowly regained his erect posture, and threw back his cowl, would have con vinced the spectatorthat humility formed no part of Father Rupert s character in which plıcıty, dupnde, ambition, and
155
passions of no less force and power, though less seldom called into action, formed the component parts " So,' he said to himself, " this lovely Countess, whose noble daring, whose ambitious spirit and commanding form first taught my heart to yield to love, thinks she has quenched the flame by this same haughty coldness But, by lieaven, she did but fan tha* flame, and when her sparkling eye met mine, she looked a perfect divinity A\, Ange¬ lina, thou art, thou must be mine, I am thy evil genius, thou art encircled by my toils, and ere I quit the chase, thou must lose thy soul subduing charms, and I the power of feeling them but soft whom have we here' the foolish, weak, repentant lord, of this same noble woman It is well I wear a cowl, for ill could my speaking eyes conceal the deep contempt, the maddening jealousy I feel when he is nigh " lhe Count had not retired to bed, h6

but merely thrown himself down in his clothes, and unable to sleep, he rose, intending to enjoy the fragrance of the morning He was met by tho Countess who, without appearing to dictate to him, gave him the cast of mmd she wished, if perchance he should meet Father Rupert This meeting, how evei, with the father at that season, sur pi ised him, and for a time changed his intentions, tor he immediately entered upon the subject neaiest to his thoughts —the departure of Gertrude His communication corresponded en tirely with that of the Countess, and the monk, who had thought the latter did but intend to intimate to him, that the powei he flatteied himself he had over her was not so great as he had ima gined, now began to think, that she was resolved to sacrifice every thing, rathei than second his villanous desires Thb idea was not to bt endured,—and he tould scarcely command himself, so as
157
to listen attentively to the long and tedious conversation of the Count, who again and again repeated his commands, that every attention should be shewn to Gertrude, and that her retiiement wu» not to be ι endci cd unnecessarily dis agreeable to her The monk repeated his assurances, that his wishes should be attended to, and proposed being ıeady to accompany hei, when the sun had passed the meridian They then letired to their respective apartments and the castle was for a few hours the «scene of repose \bout two hours before that hxed toi her departure, Geitrude sent Jane to lequest the Count would favour hei with an interview, but he sent a de eided refusal, and a second message trom her was received by lum with ек piessions of anger Tho Countess how evei, pretended to be moved by her ie peated solicitations, andentered her loom with a kindness of manner which as
158
tonished Gertrude She lamented in pathetic terms, the firmness ofher lord, and trusted that Gertrude would enjoy herself in the convent whither she was going, and which was most romantically situated " Besides which, added the Countess, " the Lady Abbess is my very particular fnend, and she will I am «ure, shew you every attention She has not long arrived in Italy —upon the death of the former Lady Abbess of the retired spot you are about to visit, I interested myself for her and she was glad to re visit her native land for she was for many years in the south of France Good bye, my love Father Rupert will attend you " May not I go with my lady * said Jane, who was heart broken at the thoughts of parting with her mistress The Countess paused,—she would ask her lord if he had any objection Jane waited m the greatest anxiety for her answer, and during the absence of the
159
lady, some one tapped at the door It was Nicolai ' Alas, dear lady! he said, ' I am grieved you are quitting the ca9tle, but whatever happens to you in the cou vent remember this you have fnends who will die to serve you It is parti cularly unfortunate that the knight, who appeared as the crusader, is at this mo ment dangerously ill, and that I must attend my lady to Milan But I re peat,—let not terror nor seventy from your Lady Abbess drive you to despair \11 happens unfortunately,—for if I « press a wish to remain heie I shall confirm suspicions I have already ex eited Yet, lady, if I dare, I could tell you that which concerns you much Gertrude's agitation was so extreme that she could scarcely breathe, as Ni eolal proceeded thus —" You have no Ые friends, lady,—noble relatives ------ but at this moment he heard some one approaching, and leaving his speech
160
unfinished, he hastily left the room, and concealing himself in a small passage which led from the principal corridor, he heard the Countess' voice dismissing Jane " The short time we can be toge ther," said the dissembling Angelina, ' we will be alone, my Gertrude The Count gives you permission, Jane, to accompany your lady As Jane left the room, Nicolai joined hei, and said he wanted to speak with her " Now, says he, " Jane, you must conduct yourself very discreetly,— don t be a fool, but listen to me You must make fnends with some one of the lay sisters wheie you are going, for since you have got the Counts per mission to accompany the lady Gertrude, go you must Heie is a purse of se¬ quins, do not spaie them if you should be distiessed,—but, above all, Jane, be lareful how you speak of my lady Countess and her lord Your life and
161
that of your young lady will greatly depend upon your conduct Do not let them cozen you to betray her, for believe me, Jane, there will soon arrive from England, a gallant knight of high degree, shall liberate your lady, and con vey you both to England, but agam I say, you must be discreet—and, above all, be faithful Father Rupert will use all his influence to terrify you to betray her, but be sure------" " Now, Nicolai, ' interrupted Jane disdainfully,—" I listened very patient ly when you lectured me upon my dis cietion, but I sliall not let you reflect upon my honesty,—I would die to serve the lady Gertrude, and since 1 have been her attendant, I have not been half so terrified at Father Rupert The Holy Virgin protect us,—look where he comes ' Nicolai, said the Father, as he passed them, " I would speak with you
162
Nicolai pressed Jane β, hand, putting his finger on his lip, and following the father into his room, the latter fastened the door, and began thus " Nicolai, I have ever found thee faithful, prudent, vigilant, and apt Dost hear me ' I have a scheme m view shall make thee inde pendent Thou art acquainted with some spirits choice and brave, I have a deed to do which lacks a name " " I am thy trusty slave, replied Nicolai " " I have ever found thee such," re¬ sumed the monk, " and yet------ dost understand » I have a fnend who bears him bravely yet I would that he were silent Now, dost understand me ? Thou wert not wont to be so dull I say I hai e a friend, who stands between me and great advancement He is of some rank,—but then this journey that he is about to take Nicolai started, and the monk changed colour, and, turning suddenly towards Nicolai, he fixed his
163
keen eye upon him, and grasping his arm, he concluded this enigmatical speech thus: " I would have raised thee to great honours, would have made thee rich beyond thy soul's desire ; but thou art dull, and thy soul still startles at a shadow. Yet thus much, let me caution thee ; put a seal upon thy lips, for by my hopes of honour thy life hangs upon my breath; and if thou traverse my deep designs by hinting of my purpoee, look—look to it. Begone, vile slave, I loathe myself that I have named to one so cold and heartless a deed of noble daring. Begone—but beware, Nicolai; thou know'st me yet by halves. To¬ night I commence my journey to the convent—soon sliall I return, and then we travel to Milan, whither thou must attend us." As the father said this he let go the arm of Nicolai, and opening the door, thrust him out; then closed it, and paced the room with hurried steps.
164.
" He shall not be trusted," at length he cried ; " no, by Heaven the villain falters : too well he guessed my mean¬ ing :—fool that I was to trust the slave ; but he must be provided for ; it will not do to let him peep and pace about to blast my high designs. No, no ; let me but lodge this puny girl within the con¬ vent walls, and she is safe ; then shall I quickly return, and watch him close. Alı ! the sun has risen high, the time .glides on, and a few short hours shall make me bring my yet unfinished thoughts to light." As the monk said this, he repaired to the saloon, and there seating himself, awaited the arrival of Gertrude. This conversation between Father Rupert and Nicolai had been partially over¬ heard by Jane, but she had prudence enough to forbear mentioning it even to her mistress, whose sorrows she was unwilling to increase by the disclosure of the villanous conduct of the monk.
165
From this time forth the sight of the father impressed her with more than her former terrors, so much so indeed that she would sometimes appear quite silly ; for, strange as it may appear, one strong expression of terror is laughter, but of so vacant a kind, that the beholders attri¬ bute it to folly. When Jane entered her lady's apart¬ ment she found the Countess engaged in friendly chat with Gertrude; de¬ lighted at having succeeded in sending her victim to lhis particular convent made her complaisant and kind to a surprising degree. At length Jane ar¬ rived to say that the mules were in readiness. " Farewell, my love," said the Countess, " farewell ; bear my kind¬ est wishes to the Lady Abbess. Tell her that in committing the adopted child of my love to her keeping, I commit a sacred deposit. Take your lute, my love, 'twill wile away the lonely hours
166 of solitude Take thou this cross in re membrance of my love ' Gertrude took the cross, and bidding the lady farewell, descended with a heavy heart the spacious staircase She looked on every side for Nicolai, but no one of the household crossed her steps, and besides the father and Jane, she was to have no attendants, except two muleteers as guides At the thresh¬ old of the door she paused and lingered, till the lather s voice, as he addressed her in his usual solemn tone, roused her to action Yet the warning she 'iad leiæived not to quit the castle struck so poweifully upon her imagination, that she burst into tears, and asked " if she could not be permitted to see the Count' " Daughter, said the monk, approach ing her, " I am not used to play the lackey—I yet wait your leisure " " One single instant, father, ' replied
167
Gertrude, as she stepped back into the hall and fled towards the saloon, where she imagined the Count was " Oh if I could but see him he would not ι eluse my earnest prayer Alas · alas ' she cried wringing her hands as she entered the apartment and found it empty, ' hc is not here Oh heavens what will become of me ' ' Hist, lady, hist, said Nicolai Yield to necessity—there is no help at present—I dare not stay, but do not irritate the father and the Countess by further delay He theu disappeared, and with slow steps she again ap pioached the door of entrance, where the Countess seemed to be appeasing the wrath of the monk, who no sooner saw Gertrude than ho took her hand, and without deigning to speak one word led her towards her mule Jane foi lowed her mistress s example, and the Countess again and again repeating her farewells, the party rode slowly along
168
the avenue wrapped in thought When they reached the extremity of the Count s domains, Gertrude looked around, and in one of the trees she saw the page who, pointing to a little distance, she discovered a neat cottage Without knowing why she did so, she immedi ately feigned indisposition, and re quested a draught of cold water As she halted her mule, the page descended, and asked if the lady wanted any thing, as he was sure his master would bc proud to grant assistance to so fair a lady "—" Begone boy, said the monk " A little water, I pray you, father ' ïejoined Gertrude, " a little water, or I faint " The page ran off, and soon returned with a cup containing the pure element, and presenling it on his knee to her, he at the same time slipped a parcel into her hand, and then as hastily returned to the cottage, while our travellers once more resumed their journey

It is impossible to describe the de¬ light with whicli Gertrude, notwith¬ standing her melancholy forbodings, traversed the romantic country through which her journey lay Upon arriving at Loretto, which stands on a bold and commanding eminence.the sun had risen, and she stopped her mule, to gaze upon the extensive view which presented it¬ self on every side Two lofty hills (upon VOL. iv ι
170
which now stand two pretty towns ) weie at that distant time coveied with fine woods partially interrupted, and here and theie а small cot scattered upon then fcathciy sides scaicely dis cerniblc, rose to the north The Apen nines formed л grand outline to the wcsat, while the intermediate country was rich with vineyards olive gardens oiangc and citron groves, occasionally lelieved by the daikei foliage of the oak and lightly waving cj press To the east the blue Adriatic extended its transparent waves, enlivened by innu merable fishing boats, their white sails lefleeting a dazzling brightness, and leaving behind them a silvery and eva nescent track To the south rose Monte Santo, on whose summit stood the con vent, whither Gertrude was bound The fame of the celebrated chapel of our Lady of Loretto was, at this pe nod, at its height The Santissima Casa
171
had been removed from Dalmatia, fust to the spot immediately opposite that part of the Gieek empire, and Irom thence to Loretto Upon its arrival at this place, " Nature is said to have leaped foi joy, and the tall oaks to have bowed themselves The Santissima Casa was afflimeli to be the uliiitital house in which the mothei ot our blessed Saviour lesided at Nazareth lhis mı niellions event took place about one hundred years previous to the penod of our history and this poition of Italy, whicli had been formeily wild and un cultivated, soon became extremely po pulous, for the legend, extraordinary as it was, immediately gained belici , and a pilgrimage to our Lady ot Loretto, was sufficient to procuie the devotee pardon for all his sins, past piesent, and to come Father Rupert therefore staid one day in the holy city, in order to pay his devotions at the celebrated shrine, and
172
Gertrude was permitted to accompany him The wealth and splendour which the altar exhibited, for it blazed with jewels, exceeded all that Gertrude had evei imagined, and with feelings of in descnbable awe, she approached the figure of the Virgin, and with a trem bling hand presented her rosary, which was composed of small gold beads, as an humble offering, pouring at the same tune agreeably to the tenets of the re ligion she professed, a fervent prayer to "theQueenof Heaven forherprotection and support Father Rupert remained a considerable time in the sanctuary but Gertrude, as soon as she had per formed her devotions, retired to give place to the constant succession of pil gnms, who daily, from sun rise to sun set, poured in fiom all parts of the christian world* * The immense treasures, which during so many centuries, and in the midst of so many violent com motions, had escaped the hand oí pillage, even of

On the day following their arrival at Loietto, they repaired to the convent ; the lower part of the mountain upon which it stood, was adorned with vine¬ yards ; but as they ascended, it appeared in all the romantic wildness of uncul¬ tivated nature ; the path was so narrow as to admit but one mule at a time, and so precipitous in different parts that the eye grew giddy as it contemplated the scene below. Nothing could be more grand than the view from its summit, but at the same time, nothing can be conceived more dreary than the convent itself. It was a turreted building, ex¬ tensive but not lofty, surrounded on all sides, except at the entrance, by a high wall, which was built over the irregular parts of the rock, so as to be level at top. the Turks, whose respect foi the " SauriSíima Casa" induced them to spare its riches, were, never¬ theless, seized by Buonaparte, and converted mto money for the support of his army
174
The poUeress.who admitted them,had leached that period of life, when the sunken eye and wrinkled fiont bespeak the days ot youth long gone by She ciossed heiself and bowed her head as the Father gave lur his benedicite — We would speak with the Lady Alı bess, said the monk, " we bear a mes sage for her pi ivate ear from the Coun ttss Mannelli ' Theporteressbowed again, and closing the door, led the way to a small parlour, illumined by a n mow high window Jane looked aghast at the naked walls and comfortless appearance of this apait ment, nor was Gertrude insensible to the dreariness of every thing around her Father Rupert took no notice of them but appeared entirely engrossed by his own thoughts What will not the love of power induce the most haughty spmt to beai Father Rupert, whose restless and ambitious soul knew no rest, sub

i7e
nity of partaking, but she was naturally of an ovcrbeaung disposition, and she could ill brook the slightest tontiol And as it is generally found that the greatest advocates for liberty are more tyiannic than other men, where they have power, so it proved with this unhappy sistei Frances She entered upon her government with the most ex aited f°elings of her own rank and powei, and, as liei predecessor had been a woman of high birth, but of most amiable and indulgent manners, the comparison between the two ladies was greatly to the disadvantage of the latter Her external appearance, which had never been attractive, had gained but little by fasting and other austerities of a monastic lite, and when Gertrude saw her tall thin figure, her long narrow visage, and piercing eye, the curled lip, and fiowmng biow, her heart died within her, and great as was Jane s love
177
for her lady, she almost repented having accompanied her to this dreary convent. The Abbess scarcely deigned to bcndhcr head to the Father; of his companions she took no notice.—" Daughter," said the monk, who felt indignant at the nun's supercilious behaviour to a monk of St. Dominick, and therefore refused her the appellation of mother. " I bring you a lady as boarder. She is sent by the Countess Marinelli." The nun's countenance relaxed at the name of Angelina, and she looked at Gertrude and her attendant. " I would speak to you alone," continued the Father, and the Lady Abbess left the room; but soon returned, ac¬ companied by a nun, who acted as her representative, when indisposition pre¬ vented her fulfilling the duties of her office." " Daughter," said the Abbess ad¬ dressing Gertrude," follow that nun." The unfortunate Gertrude obeyed, as i S
178
did Jane, and as they passed through the long corridors, and up solitary stairs, tears lose to the eyes of both the suan gers In the highest apartment of one of the turrets, the nun left them, and without opening hei lips, closed the door, and departed " My good Jane,' said Gertrude, as soon as she could command herself to speak—" It is not too late Quit this lonely dwelling— there is no necessity for your remaining here, and I trust I shall not be long its inmate Janes feelings were contradictory she dreaded to remain, yet she could not resolve to leave her mistress, and After two or three minutes' silence, du¬ ring winch her colour changed from red to white, and from white to red agam, she burst into tear», and declared " she could not leave her lady, adding— " It will be some consolation to you, my dear lady, to have even a servant to speak to here Oh that the knight
179
Would storm the wall«, and cairy us Jroth away to England— Oli, I shall never be able to go along those daik passaigcs at night—I expected, even by day light, to see a ghost rise througli the pavement But do not weep so— if they will but let us scramble about the mountain, we may still contrive to run away, and see my lady, I can trace the path although it winds so much, wi came along So do not be so melan choly," Gertude endeavoured to smile, and assured Jane that her society would indeed be a great comfort to hci, but again advised her to quit the convent while she had an opportunity Jane however steadily refused, and the ami table contest between them ceased Fathei Uujiert m the mean while was giving sistei Frances the necessary m stiuctions foi her treatment towaids hei guest The Abbess's countenance trigh tened as she perceived she was to have ιό

absolute control over her guest, and she promised to do the Countess s bid ding to the utmost ' 1 expect, re sumed the monk, you will see us soon, and with us ivc shall bring Lord Henry—and I trust by that time you will have subdued the spirit of this haughty girl,—if you find the servant an incumbrance, dismiss her The Father then took his leave, and the Abbess repaired to the apartment of Gertrude " I am come, daughter, to inform you of our mode of life—we rise with the sun—and attend the chapel—we then retire to our cells, and pass the hours till our first scanty meal assembles us, dunng the whole of the day, silence prevails, om meal each day, is all we paitake of, though a small portion is served at morn and eve Meat is not admitted within our walls, and you will be expected, both you and your servant, to share the household work of the convent and m every respect to

183
that cool dignity she could have desired The Count had come on a visit lo the Santissima Casa, and he also resolved to visit the convent, in order to give Ous Abbess strict ordeis io make the ictnemcnt of Gertrude as little uksomi. as might be In his way thither lie had been att icked by banditti, and had ic ceived a wound in his aim, which oblig t d hım to wear it in a sling He inquired anxiously of Gertrude how she did, but « lule he was speaking to her—his own countenance changed, and he com plained of extraordinary pains in his arm So much indeed did they increase, and so much did he appear afftcted by them, that Gertrude urged lnm to have instant assistance By this time tlic arm had swelled to a prodigious size, and the pain was so gieat that ht de clared the dagger from which he had ıeceıved the wound, must have been poisoned Jane turned pale as death—a thousand suspicions darted across her

mmd, and she grasped the arm of Gel trade, and said in under voice, " Father Rupert '— The Count overheard her, and with a sigh lamented the absence ot the monk, but as his pain grew more νιο lent, he begged the Lady Abbess would accommodate him with a lodging The Abbess paused, but Gertrude, whose energetic mind had sunk under the haidships, which had lately fallen to her lot, ivas roused by the danger of the Count, and so alarmed at the speech of Jane, that she did not hesitate to urge tlmt he should occupy her own apart¬ ment, saying, that ' she little cared where she herself was placed One of the Count s attendants was despatched to Loretto, and a handsome present was also sent to the priests who guarded the Holy Shrine, to put up prayers for the Count Marmelli's reco very Gertiude, in the meanwhile, opened the sleeve and bathed the wound

Gertrude, his mece, whom he would re store to her parents When Gertrade opened her eyes, she passed her hand across her forehead, fixed her eyes upon the Count, antl asked eagerly, " Was it—was it a dream ' or is it true, that------1 am indeed the daughter of Richard Ravenspur—trans sporting thought ι Oh, my lord, —she waved her hand and smiled My uncle · Oh this is too much happiness · Jane, did you hear ' I am daughteı of the matchless Richard Ravenspur and the Lady Geraldine But my deai, deal uncle,—you—you—look very pale, and your hand is cold, Jane, call in the monk Oh, gracious Heaven, spare lnm—spare him!' The monk entered as she spoke, and in haste administered the extreme unction to the now dying Count The latter looked wistfully at his niece, who, kneeling by his side, wept upon his clay cold hand as she pressed it to her bosom Once she
1S9 would have spoken, but his look stop¬ ped her. While he was collected he fixed his eyes upon her ; and when the insensibility preceding deatli had glazed them, she still imagined they looked with anxious tenderness upon her. The priest, however, having less feeling, and therefore more discrimination, ap¬ proached and gently laid his hand upon the Count's eyes, then she started from her kneeling position and fled to her own apartment, followed by Jane. Her indisposition, whicli the danger of the Count had banished from her mind— being principally nervous, now returned with increased force, and ere the night set in, she was in a violent fever, and accompanied by delirium, which so ter¬ rified Jane, that one of the sisters re¬ lieved poor Jane by her presence from those terrors which threatened her in¬ tellects also. The variety of events which had taken place in the last few hours, were more then her mind could
190
thoroughly comprehend, and the wild ravings of Gertrude, who alternately called upon her father, mother, uncle, and Father Rupert and the Countess, tei rified her so much, that she declaied hei mistress was mad, to speak so dis lespcctfully of the two latter But when Gertrude, in a soft voice, called upon hei mother to bless her, when she stietchcd out her aims, as if to embrace that being whom she had always ho nouied, although she was personally unknown to her, when she prayed heaven to forgive Henry Lord Raven spur all the woes he had biought upon her house, Jane could no longer cou tain herself— L " We shall all be killed, said she, " if my poor lady talks thus " Why, ' replied the nun, " if tin Lady Gertrude speaks under the deli num of fever, who will take anj notice of what she ьаув ' '— " \h, but,' replied Jane, " sho does not—she speaks the truth—for the Lord
191
Henry Ravenspur —I mean the Count Mannelli told hei all this in my hear ing,—and if the Countess knows it— heaven help us I say ' " My good Jane," interrupted the nun, " let me advise you to set a guard upon your own lips, for unless you are moie cautious, you will accelerate the misfortunes jou so justly dread, I will watch by the Lady Gertrude— whilst you may rest in my cell, Tiust ine, Jane, I may bc able to assist you m your present extremity, and your lady as well She is a beautiful and interesting creature, and believe mc, I shall do all I can to promote hcr com¬ fort and recovery, and now go and lay down awhile The Lady Abbess has been on her knees ever since the Lady Gertrude insisted that the Count should uot be moved She trembles foi the sanctity of her house, and I fear your mistress will feel the effects of hei dis¬ pleasure ere long"—
192
Jane hesitated at first, but at length complied with the nun's urgent entrea¬ ties, who took her seat by the bed-side of Gertrude, and watched with anxiety the convulsive movements of the unfor¬ tunate girl, and listened with senti¬ ments of real commiseration to her alternate expressions of supplication, terror, scorn, and entreaty, as she ap- peared at times to address different persons which escaped her parched lips. Her dismay however may be ima¬ gined when Gertrude—said—" Poi¬ soned ! Father Rupert !—Oh, oh—it is impossible, he dares not!—Yet—he looks as if"—A heavy sigh prevented the conclusion of this speech, and she then added, " Marry Lord Henry! never, never—no power on earth;— yes, there is one person has a right— Ah—well, now I will think no more upon't—I'll sleep again"— The nun sat in silent trembling, lost any one should enter the apartment,
193 and overhear these unconnected but sig¬ nificant speeches; and she was delighted beyond measure, when the poor inva¬ lid's senses appeared to sleep. At sun¬ set the Abbess entered. She started at seeing the nun, who said it being her turn to nurse the sick, she had taken upon herself the office of nurse to the Lady Gertrude, Jane being worn out with fatigue and watching. " The Count is dead," observed the Abbess, crossing herself, " and Heaven rest his soul ; the body will be removed to Loretto at midnight. The peace of our convent has been terribly disturbed by the arrival of this Lady Gertrude. I trust the Countess will consider that I am sole mistress within these walls, and that I shall hold myself responsible; to no one for my treatment of any living within them. You will leave this guest of ours to her slumbers; she appears really to h«tve forgotten all her Pfe- VOL. iv. к

tended grief, for she sleeps as sweetly as the new-born infant." At this moment a groan burst from Gertrude's bosom, as she repeated with a shudder, " Poisoned! No, he dare not. Yet he dare do that would make a brave man tremble." The nun in truth trembled as the Lady Abbess asked her " What Gertrude meant by talking thus?" " Reverend mother," replied the nun, " she is delirious, and her slumbers are disturbed ; the quiet rest of one good night will restore her to her usual health. But you yourself look much fatigued ; let me advise you to retire." " Not till the Count's body is re¬ moved," returned the Abbess. " I can¬ not rest till then—I shall Visit you again at midnight." With heartfelt joy the nun saw her depart as Gertrude gave symptoms of Waking, and at length opened her eyes.
195
She looked earnestly at her companion, then her eyes wandered round the room, and the nun instantly guessing what she meant, said, " Jane was weary, I have sent her to my cell, but will call hcr if you wish it." *' No," replied Gertrude, closing hci eyes and sighing deeply ; " no, I do not want her." She then appeared to be collecting her thoughts, and after some little time she spoke connectedly and rationally upon the late events, and looking earnestly in the nun's face, she asked, " when the body was to be re¬ moved?" " To-night," replied the nun ; " the Lady Abbess has given orders for it to be carried to Loretto, there to remain till the Conntess shall arrive at that place and direct its future destination." Gertrude again mused, and then, look¬ ing earnestly at the nun, she said, " No one will, I trust, see Jane just at pre¬ sent, for she is but ill fitted to contend
196
with the wily, and I fear that if she meet with Father Rupert, sho will be betrayed mto some imprudence Could I see her' " Assuredly, said the nun , " I will fetch her Jane had sunk into a deep sleep, but she instantly roused at hearing her lady vv anted her, and expressed much joy at finding Gertrude in ker right senses In a few words, foi the time was short, Gertrude urged the necessity of Jane s immediate departure " Go with the body of the Count, she added thou wilt more assist me by finding out Nicolai than by remaining here Tell lum all that passed avoid meeting with Father Rupert, or we shall both be un done Fear not for me, I shall not remain heie long Be entirely guided by Ni colai Say that I desired this and now my good girl, begone Do not weep— God and his holy angels guard thee I have nought to give thee, wench, to

Shakscease. As soon as Father Rupert had left Gertrude in the convent, he repaired to Ancona, a town about fourteen miles north of Loretto. There, by large bribes, he hired two assassins, a custom not at all uncommon at that distant period, and desired them to secrete themselves in the neighbourhood of Ma¬ rinelli. The resolution the Count had suddenly embraced during the absence of the monk of visiting the chapel of our Lady of Loretto, favoured Father
199
Rupert's iniquitous design ; and, feign¬ ing an obligation to visit his convent, he hastened to the villains and gave them their instructions, presenting each of them at the same time with a poniard dipped in a most subtle poison. Him¬ self, to avoid suspicion, then did repair to his convent, and there remained waiting with the greatest anxiety for the success of his plans. When Mari¬ nelli quitted his castle, he was attended by so large a retinue, that the assassins found it would be useless to make any attempt upon his person: they, there¬ fore, proceeded towards Loretto, where they hoped the Count would, as was very usual upon such occasions, dismiss his train and approach Loretto on foot with few attendants. They judged rightly; for the Count halted within about two miles of Loretto, and bade his attendants wait some little time, so as to enter the holy town after him. He had not proceeded far, when the . ___ ai
200
ruffians stole from their secret place, being attired like countrymen, their ap pearance excited no suspicion The Count s two servants preceded hım one of the pretended countrymen held out his hat foi alms, and begged " in the namt of oui Lady of Loretto upon a pil grimage to the Santissima Casa, this plea was irresistible, and while the Count was searching for the means of gratify mg his requP4t, the second villain aimed a blow at his heart, he missed his aim, yet they both fled, foi the monk had assured them ' a scratch was sufficient The Count conceiving his wound slight took but little heed of it, yet his at tendants were alarmed, and entreated he would allow thcni to go back for his carriage he yielded to their request and entered Loretto as already de scribed The ruffians then hastened from the spot, and changini; their dress foi one be speaking greater poverty, journeyed to
201
the convent of Father Rupert, and ap peared at the gate as two of the mendi¬ cants who daily received food fiom the brothers of St Dominick The monk, who was daily expecting them, soon recognised them " The deed is done, said one of them Father Rupert re turned a significant glance, and with¬ drew to his cell, in which he had con. cealed money and jewels to a consider able amount these were the savings of vanous expeditions performed for the Countess, for which she had liberally supplied him, and which he had as caie fully expended, so that much remained in his own hands Having retuined to the gate, he gave one of the men a bag, " Containing," as he said, " bread he had saved from his own small pit tance ' With a profound bow, and many thanks, the villains departed, and Fa ther Rupert returned to his cell, waiting for further intelligence upon the con k5

elusion of an event which had begun so prosperously On the following day a courier arrived fiom the Countess, com mandmg him to hasten to Loretto, with all diligence, whither slie was already gone, and also to communicate to lum the paiticulars of the late melancholy catastrophe, and her apprehensions that she should not see her lord alrø again The monk feigned the utmost aston>«ft ment, grief, and horror, at this intelli gence, and hastened with extraordinary speed to Loretto, where he found the Countess in real affliction Angelina could not but remember the devoted attachment of her late lord, and although she had never felt the same warmth of afiection for him, yet now that he was no more she regretted his loss with tears of anguish The sight of Father Rupert added an indescribable sensation to her grief, it was not fear, properly speaking, but ıtbordered closely upon it The monk s conduct was, how
sos
ever, respectful and consoling ; but the arrival of her son, now assuming the title of Count Marinelli, produced a re¬ novation of that grief which had sub¬ sided a little. Lord Henry had ever shewn the most independent spirit: his haughty soul had spurned control, and great as was the Countess's affection for this her only child, she could not be blind to his faults; faults which threatened her peace, now that he was no longer under restraint from a father. It is true he loved his mother, but he had never been taught to expiess that affection by relinquishing his «own will to hers ; his shewed itself in bursts of feeling, not in that composed, uniform and watchful fashion, which sweetens the bitterness of those sorrows, which ail are doomed to taste while travelling through this world of woe. For him she had lived, for him she had sacrificed peace of mind, and the conviction that he was k6
204 too selfish in his disposition duly to ap precíate her warmth of affection, shot a pang to her heart The world too, whicli she had idolized, began to lose its charms, from its insufficiency to yield her relief in her present affliction Amidst the numerous friends who had partaken of her bounty, who had shared her gaieties, few now approached her, and of all the persons whom she had ever known, Gertrude alone presented herself, as one who could and ivould sympathize with her sorrows, forgetting at such a moment all her formei înpiries To her therefore she resolved to send, but this resolution was not carried into effect till nearly a week had elapsed after the death of the Count When her messenger returned he brought the alarming intelligence, that a person had amved at the convent, bearing a letter from the Countess of Mannelli, desiring Gertrude might be intrusted to him in order to convey her to Loretto
205
" Not there ' gone '' exclaimed the Countess, starting from her se.it— " Whose work is this'—Ah' said Father Rupert, who was present when this message was received by tlu Countess and her son— ' Is it so ' ex cuse me, lady, I suspect that, that same knight, who apjieared at the mas querade is, at the bottom of this plot— but fear not you, I shall soon unravel it, the plans of a boy are soon outwitted by a man " As the monk said this he left tin apartment, and hurrying to the convent he found this intelligence perfectly coirect Then was, however no need for this journey, Gertrude, he well knew, was crossing the Apennines, flat tering heiself she should shortly return to England, for Nicolai was with her, and Jane also Father Rupert had suspected Nicolai for some time past, and in order tho roughly to understand him, he feigned
206
something like contrition for his past conduct towards the Lady Geitrude, and then caught back his worde, as if fearful he had said too mueh " Truly, father, replied Nicolai, " We may well feel contrition, and since you say as much, I must confess I do repent me of the evil I have brought upon her But it is not too late, if you will but trust me, I will make her ample amends for all she has suffered on our ac count I will contrive to remove her fiom the convent, but you must swear, holy father, upon the cross, not to betray me to the Countess or Lord Henry " I swear, said the monk, " and intrust this affair to you Take her to the vicinity of Florence, and Jane with her In the vale of Arno, you will find a re tired spot about one mile from Florence there remain till we can meet and fix the plan for her return to England Nicolai deceived by the open frankness of the
207
lather, instantly repaired to the convent On his way thither, he stopped at a cottage in the neighbourhood, and, to his suipnse he there saw Jane She was equally surprised and no less pleased at seeing him, and greatly did she re joice at so fortunate a circumstance, for she had been greatly puzzled as to her future proceedings She therefore told him all she knew, all she had heard, andali she had fancied about the Count - death Nicolai was lost for a time in thought, he made no reply to Jane, ex cept to caution her against repeating what he chose tp call ' idle tales not that he considered tliem such, for his fears met hers , yet he deemed it pru¬ dent to combat them, foi he had little faith in her discretion Having therefore endeavoured to impress pon her mind, the great power ofFather Rupert's order he left her, bidding her wait patiently there till his return " I shall be back,' he added, " in the morning, and Jane,
208
I beg you will not leave the cottage till you see me " He then approached the cottager, and asked him if he could puichase three stout mules, saying he would give good price for them, provided they were strong " But I want them by to-morrow, friend, if you could accommo date me There is some money in advance, to shew you I do not mean to cheat you " The countryman prombed to procure them, and Nicolai wrapping himself in his cloak began to ascend the rock He arrived at day-break at the convent gate, where he delivered a letter as from the Countess, desiring " that the Lady Gertrude might accom pany the bearer ' The Abbess looked at the signature again and again, ques tioned Nicolai closely as to who he was, &c To all of which he replied with much apparent sincerity " But where are the mules, said the Abbess, " the lady cannot walk ' —" They are
209
stationed below, ' was the reply, " and I will trouble you to tell the Lady Gtr trude, that as her absence will be short, she need only bring those things which are least cumberous Tell her if you please, also, that Nicolai waits for her, and that the Countess is sadly afflicted and needs her consolation ' Gertrude s colour assumed a crimson hue, as the nun despatched by the Abbess, to give her this information, mentioned Nicolai, a hope sprang in her mind, that the Countess was igno rant of her departure, and more parti¬ cularly was this confirmed by the mes sago respecting what she should bung with her Of the nun, who had shewn her much kindness, she took an affec tionate leave, yet she dared not give vent to her feelings, but her eyes spoke moie than the nun could comprehend, although she flattered herself that their expression boded good The Abbess was not sorry to part
210
with Gertrude, for since her arrival, so many circumstances had occurred to interrupt the regular routine of her convent, and to divert the nuns mmds from more sacred duties, that her de parture was hailed by the Abbess as the signal for that monotonous calm she so much delighted in, and which she so rigidly imposed upon her nuns In silence Gertrude accompanied Ni¬ colai, for the latter never unclosed his lips, except to point out any part of the descent, which called for particular caution When, however, they reached the plain, he said, " he hoped she was not weary, for they had a long journey to perform before sun set ' Whither am I going, Nicolai '' she inquiied anxiously " That, lady, you must not know just yet, but I have a companion for you, whom you will be glad to see She waits your coming in yonder cottage But it is absolutely necessary that she should be deeply
211
impressed with the danger» of our situ¬ ation, and be commanded by you to suppress her garrulous propensity I will go in first, lest by her thoughtless joy, she betray us " Nicolai lost no time in entering the cottage, and having inquired for the ownei, " There he is," said Jane, " leading three mules Am I going to leave this place Nicolai, for I cannot fancy myself in safety so near the con vent, and so near Loretto " Hold your tongue, wench, ' replied Nicolai, " I have news for you, the Lady Ger¬ trude waits without ' " The Holy Vngin be praised, ex claimed Jane, " where is she Nicolai was obliged to be veiy im perative with Jane, and positively for bade her to speak one word more, " if ' said he, " you cannot be a little quiet, and rational, I shall leave you behind ' Jane put her finger upon her lips,
ai2 and Nicolai went to fetch Gertrude, who, after partaking of a heaity break fast, set off in the company of these two attendants, her heart light and buoyant, for ahe felt assured that she was not bound for Mannelli Nicolai had well arranged his plans, and they arrived without any interruption at the place of their destination, where Nicolai un folded to Gertrude, the plans of Father Rupert and himself in liei favour ' As however," he continued, " Jane has excited some fears respecting the sm centy of the monk, I shall immediately have one more meeting with him For without his assistance, we can reach En¿land Yet as, these Dominican friars, are powerful in England, as well as Italy, I do not wish to break off all connexion with Father Rupert, till you are in more potent hands than mine Here you are safe,—wait for my return, but be prepared at a minute s notice to resume your journey if re
213
quired Farewell, lady, for the pre sent A lovely retired spot was chosen as the retreat jf Gertrude and Jane, during his absence, and Nicolai having taken leave of the owner of the cottage re turned to the castle, where the Countess, her son, and the monk, arrived shortly after him with the body of the late Count preparations were making agree ably to the desire he had always ex pressed to that effect, to convey it to England In the course of this week Father Rupert was so occupied that Nicolai could not obtain an audience, and he at length became uneasy at the studied manner in which the father avoided him He therefore resolved to leave Mannelli immediately, and was hasten ing through the grounds for that pur pose when the monk met him " Nicolai, said tho father, " you are the very person I wished to speak
2U
with: return with me to the orange- grove: there we shall be sure of no interruption. I wish to ask you a few questions respecting the inhabitant of a cottage at no very great distance. Who is he, and is he there still ? and who is that boy who used to haunt this grove, and play the fool with the Lady Gertrude ?" " He was a stranger," replied Nicolai, whose fear of Father Rupert's insince¬ rity was excited by these questions, and they taught him prudence ; " anil he lives there still as I believe, as for the boy, you must ask the gardener about him. But I have more important subjects to discuss. The Lady Ger¬ trude is safe in Tuscany, at a cottage atout a mile from Florence, and I am come to propose that we should join the cavalcade attending upon my late lord's funeral; tlie lady's departure would then be safe, and more—it would be respectable."
215
' Who would be the fool then '" said the monk, grasping Nicolai by the arm and blowing a whistle, but Nicolai was the stronger man, and m the scuffie which ensued he threw the monk to the ground, and ere Lord Henry and his attendants reached the spot, Nicolai had cleared the orange grove, and with a rapidity to which they were unequal fled, and eluded all pursuit Father Rupert na" stunned by the fall, and m this state he was carried into the house, while Nicolai resting neither day nor night pursued his way to Tuscany Life and death were at stake, for he could expect no mercy, he had attacked a Dominican iu&i and a member of the Holy Inquisition Upon arriving at the cottage, Gertrude was alarmed at his exhausted state, the more so when he described their united danger Their host was a kind hearted man, and m such a cause he exerted himself so much to their advantage, that they
216
were conveyed to Civita Vecchia as relatives of his own, and safely put on board a vessel bound for Marseilles. Civita Vecchia was not the nearest sea¬ port, but they concluded, that Father Rupert would lcpair to Τ " ^оги pursuit of them. Having ii« ■- Gertrude bejrond his pursuit, and in a state of comparative safety, we must return to the monk, who was no sooner recovered from his stupor, than he de¬ clared to the Countess and her son the treachery of Nicolai, which was con¬ firmed by the attack or rather defence of the latter against the monk. Lord Henry, accompanied by two companions appointed by the monk, left the castle immediately and made sure of his vic¬ tim : he easily discovered the nest, but the prey had flown away. In a rage he despatched a courier to the monk, who expressed no less indig¬ nation than the young Count. Yet he dissembled his feelings, treated the
217
Counts disappointment lightly, and assured the Countess and her son, he would soon ıelıeve them from all anxiety on account of Gertrude The Countess in the mean while lost both health and spirits, she passed hci days in the oiatory belonging to her own chamber, and appeared disgusted with the world entirely Father Rupert never intiuded himself upon hei pn vacy, and behaved upon all occasions with the most profound respect towards her Yet to her discriminating eye, the father assumed more than his office authorized, the tone of master, and instead of repairing to the chapel of her castle to confession, she visited the neighbouring convent, and as a pnvate individual enjoyed the really pious ex hortations of the father confessor of the holy community Her mind w<is torn with painful recollections, yet she had never courage to unfold to this father the secret of Gertrude's birth, "." IV Τ
218
ulthough it weighed heavily on her heart; and one day after her return from the convent, she sent for her son, and hinted to him, " That she should never be happy until she heard Ger¬ trude was declared daughter of Richard Ravenspur." " Mother," replied the son, " you astonish me bayond all conception. What ! relinquish the probability of re¬ turning to my native land, of inheriting the vast possessions of Fitzhugh ! never, by heavens ;—but to still your consci¬ ence I do not ask your interference. The monk's two emissaries have tracked the fugitives, and discovered their re¬ treat. By heaven, that father is fitted for a kingdom's rule, and I have written to the Cardinal and Inquisitor-General in his behalf. As soon as I have ac¬ complished his advancement, I shall leave you, nor return to Italy, without my bride." " Go not, I conjure you," cried the
210
Countess earnestly, leave me not here alone, I cannot remain at Marinelli without you Accompany me first to Milan, to my brother s Ala», my son, my mmd, weakened by my late mis fortune, cannot endure the solitude which surrounds me here Henry, you will not refuse mc this poor request ' My journey will bc short, good mother invite your friends to Mannelli, and assemble round you the gay and happy Besides, I go not to day, noi yet to morrow, I shall wait the re turn of a courier, I despatched to Milan Surely, you do not fear the castle will be attacked during my absence, your servants are numerous and faithful ' ' " The gay and happy here '" ex claimed the Countess, in a melancholy tone ' alas, Henry, what should they do here' No, no, the house of sonow, is the touch stone of friendship,—But, she continued, after a pause, and assum ing her usual lofty tone, " I forbid you L 2

sickens at the desolation ofthe prospect round me—Gertrude! unhappy Ger¬ trude! where art thou now? Father Rupert, knowest thou aught of Ger¬ trude?" The young Count looked at her with amazement, for her face was crimsoned o'er, her eyes flashed fire, and her curled lip bespoke such indignation as ex¬ ceeded all she had everdisplayed before. Thai monk stood petrified. Had she dared to mention to her son, his pre¬ suming hopes ; no, he felt she would not thus expose him, not for his, but, for her own sake. Yet he was not quite satisfied, and as he addressed her thus, his voide lacked much of its usual firmness. " Daughter, you seem much moved, what has occurred to agitate you thus?" " Thou art my father confessor," re¬ plied the Countess slowly, and dost thou presume to ask the meaning of my words ? My son, I would be alone, Fa·

230 she could weep her former guilt, the pangs she had so unfeelingly inflicted upon the Lady Geraldine, were now returned into her own bosom fourfold, overbearing as was Lord Henry, she thought him a paragon of perfection, both in body and mind She would sit for hours in a little arbour which com manded a view of the public road, watching the approach of all who came to the convent, hoping they brought tidings of her son She became gloomy and silent, and Jaquelina, who had at tended her during all her brighter days when joy and gaiety resounded wherever she appeared, grew weary of this mono tonous life, and longed for their retuin to the cistle, which was to take phce when the young Count and his brido appeared there One day, that the Countess was seated as usual at her little casement, she saw three persons in the distance, advancing at a measured pace, the one preceded

mately connected with his future plans, he ivas anxious the Countess sliould return to the castle He had flattered himself, that she would not have been insensible to the charms of his person, but finding he was mistaken, and burn mg with revenge for the humiliation she had subjected him to, he vowed to bend her haughty spirit to his will, and as he knew the warmth of her at tachmcnt for her son, he was resolved on making him the instrument of his great revenge As soon as he was de¬ parted, the Lady Abbess repaired to the apartment of the Countess, and la mented the necessity which compelled her to solicit she would give orders for her return to the castle ' Most certainly, replied the Coun tess, " we can depart on the instant, we are not wont to be considered an intruder " " Pardon me, dear lady and friend, said the Abbess " we have received
235
command from the Reverend Father Abbot, that we take no more boarders " Indeed, exclaimed the Countess " this then is the cause of my departure I shall remove to morrow " Jaquelina was charmed with the orders of her mistress, and with great glee she packed up her lady's clothes, and longed for the morrow She was up as early as any of the nuns that morning, and thought her lady exceed ingly perverse that she would not rise before her usual hour At lengtii she had the pleasuie of seeing the horses arnve which were to carry her and her lady hack to Mannelli But alas · hci e was no merriment as formerly no guests —no music—no masques, all was si lent and solitary, for the servants ap peaied to have partaken of the gloomi¬ ness of then lady The birds sang as usual m the orange grove, but there was nobody seemed to take pleasure m then song Eight months had now
230
elapsed since the death of the Count, and no certain tidings of the assassin had yet been heard, neither aid the young Count appear The Count Fres cati and his noble and powerful rela tu « s had not been able to force the secret from the villain they had in cus tody,, and the Countess, after being two or three days at Mannelli, suddenly formed the resolution of going to Eng land All now waa bustle and prepara tion; the hangings were taken down, and a courier was despatched to Milan to the Count Frescati, between whom and Father Rupert a great intimacy had commenced This intelligence was re ceived by both these worthies with feelings of surprise " It must not be, said the latter, I will prevent her quit¬ ting Italy, she shall not visit England, my lord trust me, I sliall not leave my work half done I will write to her, and so do you, my lord, mislead her with false hopes of soon seeing her son,
237
whilst I will urge the nnpiopriety of hcr quitting Italy till the murderer of her lord is found " " 'Tıs well," replied the Count, who secretly rejoiced in the absence of his nephew, for, though he ivould have shuddeied at the idea of contributing to his death, he would have been well pleased to have heaid that his bones reposed beneath a cold green turf The courier returned beai ing these letters, but the indignation ofthe Count ess upon receiving them is not to be imagined Frescati, friend of Father Rupert'—inmates of the same house' and they should dare to dictate to her — whither she should go—and where she should remain ' " Insolence unparalleled '" she ex claimed as she lead the last paragraph of Father Rupert's letter, which ran thus " Daughter, farewell We counsel thee not to quit Marinelli until thou shalt hear further from
238
*' Insolent knave ' does he think, she continued, " to play the master, and lord it over me » No, Father Rupert,— no, most reverend Father Abbot, crea ture of my former will—no, thou art mistaken—subject to thee ' Her high indignation almost choaked her, as she paced the room with hurried steps, then applying her silver whistle to her lips, she summoned Jaquelina, and bade her hasten the preparations for her de parture " I would go to morrow, ay to night if twere possible Let no one intrude upon me , I would be alone till the dawn of da), then I shall require j our attendance ' The Countess having said this closed the door of her apartment, and Jaque İma repaired below stairs, declaring she never saw her lady more animated in all her life than she was when she gave orders for her departure " And truly, she added, " I am right glad to see she hae some of her former spirit left I

would rather by halt slit scolded me, than she sliould sit so moping and me lancholy I am sure I began to thmk she meant to turn nun ' " Nun ι ' said the courier, " the hea vens torfend , there ıs my master (that was), the right reverend Abbot, he was as humble as you please while a mere monk, but now ι faith since hc has ev changed the cowl for the cap and his staff for the crosier, he has become so haughty one dare scarcely look at him Depend upont, if she turns nun, she will be Lady Abbess, and woe betide the nuns who fall under her dominion, for at all times she bears herself like a queen ' " And well she may, ' sharply an swered Jaquelina, " she would gain no rank by being an abbess I know, and now its my opinion all abbesses should be women of rank, for then they would need no additional severity to shew they were born and bound to command
240 Places of authority should be filled by those who confer dignity on then situa tion, not by those who derive conse quence from their situation, as is the case with Father Rupert ' " It is well the Right Reverend Ab bot does not hear you," replied her companion, " for l'faith he would shew jou he had rank and power too Piay, Jaquelina, keep your tongue a little under proper subjection, foi feai other people sliould take the liberty of putting your whole person in subnotion But piay, Jaquelina, what did your lady say, which delighted you so much' " That is no business of yours, Mis ter Mentor A woid to thp wise is sufficient I understand your h nts and thank you for them, so good night to you You have too much of a man in you, I should think, to tell tales of a woman, and so, although I have said what I should not sa} , I feel perfectly easy on that score
241
" And so you may," replied the courier, " your confidence and sincerity bind me to you for ever : good night, good Ja¬ quelina." Jaquelina nodded her head, and left the kitchen not quite so much at ease as she pretended, for she knew very well that if Father Rupert had heard but half what she had said, it would go hard with her. She was not, however, one of those persons who dwell upon misfortunes in perspective.and she there¬ fore, after praying to all the saints, and St. Dominick in particular, composed herself to sleep.

When the Countess had closed the door of her apartment, ehe placed her¬ self at her cabinet ; and, having opened several of the drawers, which contained many valuables belonging to her family, she carefully arranged these and en¬ closed '' ?m in different packets, putting labels upon them to distinguish them
243
externally the one from the other. This cabinet centained many secret pluces, the springs of which were known only to herself; in these she deposited the most precious of her jewels. Having done tliis, she next began a letter to the present Earl of Ravenspur, declaring Gertrude to be his child, and lamenting in the strongest language the principal part she had played in her detention, urging at the same time the most forci¬ ble neasons for hex alliance with Lord Henry, now Count of Marinelli, as the means whereby both branches of the noble house of Ravenspur might be gieatly. aggrandized. She had proceeded thus fav »ihen she laid down her pen, and sat musing for some time on the events which had within the last two yeara« taken place in her family, and the diffèrent light in which she appeared in die eyes of the world previous to this penad. A heavy «sigli« »tole from he* besom, «d a tear m S
244
hung on her half-closed eye-lid : slowly she clasped her hands, and fixing her gaze on the picture of a nun which hung immediately opposite to her, she said, " Happy Olivia—beloved sister of my early days ; how did I deride thy choice, when thou didst seclude thyself within a convent's gloom. Ah ! could I have foreseen the toils, the pains, the sor¬ rows, whicli the world I then adored contained, I would have shrouded my¬ self beneath the sable veil as well as thee. Few were thy days—yet thou didst live a saint, and now art one among those thousands, wliich I per¬ haps shall never join. Alas ! alas I ill betide the day which made me choose the Father Rupert for a confessor: he cherished every worldly feeling, while he seemed to check them. But away with vain regrets. Grant me, Heaven, but to embrace niy son once more ; to resign to him this castle ; to see him wedded, if not to Gertrude, at least to
245
»ome other noble dame, and in the neighbouring convent I will end my days The cai'linai will piocure me this poor favour m defiance of Father Rupert ' Indeed' said a voice close to hci, which she instantly lecognised as that of the Right Reveiend Abbot " In deed ' me you so sure of thaf And think you Father Rupert has lost that tact which moulds his superiors to his will, and makes the lowly bow in meek obedience to his supreme commands ' Thinkest thou, lady, my dignity ot Ab¬ bot has chilled my quick perceptions' Tlunkest thou my game is played ? Ii so, thou art mistaken I will be cardinal, lor my aspuing soul pants for honours even beyond that dignity The Countess rose not from her seat norhad even unclaspedherhands.but hei head was turned haughtily towards the Abbot The smile of scorn curled liei hps, and when the father ceased to мЗ
246
speak, she paused forti few instants ere die «retuined the following answer: " Thou a cardinal! a pope, per¬ haps—and yet, methinks good Father, the conclave will have good cause to weep, when thou shalt stand a candi¬ date for the pontifie chair ; hut it con¬ cerns not me—be thou cardinal, or bc thou pope, I care but little, so then wilt not intrude thyself at Mannelli —be¬ gone, good Father, I would be alone." The monk's countenance assumed a deadly cast, and his quivering lip, and rolling eye, produced something like feaT ín the breast of the usually -un¬ daunted Countess, although she as¬ sumed * «omposure, whi<* astonished the monk, and excited hk admiration at the same time. By degrees he reco¬ vered his usual calm exter'h/r—" Match¬ less Angelina," at length he «said, and the Countess sprang from her swt, ex- cUiming—" He only who had the right 'to «all me by so familiar a name—is
%Í7
dead. Father, thou dost forget thyself; thtm art speaVtng to the widow of Lord Henry Ravenspur; he at whose frbwn thou hast retreat«!, ay, and trembled too. Think not that I shall be thy scorn ; leave rae Father, I command thee." " And if I do," replied the monk, " -what then? I liave the master-key to every lock within thy Castle. But sit down, good lady: I come to thee, to «peak of Henry Ravenspur the young¬ er." The Countess stopped, for she had nearly reached the door. " Hast thon then received tidings of fhe Count of Marinelli ?" " I have," replied, the monk, " wilt then heat them Γ " Be brief," rejoined the Countess, «eating herself—" I have much to ·αο before the morning dawns." The monk sighed, " Lady," he said, " I grieve to tell thee, that the impe¬ tuous disposition of thy son has fed him и 4
248 to commit excesses whicli —have drawn upon him the indignation of the Holy See, and he now"— The Countess's paleness alarmed the Father, but she waved her hand to him to proceed, for her lips refused their office. " The Grand Inquisitor bound by duty," resumed the Father, " to notice his misconduct, has therefore ordered his noble relatives to be answerable for his appearance, and he is at present in the custody of two familiars of the Holy Office, at the house ofthe Cardinal." " Impossible!" exclaimed the Coun¬ tess, " Impossible! Henry is wild—im¬ petuous, and daring; but lie never could be guilty of a crime that should come under the cognizance of the Holy Office. Thou hast some private reason for thus alarming me. Thy tale is false, I '11 not believe thee." " As thou wilt, daughter," resumed the monk, " but thou wilt, perhaps, not
24.9
doubt the contents of this lettci, us fiom thy brother The Countess read but half this epis¬ tle—with a trembling hand she placed it on the table, and covering her face with both hands she wept aloud then dashing the tears trom her eyes, she said, " Nature will claim her own but now Father, the means to extricate hnn lroin this difficult, this perilous situation I 11 write to the Grand Inquisitor my self" ' Instant ruin, would ensue,' replied the Father " All public notice must be avoided, the only means to save him, is to bribe his guards, and then put lnm and them on board some vessel bound for England " Take then these jewels," said the Countess giving at the same time two ungs of great value The Fathei took them, saying, "Thou wilt defer thy journey foi a few days, at least'" m 5
350
The Countess hesitated—" Two days I will remain quiet here, but no longer, Father. No power on earth shall keep me longer:—1 am hound for England, and if -within that time, thou dost not bring me good tidings of my son.—I 11 to the Pope Myself, he will not refuse to listen to the prayers of the danghter of hk ancient, former friend, the Count Frescati. Why dost thon linger here ί My sorrows would indulge themselves alone. Yet dost thou linger, so let it be—there are «ther apartments in the castle ; yet, methinks, that Father Ru¬ pert might yield the place to one—but no matter:—I have yet other chambers, I can caH my own." The monk rose, and with downcast looks, approached the lady, and with voice so altered, entreated her stay for a few minutes only, that the Countess «guessed his meaning, and with a look he understood, »he replied, " Not a single instant."
251
" Pause, lady, eie you repeat that answer,' was the monks reply, fixing his piercing eye upon her—" More depends upon your stay than you sup pose ' I will not be thus schooled, ' said the Countess haughtily, " when my judgment and penetration fail me, I shall peihaps submit, but not till then " You may be mistaken, replied the monk coolly, placi ig himself before the door ' You shall hear me now —Youi son is m my power lady—and bevvaTe how you accelerate his fate Look not thus incredulous—Henry, Count of Marinelli, ıs, I repeat, completely m my power — the Inquisition knows nought of him he marched head long to the snare —Barcelona! No—no—the Lady Gertiude is by this time safe m England, wedded perhaps to Loid Γ 1 ward —Your son ne'er reached Li g hom He ıs my prisoner, and furthei resistance of iny will, shall seal his m6
252
doom. Hear me lady—you stir not from this castle ; you hold, no inter¬ course with Cardinals, and Inquisitors ; no, no, the slightest attempt on your part, to thwart my plans, shall prove ins death-knell. ' Passion almost suffocated the Coun¬ tess : scarcely could she stand, and the exulting villain glorying in his power, approached her, and offered to take her hand. " Not for thy life," burst from her agonized lips,—" Not for thy life, Fa¬ ther------Rupert------insult me further. Drive me to desperation—and you shall repent it. Give me back my son, 'tır dread the vengeance of a distracted mother." Every action of the Countess exalted her in the eyes of Father Rupert ; he looked with contempt upon womankind in general : he loathed their sighs and tears, and never had the daring Ange¬ lina appeared in his eyes so bewitching
353
os when she gave him back scorn for scorn, and threat for threat. " Exalted woman/' he exclaimed, " thòu wert born to be my fate. For thee, and from thee, what have I not endured? yet the time is come when thou must fcç'nd that noble spirit to play the suppliant. Yés, Angelina,—the times are changed, the scene has shift¬ ed:—Yet it has made no change in me. I am now, what I have ever been—thy slave:—who dotes upon thy smiles, who kindles at thy frowns. Listen then to my proposals with a patient ear, and thy son shall instantly be free. Refuse ray prayer—reject my love—-and the dungeons of the Inquisition shall en¬ close him.'' Dissimulation, the last resource of the weak against the powerful, was all then that remained to the unhappy, haughty, high-born Countess, and she replied:— " Father, you know me well ;—you
454
are too impatient. Leave nie ¡—Ί sliall not quit the castle to-day—«neither to¬ morrow. Let that stffflce thœ— for the present." The softened tene -with which the Countess -made this speech ; the down- oast eyes and gentle action with whicli they were accompanied, combined to deceive the Abbot: ye«t, although he felt a dawning of hope spring in his mind, he was resolved not to trust wholly to the caprices of a woman ; he, therefore, entieated respectfully, " That she would, as an earnest of her sincerity fcnd forgiveness, oonfinc heTself to that apartment solely, and (he one beyond it." This was a proposition Angelina was not prepared for, yet she gave her con¬ sent to tine arrangement also. But when the Father again approached to lake her hand, she drew back, and pointing to the outer door, retreated at the same time to tlie farther apartment,
255
and the Father bowing lowly, he with¬ drew. Words are inadequate to describe the sensations which alternately raged in die Countess's bosom. Bage, scorn, indignation, shame, fear, and contempt, alternately racked her soul, and her head grew giddy as she contemplated the danger of her son. That son, for whom she had sacrificed her peace of mind, was in danger of being sacri¬ ficed to the villany of a man who owed all he held valuable in this life at the hands of her family. Various where the schemes she planned, but all were rejeiAed ; and, in despair, she took her seat at the window, looking with a vacant eye, upon a scene, calculated to excite emotions of the most delightful nature. External objects of delight, however, make no impression upon a heart weighed down by sadness, and the Countess saw nought in the waving woods, the sparkling founts, the misty
256
mountains, to charm her into a forget¬ fulness of the sorrows whicli over¬ whelmed her. Now she paced the room, now sunk supinely on her seat,—then wept—and anon, would scornfully dash the tear from her trembling eyelid. Anxiously she watched the dawn of' day, and when it appeared, she listened for the approach of Jaquelina with a restless impatience : at length she blew her whistle. No one answered the call—she attempted to open the door, it was fastened without Her condition appeared hopeless indeed; yet she le¬ solved. in this extremity, not to forsake herself. She entered therefore her inner apartment, and examining the window ivitli an attention, whicli the circumstances of the case alone could have excited, she found that she could spring from it, though the attempt might be accompanied by danger ; having thus secured a hope of escape, she composed her mind, and returned to the former
857
apartment Just within the door, she then discovered a small table with re freshment upon it of this she partook, and passed the day in laying future plans for her proceedings after her de¬ parture from the castle When therefore the Abbot knocked at the door, she bade him come m, and then in gentle, yet retiring, manner, en¬ treated he would leave her unmolested till the following day " Your wish is law," replied the monk, taking her hand, adding—" Oh, Angelina, thou wouldstgrace the proud¬ est diadem that Europe owns," but, hc checked himself, and bowing lowlily his head, again retired " So fare thee well, most Holy Friar," silently ejaculated the Countess, " fare thee well—I trust for ever —the wall is high, but my spirits light, my necessity urgent, and my hopes desperate " In this mood we shall leave her, and account for the disappearance of Jaque-
ass
lim. «When Fether Rupert arrived at the castle, Ibe called the waiting woman to him, nnd told her as я friend, theit the sooner she «quitted the «sattle the better, for that a sentence of excommunication was about to be issued against the Countess end Ьет family, who were strongly «suspected ¡of heresy. Every one fcrøyws «the terrore which such a sentence prliduced in forme» times, umi Jaquelina, loving herself much better than «she loved her lady, packed up her goods -atui «decamped. Tbe hmstte she w« in escited the «riosity ofher стт- panions; ami ter exAaimrtion-when she heard the «ound trf -mutes' feet, «2., " The Holy Virgin protect us, I wish I am sture, with all my heart; I "was a prisoner in Tmliey, for there they do shew-some -respect to females,—but the Inquisitors respect no one." She wes now assailed by many of her ffettewiewimts, and th<e tniíA, at. slie «apposed «soaped her; ten of the
S59
domestics chose to remain, and among those who did so, were three English¬ men, the Italian gardener, and the under cook. These thought it would be high tíme to escape when the offi¬ cers really came ; besides they had some reluctance at quitting their lady, and leaving her quite alone. Moreover one of the Englishmen, had the greatest possible antipathy to fhe Father, and he set the monk down as the most ungrateful of .men, to forsake the lady to whom lie was ao greatly indebted : for he thought he might have given her timely information, «nd enabled her to escape. He expressed these sentiments to the gardener, who felt precisely the same, and when the sua was Op, the latter repaired bt the garden, and tliere he saw his lady sitting disconsolately at the window. The Countess had never conducted herself very con«descendingly to her domestics, yet she had never be¬ haved to them with particular haishness,
260
and there was a sentiment of gallantry, prcvading, in those days, all ranks, arising from the chivalrous exploits of knighthood, which induced them to wait the event. Their noble lady in tears was a sight no one of her domestics had ever witnessed. Her non-appear¬ ance, during the whole day, alarmed them, and the station the monk chose, that of the corridor leading to her chamberexcited suspicions, which could not exactly be defined, yet they were sufficient to interest these dependants greatly. They saw her taking a view of the distance between the window and the ground, and made a signal which she did not observe, but just before sunset the gardener placed himself under her window, and as he busied himself in his occupation he sang the following lines:— " Lady, lady, dost thou weep? Can I thy grief assuage ? Lady, lady—I '11 not sleep ----- I 'U dare the father's rage.
261
Give bul the word, if help thou nced'sl, So trust me help m nigh Beneath those trees, which there tliou sees t Stand those, who 'It fight—or die Would'st tliou leap the window's height And fiee thy castle walis, 'Tie well I 'II aid thy flight, Thou soon shall gam thy lawful right, And lord it in these walls " The Countess approached the win¬ dow softly, and leaning out of it, she replied to this song in two words, more she dared not venture—" At mid¬ night " The evening was sultry, and she left her casement open as she busied herself in packing up some few jewels and con¬ cealing others She was interrupted in this employment, about eleven o'clock, by the whizzing of an arrow by her which came in at her window Its shaft was wound round with a slip of parchment, and a silken-cord was at¬ tached to it ivhich hung out of the window.
262
On the parchment was written " Fear not—Friends are at hand—Pull up the string and throw back the arrow." The Countess obeyed these directions, un¬ fastened the silken string and drew it up, and, as she pulled it within her chamber, it appeared to increase in weight; after some little time, she saw агоре ladder with two hooks fastened to it She was now all energy. The arrow she threw back again, and con¬ cealing carefully the means for hcr escape, she seated herself quietly by a table in the middle of the room, with her hack to the outer door, fearing that the monk might have heard the noise, naturally produced by her movements. She was not mistaken ; Father Rupert heard more noise than he deemed ne- ^cessary.,, and softly unclosing, the door, he looked into the apaitment ; but she had just taken hor seat, and pretended not to hear him. Finding her thus im¬ moveable, hc as softly retired, making
968
quite sure of his victim : yet still he resolved to be upon the alert. The castle clock at length tolled twelve, all was still as death, when the Countess drew forth the ladder. At this moment the father knocked—" Daugh¬ ter," he said, are you, ill ?" " Not quite well, good Father," re¬ plied the Countess, " and my lamp is nearly extinguished. 4 This sho had purposely .'contrived, " I will give theo mine, lady," said the Abbot, entering,, and placing his lamp upon the table. Now this outer apartmentj or as we should describe it, the one opening into the corridor, had one small window: the inner chamher was, larger, and stretched considerably beyond this one. " A little air, good Father, would re¬ vine ше —wilt thou open the casement?" The monk mounted a chair, and did so. " Whe» I, an» chill, sesumed tb«'
264
Countess, I can close it with this staff. Good night, good Father." " Beloved daughter," said the monk, " my benison be ivith thee." "Thanks,Father," rejoined Angelina; " thanks, good Father, good night, my eyes are weary, and my heart is heavy." The monk again withdrew, and with difficulty she moved some of the furni¬ ture against the door, so as to impede his entrance; then with a light heart, she entered the inner apartment, put chairs against its door, and throwing out the ladder, fastened the hooks to the window, with an ecstasy not to be described, ascertained it was fastened below, and ejaculating a hymn to the Virgin, she with difficulty got out of the window, but with considerable agi¬ lity descended the ladder, i* was, however, necessary that this laiHei should be taken away, unfortunately it resisted their efforts to unhook it ; the
265
gardener, however, who had been used to the mountains, said, if he had but a long pike he could soon manage the business. A pike was got, and he mounted the ladder, unhooked it, softly closed the casement, and descended two or three steps, by means of small holes in the wall, sufficient for the point ofhis toe to rest on ; the pike was then given him, which fixing firmly in the ground, he took hold of the top and swung in safety to the bottom. Witli inconceivable speed they quitted th* castle grounds, and at mid-day, con¬ cealed themselves in a cave well known to the gardener. Here they rested during the heat of the day ; and in this secure retreat we shall leave them.

Macbeth. Father Rupert knocked at the coun¬ tess's apartment long after the sun had risen, for he waited till she would make some signal that she was up and willing to admit him ; but finding that all ivas still at a late hour, he opened the door, and with some difficulty too for the chairs, and other articles of furniture, which she had placed against it, greatly impeded his progress. He called loudly upon her, but received no answer, and
267
with much impetuosity he forced his way towards the inner chamber. Here he met with the same impediments, but his passion, which had been progres¬ sively rising during the last five minutes, knew no bounds when he found this apartment, like the former, deserted. Hc stamped about the room like a mad¬ man, and rushed down the first flight of stairs with so much impetuosity, that with difficulty he saved himself from being precipitated from the top to the bottom of the second flight. This cir¬ cumstance recalled him to a sense of the danger he should incur if seen under his present impulse of rage, and the sound of approaching footsteps compelled him to retrace his steps, and enter the nearest apartment, as a refuge from observation. The crisis of his fate was, however, at hand; he felt this, being confidently convinced that the Countess was not only willing, but equal to the completion of his ruin, and would shortly inflict
268
upon him ono of the greatest of all pos¬ sible evils which could befall him, viz., —the exposuie of his true character. With a rapidity of thought and decision of character peculiar to himself, he- glanced the several dangers ivhich threatened him, and their antidotes. Judging of Angelina from himself, for he knew every turnof herdisposition, and thatin many respects there was agreat re¬ semblance of character, between thein.he concluded she would repair to Rome, where her friends were many and power¬ ful. Thither, therefore, he resolved to hasten on the instant, as a brother of his house, not as its chief. Yet anxious as he was to be gone, he summoned the few domestics who remained around hiin, telling them that tlieir lady had effected her escape in a most miraculous man¬ ner, from the wrath of the Inquisition, and that, therefore, he being released from all further concern respecting her, he should return to his convent.
269
His mules were ordered, and his at¬ tendants summoned, and he set off at a gentle pace, apparently for Milan. No sooner, however, had he emerged from the territories ofthe castle, than he dis¬ missed his small train, and putting on a cloak with a cowl, he said he was bound on a pilgrimage, and bade them return to the convent. The Countess, in the mean while, pur¬ sued her journey as speedily as circum¬ stances would permit; and after she had crossed the Apennines and had reached Sienna, she debated as to the best way of completing her journey. The road from Sienna to the capital of the States of the Church was accom¬ panied by innumerable perils ; and yet it appeared a loss of time to cross from the former place to Leghorn, in order to embark. But the Countess decided for the adoption of the latter plan, and thi¬ ther they proceeded. One of the Eng¬ lishmen who accompanied her was des- n3
270
patched, on their arrival, to hire a vessel, and just as he was returning to the inn, he was accosted by Nicolai. With the utmost surprise the latter learnt that the Countess had quitted her own castle in the mysterious manner we have mentioned; her reasons she had closely locked in her own breast, therefore all Nicolai could get from this man was, " that his lady appeared to have been a prisoner, where she had formerly reigned mistress, and that she was exceedingly anxious to reach Rome." " Is Father Rupert with her?" said Nicolai. " No," replied his companion; «No, no,—thank heaven, we gave him the slip : but heaven help us if we ever get into his clutches again." " Where is the young Count then, why does not he accompany the lady Countess?" in¬ quired Nicolai. This, and many other questions, ivhich Nicolai put, Robert his companion could not answer, for he

knew no more than that his young lord had left the castle suddenly, and that his lady had expressed much uneasiness upon his account. " Tell my lady I am here," said Ni¬ colai, " and would speak with her, if she so permit." The Countess at first hesitated. Ni¬ colai had always been the chosen in¬ strument of Father Rupert's will. He had also assisted in carrying away Gertrude. Yet there appeared little choice left for her; and summoning, therefore, all herself to meet this follow, she desired he might be admitted. She returned a slight movement of her head to his profound salutation, asking himat the same time " from whence he came." " From Lyons, lady," was the reply, " and I come to entreat you would again admit me as your servant. I would fain solve the mystery which envelopes my lord's death, and think if you would stand my friend, and secure me the pro¬ li 4

tečtion of my lord Cardinal, your cousin, and that ofthe Grand Inquisitor, I could point out the man who struck the poison¬ ous blow." " The assassin is already secured," replied the Countess, " and is in the hands of justice." " Indeed!" exclaimed Nicolai, "did the Father give himself up to justice? how was he discovered? did his agents betray him?" " The Father !" repeated the Countess in faltering accents; " what Father?" " Father Rupert," resumed Nicolai — and the Countess whose command over her feelings was always great, bade her informant leave her. He did so, but re¬ turned soon afterwards putting down a horn of spring water, for he feared his lady would faint. Her pale cheek, and the violent trembling she could noi con¬ ceal, and when he again entered she bade him keep that secret from every living soul till called upon hy those

having authority. " You will,'' she added, " accompany me to Rome, till then set a seal upon your lips. Is the yessel ready to take us on board ? I am impatient to be gone." " It waits your bidding, lady," re¬ plied Nicolai —and the Countess, rising, walked to the quay and embarked. A favourable wind carried them quickly to Rome, and the Countess repairing to the palace of the Cardinal with Nicolai only as an attendant, demanded an audience ofhis eminence. This was denied her, as the time had passed of publicduty, and the Cardinal was engaged with his friends. " Give him that, good fellow, and say the owner of it ivould speak with him," said the Countess, drawing from her finger a valuable family ring. The servant obeyed, and the Cardinal rose fromhis seat and hastened to the hall. His cousin put her finger on her lip, and he opened a side-door and admitted her into his library. n 5

" Why this mystery, Angelina?" said the Cardinal. " I have much to say, my good lord," replied the Countess, " of injuries deep and lasting received at the hand of Father Rupert." ' The Cardinal started as he repeated her words. " Most true," resumed An¬ gelina ; " and were it not that my son's Hfe is in that villain's power, I would not detain you from your guests." She then briefly related to him the parti¬ culars of her late adventure, and con¬ cluded by sayingthat " Nicolai was with» out, who had, tliough ignorant of these particulars, named Father Rupert as the murderer of the Count." The Cardinal opened the door of the apartment and called in Nicolai. Tlie latter then detailed, in plain terms, the conversation of the Father with him, upon the subject in question ; and the astonished Cardinal asked him, " why he did not sooner unfold this mystery—
275
particularly when the deed was done ''' Nicolai then proceeded to relate the Father's pretended repentance with re¬ gard to Gertrude, and his own anxiety that this young lady should reach Eng¬ land safely But I am now ready to give my testimony, and resign myself en¬ tirely mto your hands I left the lady Gertrude at Lyons, with her brother, and she is now, I think, beyond the Father's power I could wish the young Count were but as safe I should not be surprised if he were even now a pri¬ soner in the dungeons of his own castle of Mannelli ' " The Holy Virgin protect him," ex claimed the Countess, " I will instantly return to Mannelli ' " Not so, ' interrupted the Cardinal, " you and your suite must be my pn soners The monk must not know you are in Rome, he will be here forthwith, depend upon it You, Nicolai, fetch hither your companions—you must be n6
276
Content to lodge with me. I will des¬ patch proper officers to Marinelli, em¬ powering them to search throughout it, and you must give your orders to this effect my lady cousin. I will provide fit entertainment for you, though you must at present assume the appearance of a person attainted of some crime." The Cardinal then returned to his guests, made an apology for his absence, . which he said must be prolonged, as an afluir of the greatest importance de¬ manded his immediate attention. Hav¬ ing thus excused himself, he repaired to the palace of the Grand Inquisitor, and laid before him the crimes of wliich a member of the holy office was accused. If the astonishment ofthe Cardinal had been great, that of the Inquisitor was beyond all possibility of description. He would not believe it, declaring he considered the story a gross fabrication. " There is one way," replied the Car¬ dinal, " to ascertain one ofthe facts, at jeast; if you persist in doubting the
277
word of a daughter of our noble house. The assassin is in the prisons of tho In¬ quisition—put him to the torture till he confess his accomplice. Intimate to him that you know who he is—allude to the Father, and sec how he receives the information. In the mean while send proper officers to Marinelli, to search the castle for our youthful cousin, the Count; this is an act of common justice you cannot refuse." " Most certainly," said the Inquisitor, " but where is the Countess?" " At my house, unknown, and so she should remain, until this atrocious af¬ fair is sifted to the bottom." To this also the Inquisitor agreed, and he immediately made arrangements for the carrying jnto effect these various re¬ solutions, while the Cardinal returned to his palace and consoled the Countess with the prospect of soon embracing her sou. Father Rupert, in the meanwhile, was following the steps of the Countess.

AU , of late, seemed to combine to thwart his plans, when they appeared to wear an aspect so favourable that a doubt of their success nevei entered his mind. When Nicolai had left him to return to Tuscany, he had, upon his recovery from his stupefaction, sent a trusty mes¬ senger after him; but Nicolai, having the fear of the Inquisition in his heart, pursued his journey without remission. The crime of having levelled to the ground a Dominican Friar, a member to of the dreaded tribunal ! what could he expect, if taken?—death, in its most frightful forms* The messenger ar- * Much has been said of the misrepresentation ofthe cruelties exercised by tins celebiated tri¬ bunal. But the following instance, among many othere, took place in the last century only. The grandson of the victim ts now in England. A Jew having drawn upon himself the indigna¬ tion of the members of the Inquisition, was cited in the usual way, to appear before them. This sum¬ mons it was needtesi to attempt to evade, for the

Jane were included in the monk's or¬ ders of arrest. This messenger having received no orders to quit Italy, retuined to his em¬ ployer, who vented his rage and threats upon his unsuccessful emissary. Yet he had succeeded in one of his plans. The young Count was in his power, and as for Gertrude he troubled himself no more about her than as she was consi¬ dered one of the instruments necessary to his aggrandizement. The story ofher being at Barcelona, was a fabrication to had preeided at the horrid sacrifice, his poor wife was compelled to put on her wedding garments, and be present at his agonies ' ' ' Nature sunk under this inhuman trial, her senses forsook her, and she died raving mad Her son,aboy of twelve years of age, fled on foot, and begged his way through France, nor thought himself secure tilt he touched the happy shores of England.

mislead the young Count, and in this design he was successful. Ho now bent every resolution to conceal the place of his confinement, as the means of procuring his own pardon, in case the Countess should discover his late de¬ signs to those who could bring him to punishment. Bodily pain he scorned, yet he knew the hardiest spirits, the firmest nerves, had yielded to ,the tor- , tures ofthe Inquisition: and there were moments when he thought he could be content to linger out his days in some unknown spot, where he could sink into the grave quietly, so that he could es¬ cape the dreaded inquiry. Yet he felt there was but little hope that such could be his lot, and hc therefore resolved to dare his fate, and trust to his own matchless assurance, and the unwilling¬ ness with which the Inquisition ever proceeded to extremities against any of the members of the religious orders. He knew too that his rank as an Abbot
2»г of St. Dominick was a powerful shield ; for at the period in question the sanctity of this order, its power, ¡ts influence, was scarcely equalled by that of any other religious community. To Rome, therefore, he bent his steps, and arrived there two days after the Countess. At Leghorn he had learnt she had embarked for that city ; but upon making the most particular inquiries at the several houses of public entertain¬ ment, he could not discover where she was when he reached the capital of the Holy See. He, therefore, placed himself before the palace ofthe Cardinal, and watched for hours, to see whether she had sought refuge there. At length unable to endure this suspense, he ap¬ proached one ofthe domestics and asked " if the Cardinal were within !" He was answered in the affirmative. " Dost thou know, friend," he resumed, " whether the Countess Marinelli is with him? for I have an humble petition to
283 present to her from a brother of our order, (he had assumed the habit of a Franciscan,) " who has much to re proach himself with for being an agent ofher greatest enemy—say too that — " But she is not here, replied the servant " Aie you sure of that 1 ear nestly inquired Father Rupert ' Quite sure,' was the reply " Has, then, no stranger arrived at Rome lately from the Countess, bearing a message to the Cardinal ' " I' faith, I know not," replied the servant, " and yet you now recall it to me There is a lady here, and two or three men, all confined and kept sepa rate But what has that to do with your message to the Countess ' " Would to heaven, said the Tather, crossing himself, " that I could speak to that lady I could glad her heart with tidings of those she would be most glad to see Couldst thou not convey to her this message '
284
" It ıs impossible, ' rejoined the man, ' I know not which apartment she is in and if I did, how could I disobey my masters orders'' The monk grasped his hand, and put into it a small purse ' I will double, ay, treble that, if you could procure me a few moments au dionee with the lady " The man looked at the purse, asking at the same time " what am I to say to her'' " Say, ' replied the delighted Father, " that the Franciscan monk who solicits an audience, was an agent of her greatest enemy, but that he repents his guilt, and ivould make reparation for his past conduct, by disclosing to her the fate of him she is so anxious to discover Say that to the stranger lady ' " I will try what I can do for you— the Cardinal will be out this evening, and then you may call again, and 1 will let you know how I succeed ' " Benedicite, my son," replied the
285
monk, " lt will glad her heart and mine and thou art doing a deed «hall blesi thy memory, and render thec an e\ ample to future age» " As for the matter of that, re|oined the man, tossing the purse—' As to fu ture ages I care not much about them— but this gentleman is a powerful reward for the present if the future produces more of them, m í/i¡s age I shall be content ' The monk withdrew, and the man re tired to inspect the content» of the purse Tather Rupert having thus succeeded hej ond his hopes, waited with an impa tience not bc described forthe evening, he had not come unprepared to Rome lm this interview On this point, once gained, clung all his future hopes He had a letter with lnm which he dared not nitiust to mortal hands It was the talisman, the charm, which was to rescue lum fiom all lib difficulties, to cover hıra

with honour, to clothe lnm with fresh dignity, to make him appear a paragon of humility and Christian chanty, in the ey es of that world he so adored—whose smile was heaven, and whose frown was death " Since it must be so, he ejaculated as he repaired to the Cardinal s palace " since self preservation will have it so since I have advanced so tar I cannot recede , I must make one desperate ef¬ fort, and daie the utmost Threats may do much with the Countess for though as a woman she possesses courage be¬ yond her sex, yet as a mother she has more than a woman's fears With this resolution he approached the palace, and the servant beckoning to him, he hastily advanced and demanded the success of his errand The man re plied " that the lady refused to grant him audience " Impossible,' said the friar, " tell her I must see her, that if she persist in
887
lefusing ine admittance, that, which she most dreads, will inevitably befall her Tell her I must see her ; and that if she does not shortly resolve to give me an audience, I shall quit Rome, and she may guess my errand." The man returned after giving thi« message, and asked the Father to enter the hall—the monk obeyed—but his in¬ terview and its results must be given in the next Chapter.

thou this?" drawing forth a dagger at the same moment. The Countess shrank back, yet exclaimed, " But my son, my son; Oh, Father, my son, my son! where is he? Leave me not thus?" The monk smiled sarcastically as hc replied, " It is too late ; let me pass, lady." " Not till you've told me where my Henry is? Not till yon have said he's safe." " The time's gone by, lady," resumed Father Rupert; " and since thou hast shewn such terror at my love, how must thou tremble at my hate! Fool that 1 have been to risk my peace for one I thought above the vulgar class of women. Ah ! how have I been deceived ; but I will waste no further thought on thee ; this is the last gaze—the last lingering, glimmering spark of love is—now ex¬ tinct. From my heart I tear this passion, and yielding only to my hate, I will be revenged on thee—on all. No power on earth shall wrench the secret of thy
297
son's concealment from my breast ; tor¬ tures I defy, and now farewell. Fare¬ well, Angelina, when next we meet, we meet as foes at deadly enmity." As the monk said this, he fixed his eyes upon the senseless object before him ; for the Countess, unable to con¬ tend with her varied feelings, had be¬ come insensible to them and all sur¬ rounding objects. Slowly and with measured pace Fa¬ ther Rupert quitted the chamber, and passed through the outer one, saying to those who were there present, the Countess would bc with them anon. At the door he turned round, and ex¬ tending his arms, he gave them his " benedicite ;" and, with the same self- possession, he descended the stairs, crossed the hall, and entered the street. He now considered himself safe, and repairing to the Tiber, he again em¬ barked and set offfor the castle of M»- o5
398 rinelli, where he had a pnsoner, but not the Countess's son The Countess lay foi some time in sensible, and it was long eie she could collect her thoughts when she did re cover, but when once she had acquired the power to think, she called aloud, and rushing from the apartment, asked " where the monk was gone ? None knew of course, and, regardless of exposing heraelf to the observations of the rest of the domestics of the palace, she descended the stairs, and at the foot of them met the Cardinal her cousin All she couldsay tolas lepeated inquiries, " The monk—the monk, Fa ther Rupert,—he is gone, and my son will be murdeipd Oh foi pity» sake despatch in eveiy duection messengeis to overtake him ι The Cardmal did not wait a second bidding, but repaired to the house ot the Grand Inquisitoi, supposing it pos-

sible the monk was gone thither, in order to make good his story, where he knew it would be likely he should gain belief, rather than the Countess When therefore he found that the monk whs not there, he sent m every direction to forbid his departure, but Father Rupert had too much at stake to linger in Rome at such a crisis his purpose was to gain Mannelli, if possible, before any peison should get thither from Rome He had theiefore embarked instantly on quitting the palace, and journeyed with that speed which the fear of death would natuially inspire All was still in the environs of Mannelli, as he approached it he saw no one The doors weie closed, and the windows likewise, but he was shortly greeted by the well known tones of one of his creatures " Benedicite, son,' said the abbot, for the practice of making use of this word was so habitual to lnm, 06
300
that he never omitted it upon first seeing any one: " How is thy prisoner?" " Well," said the man, " only a little troubled with fancies ; and he fades like the dew on a sunsliining morning. Will you see him? for since the lady left the castle we have full possession of it." " I have no wish to see him," replied the Father ; " I have other work to do. Leave me for a time. I must to the lady's chamajer ; I have papers there of importane!".' " I am tired of this solitary life," re¬ turned the man ; " I would gladly change situations with Roberto for a time." " Ah !" said the monk, " who told you where Roberto was?" " Yourself," resumed the minister of Father Rupert's pleasure. The monk smiled, waved his hand and passing the fellow, went up stairs and began his researches in the cabinet. While he ■was thus occupied, he fancied he heard
301
a noise, he turned round and listened ; a diamond cross, he had just taken from its silken bed dropped from his hold : all was however again silent, and he resumed his occupation. As he opened one of the drawers, he unconsciously touched a spring, and a secret recess sprung open, and disclosed to him the will of the late Count, with all the deeds relating to the estates of the family. This, was a treasure he little expected, and having opened the door into the outer apartment, to see that all was safe, he returned, and seating him¬ self at a table he was soon completely absorbed ■' bis occupation. While he was thus employed, two persons softly unclosed the door, and entered; they were without shoes, and moved with the greatest precaution. Father Ru¬ pert's countenance as he read, occa¬ sionally expressed surprise, sometimes contempt, and at length he put down the parchment, with a smile of the most
302
sarcastic nature, saying, " Superstitious fool—the gift of that noble estate to the convent of Ravenspur, for masses for his soul forsooth No, no, my lord Count, I can appropnate this estate to a more worldly and profitable purpose, than the repose of thy soul By St Paul, such a treasure may help me to the pontifie chair he again leached the will " But let us see—what fur ther folly A thousand crowns to my tried friend and confessor, Father Ru pert " The monk paused an instant after reading this paragraph —" His friend ' his------' again he put down the parchment, and resting his elbow on the table for a time, he slowly re sumed the writing, but at this moment he was again alarmed by a slight noise he did not trust himself to look around, yet his expressive countenance betrayed the workings of his guilty soul At last, he said—" Who is there ' ' no one answered, and placing his right
303
hand upon one aim of the elbow chair, and the left, whicli held the parchment, upon his knee, he slowly turned round, and beheld a Familiar of the Inquisition on each side of lum Struck motion less at this spectacle, he remained for some minutes like a statue The con vulsivc movement of his eyebrows and his lips, were the first symptoms that he was still a living being, his eyes which had been fixed for some time, now rolled horribly , a' 'ength, he sprang towards the door, but «here he saw moie of those appalling instruments of the Inquisì tions power Slowly he drew back, fixing his eyes upon them, then giani mg at the othei two, he said—" Is it indeed come to dus' must I perish on the rack' die in excruciating tortures, be exposed like a common felon * No, no—no, no— I will die as I have lived—to myself alone As he said this, he drew a poniard from his bosom, but ere he could strike
304
the fatal blow, his arm was arrested by one of the Familiars ' Forbear," said the officer ' and read the order of our venerable Father He summons thee to exculpate thyself trom charges of the most heinous dye, he exhorts thee to prepare thy own de fence, and rescue thine own, and the name of the holy order to which thou dost belong, from infamy and shame " And think you, friend replied the monk speaking with difficulty ' and think you I know nought of the lovmg kindnesses of our Reverend Fathei ' Bc lieve me, I would rather trust the greatest foe I have on earth, than this same reverend Inquisitor ' Fool that I was—to be entrapped thus '' He paused,—" Yet still, he cried, " I am master of my fate—I have a secret in my possession shall work my pardon—Lead on, I 11 follow —but touch me not,—I need no cords, no chains, for though I perish in the at tempt, I '11 be revenged
305
The Familiars at the door led the way, the two others followed ; at the portal of the castle stood the man who held, as the monk supposed, Lord Ed¬ ward in safe custody. The smile of this villain, who had served Father Ru¬ pert so long as his rewards were greater than those of his present employers, stung the monk to the quick, and had he possessed the means he would have levelled him at his feet. But Father Rupert was now precisely in the same situation as that to which he had so often reduced others. He was helpless, and so enveloped in toils, that all hope would have forsaken any other person under the same circumstances; yet he still clung to the idea of saving his life by revealing the prison-house of the young Count ; and, if he could not ac¬ complish this, he found satisfaction in the contemplation of the lingering death of his youthful victim, who would in¬ evitably perish by his deep-laid plots,

Although the Grand Inquisitor had pretended totally to disbelieve the ac¬ cusations made by the Cardinal against

Father Rupert, yet, he was not, m truth, so thoroughly convinced of the innocence of the monk But the respect he had for the Dominican order led him to feign disbelief The confession, how ever, of Nicolai himself, and the sudden appearance of Lord Edward Saltoun, whom the Father had impiisoned in the dungeons of Mannelli castle, and who was liberated by the man appointed as his goaler, so soon as the Father was gone, induced him to despatch instantly four of his officers, with orders to se erete themselves, and to watch the monk's actions and sayings with the greatest accuracy and precision These men were well schooled in the depart ment of espionnage, and executed their order» to the letter Lord Edward in the mean while de posed, that he had been surprised one night in his bed, when he was just re¬ covering from a fit of illness, and carried by four men, and placed in a litter That

he had been gagged and conveyed to a dungeon, but to what place it belonged he could not guess till his jailer opened the door of his cell, and he found him self in the castle of Mannelli ' that, weak as he was, he proceeded to Rome the man promising to conceal his escape from the monk This fellow also told him that the young Count w<is impri soned, but that he was ignorant of the place of his concealment The assassin, who had been recog nised by one of the Count s servants, was then called for, and told tl his employer was discovered and ш custody ' Indeed ' ' he ejaculated, " why then monks are not such clever fellows as I thought they were But, if you know my employer, there is an end of the matter, and so will there shortly bc of me, as I suppose " The Father Rupert is confined in one of the cells ol the Inquisition, said the Cardinal
311
" I care not for hım," was the leply, " only if I were to escape this time, I should take pietty good caie not to be led into the like scrape by all the Fa ther Ruperts in the world ' " What did he give you as a reward for this atrocious deed,' said one ofthe Inquisitors * " A purse of gold,' replied the vil lam " You will now then swear upon the Holy Cross to all these questions and answers ' ' observed the Cardinal, " 01 the rack shall compel you ' " Truly, I have no wish to undergo the torture for Father Rupert, or any one else, replied the villain, " and therefore I can have no objection to sweai to this " Thus was the assassin cheated into that confession, which force could not have compelled him to make, so long as he conceived he could save his life b) refusing to make it The Inquisitors
312
were not particular in their means of ex¬ torting confessions, and they had a most comprehensive method of understand¬ ing, and interpreting or rather pervert¬ ing, these. The assassin was now led back to his cell, and ordered for exe¬ cution. The Inquisitor and the Cardi¬ nal then withdrew, and repaired to the Countess, and Father Rupert was sent for. He entered the apartment with a re¬ solute air, yet started at seeing the Countess ; his sallow cheek was tinged with red, but the flush soon vanished, and with it, the momentary return of weakness which had rushed upon his heart. Again his lip curled in scorn, and darting upon her a look which made her shrink, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, and underwent the severe interrogatory of the Grand Inquisitor with the utmost composure, until the rack was threatened him, if he obsti¬ nately persisted in concealing the place
313
of the Counts confinement The fact of lnsbeingthe principal and prime agent ofthe death of the Count and his bene factor, was proved to the satisfaction of his judges, 'hough he answered to all their queries on that subject, with the smile of scorn only He neither denied nor admitted the fact When taxed with insulting, and imprisoning the Countess, he acknowledged that he had done so, but said he could make her ample amends, by revealing to her the secret of her son s residence " Conditionally I will do this, ' he added " but it must be upon my own terms " " Insolence unparalleled' retorted the Grand Inquisitor, " to presume to dictate to us such terms The Coun tess who was present, now unable to suppress her violent emotions, quitted her seat.and fell at his feet, exclaiming, ' Oh Father Rupert, tell me, in pity tell me, of my son " The monk looked down upon her scornfully, while her vol iv ρ
314
noble relatives hastened to raise her, but she still clung to the monk, and implored him to take compassion on her " To see ТЧЕЕ thus, ' exclaimed Fa¬ ther Rupert, with fiend like joy, " the noble relative of my judges, on her knees' the Countess at my feet! im¬ ploring mercy at the hands of him she scorned—spurned ' to see her who fled so lately fiom me, as though I were a serpent, now cling to mc ' Ah, my triumph is complete, the secret dies with mc, and thus beyond the power of fate to alter, thus I seal it " He raised his hand to his lips, and unper¬ ceived by all, swallowed a deadly poi¬ son The Countess s grief bordered on derangement, and m the eagerness of her fnends to remove her, they did not obseive the rapid change that the ap¬ proach of death was making on the shivering, and convulsed frame of the monk Yet, still chenshing to the last,
315
the insatiate passion of revenge, he struggled with his agony, and as the Countess was hurried from the apart¬ ment, he burst into a laugh, and called aloud—" 'Tıs done—I said—I—I— should not fall alone With a groan so deep, it startled those who weie fa miliar with the agonizing shriek of dread despair, he fell to the ground—and m a few minutes a blackened corse was all that remained of Father Rupert. The death of Father Rupert was per fectly unexpected, for aware of the desperate nature ofthe friai, his person had been carefully searched, lest he should conceal any means of destruc tion A sharp knife was taken from him, but this was the only offensiv e in strument that was found about lnm Every place of secrecy in the neigh¬ bourhood of Mannelli was now ex ploicd, yet no one could discovei the smallest trace of the Count The knave who had released Loid Saltoun, had __ p2
316
pretended a knowledge of the fact, hoping to surprise the Father into a dis closure of the secret, but it was too important to be extorted fiom the wily monk unintentionally, and the Countess, in despair, resolved to enter a nunnery The Cardinal combated this resolution, foi he still had hopes that his cousin τι ould be discovered Not so the Count of Frescati After six months had elapsed he claimed the estate», which became his upon the death of his ne phew The Countess refused to resign them till twelve months had expired, the last six months of which she passed in a convent at Rome, wh°ro we shall leave her for a time, and return to Eng land, whither Lord Edward had re paired, in company with Nicolai, as soon as he could, with decency, leave the Countess Young Ravenspur we left on the full gallop on his way to Dover, and Clod, with Father Andrew, had just reached
317
Ravenspur ; yet he staid not long there, for on the day following, he set off with two of the Earl of Ravenspur's retainers to join the young lord. When Richard Ravenspur reached Dover, the fugitives had sailed some hours, and as the wind was rising, and f'ie weather hazy, none of the fishing-boats would put to sea after them. Every hour was of impor¬ tance in the eye of young Richard, and his impatience was increased to a painful degree on perceiving, the next day, that the sea rolled heavily, and that the fishermen had drawn up their little boats as if they foresaw a continuation ot' stormy weather. This circumstance de¬ tained him a whole week, and by that time Clod joined him. As soon as the weather would permit they embarked, and after many contrary accidents, "both by flood and field,'' they reached Lyons. At this place Clod was recognised by Nicolai, who caught him by the hand, ___ __ „л«
318
and expressed the most extravagant joy at seeing him there, asking him whether the young Richard was in that part of '.he country ; and, in the same breath. hc told him, that the Lady Gertrude ivas in Lyons. Clod's joy burst forth and evinced itself by such antics, that he drew the attention of passers-by. " No matter," said he to Nicolai, " no matter ; if they had as much cause for joy as I have they would play antics too. And how does the lady Countess, and my Lord ? and that precious piece of mischief Signora Jaquelina !" " You ask too many questions," re¬ plied Nicolai, " for me to answer with¬ out refreshing my—" " Ah, what the old tune, Nicolai — but come along, my lad, come along, I forgive you all your former wickedness, for bringing back the Lady Gertrude safe to us. Let's go to Lord Henry— now by my holidame, Nicolai, but thou
319
art improved. Thou art become a mar¬ vellous, proper man, and hast lost much of thy knavish appearance. But where is the Lady Gertrude?—let's go to her." " Pray," said Nicolai, gravely, " pray, Master Clod, what is it you would have me to do? First we are to go to my lord—then to my lady." " Pshaw, nonsense," said Clod, " why man, get you gone to the lady, and I will bring the lord to her and be sure you tell her Clod is in Lyons." Nicolai replied to the fool's numerous questions and commands in a few words. " Well, Master Clod, I will do my best to please you, I will tell my lady you are here, and do you tell my lord we are at the Eagle." Clod posted off to his master and re¬ ported his joyful tidings, adding— " Truly, my lo.d, they may well say there is no fellowship among the wick¬ ed;— ρ 4
320
" Nicolai has relinquished all friend¬ ship with the monk. I shall think the better of him all the daj s of my life. I am not quite sure but I shall some¬ times honour him with my countenance. Forget and forgive, you know, my lord. But I must teach him a new doctrine ere I give him my confidence." Lord Richard scarcely noticed the fool's talk, but with impatient strides proceeded on his way to the inn where the Lady Gertrude was, with mingled emotions of joy, hope, and fear, awaiting his arrival. Their meeting was affec¬ tionate, and their interview lasted long. They had each much to relate, innu¬ merable questions to ask, and many regrets to detail. At length, however, a pause intimated that they had unbur- thened both their hearts, and the future presented itself to their imagination, glowing with all the tints of youthful hope.
321
Clod was at lengtii permitted to pay his respects to his lady, and after giving vent to his joy, by a thousand extrava gancies, his feelings at length subsided into a calm The next day saw them on their way for England, but Nicolai returned to Italy with the intention of inquiring after Lord Edward Saltoun, whose sudden absence had caused him much uneasiness His arrival in that country we have alieady mentioned He had forborne to name this nobleman to Gertrude from motives of delicacy, which were not very consonant to his usual character But the fact was this, Nicolai had been drawn in to second Father Ruperts schemes by degrees The Earl of Ravenspur had bribed him largely, and the monk had promi»ed him absolution for all the sins he might commit in their service The meeting of Gertrude and the Lady Ravenspur needs no description, p5
322 it would indeed be superfluous to detail that which every reader's heart will best supply Upon the introduction of Geitrude at eouıt as the heiress of the Fitzhugh estates, she was surrounded by admirers, yet she lefused them all, and Lady Ravenspur being surprised that none of the nobles gracing the court of Henry the Fourth of England should meet her wishes, asked hei one day, " if hei heait were really insensible, oi whethei it was pre engaged Gertrude's colour went and came, and at last throwing her arms round hei mothei s neck, she burst into tears " My beloved child, said the Countess, " My Gertrude, speak to me Who is the happy man that has lobbed thee of thy heart' ' With difficulty Gertrude disclosed to the Countess a weakness, foi so she termed it, whicli nevertheless she che ι ished, and at length frankly owned,
323
" that till she heard some tidings of thi. Lord Edward's uncertain fate, she never could listen to any tale of love " Now I do bethink me, ' replied the Countess of Ravenspur, " his family aie under much uneasiness respecting limi. He is a noble youth, my Gertrude, and heaven preserve hnn for thee Be com posed, my love, thou shalt not be mo lested by these trim and gallant lords We will straight to Ravenspur ' \s the Countess concluded this speech, Clod entered, saying, " He that would sleep in a sound skm should avoid monkish habits The Holy Virgin defend me from St Dominick, wlio do you thmk is dead, lady ? Why Tathei Rupert and the young Count is eithei dead or in prison, nobody knows which, and tlie Countess that was, is m great trouble, and she has at length tound out that honesty is the best policy, and that Clod was one of the wisest men in hei family.

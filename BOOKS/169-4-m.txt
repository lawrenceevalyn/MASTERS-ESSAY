The son of the storm: a tale
THE SON or THE STORM.
CHAPTER I. XIlS the common people of this country are remarkable for the asperity of their comments on the conduct of their supe- riours, so are they equally notorious for their ¿eal and adection, whenever those placed above them exercise their func¬ tions with mildness and humanity. They are as ready to exalt as deprecite, and in vot, iv. ■ the
the generous ardours of then itlachment, thcy consider life itself as a feeble sacri¬ fice, to those who have afforded them comfort in then iflliction, 01 protection in tho hour of danger. As this is a fact, too well authenticated to admit the pos- «ilnhtv of dispute, vve miy surely be al¬ lowed to wonder, that the easy terms held out for the love and affection of so hrge a portion of the common species, «hould either be rejected oi trifled away, by the very personages whose most apa¬ rent interest it shoultl seem to couit and to conciliate. Surely it is more gritifj- nig to possess the love, than the hatied of those among whom vve are destined to pass so many of our days ' The above remark, intended for the opening of our fourth and last volume, was suggested by the eager zeal, and am mated affection which all the sei vants of the Inn imbibed for Sir Arthui, as by some
some sympatetic attraction, after the re¬ cital of honest Hob, the men all swear¬ ing he was the finest, and the maids pro¬ testing he was the most handsomest young gentleman they had ever seen. This full chorus of according praise was at length put an end to, by the arrival of tho Hero of the Talc He smiled at Hob's anxiety, and then informed lnm of his own peipleMties with regard to the plan he was to puisne with respect to the horses. Bob told lnm he thought that he had bettei leave the management of the cat¬ tle to lnm, and then, he might, if he pleased, go up to Town himself m the mail, on Monday night. " Л good thought, Robert ' and you «hall set out in the forenoon lean do very well without you on Tuesday, only give me the key of my drawers before ii2 I

They arrived just as the coachman was mounting the box, and the mail about to start.— lhe «tep was let down — and scrambling in the dark, Sir Arthur placed himself on a corner of the back seat, next a young lady, who wa« guarded by a youth on the other side, and opposite sat a fat woman and an elderly man All was silent, until about a mile from Canterbury, the coach stopped to take up an outside passenger, when the oars ot br

The soft compission ite heart of Sir Arthur wis ill adipte.l to willi»tind the powerful appeal made to Ins humanity, by the muanings of the little cherub iloft He begged the young woman to descend, she immediately complied, ¡md the youth opening the coach dooi, solicited Miss Stevens to make mom for ayoun^, peison and her infant, to whom hr had resigned hi« place in the inside, not allovvino a single moment to be wast¬ ed m thanks, he hurried the mother and her precious burthen into the vehicle, holding the little mourner himself until the former wa« ready to receive it in her aim« Ihen vaulting like feathered Mercury into hi» seat on the box, the coachman followed hun, and they agam »et forward on then journey In a few moments the sky lowered, and every surrounding object was en- velopped m the shades of darkness, nn ngled
mingled rain and hail rattled on the top of the vehicle and the spirit of the tern pest loudly shrieked over the wild heath it was at that moment passing The light pepper and salt j toket of Sir Arthur not being by any mean« watei proof, he was soon wet to the skin The coach¬ man when the mischief wis completed, very kindly oflered hnn а great coat which offer he as imprudentiv accepted The run ind hail was shortly after succeeded by thunder and lightening, during which, the screams of Mis« Stc vens were pretty audible but the kind hearted youth at eveiy clap of thunder, and every flash of lightening calmly con¬ templated the effects ot the »torm—know ing that even the elements are not per¬ mitted to combat in vnn and that the voice of thunder or the vvhispei of zephyr are equally ι loductive of some unknown benefit to the univtrsil system The
The mild benevolence of his heart, also comtoitcd lum with α most cheanng as- smauce,-— Ivy eiitluuug the " pelting of " the pitiless storm" himself, he had saved а helpless young woman and α delicate infant, from an inconvenience, which might have proved tatal to one if not bolh of them. When they came to the end of their journey, he reaped a lull reward for his mconveniencie«, Ins dangers, and his dilliculties , the thanks of the mother, and the smile of the infant, were the in¬ estimable retributions of a heart replete with unsophisticated feeling, and genuine benevolence.

Sir Aithur, therefore, piomising ι ulier to ro¬ tum, or purchase it, with flic assistance of the )oung man in the shop, lifted the now greatly recovered Lord O'Carrol to the coach ; he ordered it to drive to Grosvenor Square, in preference to his Lordship's lodgings, knowing that he would there he in almost total solitude After they had proceeded some way, In« Lordship still lesting Ins burning head upon the shoulder of his )oung and hum¬ ous friend, said— ' Yithiii' \rthur 1 ' " Mj den.tl, u Loid' " You must'— ves, my drar boj, vou must do me an essential «mice 1 " " Oh, how willingly'" was the prompt

Sn
Sir Aithur promised a full compliance with this truly harmless requisition, and neither of them spoke another word until they w ere arnved at tbe door of the Duke of Monteastle Lord John immediately walked into the hhraiy, where he found his Grace deeply occupied with his studies. Sir Arthur, unseen by Lord John, conveyed α sign to the Duke, by which that noble¬ man clearly understood that his brother was in one of hi« temporary fits of insa¬ nity, anil took his leave to return to the Jewellers, on his voyage of discovery Young Conyers was somewhat curious lo knovv the seciet history of an apparent bauble, which had pioduced such stiong and vehement effects upon the heart and countenance of Lord John On entering the shop, he с tnieslly de¬ sired
sued to speak with the master m private. He put many questions to him, at the same time giving hint, indnectly, to un¬ derstand, that it was suspected the ring had been stolen. The Jewellei calmi) aiisweieil, that he hail purchased the article m question, of an old diamond meichant, who said he had it from α Jew Pedlar To this man the master of the shop oliere tl to send directly, as he was iu the habit of bu)ing old plate of lnm, or, that if Sir Arthui pleased, he would give him his address. The joutli gave the preteience to the luttel mode of proceeding, and being di- lectctl to Iloundsditeli, called d coach and drove oil to Moses Shacklefi«t». The son of Isræl happened to be at home, and replied without the least hesitation to Su Arthui's interrogatone», that he had pur¬ chased the ι ing of an old и oman at Green- i (> wich,
wich, whose address he immediately gave up. Poor Conyers, with all the natural im¬ petuosity of youth—his zeal quickened, rather than abated, by the difficulties he had to encounter, and never thinking of the account he vvould have to render of his long absence, walked to the nearest stable yard, ordered α post chaise, and drove off for Greenwich. Various were the conjectures whicli he formed during his ride, which being a solitary one, ap¬ peared protiacted to more than treble its real length. Frequently did he ask the driver how many centimes vvould pass ere they should reach the place of des¬ tination. " There's no sentnes," said the lad, " they be all sailors at Greenwich, youi honour."
The
The Baronet smiled at this misapplica¬ tion of his Jehus, and was diverted for a moment, but revolving thought igain bound him to the rack of suspence, and he relapsed into fretfulness and im¬ patience. The lad, in reality, drove in leal stile, antl as hard as his horses would gallop, for supposing from the youth of his pas¬ senger that he was indulging some school boy frolic, he was in hopes of being more liberally rewarded foi his velocity than his caution. When he alighted at the spot pointed ont by the Jew, he vv as somcw hat surpris¬ ed at the sight of the young w oman whom be had so humanely accommodated with his seat on his journey from Margate, she had her infant m her arm«, and seemed quite delighted at the agreeable, though unexpected rencontre To
To his question, whether an old wo¬ man of the name of Smith resided in that neighbouihood, she answered that she herself lodged with her, but that she was gone to London to spend the day, and that theie was more than а probability of hei remaining tho night also. Hearti'y vexed at his fruitless errand, and quite exhausted with his various mxieties, Sir Arthur began fo feel that ho had not taken the least refreshment since the morning He told the young woman, theiefore, that he vvould go to an Inn and dine, but would call again before be returned to town, to see whethei the old woman was come home. His hostess bluslnngly stammeied out— " If I might ventuie to make so bold Sn—I've some nice mutton ham, and some fresh eggs—and 1 should be so happy if so be as )ou vvould honour our
our poor place with eating a mouthful heie " " Oh ' with all my heart, and many thanks into the bargain, and I'll nurse my little fnend here, while you piepare." With these words he took the infant m Ins own arms, antl was quite enchanted with its quietude and beauty. He dis¬ played his watch for the amusement of the child, at the same time sighing at the lecolleetion it brought of little Dick Feiguson, and the melancholy fate of his patents. A stout good looking youth now enter¬ ed, whom the young woman introduced as Waltet Barry, her husband,—saying at the same time. " This, my dear, is the young gentle¬ man who was so veiy good to me when I came
cime fiom st eing mother at Deal, heis »о good as to nuise baby, while I broil lnm some of the mutton ham you bought me last week " The young man bowed, and respect¬ fully made an action of relieving his guest from the chaige he had undertaken. Sir Arthur informed lum of the cause, and motives of his journey, and under a promise of secrecy, gave lum to under¬ stand, that he suspected Mrs, Smith of having stolen an article of value. It was agreed, that the best mode of proceeding in this awkward and delicate affair, would be to leave a note for the old woman, stating, that if she would call at No. 5, Grosvenor Square, she vvould bear of something to her advantage Walter Barry promised, m case of her refusal to bring her up himsell, under some other pretence. Sir
Sır Arthur atter having citen a hearty meal, took nn oppoitiinity of folding up a gumen in а picee of paper, which he dropped, unperceived by either of the parents, into the cradle of the baby, as he «tooped to kiss it He then jumped into the chaise, and was driven to London on the full gallop Upon entering the drawing room of llic Duke of Montcasfle, he found his Grace and Lord John, (the ladies being now gone out) contemplating a pictuie which Laura Tempest had lately finished for Lord John. 1 he subject was, the rescue of herself and biother fiom the wivts The like- ne«s ot I oul lohn and Doctoi tilynne were irinulvably striking, old Intonivi« not omittu! imitiu Stoini vvas pourtriy- ed with lively e\ etituile Ilı iselt and Heniy weie lepiesent d, thessul exactly alike,

Lady Susan had too much natural gootl sense not to penetrate the tlun disguise of such an artifice as this, but had she thrown the «lightest impediment in the way ot her aunts «ehernes nt pleasure, she would have initiated bel to the height of ill humour, and the poor girl was now too much in the powei ot othcis to pretend to a will of her ow n, unci was, therefore, compelled to he dratrgeel about like a victim to the «icnfioe liei dress gay, but bei heart «vl.

IheLirl stated tint he felt his hetllli so visibly impared, that he resolved upon a voyage to Lisbon the ensuing spring He thert fore urged the propriety of having nntteis of such real and family importante, finally -imiiuj- ed previous to his departure, on «o long an expedition To convince the Duke of his real respect, and high ìegard for the young orphans, he also begged for the favour of their presence, with bis Grace's brother, Lord John After many debates, in which the mat¬ ter was art, ned with no simili vehemence on both sides, it was determined that the important request ot Deloraine ought to be complied with Doctor Glynne se¬ conded
coiided the oratorical powers of Μι« AnneSciidamore, who charmed at hiv¬ ing htm upon her side, was more eloquent than usual and when she understood that the Doctoi was to be of the party, she coultl hardly confine the soft tumult tint agitated her bosom She had im¬ agined that the worthy Doctoi had neg¬ lected her of late, this circumstance she had, however, attributed rathei to the hurry and bustle of a London lite, than to any falling off of her own charms, either of mind or person She felt а plea¬ sing assurance tint when they quitted the busy metropolis, the softer 'feelings would have a wider scope for action Love, she observed was а tenant of the groves, auditi the woodland siitele she hoped once moie to exert her fascinating attractions, and totally subdued the heart of the unwary Doctor
But
But m a proportionable degree to the pleasure of Mrs. Anne, was the bitter re¬ gret of her unfortunate niece. She dreed. ed the leaving Loudon in her present state of debts and difficulties. The af¬ front Stevens had lately received, would, she well knew irritate Ins sordid, savage disposition to the length of any species of revenge. She was more ternfied also by the account she heard of the young offi¬ cer, a fellow soldier of Lord Dalton's,who had been with them at the play. In consequence of the exchange of cards, he had sent a young Lieutenant to wait on Mr. Stevens. This worihy wight unacquainted with any of the rules of honour, had received his visitant m a most aukward, clumsy manner, the Lieu- tenant informed him, that he waited on hnn as the friend of Captain Godfrey.
" May
" May be so," cried Stevens, " and what does he want with me'" " He requests the honour of your company at Eleven o'Clock to-morrow at Chalk Farm." " I don't desire to have no such ac¬ quaintance if he had behaved as one gentleman ought to another, I shoud'nt have minded giving him a treat at Chalk Farm at all—if he thinks 1 can't a^tji d it, he has got the wrong sow by the lug * \ can tell him that. 1 will put guinea for guinea with any a he in the whole Re¬ giment " " Guinea for guinea, Mr. Stevens is out of the question."

" Bullet for bullet, ıs a little more to the puipose." 1 he eyes of Stevens here expanded to an enormous size —he staled, and gaped in the most ludieious mannei, and it was several moments before he coultl contrive tostammei out— " Why—wha—what do you mean'" " My meaning, Mr. Stevens is pretty plain , you have exchanged cards with a gentleman—" " Well, Sir " " Well, Sn '—then I suppose you in¬ tend to fight him'" " Y ou suppose so'"

matul hım to alter his determination, which vvoultl, he added be ever remem¬ bered by him as a personal obligation. By putting the matter in this point of view, Henry was almost certain of carry¬ ing the day against his benefactor it was the chord that made most harmony to his Lordship's heart He thu« smilingly replied. " To oblige you my dear Henry, is the only earthly consolation left youi heart broken fnend, yes, my young benefactor, I will lonseutto pleasure i/uit, to visit the mm who has otlendecl the most tender pait ot me.

only child—mv mother It was her for¬ tune to attract the love of ray father, a rich impetuous Spanish nobleman, bigot- ted in his religious, and political prin¬ ciples " Having no ones inclination but Ins own to consult, he made his proposals to my grandfather, they were accepted, though with somewhat of reluctance " The situation oi my ancestor was at that time both critical and distressing, his health impaired, and his fortune exhaust¬ ed he saw himself unaided and unnotic¬ ed in u foreign land for himself be cared but little, bred in camps, and used to all tbe vicisitudes of hardship, fatigue, and dangei:—like a sturdy oak, he could wave his branches in defiance to the storm, till the kind flash should destroy the rugged Irunk at слое, and finish thus his woes and
and p»ms, but а tender floweret bloomed under his protecting shadow, and that shelter once withdrawn, he trembled to recollect that it might droop its lovely head in the dark dell of poverty, or else be rudely plucked by some unfeeling hand, then cast away to wither m the wild—these were powerful appeals to а parental heart, and he felt every fibre tremblingly alive to the purity of his bnima. " The friendly grave seemed open to re¬ ceive him, and he felt at that moment, if he could secure his daughter from af¬ fliction, he could have welcomed death as his best friend " The prejudices of Don Gansalvo, gave him, indeed, many alarms, but as the Spaniard seemed willing to allow bis daughter the free exercise of her own re. ι 0 lıgıous
lıgıous principles, he surmounted all his scruples, and after a stated period, gave bis hnal consent to the marriage, and they were united 1 The day after the solemnization ot the awful ceremonv, my poor grandfather expired It is needle«« to sav, that the tears mv mother shed for the loss of so excellent a parent were bitter ones my fa'her exerted every effoit in his power to console her, and by his consent, she oi dered a rich and costly monument to be erected to the memory of the deceased, when this affectionate child had try'd, in somedegreeto rouseherself from theheavy calamity it had p'eased providence to afflict her withal she began gradually to resume the former spirits of her youth, her mind recovered its accustomed tone, and «he felt all a mother's raptures as she
gazed
gazed and saw тц eijes first opening on n world of misery " You may remember that I told you my grandfather had stipulated for the fiee choice of modes of worship for his daugh¬ ter, but, alas' the same privilege had not been promised to his grand children, this omission had proceeded from a lull confidence in the character of Don Gon¬ salvo, who had, in «o apparently liberal a manner, given up the question with re- gard to herself, Ihat she held it unfair to doubt the generosity of his intentions in other particulars. " Impressed with these sentiments, she took the earliest opportunity of in¬ stilling the tenets of protestantism into my, yet, pliant ductile mind " My father thinking me too young, as
yet, to be capable of forming any opinion« or ideas on the subject, deferred the sig¬ nification of his own intentions which were, that I should be educated in the faith of /us ancestors, resolving not to have my mind at all fettered or bewilder¬ ed with dogmas, I was, as he thought, incapable of comprehending he had fix¬ ed twelve years of age, as the period pro¬ per for my being enlightened, on the sub¬ ject of the sacred doctrines, setting his mmd, therefore, at ease, on this subject he never started the matter in my mothers presence, and she was thus allowed to pursue her own plans in private, and unnoticed " The time he had allotted, however, at length arrived, when my father one day introducing a venerable monk to me, or. dered ine to pay every attention to his instructions,
instructions, and left me with the holy man, alone. " The friar performed the charge in¬ trusted to him with the most rigorous fidelity, and believed me, like his other pupils, ready to yield up my reason to bis guidance, and put implicit faith in all he said or urged; he imagined that he had carried every point as my father could have wished it, " Oh! dissimulation' dissimulation! how sadmhow painful is thy practice '— how terrible—how mournful are thy con¬ sequences'" " Convinced of the stern, the unbend¬ ing disposition of my parent, 1 feigned belief of all tho confessor imparted to me, and with a trembling frame—a soul im¬ pressed with terrors and alarms, conform¬ ed
eel to all the alluring eeremonies the monk prescnbed. " Agonized,—doubting—distracting tiioughts bewildering my almost infant reason, I knew not what to thmk, or how lo act'—to play the hjhocnte on any subject was to me worse than death —on such a fatal theme as this —Oh ' spare me Heaven ! spare me the memory of what I then endured'—lather of mer¬ cies' thou who never pumshest the in¬ voluntary smntr—thou cunst witness for me that if my acts were blameful my heart was pure ' " At the age of little more than fifteen I became acquainted with an Englishman at the island of Madeira, his connexions were good, and he bore an excellent cha¬ racter, both as an officer and a man of honour " Here
" Here all my miseries began—I was credulou«, the voice of adulation had never before whi«pered m my ear« lhe theories of lehgiou had been the only dis¬ course« to which I had listened, Oh, then coneeivi with what added force the »ighs of a lovt r were armed against a beart, new to the impulses of all its tender fasci¬ nation»'------A correspondence was com¬ menced between us by means of an Eng¬ lish servant, who had lived with my mo¬ ther anterior to her marriage. " While I was carrying on these clan¬ destine schemes, my mind wa» dreadful to me the double deception which I was practtsing, made me tiemblo at the sight of both my parents, led bv inv fither to nn««, the iw fill ct remony curdled mv blond, and my ve nis seemed to iieeve , the solemn swell ot the organ rolled like the voice of tl under on mv astounded heanng—

'1 lie following year he returned, but in a temper and disposition which really terrified me " He remained in Madeira but a short time, and at the moment of departure told me he had deceived me m regard to his name, but in a fervent agony added— 1 Do not'—do not I conjure you'— ' think me the abandoned villam that ' с mid nun my lovely Limna —by tho powei tint formul me'—is I hope for mercy it Ins ¿re it throne ' o n marriage is ' Ugal, in the sft telat ù< usi '- A«k me not ' ^ìiij I am mysterious'—you rack —eon- ' vulse —

" By means of my mother's female servant, we had frequent opportunities ol meeting—but these interview« were gene¬ rally mixed with sadness, bitterness, and sorrows the first weeks of our marriage augured the dreadful ills which wait on violated duties " Again summoned to quit me, our parting was temblé —as we embraced, my heart sunk withm me—every object around me appeared red, as if viewed through a sanguine chrystal—my pulse was quick, and my whole frame dissor- dered he was equally agitated—his hand burned as I grasped it, and my tears were insufficient to allay the raging fever, he stammered out a promise of writing to me speedily—clearing his own honour— satisfying my doubts —with these words he left me—left me—never' never to 7 eturn ' ' Ob'
" Oh ι my good Sn, I see the tears of sjmpithy bedew your cheeks—you are softened by my sorrow»—With a mmd full ot apprehension and despair, I return¬ ed immediately home, and seating myself in an arm chair m my dressing room, gave way toa violent inundation of the bitterest tears—I had before shed many— but never '—never such scalding drops as these —my terrified imagination then took a dreary prospect round— α prospect full of shadows, clouds and darkness, without one cheanng point for fainting hope to rest a moment on " My husband was departed—he had promised to write to me lhere was com¬ fort, should he bieak that promise' dreadful' horrible' question —should I address a letter to him how η a« it to reach bim'—he hid confessed that the name, under which vve had been married, was

Then imagination piesented him falling in fight—seized with momentary death—expiring 'ere his last breath could perform the act of justice he wa« willing to fulfill —overwhelmed with these ciowding, thcbe teniile doubts, my brain began to turn—my reason began to wander " Го none but mothers can I appeal, when 1 fomiti iiit/selfhVe)y to become one.

plored him to respect thesamt-hke virtue; of my mother He spurned me from lnm with hie foot, and my shrieking parent caught me in her arms, buried m a toi rent of foaming blood.

As for you madam— ¡jou —you who have forfeited the duties of a wife, the affec tions of a husband as you have thus participated
participated the guilt of your daughter, doubt not butyou will likewise be a par¬ taker ot lier punishment'' " With thtse, terrible words he clapped the chamber door, wilh fury, on us, and we heard the key turn in the lock, as he appeared to rush down the staircase with hurried and uncertain steps. ' All now was silent honour, and ghastly stupefiction My mother first re¬ sumed that mental eneigy, which has been of so much use to both of us, in all the trying circumstances of human hfe. She embraced me in the most affection¬ ate manner assuring me, that all my past follies and neglects, were now totally ohhteiatcd horn her memory, and that she was pieparetl to endure with me, all the hardships which Don Gonsalvo could inflict. She warned me to expect the worst from Ins resentful rigour, she had к 3 often

" The tunc novv approached when 1 was to become α mother—in sorrow and confinement did I first press my two little ones to my heart, teais were the first gift which 1 bestowed upon my precious twins—but,Oh' when I recollected that their obduiate grandfather had tlneaten- ed to tear them from me, I was almost mad with anguish—my sighs were uu- ceasing—they toie my brain—they al¬ most burst my heart ' " My mother entered into all my feel. к 4 ings

With an heroic generosity of soul unequalled, she resolved to ease me of my fears, and sacrifice herself to save my little ones We corrupted the old man who attended us, by his menis the in¬ fants were conveyed to the female ser¬ vant, who had carried on the clandestine correspondence between my husband and m)»elf, and she received money, and or¬ ders to emhaik with them immediately for England· but never since I printed the last kiss of agonised affection on their ruby hp«, have I heard one word of nurse or infants. " I re«olved to follow them 'ere Don Gonsalvo, who with his brother was ab¬ sent on affairs of consequente, «bolliti return, and missing my dear babe«, in fur) and resentment, make me so close а pilsoner, a« to bar me from all possibility of enquiring into their destiny. I en¬ deavoured to persuade my mother to ac¬ company

CHAPTER VIII.
HEN Sır Arthur and Doctor Glynne put all the circumstances of the above narrative together, when they com¬ pared the time of Lord John's various ab¬ sences from Ins native land, they could not avoid a strong suspicion, of the fates of Mrs. Villars and bis Lordship being connected in some very strong, though mysterious
W
mysterious manner Every rising event, every passing conjecture tended to root them more deeply in this persuasion They knew not, however in what man¬ ner to act, and were for some time at a loss to regulate their future proceedings It soon occurred to young Conyeis, that the presence of Mr» Davies might in a great measure assist them in unn vpllıng this clue He wrote immediately to William Barry and requested him to lure α chaise on the reception of his letter and to in¬ sist on the old woman accompanying lnm on the expedition, is events of the most serious nature then depended on their mutual presence The affair of Lord Dilton, now se nously employed the attentions of the Deloraine and Monteastle families Henry lempest exerted all his influ- ene
ence in persuading that young Nobleman of the duty by which he was bound to sacrifice his own private gratifications to the honour and happiness of a parent, whose conduct had ever been signalised by a peculiar fondness and indulgence to him in particular Dalton parried this argument, by ask¬ ing Henry in return, if it was allowable to approach the sacred altar of the most high with a falsehood—if it was honour¬ able to swear eternal affection to one woman, when those very affections were irrevocably given to another. This was too conclusive a manner of putting the question to allow Tempest to urge the matter any further Lord Glengannon now only waited for a final letter from the Earl of Debraine , on the receipt of which, it was his Lord¬ ships
»hip's intention to leave Scotland and bring the Lady Sigismunda to join the party now assembled. Poor Woodville still continued in his own apartment, а prey to langoin, illness, and unconquerable regret Thus a« it too frequently happens in the most allur¬ ing promises of human life a sudden cloud had intervened, and obscured the ex¬ pected brightness of the scene, antl they vv ho had met to enjoy the social smile of universal happiness, were condemned to the endurance of the deepest melancholy, the most general dejection. Many days rolledover in this uncom¬ fortable manner, letters armed from Saville, stating the sincere and unaffected penitence of Latly Susan, whose days and nights passed in bitter, but in uniepiiimg grief and tear«.

The amvıl of Mrs Davı«, with Willi nn Harry, made it nccess uy for the minds of Sir Yitltui anil Dxtor Glynne tosinko ой the genual torpei which had by this time pervaded the whole famdy, and exert then enneigies in the most active manner, Lord John O'Carrol w as now so weak and ill, that they feared he w ould not long «urvive the many violent ravages his nn happy disorder had made upon his con¬ stitution the Doctor felt assured, that if the pressent mystery eould be elucidated he might die in ¡euce and this was a consolation so infinitely beyond all value, that the worthy Givone would chctr fully have saculicid every thing he pos «essed in the woild to pocure so mesti niable а treisurc for the wretched Lord O Cu rol 1 he confessions, estorteci from the re¬ luctant
luetant Mrs Davies, tended to confirm all which had been so deeply impressed upon the mind of Glynne, and the youth¬ ful Haronet Ihey dispatched a seivant with all speed to Lady Susan O'Carrol, at the house of Mr Saville, the messenger bore a letter from Sir Arthur, requesting her to send Iwck hy the bearer, the minia¬ ture picture which had been given her hj Lord John he promised to return it with the most punctual fidelity, but most earnestly conjured her not to refuse his petition, as circumstances ot the most in· ti resting, and affecting nature might de¬ pend on her compliance or denial 1 he man lelurned with speed, bunging tin miniatuie carefully encased in a «mall box of ι ed morocco fhis picture Doctor Glynne cainetl with him to the house of Mrs Villar«
He
He also made the tiemblin? Mrs. Davies bear lnm company , ordei ing lit r a« he as- sended, to wait below till she should be called for. After an hours conversation with this lady, the Doctor returned to Sn Arthur, and told him, all was as they suspected. He then began to state the occurrences of his late visit, the circumstances of which were briefly thus ------ The Doctor had used every caution in breaking the matter to pool Mrs. Villars. He first informed her, that affected by her story, he had used every method to dis¬ cover the family of her husband She appe ired most truly grateful, and sincere¬ ly tbanklul for his solicitude He then hinted to her, that he believed his re¬ searches had been ciowned by some de- giee of success, at last, after using every argument which could raise and fortify a human
burnin mind, to endure the contempla¬ tion of the wonder working hand of pro¬ vidence —when he saw, that her soul sublimed by reflecting that what is im¬ pervious to the human eye, may be pierc¬ ed with ease by that of an all seeing deity—he ventured to produce the minia¬ ture. The religious fervour which had just before absorbed every faculty of her mind, did not here desert her, both her surprise and emotion weie less than could bave been expected. Tears streamed down her care-worn pallid countenance, as she exclaimed— "Oh' yes' ye« 1 yes'—such are tbe features of lnm who first lured me from the path» of duty '—from the ways of peace'—Tune his stolen the bloom from the cheek, but memoiy—faithful, pain¬ ful mentor) ' has graved this form too deeply
deeply in my heart for feeble time to in¬ jure, or impair it. Oh' mypoorchildrcn 1 " Here the tears gushed m torrents; the capious shower relieved her, and she remained most wonderfully composed. She learned that Lord John was the man who had so cruelly deceived her, she was somewhat agitated when she learned how much he had suffered upon her account. It was explaned to her, that the account of the earthquake which had swallowed her parents had arrived in England with the greatest speed and accu¬ racy That Lord John's inquiries after her had been soleh/ checked by a firm conviction, that «he had likewise pe¬ rished by that terrible scourge, that at- flirting calamity. All Ins Lordship's wild incoherent starts were now explaned, His agitation at hearing of convulsions ot the earth. His agony at the memoiy of In« fattici .
lie was haunted with the idea of having broken a solemn promise, given to his parent, and tbe memory of his conduct to both him and his poor wife, had prey¬ ed upon his heart and brain, like the un¬ wearied Vulture of the Pagan Fable. Lady O'Carkol, (for we shall now no longer call her by the name of Mrs Villars) vvas most sensibly affected at this narcitive, and wished immediately to fly to the arms of her suffering husband, and assure him of her forgiveness. The rea¬ sons Doctor Glynne gave, why she should forbear, till he was prepared for so pathe¬ tic, so unexpected a seene, operated upon her mmd with all the torco of conviction The Doctoi left her to her prayers, for in llehgion, only, could she hope to calm the tempest which had lately been excited in her mind That
That Henry and Lam a were the chil¬ dren of Lord John O'Carrol, no longer admitted a possibility of a doubt. They cautiously interrogated Mrs. Davies, confronted her with old Ben, who re¬ collected her well enough to be one of the nurses, of «the children, whom he had taken out of the French Privateer It seems the old Woman had been washed ashore, in the storm, described in volume the first—had been hospitably received by some Cottagers on the coasts and having a great many of the Jewels belooging to the Infants in her posses¬ sion, had resolved to carry them with her to London, and never to trouble her head any further in inquiring whether they had gone to the bottom or no. If the reader remembers the «tory of poor Ferguson, he may call to mind her adventures since that period the que stions
quistion» of Lord John's (vide volume the first) had so Unified her, conscious asshe wis, of having made awiy with so much property which did not be long to her, that she bid hurried aw rv Irom her lesidence, changed her name, md might nevermore have been heard of, had not providence enabled Sir Arthur agiin to discover her by the means of Harry and his Wife The interrogatori! s put to her «he f iithfitltv answered, ıııd the whole senes of ei ents exittly corre¬ sponded to the suspicions of the pirtu« e oncerned Such is the buef sketch of the interest ing particulars delivered by Glynne to Conyers The Doctor hid not icepi un ted Lady O'Carrol with the miiaculou» preservation of hci infant», becinse bis skill in his professi )n informed bun, that the accumulation even ol jO)ful events aie fiequently too oveibeaiing vol iv ι toi
foi weak nerves, and exhausted consti¬ tution«. To make Lord John acquainted with these sudden revolutions, was a cucum- «tance, also, which seemed to require the most delicate attention. It was necessary, however, that the meeting should be speedy, as the precarious health of Lord O'Carrol, would not admit of great delays or long protractions.

í HE illness of Lord John O'Carrol was now pronounced 1 ita!. His tenois, doubts, and uncertainties weie of the most alarming natuie, but, it was evi- dent that if any thing could reconcile him to Ins lot, it vvoultl be the know¬ ledge of the leeovery of Ins lost infants, and the certainty of the existence and forgiveness of the lady so long known to the readei by the name of Mrs. Villars. 1.2 'ihe

forgiveness for the sorrows he had heap¬ ed upon her head, her countemnce shone with a ny of piety that exalted it into something almost supernaturil. Every lineament of her fine counttn mce gloved with а divine fervour, nul the spirit of affliction was irradiated with those beams of which female fortitude alone can he susceptible.

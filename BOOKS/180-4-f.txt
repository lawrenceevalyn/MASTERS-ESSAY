C0N3HIVI, TitAisSPOiiT, delight, gratitude, alternately heaved the fuil heart of Flodoaldo, when, accompanied by his father, accompanied Ъу the Duca di Monte Melissano, he en¬ tered the presence of the blushing Hemel«- fride ; when, habited in the chaste robes ol
of her se\, the lovely novice of Coipus Domini whispered coogiatulalion, and, shrinking in bashful difi.dence, exchanged the wann ardour of the sensitive Isidore, for the mild dignitv, the feaiful ucpida- tion, the glowing characteristic of angelic woman Glorjing in a pission wluch fite had mule eternal, abo\c the subtei- fugc of disguiSL, abo\e the aıtıfiec or co¬ quetry, she sighed an acknowledgment of her prepossession , and when Di Mon¬ trinzo dwelt on the tale of hne, dwelt on the gridual expansion of her influence, dwelt on the bnth of hope, dwelt on the ad¬ muation her picture had excited, she owned the past doubts, the past despondency of her feelings, she owned that, in the sohtaiy turret at Montranzo, Io^e had often tinc¬ tured the sigh which nominated misfor¬ tune had excited. Such were the sentiments of the lovers, such the opening prospects of felrcity, when duty and inclination alike urged their
their return to Ombrìi, when, with the rising sun, they quitted the populous sub- iiibs of Rome, and, from the noisy bustle of the world, returned to the calm quiet of retirement. Ah ' how diferent their sensations, to when the Tiber's sparkling waves first broke upon their sight, when in bondage, m misery suspected, reviled, the ray of hope but dimly gleamed, then Flodoaldo thought not a being, save Isidore, was interested in his happiness, now Isidore was lost—but a father, a mis¬ tress, like the phcenix, had sprung from the astles of fnendship—a father, a mistress, revered, honoured, loved, smiled on his hopes, and fanned him on to bliss A tear hung upon the glowing cheek of Hemelfude, as, from the rapid course of the river, her eyes turned upon her fa¬ ther—' When last I traced yon current," she murmured The Duca entered into her feelings— " Forget it, my child," interrupting her. "On»
"Oh' never, never'" she resumed, " the contrast serves but to augment my present felicity When last I beheld the fiber, ita waves, as now, rolled in ceaseless monotony yes, from age to age, m sul¬ len murmur, it pursues its course, heedless of the wreck of worlds—of the lapse of time But man—' she paused, then, with a quickening blush, concluded—" When a prisoner I traversed its banks, my guards pitied me, my questions they dared not answer, but my teais, mv sighs, my jgita- tion moved them ' " Those le irs, those sighs, that agitation, was for me, ' said Di Montianzo, as with grateful feivour, he pressed her hand " And yet they thought it giatitude," softly observed Hemelfride " I should have read the disguise—I should have been moie quirk sighted," exclaimed the Duca "The varying hue of that cheek, my child, would have be¬ trayed the secret ' " 1 did suspect the disguise," said Fa¬ ther
ther Luitľiido; " I did suspect the ex¬ istence of two beings so exaclly similar ; not from the outward foim, but from the fervour, the ardoui of chaiacter. I hid felt the foice of love," with a hilf-atnotheied sigh, " and when you, my beloved son, dwelt on theiomantic enthusiasm of Isi¬ dore's atl.it hment, my heart admitted a doubt of Isidore's existence " " Oh, had I been as quick-sighted, ' ex¬ claimed riodoaldo, " what soirow, what difficulty had been avoided ' ' " As how ?" interregnul Hemelfride. " By uniting our destinies, niy sweet novice, and (lying whither Iortunc could not persecute " "Had you breathed a suspicion of the disguise," said Hcmellnde, and her lovely features assumed a momentary sadness, ** I had flid the Castle—your dwelling had no longer screened me.

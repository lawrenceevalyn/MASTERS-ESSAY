To glimmering shades and sympathetic glooms." 

JDe Montville was not the only person 
who had cause for agitation this day. Soon 
after breakfast, Helena and the girls stroll- 
ed into the wood, and after proceeding a 
little way, the sun being hot, threw them- 
selves on the grass, under the shadow of a 
magnificent beech. Here, as they indo- 
lently reclined, listening to the murmur- 
ing of the surge below, and watching the 
chirping grasshopper, the discourse gra- 
dually turned on Mountflorence, whom 
both the girls concurred in declaring was 
a very altered creature within the last few 
weeks. Helena did not dissent in opinion

with them, only secretly with regard to 
time, it being only within the last few days 
that he appeared altered to her. What 
could have caused this alteration â€” what 
the cold reserve and distance that had suc- 
ceeded the frankness and kindness of his 
previous manner, and what the conjectures 
to which the circumstance would have 
given rise, but for the incident in the cave? 
was it owing to any reflection respecting 
her conduct towards lord Glena, or her im- 
prudence with regard to sir Osbert ? or was 
it the result of a proud determination 
to shun her, since their fortunes were 
not more equal? Yes, this must be the 
reason of it ; for did he not seem to have 
forgot about lord Glena, and had he not 
himself suggested excuses for her entan- 
glement vvdth sir Osbert ? and what other 
cause therefore could she assign for it? 
But this too scrupulous delicacy must be 
conquered, this dread of confirming the 
invidious rumours that had once been cir- 
culated at the expence of his mother ; but 
in what way, or by what means, sedulously 
shunning her, as he evidently did ? and she 
was perplexing herself by the question, at

the very moment the girls commenced 
speaking about him. " I am aware," said 
Dorinda, *' that he has much to disturb 
him in his unsettled affairs â€” more, I fear, 
than he has allowed mamma or any of us 
to understand ; still, from the command I 
know, in general, he has over himself, I 
think there must be something besides, to 
occasion that continual absence of mind 
he has latterly betrayed." 

" I should not wonder," observed Caro- 
line, 'â€¢' if he were despairingly in love ; for 
he has some of the symptoms of a hopeless 
passion about him." 

" Are you so versed in these symptoms, 
Miss Carohne, as to be able to pronounce 
at once about them ?" asked Helena, with 
a faint laugh ; " but who do you think 
may be the object of this despairing pas- 
sion, if indeed experienced ?" 

" Why, sometimes I guess one person," 
replied Caroline, with a sly glance at her, 
" sometimes another." 

" And sometimes a third," said Mount- 
florence, advancing from behind the tree, 
where he had been laughingly Hstening to

them for the few last minutes. " So, la- 
dies, honouring me by making me the 
theme of conversation ?" 

" As if we were not aware all the time 
that you were hearkening to us," said Ca- 
roline : " but come, since by your own 
confession you have overheard us, can you 
declare that I am in error with regard to 
you?" 

" Perhaps to do so would be of no use?" 

" No, certainly, for I am confident I am 
right." 

" Have you never heard, my dear little 
girl, that we should never be confident of 
any thing?" 

" Oh ! yes, but I don't mhid all I have 
heard." 

" That," laughing, " may readily be be- 
lieved by any one who has the felicity of 
knowing you ; but, seriously, have I not 
already asked you what business a soldier 
would have to fall in love ?" 

" Business ! why the same, I suppose, 
that every other person has ; besides, how 
could he help it ?" 

" By shifting his quarters whenever he 
found there was danger." 



CONTRAST. 5 

Â« What, running about the world to 
avoid falling in love ! that would be one 
of the most curious plans I ever heard of 
for the purpose, and one I am not much 
inclined to think you would be quite silly- 
enough to adopt â€” or, at least, if you did, 
you would be able to follow. Now, for in- 
stance, do you think you could possibly run 
away from any one like Helena or me ?" 

" Why, it might be difficult, but still it 
would be wise." 

" Well, no matter ; so come, say what 
kind of a sister are you going to give us ?" 

" By your own account, I am not going 
to give you one at all ; for have you not 
said I was in despair?" 

" Oh ! that was to provoke you to con- 
tradict me, and so betray yourself." 

" The plan has failed ; for I shall do 
neither the one nor the other." 

" You are really teazing. Til get He- 
lena to question you, for you'll not answer 
her in the way you do me." 

" You'll scarcely prevail on her to ask 
about what she cannot be interested in 
knowing ; but if you should, I'll positively 
answer her." 



6 CONTRAST. 

" You will ! then if she does not, I'll as 
positively never forgive her." 

" Very well," still retaining his air of 
badinage ; "but as all confessions are made 
in private, I must take her away with me," 
and he took the hand of Helena. 

Helena knew not what came over herâ€” 
a tremor, a confusion that made her invo- 
luntarily draw back the hand thus taken ; 
Mountflorence coloured, and telling the 
girls he would no longer intrude upon 
them, abruptly turned away. 

Helena could almost have wept from 
vexation ; why had she not been more col- 
lected â€” why not able to maintain a better 
command over her nerves? Evidently 
hurt by what was involuntary on her part, 
he would not again seek for any particular 
opportunity of conversing with her ; and 
that distance of manner which on this 
morning had so suddenly given way to 
his usual one, would again be resumed, 
from wounded pride, if from no other cause. 
Something attracted her companions 
from her: more inclined to think than to 
speak, instead of awaiting their return. 



CONTRAST. 7 

she hastened from the place where they 
had left her. She had not proceeded far, 
when she saw jMountflorence stretched 
under a tree, reading ; she drew back, but 
not with such quickness that he did not 
perceive her. 

He directly started up and joined her. 
Helena again felt confused, both from not 
expecting to have found him where she 
did, and the reflection of what had just 
occurred. â€” " Don't let me disturb you," 
she said, " or rather, for that I have done, 
don't give up your pleasant shelter on my 
account, for I am just returning to the 
house ; and in this sultry weather it must 
be delightful enough to play the part of 
the moralizing Jacques, by * losing the 
creeping hours of time,' beneath the shade 
of melancholy boughs." 

" Ere we can decide that, we must first 
understand the feelings that lead to their 
shelter," replied Mountflorence. 

" Not confessing to melancholy ?" said 
Helena, rallying herself a little ; ** take 
care of this in a certain quarter, if you do 
not wish to confirm the suspicion there 
entertained." 



8 CONTRAST. 

" And is melancholy, in the opinion of 
Miss Rossglen also, an indubitable sign of 
the passion ?" 

" I really don't know : but I have rather 
heard " 

" In my turn, let me caution you," said 
Mountflorence, with arch significance, a- 
gain recovering his wonted manner; " for 
have I not, more than once, seen Miss 
Kossglen in pensive meditation lost, stray- 
ing beneath these trees ?" 

" Me ! oh yes, often, I dare say ; but 
then pensiveness is natural to woman ; she 
is naturally a sentimental creature, given 
to glimmering shades, and sympathetic 
glooms ; but when man, so different in all 
his propensities, betrays an inclination of 
the kind, 'tis naturally ascribed to some 
feeling connected with the heart." 

" Well defined ; but suppose I were to 
confess the truth, would you give me your 
pity?" 

" I must first know how you are en- 
titled to it." 

" Why, by acknowledging that I have 
not been unjustly suspected of being in â€” 
love!" 



CONTRAST. 9 

" No, I don't see how that could en- 
title you to pity." 

" What if I should declare it love with- 
out hope?" 

" Oh ! I should only laugh at the asser- 
tion, from not exactly crediting it ; or say 

that " 

" What ?" demanded Mountflorence, 
eagerly. 

" Why, that to love without hope im- 
plied despair, and that no one should de- 
spair who had not first tried whether there 
was cause for it." 

" That is, in other words, till they had 
told their love ; but are there not a thou- 
sand ways of declaring this â€” do not looks, 
and sighs, and nameless attentions ?" 

" Perhaps so ; but as there is a possibi- 
lity of being deceived by these, a lady, I 
should suppose, would be very unwilling 
to reply to such language alone ; and if 
this, therefore, be the only way in which 
you have expressed your sentiments, I 
conceive you have no â€” no positive grounds 
for despair." 

" But to what purpose should I be more

10 CONTRAST, 

explicit, knowing, as I do, that there are 
obstacles insurmountable to the attain- 
ment of my wishes ?" 

" Well, of that you must be the best 
judge; but don't you think it possible that 
â€” that notions of disinterestedness may be 
carried too far? Ere you imposed this 
rigorous silence on yourself, should you 
not first have been satisfied that it was 
only youi^self you pained by the circum- 
stance ?" 

Mountflorence started â€” " Oh, could I 
but imagine that to another breast than 
my own, I caused unhappiness by the si- 
lence I have imposed ! how could I no, 

I fear I could not have resolution to per- 
sist in it." 

Helena's colour varied ; she could hardly 
support herself; how could she bring her- 
self to be more explicit ? yet having gone 
so far, if she now drew back, how could 
she ever have courage to resume the sub- 
ject, to make another attempt to have 
herself understood? No, this minute must 
be decisive : yet to be compelled to speak 
more intelligibly â€” but there was an excuse 
in the peculiarity of her situation, for thus 



CONTRAST. 11 

doing violence to her natural feelings, and 
those of her sex; and â€” " I am, however, 
rather inclined to believe it is the case," 
she said, but with half-averted eyes. 

Mountflorence dropped her hand, and 
drew back, as if to be better enabled to read 
her countenance. â€” " May I think this ?" 
he said, in a tone of rapture ; " but no, no, 
I cannot â€” I must not â€” that is," he added, 
falteringly, and again approaching her, 
** without first, at least, knowing how you 
came by â€” by the â€” knowledge of her real 
sentiments ? for I did not conceive your 
acquaintance sufficiently long to have cre- 
ated any mutual confidence." 

Oh, the shock sustained by Helena at 
that moment ! â€” " Her sentiments !" she 
faintly and unconsciously repeated. 

" Yes," replied Mountflorence, but with 
a cheek now nearly as colourless as her 
own â€” " the sentiments of â€” " but eagerly 
extending his arms to catch her â€” " you 
know not what I am saying â€” you are 
fainting." 

" No," cried Helena, making an effort 
to keep herself from sinking, " I am only 



12 CONTRAST. 

a little sick â€” the heat of the sun is so in- 
tense." 

" What can I â€” what shall I do for you?" 
asked the agitated Mountflorence ; " will 
you sit down ? or shall I conduct you to 
the house ?" 

" If you please," said Helena, trembling 
in every limb as she took his arm, and rais- 
ed her handkerchief to wipe away the cold 
dew that had gathered on her brow, at the 
same time brushing away the tears that 
shame, disappointment, and regret, wrung 
from her ; " though I am already better," 
she added, uncovering her face ; but her lips 
were white and quivering, and the smile 
that accompanied the assertion was of a 
description to make Mountflorence close 
his eyes for a moment : he groaned. 

"What's the matter?" asked Helena, 
faintly, as for a minute she paused to lean 
against a tree. " You too are not ill ?" 

" Oh, heart-sick !" cried Mountflorence, 
suddenly turning away, and as suddenly 
returning to her; " but what matters it 
what I am ? â€” let me support you to the 
house, lest you should again be overcome 
by the heat." 



CONTRAST. 13 

At the entrance they parted ; and He- 
lena, repairing to her chamber, bolted her- 
self in, to prevent intrusion : to no mortal 
would she have had known the emotions 
under which she was labouring â€” labouring 
through her own precipitate folly; for 
would any one but herself have decided 
on acting as she had done, without first 
having ascertained, to a certainty, that 
there was no error in the surmise that led 
to it. 

Why had she suffered herself to be be- 
trayed into such a mistake ? â€” why to let 
a mere flattering inference betray her into 
such a one ? â€” why to put a forced con- 
struction upon the recent conduct of 
Mountflorence â€” that conduct, which, if 
rightly interpreted, would have saved her 
from all she was now enduring â€” the shame 
of reflecting she had offered her heart but 
to have it rejected ; for could she hope â€” 
could she flatter herself, with having been 
misunderstood ? Oh, no, no ! she was 
conscious she had spoken but too intelli- 
gibly ; that with his acute discernment, it 
was not probable he could be deceived : 
she would then meet his eyes no more ; 



14 CONTRAST. 

she would feign indisposition, to confine 
herself to her chamber, until she had ob- 
tained her father's permission to leave 
Woodston ; and could she so readily tear 
herself away from the dear domestic circle 
that had so attached her there ? No ; she 
felt it was beyond her power; and what 
had she to dread from such a mind as 
Mountflorence's ? â€” what allusion â€” what 
look â€” what indication of internal triumph ? 
No; from all these she was satisfied she 
was secure; and would not the feelings 
that afforded her this conviction, incline 
him to do justice to hers? â€” to ascribe to 
the true cause a generous wish to save him 
all apprehension of being accused of 
artfully ingratiating himself with her ? 
But who was the happy, the envied ob- 
ject, for whose sake her heart, as it were, 
had been thrown back to her ? Conjecture 
pointed to Adelaide ; but there were still 
some considerations that opposed the ab- 
solute belief of her being the person. But 
what mattered it, to ascertain this ? â€” the 
pain, the regret, attendant on finding him 
attached to another, would not be lessened 
by knowing who the precise object of that 



CONTRAST. 15 

attachment was. Yet she felt a curiosity 
on the subject, and much she wished she 
had been able to have commanded herself 
sufficiently to have allowed him to disclose, 
as he seemed on the point of doing â€” but 
she had no control over herself. She was 
so easily elated, so sanguine in expectation, 
so confident in hope, or the slightest en- 
couragement to hope, that disappointment 
was a shock she could hardly sustain ; but 
she must begin to try and moderate these 
too ardent feelings; she must begin to 
prepare herself for those casual shocks and 
incidents that are daily occurring. Tears 
could not be restrained. â€” " And thus ends," 
she sighed to herself, " the fond dream in 
which I have been indulging, of retrieving 
the fortunes of Mountflorence â€” of re-es- 
tablishing him in the ancient mansion of 
his forefathersâ€” of indeed becoming the 
loved daughter of lady Rossglen, and bind- 
ing myself to the dear circle here, by a 
link not to be severed." 

Though, as already intimated, she could 
not flatter herself that Mountflorence had 
misunderstood her, still, as there was a 
bare possibility that this might be the case, 



16 CONTRAST. 

she determined on acting in such a way 
as should prevent any sospicion, if not 
previously excited ; and accordingly made 
no unnecessary delay in her dressing-room. 

Mountflorence's looks and manner were 
as usual ; and this, united to his seeming 
to ascribe her sudden indisposition in the 
wood to the effect of the intense heat, 
created a hope of being safe ; but when, 
in the course of dinner, she caught him 
regarding her, with an earnestness such as 
she had never before observed him con- 
templating her with, and that too with an 
expression of deep dejection, she could not 
help fearing she was indeed committed. 

To avoid watching him and Adelaide 
was impossible ; but the observations she 
made neither tended to remove or confirm 
her vague idea of an attachment between 
them. Such was the case with De Mont- 
ville ; but this might be owing to artifice 
on their parts, he reflected ; and that very 
evening he decided on making an effort 
for freeing himself from those tortures 
which he experiences, 

" Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves." 

Accordingly, instead of returning to 



CONTRAST. 17 

Rockcliffe in the carriage with lord Le 
Poer, he asked Mountflorence, who was 
going to St. Finian's that night, for a seat 
in his curricle. They had not proceeded 
a great way, when laying hold of his com- 
panion's arm, to make him check the 
horses â€” " Mountflorence," he said, " I 
wish to speak to you particularly." 

" Indeed ! then make use of the present 
opportunity." 

" It is a question I have to ask : tell 
me â€” answer me sincerely â€” but that I am 
persuaded you will â€” Do you love Ade- 
laide?" 

" Do I love Adelaide !" repeated Mount- 
florence, with a laugh, and again touching 
the horses â€” " Yes, I do indeed; but don't 
despair, or challenge me to single combat, 
before I can explain â€” only as a friend or 
relation. And now, in my turn, to put a 
question to you â€” What gave rise to this 
inquiry ?" 

" I don't know," replied De ]\Iontville, 
somewhat confused ; " but I â€” I believe, 
the idea that an attachment between you 
might have been the probable consequence 
of those attentions you paid her, before 



18 CONTRAST. 

she was noticed by any of her other con- 
nexions." 

" Well, happily for us, such has not 
been the result of them ; for circumstanced 
as I am, and solely dependant on an ar- 
bitrary parent, as she is, an attachment 
between us would have been a very sad 
business." 

" Then I may dismiss the apprehension 
altogether from my mind ?" 

" Except it amuses you to entertain it." 

" Amuses me ! But you are not of- 
fended by my having given utterance to it ?" 

" No â€” I am not apt to be easily offended." 

" More especially in this instance, you 
have no cause," said De Montville, 
" when I assure you, it was my determi- 
nation, had an attachment been acknow- 
ledged between you and Adelaide, to have 
immediately resigned all pretensions to 
her hand, and to the utmost of my power 
advocated your wishes with her father." 

" I make no doubt of your being suffi- 
ciently generous to have done so ; but I 
rather think not all your exertions would 
have availed to prevent injury to Ade- 



CONTRAST. 19 

laide, from his anger at the failure of his 
original plan regarding her. The only 
way, in such a case, to have acted, would 
have been, if you wished to shield her from 
his resentment, to have protested against 
his project on your own account, without 
allowing him to think she was reluctant 
to it: but don't be alarmed," seeing De 
Montville regarding him intently ; " you 
are not going, you know, to be put to such 
a test of disinterestedness." 

" No, thank Heaven !" said De Mont- 
ville ; " I should have grieved indeed to 
have found a rival in my friend. But there 
is another question or two I wish to ask 
you : though you have not aspired to, or 
rather obtained, the heart of Adelaide, do 
you imagine " 

" I can answer no question that does 
not concern myself," cried Mountflorence, 
abruptly. " But will you let me drive 
you on to the castle, for here we are come 
to the place where you said you would 
alight?" 

" No, it's not worth while â€” the path 
across the fields is so short," springing 
from the curricle as he spoke. 



20 CONTRAST. 

Well, there was now an end of his 
doubts with regard to Mountflorence ; and 
should he be destined to find he had a ri- 
val, he should at least be spared the pain 
of finding him in the person of his friend. 
This was a relief; but still only a partial 
one. He had his fears; he began to be 
convinced that Adelaide had some other 
reason for h^r determined opposition to 
their immediate union, than the silly one 
he had in the first instance assigned for it. 
To confirm this persuasion, the manner in 
which his mother had evaded his query, as 
to why she had left her protection, and 
her expression that when she saw him she 
was sure she would like him, recurred to 
his recollection ; and finally, he determined 
that the ensuing day should force Ade- 
laide to be explicit with him. 

While he was torturing himself with 
fears that might prove groundless, Helena 
was again shedding tears over the over- 
throw of her fondest hopes. The spirits 
that pride had been an incentive to sup- 
porting, while liable to observation, forsook 
her, when again in her chamber, she was 
at liberty to indulge her feelings. Of 



CONTRAST. 21 

what avail her splendid fortune, her nu- 
merous advantages, failing as they had 
done to obtain for her the happiness she 
had set her heart on? and disappointed 
of which, like a froward child, she felt dis- 
posed to spurn at whatever else could be 
ofiPered for the purpose to her acceptance : 
but this state of mind did not long conti- 
nue : her feelings were impetuous ; but 
she was neither weak nor forgetful of be- 
ing an accountable being; and gradually 
she began to blush at the reflection of 
those she had given way to â€” at the thought 
of being one of those selfish beings, who 
only estimate life, as they can render it 
subservient to their own enjoyment. With 
such blessings as she had, to bend in gra- 
titude to a bounteous Providence for, to 
give way to such repinings, because disap- 
pointed in one fond wish, what base ingra- 
titude â€” what utter dereliction of her duty ! 
but she would struggle to better command 
herself As these reflections occurred, all 
the enthusiasm of her character revived ; 
and what generosity might not the disap- 
pointment she had experienced afford her 
an opportunity of practising ? through her 



22 CONTRAST. 

means, might not the obstacles to the hap- 
piness of Mountflorence be removed, and 
thus his esteem, his regard, his lasting 
friendship, secured to her? and she sat 
revolving a thousand wild and improbable 
plans, considering the character of Mountflo- 
rence, for the purpose, until surprised by the 
grey dawn of morning through the shut- 
ters. She opened a window to look abroad ; 
the grey mists of night still hung over the 
sea, shrouding the distant cliffs and head- 
lands, and all was still, cold, silent, and 
cheerless: but soon the scene began to 
brighten, the kindling east to announce 
the coming of the god of day, at whose 
approach the mists and exhalations of the 
night quickly rolled away, as if to give 
the bosom of the earth to his full efful- 
gence; while all that seemed previously 
drooping, revived, and amidst the waking 
of nature from repose, the speckled lark, 
rising from his bed of tufted grass, was 
heard soaring, with notes mellifluous, to 
heaven's gate. 

Helena could not immediately withdraw 
from the contemplation of such a scene â€” 
a scene for the enjoyment of which the 



CONTRAST. 23 

enthusiasm she had just yielded to had 
prepared her. As she gazed upon the 
rising sun â€” " Well might the heathen 
world mistake thee for the proper object 
of their adoration !" she cried, " best image 
of thy jNIaker here below â€” pure source of 
light, and heat, and comfort, who, without 
the assistance of any other fire, diffuses all 
these blessings through a thousand realms, 
and not confining thy munificence to 
realms only, extendest thy enlightening 
influence to surrounding worlds â€” prime 
cheerer of the animal world, and great en- 
livener of the vegetable, so beautiful in thy 
self â€” so bounteous in thy effects !" But 
great excitement invariably leads to lan- 
guor ; the spirits, in proportion as they are 
elevated, become depressed. There was a 
murmur in the wood, that awakened recol- 
lections, which again caused tears, a proof 
that the resolves of an unregulated mind 
are little better than the mere flights of 
imagination. 

Mountflorence was unhappy and rest- 
less ; there was more than was known to 
render him so â€” a thousand considerations 
inducing him to guard the secret carefully

from others. He had left Woodston the 
preceding night, with an intention of ab- 
senting himself for some days ; yet he was 
again there the following evening, just in 
time to be one of the party that had been 
made to drink tea on a romantic spot, on 
one of the headlands that formed the bay 
of Woodston, where a cave was pointed 
out as the lonely retreat of one of the early 
disciples of Saint Patrick, now also him- 
self denominated a saint, and in honour of 
whom, an annual fair, or pattern, was held 
at the place by the country people. The 
party proceeded there in the fine pleasure- 
boat belonging to Woodston, preceded by 
a smaller one, with attendants, to have 
every thing prepared for their reception. 
Projections in the rock formed a rude as- 
cent to the summit of the cliff, where, on 
a level spot of some extent, the cave was 
situated. From its immense height, and 
the world of whelming waters it com- 
manded, the imagination would have be- 
come aghast, and the brain probably reeled 
with terror, but that the rocks that breast- 
ed the mountain, formed, by the irregula- 
rity of their summits, a kind of rampart to

the spot, that permitted an approach to 
the very edge of the cliff without danger. 
The sedge, or coarse grass, that covered 
the lower parts, here gave place to a coat- 
ing of a finer kind, thickly sprinkled with 
wild berries and aromatic plants. The cave 
was overgrown with moss and ivy, and 
still retained some traces of having been 
once inhabited : on one side stood a rude 
cross of stone, and on the other, was a na- 
tural reservoir for water, into which a lim- 
pid rill, that burst spontaneously from the 
ground, fell with a pleasing murmur. 

The party soon became scattered. While 
the servants were busied in preparing tea, 
Helena, after a survey of the place, seated 
herself on the grass ; and Mountflorence 
threw himself beside her; but from the 
moment of his joining her at the water's 
edge, he had appeared to devote himself 
exclusively to her. But for the acknow- 
ledgment of yesterday, what a flattering 
construction might she have put upon the 
circumstance! but now, what conclusion 
could be drawn from it, but that he had 
previously feared to pay her any mark-

ed attention, lest of leading her into an 
error, with regard to his real sentiments. 
The idea pained â€” it did more, it piqued 
her; and suddenly rising, she abruptly left 
him. Hardly had she done so, ere she 
became angry with herself. Was this 
captiousness in unison with the plans â€” 
the generous resolves, of the preceding 
night ? â€” Was this the way to secure the 
esteem â€” the friendship, which, she said 
to herself, would be an equivalent for his 
love? and she threw herself in his way, 
and by various artifices drew him again to 
her side. The conversation turned on the 
scene. Mountflorence, who, notwithstand- 
ing the profession he had so early entered, 
had found opportunities for indulging his 
taste for travel, mentioned some he had 
seen abroad that it recalled to recollection. 
His descriptions were so accurate, and his 
manner in giving them so animated, that 
Helena felt an increasing pleasure in lis- 
tening to him. â€” " I have often wished," 
she said, after a slight pause in their dis- 
course, with a kind of half-suppressed sigh, 
" that present times allowed of the romantic 
retirements of former ones ; for what, for 



CONTRAST. 27 

instance, could be better adapted than this 
wild spot, surrounded as it is by all that 
is calculated to awe and to elevate, for 
calming a disquieted spirit, and bringing 
it back to reflection ?" 

" That might admit of a little argu- 
ment perhaps," replied Mountflorence, 
smiling, " for there is a solitude that 
sooths, and a solitude that chills. Be 
that as it may, however, it is impossible 
to convey any adequate idea of the pecu- 
liar interest which is imparted by such 
retreats to the places where they still exist. 
There is so much of romance connected 
with them, in the imagination, that we 
delight in lingering amidst the solitudes 
they occupy. Whatever is out of the 
common Hne, gives that excitement to the 
feelings that is so agreeable ; and we na- 
turally conceive it can be no common 
sorrows that have driven a man from the 
cheerful haunts of his fellow-mortals. 
With what sensations have I not, from 
this reflection, loitered amidst the romantic 
hermitages of Montserrat, picturing to 
myself, as I escaladed the tremendous

rock, what those afflictions must have 
been, that led to its occupation !" 

" Amongst the many pilgrimages I 
wish to make, that is one," said Helena. 

" Should you ever make it, I shall envy 
your companion," observed Mountflorence ; 
" for half the pleasure of visiting such places 
is lost, if we have not some one with us, 
who can enter into the feelings they excite." 

Helena sighed. Her thoughts rambled. 
â€” " Adelaide is fond of travelling," she 
said, without well knowing she was speak- 
ing. There was no reply. She turned 
her eyes upon Mountflorence, and found 
him regarding her with a strange kind of 
scrutinizing look. 

" It may be so," he said, coldly, on her 
looking at him. 

Helena felt her cheek suffused. Ade- 
laide was then the object of his secret at- 
tachment ; his evident displeasure at this 
allusion to her, allowed her to be no longer 
dubious on the subject â€” a displeasure, no 
doubt, proceeding from construing what 
had just been said, into a kind of indirect 
attempt to learn more concerning her than 
he chose to disclose. Yet, how inconsis- 



CONTRAST. 29 

tent this conclusion with the confidence 
he appeared on the point of reposing yes- 
terday ! But she might have been mis- 
taken in supposing any thing of that kind 
his intention. 

Again she sustained a shock â€” something 
similar to that of the preceding day, as if 
a doubt had lingered on her mind of his 
being really devoted to another, whilst 
that other remained unknown; but now 
it was completely removed, and she invo- 
luntarily drew back from his further at- 
tentions, through the persuasion of these 
being only paid owing to the absence of 
another. 



CHAP. II. 

" All nature fades extinct ; and she alone. 
Heard, felt, and seen, possesses every thoaght, 
Fills every sense, and pants in every vein." 

All anxious impatience for the required 
explanation with Adelaide, De Montville 
was hastening to her, after breakfast, when 
lord Le Poer, reminding him they were 



30 CONTRAST. 

to dine at lady Dorothy's that day, said 
he might as well wait to accompany him. 

They arrived but a few minutes before 
dinner; shortly after Adelaide withdrew; 
De Montville, intent on the purpose for 
which he wished to have sought her in the 
morning, did not remain long behind. 
Not finding her in the drawing-room, he 
inquired where she was, and was instruct- 
ed to seek her in the library. The door 
of this apartment was partly open, suffi- 
ciently so to allow of his seeing her, seated 
at a table writing. 

The moment he entered, she started up 
as if involuntarily, and with an evident 
look of confusion ; and, at the same instant, 
the paper on which she was writing was 
wafted away to another part of the room, 
by a sudden gust of air. 

De Montville flew to recover it ; as he 
was bringing it back, involuntarily glan- 
cing at it, a word, or, rather, name, caught 
his eye, that made him pause. 

Adelaide no sooner observed this, than 
darting to him, she snatched the paper 
from his hand, and, ere he could make an 
effort to prevent her, tearing and crumÂ« 



CONTRAST. 31 

pling it in hers, threw it amidst the flow- 
ers, with which the grate was filled. 

" Very extraordinary this !" thought De 
Mont ville, moving in silence to a distant seat. 

Adelaide resumed hers. Neither spoke 
for some time. 

At length â€” *' Very extraordinary !" re- 
peated De Montville, giving utterance to 
his thought. 

" What?" demanded Adelaide, laying 
down a book she had taken up. 

" Your conduct in destroying what you 
were writing. What," rising as he spoke, 
and approaching her, " could occasion you 
to act in such a manner ?" 

" Oh, perhaps because I did not mean 
to finish it; but it can be of no conse- 
quence, I am sure, to you to ascertain." 

" I beg your pardon â€” it is, attributing 
it to the cause I do. In short, Adelaide, 
I came here this day, determined that there 
should be an end of the mystery in which 
you have hitherto thought proper to in- 
volve every thing in which you are any 
way concerned ; for your conduct with re- 
gard to your letter is not the only extra- 
ordinary thing I have to complain of â€” 



32 CONTRAST. 

blind obedience is what no one has a right 
to expect from another. I blame myself 
for folly in having already given you any 
proof of this ; but you must not expect 
any further concession from me, without 
first explaining your reason for requiring it." 

" I thought all this was already settled," 
said Adelaide ; " that you had consented 
to oblige me, without importuning to 
know my motive for asking you â€” until I 
chose to avow it myself" 

" Then permit me now to undeceive 
you " 

" No, not now," abruptly rising ; " lady 
Dorothy will be offended if I longer delay 
joining her," and, ere he had power to pre- 
vent her, leaving the room. 

De Montville was on the point of rush- 
ing out after her, when he suddenly recol- 
lected the letter. It was evident to him, 
that her destroying it was owing to a fear 
of its being kept back by him, and what 
should now prevent his satisfying the more 
than curiosity it had excited ? in short, all 
just reflection was banished at the moment, 
by the feelings to which he had given way. 
Nice in his notions of honour, even to fas- 



CONTRAST. 33 

tidiousness, he had now no scruple in pos- 
sessing himself of the letter of another : he 
had no difficulty in finding it where it was 
thrown, and smoothing it, as well as a hand 
already nervous by agitation would per- 
mit, read as follows : â€” 



" Indeed, my dear Sigismund, 
you need not fear my violating the pro- 
mise that has placed me under your con- 
trol ; what can I do more than I have done, 
to evade the engagement formed for me, 
except I at once protest against it?â€” which, 
from the serious injury such a measure 
would probably be attended with, to all 
my hopes and expectations, you know 
you have yourself objected to. 

" I am not without hopes that De 
Montville may be induced to make an- 
other effort for the postponement of our in- 
tended marriage ; should he succeed, there 
will then be time to consider, without my 
running any risk what " 

No more was intelligible, from the way

in which it had been torn and crushed ; nor 
was it requisite that more should be deci* 
phered, to make De Montville understand, 
that both the woman he loved, and the 
friend in whose honour and rec^ard he 
placed the highest confidence, had been act- 
ing with the cruellest treachery towards 
him ; it now appeared evident to him, that 
they were attached, and that to their attach- 
ment they had no hesitation in attempting 
to sacrifice his interests. As his conver- 
sation of the preceding evening with 
Mountflorence was recalled, how mature- 
ly did it seem that the consequences of 
every thing had been weighed I Yet who 
could suppose, who imagine, from the fair 
seeming of both, that either could be ca- 
pable of the perfidy of which they now 
appeared convicted ! Why not place con- 
fidence in him â€” soliciting it too as he had 
done? Mountflorence at least knew he 
was not of an ungenerous temper ; but no, 
that would not have answered their pur- 
pose, which was clearly, by making him 
propose the delay of the intended mar- 
riage, to create a suspicion in the mind of 
lord Le Poer, of his being the person that 



CONTRAST. 35 

was averse to it, and thus draw upon him 
the displeasure of his lordship â€” not to be 
incurred, as previous circumstances proved, 
by any one with impunity. 

All rage against ^lountflorence, he 
would instantly have proceeded to St. Fi- 
nians, but that he knew of his having gone 
in the morning to Woodston ; but Ade- 
laide, the fair deceiverâ€”she was still within 
his reach; and ringing furiously, he de- 
sired her to be informed he wished most 
particularly to speak to her for a few mi- 
nutes. 

" She is gone â€” gone out, sir," replied 
the servant who answered him, stammer- 
ing through surprise, perhaps alarm, at the 
wildness of his looks. 

" Gone out !â€” -which way Pâ€”in what di- 
rection ?" hastily demanded the agitated 
De Montville. 

" I am not sure, sir, but I 1 rather 

think in the direction of the glen." 

This was enough for De Montville 
Mountflorence might be returned by this 
time, or she might be gone to deposit a 
letter for him in the grotto ; and snatching 



S6 CONTRAST. 

up his hat, he flew off in the direction 
mentioned. 

Plunging at once amidst the gloom of 
the place, he was advancing with the same 
headlong impetMOsity, till the necessity of 
caution, to prevent his approach being 
heard, occurring, he checked himself a 
little. With something like a sensation 
of exulting joy, he found both Adelaide 
and Mountflorence in the hermitage. 

The surprise, or rather alarm, of the 
former, at seeing him, for she turned of a 
deadly paleness at his sight, was evinced by 
a faint exclamation. â€” " Ah, you may well 
change colour at beholding me here,** cried 
De Montville, *' conscience-stricken as you 
must be ! But it is not with you, madam, 
my business is," scornfully passing her as 
he spoke, to where Mountflorence stood 
leaning against the wall ; " it is with you, 
sir," sternly confronting him, " I wish to 
speak." 

" I am ready to hear whatever you have 
to say.' 

" But are you equally ready to answer? 
are you equally ready to acknowledge that 



CONTRAST. 37 

you have acted with the basest perfidy to- 
wards me ?" 

" No," said Mountflorence, calmly : 
" unconscious of meriting such a charge, 
I am not, of course, prepared to answer it." 

" What !" exclaimed De Montville, 
wrought to still greater frenzy by this 
coolness, " to the blackness of perfidy, do 
you add the meanness of falsehood ?" 

" Oh, De Montville, refrain !" cried 
Adelaide, in an agony of terror ; " you 
know not what you say." 

" Do not be alarmed !" said Mountflo- 
rence ; " he evidently does not : we should 
be mad indeed ourselves, if we attended to 
the ravings of a madman." 

" This will not do, Mountflorence," said 
De Montville, " this subterfuge, this 
attempted evasion of the explanation I 
demand. Here, here," and he produced 
the letter of Adelaide, " is proof â€” proof 
incontrovertible, of what I have asserted, 
and satisfaction, of some kind or other, I 
will have for what I complain of." 

Adelaide again attempted to interfere, 
but was again repulsed. She wrung her 
hands, and seemed for a minute in utter. 



S8 CONTRAST. 

despair ; then, as if through some sud- 
den thought, she darted from the grotto, 
and was hurrying down the glen, when 
she espied lord Le Poer sauntering along 
the edge. She instantly called to hira to 
follow to the grotto, and fled back to it 
herself. 

Lord Le Poer, both surprised and a- 
larmed by this entreaty, was not slow in 
complying with it ; but he was not by 
any means prepared for the scene that 
awaited him in the place. After remain- 
ing a few minutes in silent expectation of 
some one addressing him â€” " Pray, what 
am I to understand from this ?" he said. 

" Inquire of this lady here â€” of that 
gentleman there," replied De JVIontville, 
all recollection but of his supposed wrongs 
lost at the moment; " yet no, let me ex- 
plain, as an act of justice to myself, to pre- 
vent that perversion of facts that would 
otherwise ensue." 

" No," cried Adelaide, " the fact â€” the 
truth is, my lord, I wished my intended 
marriage delayed, and by some chance 
Mr. De Montville discovered that major 
Mountflorence had some influence with 



CONTRAST. 39 

me, in desiring this, and, in consequence, 
has been displeased, from conceiving the 
circumstance ascribable to a very different 
motive than the real one." 

" Major Mountflorence influencing you 
to have your marriage delayed ! and pray to 
what but an interested motive could such 
conduct be owing ?" 

" It is not for his having such a motive, 
because our attachments are often invo- 
luntary, that I complain," said De Mont- 
ville ; " it is for the artifice he has had re- 
course to to conceal it." 

" You wrong him," said Adelaide : " on 
his own account he had nothing to con- 
ceal ; from the most honourable feelinor â€” 
the most disinterested motive, he wished 
our marriage either delayed or prevented. 
How shall I proceed? â€” how, without in- 
jury to myself, attempt the exculpation of 
another? Do not spurn â€” do not re- 
nounce me," she cried, sinking in a sup- 
pliant posture before her father ; " but there 
was an unhappy error, an unfortunate in- 
discretion, into which I was betrayed, that 
acquainted with, major Mountflorence 
deemed it but an act of justice to himself

and others, to insist on having explained, 
ere I entered into any serious engagement. 
In the propriety â€” the expediency of such 
a measure, I could not but acquiesce ; but 
circumstances, over which I had no con- 
trol, have hitherto impeded this explana- 
tion, and the result has been the unhappy 
one it now is." 

" And have you the effrontery to ac- 
knowledge all this to me ?" demanded his 
lordship, recoiling from her as from a ser- 
pent, and turning pale with livid rage; 
" the effrontery to own that, at the very 
moment of my acknowledging you, you 
were unworthy of the title to which you 
laid claim ?" 

" No, my lord," said Mountflorence, 
now stepping forward, and raising as he 
spoke the weeping and dismayed Ade- 
laide ; " from her confusion, she certainly 
has expressed herself in a manner calcu- 
lated to excite injurious surmises ; but in- 
discretion, for which youth and inexpe- 
rience must plead in extenuation, is all, I 
am positive, she merits reproach for. Still, 
so sensitive is honour, that, from being, 
as a connexion, interested in her conduct. 



CONTRAST. 41 

I expressly stipulated her being candid, 
with respect to this, ere she allowed herself 
to enter into the engagement you had 
formed for her." 

" You did right, sir, in insisting on this 
â€” you acted as a man of honour ; but no 
wonder she tried evading her promise to 
you â€” for no wonder she should doubt be- 
ing able to impose upon others, that belief 
of her innocence which it appears she has 
imposed upon you. But what are the 
particulars of this unhappy affair? the 
name of the miscreant ?" 

" Excuse me, my lord ; but I am not 
at liberty to reveal more than I have al- 
ready disclosed." 

" Oh ! very well, sir ; of course you 
must act as you think proper. Besides, 
why should I inquire ? for what purpose ? 

Yet, where I can insist " and turning 

to Adelaide, he commanded her to acquaint 
him what Mountflorence had refused. 

Adelaide only replied to this imperious 
command, by burying her face in her 
handkerchief 

" So you hesitate ! you refuse too ! 
Very well â€” you shall not be urged on the 



42 CONTRAST. 

subject â€” what more indeed, as I have just 
said, can I want to hear? But prepare to 
quit the honourable protection under 
which I placed you, to live henceforth an 
alien to me and mine ! Begone ! your 
sight is hateful to me !" 

De Montville, whose feelings all this 
time may be conceived, on seeing her as- 
cending to the door, sprang forward to 
assist her. They proceeded some way 
down the glen in silence, when suddenly 
pausing â€” " Oh, Adelaide !" he said, " why 
refuse me the confidence so earnestly soli- 
cited? had you been candid â€” had you 
been ingenuous with me, as I implored, 
much of what has been so distressing to 
yourself might have been prevented, and 
I should have been spared the eternal 
shame and regret of thinking I had in- 
sulted the friend I most regard." 

" I am the victim of appearances," said 
Adelaide, again weeping â€” *' circumstances 
I could not command have led me to act 
diametrically opposite to my real feelings. 
I am not naturally insincere, or disinge- 
nuous ; but I could not act otherwise with 



CONTRAST. 43 

regard to you than I have done, without 
incurring my own reproaches." 

" I know not what to infer from your 
mode of expressing yourself," said De 
Montville; *' if it be on account of others 
you are suffering your present distress, let 
me implore you not to make any longer 
sacrifice of your own peace, and that of 
others, to mistaken and romantic notions 
of honour and generosity. Be explicit ; I 
again ask your confidence, from no idle 
motive of curiosity, but solely to learn 
-^vhether I can, by my counsel, in any way 
serve you, or avert what is threatened." 

" I am convinced of that," said Ade- 
laide ; *â€¢' but obligations I cannot break 
through forbid what you solicit." 

" And is not one question to be an- 
swered ? But I see how it is â€” to what 
this obstinate, this determined silence, is 
owing â€” a fear of involving the safety of 
the miscreant â€” the villain whom you love." 

" I love no villain !" replied Adelaide ; 
" he whom I love is not more undeserving 
of that appellation than yourself" 

" He whom you love !" repeated De 
Montville, falteringly, and involuntarily 



44 CONTRAST. 

withdrawing the arm under which he had 
drawn her trembling hand ; " then you do 
love? you are candid in acknowledging that. 
But I might have surmised this â€” I might 
have inferred its being the case, else you 
never would have trifled with my feelings 
as you did. But forgive me," he added, 
in a softened tone, perceiving her greatly 
affected ; " this is no hour for reproach â€” 
forgive me, my dear Adelaide !" he cried, 
involuntarily pressing her to his agitated 
bosom, and perhaps as unconsciously kiss- 
ing her tear-bedewed cheek ; " I know I 
have expressed myself in a way I ought 
not ; but my disappointment has been se- 
vere, and the heart, in its soreness, will 
sometimes give utterance to what a mo- 
ment's reflection must make it condemn." 

" I have nothing to thank you for but 
kindness," said Adelaide. " But let us 
now part, lest lord Le Poer should sur- 
prise us, and be still more offended at my 
delaying to return to the house." 

" Before you leave me," said De Mont- 
ville, unwilling to let her withdraw her 
hand, " promise, that if, in any way, I 



CONTRAST. 45 

Can serve you, you will not hesitate to let 
me know." 

" I promise," cried Adelaide ; " and that 
because I am aware, that in affording you 
an opportunity of serving or obliging me, 
I should confer a pleasure on you." 

" How much does that speech atone 
for !" said De Montville, with emotion. 
" But, ah, Adelaide, this is not the first 
time you flattered me." 

Adelaide pressed his hand in silence, 
and hastened away. He remained Jin- 
gering on the spot where she lefl him, un- 
til she was out of sight. There was a de- 
solate feeling in his heart at the moment, 
that rendered him unwilling to quit it â€” a 
kind of widowed sensation, excited by the 
sudden derangement of the plan respect- 
ing him and Adelaide. He was aware, 
however, that he should be accused of 
folly and romance, were the feelings he 
experienced on account of this known, so 
short had been their intimacy; but it 
seemed to himself as if he had loved her 
ere his introduction to her. Besides, there 
was a sweetness in her manner, a seem- 
ingly-playful innocence in the little tricks 



46 CONTRAST. 

she had contrived to teaze him, that had 
resistlessly captivated his imagination* 
But she was lost to him for ever; for, 
notwithstanding her assertions, to induce 
a contrary belief, he could not possibly 
imagine, that if possessed of the power of 
vindicating herself, she would not at once 
have availed herself of it. 

As soon as he had ascertained lord Le 
Poer having left Mountflorence, he hast- 
ened back to the hermitage, to apologize 
to the latter for his recent conduct. The 
apology was readily admitted; in the 
course of the conversation that ensued, he 
made an indirect attempt to try and ob- 
tain from Mountflorence those particulars 
which he had refused to lord Le Poer; 
but he failed in the effort ; and, left to his 
own wild conjectures respecting Adelaide, 
felt wretched indeed. 

In the mean time, lord Le Poer lost not 
a minute in informing lady Dorothy of 
what had occurred, and consulting with 
her how to dispose of the *' wretched girl," 
as he styled Adelaide. 

Her ladyship was quite horrified at what 
she considered this second blot in their 



CONTRAST. 47 

family escutcheon. She advised, by all 
means, that some distant retreat should 
immediately be sought out for her; and 
that if any man of decent birth could be 
found inclined to unite his fate with hers, a 
portion should be given, in order that 
there might be an end of all furtiier trou- 
ble concerning her. 

Lord Le Poer could think of nothing 
better than what she suggested ; and ac- 
cordingly wrote to Mr. Courtney, signify- 
ing his wish that he would receive her 
again under his protection. To this ap- 
plication Mr. Courtney replied, by stating 
that there were certain circumstances that 
rendered it utterly impossible for him to 
comply with it ; but that if his lordship was 
decidedly determined against allowing her 
to continue under the paternal roof, he knew 
a very amiable lady, then about retiring 
into Wales, who would gladly take charge 
of her. With this proposal his lordship 
directly closed ; and a letter or two more 
settled all matters. He might have been 
ofifended with Mr. Courtney, for refusing 
to receive her again, but for the cause to 
which he imputed this refusal, namely, a 



48 CONTRAST. 

knowledge of the imprudence of which she 
had been guilty ; at least, so he was now 
positively convinced, from the interpreta- 
tion he put upon Mr. Courtney's letter. 

Adelaide, apprized of the application 
made to Mr. Courtney, was inexpressibly 
hurt by learning the result of it â€” almost 
with the pang it inflicted, was mingled 
a sensation of resentment; but this was 
quickly suppressed, in consideration of Mr. 
Courtney not knowing the greater claim 
than ever that she had now to his kindness ; 
that from him, now, more than from any 
other person, she had a right to look for 
advice and consolation in the present di- 
lemma ; but he was ignorant of this, and 
that he might ever remain so, was her ear- 
nest wish. 

Although there were feelings that at- 
tached her to her present residence, still, 
circumstanced as she now was, she could not 
but rejoice at the idea of quitting it â€” little 
better than a prisoner at large, as she now 
was â€” shunned and avoided as a disgrace â€” 
or, if noticed, only to be tortured into the 
confession of what she had the most pow- 
erful considerations for concealing. But 



CONTRAST. 49 

-while she keenly felt the unkindness to 
which she was now subjected, no resent- 
ment mingled with the feelings it excited, 
so aware was she of appearances being 
against her, and of the aggravated light in 
which her apparent obstinacy must occa- 
sion her to be viewed. She greatly wish- 
ed to have a letter forwarded to England, 
for the purpose of making inquiries essen- 
tial to her tranquillity, but knew not how 
to make the attempt, lest of the letter fall- 
ing into the hands of lord Le Poer ; Miss 
Ferns being purposely sent out of the 
way, and De Montville no more seen. 

In considering her unworthy of remain- 
ing longer under his immediate protection, 
lord Le Poer, of course, considered her 
unworthy of any further association with 
those to whom he had introduced her ; 
anxious, however, if possible, to avoid 
being the theme again of public conversa- 
tion, indisposition was made the pretext 
for her sudden seclusion, and being no 
more seen by visitors. 

At length, she received notice to prepare 
for her departure, but without being in- 

VOL. II. D 



50 CONTRAST. 

formed of her destination. In the dusk of the 
evening, the carriage that was to take her 
away drew up to a private door : as she was 
stepping into it, she looked about for De 
Montville, in the hope of seeing him again 
â€” anxious to ascertain whether, the first 
fervour of perhaps romantic feehng sub- 
sided, any after reflection had occurred to 
lessen the kind regard and tender interest 
he had in the first instance avowed for 
her. But a feeling of pride precluded the 
gratification she sought ; in the moment 
of seeing her depart, De Montville feared 
he should not be able to maintain a com- 
mand over himself, and from what had oc- 
curred, he no longer wished his real senti- 
ments for her to be known. 

With a heart heavy with regrets, she 
entered the carriage ; but after the hopes 
she had been allowed to indulge, the cruel 
circumstances under which she was depart- 
ing nearly overpowered her fortitude ; to 
be acknowledged, received into the bosom 
of her family, but to be expelled from it 
in disgrace, was a reflection that required 
indeed all her strength of mind to enable 
her to support with any degree of calm- 



CONTRAST. 5l 

ness ; still she derived some little consola- 
tion, from the consideration of the motive 
that had led to this unhappiness. 

The packet that was to take her to Eng- 
land was lying at Sandville; lady Doro- 
thy's woman was to accompany her to the 
opposite side, and there give her up to a 
person who was to be in readiness to re- 
ceive her. The carriage drove down at 
once to the beach, where a boat was wait- 
ing for them. 

While her companion was looking after 
their accommodation, Adelaide seated her- 
self upon the deck, still hoping she might 
see De Montville, and perhaps IMountflo- 
rence, who, in consequence of what had 
occurred at the grotto, had not since 
called at lady Dorothy's, and who, on 
many accounts, she was anxious to have a 
little conversation with ere her departure. 

The scene beheld was wild and melan- 
choly, and from this circumstance, not cal- 
culated, in any degree, to relieve the de- 
jection under which she laboured. The 
romantic cliffs were, by this time, darken- 
ed into still greater awfulness, by the ob- 
scuring gloom of the hour; while, in the

monotonous breaking of the waves against 
them, now and then disturbing a nestled 
seagull, or cormorant, and the rippling of 
the water about the vessel, there was some- 
thing inexpressibly mournful: the sound 
of music and of laughter now .and then 
reached her from the village, but only to 
deepen her melancholy, by recalling ima- 
ges, by reviving ideas of domestic hap- 
piness, she might never be permitted to 
participate in again : the amiable family 
of Woodston recurred to her thoughts, 
and it was not amongst her least regrets, the 
light in which she might now be consi- 
dered by them. Her eyes wandered ; the 
light-house on the opposite coast was lit 
up, and as its broad glare spread over the 
dark expanse before it, the waves, tinged 
with the fiery glow, seemed rolling on- 
ward in liquid gold, to pour themselves 
upon the shore; but soon their undulating 
radiance began to fade and die away, till 
all was again cold and dismal. And thus, 
thought Adelaide, as she viewed the evanes- 
cent splendour, fade away the bloom, the al- 
lurements of early life ; with what charms is 
its opening period adorned â€” but while yet 



CONTRAST. 53 

the eye of raptured admiration is fixed upon 
them, they die and vanish from thegaze ! 

At length the signal was given for get- 
ting under weigh, and all expectation 
of the farewell she hoped to have received 
relinquished. 

At the hotel to which she was conduct- 
ed on landing, she found an elderly woman 
waiting to receive her; and with her; as 
soon as she had a little refreshed herself, 
set out in a chaise for her destination, but 
without yet knowing where this was. 
Her companion was extremely taciturn; 
but to this Adelaide would have made no 
objection, occupied as she was with her 
own reflections, had she but obtained from 
her the gratification of her curiosity; but 
in vain she strove to learn from her whi- 
ther she was going. Still intent upon 
writing the letter already alluded to, Ade- 
laide could not help wishing, more than 
once, that she made as little use of her 
eyes as of her tongue; but this was by no 
means the case, for not even for a moment 
did she suffer her to elude her vigilance. 

They commenced their journey at an 
early hour in the morning ; towards even- 



54 CONTRAST. 

ing it drew near a close, not without 
Adelaide having by this time ascertained 
that her destination was Wales ; but what 
part she could not discover. At length 
the carriage entered the grass-grown court 
of an old dismal-looking castle, at the 
foot of an immense ridge of mountains. 
As Adelaide alighted, she could not help 
stopping for a minute, to admire the crim- 
son glow of the setting sun upon the cold 
grey walls, here and there slightly tinted 
with moss and ivy. 

The pure mountain air, the turn given 
to her thoughts by the romantic scenery 
she had been travelling through, the hope 
that springs eternal in the human mind, 
had all been gradually contributing, within 
the few last hours, to renovate her spirits ; 
and with a mind restored to something 
of its natural elasticity, she followed her 
companion down a long passage to a par- 
lour at its extremity ; but hardly had she 
set her foot within this, when the plea- 
surable sensations she had been yielding 
to vanished at the sight of the person 
waiting there to receive her, and, start- 
ing back, in a voice of dismay she ex- 



CONTRAST. 55 

claimed, " Mrs. Westford, is it possible !" 

" Yes, really," was the reply of the per- 
son thus accosted â€” a lady somewhat ad- 
vanced in life, but of which circumstance, 
to judge from her style of dress, she ap- 
peared forgetful. 

" Good Heavens!" cried the agitated Ade- 
laide, " this is indeed being ensnared :" yet 
it might not exactly be as she apprehend- 
ed; Mrs. Westford might, after all, be there 
only by chance, not as the actual mistress 
of the place ; and she proceeded to make 
the inquiry so essential to her tranquillity. 

" At present, this place owns no other 
mistress," answered Mrs. Westford, coldly. 

" Then you actually are the person to 
whose care I am resigned ?" said Adelaide, 
in a tone indicative of renewed dismay. 

A slight inclination of the head was the 
reply. 

" Good Heavens !" again exclaimed the 
agitated girl, as unconsciously she kept 
traversing the room â€” then suddenly paus- 
ing, " and is it to Mr. Courtney," she de- 
manded, " I am indebted for this misery ? 
But let me not reproach him â€” he knew 
not whom he was recommending to my 



56 CONTRAST. 

friends â€” he knows not yet how little the 
confidence he reposed was merited â€” the 
cruel advantage taken of his easy faith, his 
unsuspecting credulity; but Sophia! yet 
doubtless she has been kept ignorant of all 
that has lately occurred." 

" No matter," cried Mrs. Westford, " of 
what either is ignorant, or what either 
knows, or does not know ; here you are, 
through the representations made, and 
here you must remain, while your friends 
choose; for," with glistening eyes, and a 
flushing cheek, " accuse me of wliat you 
may, you shall find, that at least to the 
trust they have reposed in me, I do not 
prove unfaithful." 

" Ah ! no doubt," sighed Adelaide to 
herself, " there is no danger of your prov- 
ing unfaithful to any trust that gives you 
an opportunity of exercising your malig- 
nity ;" and she again sighed at the thought 
of being in the power of a woman, whose 
resentment she had so incurred by her 
just but stinging reproaches. 

" This is not the first time I have had 
to thank you, Miss Mountflorence, for the 
disclosure of your favourable opinion of 
me," said Mrs. Westford ; *â€¢ but times are 



CONTRAST. 57 

changed, and perhaps a little less candour 
at your side naight be as well for the pre- 
sent: with the knowledge I have of your 
sentiments, you could not possibly deceive 
me by any appearance of regard ; but the 
assumption of a little complaisance might 
not be amiss, as a circumstance likely to 
prevent unpleasant irritation ; for I do not 
pretend to more patience than other folks. 
There is what the politicians call * an arm- 
ed neutrality,' and this I recommend to 
your adoption on the present occasion." 

Adelaide could not but acknowledge 
the policy of the advice; but it was diiB^ 
cult to follow ; not that she did not know 
how to command her feelings, that being 
one of the earliest lessons taught her by 
her suffering mother, as a means of better 
enabling her to bear what it might be her 
destined lot to endure ; but that here there 
was so much just cause for complaint and 
indignation : but then, it was not dissem- 
bling, but suppressing, that was required 
from her ; and of what use, involved in the 
toils, struggling in them, without a friendly 
hand to aid her in her extrication from

58 CONTRAST. 

them, was reproach or complaint? yet how 
could she appear calm â€” how conceal the 
workings of her mind, w^hen she thought of 
being in the power of a woman, that, from 
previous circumstances, she knew capable 
of lending herself to any atrocity ? But to 
counterbalance this reflection, to sooth, to 
sustain her under it, was she not, she asked 
herself, as much here as elsewhere, under 
the superintending care of a watchful Pro- 
vidence â€” an eye that never slumbereth or 
sleepeth â€” a divine being, whom she had 
early been taught to believe never aban- 
dons those who firmly rely on him for 
kindness and protection ? What then had 
she to fear? not the shallow devices of 
the wicked, that in a moment he laugheth 
to scorn ; and as she raised her eyes to the 
sky, still gorgeous with the splendours of 
the setting sun â€” the heaven, that he has 
declared to be his throne, she could have 
persuaded herself, like the Lady in Comus, 
in the enthusiasm of rapturous devotion, 
that had she asked some certain indication 
of what she required, it would have been 
granted in some " cloud, turning out its 
silver lining to the night"

His devious course uncertain, seeking home," 



" Well, now that you appear inclined to 
be a little rational, I presume you'll have 
no objection to taking a seat at the tea- 
table ?" said Mrs. Westford, placing her- 
self at it as she spoke. 

Adelaide drew a chair to it. A long 
pause ensued â€” neither knew how to start 
any topic of conversation to the other ; yet 
there was an unpleasant awkwardness in 
thus continuing silent. Mrs. Westford 
feai-ed speaking of those about whom Ade- 
laide was interested, lest of occasioning a 
recurrence of that indignation she was un- 
willing to provoke ; and Adelaide was her- 
self equally disinclined to mention them, 
through the conviction that the terms in 
which she could not but speak of them, 
must be construed into indirect reproaches 



60 CONTRAST. 

by her companion ; and as to indifferent 
subjects, these could not be entered upon, 
without greater complacency of feeling than 
was just then experienced by either: but 
Adelaide was curious to know how Mrs. 
Westford had got into her present resi- 
dence; and accordingly, suddenly laying 
down her cup â€” " I didn't know," she said, 
" that you had a castle in Wales." 

" Didn't you?" said Mrs. Westford, 
drily : " you thought perhaps I had only 
castles in the air; you perceive now, how- 
ever, that I have one of a little more solid 
materials; but I don't know that I ever 
talked of my affairs to you." 

Adelaide involuntarily looked round 
her ; and as she did, felt herself utterly un- 
able to give credit to Mrs. Westford's as- 
sertion ; given, as she knew her to be, to 
boasting and vain glory, she deemed it 
next to impossible that she should have 
had such a residence, as the one she now 
occupied, without mentioning the circum- 
stance; and a shuddering sensation again 
came over her, at the idea of what the 
falsehood respecting it might have been 
invented for. But she speedily exerted 



CONTRAST. 61 

herself to overcome what could not but be 
considered indicative of a distrust unwor- 
thy of a confiding being; and anxious, on 
many accounts, to exactly ascertain where 
she was, threw out many lures for the pur- 
pose ; but all in vain. 

At length the wild music of a harp at- 
tracted her to a window; she threw up 
the sash, in order to hear it more distinctly, 
and w^as enchanted with it, so much was 
it in unison with the hour and scenery. 
As she gazed on this, the natural fastnesses 
and strongholds of the ancient Britons, a 
thousand romantic and interesting associa- 
tions were revived ; and she stood literally 
tranced in thought, till called to partake 
of a shght repast by Mrs. VVestford, impa- 
tient to get rid of her. 

Adelaide did not require any indica- 
tions of this kind of impatience, to induce 
her to propose shortly retiring for the 
night. Through a succession of intricate 
passages, she was conducted to her cham- 
ber, by the person with whom she had tra- 
velled, and there left to herself 

Her first care, on finding herself alone, 
was to examine her apartment â€” sufficient- 



62 CONTRAST. 

ly antique and gloomy in its appearance to 
strike dismay, at least in such an hour as 
the present, into a mind at all tinctured 
with superstition. But her minute inves- 
tigation did not enable her to discover any 
thing at all calculated to create alarm ; 
still she could not immediately divest her- 
self of a feeling of uneasiness, that had 
again laid hold of her. 

In vain she argued with herself, that 
knowing who she was, that she must be 
accountable to her friends for her safety, 
Mrs. Westford would not surely attempt 
any perfidy against her. In opposition to 
this natural idea, was the knowledge of 
the circumstances under which she had 
been committed to her care, and the little 
attention that in consequence would pro- 
bably be paid to any complaint or allegation 
she might find it necessary to make : but 
had she not still a divine protector? â€” and 
she knelt down to implore protection, where 
protection can alone be depended on. 

Still, notwithstanding her reviving con- 
fidence, she could not bring herself to re- 
pair immediately to rest ; she kept linger- 
ing at a window, until she fancied she saw 



CONTRAST. 63 

the dawn beginning to break, when na- 
ture completely exhausted, she undressed, 
and sought the repose so needful for its 
renovation. 

What a glorious scene did the morning 
give to her view â€” 

" the mountain's brow 



lUura'd with fluid gold," 

and all nature rejoicing in the cheering beam ! 
and how buoyant would it have rendered 
her spirits, what delight would it have 
given to her young and ardent imagination, 
but for the reflections and regrets that 
hung upon her mind ! the irreparable in- 
jury that she might by this time have 
sustained in the good opinion of those 
whose esteem was so essential to her, and 
the lasting separation that might be effect- 
ed between them, and knowing that the 
treacherous woman to whose care she was 
given, was the cause of all this, of all she 
felt and apprehended, how could she meet 
her with complacency ? â€” but it was requi- 
site that she should not provoke her ma- 
lignity â€” and, accordingly, struggling with 
her emotions, and smoothing her brow into 
calmness, not smiles, for dissemble she 



64 CONTRAST. 

could not, she at length joined her in the 
breakfast- parlour. 

Whether owing to the restraint she thus 
imposed upon herself, or to what other 
cause, but several successive days passed 
without giving her any additional cause of 
complaint against Mrs. Westford ; and the 
circumstance had a sufficiently composing 
effect upon her mind, to allow her to enjoy 
the scenery by which she was surrounded. 

The castle in which Adelaide found her- 
self an inmate, was of very remote anti- 
quity, and what might be termed a whim- 
sical intermixture of Roman, Norman, 
Saxon, and Gothic architecture, as has been 
observed is the case with most of the castles, 
churches, and other ancient buildings of this 
part of the country ; but the Gothic is the 
most prevalent, which has given rise to 
the probabiUty, that the greater parts of 
the castles owed their origin to the Nor- 
mans, and were built or repaired after the 
introduction of Gothic architecture. 

The walls were several feet thick, and 
the windows narrow ; a winding stone 
stairs led up to the top of the building, off 
of which, at intervals, were dark recesses. 



CONTRAST. 65 

leading to the various rooms; those in the 
centre of the edifice were surrounded by- 
spaces, or cavities, formed by double walls, 
not easily discoverable, intended, it may be 
supposed, for labyrinths, or hiding-places, 
for the family of the lord of the castle, in 
moments of extremity, when the castle, 
stormed with success, and the victors 
flushed with conquest, might, in the first 
heat of savage revenge, have proved alike 
regardless of the supplications of female 
terror, and the cries of helpless innocence. 
Those necessary accommodations of 
other times rendered the interior of this 
castle sombre and gloomy in the extreme, 
and well adapted to have an unpleasant 
efifect on a mind less strong, or well regu- 
lated, than Adelaide's ; more particularly 
lonely as she felt herself, given up as she 
was, almost entirely, to her own reflec- 
tions, her delicate and just notions of fe- 
male propriety, inducing her, as much as 
possible, to avoid the society of the wretch- 
ed woman to whom she had been commit- 
ted ; for here, it could not but be reflected, 
there was ample opportunity for the 
perpetration of the foulest and the blackest 



66 CONTRAST. 

deeds â€” for the ruffian to secrete himselfj 
till the proper hour for stealing on his de- 
voted prey ; and the base and the insidious 
to bring about the accomplishment of their 
machinations. 

Devoid of all superstition, or even prone- 
ness to fear, still this building, from its 
construction and situation, was calculated 
to impress the mind with melancholy, 
and create gloomy ideas, especially on any 
variableness of weather ; for here roared 
the mountain torrent â€” here howled the 
savage blast, rushing with portentous 
moanings through the numerous long pas- 
sages, and solitary chambers of the build- 
ing, the effect heightened by the doleful 
screams of the birds of darkness, from their 
nests in the ivied towers and battlements ; 
and to add still further to which, or rather 
to that produced by the loneliness of the 
place, on the opposite side of the road, 
stood a small church, of very ancient date, 
its repository for the dead exactly front- 
ing the chamber windows of the castle. 

To Adelaide this constant prospect of 
mortality afforded a soothing consolation ; 
she never wished to forget, that to this 



CONTRAST. 67 

we must all come at last â€” the debt in- 
curred the moment of our entrance into 
existence; and in her moments of deep 
sorrow, such as would sometimes occur 
when she thought of what she might have 
yet to endure â€” of the loss she might al- 
ready have sustained, of the regard and 
esteem of those she loved and valued, it 
was calming to her agitated and afflicted 
spirit, to think that there would yet be 
peace for the perturbed heart â€” that to bear 
up but a little longer, and what her bound- 
ed view (which only saw a little part) 
deemed evil, would be no more. 

" The storms of wintry time would quickly pass, 
And one unbounded spring encircle all." 

But although the castle was gloomy 
and sombre internally, it was extremely 
picturesque externally ; in some places 
mantled with ivy, in others, its summits 
fringed with shrubs, and capped with 
trees, casting a shadow over its grey walls, 
with their pendant fohage. The scenery 
about it was a pleasing intermixture of 
wildness and cultivation; the hills, and 
receding mountains, with which it was 
skirted, were partly covered with herbage. 



68 CONTRAST. 

partly with thick woods. A mountain- 
torrent swept along the vale, until lost in 
deep, impervious shades; amidst which, 
as also scattered amongst the mountain 
rocks, the goats and kids were seen, 
springing from point to point, across terri- 
fic precipices, whilst a few white cottages 
a little softened the naturally-savage cha- 
racter of the scenery, by giving cheerful 
signs of inhabitation. 

Restricted from going out, without the 
company of Mrs. Westford, Adelaide was 
fain to rest content with exploring this 
romantic scenery with her eyes ; she de- 
lighted to watch its magical variety, under 
the varying hues of the changing hours â€” 

" From the rich sunset to the rising star, 

Till 

a paler shadow strews 



Its mantle o'er the mountains." 

When she did, however, go out, even the 
company of Mrs. Westford could not pre- 
vent her feeling a renovation of spirit, a 
sensation of luxurious enjoyment, from 
the purity of the air, and the freshness 
and delightfulness of every thing around 
her; for it may be remembered, it was 
now the time when â€” 



CONTRAST. 69 

the green hills 



Are clothed with early blojsoras, through the grass 
The quick-eyed lizard nestles, and the bills 
Of summer-birds sing welcome as ye pass ; 
Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class. 
Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes, 
Dance in the soft breeae in a fairy mass." 

But, above all things, she loved to 
watch, from her chamber w^indow, the 
village girls carefully adorning the grassy- 
graves of their departed friends with the 
sweetest flowerets of the season, and wa- 
tering them with their tears ; it was then 
she gave unrestrained way to the natural 
feelings of her soul, that she indulged in 
that pleasing pensiveness, the languor of 
the meditative mind, that broods o'er the 
ocean of the past, and gradually entrances 
the rapt spirit in a world of its own cre- 
ating. 

Judging of her by herself, Mrs. West- 
ford entirely imputed her quietness, and 
apparent contentment, to a stubborn pride, 
that would not permit it to be seen; she was 
mortified by what had happened, and the 
restrictions imposed upon her; for that 
she could take any delight in mere sce- 
nery, or feel either happy or contented in 
a place where there was nobody to admire, 



70 CONTRAST. 

and nothing to divert, she deemed next 
to impossible; and from this persuasion, 
built not a little on finding a plot she had 
laid against her easy of accomplishment. 
But little indeed could such a mind as 
hers conceive the consolations and re- 
sources with which such a one as Ade- 
laide's was furnished, from the pure spirit 
of devotion that pervaded her youthful 
breast, and the early and assiduous culture 
bestowed on every talent; how could she 
be miserable, who confided in the care of 
a superintending Providence? or want 
enjoyment, w^ho traced the hand of the 
Divinity in the humblest flower that 
blows ? 

She had been upwards of a week in her 
new abode, when she was hastily summon- 
ed from her chamber one morning. On 
repairing to the parlour, she found rather 
a young-looking female, of not altogether 
unprepossessing appearance, sitting with 
Mrs. Westford, and who was introduced 
to her by that lady as a Miss Madoc. The 
ceremony over â€” " Well, Miss Mountflo- 
rence," said Mrs. Westford, " your wish 
for exploring a little may now be gratified. 



CONTRAST. 71 

for here is a lady as fond of rambling as 
yourself, with whom I can have no possi- 
ble objection to your going out whenever 
you please, certain that she will not abuse 
the confidence," affecting to laugh as she 
spoke, â– ' that I repose in her, by letting 
you give her the slip." 

" I hope I shall not find your fair 
charge inclined to do so," replied Miss 
Madoc; " since, exclusive of any consi- 
deration about you, I should feel inclined 
to oppose such an attempt on my own ac- 
count, as we seldom like to part with those 
we think will prove agreeable." 

" Well, on the express condition of 
your keeping a watchful eye on her, I will 
let her be your companion whenever you 
please, as I have already said, for I have 
no wish whatever to keep her tied to my 
apron-string ; and as to going out with 
her exploring, as it is called â€” that is, div- 
ing into dells and clambering up moun- 
tains, she might as well expect me to fly 
over the seas with her, to examine the 
ruins of Babylon ; and indeed I cannot 
conceive any thing more ridiculous than 
this, of risking life and limb, by clambering 



72 CONTRAST. 

up amongst rocks and precipices, for no 
gratification whatever." 

" Ah, my dear ma'am, you can't say 
that, when you consider the prospects 
they give you the power of enjoying, and 
how rich they are in antiquities." 

" In old stones and ricketty old walls, 
ycleped druids' temples and altars ! well, 
whenever I voluntarily incur fatigue, it is 
to see something worth seeing â€” something 
elegantly new, and fashionable : but there, 
you perceive I was writing when you en- 
tered, so â€” for you know I use no ceremony 
with you â€” you may take your new ac- 
quaintance off with you as soon as you 
please; and should you feel inclined to 
keep her to dinner, I consent, provided 
you promise to bring her back by tea- 
time, for I shall have my letter finished 
by then, and I do not like taking my tea 
by myself, if I can help it ; and if you 
can get that bruin of a brother of yours to 
accompany you, so much the better; for 
he'll do better than dumby to make up 
the rubber I am absolutely languishing 
for, lest otherwise I should not know the 
right use of the cards, by the time I re- 



CONTRAST. 73 

turn to the land of â€” I beg pardon â€” civili- 
zation." 

" Oh, no apology," returned JMiss Ma- 
doc; " 'tis natural to speak as we think, 
and there's one comfort derived from 
knowing what is thought of us â€” that of 
being satisfied we shall not disappoint the 
expectations of any one who favours us 
with their society." 

Adelaide was much hurt by Mrs. West- 
ford's repeated allusion to the circum- 
stances under which she was then placed, 
conceiving, as she did, that it was calcu- 
lated to excite a curiosity respecting her 
she wished to avoid ; she endeavoured, 
however, to suppress any indication of re- 
sentment at it; and the pleasure she felt 
at the thought of being released from her 
company for a few hours, aided her effort 
for the purpose. 

After a pleasant ramble. Miss ?Jadoc, 
crossing the road from the rocks which 
they had descended, led her to a lonely 
farmhouse, environed in old trees, where 
ushering her into a parlour, or rather room 
fitted up as a study, Adelaide beheld a 

VOL. II. E 



74 CONTRAST. 

gentleman, with his back to the door, 
seated at a table, drawing. â€” " So," said 
his sister, slapping him on the shoulder, 
on finding he moved not at their entrance, 
" still occupied? but see whether I have 
not brought you a finer study than any 
you have been able to select for yourself." 

" Pshaw !" was the reply, without rais- 
ing his head ; " really, my dear girl, I wish 
you would cease to talk nonsense, or that 
your walk had been prolonged, for that un- 
merciful thump you gave me has been the 
means of quite destroying " 

" No matter what â€” you deserve some 
punishment for your rudeness ; so now. 
Miss Mountflorence, if you please, we'll 
leave the gentleman to his cogitations, too 
late to learn what he has lost by his want 
of politeness." 

At the sound of a stranger's name, the 
gentleman started up, and turning, pre- 
sented to the view of Adelaide the features 
of a dark-haired, military-looking man, 
not very young, but still of an animated 
expression of countenance. â€” " A study in- 
deed !" he exclaimed, with eyes evidently 



CONTRAST. 75 

beaming with admiration â€” ** pray may I 
ask " 

" Where I met this * divine mixture of 
earth's mould?' What will you say to 
yourself, for refusing to call for me this 
whole week, on Mrs. Westford, as I have 
been wanting you, when I tell you, with 
her, in her old castle â€” no wonder she calls 
you what she does â€” for you must know, 
Miss iNIountflorence," addressing herself 
to Adelaide, " this gentleman and your 
friend do not, somehow or other, agree 
well ; in short â€” but it is, or must be kept 
a secret â€” he does not like her." 

Any thing more calculated to recom- 
mend him to the good graces of Adelaide, 
or prepossess her in his favour, could not 
possibly have been had recourse to, than 
this acknowledgment, so involuntarily are 
we pleased with those who participate in 
our prejudices ; and there was reason for 
so strong a one against Mrs. Westford, 
that she could not avoid giving the person 
who entertained one against her, credit for 
discernment; yet still she certainly could 
not avoid thinking IMiss JNIadoc's confes-

sion a strange one, considering she styled 
Mrs. Westford her friend; but then there 
was an excuse for this, in the rustic man- 
ner in which she had perhaps been brought 
up, although her style of conversation did 
not exactly argue this. 

The drawings were examined â€” they were 
elegantly-executed sketches of some of the 
scenery Adelaide had been viewing that 
day, and to many were subjoined descriptive 
lines, still further illustrative of the sub- 
jects represented â€” thus uniting the kin- 
dred arts of painting and poetry in one 
person, and of course raising her new ac- 
quaintance in the estimation of Adelaide, 
who, in her mind, always connected libe- 
rality of sentiment with a taste for elegant 
pursuits. 

It may be supposed she started no ob- 
jection to remaining to dinner, as permit- 
ted by Mrs. Westford : the old harper, 
whose music had so delighted her the first 
evenino^ of her arrival, was introduced 
during the repast, and again enchanted 
her with his touching melody ; and alto- 
gether she knew not when she had passed 
a more pleasing or soothing hour. 



CONTRAST. 77 

At length the party rqge to repair to the 
castle â€” the harper ordered to follow by- 
Mr. Madoc. Mrs. Westford received 
them with great gaiety. How could she 
be gay â€” how could she laugh â€” how ap- 
pear to enjoy herself, as she did, Adelaide 
wondered, conscious as she must be of 
having empoisoned for ever the happiness 
of others â€” of having planted daggers where 
confiding trust in her friendship aggravated 
the perfidy of the act ! But conscience 
would not always remain thus torpid or 
callous; it would yet awaken to avenge, 
with scorpion stings, the wrongs of the inno- 
cent ; and Adelaide shuddered at what her 
fancy pictured to her the wretched wo- 
man must then endure. The reflections 
thus awakened, would have rendered her 
silent and melancholy for the remainder 
of the evening, but that she had Mr. Ma- 
doc to converse with, Mrs. Westford hav- 
ing rummaged out, according to her ex- 
pression, the old Welsh apothecary of the 
place and his wife, exempting him, to his 
apparently great joy, from the necessity of 
taking a place at the " board of green- 
cloth," as he styled the card-table. His 



78 CONTRAST. 

conversation confirmed Adelaide in her 
conjecture, of his being a person of infor- 
mation. He amused lier greatly, by his 
account of the local customs of the place, 
its traditions, and prevailing superstitions ; 
and she conceived she had very great cause 
of gratulation, in being introduced to him 
and his sister, connecting with them an 
idea of safety. But, of course, except she 
saw cause for actual fear, she would not 
think of applying to them for any inter- 
position for her, shrinking, as she naturally 
did, from the thought of giving publicity 
to the circumstances in which she was 
placed. But restored confidence was not 
all she hoped she should be indebted to 
them for; she flattered herself, through 
their means, she should be enabled to for- 
ward the letter to England, she was so anxi- 
ous to have conveyed there : yet how to set 
about this, puzzled her exceedingly; for 
there certainly was great awkwardness in 
acknowledging she knew not where she 
was; but perhaps she might be able to 
evade this confession ; and under the hope 
and persuasion of, at all events, succeeding 
in what she desired, she watched for op- 



CONTRAST. 79 

portunities of possessing herself of writing 
materials; and set about the letter to her 
friend, the very day. after her introduction 
to her new acquaintances. In the course 
of it, she mentioned her inability, at the 
moment, to give her address, and that, in 
consequence, it might be delayed for a 
few days ; and had just finished directing 
it, when she heard Mrs. Westford calling 
to her. Much alarmed, lest she should 
intrude upon her, she hastily put aside her 
letter, and proceeded to join her, but not 
without taking the precaution of locking 
the door of her chamber, and putting the 
key in her pocket. 

On returning to her chamber, she was 
not a little discomposed at being unable 
to find her letter â€” what had become of it 
she could not conceive, locked as was the 
door of the room ; all she could at length 
conclude was, that in her flurry she had 
unconsciously put it elsewhere than where 
she imagined, and where she should yet 
probably be surprised to find it ; and with- 
out further loss of time, she wrote an- 
other, that if a favourable opportunity oc- 



80 CONTRAST. 

curred for sending it, the same might not 
be lost. 

As if glad to be relieved from her, Mrs. 
Westford encouraged, as much as possible, 
her intimacy with the brother and sister ; 
and that she must be pleased at getting 
rid of her, Adelaide could not doubt, from 
the knowledge she possessed of her senti- 
ments for her ; so truly disagreeable, from 
this circumstance, must her company be 
to her, she was convinced, as to be almost 
confirmed, by the consideration, in the 
persuasion of her being actuated by some 
sinister view in what she had undertaken, 
a persuasion that did not tend to lessen 
her vigilance. 

She had been acquainted with the Ma- 
docs about a week, when on returning one 
day to dinner with them, after one of their 
now customary rambles together, with as 
much carelessness as she could assume, she 
asked where their post-office lay ? 

" Oh, at some distance from this," re- 
plied Miss Madoc ; " so whenever you have 
any letters to send, you may let my bro- 
ther have them, for he sends daily." 

" There is one I am very anxious to have 



CONTRAST. 81 

sent," said Adelaide, producing the letter 
to her friend. 

Miss Madoc held out her hand for it, 
saying, the boy was just going with a 
packet of theirs. 

Adelaide hesitated â€” " Why no," she 
said, " I can't give it till â€” the fact is," 
blushing and stammering, " I don't know 
how to spell the name of this place, spel- 
ling and pronunciation are here so diffe- 
rent." 

" There it is," said Mr. Madoc, writing 
it for her. 

Adelaide immediately added what was 
necessary to her letter, and sealing, deli- 
vered it to him. What was her joy, her 
exultation, as she did so ! she had achieved 
what it was so essential to her to accom- 
plish â€” she had made known to those who 
only could relieve or extricate her from 
them, the embarrassments of her situation ; 
and ere long all might be well again ; and 
she gave herself up, with the natural san- 
guineness of youthful hope, to the sweetest 
contemplations. 

With a heart lightened of an intolerable 
E 3 



82 CONTRAST. 

load of anxiety by what she had accom- 
plished, Adelaide stood this night lingering 
at her chamber window, after the extinc- 
tion of her light, in contemplation of the 
shadowy scene without. It was just such 
a night as the Grecian bard has described, 

" When not a breath disturbs the deep serene. 
And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene ;" 

and Adelaide was literally lost in the 
feelings it excited, when her attention 
became suddenly engaged, by the appear- 
ance of a female, wandering about the op- 
posite cemeteiy. Who was the afflicted 
spirit, Adelaide wondered, that had chosen 
such an hour to indulge her grief? Yet 
she could well understand the feelings that 
led to its indulgence, at such a moment â€” 
the luxury there is, to the real mourner, 
in the idea of being at liberty to weep 
without restraint or observation, she who 
had so often stolen, at the same hour, the 
silent and the lonely, to bathe the grave 
of a mother with her tears. 

At length, the woman crossing from the 
churchyard, entered the court, and ad^ 
vanced straight towards the window at 
which Adelaide was standing, as if for the 



CONTRAST. 83 

purpose of addressing her. Adelaide knew 
not how it was, but a cold shudder came 
over her at the moment, and involuntarily 
she drew back; but instantly recovering, 
from a feeling she was ashamed of, she 
again approached the window; but the 
stranger was gone. 

Convinced that she meant to have spo- 
ken to her, Adelaide was extremely vexed, 
at not having maintained a greater com- 
mand over herself. Yet what could she 
have had to say to her ?â€” on what subject 
wanted to address her ? if for relief, sup- 
posing her an object requiring charity, 
surely it w^as not at such an hour she 
would have thought of applying for this ; 
and yet, except for some such purpose, she 
knew not for what she could have wished to 
speak to her. Yet it might be for an- 
other â€” it might be, that she was a person 
acquainted with some plot, or plan, against 
her ; some such scheme, or design, as she 
but too well knew Mrs. Westford capable 
of contriving or aiding, and dreaded her 
meditating, and who, in consequence, had 
been on the watch, to obtain her attention, 
in order to give her timely warning of it. 



84 CONTRAST. 

As the thought occurred, with a pant- 
ing heart she returned to the window, and 
there kept watch, until all hope of seeing 
again, that night at least, the person who 
had excited so much agitation and anxiety, 
was relinquished ; as she sat musing on the 
incident, should she, or should she not men- 
tion it the ensuing morning to any one, 
became the subject of her consideration. 
While deliberating the matter, with her 
head leaning against the wall, she heard a 
voice whispering in her ear â€” " Beware ! 
beware !" 

Starting up, she looked wildly at the 
place against which she had been leaning, 
but the dead wall alone met her view ; 
and she must have been mistaken in what 
she fancied was her exclamation. Besides, 
who but herself could reply to her unut- 
tered thoughts? And she saw the ne- 
cessity, from what had occurred, of not 
indulging in gloomy musings, lest of her 
imagination at length becoming affected 
by them. 

She had recourse to all the arguments 
that reason could suggest, to try and calm 
the perturbation into which she wa& 



CONTRAST. 85 

thrown ; and at length tried to persuade 
herself she could have derided a recur- 
rence of the terror she had experienced ; 
still she rejoiced at the first indication of 
the dawn. 

While yet at breakfast, Miss Madoc 
entered, impatient to carry her off with 
her, she said, her brother having just re- 
ceived a most delightful w^ork, which he 
purposed reading to them that morning, 
conceiving their intended walk better post- 
poned till the cooler hour of evening. 

Adelaide delayed not preparing her- 
self to accompany her ; but her mind 
almost wholly occupied by the incident 
of the preceding night, she loitered be- 
fore every cottage they came to, in hopes 
of still discovering, in some one of them, 
the stranger, whose tall majestic figure 
was too forcibly impressed upon her ima- 
gination, not to induce a behef of her 
being readily able to recognise her. She 
was disappointed, however, in seeing or 
encountering any one, bearing the least 
resemblance to her. 

More than once, as she pursued her 
way, she was on the point of mentioning 



86 CONTRAST. 

what had occurred to her companion, but 
still checked herself, from the considera- 
tion of the unpleasant curiosity its dis- 
closure might, or would, rather, doubtless 
create. 

She was all impatience for the return of 
fiight, from the hope she indulged of being 
then relieved from the inquietude under 
which she was labouring, through the ap- 
prehension she had given way to concern- 
ing Mrs. Westford ; but though she watch- 
ed throughout it at her window, she saw 
not the stranger again ; and after continu- 
ing to do so for several successive nights, 
to as little purpose, at length relinquished 
the idea altogether of her again making 
her appearance, and which, from her not 
doing, she naturally inferred she must 
have been mistaken in supposing she had 
any thing serious to communicate to her. 

In this conclusion she was almost con- 
firmed, by not meeting with, or being able 
to discover, any thing at all calculated to ex- 
cite suspicion or alarm, in the manner of 
Mrs. Westford; and finally began to hope, 
that against her she would be afraid to prac- 
tise her machinations. 



CONTRAST, 87 

But the composure derived from this 
was of short continuance, so unhappy did 
she become, when the period at which she 
might have received an answer to her let- 
ter passed away without bringing one. 
That it could intentionally be slighted, 
that in vain she could make an appeal to 
those on whose account she was suffering 
so much, was an idea not to be admitted; 
the construction, therefore, she put on the 
silence to it, was, that there was nothing 
satisfactory yet to communicate, and that, 
of course, she must yet longer remain un- 
der the slur cast upon her. 

The thought was a bitter one â€” but she 
would strive to be patient; for was she 
not suffering in a meritorious cause? Yet 
some natural tears would drop, at the ap- 
prehension of lost happiness, the alienated 
esteem and affection of those she loved. 

Every day tended to render her still 
more pleased with her new acquaintances ; 
but they appeared to lay themselves out 
to amuse, and enable her to pass her time 
agreeably. It may seem strange, that it 
never crossed her thoughts, that the at- 
tentions of the gentleman might not be 



B8 CONTRAST, 

quite so disinterested as those of his sister ; 
but she was not given to self-tormenting, 
and it certainly would have been a source 
of pain, the idea of having created a feel- 
ing in the bosom of another, calculated to 
occasion uneasiness, such as an attach- 
ment, that could not be returned, must 
do. Mr. Madoc was agreeable, and well 
informed ; but if still more engaging than 
he was, in vain would he have solicited 
from her any other sentiments than those 
already inspired. 

She had given up all idea of seeing the 
unknown female again, .when one night, 
as she was standing at her window, after 
the extinction of her light, indulging the 
sensations excited by the solemn scene 
without, and enjoying the coolness of the 
balmy air, scented by the fragrance of the 
exhaling plants and shrubs, that were just 
heard faintly rustling in the passing breeze, 
she fancied she saw a shadow moving in 
the court; and the next moment the 
stranger was under her window. 

Adelaide again felt a slight shiver 
through her frame, but she moved not. â€” 
" To obtain this opportunity," said the 



CONTRAST. S9 

unknown, in a low, but still distinct voice, 
and beckoning her, as she spoke, to lean 
still more forward, " you know not what 
I have risked ; but what is there I would 
not risk, to save a fellow- being from mi- 
sery, and that one so young, so interest- 
ing ! I have sought to speak to you, for 
the purpose of putting you on your guard 
against " 

She paused ; for at the instant, a noise, 
resembling a window cautiously opening, 
was heard. Both remained listening for a 
minute. The stranger seemed then on 
the point of turning to Adelaide, when, 
as if something had occurred to heighten 
or confirm her alarm, she suddenly waved 
her hand to her, and disappeared. 

In what a state of inquietude did she 
leave her ! Why, since she had ventured 
so much, as she gave her to infer, not 
venture a little more, rather than leave 
her to be tormented with vague appre- 
hensions? against what did she want to 
caution her ? or of whom ? But how silly 
to be at a loss to surmise â€” of whom had 
she any thing to apprehend but of ^Irs. 
Westford ? But what new mischief could 



90 CONTRAST. 

it be that she had now devised â€” what 
plan or scheme against her ? 

As she tried to conjecture what might 
be probable, an idea suggested itself to 
her, that made her heart sicken with ter- 
ror, and almost decide on considering the 
possibility of flight. But, alas! as she 
weighed this, could she flatter herself, she 
reflected, that, with all the apparent li- 
berty she allowed her, Mrs. Westford had 
not her spies, ready to prevent her taking 
any undue advantage of the circumstance, 
and that, consequently, an effort for the 
purpose would only be likely to occasion 
her still greater unhappiness than already 
experienced? But if she must abandon 
this idea, might she not at least write to 
lord Le Poer? Yet, could she flatter 
herself, that an appeal to him would be 
likely to be attended with success â€” that, 
prejudiced as he was against her, he would 
not be more apt to put such a construction 
on any allegation against Mrs. Westford, 
as might render him still more inveterate 
against her, than pay that attention to it 
she required? and finally, she decided, 
instead of attempting any thing likely to 



CONTRAST. 91 

render her situation worse, to continue 
more than ever on her guard ; and if she, 
at length, saw any decided cause for ap- 
prehension, to, at once, without further 
delay or hesitation, apply to the Madocs 
for their protection or interference. 

Having brought her mind to this deci- 
sion, she at last turned from the window, 
to think of endeavouring to obtain a little 
rest ; as she did so, she beheld a shadowy- 
looking figure leaning against one of the 
bed-posts, earnestly regarding her. At 
this sight Adelaide uttered a piercing 
shriek of agony, and involuntarily veiled 
her eyes with her hands. 

Hardly had this exclamation of terror es- 
caped her, ere the voice of Mrs. Westford was 
heard. Adelaide flew to the door ; but in 
the act of opening it, coming a little to her- 
self, she turned to survey again the cause 
of her terror ; but whatever the object of it 
was, it was gone, and she no longer delayed 
admitting Mrs. Westford.â€”" What's the 
matter. Miss Mountflorence ?" demanded 
the lady, as she advanced into the room, 
with no very complacent look, attended 
by her whole train of domestics, consisting 



92 CONTRAST. 

of the woman who had travelled with 
Adelaide to the castle, and two Welsh 
servants ; " your scream was really enough 
to terrify one: but did you hear or see 
any thing to alarm you?" prying about 
the room, as she asked the question, whilst 
her Welsh servants recoiled towards the 
door, this chamber having the character 
of being a troubled, or, in other words, a 
haunted one. " But the question is foolish, 
for to be sure you must, or you would not 
have terrified one so." 

" What should I hear or see here, 
ma'am, to alarm me ?" Adelaide replied. 

" That's what I want to know," answer- 
ed Mrs. Westford ; " for you could not be 
dreaming, as you were not in bed ; and, 
by-the-by, what, in the name of wonder, 
is it keeps you up after putting out your 
light ? but I suppose you think it pretty 
and romantic to be indulging meditations 
by moonlight." 

*' It can be of no consequence to know," 
replied Adelaide, " more especially as my 
acting so disturbs no one ;" and she pro- 
ceeded to express her regret at the dis- 
turbance she had caused, and to beg, that 



CONTRAST. &S 

as it was seen there was nothing to alarm 
her, she might not be the means of keep- 
ing any one longer from rest. 

Mrs. Westford looked inquisitively at 
her, and again round the room, and then 
out of the window, and then again endea- 
voured to learn what it was had made her 
cry out so; but on this point Adelaide 
was inflexible ; and she was at length again 
left to herself, but not without being sig- 
nificantly told by Mrs. Westford, as she 
was retiring, that she also was in the habit 
of sitting up late. 

Adelaide had no sooner secured her 
door again, than she proceeded to a still 
more minute examination of the chamber 
than jNIrs. Westford, but to as little pur- 
pose ; nothing occurred or was discovered 
that could in any way elucidate or account 
for the recent incident: but could it be 
that she was deceived â€” that after all it was 
but a shadow she' saw â€” a phantom of her 
own creating ? Yet if even she had seen a 
human form, she thought she had seen one 
mournfully regarding her at the foot of the 
bed ; but it could not be â€” there was no clo- 
set, no place of concealment connected with 



94 CONTRAST. 

the chamber; and she at length felt herself 
compelled to give up the belief. But that 
she had seen and heard the stranger, and 
received a warning from her, was not a du- 
bious point ; and the resolve the circum- 
stance led to, rendered her more anxious 
than ever to secure the goodwill of her new 
friends, uncertain as she was of the mo- 
ment in which she might be forced to 
throw herself upon their kindness for pro* 
tection. 

A thousand times, while walking and 
conversing with them, she meditated whe- 
ther she should not at once repose a par- 
tial confidence in them; but she still 
shrunk from the thought, from a faint 
hope of not being driven to any thing so 
desperate as she apprehended. 



CHAP. IV. 

" Farewell ! a word that must be, and hath been â€” 
A sound which makes us linger ; â€” yet â€” farewell." 

From what had happened, how much did 
lord Le Poer rejoice that he had not more 



CONTRAST. 95 

openly acknowledged Adelaide, or allowed 
of her general introduction ! but, with all 
his indignation against her, a feeling of 
pride rendered him unwilling to allow her 
to be held up to public censure ; and lady- 
Dorothy was accordingly appointed to 
frame some plausible pretext for her being 
sent away, and also to try and induce a 
belief that a marriage between her and De 
Montville had never seriously been in 
contemplation ; but with all her ladyship's 
cleverness, this was what she could not 
exactly do in every instance ; lady Ross- 
glen, in particular, was neither to be so 
deceived or misled. She well knew what 
the intention of lord Le Poer was on the 
subject, and had not a doubt that it never 
would have been relinquished, but for his 
inability to carry it into effect, through, of 
course, she concluded, the discovery of 
some prior attachment on the part of Ade- 
laide, and hence the displeasure she had 
incurred ; for it was natural to suppose, 
that had she not in some way or other 
offended her family, she would not have 
been sent away, in the hurried and clan- 
destine manner she was, without any one 



96 CONTRAST. 

knowing whither, or being allowed to take 
leave of her. 

But had she thought proper to ask any 
questions on the subject, she had no op- 
portunity, the subject being too delicate 
to enter upon with Mountflorence, and 
De Montville having departed for England 
almost immediately after Adelaide. Much 
indeed she feared, that the object of this 
unfortunate attachment was one in whose 
concerns she naturally took the deepest 
interest ; that Sigismund, in short, was the 
person secretly beloved by Adelaide. His 
manner, on the present occasion, his re- 
serve with regard to all that had lately oc- 
curred, and evident reluctance to enter 
into any particulars concerning Adelaide, 
all tended to confirm this suspicion, and 
render lady Rossglen seriously unhappy. 
She had long apprehended his being at- 
tached to some one, but till now, she had 
wavered as to the person ; but incertitude 
on the subject now seemed at an end, and 
greatly she deplored being obliged to fix 
on Adelaide as the object of his regard â€” 
not from not greatly admiring her herself, 
but her fear that lord Le Poer would 



CONTRAST. 97 

never overlook the disparity of their for- 
tunes ; and the unhappiness of Sigismund's 
situation was already sufficiently great, 
without having added to it the anxieties 
of a hopeless passion. But while she dwelt 
on this reflection with deep regret, she 
forgot that these were anxieties she would 
herself have subjected him to, had he been 
devoted in the quarter she more than once 
imagined, so determined was the opposi- 
tion she had long decided on giving to 
any preference for Helena, lest otherwise 
it should appear there was foundation for 
the design of which she had been accused 
respecting them: but from any apprehension 
of his indulging one, she was now relieved 
by the persuasion she had yielded to; for 
though his supposed passion for Adelaide 
was a source of deep regret, still it cer- 
tainly did not occasion the unhappiness 
that the discovery of one for Helena would 
have done, from the consideration that, 
with regard to Adelaide, the invidiousness 
of opposing his wishes devolved on ano- 
ther, not herself. 

Equally in the supposition in which 

VOL. II. F 



98 CONTRAST. 

she was confirmed, was Helena â€” the sha- 
dow of a doubt no longer rested on her 
mind, of Adelaide being the beloved of 
Sigismund â€” Adelaide, the happy, the en- 
vied, notwithstanding the tyranny now 
exercised over her : but would this conti- 
nue? would her father still continue to 
punish, because she had sensibility to ap- 
preciate merit? Oh no! she could not 
imagine this; and tried to contemplate 
with calmness the period in which she 
should be called upon, by more than pride, 
to check the sigh that still struggled in 
her breast for Sigismund. 

Yet how difficult did she find an effort 
for the purpose, so still more amiable, 
more engaging, than ever, did he now ap- 
pear ! There was no longer any fluctua- 
tion in his manner â€” no longer any of 
those alternate fits of attention and reserve, 
that had been the occasion of such varia- 
tion of feeling in her breast. He was now 
uniformly all that was tender and friendly, 
as if either the prospect of his approaching 
separation from those he loved had en- 
deared them still more to his regard, or 
he no longer feared any misconception, 



CONTRAST. 99 

from his giving way to the natural kind- 
liness of his disposition : but while he 
tried to sooth, and please, and render 
every one happy about him, it was but 
too perceptible that he was not himself 
what he wished others to be â€” that there 
was a cankerworm in the generous heart 
that felt so much for others. But could 
this be wondered at, even though there 
had not been that secret cause for regret 
and dejection that w^as surmised, when it 
was reflected that he was on the very 
point of seeing the ancient inheritance of 
his family wrested from him? The dis- 
tressing fact could no longer be concealed ; 
and the feehngs of his mother at the dis- 
closure, however attempted to be restrain- 
ed, united to the regrets of sir !^Iaurice, 
and the bitter wailings of the old retainers 
and followers of his house, so overwhelmed 
the spirits of Mountflorence, as to decide 
him on a departure from the neighbour- 
hood, even sooner than was necessary, un- 
der the pretext of his being required to 
make arrangements in person, about the 
exchange he was making to full pay.

Till now, he had entered into no parti- 
culars of this ; but now, when he acknow- 
ledged it was effecting into a regiment ac- 
tually under orders for the East Indies, 
how great was the distress of all at Wood- 
ston ! for in the long, long lapse of years 
that must necessarily intervene till his re- 
turn, what changes might not take place ! 
and lady Rossglen almost, for a few mi- 
nutes, refused to be comforted under the 
affecting thought. 

But was it only those who remained 
behind, that dwelt upon the mournful 
idea? did the sensitive heart of Mount- 
florence himself feel no additional depres- 
sion at the reflection, the melancholy 
thought, how scattered he might find the 
now-happy family at Woodston, should it 
be his destiny to return? how changed, 
how cold, perhaps, those bosoms, now 
glowing with all the ardour of love and 
friendship towards him ! but these are 
trials incidental to all, and he could ex- 
pect no exemption, however poignantly 
he might feel them ; for how tenaciously 
does fond remembrance cling to all we 
have been attached to 1 The exact time

for his departure was not named ; and day 
after day elapsing without its being men- 
tioned, the girls and Helena were often 
almost beguiled into a forgetfulness of its 
being his intention to leave them. 

They had taken a delightful walk one 
evening ; the moment they returned, the 
girls ran into the house, where they had 
left sir jNIaurice and lady Rossglen en- 
gaged with a few select friends, brought 
there, as was afterwards ascertained, that 
evening, by the contrivance of Sigis- 
mund. Helena was following, when he 
detained her, under the pretext of look- 
ing at the vesper star, just rising in the 
west; while all the air was beginning to 
hold that solemn stillness, that so well suits 
the pensiveness of twilight. After re- 
maining some time in conversation on the 
beauty of the hour, and its effect upon 
the mind, ^lountflorence suddenly said he 
would no longer detain her. 

" Detain me !" repeated Helena ; " why, 
are you not coming in with me ?" 

" No." 

" Not romantic enough, surely, to think 
of another ramble by yourself?" 



102 CONTRAST. 

" No, not exactly that, but I â€” I am 
obliged to go away now â€” so good night." 

" Well, if that be the case, good night 
then," said Helena ; " but before you take 
yourself off, give me my glove, which I 
don't know how you contrived to get off 
my hand, while descanting on your fa- 
vourite hour." 

" Oh, some other time," replied Mount- 
florence, affecting to laugh ; " but as a 
pledge for its return, or an equivalent, take 
this," presenting her a flower. 

" Very well â€” I am content ;" and she 
was turning into the hall, when again Sigis- 
mund caught the white hand he had un- 
gloved, and kissed, and kissed, and re- 
kissed it, and pressed it to his heart ; till at 
length Helena hardly knew what to make 
of his conduct, and was beginning to ex- 
press her surprise by her looks, when, as 
if recollecting himself, he suddenly let fall 
her hand, and without the utterance of an- 
other word, darted away. 

" Curious enough all this !" thought 
Helena, as she slowly proceeded to the 
drawing-room ; and she sat meditating on 
it, in a remote corner of the apartment. 



CONTRAST. 103 

without well knowing who was there, or 
whether any one was addressing her, when, 
in the midst of her abstraction, glancing 
at the flower just received, she saw it was 
the little simple one called " forget-me- 
not ;" and instantly, like lightning, it flash- 
'ed upon her mind, that this was a parting 
gift from Sigismund, and that she should 
see him no more. She was not mistaken 
â€” he had thus taken an indirect leave of 
her, unable to endure the pain of taking 
a formal one of either her or any of the 
family. 

The distress occasioned by his depar- 
ture was not at first unmingled v/ith re- 
sentment, believing, as the family did, 
that the bitterness of parting would have 
been lessened, by the opportunity being af- 
forded of expressing what they felt ; but 
gradually they saw his conduct in a differ- 
ent light, and were brought to acknowledge 
that what they denominated cruelty in 
the first instance, certainly deserved to 
be considered as kindness. But in this 
opinion Helena could not be brought to 
coincide. Influenced by her feelings, she 



104 CONTRAST. 

could not forgive Sigismund for acting ajr 
he had done ; and yet, for what purpose 
would she have had his intention avowed ? 
what gratification could she have deriv- 
ed from the circumstance ? She could 
not have suffered herself to weep over 
and bless him, like his mother, or hang 
round his neck like his sisters, and charge 
him to write, and never to forget her. 
No, all she could or must have done, 
would have been to sit with studied in- 
difference, while her heart was bursting;, 
and was it not therefore, after all, as well 
as it was ? She looked at the little flower, 
and kissed it. Did it indeed imply the 
real wish of Sigismund ? but she would 
believe so ; for how soothing was the 
belief of being sufficiently estimated by 
him, to make him evince a wish to be re- 
membered by her ! Her spirits, now de- 
pressed beyond the possibility of imme- 
diate retrieval, in vain reason suggested 
the expediency of what had occurred â€” 
there being little chance, while daily seeing 
and conversing with Mountfiorence, of 
being able to make successful efforts for , 



CONTRAST. 105 

overcoming those sentiments she was 
bound, by so many considerations, to 
subdue; but she found an excuse for 
her dejection, in the seeming change in 
every thing â€” nor was this owing to the 
mere force of imagination. The family 
at Woodston, deeply affected by the de- 
parture of Sigismund, and the circum- 
stances under which it had taken place, 
neither went out nor received visitors as 
usual; while, in addition to his loss, De 
Montville also gone, and Adelaide, the sweet 
â€” the innocent Adelaide, spirited away, 
there appeared a complete breaking up of 
the party that, but a short time before, had 
rendered Woodston such a scene of cheer- 
fulness and gaiety. The season too was, 
by this time, on the decline, for weeks 
circle swiftly round; yet, in the fading 
aspect of nature, the changing hues of the 
trees, the low moaning of the wind, that 
in gusty breezes whirled the leaves aloft, 
the silence of the feathered train, save, 
that still was heard the red-breast, the last 
sweet songster of the closing year, there 
was something that, while it affected, still 

F a 



106 CONTRAST. 

soothed her spmts. But when shall there 
be a second spring for the human heart ? 
she asked herself. These woods will again 
put forth the tender bud â€” the flowers 
wave their green heads on the hills â€” the 
voice of the turtle be heard in the land ; 
but where is the sun that shall revive the 
withered hopes of the afflicted breast ?

â€¢' He builds too low, who builds beneath the sky." 

That nothing is at a stand in human life, 
but that the tide of its affairs continually 
ebbs and flows, is a remark that the ob- 
servation of every day tends to confirm. 
Hence the wretched are led to hope, and 
the happy to be humble ; we behold the 
daily alternations of hope and fear, the 
vicissitudes of fortune, and we learn from 
them, neither to despond in affliction, nor 
to presume in prosperity. 

Sir Maurice had experienced a great 



CONTRAST. 107 

deal of harassing and secret vexation, on 
account of Sigismund. Too late he disco- 
vered, that the confidence reposed in Mr. 
Wetherall was misplaced; and to make 
amends for the injuiy this occasioned, he 
underwent extreme fatigue, but in vain, 
to raise, on his own security, a sufficient 
sum for the extrication of Sigismund's 
affairs. The disappointment affected him 
severely, and united to a cold caught in 
the course of his journeying backwards 
and forwards on the business, occasioned 
symptoms of indisposition, soon after the 
departure of Mountflorence, that at length 
alarmed the family; but he derided the 
fears thus excited, and relying on an ex- 
cellent constitution, refused the advice 
that was recommended. The exertions 
made to dissipate the uneasiness he had 
caused, succeeded with all but lady Ross- 
glen ; but she could not shake off a low- 
ness of spirits, a presageful feeling of sor- 
row, such as she had never before experi- 
enced. In vain she argued with herself â€” 
it was not to be subdued ; and for the first 
time in her life, she became the prey of a 
superstitious dread ; and of all feelings that 



108 CONTRAST. 

harass and torment, there is not one so 
terrible as this foreboding of evil â€” this 
mysterious and inexplicable warning, as it 
appears, of approaching calamity: almost 
we think the shock of an unexpected blow 
would be preferable, to the horrible dread 
with which the apprehension overwhelms 
us. 

One lovely morning, that the warmth 
of summer seemed restored to the air, sir 
Maurice proposed proceeding to the head- 
land to dine, and to render the project 
more agreeable, letting the children be of 
the party. No objection was made, and 
the boat was according immediately or- 
dered : the sail was delightful ; but when 
Helena ascended the headland, how forcibly 
did the lonely scene recall Sigismund to 
mind ! here, where he had been so kind, so 
attentive â€” where the minutes had been so 
pleasingly diversified by his converse ! she 
wandered to the spot where they had sat 
together, and threw herself on the grass, 
that she could almost have fancied still 
owned the impression of his form. She 
sighed â€” how fugitive she thought the 
moments of real delight, and how dearly 



CONTRAST. 109- 

do we pay for them, by the melancholy 
their recollection occasions â€” what a kind 
of death is separation, the long absence of 
a beloved object ! yet it might be endured, 
could we indulge a hope of their returning 
with unaltered feelings; but, alas! how 
seldom is this the case, and how does the 
heart sigh over the idea, that while yet in 
actual existence, they are as if dead to 
those it most loves ! 

Sir Maurice seated himself in a sunny 
nook ; while the attention of lady Ross- 
glen was, for a little while, drawn away 
by some suppliants that had collected 
for charity ; he felt languid and fa- 
tigued, and altogether, that it w^ould not 
be amiss to have the advice that was 
urged. The children, mistaking his look 
of languor for one of melancholy, exerted 
themselves to enliven him, by gambols 
and caresses, and in their efforts for the 
purpose, the elder girls occasionally joined. 
The group were surrounding him, when 
his eye chanced to fall on Helena, as she 
sat apart, pale and dejected, as if belong- 
ing to no one; his arms were instantly 
outstretched to her ; and as he pressed her 



110 CONTRAST. 

to his heart, he made an effort to also en- 
circle her sisters in his arms, as if he wish- 
ed by this to give them to understand his 
anxious desire for unity and affection 
amongst them. 

They lingered on the spot, endeared to 
the invalid by a thousand early associa- 
tions, until compelled to depart by the 
turn of the tide. The sun was just set- 
ting, and at the foot of the promontory sir 
Maurice paused, to contemplate the glo- 
rious spectacle â€” " I am not romantic," he 
said, as he leaned against the rock, with 
his eyes fixed on the glowing horizon, 
" but never do I gaze on this spectacle, 
without thinking of the German poet, who 
likens the setting of the sun, in an even- 
ing like this, calm and lovely, to the dying 
of a virtuous man, sinking from this scene 
in peace and tranquillity, to rise again in 
glory and happiness." 

The place of the setting luminary was 
soon supplied by the moon, at first pale 
and wan, as if a sorrowful wanderer in the 
pathless heavens ; but soon her light be- 
came refulgent, and the wild scenery that 
had experienced a momentary obscurity, 



CONTRAST. Ill 

was again restored to view, under a milder, 
more romantic influence. 

" How beautiful !" said lady Rossglen, 
whose saddened spirit at the moment was 
holding communion with another world ; 
" how grand ! how inexpressibly magnifi- 
cent this far-stretched canopy, gemmed 
with living fires ! yet, accustomed to the 
grandeur of the sight, with what careless- 
ness is it often viewed ! But solitude and 
reflection are requisite to make us con- 
template the works of the Divinity as we 
ought, so astonishingly varied, yet grand 
and sublime, in all their variations." 

" Our admiration of the scene is neces- 
sarily heightened," observed sir Maurice, 
" by the consideration, that those myriads 
of sparkling stars are but the suns of other 
systems, and that the wandering fires that 
move in mystic dance round our illumi- 
nating planet, are, as we are led, from va- 
rious causes, to imagine, the habitations of 
creatures like ourselves, intellectual. 

" One cannot be surprised," lady Ross- 
glen went on, ** when they reflect on the 
stupendous system of the universe, at the 
feeling of insignificance that made David 



112 CONTRAST. 

shrink within himself, and wonder that 
he who made the moon and the stars, and 
rolled them to their destined orbits in the 
heavens, should still be mindful of him." 

" But we are all equally the creation of 
his hands," said Helena ; " and, if I recol- 
lect right, there is a fine paper in the 
Spectator, on the subject of the apprehen- 
sion evinced by the royal psalmist." 

" There is," said lady Rossglen. " Al- 
luding to this apprehension, the writer 
proceeds to prove, by an argument on the 
omnipotence and omniscience of the Deity, 
that he cannot but regard that to which 
he has given life, and that, of course, every 
uncomfortable thought should vanish at 
this conviction. He cannot but regard, 
he says, every thing that has being, espe- 
cially such of his creatures as fear they are 
not regarded by him. He is privy to all 
their thoughts, and to that anxiety of 
mind in particular, which is apt to trouble 
them on occasion ; for as it is impossible 
he should overlook any of his creatures, 
so we may be confident he regards, with 
an eye of mercy, those who endeavour to 
recommend themselves to his notice^ and 



CONTRAST. 113 

in unfeigned humiliation of heart, think 
themselves unworthy that he should be 
mindful of them." 

In this way they continued to converse, 
till the boat touched the shore. Sir Mau- 
rice did not feel better for his excursion ; 
but he resolved to conceal the circum- 
stance till the ensuing morning, from the 
alarm that sending for a medical man, at 
such an hour, would create. Pleading fa- 
tigue, he shortly retired to rest, and the 
family soon after dispersed. 

In her way to her chamber, Helena 
was encountered by one of the collogues 
of the house (Kathleen, the old nurse.) â€” 
" Why then, how is the master to-night. 
Miss ?" she asked. 

" Why indeed, Kathleen, I don't think 
him much better," was the reply. 

" Och ! I feared as much ; there's no de- 
nying it â€” the banshee has been heard !" and 
she applied the corner of her kerchief to her 
eyes. " The banshee ! Ay troth, its true 
enough ; and sure there never was a death in 
this house, or the family belonging to it, 
that the banshee wasn't heard beforehand." 

" Oh, don't be going to frighten me 



114 CONTRAST. 

with any of your idle tales!" said Helena, 
affecting to laugh, but turning pale at the 
instant. 

" Sorrow of word of lie in what I am 
telling you ; the whole of last night, there 
it was sobbing and sighing under the 
windows; and while I was settling the 
mistress's room to-night, didn't there come 
three knocks to the door? and when I 
went to look who knocked, could I see 
any one ? And then, while yez was all 
abroad to-day, what a dismal howling did 
old Darby set up ! and last night, in the 
orchard, just as I was leaving it, with a 
lapfull of windfalls I had been gathering, 
for the poor childer in the cabins, who 
should I see, as I thought, but the master, 
passing me to the little horeen â€¢, leading 
down to the churchyard; and while I was 
thinking to myself what he could be going 
for there, at such an hour, there he was, 
in right earnest, at my elbow, asking me 
what I was considering about." 

" I'll listen to you no longer," said He- 
lena, running away to her chamber ; and 
she wished she had not listened so long, 

â™¦ Green Lane. 



CONTRAST. 115 

for she felt somewhat disconcerted. â€” 
" These old collogues," she said, *' if one 
was in the habit of attending to them, 
their reason would be of little avail ; yet 
how popular are many of their supersti- 
tions, that, in particular, of their belief in 
warnings before death !" 

It was some time before she could bring 
herself to think of rest : from an unquiet 
slumber she was suddenly woke, by a 
wail of sorrow. She started up ; and at 
the same instant, old Kathleen, bursting 
into the room, exclaimed â€” " Oh, Miss 
dear ! Miss jewel ! if you wish to see him 
again, while the breath is in him, make 
haste !" 

Helena sprang from the bed, and flew 
to the chamber of her father ; but all was 
over ere she reached it â€” the kind, the be- 
nevolent sir Maurice, had paid his debt to 
nature; his spirit had ascended to where 
his prayers, and his alms, had already gone 
up before him, as a memorial. 

On the scene of affliction that ensued, 
we shall not dwell â€” a scene too continu- 
ally occurring in life, to need enlarging 
on ; yet, if any thing can add to the grief 



116 CONTRAST. 

occasioned by the loss of a dear relative or 
friend, it is their sudden death, feeling as 
we do, in the first moments of our bereave- 
ment, as if our anguish would not, could 
not have been so great, had time been 
allowed for our fond attentions. 

Letters were immediately dispatched to 
acquaint Mountflorence, and his aunt, lady 
Anstruther, with the melancholy event, 
and which they answered in person. 

Helena was greatly disconcerted by the 
arrival of the latter, having taken to her 
one of those aversions, that render us un- 
reasonable and unjust. Lady Anstruther 
certainly differed in many respects from 
her sister, but still she was not a bad- 
hearted woman â€” there was only a little 
more worldliness in her composition ; she 
was, in short, fond of show, fond of bustle, 
and fond of interfering in what did not 
concern her ; and from yielding to a very 
busy and inquisitive spirit, and assuming 
a tone of dictation in many instances where 
she had no right, often provoked malice, 
and created a degree of ill-will she did not 
altogether merit. Presuming, on the en- 
treaty of sir Maurice, to have an eye to 



CONTRAST. 117 

Helena, she took upon herself to interfere 
in every matter connected with her, and 
that in a way that seemed to say she 
deemed it utterly impossible there could 
be any,thing but immediate acquiescence 
in whatever she suggested. 

In expecting this to be the case, she 
soon found, however, she was mistaken; 
Helena, irritated by her assumption of 
authority, and being of a spirit that 
inclined her neither to be passive or si- 
lent, soon gave her to understand what 
she thought of her interference in her con- 
cerns ; and in consequence, reproaches and 
sarcastic observations were incurred, such 
as at length created a feeling of hostility 
on the part of Helena, sufficiently great to 
make her experience a malicious pleasure 
in having at length an opportunity of 
really vexing and mortifying her lady- 
ship, by her contemptuous rejection of the 
hand of her eldest son, lord Melross, for 
whom she had decided on endeavouring 
to obtain her, from the moment she was 
assured her sister continued firm in her 
determination â€” by-the-by, a most ridicu- 
lous one, in her opinion â€” of opposing the 



118 CONTRAST. 

idea of a union between the young heiress 
and Sigismund. 

Still, notwithstanding this, the first fu- 
ror of the resentment excited by this con- 
duct over, in the mind of the countess, 
she would again, in pity of her having no 
one of taste about her, have given her the 
benefit of her counsel and experience, in 
all matters connected with it; but that 
Helena proudly drew back from any re- 
newal of the intimacy thus interrupted; 
and her sentiments for her ladyship un- 
changed, she was any thing but glad when 
she heard of her arrival at Woodston, con- 
ceiving the circumstance one that boded 
her no good, from naturally concluding 
she possessed some influence over her sis- 
ter, and her consciousness of having given 
her some little cause of offence. 

To make an effort to conciliate where 
she disliked, was a lesson she had not yet 
learned ; and her manner was, in conse- 
quence, so cool, so almost supercilious, on 
this occasion, that in extreme indignation, 
her ladyship vowed, within herself, to have 
nothing more to say to her. 

She had come over undecided how she 



CONTRAST. 119 

would act with respect to her, but she was 
now determined; and indeed she began to 
wonder at not having sooner seen the bad 
poUcy there would be in allowing her to 
take up her establishment under the same 
roof with her sisters, from the advantages 
her superiority of fortune might give her 
over them in the eyes of many. 

She justly considered lady Rossglen as 
a most amiable and exemplary woman; 
but with regard to worldly prudence, de- 
plorably deficient; as a proof of which, was 
her using no effort to obtain Helena for Si- 
gismund, though such a prize as she would 
have proved to him ; neither to secure 
lord Selwyn for Carohne ; and accordingly, 
from the contemptuous opinion she had of 
her in this instance, she decided, the in- 
stant she heard of sir Maurice's death, on 
proceeding to Ireland, to arrange matters for 
getting the girls under her own manage- 
ment, as by far the best qualified person to 
have the regulation of them ; besides, con- 
ceiving, that being chaperon to two hand- 
some, fashionable girls, would not be a 
disagreeable circumstance, from the flatter- 
ing attentions it was calculated to lead to. 



120 CONTRAST. 

Girls brought up as they were, that is, 
in a kind of unsophisticated state, as she 
termed it, would readily, she imagined, 
allow of an ascendancy to be obtained over 
them; and should they chance to form 
splendid alliances, than which nothing was 
more probable, if once under her guidance, 
what might not then be the agreeable re- 
sult to her â€” additional influence in the 
fashionable world. In deciding about them, 
she had hesitated a little, whether she 
would not also extend her good offices to 
Helena; but the manner in which the 
young lady thought proper to conduct 
herself to her on her arrival, put an end to 
any further idea of that kind, and deter- 
mined her on not only not including her 
in the invitation she proposed giving the 
rest of the family to her house in Caven- 
dish-square, but on also doing all in her 
power to effect an estrangement between 
them. 

In grief for the dead, lady Rossglen did 
not forget her duty to the living; she 
knew it was the intention of their father 
to have given the girls the advantage of a 
winter or two in London; and accordingly 



CONTRAST. 121 

made no objection to the countess's pro- 
posal of accompanying her there on her 
return ; indeed, none could be made, ex- 
cept on account of Helena, from whom it 
necessarily separated her, in consequence 
of the determination of lady Anstruther ; 
but then, as a consolation for this, she had 
affectionate friends immediately to repair 
to. 

The arrangement thus formed was a 
cruel one for Helena, attached as she had 
become to her native home, and to her na- 
tural connexions ; but it w^as only a confir- 
mation of what she had feared from the 
malice of the countess, forgetting that this 
was not altogether unprovoked â€” a confir- 
mation of a presageful fear that, in losing 
her father, she lost the link that united 
them to her. 

Was this the way in which they atten- 
ded to what might, alas ! be termed his dy- 
ing wish for their living together in unity, 
as evinced in their visit to the headland? 
and how could lady Rossglen reconcile 
herself to her quitting her protection in 
this manner? losing sight, in the deep

122 CONTRAST. 

wound inflicted on her feelings by the cir-- 
cumstance, the extravagant terms in which 
she had been in the habit of speaking of 
the Bridgemores to her â€” sometimes, from 
a little spleen, sometimes from a feel- 
ing that would not have her think she 
had none but her to look to for kindness 
or attention : but she would not complain 
â€” pride must prevent .that : she would 
leave it to time, to reflection, to point out 
the unkindness of the present arrange- 
ment â€” an arrangement that induced her 
to think she could not but be regarded as 
an intruder where she was; and under the 
saddening idea of deeming herself such 
under the paternal roof, she was more than 
once tempted to precede the party to 
London ; but still checked the impulse 
that instigated her to this, from her ina- 
bility to tear herself away, without a strug- 
gle, from a place so loved : but she would 
keep as much away as possible from the 
family â€” she would not give them cause to 
say, she was a hindrance or annoyance to 
them ; and accordingly, instead of seek- 
ing either to impart or receive consolation, 
absented herself almost entirely from the 



CONTRAST. 123 

house, and in melancholy wanderings 
about the silent and now-deserted grounds, 
passed her time, bidding, in the romantic 
feelings of her heart, a fond, it might be 
a last, farewell, to the delightful scenes of 
happier hours. 

She wished to visit tiie grave of her pa- 
rents before her departure, and one gloomy 
evening bent her steps in the direction of 
the lonely road the funeral of her father 
had so lately marked. An ancient tomb 
covered the sepulchre of the family. With 
difficulty she made her way to it, so un- 
equal was the surface of the ground, and 
completely choked up every path with 
danky weeds. Nothing indeed could be 
more wild, or waste, or desolate, than was 
the aspect of the place, lying open as it 
was to every intrusive foot, and belonging 
to one of those numerous dilapidated 
churches that are scattered over Ireland, 
Every thing here spoke of mortality, and 
the effects of time : white bleached bones 
were scattered about, while many of the 
graves were tenantless, from their great 
antiquity, and long exposure to the pier-

cing winds, and plashing rains, and melting 
snows, of revolving ages. If the strongest 
minds cannot always successfully struggle 
against the chilling emotions, the awful 
sensations, excited by a visit to mortality, 
how much less could it be expected that 
one that had never yet given itself time 
for deep reflection, could do so ? Helena 
shuddered and wept; and while a feeling 
of chill dismay would have hurried her 
from the spot, she was still detained by 
the thought, that he so lately loved and 
honoured, the life and ornament of the 
social circle, was now reposing within a 
few yards of her. 

She sat down beside the old tomb of 
the family, just where a solitary tree threw 
the shadow of its skeleton arms upon the 
marble, and sought to look within the 
grating that had so lately opened to admit 
the remains of her father to their destined 
bed â€” and was the cold, wet earth, this 
bed ? was he, who, but a few days ago, 
was the source of joy and happiness to all 
around him â€” was he now nerveless, voice- 
less, senseless â€” already given up to the 
worm? and she wept still more bitterly 



CONTRAST. 125 

at the images conjured up by a fertile 
fancy, too ingenious in tormenting itself. 
But he was lamented; and if the departed 
can look down, must not the kind, do- 
mestic tear, be pleasing to them ? But she 
â€” she, were it her lot to go hence that 
hour, what complaint would there be â€” 
what tear to please her pale ghost, or 
grace her mournful bier? should she not 
be allowed to pass away, like a flake of 
snow â€” like a morning mist â€” or like a val- 
ley-flower, that opes its golden cups at 
sunrise, and shuts at eventide? and her 
falling tears streamed more profusely at 
the idea. 

Night darkened round her, but still she 
lingered in the melancholy scene, for who 
was there inquiring for her? who anxious 
for her return home? and she attempted 
not to move, when she was startled by a 
rustling in the grass, and turning, she be- 
held Mountflorence slowly approaching â€” 
but evidently not to seek her, the emotion 
evinced on seeing her, proved. In a mo- 
ment, however, recovering from the con- 
fusion he betrayed at her sight â€” " Is this 
kind," he said, " to pain your friends by 



126 CONTRAST. 

yielding to this melancholy?" and he took 
her hand, and proceeded to urge every 
thing that was likely to sooth and console, 
reminding her of the numerous blessings 
she still possessed. 

" Yes," replied Helena, with a bitter 
smile, " if you call rank and affluence 
blessings, I know I possess them ; but in 
this hour of affliction, I feel how inade- 
quate they alone are to assuage the sor- 
rows of the heart ; how gladly would I re- 
linquish some of these coveted advantages, 
for the sake of finding myself connected 
by kindred ties to life !" 

" 1 do not exactly comprehend you," 
said Mountflorence; ** surely you cannot 
think yourself devoid of such ?" 

What reply she might have made to 
this observation cannot be said, for at this 
instant they were joined by the two girls, 
who, seriously alarmed at her protracted 
absence, ceased not till they had succeeded 
in tracing her to the lonely spot. 

Helena, imputing their joining them 
more to anxiety to regain the company of 
Sigismund than to any about her, was 
grave in her answers to them, more es- 



CONTRAST. 127 

pecially as she could not help being a lit- 
tle disconcerted by the circumstance; 
this being the first opportunity that had 
occurred, since the arrival of Sigismund, 
through the many painful matters that 
had devolved on him, for any particular 
conversation between them, and which, 
of course, was now prevented; and she 
could not help being anxious to learn 
whether his exchange was effected, or if 
delayed through any hope respecting 
Adelaide. 

At length, the day for leaving Wood- 
ston arrived ; the party crossed over to 
Milford, and thence proceeded, by easy 
stages, to the metropolis â€” Helena in the 
carriage with Mountflorence and his mo- 
ther.

CHAP. VI. 



â€¢â€¢ Alas ! our young affections run to waste. 
Or water but the desert ; whence arise 
But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste, 
Kank at the core, though tempting to the eyes â€” 
Flowers, wliose wild odours breath but agonies, 
And trees whose gums are poison ; such the plants 
Which spring beneath her steps, as Passion flies 
O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants 
For sorae celestial fruit forbidden to our wants." 



Greatly as was lady Rossglen affected 
at quitting her beloved home, she was 
cheerful and composed to what Helena 
was at the circumstance. But Helena had 
a cause for regret which she had not : lady 
Rossglen was not about being separated 
from those she fondly clung to, neither 
going to a residence she disliked, both of 
which was the case with Helena; for, 
with those variations of feeling to which 
she was liable, she had conceived a down- 
right decided aversion to the dwelling in 
which she had been brought up ; she still 



CONTRAST. 129 

considered the Bridgemores as good kind 
of affectionate creatures, or, in other 
words, had that kind of instinctive regard 
for them which early associations inspire : 
but her very soul loathed the idea of being 
again their inmate, from the very different 
society to which she had been accustomed 
since quitting them. But it could not be 
avoided; no establishment had yet been 
formed for her, or could well be, till she 
was of age, and she must therefore submit 
to necessity. 

On reaching town, the party separated, 
lady Anstruther, with the girls, to pro- 
ceed to her residence in Cavendish-square, 
and lady Rossglen to Rathbone-place, to 
drop Helena. " God bless you, my dear 
child !" she cried, on the carriage stopping 
at Mr. Bridgemore's ; "remember," kissing 
her cheek, " that the interest I feel for 
you is a maternal one. I may not be able 
to see you to-morrow ; but if not, I shall 
certainly send to inquire after you." 

" And mind, my dear mother, I engage 
myself to be your messenger," said Mount- 
florence, with at least an effort at a smile, 
g3 



130 CONTRAST. 

as he stood waiting at the carriage door to 
give his hand to Helena. 

Helena attempted to say something; 
but the power of utterance was lost in 
emotion : for a minute she clung to lady 
Rossglen, then darting from the carriage, 
she rushed into the house, and, regardless 
of the Bridgemores, threw herself upon a 
seat, and wept bitterly. 

" Come, come, my dear," cried Mr. 
Bridgemore, at length interposing, on find- 
ing his wife's efforts to sooth her unavail- 
ing, " this is really weakness," affecting to 
mistake the cause of her emotion, though 
but too well aware of it ; " consider, my 
dear, you are not the first who has lost a 
father." 

" No, that she is not, by many," sighed 
Mrs. Bridgemore, the echo of her husband ; 
" to my sorrow I say it ; for when I lost 
my father, I am sure I lost my best friend." 

" Had his death left you destitute, that 
would have been a very different case in- 
deed," resumed Mr. Bridgemore ; " but 
thanks to those who prevented any thing 
of the kind, by having your mother's for- 
tune secured to you." 



CONTRAST. 131 

" His own principles, his own feelings, 
would have done that !" exclaimed Hele- 
na, indignantly. She paused ; her now 
uncovered eyes wandered round the room, 
and then rested on the Bridgemores. â€” 
" And is it possible," she demanded of her- 
self, " that this is the place I was so un- 
willing to quit ? these the companions I 
wished to have remained with? What a 
change in my feelings since that period ! but 
is it for my happiness ?" and again she wept 
at the thought of the separation that had 
just taken place. â€” " How dingy everything 
appears here," she said, again withdrawing 
the handkerchief from her eyes, " after the 
clearness, the brightness of a country at- 
mosphere; and then these dissonant cries !" 

" Why, yes," said Mr. Bridgemore, in a 
tone of pique, *' we can't exactly expect 
the same pure bright atmosphere in town 
that you have in the country, especially 
in a street of this description." 

" And why do you live in a close, nar- 
row street ?" asked Helena, in an accent, 
that spoke her thoughts rambling at the 
moment. 

" Why do I live in a close, narrow 



132 CONTRAST. 

Street!" repeated Mr. Bridgemore, evidently 
much offended ; " why, ma'am, because it 
has hitherto suited my convenience ; and 
disagreeable as it may now appear, or has 
been made to appeai^^ by the representations 
of others, I remember the tim.e when you 
would not have found fault with this resi- 
dence ; and you must allow me to tell you, 
Miss Rossglen, that what your grandmo- 
ther was satisfied with, I rather think you 
should not have expressed yourself in such 
a manner about." 

" Ah, my poor dear grandmother ! but 
she was so easily pleased ; only to let her 
have her own way, or appear to rule, and 
be satisfied that she w^as regarded by those 
she resided with, and she was content ; but 
you must recollect she never intended this 
for a permanent residence." 

** Well, no matter, no matter, what she 
intended," pacing the room in apparent 
agitation ; " but this I must say, that I 
am hurt, greatly hurt, to find new friends 
so readily caused old ones to be forgotten ; 
or, in other words, that a young person, 
brought up with us, and loved as our own. 



CONTRAST. 133 

should feel herself so unhappy at finding 
herself again with us." 

" Ay, no wonder indeed !" said Mrs. 
Bridgemore ; " I can't say how it hurts me," 
plumping down upon a seat, and, Hke Tag, 
preparing for woe, by producing her hand- 
kerchief; " but my mind misgave me, 
how it would be â€” I guessed, when once 
they had her at Woodston, nothing would 
be scrupled to wean her from us." 

" Then, for once at least, ma'am, you 
guessed erroneously," cried Helena, indig- 
nantly ; " so far from using any arts to es- 
trange me from you, I much doubt whe- 
ther you ever, for a moment, occupied 
the thoughts of any one there." 

" Oh no, I suppose not," said Miss 
Frances, with a flounce on her chair ; " not 
deemed of sufficient consequence for that." 

" If you choose to put a wrong construc- 
tion upon what I say, I cannot help it," 
returned Helena ; " but I will not hear 
those I love and reverence unjustly ac- 
cused, without resenting it. But how is 
this ? I seem to have offended every one !" 
and it must be allowed she had given suf- 
ficient provocation for this, such as would 



134 CONTRAST. 

hardly have been passed over, but for mo- 
tives of policy ; " and you in particular, 
Fanny," she added ; " why, your features 
have not once relaxed into a smile since 
my arrival. Come, I am sure you should 
know me too well, to easily take offence at 
any thing I say ;" and she extended her 
hand as she spoke. 

But instead of accepting it, IMiss Fran- 
ces turned haughtily away. The fact was, 
she detested Helena, both from the envy 
with which she had early inspired her, and 
her having latterly proved her rival, in the 
admiration of a person she herself admired, 
almost to a degree of idolatry, namely, sir 
Osbert Henley, whose specious graces and 
rank in life had so captivated her imagi- 
nation, as to render her ready to make al- 
most any sacrifice for his sake; and though 
aware of the policy of keeping well with 
Helena, still such were the malignant feel- 
ings she had excited in her bosom, that 
she could not always deny herself the plea- 
sure of giving some little way to them. 
But though her crafty father had thought 
proper to appear a little displeased with 
Helena, as a means of making her recol- 



CONTRAST. 135 

lect herself, he by no means chose his 
family to do so, lest of the circumstance 
occasioning her at once to fly off, as, to his 
extreme dismay, she seemed so well in- 
clined ; and accordingly, in a voice that 
made the young lady at once recollect her- 
self â€” " Frances," he exclaimed, *â€¢' I am 
surprised at you !" 

" Fan," cried her mother, " I wonder 
at you !" 

" Well, say no more on the subject," 
said Helena, advancing to the still-pout- 
ing, though now-alarmed Miss Frances, 
and kissing her cheek ; "lam sure you 
all love me; and with this conviction on 
my mind, can you suppose I would do 
any thing intentionally to hurt or offend ?" 

And to atone for what had occurred, 
she tried to rally herself, to appear cheer- 
ful; but she was a bad dissembler; she 
could not feel reconciled to her change of 
abode; comparisons would suggest them- 
selves, and contrasts strike her, that ren- 
dered her every moment still more and 
more dissatisfied at the circumstance. 
But was not this ungrateful, persuaded as 
she was of the sincere regard of the Bridge- 



136 CONTRAST. 

mores, and sensible that but for having 
had their house to repair to, she might, 
through the cruel arrangement of the ma- 
licious countess, have been placed in an 
unpleasant predicament, compelled to take 
up her abode amongst strangers, where 
she could not possibly expect that kind 
attention she was sure of where she was. 

The moment she retired for the night, 
all the malevolence she had inspired burst 
forth. â€” " For this insolence, this ingrati- 
tude, she shall dearly pay," cried Mr. 
Bridgemore. " Now that I see the depen- 
dence to be placed on her regard, I shall take 
care not to leave it to her gratitude to re- 
compence me for all the trouble I have had, 
both with her and that old fool, her grand- 
mother : such fickleness, such inconstancy, 
deserve punishment, and they shall meet 
with it. If I had had any previous com- 
punction concerning her, the conduct of 
this day would have settled it. But I need 
not remind you how necessary, for the 
present, to keep our real sentiments to 
ourselves : she is not only hasty, but shrewd 
and penetrating ; and since, miraculously, 
as I may almost say, thrown back into 



CONTRAST. 137 

our hands, it would be enough to drive 
one mad, to allow her to again escape from 
them, without taking proper advantage of 
the circumstance." 

" Certainly," assented his wife ; " but," 
lowering her voice, and drawing her chair 
close to his, " what's your plan, my dear, 
respecting her ?" 

" Excuse me, my dear, for not answer- 
ing that question, but I have always found 
a person's own breast the safest repository 
for a secret they do not wish divulged. 
What I meditate will be known by the 
result; but till then, silence. In the mean 
time, I must again observe, a good deal 
of address or management will be requi- 
site, to enable me to accomplish what I 
wish. I must therefore beg there may be 
no further display of this young lady's airs 
here." 

" My airs !" repeated Miss Frances, in- 
dignantly ; " I am sure I don't know what 
is meant by my airs." 

" Why, the way in which you conduct- 
ed yourself to Miss Rossglen to-day." 

" The insolent ! I am sure I have no 
reason to love her." 



138 CONTRAST. 

" Neither have I ; nor is it out of any 
regard I bear her I reprimand you for 
your behaviour to her, but entirely from 
pohcy ; if for her sake, then indeed you 
might rebel: but no, child, I care as 
little for her as you can possibly do; but 
we have a deep game to play : 'tis only 
by artifice we can hope to regain that as- 
cendancy over her we've lost by her visit 
to Woodston, and without which 'twere 
idle to look for the accomplishment of our 
plans. Be counselled, therefore; unite 
with your mother and me in endeavour- 
ing to conciliate her ; and perhaps, in less 
time than you imagine, you may be en- 
abled to vie with her in those matters 
that have alone given her any superiority 
over you." 

" Oh, if I could but think so, Serena 
herself never acquired a greater command 
over her temper than I should over mine !" 

" I don't know who you mean by Se- 
rena; but this I repeat, if my projects are 
not marred by obstinacy and self-conceit, 
I have very little doubt of their succeed- 
ing." 

" And then," said Miss Frances. 



CONTRAST. 139 

" And then," said her father, " from 
having the power of freeing sir Osbert 
from his difficulties, there will be no fur- 
ther hindrance to your union with him." 

By this it will appear that sir Osbert 
sought consolation for the loss of one lady, 
by paying his addresses to another ; but 
they were compulsory to MissBridgemore; 
he was in the power of her father, and 
knew not how, therefore, to draw back 
from the proposition of an alliance with 
her. 

Helena rose the next morning, with a 
heaviness of heart that she could not imme- 
diately shake off. She missed the twitter- 
ing of the swallow at her window, the 
pure reviving breezes from the sea, and, 
in short, a thousand agreeable things, that 
still rendered her dissatisfied and melan- 
choly ; but the solicitude evinced to please 
her, had, at length, the effect of making 
her rally herself a little; and still more, 
the expectation she w^as in of an early 
visit from some one in Cavendish-square. 

But against her receiving this, or, if 
possible, allowing her to have any further 
communication with any one there, the 



140 CONTRAST. 

Bridgemores were determined, lest other- 
wise, without effecting a complete es- 
trangement in that quarter, their efforts 
to attach her to themselves should be un- 
availing. Helena, in the irritation of her 
feelings, had given full utterance to her 
dislike to the countess ; and on this avow- 
ed dislike they built, for being enabled to 
make her believe whatever they wished. 

Soon after breakfast Miss Bridgemore 
proposed their paying a visit to madame 
La Rouge, to look at some of the sweetest 
things, she had just brought over from 
Paris; but with the expectation Helena 
entertained, to get her out was beyond her 
power ; she contrived, however, to occupy 
her attention, so as to prevent her hear- 
ing those sounds that would have set her 
heart palpitating. Hour after hour passed 
away, and still no message, no visitor, ar- 
rived from Cavendish-square. What could 
be the meaning of this ! but she would 
not yet give up the hope she was indul- 
ging; and she accordingly remained sta- 
tionary till the morning was over, when 
suddenly starting up, with a face glowing 
with indignation, she told Frances she 



CONTRAST. 141 

would no longer prevent her going out ; 
and the carriage being in readiness, they 
immediately proceeded to it. 

" What could be the meaning of this ?" 
she repeated to herself; " the cause of this 
slighting treatment ? â€” was she already 
thought of with indifference? â€” or had 
they only wanted to get rid of her com- 
pletely, to break with her entirely ? If 
major Mountflorence could not call, sup- 
posing lady Rossglen and her daughters 
so occupied as to want either leisure or in- 
clination, surely another messenger might 
have been found to make an inquiry after 
her. But no matter; she would think no 
more of them, till they evinced their 
thinking of her. Spite of this resolve, 
however, hardly had she stepped from the 
carriage on her return, ere she inquired 
whether any one had been there during 
her absence, from Cavendish-square. The 
answer was in the negative; and again 
her cheek became crimsoned with the 
glow of indignation. 

But neither Mountflorence, or his mo- 
ther, as may perhaps be surmised, merited 
the displeasure thus experienced by He- 



142 CONTRAST. 

lena. At an early hour the former was 
in Rathbone-place, with a note from the 
latter, signifying her being so indisposed 
after her journey, as to be unable to leave 
her dressing-room, and requesting Helena 
to come and pass the day with her. To 
his inquiry for Helena, he was answered 
she was out. Rather discrediting this, he 
desired his card might be taken up ; but 
he was again assured she was not within ; 
and leaving the note, with a message that 
he should call again in the course of the 
morning, he departed. 

About the time he intimated, he was 
again at Mr. Bridgemore's door; but He- 
lena was again denied to him, with this 
addition, that in the interim she had been 
in â€” " And went out again without leaving 
any message for me?" said Mountflorence. 

" Yes, sir." 

" And you are positive the note I left 
for her was delivered ?" 

" Oh yes, sir, positive; I gave it into 
her hand myself." 

" Strange," thought Mountflorence, as 
he turned away from the door; and he 
was musing on the circumstance, when it 



CONTRAST. 143 

struck him, that, in alarm at his mother's 
indisposition, she had hurried off to Ca- 
vendish-square, the moment she perused 
the note ; and thither, under the idea, he 
now hastened himself; but he was disap- 
pointed â€” no Helena had preceded him ; 
nor was there any answer to the note he 
had taken. Well, from this he was con- 
vinced she would yet come, and in mo- 
mentary expectation of hearing her an- 
nounced, remained stationary the principal 
part of the day; when suddenly recollect- 
ing some other calls he had to make, he 
again sallied forth ; again his steps were 
directed to Rathbone-piace â€” but not again 
to Mr. Bridgem ore's. Opposite to his house 
a military friend was lodging, whom he 
wished to see, and on him he now called. 
He found him stationed at a window, re- 
connoitering some one with his glass, in 
the opposite house. â€” '* JMaking observa- 
tions ?" said Mountflorence, with seeming 
carelessness, but a little anxiety, from a 
suspicion of the fact. 

" Faith, yes ; there's a devilish fine girl 
in the opposite drawing-room, that I have 
been watching the whole morning." 



144 CONTRAST. 

" The whole morning !" repeated Mount- 
florence, with involuntary emphasis, from 
his solicitude to ascertain whether it was 
really, as he now began to suspect, namely, 
that Helena had been denied to him. 

" Yes ; but I apprehend I shall soon 
lose the pleasure I have been enjoying; 
for, you perceive, there's a carriage in 
waiting; and see, the divinity is about 
entering it;" and jNIountflorence beheld 
Helena coming out from the hall. 

Well, after this, he could no longer 
doubt what he had suspected; here was 
proof positive of a wish to decline seeing 
him. To what sudden whim or caprice 
could this be owing? or had she taken 
offence at any thing ? Yet no, for no 
possible cause of offence had been given 
her : the only way in which he could ac- 
count for the circumstance was, by sup- 
posing she was anxious to enjoy, without 
interruption, the pleasure derived from 
her return to the friends she had been se- 
parated from ; and in a state of agitation, 
at the preference this seemed to argue for 
them, to those she had left, that, consider- 
ing what she thought of his attachment 



CONTRAST. 145 

to another, would rather have puzzled and 
surprised Helena, he returned once more 
to Cavendish-square. 

An aching head, and an aching heart, 
were about inducing Helena to retire after 
dinner, when in bounced the dowager lady 
Lovel, with two or three dashers of her 
own standing â€” that is to say, ladies a lit- 
tle advanced beyond the exact period of 
blooming youth â€” just apprized of the re- 
turn of her enchanting Helena, and come 
to carry her off to Drury-lane, where his 
IVIajesty was going that evening, and, of 
course, the whole world of fashion. 

Helena hesitated. But no, she would 
not go ; she was too much disconcerted by 
the disappointment of the day, to be able 
to rally her spirits sufficiently for the purpose. 
Yet, what weakness, to feel the circumstance 
as she did! to give up amusement, on ac- 
count of those who had, probably, not be- 
stowed one thought on her since the mo- 
ment of their separation. Instead of beincr 
driven to solitude by their implied indiffe- 
rence, why not rather, by the chance of con- 
fronting them in public, let them see that 

VOL. II. H 



146 CONTRAST. 

their notice was a matter of very little im- 
portance to her ? and finally, yielding to 
the suggestions of pride and resentment, 
she hurried away to make some slight al- 
teration in her dress, and accompanied by 
Frances, wearing a set of splendid orna- 
ments presented to her that morning as a 
peace-offering, allowed herself to be w^hirl- 
ed off to the theatre. 

Here she had not been many minutes, 
ere the brilliant scene it presented began 
to produce something of a counter change 
in her romantic feelings, inducing her to 
think, that, after all, it was not so intole- 
rable, at such a season, to be transported 
away from the dismal sounds of winds and 
waves ; yet, at the very moment, could 
she have been assured of finding there, 
with unaltered feelings, those she loved, 
how gladly would she have flown back to 
the scenes just quitted ! 

jyiountflorence, without well knowing 
whither he was going, was departing, 
shortly after dinner, when, catching him 
by the arm, lord Melross inquired, had 
he forgot his promise of accompanying 
him that night to the theatre ? Mount- 



CONTRAST. 147 

florence replied by begging to be excused ; 
but his lordship, declaring that he had 
promised lady Bellair, and lady this, and 
lady that, who were all expiring to behold 
him again, that he should have the felicity 
of exhibiting him that night, would not 
let him off. 

Hardly had he entered the house, ere 
his eyes wandering round the dress circle, 
encountered Helena, apparently restored 
to ail her wonted animation. He could 
scarce believe what he saw â€” a feelino^ of 
indignation flushed his cheek. Was this 
the regard she professed for his mother? 
this her regret for her father â€” ere her first 
deep mourning for him was cast aside, to 
rush into public again? was this she, 
whom, but a few days ago, he had sur- 
prised weeping over a parent's tomb? this 
the sentimental young lady, now evi- 
dently looking round her for admiration, 
who had so recently expressed her sorrow, 
that times would not allow of the roman- 
tic seclusions of other days, in which the 
heart might have leisure and opportunity 
to recollect itself, and become better? â€” 
H 2 



148 CONTRAST. 

" Oh, thou Cynthia of the minute !" he 
involuntarily exclaimed, " what depen- 
dence is to be placed on thy professions, 
evidently varying, as thy feelings do, with 
every changing scene ?" 

Lord INIelross was seldom stationary for 
any long time in public, depending a good 
deal on the noise and bustle he occasioned 
for the notice he was ambitious of obtain- 
ing; accordingly, he soon left his com- 
panion ; and Mountflorence, shortly after, 
vacating bis seat, kept wandering about 
the house, till, he knew not how, he found 
himself in the next box to Helena. 

She did not immediately perceive him ; 
but when she did â€” '* AVhat, you here ?" 
she exclaimed, with a deepening colour, 
the effect of surprise, or some other emo- 
tion, at so unexpectedly beholding him, 
and in such a tone as she had never before 
assumed towards him, her angry and re- 
sentful feelings not lessened, by finding 
him able to come into public, though not 
to call upon her; and, with her eyes 
purposely roaming about as she spoke, in 
order to give a still greater air of carekss 
indifference to her manner â€” " Did you 



CONTRAST. 149 

come by yourself â€” or, I mean, have the 
girls been tempted to accompany you ?" 

" No." 

" What, not sufficiently recovered from 
the dislocations of the road ?" 

" Say rather, not yet sufficiently reco- 
vered from the pain inflicted by a still se- 
verer cause of suffering !" and he turned 
to the stage, lest of further betraying the 
indignant feeling excited by her superci- 
lious tone, and air of half notice. 

Helena felt a momentary shock ; for 
what was to be inferred from this an- 
swer, but that she had acted contrary to 
his sense of feeling and propriety ? Yet, 
how extremely impertinent to allow her 
to imagine so ! What right had he to anim- 
advert on her conduct ? he, who had al- 
ready given such proof of indifference about 
her â€” of her being indebted to the chance 
that had placed them for a short time un- 
der the same roof, for any attention he 
paid ? and quickly recovering herself, she 
laughed deridingly, and set about coquet- 
ting with the beaux about her. 

In this assumption of levity, there was 
something so defying, as to render Mount- 



150 CONTRAST. 

florence hardly able to command himself. 
More than once he was on the point of 
quitting her vicinity, but was still pre- 
vented by a feeling he could not have de- 
fined; when at length opening the box 
door, " So you are here, Mountflorence?" 
cried lord Melross. " Why, what the 
deuce did you give me all this trouble for? 
Here I have been to every box in the 
house, I believe, looking for you, lady 
Bellair and her party vowing it was all a 
hoax my saying you were come back. â€” 
And are you again visible ?" he added, af- 
fecting only now to have seen Helena. 

" Except eclipsed by brighter satellites," 
was the reply. 

" Oh ! that were impossible, for at least 
half a hundred years to come ;" and seiz- 
ing the arm of Mountflorence, he dragged 
him away. 

With him vanished all further incite- 
ment to the levity assumed by Helena, 
and the assumption of which she now began 
to regret. There might have been some 
sufficient cause for her not receiving the 
visit expected, that day, as also for her not 
hearing, through any other medium, from 



CONTRAST. 151 

Cavendish-square. Why had she not con- 
sidered this in time? but, as usual, she 
suffered her feelings to hurry her away, 
and had thus probably prevented an ex- 
planation that might have satisfied her as 
to what had angered and vexed her. 

^Vould that she could speak to him 
again that night, if it were but for a mi- 
nute, that she might try to do away the 
injury she had probably done herself 
with him, by the manner she had as- 
sumed ; but there was but little chance 
of an opportunity being afforded for this, 
for was he not taken away to join the 
party of one of the most beautiful wo- 
men in town, well calculated, by the 
witchery of her smiles and the blandish- 
ments of her manner, to console a hopeless 
lover for any disappointment he was en- 
during? 

In a state of mind that precluded her 
making one of lady Lovel's loo-party, she 
quitted the house. Miss Frances, how- 
ever, supplied her place at the card-table, 
so that the dowager was not quite disap- 
pointed of touching a little of Helena's 
cash, she being JNIiss Bridgemore's banker,

who, though equal to her ladyship in many 
respects, was certainly not equal to her in 
the mysteries of the card-table. 

What the relief of this young lady was, 
on seeing IMountflorence retire, without 
any explanation being attempted with 
Helena, may be conceived, being in mo- 
mentary dread of one taking place, and, of 
course, a complete check given to the ma- 
chinations forming at home.

" La belle Helena." 

" Impossible !" 

" I appeal," cried the viscount, turning 
to Sigismund. 

" Well, really I could scarcely have 
imagined this!" was the exclamation of 
both sisters. 

" And why so, pray may I ask, young 
ladies ?" demanded the countess. 

" Oh ! from a variety of causes, but in 
particular from knowing mamma was ill, 
and desired her company." 

The countess laughed satirically â€” " And 
you are really surprised she did not prefer 
sitting with her to the gratification of ap- 
pearing in public ?" 

" Yes, certainly." 

" And why so ?" 

" From conceiving her so good-natured ; 
and the very great affection she evinced 
for mamma." 

** As if every one that evinced affection

to the pleasing delusion. With you, I 
make no doubt, she appeared all that was 
amiable ; but that was in conformity to 
circumstances: you were a family of love, 
and she doubtless saw that if she appeared 
otherwise than kind and affectionate, she 
was not likely to obtain that notice or ad- 
miration so essential to her : but here the 
case is different; here she is perfectly 
aware, that to insure what she wishes, 
there's no necessity for feigning what she 
does not feel; and I shall therefore be 
much surprised if here you do not find 
her, making herself very easy about you." 

" Oh, I hope not !" cried Carolme, with 
starting tears ; " for how should I grieve to 
find a person I so loved " 

" Come, don't be too much affected at 
the thought, my dear little girl," cried her 
aunt, " for you must not expect, in travel- 
ling through life, to find all whom you 
love, or who have professed to regard you, 
love you in return : there are some dis- 
agreeable truths it is absolutely requisite 
to be acquainted with, on commencii/g our 
career, and this is one of them." 

" But at what an expence are we ren- 



CONTRAST. 155 

dered wiser!" observed Dorinda ; " it is 
almost sufficient to make one exclaim 
with " 

" Oh ! I anticipate," said the countess ; 
" but sentiment is not quite so much the 
fashion, my love, as it was, so we'll dispense 
with the quotation you were about giv- 
ing : instead of wailing and weeping over 
the little foibles and follies incidental to 
human nature, we now laugh at, and ridi- 
cule them, and that is assuredly the most 
amusing way of the two." 

The sisters sighed, and so did somebody 
else. Mountflorence wished that he could 
have doubted the assertions of his aunt 
respecting Helena; but he feared there 
was too much reason for them ; yet amidst 
all that was blamable, he would still be- 
lieve that there was a heart of feeling, and, 
of course, that education, more than na- 
ture, was in fault. 

But the countess had not yet exhausted 
her spleen against Helena â€” " And pray 
who was of the young lady's party at the 
theatre to-night?" 

" The varapyre, lady Lovel, and some 
of her set." 



156 CONTRAST. 

" What a horrid name to give herT' 
said Dorinda. 

" She derives it from fastening on all 
the single young women of fortune she 
can get acquainted with, to make up, by 
her hold of them, for the deficiencies of a 
rather narrow income." 

" She puts me in mind of the elephant 
in Exeter 'Change, as much as of any 
thing else," said his lordship's brother, An- 
gus Rosse ; " one tramp of her foot would 
annihilate one." 

" And any of the Bridgemores ?" 

" Yes, that creature the daughter, I be- 
lieve." 

" Frightful beings altogether," said her 
ladyship, with an affected shudder ; and 
she proceeded to say every thing that had 
a tendency to disparage Helena, through 
her grandmother's connexions, in the eyes 
of her young relatives, decidedly bent as 
she now was on eflfecting an estrangement 
between them. 

But lady Rossglen was not a person to 
be easily prejudiced against any person 
she regarded; she felt herself bound, by 
many considerations, to interest herself 



CONTRAST. 157 

about Helena; and instead of resenting 
what appeared a want of respect and affec- 
tion for her, made the girls call on her the 
next day, under the hope of some expla- 
nation ensuing, that might do away the 
impression made upon their minds by what 
had occurred. The Bridgemores, however, 
took care no interview should take place : 
conceiving it not unlikely that there would 
be an effort for it, they contrived to get 
Helena to occupy the inner drawing room, 
so that she knew nothing of her sisters' 
visit, to whom she was denied, in a manner 
quite calculated to induce a belief of her 
being within, as was indeed intended : still 
lady Rossglen would not suffer herself to 
be offended, and accordingly lost no time, 
on their return, ill as she was, in address- 
ing a letter to Helena, entreating to know 
the cause of her neither seeing or hearing 
from her, since their parting in Rathbone- 
place, as she fully expected would have 
been the case, from her note of the pre- 
ceding day. 

The servant who took this, was instruct- 
ed not to leave the house without an an- 
swer ; there was no use therefore in deny* 



158 CONTRAST. 

ing her, as the Bridgemores would other- 
wise have done ; to let her see this letter, 
however, which they contrived to examine, 
was out of the question, and, for a moment, 
they were at a loss how to act. It then 
occurred to Bridgemore to alter the date 
of the note, that had been kept back, and 
substitute it in its place. This being done. 
Miss Frances took it up to Helena ; and 
" A note," she carelessly said, " from Caven- 
dish-square ; probably an invitation to the 
brilliant party of to-day there, with an 
apology for the omission in not sending 
it sooner." 

Helena hastily opened the note ; as she 
read, her colour changed â€” " Why lady 
Rossglen is ill," she said, " so ill, as to be 
unable to leave her room, and has there- 
fore invited me to pass the day with her." 

" Therefore â€” how kind ! â€” rather than 
be left to herself; for this, of course, is to be 
considered an introductory party for the 
young ladies â€” she invites you to pass the 
day with her ; but takes care to do so in 
terms, that must let you see you are not 
to expect to form one of the party in the 
drawing-room." 



CONTRAST. 159 

Helena became agitated ; the idea of a 
slight being intended, was enough to rouse 
all that was indignant in her nature : and 
in what other light could she construe 
what had now occurred â€” her being in- 
vited to Cavendish. square, not out of 
compliment, but merely to, prevent lady 
Rossglen being left to herself? and she 
was turning to a writing-table, when Fran- 
ces, fearful if allowed to write, she might 
be too explicit, inquired, whether, having 
so many visits to pay that day, she did not 
think a verbal answer would do as well ? 

Helena hesitated ; there would be a want 
of respect in such a one to lady Rossglen ; 
but then, had she not lent herself to her 
malicious sister, to inflict a wound upon 
her feelings ? for, of course, her being ex- 
cluded from the party mentioned by Fran- 
ces, was a premeditated thing by lady An- 
stnither: and giving way to her angry 
feelings, she did what was artfully sug- 
gested. 

Lady Rossglen was astonished, on re- 
ceiving for answer to her affectionate let- 
ter, an apology for not writing through 
want of leisure : something must have 



160 CONTRAST. 

been taken amiss; and through this per- 
suasion, she decided on an attempt to see 
Helena the ensuing day : but the alarm- 
ing increase of her indisposition prevented 
this intention from being carried into ef- 
fect; and her family were naturally too 
much occupied by her to think of any 
thing else. 

Her illness was studiously concealed 
from Helena, the immediate intimates of 
the Bridgemores being all cautioned a- 
gainst touching on it; so that she was kept 
in complete ignorance of the circumstance, 
and in consequence, imputed her hearing- 
no more from Cavendish- square, to a de- 
termination to break with her, from being 
unable to assign it to any other cause; 
and accordingly, in order to prove to those 
who had treated her so unkindly, of what 
little consequence their conduct was to her, 
suffered herself more than ever to be seen 
in public. 

She was rather mortified at never meet- 
ing with any of them ; but still she trust- 
ed they would not remain in ignorance of 
her movements ; and of this indeed good 
care was taken ; and in consequence, in so 



CONTRAST. 161 

heartless a light did her conduct appear, 
that the girls hardly knew how they could 
ever forgive her. 

At length, one night she encountered 
Mountflorence at the opera ; and yielding 
to the impulse of the moment, the sudden 
pleasure that pervaded her feelings at the 
sight of a person so regarded, gave him a 
most gracious smile of recognition, the mo- 
ment she caught his eye; but what was 
the shock she sustained at the manner this 
was returned ! his cold, his distant air, and 
his almost mstantly after disappearing. 

While musing on the circumstance, the 
next day, in a drive by herself in the 
Park, she beheld the girls approaching in 
their aunt's barouche, with several atten- 
dant beaux on horseback. There was 
something in the protection afforded them 
by their aunt, and the manner in which 
they were attended, that formed a morti- 
fying contrast, at the moment, to the way 
in which Helena felt herself circumstanced; 
and united to the rankling resentment oc- 
casioned by the incident of the preceding 
evening, caused her to haughtily turn aside 
her head, at the very instant that her sis- 



162 CONTRAST. 

ters, unable to resist the feelings awakened 
by seeing her, were on the point of greet- 
ing her with smiles, spite of their aunt's 
looks to the contrary. 

No â€” she would henceforth shun them 
as studiously as they had shunned her â€” 
henceforth take every opportunity that 
occurred, for proving the regard they had 
so suddenly withdrawn, was of little im- 
portance to her : but what had she done 
to merit such unkindness? what, to be 
compelled to see, with all her advantages 
of wealth, that she was still an isolated 
being ? that, in losing her father, the only 
link that united them to her was broken? 
but she would address an expostulatory 
letter on the subject to lady Rossglen ; 
she would entreat â€” she would demand, as 
a right, to be acquainted with the cause 
of the conduct she had met with. Yet, 
no â€” why run the risk of subjecting her- 
self to some additional mortification by 
such a measure ? why allow the malicious 
countess the gratification of thinking she 
was hurt by what had taken place; for 
that she w^as instrumental to it she would 
not doubt â€” no, she would not allow such 



CONTRAST. 163 

a triumph at her expence â€” she would not 
permit it to be thought she so estimated 
what she had been so capriciously depri- 
ved of. Instead of nourishing humilia- 
ting regrets, she would force herself to 
exertions that would at once conceal, and 
enable her to overcome them : and in a 
degree, did she not merit what she had 
met with, for her readiness to give up the 
old and approved friends of her grand- 
mother, for those whose sincerity she had 
never put to the test ? and the reflection 
made her place greater confidence than ever 
in them, by way of atonement for her indi- 
rect ingratitude, so that every thing seem- 
ed to favour their designs. But to subdue 
a fond regard like hers â€” to detach her 
mind from the consideration of what so 
deeply affected it, could only be the work 
of time : still â€” still the thoughts of He- 
lena dwelt on her unkind relatives ; and 
notwithstanding her resolves concerning 
them, she never went into public without 
her eyes wandering, in hopes of encounter- 
ing them, and perhaps some smile of affec- 
tionate recognition, that might furnish her 
with a pretext for yielding to her real 



164 CONTRAST. 

feelings for them. But no â€” or if she did 
behold them, she in vain sought to catch 
their eyes â€” the young ladies, taken in 
hand by their aunt, having by this time 
acquired the art of avoiding looks they 
did not like to notice; and when they 
came seriously to reflect on the conduct of 
Helena, they certainly deemed her un- 
worthy of their regard. 

At length the period for allowing her 
to form an establishment for herself, ar- 
rived; a splendid mansion had previously 
been prepared, to which the Bridgemores 
removed with her â€” the sole management 
of her affairs being given up to Mr. 
Bridgemore. 

Nothing could exceed the taste and 
splendour of every thing connected with 
her establishment ; and from the style in 
which she at once launched out, the fre- 
quency and brilliancy of her parties, her 
name soon became one of celebrity in the 
fashionable world: but in the midst of ad- 
miration and adulation, of all that was cal- 
culated to charm and gratify a youthful 
mind, she still at times felt an aching void in 
her heart she vainly sought to fill up. The 



CONTRAST. 165 

Bridgemores were still the best creatures 
in existence, but they could not attach her 
as others had done ; the converse of kin- 
dred minds was, in short, essential to her 
full enjoyment, and this she now in vain 
sought for. She was not without a taste 
for display ; with her lively fancy, her ver- 
satile genius, her consciousness of superior 
endowments, and love of excitement, it 
would have been rather strange if she had. 
Yet a thousand times gladly would she 
have exchanged, if in her power, these 
brilliant scenes, where she shone so pre- 
eminent, for those romantic ones in which 
she had been first awakened to a knowledge 
of her own perceptions, and taught to va- 
lue them as they ought to be â€” those ra- 
tional and heart-satisfying pleasures that 
can never cloy ; but the heart knows its 
own bitterness, and carefully concealed 
within hers were the regrets that empoi- 
soned many a passing hour, and often 
caused her pillow to be bedewed with tears. 
Dissipation was sought, as a refuge or 
resource from thought, and in pursuit of 
it, her whole time now appeared occupied. 
There was no one at hand, no friend to 



166 CONTRAST. 

check her in her thoughtless career, by 
pointing out what it might ultimately lead 
to; on the contrary, it was the interest of 
those she had associated herself with, to 
encourage her in whatever had a tendency 
to injure her in public estimation, since 
the more she was detached from the so- 
ciety of the respectable, the more she was 
thrown into their power. 

With her numerous advantages, it may 
be supposed she did not want overtures 
for her hand ; but she could not be pre- 
vailed on to decide in favour of any one, 
to the no small joy of the Bridgemores. 
Among the admirers she ranked in her train 
was the Polish prince Zamoski ; he soon sin- 
gled her out as the finest woman he had yet 
seen ; and from the manner in which she 
received his attentions, it was concluded 
that he would not find her as inflexible 
as others had done. Whatever were the 
secret feelings of Helena, or she might 
have ultimately thought of deciding, for 
of the prince being serious in his atten- 
tions she had not the slightest doubt, she 
certainly did nothing to discourage this 
conclusion, so flattering to her pride and 



CONTRAST. 167 

vanity were the devoirs of a man of his 
rank and accomplishments. Mountflo- 
rence only surpassed him, in her opinion ; 
but, unlike Mountflorence, he was not 
more pleasing than dangerous â€” a character 
that cared not what misery or desolation 
he occasioned, where his fancy was allured. 

Mountflorence, who, whatever she 
thought to the contrary, was never unin- 
terested where she was concerned, was se- 
riously alarmed by the general report, 
acquainted as he was with the real charac- 
ter of the prince, from having heard of 
him abroad. Unable to control his strong 
anxiety about her, he at length decided 
on calling on Helena, to warn her of the 
precipice on which he conceived she stood. 
Her carriage was at the door at the time 
he called, but notwithstanding he sent up 
his name. 

" Major Mountflorence !" repeated He- 
lena, in a voice scarce audible through 
surprise, and involuntarily, through the 
tremour of her frame, resuming the seat 
from which she had started on hearing 
him announced. 

" I fear," said Mountflorence, as the ser- 



168 CONTRAST. 

vant retired, in that hurried voice so indi- 
cative of agitation, " that I have intruded 
at an inconvenient hour, your carriage 
being at the door ; but my motive must 
be my apology." 

" What that is, I of course cannot di- 
vine," said Helena ; " but be it what it 
may, no apology can be requisite. I must 
be particularly engaged indeed, when I 
can consider a visit from major Mountflo- 
rence in any other light than that of a 
pleasure." 

Mountflorence shook his head â€” " Ah, 
no !" he said, with a smile of increduHty, 
" the period for believing that is long since 
gone by." 

" Rather say," cried Helena, colouring 
with emotion, " that the period is long 
since passed, in which Miss Rossglen could 
imagine major Mountflorence would es- 
teem it a pleasure to pay one. But it 
matters not," she said, with a starting tear ; 
" it is not under this roof that I would or 
should upbraid." 

" If upbraidings or reproaches were to 
be resorted to, who would have the best 
right to make them ? but it is not for such 



CONTRAST. 169 

a purpose I have waited upon Miss Ross- 
glen ; it is for one which I may not per- 
haps be so fortunate as to succeed in â€” that 
of trying to convince her that the interest 
professed for her by those I believe she 
once considered in the light of friends, was 
not professed without being experienced : 
but I see you are impatient ; but what I 
have to say is of so unpleasant a nature, 
that 1 involuntarily hesitate." 

" You alarm me by all this prefacing," 
said Helena. " What would you say ?" 

" The prince Zamoski !" cried Mountflo- 
rence, and he paused in evident agitation. 

" Well, what of him ?" demanded He- 
lena. 

" He has the honour of being ranked 
amongst your admirers," resumed Mount- 
florence ; " and the envied honour, if pub- 
lic report be true, of being the one that is 
most distinguished by you." 

" You flatter me, by your mode of ex- 
pression," said Helena, in a tone of badi- 
nage ; " but supposing what you have 
stated to be correct â€” that he sighs for 
me, and I smile on him, what then ?" 

VOL. II. I 



170 CONTRAST. 

" Why, that he is unworthy of the ho- 
nour," replied Mountflorence, with forced 
calmness. 

" As how, pray ?" 

" By his not being at liberty to address 
any woman of honour ; he has long been 
a husband ! but either through pride, the 
lady he selected being of inferior rank to 
himself, or inconstancy, has chosen to 
conceal the circumstance : but you turn 
pale ! what am I to infer from this ? that 
he has indeed succeeded in making too 
great an interest for himself?" 

" No," replied Helena, a little recover- 
ing herself, for her pride had sustained a 
severe shock ; " you err : whatever the 
persevering attentions of the prince might 
have effected, surprise is now my predo- 
minant sensation, that any one could liave 
the temerity to single out a person in my 
rank of life, with any other than perfectly 
correct views." 

" Did he ever venture to make a di- 
rect overture for your hand ?" demanded 
Mountflorence. 

" No," replied Helena, colouring vio- 



CONTRAST. 171 

lently ; " he never offered me that in- 
sult, as an insult it must be esteemed, 
from what has now been disclosed." 

" 'Tis well," cried Mountflorence, a little 
recovering the calmness he had lost. 

" But is the circumstance you have 
communicated to me generally known ?" 
asked Helena, anxiously. 

" No, nor for worlds would I have it, 
from his particularities to you." 

Helena felt still further revived by 
this assurance. All was safe then â€” there 
would be no triumph at her expence â€” no 
exultation amongst the envious and ma- 
licious, at what they might have termed 
her disappointment. â€” " Well," she said, 
" I hope it is unnecessary to assure major 
Mountflorence, I shall ever retain a grate- 
ful sense of his interference on this occa- 
sion. I should be happy to have oppor- 
tunities of evincing this ; but I would not, 
by asking him to repeat his visit, subject 
him to the necessity of inventing excuses." 

Mountflorence looked reproachfully at 
her, and with eyes that seemed kindhng 
with indignant feelings, was about reply-

ing, when, just apprized of the visitor He- 
lena had received, and fearful a longer tHe- 
oAete might bring about explanations in- 
jurious to the plans in contemplation, in 
literally bounced Miss Frances, to say â€” 
" Madame La Rouge was below, with the 
French lace Miss Rossglen desired to see." 
" Ah, I perceive," said Mountflorence, 
directly rising, " I am an intruder ; but 
Miss Rossglen must blame herself for her 
visitors forgetting the lapse of time," and 
with a bow to the ladies, he took leave.

Helena could not immediately recover 
from the discomposure occasioned by the 



CONTRAST. 1 73 

abrupt departure of Mountflorence, or 
rather the intrusion that caused it, just at 
the very moment when he seemed on the 
point of entering into explanations, that 
might have soothed her lacerated feelings, 
by proving that what had wounded was not 
intended. At length, haughtily command- 
ing that madame La Rouge should never 
be admitted within her doors again, she 
descended to her carriage, without deign- 
ing to take any notice of Frances, and de- 
sired to be driven towards the country. 

The visit of IMountflorence had revived 
feelings she hoped had been overcome; 
-his looks, his manner, were a direct con- 
tradiction to the indifference manifested 
by his conduct. Hence the impertinence 
of which she accused Frances, for her in- 
trusion. Yet what explanation could he 
have given on the subject of what she 
complained, that could have proved satis- 
factory ?--or was any in reality intended ? 
Assuredly not; for had he not at once 
avowed the object of his visit â€” that there 
was no hidden, no secret motive for it, 
such as would require to be gradually 
elicited? and perhaps, had he chosen to 



174 CONTRAST. 

be explicit, she might have found that she 
was as much indebted for the interest 
evinced about her, on the present occasion, 
to the consideration of the injury it might 
be to her sisters, to have any reflection 
cast upon her, as to any other motive. 
Yes, there was but little doubt, from his 
preceding conduct, that this would have 
proved the case ; and at the idea, all her 
pride and resentment reviving, she deter- 
mined so to act, as to prevent the slightest 
suspicion of there being any wish on her 
part for a renewal of intercourse with 
him or his connexions. 

A few nights after this there was a su- 
perb ball at one of the foreign ambassadors, 
for which she had received a card : aware 
that the whole world of fashion would be 
there, she knew not how to decide about 
shunning the attentions of prince Za- 
moski, so gratifying to pride and vanity 
as would be his public homage in such an 
assembly : but should Mountflorence be 
present ? â€” and, undecided on the point, she 
entered the brilliant scene. Hardly had 
she made her appearance, ere she was join- 
ed by the prince, on the watch for her. 



CONTRAST. 175 

She hesitated ; but the looks she saw di- 
rected towards her settled the point ; and, 
accepting his arm, she suffered herself to 
resume her usual manner towards him, as 
they promenaded the splendid rooms to- 
gether; but prepared to draw away from 
him should she catch a glimpse of INIount- 
florence, whom, with all her anger, she 
could not bring herself to regard so as to 
render her careless of his opinion. The even- 
ing advanced, however, without her seeing 
him, and beginning at length to think 
there was no danger of this, she ceased to 
repose any further restraint over herselÂ£ 

The waltz, in which she had joined with 
the prince, was just over; and glowing 
with excited feelings, and panting and 
dizzy from the dance, she was repairing to 
a seat, leaning on the arm of her partner, 
when, in the circle that had formed round 
the dancers, she suddenly encountered the 
eyes of Mountflorence, regarding her with 
a look that made hers instantly decline ; 
and hardly conscious of what she was about, 
she took the seat to which she was led. 

"Ah ! I fear you are ill," said the prince, 
struck by her sudden silence and change

of colour; " suffer me to conduct you to 
a cooler place ;" and again taking her hand, 
he led her, unopposed, through a long 
suit of apartments, to a beautiful conser- 
vatory, now receiving its only light from 
the illuminations in the garden, to which 
it opened. Its twilight gloom, the fra- 
grance of the shrubs and flowers, together 
with the murmuring of a fountain, that 
played at its extremity, and the softened 
sound of music, from the distant apartment 
they had quitted, rendering it altogether a 
delightful retreat ; nor could Helena, a little 
recovered from the shock she had sustain- 
ed, forbear acknowledging this. 

" It is indeed a delightful place," said 
the prince, as he seated himself beside her, 
in a kind of alcove, formed by the bend- 
ing plants at either side, " and I am glad I^ 
was so fortunate as to recollect it; for 'tis 
in such a place love should breathe its 
effusions ; for if any thing can soften the 
cold heart of cautious reserve, 'tis surely 
tender twilight, and balmy fragrance, and 
the plaintive touches of sweet harmony." 

This was but a prelude to speeches of a 
still more impassioned description ; and^ 



CONTRAST. 177 

Helena soon had reason to reproach her- 
self for the thoughtlessness that had allow- 
ed him an opportunity for the utterance of 
these; but great as was her indignation, she 
feared giving way to it, lest of provoking 
a malice that might be productive of inju- 
rious consequences ; and accordingly, com- 
manding herself, merely testified her dis- 
pleasure by an effort to immediately quit 
the place ; but in vain, and she was on the 
point of insisting on being released, when 
a shght rustling amidst the shrubs made 
her turn, and she beheld Mountflorence ! 

Her confusion was indescribable â€” so 
great as to occasion the momentary sus- 
pension of the struggle she was making to 
free her hand ; and Mountflorence had 
nearly disappeared, when shocked by the 
construction that might be put upon his 
leaving her thus circumstanced, the irre- 
parable injury it might do her in his esti- 
mation, she called after him. He instantly 
returned, andâ€”" What commands has 
Miss Rossglen to honour me with?" he 
gravely asked. 

" I don't know â€” that is, I want to quit 
this," replied Helena, almost robbed of

178 CONTRAST. 

all self-possession by what had occurred ; 
" and so I should be glad you would have 
ray carriage inquired for." 

"No, no," hastily interposed the prince; 
" an honour I lay claim to, I cannot per- 
mit to be transferred to another." 

Mountflorence, smiling superciliously, 
was turning away to obey Helena, when 
still more passionately â€” " I insist, major 
Mountflorence " exclaimed the prince. 

Helena became alarmed. To what mis- 
chief might not her terrible imprudence 
lead? â€” what should she do? She saw 
but one way of avoiding or preventing 
what she dreaded. Accordingly, saying 
she had changed her mind â€” or rather, that 
ere she departed, she must return to the 
ball-room, to speak to her chaperon, lady 
Lovel, she forcibly wrested her hand from 
the prince, and taking Mountflorence by 
the arm, hurried away. 

Near the ball-room she paused; she 
wished to speak, to offer some apology for 
what she feared had excited so much cen- 
sure ; but the gravity of her companion ren- 
dered her at a loss how to begin. To what 
was his silence owing ? was it owing to a 



CONTRAST. 179 

persuasion that she could make no excuse 
for her conduct ? or to a total unconcern 
on the subject? either idea was equally 
painful, and she grew extremely agitated : 
again she went on â€” again she paused; 
how could she endure to part from him, 
without trying, in some degree, to vindi- 
cate herself in his opinion ? She glanced 
towards the ball-room, then at him, and 
then she fanned herself; and â€” " I almost 
wish," she said, " I had not come here to- 
night, the crowd is so great." 

Mountflorence smiled, but it was rather 
in the way in which he had smiled in the 
conservatory. â€” " Indeed !" he replied ; 
" why, I thought a crowd constituted 
quite the delight and pleasure of such an 
entertainment." 

" Why, certainly â€” thin rooms are very 
deplorable ; but then, when the crowd is 
so very overpowering as here â€” I really 
believe, if I had not sought a cooler at- 
mosphere But, no," she internally ex- 
claimed, wrought again to sudden indig- 
nation by the imperturbable gravity with 
which he stood listening to her, " I will 
not attempt any excuse for what he evi- 



180 CONTRAST. 

dently does not care about â€” I will not 
degrade mvself, bv enterincr into an ex- 
planation that could not fail of being con- 
strued into a consciousness of error !" and 
she was hastening to the ball-room, when 
encountering one of the attendants, she 
again changed her mind, and desiring her 
carriage to be called, repaired to an anti- 
room, to wait its announcement. She did 
not at first allow herself to appear con- 
scious of Mountflorence having followed 
her. When, at length, she condescended, 
she begged she might not be the means of 
any longer detaining him from the ball- 
room. 

He coldly replied, by saying, the party" 
he expected to meet were not yet come. 

What party? But, doubtless, one in 
which lady Bellair was included ; and the 
idea renewing all her agitation, or rather, 
resentful feelings, she finally parted from 
him, in a way but little calculated to do 
away any injurious impression that had 
been made upon his mind; and with a de- 
termination to trouble herself no more 
about his opinion, from a conviction of no 
real anxiety being experienced about her. 



^ONTRAW. 181 

While she was thus, as it seemed, vo- 
luntarily incurring additional cause for 
self-blame and unhappiness, Adelaide was 
endeavouring to bear, with calmness, the 
idea of what she had been subjected to bv 
others; she was aided, in this effort, bv 
her inability to discover any new cause for 
alarm or distrust, and, but rbr the secret 
warning she had received, would probably 
have been confirmed in her previous per- 
suasion of Mrs. Westford beinc^ in too 
much awe of her friends to think of plan- 
ning any scheme against her. 

She still continued to pass most of her 
time in the society of the Madocs; and 
from the relief this afforded her. she had 
reason to congratulate herself on the in- 
troduction, and permitted intimacy ; but 
while she relied on their interference, 
should it be required, she still shrunk from 
unnecessarily reposing confidence : and ac- 
cordingly remained without any means of 
making an effort to discover who the 
mysterious female was. The incident con- 
nected with her was so extremely roman- 
tic, that, at times, almost she could have 
fancied it a dream ; but noÂ» her imagina- 



182 CONTRAST. 

tion had not deceived her â€” she was not 
dreaming at the time it occurred. If 
Mrs. Westford, however, did meditate 
any thing against her, it certainly was 
some scheme she was most cautious and 
wary about carrying into effect, so much 
time had elapsed, since her being thrown 
into her power, without any intimation, 
or rather, detection, of any thing that 
could create additional apprehension; for 
the glow of summer had now given place 
to the mellow tints of autumn, or, in po- 
etical language, it was now the time when 



-the leaf 



Incessant rustles from the mournful grove, 
Oft startling such as, studious, walk below. 
And slowly circles through the waving air." 

But the pale descending year was pleasing 
still ; and neither the walks in which Ade- 
laide delighted, nor yet the custom of 
reading in an old-fashioned summer-house 
belonging to Mr. Madoc, in a solitary part 
of his grounds, was relinquished. 

Absorbed in listening to a work of deep 
interest, that Mr. Madoc had selected to 
read to her one morning in this romantic 
retreat, she heeded not that Miss Madoc 



CONTRAST. 183 

had stolen away from them, neither, from 
the feelings excited by the story, in which 
she found something applicable to herself, 
that Mr. Madoc had taken her hand, till 
roused from her abstraction by a slight 
rustling near the entrance, when looking 
up, with a degree of surprise that render- 
ed her almost incredulous of what she saw, 
she beheld lord Le Poer, accompanied by 
Mrs. Westford, earnestly regarding her. 

She started up in joyful ecstacy, for 
what was she to infer from this, but that 
justice was, at length, done her â€” that the 
stigma under which she laboured was re- 
moved, and he had come to restore her, 
in person, to all she had undeservedly 
been deprived of: but the belief was but 
momentary â€” his unrelaxing features, his 
chilling look on her springing towards him, 
quickly dissipated it, and convinced her, 
that, let the cause that had brought him 
there be what it might, it was not any 
change of sentiments towards her. 

Stepping before him into the summer- 
house â€” " This is the gentleman, my lord," 
said Mrs. Westford, pointing to Mr. Madoc. 

" The gentleman ! what a curious way 



lS4i CONTRAST. 

of expressing herself!" thought Adelaide, 
a little recovered from the shock inflicted 
by her father ; " as if there had been some 
previous communication respecting him, 
vi^hich, of course, is not to be supposed, 
for what could she have to say about Mr. 
Madoc to his lordship ?" 

Still she was musing on the subject, 
when Mrs. Westford, turning out of the 
summer-house with lord Le Poer, after 
having told Mr. Madoc she should expect 
to see him and his sister early at the castle, 
roused her from her meditative attitude, 
by her being desired to follow. 

The party proceeded in silence, or at 
least, if lord Le Poer and his companion 
held any conversation, it was in so low a 
tone, as to render it out of the power of 
the person who followed to distinguish any 
thing. 

Utterly at a loss how she was to con- 
duct herself, whether she should pass on 
to her chamber, or venture to follow into 
the apartment where her father was shewn, 
Adelaide was standing in the hall, when 
she was suddenly called into the parlour 
by Mrs. Westford.â€”" Well, Miss Mount- 



CONTRAST. 185 

florence," she said, but not without some 
slight indication of emotion, as Adelaide 
timidly advanced into the room, " I am 
happy to find myself at liberty to commu- 
nicate what I know must be agreeable to 
you, to tell you, that the letter addressed 
to his lordship in your behalf, he has been 
graciously pleased to attend to." 

Adelaide clasped her hands in joyful 
surprise. Could it be, that such a one had 
been written ! could it be, that she was in- 
deed indebted to this detested woman for 
any thing demanding gratitude ! 

" Yes," resumed Mrs. Westford, but 
still with a slight indication of agitation, 
and rather averting her looks from the 
keenly inquiring ones of Adelaide ; " the 
letter I wrote, as in duty bound, on the 
subject of Mr. Madoc's particularity to 
you, and the pleasure you seemed to de- 
rive from it." 

Adelaide started. â€” " On the subject of 
Mr. Madoc's particularity !" she exclaimed, 
in a tone of agitation and astonishment ; 
" there must be some mistake in this ; I 
know of no particularity that needed to 
be made the subject of a letter; his atten- 



186 CONTRAST. 

tions have been kind and persevering, but 
still such as he might have paid to any 
one ; and if I experienced pleasure from 
them, it was because they were not im- 
properly interpreted; and I derived a hope 
and confidence from them I needed here." 

" Then you deny what I have stated to 
his lordship ?" 

" Assuredly ; I deny your having any 
grounds for such a letter as you say you 
addressed to him." 

" Monstrous !" exclaimed Mrs. West- 
ford; and " Monstrous !" repeated lord Le 
Poer; then, with one of his withering 
frowns â€” " What, after what I witnessed 
myself?" he demanded â€” " after finding 
you secluded, embowered with this gen- 
tleman, your hand passively resting in his, 
your ear inclined to him â€” am I to under- 
stand that you mean to deny what this 
lady has asserted ? but the attempt or in- 
tention argues not less folly than effron- 
tery; for how could it be supposed I 
would discredit my own senses, even if I 
could have been induced to believe she 
would have ventured to advance that 
which she could not support ?" 



CONTRAST. 187 

Adelaide sighed, and for a moment 
veiled her eyes with her hand. Again she 
saw she was involved in a labyrinth, from 
which she did not know how to extricate 
herself: and was it for the insidious pur- 
pose of entangling her in such a one, that 
the intimacy with the Madocs had been 
encouraged ? and had they lent them.selves 
to the promotion of Mrs. Westford's pro- 
ject ? but doubtless they had ; for without 
the connivance of Mr. Madoc, it was not 
to be imagined such a statement as that 
mentioned would have been made; and a 
sickening sensation came over Adelaide, at 
the thought of having been so cruelly de- 
ceived and imposed on, where, in the simpli- 
city of a youthful and innocent heart, she 
believed she might have reposed confi- 
dence. 

" But think not," cried his lordship, 
" that I shall suffer myself to be so fooled 
â€” that after the trouble incurred in inqui- 
ring into the pretensions of this gentle- 
man, on the hint of your being disposed 
to favour his addresses, provided they ob- 
tained my sanction, I shall allow you to 
act in the way you now seem disposed, at 



188 CONTRAST. 

least without evincing my sense of such 
conduct. You either avail yourself of the 
opportunity that has been so unexpectedly 
afforded for restoring you, with some de- 
gree of credit, to society, or you doom your- 
self to be henceforth a stranger to all that 
has hitherto been a source of gratification 
to you." 

" Pray allow me to interfere, my lord," 
said Mrs. Westford ; " I dare say the young 
lady will yet recollect herself" 

" Let her retire, till she does so," said 
lord Le Poer. 

Adelaide obeyed this indirect command, 
by immediately withdrawing; but her 
ti'embling limbs would not carry her far ; 
she turned into the first room she came to, 
and burst into tears. Prejudiced as was 
every one against her, of what avail, she 
saw, would be any representation she could 
make? and with dismay, she contem- 
plated the still further sufferings to which 
she might be subjected, by her resistance 
to the measure now proposed â€” a measure 
doubtless suggested by the knowledge of 
the prejudice just alluded to. 

While dwelling with dismay on these, 



CONTEASr. 189 

Miss Madoc suddenly joined her â€” " Par- 
don me," she said, on seeing Adelaide half 
turn away on her entrance, '* if I intrude; 
but my anxiety to be out of suspense, on 
a subject most interesting, would not per- 
mit me to delay seeking you. Tell me 
that you are not going to be inexorable â€” 
that you are not going to disappoint hopes 
you permitted." 

" If inclined to be vain," said Adelaide, 
calmly, but with an evident indication of 
the change her sentiments for the lady 
had undergone, " it certainly would not 
be of the opinion entertained here of my 
understanding or discernment. What a 
creature must I be considered, to allow it 
to be supposed I could be betrayed into 
what I had not the remotest idea of, merely 
through assertions for which there was no 
foundation !" 

" No foundation !" repeated Miss Ma- 
doc, confused, yet resentfully ; ** then you 
attempt to deny having permitted the at- 
tentions of my brother ?" 

" No," cried Adelaide, '* I attempt no 
such thing ; I deny not having permitted 
his attentions, neither having received 



190 CONTRAST. 

pleasure from them, but solely from con- 
ceiving there was nothing more meant by 
them than I could approve. Had I once 
put that construction upon them which 
you would insinuate, you would have 
found ere now what my real sentiments 
were." 

" Then you doom him to despair â€” to 
death, perhaps !" exclaimed Miss Madoc. 

Adelaide smiled a little derisively â€” 
" No great danger of that," she said ; " as 
you assert you have read, I need not re- 
mind you who the poet is, who says, 

* Men have died from time to time. 

And worms have eaten them, but not for love !" 

" This is a cruel way of treating a pas- 
sion, that I must persist in alleging you 
encouraged," said Miss Madoc, " by the 
manner in which you received the atten- 
tions that were meant to intimate it, and 
which it was impossible to misunderstand ; 
and in making the observation, I must 
take leave to add, that Mr. JMadoc is not 
unworthy of the honour to which he as- 
pires, both from his birth, his accomplish- 
ments " 



CONTRAST. " 191 

" And nice sense of honour," added Ade- 
laide, " that would make him instinctively 
shrink from any thing like evasion or 
connivance with the base. But to bring 
the matter to a short issue, and prevent 
any further waste of your eloquence, per- 
mit me, in my turn, to observe, that as 
your brother has not the slightest chance 
of success with me, he had better turn his 
thoughts, where his extraordinary merits 
may be appreciated in a way pleasing to 
him." 

" Ridicule is not requisite to add to 
your ungenerous conduct, ma'am. But he 
is here to plead for himself," said Miss 
Madoc, dra'.ving back, as she spoke, to 
make way for her brother, who entered at 
the instant ; " for after what has occurred, 
I certainly shall interfere no more about 
him." 

The gentleman, with what he intended 
to be an impassioned air, threw himself at 
the feet of the inexorable fair, where all 
that self-interest could suggest to incline 
her to regard him was urged. Adelaide 
made no effort to raise him from his kneel- 
ing attitude, nor yet to interrupt him; 



192 CONTRAST* 

when, however, after several pauses, ac- 
companied by appealing looks, he peremp- 
torily demanded her reply, she coldly told 
him, her sentiments being revealed to his 
sister, he must excuse her taking any fur- 
ther trouble to explain them ; and passing 
him as she spoke, vanished from the room 
ere he could make an effort to prevent her. 

Driven almost to desperation by the 
predicament in which she found herself, 
hardly had she regained her own, ere she 
began to consider whether there might 
not be a possibility of her effecting her es- 
cape ; but alas ! she beheld none ; for even 
supposing she could quit the castle unob- 
served, still she was ignorant of the exact 
part of Wales she was in ; for of having 
been deceived by Madoc with respect to 
this, she had not the slightest doubt ; and 
from the inquiries she must consequently 
make, ere she attempted to go beyond 
its vicinity, could hardly fail of being be- 
trayed back again into the power of those 
she had such reason to fly from. 

While deliberating on her situation, a 
letter was delivered her from lord Le Poer, 
signifying that he gave her until the next 



CONTRAST. 193 

day to decide on the proposal that had 
been made, when, should she persist in 
still refusing to avail herself of the oppor- 
tunity it afforded for retrieving the past, in 
some degree, as already observed, it was 
his determination to give her up entirely, 
and avail himself of Mrs. Westford's know- 
ledge of one or two monastic seclusions 
abroad, to send her there. 

At this alarming intimation of being 
thrown still more into the power of this 
unprincipled woman than she already was, 
Adelaide was on the point of flying to her 
father, when the reflection of the useless- 
ness of any attempt to move him, without 
the power of entering into an explanation 
on the subject of what had offended, checked 
the impulse. Yet would she be allow^ed to 
become a victim to what she conceived a 
sense of duty ? would she be given up to 
perpetual misery, for having acted as prin- 
ciple enjoined ? No, she could notâ€”would 
not allow herself to imagine such a thing ; 
and still, as her sad heart sunk within her, it 
became revived by cheering hope and con- 
fidence in Heaven.

How much did she now wish she could 
see her unknown friend again, in order to 
learn whether she would add to the grati- 
tude already inspired, by forwarding a let- 
ter for her ! for to suppose the one intrust- 
ed to Madoc was sent, was, of course, out 
of the question. Under the hope that 
she might perhaps afford her the opportu- 
nity thus earnestly desired, she took her 
station at her window, as soon as it grew 
dark, or rather, she had reason to believe 
the inmates of the castle retired to repose; 
but hardly had she raised the sash, when 
the rain she perceived falling made her 
almost relinquish the faint hope she had 
been indulging : yet a person benevolently 
inclined would not, she reflected, be easily 
deterred from seeking an opportunity 
to do good; and surely if the stranger 
knew exactly how she was circumstanced 
at the moment, she must know the ser- 
vices of a friend were indeed requisite: and 
she accordingly remained stationary till 
the advance of the night compelled her to 
give up all further expectation of what 
she wished. As she turned from the win- 
dow, she fancied she saw a figure, near the 



CONTRAST. 195 

foot of the bed, just where she had before 
imagined a similar thing. A slight shivering 
came over her ; but endeavouring to com- 
mand herself, " In the name of Heaven !" 
she exclaimed, " do I behold any one ?*' 

*â€¢' Don't be alarmed," was the reply, in a 
voice that she instantly recognised for that 
of the stranger ; " you behold a friend." 

" Yes, of that I am aware," said Ade- 
laide, " now that I know who it is I see; 
what has previously occurred, leaves no 
room for doubt on the subject : but how, 
may I ask," she demanded, with increasing 
surprise, on finding the chamber door still 
locked, " did you find means of entering ?" 

" No matter ; time will not admit of un- 
necessary explanations; be satisfied with 
knowing, that whatever are my means of 
secret access to your apartment, they will 
never be used for any purpose that can be 
injurious to you. I have already intimated 
the interest you inspired â€” that interest 
which innocence must ever create in a heart 
not devoid of feeling. But various motives 
induced me to hope, I need not be more ex- 
plicit with you than I had been â€” that the 
k2

partial warning given might prove suffi- 
cient to put you on your guard against any 
evil that might be meditated without my 
further interference : what has recently oc- 
curred, however, inducing a contrary appre- 
hension, I have again sought to speak to 
you, for the purpose of urging you to be 
firm in vour resistance, to all that can be 
urged in behalf of the person now aspiring 
to your hand â€” the base, the perjured, the 
unfeeling Madoc, at this instant the hus- 
band of another." 

" Good Heavens ! and Mrs. Westford â€” 
is she aware of this? But need I ask, 
knowing, as I already do, what she is cap- 
able of?" 

" Yes, she is in league with him, or ra- 
ther he with her, for she was the suggester 
of this scheme. He is nearly related to 
her ; and on her offer to receive you under 
her protection being accepted, she wrote 
to apprize him of the circumstance ; and 
that it might be turned to his advantage, 
provided he bound himself to recompense 
her for any exertions she made to serve 
him. This he readily did; and all mat- 
ters being arranged between them, this

castle, belonging to a half-brother of his, 
residing on the Continent, to whom he is 
agent, was provided for your reception; 
while he and his sister, a ready accomplice 
in the scheme against you, removed to a 
lone farm-house. But to make you better 
understand his villany, or rather the cir- 
cumstances that have rendered him suffi- 
ciently desperate to run the present risk, 
a few particulars may be requisite : know 
then, that I am the mother of his victim, 
for so may his unfortunate wife be justly 
termed. Mr. Mowbray, the father of my 
husband, was a merchant : at the period 
of our marriage, he ranked amongst the 
wealthiest of the citizens of London ; but 
shortly after this event, his house sustained 
a shock, that, considerably injuring his cre- 
dit, produced a material alteration in his 
circumstances. Impressed with the un- 
certainty of mercantile transactions, he 
determined that what remained of his pro- 
perty should not be entirely risked; and 
accordingly, at his decease, left it equally 
between his son and granddaughter â€” as it 
proved, a provident disposition of it ; for 
my husband, still more adventurous, be- 



198 CONTRAST. 

came still more unfortunate, and ultimately 
died in such circumstances, as to leave me 
solely dependant on my daughter; but this 
her filial tenderness, her devoted attach- 
ment to me, left me no reason to regret. 
Whatever were my own feelings, I con- 
quered them, for the purpose of affording 
her those opportunities for mixing in life 
that were desirable. In a visit to Chel- 
tenham, we became acquainted with Ma- 
doc. I need not tell you that his manners 
are specious ; he soon became particular to 
my daughter, and perceiving his atten- 
tions were not unpleasing, I deemed it 
my duty to make inquiries. Nothing, 
however, transpired to his prejudice, and 
I accordingly made no objection to the 
desired union; but hardly had it taken 
place â€” hardly had I resigned myself to the 
soothing belief of all my worldly anxiety 
being at an end, by a fond and generous 
protector being secured to my child, when 
I was compelled to endure yet greater sor- 
row than I had previously experienced, by 
finding Madoc any thing but what he 
had previously appeared â€” those mild and 
amiable manners, that delicacy of taste. 



CONTRAST. 199 

these refined sentiments, that had so cap- 
tivated my unhappy daughter and self, 
but assumed for the purpose of deceiving 
both ; and that, all lovely as she was, her 
fortune constituted her sole attraction in 
his eyes. To possess himself of this, he 
shortly began to exercise the authority of 
a husband; for it was so settled, that no 
receipt but hers would be taken for her 
yearly income; and I had besides a rever- 
sionary claim to some part of the property. 
My daughter's affection for me was too 
great to allow her for a moment to think 
of persuading me to give up this; and I 
too clearly saw what she was liable to, 
from the dissipated propensities of her 
husband, to suffer myself to think of its 
relinquishment. The opposition to his 
wishes provoked conduct that at length 
obliged me to leave his house â€” need I say 
with what reluctance, obliging me, as it 
did, to leave my child entirely at the mercy 
of a barbarian : but^ this was not my sole, 
though my heaviest affliction; in conse- 
quence of this step, I was deprived of all 
certain means of support, Mr. Madoc still 
accompanying her when she went to re- 



200 CONTRAST. 

ceive her income, so that she had nothing 
left in her power. 

" At length, after two years of un- 
ceasing wretchedness, my unhappy child, 
driven to despair and desperation, by our 
separation, fled her home, and taking re- 
fuge with me, implored my secreting my- 
self with her. To sanction her quitting a 
husband so every way unworthy of her, I 
could not conceive blamable, more espe- 
cially, convinced as I was, that a longer 
continuance with him must be at the ex- 
pence of her life. Previous to her mar- 
riage I knew this place, and from the know- 
ledge I had obtained of it, was sure that 
nowhere could one be found more adapted 
for the purposes of concealment; and 
hither accordingly, even at the risk of her 
husband being sometimes here, I repaired 
with her. It is now upwards of a year 
since her leaving him, during which period, 
till the last few weeks, he has been inde- 
fatigable in searching after her; when, 
despairing of discovering her, and involved 
in difficulties he saw no means of extri- 
cÂ»Ujng himself from, he w^as on the point 



CONTRAST. 201 

of embarking for the Continent, when a 
letter arrived fronn his friend and relative, 
Mrs. Westford, apprizing him of her plan 
respecting you, suggested by its not being 
generally known he was a married man, 
and the assurance that lord Le Poer would 
be happy to give a handsome portion with 
you to any one of respectability : what fol- 
lowed renders it needless for me to state 
how readily this plan was embraced. How 
I became acquainted with it, or the many 
secret meetings and private consultations 
it subsequently occasioned, giving me a 
perfect insight into what was intended, 
matters not to say ; suffice it, as I have 
already observed, an interest was created 
for you by what I thus obtained a know- 
ledge of, that determined me to run all 
risks, rather than allow you to become 
the victim of united perfidy." 

" To express what I feel for your con- 
duct is impossible," said Adelaide ; " that 
your generous warning was superfluous, 
does not lessen the gratitude it merits ; 
for with all his specious graces, never, for a 
moment, did I experience a sentiment for 
K 3 



202 CONTRAST. 

this now-detested man, that could have 
induced me to listen to his overtures." 

" Of that too I was aware," said Mrs. 
Mowbray ; " but still I knew not what 
persuasions, or intimidating threats, might 
effect; and through the apprehension it 
was that I at length prevailed on myself 
to run a risk I need not explain ; for to 
be betrayed to her cruel husband must be 
a deathblow to my unhappy daughter, from 
the state she is in : unceasing anxiety, like 
a worm in the bud, having destroyed the 
vital springs of life ; and, like a tender flow- 
er, untimely nipped by desolating winds, I 
behold her, gradually languishing away, 
with feelings that render me incapable of 
any consolation but what is derived from 
the reflection, that, when I die myself, I 
shall not have to grieve at the thought of 
leaving her behind me, without a friendly 
bosom to repose her languid head on â€” a 
pitying heart to shed a tear of sympathy 
over her." The unhappy mother became 
convulsed with grief " Yet, to behold 
our last earthly tie severed from us, what 
fortitude does it not require ! But, as a 



CONTRAST. 203 

poet has observed â€” ' To what mysterious 
woes are mortals born !" 

" Alas, too true !" said the sympathizing 
Adelaide; " I am not myself new to sor- 
row ; and Heaven only knows what may 
yet be in store for me! Yet I should 
not be so apprehensive, could I but get a 
letter forwarded for me." 

" A letter has been forwarded for you," 
replied Mrs. Mowbray. 

Adelaide started. â€” " What," with joy- 
ful eagerness she demanded, " in one in- 
stance then did this unprincipled man 
prove himself sincere ?" 

*^No; the letter you entrusted to Ma- 
doc he destroyed ; but you wrote another, 
w^iich you fancied you mislaid ; that letter 
I found here, and perceiving the import- 
ance of having it despatched, I myself 
added the address you were ignorant of, 
and sent it." 

Adelaide mused â€” " Then it was not to 
ignorance of her situation â€” the unhappy 
predicament in which she was placed, that 
no effort had yet been made for her extri- 
cation from it; yet, was it possible that 
it could be known, without some attempt 



204 CONTRAST. 

of the kind ?" And it struck her, that 
the letter Mrs. Mowbray had benevolently 
interested herself about, had, through some 
unlucky mischance, never reached its des- 
tination. 

Yielding to this idea, it appeared to her 
as if there was nothing for her, driven to 
the extremity she was, but to endeavour 
to effect her escape; and she accordingly 
decided on imploring the aid of Mrs. 
INIowbray. All this time the rain had 
been increasing, and the sky had become 
still blacker and blacker, till, at length, 
such a pitchy darkness prevailed, as to 
render Adelaide and her new friend com- 
pletely invisible to each other, except 
when a momentary flash of lightning il- 
lumined the apartment, disclosing to the 
former the ghastly features of a tall sepul- 
chral figure, earnestly regarding her. 

She was on the point of disclosing her 
wish, and entreating the assistance requi- 
site for its accomplishment, when there 
came a clap of thunder, that, for a few 
minutes, robbed her of the power of utter- 
ance, from the sensation of terror it ex- 



CONTRAST. 205 

cited, seeming, as it did, to shake the an- 
cient pile over which it burst, with a tre- 
mendous crash, to its very foundation, 
as it rolled onward to the mountains, where 
it was reverberated through all their depths 
and cavities, in a manner the most awful 
and appalling. 

On the dreadful uproar ceasing, that 
seemed, to her affrighted imagination, in- 
volving heaven and earth, she proceeded 
to explain what she conceived herself 
driven to; concluding by beseeching a 
little further proof of that kind interest 
that had already been evinced about her. 
To this urgent entreaty, there was no re- 
ply. She repeated it ; but still all was si- 
lence. She now became dreadfully alarm- 
ed. Had terror stupified the faculties of 
her nocturnal visitant, or had the light- 
ning struck her? While trembling at 
the thought of either being the case, from 
the consideration of the afflicting conse- 
quences that might or must be the result 
to the unhappy being depending on her 
for succour and concealment, a sudden 
flash of lightning again illuminating the 
chamber, revealed to her that she was gone 



206 CONTRAST. 

â€” that advantage had been taken of the re- 
cent concussion to withdraw unperceived. 
She could not call it fear, yet it was cer- 
tainly something very like it, that Adelaide 
experienced at this discovery, unable as 
she was, from her own examination of the 
chamber, to conceive how access had been 
gained to it; but the next day would cer- 
tainly enable her to ascertain ; and she sat 
impatiently watching for returning light, 
unable, from the agitation of her spirits, 
and the confusion of her thoughts, to 
think of retiring to repose; and besides 
feeling an unpleasant sensation at the idea 
of doing so, from not knowing the moment 
she might be startled by hearing some 
one again in the apartment. 

While anxiously looking for the break 
of day, her mind was employed in ac- 
counting for the way in which Mrs. Mow- 
bray had become acquainted with the ne- 
farious scheme devised against her. Ade- 
laide had heard of the walls of the castle 
being hollow, and she made no doubt 
that it was through being able to profit by 
this circumstance, that Mrs. Mowbray had 



CONTRAST. 207 

obtained that knowledge that had ren- 
dered her so anxious about her. 



CHAP. IX. 



" I see that all are wanderers â€” gone astray, 
Each in his own delusion; they are lost 
On chance of fancied happiness, still woo'd 
And never won." 



Day at length dawned, but only to renew 
alarms; and when she thought of all she 
might have to encounter in the course of 
it, her heart sunk within her; and in- 
voluntarily yielding to the dismaying 
thought, she set about examining her 
chamber again, that, in case of the worst, 
she might be saved from despair, by 
knowing there was a way of escape; but 
in vain she searched for what she was so 
solicitous to discover ; and almost from the 
circumstance, she could have persuaded 
herself that all that had recently occurred 
was but an idle dream. 

Breakfast was brought her by one of 



208 CONTRAST. 

the Welsh servants. Hardly was it over, 
when she was summoned to lord Le Poer, 
determined on bringing matters to an issue 
with her that day, by either compelling 
her to accept the proposal of JSladoc, or 
else giving her up entirely to the care of 
Mrs. Westford, whose specious manners 
had gained much upon him, and of whom 
he entertained a very high opinion, from 
her introduction through Mr. Courtney. 

Adelaide tried to nerve her mind for 
the scene she anticipated, but her first 
glance at the dark and stern brow of lord 
Le Poer, nearly deprived her of the cou- 
rage she had endeavoured to summon. 

He delayed not inquiring what she had 
made up her mind to, whether to acqui- 
esce in his expressed wish, or by again 
disappointing and braving him, incurring 
his lasting displeasure ? 

Adelaide meekly and sorrowfully ex- 
pressed her deep regret at having ever ap- 
peared other than she really w^as, dutiful 
and affectionate ; and to prove which, she 
protested there was nothing in her power 
to do she would not cheerfully. 

" Then I am to infer, that there is no 



CONTRAST. 209 

longer any hesitation about accepting the 
proposal of Mr. Madoc ? that you at 
length see how fortunate you are, in the 
opportunity it affords of retrieving, in 
some degree, the past ?'* 

" Any thing in my power to evince the 
sincerity of my professions, I said I would 
readily do," was the reply ; " but to accept 
the proposal in question is not." 

" Then it is as this lady has intimated !" 
exclaimed his lordship, with eyes kindling 
wdth rage ; " you have had some communi- 
cation with that miscreant, who has already 
occasioned so much misery and bitter re- 
gret, at my ever having, in any way, ac- 
knowledged you ; and to him you are 
ready to sacrifice an honourable admirer ! 
and thus all hope of being restored to any 
thing like respectability in the eyes of the 
world !" 

" I have had no communication with 
any one since I came here, that I need 
blush to acknowledge," said Adelaide, 
firmly ; " in this one instance, at least, 
Mrs. Westford was too faithful to the trust 
reposed in her, to have permitted any 
thing of the kind, had it been wished : 



210 CONTRAST. 

but I am not, my lord, what she, or un- 
happy circumstances, may have made me 
appear; and I indulge a hope that you 
will yet be convinced of this : in the mean 
time, let me solemnly assure you, that had 
I known what the object was, in promo- 
ting an acquaintance with Mr. Madoc, I 
should, at once, have shrunk from his at- 
tentions â€” attentions, it is well and happy 
for me, I never thought of in any serious 
light, utterly unworthy as I now know 
him to be." 

Lord Le Poer rose, and stormed about 
the room. â€” " Grant me patience !" he ex- 
claimed ; " and this you assert â€” assert to 
me, after the proof I had but yesterday, 
of your regarding him in a very different 
light, or else of caring very little in reality 
what he was, as long as his attentions 
pleased. But to convince you what I 
think of your veracity, and how abor- 
tive any further attempt will be to make 
me change my determination, prepare in- 
stantly to act as I wish, or to hear me 
swear from this instant to renounce you !" 

" Have pity on me !" said Adelaide ; 
^*on my knees I implore it!" throwing 



CONTRAST. 211 

herself at his feet ; "in every thing that is 
possible, willingly, I repeat, I would bend 
â€” I will bend, to your authority ; but here 
it is not so ! even if I could prevail on my- 
self to accept the hand of a person to whom 
I am indifferent, there is here no hand to 

offer, for " she paused â€” she hesitated â€” 

then with a burst of indignation she could 
not suppress â€” " Mr. Madoc is already the 
husband of another!" 

Lord Le Poer started back, as if elec- 
trified, and as if he thought it hardly 
possible she could have had the temerity 
to advance such an assertion, without some 
foundation for it, turned to Mrs. West- 
ford. Adelaide's eyes followed the direc- 
tion of his, and in the changing colour of 
Mrs. Westford, she saw a confirmation, if 
indeed she had previously doubted it, of the 
allegation against jMadoc; but the lady's 
confusion was but momentary â€” she knew 
the penetrating eyes that were upon her, 
and the reflection made her almost instantly 
recover herself â€” " Such an assertion could 
not be made,** she calmly observed, " with- 
out proof, to support it; and this, of 



212 CONTRAST. 

course, Miss Mountflorence was prepared 
with." 

" Assuredly," said his lordship; " let 
her but convince me of the truth of what 
she has now said, and not for another mo- 
ment will I deny credit to any thing she 
may assert in her own vindication." 

This was a temptation indeed to do 
what was required, but a temptation Ade- 
laide would not yield to, from a conviction 
of the consequences likely to result from 
the attempt; even as it was, might not, 
what had already escaped, be a means of 
involving, in still deeper affliction, the un- 
happy being to whom she was under such 
obligations ? and as the thought occurred, 
she bitterly regretted the burst of indig- 
nation that had hurried her into betray- 
ing, what consideration for others required 
her yet a little longer to have concealed : 
for was not her sudden knowledge of the 
real circumstances of Madoc, calculated to 
create a suspicion of the fact â€” namely, his 
victim and her mother being concealed 
somewhere in the place ? All she could 
decide on, to make amends for what she 
deplored, was to remain obstinately silent 



CONTRAST. 2 IS 

to any further interrogation on the sub- 
ject ; but in what an added dilemma did 
the determination place her ! Yet, if she 
took lord Le Poer aside â€” but no, she could 
not hope that he v;ould give credit to any- 
thing not proved by the parties accused 
and accusing being confronted with each 
other; and overcome by the increasing 
perplexities of her situation, her head 
grew dizzy, and ere an effort could be 
made to catch her, she sunk fainting on 
the floor. 

On recovering, she found herself in her 
own room, with one of the Welsh ser- 
vants busied about her. She presently 
dismissed her, impatient to re-examine 
the chamber, in hopes of yet discovering 
what she wished ; but in vain she search- 
ed and sounded against the walls, and 
tears could not be suppressed at her dis- 
appointment: but surely her new friend 
would not abandon her in this extremity ! 
â€” she would not allow her to remain at 
the mercy of those to whom it was threat- 
ened she should be entirely given up ! for 
she made herself sure, from what had al- 
ready transpired, of her knowing all that 



214 CONTRAST. 

was passing within the walls: but no- 
thing occurred to at all relieve or sooth 
her mind; her only consolation was de- 
rived from the conviction, that lord Le 
Poer had not yet departed, feeling per- 
suaded that the moment they were freed 
from the restraint imposed by his pre- 
sence, no efforts would be spared by the 
vile contrivers of the scheme for her de- 
struction, to extort from her the means 
by which she had become acquainted with 
the marriage of Madoc. Her meals were 
brought in by the Welsh servant, and 
sending them was the only notice taken 
of her throughout the day. 

As night approached, she became still 
more restless, from the expectation she 
was indulging ; but it advanced without 
bringing the wished-for visitor : but she 
would not despair, and she continued to 
watch at the side of the bed, ready to 
start up at the slightest sound, and more 
than once betrayed into a belief of some 
one being approaching, by the rustling of 
the birds amidst the ivy of the battle- 
ments, till sleep surprised her, worn out 
as she was by the intense anxiety of the 



CONTRAST. 215 

day, and the wakefulness of the preceding 
night. 

As she slept, she fancied a figure, in ra- 
diant white, stood beside the bed, and 
gently touching her, retreated, in a beck- 
oning attitude, to a nook beside the fire- 
place. She woke at the instant, and start- 
ing up, perceived the door of a long press, 
or cupboard, inserted in the wall, lying 
open, and the back part, to which shelves 
were affixed, drawn aside. At length then 
was betrayed the way by which Mrs. 
Mowbray had gained access to the cham- 
ber : eager to explore, she was snatching 
up her candle, when it expired in the 
socket ; this, however, though a distressing 
circumstance, could not prevent the in- 
tended effort ; and accordingly, passing 
through the aperture, she began groping 
her way along the secret passages of the 
building ; but with all her caution, so pro- 
found was the darkness, she could not 
avoid several falls, through coming unex- 
pectedly upon steep flights of steps: at 
length, after winding about till she got 
utterly fatigued, without coming to any 
outlet, she began to reflect on what she 



216 CONTRAST. 

had heard of the labyrinthian intricacies of 
these passages. As the thought occurred, 
the impropriety of venturing further be- 
came obvious, and she set about retracing 
her steps ; but in her attempt to do this, 
she was soon convinced she had failed. 
Her sensation at the moment may easily 
be conceived ; while she stood considering 
what she should do, whether she should 
venture to call out, a cold hand suddenly 
seized hers, and dragged her onward, spite 
of all resistance. At length a current of 
cold air announced to her that she was near 
one of the outlets of the building. Hardly 
was she sensible of this, ere a mantle was 
thrown over her head, and she felt herself 
placed before some one on horseback, who 
firmly grasping her round the waist, gal- 
loped off with her. After proceeding 
about, what she conceived, a mile, the 
horse stopped ; she was lifted down â€” a pa- 
per thrust into her hand, and instantly 
after she heard the horse galloping away. 
She immediately threw up the mantle, 
and morning being by this time broke, 
examined the paper, and saw it was a writ- 
ten one, merely containing a line, to in- 



CONTRAST, 217 

form her, that a place was secured for her, 

to , men tioning that part of Devonshire 

in which her friends, the Courtney s, resided, 
in a coach, that would take her up in the 
course of a short time, at the place at 
which she was set down. She now look- 
ed about her, and found herself nearly op- 
posite a small country inn ; she instinc- 
tively approached it, and was met at the 
door by the landlady, who, inquiring whe- 
ther she was not the young woman for 
whom a seat had been taken in the coach 
that baited at the house, shewed her 
into a parlour, where breakfast was pre- 
pared. 

Well, her deliverance was now effected, 
and doubtless by Mrs. Mowbray. But 
why had she affected so much mystery 
about it ? â€” why set about it in a manner so 
calculated to alarm ? It was accomplished, 
however, and it was not for her to cavil at 
the means ; but she could not immediately 
divest herself of anxious fears ; she was 
still in the vicinity of danger, and rejoice 
she accordingly did at the first sound of 
the approaching coach, and not a little, 

VOL. II. L 



218 CONTRAST. 

also, at finding there was but another pas- 
senger beside herself, and that one a female. 
She had now full leisure to ponder and 
reflect on her situation, for her companion 
was literally, for the first few miles, a sleep- 
ing one; and how much like a romance 
did all that had recently occurred appear ? 
but would her romance end, as romances 
generally did, in the administration of 
poetical justice? but if not here, it would 
be rendered, where the happiness attend- 
ant on it would never more be liable to 
interruption : but, according to the course 
of nature, there was a long journey yet be- 
fore her ; and it certainly was a melancholy 
thought, that of being uncheered and un- 
supported by the love and esteem she va- 
lued; but she would hope the best â€” the 
explanation, so necessary for her vindica- 
tion, must, at some period or other, take 
place, and might perhaps be permitted ere 
too late for the retrieval of what was essen- 
tial to her. But in the interim, in what 
a light must she be regarded by lord Le 
Poer! She knew not how to call him 
father, for what paternal affection had 
he ever evinced towards ber? and how 



CONTRAST. 219 

must every surmise to her prejudice be 
confirmed by her flight? Had he been 
less harsh, less stern, much of pain and 
perplexity would have been saved her; 
but in this instance she knew not how to 
condemn him, for appearances were cer- 
tainly against her, and she was not one of 
those who know not how to excuse an 
error, or mistake in judgment. The nearer 
she approached her destination, the more 
agitated she became, from the reflection 
that she would shortly be out of suspense 
as to what she had to hope or fear. 

She was at last set down within a mile 
or two of what she termed her native home ; 
and now seriously began to consider what 
she should do? â€” whether proceed at once to 
Mr. Courtney's, or procure a messenger to 
apprize Sophia of her arrival in the neigh- 
bourhood ? She at length decided on the 
latter, from her inability to account, in any 
way not likely to involve her in embar- 
rassments to Mr. Courtney, for her unex- 
pected appearance ; and having done so, 
bent her steps towards the cottage of an 
old pensioner on his bounty, to whom she 
l2 



220 CONTRAST. 

was known from her infancy. The day 
was, by this time, drawing to a close, and, 
united to the far advance of the season, 
made every thing look bleak and dismal. 
How altered! thought Adelaide, with a 
sigh ; but was not every thing altered to 
her? was she not now a fugitive, without 
any certain home â€” any certainty of that 
kindness and affection she had once expe- 
rienced? and more than once, she was 
compelled to pause, to wipe away the 
tears that dimmed her sight at the thought. 

She found Goody enjoying herself by 
her evening fire. â€” ** Well, Margery," she 
said, " you'll be surprised, I dare say, to 
see me." 

" Surprised !" cried Margery, starting 
up from her low-backed chair, and re- 
treating to a little distance â€” " that I be ! 
Who could have thought ? â€” yet I might 
have known that a stranger was coming, 
by the one I saw but this instant on the 
bar of the grate." 

^'^ Why, to be sure, I have been long 
enough away to be considered something 
in the light of a stranger ; but," for the 



CONTRAST. 221 

first time observing her dress, " I am sor- 
ry, Margery, to see you in mourning." 

" To be sure â€” no wonder ; and though 
it is a good gown, of the best twilled stuff, 
as you may see," holding it up for her ex- 
amination, " blessings on him who gave 
it me ! the Lord he knows I cried enough, 
putting it on, to think of what had hap- 
pened." 

" Why, what happened ?" demanded 
Adelaide, in a tone of extreme alarm â€” 
" who is it you got it from ?" 

" From Mr. Courtney, sure!" 

" From him ! But my heart misgave 
me that it was for some one of his family 
you were in mourning." 

" And you don't know for whom ? 
Dear heart, to think of this ! â€” But, O 
the Saints ! how white you be turned ! 
Don't ye faint, I beg, till I get ye a cup 
of my cowslip wine." 

" No, no, I need nothing !" cried Ade- 
laide, impatiently ; " do not, therefore, 
keep me in this torturing suspense." 

" And so you know nothing of all that 
has been happening here ? Well, to think 
it should fall to my lot to tell you ! But 



222 CONTRAST. 

from this, I take it, you have not yet 
been to the house ?" 

" No ; I have but this instant got out 
of the coach that brought me here." 

"And in your way to the house, step- 
ped in, to see how I was ? Well, I take 
that so kind ! But you were always good 
and kind, Miss Adelaide ; and so was she 
w^ho is gone : many a poor person's bless- 
ing followed her to the grave !" 

" You don't mean Sophia ?" cried Ade- 
laide, in a faltering tone. 

Margery shook her head, and Adelaide 
dropped back in her chair, completely 
stunned by this unexpected blow; the 
death of Sophia depriving her, not only of 
her dearest friend, but of all certain means 
of vindicating her injured fame; and â€” 
" What should she do?"â€”" What would 
become of her ?" were her wild exclama- 
tions, as, after a violent gush of tears, she 
came a little to herself. Yet, perhaps, in 
her last moments, Sophia might have 
thought of her. Yet, no ; had she entered 
into any explanation concerning her, with 
her father, would he have delayed a mo- 
ment doing her that justice she had a right 



CONTRAST. 223 

to expect? and all hope of ever being re- 
stored to the favour of her family was now 
at an end. 

Margery, in her simple way, essayed all 
the consolation she could think of, but in 
vain. At length, the thoughts of the 
afflicted girl reverting, in a degree, from 
herself to the distressed family, she in- 
quired how they bore their irreparable loss 
â€” the father in particular ? 

" AVhy, bad enough, that's the truth 
on't. Miss. But I supposes as how, since 
you didn't hear of one thing, you didn't 
of another â€” of the wedding, as well as 
death, in the family ?" 

"Whose wedding?" asked Adelaide, 
vaguely. 

" Whose ! why, ]\Iiss Celia's, sure." 
" Hers ! why is Celia married ?" 
" That she is ; and 'tis she that had the 
wedding. Such grand doings! But, as 
one may say, the funeral of one sister trod 
upon the wedding of the other. But Miss 
Sophia's medical attendant said, he wasn't 
surprised at her going off in the way she 
did, as she had been pining for some time: 
yet, looking so beautiful as she did, who 



224 CONTRAST. 

would have thought of her being a cold 
corpse so soon after? But to be sure, you 
guess. Miss, who Miss Celia is married to?" 

" Young Mr. Fortescue." 

Margery nodded, and proceeded to en- 
ter into particulars, which, we may sup- 
pose, were addressed to a very inattentive 
ear: Adelaide, however, understood enough 
to know that the bridal party had set off, 
immediately after the ceremony, and were 
still absent. â€” " And there," continued old 
Margery, " after our all getting fine white 
ribbons, and what not, we were obliged 
to put on black. To be sure, the two girls 
at Mr. Courtney's cried with vexation; 
and no wonder, seeing that white gene- 
rally turns yellow with lying by. But, as 
I told them, by way of comfort, there's a 
remedy for every thing but death; if it 
should be as they fear. Master Logwood 
will give them a dip for a trifle, so there 
will be no harm done." 

Adelaide rose, and walked about the 
room. From the turn matters had taken, 
she deemed it expedient that her arrival 
in the neighbourhood should not be 
known ; and accordingly, after a little he- 



CONTRAST. 225 

sitation, gave JMargery a caution to that 
effect, with a determination to set off 
forthwith to London, in order to consult 
Mountflorence, who, by this time, she con- 
cluded was there, on the subject of her per- 
plexities; assured, that on his judgment, 
and delicacy of feeling, she might safely 
rely. Yet such was the predicament in 
which she found herself placed, that she 
knew not how any means of relieving her 
from it could possibly be devised; yet, 
suffering as she did from the apprehen- 
sion, she felt she could better endure what 
she was experiencing, than the thought, 
by any want of due caution, of having 
planted a dagger in the heart of a fond fa- 
ther, or changed the nature of the tears 
he shed over the early grave of his loved, 
lamented child. She was suffering; but 
it was in the sacred cause of friendship â€” 
through a feehng of gratitude; and must 
there not, was there not, consolation in 
the reflection ? The world might call her 
romantic, for the part she had acted, but 
she had acted according to her own sense 
of right ; and there is a satisfaction in that, 
that nothing can deprive us of. What 
l3 



226 CONTRAST. 

did she not owe to the family of the 
Courtneys ? to that kind and benevolent 
being, whose roof had been the shelter of 
a deserted mother's head ? to whose com- 
passion, whose fostering care, she was in- 
debted herself, for all the comforts she 
had hitherto experienced â€” for all the ad- 
vantages that adorned her youth ? What 
did she not owe Mr. Courtney ? had he 
not been to her a second parent ? but for 
him, what probably might she have been ? 
and as the thought occurred of the debt â€” 
the wondrous debt of gratitude she owed 
him, she felt that, had her sufferings been 
infinitely greater than they were, on his 
account, she would willingly have under- 
gone them. 

These are the feelings of the pure ethe- 
real soul, like that of courage in the breast 
of man, becoming stronger, more firm, 
and purified, as they are tried. As the 
heart of Adelaide dilated with them, she 
experienced that soothing sensation that 
not the most intense of present joys can 
ylhatch â€” that delicious glow, that results 
from the consciousness of not having given 
ourselves any just cause for reproach. 



CONTRAST. 227 

It IS true, she had no one to blame for 
what she had undergone on poor Sophia's 
account but herself; but was it not the 
ardour of friendship^? â€” was it not that affec- 
tion that in the mind of youth is so apt to 
stimulate us to make the condition of our 
adopted friend our own, that had hurried 
her into the error she had committed ? 

While these thoughts or reflections were 
passing in her mind, INIargery was prepar- 
ing a supper and a bed for her, after hav- 
ing happily succeeded in securing a place 
in one of the passing stages of the next 
day. The church-yard lay adjoining, and 
while her humble hostess was thus em- 
ployed, Adelaide glided away to it A 
new-raised hillock, close to the grave of 
her mother, beneath a yew tree's shade, de- 
noted the spot where Sophia slumbered, 
unconscious of the evils she had brought 
upon her friend ; but these were now all 
forgotten, as she hung over the grave â€” 
Sophia's misfortunes alone appeared before 
her ; she thought of nought else, of nought 
but what made her very soul seem dis- 
solving within her in pity and tenderness. 
All was quiet and lonely ; sufficient light 



228 CONTRAST. 

yet lingered in the sky to permit objects 
to be dimly visible ; not a breath of wind 
disturbed the leaves of the trees, which 
shaded the narrow beds of sleeping morta- 
lity ; and as the shadows threw their dark- 
ness far, the pausing spirit of Adelaide felt 
the deep impressive stillness of the hour. 
She cast her eyes around, but where could 
she look that some affecting recollection 
was not revived ? There were the quiet 
fields, in which it was so delightful to 
loiter on a summer's sabbath eve, listening 
to the music of the village bells, 

*' Falling at intervals upon the ear 
In cadence sweet, now dying all away ; 
Now pealing loud again, and louder still. 
Clear and sonorous, as the gale came on." 

There the woods, within whose bowery 
recesses, so many happy hours had been 
passed with her, whom the voice of Spring 
could no more wake to its enjoyments; 
and, beyond all, there were the clustered 
chimneys of the beloved dwelling, that 
had so long been a happy refuge to her ; 
and tears unconsciously strayed down her 
cheeks at the recollections that recurred. 
While indulging them, she was startled 



CONTRAST. 229 

by observing a man loitering near her. 
She instantly retreated to Goody's; yet 
there was no occasion to be alarmed â€” it 
was certainly one of the villagers she 
saw; yet, undoubtedly, the stranger just 
seen had very much the appearance of a 
man she had noticed on the outside of the 
coach, to whom her attention was attracted 
by having reason, in the course of her jour- 
ney, to imagine she was an object of parti- 
cular attention to him. But supposing this 
person and he were the same, that could 
be no matter to her ; for she might rest sa- 
tisfied, that it was not quietly tracing her 
would satisfy her enemies ; and she endea- 
voured to still the sudden panic of her 
breast ; but she could not help being glad 
she was to be oflF early in the morning. 
At the first dawn of day she was up ; she 
had just swallowed a cup of milk, when 
she heard the welcome sound of the ap- 
proaching coach ; with a starting tear she 
took leave of Goody, and was presently 
out of sight of the beloved scenes of her 
early youth.

" Oh, Time ! the beautifier of the deadâ€” 

Adorner of the ruin â€” comforter, 

And only healer when the heart hath bled.'^ 

Again she had to consider what she 
should do. She might not be able to ob- 
tain an immediate interview with Mount- 
florence ; and in the interim, to what might 
she not be exposed, if without any protec- 
tion ? At length Helena occurred to her 
recollection, with whose residence a paper 
seen by chance in Wales had acquainted 
her; and to her, the warm-hearted, the 
generous Helena, she decided on repairing 
directly on her arrival, assuring herself 
that from her she should not seek in vain 
the accommodation she required. 

Dizzy for want of rest, she reached the 
end of her journey, at an early hour the 
next morning ; and inquiring her way to 
the residence of Helena, immediately set 
out for it on foot, the nearly exhausted 



CONTRAST. 231 

state of her finances rendering the consi- 
deration of expence now one of very ma- 
terial import to her. The morning was 
sufficiently cold and cheerless to have ren- 
dered a coach very desirable, but circum- 
stances must be submitted to ; and Ade- 
laide endeavoured to support, without 
murmuring, what further she was under- 
going, from the reception she looked for- 
ward to receiving from Helena; but, to 
her extreme disappointment, on reaching 
her mansion, she found it, like almost 
every other in its vicinity, still shut up. 
She could hardly suppress tears at this 
circumstance, sinking as she was, by this 
time, with fatigue, and wanting courage 
to attempt knocking. 

At length, after a few disconsolate turns 
before it, the door opened, and a house- 
maid came forth. Adelaide, timidly ac- 
costing her, inquired whether her lady 
was yet up ? 

** My lady up !" repeated the girl, with 
a stare of astonishment ; " lauk a mercy ! 
why she's hardly a-bed yet, my dear ! â€” Up 
indeed!" and she laughed, as she began 
scrubbing her steps, at the ignorance of 



232 CONTRAST. 

fashionable life which the question denoted. 

Adelaide sighed, and felt a faint sick- 
ness stealing over her. â€” " Why, how pale 
you look!" cried the girl, suddenly raising 
herself on her knees to regard her â€” " and 
your eyes so heavy, for all the world like 
a person who had been up all night !" 

" I have been up all night, travelling," 
said Adelaide, " and am very much fa- 
tigued, having but this instant got out of 
the coach." 

" Without getting a morsel of break- 
fast, perhaps? and it such a cold, raw 
morning â€” no wonder you should look so 
bad. But come, step in ; I have just kin- 
dled the hall-fire, and will soon be able to 
get you a cup of tea, for I never wait for 
none of them : that wouldn't do for I, who 
am obligated to be up by cock-crow." 

Adelaide, accepting the kind invitation, 
was placed before a comfortable fire, where 
she was gradually sinking into a slumber, 
when she was roused by her new friend 
bringing her some breal^fast. Revived by 
this, she thought it might be as well to 
apprise the lady of the mansion at once 
who it was that was so desirous of seeing 



CONTRAST. 23S 

her, and accordingly, asking for writing 
materials, wrote a few lines for the pur- 
pose, expressing her hope that the auspices 
under which they had become acquainted 
would prevent her being deemed guilty of 
an unwarrantable liberty, in requesting 
the shelter of her roof, for a few days, un- 
til she should have obtained an opportu- 
nity of seeing major Mountflorence. 

With this billet the good-natured 
housemaid proceeded to the chamber of 
the lady's lady, not daring to think of in- 
truding into that of the former. The lit- 
tle ceremony she used in entering rousing 
Mrs. Flower from a very agreeable slum- 
ber, she would have received a very severe 
reprimand for her rudeness, but that the 
anger of the souhrette was diverted by the 
excitement of her curiosity. To gratify 
this, she started up, and hastily dressing, 
hurried down stairs, where her astonish- 
ment at finding, in Adelaide, the person 
of whom she had received so extraordinary 
an account, was not slight. The suspicion 
that was excited did not permit her to be 
very scrupulous in her questions; but 
these obtaining her no satisfaction, she 



234 CONTRAST. 

hurried off to her lady with the billet, and 
as unceremoniously disturbing her, as she 
had been herself disturbed, put it into her 
hand. 

As Helena cast her eye over it, her 
cheek flushed ; but not so much through 
surprise, as a feeling of mingled bitterness 
and indignation. Treating her with the 
studied neglect and indifference that 
Mountflorence had done, she conceived 
the present liberty one that was not ex- 
cusable ; for that it was through him Ade- 
laide had thought of repairing to her 
house she could not doubt, and she ac- 
cordingly dedded on refusing her request. 
To what was unwarrantable she fancied 
the determination owing; but had she 
carefully examined her heart, she would 
have found it probably as imputable to a 
rankling sensation of jealousy as to any 
other cause. 

Adelaide was now ushered to the break- 
fast-parlour, where, in the course of a short 
time, she was joined by the agitated He- 
lena. The moment she heard her ap- 
proaching, yielding to the natural feelings 
of her own heart, she started up to receive 



CONTRAST. 235 

her; but hardly had she cast her eyes 
upon her, ere, as the sailors say, she was 
completely thrown abaft, by her cold, her 
supercilious air, her fashionable â€” " How 
do ?" and â€” " I hope I see ]Miss Mountflo- 
rence well." 

Chilled, dismayed, almost to fainting, 
Adelaide reseated herself unconsciously. 
Was then another door barred against 
her? was Miss Rossglen, naturally so 
candid, so liberal, also prejudiced against 
her, through the unhappy misconstruction 
that had been put on recent circum- 
stances ? But might she not make an ef- 
fort to vindicate herself with her? But, 
no, there was nothing in her looks to en- 
courage such an attempt â€” nothing but 
what was cold and forbidding. 

Miss Bridgemore quickly joined them, 
curious to see who Miss Rossglen's early 
visitor was. After a little forced chit-chat 
with her, suddenly addressing herself to 
Adelaide â€” " So I find you have been tra- 
velling all night. Miss Mountflorence?" 
Helena said. 

Adelaide bowed. 

" What a horribly disagreeable thing 



236 CONTRAST. 

that of travelling all night must be !" in 
a tone of affectation, said Miss Bridge- 
more. 

" Yes, so I should suppose," rejoined 
Helena ; " but it is one of those disagree- 
able things, from the necessity of which I 
have been exempt." 

Adelaide sighed. She was equally en- 
titled to an exemption from all that was 
inconvenient and disagreeable ; but cir- 
cumstances had made against her, and she 
must submit with patience to what they 
occasioned. But tears could not be sup- 
pressed ; the present was a disappointment 
that struck to her heart. Helena affected 
not to see these tears; but they caused 
some little emotion, some little stir of na- 
tural feeling in her bosom ; she struggled 
against it however â€” she would not relent ; 
like Yorick with his monk, she was pre- 
determined; so taking up a newspaper, 
she began to read, and laugh, and descant 
on the various articles that came under her 
notice, and in short to be wholly occupied 
by them. 

Adelaide was surprised. Was this con- 
sistent with her general character ? â€” Was 



CONTRAST. 237 

it kind, was it maidenly, to join with the 
cruel world in scorning one of her own sex ? 
Â»--one too known under such different cir- 
cumstances, and who, even if convicted of 
the indiscretion of which she was accused, 
had yet youth and inexperience to plead 
for her. 

At length, laying down the paper â€” 
" Ten thousand calls have I to make this 
morning," said Helena ; " so, as I shall be 
driving all over the town, is there any 
place. Miss Mountflorence, where I can 
have the pleasure of setting you down ?" 

Adelaide's quivering lips could scarce 
frame themselves to reply to this question, 
such was the dismay it occasioned ; for was 
it not to be apprehended from it that He- 
lena meditated refusing her request ? yet 
could she be so cruel ? Though she might 
deem her unworthy of her further acquaint- 
ance, surely she could not of her pity â€” her 
compassion ; and though wounding in the 
extreme to be indebted alone to these feel- 
ings for what she had solicited from her, 
yet any thing was preferable to the idea of 
being without positive protection, in such 
^ wilderness as London. But she was not 



238 CONTRAST. 

allowed to remain long in suspense on the 
subject. 

" Since I cannot have that pleasure 
then," proceeded Helena, " shall my ser- 
vant procure a coach for you, for I am so 
particularly engaged, that 1 cannot solicit 
your longer stay with me at present ?" 

This was decisive; and the shock sus- 
tained by this unkindness had nearly over- 
come the distressed Adelaide; still strug- 
gling however to maintain a command 
over herself, she coldly replied, as she rose, 
and turned to a window to conceal her 
emotion, that she would not give that 
trouble. 

The haziness of the dawn had by this 
time ended in rain, and all without was as 
cheerless as her own immediate prospects. 
What should she do, uncertain as she was 
of immediately seeing Mountflorence ? 
She hesitated. Should she make a posi- 
tive demand on the pity of Helena, by 
declaring, or explicitly explaining, the sad 
predicament in which she then stood? 
But, alas ! must not the request she had 
made, must not her dejected appearance, 
have already intimated this ? and, heart- 



CONTRAST. 239 

lessly as the intimation had been received, 
could she humble herself to downright 
supplication ? â€” No ! she felt she could not 
â€” could not so utterly forget their equality 
of condition ! and restored to momentary 
strength by the stimulus of pride, she 
hastily tied on her bonnet, and telling He- 
lena she would no longer intrude, took 
leave. 

Of course, her plan was now to seek 
Mountfiorence without delay, and accord- 
ingly, on quitting Helena's, she inquired 
her way to lady Anstruther's, where only 
she could hear of him ; but here disap- 
pointment also awaited her, and, if pos- 
sible, of a still severer nature than the one 
she had just experienced, being informed 
that Mountfiorence had returned to Ireland. 

More dead than alive, she turned from 
the door, too agitated and confused to be 
conscious of the curiosity, or rather imper- 
tinence, she had excited. What would 
become of her?â€” Where should she seek 
shelter ? â€” How procure it with her scanty 
means ? And she would have reproached 
herself for not sooner taking this into con- 
sideration, had there been any other course 



240 CONTRAST. 

for her to pursue, than the one she had 
adopted. 

She was walking on mechanically, when 
some one walking beside her, made her 
uplift her heavy eyes, and she beheld the 
stranger, whom she had noticed in her 
journey from Wales, and afterwards, she 
was now certain, seen in the churchyard 
in Devonshire. 

" You seem surprised," he said, on her 
involuntarily pausing to look at him *, " yet 
had your attention been less occupied, you 
would have perceived that I have been 
close on your steps, ever since your quit- 
ting Wales." 

" On mine !" said Adelaide, faintly, 
seized with sudden alarm ; for in this per- 
son she only saw a cruel agent of her 

father's â€” " Pray may I ask " but the 

question she was about putting, she had 
not power to articulate â€” she felt herself 
sinking; and whether friend or foe, re- 
gardless at the moment, caught the stran- 
ger's arm for support.

*' That pleases and yet shocks me. I can laugh, 
Aud I can weep â€” can hope and can despond â€” 
Feel wrath aud pitj, when I think on her !" 

Dissatisfied with every one, lord Le 
Poer repaired to London, giving up Ade- 
laide, in every sense of the word, as a lost 
girl, and bitterly repentant of not having 
braved the threats of Mr. Courtney, by re- 
fusing, in any way, to acknowledge her; 
but this he believed he should, but for her 
unfortunate likeness to his favourite sister : 
however, the past could not be recalled ; 
and all he now hoped was, that he might 
never hear more of her, convinced that he 
could not, without receiving some addi- 
tional cause of vexation on her account. 

De Montville, just at this juncture, did 
not exactly help to put him in better hu- 
mour, either with himself or others ; rest- 
less and unsettled, and even puppyish, as 
at times he seemed to be â€” flying about

helter-skelter, from one place to another, 
and ridiculing all that his lordship wished 
him to think seriously about : but it would 
not do â€” marry he should, and that short- 
ly, he determined ; but in vain he propo- 
sed alliance after aUiance to him â€” like 
Beatrice, he still contrived, in all that were 
mentioned to him, to find something to 
dislike or cavil at ; and lord Le Poer, in 
consequence, became still more confirmed 
in the apprehension, with which he had 
long been haunted, of his having formed an 
attachment abroad. True, in contradiction 
to this, he had evinced no reluctance to 
the proposed union with Adelaide; but 
then, this was probably because he knew 
not how it was to be avoided, and she was 
besides really pretty enough to render a 
young man inconstant ; but now, that all 
idea of her was relinquished, his thoughts 
reverted to their first object : but he would 
not be baffled and opposed by every one 
â€” he would himself, since he chose to be 
so fastidious and difficult to please, choose 
for him, for he would not brook that his 
death should be impatiently looked for, in 
order that people might foUow their own 



CONTRAST. 243 

whims and vagaries ; and either force him 
to acquiesce in his choice, or else know 
the reason why. 

He had just come to this resolve, when, 
late one evening, as he and De Montville 
were sitting, not very sociably together, 
a gentleman, of the name of Fortescue, 
was announced, desiring an interview with 
his lordship, if perfectly disengaged. 

Lord Le Poer ordered him to be shewn 

up, and a tall, grave, important-looking 

personage was ushered into the apartment. 

Compliments passed, and a seat taken 

â€” " Mr. De Montville, I presume?" said 

the stranger, glancing at him. 

Lord Le Poer bowed. 

" Oh, then I may proceed to business ; 

but I must beg " He hesitated a 

little, hemmed, coughed, and finally 
took out his snufF-box â€” " I must beg," 
he resumed, after taking a long pinch of 
snufF, and deliberately returning his 
box to his pocket, " that there may be 
no agitation â€” that what I have to com- 
municate may be hearkened to with calm- 
ness." 



244 CONTRAST. 

Lord Le Poer got impatient, and could 
have wished him he did not know where, 
at the moment, from the emotion caused 
by his caution against it, to create which 
he could not help suspecting indeed was 
the intention in giving it, for he fancied 
he saw something like a little malice, or 
satire, lurking in the eye of the stranger. 

" My name you know, my lord," pro- 
ceeded Mr. Fortescue ; " but in addition 
to this knowledge, there is a little more 
concerning me, that you must also know, 
ere I can enter upon the business that 
brought me here. You are to understand 
then, that on my return to this my native 
isle, after a long absence, I settled myself in 
Devonshire. I am not fond of making ac- 
quaintances, and this circumstance soon ob- 
tained me, in my new neighbourhood, the 
character of a proud, stately personage, va- 
luing himself a good deal upon that which 
no man should value himself alone for: 
however, it answered the purpose of keep- 
ing aloof troublesome people, so I was sa- 
tisfied with it. A son, and some young 
lasses, constituted my family ; and per- 
haps it was in a degree on their account 



CONTRAST. 245 

that I was disinclined to forming new inti- 
macies. But the young are not to be con- 
fined within the lines of circumvallation 
that experience]would extend round them : 
my young Florizel soon discovered for 
himself, in the vicinity of his new abode, 
a Perdita, sufficiently charming to render 
him forgetful of all he might have thought 
he had to fear, from giving away his heart 
without my permission. The courtship 
had been going on some time, when it, at 
length, came to the knowledge of the 
young lady's father, Mr. Courtney, who 
persuaded, from all he had heard of me, 
that it was an attachment I would never 
sanction, immediately called, to apprize 
me of it. I certainly had more worldly 
views for my son, and this I confessed to 
him ; but at the same time, was so much 
pleased by the rectitude and honour mani- 
fested by his conduct on this occasion, that I 
could not forbear expressing my readiness 
to wave these in favour of the young lady, 
provided, when of a suitable age to marry, 
for I then regarded them as little better 
than children, the sentiments of the par- 
ties remained unaltered, and both she, and 



246 CONTRAST. 

those connected with her, proved them- 
selves still as entitled to esteem and general 
regard as they then were. I fear I appear 
abrupt; but I hate to be prolix, or keep 
any one in suspense, on a subject I know 
must be interesting to them, so always come 
to the point as soon as possible ; thus, in 
one respect at least, following the golden 
rule, of doing to others as I would they 
should do unto me. 

*â€¢' The dwelling of Mr. Courtney was 
exactly the kind of one adapted to render 
any one romantic, in the least inclined to 
be so, such were the delightful associations 
connected with it. The honeysuckle that 
flaunted round its old-fashioned windows, 
embalmed the evening air ; a venerable 
grove, partially shaded one side, while in 
front babbled a clear rivulet, over which 
a rustic bridge led to a walk ascending 
to the house, amidst a wilderness of sweets, 
screened by hedges of myrtle, so luxuriant, 
that they could not be gazed at without 
bringing to mindSavary's beautiful descrip- 
tion of the myrtle shades of Greece ; and, in 
short, the more I saw and heard of him and 
his, the less could I feel surprise, if indeed 



CONTRAST. 247 

I ever experienced a sensation of the kind 
at the circumstance, at the attachment my 
young gentleman had formed for one of 
the family : but I forgot I was describing 
to you what you had seen â€” a proof how 
much we delight in dwelling on what has 
made an agreeable impression on our own 
imagination. In what nook, however, of 
this wicked world, shall w^e find a paradise 
not liable to the entrance of a serpent ? or 
where the state not subject to chances and 
changes ? no matter what the rank or con- 
dition in life: but the storm rends the 
knotted oak, and the careless foot crushes 
the humble violet ; the strength of the 
one is no security from destruction, nei- 
ther the obscurity of the other ; into this 
lowly dwelling, comparatively speaking, 
a wily deceiver had insinuated herself, 
only waiting for a fit opportunity to prac- 
tise her arts. 

" Contiguous to the habitation of Mr. 
Courtney w^as a cottage, occupied, about 
the time I am speaking of, by a person of 
the name of Westford." 

Lord Le Poer started; nor did De 



!248 CONTRAST. 

Montville hear this name without some 
indication of emotion. 

" By cautioning you against surprise, I 
thought I had prepared you to hear some- 
thing that might occasion agitation," said 
Mr. Fortescue; " I have now to beg," 
glancing first at De Montville, and then, 
more particularly addressing himself to 
his lordship, " that you will endeavour to 
suppress any feelings anticipation may give 
rise to, in order that I may relieve you, as 
speedily as possible, from the suspense I 
see I have excited." 

A bow was the reply, and he thus pro- 
ceeded â€” " This person was the widow of 
an alderman in a neighbouring city, on 
whose death she experienced a change of 
circumstances, that compelled her to the 
necessity of withdrawing into retirement, 
than which nothing could have greater 
horrors for her imagination, passionately 
devoted as she was to cards, and dress, and 
entertaining. But what was to be done? 
she was sensible she was rather past the 
age in which an establishment like her 
first might be hoped for ; and she had no 
handsome daughter or niece, through whose 



CONTRAST. 249 

means she might speculate on being re- 
stored to any of her former enjoyments. 
Life, however, as she now spent it, was 
hardly endurable, cut off as she was from 
all she delighted in; for if by any odd 
chance, a rubber was made up, the trouble 
of shuffling the cards was hardly paid for, 
by the low rate of playing ; and then, so 
scrupulous, so conscientious ! but though 
not very mentally endowed, she had suffi- 
cient tact to conceal her real feelings and 
propensities from her new neighbours, par- 
ticularly the Courtneys, whose regard she 
was most solicitous to cultivate, from their 
extreme kindliness of disposition ; and so 
well did she act her part with them, as 
ere long to fully acquire what she wished ; 
but it was for something more than the 
mere sake of attention, she was so anxious 
for this. The pleasant consequences that 
might result from having the chaperoning 
one of Mr. Courtney's pretty daughters, 
at some place of fashionable resort, soon 
presented themselves to her imagination ; 
and led to such speciousness of manner, 
and affectation of sentiment, as, obtaining 
m3 



250 CONTRAST. 

her his entire confidence, prevented his hav- 
ing any hesitation in allowing his eldest 
girl, Sophia, to accompany her to Sid- 
mouth, whither, she pretended, indisposi- 
tion obliged her suddenly to go. 

" Miss Courtney was too pretty, and 
put too much in the way of notice, not 
soon to attract attention. Amongst the 
fashionable loiterers at the place, who par- 
ticularly distinguished her, was sir Osbert 
Henley, of whom, we may truly say, that 
the less is said the better. 

" The views which had brought Mrs. 
Westford here were not of a nature to 
allow her to practise much disguise, and 
their development led to all those agree- 
able consequences that she had anticipated, 
from having so sweet a girl under her 
protection. The great particularity of sir 
Osbert would soon have induced the men- 
tion o his name at home, by Miss Court- 
ney, but for the insidious caution of her 
companion, who, affecting to believe her 
father a man of over-rigid and scrupulous 
notions, strongly advised her against the 
measure for a little while, lest of its creat- 
ing an alarm, that might be the means of

her being hurried away, ere sir Osbert had 
time to analyze or understand what his 
sentiments for her really were. 

" After the sojourn of a few weeks at 
Sidmouth, Mrs. Westford pretended to 
have received an invitation to Yorkshire, 
from an old friend : leave was immediately 
solicited for Miss Courtney to also accom- 
pany her in this further excursion, and 
was as readily obtained as in the first in- 
stance; for though strict and cautious, 
still it was the delight of Mr. Courtney's 
fondly-paternal heart to indulge his chil- 
dren, whenever he could do so, consistently 
with his notions of propriety. Sir Osbert 
was the escort of the travellers to an out- 
of-the-way place, where Mrs. Westford 
was received by her pretended friend, 
who, out of complaisance to her, invited 
the gentleman who had been her escort, to 
take up his abode under her roof, for the 
few days, as intimated, he alone proposed 
remaining in the neighbourhood. 

" These few days were devoted by him 
to the purpose of overcoming Miss Court- 
ney's scruples to a clandestine marriage, 
under the old pretext of an avaricious 



25S CONTRAST. 

uncle rendering it impossible for him to 
pay his addresses to her publicly. 

" Miss Courtney had a high sense of 
the duty she owed her father, and knew, 
of course, she was bound not to take any 
step of moment without his sanction ; but 
the insidious arguments of the profligate 
into whose snares she was thrown, over- 
ruled her scruples; and finally she con- 
sented to an elopement to Scotland, leav- 
ing behind her a letter for Mrs. Westford, 
lest of any alarm on missing her â€” the ri- 
gidness of her principles preventing any 
communication to her, of what w^as in 
contemplation. 

" Instead of returning immediately after 
their marriage, sir Osbert proposed their 
continuing a few days in the neighbour- 
hood where it had taken place â€” a proposal 
to which the bride made no objection, on 
obtaining permission to acquaint her fa- 
mily with the event; but the letter com- 
posed for the purpose travelled no farther 
than to the fire in the adjoining apart- 
ment. Sir Osbert, however, had no wish 
to keep her long in ignorance of the cruel 
deception practised on her : a few morn- 



CONTRAST. 253 

ings after her supposed marriage, in reply- 
to some observations respecting the place 
she supposed herself in, she was informed, 
by his instructions, that she was mistaken 
in fancying herself in Scotland, where she 
then was being Cumberland. 

" In extreme agitation, sir Osbert was 
directly sought. Of course, from its now 
suiting him to be candid with her, she 
did not solicit in vain for the explanation 
of what had created such alarm ; but 
to prevent the disagreeableness of reproa- 
ches, he asserted that the imposition 
practised on her w^as entirely the result of 
a wish to secure her hand, or rather give 
himself a right to claim it, lest otherwise, 
when in his power to ask it openly, it 
might be lost to him. 

" But his victim could not be pacified 
by this assertion ; deceit had been prac- 
tised, and nothing could satisfy, or in any 
degree calm, her outraged feelings, but re- 
paration for it, by immediately making her, 
in reality, what shfe had previously con- 
ceived herself to be : but prayers, tears, 
reproaches, were alike unavailing, ad- 
dressed, as they were, to a heart incapable 



254 CONTRAST. 

of just or honourable feelings; besides 
which, his difficulties were such as to 
render a fortune with a wife indispensable. 
Not wishing, however, to utterly exaspe- 
rate at present, lest it should be the means 
of injuring his real views, he affected to 
insinuate, that it was the doubt her re- 
proaches had betrayed of his honour, that 
prevented her supplications being attend- 
ed to; and finally, had her reconveyed to 
Mrs. Westford, with something like an 
intimation, or assurance, that if she acted 
as discretion enjoined, she might yet find 
him not the character now supposed. 

" Mrs. Westford acted her part capi- 
tally, affecting to be all astonishment and 
indignation at the communication made 
her ; then appearing to collect herself, she 
began to take the part of sir Osbert, pro- 
testing that, all circumstances taken into 
consideration, particularly his assurance of 
yet acting honourably, she did not view 
his conduct in the heinous light in which 
it had first appeared. 

" Nothing, however, could excuse his 
conduct to the unhappy Miss Courtney ; 
as the drowning wretch, however, grasps 



CONTRAST. 255 

a straw, she tried to cherish a hope of his 
not ultimately meaning to deceive her. 
But nothing could induce a loncjer ab- 
sence from her family; with a fervent 
wish that she had never left it, she insist- 
ed on an immediate return to them â€” to 
home, that haven of the afflicted, to which 
they instinctively turn, in the hour of wo. 

" Mrs. Westford, supplied by sir Os- 
bert with the means of yet enjoying herself 
a little longer in the scenes she delighted, 
tried to dissuade her from this, but in vain ; 
and, of course, she was obliged to acqui- 
esce in what she considered her ridiculous 
and provoking wish ; but not without ex- 
torting a solemn promise of secrecy, on the 
subject of all that had occurred, by repre- 
senting to her affrighted imagination the 
fatal consequences that might be the re- 
sult of its disclosure, to say nothing of 
the certain ruin its publicity would be to 
the prospects of her sister Celia, from the 
precise and rigid character of Mr. Fortes- 
cue, meaning me. 

" The altered appearance of Miss Court- 
ney failed not to strike her father; but 
imputed to a little too much dissipation.

it excited no alarm ; restored to her usual 
quiet and regularity, the rose would soon 
resume its station on her now-pale cheek, 
he fondly flattered himself, little aware of 
the cankerworm that was preying upon the 
fairest flower of his garden, its prideandjoy. 

" Sir Osbert had a seat in the neigh- 
bourhood of lady Newbury, as I suppose 
your lordship knows ; and under the idea 
that he might then be there. Miss Court- 
ney lost no time, after her return home, 
in writing to her friend. Miss Mountflo- 
rence, who, about the time of her going 
to Sid mouth, had also left Devonshire for 
her ladyship's, concerning him ; mention- 
ing, but under an injunction of secresy, 
that they had met there, and his being 
sufficiently particular, to make her anxious 
to know what kind of character he in 
reality was. 

" The sisterly affection subsisting be- 
tween the young ladies, immediately de- 
termined Miss Mountflorence on endea- 
vouring to ascertain what appeared of such 
importance to her friend. He had return- 
ed to his seat in Berkshire; and as he 
mixed in all the parties in the neighbour?

-hood, she had constant opportunities of 
seeing and conversing with him ; but not 
satisfied with this, not wishing entirely to 
depend on her own judgment, she made 
him so much the theme of conversation, 
was so minute in her inquiries concerning 
him, as at length to create an apprehen- 
sion, as I have been informed, in the mind 
of lady Newbury, of her having conceived 
a more particular interest for him than 
could be wished, and in consequence of 
which, she decided on letting her return 
to Mr. Courtney's." 

" So," cried lord Le Poer, " what then 
appeared so extraordinary to me, is now 
accounted for. But I wish her ladyship 
had been more candid ; I wish, instead of 
persuading me it was owing to Miss 
Mountflorence's express wish, her parting 
with her, after my placing her under her 
care, till I chose to take her over to Ire- 
land, she had been ingenuous as to the 
real cause ; since, as far as I can now see, or 
conjecture, it would have been the means 
of preventing a great deal of mischief" 

" And I too," exclaimed Horatio, " can 
now perceive to what her embarrassment 



258 CONTRAST. 

was owing, when I asked her the ques- 
tion, why Miss Mountflorence was not 
still with her ? But surely," he cried, to 
himself, " I am not going to hear that 
Adelaide is attached to this miscreant ! 
Yet no; did she not assure me, that he 
whom she loved was undeserving of any 
unworthy appellation ? But what blind- 
ness does not the infatuation of love occa- 
sion ! Yet, if her friend Sophia was can- 
did in her confession " and he walked 

about the room, in a manner indicative of 
some little emotion in the inner man. 

" Proceed, sir," said his lordship, to Mr. 
Fortescue, and in a tone meant to call the 
greatly-discomposed Horatio to order, and 
which had so far the effect as to make him 
throw himself again upon the sofa he had 
involuntarily started from.

" But oars alone can ne'er prevail 

To reach the distant coast ; 
The breath of heav'n must swell the sail, 

Or all the toil is lost." 

" But lady Newbury," resumed Mr. For- 
tescue, " was not the only person led to 
believe a growing preference, on the part 
of Miss Mountflorence ; for sir Osbert's 
egregious vanity shortly betrayed the 
gentleman himself into the indulgence of 
a similar idea ; and he was, in consequence, 
much mortified at the sudden departure 
of the young lady ; it is true, he knew of 
her and his hapless victim being consider- 
ed in the light of sisters ; but if she over- 
looked the circumstance, it was not for 
him to attend to it. 

" Miss Mountflorence, with studied 
carelessness, had, from time to time, intro- 
duced tha mention of Sophia's name ; but 
be was too much on his guard to allow 



260 CONTRAST. 

himself to manifest any kind of emotion 
at hearing it, and from this Miss Mount- 
florence was led to conclude he had al- 
ready ceased to think of her friend â€” a 
conclusion that did not by any means tend 
to his advantage, convinced as she was, 
that he must have professed a great deal, 
to have induced her to mention him in 
the terms she had done; and altogether 
she would have been extremely unhappy 
at the thought of her attachment, but for 
her hope of possessing sufficient strength 
of mind to enable her to overcome it, 
when assured of the unworthiness of the 
object ; she had yet to learn the fatal cir- 
cumstance that must interpose to prevent 
an effort for the purpose. But she was not 
much longer permitted to remain in igno- 
rance of this â€” the bursting heart of the 
unhappy Miss Courtney required the con- 
solation of confiding its sorrows to some 
one; and hardly had her amiable friend 
returned, ere all was revealed to her, that 
she had hitherto so carefully concealed. 

" Miss Mountflorence listened to her 
sad story, not merely with surprise and 
sorrow, but absolute horror, from a conÂ« 



CONTRAST. 261 

viction of her having been a victim to the 
foulest treachery : the real character of 
Mrs. Westford was now evident â€” every 
circumstance made against her; and the 
cool effrontery, the deriding insolence, 
wdth which she bore the reproaches that 
could not be suppressed, confirmed every 
surmise to her prejudice." 

" Good God ! and to confide her to the 
care of such a woman !" cried lord L6 
Poer, in no slight agitation of spirits. 
" But I beg pardon, sir ; don't let me in- 
terrupt you. Yet, if you knew all !" 

" When at length Miss Mountflorence 
had a little recovered herself from the 
shock sustained, through the communica- 
tion of her unfortunate friend, she began, 
from the natural innocence and inexperi- 
ence of youth, to consider whether, un- 
principled as sir Osbert had evinced him- 
self, he might not still, if properly remon- 
strated with, on the subject of his conduct, 
be induced to make reparation for it. He 
knew not perhaps the real v/orth, the high 
respectability of her he had wronged : the 
very circumstance of seeing her under the 
protection of such a woman as Mrs. West- 



262 CONTRAST. 

ford, might have been an injury to her 4 
but to whom could the story of Sophia's 
wrongs be revealed ? to whom, but to 
herself, could they be entrusted with safe- 
ty ? and on her, therefore, must devolve the 
attempt she deemed it but right to make. 
Once decided on this, it was not long 
delayed. But hardly had she commenced 
her letter, ere the mischief that might ac- 
crue, from committing the name of the in- 
jured party to paper, made her pause, and 
finally change what she had intended say- 
ing, into a simple request to sir Osbert, to 
let her see him, if possible, immediately in 
Devonshire." 

" Heavens and earth !" exclaimed lord 
Le Poer, starting from his chair, " what a 
request to make ! â€” what a letter to write, 
to a man of his character ! In fearing to 
commit her friend, had the rash, the incon- 
siderate girl, no apprehension of commit- 
ting herself?" 

" In asking those questions," replied 
Mr. Fortescue, " we must not lose sight 
of the feelings that hurried her into the 
indiscretion she was certainly guilty of; 
but in the ardour of friendship, she lost 



CONTRAST. 263 

sight of prudence â€” in anxiety for a per- 
son, regarded as a sister, self was utterly 
forgotten." 

" Ah, this is all very fine !" cried his 
lordship; " but this is not the way in 
which an invidious world would argue on 
the circumstance : and I am astonished ! 
I am enraged ! but go on, sir â€” I am im- 
patient, although I think, I may be cer- 
tain, I shall hear nothing further but what 
will still more irritate me." 

Mr. Fortescue, smiling in a peculiar 
manner, obeyed him. â€” " The gentleman 
did not hesitate accepting what, no doubt, 
he construed, in the first instance, into a 
very flattering invitation. As desired, on 
his arrival in the neighbourhood, he dis- 
patched a note to acquaint her with the 
circumstance ; but whatever was the con- 
struction put upon her letter, hardly had 
they met, ere the repelling coldness of her 
looks, severe even in youthful beauty, con- 
vinced him that, with respect to her, he 
was out in his calculations : what a shock 
to his vanity ! but he would not be so dis- 
appointed â€” he would not, even to him- 
self, be rendered a subject for ridicule and 



264 CONTRAST. 

derision ; and instead of insolently plead- 
ing for another, she should yet have cause 
to plead for herself." 

" Miscreant !" cried De Montville, in a 
transport of indignation, that rendered 
him nearly beside himself at the moment; 
" but he shall not escape the punishment 
due to his audacity, as well as baseness !" 

" No, of that there is little danger," said 
Mr. Fortescue, composedly ; " in some way 
or other, we all generally meet with the 
flagellation we merit : and so, to proceed, 
with this determination, he saw the 
necessity of dissembling, and according- 
ly, after a few pretended struggles with 
himself, he affected to be moved by her 
arguments for her friend ; and finally con- 
cluded by declaring, that, in the course of 
the ensuing week, he would return to do 
her that justice that was required. At the 
time expected, another letter was received 
by Miss Mountflorence from him, entreat- 
ing to see her by herself, having some mat- 
ters to submit to the consideration of her 
friend, ere they met, which he wished to 
make her the medium of laying before her. 
The request was complied with, and " 



CONTRAST. 265 

" Thus the infatuated girl rushed into 
the snare that was spread for her!" ex- 
claimed lord Le Peer, again starting up, 
and traversing the apartment in uncon- 
trollable em.otion. 

" Yet how could she suspect such deep- 
laid villany?" said Mr. Fortescue â€” " how 

that he would have dared But certainly 

his conduct was, in a degree, imputable to 
his not exactly knowing the protection 
she could claim. Every thing was so well 
arranged, that he found no difficulty in 
getting her into his power." 

" Then he did actually succeed in get- 
ting her into his power ?" cried De Mont- 
ville, in a voice hardly articulate through 
emotion. 

Mr. Fortescue replied by a slight incli- 
nation of his head, and thus went on â€” 
" Her long absence from home was just 
beginning to create an alarm, when ^Nlrs. 
Westford, again the confidant and base 
abettor of his designs, made her appear- 
ance, with Miss Mountflorence's unfortu- 
nate letter, picked up, as she pretended, 
in the vvay. 

VOL. II. N 



266 CONTRAST. 

" I need hardly say the purpose for which 
it was produced, that of giving to her dis- 
appearance the colour of a voluntary elope- 
ment. Loving her with paternal tender- 
ness, what the shock of Mr. Courtney was, 
may easily be imagined : he lost no time, 
on recovering from it, in dispatching a 
letter to major Mountflorence, acquainting 
him with what had happened, and entreat- 
ing his advice. This was answered in per- 
son ; and some clue having, by this time, 
been obtained, major Mountflorence pro- 
ceeded, almost directly after his arrival, in 
â€¢pursuit of his fair relative. 

" All this time the wretched Sophia was 
experiencing that intense anguish, which 
a generous mind must ever endure, at the 
thought of being the cause of injury to 
others. Yet torn as was her heart with 
remorse at the idea, she knew not how to 
enter upon the vindication of her injured 
friend, lest of involving others, still nearer, 
though perhaps not dearer to her, in irre- 
mediable misery. From all she under- 
stood of my character, she persuaded her- 
self, that if the affair transpired, there 
would be an end of her sister Celia's hopes 



CONTRAST. 267 

of an alliance with my family; and, accord- 
ingly, after a hard struggle between her 
sense of what was due to her friend, and 
her affection for her sister, decided, if pos- 
sible, on letting matters remain as they 
were, until the marriage of the latter had 
taken place. 

" Naturally concluding that her friend's 
first impulse, on seeing her kinsman, would 
be to enter upon her vindication to him, 
at the moment he was quitting the house, 
she put a letter into his hand for Miss 
Mountflorence, with an entreaty that he 
would permit her perusal of it, previous 
to any conversation with her. The pur- 
port of this was to implore her friend to 
refrain, yet a while, from entering into ex- 
planation concerning the letter that made 
so much against her, by representing the 
extreme improbability there was, if once 
apprized of the truth, of major Mountflo- 
rence allowing her to rest another minute 
under the imputation she had incurred, 
and the certain disappointment that, in 
that case, awaited her sister^s hopes. 

" You will say, that this was not a 

N a 



268 CONTRAST. 

natural request ; that it was one, one can 
hardly allow themselves to believe could 
ever have been thought of being made, 
from its requiring a stretch of very im- 
probable generosity. I acknowledge all 
this ; but she knew to whom she was ad- 
dressing herself â€” she knew the heart of 
her friend ; she knew, she acknowledged 
obhgations to her family, that would in- 
duce her to go every possible length to 
save them from un happiness, and she was 
not disappointed in her expectation." 

Lord Le Poer again rose, and traversed 
the apartment, in extreme agitation. â€” " I 
now begin to comprehend all," he said; 
" and this generous, though certainly ro- 
mantic, creature â€” romantic, in risking her 
own happiness for that of others, I flung 
from my cold bosom, as unworthy of 
being taken to it !" He resumed his seat, 
and leaning his head against the back of 
the chair, motioned for Mr. Fortescue to 
proceed. 

" Minute details are not requisite. Ma- 
jor Mountflorence's pursuit was crowned 
with success, but not before Miss Mount- 
florence had succeeded in extricating her- 



CONTRAST. 269 

self from the snare into which the zeal of 
friendship, and the natural inconsiderate- 
ness of youth, had hurried her. How tri- 
umphant would now have been her return 
to Mr. Courtney's, but for the restrictions 
imposed ! But, however generously dis- 
posed she imagined major Mountflorence, 
she could not, for a moment, allow herself 
to suppose he would, from the nearness of 
their affinity, permit her to rest under a 
slur she could vindicate herself from ; and 
she accordingly decided on compliance 
with the request of her unfortunate friend, 
by maintaining, for the present, inflex- 
ible silence on the subject of the letter, 
lest, otherwise, the fair prospects of Celia 
should be disappointed, a circumstance 
that she was convinced would be a death- 
blow to the happiness of her family. This 
was the first opportunity, she conceived, 
afforded for evincing her gratitude for ob- 
ligations she deemed unreturnable ; yet, 
to a mind sensitive, delicate, like hers, it 
w^as a hard trial to remain any time un- 
vindicated, such as nothing but a sense of 
gratitude could have enabled her to endure. 
" Mr. Courtney rejoiced at her being 



270 CONTRAST. 

brought back ; yet, at the same time, receiv- 
ed her with coldness and reserve. Abash- 
ed, confounded, by the unworthy treat- 
ment to which she saw she had subjected 
her, Miss Courtney only waited until they 
were alone, to implore her forgiveness, in a 
suppliant attitude, for it. The generous 
Adelaide, kneeling beside her, eased her 
declining head upon her breast, and spoke 
the words of peace to her distracted soul, 
by promising never to enter into any ex- 
planation of what had occurred, till, at 
least, after the marriage of Celia, without 
her express permission." 

" Rash, romantic girl !" again exclaim- 
ed lord Le Poer, " what pain, what per- 
plexity, has not this inconsiderate promise 
been the cause of!" 

" Yet, had she acted otherwise, would 
not what .she most dreaded have been the 
result? I ask you, my lord," proceeded 
Mr. Fortescue, " if apprized of the truth, 
whether you would not, at once, have in- 
sisted on its being disclosed to others? 
and in which case, I do assure you, there 
would have been very little chance of my 
permitting the much-desired marriage to 



CONTRAST. 271 

take place, on which so materially depend- 
ed the happiness of the Courtney family. 

" Miss JNIountflorence was,, soon after 
this, taken over to Ireland by your lord- 
ship. About this time, too, my son re- 
turned from an extended tour on the Con- 
tinent; but still no preparations were 
commenced for his marriage, as I con- 
ceived it quite time enough yet for it 
to take place. But what the anxiety of 
Miss Courtney for it was, may be con- 
ceived, more especially, on learning that 
the restrictions imposed upon her generous 
friend had been the means of involving 
her in the most embarrassing dilemmas. 
At length, a letter from Wales threw her 
into a state of absolute despair, such as, 
at length, led her to form what she consi- 
dered the desperate resolve of communi- 
cating to me what she had hitherto been 
so anxious to keep from my knowledge, 
unable to endure the thought of her 
friend's happiness being completely risked 
through her means. What my surprise 
was, on her prefacing her communication 
to me, by declaring, that on me depended 
the sole chance she had of ever enjoying 



272 CONTRAST. 

any thing like tranquillity again, may be 
imagined ! but surprise was not the only 
feeling I experienced, as I continued to 
listen to her : even if I could have with- 
held my pity from her, betrayed, as I 
clearly saw she was, by the foulest trea- 
cher}^ to shame and sorrow, still I could 
not deny my admiration to her young and 
generous friend, so nobly enduring re- 
proach, and bearing contumel3% for her 
sake, or rather, in what she considered the 
discharge of a debt of sacred gratitude. 

" Such indeed was that which her conduct 
inspired, that, for the sake of recompensing 
it, I do believe I could not have hesitated 
about the desired marriage, even though I 
had been able to view the unfortunate So- 
phia in any other light than that of a 
wronged creature, more sinned against 
than sinning. In a word, notwithstand- 
ing my real and imputed fastidiousness, I 
could not refrain from quickly relieving 
the unhappy girl from the apprehensions 
under which she laboured. Preparations 
immediately commenced for the long-con- 
templated event, and as soon as it had 
taken place, I decided on being myself the 



CONTRAST. 273 

person to communicate the circumstance 
to Miss Mountflorence. Knowing what 
Mrs. Westford was, you may, perhaps, feel 
surprised, or rather, indignant, that an im- 
mediate effort w^as not made to rescue her 
from her power; but, in the first place, 
Miss Courtney dreaded any hasty measure, 
lest of its leading to disclosures that might 
involve the safety of her father or her bro- 
ther, a fine, spirited lad, just about this 
time expected home from the East In- 
dies ; and in the next, unprincipled as she 
knew this vile w^oman to be, still she did 
not imagine she would dare to form any 
plot against a person connected and pro- 
tected as Miss Mountflorence was. 

" Directly after the ceremony, the new- 
married couple set out for the Continent, 
and I for Wales; but in my w^ay, I met 
with an accident, which had nearly proved 
fatal, and necessarily occasioned a delay, 
that, from what I gathered on reaching 
my destination, I must continue to regret, 
should I not be happy enough to hear 
that Miss Mountflorence is now with her 
friends.

274 CONTRAST. 

" I found only an old Welshman and 
his wife in the castle, from whom I re- 
ceived a confused account of Miss Mount- 
florence having suddenly disappeared, 
owing, it was supposed, to some persecu- 
tion she had undergone, about marrying a 
person she disliked ; and of Mrs. West- 
ford, with this said person, a Mr. Madoc, 
and his sister, having shortly after de- 
parted. On finding the bird flown I 
hoped to have had the pleasure of liberat- 
ing myself, I immediately bent my steps 
hither, trusting I should find her here, in 
the safe protection of her friends." 

Lord Le Poer struck his forehead in 
despair. This was a protection she might 
never again be under ! What had become 
of her? â€” had she really effected her es- 
cape from the castle? or was her disap- 
pearance owing to her being ensnared in 
some other way, by Mrs. Westford ? He 
had wished he might never hear more of 
her, and, to his everlasting sorrow, the 
wish might be granted. In short, the 
flinty rock was at length struck, and his 
heart overflowed with paternal tenderness. 
He could not think of the patience with 



CONTRAST. 275 

which she had submitted to reproach â€” 
the meekness with which she had borne 
severity â€” the firmness with which she had 
maintained her promise, spite of the temp- 
tations to break it, without a feeUng of 
admiration and delight, that would have 
made him clasp her to his heart with pride, 
at the moment, had he had the power. 
But did he merit the happiness of having 
her restored to him, for how had he 
treated her? But then, were not appear- 
ances against her ? But could he acquit 
himself of coldness^ â€” of severity towards 
her, ere there appeared any cause for 
blame ? Had not his conduct, from the 
first moment, been such as to induce a be- 
lief of his acknowledgment of her being 
compulsory, and that whatever were the 
claims he was compelled to allow, those of 
nature were out of the question ? 

Tortured with remorse, the wrongs of 
others were now avenged. What would 
he not have given that he could have re- 
called the past, so terrible was the reflec- 
tion of the cruel selfishness that had ren- 
dered the feelings of others of no moment 
to him ! to this all the sufferings of her 



276 CONTRAST. 

unfortunate mother were owing; to this 
the implacable resentment that would not 
permit him to overlook or pardon any- 
thing injurious to himself. 

Mr. Fortescue, aware that he could not 
possibly sooth his discomposure, speedily 
took his leave, with a request, that if, in 
any way, he could be serviceable, he might 
be commanded. 

De Montville would not permit himself 
to doubt Adelaide's soon being traced ; it 
need not be said, his joy at her perfect 
exculpation â€” at her being proved the ami- 
able creature she had always appeared: 
but amidst all Mr. Fortescue had explain- 
ed, he wished, if indeed in his power, he 
had explained to whom she was attached : 
not to sir Osbert, of course, for, from all 
that was detailed, it was to be inferred, 
that he was an object of detestation to her; 
and besides, in acknowledging herself at- 
tached, she had avowed the object of her 
attachment to be a person of unblemished 
reputation. But time would develop ; 
the altered manner of her father would 
win her confidence, if any disparity of 



CONTRAST. 277 

rank or fortune occasioned hesitation about 
the name of him she loved. 

With such a heart, such feelings, what 
must ehe have suffered at lord Le Poer's 
original project ! Was it to be believed 
she would ever have acquiesced in it ? 
Assuredly not, notwithstanding what she 
intimated to the contrary. But this was 
only to gain time â€” only for the sake of 
temporizing, or who could tell, from a fear 
of driving him â€” that is himself â€” to despair, 
if she too suddenly disappointed his ex- 
pectations. Despair ! oh, not quite so bad 
as that either ! Yet really he could hardly 
wonder if she thought so, when he reflect- 
ed on his ridiculous speeches, and his sud- 
den freaks of jealousy. But perhaps, all 
lovely and captivating as she was, he might 
yet be able to convince her, existence could 
be borne without her. Not that, for the 
world, he would have her suppose his 
pride was piqued; but still he did not 
like to be put down as a disappointed 
suitor. 

The next day he set out for Wales with 
lord Le Poer: in their way they took 
Devonshire, for the purpose of making in- 



278 CONTRAST. 

quiries after Mrs. Westford ; Mr. Fortes- 
cue having arrived before them, aided 
them in these ; but they were unsuccessful 
in enabHng them to trace her : all they 
could learn was but a repetition of what 
they had already learnt, namely, her being 
gone to the Continent, owing, they made 
no doubt, to some sudden alarm. 

Disappointed with regard to her, they 
then endeavoured to learn something more 
particular concerning her supposed com- 
panion; but here too their inquiries were 
of no avail. At length, by persevering in 
them, they learnt the name of his wife's mo- 
ther, and that it was imagined she had been 
lately concealed in the vicinity of the 
castle; but whither then gone, no one 
could surmise. This was most provoking, 
since from her they conceived it probable 
information might be obtained, that might 
furnish them with a clue to trace her they 
were so interested about. 

At last they succeeded in obtaining the 
name of a clergyman, said to be an inti- 
mate friend of Mrs. Mowbray's ; and for 
his dwelling, in another part of the prin- 
cipality, they lost no time in departing.

'â€¢ You cannot bid ray daughter live again â€” 
That were impossible ; but, I pray, 
Possess the people 

How inuocent she died : and if your love 
Can labour aught in sad invention. 
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb. 
And sing it to her bones." 

O'er many a hill and dale the travellers 
had to proceed ; but though one in parti- 
cular had a taste for the picturesque, too 
deep an interest engrossed both at the mo- 
ment, to permit any remark but on the 
length of the way ; but, as has been saga- 
ciously observed, as the longest lane will 
have a turn, and the longest journey 
come to a close, so, at length, they reached 

the pleasant little town of , where 

the reverend Mr. Floyd resided, then all 
alive with company, it being again the sea- 
bathing season. 

De Montville immediately dispatched 
a note, requesting to know when it would 
be convenient to him to see them : but he 



280 CONTRAST. 

had dined out ; on hearing which, of course, 
all hope of having any communication 
with him until the next day was relin- 
quished. It was evening when they arri- 
ved; soon after he had taken his coffee, 
lord Le Poer sat down to write to Ireland ; 
and De Montville, left to himself, strolled 
out. There was a ball that evening at 
the rooms, and the high street, through 
which he was passing, was in consequence 
all in a bustle â€” friseurs, dress-makers, 
and footmen loaded with presents of fra- 
grant bouquets, posting in every direc- 
tion, while many a fair face was seen 
slyly peeping from behind the white cur- 
tain of a dressing-room, to look for new 
arrivals; and here and there parties of 
officers, arm-in-arm, belonging to the ca- 
valry regiment quartered in the town, were 
observed loitering carelessly along, as if to 
tantalize the fair expectants, by creating a 
doubt of their intention of being present. 

De Montville, as he passed along, could 
hardly suppress a smile at the coxcombry: 
he soon gained the skirts of the town, and 
found himself leaving all its noise and 
bustle behind him. After proceeding some 



CONTRAST. 281 

way, along a beautiful shady lane, through 
the thickly interlaced trees of which the 
setting sun here and there shot a golden 
gleam athwart his path, he came to a lonely 
churchyard, almost close to a stony moun- 
tain, where a few scattered sheep were pick- 
ing up the scanty herbage. Not a habitation 
was in sight, and with tliis cold bleak moun- 
tain pressing upon it, there was something 
peculiarly wild and solitary in the aspect of 
the place. De Montville was in a gloomy 
humour, and mounting over the stile, he 
made his way through the elder bushes, 
that grew in luxuriant quantities in the 
place, and found that the church belonging 
to it was a very ancient one, and partially 
in ruins : the ivy mantles of the dead walls 
w^ere gently rustHng in the evening breeze, 
and all was calculated to dispose the mind 
to pensiveness and melancholy. As De 
Montville kept sauntering on amidst the 
grassy hillocks, strewed by the hand of 
tender recollection with fresh flowerets of 
the season, and where " many a holy text 
and uncouth rhyme, implored the passing 
tribute of a sigh," his eye was caught by a 
white flag, inscribed with the initials 



282 CONTRAST. 

" A. M., lately deceased, aged nineteen ." 
He became alarmed â€” the initials, the age, 
were those of Adelaide: Mrs. Mowbray 
was supposed to have been in the vicinity 
of the castle at the time she was there, and 
he looked round him in agony for some 
one to relieve him from the dread which 
had seized him, feeling as if it were impos- 
sible to quit the spot, in the torturing in- 
certitude he was in. At last, he saw a 
countryman crossing to the road, and, call- 
ing to him, he proceeded to make those 
inquiries which lie was so anxious to put, 
yet, at the same time, so almost afraid to 
have answered. 

The man replied to his agitated ques- 
tions, by informing him, that the person 
by whose grave he was standing, was a 
young female, who had lately come into 
the neighbourhood with a widow lady, 
known to the clergyman of the place, but 
hardly to any one else beside. 

This was enough to hear; De Mont- 
ville became confirmed in his apprehen- 
sions, and waving the man to quit him, 
he resigned himself to despair. His very 
soul seemed dissolving within him, as he 



CONTRAST. 283 

bent over the supposed grave of her he 
lamented ; and thought of what she was, 
and what she had so recently been : but 
a few months back, and how lovely in 
youthful bloom ! how brilliant, how spark- 
ling, how innocently gay, with her little 
contrivances to teaze and perplex him ! 
and now, cold, silent, forgotten ! Oh, 
no ! she was not â€” that she could never be 
â€” never could her sweet image be effaced 
from his fancy ! while life remained, his 
heart must fondly cherish her memory ! 
But to what was her early death owing? 
was it faithless love, or parental severity, 
or the terrors to which this severity had 
subjected her, that had hurried her to an 
early grave? But what mattered it now 
to know whether it was disappointment, 
or unkindness, or varied suffering, that had 
pressed so heavily upon this gentle heart ? 
no atonement, no reparation could now be 
made â€” her youthful spirit had passed 
away, in purity and innocence, to happier 
realms, where, enskied and sainted, she 
was beyond the farther touch of joy or 
woe. Yet he felt he could not rest till 
he had ascertained the cause of her death ; 



284 CONTRAST. 

and he now deplored having allowed his 
feelings so to overcome him, as not to in- 
quire where Mrs. Mowbray lived ; but it 
was probable at the inn they would be 
able to inform him; and thither he accord- 
ingly forced himself to return, decided on 
keeping lord Le Poer in ignorance of what 
had happened till he had seen this lady. 

The innkeeper acquainted him with the 
residence of Mrs. Mowbray ; but this was 
not sufficient â€” he continued questioning 
him as to other particulars, till startled by 
a sudden exclamation from lord Le Poer, 
who unperceived had approached, and 
overheard sufficient to make him share in 
the torturing apprehension that had been 
suggested. 

As soon as the shock sustained by the 
circumstance was a little got the better of, 
he insisted on accompanying him imme- 
diately to Mrs. Mowbray's. A boy from 
the inn was their guide to the sequestered 
spot where she resided, at the extremity 
of a delightful meadow, out of the way 
of any public road, and on the margin of 
a romantic stream, just where it dashed 
over some opposing rocks, overrun with 



CONTRAST. 285 

fern, and ivy, and tufting lichens ; while 
on the opposite side, deep dark woods 
shrouded the ruins of an ancient castle, on 
whose time-struck battlements the moping 
owl still held her nocturnal viorils : an en- 
closed shrubbery screened the building 
from immediate view, on winding through 
which an elegant cottage met the eye â€” 
just such a retreat as sorrow or romance 
might be supposed to delight in, lowly, 
and perfectly secluded, but still not con- 
fined in prospect, and on which the hand 
of taste had evidently been exercised. 
The French windows opened upon a fairy 
lawn; the walls were completely mantled 
over with beautiful creepers ; and in every 
direction, beds of flowers and delicious 
exotics scented the evening air with their 
exhaling sweets. 

As they approached, the sound of a 
harp was distinguished. De Montville, 
wishing to discover who was playing, ad- 
vanced a little in front of the house, but 
only succeeded in catching a glimpse of a 
female drawing out of sight. 

They sent in their names by a rustic 
servant-girl : after a good deal of delay, 



286 CONTRAST. 

and it seemed to them also of bustle, she 
returned to say, that her mistress had 
been suddenly taken ill ; but, nevertheless, 
desired them to walk in, under the hope 
that she might be sufficiently recovered, 
in a few minutes, to see them. 

The anxiety they were under did not 
permit them to refuse, as otherwise, from 
such a message, they might have done. 
They were ushered into a room, furnished 
to correspond with the exterior of the 
building, and where the harp stood they 
had heard so sweetly touched. 

The eyes of De Montville rambled 
round the apartment, as if he expected to 
have found within it some memento, some 
memorial, of the loved Adelaide. He 
seated himself at a window, and as he 
gazed on the dark woods, and listened to 
the melancholy splash of the water, and 
the wailings of the night birds in the 
ruins â€” '* How often," he thought, " per- 
haps had she occupied the same seat, look- 
ing at, and listening to, the same objects 
and sounds; and, in bitterness of soul, 
dwelling on the mournful fate that had 
abandoned her to the care of strangers ! 



CONTRAST. 287 

Why had she been so romantically faith- 
ful ? why not, in him at least, have re- 
posed confidence? Yet could he posi- 
tively declare to himself, that he would 
have been faithful to that confidence? 
that pride, that anxiety for her, would 
not have rendered him regardless of every 
thing but what she was immediately con- 
cerned in ? And lord Le Poer, was he 
not convinced that a hint of the truth to 
him would have rendered any effort to 
longer conceal it impossible ?" 

While he sat musing, he fancied a deep 
sob, from time to time, in the adjoining 
room. Could it be that the grief of Mrs. 
Mowbray for her young companion, was 
renewed by this visit ? At length she ap- 
peared, attired in deep mourning. De 
Montville looked earnestly at her, but 
^\dthout perceiving any traces of tears on 
her cheek ; instead, there was a kind of 
hectic glow on it, indicative of great 
emotion ; and this her manner in address- 
ing her visitors evinced, although she had 
the appearance of a person naturally col- 
lected. 

Lord Le Poer instantly entered upon 



288 CONTRAST. 

the purport of his visit : it was his inten- 
tion, he said, to have introduced himself 
to her through the medium of her friend, ' 
Mr. Floyd ; but the distressing discovery 
that had taken place since his arrival, ren- 
dered it impossible for him to control his 
impatience for an interview ; and he pro- 
ceeded to mention the occurrence in the 
churchyard, concluding by a request to 
learn all the particulars of the death of 
her, the unexpected sight of whose grave 
had been such a shock to the feelings of 
his young friend. 

Mrs. Mowbray, whose agitation had 
evidently been increasing every moment, 
now burst into a flood of tears, and turn- 
ing aside her head, seemed utterly unable 
to speak for a few minutes; then, half with- 
drawing the handkerchief from her face, 
she entreated him to spare her that night, 
the pain of entering upon the afflicting 
subject, assuring him the next day he 
should either hear from her, or see her 
friend, Mr. Floyd ; and again covering 
her face, she appeared abandoning herself 
to the deepest sorrow. 

While she was speaking, De Montville 



CONTRAST. 289 

imagined he heard a repetition of the sobs 
that he before thought he had heard in the 
adjoining room ; and he now recollected, 
that the person he had seen shrinking 
back out of sight, on his approach to the 
window, was in white. As he mused on 
the circumstance, wondering who the com- 
panion of Mrs. Mowbray could be, that 
so evidently participated in her feelings at 
the moment, he suddenly recollected her 
daughter, with a feeling of surprise that 
she had not before occurred to his recollec- 
tion. 

After Mrs. Mowbray's request, the gen- 
tlemen could not think of a longer intru- 
sion on her ; they departed, in the deepest 
affliction at the sad termination of all fur- 
ther anxiety about Adelaide. 

As they were sitting at their melan- 
choly breakfast the next morning, Mr. 
Floyd was announced, an elderly, pleasing- 
looking man, of mild and interesting man- 
ners. 

liOrd Le Poer wished to command him- 
self; but the effort was unavailing â€” tears 
gushed from him â€” " You must not wonÂ« 

VOL. II. o 



290 CONTRAST. 

der, sir," he said, in a struggling voice, ad^ 
dressing his visitor, " at those tears â€” they 
are the tears of an unhappy father, for his 
only child â€” a child whose worth he knew 
not how to estimate, till too late to recom- 
pense it !" 

Mr. Floyd attempted to say something, 
but he got confused, and suddenly rising, 
said, he had an indispensable engagement, 
which obliged his immediate departure ; 
but he proposed returning â€” " When I shall 
hope," he added, " to see your lordship 
niore composed, and, of course, better able 
to listen to what I have to communicate." 

" Extraordinary enough this !" thought 
De Montville. " Why, if not in his 
power at once to communicate the parti- 
culars required, had he called till it was ? 
'Tis really teasing and tantalizing people ;" 
and he was gravely opening the door for 
him, when a sudden glance produced a 
kind of electrifying effect upon his feel- 
ings, and made him hastily follow him 
down stairs. 

Mr. Floyd led the way to an old-fashion- 
ed garden, out of sight of the apartment 
occupied by lord Le Poer â€” " I feared I 



CONTRAST. 291 

should not have caught your eye," he said, 
addressing De Montville, " and I wished, 
most particularly, to have some conversa- 
tion with you, before I entered into any 
explanation with his lordship. Allow me 
to ask, yet I am aware the question will 
appear strange and abrupt, but I promised 
to ask it, the motive for endeavouring to 
trace the young companion of my friend ?" 

" The motive !" repeated De Montville, 
with some surprise ; " why are you not 
aware, sir, of the connexion that subsisted 
between her and lord Le Poer ?" 

" Oh, yes, perfectly. But still in 

short, to be explicit, was it for the pui'pose 
of again depriving her of libertyâ€” of giving 
her back into the power of an unprincipled 
woman, such efforts were made to disco- 
ver her?" 

De Montville eagerly replied in the ne- 
gative; and proceeded, without hesitation, 
to give all those particulars that had occa- 
sioned such a revolution in lord Le Poer's 
feelings concerning her. 

His auditor listened with the most pro- 
found attention to him. When he had 
o 2 



292 CONTRAST. 

concluded â€” " How I do rejoice," he said, 
" at what you have informed me !" 

" Alas !" cried De Montville, " I know 
not well how that word can be used here I 
Was she indeed, who was so deeply inte- 
rested in what I have communicated, 
alive, to reap the benefit of her exculpa- 
tion, one might rejoice ; but as it is, the 
idea of it must now, I think, be always 
productive of melancholy." 

Mr. Floyd walked on, apparently great- 
ly discomposed. â€” " This is really," he said, 
rubbing his forehead, " a very strange, 
perplexing, out-of-the-way kind of affair ! 

And you " and he hesitated a good 

deal â€” " you heard nothing of the supposed 
death of the young lady, until you found 
yourself by her grave, as you imagined ?" 

" Imagined !" repeated De Montville â€” 
" good God, how you have agitated me by 
that expression ! Can it be that I have 
been mistaken ? But no, no â€” Mrs. Mow- 
bray did not deny her death ! and then 
the initials on the gravestone !" 

" Pray try to compose yourself," said 
Mr. Floyd: " Mrs. Mowbray had a 
daughter," 



CONTRAST. 29s 

** Had !" emphatically repeated De Mont- 
ville. 

" I entreat," cried Mr. Floyd, " that you 
endeavour to command yourselfâ€” you real- 
ly quite distress !" 

" Don't, don't mind me," said De Mont- 
ville. 

" Well, she had a daughter, whose in- 
itials were the same as those of yours 
but really I hardly know how to proceed, 
you seem so overpowered." 

" You have said enough to rescue me 
from despair," said De Montville ; " nor 
can you wonder, surely, at the sudden 
transition from it to joy, affecting me as 
it does ! But how did it come to pass ? â€” 
pardon the expression â€” but how was it, 
that Mrs. Mowbray could be so cruel, as 
to let us continue under so afflicting a 
mistake, a minute longer than could be 
avoided ?" 

" In all that she did, or intended," said 
Mr. Floyd, " Mrs. Mowbray was actuated 
by the purest motivesâ€” disinterested regard 
for your young relative." 

" I am to infer," said De Montville, 



294 CONTRAST. 

" that it was through her means Adelaide 
effected her escape from Madoc Castle ?" 

Mr. Floyd signified that it was, by a 
nod, and then proceeded to detail particu- 
lars. After stating what she had suffered, 
through her daughter's marriage with Ma- 
doc, and the measure to which she was 
driven, on her account, he represented her 
having taken up her abode in the castle, 
to be owing to his suggestion as well as 
her own. 

" Many years ago," he said, " while a 
house, attached to a small living I obtain- 
ed in the neighbourhood, was fitting up 
for me, I became the occupant of the cas- 
tle, and during that time, discovered apart- 
ments in it, of which there had previously 
been no knowledge, and even to this hour, 
unknown to the real proprietor; though in 
the course of a visit paid by Mrs. Mow- 
bray, while I was a tenant, revealed to her, 
from knowing she was of a romantic turn. 

" On learning the necessity there was 
for her concealing herself, it at once struck 
me, that she could not possibly find any 
place better adapted for the purpose than 
these, more especially as either I, or else 



CONTRAST. 295 

some one belonging to me, on whom she 
could equally depend, would always be at 
hand, to aid and assist her, or in other 
words, render her the services she requir- 
ed, my antiquarian researches having also 
enabled me to discover a secret mode of 
entering the castle. 

" From what has occurred, I need 
scarcely say she took advantage of her 
concealment, to possess herself of the se- 
crets of her unprincipled son-in-law and 
his vile confederate : on learning their plan 
respecting Miss Mountflorence, I wished 
at once to have stepped forward, but check- 
ed the impulse, lest of measures being pro- 
voked, by my interference in the business, 
that might have been attended with fatal 
consequences to the unfortunate Mrs Ma- 
doc ; and accordingly left to Mrs. Mowbray, 
ingenious in contrivances, the protection 
of innocence. 

" The mode devised for the deliverance 
of Miss Mountflorence was adopted by the 
necessity she conceived she was under of 
the greatest caution, lest, otherwise, her 
humanity should be the occasion of fur- 
ther sufferings to her unhappy daughter. 



296 CONTRAST. 

Deeply interested about her, she could not 
endure the idea of losing sight of her, till 
assured of her safety ; accordingly the per- 
son who conveyed her from the castle was 
instructed to be her unknown attendant, 
that in case any thing unpleasant occur- 
red, she might be conveyed to my protec- 
tion, would she accept it." 

" How good, how kind, this watchful 
care over her !" cried De Montville, " and 
how much must my heart, and the heart 
of her father, ever thank you for it !" 

" Just about the time of her being re- 
conveyed back, Mrs. Westford and her 
friend, doubtless alarmed by the disclo- 
sures they dreaded would be the result of 
her extrication from their snares, took 
to flight; and shortly after, circum- 
stances inducing me to give up my living 
in the neighbourhood, I made secret ar- 
rangements for the removal of my friends 
along with me. The most profound se- 
cresy was observed with regard to them, 
until after the death of Mrs. Madoc, which 
took place soon after her change of abode, 
when her mother, as far as pecuniary mat- 
ters were concerned, experienced an agree- 



CONTRAST. 297 

able change in her circumstances, from 
succeeding to the fortune she had been 
possessed of She had, by this time, con- 
ceived an attachment for her young friend, 
that rendered her miserable at the thoughts 
of any thing unpleasant occurring to her. 
Participating in her solicitude about her, 
and not knowing the moment she might 
be traced, I conceived the idea of a little 
innocent artifice, for the purpose of endea- 
vouring to lead inquirers astray, by having 
the corresponding initials of Mrs. Madoc 
alone engraved on her gravestone." 

" All is satisfactorily explained," said 
De Montville ; " and now it only remains 
to break the matter to lord Le Poer." 

" I will undertake that," said Mr. Floyd ; 
and they repaired, without further delay, 
to his lordship. From the revolution his 
feelings had undergone, with respect to 
Adelaide, what he now experienced at the 
communication that awaited him, may 
easily be conceived. 

But Adelaide was still ignorant of this 
happy change ; and to dissipate the doubts 
and fears she was consequently under, 
o3 



29^ CONTRAST. 

Mr. Floyd preceded the gentlemen to the 
cottage of Mrs. Mowbray. 



CHAP. XIV. 

*â€¢ The innocent are gay â€” the lark is gay, 
Tliat dries his feathers, saturate with de^v. 
Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams 
Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest." 

As Mr. Floyd said, Mrs. Mowbray had 
by this tinfie become so attached to her fair 
protege, that it rendered it almost death 
the thought of losing her : in her sweet- 
ness, her gratitude, her endearing atten- 
tions, she found consolation for the loss 
she had sustained, such as she felt con- 
vinced she should seek elsewhere in vain. 
She shrunk from the idea of being an 
isolated being ; and to avert what extreme 
sensitiveness, heightened by a romantic 
education, rendered dreadful to her imagi- 
nation, had conceived the poject of bring- 
ing about a union between Mr. Floyd^s 
eldest son and Adelaide. The young man 
was heir to his mother's brother, sir Edwin 



CONTRAST. 299 

Trevannion, a baronet, of considerable pro- 
perty, in the neighbourhood ; so that she 
had nothing to accuse herself, on the score 
of rank or fortune, in wishing to bring 
about this alliance. In promoting the 
marriage of her adopted daughter with 
the son of such an old friend as Mr. Floyd, 
she should be sure of their remaining al- 
ways upon their present terms, and con- 
tinuing in her vicinity ; and she therefore 
decided on promoting it with all her heart. 
The avowed admiration of the young 
gentleman for Adelaide, and to which was 
perhaps owing the first suggestion of the 
idea, convinced her that nothing could be 
more agreeable to him ; but, on the side 
of Adelaide, there was a sHght impediment 
to the plan, namely, her acknowledgment 
of an attachment to another. But this was 
one Mrs. Mowbray indulged a hope might 
be got over, from the ignorance Adelaide 
confessed herself in of the present senti- 
ments of the gentleman, and the little 
likelihood she conceived there was of their 
meeting. But in making Mrs. Mowbray 
her confidant, and acknowledging her rea- 
diness to remain with her, she did not by 



300 CONTRAST. 

any means relinquish the idea of apprizing 
Mountflorence of her present circum- 
stances, and requiring his opinion how 
she should act, as it was not to be sup- 
posed she could think of passively remain- 
ing under the displeasure of her friends : 
but with all her anxiety to know where 
to direct to Mountflorence, her efforts for 
the purpose had as yet failed. Mrs. Mow- 
bray knew not how to participate in her 
regret on the subject, so apprehensive was 
she of a renewed communication with her 
friends leading to the separation she 
dreaded. Had the mind of Adelaide 
been free from uneasiness, she must 
have been happy where she was â€” such 
a fairy paradise was the dwelling of 
Mrs. Mowbray, and so much was she 
herself the idol of the small circle she 
only ventured to mix in: but its being 
contracted did not prevent her amuse- 
ments being varied ; the Floyd family had 
received the advantages of a very superior 
education, so that when an unexpected 
addition of fortune enabled Mr. Floyd to 
resign his living, in the vicinity of Ma- 
doc Castle, and launch out in what was 



CONTRAST. 301 

called fashionable style, there was nothing 
wanting to render their house a very plea- 
sant place of resort. In conjunction with 
those of his family, Adelaide would have 
liked the attentions of young Floyd very 
well, but that she suspected their motive ; 
for Mrs. Mowbray did not like to be ac- 
tually explicit with her, till she saw the 
effect produced upon her by them. 

Such was the position of affairs when 
the travellers arrived, to the great discom- 
posure of all parties, with the exception of 
Adelaide â€” that is, as soon as she was re- 
lieved from the fears excited by their an- 
nouncement. Mrs. Mowbray viewed their 
arrival in the light of a prelude to an ap- 
proaching separation; and the Floyds, 
from a similar apprehension, feared its 
proving subversive of the plan in contem- 
plation, an idea not at all agreeable ; the 
certainty that Adelaide would inherit all 
Mrs. Mowbray was possessed of, rendering 
them very desirous, independent of many 
other considerations, for her alliance. Mrs. 
Mowbray hardly knew how to avoid wish- 
ing that the motive for tracing Adelaide 
had been different from what it was, that 



302 CONTRAST. 

she might have had a pretext for running 
off with her to some other hiding-place, or 
inducing her to let young Floyd, still bet- 
ter again, run off with her to Gretna 
Green. 

We shall pass over the scene that en^ 
sued on the arrival of the gentlemen at Mrs. 
Mowbray's embowered cottage ; suffice it, 
Adelaide could hardly believe her senses, 
when she found herself in his lordship's 
srms, pressed to his heart, with every de- 
monstration of affection. 

Emotion a little subsided, Mrs. Mow- 
bray came in for her share of notice : lord 
Le Poer was profuse in his expressions of 
gratitude, for the interest she had evinced 
for Adelaide ; and if De Montville did not 
say so much on the subject, his looks tes- 
tified that he, at least, felt as much. 

Mrs. Mowbray received these acknow- 
ledgments with a constrained air. â€” " On 
Miss Mountflorence's account I must ever 
rejoice," she said, " at my not having re- 
mained in ignorance of her; but on my 
own, perhaps, it might have been as well 
I had ; for, in proportion as I value her 
society, must I feel its loss.'^ 



CONTRAST. 3CS 

"But there is no occasion for relin- 
quishing it," said his lordship ; *' I must 
hope, my dear ma'am, that you will afford 
me an opportunity, elsewhere, of testifying, 
by more than words, what I feel for your 
conduct towards her." 

Mrs. Mowbray shook her head â€” " That, 
I believe I may say, my lord," she replied, 
" is out of the question : we have no right 
to interrupt or empoison the enjoyments 
oÂ£ others, by the obtrusion of our sorrows ; 
home, therefore, is the place for the truly 
afflicted. But, pardon me," she added, 
with something of her usual manner, " for 
not seeming to participate more in the 
happiness derived from what has just oc- 
curred. I fear you will deem me selfish 
from the circumstance ; but the truth is, 
the idea of an immediate separation from 
my yotmg friend has totally unhinged me." 

** How happy am I then," said lord Le 
Poer, " that it is in my power to remove so 
painful an apprehension from your mind !" 

He and De Montville, previous to their 
repairing to the cottage, had talked the 
matter over. Lady Newbury was absent, 
just at this period, from home, with her 



304 CONTRAST. 

daughter, lady Louisa : to replacing Ade- 
laide with lady Dorothy, lord Le Poer 
had a strong objection; and it had, ac- 
cordingly, been agreed to let her remain 
yet a little longer where she was, provided 
it was found to be agreeable ; and he now 
hastened to assure Mrs. Mowbray of this, 
of its neither being his wish or his inten- 
tion to remove Adelaide immediately from 
her protection. 

The brow of Mrs. Mowbray instantly 
brightened ; yet, when she reflected on the 
explanations that might now ensue, tend- 
ing to the subversion of her favourite plan 
â€” not that, according to the assertion of 
Adelaide, either his lordship or De Mont- 
ville knew who the object of her attach- 
ment was â€” it had well nigh lowered again : 
but a conversation with lord Le Poer 
might let her know what she had to ap- 
prehend; and she accordingly was glad 
when an opportunity was afforded for this, 
by De Montville wooing Adelaide from 
the house, desirous of hearing still more 
minute particulars of what had occurred, 
than Mr. Floyd had the power of giv- 
ing. As Mrs. Mowbray slowly follow- 



CONTRAST. 305 

ed, with lord Le Poer, she proceeded to 
gratify his equal anxiety on the subject. 

On her concluding â€” " What reason 
have I not for gratitude," he cried, " when 
I think of the hands into which I com- 
mitted your young friend ! and how can I 
ever sufficiently make her amends, for 
what I was the means of making her 
suffer ? though, certainly, I might plead, 
in excuse for this, the great error I was 
led into. As a proof that her happiness 
shall be my future study, I have to en- 
treat you, my dear madam, to assure her, 
that she need fear no further stress on her 
inclination ; were I even still disposed to 
exercise any undue authority over her, 
my plan of a union between her and my 
young kinsman here must still have been 
relinquished, from his avowal of an at- 
tachment elsewhere." 

This was indeed the case : the project 
of leaving Adelaide some time longer with 
Mrs. Mowbray, was not the only matter 
talked over at the inn : on lord Le Poer 
intimating the happiness he should derive 
from seeing the union he had so long con- 
templated, at length take place, De Mont- 



306 CONTRAST. 

ville candidly confessed his affections being 
engaged â€” hopelessly, he certainly had ra- 
ther reason to imagine at the moment; 
but still so irretrievably, that it was use- 
less to talk of marriage to him : and this 
his lordship thought proper to disclose to 
Mrs. JNIowbray, as a means of satisfying 
Adelaide that she had no further persecu- 
tion to dread ; for in the light of one,^ he 
had rather reason to conceive, from differ- 
ent circumstances that had transpired, his 
urging her to the recently-intended union 
must have been considered. 

" Mr. De Montville attached to ano- 
ther!" cried Mrs. Mowbray, clasping her 
hands in a kind of joyful transport. 

Lord Le Poer looked earnestly at her â€” 
" Then I am to infer," he said, evidently 
much discomposed, " that she has given 
you to understand the intended project 
was not one of an agreeable nature to her ? 
But in confessing this, has she revealed 
through what cause â€” whether through a 
previous attachment?" 

" She certainly has not denied an at- 
tachment," replied Mrs. ^Mowbray ; " but 
I need hardly say, that whatever she con- 



CONTRAST. 307 

fided to me was under the seal of secrecy." 

" Again mystery !" cried lord Le Poer, 
and he walked on a little way, in great 
agitation ; then, suddenly pausing, '* but 
I must hope there will be an end of it," 
he said ; " that \then she finds my study is 
her happiness, she will not refuse to me 
the confidence I have a right to expect." 

" Whether on the subject to which I 
have alluded, I cannot say," replied Mrs. 
Mowbray; ** but do not for a moment 
imagine," she added, on seeing him draw 
back, with a lowering brow, " that her si- 
lence on it proceeds from any cause that 
could lessen her in your estimation. I can 
so far relieve your feelings, as to assure 
you, the object of her attachment is not, 
with regard to rank or reputation, un- 
worthy of her." 

*' Then why make a mystery of his 
name, if fortune be the only obstacle ?" 

" There is another, even greater than 
that could occasion," said Mrs. ^lowbray 
â€” " a w^ant of reciprocal regard ; and this 
being the case, your lordship cannot won- 
der, I am sure, that she should wish to 
keep the circumstance altogether from 



308 CONTRAST. 

your knowledge : there is a pride and de- 
licacy in the female mind, that makes it 
shrink from the acknowledgment of a 
hopeless attachment." 

" Naturally ; but, in this instance, I 
hope," said lord Le Poer, " this feeling of 
pride will be evinced in something more 
than efforts to hide this attachment â€” in 
efforts to conquer as well as to conceal it. 
Since I must, I suppose, feign ignorance 
of your communication, I shall depend 
on you, my dear madam, for urging what- 
ever is requisite for the conquest of her 
unfortunate prepossession. You will re- 
present to her, that she owes it, both to 
herself and friends, to make every exertion 
to overcome it ; since it will be a sore af- 
fliction indeed to me, to leave the world 
without seeing her happily settled." 

" Rely upon it, nothing that I can urge 
for the purpose shall be omitted ; and, to 
be candid with your lordship, as I wish 
to be ingenuous, whenever in my power, 
I have a selfish motive for wishing it over- 
come;" and without further hesitation, 
she proceeded to disclose the plan she had 
herself formed for disposing of Adelaide, 



CONTRAST. S09 

by the union projected between her and 
young Floyd. 

Lord Le Poer listened with profound 
attention, and without any sign of disap- 
probation: with the name and circum- 
stances of the young gentleman's uncle, 
he was well acquainted ; and altogether, 
since disappointed in his favourite project, 
of seeing Adelaide the wife of De INIont- 
ville, he did not think there could be a 
more desirable alliance for her than the 
one now suggested. 

A thousand mortifying explanations, 
that could not otherwise be avoided, would 
here be spared, through the management 
of Mrs. Mowbray ; and, in short, he soon 
became as anxious for it as she was, and 
from, perhaps, a similar motive, a little 
selfishness : but human nature, indeed, as 
has been observed, is composed of mingled 
yarn â€” " our vices would despair, if not che- 
rished by our virtues; and our virtues would 
grow proud, if not chastised by our vices." 

He tried, however, as much as possible, 
to give his ready acquiescence in her sug- 
gestion the appearance of a compliment to 
her; but the indirect flattery meant by 



310 CONTRAST. 

this had not the desired efifect, that of in- 
ducing any further explicitness from her : 
but she had the most urgent reasons for 
being, in this instance at least, a faithful 
confident. In vain lord Le Poer sought 
to betray her into some avowal, that might 
serve as a clue to the discovery of the per- 
son beloved by Adelaide ; she was too com- 
pletely on her guard, to allow him to suc- 
ceed in any effort for the purpose. 

It was settled, that for the present, no 
notice should be taken of her communica- 
tion respecting young Floyd. His friends 
knew what his wishes were, she said, but 
had concurred with her in the expediency 
of his creating an interest for himself in 
the mind of the lady, ere he disclosed them. 

While she and his lordship were thus 
discoursing, Adelaide and De Montville 
were not silent, as they pursued their way 
along the edge of the stream, that held its 
murmuring course through the beautiful 
little domain of Mrs. Mowbray. The 
glow occasioned by emotion prevented De 
Montville from immediately noticing the 
effect which anxiety had had upon his fair 
companion ; and if more brilliantly beau- 



CONTRAST. 311 

tiful, she at least had never appeared more 
interestingly lovely in his eyes ; and such 
vras the intense regard with which he lis- 
tened to her, that lord Le Poer, consider- 
ing the avowal he had just heard from 
him, might have been surprised, had he been 
near enough to have noticed it, but that 
he probably would have supposed it owing 
to his having an eye for beauty, wherever 
he discovered it, a thing natural enough, 
he would also have allowed, for a young 
man like him. 

At his express desire, Adelaide faith- 
fully recounted all that had befallen her 
since leaving Ireland ; not however with- 
out regi-etting her having been so circum- 
stantial, when she saw the extravagant 
rage to which he was transported, on hear- 
ing of the conduct of Madoc, and the ven- 
geance he vowed against him, if ever he 
got him within his grasp. To try and di- 
vert his thoughts, she was beginning to 
recount what she felt, on hearing his name 
and lord Le Poer's announced, when Mrs. 
Mowbray and his lordship joined them. 
With a smile truly paternal, lord Le Poer 
drew her arm from under De Montviile's, 



S12 CONTRAST. 

and again addressed her, in a manner that 
filled her heart with mingled surprise and 

joy. 

But for one thing, how happy would 
she have been, at the conviction thus afford- 
ed of a complete change in his feelings and 
sentiments towards her ! but she was still 
in suspense, on a matter of such import- 
ance to her : but fair and softly, as her old 
nurse used to say ; she was certain she must 
be soon relieved from this, so she deter- 
mined to resign herself to the enjoyment 
of the present hour. 

Hardly had she formed this wise re- 
solve, when Mrs. Mowbray informed his 
lordship, that, if he had no objection, she 
purposed requesting her friends, the Floy ds, 
to meet him that day at dinner. He repli- 
ed, he could not be too soon introduced to 
a family, to whom he considered himself 
under great obligations, for the kindness 
shewn to Adelaide ; and this point being- 
settled, the party repaired to the house, 
whence, after partaking of refreshment, 

the gentlemen returned to , to dress 

for dinner. 

In their way back in the chaise, lord 



CONTRAST. 313 

Le Poer related to his companion the con- 
versation he had had with Mrs. Mowbray. 
Horatio had thrown himself indolently 
back ; but at the very first intimation of 
Adelaide's acknowledgment to her, he 
started from his reclining attitude, with 
any thing but a look of calmness â€” Con- 
fessed, positively confessed, to being in 
love ! Well, really â€” But did she not con- 
fess as much before ? Why then this sur- 
prise â€” this ? and he began pulling 

up and letting down the window â€” now to 
exclude the dust, and then to admit the 
air. â€” " However, I am glad I had the start 
of her," he continued to himself â€” " I am 
glad I did not allow her to decidedly re- 
ject me, by timely apprizing lord Le Poer 
of my inability to accede to his plan ;" and 
again throwing himself back, he continued 
musing over what he had heard, till rous- 
ed from his reverie by the stopping of the 
carriage. 

After his confession of the morninoj to 
his lordship, it was not to be supposed 
that he could be disconcerted by what he 
had now told hjm : disconcerted, however, 
he certainly was, from some cause or other. 

VOL. II. p

Never had his valet known him so impa- 
tient, or irritable, under his hands, as this 
day â€” continually starting up, and discom- 
posing his hair, and traversing the room, 
with all the air of a person in very bad hu- 
mour, either with himself or others. But 
monsieur Frippon accounted very ration- 
ally for this â€” he had been dragged on a 
journey he did not like, he made no doubt, 
and so he could not help being petulant. 

The gentlemen reached the cottage before 
the Floyds : Mrs. Mowbray was ready to 
receive them ; but Adelaide did not make 
her appearance, till just as a glimpse was 
caught of the coach of sir Edwin. She 
entered the room with an air of perturba- 
tion : having paid her compliments to his 
lordship, in a hurried manner, she turned 
to a window, and began busying herself in 
intertwining the flaunting boughs of the 
shrubs that grew without 

The moment De Montville heard her 
approaching, he hastily placed himself at a 
window, where he appeared so much en- 
grossed, as not to be sensible of her en- 
trance ; nevertheless an oeillade was stolen, 
and he knew not how it was â€” he found 



CONTRAST. 315 

himself moving from his own window to 
hers. This was no sooner perceived by her, 
than she drew back, with something very 
like a derisive smile, and placing herself be- 
side his lordship, began asking him, whether 
he had yet seen any thing more of the ro- 
mantic neighbourhood ? De Montville felt 
very much confused ; she had the appear- 
ance of being offended ; yet had they not 
parted, seemingly, the best friends in the 
world ? â€” and had she not been all sweet- 
ness, and kindness, and good nature, while 
they were conversing ? But he had it ! she 
l)ad time, since they parted, to recol- 
lect herself; and the lady feared, if she 
continued her condescension, a miscon- 
struction might be put upon the circum- 
stance, that might occasion the renewal of 
the recent project. Well, really it was 
provoking enough, her not being assured 
there was no danger of this, from his con- 
fession of that morning to his lordship ; 
but since he had not thought proper to 
have it mentioned to her, for from what 
had now occurred, he persuaded himself he 
had made no allusion to it, in his conver- 
p Z 



316 CONTRAST. 

sation with her friend, he must try what 
he could do himself to remove her appre- 
hensions on the subject ; and accordingly- 
assuming an affected air â€” one meant to be- 
token perfect indifference as to the man- 
ner in which she had treated him, began 
humming an Italian air, as he stood loll- 
ing against the side of the window. And 
â€” " Fine girls, by Jove !" with affected 
rapture, he exclaimed, as he saw the three 
Miss Floyds alighting : and fine girls they 
certainly were ; and what was more, they 
knew it. They were accompanied by 
their father, and mother, and uncle, sir 
Edwin Trevannion, all very good kind of 
people in their way, and just sufficiently 
worldly, to avoid incurring the imputation 
of being romantic ; also by their brother, 
a sentimental-looking youth, now looking 
more lack-a-daisical than ever, from the 
apprehensions excited of De Montville 
proving a formidable rival to him, with 
the goddess of his idolatry, notwithstand- 
ing the consolatory assurances received to 
the contrary from his staunch friend, Mrs. 
Mo\vbray ; insomuch that he could not 
help wishing, in setting out in search of 



CONTRAST. 317 

her, his lordship had left him behind. In 
this wish his sisters could not concur, so 
gratifying to their pride and vanity was 
the hope of obtaining his admiration. 

They entered, with an air that convin- 
ced De Montville they required no finish- 
ing lessons to render them au fait as to 
the best mode of playing off their attrac- 
tions; but, piqued as he was, he was not 
sorry to find them the coquettes they were ; 
and placing himself by them, he soon ap- 
peared completely engrossed. 

The brother, as usual, stationed him.self 
at the side of Adelaide, and, as usual, began 
to look and sigh unutterable things; and 
Adelaide might, perhaps, have been moved 
to a little compassion for him, but that 
she knew he had acted a very jilting part 
towards a pretty young girl in the place, 
on her account ; and so, an enemy to in- 
constancy, she determined not to grant 
him a particle of pity. 

But whatever had moved her, she cer- 
tainly did appear under the influence of 
some agitating emotion, at least to De 
Montville, from his perhaps more narrow- 
ly watching her than any one else, and 



318 CONTRAST. 

being better acquainted with the character 
of her countenance, and her real manner. 
The flirtation he had commenced did not 
prevent his continuing to observe her, 
though without obtaining any look to 
make amends for the one that had so af- 
fronted him. 

Lord Le Poer expressed himself most 
graciously on the occasion of his introduc- 
tion to his new acquaintance, and alto- 
gether seemed a very different being from 
what he had hitherto appeared. He evi- 
dently was not only pleased with his party, 
but charmed with every thing about him ; 
and indeed, it would have been impossible 
for a person, possessed of the least taste 
and sentiment, not to be delighted with 
the abode of Mrs. Mowbray, so deliciously 
rural was every thing about it ; the air, 
that sported with the shrubs, embowering 
the cottage, was impregnated with the fra- 
grance of the new-mown meads, that here 
and there were caught glimpses of, through 
the dark woods on the opposite side; 
flowers, yet uncropped, in their native 
beds, flaunted, with dewy beauty, through 
the windows ; while the ear was at once 



CONTRAST. 319 

soothed and enchanted by the soft rippling 
of the water, conveying by its very sound 
an idea of coolness, and the wild melody 
of Nature's choristers, from a thousand 
tangled brakes and bushes. 

The Miss Floyds gave their new beau 
a particular description of their neigh- 
bourhood, and descanted much on the 
elegance of their weekly assemblies, and 
the pleasantness of their evening prome- 
nade, by the sea-side, where all the fashion- 
ables of the place were in the habit of 
meeting, to listen to the military band of 
the regiment quartered in the town, hear 
the chit-chat of the day, and enjoy the 
saline breezes, so refreshing at that season 
of the year. 

They dwelt so much upon this, that 
De Montville clearly saw their hearts were 
set on taking him to it ; and accordingly 
proposed their going after tea. Ade- 
laide was referred to, and making no ob- 
jection, from being no longer under any 
necessity for concealment, the party, that 
is, all the young part of it, proceeded 
thither at the usual hour. The Floyds 
were known to every one, so that their 



320 CONTRAST. 

party was soon augmented : amongst the 
officers that joined them, Adelaide was 
recognised by two or three, that had been 
stationed, with a detachment of the regi- 
ment, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Court- 
ney. This was her first appearance abroad, 
and she excited no little curiosity and ad- 
miration. 

" Divinely handsome, 'pon honour!" 
cried a military exquisite, with a languish- 
ing air, to Miss Floyd, as he adjusted his 
hair. " May we put her down as a fourth 
grace ?" 

" If by that you mean as a sister," re- 
phed Miss Floyd, " no." 

" Well, really, from the strong family 
likeness, I should have taken her for one." 

" I must bow for that compliment," 
said Miss Floyd, " so flattering from the 
observation that preceded it." 

The walk, extending along the sea-side, 
the music, the murmur of the waves, the 
partial glimpses of the town, with the 
mountains that rose in its rear, formed 
altogether a scene that brought Palermo, 
in a degree, to the recollection of De 
Montville. Associations were connected 



CONTRAST. 321 

with this recollection, that caused him to 
sigh, and involuntarily glance at Adelaide: 
their eyes met ; she was even intently re- 
garding him at the moment ; and in the 
surprise, perhaps the sudden pleasure, oc- 
casioned by the circumstance, he was on 
the point of addressing some observation 
to her, when she turned away her head, 
and renewed the conversation, that seemed 
to have been suspended, with one of her 
military acquaintances. Could it be that 
in him he beheld the person to whom she 
was secretly attached ? And he began to 
watch her narrowly. 

Well was it for his reputation for gal- 
lantry, that a diversion was caused in his 
favour, by some of the military heroes 
joining the Miss Floyds, so unsettled and 
distrait was he this evening. At length 
the music ceased, the company began to 
disperse, dun night to veil the solemn 
scene, and the party repaired to Mr. 
Floyd's, where they found those they had 
left at the cottage, only waiting their join- 
ing them, to sit down to an elegant supper. 

Sir Edwin did not allow the party to 
p3 



CONTRAST. 

separate, until he had received a promise 
of their meeting at his house, the next 
day, to dinner. This had been a day of 
varied feeling to Adelaide : there was 
much to rejoice at, more than she had once 
ventured to indulge a hope of; but still, 
spite of her gratitude and self-congratula- 
tion at the circumstance, there was a feeling 
of disappointment, that weighed heavily on 
her heart, and deeply affected her spirits. 
In vain she tried to recollect she ought to 
have been prepared for this ; that it was 
what she had expected: she now found 
that, unknown to ourselves, hope will 
lurk in the heart ; for had it not lingered 
in hers, would she have felt the pang now 
experienced ? But it would be overcome ; 
reason and gratitude would both alike 
assist her to subdue it. But she was also 
vexed with herself; she was conscious she 
had been pettish with De Montville ; and 
how had he deserved it ? But she would 
make the amende the next day, if oppor- 
tunity offered; and she rose early the 
next morning, under the idea that he 
might come over before breakfast; and 
this he certainly had an inclination to do> 



<:ONTRAST. 323 

but a dread of appearing too particular 
checked him; and then lord Le Poer 
wanted him to write a letter or two for 
him ; so he forced himself to remain quiet- 
ly within, till the time for repairing to 
the cottage, to proceed thence to sir Ed- 
win's. 

The Floyds accompanied them ; alight- 
ing at the entrance of the shrubbery, they 
were joined by Mrs. Mowbray and Ade- 
laide, and at a little distance from the cot- 
tage, took water, and in sir Edwin's beau- 
tiful barge, were rowed up the stream, un- 
der the shade of overhanging boughs, and 
green banks dotted with a profusion of 
wild flowers. The stream gradually wi- 
dened as they advanced, till at length it 
began to form some fine sweeps and pictu- 
resque reaches, through the venerable 
plantations of the baronet. Domestics 
were in waiting to receive them, and with 
much form they were ushered to the house, 
a very noble mansion, seated in the midst 
of an extensive and finely diversified do- 
main, where, from the altitude of the 
mountains that formed the background, 
and the soft sunny glades and pastures 



324 CONTRAST. 

scattered through the woods, it might be 
said the sublime and beautiful were here 
united. 

When lord Le Poer looked about him, 
and saw the wealth and consequence that 
every thing denoted â€” the long train of 
liveried servants â€” the rich services of mas- 
sive old plate â€” the noble domain, he 
could not help being more anxious than 
before, for the suggested alliance with the 
baronet. In proportion as his anxiety for 
it increased, was his vexation at seeing the 
young lady still more shy and distant, than 
even on the preceding day, to her devoted. 
But Adelaide had taken alarm ; she saw 
what was in contemplation, and in order 
to timely check hopes and expectations 
that never could be realized, and thus pos- 
sibly save herself a world of persecution, 
she deemed it expedient to adopt still 
greater reserve than ever in her manner to 
young Floyd. 

Lord Le Poer found an opportunity, in 
the course of this evening, of expressing 
his chagrin, at the circumstance, to Mrs. 
Mowbray ; and she, in reply, acknowledg- 
ed herself equally hurt by it. â€” " But they 



CONTRAST. 325 

must have patience," she observed; she 
deemed it next to impossible, that after 
what she had witnessed the preceding day, 
Adelaide would not make strenuous ef- 
forts to conquer what was at present an 
obstacle to their wishes. 

" Yesterday !" repeated his lordship, 
with much emotion ; " what, am I to infer 
then, that she yesterday saw the person to 
whom she is so unfortunately attached ?" 

Mrs. Mowbray coloured, and looked 
excessively confused, as if from having 
spoken inadvertently; but there was no 
retreating, so she was obliged to confess it 
was even so. 

" And may I not know his name ?*' de- 
manded lord Le Poer, anxiously. 

" Impossible â€” from me at least ; but as 
I have just said, I do deem it very im- 
probable, from the puppyism she yesterday 
observed, that she can persist in her at- 
tachment." 

Lord Le Poer was greatly disconcerted ; 
he could not rest until he had contrived 
to draw De INlontville aside, for the pur- 
pose of communicating what Mrs. Mow- 
bray had said. â€” " Can you make out who 



^26 CONTRAST. 

she means?'* he said; *' for of course you 
observed whoever addressed Adelaide." 

" No," De Montville replied, after a 
pause of some minutes, during which his 
looks were averted from his lordship ; " he 
had remarked nothing more particularly 
affected in the manner of one than the 
other of the military gentlemen who had 
joined the party ; but, of course, this was 
not the case, it was to be presumed, with 
Miss Mountflorence," he spoke in a piqued 
tone, " else she would not have complain- 
ed on the subject to her friend." 

" True," his lordship assented ; " and it 
is to be hoped her good sense will enable 
her to overcome an attachment that, from 
what we have heard, it may be inferred 
she condemns herself for; and then the 
coast will be clear for her new admirer." 

De Montville fell into the abstracted 
humour of the preceding evening; but 
the rallying observations of the Miss 
Floyds soon forced him to recollect him- 
self; and fancying he saw Adelaide also 
regarding him, his dread of a misconstruc- 
tion being put on the humour he had 
evinced, suddenly betrayed him into the 



CONTRAST. S2i 

opposite extreme ; and again the Miss 
Floyds were enchanted with his gallantry. 

Adelaide had meant to have made a- 
mends for the little petulance she was 
conscious of having evinced towards him 
the preceding day ; but he afforded her no 
opportunity, shunning her looks when- 
ever they encountered, and if for a mo- 
ment coming in contact, appearing hardly 
conscious he was addressing her. 

She had her musing fits also : â€” " And 
this was the lover, whose very existence," 
thought she, " but a few short months 
ago, seemed to depend on my acceptance 
of him. I now see, indeed, that no sa- 
tire on the inconstancy of his sex can be 
too severe : yet to indulge a passion that 
he had reason to believe hopeless !" and she 
found an excuse in the circumstances that 
had occurred, for what she still could not 
help thinking argued a little volatility of 
nature, at least judging of him by herself^ 
for many a painful struggle, she feared, it 
would cost her to subdue the attachment 
she had confessed. 

Lord Le Poer had never so thoroughly 
enjoyed himself as on this day : domestic 



828 CONTRAST. 

mirth and happiness were new to him: 
eased in a mountain of ice, he had hi- 
therto been impenetrable to all that was 
cheering and genial; and from the con- 
trast between the present and the past, 
clearly saw that he who is an enemy to 
the enjoyment of others, is a still greater 
to his own. 



CHAP. XV. 

" Books are but formal dulness â€” tedious friends; 
And sad amid the social board he sits, 
Lonely and inattentive. From his tongue 
Th' unfinish-'d period falls : while, borne away 
On swelling thoughts, his wafted spirit flies 
To the vain bosom of his distant fair." 

The Miss Floyds themselves could not be 
more vexed at not being able to repair that 
evening to the parade, as the fashionable 
rendezvous of the place was called, than 
was De Montville, making sure, as he did, 
of there discovering the unnamed lover of 
Adelaide: yet he thought he had pretty 
shrewdly observed her^ â€” yet it appeared 
not â€” for, doubtless, her manner must have 



CONTRAST. 329 

betrayed some emotion at the sight of a 
person so interesting to her. 

The party were to meet again the next 
day, at Mr. Floyd's ; and, in consequence 
of this, lord Le Poer did not pay a morn- 
ing visit to the cottage ; neither did De 
Montville â€” for for what should he do so ? 
â€” to break in upon some reverie of Ade- 
laide's, perhaps, that she might have liked 
to have prolonged; or to subject himself 
to a suspicion of wishing the renewal of 
what had certainly been interesting to him. 

As he surmised, after an absence of one 
evening from it, the 3Iiss Floyds were 
all impatience to go to the parade this 
evening; accordingly, after tea, they re- 
paired thither, accompanied of course by 
Adelaide, De ^Montville, and their bro- 
ther. 

The moment they made their appearance, 
they were joined, as before, by several of 
the officers, and amongst the number, those 
previously known by Adelaide. Persuaded 
that one or other of these was the object 
of Adelaide's secret attachment, De Mont- 
ville was provoked beyond description, at 
not having the power of seeing what their 



330 CONTRAST. 

looks were at meeting, walking behind 
her as he was between two of the Miss 
Floyd s ; but he would not be prevented 
watching her ; and he was considering how 
he should contrive to extricate himself 
from the fair sisters, when they suddenly 
stopped to speak to a party ; and by the 
time they overtook Adelaide, who, with 
her immediate set, had gone on, he found 
captain Elford, by far the handsomest and 
most dashing of her military friends, gone. 
" Why, what have you done with captain 
Elford ?" he anxiously inquired. 

" Done ! why nothing," replied Miss 
Emma Floyd, speaking to him over her 
shoulder : " but if you have any curiosity 
to know what is become of him, I dare 
say Miss Mountflorence can gratify you, 
for he was her immediate beau." 

" Not I, indeed," said Adelaide ; " I can 
tell nothing about him :" and he thought 
she spoke in a tone of pique ; and most as- 
suredly quickened her pace, as if under 
some little excitation. 

Ah ! it was doubtless then, as he had 
suspected ; and there had been a quarrel 
between them, the occasion of the gentle- 



CONTRAST. 33l 

man taking himself off so suddenly. Could 
it be that she had reproached him for what 
had displeased her ? but he would take 
an early opportunity of sounding her on 
the subject. This, however, was not af- 
forded him that evening ; the Miss Floyds 
were too much pleased to have a beau like 
him to parade about, to allow him to dis- 
engage himself from them ; and Adelaide, 
instead of returning to Mr. Floyd's, was 
taken up on the parade by Mrs. Mowbray, 
when it was time to return home. 

De Montville had never felt himself so 
unsettled ; and this occasioning him to pass 
a sleepless night, he rose early and strolled 
out, and ere he was aware of it, found 
himself in the road leading to the cottage. 
Finding himself there, he thought he 
might as well go on, at least if he wished 
for any particular conversation with Ade- 
laide; since, when once seized upon by 
the Miss Floyds, who, with the rest of the 
family, were again to meet lord Le Poer and 
him there that day at dinner, lie found it 
utterly impossible to obtain an opportu- 
nity for any. He found Adelaide rather 
pensively walking in front of the cottage. 



832 CONTRAST. 

She expressed herself surprised at his being 
up so early. " There are two reasons for 
it," said De Montville : " the first, that I 
could not sleep â€” and the next, that if I 
could â€” 

" Who would in such a gloomy state remain, 
Longer than nature craves, when every muse. 
And every blooming pleasure, wait without, 
To bless the wildly-devious morning walk ?" 

Adelaide spoke of the Miss Floyds. 

" They were good showy girls," De 
Montville replied ; " but then these coun- 
try belles were often more tiresonae than 
your town ones," he said, " from there being 
frequently a degree of romance mingled 
with their vanity, that rendered them still 
more unconscionable in the attentions ex- 
pected." 

" Oh !" cried Adelaide, " and this after, 
perhaps, inducing a belief that to have the 
power of paying these attentions, would 
be to obtain happiness. Sincerity, w^hi- 
thersoever fled, it is certainly not to man's 
bosom." 

" Upon my word !" exclaimed De Mont- 
ville; " and pray, fair lady, speak you from 
experience ?" 



CONTRAST. 333 

" In some cases, observation answers 
the purpose of experience," replied Ade- 
laide, perhaps a little evasively, as she 
bent over some clustering roses. 

" That's not an answer to my question," 
said De Montville; " however, I acknow- 
ledge it not a fair one to put. But I must 
ask what you did to drive your handsome 
beau, captain Elford, so suddenly away 
last night ?" 

" Nothing. He's not a watch in my 
hand, for me to regulate his movements." 

^ No ; but he's a lover at your side," 
cried De Montville; " come, confess now, 
is he not the â€” the dear unknown ?" 

Adelaide laughed. â€” " The dear un- 
known ! But I see how it is â€” Mrs. Mow- 
bray has mentioned ^" 

" That, since allowing yourself to go 
abroad, you have met with the object be- 
loved ; and for him I have set down cap- 
tain Elford." 

" Then, I assure you, you never were 
more mistaken. I know captain Elford 
but as a pleasant fop." 

" Then, if he be not him, who can it 
be ?" cried De Montville ; " for he cer- 



334 CONTRAST. 

tainly has the advantage of all the rival 
beaux." 

" Ay, there's the puzzle !" said Ade- 
laide, affecting to busy herself about the 
flowers as she spoke. " But pray let the 
subject drop â€” you know not what a disa- 
greeable one it is to me ; and I really do 
wish Mrs. Mowbray had refrained from 
divulging what she has thought proper to 
mention, from the remarks and inquiries 
I perceive it has subjected me to." 

" Is it to be inferred then, that you 
again mean to make a mystery of every 
thing ? You know, Adelaide," suddenly 
grasping her hand â€” " you know that you 
acknowledged " 

" No matter what 1 have acknowledg- 
ed," said Adelaide, withdrawing her hand ; 
" more than you already know, I conceive 
it cannot concern you to be acquainted 
with ; and if you do not, therefore, wish 
me to shun you, this subject will be 
avoided." 

What did she mean ? that all that was 
requisite for him to know was simply 
that, from her preference for another, there 
was no danger of her proving an obstacle 



CONTRAST. 335 

to his choosing elsewhere. That indeed 
might be sufficient, if he felt no regard for 
her; but experiencing the lively interest 
he did, the thought hurt him extremely ; 
and he was about expressing what he felt, 
at the idea of being deemed so selfish, 
when Mrs. Mowbray, hearing his voice, 
suddenly opened her casement, to bid him 
good-morrow, and tell him she would be 
to breakfast presently. 

De Montville, however, was not in a 
humour to meet her ; he felt restless and 
peevish, and telling Adelaide he knew 
lord Le Poer would be expecting him, 
abruptly took leave till dinner-time. 

Why did Adelaide make such a mys- 
tery of the name of him she loved? How 
teazing ! since, to know it, would be at 
once to put him out of doubt as to whe- 
ther his lordship would sanction her at- 
tachment. He was anxious, to be sure, 
to be out of suspense on the subject, lest 
opposition to her wishes might occasion 
some to his own. Perhaps so. About 
something or other he certainly was anx- 
ious and unhappy, insomuch that he al- 



336 CONTRAST. 

most meditated taking sudden flight from 
Wales. 

While at breakfast, lord Le Poer anx- 
iously inquired whether he had yet ascer- 
tained what he, meaning himself, was so 
solicitous to know ? 

De Montville answered in the negative. 

" Strange !" cried his lordship ; " she 
goes nowhere by herself â€” whoever she 
sees, therefore, it is in company ; how is 
it then, since, I conceive, there cannot 
but be some particularity between them, 
that we cannot make out who the person 
is, there is such solicitude to discover? 
You say, amongst the officers quartered 
here, she recognised some acquaintances 
â€” did you observe nothing particular in 
the manner of any one of these to her ?" 

" No." 

" Well, really it is perplexing ; but I 
must hope there will soon be candour on 
the subject. I do not like to press in- 
quiries upon her myself, lest the motive 
should be misconstrued : I shall certainly, 
however, be very miserable, should she 
continue to lock herself up in reserve from 
me â€” not, however, without acknowledg- 



CONTRAST. 337 

ing the unhappiness merited," and he 
sighed deeply. 

De Montville, rather sullenly, took up 
a paper. He could not sympathize in his 
feelings. Whatever he suffered, he was 
himself the cause of it ; and, what was 
worse still, the cause of what others â€” no 
matter who â€” were suffering at the mo- 
ment. Every thing respecting Adelaide 
had been badly managed ; she should have 
been sooner brought forward â€” sooner â€” 
But, in short, he was inclined to find fault 
with every one and every thing. 

At the ball of the ensuing week, it was 
settled that she should make her appear- 
ance ; and, short as was the time that in- 
tervened, lord Le Poer sent up to London 
for a superb set of ornaments, with a suit- 
able dress for the occasion, as also for se- 
veral handsome presents for Mrs. Mow- 
bray and her young friends ; but he was 
an altered being, now appearing to feel 
kindness and attention, not as a right, but 
an obligation. But some of the old leaven 
must have remained, had he not been 
soothed into complacence by the attentions 

VOL. II. Q 



338 CONTRAST. 

that were here paid him, every one ap- 
pearing to lay themselves out to please him. 

After an agreeable ride this morning, 
with Mr. Floyd and sir Edwin, he repair- 
ed, with the rest of the party, to the cot- 
tage, where, as usual, Adelaide came for- 
ward with smiles to greet him ; but her 
manner to De Montville was cold and re- 
served, and he again thought she looked 
as if piqued with him. 

The Miss Floyds lived but in gaiety : to 
absent themselves an evening from the pa- 
rade, was a punishment out of the question ; 
and accordingly, after tea, they proposed 
going there ; but Adelaide declined. Their 
mother, however, determined they should 
not be disappointed, made an excuse for 
their leaving her, by pretending they had 
made an appointment with some young 
friends; and accordingly they went, taking 
De Montville with them, to his great dis- 
composure, but leaving their brother be- 
hind, as the devoted of Adelaide. Ade- 
laide, however, could very well have ex- 
cused his company, and perhaps as a 
proof, or, to avoid compliments that were 
ill applied to unattending ears, immedi- 



CONTRAST. 339 

ately began occupying herself with her 
harp. 

In their way back from INIr. Floyd's, 
where they supped, to the inn, lord Le 
Poer began to complain to De INIontville 
of the uneasiness he was suffering, in con- 
sequence of Mrs. Mowbray still refusing 
to reveal to him the name he was so inte- 
rested in learning â€” ** But in some way or 
other I must contrive to learn it," he said ; 
" I cannot, hearing what I have heard of 
the daily intercourse of the parties, suffer 
myself to remain longer ignorant on the 
subject." 

" Daily intercourse !" repeated De Mont- 
ville. 

" Yes, it slipped from IMrs. Mowbray 
this evening, that they were in the habit 
of daily seeing each other â€” that this very 
day they met." 

" Then it must be by her sanction," said 
De Montville, warmly; " for Adelaide 
was not out this day, except indeed it was 
after the ]Miss Floyds dragged me away 
to the parade." 

" No, it was before that it escaped hen 
Q2 



340 CONTRAST. 

With her will, I am convinced they would 
never more see one another, she is so ex- 
tremely anxious for the marriage of Ade- 
laide with her favourite young Floyd ; not 
but what she still acknowledges that this 
unknown lover is a person that could not 
be objected to by any of her connexions, 
on the score of birth, character, or appear- 
ance." 

" Strange then that there should be 
such a mystery about him," observed his 
companion. 

" Strange indeed !" echoed his lordship ; 
" but there must be a speedy end of it; I 
cannot myself, at least for the present, in- 
terfere in the matter, Mrs. Mowbray hav- 
ing declared if I do, I shall betray to Ade- 
laide her having, in a degree, violated the 
confidence reposed in her ; on you, there- 
fore, my dear Horatio, I must depend for 
trying to learn the cause of what is so per- 
plexing ; with you Adelaide will probably 
be less on her guard, less reserved, than 
with me : you know what my sentiments 
are â€” you know my first wish is now for 
the promotion of her happiness, and assured 
of this, she may perhaps be induced to 



CONTRAST. 341 

open her heart to you ; and let me kno^v 
how I should act in this affair." 

" I am dubious," said De Montville ; 
" but I will try." 

Mrs. Mowbray was to come in early 
the next morning, to spend the day with 
the Floyds. De Montville was vexed 
that they could not be allowed to pass a 
day quietly at the cottage ; but this would 
not have suited the plans, or, at least, the 
wishes, of the Floyds. 

He rose early, and repaired to the cot- 
tage, for the purpose of escorting the la- 
dies into town. He was in hopes of en- 
countering Adelaide by herself; but she 
did not make her appearance till after Mrs. 
Mowbray had joined him ; so there was 
no opportunity for any particular conver- 
sation with her ; and to look for it, after 
her joining the Floyds, was out of the 
question. But chance sometimes favours 
us: Adelaide had said she would go no 
more to the parade, and, of course, on her 
account, whenever she was with them, it 
must be relinquished. To make amends 
for their disappointment respecting it this 
evening, they settled with some of their 



342 CONTRAST. 

young friends, that in the course of it, as 
if by chance, they should drop in with 
some of the officers, promising them a dance 
in the summer-house, out of the way of 
Mrs. Mowbray. 

In pursuance of this arrangement, as 
they were sauntering about the garden, 
after tea, with Adelaide and De Montville, 
a servant came to inform them there were 
visitors ; and, with their brother, they hast- 
ened to received them. 

" How I hope," said De Montville, as 
soon as they were out of hearing, " that 
whoever has called may take them off to 
the parade, for really 'tis quite provoking 
never to have an opportunity for a little 
conversation ; and yet perhaps," with a sigh, 
and venturing to take the hand of Ade- 
laide, as she kept walking on, apparently 
engrossed by the romantic stretch of coun- 
try which the garden commanded â€” " per- 
haps it would only be obtained to find it 
was of no use ; for I don't know how it is, 
Adelaide, but I can't help fancying that, 
in some way or other, I have incurred 
your displeasure." 

" Oh dear, no !" said Adelaide, but co- 



CONTRAST. S43 

louring very much. " What could possi- 
bly induce you to suppose so?" 

" Your manner," replied De Montville, 
" so cold, so distant, so different, in every 
respect, from what I know it naturally is." 

" We are not always under our own 
control," said Adelaide ; " all I can there- 
fore say is, that if I have offended, or ap- 
pear to be offended, it was unintentionally." 

" Well, this assurance relieves me from 
great uneasiness : it would be a sad aggra- 
vation of the unhappiness I am enduring, 
to be compelled to think that, not even as 
a friend, I was regarded by you." 

" The pain would be mutual, I assure 
you," said A delaide ; "but I must hope 
you are not in earnest, in this assertion of 
unhappiness." 

" It is not an idle one, I assure you," 
said De Montville; " I am just, at this 
moment, as unhappy as any one can be, 
who, seeing himself certain of happiness, as 
he believed, finds himself suddenly de- 
prived of it. This time last year, and 
what were not my felicitous prospects ! 
now â€” in short, I can no longer disguise 
the truth ; neither rhyme nor reason can 



344 CONTRAST. 

say how I adore you, Adelaide ! therefore 
you may conceive what I suffer at find- 
ing you devoted to another." 

" Am I to believe you serious ?" said 
Adelaide, in extreme emotion ; " how am 
I to reconcile this declaration, with your 
recent one to lord Le Poer, of an attach- 
ment to another?" 

" Easily â€” I did confess such an attach- 
ment to him, but on what account ? be- 
cause I feared, if I did not so deceive him, 
he might think of a revival of that pro- 
ject, which, from your indirect acknow- 
ledgment to me in Ireland, previous to 
our parting, as well as other circumstances, 
I had reason to imagine one of unhappi- 
ness to you ; and great as was the misery 
of losing you, I felt that it would be 
greater to possess you, at the expence of 
your happiness." 

Adelaide withdrew her hand, but it 
was only to take his arm ; she trembled, 
and appeared very much affected. â€” " I 
cannot but feel this generosity," she said ; 
" but I shall hope to prove myself not al- 
together undeserving of it. You shall 
hear all; and in giving you my confi- 



CONTRAST. 345 

dence, I give it with a determination to 
let you decide, whether it would be most 
for my happiness or misery to subdue the 
attachment I acknowledge." 

" Then you no longer hesitate to let me 
know the name of the too-happy object 
of this attachment?" 

" On the night of the ball you shall 
know it; but till then, I cannot be more 
communicative. I have reason to believe 
he will be there, and then " 

** I am to be introduced to him ?" said 
De Montville, turning of a deadly pale- 
ness, and walking away from her : yet 
what had he heard that he had not anti- 
cipated â€” a confirmation from her own lips 
of her being attached ? yet he felt as if, 
till a certain period had been fixed for an 
introduction between him and this happy 
rival â€” as if a doubt of the circumstance 
had still Hngered in his mind. â€” 'â€¢' But 
may I not, at least, be put out of suspense, 
as to whether you dread any opposition to 
your wishes from lord Le Poer?" he said, 
suddenly returning to her. 

" Xo, quite the contrary." 
Q3 



346 CONTRAST. 

" No !'* exclaimed De Montville, in a 
tone of surprise ; " then why all this mys- 
tery ? if certain of his approval, why have 
affected so much concealment?" 

" You shall hear why : here is my hand, 
and I give you my word, that after being 
introduced, you shall learn all you desire, 
but not till then, and that cannot be till 
the night of the ball ; so, for the present, 
let this conversation between us remain a 
secret." 

He had hardly time to give the assu- 
rance required, ere the Miss Floyds were 
seen approaching, with a whole bevy of 
beaux and belles ; the harper was in wait- 
ing, and repairing to the summer-house, 
the merry dance commenced, and was 
kept up for several hours, to the great 
delight of all but the disconsolate De 
Montville. He could not get over the 
kind of shock he had sustained, by the 
recent conversation with Adelaide ; and 
feeling his efforts to recover himself in- 
effectual, he pleaded an intense head- 
ach, as an excuse for not joining in the 
amusement of the evening; but Ade- 



CONTRAST. 347 

laide made no excuse; care seemed sud- 
denly to have fled her ; and he could al- 
most have felt piqued at her complete re- 
storation to vivacity. Was no sympa- 
thy experienced for him â€” no feeling due 
for his conduct respecting her? but she 
had flung a load from her own heart, that 
rendered it impossible for her to feel other- 
wise than completely happy at the mo- 
ment. He could not avoid considering 
her assertion, of expecting no opposition 
to her wishes from lord Le Poer, but a 
mere boast of pride ; had she had no ap- 
prehension of the kind, would she have 
practised the concealment she had had re- 
course to ? and it w^as from making sure, 
from her recent conversation with him, of 
his successful interference with his lord- 
ship, that she had been enabled to recover 
her spirits, previously weighed down by 
the anxiety she was now relieved from. 

Well, she should not be disappointed 
in this expectation ; he would interfere for 
her â€” all his eloquence, if required, should 
be exerted to serve her with his lordship : 
and then he would take leave for some 
time of England ; he could not remain 



348 CONTRAST. 

to see her quietly dispose of herself to an- 
other, or subject himself to perhaps un- 
pleasant remarks and arguments; so he 
would resume travelling, that delightful 
resource for an unquiet mind. 

There were two days now intervening 
till the ball. De Montville passed them 
almost entirely by himself: the coquetry 
of the Miss Floyds tormented him, and 
he could take no pleasure in conversing 
with Adelaide, from the persuasion that, 
anxiously occupied as her mind must be, 
just at this juncture, it was impossible she 
could feel any in conversing with him, ex- 
cept so far as it confirmed her hope of his 
proving himself her friend. 

At length the day for which many a 
little heart had been impatiently panting 
â€” the day for the weekly assembly at 

arrived, and all was again a lively 

scene of preparation for it: the articles 
ordered down from London by lord Le 
Poer, were duly received, the presents 
presented, and most graciously accepted, 
and the dress and ornaments of Adelaide 
pronounced divine. 

Attired with the most studious elegancCj^ 



CONTRAST. 349 

and with a glow on her cheeks that gave 
an additional brilliancy to her eyes, she 
looked even dazzlingly beautiful this even- 
ing. Contrary to his usual cold taciturni- 
ty, lord Le Poer expressed himself flatter- 
ingly on her appearance. De Montville 
did not compliment, but he looked what 
he felt. 

Though his lordship felt he should like 
to witness the impression produced by the 
appearance of Adelaide, still he declined 
being present at the assembly. 

Leaving him to pass a quiet evening 
with Mrs. Mowbray, Adelaide and De 
Montville proceeded to Mr. Floyd's. In 
their way â€” " I know I shall be asked by 
young Floyd, the moment we meet," said 
Adelaide ; " it is my intention, therefore, 
to say I am engaged." 

" Which may be presumed, I suppose, 
to be the case," said De Montville, with 
a quivering lip." 

" Why, it certainly is my intention," 
replied Adelaide, rather declining her 
eyes, and playing with her fan, " to dance 

with " There was no occasion for her 

to add more. 



350 CONTRAST. 

" We shall find him then, I am to con- 
clude, in the assembly-room before us?" 
said De Montville. 

" At the assembly he assuredly will be," 
said Adelaide ; " but as I do not exactly 
know what set I may dance with him, I 
am going to ask you a great compliment." 

" Name it," said De Montville, impa- 
tiently. 

" Why, that you will sit with me till 
I do dance with him." 

" And you call asking that asking a 
great compliment !" cried De Montville, 
reproachfully ; and for a minute he turned 
aside his head with a feeling of vexation. 

As Adelaide said, young Floyd only 
waited to see her to ask her for the first 
set. Her answer was ready ; she was en- 
gaged, and could not promise her hand to 
any one, till her first engagement was 
over. 

To whom could it be, the Miss Floyds 
wondered, and ventured to ask her. She 
smiled, but made no reply. From her 
their attention was directed to her com- 
panion, in evident expectation of his en- 
gaging them successively for some of the 



CONTRAST. 351 

sets before their entering the room ; but, 
to their great disappointment, no attempt 
of the kind was made. At length they 
repaired to the scene of expected conquest ; 
but Adelaide was the grand attraction : 
every one was anxious to look at her â€” 
every one to learn who she was ; and, if 
vain, she certainly must have been grati- 
fied, by finding she had refused more than 
half the beaus in the room. At length 
dancing commenced, and she was left to 
chat with De JMontville. But he knew 
not what she said ; he was all emotion â€” 
all agitation â€” looking anxiously at her 
every time he saw any stranger approach- 
ing ; but still, without receiving any look 
in return, to intimate the person expected 
being come. 

One set was danced, and another just 
beginning, when â€” " I declare," said Ade- 
laide, suddenly, " this is so very stupid, 
our sitting quietly here, when every one 
else is dancing, that, if you have no ob- 
jection, we'll stand up." 

" As you please," replied De Montville ; 
" but I apprize you, that you'll have a 
very bad partner in me."

" Oh, no matter," she cried ; and start* 
ing up, she prevented his making any 
further objections to the proposal, by giv- 
ing him her hand, to lead her to the 
dancers. 

At the conclusion of the set, as he was 
leading her back to a seat â€” " Oh my de- 
licious bouquet !" she cried, " sent to me 
by the dear sir Edwin ! How I miss not 
having brought it with me !" 

" Shall I send for it ?" asked De Mont- 
ville. 

" Oh no ; for I dare say it would be 
half dead before I got it out of the hands 
of any of the waiters ; but if I could ask 
you, indeed " 

" Where shall I find it?" demanded 
De Montville, impatiently. 

" Why, I think I left it on the marble 
slab, in the back drawing-room." 

De Montville flew to Mr. Floyd's, but 
the bouquet was not to be found. He was 
determined, however, she should not be 
disappointed; the gardener accordingly 
was summoned, and as beautiful a one 
procured her out of Mr. Floyd's green-

house, as she could possibly have received 
from sir Edwin. 

On re-entering the assembly-room, he 
found her sitting by herself, dancing hav- 
ing just recommenced. â€” " Well ?" he cried, 
casting round him an anxious look, for he 
had been some time away. 

She understood it. â€” " He has been 
here," she said. 

" And you danced with him ?" 

Â« I did." 

" Where is he then now, that I don't 
see him with you ? Was it merely to 
fulfil his engagement with you that he 
made his appearance ?" 

" Don't be angry," said Adelaide, put- 
ting out her hand for the bouquet, which, 
in his extreme agitation, he thought not 
of giving to her, " but I must postpone 
the intended introduction yet a little 
longer." 

De Montville threw himself upon a 
seat. â€” " This is really using me very ill !" 
he said ; " it is trifling with me, in a man- 
ner I do not think I deserve. I am now 
convinced you never intended what you 
promised; that you all along had it in

contemplation to get me out of the way, 
at the time you expected this gentleman. 
But, depend upon it, I shall urge you no 
further on the subject." 

" Your reproaches are premature," said 
Adelaide ; " I repeat, most solemnly, that 
before you close your eyes this night, you 
shall learn what you desire ; and so pray 
throw off this moody look, that it may 
not be a subject for conversation. I have 
promised to dance the next set with my 
supposed beau, captain Elford ; and if you 
do not ask one of the graces, at least to 
dance with you, I am sure it will be taken 
in a strange light." 

" I am careless of that," was the reply ; 
and he allowed her to dance, set after set, 
without suffering himself to be induced 
to follow her example, so utterly discon- 
certed was he by the trick he conceived 
she had played him. 

The Miss Floyds were half inclined to 
be affronted ; but they would not yet de- 
spair of seeing him the avowed admirer of 
one or other of them ; if he did not distin- 
guish them, he also did not distinguish 



CONTRAST. 355 

any one else in the room, and there was 
some comfort in that. 

At length the assembly broke up ; Ade- 
laide was to sleep that night at the Floyds, 
and to return with them in the morning 
to the cottage, in the way to sir Edwin's, 
where the whole party were to dine. 

De Montville attended Adelaide from 
the rooms : just as they were on the point of 
parting, she drew him aside, and putting 
a small sealed packet into his hand â€” 
" There," she said â€” "when you open that, 
you will find I have redeemed my pro- 
mise, and given you a clue to every thing 
that has appeared perplexing;" and so 
saying, she kissed her hand to him, and 
hastily retreated into the hall. 

It may readily be believed, that De 
Montville did not linger by the way. 
Monsieur Frippon was on the watch, and 
informed him that his lordship had not 
yet retired to rest ; but, regardless of this 
intimation, he flew to his chamber, and 
bolting the door, to prevent any danger of 
intrusion, proceeded to tear open the 
packet â€” a letter with a broken seal drop- 
ped from it â€” he snatched it up, but it

was not to Adelaide â€” the direction was 
" II Signora Zerbino," and in his own 
hand ; in short, it was the letter which, in 
a fit of romantic enthusiasm, he had ad- 
dressed to this supposed victim of a bro- 
ther's tyranny. He eagerly opened it; 
but he found nothing within but simply 
his own offers of service ; no line, no re- 
mark from any other person. Oh ! if it 
should prove as was suggested, what a re- 
compence would this be for all the tortur- 
ing anxiety recently experienced! How 
could he rest a moment in doubt on the 
subject? and he was on the point of rush- 
ing from his chamber to go back to Mr. 
Floyd's, when the madness, with which 
he would assuredly appear seized, by act- 
ing in such a manner, checked him. But 
to think of retiring to repose, was out of 
question ; the night was now literally at 
odds with morning, and the short time 
that intervened till he could go out again, 
was^ occupied in changing his dress, and 
endeavouring to collect himself. 

After remaining on the rack of impa- 
tience, till he thought he might venture to 
Mr. Floyd's, or rather, till he heard the 



CONTRAST. 357 

people again beginning to stir in the 
street, he repaired thither; but no one 
but the servants were yet up. To leave 
the house without seeing Adelaide, how- 
ever, was out of the question ; so he pro- 
ceeded to the garden, there to await her. 
She had heard his voice, and either rest- 
less herself, or taking compassion on what 
she knew he must be enduring, did not 
long delay joining him. Anxious as was 
De Montville to see her, yet when he ac- 
tually beheld her approaching, he almost 
feared to meet her looks, lest he should 
read in them any intimation of disappoint- 
ment to the rapturous hopes he had been 
indulging. A glance, however, sufficed 
to dissipate all apprehension ; and with a 
transport too great for utterance, he caught 
her to his heart. Emotion a little sub- 
sided, " Well," said Adelaide, with one of 
those smiles that always enchanted -him, 
" I told you your reproaches were prema- 
ture, and by keeping my promise, you 
see I was correct, and that I am not the 
insincere creature you took me for." 

" Noâ€” but the enchanting one," cried 
De Montville, and he was ready to relapse

into those transports she had just with 
such difficulty checked. At length, cau- 
tioning him, that if he suffered himself to 
be hurried into any extravagance, her lips 
would instantly be sealed, she proceeded 
to give the particulars that were requisite 
to account for what was at present such a 
source of wild conjecture to him, not but 
that he at moments suspected the truth.

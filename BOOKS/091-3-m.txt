arms that the threats of their persecutor would not have been sufficient to deter them from returning instantly to Cracow, if it had not been for the strong ties by which they were bound to await the return ofGiovanno from Pans As Theresia had never received any of the former letters which they had sent her by the customary conveyance of the post-office, they sus¬ pected, as was really the case, that their malignant enemy had intercepted them, to prevent their friends from knowing where they were, and relieving their dist-essed situation fheirpeiseculor had constantly sent a messenger to the post-office at Cra¬ cow to ask for Theresia s letters, those which had tl e Genoese posf-maik on fhem he detained, but took care to forward all the rc«t unopened 1 his scheme prei ented Theresia from imagining that anv of her letters had been intercepted, and induced her to imagine eithei that the unfortunate Rosomaskis had pei tshed, or w ere so strictly watched,
watched that they could find no oppor¬ tunity of making their situation known to her Previously to Giovanno s setting out for Гаги, he had railed Rosomaski aside, and intreatcd him to execute a small commis¬ sion for him in his absence ' There arc,' said he, " two females in this city, a mother and a daughter, whom a tram of unmerited misfortunes have re¬ duced to depend on me for the principal part of their subsistence As my depa'turc from Genoa is so tmcvpected and at so late an hour, I have not been able to pro¬ vide against their wants during my absence. You may easily guess why I do not chuse to tontlde such in affair to so inrcneidcnte and wild a yoiinj, man as, I ain sorry to siy ny brother Justiniano ıs I trust to youi well known prudence and honom to supply them with whatever may be nece c - siry in my ibsencc After he had pointed out to Rosomaski the exact situition of the house where these persons

occupied by two females, and instantly flew Io communicate this intelligence to his patron, who received it with a most malignant satisfaction It brought with it a train of mischievous ideas, which aflorded food to his pangrened mind He thought that he had found a sure expedient of in¬ terrupting the Ininiony of Rosoma'ki and his wife, as the visits of the fonner were cai ned on mysteriously, and without the knowledge of the lattei, and of pushing on his own designs against the virtue of Rho¬ diska His plan was to metamorphose the youngest of these women into one of those unfoi tunate persons who haie become the victims of the other sex, and to transform the mother into one of those unpiineipled women who, swayed by gold, sell the honour of then children, and raise them¬ selv es a subsistence, without blushing at the infamous method by which it is obtained. The only diffici'lty would be to pass off this deception on Rhodiska, and to make her suspect hei husband's fidelity , but Gramani's
Gramam s invention was too fertile in ex¬ pedients of that kind, not to furnish him with the means of obtaining his ends He caused two letters to be written, by two females who were subservient to all his views One of these letters, which was to pass foi that ofthe daughtci to Kosomaski, was filled with reproaches for having made her poverty a step to her îuin, and accus¬ ing him of bung, of late, rathei remiss in h's attentions , the othei from the mother, contained demands of money, and menaces of divulging the secret to his wife, in case they were not immediately complied with These letters were to prove the intiiguc, the infidelity of Kosomaski, and the rapa¬ city of the mother Ihey were addressed to Count Kosomaski, and deliveied into the hands of Sardine, who, by means of a false ke), which he procured tobe made from a wax model of that of Rosomaskťs YrTitmg-desk, contrived to deposit them with his other papers, at a time when Koso¬ maski was absent, and when he had heard 5 him
hım desire Khodiska to answer a letter of Giovanno, which he had net then time to do liosomaski kept nothing concealed from Ins wife but his visits to the two lidies, which Giovanno had ( without mean¬ ing to include the Countess) desired him to mention to no one , he trusted her with all his affairs, and she perused all his papers In seeking for Gionnno's letter, which she was to answer, she was struck with beholding the superscription of two letters m unknown hands She perused them without hesitation, and was so sur¬ prised at what she siw, that imagining her eyes had decen ed her, she read them over again and again Although no doubts re¬ mained of her husband s infidelity, yet, in spite of the agitation into which this dis¬ covery threw her, she took a fnm resolu¬ tion of conreiling her chagrin within her own bosom, particularly from him who was the cause of it " If it is an en or, which does not pro¬ ceed from my having entirely lost his aflection,"
aflection," said she, " it will soon pass over If it be a passion in wlui h his heart is engaged, all the guel whuh I should discover, will not dimmish ils sticngth , on the contrary, my rcjn taches would delay if not* destroy all hopes of the re¬ turn of his affection, and his uiihappincss would increase mine If he does not loie me, he does not hate me and the surest wa) for а wife in my unfortunate condi¬ tion, to avoid hatred, is to await till his ìeason awake his slumbcnng virtue, and not to confirm him m open guilt by any symptoms of ill timed jealous) If she had nlnilv reflected thai as Ro¬ somaski knew tint she inspected all his papers and even wished she should do so, she would have conceived the improbabi¬ lity of his hai ing deposited tho e which he would hai e kept secret from her be) ond all the world, amongst the other papers to which she had daily access but Gramani was intelligent in the human heart, he was well awaie that eiery passion, and thai of jealousy
jealousy, above all otheis, was blind At all events, if the imposition should not pass upon Rliodis 1 a s penetration, he had wrapped himself up so securely, that it was nearly impossible that he shou'd be disco¬ vered as the author of this shocking attempt When the distressed Rhodiska had taken so prudent and geneious a resolution, she put the letters, the destroyers of h-i tran¬ quillity, into the place from whence she had taken them and had no sooner left the room than the peifidious ^ardine in¬ stantly took them away befe e the return of Rosomaski, so that he could have no suspicion of the base deception whuh had been passed upon Rhodiska, and conse¬ quently no opportunity of clearing up her unjust suspicions of his lidelify In spu« of the resolution with which Khodiska had determined to bear this dread¬ ful shock, she could not long withstand the cutting pangs which she endured from the loss of ,i husband s affections Till this fatal discoven , she had ever thought them vot ш e to
be unalienable The more she struggled to conceal her grief the more the wound rankled Melancholy s"ized her, and no¬ thing could divert her from the gloomy reflections to which she soon entirely gai e way Under pi etence of indisposition, she shut herself up in her chamber, and the smiles which formerly graced her features, were totally banished Rosomaski, alarmed at this sudden change, of which he could not possibly divine the cause, and which he therefore attribufed solely to ill health, redoubled his atten¬ tions and caresses, but far from alleviating Bhodiska's grief, they only rendered it niore violent she regarded them as so «lany deceptions, intended to disguise his real want of aflection foi her Gramani /did not fail to watch the progress of his baseness, he knew that a woman, once ¿offended, is prone to revenge, and his criminal desires were raised by expectalions ,of success He was assiduous in his atten tions to Rhodiska, and he was the only person
person from whose company she seemed to derive any comfort The idea which she entertained of the goodness of his heart, made her believe him her friend Many times was the secret which had poisoned her felicity, on fhe pomi of dropping from her lips, in confidence of his friendship, but as often did she letam it, either through unwillingness to betray the weak¬ ness of her husband, or through her feeling hurt af making a confession of her being neglected But, one day when Gramam surprised her with her eyes reddened by the tears which she had been shedding, h< pressed her so earnestly, and with so mich apparent concern for her interesi, to en¬ trust him with the cause of hpr gnei, taat he prevailed upon 'ier to arm him with those weapons with which he intended tc wound her still deeper Gramam s joy was so excessive, that his most consummate hjpoensy was needfp' 10 disguise it He alternately feigned - great surprise—a doubt—a wish to i<ideceivi e « her.
her, but alt the reasons which she gave for his doubts were so weak, as only to prove a greater certainty of the fact- He, at one time, expressed the firmest reliance on Rosomaski's honour, but immediately afterwards, he acknowledged that the let¬ ters were a strong proof of the contrary · at another, he pronounced it only a slight affair of gallantry, in which Kosomaskis passions, and not his affections, were en¬ gaged, and predicted his speedy ictuin to virtue, but, in the same bieith, he painted, m the strongest colours the sttong hold >hich women, like Rhodiskasmal, gene- ra'V obtained over the hearts of those men who haie been fatally ensnared by them In short ifter having corroborated Rho¬ diska s injurious suspicions in the most art¬ ful manner, and completed the distiaefion »f her senses by his double arguments, he ob» uned all that he could expect at that tn. e —her unbounded confidence She de- claret. h cr readiness to abide by his advice m this m»st delicate and trying conjuncture, and
and left tt o hım to disprove oe confirm her suspicions Gramam could not have rece» ed a moie agree ible commission and he promised to scrutinize Rosomabkis cominci wifh the utmosf exactness, am! to inform her of the result It was nccessaiy in fhe first place that Gramam should ascertain whether the ladies whom Rosomaski pmatelv visited, were of that vile description which he had caused then to represent m the forged letters, and he went that eiening in disguise, to the plice wheie Sardine had informed him they lived He made enquiries of all their neighbours respecting their appearance, mode of life, manneis—and the result was, that they were ι ery retired, frugal, peace¬ able persons whose character and conduct no one had the least îeason to impeach Graniani was, therefoie disappointed m his liru expectation of detecting the Count m a real mingue, but he had laid his schemes so as to obviate every probable s 3 obstacle.
obstacle Without hesitation, therefoie, when he came to give the melancholy Kho¬ diska an account of his discoveries, he described the mean apirtments of these ladies as an elegant suite of rooms, fitted up in supeib sti Ie, their humble dress was tiansformcd into a splendid wirdrobe, and (heir fiutai diet into a sumptuous table The characteis of the ladies he modelled so as to exictly suit the opinion which the blinded Rhodiska hid formed of them from the forged letters. but to make her despair of recovering the heart of her husband, he took care to draw the most ciptivattng portrait of her mal , he painted her as the most graceful and seducing figure he had ever seen By these falsehoods, the mon¬ ster planted daggers m the heart of Rho¬ diski, and made her imagine that her hus¬ band was the most criminal of men Besides his infidelity to herself, she now belieied him guilty of lavishing away the unlimited bounty of the generous Giovanno in hji unla л ful pleasures As
As one indiscretion commonly begets another Khodiska, un ib'e to support the oppressne weight of her imaginary suffer¬ ings, acquainted her ciuci enemy with her most intimate secrets She told him all the history of her past misfortunes with which he was already but too well ac¬ quainted , but hei most fatal slip was to let hiin know amongst the rest, the misery from which the benei ölence cf Giovanne had drawn them This last indiscretion augmented the joy and hopes of Giamani Like all the rest of tne world, he had till then imagined from the appearance and behaviour of the Rosomaskis, that they had been long acquainted with Giovanno, and were people of independeni fortunes, but he had no sooner extracted this last secret, than, confiding in his art to ruin this un¬ fortunate family at his pleasure, with their benefactor, Giovanno, he resolved fo be¬ come more boľd and open in his advances to Rhodiska His attention to her was e i more
more mmked, and his conversation less itrcumspcct " Your displea^ ireagainsí y our husband is just, ' said he, but y om yief ıs use¬ less he despises y ou, and ) ou should cease to esteem—to loie hım Nay, if your heait cannot be sitisfied without ıeıeııge, his conduct towards you nuthoiizcs every means you may thjnk propel to make use of He is tha only peison who does not ¿now the vainc of youi heart Whoever sees, admncsyou, your qualifications in¬ spire, and render it impossible to withstand the tenderest regard This language did not at first suiprise Rhodiska , she regarded it only as that of friendship too warmly ınteıested in her misfortunes, she thought Gramam too honest to enteitain any other view, but finding that he continually touched the same string, and that, m his conversation, he relaxed considerably from thai rigid system of morality which he had always been
been accustomed to piaise before her she beg-ţn to entertain some suspicions of mâ Invino; some particular designs Teirmg, therefore lest by listening to these insinu¬ ations any longer, she should not only give encoungement to him to carry them to ι greitei length but should seem to be plei&ed with them she resoli ed to takç the first opportunity of putting an end to them It soon arrived—On the \ery next in* tei view Giimant presuming on the im¬ prudent confidence of the unsuspecting Rhodiski renewed the subject with much less reserve than e\er but she cut him short at once and sud with ι look of offended prtdeand urfue— * I should undoubtedly think m)self insulted by your discoure if I thought you weit in earnest If you are not you will diop the hateful subject altogether if you value my esteem Leun to know my heart better thin to believe il capable of barbourmg a thought o£ revenge If my и 5 husband

JL IIĽ Countess ctel Piombino, without principles, wastheshve of all hei passions Through caprice she made choice of one gilhnt, and through ciprice she dismissed him for another Imagining that respect for her rank placed her above scandal, she did not even care to keep up appearances, she wished to shew herself above common prejudice, her manners were so irregula», that, in a less elevated station, she would have been the blush of Society. Her hus¬ band,
band, who was no less corrupt, paid no attention to her manners, and even autho¬ rized them by his own example Even Gramam, devoid of eiery grace, was not thought a conquest unworthy of her, and she had already made him such advances, as were best suited to destroy the respect due to her birth and rank Gramam, to shew himself worthy of her favours, flew to make known to her what he had just learned from Ithodiska, of Gio¬ vanno s generosity , and she immediately informed her husband and Justiniano, who happened to be with him, of this new dis¬ covery fhe Count and Countess; being both incapable of any generous, sentiment themselves, attributed the conduct of Gio¬ vanno to inteiest, and agi eed with Gramani that the daughters honour had paid the priée of the benefits which the father and mother had received, and that it was only to conceal the consequences that Giovanna had resolved to marry her Justiniano, who was not so destitute of virtue as to disbelieve
disbelieve its e-\istence in others, at first revolted at the idea of his brother s being capable of such conduct, but, inflamed as his heart was with passion,, his reason was easily overborne b/ the other associates, and he was com inced, by their arguments, that his success with Paulina would prevent his brother from the shame of marrying a dishonoured girl—or at least would rescue him, in case he had not triumphed over her virtue, from the imprudence of unit¬ ing himself to a family of which no person knew any thing, except what thev had pleased lo say of themselv es , for Gramam had, with his usual art, concealed from them that he had had any previous know¬ ledge of them, and that they were really what they had given themseï es ouï fo be of the noble fimilies of Rosomaski and Petrowitz Whilst new plots of destruction weie thus laying against the devoted Rosomaski, they were already so oppressed, that it would have seemed almost impossible to , have

adapt her for taking the part Besides, I ucinda had formerly belonged to the theatre, and was in the habit of affecting those feelings to which her heart was a stranger Gramani, therefoie, hastened to hei, acquainted her with the new part he had designed for her, gave her α lesson, and lehearsed it until he thought her suffi¬ ciently perfect Of old Signora Trom- pcttina, who served him in the capacity of di enna and housekeeper he created the mother , and as she was accustomed to appear in whatever shape her employers pleased, she was soon ready with her part She possessed a genteel carriage and grace¬ ful manners, which she had derived from a good education, afforded her by parcnls whose ashes she had disgraced The wait¬ ing-woman and valet next received their lessons for the ensuing day, and they all began to arrange their dresses, and put the house in order Gramani was exact to his appointment with Rhodiska, and he found her rcadv, and

took in the welfare of the unfortunate lihodiska Lucinda played her part admi¬ rably , she appeared to be touched, and discovered some emotion, even to the ap¬ pi) ing her handkerchief to her eyes, she tut ned aside her head, as if in confusion, and seemed to struggle betwixt passion and repentance At length, looking with as¬ sumed timidity at Rhodiska, she thanked her for the concern which she had disco- \cied for her unfortunate situation, and for the indulgence which she testified for her failings, of which she confessed herself unworthy She complained of the hard ness of hér fate, whtrh, in spite of her inclination, compelled her to be ungrate¬ ful —" Alas ι added she, sobbing vio¬ lently, " it was Giovanno, who, taking ad¬ vantage of the miserable situation of my mother, obtained from her thai consent which has reduced me to shame and infamy When this cruel, perfidious man abandoned me, if it had not been for the pity of your husband, I should hav e been the sad victim of
of treachery, and the sport of libertines I owe him ever) thing How can I after so many benefits, repay his generosity by the blackest ingratitude—pierce his heait with the keen weapon of desp ur ?

she had endiucd before she could be brought to consent to hei dishonour, she invoked the «intics of her ancestors, and deprecated their anger, at the weakness with which she had permitted the purity of their blood to be polluted. The wrath of heaven was not forgotten, and she made a solemn promise to take every means of bringing back her diughter to the paths of virtue, fiom which she had strayed, and to sacrifice every thing to the repose of her conscience, und the honour of her child This was the end of so extraordinary a farce, and Rhodiski departed, satisfied with the apparent contrition of the pretended daughtci, and henest assunnccs of the mother Hope, how trifling soever it be, is a ïe- Jief to an aflhcted mind, and suspends its guef Rhodiska, deceived by the harangue of Signoia Irompettina, found in it a fiuit- ful sumce oi consolation * lhere are yet, ' said she to Gramam, as they were returning home, " some pinieiples

A NOTIILR reason for Gramani s wishing to get nd of Lucinda was, that he wanted his country house for those little cvcur- sions which he had been for ■ ime davs in the habit of makine, with the Countess del Piombino \n intimacy with ν tee desti oy s allsensibiliti of binine Women who die id it whilst th-y keep in the road of virtue, have moie intrepidity when thev „tn) out of it that timidity so natural to the sex, is enti el) lost ν ith the modesti and ie-, stramt whu h aie then create t ornaments they (hrov off file mW sacrei duties, tiample on the laws of society and decency, г 4 and
and despise the dictates of honour and reli gion The Countess had arrived at tin point, and Gramam no sooner made het the proposal of visiting his rural retreat than she readily accepted it, and would have put it into execution on that very day They had scaicely reached the house befoic the Count del Piombino, to whom Gramam had, in one of their revels, given a key of it to use at his pleasure, entered, bringing with him another lady The sight of his wife m such a place neither gave him surprise no' anger The Countess, no less bold, bore the shock of thiB unforeseen accident without shewing the least symp¬ toms of confusion, she received her hus¬ band with the same ease as she would have done if he had been one of her party The ease of this polite couple restored to Gramam that which he had lost through surprise and fear The Counts mistress, no tess daring than the rest, accosted the Countess with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance, and was received as such They
They were laughing and jesting on the oddness of theii rencounter, wlien the arrival of Gramani's wife put an end to this scene of mirth, and rendered this tem¬ ple of pleasure the held of as bloody a battle as could be expected from such sort Of combatants. Signora Gramani had long lost all those youthful graces which inspire the other sex with desire ; but being weary of a widowed pillow, she had pitched upon Gramani, who was youthful and athletic, to be the partner of the rest of her days. Gramani, who, at that time, was not rich, very rea¬ dily agreed'to exchange his liberty for the widow's gold, of which she had a great store ; but he had hot long possessed him¬ self of the latter before he began to re¬ claim more of the former than his wife liked. She found herself neglected—be¬ came suspicious, and her suspicions were too just not to lead to a discovery of her. husband's infidelity. - ' As Gramani had not long been possessed; f S ol
of his cotintrv-house his wife had never known any thing of it till this very day, which was to be remai kable for odd meet¬ ings, when passing before the dooi by chance, she perceived at the door one of his servants, who was known to be the minister of his pleasures Het slumbeiing suspicion was rou?ed, and she imagined that she should have an oppoituiuty of de¬ tecting and repioaclunghei faithless spouse She stopped the carriag , quitted it, and pushed ν lolenth by lhe sen ant, who en- deavomed m vam to stop her entr ce fhe mirth of the company within the house soon conducted her to the door of the apartment from whence the soundi issued She opened ic and dtsaveicd the happy purr; quarre m the height i then icvelry She was almost choakc I with passion—hci eyes sparkled with Itiry— she stro\ e to speak, but uttered only sonie hoaise maiticiihte sounds like the 1-cilo.vmg oí ai emaged bull she acted like one too, by upsetting «11 that came ш ier way li» a minute, 3 (mintine,

The Countess, who was flying to his assistance, instantly shared the same fate, and was ex¬ tended by the sije of Grammi. The Count, seeing his wife's disgrace, was eager to îevenţc it: he sci/ed the opportunity, when bigiioia Cia'iiaiii was stooping down to pick up the weapon which had dropped fiom her hand, to leap upon her back, and endeavour to pinion her poweiful and dreaded arms ; but she rose аь soon as she felt her unusual burthen, and by a quick iiiotijii, pitched him Iiead foremost to the ground, where she would have given him some further chastisement, if she had not Ш ÍP pispare fur another antagonist, vyho r 6 was

with the fatigue of the day She bawled aloud for her coachman and footman to come to her assistance they heard her, and wanted to enter but Signora Trom¬ pettina with the gardener, cook and scul¬ lions guarded the passage Another battle now took place at the door, and the noise caused а cessation of arms between those within At length the besieging party, being reinforced by the passengers broke open the door forced the passage way, drove Irompettina and her party before them and the whole together rushed into the apartment where hostilities had com¬ menced Both sides being now reinforced, the engagement might have been renewed with increased ν igour if it had not luckily happened that the field of battle was so much thronged that there was no room for the manoeuvres of the hostile parties Signora Gramam whose ear gave her pro¬ digious pain and the thoughis of noi hav¬ ing inflicted vengeance on the author still more, was indignant at this state of mac tivity

This billet wrs put into the hands of Agatha, who, after having read it, gave it to her young mistiess After concerting between them for sometime, the following answer was returned

She was touched with his situation, and said to him—" Be composed : —no person but my young mis¬ tress and myself knows what has passed ; keep your promise, and ail will be for¬ gotten." A criminal, condemned to death, does not receive a rejiricve with a more heart¬ felt joy than Justiniano felt at this assu¬ rance.

indeed," said she, " into this mystery this anonymous letter has caused your long absence ' Ludowico nodded an affirmalive, and piocecdcd to gne hei an account of all that had happened to him since his leaving them at Vistulof fhercsn told him that she had always believed Doiothea's letter to be worthy of the utmost contempt and she could not peistndo hcr-.ell that those whom it chiefly comei ned, could eier have viewed it m any other light She con¬ fessed that slie had taken great pains to áiscover if be were fêiiÜy the counter's" Iltigonner not to satisfy herself, but his friends at Genoa of his strict honour —" I have neiei," added she somewhat blush¬ ing, " failed to entertain such an opinion of it, as nothing but a demonstration of the ronfiar) could hai e shaken ' Ludowico expressed the highest sense of gratitude for her confidence m hım, and derhted his resolution of leaving Cracow the neu morning, on his ro,ite to Genoa Theiesia
Theresia was very much d sconcerted at «his intention, and endeavoured to-divert him from it, by telling hun that he would probably lose his journey, as she had taken care to remit the Rosoma«kis α consideiable sum of money, which she had in her hands belonging to them, and had every reason to expect that they would lose no time in returning to Cracow, afterthey should have learnt tha« she had recovered then son Ladislaus " " By what strange event has that been brought ab -ми î" said Ludowico " Has Mrs, Vendor been struck with remorse î for I am persuaded that the child whom I saw at her house waä Ladislaus " " You are not mistaken," replied The¬ resia, and she made him the recital of the melancholy catastrophe of that mv happy woman Ludowico observed, that it was very un¬ fortunate that the parents should have been snatched away on the eve of regaining their lost treasure, and repeated his resolution to
to commence lus journey to Cracow on the ensuing morning, to hasten their return, and to be at hand to protect them on the road from any fuither attempts of their in¬ visible and implacable enemy The latter part of this intention some¬ what reconciled Theresia to the former " I trust fo you to hurry them away fiom Genoa," said she, " and I beg yon to tell them that I shall count every mo¬ ment an age till I see them again But you will not travel alone î You must be aware that we are watched by this fiend-like enemy of the Rosomaskis as he knows what comfort and assistance they will de- live from your presence, he will take every step to prevent your coming together agam —Ah ' if you should fall into some new snare, I shall be miserable—since I know it will make our friends so ' If Ludowico had not been impenetrably blind, or absolutely convinced that The¬ resia was indifferent to all his sex, it was impossible but he must have discovered something
something in her speech of a more than common solicitude for his own safety, not¬ withstanding the finesse with which she attempted to turn it off by a little detour She would not have been sorry if she had opened his eyes a little on the change which he had operated in her, but he continued in darkness, and she could not prevail upon herself to advance another step to enlighten him He merely replied, that he would take such precautions as should foi once baffle then lyn^-eyed enemy They then took Iea,ve of each other, and the rising sun beheld Ludowico on the road to Genoa

1 HE Rosomaskis now wanted little other addition to then happiness than the return of iheir benefactor Giovanno, whom they most impatiently expected Rhodiska's fit of jealousy had almost totallv subsided, and Paulina was not only overjoyed to witness her mothers conialesconce, but she was gratified to see the alteration in the beha¬ viour of Justiniano, who saw her seldom, and then always treated her with that re- epect which was due to the intended wife of his brother The Piombinos, too, in order to blind their victims, expressed their hopes to congratulate them veiy soon
on the return of Giovanne, and talked of the marriage between him and Paulina as a matter perfectly well understood Hát¬ tered by these hopes, the so long unfor¬ tunate Rosotraskis began to have a distant gleam of happiness before them, which would have been nearly complete, if all doubts of Ludowico s conduct had been satisfactorily explained 1 о be obliged to enteitäni the most distant doubts ofthe sincerity of the friend of his youth, and the son of his preserver, stuck like а barbed arrow in the breast of Kosomaski It has been mentioned that the suite of rooms which the Rosomaskis occupied, were detached fiom the mam body ofthe house, and separated from it by a garden The situation of this garden was delightful, as it affoided a view of a considerable part of the suburbs of the city, and an uninter¬ rupted prospect over the whole of the bay Kosomaski and Rhodiska passed the greater part of every fine day under the shade of some chesnut trees, in enjoying the scenery, the
the marine pait of which was peifcctly noi cl to them, who had never before wit¬ nessed any thing of the kind on a larger scale than that which the banks of the nar- low, winding Vistula alTorded them The arms of the bay, spreading till they ap¬ pealed to lose themselves in the vast ex panse of the Mediterranean, the innume¬ rable vessels which glided past, bound to some furtbei port, and moved along the horizon like faint, distant clouds, those others, which were bound up to Genoa, and as they appioached, seemed to rise from the bosom of the waters, and then Ily majestically over their surface, the humble barks which flitted about them in all directions, obedient to the oars of the labouring watermen, whilst the sea-fowl, now skimming the water, and now soaring aroft in elegant curves and spiral lines, hovered around them, like curious specta¬ tors of those daring inv aders of their other element —all these scenes combined af¬ forded them new and grand sensations, vol ш и which
which they were now sufficiently easy u their minds to enjoy Paulina, also, passed the greater pai t of the day m the garden, but her favourite time was when the sun s glaring light had given way to the milder influence of the moon and the busy sons of commerce had suspended their labours, only to resume them again with increased vigour at its return These softer scenes were better suited to her piesent disposition as they did not disturb her visions of expected happiness Often when looking at fhe moon would she be pleased to think thaf probably Giovanno was hastening home wards with an impatience equal to her own and was at ihat moment beholding the veiy same object— If there be a sympathy in souls, she would say, · the» will his be acf ing m unison wilh mine, and enjoying the same meditations These reflections soothed her mind and yielded her а serenity which shielded it from the agitation of impatience 4r As
As every tresh-coming day brought with it a more than ordinary degree of expec tation, Paulina would seldom withdraw to her apartment till theie weie no hopes of seeing Giovanno that night It could not well be said that she then retired to rest, it was only to converse with Agatha con¬ cerning him, and to be again buoyed up with hopes of happiness on the ensuing day Another day had passed, as the former ones, in disappointment Evening came, and the moon again beheld her votary at her usual post in the garden, which was a sure proof that Giovanno was not returned The evening almost πι ailed the splendour of the brightest day , the wide expanse of water, unruffled by rude winds, and no longer furrowed by the dashing keels, seemed to have formed its equilibrium only one small bark disturbed its repose, and that was hastening towards the part of the shore nearest to the garden, as if to Jay lip for the night и 2 The
The drooping maid sat motionless, and any one who had seen her in that situation, would have taken her for an ornamental statue At length, the breeze made a rustling noise amidst the foliage, she turned her head in the direction of the path which ied from the main bodv of the house—she stood up to see whether any light passed or there was any extraordi 1 · nary mo\ cmcnt to flatter hei hopes there was nothing of the kind She sat down again, and leclined her head on her hand After some little interval, she raised her head—looked at the moon—sighed, and, in a low, tremulous, plaintive tone, began to warble an Italian air She had just finished the last strain, and the querulous notes still sounded on the breeze which seemed to bear them away, when she felt herself rudely seized from behind, het arms pinioned to her sides, and a bandage placed over her mouth, before the shock, which sent the blood mantling to her heart, would allow her to give an alarm.
alarm A cloak was then thrown all oier her, so that she could see nothing, and she was lifted from the giound, and rapidly carried to some little distance By the motion of the person who bote her which then became cautious and slow, like that of one who ciiried ι heivy burthen up stairs, she conci ided they were getting over the garden walk by a hdder With¬ out dreading any consequence to herself, she began to stiuggle, in hopes of both falling together to the ground, or of com¬ pelling the ruffian, to let her go, but his nerves bespoke him a descendant of Her¬ cules Paulina was convinced that she was right m her conjecture, when she perceived that he soon afterwards appealed to de¬ scend Hapless innocence '—to cry out wis impossible—to struggle, vain ' lhe ruffians again went on rapidly for some time after a small pause, the one who held Paulina went on with caution, and presently seated himself, still holding her fast in his arms Aftei another short h 3 interval,
interval, the motion of putting oft" a boat from the shore, and the noise of the sound¬ ing oars, gave her to uiideistaitd that she was bunched on the water It was the case, and she wis in that veiy bark which, only some lew minutes before had engaged her wandering eves Aftei an hour s pas¬ sage the baik agiin struck the shore Pau¬ lina wis landed, and put into a carriage, v.hich waited on the beach for thepurpose of receiving her, and started with all the rapidity that four excellent horses could give it, and the road would permit All the fortitude which hid hitherto suppoited Paulina now vanished, and she ffell senseless on the seat of the с image When she came to herself agun, her ears were saluted with the noise of blanches of trees striking against the glass windows as the carriage passed rapidly by them Her apprehensions were increased by knowing that she wis m the midst of a forest, she dreaded lest the frightful silence of the wood should add to the boldness of her raviahers
¿vishets Iler agitation shook her so Ireadfully, that hei yıaıds were ahrmed kst lhe bandage should siilloejte hci, and ihev removed it Not a word was spoken by either of ihcm, and Paulina also leniained as still as if she hid not yet recovered hei sens s, thinking it the best way to aioid any n 1- inednte outrage As they left the wood, the light of the moon penetrated the carriage Paulina, tearfully casting up her eyes, saw before her a man, whose hard and ferocious fea¬ tures added to her terror, and only gave her more repugnance to look at the other who sat beside him At length, curiosity to know who were the authors of her mis¬ fortune prevailed, and casting a glance with the rapidity of lightning on the other ruffian, she beheld another figuie no less shocking than the foi mer, but both were equally unknown to her At length, assuming a little more cou¬ rage, she addressed them m the most moving и i strams.
strains and intreatcd to know why thej oflered her this violence, and under whose oitlers they acted?—blither prayers and fears were without success—she might as well have addressed herself to two statues Alter awhile she peiceived lrom the jolting ol the carriage and the noise which the wheels made, that tney weie in a main load The hope of passing through some village wheie she might draw the inhabi¬ tants fo her rescue bv her cues, began to give some little consolation to her wounded mind The better to deceive her Arguses, she feigned to be moie tranquil, and en¬ deavoured to inspire them with a confi¬ dence which she might turn to her a Wan¬ tage Peicenmg lights at a distance, her hearf beat, and leaped for joy But this satisfaction was only of short duration, before th»y reached the dwellings whence the lights proceeded her guards leplaced the b indole oiei her mouth, let down the caimgebhrds and fook those precautions which convinced her that they were very far
far from slumbering in that security which she wished When they had passed beyond the houses the bandage was again removed After having travelled sotnt time longer, without meeting with any inhabited place, Paulina again discerned lights ata distance, and seeing that she approached them by degrees without her guards thinking of re-* placing the bandage, she secretly congra¬ tulated herself, and thought their prudence had failed them She breathed as gently as possible, not to bung to their recol¬ lection that she was in existence, and to draw them fi om the apathy m which they seemed buned She was preparing to make use of the liberty which they gave hei, tviten she percened the wheels ol the cainage move bghtlv over a diawbndge the el inking of the chains,· which she heard α moment aftei, gave hei to undeistand tint they had raised it the instant the car¬ nage pa^ed oier, and that she was at length ai rived at her pnson Viola that moment, all the courage which she had u ä assumed
assumed forsook her, and gave place to despondency and the most dicadful alarms Her guards seized her, more dead fhan alive, and carried her into the intenoi of the house she was carried into an apart¬ ment, notier) spendidly noi superfluously fmnished, but very well lighted Three women made then appearance, and in¬ formed her that they were ordered to wait upon her Stupified with hoi ror, Paulina imagined, that the respect which these women paid her, was onl) a refinement of barbarity, and tint he who had laid this horrid plot, of which she was to be the victim, was about to appear and undeceive hei, in the most cruel manner In order to try what powei she had over her pretended attend¬ ants, as well as to give vent to her dis- traeled mind, she desned tobe left alone, and she had scaicel) pronounced the words before she was obeyed—" Alas '" cued she, ' what security is there m this trea¬ cherous respect ' Ought it not, on the contrary,
contrary to assure me that they think me perfectly secure and do not dread any of my efforts to escape ? As it was impossible to entertain a thought of sleeping Paulina threw herself into α chair and fell into the most gloomy reveries in dreadful expectation every moment of seeing the author of this horrid mancemre make his appearjnee but the night passed over without the least dis turbarne ïf it was а dreadful night foi Paulina it was no less so for her parents Agatha had wailel for Paulini long beyond the usual tune she was almost overcome with want of sleep and she expected thai Pau¬ lun would keep her awake an hour or Iwo aftei she entered her apartment in con¬ vention respecting Giovanno as usual Hci patience was at len a th exhausted she vvciit into the garden—she searched every part of it without success—she began to call in a low tone of voice at first to avoid giving any alarm to Rhodiska and в 6 Rosomaski
Rosomaski her fears increased and the name of Paulina ran » through every part of the garden—but with no better success Agatha then grew frantic and burst into the apartment of Rhod ska and Rosomaski, fo fell them the fatal news Rosomaski instantly et essed himself and nn through the garden—Paulina was not there He alarmed the domestics in the main body of the house but she was not there The garden was again searched but there were no traces whateier to lead to any discoveiy of this horrid mystery Rhodiska was wimgn g hei hands in all the agony of the most direful apprehensions and Rosomaski endeavoured to console hci by telling her that »s ti e city fcates were locked, and no one suffered to pass till two hours after daybreak it would be impossille tha Pau lina could be carried off befoie thai time if any such attempt had been made and that he would not nly саше all the out lets from the city to be watched but every part of the interior tobe seaiched, till she wa»
was recovered Rosomaski then left Rho¬ diska, a little composed by his assurances, to go and put these measures into effect His first step was to rouze Gramam whom he thought to be his friend, and, as a magistrate^ the propcrest person to gnc him odvire and assistance in the present emergency Gramam dcchied his utmost readiness ίο lend every assistance in his power ; and, diessmg himself, herouzed thesbiin, and ordered two of them to watch at each gate of the citi, and to stop any carriage which should contain a young female of Paulina s description, which he gave them, the rest were ordered to make a strict search throughout the city When these steps had been taken, Gra¬ mam asked Rosomaski if he could n ν lus suspicions upon any person as likely fo commit such an outrage as the carrvmg off his daughter? " No one," replied Rosomaski ' Is
" Is there any one who has had access to ţhe house in Giovanne s absence ?" " Only his brothei ' Gramani appeared lost in thought for some moments, and then asked Rosomaski if Justiniano had been acquainted with this affair " No," replied Rosomaski, *' but I in¬ tend to do so, and to desire his inteiest and assistance " Gramani appeared once more plunged m reflection, and muttered soine unintel¬ ligible sentences, such as—" He is a liber¬ tine, but he has a good heart m the main ' __" Respect for his brother '—" Chaiac- tei "—" No, it cannot be, '—and then ad¬ vised Rosomaski to go to hun immediatelv He, moreover, promised, that if Paulina was not found before the next noon, he himself would scour all the siurounding country to gam intelligence of her Rosomaski went to Justiniano's lodgings, and was informed that he had not been at home
home that night neither the sentences muttered by Gramam, nor this last cir¬ cumstance, made Rosomaski entertain the slightest suspicions of the honour of Gio¬ vanno s brother He returned home, and found Agatha, m the phren?y of distrac¬ tion, at that moment ι elating the late mid¬ night attempt of Justiniano upon Paulina She closed her narrative by exclaiming—· " Ah, God help me '— they are not all hrdbofafeatliei thatarejrearedmonenM'" This narrative, coupled with what had dropped from Giamani, а'н! Justiniano s absence, brought suspicions of the latter into Rosomaskt's breast, he would line been less uneasy, if he had been assured of Justiniano'» guilt, as he knew that p aulma would prefer death to dishonour , and judged that Justiniano might be induced, by the fruitlessness of his attempts, to re¬ turn to a proper respect for the intended wife of his brother With the greatest difficulty he prevailed upon Rhodiska to go to her cliambci, and to endeavour to compose
compose herself with the assurance that every thing had been and would be done, to restore her Paulina to her arms Rosomaski again went out w ithout know¬ ing whither—paraded every street—stop ped at each house where he could perceive the least moiement and Scrutinized e cry person who was abroad at that unseasonable hour in hopes to see 01 heai something of his Paulina lihodiska retued lo her chamber but let those who have e\pe nenced an excess of trouble and affliclion, recall to their remembrance one of those nights when the bitterness of the binning tears which oveiflowcd their eyes removed sleep to a distance from them—when na ture exhausted solicited that repose whtch was denied to it let them retra e the hor rible visions with which their imagination tormented them—and they will form an idea of the manner in which lihodiska passed the remainder of the night The day broke in upon Paulina ind discovered her ·> piey to the most racking sensations
sensations Two hours afterwards, one of the women entered, and asked if she wanted my thing ?—a negative shake of the head was her only answer Sometime afterwards, the women igain entered, to know if she would choose breakfast ? Paulina sighed, lifted up her eyes, bathed in tears, towards Heaven, and intieated to be lelt to herself About the middle of the dav, all the three women (for none of the other se\ made their appearance) came in and served up a tunner, composed of a ■'г -'e'y of deli¬ cacies, which Paulina ıegarded with an eye of disgust The women moved the table towards the chair, which she had neier quitted since she first sat down in it, and pressed her, m the most obliging manner, to take some nourishment After being repeatedly pressed, she determined to eat a little When she had finished her s'ight repast, she again desired to be left itone —she was instintly obeyed Her reflections then became
became more poignant alone—without help—without hope, what could she op¬ pose to the infamous designs which she could not help imagining were intended against her? Surrounded by enemies, ob¬ served by mistrusfful spies she no longer legarded herself but as a victim devoted to the violence of the wretch who would un¬ doubtedly make her pay dearly for the repose which he appeared to let her enjoy Every hope of escape was fled Could she flatter herself that amidst the Ef'el'iies of a wietch hired to guard her, there could be found a heart susceptible of pity for her situation? Could they have been cor¬ rupted by gold, the trifle which she had about her was very insufficient to tempt servants whom a powerful and pıodıgal master employed to favour his cumes. Despair deprived her of her remaining strength Plunged into a languid 4 despon- dency, she scarcely preseived the free use of her reason, which might become so necessary
accessary to her, and was on the brink of that fatal torpidity which might have so well served the views ol her ravisher Towards the evening, the women re¬ turned, and conducted her into an inner chamber, intreatcd her to take some re pose, and offered their services to undress her This circumstance awakened her from the fatal lethargy, and brought back all her eneigy She ordered the women to leave her, with a tone of authority which surprised them. they endeavoured to calm. her, and to dissipate the fears with which they saw she was agitated, but neither their representations nor remonstrances could produce any effect on he·· resolute spirit. At length, finding that their presence only increased her transports, they left her, after having shewn her that she might shut her¬ self in, by some bolts which weie inside the door The instant they were gone, Paulina hastened to take the hint which they had given her, and when she was assured there was
was no other entrance into the room, and thai the door was secured, she experienced rather more case She then visiled evei y corni r —sciutini7ed the partitions and the boards of the floor nothing occurred to give her any suspicion ol а concealed opening Lvery thing was formed m the most simple style, there was not a single cornice nor ornament which could mask а secret communication, the whole was so very plain, that the slightest and best- formed c h nk n 'h s weld might have been easily discerned Having thus, as she thought, assured her¬ self against a surprise, she placed herself at the onlv window which wasin the room, and presently heard the doors at the end of the gallenes closed, one after the other She tien bled when she was thus separated fiom all soi tety , she saw the lights extinguished in evciy window, and the most profound silence reigned m eı ery part The night was very daik, and fui some time Paulina pei ceivednootherobject than the refleclion of
of her own light against the opposite wall, but she felt no inclination to change her situation At length she thought she heard a noise beneath her window, somewhat resembling that of a person walking through long grass She listenet' with the utmost atten tion, but the noise had reased, and the darkness would have prevented her seeing, if any one had been there she was on the point of thinking that she had been de¬ ceived, when some person coughed gently Being then convinced that there was some one below, having nothing more to fear, and hoping for some relief, she stood up, and endeavoured to open the window, but it mocked all her efforts Presently a soft voice, like that of a femile, distinctly pro- I nounced these words— " Beware of sleep- , ing, or you are lost Fear not—I shall be with you in the momeilt of danger Paulina was seized with an involuntary I trembling, she would have replied, but the
the rustling of the grass gave her to under¬ stand that the person who had spoken was gone, and that she was to expect no other explanation. The darkness, which had produced no effect upon her before, now began to ter¬ rify her, she shivered as she heard the hoarse winds bending the tops of the sturdy trees at a distance, and the flapping oi the wings of the birds of night, which every now and then shuck against the glass, gave her to believe that the " mo¬ ment of danger" was arrived Nearly two hours passed in this agonizing suspense, when she heard the same voice, which now appealed to issue from beneath the floor, exclaim—" Hasten—carry your light into the next chamber, and remain there till I call you " Surprised, and almostpetntied, she looked round, and could not conceive whence the voice issued She remained motionless, without knowing on what to resolve '* You
" You hesitate," cried the voice, in a more imperious tone than before, " one minute more, and it will be too late " Determined by this authoritative tone, she took the light, and tremblingly obeyed She listened attentively, in the most anxi¬ ous suspense, to know how this adventuie would terminate, and thought she heard some movement in the chamber which she had just quitted She was wondering how any one could have entered it, when her ears were assailed by a long and mournful groan, like that of a man who breathed his last sigh Instantly she heard the same voice call her by her name She hesitated to move till it was repeated, and then taking up her lamp with an aguish hand, she entered the inner room in the most inexpressible consternation , her trembling limbs could scarcely support her, and her distracted eyes distinguished objects very confusedly " Approach.' said the voice, " and be¬ hold our common enemy—he has paid the forfeit of his crimes " Casting
Casting a fearful look at the bed, she beheld a man lying on his face, bathed in blood, and near hiin a young female, who still held in her hand the crimsoned poni¬ ard with which she had given him the fatal blow.

It may be icadilj believed that Ciovanno was not very well pleased with his having fallen flito suih company, and that he would have piefeired lemanung under the canopy of heaven dun ig the night, to finding a ihel- ter beneath a roof with such guests he was equally alı aid to remam, or to depart, as
as they might easily pursue and overpower him in the mountains Whilst he wasiu- minating on the best method of extncating himself fiom this dilemma, he was all at once aroii7cd fiom his reiene by the civi¬ lity of one ol these persons who diank to the eiy good health of Signoi the tia- vellei Giovanno thought piopei to re¬ turn the salute m а frank and familial manner lhe same peison then addressed himself m a sunilai manuel to anothei guest who had hithei to escaped Giov anno s notice and who only returned the courtesy by а nod of his head, without utteuog a single woid The appeal ance of this latter peison was -qually singtilai as that of the other guests but vastly diOerent, the lines of his face were stron„ly maiked, and α physiognomist would have augured unfa- vouiably of his disposition fiom them His dress was a dark green flock, and panta¬ loons of the same colour, with Hussar boots anda scymetar hung by ins side it appeared to Giovanno to be the militai у uniform
rimform of some foreign country, foi he had seen none of his own that resembled it his cloak, which was of grey cloth, trimmed with fur,.bespoke him as baung come from the North , and from his pro¬ found taciturnity, Giovanno concluded that he was ignoiaiit of their language To assure himself whether it was so or not, Gionnno addicssed him m Italian, and asked him which way he was travelling ? but, to his suipnse, the stranger smiled, and leplied thai he came from Russia, and was on his route to the city of Genoa and after haimg expressed his pleasure that he had fillen in with some one with whom he could converst, he asked Giovanno the same question, who replied that he was on his ι oute fiom Paris to Genoa, his na¬ tive place, and as he presumed he had never been ш the latter city, he made him the otTei of his house and his services during his stay theie lo this friendly cfľei the stianger made a suitable reply, and
and a general conversation ensued between them It was not long, however, before they were interrupted by the other guests, who oflered to accompany and conduct them safely across the mountains, and to defend them fiom robbers and assassins Giovanne thanked them for then offer, but declined it, alledging that he had little to lose, and harbouied no apprehensions of an attack. He added, taking out his purse, that he had only thirty ctowns left, the half of which would be more than sufhcicnt to cairv hnn to Genoa, where he lived, and they were welcome to the other hal!, if it would con¬ tribuie towards their mirth They readily accepted the offer which Giovanno made in order to leai e them no temptation fo plun¬ der , and taking up the hfteen crowns, they renewed their proposal of acting as guides and protectors, in retui n for so much generosity, but Giovanno told them that he had no intention to depart that night, and
and he would consider whether or not he should accept their seruces in fhe morn¬ ing With this answer they appeared per¬ fectly satisfied, and again fell to carousing As they were very intent on the business in hand, and extremely vociferous, Gio¬ vanno, perceiving there would bc no dan ger oí being overheard, demanded of the traveller (who called himself Dolgorucki, what was his opinion of their companions? Dolgorucki replied, that, not knowing a single word of their conversation, he had been able to judge them only from then appearance and manners, which were sus¬ picious enough to make him wish to be fairly rid of them Tomaso had entered just at this moment, and hearing what had been the subject of the conversation, he immediately cleared up their apprehensions in great measure, by informing them that, whilst he had been rubbing down the horses, he had entered into conversation with the ostler, who was employed in a similar man¬ nier in taking care of the horses of the iest vol ш L oí
of the guests, and had learned from him that they were unlicensed dealers (smug¬ glers), who went about thus disguised and armed, to escape the prying eyes of the custom-house officers and sbirri, and to defend ihemselves m case of an attempt to sei7e their contraband goods Although Gioianno was extremely glad to find they were no worse, yet even that vías bad enough, to make him wish himself at a distance from them, he dreaded lest the liquor might inflame their natural fero¬ city, and create some dispute, in which every one present might be involved He mentioned th s apprehension to Dolgo¬ rucki, and proposed to him to concert to¬ gether some method of slipping away un¬ observed by them Dolgorucki, after some little hesitation, said, that as they were smugglers, they would in all probability set off about their concerns when the night grew more advanced, and as the moon would be up, they themselves might take the opportunity of setting out soon after the
the coast was clear, by which means they should get across the mountains before their troublesome guests could come back Giovanno relished this scheme exceedingly, and ordered Tomaso to feed the horses very well, and refresh them in the best manner for resuming their journey in an hour or two, without saying a word of their intention The smugglers stuck to their bottle with the utmost pertinacity, and Giovanno re¬ marked, to his new companion, on the ex¬ cessive pleasure which they appeared to derive from their tumultuous merriment and drunken debauchery, in spite of all the dangers to which their mode of life neces¬ sarily exposed them " Those dangers are the very cause of it, ' replied Dolgorucki, " drmking is the failing of men whose lives are chequered by vicissitudes of toil and ease, danger and pleasure It u habitual to soldiers, sailors, and to those who live by the chase, as we learn by the American Indians, who, in ь 2 their
their grand huntings, which are in the depths of a hyperborean wintei, encoun¬ ter the most excessive hardships, and after¬ wards think to recompense themselves by bartering their furs for spirituous liquors they find in them a temporar) relief from past fatigues, and drown all sense of dan¬ gers m these Lethean draughts As their lues ire only held by ι most precarious tenure, they lesoit to those means which will put them in the speediest road to pleasure, and has mg imagined they have found them in stiong liquors, they neglect no opportunity of enjoying them ' " Your observition is certainly just," said Giovanno , " sobriety is, I believe, an artificial virtue, depending more on situation than on temperament or charac¬ ter Ihose who aie never appalled by danger, nor exhausted b) fatigue, whose lives are one continued monotonous ease, know not the joys of deliverance, or of repose But I fear lest those people will be so very assiduous in forgetting past dangers,
dangers, that they will totally unfit them¬ selves for new ones, and be incapacitated for a nocturnal ramble, at least for this night " " They know very well what they have to do," replied Dolgorucki, " and you need not be appiehensive of their neglect¬ ing it " Dolgorucki was perfectly right in his opinion about an hour afterwards, they heard a whistle from the outside of the house, and every one of the smugglers cried—" To horse '"—and starling up, emptied the bottles which were before them, as they waited for their horses to be led out After having wished Giovanno a good night, and told htm they should await his commands in the morning, they all dis¬ appeared In a few minutes they were mounted, and rode off After they had been gone about half atı hour, Giovanno asked what sort of weather it was, and being told that it was a beau¬ tiful night, and the moon shone very ь 3 bright.
bright, he summoned the landlord, and in¬ formed him that as he wanted to be in Genoa eaily on the next day, he had altered his resolution of tarrying the night, and should instantly set out again, so soon as the horses could be got ready The landlord made a great deal of the danger of their losing themselves in the mountains, and of their meeting with the banditti, but Giovanno answered, that they should run greater risk from the banditti by day, as they would not think of meeting with travellers so late at nigbt besides, by daybreak, they should bave got beyond the mountains, and be out of their reach—he therefore desired the landlord to make his charge The worthy host was determined that this al¬ teration m the minds of his guests should make none in his bill, and he consoled himself for their going away, by charging them as much as if they had staid Gio¬ vanne paid it without questioning Dolgo¬ rucki demanded his carbine, which the landlord brought htm, and helped him to sling
sling it over his shoulder Tomaso led out the horses to the door, and they mounted, and rode off The night, which и almost always fine in that climate, was at that time rather brighter than usual, as the lustre of the governess of the night was not obscured by a single invidious cloud They had tra¬ velled two hours, and nearly crossed about half of the mountains, without meeting with the least occurrence to excite their appre¬ hensions they were even congratulating themselves on having so well escaped from their late companions at the inn, when Tomaso, who had kept himself rather in the rear, rode up to Giovanno, and made him observe something at a distance in the forest, which skirted the road on either side The object to which Tomaso pointed, resembled the figure of a man on horse¬ back Tomaso informed hıra that he had observed the same appearance for some time past, during which, it had kept pace with them, and seemed to govern it? mo- i i tions
fions by their own, that he was at iiut doubllul whelher fhe shades of flic luniks and branches of the tices mightnot deceive his eyes, and would not say any thing, lest they might attribute his visions to fear, and laugh at him, but he was now satis¬ fied, from the constant attendance of the same appearance, that he was not deceived, and thought proper to put them on their gilai d Giovanno proposed that they should stop, and observe if the appearance did the same They halted, and it also became stationary, they then moved on, and it renewed its course in a paiallel direction Dolgorucki desired Giovanno and Tomaso to halt again and wait for him, and unshnging his carbine, he plunged info the loiesf, and iode briskly towards the appearance, which no soonei perceived his approach, than it galloped off, buí being seemingly better acquainted with the mazes of it than its pursuei, was presently out of sight Dolgorucki finding pursuit useless, leturned to his companions, and told them be
he was cerfaiii that what had excited their alarm, was certainly a man on horseback·, as he had plainly distinguished the sounds of the horse's feet as he galloped away : he added, that he believed he was near enough. to have brought him down with his car¬ bine, but that a moment's reflection had made him desist from firing, lest it might alarm any of the lurking comrades of the fugitive. A coimcil was now held, to con¬ sider whether they should proceed or turn back. Dolgorucki demanded how far they bad yet fo go before Ihey should get clear of the mountains, and Giovanno replied, that they had about the same distance to the foot of the mountains as they had al¬ ready come from the inn " Then," said Dolgorucki, " my advice is to proceed · if the man we have seen belong to a band of banditti, they have undoubtedly cut off our reti eat, and aie only waiting to get us into a place favour¬ able to them to surround us. let us move gently on, sû as not to fatigue our horse·!, L o' and
and be ready to act as circumstances may require I am »sed to these nocturnal marches and skıımıshes, and I know that if a forest is a proper place to make an attack, it is almost equally convenient to elude one " They again went forwards, and the same shadow haunted tliem, but it kept at a greater distance than before In a short time they opened a plain about a quarter of a mile wide, through the centre of which their road lay, and which termmated in a narrow defile, like that by which they had arrived at the plain They now be¬ held the supposed spy more clearly as he quitted the forest, and rode abreast of them on the open plain, but he kept close to it, as if ready to re-enter it on the lea t appearance of a pursuit Giovanno's part/ agam hailed, and he followed their exam¬ ple they halloed to him, but he returned no answer Dolgorucki again rode towards him, and he instantly tied into the foiest Dolgorucki returned, and they went on 4 m
in a little time they saw the man resume his station When they approached the end of the plain, where the forest came close to the road on both sides, he quick¬ ened his pace, and got before them " If they meditate any attack upon us," said Dolgorucki, " they mean to put it in execution m the narrow road before us, and the look-out is now pushing on to in¬ form his comrades of our approach : they will have the advantage of rushing out upon us fiom some thicket " " What is to be done ?" demanded Gio¬ vanno ' " I am used to stratagems and dangers," answered Dolgorucki, " and if you be governed by me, I will put in practice a well-known expedient among military men to discover if any ambush is intended, and to break np their designs ' " Do you be our leader," said Giovanno, " and we will conform to all your orders " " Then do exactly as you see me do," said Dolgorucki ĺ G As
At these words, he turned about his horse and galloped back across the plain, the same road as they came. Giovanno and Tomaso followed, and ihey had no sooner gol to the end of it, than stopping and looking back, they beheld a parly of seven or eighi horsemen, who were push¬ ing after fhem in full speed. " We have escaped Ihe first snare," said Dolgorucki ; " now follow me again." So saying, he galloped a little way on the narrow part of the road, until they were concealed by the trees from the sight of their pursuers, and instanlly turned short on the right hand into the forest. They continued their course with as much speed as the intervening trees would admit of, until they discovered a very close -thicket, into the midst of which Dolgo·- rucki plunged, and his comrades followed him : they ihen listened attentively for a while, but could hear no sounds of their pursuers. " You may now sec," said Dolgorucki,
in a low tone of voice, " the reason of my conduct I knew that by making a quick retreat, the lurkers, if there were any before us would fear to lose their prey, and quit their ambush to follow us if theee had been any in our rear they would have faced us to intercept our re¬ treat, and I w ould have then stopped short, and have dashed into the forest on one side or the other, where we might stana я chance of escaping from them When they come to the end of the plain, they will most naturally conclude that we have kept on the ro-id, at least, if they should sus¬ pect that we have quitted it, they will be at a loss to imagine which side we have taken, and may take the wiong as well as the right if they separate, we shall ha\e the less odds to encounter with, if they should o\ ertake us Let us now alight to give breath to our horses, and if we bear them approach, we will remount, and shall have the advantage of having our horses fresher
fresher than theirs, which will be jaded with a constant pursuit ' They instantly dismounted, and let their horses graze, each one holding his own by the bridle, in readiness to sfarl upon Ihe first alarm " You have managed this retreat like a skilful leader," said Giovanno " 1 hsve already told you," replied Dol¬ gorucki, " that 1 am used to affairs of this kind, and if the being exposed to danger does not make a man more brbve than he naturally is, yet it certainly gives him the advantage of being more cool and collected, which, on all occasions where v<e have a supenor enemy to contend with, is of more real service than courage by a well timed refreai, the foe may be divided, and the odds be reduced ' " I know nothing of the art of war, ' said Giovarmo, " but what I have gleaned. from books, but it is easy to be seen, by what wc have just escaped, that я cool head
head may effect what an intrepid hand would have failed in ' When an hour had passed without heal¬ ing any sounds whatever, Dolgorucki pro¬ posed to remount, and by continuing to keep to the right, to pursue their course towards Genoa, without getting into the main road Skirting, therefore, the plain where they had so lately escaped from danger, they rode gently on, until the moon, whose light had been for some time gradually diminishing, totally disappeared, and left them m darkness and uncertainty " Well, ' said Giovanno, " what is to be done now ?" " Nothing," replied Dolgorucki, "but to remain whei e we are till daybreak I was in hopes the moon would have lent us her light till we had got over the mountains, but as she could not slay her course for us, wc must wait with patience for the sun The Italian climate is very fine for benighted and unsheltered travellers like ourselves, and our constitutions will not suffer much by
by passing the short remainder of the night in the open air They fastened their horses to а tree and lay down under another at no great dis¬ tance The soldier, to whom such a situ¬ ation was nothing new was soon in a sound sleep, and Giovanno and Tomaso were so overcome with fatigue and want of rest, that it was not long before they followed his example

and asked them if they chose any thing to eat before they pursued their route ? " Why are we bound '" demanded Gio¬ vanno " To prevent your escape " " For what purpose are we detained ?" " You will know that when wc reach our habitation " " Where is that ?" " In these mountains." " You jeer us by asking us to eat," said Dolgorucki, " with our hands tied in this manner " " Oh, I will soon remove that obstacle " wewere only apprehensive of your attempt¬ ing to escape during the darkness of the night, but we are not afiaid of it, now the day has bloke He then unbound them, as well as To¬ maso, who still slept soundly, without dreaming of the ill foi tune which attended his waking he then conducted them into the interior of the circle formed by his com¬ rades ,
rides, and bidding them sit down, hc placed before them some provisions and wine Dolgorucki fell to with a soldier's appe¬ tite, and Giovanno would have iollowcd his example, but for the idea of his being to be separated, for he knew not how long a time, from his beloved Paulina, whom he hoped to have thit very day enlivened with his presence, and to have enjoyed the pleasure with which she would welcome him home Tomaso, whom hunger troubled more than love, ate to dispel the former, and drank to di own care When they had finished their repast, the banditti closed round them, and one, whom they called Captain, demanded who they weie f " I am a Genoese, replied Giovanno "this person (Tomaso) is my domestic, and this othei (Dolgorucki) is a Russian gentleman, with whom we lell into com¬ pany by chance last night ' " What is your name 5 * demanded the Captain, who was the famous robber who had

" Be it so," replied Giovanno firmly. " Do any of you," demanded the Cap¬ tain, addressing himself to the rest of the banditti, " know the person of Paulo Gio¬ vanne ?" "Yes, yes," exclaimed several of them, " we have often seen him, and we believe this to be the person " Very well," said the Captain, " he will find his account in felling the truth "— Then turning to Giovanno, he said to hıra, " We hai e ollen heaid of Paulo Giovanno, he is a banker, and said lo be the richest man in Genoa " " I have certainly a large pioperty theic, said Giovanno. "So
" So much the better," said the Captain, *' for you and us too, as things have turned out Whence come you, and whither were you going ? ' " I am on my return from Pans to Ge¬ noa," replied Giovinno " And what brought your Russian com¬ panion hither ?" Giovanno, after having acquainted Dol¬ gorucki in Trench with what the Captain desired to know, repeated his answer, which was, that he wis a Russnn othcer, who, hiving fallen under the displeasure of his sovereign, had fled to avoid being sent to the deseits of Siberia, and was on his way to Genoa, at which latter place he intended to embark for America " How came you to pass the night in the mountiins ?" said the Captain to Gio¬ vanno , who readily told him their adven¬ ture at the inn on the preceding evening, and what had happened since their leav¬ ing it " Have you any suspicion," said the Captain,
Captain, " who the men were who pur¬ sued you ?" " Not the least," replied Giovanno, " probably they belonged to your party " " No, they did not, ' said the Captain " on the contrary, when we heard of their lurking hereabouts, we suspected them of being enemies, and sent out a party to bring them in " The word was now given to mount, and all the party got on horseback, and pursued their course by bye paths, well known to them, till they came to an ob¬ scure valley, which skirted the foot of a mountain much loffier than all the sur¬ rounding ones At the blowing of a horn, a door, so aitfully covered with earth and brambles, that every attempt to have dis¬ cot ered it would haie proved fruitless, was pushed open in the side of the mountain, and discovered a passage lofty enough for a horse to enter, but not with its rider on ii They all dismounted, and entered one . after
after another into the chasm, the door of which was again closed upon th-m The porfer, who had opened the door, was fol¬ lowed by another, who carried a torch, and who preceded them as they went through this gloomy subterranean As they proceeded, the height of fhe passage in¬ creased, and they at length found them¬ selves in a lofty vault, excavated from the solid rock, of which several piles were left at intervals, as pillars to support the immense weight abov e In the first vault they left their horses, and proceeding fur¬ ther on through another shorter passage, they armed at α second vault, which was well lighted, by means of several lamps suspended from iron spikes driven into the rock The whole formed а solemn scene of gloomy magnificence, such as the an- eient poets might have very well feigned for the palace of Pluto and Proserpine Shortly after they entered, some bollles ef excellent wine, with pipes and tobacco, were brought and spread on the floor, the banditti
bandiţii seated themselves in a circle, and Giovanno and his party were invited to join them, which they did not deem ex¬ pedient to refuse The glass went freely round , and to enliven it, some of the banditti, who were not bad musicians, which is very common amongst all ranks in Italy, played some martial tunes and lively airs, in a manner which would not have offended the ears of an amateur Catches, glees, and songs, chiefly in praise of their mode of life, were sung at inter¬ vals and after this sort of entertainment had lasted about two hours, it was pro¬ posed to finish the slight Tepose they had taken during the preceding night Some bundles of clean straw were immediately brought, and strewed on one side of the vault, and all the company lay down, ex¬ cept those who were to be stationed to give alarm, in case of the approach of an enemy or strangers In a short time it was very evident to Giovanno that all the banditti were m as profound

niied there, and that he was too well espionné to do much in his profession, he decamped on a countryexpedition, and ■we met together at an inn at Senlis. Find¬ ing that our pursuits were nearly alike, (for the chevaliers d'industrie, like the free- Tnasons, have a mode of penetrating each other,) he began to question me on my past and present pursuits, and I gave him such an account as gave him no mean opi¬ nion of me. To show me how far I had gained his confidence, he related to me his own adventures, as I have told them, and we agreed to seek our fortunes toge¬ ther in Russia, a country where we had heard there was more toleration than in France. In order to set out upon our tour •with t'tiat, we picked up а silly kind of fellow, named Diego, a Spaniard by birth, Who knew nothing besides his paternoster, but had every inclination to become a great man, " We hastened through Berlin, Dantzic, Königsberg, Rigaj and Revel, to Peters¬ burg,
burg, where our debut was very unfortu¬ nate We went to a faro-bank, kept by two Italians, who suffered us fo win two hundred roubles the first night, but sti ipped us of those, and all we had in the world, the next day In a day or two Tather John had made acquaintance with a Jew, and we again took up with that honourable trade of which soveieigns wish to anogvc· to themselves the excluşii e prn liege —that of coming We were so industrious that, in а short tune, we were in a condition to make a bcttei fiğine than ever " The vast quantity of new com whu h got into circulation, surprised and disquieted the government, who offered a reward ot five hundred roubles to whoever should discoler tne authors We were not uneasy, as we had taken our measures so well, tha* nothing but a most e\traordinary ac¬ ci 'ent could discover us nevertheless, that accident ι eaily happened n 2 ÇilAP

" A. HOUGH we lived very well at home, and ha-i laid in a good stock of wine, yet Father John did not l"t a day pass over without going to some tavern. One after¬ noon, as usual, he went into a little tip¬ pling shop m our neighbourhood, where, having found the' mistiess, who was a per¬ sonable woman, alone, he made her some proposal, which she rejected, and he was not satislicd without taking some liberties. The husband came up from a cellar in the mean time, and was going to kill the rude agtrressor, but Father John sent him, with a ..ngle kick, back into the cellar from whence
whence he came, and s.hut the door on him He then renewed his game with the landlady, whilst the poor landlord bawled murder ' Are ' ind thieve* ' through the giat ng of the cellar which looked int othe stieet The neighbouihood was immedi¬ ately alarmed, and the guard came Fatner John barred the street door and swore he would ! ill the first that simuld e iter The offlcei of the guard, despisi"g l ¡. threats, ordered the soldiers to force the doûı Uhey did so and father T ohn aimed with a leg which he Iran knocked off the table, '-ι elled the first three who adianced upon the avement This somewhat abated the courage of the rest foi attempting to foice so strong a position but thev assailed the doors and win Ions m the back pait of the house and gamet! admittance in the rear Father John Iioiveiei wheeled about and defend" 1 himself with such despe ale resolution, that one halí of them had тез suied the r length on the flooi 1 efore the n 3 other
other half could oveipower him : he was then ied off towards the prison. " We bad heaid all this disturbance from the beginning, and Diegc was looking out of the window and enjoying the fun, with¬ out having the {east idea that bis master was the cause of it, until he saw them dragging him along the street before the door. He exclaimed—' Oh, my dear mas¬ ter I what are they going to do with you ''—and-, in the nrst transport of in¬ dignation, he sci, ed a carbine which hap¬ pened to stand in the room, and dischaiged it among the mob, luckily without doing any other execution than that of breaking a tailor's arm. After this exploit, he drop¬ ped the carbine in the streef, and crept up the chimney. The officer stopped the guard, and ordered ten men to search the house, and bring away the pei son who had fired the shot. When they came in', they seized the Jew and myself, inid demanded, in their jargon, where was the man who bad:
had discharged the carbine ? The Jew answered that we knew nothing of him. They then began to make a strict search, but not finding the object of it, they forced open the trunks, and found nearly four thousand roubles of our new coinage, which thev seized, with the implements. They then renewed their search, and one of the guards took it into his head to look up the chimney, where he discovered Diego, and called to him to come down. The poor Spaniard began to cry to all the Saints in Paradise for protection ,* but see¬ ing the guard level his musquet, and not caring to be shot like a swallow, he de¬ scended : we were then all conducted to prison. " The nett day we were carried before the magistrates; and when one of these gentlemen, by means of a French inter¬ preter, demanded of Father John what had induced him to offer violence to the land¬ lady? he answered—'Nature.' The magi¬ strate caused fhe question to be repeated, ui but
but he would give no other answer Diego was next interrogated what h id provoked him (o break (he tailor's arm ?—' Our holy religion/ replied Diego, ' which would not let me see with indifference my master, who is a good Catholic, ill used by Greek heretics ' " The Jew was asked next how he came by the false money > He replied, that it was found in trunks belonging to other persons who lodged m the same house, and who, conscious of their guilt, fled out of the back-door as the guaid cnleied the fore ohe " We were interrogated separately and togethei during several following days, but we would gii e them no other answer, and as the capital part of coming could not be brought home to us, they condemned us to banishment to Siberia for life—(Here Dolgorucki shrugged up his shoulders )— " The sentence was speedily put into еч- ecution I had formed so terrible an idea of passing my life in these deserts ------" " I believe

ticable We sounded our comrades, to discover who would join us, but whether habit had depressed their active faculties, and arcustomed them to slavery, or they saw only certain death in the enterpnze, we found none to our purpose but an Eng¬ lishman, who still sighed after liberty We had no little trouble "with him, after we had communicated our plot to him, for he was not for skulking away, as he called it, but for falling upon the guards, and mastering them We, however, deter¬ mined on the quieter and safer mode of taking French leave, and having cooled the Englishman, wc began to provide our· seh es with a carbine each, powder, ball, hatchets, a tindei box, and an iron kettle. Our poor comrades denied themselves, to give us a store of their dried provisions, and wished us success, although they pre- fened lingering where they were, to going with us, as they believed, to certain death. All things being ready, we took the ad- 6 vantage
Tantige of the soldiers being all drunk with celebrating the birth day ol the Empress, and slipped away at midnight " We proceeded along the left bank of the river Oby*, till we were in the neigh¬ bourhood of Kalami+, where wc passed the river on ι raft of trees, which we put to¬ gether, and fastened with straps of bark When we hid reached the KietaJ we fol¬ lowed its course through the countries ol Gmtmskt and Ľidomma$, and gained the mountains of Krabia, at that part where they meet those of Sania and belgian After having crossed these mountains, not without running a great risk of peushmg through cold md hunger, we found oui- selves in a desert, whence Gramani in¬ formed us we had about eighty days journey to Samarcand, the capital of Great Buchary,
in a western direction, and about the same length of way to the Mogul Em¬ pire on the east. He advised us to take the latter route, which was through the desert, rather than follow the former, through inhabited countries, where we might be tracked, overtaken, and recon¬ ducted to Siberia. We resolved to follow his advice. Before we ventured upon this ocean of desert, we tarried some days, and employed ourselves in hunting, by which means we procured and smoakcd as much meat as all of us could well carry ; and w found that,, by this mode of curing animal food, it required no other dressing, and answered very well without bread*. We travelled during several weeks without meeting with a human being : our eyes were then regaled with the sight ot' a Tartar, who fled from us as fast as his horse

could салу hım , but presently returned with his whole horde, amounting to be¬ tween three or four hundred They le¬ gated lis at first with some sour mii.i, but in the end, paid themselv es by trkıng from us our anus and every thing we had " When these hospitable folks had left its, we continued our journey with aching hearts, as we had no longer any weapons to procuie gime for our sustemnce our only lesource consisted rø heibs, roots, and benies, and, ifter a few trials, we became so dextrous at finding them, that I question whether a herd of hogs could have boi ne away the palm from us At intervals, we met with other hordes of Tai tars, who regaled us with whatever they had, and would no doubt have robbed us like the formei one il wc had hid any thing to lose They duected us on our way and at length, after a most tedious journey, we hid the satisfiction of arriving on the confines of the Mogul Empne, ind of seeing the habitations of men, though thinly
thinly scattered We tr iv elled on to I ahor, where we began to evercise Monsieut Gu- bandiers trade, and we had no sooner exchanged our counterfeits for real money, sufficient to carry us on our journey, than we bade adieu to Lahor, and passed through Nicodar and 'ynna, to Delhi here Λιε soon raised, by our dexterity, a consider¬ able capita], and proceeded to Agra, and thence to Sunt, where we found a vessel about to sail for Goa, and embarked At Goa we found anothei vessel about to sail for Lisbon, and having taken a passage, we arnved safely in the fagus " Tinding Lisbon likely to suit our pur¬ poses, we agreed not to seaarate, but fo continue working at our trade Although all lodged m the same house', yet to avoid suspicion. Father John and myself, with Diego as our servant, hired an apartment one day, and the Jew and Englishman lined another for themselves on the following, so that we passed foi stiangers to them. At first, lather John and myself coined the money.
money, and the Englishman and Jew, who both had a smattering of the Portugue/e language, passed it away, getting as much good money in change as they could In this manner we soon accumulated a hand¬ some sum, without any suspicion or acci¬ dent, until one night, as the host was cai- rying to a sick person, our Englishman chanced to meet the procession, and was ordered to kneel down as the rest did, but he swore that he would not kneel down m the dirt to any old wig-box The expres¬ sion no sooner escaped his Ups, than, like the explosion of а mme, the fui у of tlie bj standers vented itself, first in the ept- thets of heretic dog ' and aftei wards in dirt and stones so that our comiade was obliged to fly from the fury of the storm The mob pursued him, and he reached the door of our lodging only just before them But he did not get off with their hisses revilings, and peltings about in uphf, whilst he was in a deep sleep he v as awakened by a heaity shake of the shoulder, and on opening
opening lus eyes, he beheld seveni men, one of whom ordered him, in the name of the Holy Inquisition, to use instantly and go with them " The Englishman swoie he would not quit his bed at lhat time of night lor the Holy Office or he devil, but the oflicers pulled him out, nd obliged him to dress himself, by threatening, if he did not, to enry him away in a blanket, or even in statu quo The Jew hippened fortunately to be m our loom that ni 0 ht, helping из in our labours, and as the room w s se¬ parated fi om the.ı ь only by a thin parti¬ tion, we oierheaid every syllable that was uttered At the sound of the words ' Holy Office,' the Jew tu ied pale is a corpse , and dropping an cmply ciucible which he was going to put on the fire, he sud, in ι low tone of voice— ' bive me O God of Abraham, Isaii and Jacob for the shadows of the valley of death luve beset me '' At length we had the pleasure to hear them cairy away the Englishman without making
making any further search, and when thi· street-door was again fastened, ľafher John burst into a loud fit of laughter, and ex¬ claimed—' He will never trouble us more, and we may as well be his heirs as the In¬ quisitors ' " He was mistaken, however, for, find¬ ing bubiness brisk we had no thoughts of decamping, at the end oi three weeks after the iccident, when one mghf or, rather, morning, as we were all busy m clipping, filing, melting, and stamping for the good of the nation, we were thunderstruck by a violent Knocking at the door The Jew, who had been haunted by the Inquisition ever since they piid dieir respects to the Englishman, believed us turn wis поле come, and instantly fell senseless on the floor We sent Diego to look out of the window, whilst we concealed our effects in the bed, and in a few minutes he cried out, with a tremulous voice, that the Eng¬ lishman had already expiited his heresy on the rack, and that his ghost was at the door.
dear Tather John, who would lather it had been his ghost than his propria persona, as he would have no restitution to make it, went to the window himself, and hav¬ ing wished the Englishman, who continued knocking, to the bottomless pit, he bade Jum make no more noise, as he would let bim m directly The Pnglishman no sooner entered the chamber than he begged for a glass of wine without delay, and he diank off a bumper to * a speedy meeting be¬ tween the devil and his agents, the Inqui¬ sitors ' fhe good Catholic Diego lifted up his eyes, and muttered that he had escaped the Inquisition, vet Heav en would never suffer such blasphemy to go unpunished After the Lnglishman had emptied a bottle of wine, he asked for victuals, swearing that he had had a worse time in the infer¬ nal dungeon of the Inquisition, than during all our march from Siberia Whilst Diego was ransacking the cupboard, Tather John asked the Englishman what devil had as¬ sisted him to make his escape ?—* None,' replied
replied he, ' for the devils and the Inqui¬ sitors are all m a league against mankind such an infernal scene as I have witnessed r ' " Diego came at that instant with the nieat, and the fnglishman fell to without uttering another word \a hen he had eaten, or rather dei oured what there was, he asked him what he had seen, and how he had effected his escape, and he gave us the following account

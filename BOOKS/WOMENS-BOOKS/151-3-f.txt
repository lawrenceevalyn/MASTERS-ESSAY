CHAP. L 

On her second meeting with sir Osbert, 
Adelaide was imperceptibly led out of the 
beaten track, by the manner in which he 
contrived to engross her attention, respect- 
ing the arrangements he pretended he was 
making for his marriage with her injured 
friend. At last, suddenly pausing, she 
was on the point of observing, she did not 
know how it was they had deviated so com- 
pletely out of the road they should have 
kept in, when, catching her up in his arms, 
and stifling her cries in his bosom, he bore 
her to a carriage, waiting at a little distance; 
and in this way conveyed her to his 
yacht, prepared for her reception, and ready 
to sail for Sicily, the moment she was re- 
ceived on board. Till actually lifted into the 

VOL. III. B

vessel, Adelaide had not despaired of being 
rescued ; her hope of this at an end, terror 
was for a time lost in insensibility. On 
being brought to herself, she found a fe- 
male in attendance on her, by whom she 
was informed of her destination ; and that 
complaints might render matters worse, 
but could not possibly render them better. 
This intimation, however, would have had 
very little effect, had she been aware of 
the restraint sir Osbert deemed it prudent 
to impose upon himself with regard to her, 
from not being exactly sure of all his crew. 
The decorum observed throughout the 
voyage, had the effect of enabling her to 
collect herself: but when, on landing 
within a few miles of Palermo, she saw 
the lonely place destined to receive her, 
terror again overcame her, and, in a state 
of insensibility, she was resigned to the 
care of the people of the house ; while sir 
Osbert, for fear of accidents, or, in other 
words, being traced from England, pro- 
ceeded to another part of the coast, to have 
his yacht left there. 

Reduced to despair, Adelaide remained 
for some minutes, after regaining her 



CONTRAST. 3 

senses, without unclosing her eyes: at 
length, the continued murmuring of a soft 
voice in her ear, made her open them, and 
she saw a pretty-looking girl hanging over 
her, with an expression of pity. " Who 
are you?" -demanded Adelaide, staring 
wildly at her. 

The fair Sicilian replied, in broken Eng- 
lish, and Adelaide found that she was the 
daughter of the man of the house ; and that 
her mother, lately deceased, was an Eng- 
lishwoman, and who, in teaching her the 
language of her country, had also taught 
her to love every one belonging to it. 

** Then there's hope for me !" said Ade- 
laide, clasping her hands in joyful trans- 
port, and shedding tears. She lost not a 
moment in trying the effect of her story 
upon her young attendant. Laurana, the 
name of the young Sicilian, listened with 
an attention betokening the deepest in- 
terest ; in short, she had previously heard 
what did not permit her to doubt the 
statement now made ; and viewing Ade- 
laide as an injured being, her feelings were 
all tenderness and gentleness towards her.

The valet of sir Osbert was brother to 
her father ; and his communication to him, 
on being sent on by sir Osbert, to prepare 
for the reception of Adelaide, had ac- 
quainted her with the truth. But her fa- 
ther was a very different character from 
her deceased mother ; and to have attempt- 
ed any interference for the fair victim of 
treacherv, would have been to awaken his 
heaviest displeasure : but not even her 
dread of this could induce her to lend her- 
self passively to cruelty or injustice: she 
avowed her readiness to serve the beauti- 
ful signora ; and as no time was to be lost, 
in consequence of the quickly-expected re- 
turn of sir Osbert, she immediately set 
about devising how she could do this. She 
was not long in considering. â€” " The stew- 
ard of the villa Zerbino was also the bro- 
ther of her father, and his wife was the best 
friend she had in the world ; so merry and 
good-natured too, that, in short, signora, 
I should be quite lost without her ; for> 
with his will, my father," she went on, 
" would never suffer a young girl to keep 
holiday, in any way but by going to mass; 
but when there's any thing fine to be seen 



CONTRAST. 5 

at Palermo, down she comes, and spite of 
all he can say to the contrary, away she 
has me with her; and then, having no 
daughter of her own, she makes me such 
pretty presents; and I know there's nothing 
in reason, I can ask her, that she will re- 
fuse me ; so I shall ask her to receive you 
into the villa, and there you can remain 
concealed, till either you hear of some of 
your country-people at Palermo, to apply 
to for protection, or shall have apprized 
your friends in England where you are: 
but this must all be without the know- 
ledge of my uncle, who is so surly, and so 
unlike her, that not even for a relic of 
saint Rosolia, do I believe he would let 
her do a good-natured turn for any one." 

** If that be the case," said Adelaide, 
turning pale, " do you think she will run 
the risk of offending him, for the sake of a 
stranger ?" 

" That I do, signora, or I would not ask 
her : she has run that risk before, and that 
without having a friend, like me, to oblige 
by doing so ; else how did the young sis- 
ter of the count contrive to get out of the 
villa, where he had her shut up, in order to 



D CONTRAST. 

force her to become a nun, that he might 
get possession of all the wealth of the fa- 
mily? But, holy saints ! what would my 
aunt have been, had she seen so beautiful 
a creature breaking her heart, without tak- 
ing compassion on her, and the handsome 
cavalier, that kept wandering about the 
walls all the time she was cooped within 
them, just like a ghost ! No, no ; she 
wasn't unfeeling enough for that : and just 
at the time the signora disappeared, she 
got such a rosary ! no one can tell from 
whence, or from whom : Enoch, the Polish 
Jew, says 'tis worth a king's ransom." 

" But I will not needlessly spin out these 
particulars," said Adelaide, " by detailing 
all that occurred, ere I was received into 
the villa Zerbino : the application of the 
pretty Laurana succeeded â€” her aunt readi- 
ly consented to befriend me; and on the 
second night of my arrival, covered with 
the antique veil of the Sicilian women, I 
was conducted, not without fear and trem- 
bling, to where she was awaiting me 
amongst the rocks. 

" Trembling in every limb, fearful in 
every sound I heard, it was that of pur- 



CONTRAST. 7 

suit, often mistaking the shuddering of the 
woods, through which the ascending road 
to the villa lay, for following footsteps, I 
could well have dispensed with the loqua- 
city of my companion ; but she too much 
enjoyed the idea of the consternation my 
escape would occasion, and of her being 
more than a match for her husband, not- 
withstanding his cunning, to allow herself 
to be silenced; besides which, she wished 
to impress me with all due reverence for 
the magnificent place, of which she regard- 
ed herself the mistress. The first glance 
justified the terms in which she spoke of 
it. I reached it just as the beams of a full- 
orbed moon, struggling through masses of 
silver- ridged clouds, that floated along, 
touched its decaying towers and battle- 
ments, heightening the romantic interest 
age ever imparts to such edifices ; while, as 
the clouds from time to time obscured its 
light, they cast a shadowy gloom upon 
surrounding objects, that, giving indistinct- 
ness to their forms, rendered them appal- 
ling to the soul. The fate of things affects 
the human mind; under other circum- 
stances, and I could have lingered for 



8 CONTRAST. 

hours to indulge the tender melancholy it 
was so peculiarly adapted to inspire. 
Winding round the building, she brought 
me to a tower, that abutted far into the 
woods, and in the upper part of which she 
lodged me." 

" Ah, that romantic-looking tower!" 
cried De Montville ; " how many hours 
have I passed in the contemplation of it, 

under the hope but I interrupt you ; 

and need I say I am impatient ? for though 
I gaze upon you, sitting in safety by me, 
yet, while I dwell upon your being the 
inmate of the villa Zerbino, my heart feels 
as if beating with anxious alarm for you." 

*' Although convinced, for her own sake, 
she had taken every requisite precaution 
to ensure my safety, yet, you may readily 
believe, I could not regain any great de- 
gree of composure," said Adelaide. " How 
often had I wished to visit the enchanting 
shores of Sicily, so celebrated in classic 
song, and so replete with interesting asso- 
ciations ! But where were now the lively 
feelings I thought they must have inspired ? 
Spite of the anxieties of my situation, how- 
ever, there were moments when I could 



CONTRAST. 9 

not view the enchanting prospect spread 
before me, of the sunny sea, the city of 
Palermo, with its glowing plain and ro- 
mantic mountains, without emotions of 
admiration, that rekindled enthusiasm ; 
nor listen to the tender notes of the sweet 
Sicilian dove, in the adjacent woods, with- 
out a soothing sensation ; while on the 
balmy air, soft indeed as when Zephyrus on 
Flora breathes, came the fragrance of the 
bergamot, the orange, and the lemon, that 
richly diversified the grounds, and still 
spread their foliage, and exhaled their 
sweetness o'er the deserted and decaying 
courts of the villa. Isenella immediately 
set about inquiring for a vessel to convey 
me to England. Encouraged to hope her 
inquiries would soon prove successful, I was 
induced to seek amusement, by examin- 
ing the apartments immediately contigu- 
ous ; and at length, from an assurance that 
her husband never thought of approaching 
it, to venture down into the court, imme- 
diately connected with the tower, where 
it w^as delightful to wander in the shade 
of the colonade, and listen to the murmur- 
b3 



lO CONTRAST. 

ing flow of the water of the fountain, and 
the soft rustling of the environing cypresses 
that waved their tall heads over the tessa- 
lated pavement !" 

" Oh, had I but surmised who it was I 
then saw," cried De Montville, " how 
soon would there have been an end of 
your anxiety !" 

" Why, that I presume. But then, 
what interest should I have lost? â€” For 
come, confess now, had not the air of ro- 
mance that was spread round me, some 
little effect upon your imagination ?" 

" If I said no, you would not believe 
me, so I may as well " 

" Say yes, assuredly. But to proceed. 
The alarm I was thrown into, lest your 
inquiries, as repeated to me by Isenella, 
should be the means of awakening suspi- 
cion in the mind of her husband, deter- 
mined me on no longer delaying to write 
to England, since disappointed in my ex- 
pectation of hearing of a vessel bound there. 
After two or three days of deliberation, I 
had just come to this resolve, when, as I 
was standing in the evening, lost in thought, 
at a lattice, I was startled by a noise in the 



CONTRAST. 11 

chamber, and turning, perceived a panel 
moving. The idea of being surprised, 
either by sir Osbert or some one of his 
emissaries, instantly struck upon my af- 
frighted imagination ; and in wild alarm 
I was retreating towards the door, when 
the sight of a female, emerging from be- 
hind the panel that had been pushed back, 
arrested my steps. Putting a billet into 
my hand, she was about speaking, when 
Isenella was heard approaching ; on which 
she retreated, making a sign for secresy as 
she retired. I had hardly time to obey 
this, by depositing the billet in my bo- 
som, when Isenella entered." 

" Ere you proceed," cried De Mont- 
ville, interrupting her, " first tell me, had 
you a suspicion who it came from ? for, of 
course, I know it was Bianca, my confi- 
dant, you saw ; or, in short, whether yoa 
ever bestowed a thought on me ? or had 
allowed yourself to take a sufficient view 
of me, to know what kind of creature I 
was ?" 

" First, honestly acknowledge to me," 
said Adelaide, " that if I answered you in 
the negative, you would be mortified ?" 



12 CONTRAST. 

" Well, perhaps I might," replied De 
Montville, laughing; " but then, you 
know, there's no one likes to be complete- 
ly overlooked." 

" Particularly a gentleman, thinking of 
himself so humbly as you. Well, to leave 
you still to agreeably amuse your imagi- 
Dation, by conjecturing whether I did or 
not, I shall merely say, that, impatient to 
peruse the billet â€” and, to be sure, if I had 
not been impatient to peruse one, deliver- 
ed in so delightfully mysterious a manner, 
I should not have had a tincture of ro- 
mance in my composition â€” while Isenella 
was busied in arranging the evening re- 
past, I returned to the lattice, to endea- 
vour to make out, by the light that still 
lingered in the sky, who it came from." 

" Well, and when you did discover ? 
Nay," seizing both her hands, " I positive- 
ly cannot let you go on, till you tell me 
what you felt, when you did make out 
the name, and found that it was from 
your predestined it had come." 

" Why, I don't know, but I believe I 
didn't feel very much discomposed; but 
then you are to take into consideration 



CONTRAST. 18 

all that mamma had said, whilst I was 
with her, to excite a previous prejudice 
in favour of her pet Horatio ; continually 
.descanting on.all his amiable qualities, with 
an assurance that, handsome as his portrait 
was, it was not equal to the dear darling 
original. But, seriously, whatever were 
the feelings it excited, they were lost in the 
surprise occasioned by the abrupt entrance 
of Laurana, to announce the arrival of a 
friend from England, who only waited to 
have me prepared for his reception, to 
make his appearance. This friend, of 
course, you surmise, v*^as JMountflorence : 
he had traced sir Osbert to Palermo ; but, 
disappointed in his expectation of hearing 
further of him there, the idea struck him 
of availing himself of his knowledge of a 
person in the neighbourhood, to obtain as- 
sistance in his continued inquiries. This 
person proved to be the father of my 
young friend, whose mother, it appeared, 
was an attendant of Mountflorence's mo- 
ther, at the time of the occupation of Sicily 
by the British troops ; and was perfectly re- 
membered by him, from his having ac- 
companied his parents there. 



14 CONTRAST. 

" Little further remains to be told, from 
the explanation already received from Mr. 
Fortescue. Fortunately, on carrying his in- 
tention into effect, he found but the pretty 
Laurana at home, as her father would 
assuredly not have given up sir Osbert, to 
oblige him. Having introduced himself 
to her, and soothed the grief the mention 
of his name renewed, he proceeded to ex- 
plain the purport of his visit ; and, in re- 
turn, was, as you may well suppose, not a 
little astonished by the disclosure she had 
to make. How did I joy to see him, al- 
though his manner was cold and distant, 
notwithstanding my partial justification 
in his eyes, through the particulars he had 
just heard ! but, conscious of being able 
to fully justify myself, I did not heed this. 
Ere, however, I had time to say, that if 
he would but grant me his attention, he 
would find I was not so greatly to blame 
as now imagined, the letter from my un- 
happy friend was put into my hand. Of 
its purport you are already apprized ; the 
request it contained was indeed a most 
painful one, dooming me, as it did, if ac- 
ceded to, to remain, for I knew not what 



CONTRAST. 15 

period, under the censure of those I re- 
garded. But what did I not owe to the 
family of hei^ who made it ! and how, if I 
shrunk from this first trial of my grati- 
tude, could even I myself believe in the 
sincerity of it ! Finally, I resolved on act- 
ing as she required." 

" On acting as an angel !" cried De 
Montville, rapturously kissing her hand : 
but we shall pass over the remainder of 
the scene. With all his impatience to im- 
part his happiness to lord Le Poer, De 
Montville lingered till surprised by the 
Miss Floyds, who, hearing of his being 
with Adelaide, hastily made their toilet, 
for the purpose of joining them ; but in 
vain they sought to detain him â€” he was 
in too tumultuous a state of feehng to be 
able immediately to converse on any sub- 
ject but one. 

The first wish of lord Le Poer's heart, 
the marriage of Adelaide and De Mont- 
ville â€” what he felt on finding that, after 
all, he was destined to see it accomplished, 
may be imagined; but with his joy, a 
little resentment mingled against Mrs. 
Mowbray, for the double part he con- 



16 CONTRAST. 

ceived she had acted ; and in this feeling, 
notwithstanding his good-nature, DeMont- 
ville could not help participating. 

But the entreaties of Adelaide were not 
requisite to induce silence on this; the 
recollection of the obligations she owed 
her, w^as quite sufficient for the purpose â€” 
" And, after all,'* as Adelaide argued, 
" what deception had she practised ? the 
confidence she had reposed in her, she 
could not, in honour, have thought her- 
self justified in disclosing, from the change, 
she was given to understand, the senti- 
ments of a certain gentleman had under- 
gone ; so that actually, if there was any 
blame in the case, it was he, not she, that 
merited it ; though he had so adroitly 
tried to shuffle it off his own shoulders on 
hers." 

It was settled, that the quiet enjoyment 
of that day should not be marred by any 
explanation to her; but beyond that, lord 
Le Poer could not think of having it 
postponed, impatient as he was to re- 
commence preparations for the long-de- 
sired marriage. 

She received his disclosure with a min- 



CONTRAST. 17 

gled feeling; her affection for Adelaide 
was too sincere^ not to make her rejoice at 
the prospect of her being happy ; yet she 
could not, at the same time, think of the 
frustration of her own plan concerning 
her, without a pang: the union now in 
contemplation must occasion her estrange- 
ment from her, and in vain, she felt con- 
vinced, she should seek to have her place 
supplied. 

Adelaide essayed every art in her power 
to try and sooth the melancholy imparted 
by the thought, and in her regret at her 
unavailing efforts, she felt, when the hour 
for taking leave actually arrived, that there 
is no happiness without some little alloy 
â€” no prospect, however felicitous, with- 
out some little shading; but perhaps to 
prevent its being otherwise too dazzling 
for the weak vision of human nature.

CHAP. II. 

" I'll cry content to that which grieves my heart." 

We left Helena under the influence of 
feelings not natural to her, namely, those 
of unkindness ; but amply was Adelaide 
revenged, for that shewn to her, by the 
pangs it occasioned. Hardly had she left 
the house, ere Helena, seized with remorse 
for the conduct she had experienced from 
her â€” her resistance to the silent pleadings 
of her pale and exhausted looks and falling 
tears, dispatched servants after her; but 
they all returned equally unsuccessful from 
their pursuit ; and for some time after, their 
lady was almost in a state of despair, from 
conceiving, that if any ill befell her, she 
must certainly be considered answerable for 
it. â€” " But there was no danger of this," 
she said to herself, as she gradually began 
to recover from this agony of regret and 
repentance; " Mountflorence was at hand 



CONTRAST. 19 

to afford her his protection ; and really, after 
all, she could not think her conduct to her 
so very reprehensible ; since, after the ne- 
glect she had experienced from JNIount- 

florence but no, no â€” she could not 

excuse â€” she could not justify it to herself 
â€” nothing could excuse such conduct to 
one of her own sex, and that one whom 
she had known under such different cir- 
cunastances, and who had placed such con- 
fidence in her generosity." The idea of it 
niade her hateful to herself; and gladly 
she took refuge in any thing that helped 
to banish it her mind. 

Continually engaged in one party or 
other, she could hardly have failed of en- 
countering those she was secretly so anxi- 
ous to see, but for the contrivances made 
use of to prevent a thing of the kind. 

Lady Anstruther had by this time 
formed plans, that rendered her quite as 
anxious as the Bridgemores to keep them 
asunder ; she accordingly had recourse to 
lady Lovel, to make her acquainted with 
all the movements of Helena, so that she 
might know how to regulate her own; 
and hence, to her management was owing 



20 CONTRAST. 

the surprise and disappointment of He- 
lena, at never, by any chance, meeting 
the girls at any of the places she fre- 
quented. 

Lady Lovel was one of those obliging 
persons, who are at all times ready to lend 
themselves to the views of those who can, 
in any way, advance theirs : she had, for 
some time, through a certain diminution 
of her consequence in the fashionable 
world, been rather overlooked by lady 
Anstruther; her being noticed by her 
again, was a circumstance too flattering 
not to render her ready to obhge her, 
in any way she could devise : but in 
aiding the countess's project with regard 
to Helena, she was also aiding her own ; 
she saw all the advantages likely to be de- 
rived from obtaining an ascendancy over 
Helena; and attaching her to herself: lady 
Anstruther, therefore, was not more anxi- 
ous than she was to detach her from her 
connexions, as a likely means of enabling 
her to accomplish what she wished. Thus 
were there wheels within wheels; still 
Helena would probably have rendered all 
the schemes against her abortive, had she 



CONTHAST. 21 

not, by yielding to her usual hastiness of 
feeling, prevented any calm explanation 
with iMountflorence, the night of meeting 
him at the theatre. But not satisfied with 
quietly acting the part of a spy for lady 
Anstruther, lady Lovel rested not, until, 
for the furtherance of her own schemes, 
she acquainted Helena with having been 
requested to do so. 

What the feelings of Helena were at 
her communication â€” at learning that what 
she had hitherto imputed to chance was 
the effect of design â€” that she had, in 
short, been sedulously avoided, may easily 
be conceived; in the transport of indigna- 
tion it occasioned, notliing restrained her 
from addressing an upbraiding letter to 
lady Rossglen and her daughters, but the 
promise of silence on the subject which 
lady Lovel had artfully extorted from her, 
ere she ventured to make her any disclo- 
sure. But her conduct should speak for 
her â€” it should evince her contempt, her 
scorn, for those who had treated her so un- 
worthily ; and, to prove her indifference, 
she forced herself to appear more than 
ever in public. 



22 CONTRAST. 

Little recking what was passing in her 
heart, the manner in which she now al- 
lowed herself to be constantly engaged, 
united to the levity assumed for the pur- 
pose of veiling her real feelings, had gra- 
dually the effect of injuring her in the es- 
timation of the reflecting. But this was 
not all that had a tendency to hurt her in 
general opinion; every thing left to the 
control of the unprincipled Bridgemores, 
characters were introduced into her resi- 
dence, that never should have obtained ac- 
cess ; and high play and vigils promoted, 
disgraceful to those who encouraged them. 
Of both she remained in utter ignorance : 
but not so the public; and believing it 
impossible she could remain unacquainted 
with what was passing under her own 
roof, she began, by degrees, to be regarded 
with shyness, by those whose notice and 
esteem she was anxious to retain. 

She would have been as much astonish- 
ed as hurt by the circumstance, but that 
she imputed it to some further exertion of 
lady Anstruther's malice against her, a 
belief in which she was artfully encou- 
raged by lady Lovel. If she had succeed- 



CONTRAST. 23 

ed, as it seemed she had, in alienating 
from her the regard of those who were 
bound, by the nearness of their affinity, 
to shew her some regard, how much easier, 
of course, could she injure her with 
those who had no consideration of that 
kind, to prevent their resisting her machi- 
nations! But she should not triumph; 
the more she was persuaded of her being 
the cause of what was so mortifying, the 
more she was determined to counteract 
her efforts, by greater ones than ever on 
her own part, to draw the world of fashion 
around her ; and accordingly, every nerve 
was strained, to render her entertainments 
still more attractive, more brilliant than 
ever. 

But in the midst of all that could gra- 
.tify vanity, of flattery and homage, her 
heart remained untouched by one plea- 
surable sensation : sighing to be an object 
of real interest to some one, and to feel a 
corresponding one awakened in her bosom 
in return, how gladly would she have re- 
signed the dazzling distinctions of her 
rank, all that the proud, the vain, might 
be supposed to envy her for, to be the 



24 CONTRAST. 

cherished daughter of some happy home, 
however humble ! This, however, was 
kept to herself; the heart knows its own 
bitterness, and carefully she concealed the 
pangs of hers. 

She had much to distress her at this 
juncture: in addition to other sources of 
uneasiness, prince Zamoski continued to 
persecute her with his attentions, which 
she could no longer consider in any other 
than an insulting hght ; yet still knew not 
how to check, without coming to an ab- 
solute explanation with him, such as she 
dreaded, on account of Mountflorence. 

Unhappy and restless, she meditated try- 
ing what change of scene would accomplish 
for her. Lady Lovel talked of a visit to the 
Continent, and why not accompany her? 
By going abroad for a time, she should 
get rid of what was unpleasant to her; 
and when she returned, she would lead a 
new life, and cultivate only a few select 
intimacies. But ere this plan was carried 
into effect, how much did she wish to be 
out of suspense with regard to Mountflo- 
rence ! â€” that is, whether he and Adelaide 
still persevered in their attachment 



CONTRAST. 25 

Through lady Lovel she endeavoured to 
obtain some information respecting him ; 
but her ladyship affected ignorance â€” or, if 
she did mention him, it was only to ex- 
press the anxiety his family felt to have 
him think seriously of lady Bellair. 

Months circled round, and the vernal 
influence of spring began again to be felt. 
What recollections, what reflections, were 
revived in the cad heart of Helena, by the 
returning season ! this time last year, she 
was at least happy in one firm friend ; but 
this friend, this beloved father, could no 
more afford her kindness or protection â€” 
could no more woo her, with the voice of 
kindness, to a happy home. Had he been 
spared, whatever she might have been, she 
still would not have been the isolated 
creature she now felt herself. But he was 
translated to a happier sphere, and her re- 
grets for him were certainly selfish. 

She was lingering at the breakfast-table 
one morning by herself, when, as she was 
carelessly glancing over a newspaper, her 
eye was suddenly caught, and with emotions 
easier to be conceived than described, she

read the following paragraph : â€” " Married, 
yesterday, by special licence, at the seat of 
lord viscount Le Poer, in Berkshire, Ade- 
laide Mountflorence, to the honourable 
Horatio De Montville, youngest son of 
the late, and brother to the present, earl of 
Newbury." 

" Married ! Adelaide married ! and not 
to Mountflorence ! â€” but could she believe 
this?" the agitated Helena demanded of 
herself; " might there not be some mis- 
take in the statement? â€” but no, this was 
not probable, from the rank of the par- 
ties: and the tyranny of her father had 
then prevailed against her ! How would 
Mountflorence bear the disappointment! 
but he would be consoled for it by lady 
Bellair : but, at all events, what to her was 
the circumstance, and why the agitation 
it occasioned? â€” could she flatter herself, 
that he who had already given her such 
convincing proofs of having ceased to feel 
for her even the common regard of a friend, 
would now address her as a lover ? No, 
such an idea would be ridiculous ; and for 
any thing Mountflorence would ever be 
to her, he might as well have been the 



CONTRAST. 27 

husband as the disappointed lover of Ade- 
laide." 

She rose â€” she reseated herselfâ€” she 
walked about the room, unconscious of 
any movement, from her extreme agita- 
tion. At length, feeling it utterly impos- 
sible that she could regain any composure 
till she had heard something of Mountflo- 
rence, she decided on an immediate call on 
lady Lovel, through whose means, she 
thought it not unlikely she might obtain 
the information she wished ; and accord- 
ingly ordered the carriage directly. She 
had not proceeded far, when she suddenly 
beheld Mountflorence, at a little distance ; 
almost at the same moment she caught 
his eye, and instantly pulling the check- 
string, beckoned him to her. Mountflo- 
rence slowly, so slowly as to make it seem 
as if it were reluctantly, approached. Well, 
no matter â€” yet Helena felt a flush upon her 
cheek. " And not very flattering, upon 
my word," she said, " this snail's pace, in 
coming to me; but n'importe, I have a 
question or two to ask you, so step into 
the carriage."

Mountflorence hesitated â€” " I am just 
at this instant pressed for time," he said, 
" therefore " 

" Oh ! not so much, I dare say," cried 
Helena, " that you cannot spare a few mi- 
nutes â€” so come." 

Well, all this had been the work of a 
minute â€” the impulse of the moment, with- 
out an instant being allowed for reflection ; 
and now that Mountflorence was actually 
seated beside her, what excuse should she 
make for what she had done ? There was a 
short silence; then, endeavouring to col- 
lect herself, " You must know," she said, 
" I have some idea of going abroad ; and 
so, as you have been to the Continent, I 
wanted to ask â€” but the carriage stops â€” 
when we ahght. 111 tell you ; and yet, 
after what you mentioned, I don't know 
how I should attempt to detain you," she 
added, as they entered the drawing-room. 

" Oh ! don't mind," replied Mountflo- 
rence ; " if it is in my power to give you 
any information that you conceive may be 
useful, the delay of an hour or two in quit- 
ting town, will be of no great consequence." 

" Quitting town !" repeated Helena, ra- 



CONTRAST. 29 

ther faintly, and with a sudden chillness, 
she knew not why, at her heart â€” " for any 
length of time?" she tried to ask with 
carelessness. 

" It was quite uncertain," was the re- 
ply ; "just as he felt rambling about plea- 
sant or otherwise." 

" Oh ! a desultory tour," cried Helena : 
" pray, may I ask, in search of the pictu- 
resque or beautiful ?" 

" Oh ! not of the beautiful, assuredly," 
with a slight bow and a forced smile ; 
" for where could I be so certain of finding 
it, as where I now am?" 

" Gallant ! â€” but " and she hesitated, 

from not knowing how to introduce the 
subject that occupied her thoughts. 

JNlountfiorence, as if not heeding this 
hesitation, rose to examine a picture ; the 
cheek of Helena again flushed ; to be com- 
pletely piqued, was all that was requisite 
to restore her to self-possession. " This 
plan of yours is a bad one, I think, for 
you," she said. 

" As how?" demanded Mountflorence, 
with quickness, and turning towards her. 

** \Vhy, this going into the country,"

and she affected to laugh ; " for solitude, 
you know, is considered the nurse of woe ; 
and after what has occurred, I should con- 
ceive for the present â€” " 

" I really do not exactly understand 
you," said Mountflorence, gravely. 

" No ! why what I mean is, that till 
you have a little got over the feelings that 
must have been excited by the event of 
yesterday â€” the â€” the marriage in Berk- 
shire â€” it would be better for you to re- 
main where you are â€” where, in short, 
there's something to amuse the thoughts, 
than fly to woods, and wilds, and melan- 
choly glooms, for the purpose, I suppose, 
of writing loyal cantos of contemned love." 

" How kindly considerate in Miss Ross- 
glen to suggest what she has done!" said 
Mountflorence, with a heightened colour 
and a sarcastic smile ; " it is really evincing 
a concern, an interest for me, I did not 
flatter myself I had inspired." 

" Oh, that's being quite too humble," 
said Helena, trying to hide, under a feign- 
ed laugh, the confusion his manner occa- 
sioned. " I could not wish to render ma- 
jor Mountflorence vain; but I am per- 



CONTRAST. 31 

suaded, no one intimately acquainted with 
him, but must feel an interest in his con- 
cerns; as a proof of which, I make no 
doubt, there will be a feeling of general 
regret at the disappointment he has expe- 
rienced. But how has it come to pass 
that he has met with this ? for really no- 
thing could have more surprised me, than 
finding him entitled to a willow garland. 
Had his love been one of the proscribed â€” 
that is, I mean, like me, the case would 
have been different â€” accused of vanity, 
and coquetry, and I don't know what; 
but as she appeared, I never could have 
suspected her of playing a jilting trick ; 
and I do assure you," addressing herself 
with still greater earnestness to Mountflo- 
rence, " I feel for what you must suffer, 
through your disappointment in the object 
of your affections." 

" How kind, how consolatory the as- 
surance!" said ]Mountflorence, who had 
all this time been regarding her with fixed 
attention ; " and in what perfect accord- 
ance with the sensibility acknowledged for 
me, the manner and language in which 
Miss Rossglen has expressed herself! Yes,

I am indeed,'* and he became greatly agi- 
tated, " entitled to all the pity she has 
professed ; for I am at this instant suffer- 
ing all that can be inflicted by the disco- 
very of esteem and love thrown away â€” by 
finding where, unconsciously I may say, 
I had treasured up my heart, I mistook 
habitual propensities for the venial errors 
of youth and flattered vanity, by finding 
myself in every way deceived and disap- 
pointed in her I loved. How bitterly, 
how severely disappointed, need I say, 
when I add, the object of this impassioned 

attachment was " He paused; the 

name seemed to falter on his lips â€” but it 
was not requisite to utter it ; his look at 
the moment, the manner in which he 
grasped the trembling hand of his agitated 
auditor, rendered its absolute utterance 
unnecessary, and she became petrified 
with surprise. â€” " But she has my forgive- 
ness," he said, " for the cruel part she has 
just acted â€” for her attempt to amuse her- 
self with what she conceived the sore feel- 
ings of a lacerated heart ; and with it, my 
best, my most fervent wishes for her hap- 
piness â€” for her truly understanding the 



CONTRAST. 33 

value of it, ere too late !" and in uttering 
the last word, the hand he had so suddenly- 
taken was relinquished, and, ere an effort 
could be made to stop him, he had vanish- 
ed from the room. 

Helena remained for some minutes ri- 
vetted to the floor : could she believe what 
she had heard â€” this half-extorted confes- 
sion of his secret love? had she indeed 
been the object of it â€” the worshipped, the 
beloved, of the devoted heart of Mount- 
florence ? But did she merit his reproach- 
es ? and as she repeated them, she could 
not forbear exclaiming, in the language of 
Beatrice â€” 

' What fire is in ray ears ? can this be trne ? 
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much ? 
Then, Sigismund, love on ; I will requite thee. 
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.' 

" But, of what avail â€” of what avail," in 
bitterness of soul, she sighed, " the relin- 
quishment of all that was displeasing to 
him, when she should no more see him ; 
and, in the very moment of parting, she 
had done all that was possible to impress 
him with a belief of her being indeed in 
every way unamiable ? What malignant 
spirit actuated her to conduct herself to-

34 CONTRAST. 

wards him with such seeming heartless- 
ness, conceiving that he was suffering 
under the pain of disappointed hopes â€” 
what could have induced her to deport 
herself to him with the levity she had 
done ? what utter want of feeling must it 
not argue? and no wonder she had 
wrought him up, by the indignation it 
provoked, to the reproaches he had utter- 
ed. But why this long concealment of 
his real sentiments ? why allow her to re- 
main in ignorance of them, till it was too 
late, perhaps, for her to know them ? But, 
no, no ; she would not give up the happi- 
ness within her reach, without at least an 
effort for its attainment : it was but justice 
to herself, an effort for vindicating herself 
in his opinion; and since so unhappily 
circumstanced, that she had no one to in- 
terfere for her, she must interfere for her- 
self;" and accordingly, with her usual 
hastiness, she instantly decided on a letter 
to him, explanatory of the feelings he had 
so mistaken, and of all, in short, that she 
had ever thought or felt with regard to 
him and his. 
To decide and to act had ever been the 



CONTRAST. 35 

same thing with her ; not a minute was, 
therefore, now lost in writing this letter. 
But quick as she had been in dispatching 
it after him, he was gone before it reached 
lady Anstruther's, but would be forwarded 
after him, her messenger received an assur- 
ance. 

Well, an answer then might soon be 
expected ; and if the apology, or explana- 
tion, were received as she wished, she 
might soon expect to see him again, per- 
haps, at her feet ; and she was insensibly 
giving way to the most agreeable fancies, 
when she found herself suddenly involved 
in a new source of disquietude. The 
Bridgemores, ever on the watch, contrived 
to overhear the whole of the recent con- 
versation between her and Mountflorence, 
and also to ascertain the contents of the 
letter addressed to him; and the result 
was, a conviction, on the part of Mr. 
Bridgemore, that no further time was to 
be lost in setting about carrying his long- 
meditated schemes against her into effect : 
accordingly, the morning ensuing, he sent 
up a message, requiring a few minutes 
conversation with her. 



S6 CONTRAST. 

Helena, preferring her own thoughts at 
the moment, was strongly inclined to re- 
fuse the request, more especially as she 
knew nothing of importance he had to 
speak to her about ; but a fear of offending 
checked her, and she accordingly sent him 
word he might come up. The moment 
he entered, however, she expressed her 
hope that he was not about insisting on an 
inspection of accounts, as, from time to 
time, he artfully made a point of doing, 
that when matters came to be finally 
wound up between them, she might not 
be able to say she had been kept in igno- 
rance of her affairs, as she was never less 
inclined to any thing of the kind. 

" No, not exactly," was the reply; 
" though indeed I wish I could prevail 
on you to look over them oftener than 
you do. The affair on which I now re- 
quire a few minutes conversation with 
you, is one over which I have no control." 

*' Really! What can it be then ? There 
are no new ornaments yet wanting for the 
house, I conceive; and, except in mere 
matters of taste, you are aware you can 
act as you please for me^" 



CONTRAST. 37 

" Explanation will save the trouble of 
conjecture : when you learn my present 
business, you will then find it is one in 
which I could not act for you. Rumour 
has given you many admirers; in the num- 
ber, the prince " 

" Oh ! now I begin to comprehend you," 
said Helena, interrupting him : " he is 
considered a lover, and under the idea of my 
being about blessing him with my fair 
hand, some professional friend of yours 
has intreated your interest to have him 
employed in the affair of the marriage 
settlements. Well, whoever he is, pre- 
sent my compliments, and assure him, 
whenever a person of his description is re- 
quired, your recommendation will have 
due weight." 

" Poh ! poh ! this is all nonsense," said 
Mr. Bridgemore, pettishly ; " it is not on 
account of any such person I have now 
required to speak to you â€” in consequence 
of the generally-received opinion of a 
union being meditated between you and 
the prince Zamoski, but a man who, I 
must say, be you offended or not by the 
assertion, I conceive you have treated ex- 



38 CONTRAST. 

ceedingly ill ; in a word, sir Osbert Henley." 

" He !" cried Helena, in a tone of con- 
tempt, and her cheek flushing. " And 
pray, sir," she haughtily demanded, " let 
me ask through what circumstance does 
he conceive himself entitled to interfere in 
any intention of mine ?" 

" By the right which you gave him 
when you accepted his addresses," was the 
cool and irritating reply. 

" Yes," said Helena, with difficulty sup- 
pressing her feelings ; " but a right which 
ceased, the moment those addressee were 
rejected. The engagement into which 
my unfortunate ignorance of his real cha- 
racter was the means of betraying me, no 
longer exists, as you well know, sir." 

" Yes, I have not forgot what you 
told me ; but the question now is, whe- 
ther the other party is equally satisfied to 
consider it at an end: engagements are 
sooner entered into than broken ; what a 
young lady may deem a sufficient excuse 
for changing her mind, the world may not 
regard in the same light : if in her lover 
she expects to be addressed by a miracle 
of perfection, and on finding herself mis- 



CONTRAST. 39 

taken, discards him, she betrays a degree 
of romantic folly, that very justly exposes 
her to derision ; but which, at the same 
time, cannot by any means be admitted 
as an excuse for trifling with the feelings 
of an honourable admirer." 

" What am I to infer from this mode 
of expressing yourself, sir?" asked Helena. 
" Is it that you are advocating the cause 
of an unprincipled man ? But no, I can- 
not admit such a conclusion â€” I cannot be- 
lieve, that a person whom I have hitherto 
regarded in the light of a protector, would 
be capable of any thing of the kind." 

" I hope I am not capable of any thing 
that, as a man of common sense, I need 
blush for," coolly rejoined Bridgemore; 
" but whether offended or not, I must 
persist ill saying, I conceive sir Osbert 
very ill used, and unhandsomely treated 
by you." 

" Then, as it is a subject on which we 
must always differ in opinion," said He- 
lena, " the sooner we let it drop the bet- 
ter." 

" Not so hastily," cried Bridgemore; 
" sir Osbert is inclined to make a more 



40 CONTRAST. 

serious matter of it, than perhaps you ap- 
prehend." 

" As how ? But impossible ! â€” Yes, I 
repeat, 'tis utterly impossible, that he can 
conceive himself ill treated, aware, as he 
is, of the justifiable cause I had for break- 
ing with him." 

" I beg your pardon; he denies any 
thing of the kind ; and, as a proof, asserts 
your charge against him being of a general, 
not a specific nature. To come to the 
point, he has only refrained so long ex- 
pressing himself on the subject of your 
injurious conduct, in the hope that you 
might yourself reflect on it : but finding 
no likelihood of this being the case â€” that, 
instead of seeking to apologize, or make 
any reparation for it, you are encouraging 
the addresses of another, he conceives it 
high time to assert his prior right to your 
hand." 

" His right to my hand !" exclaimed 
Helena, in a tone of mingled surprise and 
indignation. 

" Why, yes ; we know you cannot be 
compelled to give it ; but, in common jus- 
tice, it will be acknowledged, I believe. 



CONTRAST. 41 

that, having been promised to one, it 
should not be bestowed on another." 

" What ! when he to whom it was first 
promised has proved himself unworthy of 
it ? Excuse me, sir, but I can no longer 
listen to arguments I deem almost insult- 
ing." 

" I am sorry for it," coolly taking a pinch 
of snuff ; " but, on many accounts, I deem- 
ed myself the properest person to interfere 
between you and sir Osbert." 

" And for what has he desired your in- 
terference ? â€” what is his object or view, 
in again obtruding himself upon my no- 
tice ?" 

" Why, the fact is, sir Osbert, to my 
knowledge, lost two most advantageous 
alliances, in consequence of your allowing 
him to conceive he was sure of your hand ; 
and the result is, his being unable to ex- 
tricate himself from some difficulties, in 
which the improvidence of others, not his 
own, has involved him ; and which, to 
discard all romantic nonsense, and speak 
at once to the point, he thinks he has, all 
circumstances considered, an undoubted 
right to look to you for relief from." 



42 CONTRAST. 

" Oh ! now I understand you," said He- 
lena, with a smile of ineffable contempt; 
" this is indeed speaking explicitly ; and 
in reply, I will acknowledge that, degrad- 
ingly as I previously thought of sir Os- 
bert, I still did not view him in the abject 
light in which you have now compelled 
me to regard him : but if you please, sir, 
we'll start some other subject." 

" And do you really suppose, young 
lady, that sir Osbert is to be so baffled, or 
put off? If you do, you'll find yourself 
wofully mistaken. Allowing his resent- 
ment at your conduct would suffer him 
to let the matter rest here, the predicament 
in which he has been placed through it, 
would prevent him. His creditors are so 
exasperated, that nothing short of satisfy- 
ing their demands, or proving that he was 
not deceiving them in his assurances re- 
specting you, can prevent their taking un- 
pleasant steps : I therefore advise, for the 
sake of preventing that publicity the affair 
must otherwise obtain, that you come, 
without delay, to some settlement, or 
compromise with him." 

" No," answered Helena, " for that 



CONTRAST. 43 

would be to imply a consciousness of be- 
ing in his power: his necessities might 
perhaps obtain assistance ; but his threats 
can only extort contempt : he knows it 
was his own worthlessness occasioned the 
breach between us, and sensible of this, he 
will not dare mention the affair !" 

" No !" cried Bridgemore ; " you have 
only, however, to refer to the daily jour- 
nals, to see what men dare do, who con- 
ceive themselves aggrieved by the caprices 
of fair ladies." 

" He is at liberty to do as he pleases," 
said Helena; "all I want is to hear no 
no more of him ;" and taking up a book, 
she began turning over the leaves. 

" Well, be that as it may," said Bridge- 
more, " I am glad, from your seeming to 
brave him, that you are not in any way in 
his power â€” that he has no written pro- 
mise, no letters, to produce, should resent- 
ment, or the instigations of others, prevail." 

Helena started, as if at the fang of a 
serpent, and in her emotion, let fall the 
book she had just taken up. Letters! oh 
the agitation, the sickening sensation, ex- 
cited by their mention ! â€” letters ! would 



44 CONTRAST. 

that she could confirm Bridgemore's sup- 
position of sir Osbert having none of hers in 
his possession ! but, alas ! no ; he had receiv- 
ed but too many from her in Ireland, hardly 
one of which would not make against her, 
not merely confirming his assertion of a po- 
sitive engagement having existed between 
them, but from the terms in which she 
had suffered herself to mention lady Ross- 
glen : good Heavens ! to think of the im- 
prudence of suffering such letters to remain 
in his possession ! â€” to allow such a circum- 
stance to slumber in her recollection, till 
it was thus agitatingly recalled ! but un- 
willing, after her explanatory letter, to 
have any further correspondence with him, 
she had voluntarily run a risk, rather than 
submit to what was immediately disagree- 
able : and now, how was she punished â€” 
how was she likely to be punished for this 
folly, this imprudence? Should these 
fatal letters become public, even supposing 
they did not immediately reverse the sen- 
timents of Mountfiorence for her, yet still, 
in common propriety, he could not any 
further notice a person who had so libelled 
his mother: and, in the agony of the 



CONTRAST. 45 

thought, all that in the world she com- 
manded, would have been gladly ex- 
changed for them ; but after the terms 
in which she had expressed herself of this 
hated man, now to humble herself, by the 
acknowledgment of any fear, by any indi- 
rect allusion to a compromise â€” no ; she 
would brave all, rather than do this ! and 
resuming her book, she motioned to Bridge- 
more to leave her. 

But hardly had he, in obedience to this 
intimation, retired, ere all the fearful con- 
sequences of the malice she was braving, 
rushing upon her distracted mind, she 
started up to recall him ; yet, no, she w^ould 
not aflford him the triumph such wavering 
would give him over her ; and rather than 
allow him this, would she incur the certain 
risk of Mountflorence's regard, and, in addi- 
tion, the odium of being the slanderer of 
domestic worth : yet to bend her proud 
and haughty spirit to the humiliation of 
confessing she feared him whom she des- 
pised ! but it must be done ; and, hark ! 
another minute and it might be too late, 
for she heard the voice of Bridgemore in 
the hall ; and rushing from the apartment, 



46 CONTRAST. 

she flew down stairs, calling to him to 
stop. Not receiving any reply, and con- 
cluding from this he was already gone out, 
her agitation became so excessive, that ere 
she got to the last step, she was compelled 
to pause, and lean against the banisters for 
support. 

There was no occasion however for this 
agitation : snugly calculating on what he 
thought likely to be the result of the 
alarm he saw he had excited, Bridgemore 
was in an adjoining parlour. â€” " Did I hear 
your voice. Miss Rossglen ?" he asked, at 
length making his appearance. 

" Yes," replied Helena, " I â€” I wish to 
have a little further conversation with you 
before you go out." 

" If not on very particular business, I 
wish you would postpone it till I come 
back," said Bridgemore, in a quiet tone, 
" for I always wish to be punctual in ray 
appointments ; and I made one for this 
morning with a certain gentleman, to let 
him know the result of our conversation 
about him." 

" Before you see him, I must say a few 
words to you," said Helena, turning into 



CONTRAST. 47 

a parlour ; " in short- " but her over- 
wrought feelings here utterly overpowered 
her, and she burst into tears. 

" What's the matter ?" demanded Bridge- 
more, affecting ignorance of the cause of 
her emotion. â€” " Did you hurt yourself 
coming down stairs ? for I saw that you 
were leaning against the banisters when I 
came out." 

" No," replied Helena, sighing heavily. 
" But the fact is, I am angry â€” vexed with 
myself, for my thoughtlessness in allowing 
some letters of mine to remain in the 
hands of sir Osbert : that can't be helped 
now, however; so as I was about con- 
fessing, on reconsidering your advice, 
I saw the expediency of following it ; and 
wish, therefore, to know what is the sum 
requisite for the arrangement of sir Os- 
bert's affairs ? or, in other words, that will 
induce him to relinquish my letters ?" 

" Why, perhaps you'll be startled when 
I tell you ; but then you should look on 
it as a compliment, for in proportion to 
the equivalent he demands for your loss, 
must be considered the estimation he held 
you in ; but ten thousand pounds is what 



48^ CONTRAST. 

he requires for his creditors, and nothing 
less than what satisfies them will be ac- 
cepted." 

Helena drew back aghast, at the men- 
tion of a sum of such magnitude : wealth 
had just begun to be of importance in her 
eyes, from the purposes to which she now 
looked forward to devoting it; and she 
could not accordingly think of such a di- 
minution of her property, without consi- 
derable reluctance. 

But, as may be surmised, arguments 
with Bridgemore on the subject were una- 
vailing. " Why, bless my soul !" he cried, 
with pretended petulance, " don't you sup- 
pose I would rather have this sum remain 
in your possession, than let it be transferred 
to his, if I could help it ? but I know the 
predicament in which he stands with his 
creditors must prevent any compromise 
with him." 

" Well, well, let him have what he in- 
sists on," said Helena, utterly heart-sick; 
" and let me hear no more about him." 

" Ay, ay, this is easier said than done : 
w^e must first see how this said ten thou- 



CONTRAST. 49 

sand pounds is to be got, ere we promise 
to give it." 

" Got !" repeated Helena ; " why have 
you not a much larger sum than that of 
mine still remaining in the funds ?" 

" Pob â€” nonsense ! that is drawn out 
long ago: and after all, what is seventy 
thousand pounds, to meet such lavish ex- 
penditures as yours ?" 

" What ! with my yearly income in ad- 
dition ? but can I really believe you, that 
all the property in the funds is gone ?" 

" Really, Miss Rossglen, these are very 
unpleasant interrogations, implying such 
doubts as they do. I wish you had paid 
a little more attention to your afifairs, as 
you know I repeatedly urged, and then 
you would not have felt the surprise you 
now evince." 

" I wish I had," said Helena, again 
sighing heavily : " I see I was extremely 
reprehensible in not attending to your 
suggestions, since it is a positive duty in 
every one to ascertain their expences, in 
order to avoid the risk of injustice to 
others ; but I hope it may not be too late

to acquire prudence: but since all the 
funded property is gone, where is the sum 
required for sir Osbert to be obtained ?" 

" Living in the fashionable world, and 
not know that !" said Bridgemore, laugh- 
ing ; " dear, what simpletons some of us 
remain to the last moment ! but don't dis- 
tress yourself â€” I shall manage that matter 
for you." 

" In what way ?" 

" Oh ! the old one â€” by seeking out some 
friendly Moses." 

Helena experienced an unpleasant sen- 
sation. " It cannot be avoided, I presume ?" 
she said : " but I own I am distressed at the 
idea of procuring money by such means." 

"Poh! there's nothing in it; such 
transactions are every day occurring : when 
you are more accustomed to them, you 
will be less sensitive." 

" Heaven forbid that I should ever be 
more so ! that as this is the first, so may 
it be the last transaction of the kind I 
shall ever be concerned in ! But let me 
not detain you : the sooner a disagreeable 
business is concluded the better," and she 
returned to the dressing-room. 



CONTHAST. 51 

What bitter reflections did she here 
give way to â€” what self-upbraidings did 
not the idea of the thoughtlessness, the 
extravagance, of which she had been 
guilty occasion ! when Mountflorence came 
to know her conduct, would he not fear to 
venture his happiness to the care of one 
who had seemed so reckless of her own ? 
But might not her youth, her inexperience, 
plead for her ? above all, those anxieties 
of mind she had lately been enduring, and 
which naturally create a carelessness to 
worldly matters ? 

Bridgemore was not slow in arranging 
the business he had undertaken. On the 
departure of the party to whom she gave 
her bond, Helena offered the notes received 
from him to Bridgemore ; but he declined 
then accepting them, saying they must be 
accompanied by a letter from her to sir 
Osbert, expressing the condition on which 
they were given ; " but which," he added, 
"she need not hurry herself to write, as he 
could not see sir Osbert until the ensuing 
day." 

She locked up the notes, on his refusing

to take them. The family were engaged 
abroad that day : she accompanied them, 
the engagement being to lady Lovel's. 
They stayed late : on returning, they found 
the whole house in consternation, through 
a very unpleasant circumstance that had 
occurred during their absence. The hall- 
door had been left open for a few minutes, 
at dusk, and advantage taken of this act 
of carelessness, at least, such was the story 
told, by some one in quest of plunder, to 
make their way to the dressing-room of 
Helena, and thence convey her writing- 
desk, and some other articles of value. 

What her sensations were at this inti- 
mation may be conceived, when it is men- 
tioned, that in this desk was deposited the 
sum raised for^sir Osbert ! She turned of 
a deadly paleness, and would have sunk 
to the floor, but for the timely inter- 
position of Mr. Bridgemore. On a little 
recovering from her agony of distress, he 
tried to sooth and calm her, by the hopes 
he held out of recovering the property, 
through the prompt measures he should 
take for the purpose. Helena tried to at- 
tend to him, but she had her presageful 



CONTRAST. 53 

fears, and retired to pass a night of wretch- 
edness. 



CHAP. III. 

" I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl : 
The secret mischief that I set abroach, 
1 laj unto the grievous charge of others." 

" Ay, it's exactly as I see by your looks 
you conjecture," said Bridgemore, as he 
entered her dressing-room the next morn- 
ing, on finding she had not courage to 
question him ; " I never once recollected 
I had not the numbers of the stolen 
notes, until I reached the bank; and be- 
fore I got back from the Jew's, whither 
I proceeded to obtain them, they were all 
changed ; so there's an end of that busi- 
ness !" 

" A sad one for me !" said Helena, with 
a deep sigh ; " what is to be done ?" 

" Deuce take me if I know â€” except to 
apply again to our friend the Israelite." 



54 CONTRAST. 

" What, give another bond ?" said He- 
lena, recoiling at the suggestion. 

" There's nothing else for it : sir Osbert's 
embarrassments render him a desperate 
man : and depend on it, even if he gave 
ear to the story of the robbery, he would 
not be diverted by it, from insisting on 
what he requires, aware as he is of your 
possessing the power of raising infinitely 
more than the sum in question." 

" In what a terrible predicament am I 
placed !" said Helena ; " do you suppose I 
can consent to have my property involved 
in this manner ?" 

" Just as you please," replied Bridge- 
more ; " if you care nothing about the pub- 
lishing of those letters he has of yours, I 
think you would be devilish wrong to 
trouble yourself more about him." 

Ah, those letters! how well the wily 
serpent knew how to bring her back to 
the point from which she had strayed! 
She sat for some time with her face cover- 
ed by her hand ; then raising her head â€” 
Â« I see â€” I see," she cried, " strive how I 
may, I must pay the full penalty of my 
imprudence!" and she forced herself to 



CONTRAST. 55 

give Bridgemore authority once more to 
seek the Jew. 

The dispatch used on this occasion 
might, in the minds of some, have excited 
suspicion ; but as yet the mind of Helena 
was free from this : her youth, her rank 
in life, and its associations, all combined 
to preclude that worldly knowledge that 
leads to distrust. She knew there was 
vice and iniquity in the world, but as yet 
it was only in the broad scale she had heard 
of them, not in detail. 

The second sum obtained for sir Osbert 
she immediately handed over to Bridge- 
more, with a request that he would not 
delay accomplishing the purpose for which 
it was intended. Impatiently she awaited 
his return. At length she heard his voice 
below; but, contrary to her expectation, 
he did not come up. After waiting some 
time, without seeing him, she went down, 
and found him quietly seated in one of the 
parlours, partaking of refreshment, with 
his wife and daughter. 

There was something so cruel in this, 
knowing, as he did, the anxiety she was 
under about her letters, that for a moment 



56 CONTRAST. 

she did not dare to speak ; then obtaining 
a little command over her angry feelings 
â€” " I rather thought, sir," she said, " that 
I should have seen you immediately on 
your return." 

" Did you ?" he said ; " well, perhaps 
so ; but really I felt so fagged with run- 
ning about the whole morning, that I could 
not possibly go up to you, till I had taken 
some little refreshment." 

" To be sure not â€” indeed I think it 
would have been odd if you had; for 
people are not to be slaves, let other 
people expect what they may," cried Mrs.r 
Bridgemore. 

" I am concerned you have been so 
much fatigued, sir," said Helena, calmly, 
and without appearing to have noticed the 
elegant observation of his lady ; "but if 
you'll only let me have my letters, I shall 
give you no further trouble for the pre- 
sent." 

" Letters! what letters?" with a vacant 
look, and in a corresponding tone. 

Helena started. â€” " Good Heavens !" she 
exclaimed, " you surely have not failed of 



CONTRAST. 57 

obtaining possession of them â€” that is, if 
you have settled with sir Osbert ?" 

" Don't be afraid of that â€” no further 
delay, I promise you, would have been 
allowed. However, I have settled the 
affair to your satisfaction." 

" Then give me my letters : you don't 
know the relief it will be to my mind, 
having them again in my possession." 

" You must wait a little : I put them 
aside, with some other papers I had in my 
pocket on coming in, and I am too tired 
to go for them now." 

** Then let me, or, if you prefer it, 
Fanny." 

" What, to throw my desk into confu- 
sion, like her own drawers, I dare say ? 
no, thank you â€” you'll excuse me there : I 
make it a rule never to allow any one to 
go to my desk but myself." 

" Well, it can be no great trouble, sir, 
your just stepping to it now ; or if so, 
let me, and Til promise not to disturb any 
thing." 

" You couldn't help it, for your letters 
are mixed up with other papers, so that 
d3 



58 CONTRAST. 

in searching for them, you must necessa- 
rily throw every thing into confusion." 

" I cannot avoid observing, sir," said 
Helena, indignantly, " that I think this 
conduct extremely unkind; neither, in 
consequence of it, urging my request." 

" Just as you please for that ; but after 
the fatigue I have already incun-ed on 
your account to-day, I promise you I shall 
give myself no further trouble for the 
present about any thing ; so you may as 
well exert a little patience, young lady ; 
and indeed it is high time you should be- 
gin to learn it, for you can't hope, or ex- 
pect, to go on sailing through life with a 
flowing sheet, as they say, as you have hi- 
therto done. You must look to meeting 
with your rubs, like other people. No, 
no, you , must not expect to be able to go 
on in this manner â€” the moment you have 
set your heart on any thing, obtaining it. 
I often told your grandmother, poor infa- 
tuated woman ! the injury she was doing 
you, by her ridiculous indulgence ; and 
crying you up, as she was continually 
doing, both to yourself and others, as a 
prodigy !" 



CONTRAST. 59 

The astonishment of Helena at this lan- 
guage, this sudden change of tone and 
manner, robbed her, for some minutes, of 
the power of utterance ; then, with forced 
calmness, but a lip tremulous with emo- 
tion â€” " I am afraid," she said, " it was 
not the only injury, unintentionally, she 
did me : with all my love and reverence 
for her memory, I long since began to 
fear her having done me an irreparable 
one, in estranging me from those connex- 
ions that had a natural interest in my wel- 
fare ; and circumstances have confirmed 
the apprehension." 

" You are at liberty to say and think 
what you please, ma'am," cried Bridge- 
more ; but, with a sneer, he added â€” " it 
is a pity that those near and dear connex- 
ions of whom you speak did not take 
some other way of evincing their great in- 
terest in your welfare, than by throwing 
vou off entirely." 

" Though you seem to forget, sir," said 
Helena, " that you are addressing me 
under my own roof, I cannot ; and shall 
therefore beg leave to withdraw, without 
any further reply to your observations." 



60 CONTRAST. 

This she accordingly did ; but in what 
a cruel state of agitation, feeling, as she 
did, the want both of advice and protec- 
tion at the moment, but without knowing 
where to apply for either ! for, after what 
had occurred, there was an end of any 
further confidence in Bridgemore ; and in- 
deed, it seemed, from his conduct, as if a 
decided breach were meditated with her ; 
but as she had just been told, rudely and 
roughly, she was not to expect to pass 
through life without her trials, and she 
accordingly endeavoured to collect and 
nerve her mind for what further might 
ensue. 

In the midst of the melancholy refleÂ©- 
tions the contemplation of her present si- 
tuation led to, she was interrupted by the 
deliveiy of a letter, requiring an imme- 
diate answer. Glancing her eye over it, 
she found it came from one of her trades- 
people, with an application for a debt of 
some magnitude, long due, and which he 
stated having so often in vain applied to 
Mr. Bridgemore for, as at length to deem 
it expedient to address her on the subject. 

Well knowing, from the large sums be 



CONTRAST. 61 

had of hers at his command, having, on 
coming of age, given up the whole of her 
personal property to his control, that there 
was no excuse for acting in this manner, 
Helena, sending word the letter should 
be attended to, repaired with it directly to 
him, and found him exactly where she 
had left him, conversing with his wife and 
daughter. Presenting the letter to him â€” 
" I must beg to know, sir," she said, " the 
reason of this â€” why the person this comes 
from has been compelled to make to me 
the appeal it contains ?" 

" For a very good reason," replied 
Bridgemore, coolly, after running his eye 
over it â€” " because there were no funds in 
my hands for satisfying him." 

Helena looked the dismay she felt at 
this intimation. â€” " What ! out of the con- 
siderable sums so lately given up to your 
disposal ?" 

" Even so ; the sums were large, but 
the expenditures were extravagant. If 
anxious for punctuality with those you 
dealt with, you should have tried to re- 
strain your idle prodigality. But you 
may as well prepare yourself in time for 



eST CONTRAST, 

more of those agreeable surprises; for, I 
promise you, many of them await you." 

Helena seated herself in extreme agita- 
tion.â€”" Be so good, sir," she said, " as to let 
me know exactly how I am circumstanced." 

" The documents I have to furnish you 
with will do that â€” they are prepared for 
your inspection ; for an immediate settle- 
ment must take place between us. Miss 
Rossglen: I have, for some time past, 
made up my mind to that â€” to no longer 
acting as your agent. Nothing but friend- 
ship for your grandmother, poor old wo- 
man ! could have induced me so long to 
do so, considering what I subjected my- 
self to by the circumstance ; but even that 
regard for the deceased can no longer in- 
fluence me to subject myself and family 
to a continuance of your insulting airs and 
caprices." 

" Oh, in what terms to express yourself," 
said Helena, " where your command of 
every thing was even more absolute than 
mine !" 

" Ay, whatever was troublesome or un- 
pleasant, you allowed to devolve on us, con- 
ceiving a full compensation made for this by 



CONTRAST. 63 

our being allowed to share the splendours of 
your mansion : but I must now beg leave 
to inform you, ma'am, that it was entirely 
to suit your convenience, not ours, that 
we took up our abode with you ; I do not 
aim at magnificence for my family ; such a 
residence as suits them, has for some time 
past been ready for their reception, and 
such a one as will prove to the world, I 
flatter myself, that whatever were the mo- 
tives that influenced our conduct towards 
you, they were not mercenary ones: as 
soon therefore as the accounts, I shall fur- 
nish you with, shall have been looked 
over, and subscribed as a release to me, we 
part ; and then, but not till then, the letters 
you are so anxious to regain, shall be given 
up." 

Helena had never perhaps exactly con- 
templated Mr. Bridgemore as a liberal- 
minded man ; but in a dubious light she 
had certainly never before considered 
him. This however was no longer the 
case ; and her distress at the circumstance 
was extreme, from finding, at the very 
moment that her confidence in his princi- 
ples began to be shaken, she was completely 



64 CONTRAST. 

in his power ; for while he retained these 
fatal letters, she assuredly was : yet how, 
without due consideration, could she think 
of submitting to the condition on which 
their restoration depended ? for if Bridge- 
more had nothing to fear, why attach any 
condition to the signing his accounts? 
Undecided how to act, in that state of pain- 
ful agitation that results from the idea of 
being compelled to depend on our own so- 
litary judgment, in perhaps a matter of 
the greatest moment to us, she quitted the 
apartment, desiring the accounts to be 
sent after her. 

Bridgemore was not slow in obeying 
this command, having urgent reasons for 
wishing thebusiness between them brought 
to a speedy issue. Helena found every 
thing accounted for ; still she was certain 
there were errors, or more correctly speak- 
ing, deception, in making up those ac- 
counts, more especially when, beside her 
two bonds to the Jew, she found herself 
brought in debt several thousands. But 
of what avail this persuasion, since, cir- 
cumstanced as she was, she feared allow- 
ing it to have any influence over her? 



CONTRAST. 65 

yet how heart-breaking to be obliged to sub- 
mit to what cut off, or at least delayed, the 
hope of happiness that was just springing 
up anew in her breast ! for since she could 
not retrieve the fortune of Mountflorence, 
she certainly would not be his, and that 
at present was out of the question, the 
whole of her personal property, according 
to the shewing of Bridgemore, being gone ; 
and her estate so involved, that instead of 
having the power of aiding others, she 
must make immediate reductions in her 
own expenditures. But these were not her 
only sources of sorrowful regret : richly left 
as she had been, and but the other day, as she 
might say, of age, what would the world, 
the reflecting part of it, at least, think â€” 
those whose good opinion she was anxious 
to retain, of the disclosure this reduction 
must occasion? â€” of what wanton waste, 
what shameful prodigality, would it not 
be the means of having her accused ? and 
look which way she would, she saw nothing 
but what was distressing before her : but 
she must make up her mind as to what 
Bridgemore expected â€” seeming hesitation 
might exasperate ; and accordingly, after a 



66 CONTRAST. 

painful struggle with herself, she sent for 
him, and, by signing her name, as he reÂ« 
quired, gave him the acquittance he desired. 
This done, she set about endeavouring 
to collect herself, in order that no time 
might be lost in the adjustment of mat- 
ters, so as to enable her to get out of the 
way of Mountflorence, being now, from 
the turn her affairs had taken, most anx- 
ious to avoid a meeting with him; for 
should he, in consequence of her letter, 
seek one, what excuse could she make for 
disappointing the hopes created by that 
letter, but by confessing the truth ? and in 
that there would be something so humi- 
liating. But how keep him in ignorance 
of what all the rest of the world knew be- 
side ? but no, she began to think it pos- 
sible the truth might be concealed â€” that 
by going abroad immediately, there would 
be a plausible pretext for breaking up her 
establishment, such as would prevent un- 
pleasant surmises ; and on this she there- 
fore presently decided. Lady Lovel had 
long been talking of a visit to the Conti- 
nent, and to obhge her, she made no doubt 
she would hasten her arrangements for the 



CONTRAST. 67 

purpose. But after the letter she had ad- 
dressed to him, what would Mountflorence 
say to her flying off in this manner, sup- 
posing she were fortunate enough to es- 
cape before he did, or perhaps could, an- 
swer it, for she knew not whither he was 
gone? Oh that she had not been so 
hasty in writing it ! â€” that she had allowed 
herself a little time for cool reflection, ere 
she addressed such a one to him !â€”that she 
had allowed herself to consider the awk- 
ward predicament in which she should 
place him, by the disclosure of her senti- 
ments, had his undergone any change! 
but she never gave herself time for thought 
until it was too late, and the consequence 
was always regret and repentance. 



CHAP. IV. 

Her domestics had all been of Mr. Bridge- 
more's providing, and on this account, ex- 
clusive of every other, Helena was anxious 
to break up her present establishment ; and 
as he had given her to understand he was 



68 CONTRAST. 

forming one of his own, she sought him 
for the purpose of inquiring whether, to 
the other obligations he had conferred, he 
would add the additional one of aiding her 
in this wish ? He readily consented ; 
and Helena then reminded him of his 
having forgot to return with her letters, 
which, on leaving the room with the ac- 
counts she had signed, he had promised to 
let her have immediately. 

" Ay, so I did," he answered, carelessly ; 
" but I find I have packed them up, with 
my papers, preparatory to my removal, so 
you must be content to wait a little longer 
for them." 

Helena could no longer command her- 
self â€” " This is a cruel and ungenerous 
trifling with my feelings !" she said, " and 
what, I think, I do not merit, especially 
after what I have just done!" 

" You may call it what you please," was 
the reply ; " but it could not be helped ; 
so I shall leave you, for I have something 
else to attend to, at present, than idle com- 
plaints." 

What utter want of feeling ! and at the 
idea of being subjected to such treatment 



CONTRAST. 63 

â€”of being, in a degree, at the mercy of so 
heartless a being, Helena could not pre- 
vent a gush of tears. She was freely in- 
dulging them, when the entrance of some 
one made her hastily uplift her head, with 
something of confusion at the idea of be- 
ing so surprised, and she beheld Mrs. 
Flower, the only one of her domestics 
whom she meant to retain, from her 
having been long in her service. â€” ^" Ah ! 
you, Flower," she said, " do you want me ?" 

" No, ma'am, not very 'particklery ; only 
I thought I would take an hearly hoppor- 
tunity of letting you know, that as there 
is a change about taking place in the fa- 
mily " 

" How do you know that ?'* asked her 
mistress, no preparations having yet com- 
menced to announce what was intended. 

This w^as a question for which the sou- 
brette was not quite prepared, and which, 
consequently, confused her a good deal. 

" Ah, I see how it is !" cried Helena, 
rightly interpreting her silence. " Well, 
pray what have you to say to that ?" 

*'Nothink, ma'am ; only that, as so many 
of my friends are going, I know 1 should 



70 CONTRAST. 

be so uncommon dull without them, I 
wish to go too ; more especially as Miss 
Bridgemore is just now looking for an at- 
tendant, and such a place might not come 
in one's way again." 

" Very likely not ; therefore you have 
my permission to secure it without a mo- 
ment's delay ; and now retire, and let me 
see you no more." 

" Oh ! no, ma'am, I didn't mean any 
thing of this kind," said Mrs. Flower, hop- 
ing a little extension of complaisance 
might be rewarded with Helena's usual 
generosity ; " I did not by no manner of 
means intend to take you at a njon plus^ 
or quit you till you had suited yourself." 

" Retire," repeated her lady, in a voice 
that proved she would be obeyed ; and 
the abigail withdrew, a little disconcerted 
by the failure of some of her speculations. 

Helena was vexed with herself, for al- 
lowing the conduct of such a person to have 
an effect upon her ; after Bridge more's, she 
wondered she could think of it : but con- 
sidering the kindness she had always 
shewn this woman, there was a base ingrati- 
tude in it she could not help being hurt 



CONTRAST^ 7t 

by. Impatient as she was to see lady Lo- 
vel, relative to the plan of going abroad, 
still too much had happened this day to 
disconcert her, to allow an effort for the 
purpose. She continued, for the remainder 
of it, shut up in her dressing-room, without 
hearing or seeing any thing more of the 
Bridgemores, ignorant when they would 
depart; but, of course, concluding they 
would never think of going without a for- 
mal leave of her. 

After a restless night, she was woke in 
the morning from a prolonged slumber 
by some one stealing into her chamber. 
Drawing back the curtain, she saw a 
young female, with whose countenance 
she was unacquainted. " Who are you?" 
demanded Helena. 

" If you please, ma'am," dropping with 
every word a courtesy, " I am Peggy, the 
housemaid, or, as they used to call me here, 
Margaret ; for they said as how that was 
the genteelest name of the two." 

" Well, and what brings you here ?" 
said Helena; but, recollecting the occur- 
rence of the preceding day, " I suppose 



72 CONTRAST. 

you have been sent here by Flower, as a 
substitute for her ?" 

" Oh no, ma'am !" was the reply, " I am 
come of my own accord, to see if you 
wanted any thing ; for Mrs. Flower is off, 
with the rest of them." 

" Rest of them !" repeated her lady, 
raising herself on her pillow ; " what do 
you mean?" 

" Why, ma'am, with Mr. and Mrs. 
Bridgemore, and her new missus. Miss 
Bridgemore. They went this morning, 
and some of the servants last night, and 
the rest of them with them to-day; so 
that now there's no servant left but my- 
self, and some of the out-door ones about 
the stables." 

Helena sprung from the bed, with a 
look of wildness : she could not have 
thought it posssible that they would have 
treated her in such a manner : yet, after 
all, what mattered it when they went? 
still there was a shock sustained by the 
abruptness of their departure, the utter 
desertion of her it signified, that she could 
not immediately get over. 

When at length, quitting her chamber. 



CONTRAST. 73 

she unconsciously roamed through the 
house, its silence, its desertion, bringing 
back that chilling sense of forlornness she 
had just experienced, she relapsed into 
those feelings she had with such difficulty- 
suppressed. As her eyes involuntarily 
wandered round the apartment, they sud- 
denly encountered the staring ones of the 
wondering INIargaret, now beginning to 
overflow with sympathetic tears, in conse- 
quence of those she saw dropping down 
her cheeks. 

" Ah I I thought," said the good-natured 
girl, misinterpreting the nature of her 
emotion, " that all was not right, choosing 
night instead of day for their packing up, 
and every one helping themselves to what 
they seemed to like best ; ' and so,' says I, 
to Mrs. Flower, my mind misgiving me, 
* Mrs. Flower,' says I, * does our lady know 
of all these here doings?' and so says she to 
me, in reply, tossing her head as high as a 
church steeple, as if I wasn't as good as her- 
self, being all servants alike, * Tut, you 
fool,' says she, making no bones of calling 
one out of their name, * what concern is 

VOL. III. E 



74 CONTRAST. 

that of yours ?' But, i'cod, ma'am, if I was 
you, I'd make these questions be answered, 
whether or not ; instead of bemoaning my- 
self in this here way, if I was you, that is, 
if I might make so bold as to advise, I'd 
pluck up my courage, and send for a coach 
and go to my lord mayor, and see if he 
wouldn't make them soon be cotched, and 
have you righted." 

" Ah ! my poor girl," unconsciously 
sighed Helena, " that would not be in his 
power, I fear ;" then, recollecting herself, 
and unwilling to confirm the suspicions 
she saw were entertained, she dismissed 
her to prepare breakfast. 

Of course, she decided on no longer de- 
laying her visit to lady Lovel ; but the for- 
lornness of her mansion would of itself 
have been sufficient to have driven her 
out. Short as was the interval since the 
departure of the Bridgemores, her ladyship 
was already apprized of it, through the 
good understanding* she had always kept up 
with them, or else their conceiving that 
those who had the first of a story had al- 
ways the best of it : but she had all this 
time been acting a double part : this, how- 



CONTRAST. 75 

ever, was nothing new to her ladyship, 
that is, while doing all in her power to 
undermine the Bridgemores with Helena, 
she was using every art to induce them to 
believe that she was the most devoted crea- 
ture in the world to their interests, and that, 
but for her persuasions, Helena v/ould long 
since have broke with them. Whether they 
credited her or not, it suited them to appear 
to do so, from the services she still had the 
power of rendering them in the fashion- 
able world; and accordingly she was the 
confident of the arrangements they were 
making for the commencement of their 
career in it. They could not deceive her, as 
to the methods they had recourse to, for 
the purpose of enabling them to accom- 
plish their ambitious views. It had been 
her earnest hope to have distanced them 
with Helena ; but since, spite of her arti- 
fices, they had succeeded in their schemes, 
she determined on participating in their 
spoils, and giving up the other party ; and 
to this she was influenced by many con- 
siderations. From all she could gather, 
nothing further, for some time to come 
E 2 



76 CONTRAST. 

at least, was to be expected from Helena : 
to keep up an intercourse with her, there- 
fore, could answer no other end, than to 
afford an opportunity of being remind- 
ed perhaps of obligations which she never 
meant to return ; yet without feeling that 
she should absolutely like to acknowledge 
this. If she gave her encouragement, who 
could tell but that she might make an at- 
tempt to fasten herself upon her, till her 
affairs came about again ? the safest and 
wisest way, therefore, and on which she 
accordingly decided, was to cut her, with 
all convenient speed. 

To enable her to do this, it was neces- 
sary she should once more admit her, be- 
ing persuaded that Helena would persist 
in callincr, until she had seen or heard 
from her ; accordingly, Helena was aUow- 
ed to find her at home this morning. 

She appeared occupied in writing at her 
entrance, and not to have noticed her, un- 
til some minutes after: when at length 
she chose to do so â€” " You here !" she 
said, uplifting her head from the writing- 
table, and pushing it a little way from her. 
" Well, and " but instead of allowing 



CONTRAST. 77 

herself to finish her intended question, 
turning to Miss Ogle, who, with her sis- 
ter, resided with her â€” " Any thing parti- 
cular in the paper of to-day ?" she asked. 

" Oh ! I can answer that question," 
cried Helena, throwing aside the book, 
which, after nodding to the Miss Ogles, 
she had taken up, on perceiving her lady- 
ship engaged ; " nothing new or extraor- 
dinary : but I am so glad," she said, still 
addressing herself to her, " to find you at 
home; having come for the express pur- 
pose of bestowing my tediousness on you 
this day." 

Lady Lovel rather stiffly bowed. â€” " I 
am sorry," she replied, in a constrained 
tone, " I cannot profit by the intended 
kindness, being most particularly engaged 
this morning." 

"Oh, no matter!" said Helena; "if 
you are not absolutely engaged to dinner, 
that will not prevent my staying." 

" I am engaged for the whole of the 
day," was the cold reply. 

" How unfortunate !" said Helena, still 
not perceiving her ladyship's drift, for 
when not suspicious of unkindness, we 



78 CONTRAST. 

are not apt to detect it; and here that 
could not be the case, from the professions 
that had been made, and the right she 
knew she had to expect attention and 
kindness ; " for I had so many things to 
consult you about ; but you can, however, 
briefly put me out of suspense, whether 
it will still be as convenient to you, as 
you assured me it was some time ago, to 
accompany me immediately abroad ?" 

" No, by no means." 

" No !" repeated Helena, involuntarily, 
and in a tone of surprise, at the abrupt- 
ness of the answer. 

" Certainly not," said her ladyship ; " it 
is now very doubtful my going to the Con- 
tinent ; but should I adhere to my original 
intention, I rather think I shall join a party, 
than make one for the purpose. How- 
ever, there's time enough to talk about 
that, for just now it is impossible I should 
think of going, with so many induce- 
ments for remaining, in the brilliant parties 
about taking place. There's lady An- 
struther's masquerade, and the duchess of 

C 's ball, and the marquis of Yâ€” â€” 's 

concert, and lady Lâ€” â€” 's theatricals ; and 



CONTRAST. 79 

beyond and above all, the superb r^gal 
d'entree of our friends the Bridgemores." 

Helena started, and the film, which 
false confidence had spread before her eyes, 
suddenly dropped from them ; she saw at 
once what was the intention of her lady- 
ship, and the discovery gave a shock to 
her feelings, that it needed all her exer- 
tions to conceal ; but pride made her strug- 
gle to conceal what she experienced on the 
occasion ; and after a little further coliver- 
sation, certainly of a forced nature, she 
calmly took her leave : but the command 
she had maintained over herself vanished, 
the moment she threw herself into the car- 
riage, and an hysterical burst of tears de- 
luged her countenance, at the base ingra- 
titude she had just met with. 

How little was she prepared for any 
thing of the kind! how little could she 
have apprehended it! how little that a 
person whom she had laid under such ob- 
ligations, as was the case with regard to 
lady Lovel, and on whose kindness she 
had, consequently, such claims, should so 
suddenly give her up â€” be so immediately 



80 CONTRAST. 

swayed by the first intimation of altered 
circumstances, to break with her ! but sa 
it was : and how many trials of a similar 
description might she not have to encoun- 
ter ! But this was not all she had to de- 
press and agitate her â€” lady Lovel's con- 
duct had quite disarranged her plans, and 
what to do she knew not, since where she 
w^as she would not, nor could not, remain; 
yet circumstanced as she was, without a 
suitable companion, where else to go she 
was utterly at a loss. 

Perplexed to a degree that bewildered 
her, she re-entered her deserted residence. 
She gave orders to be denied to every one ; 
but she might have spared herself the 
trouble, for no one called ; and from this 
circumstance, her sudden and seeming 
abandonment by all, she could no longer 
doubt that the policy that had induced 
the Bridgemores to make a partial confi- 
dent of lady Lovel, had also induced them 
to circulate a whisper to her prejudice, or 
in other words, give a hint of some de- 
rangement in her affairs, in the hope that 
it might be a means of driving her from 



CONTRAST. 81 

scenes, where confronting them could not 
be pleasant. 

From the inundation of bills that pour- 
ed in upon her the ensuing day, she was 
confirmed in this supposition ; for most of 
these she was certain she had seen receipts 
amongst the papers given up to her by 
Mr. Bridgemore, and she accordingly pro- 
ceeded to their examination ; but what 
was her consternation, on discovering the 
scrutoire in which they were deposited 
had been opened, and every one of any 
essential consequence extracted ! 

To so flagrant an attempt to make her 
again answerable for what had already 
been charged to her account, she could 
not think of submitting. The silence 
she had previously made up her mind to 
observing, on the subject of Bridgemore's 
conduct, could no longer be persevered in, 
threatened as she now seemed to be with 
downright ruin through his means. Every 
other consideration gave way to that of be- 
ing left at the mercy of a set of exasperated 
creditors ; and in utter alarm, as well as 
indignation at such atrocity, she decided 
e3 



82 CONTRAST. 

on immediately applying for professional 
advice. 

How bitter were now her reproaches to 
herself, for the inattention hitherto shewn 
to her affairs, and the unlimited confidence 
reposed in this unprincipled man ! yet, 
surely, in this instance, it may be said, 
she was not to blame, from the light in 
which she had early been taught to re- 
gard him ; and this reflection would doubt- 
less have suggested itself to her as a source 
of consolation, but for the consciousness 
of the imprudence she had been guilty of, 
being as much the result of her dislike to 
any thing like business, as to her high 
opinion of his integrity. But he knew 
not this ; and there was nothing therefore 
in any way to excuse or extenuate his 
conduct towards her, or prevent its ap- 
pearing one of the crudest acts of trea- 
chery that had ever been practised. How 
did she now feel the want of some con- 
nexion or friend to advise with, or inter- 
fere for her on the occasion ! But lamen- 
tation was useless â€” only a waste of that 
time it was necessary to devote to other 
purposes. 



CONTRAST. 83 

While considering who she should apply 
to, she recollected a solicitor of the name 
of Trueman, high in his profession, whom, 
her father had occasionally employed ; and 
sending for a carriage, she drove directly 
to his chambers, in Lincoln's-inn, and had 
the good fortune to find him at home. Hav- 
ing introduced herself, she proceeded to 
disclose the business for which she required 
to consult him. He Hstened to her detail 
with absolute astonishment, not, of course, 
from ignorance of the lengths to which 
the vile and the heartless are capable of 
going, but from the unparallelled effrontery 
there appeared in this case, this absolutely 
open attempt, as far as he could judge, to 
rob a person of iier rank of their property : 
a great deal of dark suspicion attached, in 
his opinion, to the story of the robbery, 
such as had really suggested itself to He- 
lena, though she knew not how to ac- 
knowledge the circumstance to herself: 
and altogether he considered Bridgemore 
a most atrocious character. The first thing 
to be done, was to endeavour to trace the 
abstracted notes : successful in this, and 
he flattered himself he should be able to 



84 CONTRAST. 

obtain some justice for her. In the mean 
time, he tried to sooth her agitated spirits, 
by an assurance of his prompt exertions. 

Greatly interested by so young and fair 
a client, Mr. Trueman attended her home, 
to receive himself from her the papers re- 
quisite for his further guidance in her af- 
fairs. Encouraged by the further confi- 
dence she reposed in him, he suggested 
the expediency of her taking up her abode, 
for the present, in the house of some friend. 

Helena involuntarily averted her head 
at this suggestion, to conceal the tears 
that started at it ; for, alas ! where was the 
friend to whom she could now repair? 

Her emotion was not unperceived by 
Mr. Trueman, and it confirmed his pre- 
vious suspicion, of her being without any 
positive protection at the moment. He 
had heard much of the amiability of lady 
Rossden, and he felt anxious to know 
what could have occasioned this implied 
estrangement between them. Helena was 
frank in her replies; and from what she 
detailed, the "impression on his mind was, 
that what she deplored was entirely to 
be imputed to some underhand doings, 



CONTRAST. 85 

on the part of the Bridgemores, whose 
interest it obviously was to detach her 
from her connexions. In this conclusion 
Helena was strongly inclined to join, inso- 
much as, more than once in the course of 
the preceding day, to have been on the 
point of addressing a letter to her ladyship 
on the subject, but still wanted courage, 
through a fear of finding herself, after all, 
mistaken. 

But she could no longer hesitate about 
the measure, from the strenuous manner 
in which it was now recommended to her 
immediate adoption, by her new friend: 
accordingly, the moment he departed, with 
a promise of sending a servant of his own 
to take it for her, she sat down to write 
her letter. 

Having declared her utter unconscious- 
ness of any thing that could have rendered 
her desei-ving of the neglect she liad met 
with, she proceeded to detail all the pain 
it had been the occasion of to her; and 
concluded by earnestly imploring her lady- 
ship not to keep her in ignorance, any 
longer, of the real cause of it. 

Her messenger returned to say, that 



86 CONTRAST. 

lady Rossglen was not at home, but that 
the letter would be delivered the moment 
she returned. 

From this instant Helena became all 
nervous agitation, through the momentary 
expectation she was in of either seeing or 
hearing from her; but the day passed 
away, without any kind of answer to her 
letter; another too in the same manner; 
and all further hope of any notice of it 
was relinquished. In this one instance 
then, tat least, Bridgemore was unjustly 
suspected; and bitterly, in consequence, 
would she have regretted what she had 
done, but that it was at the instigation of 
a person who might have accused her of 
self-will and obstinacy, had she rejected 
his advice. 

Well, all that now remained to do, was 
to ascertain whether Mountflorence would 
follow the example of his family, by de- 
clining any further communication with 
her ; but without exactly knowing whe- 
ther her regretted letter could yet 
have reached him, it was impossible for 
her to form a surmise on the subject. 
But from whom could she receive the in- 



CONTRAST. 87 

formation she was so solicitous for, namely, 
whither he was gone ? 

While vainly trying to consider, her 
eye was caught by the announcement of 
Mrs. Wetherall and her daughters' arrival 
in town, amongst other matters of fashion- 
able import, in a paper she was looking 
over; and through her, it occurred, she 
might be able to obtain the information 
she was anxious for, namely, where 
Mountflorence then was, and what doing ; 
but then, in such a state of mind to subject 
herself to her idle gossip and unfeeling 
curiosity, more especially appearing as it 
did, by giving her no intimation of her 
arrival, as if she wished to keep her in 
ignorance of the circumstance. Any thing, 
however, was preferable to the continu- 
ance of the torturing anxiety she was then 
enduring ; and accordingly, after a little 
further debating with herself, she decided 
on calling on her. 

Mrs. Wetherall had by this time the 
happiness of seeing one of her daughters 
married : a colonel Sedley had taken unto 
himself the eldest, and with the new-mar- 
ried couple she had come over, with her 



88 CONTRAST. 

other daughter. Always speculating, she 
flattered herself that during her sojourn 
in town, while colonel Sedley was prepa- 
ring matters for the reception of his lady 
at Winchester, where his regiment was 
quartered, she should become the inmate 
of Helena, or else of lady Anstruther, 
through the kind interference of dear lady 
Rossglen. 

Helena's she infinitely preferred the idea 
of being, from conceiving that with her 
she should be much more at liberty to do 
as she pleased ; but then, if she took up her 
abode with her, she gave up, from what she 
understood, all intercourse with the other 
parties ; and rather than do this, she chose to 
try her chance first with lady Anstruther ; 
and to her she accordingly repaired, almost 
directly on her arrival. In indulging the 
hope, however, that carried her so prompt- 
ly to her, she gave way to one destined 
to disappointment, her ladyship being one 
of the very last persons in the world likely 
to do any thing disagreeable to herself, 
and Mrs. Wetherall was certainly not 
a favourite : she received her, how- 
ever, with much seeming pleasure, for 



CONTRAST. 89 

smiles and professions cost nothing, and to 
some are habitual. 

Lady Rossglen and the girls had gone 
that very morning on a visit, a few miles 
out of town; and her ladyship availed her- 
self of the circumstance, to inform her 
visitor, but with a strict injunction to si- 
lence on the subject to lady Rossglen and 
the family, that Helena was a lost, ruined, 
undone creature, all through the most 
shameful extravagance, as the short period 
intervening since her becoming of age 
must prove. 

" Doubtless," was the reply of the great- 
ly-agitated Mrs. Wetherall, agitated to 
think that, if disappointed of an invita- 
tion where she was, and of which she had 
by this time become a little apprehensive, 
there would be no use in making an at- 
tempt for one from Helena, from the in- 
formation now received. 

It was not till she plainly saw what her 
ladyship's determination was, that she could 
bring herself to take leave, and return to 
the expensive hotel where colonel Sedley 
had left her. 

Her mind was soon made up about He- 



90 CONTRAST. 

lena; nothing further bein^ to be expected 
from her, like lady Lovel, she deemed it 
but common prudence to have done with 
her ; and, in consequence, decided on let- 
ting her remain unapprized of her being 
in London. 

Having so resolved, she was not a little 
disconcerted at the announcement of He- 
lena's name : how she came to learn what 
she wished her to remain ignorant of, she 
could not possibly divine, and for a few 
minutes she hesitated about admitting 
her ; but then, if she refused, she might 
be tormented with letters ; and so, since 
she had come, she thought she had better 
see her, that she might at once cut off all 
hopes of any services from her, if indeed 
she entertained any such foolish ones, from 
the reflection of their near relationship, as 
well as the recollection of certain profes- 
sions made at one side, and certain obliga- 
tions conferred at the other. Yet with all 
her confidence, she certainly did feel a little 
awkward at the idea of being perhaps com- 
pelled to exhibit herself in her true colours 
to Helena, standing in some little dread, 
as she did, of her sarcastic humour. 



CONTRAST. 91 

In her usual whirligig manner, when 
she meant nothing, running forward to 
meet her with extended hands â€” " My 
dear creature !" she cried, as she entered 
the room, " how transported I am to see 
you! but how did you learn our being 
here? since, expecting every moment to 
be able to call on you, I put off sending 
to let you know." 

" Through one of the daily papers." 

" Indeed !" with eyes sparkling with 
delight ; " what, mentioned amongst the 
fashionable arrivals I pray what paper was 
it, for I want to send one to Ireland ?" 

" I really don't recollect." 

" Not recollect ! well, really, it is asto- 
nishing what short memories some people 
have, or rather what a careless way of 
glancing over things ! however, I shall 
have all the fashionable journals of recent 
date brought up to me, and then I shall 
be sure of meeting with the one I want. 
But how is it that I have still to salute you 
by the name of Rossglen ? long before this, 
I expected to have heard of your chan- 
ging it: however, to be sure, there's no 
time lost â€” the bloom is not off the plum 



92 CONTRAST. 

yet ; and so as I was going to ask, have 
you heard of the marriage of your cousin? 
allow me to introduce her by her new 
name â€” Mrs. Sedley â€” a most satisfactory 
alliance, I assure you, the one she has 
formed, to all parties : but I quite regret 
not having an opportunity of introducing 
colonel Sedley to you, for if you saw him, 
you would really be quite charmed with 
him; but he set off, a few days ago, for 
Winchester, where he is quartered, to pre- 
pare for the reception of his bride." 

" It gives me pleasure to hear her mar- 
riage is so satisfactory a one," said Helena. 

" Oh, no doubt!" cried Mrs. Wetherall, 
bridling up ; " I never, however, despair- 
ed of her forming an alliance agreeable to 
her friends : but â€” however, there's no use, 
I suppose, in asking you any questions 
about our friends in Cavendish-square, for 
I understand there has been a long cessa- 
tion of all intercourse between you and 
them. Well, I must acknowledge I never 
found lady Rossglen, amiable woman! 
in the slightest degree capricious to me ; 
and I quite exult in the thought of her 
meaning shortly to return to Ireland, at- 



CONTRAST. 93 

tached as I am both to her and Woodston 
â€” dear Woodston ! with its woods and 
wilds, and melancholy glooms, and all 
those kind of things, so enchanting to 
taste and feeling !" 

Helena could not prevent a slight re- 
laxation of muscles. â€” " Is Ballyshandra 
yet ready for your reception ?" she asked. 

" No, not quite; but the depredations 
committed on it by the Goths and Van- 
dals in its vicinity, rendered repairing it a 
very expensive â€” that is, I mean, a very 
tedious business. All that was requisite 
for the exterior, however, has been done ; 
so," with one of her little affected laughs, 
" if not yet useful, it is at least ornamen- 
tal ; but you'll soon see an account of it in 
print. There has been an elegant tourist, 
and he has made such a beautiful sketch 
of it, both with his pen and his pencil ; 
but I am not at liberty yet to mention 
names. The pathetic legend of lady Eva 
is worked up by him into something so 
exquisitely affecting ! and in his drawing 
of the castle for the frontispiece, there's 
the ivy-shadowed window at which she 
received her death-wound, in the arms of 



94j contrast. 

her gallant knight. You'll really be quite 
charmed with the work â€” and not the less, 
I hope, for some very flattering compli- 
ments being paid me in the course of it. 
But the fact is, leaving anecdotes out of 
the question, there would have been no- 
thing of blunders in it, but for the author 
still referring to me, as he proceeded." 

At what was so very probable, Helena 
could not forbear laughing outright. 

There was something in her laugh dis- 
pleasing to Mrs. Wetherall ; she reddened, 
and looked inclined to be angry. â€” " You 
seem vastly amused. Miss Rossglen," she 
said ; " but I presume you understand, by 
blunders, that I meant national blunders.'* 

" To be sure, my dear ma'am," cried 
Helena, still laughing ; " it would have 
been a terrible one indeed, had you so ex- 
pressed yourself as to make me understand 
any thing else." 

" Whatever you may think, I can as- 
sure you," resumed the lady, " that this 
was not the first time I have been applied 
to, on literary subjects ; but strangers often 
see in one what their own connexions do 
not." 



CONTRAST. 95 

" True," assented Helena ; " but then 
it is because they see them more super- 
ficially." 

" When you read the work in ques- 
tion," proceeded Mrs. Wetherall, " you'll 
perceive, in the allusions made to me, that 
I do possess some little talent for inven- 
tion. â€” Ah! you smile again sarcastically 
â€” composition, I meant. I hate boasting 
â€” every thing indeed at all resembling va- 
nity; but this I must say, that had the 
cares of domestic life permitted â€” But it's 
no matter; I might not have exactly 
proved a second Sappho, perhaps. But, 
here I .am running on, as my friend, com- 
modore Mizen, says, at the rate of ten 
knots an hour, quite forgetting what mat- 
ters of importance are to be attended to. â€” 
Mrs. Sedley, my love, have you yet de- 
cided whether it is to the Opera you'll go 
on Saturday ? for you know lady Town- 
ley, charming woman ! is reserving her 
box until she hears from you. â€” And, Je- 
mima, have you settled about the pearl or 
emerald ornaments ? you know, I can't 
give you both ; you must wait until you 
get such a prize as your sister, to have all 



96 CONTRAST. 

your little vanities gratified. â€” Though, to 
be sure, in such a place as this," again ad- 
dressing herself to her visitor, " it is hardly 
possible to curb one's self. By the by, 
what magnificent ornaments your sisters 
have been presented with !" 

" My sisters !" unconsciously repeated 
Helena ; " oh, then you have seen them ? 
I thought, by your manner of expressing 
yourself â€” your saying you supposed it 
useless to ask me any questions concerning 
them, you had not been in Cavendish- 
square." 

" Oh, yes â€” yes, I have been there," said 
Mrs. Wetherall, but a little confused at 
having betrayed that she had time to go 
to one place, though not to another â€” 
" yes, I have been there : it was impossi- 
ble to avoid going, find time how I might 
for the purpose, the countess was so press- 
ing in her invitations." 

" Then from lady Rossglen herself, and 
her daughters, you surely could have ob- 
tained any information you required re- 
specting them, since their coming over, 
without applying to another person for it." 

" I don't know that, my dear. But 



CONTRAST. 97 

that's no matter â€” Have you heard about 
major Mountflorence?" 

" No," rather faintly answered Helena, 
lady Bellair suddenly recurring to her 
thoughts : " any thing particular ?" 

" Such good fortune !" ran on Mrs. 
Wetherall ; " a proof that what is to be 
will be. St. Finians, as I conclude you 
know, was on the very point of being lost 
to him, spite of all dear IVIr. Wetherall 
did to preserve it in the family ; but there 
were such incumbrances on it ! â€” so, as I was 
about mentioning, it was on the very eve 
of being announced for sale, when, lo and 
behold ! a letter arrives, with the informa- 
tion that a gentleman, under very great 
obligations to his father, for extricating 
him from some very awkward embarrass- 
ments, in which he got himself involved 
during the rebelHon, had left to him, Si- 
gismund, the whole of a very considerable 
property, realized in the East Indies. 
What the rejoicings w^ere on the occasion, 
I leave you to imagine ! the very welkin 
seemed in a blaze, from the reflection of

98 CONTRAST. 

the bonfires, kept up on the adjacent hills, 
for several successive nights." 

*' It must have been a most gratifying 
circumstance indeed," said Helena, with 
eyes swimming in tears of mingled sadness 
and delight, " the retaining in the neigh- 
bourhood the representative of a family so 
ancient and much beloved: and is this 
very lately?" 

" Oh no; some months ago; and St. 
Finians is again fitting up with great 
splendour, I assure you ; the major having 
abandoned, at least for the present, I be- 
lieve, his intention of going abroad." 

Helena sighed. What was she to infer 
from what she had just heard ? The ob- 
stacle which pride might have suggested 
to the addresses of Mountflorence to her 
had ceased for some time, without any 
advantage being attempted to be taken of 
the circumstance. Was it that the senti- 
ments he had acknowledged entertaining 
for her had really undergone a change? 
But she should soon be out of suspense 
on the subject â€” his answer to her still-re- 
gretted letter must terminate all incerti- 
tude on it. 



CONTRAST. 99 

" But though, I conceive, we shall have 
him and lady Rossglen constant residents 
in the neighbourhood," proceeded Mrs. 
Wetherall, " I deem it probable we may 
be deprived of your sisters, by their form- 
ing alliances here ; they are really grown 
such prodigious fine creatures, since their 
coming over." 

" They were always fine creatures," said 
Helena, sorrowfully. 

" True ; but then there was an air want- 
ing, just what they have acquired now. 
But I am going to pay you a bad com- 
pliment, my dear creature; you don't 
look at all like what you did when over 
with us â€” your bloom is quite gone ; that, 
to be sure," and she laughed, " is of no 
great consequence here, where its loss can 
so easily be supplied ; but then, with it, 
all your animation of look has fled â€” that 
which was indisputably allowed by every 
one to constitute your chief attraction." 

" A proof," said Helena, calmly, " we 
should value ourselves little upon advan- 
tages that are so transient." 

" Assuredly; but then looks will at-

tract, and But here I am going to be 

absolutely rude enough to turn you out ; 
but I know, with your wonted good- 
nature, and all that kind of thing, you'll 
forgive me, when I tell you, that I have 
more engagements for this day than I 
know how to keep ; but, beside our own 
immediate connexions, the friends of colo- 
nel Sedley are all so kind, 'pon honour it 
wdll be well if we escape from them with- 
out being absolutely spoiled, they make 
such a piece of work about us; but the 
first leisure day I have, before going to 
Winchester, should such a one occur, I 
shall let you know, and then you can 
come and pass it quietly with us." 

Helena slightly bowed, hardly conscious 
of what she was saying, her attention 
being attracted, at the moment, by a 
gentleman's hat, lying on a distant table, 
the owner of which she could not help 
experiencing a little degree of curiosity 
to ascertain, from having evidently heard 
some one retreating from the room, as she 
was entering. 

While regarding it, she recollected she 
had not yet made the inquiry she was so 



CONTRAST. 101 

anxious to have answered ; accordingly, 
endeavouring to collect herself for the 
purpose â€” " Where is major Mountflorence 
now ?" she asked, but in rather a hesita- 
ting tone, spite of her efforts to the con- 
trary. 

" Major Mountflorence !" repeated Mrs. 
Wetherall. " Where is he ? what, at this 
precise moment ? â€” That is more," and she 
laughed, in a curious way, Helena thought, 
" than I can tell you." 

" Oh, it's of no consequence," said He- 
lena, but colouring as she spoke, from the 
manner in which she imagined Mrs. We- 
therall was regarding her. " But I shall 
now take leave," she added, " as, of course, 
I am detaining you within." 

" Well, good bye, my love," said Mrs. 
Wetherall, shaking hands with her; " I 
shall not press you to stay longer, as I 
really want to go out : should we meet 
again " 

She paused ; and, without allowing her 
to think how she should finish the sen- 
tence, Helena, hastily withdrawing her 
hand, nodded to the young ladies, who 



102 CONTRAST. 

had all this time maintained an unbroken 
silence, and took leave. 

She felt that she could hardly have re- 
frained much longer from some indication 
of the contempt the utter heartlessness 
of Mrs. Wetherall and her daughters had 
excited ; and aware that she should regret 
giving any utterance to it, she was in a 
hurry to depart. 

The apartment she had quitted formed 
one of a suite of rooms opening into a 
gallery. As she was proceeding along 
this, wondering how two beings so nearly 
connected as her father and Mrs. Wether- 
all, should yet differ so essentially from 
each other, chancing to glance into one of 
the rooms she was passing, to her utter 
surprise and confusion, she beheld Mount- 
florence, leaning pensively against the 
mantelpiece. Their eyes encountered at 
the same moment ; and, with a sudden 
flush on his cheek, Mountflorenee was 
coming forward, when Helena, darting 
to the stairs, swiftly descended them, and 
throwing herself into the coach that was 
in waiting for her, directly returned home. 

Mountflorenee then was the person she 



CONTRAST. 103 

had heard retreating as she entered Mrs. 
Wetherall's apartment ! What a shock to 
every feeling, the idea ! and how did she 
rejoice, as she dwelt on the circumstance, 
at having yielded to the indignant impulse 
that actuated her at the discovery ! Mrs. 
Wetherall's peculiar laugh, on her inquir- 
ing about him, was now accounted for ; and, 
not satisfied with deciding on shunning 
or breaking off all further intercourse with 
her, he had afforded others opportunities 
of triumphing at the circumstance, by re- 
vealing his intention to them. Could she 
ever have believed, that she could have 
met with any thing so cruel, so unkind, 
from him? But to what disappointments 
had she been doomed, in her friendships 
and affections! He was returned then 
from his tour; but not in consequence of 
her letter; no, to that, silent contempt 
was all that was to be shown. Why â€” 
why had she committed herself by such a 
one ? â€” why had she opened her too-ardent 
heart to one so unworthy of its tender- 
ness ? Yet, if his sentiments for her had 
really undergone a change, how else could 
he well have acted, than he had done, 



104 CONTRAST. 

after what had occurred between them ? 
Oh yes, he might have acted differently, 
without doing any thing to deceive, or 
keep her in error ; he might have avoided 
whatever was likely to give a sudden shock 
to her feelings ; but not merely to decide 
on shunning her, but to let this be known 
â€” could she ever forgive such conduct? 
No, never, never ! she felt. 

Even supposing she had offended him 
in their last interview, which she conceiv- 
ed probable enough, how fully had she 
explained the feelings that had led to the 
seeming levity of the moment ! and after 
such an explanation, to treat her with such 
cruel scorn ! But this cold, this flinty 
heart, if not indeed complete adamant, 
should yet be goaded by her ; she would 
sequester herself, * where none should be 
able to trace her ; and when in incertitude 
of her fate, alarm was excited, what might 
not be the remorse of him and his, for 
their conduct towards her ! At the 
thought of being yet so revenged, a kind 
of delirious joy pervaded her heated brain, 
and she became wildly impatient to carry 
her plan into effect. 



CONTRAST. 105 

k 

The ill success of Mr. Trueman in en- 
deavouring to trace the stolen notes, and 
extort some confession relative to the ab- 
stracted receipts, did not tend to make her 
waver in her determination ; besides which, 
her creditors became clamorous, so much 
so, that he was at length obliged to come 
to a settlement with them, by which it 
was agreed that her estate should be given 
up for a certain period, or in other words, 
until the final liquidation of her debts, 
with the reserve of three hundred a-year 
for her. 

This arrangement would in itself have 

been sufficient to have driven her from the 

world, dooming her, as she conceived it 

did, to downright penury. Now indeed, 

had she previously hesitated, she could no 

longer do so about her plan ; for what had 

she longer to do, amidst scenes in which 

she could no more mix ? No ! immediate 

flight from them was now the only thing 

for her ; and, fortunate in finding such a 

solitude as she sought, what should allure 

her back to them ? more especially when, 

from the time that must elapse ere the re- 

F 3 



106 CONTRAST. 

trieval of her fortune would permit of her 
return, all the blooming flush of life must 
be fled â€” all those gay hopes and feelings, 
that give interest to scenes, in themselves 
often vapid and unmeaning ; and she wept 
bitterly over a destiny, she could not help 
calling cruel. 

Mr. Trueman tried to argue her into 
some degree of composure ; but she had 
been too sadly disappointed â€” too greatly 
irritated, to allow him to succeed in his be- 
nevolent efforts for the purpose. He who 
had been walking through this great wil- 
derness for many years, he could have told 
her, as he did, that what was formidable in 
perspective, was short in review â€” that re- 
tirement was the nurse of wisdom, and 
that from a temporary seclusion from the 
world, she would return with experience 
and reflection, to guide her through its 
numerous shoals and quicksands ; but she 
would hearken to nothing that could be sug- 
gested for the purpose of consolation. She 
would not be induced to believe that there 
remained for her any further enjoyment, 
and she would prove what she thought of 
the baseness and ingratitude she had met 



CONTRAST. 107 

with, by renouncing the world for ever. 
Mr. Trueman could not think of in- 
ducing her to remain where, of course, 
from what had occurred, she would be 
subjected to many mortifications; but he 
mentioned several places, where, with the 
income she retained, the pleasures of con- 
genial society would still be at her com- 
mand : but no, no â€” Helena would not 
be persuaded of this; besides, it would be 
subversive of her plan, to take up her abode 
where curiosity, or solicitude, might be 
gratified about her ; and finally, having se- 
cured such a retreat as she desired, she 
persisted in repairing to it. Having ex- 
torted a vow of secrecy from Mr. True- 
man, respecting her retreat, by a declara- 
tion, that if he did not pledge himself to 
this, she would go, where even he should 
not be acquainted, she departed from the 
metropolis, with her new attendant, Mar- 
garet, whose ambition did not go beyond 
being engaged as a substitute for Mrs. 
Flower. Helena tried to believe her mind 
was steeled to indifferenceâ€” to every thing ; 
but when the moment for departing actu- 
ally arrived, the tears that burst from her, 



108 CONTRAST. 

as she entered the carriage that was to 
convey her away from her splendid man- 
sion, proved to her she was mistaken ; but 
she could not help comparing herself at 
the moment to some bright exhalation, 
that ere well seen, has passed away, so short 
had been her career in the world of fashion. 



CHAP. V. 

But in suspecting, or rather accusing, 
Mountflorence of what she did, of care- 
lessly subjecting her to the sneers and ri- 
dicule of the unfeeling, it need hardly be 
said, that Helena did him injustice; yet 
that he wished to shun her, was certainly 
a fact ; but entirely through the awkward 
predicament in which he found himself 
placed, by the disclosure his irritated feel- 
ings had provoked : after such a one, how 
could he meet her with that semblance of 
indifference he wished to maintain? be- 
sides, what might it not have led her to 
expect ? and against any offer, any serious 
overture, he was decided. He still admired 



CONTRAST. 109 

her ; more â€” he could not deny to himself 
his still loving her; but the captivation of 
his senses could not blind him to the ma- 
nifold faults and failings, recent circum- 
stances had induced him to impute to her ; 
and thinking of her as he now did, he 
conceived that he should indeed merit un- 
happiness, if, in defiance of his judgment, 
he made an effort to identify their fates. 

He had early been prepared to find in 
her a creature that might be dangerous to 
his peace ; and expectation was not disap- 
pointed on seeing her; but his quickly- 
conceived passion was resolutely struggled 
against, lest otherwise it might subject him 
to imputations unworthy of him ; and 
when the alteration in his circumstances 
would have permitted, without any fur- 
ther opposition from pride, its disclosure, 
the alteration effected in his sentiments, 
partly through the conduct of Helena her- 
self, and partly the artifices of those who 
had an object in estranging them, deter- 
mhied him to be as guardedly silent as 
ever on the subject. 

But neither resentment nor displeasure 
could subdue the tender interest she had 



lia CONTRAST. 

inspired â€” an interest which, exchisive of 
every other consideration, he felt he must 
ever retain for her, as the daughter of sir 
Maurice Rossglen; and a rumour of some- 
thing unpleasant having occurred in town, 
reaching him in the country, he returned 
immediately, for the express purpose of 
making inquiries on the subject, of lady 
Anstruther. 

Her ladyship did not deny that there 
had: she knew there was no use in the 
assertion of a positive falsehood to him, 
from the information he could obtain in 
other quarters ; and to prevent, therefore, 
his asking questions where he might learn 
the exact truth, thought it best to seem 
to answer explicitly all he addressed to her. 

She acknowledged that Helena had got 
herself involved in some difficulties, but 
entirely through disregarding the prudent 
advice of her worthy friends, the Bridge- 
mores, in consequence of which they had 
separated themselves from her, and she 
was on the point of breaking up her es- 
tablishment, and proceeding to the Conti- 
nent, until matters came round again. In 
short, she so represented, or, more cor- 



CONTRAST. Ill 

rectly, misrepresented facts, as to induce 
Mountflorence to believe, that the blame 
of all that had occurred, rested solely with 
Helena herself: but this persuasion could 
not lessen his anxiety about her â€” on the 
contrary, it rather increased it ; for if, with 
friends interested in her welfare, she had 
acted so indiscreetly, into what impru- 
dence might she not be betrayed, when 
left to her own unchecked guidance ? 

But miserable as the idea of her going 
abroad rendereil him, through this reflec- 
tion, interference on the subject was out 
of the question : he could not, after the 
conduct his mother had experienced from 
her, think of applying to her for hers ; 
and she, or lady Anstruther, to whom he 
knew his doing so would be downright 
useless, was the only person who could, 
with any propriety, interfere in her con. 
cerns : but why passively endure the un- 
easiness he was experiencing on her ac- 
count? why not try to obtain for himself 
a right to counsel and watch over her? 
with all her faults and imperfections, was 
she not still a creature deserving of the 
regard of a generous heart? but no-^in 



112 CONTRAST. 

proof of this, what was there? not her 
conduct to his mother and sisters â€” not her 
cruel coquetry with lord Glena â€” nor, if 
possible, her still more heartless levity to- 
wards himself; and he was forced to ac- 
knowledge, when he did review past cir- 
cumstances, that it was the manner in 
which she had charmed him, not the con- 
viction of his judgment, that led him to 
try and find excuses for her. 

But did her letter offer no extenuation 
for her ? that letter, so candid, so ingenu- 
ous, so interesting, or at least calculated 
to interest, from being a history of the 
heart that dictated it ? no â€” but for a very 
sufficient reason â€” its never reaching him ; 
lady Anstruther having views of her own 
to accomplish, which it was very much 
calculated to subvert ; and she accordingly 
made no scruple, after possessing herself 
of its contents, on its being delivered to 
her to enclose to him, about retaining 
it. Lady Bellair, the widow of the late 
viscount, had remaining under her care a 
ward of his lordship's, between whom and 
her eldest son, lady Anstruther was very 
anxious to effect an alhance ; towards this. 



CONTRAST. 113 

however, the young lady herself did not 
seem much inclined; but by the exertion 
of a little influence, her ladyship flattered 
herself in time she might be brought to 
favour the idea. 

To obtain what was so desirable, she 
had recourse to every art in her power, to 
conciliate lady Bellair; and as a further 
means of winning her to her interest, on 
discovering that she was not insensible to 
the merits of Mountflorence, set herself 
most zealously to work, to try and render 
him sensible of his good fortune, in mak- 
ing such a conquest ; but all in vain were 
her efforts for the purpose, although lady 
Bellair was acknowledged by every one 
to be a very charming creature; but she 
would not despair : he had not succeeded in 
deceiving her wath regard to his sentiments 
for Helena, and these once subdued, she 
flattered herself there would be no further 
obstacle to her wishes, in this instance. 

Conceiving this, she determined that it 
should not be her fault if he still conti- 
nued to think of her : accordingly there 
was nothing that could make against He- 
lena that was not reported to him : for 



114 CONTRAST. 

the purpose of having a spy upon her ac- 
tions, she renewed her intimacy with lady 
Lovel, and was by her apprized of every 
thing that could tend to her prejudice; 
for lady Lovel saw what the wish of her 
ladyship was. 

Believing and repeating, however, are 
two distinct things; and that she gave 
credit to all she heard from lady Lovel, 
was certainly not the case, particularly in 
what related to the Bridgemores, of whose 
real character she was by no means igno- 
rant ; but she acted as if she did, and the 
injury was of course the same to Helena, 
being one of those casuists who think the 
end justifies the means; and though for- 
tune was no longer an object to him, she 
still could not avoid considering a mar- 
riage with lady Bellair a most desirable 
thing for Mountflorence ; but he still held 
out, both against the smiles of the one, 
and the representations of the other ; but 
in time, and he must come to, she made 
no doubt, more especially kept in igno- 
rance, as he w^as, of Helena's real senti- 
ments, by the withholding her letter : yet 
how provoking to be compelled to take so 



CONTRAST. 115 

much trouble to persuade him to a measure 
so much to his advantage ! it really was 
enough to make her inveigh against him ! 
his romantic folly, in pretending it would 
militate against his principles, to make an 
offer of his hand without his heart, as if 
that was a thing of any consequence, where 
interest was so much concerned; but it 
was just like his mother, being so scrupu- 
lous and so absurd in his notions; as a 
proof of which, her being most ridiculous 
in hers, was her still continuing to dis- 
figure herself in her frightful weeds, and 
of course refraining from going into pub- 
lic, though assured there were two or three 
men of exalted rank, who had pronounced 
her a prodigious fine woman. When 
people were in the world, she liked to 
see them acting like people of the world; 
but lady Rossglen had always appeared to 
be actuated by obsolete ideas ; and the 
result was, more than one opportunity for 
the advantageous disposal of the girls be- 
ing lost ; but she should take care to pre- 
vent their suffering more through her ro- 
mantic folly, or any of the silly notions 
they had imbibed through their half-ante- 



116 CONTRAST. 

diluvian education ; they were now, in a 
great degree, under her control, and it 
would be strange, she thought, if she did 
not succeed in turning the circumstance 
to advantage. 

Lady Rossglen's wish to escape her 
teazing importunities to act contrary to 
what were her own notions of propriety, 
inducing an ahnost continued stay at 
Richmond, had been the means of throw- 
ing them more completely into her hands 
than she had at first calculated on ; and 
long before this, she had begun to profit 
by the circumstance. 

To weaken their affection for their mo- 
ther, she soon perceived was not in her 
power; but she did not find the same 
difficulty in gradually inducing them to 
believe her notions a little antiquated, and 
to act accordingly. 

It was just at this time, as her insidious 
maxims were beginning to operate, that 
lord Glena arrived from the Continent, 
full of revived love and pleasing expecta- 
tion ; but his satisfaction at finding his 
fair Dorinda still disengaged, was a good 
deal damped on ascertaining the control 



CONTRAST. 117 

she was under. Fastidious in his notions, 
and cautious in the extreme, he immedi- 
ately decided, cost him what it might, on 
curbing the feehngs that had hurried him 
back, until assured no evil resulted from 
what had displeased him. The reserve 
consequent on this determination disap- 
pointing the hope that had, perhaps, un- 
consciously to herself, lingered in the fair 
bosom of Dorinda, her lowered spirits led 
to inquiries on the part of her aunt, that, 
extorting the truth, occasioned such rail- 
lery, as to induce her, at length, to give 
herself up to her ladyship's direction ; and 
the result was, a determination to play off 
one rival against another, her aunt assur- 
ing her, that rousing the jealousy of a 
lover, and not pining for him, was the 
surest way to win him. 

Just about this period, she had obtained 
a new admirer, in the person of the old 
duke of Birkenbog, who having unex- 
pectedly succeeded to the wealth and titles 
of his family, through the decease of his 
nephew, had made up his mind to taking 
unto himself a wife ; and in pursuance of 
this determination, that is, rousing the jea- 



118 CONTRAST, 

lousy of lord Glena, Dorinda decided on 
giving him encouragement. 

But, for prevailing on her to do this, 
her aunt had a deeper motive than she 
was aware of. To hope to be able to per- 
suade her to at once accept his addresses, 
lady Anstruther knew would be idle ; but 
by inducing her to act in this manner, she 
trusted she should get her to so entangle 
herself with him, as to find that, when it 
came to the point, it was impossible to 
draw back. She was indeed most anxious 
to see her his, instead of lord Glena's ; not 
merely from his superior rank, but infi- 
nitely more, the consideration, that from 
his advanced age, there was every proba- 
bility of Dorinda, if united to him, being 
soon at liberty again, with a title and for- 
tune that would render it a very pleasant 
thing to have an ascendancy over her. 
But this was not all : acquainted with the 
afiair between Caroline and lord Selwyn, 
and the ridiculous part sir Maurice and 
lady Rossglen had acted in breaking it ofi^, 
she set herself to work to effect its re- 
newal ; and through the very strong incli- 
nation of the respective parties to aid her 



CONTRAST. 119 

efforts for the purpose, succeeded as she 
wished. 

But Dorinda was a little out in her cal- 
culations with regard to lord Glena; the 
method she had recourse to, in conse- 
quence of the insidious advice given her 
for alluring him back, was, of all others, 
the one that was least calculated to answer 
the end in view ; since, whether he consi- 
dered her conduct as what it was really 
intended for, or as a proof of her thinking 
seriously of a man it was impossible she 
could feel any favourable sentiment for, it 
was equally unworthy of her, a proof of her 
being no longer the pure, artless, unso- 
phisticated creature he had once conceiv- 
ed her, and, of course, no longer deserving 
the regard of a devoted heart. 

Such, however, was the passion she had 
inspired, that he tried to hope and believe 
what so offended and displeased, might be 
entirely the effect of some undue influence 
exerted over her by her aunt; but when 
watching her, wherever they met, he saw 
her still smiling, apparently voluntarily, 
on her ancient admirer, he could no longer 
indulge this idea, and in the transport of 



120 CONTRAST. 

indignation its relinquishment excited, re- 
solved on quitting the scenes she frequent- 
ed immediately. 

But though he gave up the daughter, 
that w^as no reason why he should break 
with the mother, the amiable lady Ross- 
glen, whom he must always love and re- 
spect ; accordingly, he proceeded to Rich- 
mond, to pay her a farewell visit, and de- 
sire to know whether she had any com- 
mands to honour him with to Ireland. 

His emotion was so great, in announ- 
cing his intended departure, and his de- 
parture itself was so unexpected, from the 
expectations he had certainly given rise 
to, in some preceding interviews with her 
ladyship, that she could not help the ex- 
perience of a little surprise. Pride and 
delicacy, however, of course, restrained 
her from any comment on either circum- 
stance ; but they occupied her thoughts ; 
and she was puzzling herself to try and 
account for them, when a letter from his 
grace of Birkenbog, requesting her sanc- 
tion to her daughter's acceptance of his 
addresses, opened her eyes at once to the 
truth, convincing her, as it did, that to 



CONTRAST. 121 

jealousy was owing what had perplexed 
her. But could it be â€” was it possible, 
that Dorinda could have given any just 
cause for this ? Yet, certainly, from the 
manner in which his grace had expressed 
himself, it did rather seem as if she had ; 
for, without lier permission, would he have 
written such a letter? She thought she 
had known her too well, to have been 
ever induced to think her capable of sacri- 
ficing herself to ambition; and still she 
would not believe, that if any thing of the 
kind was meditated, it v/as from her own 
voluntary impulse: till satisfied on this 
point, that no undue influence had been 
exerted over her, she decided against an- 
swering the letter that had occasioned so 
much surprise, and without loss of time 
repaired to town. Her first glance at Do- 
rinda convinced her something was wrong ; 
she found her the very picture of despair, 
overwhelmed with regret and terror. 

Hardly conscious of any thing, from the 
effect produced upon her feelings, by the 
abrupt departure of lord Gleha, advantage 
was taken of the circumstance to persuade 

VOL. III. G 



122 CONTRAST. 

her she had gone too far with the duke, to 
be able to draw back with propriety, or 
refuse her consent to his writing to her 
mother, on the subject of his addresses. 

After a few fond caresses, coming to 
the point, lady Rossglen produced his 
grace's letter ; and having read it aloud â€” 
" Did you fully consider what you were 
about, my dear girl," she asked, " when 
you permitted such a letter to be address- 
ed to me ?'* 

Dorinda hesitated to reply, and glanced 
at her aunt. 

" Assuredly she did," said her aunt, 
understanding her glance, and answering 
for her. " You give your daughter credit, I 
presume, for common sense; and possessed 
of that, she could hardly fail to be sensible 
of the advantages resulting from a union 
with wealth and rank." 

" Both are desirable," said lady Ross- 
glen, mildly, " but not alone sufficient for 
happiness. I should therefore be sorry 
to see a child of mine allying herself, 
merely for the sake of them." 

" Really, lady Rossglen," cried lady 
Anstruther, petulantly rising, and pacing 



CONTRAST. 128 

the room, " I do most sincerely wish that 
you would descend from the stilts on 
which you have so long elevated yourself; 
and since in the world, act like a person 
of the world. Excuse me, but what can 
possibly be more absurd, than your trying 
to persuade your daughter â€” as if young 
people were not always sufficiently in- 
clined to be ridiculous, of their own ac- 
cord, without being urged to folly by 
others â€” that nothing but a romantic at- 
tachment should induce her to give her 
hand ?" 

" Pardon me," said lady Rossglen, calm- 
ly, " but such is not the interpretation 
to be put on the observation I have just 
made: most strenuously I should oppose 
an imprudent attachment, from a convic- 
tion that, without a competence, there 
cannot be happiness ; but this conviction 
could not induce me to sanction one origi- 
nating alone in selfish considerations." 

" I know not what you comprise in the 
term happiness," said lady Anstruther, 
" but I rather believe there are very few 
G 2 



124 CONTRAST. 

women of your rank, who would not con- 
ceive rank and riches a security for it." 

" Possibly: nevertheless, except Do- 
rinda positively assures me she feels a 
preferable regard for the duke, I shall op- 
pose the acceptance of his addresses." 

" Pray, ma'am, permit me to ask," said 
her nephew, Angus, who happened to be 
present, " have you seen his grace ?" 

" Yes, I have had the honour of an in- 
troduction to him." 

" That being the case, can you possibly 
doubt â€” that is, if she be sincere â€” receiving 
from my fair coz, the assurance you deem 
requisite for permitting him the honour 
of becoming your son-in-law, susceptible 
as she is, and calculated as he is to charm 
and fascinate a youthful heart ?" 

" I wish, Angus," said his mother, im- 
patiently, " you would not interfere in 
what does not concern you." 

" Dear ma'am, how can you say such 
a thing ! as if whatever promised to be an 
accession to the honours of our family were 
not a matter of moment to me." 

" I beg you will desist, sir,'* said her 
ladyship, still more angrily ; then turn-

ing from him to Dorinda â€” " Well, Miss 
Dorinda," she said, " we await your 
decision. Since your mamma has so dis- 
creetly left it to you to decide in this 
affair, I hope you will justify the confi- 
dence she must, from such conduct, re- 
pose in your prudence, by determining, 
without hesitation, in favour of his grace." 

Dorinda, greatly distressed, shrunk back, 
and looked piteously at her mother. The 
silent appeal was understood â€” " I perceive 
how it is," said lady Rossglen ; " there has 
been a little persuasion here, which Dorinda 
had not firmness to resist, but now feels 
yielding to would render her miserable; 
and of course I am no longer at a loss how 
to answer the duke's letter." 

" Grant me patience !" exclaimed lady 
Anstruther, losing almost all command 
over herself, in the threatened disappoint- 
ment of the speculations in which she had 
been indulging ; " but how can I retain 
my temper, and listen to such folly ! And 
you. Miss Dorinda â€” silly, ungrateful girl ! 
is this the way you requite my exertions, 
to render you the envy of your own sex, 
and the admiration of the other ? But, no 



126 CONTRAST. 

matter; I perceive the uselessness of ar- 
guing with a person supported in wilful 
blindness to their own interests ; and so, 
were it not for one consideration " 

This was the hope, that through the 
younger sister, she should be compensated 
for the disappointment sustained through 
the elder, having actually succeeded in 
drawing Caroline in to consent to an elope- 
ment with lord Selwyn. 

Finding she had taken up a book, lady 
Rossglen conceived herself at liberty to 
withdraw, which she accordingly did, 
with her agitated Dorinda; and having 
soothed her into a little composure, she 
proceeded in quest of Caroline, of whom 
she had had but a glance since her arrival. 

The fact was, there was a consciousness 
about Caroline, that made her shrink from 
encountering the eye of her mother. She 
knew she was about acting, in direct op- 
position to her wishes, and she could not 
help therefore disliking for the present the 
idea of any communication with her; in 
short, her courage so much failed her at 
her sight, that, to reanimate it, she was 
obliged to have recourse to a letter of her 



CONTRAST. 127 

lover'sâ€” one in which he conjured her, as 
she valued his happiness, not to disappoint 
the hopes she had given him. In the act 
of perusing this, she was surprised by her 
mother; in extreme confusion, she put it 
hastily aside â€” her agitation was not unno- 
ticed, and led to a suspicion that deter- 
mined lady Rossglen on seeing what was 
attempted to be concealed from her, not 
without a bitter pang at the thought of 
the arts that must have been had recourse 
to, to estrange the confidence of her chil- 
dren thus in a degree from her. After a 
little conversation, for the purpose of al- 
lowing the affrighted girl some time to 
recover herself, she calmly inquired who 
the letter was from, she was reading, at 
her entrance ? 

Caroline, turning pale and then red, 
and then pale again, hesitated to answer. 

" What am I to infer from this hesita- 
tion ?" asked her mother ; " am I to infer 
from it, my dear girl, that a short time 
has been sufficient to effect such a change 
in your feelings, as to prevent that confi- 
dence you once reposed in me? Answer 
me candidly : do you imagine you can 



128 CONTRAST. 

have a sincerer friend than your mother ?** 

" Oh ! no, no," was the reply ; " but '' 

and in a dilemma she knew not how to 
extricate herself from, Caroline burst into 
tears. What should she do ? if she re- 
fused to be explicit, she inflicted a wound 
where she could not endure the thought of 
giving pain â€” yet, if candid, she must dis- 
appoint him, who had vowed he depended 
on her for happiness ! The struggle be- 
tw'een love and filial duty lasted for some 
time, but the latter prevailed ; and putting 
the letter of lord Selwyn into her ni other's 
hand, she quitted the room. 

Lady Rossglen was at no loss to account 
for all that now was revealed to her. She 
saw at once that it was cowing to the in- 
fluence of lady Anstruther; and she ac- 
cordingly decided on an immediate sepa- 
ration between her and her daughters, 
since no advantage that could accrue from 
their introduction into life under her aus- 
pices, could compensate, in her opinion, for 
the subversion of those pure and inge- 
nuous feelings that had so assiduously 
been cultivated. 

The season was delightful for travelling ; 



CONTRAST. 129 

and in order to have a plausible pretext 
for what she resolved on, she decided 
on a tour to the lakes; and returning 
about midsummer, to take her departure 
for Ireland. The countess was all irrita- 
tion at her plan, completely frustrating as 
it did her own schemes ; but^ild as was 
lady Rossglen, yet where she conceived 
she was right, she was firm. 

But she did not think of quitting the 
metropolis without wishing it were pos- 
sible to see Helena, and come to some ex- 
planation with her. Her anxious inquiries 
about her, compelled Mountflorence to 
impart the truth, namely, the embarrass- 
ments in which Helena had got herself 
involved, and her being gone, as he un- 
derstood, to the Continent. 

Lady Rossglen was greatly shocked by 
his communication, and in the first mo- 
ments of the distress and agitation it occa- 
sioned, could haye reproached herself for 
not being more peremptory in her demand 
to see Helena ; yet had she not done all 
but subject herself to a rude repulse, in her 
efforts for the purpose? Mountflorence 
g3

accompanied the party, but in a state of 
mind that prevented any great degree of 
pleasure being derived from the idea of 
the excursion. The sudden departure of 
Helena was a surprise to him; had he 
been apprized of her intention of depart- 
ing immediately, he would have been on 
the watch, to endeavour to ascertain whi- 
ther she went ; and his having missed the 
opportunity, was the cause of no little re- 
gret to him. More than once, in the im- 
patience of torturing anxiety, he de- 
manded why he had entailed such mi- 
sery upon himself, by resisting the impulse 
that would have led him to identify their 
fates ? but regret on the subject \vas use- 
less, if indeed experienced ; she was now 
completely lost to him, and he tried to 
banish her his thoughts ; but unbidden she 
would come to them ; alone, and in com- 
pany, she still recurred to them ; and he 
could not at times avoid thinking, that in 
former days her soul seemed congenial to 
his ; and that had circumstances then per- 
mitted his yielding to his feelings, felicity 
might have been theirs. 

The party were not exactly in that state 



CONTRAST. 131 

of complacent feeling requisite to permit 
the mind to enjoy the contemplation of 
the works of nature, agitated as was each, 
by secret as well as general regrets ; yet, as 
it was, occupied as they were with anxious 
concerns, still they could not find them- 
selves, amidst the sublime and romantic 
scenery of the lakes, without emotions of 
the liveliest nature being at times awaken- 
ed â€” feelings at once elevating and sooth- 
ing being excited. 



CHAP. VI. 

" Hide not thy poison with sugar'd words : 
Lay not thy hands on me : forbear, I saj' ! 
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting." 

All this time, sir Osbert was plotting to 
allure the Bridgemores from the residence 
that afforded them security from his wiles, 
to some place where they would be com- 
pletely at his mercy. He had permitted 
Bridgemore to make use of his name with 
Helena, but solely with a view to his own 
immediate aggrandizement, not with any 



132 CONTRAST. 

intention of either allowing him to quietly 
retain the wealth it was a means of en- 
abling him to despoil her of, or yet of 
being indebted to Miss Frances for any 
participation in it; but even though she 
had not been an object of such utter dis- 
like to him, he would still have hesitated 
about an alliance with her, from the con- 
viction that such a measure could hardly 
fail to confirm the rumours to his prejudice, 
that might yet get afloat through Helena's 
natural resentment at her wrongs : and 
though he could rest satisfied under the 
secret consciousness of meriting the appel- 
lation of a villain, he shrunk from the 
thought of being publicly branded with it, 
from the consequences that must ensue. 
But to completely wipe away suspicion 
from him, that which must exclude him 
from those scenes in which he alone 
existed, he saw nothing so likely as a 
union with Helena herself: but how to 
bring about such a thing, with the change 
her sentiments for him had undergone, 
with such as he had voluntarily allowed 
her to imbibe against him, by his acqui- 
escence in the schemes of Bridgemore, was 



CONTRAST. 13S 

a question not readily to be answered. 
To a mind daring and unprincipled as his, 
however, nothing morally possible could 
appear impracticable ; and he accordingly 
permitted himself to indulge a remote 
hope of yet being able to accomplish what 
he wished ; or, in other words, succeed in 
again drawing Helena into those toils she 
had so unexpectedly extricated herself 
from: but, as a preliminary measure, it 
was absolutely requisite his getting the 
Bridgemores into his power, since only 
by depriving them of their ill-gotten 
wealth, could he hope for the retrieval of 
his affairs ; but how to accomplish this with 
impunity, was the question. At length, 
after various plans had been alternately 
formed and rejected for the purpose, he 
suggested to Bridgemore the expediency 
of withdrawing for a while with his family 
from notice, until the public had ceased 
canvassing his conduct with regard to 
Helena, or rather, till the general impres- 
sion respecting it was ascertained ; as till 
then, by remaining where he was, he in- 
curred, he conceived, the hazard, not merely 
of insult, but personal danger. 



134 CONTRAST. 

After the arrangements he had made 
for astonishing the fashionable world, 
Bridgemore was very unwilling to follow 
this advice: the consciousness of guilt, 
however, rendering him easily alarmed, 
he did not long hesitate; and, accompa- 
nied by sir Osbert, the family were on the 
very eve of departing, when Mrs. Bridge- 
more, by taking it into her head to die 
just at the moment, delayed the measure 
for a little while : but no sooner was she 
quietly inurned, than they set off. Their 
plan was to proceed to the Continent ; but 
ere repairing to it, sir Osbert pleaded ur- 
gent business in Ireland, that first required 
his presence there ; and thither accordingly 
their course was steered. 

The place to which he took them was 
of a very dismal description, an old ruin- 
ous building on the headland opposite to 
Woodston, long given up to the occupa- 
tion of an old man, of very dubious cha- 
racter, and his wife, the parents of a confi- 
dential servant of sir Osbert's, and per- 
fectly adapted, from the dreariness of its 
situation, for the perpetration of any vil- 
lany. Yet it had once been a tower of 



CONTRAST. 135 

strength, and a place of consequence ; but 
the vestiges of other days only served to 
render its aspect of decay now more de- 
plorable. The humble cottage sinking 
into ruin is passed by unheeded; but the 
lordly tower, bending beneath the weight 
of years, excites ideas that fasten on the 
soul, and imbue it with melancholy. 

Nothing could exceed the dissatisfaction 
of the father and daughter at being brought 
to so cheerless a place ; rude and rough in 
all his ways, the old gentleman grumbled 
and growled, and the young lady pouted 
and exclaimed. 

Sir Osbert exerted all his conciliating 
arts to try and sooth each into better hu- 
mour, representing that his stay here would 
be a very short one : with the father he, 
in some degree, succeeded; but nothing 
could reconcile Miss Bridgemore to even 
a transient sojourn in such a spot, so ap- 
palling was its gloom and loneliness to her 
imagination â€” inclined as she was to super- 
stition, and still under the influence of the 
mournful images impressed upon her fancy 
by the recent melancholy event in the fa- 
mily ; in short, she could hardly command 



136 CONTRAST. 

herself, as she looked about her, the dreary- 
evening of their arrival, and listened to 
the blustering of the wind, the dashing of 
the waves, and the screaming of the sea- 
gulls, or forbear, with all her complaisance 
towards sir Osbert, reproaching him for 
bringing her to such a place ; but she 
should not â€” she would not be long de- 
tained in it ; neither, she was determined, 
on the Continent, where sir Osbert chose 
to have their marriage celebrated. Im- 
mediately on its taking place, she decided 
she would return from abroad, and try 
whether the united advantages of rank 
and fortune would not be sufficient to en- 
able her to overcome any prejudice that 
the rumour of her father's conduct towards 
Helena might have occasioned against her. 
Day after day elapsed, and still no ex- 
act moment was fixed by sir Osbert for 
their departure from this abode of wretch- 
edness; neither was the business which 
had brought him to it, satisfactorily ac- 
counted for ; but this was not all that dis- 
concerted the lady â€” an apprehension be- 
gan to be awakened that she was not quite 
that object of adoration to sir Osbert that 



CONTRAST. 137 

vanity had previously allowed her to im- 
agine; her father now imparting to her, 
that what had occasioned her some sur- 
prise, namely, the postponement of her 
marriage till her going to the Continent, 
was entirely owing to his refusal of a con- 
siderable sum of money which sir Osbert 
had demanded of him, and he had reso- 
lutely resolved not to grant, until he had 
given himself a legal right to claim it, by 
becoming his son-in-law. 

In resentment at the circumstance â€” in 
anger at the apprehension it excited, a 
thousand times she was ready to burst out 
into invective ; but still checked herself, 
lest if any alteration had taken place in the 
sentiments of sir Osbert, for of once being 
an object of attraction to him, she would 
not permit herself to doubt, he might take 
advantage of her reproaches to break with 
her ; and what would then become of her, 
unassured as she was of being allowed, by 
the name she now bore, to mix in the 
fashionable world. 

Sir Osbert continued to importune 
Bridgemore on the subject of an accommo- 
dation, representing without it the impos- 



138 CONTRAST. 

sibility of his making such arrangements 
as he wished for his marriage : but Bridge- 
more was inflexible; the unprincipled 
must ever distrust each other, and from 
the resolution he had avowed to his daugh- 
ter, he determined nothing should induce 
him to swerve. 

Finding him thus obstinate, sir Osbert 
began seriously to meditate on the plan, 
that, vaguely conceiving, had been his in- 
ducement for alluring him to this deso- 
late place ; for his money he must have, 
and that without linking himself in the 
way required for the purpose of obtain- 
ing it ; but what he was capable of re- 
motely contemplating, he could not view 
immediately at hand, without a recoiling 
sensation ; but this was folly â€” a weakness 
of the nerves, that must be conquered : 
for what did not the unprincipled Bridge- 
more, the selfish despoiler of the confiding 
orphan, merit? â€” and his daughter, she, 
who untouched by any feminine feeling, 
could, without interfering, behold the play- 
mate of her infancy, the companion of her 
youth, mercilessly plunderedâ€” was not she 
an object of equal detestation ? and he re- 



CONTRAST. 139 

solved on speedily ending the struggle he 
was now enduring. 

Abandoned to the suggestions of an 
evil heart, and what is there of atrocity 
we are not capable of committing? unprin- 
cipled as sir Osbert was, yet there was a 
period, and that not a very remote one, in 
which he would have stood aghast at what 
he now meditated ; but our first shrinking 
sensations at absolute guilt overcome, how 
imperceptibly are we drawn on to incur 
the punishment due to our transgressions! 
The father out of the way, the daughter 
could easily be managed, he conceived, so 
as to make her give up the property of 
her father, which he had contrived to dis- 
cover was secreted, and once possessed of 
which, he should see how she was finally 
to be disposed of, so as to occasion him no 
further trouble. 

The greater part of every day was pass- 
ed by sir Osbert away from his compa- 
nions, without explaining where or how; 
and this was another source of discontent 
to the lady, arguing as it did, in her opi- 
nion, carelessness or indifference about her. 



140 CONTRAST. 

Her father went out one morning, to 
amuse himself, as he said, by rambling 
about. In a sullen mood, at being left 
alone, she was pacing up and down a large 
apartment, into which she had unconsci- 
ously strayed, from the one where the party 
generally assembled, when her attention 
was attracted by a narrow end window, 
commanding a long line of solitary road, 
straggling amidst the cliffs. As she stood, 
involuntarily contemplating this, perhaps 
with a hope of making some discovery 
about sir Osbert, whose conduct had ex- 
cited scarce less surprise than anger, she 
suddenly beheld her father crossing to the 
difFs, next the sea, just where they fear- 
fully beetled over, and the next instant, 
sir Osbert following, with stealthy pace, 
upon his steps, so cautiously, that it was 
evident the other knew not of the circum- 
stance. She continued to watch their 
movements: her father began to ascend, 
and had just gained the brow, when sir 
Osbert sprung up after him, and with out- 
stretched arms, forced him over the preci- 
pice. 

She saw no more ; with a shriek of hor- 



CONTRAST. 141 

ror, she fell lifeless on the floor. How 
long she remained in an insensible state 
she knew not. On recovering, she raised 
herself, with difficulty, and, with a shud- 
dering sensation, cast her eyes again upon 
the end window; but the lonely road, 
with the wild cliffs that hemmed it in at 
either side, was all she now beheld. Could 
she believe in the reality of what she had 
just seen? could she indeed believe that 
her lover, her destined husband, had be- 
come the destroyer of her father ? With 
eveiy faculty benumbed with terror, she 
sat down. Hardly had she done so, ere sir 
Osbert rushed into the room, his face 
bloodless, his air betokening perturbation 
and confusion. â€” " Oh, I have found you 
then at last !" he cried, and he was hastily 
approaching her, when the sight of her 
deathlike countenance arrested his steps 
â€” " Are you ill ?" he demanded, in a fal- 
tering voice ; " or has any thing occurred 

to â€” to alarm " 

" No â€” nothing â€” nothing â€” is the matter 
with me," replied Frances, with the in- 
stinctive cunning of fear, persuaded that 



142 CONTRAST. 

her life depended on present caution ; " I 
only feel â€” feel myself a little cold." 

" No wonder, in this great dreary apart- 
ment ; but how, in the name of wonder, 
did you make your way to it, through the 
heaps of lumber that fill up the inter- 
vening passages ?" 

" I don't know : on being left alone, I 
went straying about, not knowing what 
to do with myself, and so by chance dis- 
covered this room." 

" And have you been long in it ?" ask- 
ed sir Osbert, eagerly, with an alarmed 
glance at the end window, as he made the 
inquiry. 

" No â€” not ve â€” ry long ; only a few mi- 
nutes," Frances forced herself to reply. 

" And you are sure, that since you en- 
tered it, you met with nothing to discom- 
pose â€” you saw nothing to disturb, to agi- 
tate ?" 

" No ; I saw nothing but what I have 
seen every day since I came here â€” desola- 
tion and misery." 

" How unkind this reproachful an- 
swer! But we shall not now be much 
longer here: and now let me lead you 



CONTRAST. 143 

hence, for I too feel the damp air of this 
apartment chilling," and as he spoke, he 
would have taken her hand; but shrink- 
ing from his touch, with an inward shud- 
der, she passed out by herself â€” " Frances," 
cried sir Osbert, hastily following her into 
the sitting-room, *' there appears to me 
something most extraordinary in your 
manner this morning â€” a strangeness I 
have never before observed, such as makes 
me very doubtful of your being sincere in 
your replies to my questions." 

" I have told you," she replied, trying 
to avoid his scrutinizing looks, by rest- 
ing her head on her hand, " that this place 
has affected my spirits." 

" Well, be that as it may, I am reaUy 
concerned this morning, to find you in the 
state you are, having something to com- 
municate that will require all your firm- 
ness to support : your father, unfortunate 
man!" He paused; but there was no 
look, no inquiry of any kind, and he pro- 
ceeded â€” " tortured with remorse for his 
conduct to Helena, has â€” destroyed him- 
self! For some time past I have suspect- 
ed what his intention was, and hence, in 



144 CONTRAST. 

a great measure, the conduct that I know 
both surprised and displeased you â€” my ab- 
senting myself so continually from you, that 
I might keep watch over him ; but, spite 
of all my vigilance, this morning, ere I 
could reach him, he had gained the summit 

of one of the highest cliffs, from which 

but you may guess the dreadful rest. At 
the foot of it he now lies, a mangled corse ; 
and had I entertained any previous doubt 
of the dreadful catastrophe being owing to 
himself, a letter found in his pocket would 
have removed it. Now, what I would 
suggest, my dear creature," in a softened 
tone he added, and sitting down beside 
her, " is, that this deplorable affair, for 
the sake of all parties, his reputation, and 
our interests, be concealed ; for, if reveal- 
ed, the letter I have alluded to must be 
produced, and then necessarily follows 
restitution to the person of whose wrongs 
it speaks, and so ruin to our prospects â€” 
our prospects, I say, because, of course, 
from the engagement subsisting between 
us, I consider our interests completely 
identified. In this out-of-the-way place, 
and with the people belonging to it so 



CONTRAST. 1451 

devoted to me as they are, we can manage 
every thing as we please ; more especially 
as, in quitting London, no one knew 
whither we were coming." 

" No, every precaution was taken to 
prevent that," said Frances, in a slow, and, 
for her, unnatural tone of voice. 

" Then you do not object to what I 
have suggested ? How happy," without 
giving her time to answer, " am I to find 
you so composed under such a visitation ! 
what a proof of a superior mind ! Still, I 
know you must feel it severely ; and it 
irks me, therefore, in such a moment of 
sorrow, to be compelled to press worldly 
matters upon your attention ; but I am 
just at this instant so circumstanced â€” in 
short, my poor friend promised, without 
further delay, to accommodate me with 
what was sufficient to free me from im- 
mediate embarrassments, and I have now 
to call upon you to fulfil this promise." 

Ah! the serpent! â€” And did she per- 
mit him to obtain what he coveted, where 
should she then be ? And as the reflec- 
tion occurred, what reason had she for

exultation at her father's prudence, in se- 
creting the property he had brought with 
him, and laying on her a strict injunction 
of silence as to the circumstance, when 

imparting it to her ! but for that But 

she saw an answer was expected, and forced 
herself to say, that, as soon as she had a 
little collected herself, she would attend 
to what he required. 

But this did not satisfy sir Osbert ; im- 
perious circumstances rendered immediate 
compliance with his request absolutely re- 
quisite ; and he was beginning to try what 
flattery might do, when nature, overstrain- 
ed, could hold out no longer, and falling 
into violent hysterics, she was conveyed 
to her room. 

Sir Osbert could no longer doubt the 
truth ; it was but too evident to him, that 
she had witnessed the deed that had just 
been perpetrated, and, of course, that, to 
ensure his safety, it was requisite she 
should never repass the dreary walls that 
now enclosed her. He would not long 
have hesitated ridding himself immedi- 
ately of the fears she suggested, but for 
the secret in her keeping: without her 



CONTRAST. 147 

disclosing the place in which her father 
had concealed the property he was aware 
he had brought over with him, how vainly, 
he reflected, might he seek for it. This con- 
sideration, accordingly withheld him from 
any immediate act of violence ; but whe- 
ther successful or not, in his efforts to 
draw from her the desired disclosure, a 
day or two must decide her fate, for no 
longer could he tarry where he was ; and 
to leave it in the power of any one to be- 
tray him, was a folly he could not possibly 
think of being guilty of. 

The wretched Frances no sooner came 
a little to herself, than she dismissed the 
woman who had supported her to her 
chamber, in order that she might ponder 
without restraint on the dreadful predica- 
ment in which she was placed. She saw 
clearly that she had betrayed herself to sir 
Osbert â€” that her feeble efforts to dissemble 
the truth were unavailing ; and what might 
not be the dreadful result ? Yet the se- 
cret in her keeping â€” would not that ensure 
her safety ? But to what methods might 
he not have recourse, to extort it from 
H 2 



148 CONTRAST. 

her? But it was her only chance for 
safety; and no threats, she accordingly 
determined, should force it from her. 
Yet, at the thought of having this resolve 
put to the test, she shrunk in dismay; 
every sound that now reached her ear 
threw her into terror, dreading as she 
did, that it was sir Osbert approaching to 
press his request ; and equally apprehen- 
sive of the result of either complying with, 
or resisting it, she knelt to implore pro- 
tection ; but the prayer that was issuing 
from her pale and quivering lips, was ar- 
rested by the reflections that crowded 
upon her tortured soul. How, with any 
confidence, could she look up to Him, she 
reflected, in this hour of dismay and ter- 
ror, to whom her heart had never ascend- 
ed in gratitude, when joy and gladness 
encompassed her ! â€” how for pity to Him 
who enjoins us to be meek and merciful, 
when she thought of her cruel exultation, 
at the success of her father's nefarious 
schemes against Helena ! 

Night came on, without any one com- 
ing to administer consolation to her dis- 
tress; but sir Osbert feared not, cared not.

now about her complaints or reproaches ; 
and it mattered not, therefore, how she 
was treated. What if the neglect she 
experienced was owing to his being still 
dubious how he should decide about her? 
As the thought occurred, the blood curdled 
at her heart, and the cold dew of terror 
burst from every pore. 

To add to her anguish, the happy se- 
curity she might now have been enjoying, 
but for the perfidy practised against her 
who was now so amply avenged, was 
continually recurring to her thoughts; so 
that nothing was wanting to render her 
as miserable as she deserved to be.

" Girt with a chain he cannot wish to brealc â€” 
His only bliss is sorrow for her sake." 

By the time lady Rossglen returned from 
her tour, there was a dreadful story in 
circulation respecting sir Osbert ; it was 



150 CONTRAST. 

every where reported he had taken the 
life of Bridgemore, and that, in endea- 
vouring to effect his escape, on finding his 
guilt detected, he had perished on board a 
ship that took fire at sea. 

Lady Rossglen and Mountflorence were 
now more anxious than ever to learn 
where Helena was, in order to ascertain 
whether the death of Brid^cemore was 
likely to occasion any additional embar- 
rassment to her. Their efforts for the 
purpose led to the discovery of Mr, True- 
man being her agent ; and both, in conse- 
quence, waited on him, in the hope of 
obtaining from him the information they 
sought. He expressed great regret at 
being precluded, by his promise to Helena, 
from immediately obliging them with this; 
but assured them he would lose no time 
in writing to acquaint her with their visit. 
Lady Rossglen thanked him for the pro- 
mise ; and, encouraged by his frank and 
benevolent manner, proceeded to detail 
the regret and unhappiness which the 
estrangement that had taken place be- 
tween her and Miss Rossglen, she knew 



CONTRAST. 151 

not through what cause, had occasioned. 

" If he credited his fair client," Mr. 
Trueman said, " the unhappiness occa- 
sioned by the circumstance was not en- 
tirely at one side; but the letter which 
she had the honour of addressing to her 
ladyship, just prior to her quitting town, 
must better explain her sentiments re- 
specting it, than any thing he could say," 
he added. 

" Letter !" lady Rossglen repeated, with 
a look of surprise ; " if such a one had been 
written, it had never been sent." 

" Pardon me," said Mr. Trueman ; " it 
was sent by a servant of mine, I never yet 
detected in a falsehood, and by him deli- 
vered into the hands of the countess An- 
struther's porter." 

" Then, I do assure you, from them it 
never passed into mine," said lady Ross- 
glen ; " but if you will favour me with 
the exact date, I shall not rest until I as- 
certain its fate." 

" It is to be hoped," said Mr. Trueman, 
as he was obliging her with this, " that 
Miss Rossglen will no longer persist in 



152 CONTRAST. 

secluding herself from the world, now that 
the restitution of the property she was so 
cruelly deprived of, renders any thing of 
the kind longer unnecessary." 

The word restitution was repeated by 
both his visitors, in an accent of extreme 
surprise. 

Mr. Trueman looked earnestly at them ; 
" Am I to understand," he asked, " from 
the surprise I appear to have excited, that 
you have all this time been in ignorance 
of what Miss Rossglen suffered through 
misplaced confidence, as well as still unac- 
quainted w^ith the full particulars of what 
has lately occurred ?" 

The ansvv-er was in the affirmative ; and 
in consequence, he forthwith proceeded to 
give the requisite and anxiously-desired 
explanation on both subjects. Having 
detailed all that Helena suffered, through 
the villany of Bridgemore, and given the 
particulars of sir Osbert's conduct, he pro- 
ceeded to inform his anxiously-interested 
auditors, that Miss Bridgemore, rendered 
desperate by the horrors of her situation,, 
had ventured to make her escape through 
a window of her chamber. The night was 



CONTRAST. 153 

dark, and in groping her way along the 
cliffs, her foot slipping, she plunged 
through a chasm, where, mangled and 
mutilated, she remained till morning, when 
her moans attracted two fishermen to the 
spot. Convinced she was dying, she 
hardly found herself in the hovel to which 
they conveyed her, ere she required a cler- 
gyman to be sent for ; to him, on his ar- 
rival, she opened her tortured heart ; and 
having deposed to the death of her father 
by sir Osbert, and acknowledged, with 
deep remorse, the wrongs sustained by 
Miss Rossglen, desired I might imme- 
diately be written to, to come over for the 
purpose of taking possession, as the agent 
of that young lady, of the property of 
which she had been so cruelly despoiled. 
I lost no time, you may suppose," conti- 
nued Mr. Trueman, " in obeying this 
summons ; but ere I reached Ireland, Miss 
Bridgemore was no more : every thing, 
however, having been done requisite for 
making restitution, I found no difficulty 
in obtaining the property mentioned by 
her. Immediately after her deposition, 
H 3 



154 CONTRAST* 

measures were had recourse to for the ap* 
prehension of sir Osbert, and which, no 
doubt, would have proved successful, but 
for the easily-excited alarm of guilt ; igno- 
rant as he was of the escape of Miss 
Bridgemore, through the person in whose 
custody she had been left being afraid to 
acquaint him with the circumstance. My 
fair client was very much shocked by 
what had happened ; but this is not to be 
wondered at, when it is considered, ex- 
clusive of the feelings for which I am cer- 
tain she is distinguished, the light in which 
she long regarded one party, and how 
very near she was being drawn in to iden- 
tify her fate with that of the other. But 
all will soon be well again: restored to 
her friends, their soothing attentions will, 
I make no doubt, gradually succeed in 
effacing unpleasant impressions from her 
mind, and enabling her again to enjoy life 
in the manner she ought." 

What the feelings of Mountflorence 
and his mother were, while listening to 
Mr. Trueman, may easily be imagined â€” 
their indignation at the wrongs sustained 
by Helena, and their deep regret at being 



CONTRAST. 155 

-SO long kept in ignorance of them : but 
an explanation was about taking place be- 
tween them ; and it w^ould prove to her, 
that to whatever cause was owin^ the ces- 
sation of their intercourse, it certainly was 
not to any diminution of their interest for 
her. But in the interim, how cruel the 
opinion she must have formed, from the 
seeming neglect the letter mentioned by 
Mr. Trueman had experienced! What 
had become of this ? and as the thought 
occurred, suspicions suggested themselves, 
that rendered them truly unhappy, by in- 
ducing a fear that lady Anstruther had 
been instrumental in effecting the estrange- 
ment, which the artifices of the Bridge- 
mores had laid the foundation for: each 
knew, though without being exactly aware 
of the cause of it, the strong pique she had 
conceived against Helena, as well as her 
views respecting lady Bellair ; and they 
much feared, in consequence, that she had 
suffered herself to be tempted to aid the 
base contrivances of others. They ^vere 
again inmates at Cavendish-square; lady 
Anstruther not wishing to make any pub- 
lic demonstration of the resentment ex- 



156 CONTRAST. 

cited by what she denominated the folly 
of lady Rossglen; and immediately on 
their return there, from Mr. Trueman's, 
proceeded to make inquiries, the result of 
which at length proved that the suspicions 
that painfully agitated them were not 
unfounded. Evasions nor prevarications 
could succeed with Mountflorence ; and 
the countess, finding the effort or attempt 
useless, at length, with affected careless- 
ness, acknowledged, as if through the ef- 
fect of sudden recollection, having had 
delivered to her both the letter alluded to 
by Mr. Trueman, and the one which He- 
lena previously addressed to him, and both 
of which, through her not looking at the 
superscription, ere she attempted to touch 
the seals, she had unfortunately opened. 
" Of course, I fully intended," she added, 
" to have given them ; but I don't know 
how it was, they escaped my memory; 
however, here they now are," she said, 
taking them from her desk, and shuffling 
them into the hands of the respective par- 
ties as she spoke; "you'll not be very angry 
with me for their detention, for you'll find 
ihem of no great consequence." 



CONTRAST. 157 

Of no great consequence ! what an as- 
sertion, containing, as they did, a full ex- 
planation of all that they had been anxious 
to understand â€” the feelings, the senti- 
ments of Helena, and, of course, to what, 
in reality, was owing all that had recently 
pained and offended. With difficulty in- 
deed could Mountflorence restrain his 
feelings, when he reflected on the light in 
which he must appear to Helena, after 
addressing him such a letter, without any 
attention being paid to it. When he con- 
sidered too the misery that had been caus- 
ed her â€” the irremediable mischief that 
might have been occasioned by the estrange- 
ment that had been effected between her 
and her connexions; for had the inter- 
course with her family continued uninter- 
rupted, she assuredly would not have been 
so much at the mercy of the artful and 
unprincipled as was the case; and as this 
reflection also occurred to lady Rossglen, 
it required no little extension of the Chris- 
tian spirit of benevolence to induce her to 
forgive the conduct of lady Anstruther. 
But Helena had, happily, escaped with- 
out any injury to her fortune, and it was 



158 CONTRAST. 

equally hoped, to her peace, from what 
had happened; and, in joy and gratitude 
at this, she strove, as did Mountflorence, 
to think no more of what had excited such 
keen resentment in their minds. 

While anxiously waiting to hear from 
Mr. Trueman, she received a very unex- 
pected letter from lord Selwyn's father, 
purporting, that through the esteem and 
admiration excited by her honourable con- 
duct, throughout the whole affair between 
lord Selwyn and her daughter, he could 
no longer think of opposing obstacles to 
an attachment that did honour to the dis- 
cernment of his son ; and that, accordingly, 
he only waited her permission to pay his 
respects in person, and have matters ar- 
ranged for the wished-for alliance. 

This permission, as may be supposed, 
was not long withheld ; and finally, it was 
settled, that lord Selwyn should accom- 
pany lady Rossglen on her return to Ire- 
land, and be followed there by the earl, 
his father, to witness the solemnization of 
his marriage. 

Lady Anstruther could not but be 
pleased at what had occurred; still her 



CONTRAST. 159 

pleasure was not what it would have been, 
had the event been brought about entirely 
through her means, from the influence she 
conceived such a circumstance must have 
acquired her with the young couple. 
However, the bride once from under the 
control of mamma, and she deemed it not 
unlikely, from rather mistaking her cha- 
racter, obtaining such an ascendancy over 
her as she wished. 

But the happiness of the fond mother, 
at the smiling prospects of one daughter, 
could not divert her attention from the 
other. She was not suffered, however, to 
remain much longer in uneasiness on her 
dear Dorinda's account; lord Glena had 
lingered in London, and through this, 
was put in possession of particulars that 
allowed but very little delay, after her 
return from her tour, in seeking an inter- 
view with her ladyship, for the purpose of 
soliciting her permission to become a can- 
didate for the fair hand of her Dorinda. 

On many accounts her ladyship was 
now most anxious to find herself again at 
Woodston ; but till she had succeeded in 
learning where Helena was to be sought-, 



160 CONTRAST. 

she could not think of departing. In her 
impatience â€” her anxiety to ascertain this, 
Mountflorence did not attempt to deny his 
participating, or rather, to conceal the feel- 
ings that rendered him so interested on the 
subject ; but he no longer sought to suppress 
the sentiments inspired by Helena. In 
the candour with which she had acknow- 
ledged her errors, had revealed her heart 
to his view, he found an excuse for every 
thing that had hurt him ; and in yielding 
at length to his impassioned feelings for 
her, he experienced a degree of impatience 
to find himself at her feet. 

Lady Rossglen knew not what to say 
on the subject of his attachment : her re- 
gard for Helena was truly maternal, and 
fortune no longer offered any impediment 
to their union ; still, without a certainty 
of these too ardent, too easily excited feel- 
ings, that had been the cause of so much 
suffering to her, being under better con- 
trol than heretofore, how could she allow 
herself to sanction what, in the event of 
this not being the case, might ultimately 
occasion unhappiness to her dear Sigis- 
^und ? yet, from cold, calculating caution 



CONTRAST. 161 

to oppose his union with sir Maurice's be- 
loved child, how could she do so, and not 
have to accuse herself of treachery and in- 
gratitude to the departed? finally, she de- 
cided on not merel}'- acquiescing in the 
wishes of Mountflorence, but seconding 
them with all her eloquence, should the 
exertion of this be required ; and there 
was no knowing, from the quick and sen- 
sitive feehngs of Helena, what effect the 
supposed slight shewn to her letter might 
have produced upon her : true, this could 
now be satisfactorily accounted for, but 
still it might have created an impression 
not easy to overcome. 

At length Mr. Trueman, having received 
an answer to the letter addressed to Helena, 
called with her affectionate regards to her 
ladyship, and full permission to disclose 
to her the name of her residence in Wales, 
the same, as it proved, that Adelaide had 
occupied with Mrs. Westford, on whose 
vacating it, being again to be let, by a 
friend of Mr. Trueman's, he had engaged 
it for Helena. 

This information obtained, there was 
pothing further to delay the departure of 



162 CONTRAST. 

the Woodston family ; and they according- 
ly forthwith took leave of the metropolis, 
accompanied by lords Glena and Selwyn. 
The season was a delightful one for an 
extended journey, and nothing could be 
more agreeable than the present one, with 
the feelings of the party so much in uni- 
son as they were. 

Even though Helena had not been so 
much struck with her romantic residence 
as it appeared she was, still she would have 
fixed on it, on learning that it had been 
the occasional one of Adelaide ; for there 
is a secret charm to the heart, in a place 
that recalls the idea of those it regards. 
Here her thoughts were often diverted 
from herself, by reflecting on what others 
had experienced here : here she lingered 
on the spot, where sorrow rested from its 
troubles : here often thought o'er all that 
Adelaide had suffered, and the at-length 
happy termination of her trials. Ah, how 
different from her fate ! Yet fortune was 
restored. â€” But what had its restoration 
effected ! Had it brought back the friend- 
ship she sighed for? â€” the regard she la- 
mented? Was she not still as before. 



CONTRAST. 163 

the same lonely isolated being? And 
tears would fall to the menaory of other 
and happier days, when she had some one 
to participate in what she felt. Yet she 
now desired to be alone ; feelings not to 
be surmised urged her to wish for lasting 
solitude; even in her walks she sought it; 
she liked only to stray where she was cer- 
tain of being unnoticed â€” amidst the dus- 
kiness of tangled woods and wilds, where 
scarce a sunbeam wandered through the 
gloom. But while she delighted in this, 
an effect was often produced upon her mind 
by the circumstance, that drove her back 
with the trepidation of fear, where she could 
again catch the hum of human voices, as 
if through an apprehension of being the 
pursuit of some secret enemy. Yet no ! 
this would have been an idle one, for she 
had no enemy now : those who had prac- 
tised deceit against her, could no more 
practise against her peace ; but the convic- 
tion of this was not sufficient, whenever 
they recurred to her thoughts, to prevent 
a shuddering sensation. 

The letter of Mr. Trueman, announ- 
cing the visit he had received on her acÂ« 



164 CONTRAST. 

count, excited, as may be supposed, no 
little emotion : believing lady Rossglen 
had entirely renounced her, how much 
was she affected to find herself mistaken ! 
how greatly, that where she had most 
loved, she had at least met with iidelity ! 
but the consolation imparted by the reflec- 
tion was imperfect â€” to have rendered her 
capable of a lasting sensation of gladness, 
certain recollections must have been ob- 
literated ; and who can efface the hidden 
troubles of the brain ? 

When she thought of what she was en- 
during â€” how impossible it was for her to 
conceal the sadness, the anguish that was 
preying on her life's core, she almost decided 
on declining the renewal of any intercourse 
with lady Rossglen. But how could she 
subject herself to the imputations she 
must incur by doing so? â€” how to the 
odium of a cold unyielding nature? â€” or 
how deny to herself the soothing pleasure 
of once more weeping on a breast throb-, 
bing with interest for her ? â€” or the trans- 
port of clasping to her heart those dear 
girls, so precious to it? and the permis- 
sion desired by Mr. Trueman was accord-* 



CONTRAST. 165 

ingly at length given. But from the mo- 
ment lady Rossglen was expected, she in 
vain sought to compose her agitated nerves ; 
for what questions might not be asked â€” 
what conjectures formed ? And then 
Mountflorence ! But if he did accompany 
the party, she might be sure, after what 
had occurred, that it was out of compli- 
ment to them, not on her account; and 
she hoped she should be able to maintain 
a sufficient command over herself, to prove 
to him her conviction of this. 

On a delicious evening, in the glowing 
month of June, the party arrived in her 
vicinity : the hearts of those so deeply in- 
terested about her flew forward at the mo- 
ment, as it were, to her. But lady Ross- 
glen, who knew her feelings, thought it 
advisable she should first see her alone : 
this, however, did not prevent her being 
attended by the party. â€” " And what 
a sweet retreat had their dear Helena 
chosen for herself I" was the observation of 
the girls, as they proceeded along the 
quiet road leading to it, winding round 
the feet of romantic mountains, and over- 
looking little grassy vales, where the cattle 



166 CONTRAST. 

were now softly lowing in the evening 
sunshine ; " and were her feelings in uni- 
son with the peace and tranquillity of 
the scene, how delicious must they be !" 
But, alas ! that was not the case, as we 
have already seen ; the feelings of the se- 
verely-tried Helena were but little in sym- 
pathy with external objects ; yet, at times, 
the tranquillity that pervaded all around 
her, shed repose upon her wounded spirit. 
Uncertain of the exact time when she 
might expect to see lady Rossglen, she 
was loitering at her solitary tea-table, when 
a kind of slight bustle in the hall rousing 
her from the deep abstraction in which 
she was lost at the moment, she started 
up with an agitating presentiment, and 
hastily opening the door, found herself in 
the arms of her ladyship. To describe 
what she felt at the moment would be im- 
possible ; for some minutes after, she was 
utterly unable to speak or move : at length, 
making an effort to collect herself, she 
raised her head from the shoulder of lady 
Rossglen ; but when she saw her, earnestly 
regarding her, with a mixture of pity and 
regret, as it seemed to her, emotion re- 



CONTRAST. 167 

vived> and completely overcome, by feel- 
ings too poignant for suppression, she 
burst into tears, and dropping upon a seat, 
in convulsive agitation, tried to hide her 
face with her hands. 

Lady Rossglen, with soothing eloquence, 
tried to bring her back to composure. 
Having succeeded, in a degree, in calming, 
her agitations, she proceeded to give those 
explanations, that were requisite to con- 
vince her of the unaltered regard of her 
and hers, and, of course, the deep regret 
experienced by both, at the cruel estrange- 
ment effected between them. 

Helena listened with profound atten- 
tion, and without once attempting to in- 
terrupt her; but when she had ceased 
speaking â€” " Why, why," in a tone of the 
bitterest anguish, she exclaimed, " why 
did I permit myself to doubt the sincerity 
you have proved ? Acquainted with you, 
as I had become â€” witnessing every day, as 
I did, some act of virtue and benevolence, 
but hurried away by resentment, at the 
bare supposition of having been deceived 
in your regard for me, I lost sight en- 
tirely of judgment and reflection: yet 



168 CONTRAST. 

all might have been well again, but for 
the cruel suppression of the letter ! but 
confirmed, by its supposed neglect, in my 
persuasion of being renounced by you, 
that persuasion decided my fate, and 
doomed me â€” oh, good God !" she cried, 
her hands clasped â€” her eyes despairingly 
cast up to Heaven, " to what of suffering 
in this life !" 

" No, no, my dear girl, that I cannot, 
will not, believe !" said lady Rossglen : 
" your spirits are still deeply depressed, 
and you therefore imagine this, the mind, 
when labouring under any gloomy im- 
pression, being generally ready to sub- 
scribe to the belief of such being perma- 
nent : but time proves the fallacy of the 
idea ; few are the wounds over which its 
healing power has not influence. I am 
not come to leave you behind me; and 
my dear Helena again in her natural home, 
surrounded by those who take so lively an 
interest in her welfare, will, ere long, I 
trust, find herself restored to all her native 
cheerfulness and serenity of mind." 

Helena mournfully shook her head. â€” 
" No, no !" she murmured. 



CONTRAST. 169 

" Well, well, we shall see," rejoined 
lady Rossglen : " but I have told you 
who, as well as the girls, is impatiently 
waiting without to be admitted. In 
making knov/n to you the detention of 
your letter to me, I also mentioned the 
detention of the one addressed to Sigis- 
mund ; but without entering into any ex- 
planation of the feelings excited in his 
tnind by the circumstance â€” leaving it to 
himself to explain these, as I told him I 
would : you may judge therefore what his 
impatience is to be admitted, from the 
anxiety you must suppose he feels, to 
vindicate himself from all unworthiness, 
in the opinion of her to whom he looks 
up as the arbitress of his future fate." 

" Oh no, no !" again exclaimed Helena, 
and shrinking back, as if from a recoiling 
sensation; " his fate rests not with me. 
Hear me," she cried, " quietly â€” patiently !" 
seeing lady Rossglen was about interrupt- 
ing her, and laying her hand upon her 
arm, to enforce her request, " nor in lis- 
tening, accuse me of being under the in- 
fluence of irritation or resentment. What 

VOL. III. I 



170 CONTRAST. 

my sentiments for major Mountflorence are, 
is known ; but this does not prevent my 
declaring, that in no other light than that 
of a friend, can I now ever more regard 
him. I feel, I know, that he can make a 
happier choice than I could ever prove to 
him; and with this conviction on my 
mind, what can induce me to become 
his ? But this is not my only reason for 
the determination I have avowed ; other 
considerations have also influenced me to 
it â€” circumstances have occurred, events 
taken place, that have had the terrible effect 
of unhinging ray mind, of giving a distrac- 
tion to my thoughts, that renders me totally 
unfit to enter upon new duties. If ever I 
hope to recover myself, it can only be in the 
course of time, and by trying to keep myself 
from any additional cause for agitation : 
if, therefore, you wish me to be with you, 
as I am sure is the case, or you would not 
have declared so, you must first promise, ere 
I consent to accompany you hence, that you 
will not suffer any subject to be pressed 
upon me, that you know I would wish to 
shun. You have told me to what the si- 
lence to my letter to major Mountflorence, 



CONTRAST. 171 

as well as the one addressed to you, was 
owing : my perhaps wounded pride satis- 
fied by the communication, I will hearken 
to no further explanation connected with 
the subject. Prudence enjoins my re- 
maining here ; but I yearn to find myself 
again an inmate of the home endeared by 
so many tender recollections. Still, with- 
out the assurance I require, nothing shall 
induce me to leave this, even though sure 
my heart must break at seeing you depart 
without me." 

" Then receive it now," said lady Ross- 
glen, tenderly embracing her ; "as far as my 
influence goes, nothing shall be intruded 
on your attention that can possibly agitate. 
I may â€” I must regret, being compelled 
to give such a promise; still I can well 
understand the feelings that have urged 
you to require it â€” the effect that the trou- 
bles and perplexities in which you have 
lately been involved, have had upon your 
mind: butquiet and soothingattentions will 
do much ; and ere long, I will trust, I shall 
again see my dear Helena what she was." 

She now inquired whether the girls 
I 2 



172 CONTRAST. 

might not be admitted ? Helena faintly 
replied in the affirmative, with an obser- 
vation on the unkindness they might ac- 
cuse her of, for not hastening the meeting 
â€” " But I wishedâ€” T wished," she cried, 
with increasing emotion, " ere a meeting 
took place with any one but you, to come 
to an understanding on one subject." 

I-iady Rossglen leaving her, sent in the 
girls, and taking Mountflorence by the 
arm, drew him away from his companions. 
She then proceeded to detail the con- 
versation that had passed between her 
and Helena, and the promise extorted. 
Mountflorence was all dismay: was he 
doomed then to find his hopes of hap- 
piness visionary? those delicious hopes, 
in which he had recently indulged? But 
there must be another cause for what He- 
lena had required, than she had acknow- 
ledged : spite of her protestations against 
being under the influence of resentment, 
he could not persuade himself that what 
she had urged was not ascribable, at least 
in a degree, to a feeling of the kind; 
which, considering the explanations that 
had taken place, and the reason she had 



CONTRAST. 173 

given him for reproach, in their last in- 
terview, he could not avoid thinking her 
unreasonable for indulging. 

Lady Rossglen did not deny that there 
might be some justice in his conjecture; 
still she was firmly of opinion, that He- 
lena was, in some degree, in that state of 
mind she had so emphatically described : 
nor was this to be wondered at, when it 
was considered the shock she must have 
sustained, at the sudden, though, as it 
happily proved, transient reverse that had 
taken place in her condition ; her advice, 
therefore, was, that no complaint or re- 
proach should escape him, but that he 
should quietly wait, to see the effect of 
time, when, if Helena still persisted in 
the resolve she had avowed, both reason 
and pride must of course induce him to 
relinquish her. 

Having argued him into some compo- 
sure, she returned to Helena, to know 
whether she might introduce him and his 
companions ? Helena made no objection, 
and they were accordingly admitted. At 
another moment, and Helena would pro- 
bably have felt disconcerted at seeing lord 



174 CONTRAST. 

Glena; but in emotion at the idea of be- 
holding Mountflorence, all thought of him 
was lost. Mechanically she replied to his 
compliments, and lord Selwyn's ; but when 
Mountflorence approached, how did her 
colour vary, and what a proof would the 
circumstance have been to the half-offend- 
ed lover, had he allowed himself to stea- 
dily regard her at the instant, that to 
whatever cause was owing what had so 
wounded his feelings, it was not, at least, 
to indifference ! His air was involuntarily 
cold and constrained; Helena could not 
but divine the reason, and pained by the 
idea of having pained him, involuntarily 
extended her hand, with a look of even 
deprecating sweetness. 

The effect was resistless; icy reserve 
vanished in an instant, and pressing to his 
heart the fair hand thus extended, he cast 
a glance round him, that plainly intimated, 
he only wanted to see that he could have 
done so unobserved, to have knelt to her. 

But the transport thus excited was but 
transient; Helena, as if recalled to recol- 
lection by noticing it, suddenly forced 
away her hand, and retreated to a distant 



CONTRAST. 175 

seat The eyes of lady Rossglen were 
upon her ; but in ail this she saw no room 
for absolute despair to Mountflorence : in- 
diflPerence is cold and consistent ; but the 
manner of Helena evidently denoted a 
struggle indicative of any thing but that. 
The conversation now became general ; 
but to those who narrowly observed her, 
it was evident that it was not without an 
effort Helena sustained a part in it, and 
that the exertions she deemed herself ob- 
liged to make on account of her guests, 
were indeed most painful : her sudden ab- 
stractions, the even anguished look that 
she from time cast round her, as if uncon- 
sciously, proved this, and that 

" Ever and anon, of griefs subdued 

There came a token, like a scorpion's sting :" 

and lady Rossglen, from all this, saw the 
absolute necessity of quickly bearing her 
away from the place that had, as she be- 
lieved, nourished this melancholy. 

Then why, feeling it to have such an 
effect upon her, did she remain in it? was 
a question natural to be asked ; but lady 
Rossglen, from her knowledge of her dis- 
position, was not at all surprised at the 



176 CONTRAST. 

circumstance, conceiving nothing more 
natural than that deceit and ingratitude, 
united to supposed unkindness, should 
have the effect, on an ardent and sensitive 
nature like hers, of producing a transient 
distaste or dislike to what is called the 
world : but be that as it might, she clearly 
perceived that the melancholy with which 
her mind was now imbued, was of that 
deep and dangerous character, that soon 
sets at nought the suggestions of reason, 
and which her friends were accordingly 
bound to make every effort to aid, or in- 
duce her to overcome. 

As a proof of its gloomy, and therefore 
dangerous character, was her dress of deep 
mourning. â€” " My dear child," she said to 
her, as they chatted a little apart after tea, 
" what can have occasioned the assump- 
tion of these gloomy weeds ?" 

Helena turned of a deathlike paleness. 
â€” " Weeds did you say ?" she repeated, 
with something of wildness in her look. 

" Yes, my love â€” this dismal dress, for 
I know you have lost no connexion to as- 
sume the garb of sorrow for." 

" I don't know," but evidently con- 



CONTRAST. 177 

fused, " except that, being melancholy, I 
fancied the dress would better suit my 
feelings than any other." 

" This must no longer be," said lady 
Rossglen ; " I shall expect to see it thrown 
aside to-morrow, and with it, every thing 
that savours of gloom and melancholy â€” in 
short, my sweet Helena changed in every 
respect, but that affectionate heart, that 
has rendered her a creature of such inte- 
rest. How," she added, fondly kissing her 
pale cheek â€” " how could she be so unjust 
to herself, as to imagine that those who 
had once loved her, could ever cease to do 
so?" 

Helena sighed deeply, and stole, invo- 
luntarily, a glance at Mountflorence, as he 
sat opposite, intently regarding her. Ah ! 
had she not been told that such a thing 
was possible? The glance was not lost 
upon Mountflorence; he fancied he read 
reproach in it, and the thought struck him 
to the soul. Had he then so committed 
himself with her, that there was no hope 
for him ? had their last conversation left 
then such a rankling impression behind ? 
i3 



178 CONTRAST. 

Yet, was not the letter that followed 
a refutation of this apprehension? But 
no; written under a hasty impulse, she 
had not then given herself time to dwell 
on it, as solitude afterwards allowed her 
to do : yet, had she not given cause for 
the reproaches he had uttered? But what 
mattered the idea of this to him, if she 
thought the reverse? But he would not 
long remain in suspense relative to her 
sentiments, and if she decided against him, 
a long adieu then to the scenes in which 
he had fondly hoped for felicity. 

The party were all accommodated in 
the castle, and the next day was spent in 
rambling about its romantic environs. 
The name of Adelaide, connected with 
the place, more than once occurred in the 
course of these rambles, and never without 
occasioning a painful sensation to Helena, 
such was the shame and remorse with 
which she reviewed her conduct to her ; 
so great indeed, that, probably, but for 
the assurance of lady Rossglen, of her nei- 
ther being then in Ireland, nor, to her 
knowledge, immediately expected, she 
would have declined positively accompa- 



CONTRAST. 179 

nying her, rather than run the risk of 
meeting a person she had so much reason 
to wish to avoid. 

And had she then, she more than once 
demanded of herself, allowed her deter- 
mination to remain in retirement to be 
overruled, aware, as she was, of all that 
quitting it was likely to expose her to 
â€” the struggles, the agitation, the im- 
putation of coldness and caprice, or else 
of mystery ? But how could she resist the 
pleadings, urged for the purpose of indu- 
cing its abandonment, yearning, as she 
had said her heart did, to find herself 
again a link in the domestic chain ? how 
could she bring herself to remain behind ? 
and finally, she made no attempt to draw 
back from the indirect promise she had 
given lady Rossglen, to return with her to 
Woodston.

Back on the heart, the weight which it would fling

Lady Rossglen would not allow of a long 
pause in her journey; the day but one 
after her arrival at the castle, it was re- 
sumed. The nearer Helena drew towards 
its termination, the less availing were her 
efforts to subdue or conceal the agitation 
she was evidently under from its com- 
mencement. Arrived at Woodston, there 
was a renewal of grief on all sides ; but 
the emotion evinced by lady Rossglen 
was slight, compared with that expe- 
rienced by Helena : she had lost, it was 
true, a dear companion ; but not, as the 
sorrowing Helena reflected, the only being 
who could or would have interposed be- 
tween her and evil; and, at the thought 



CONTRAST. 181 

of all she had suffered â€” was probably 
doomed to suffer, through the death of her 
father, the want of his watchful care, his 
zealous counsel â€” her anguish became over- 
whelming ; and, stealing away, she sought 
refuge in the wood from observation. 
She took, unconsciously perhaps, the di- 
rection to the hut at the lake, that fa- 
vourite haunt, endeared by the many 
recollections associated with it : what feel- 
ings did the sight of it awaken ! she 
threw herself upon a seat, and wept, in 
bitterness of soul, at the images it recalled 
â€” the reflections it excited. Here it was 
that she had first conceived the delicious 
idea of being an object of interest to him, 
for whom, while it was her determination 
to renounce him, her heart was still throb- 
bing with the most impassioned tender- 
ness â€” here it was that she had first awaken- 
ed to a sense of all the misery that must at- 
tend the completion of that rash, that 
quickly-repented engagement, that had 
given the colouring of misery to all her fu- 
ture days â€” here it was, that pondering over 
the conduct of Mountflorence, she had ex- 
perienced all those agitating alternations of 



182 CONTRAST. 

hope and fear â€” those variations of feeling, 
she should no more know, for she had no- 
thing more to fear, neither to hope : her 
fate was decided, and a joyless isolated 
state of existence was her lot. Just about 
this period the preceding year, she had ar- 
rived with her father at Woodston, with 
hopes glowing as the delicious season that 
had again spread fertility and beauty 
around; how blighted those hopes â€” how 
reversed her prospects, since then ! Oh 
that this year could be expunged from 
her existence ! or that she could allow her- 
self to consider what had occurred in the 
course of it but as a hideous dream! â€” 
but no, no! its events were written in 
characters indelible, with a pen of burning 
iron, with traces of anguish too deep for 
obliteration, on her soul. 

She rose, she looked abroad â€” the even- 
ing sunshine was gilding every object, ac- 
companied by that soothing tranquillity 
that is the inseparable attendant on the de- 
clining day in the country : the cattle were 
softly lowing on the distant hills â€” the vil- 
lage murmur came softened by distance to 
the listening ear, mingled with the tinkle of 



CONTRAST. 18^ 

the sheep-bell â€” while, amidst the warbling 
of the birds, still rejoicing in the gladsome 
ray, ever and anon was heard the monoton- 
ous heaving of the waves below â€” and all, in 
short, seemed cheerfulness and joy, but in 
her own sad heart. She advanced to a 
bank overlooking the bay â€” how beautiful 
in its summer calmness ! she saw the cave, 
whence, at the hazard of his life, Mount- 
florence had borne her. Ah! mistaken 
kindness ! yet was she prepared to be hur- 
ried into eternity ? and she shuddered at 
the thought. Her eyes rested on the now 
vividly-tinted headland, where the last 
day of her father's existence had been 
passed â€” she glanced from it towards the 
opposite one, the dire scene of sir Osbert's 
atrocities, and involuntarily recoiled, as if 
images of horror had been conjured up to 
view by its sight. And there were â€” but 
whither should she fly, that such would 
not haunt her ? where could she turn, that 
such would not meet her? and she was 
despairingly casting her eyes upwards, 
when they encountered Mountflorence. 
An even appalling shriek escaped her, as if 
he had been reading her soul all this time ; 



184 CONTRAST. 

and veiling her face with one hand, she 
waved him away with the other; but 
Mountflorence, instead of obeying, gently 
seized the hand that motioned him to 
leave her; and, in a voice of tender re- 
proach â€” " How cruel,'* he cried " this con- 
duct ! to fly from â€” to separate yourself 
from those who take such an interest in 
your feelings ! Oh ! if you but knew the 
joy that is experienced at finding you here 
again, you must surely participate in it !" 
and he pressed the white hand that was 
faintly struggling to release itself from his 
grasp to his heart; and he looked at her 
with all the passionate fondness that was 
now pervading his feelings for her. 

Helena blushed and trembled, and seem- 
ed ready to sink under her emotions, when, 
happily, she saw Dorinda hastening to 
her relief â€” relief it might well be called, 
shrinking as she did from the idea of giv- 
ing pain to the generous heart glowing 
with such tenderness for her, and dreading 
accordingly any declaration that must 
compel this. Taking the arm of Dorinda, 
she turned with her towards the house. 



CONTRAST. 185 

slowly followed by the agitated Mountflo- 
rence. 

He could not but remember there was 
a time in which she would not have shrunk 
from the avowal of his love, as it was now 
too evident to him she did : the very 
shades he was passing through recalled the 
recollection of a scene that had convinced 
him of this. It was here, amidst these 
identical ones, that she assuredly had al- 
lowed him to understand he would not be 
an unsuccessful suitor for her favour; and 
that he, disdaining to take what might 
have been considered an advantage of her 
generous nature, had imposed upon her 
ear the tale of a fabricated passion for ano- 
ther: but, to whatever cause was owing 
her present conduct, her emotion did not 
argue its being the result of indifference ; 
and while he could believe there was still 
an interest cherished in her bosom for 
him, he would not resign himself to de- 
spair. 

Helena found the scene within doors 
changed ; the drawing-room was filled with 
visitors, and lady Rossglen, in the neces- 
sity for exertion, had recovered at least 



186 CONTRAST. 

the semblance of composure and cheerful* 
ness, while Caroline was laughing and 
amusing herself, with her usual vivacity. 
Helena could not refrain a sigh â€” " But the 
dead must be forgotten," she said to her- 
self; " new ties, new connexions, reconcile 
the heart to the loss it has mourned. Yet, 
though every day we see this the case, 
how fondly do we each persuade ourselves 
that we shall prove an exception to what 
is so general, and live for ever in the me- 
mory of those we love !" 

Amongst those she now beheld, was 
Mrs. Wetherall and her daughter, returned 
to enjoy the delights of Ballyshandra, or 
the delights of any other place they might 
like better, without any opposition from 
the colonel. On the contrary, he had 
given them very early to understand that 
he could very well dispense with the plea- 
sure of having them to drag about with 
him, in his various change of quarters; 
and no other person, much as they were 
admired and their company covetted, by 
every one that knew them, giving them an 
invitation to remain, they were fain to re- 
turn home just as they went, to the no 



CONTRAST. 187 

small chagrin and disappointment of 
both, though they strove to put the best 
face upon the matter, by protesting it was 
entirely through their own choice. 

Mrs. Wetherall no sooner heard of the 
intended return of lady Rossglen to Wood- 
ston, than she proceeded there, of her own 
accord, under the pretext of wishing to see 
that every thing was in a proper state of 
preparation for the reception of her lady- 
ship, but in reality, the hope of receiving 
an invitation to remain, by being found 
there, which, on many accounts, she was 
very anxious for, but particularly through 
certain designs she had begun to meditate 
with respect to Mountflorence. Not know- 
ing the exact time lady Rossglen might 
be expected, she allowed herself to gad 
about as usual, and was at a party in the 
neighbourhood, when her arrival was an- 
nounced. Immediately starting up, with 
that volatility which she thought at times 
became her, she proposed the whole party 
accompanying her to Woodston, to which, 
as it savoured something of a frolic, no ob- 
jection was made. 



188 CONTRAST. 

It SO happened, that she had heard no- 
thing of Helena since seeing her in Lon- 
don, and, consequently, was ignorant both 
of the restitution of property she had met 
with, and lady Rossglen's intention of 
bringing her over with her. Nothing, 
therefore, could exceed the surprise she 
experienced, at seeing her enter the room 
with Dorinda, except the discomposure it 
occasioned, fearing, as she did, that her 
sojourn at Woodston might be the means 
of subverting some of her immediate plans. 
â€” Was ever any thing so provoking, so 
absurd, as of lady Rossglen, to invite her 
over ? With the fair pretext with which 
the breach between them had furnished 
her, for troubling herself no more about 
her, to think of seeking her outâ€”she really 
had no patience with her ; but there were 
persons that had any sense but common 
sense, and her ladyship was of the num- 
ber ; not but that she had played her cards 
pretty well, with regard to her daughters. 
" So you here ?" she said, addressing herself 
to Helena, on her approaching her, as she 
entered the room. " Well, really, finding 
you here is a pleasure I did not look for." 



CONTRAST. 189 

" Then the less it was expected, of course 
the greater it must be, ma'am ?" said Ca- 
roline, who had taken a seat by her. 

Mrs. Wetherall bridled and tossed her 
head, and said something not to be under- 
stood ; and then again directing her atten- 
tion to Helena â€” " Come over to be station- 
ary here ?" 

Helena slightly smiled, but deigned not 
a reply. 

Finding she did not answer â€” " Miss 
Rossglen," said lord Selwyn, who had at- 
tached himself to the immediate party of 
Mrs. Wetherall, through a hint from his 
fair mistress, of being likely to be amused 
hy her, '* will not acknowledge such being 
her intention, knowing, as she must, how 
idle it would be to form one, she must be 
conscious she would not be allowed to 
keep." 

" As how, pray, my lord ?" demanded 
Mrs. Wetherall. 

" Need I explain ?" replied his lordship. 
â€¢* In this land of gallantry, above all others, 
would Miss Rossglen be suffered to retain 
a resolution that must prove inimical to 
the hopes of her admirers ?" 



J90 CONTRAST. 

" Oh dear ! gallant indeed !" and she 
again tossed her head. " But I am not 
about disputing there being many com- 
petitors for Miss Rossglen, such a prize as 
she must be considered," and she rather 
slightly sneered : then, without waiting 
for an answer â€” " and so, lady Rossglen," 
speaking to her across the room, " you 
were at the Lakes ? How I envied you 
your excursion ! Could I have prevailed 
on dear Mr. Wetherall to have allowed a 
longer stay in England, I certainly should 
have followed you, being most anxious to 
see in what the beauties of these celebrated 
lakes differ from those of our enchanting 
one of Killarney, ere I publish my ac- 
count of it, as I am almost persuaded 
to do, being assured that my descriptions 
are perfectly graphical, and the traditions 
and legends with which I have embellish- 
ed it, highly interesting, particularly those 
of Kate Kearney, and O'Donoughue 
scampering away over the hills, on his 
white horse, in pursuit of the visionary 
stag ! But still the idea of appearing in 
.print is so formidable to a person of nerves 
like mine ! But, apropos, talking of le- 



CONTRAST. 191 

gends and traditions, and all those kind of 
things that excite fear, you have heard, of 
course, of all the horrors that have been 
perpetrated here during your absence? 
Who could ever have thought that a nian 
of sir Osbert's rank could have turned out 
such a character ! â€” inveigling people into 
nooks and dens, for the purpose of making 
away with them ! But, as my friend, the 
elegant tourist, says, who has compliment- 
ed me so much on the subject of Bally- 
shandra, * there is nothing in fiction more 
improbable or extravagant than is every 
day occurring in real life ;' and I am sure 
the transaction at the pirate's cave, proves 
the truth of the observation. But bless 
me, child," happening to turn her eyes on 
Helena, at this moment, or perhaps, on 
purpose to see how she bore this allusion 
to a person with whom her fate had once 
been so nearly identified, " how pale you 
have turned ! What a castle spectre you 
would make at this moment ! Really, 
looking just as you do now, were I to en- 
counter you in the dark gallery at Bally- 
shandra, I should be tempted to conceive 



192 CONTRAST. 

it was the etberealized form of the lady- 
Eva I beheld !" 

Ere the trembling, the evidently-shud- 
dering Helena, could make any reply to 
this observation, lady Rossglen, extremely 
displeased by the want of delicacy and 
feeling evinced by Mrs. Wetherall, in these 
allusions and remarks, interfered, to re- 
quest she would desist from any further 
mention of a transaction, " it was very 
unpleasant to dwell on, as it must ever be, 
indeed," she added, " on the vices and 
crimes of our fellow-mortals." 

Mrs. Wetherall was, for a moment, a- 
bashed by this rebuke : then a little re- 
covering herself, and determined not to 
allow it to be said that she gave way, or 
was checked â€” " Oh, true," she said ; " cer- 
tainly ; but still I do confess I do delight 
in^ a tale of horror â€” it gives such an ex- 
citement to the feelings. But, as I was 
going to ask your ladyship, did you hear 
of the addition recently made to the story 
of the cave ? It is said, that in the other 
old house, on the headland, there was " 

" No matter what, or whom," cried lady 
Rossglen, who, keeping her eye upon He- 



CONTRAST. 193 

lena, saw she was ready to sink under the 
emotion thus cruelly excited ; " the sub- 
ject is altogether disagreeable, and we will 
therefore dismiss it entirely, if you please." 

Mrs. Wetherall fanning herself, with 
some appearance of agitation, muttered 
something to herself. However, this was no 
place to give utterance to any unpleasant 
remark, so, forcing a smile, she tried to 
look amiable again. But her rancour 
against Helena, for the mortification she 
had met with on her account, was not so 
immediately to be subdued ; so, turning 
again, in the course of a few minutes, to 
Caroline â€” " I see," she cried, in an under 
tone, " this elder sister of yours is just the 
same affected creature she always was." 

*â€¢' What ! Helena do you mean ?" 

" To be sure : who else do you imagine 
I could mean ? â€” Not our sweet Dorinda 
surely ?" 

" I don't know ; it never particularly 
struck me that Helena was affected. Have 
you always thought her so ?" 

" Me ? Yes, always, I assure you : I 
never adulated her, as other people did ; 

VOL. III. K 



194 CONTRAST, 

and, had she taken my advice, on the sub- 
ject of her various whims and caprices, 
she never would have appeared the fan- 
tastical creature she has evinced herself." 

" Well, no matter ; she was incorrigible, 
I suppose. But have you heard of her 
good fortune ?" 

" Good fortune!" repeated Mrs. We- 
therall, starting, and changing colour. 
" Why, heavens ! you won't tell me thatâ€” 
that major Mountflorence has been silly 
enough " 

" Major Mountflorence has nothing to 
say to the affair. But as you heard so 
much of the transactions at the cave, I 
wonder you did not hear of the restitution 
made, through the confession of one of the 
parties there." 

" No, I heard nothing of it: but I 
have been so occupied with one matter or 
another ever since my return home. But 
am I to understand," and the question was 
asked with almost gasping anxiety, " that 
her property has been restored to her ?" 

" Yes, the whole of what she was de- 
frauded of, by that wretch Bridgemore." 

" Heaven and earth ! and I to remain 



CONTRAST. 195 

in ignorance of this till now ! Was ever 
any thing so provoking â€” so unlucky !" 

" As how?" demanded Caroline, ma- 
liciously enjoying the confusion and dis- 
tress she had occasioned her. 

" Oh, my dear, because my knowing 

nothing of the matter, occasioned " 

But catching herself â€” " Do you think it 
probable she is offended, by the rather 
careless way in which I am sensible I no- 
ticed her on her entrance ?" 

" I can't possibly form a conjecture on 
the subject ; but if conscious you did not 
mean any thing slighting " 

" Slighting !" eagerly interrupted Mrs. 
Wetherall. " Heavens ! to suppose such 
a thing! that I could mean any thing 
wounding to a person I so truly loved !" 

" Spite of her various whims and ca- 
prices ?" cried Caroline, a little archly. 

" Oh, my dear," but not without an ap- 
pearance of much confusion, " I always 
considered them in a proper light, merely 
as the result of a little over indulgence, 
and what time would doubtless correct. 
No one could do more justice than I have

ever done, to the many amiable qualities 
of the dear creature. But how pale she 
looks! But no wonder, considering all 
the agitation she must have undergone, 
from the nefarious conduct of that un- 
principled man, she placed such mistaken 
confidence in. But now that we have got 
the dear angel again among us, we shall, 
by our united attentions, soon succeed, I 
trust, in restoring her to her usual health. 
But I must take a seat by her, to have a 
little conversation with her; for I shall 
not rest until I particularly learn how she 
feels herself;" and rising she proceeded to 
join her ; but she was disappointed in her 
aim â€” the moment Helena perceived her 
approaching, she rose and vacated her seat, 
for one that entrenched her from her. 

This, which was merely the effect of 
jsubdued spirits, rendering her unable to 
endure the thought of being teazed by 
her frivolous conversation â€” for Helena 
would have disdained herself, if she had 
allowed such a being to inspire her with 
resentment â€” was construed by Mrs. We- 
therall into a positive proof of her having 
given offence ; and in dismay and confu- 



CONTRAST. 197 

sion at the thought, she shrunk into a 
corner, and for the present conceived her 
best plan would be to quit Woodston. 

Lady Rossglen's arrival was quickly- 
followed by lord Ravensworth's, and pre- 
parations immediately commenced for the 
double nuptials in the family. Helena 
tried to appear to take an interest in what 
was going forward, but her abstracted 
manner too frequently rendered the ef- 
fort unavailing ; and Mountflorence, who 
watched her with even a tenderer, closer 
anxiety than his mother, the anxiety of a 
lover, was tempted, at times, to think 
that what occasioned such uneasiness to 
all, was the effect of some secret uneasi- 
ness preying on her mind ; but lady Ross- 
glen would not hearken to such a sugges- 
tion- â€” she would have it, that her altered 
manner was entirely the result of the per- 
plexities in which the villany of Bridge- 
more had plunged her, and that a little 
time, and soothing attentions, would re- 
store her to herself. 

" Would that it might be so," was the 
fervent aspiration of Mountflorence, " even 
though he profited not by the circum- 



198 CONTRAST. 

stance !" for to see her unhappy was indeed 
a source of misery to him. But would 
she continue inexorable ? would she disap- 
point hopes, that but for the early encou- 
ragement she had given them, would never 
have been what they were ? 

Spite of the promise and admonitions of 
his mother, he was more than once on the 
point of pressing the subject so inte- 
resting to him on her attention; but 
still, at the slightest attempt of the kind, 
Helena shrunk back, and in some way or 
other contrived to evade what she so evi- 
dently dreaded. This conduct would have 
plunged him into despair, but for the emo- 
tion that still marked her manner towards 
him : his abrupt appearance, his announce- 
ment of going away for any length of 
time, never failed to occasion a change of 
colour ; and in those blushing apparitions, 
the paleness that in angel whiteness bore 
away these blushes, he read what was still 
flattering to his wishes ; and was at length 
inclined to believe that the unhappiness 
she occasioned was the result of some hasty 
resolve concerning him, in a moment of ir- 
ritation, which she knew not how to break. 



CONTRAST. 199 

His attachment was by this time gene- 
rally known, and but for their mother's 
restrictions, the girls would certainly have 
remonstrated with Helena on her conduct 
towards him : as it was, Caroline could not 
altogether be prevented from speaking to 
her on the subject. " Positively, Helena," 
she said, " you must soon come to a deter- 
mination about Sigismund; that, if ulti- 
mately doomed to wear the willow for 
you, he may know his fate, ere it be too 
late for him to make another choice. If 
disappointed of you, there is a person I 
should of all things wish him to give us 
for a sister ; but she is too generally ad- 
mired, to allow him any great chance of 
obtaining her, if he delays any time mak- 
ing the attempt. Do you guess who I 
mean ?" 

Helena thought she did, but she could 
not frame her pallid lips to give utterance 
to the name. " Can't you save me the 
trouble of trying to do so ?" she faintly re- 
plied, and with eyes half declined, to avoid 
the archly-penetrating ones of Caroline. 

" Lady Bellair : is she not a lovely crea- 
ture?" 



200 CONTRAST. 

' *' Y â€” es," with difficulty, answered He- 
lena, " veryâ€”â€”" and she was going to add, 
she knew not what, when the entrance of 
lady Rossglen, with some visitors, inter- 
rupted the conversation ; and Helena took 
advantage of the circumstance to retreat 
to her own room. 

Oh ! what a pang had Caroline awaken- 
ed, in the thought that for any disappoint- 
ment he was now destined to experience, 
Mountflorence might soon seek consola* 
tion in the smiles of another! Yet what 
selfishness to shrink from the idea ! Could 
she wish him to lead a life of lingering 
anxiety and unhappiness on her account? 
to remain a stranger to those domestic 
joys he was so formed to delight in ? but to 
see him lavishing on another that tender- 
ness, those soft, those soothing attentions, 
so delicious to her soul â€” to see him pass- 
ing her coldly by, to dwell upon the looks, 
the smiles of another â€” to find him, by 
giving to lady Rossglen a still nearer, dear- 
er tie, gradually weakening the interest she 
experienced for her â€” how could she endure 
all this ? Yet to all this source of suffering 
she probably doomed herself, by persisting 



CONTRAST. 201 

in her resolution of refusing him. Then 
why persist in it? Ah! that was the 
question ! there was a cause, a reason for 
this, that none could surmise : she could 
not, in short, think of accepting his hand, 
with the consciousness of having any con- 
cealment from him : yet, at the bare idea 
of revealing to him the secret that was 
weighing on her heart, consuming her 
health, and empoisoning all the pleasures 
of life, she shrunk in dismay, not without 
being almost persuaded too, by so doing, 
that she should have to deplore the loss of 
his esteem, and depriving herself of his 
regard, both as a lover and a friend. 

Why had she quitted her retreat? or 
rather, why had she suffered it to be re- 
vealed ? Might she not have foreseen the 
trials, the struggles to which the circum- 
stance was likely to subject her? But she 
merited the misery she was undergoing ; 
and could she be assured of not being the 
cause of any to others, she would not com- 
plain. 

At length the happy day for celebrating 
the double weddings arrived. Immediately 
k3 



202 CONTRAST. 

after the solemnization of the ceremony, 
the bridal parties set out on different 
tours ; and lady Rossglen, with Helena and 
Mountflorence, on a quiet little excursion 
she had for some time been planning, on 
account of the former. Helena could not 
object to it, yet she saw with dread all it 
was likely to subject her to. Constantly as- 
sociated with Mountflorence, with no one to 
divert in any degree his attentions from 
her, with no opportunity of avoiding or 
escaping from him, how could she longer 
prevent the explanation she so dreaded? 
â€” that explanation, that by forcing her to 
be explicit, must destroy the hope that 
still attached him to her. She beheld, in 
short, the crisis of her fate at hand, and 
she trembled at the thought. A few more 
days, and how might, how probably would, 
all be changed! How vainly would she 
look, would she sigh, for those endearing 
attentions that now gave her the exquisite 
assurance of being beloved! Could she 
have resolution to persist in the determina- 
tion that must deprive her of these â€” that 
must doom her to remain a solitary being 
for the residue of her existence ? yet if 



CONTRAST. 203 

she did not, to what reproaches should she 
subject herself, from her own heart? what 
lasting apprehensions incur? and decide 
as she would, she saw she must be un- 
happy. 

But she tried to divert her mind from 
these reflections, that she might be able to 
enjoy the few short days of comparative 
felicity that still remained to her. Vain, 
however, was the effort : the redoubled 
attentions of Mountflorence, by drawing 
her heart still closer to him â€” by twining 
his idea more firmly than ever round it, 
rendered her still more wretched at the 
idea of what she ultimately contemplated; 
and lady Rossglen at length became se- 
riously alarmed. Keenly penetrating, 
Mountflorence clearly perceived to what 
was owing what had so alarmed his mo- 
ther; and he resolutely determined, by 
compelling Helena to candour, to have 
these painful struggles terminated, that 
were such a source of misery to both. 
Neither pride nor reason could permit the 
idea of his longer leading a life of lingering 
^suspense; and, having intimated his de^ 



^04 CONTRAST. 

termination to his mother, she undertook 
making it known to Helena. 

It may be supposed she did not long 
require an opportunity for the purpose. 
Mountflorence having purposely left them 
together one morning, in the quiet little 
inn where they had put up in the course 
of their excursion, after a little desultory 
^conversation â€” " Well, my dear Helena," 
she said, in a soothingly-affectionate tone, 
and drawing her chair close to hers, " I 
think you must acknowledge I have 
strictly adhered to the promise extorted 
from me previous to your leaving Wales : 
but silence on the subject, then forbidden, 
I can no longer think myself justified in 
observing, from the injurious consequences 
I see likely to result from it. With the 
feelings, the sentiments of Sigismund, you 
are acquainted ; you can therefore be at no 
loss to understand what he must suffer, 
from remaining in incertitude concerning 
yours. Nay, do not interrupt me," per- 
ceiving her, greatly agitated, about speak- 
ing ; " there has been no decided proof of 
indifference at your side, and without that, 
it was natural for hope to linger : still this 



CONTRAST. 205 

taay be experienced, though tried to be con- 
<:ealed, out of mistaken regard for the feel- 
ings of others. But be assured, should you 
Jbave made up your mind to refuse him, re- 
gret is the only feeling that can be experi- 
enced at the circumstance â€” say but that 
you entertain no preferable regard for him, 
and from that moment there is an end of 
any further importunity concerning him." 

Helena became, if possible, still more 
agitated ; she rose and traversed the room. 
" No," she cried, " I cannot say what you 
desire, without belying every feeling of 
my heart." 

" Then why, my dear creature," said 
lady Rossglen, also rising and taking her 
hand, " why be so cruel, both to yourself 
and your lover, as to wish any longer to 
avoid being explicit? if you really return 
his regard, and conceive it would be for 
your happiness a union with him, why 
hesitate about the generous acknowledg- 
ment?" 

The distress of Helena now amounted 
to agony. â€” " Oh, why am I thus press- 
ed I" she cried â€” " why did I expose my^ 
self to these importunities ! why is it my 



S06 CONTRAST. 

wretched fate to give pain, where I feel 
isuch anxiety for the enjoyment of happi- 
ness !" 



" Compose yourself," said lady Ross- 
glen, at once surprised and alarmed by her 
emotion. " Fear not being urged to any 
thing contrary to your feelings, by either 
me or mine. Sigismund must feel his 
disappointment acutely ; but time will, I 
trust, reconcile him to it; but, till the 
wound it inflicts is healed, I shall probably 
see him no more. The result of this con- 
versation was to decide his either remain- 
ing here or going abroad; so that you 
need be under no apprehension of being 
teazed by his complaints." 

The cheek of Helena turned of an ashy 
hue. Sigismund going without seeing 
her again? without intending to return, 
perhaps, until he had made another 
choice? How could she support the 
thought ? â€” " Let me not be the means of 
driving him away," she said â€” '* let me not 
be the means of depriving you of your 
^on. Oh ! if to induce him to remain, the 
â– assurance of my not being indifferent to 



CONTRAST. 207 

him was only wanting " and she sunk 

upon the bosom of lady Rossglen. 

She felt herself gently raised from it, 
and strained to a tumultuously-throbbing 
heart â€” she felt a cheek touch hers â€” she 
heard the voice of Sigismund, for the first 
time, call her the beloved of his soul â€” the 
sweet restorer of his happiness. Her fate 
was decided ; she had avowed her love for 
him, and how, after this avowal, could she 
refuse being his ? the wife of Sigismund ! 
and after all her resolves â€” her despair on 
the subject, was she really to be so bless- 
ed ! had she actually been betrayed into 
such happiness ! 

The place at which they had paused, in 
their journey, was a sweet little quiet vil- 
lage, as retired and sequestered as either 
melancholy or romantic love could desire 
it to be, both which alike shun public no- 
tice and observation ; and here it was 
finally settled the marriage should take 
place, without any parade. Yet, more 
than once, while Mountflorence was ab- 
sent, procuring a licence, Helena medi- 
tated dashing the cup of happiness from 
his lips; but when she reflected on. the 



208 CONTRAST. 

death-blow she should probably give to 
his peace by such a procedure, she shrunk, 
in dismay, from the thought, inwardly 
rejoicing, perhaps, at finding some pretext 
for obliging her to remain steady to her 
engagement. 

The weather had been delightful ; but, 
on the morning of the marriage, it was 
wet and gloomy. The spirits of the bride 
were affected by the lowering aspect of 
the sky, and the dreary appearance it gave 
to every thing without. â€” " Am I to con- 
sider this presageful of evil to me?" she 
cried, as she leaned against the dimmed 
window of her chamber, dressed for the 
approaching ceremony, but unable to 
make her appearance of her own accord. 

At length, lady Rossglen entered, to 
lead her to the impatient bridegroom; 
and the little party forthwith proceeded 
to the church, so contiguous to the inn, 
that a carriage was not deemed necessary 
for the occasion, more especially as they 
must still have proceeded on foot through 
the churchyard. Choked up with weeds 
and brambles, they with difficulty made 
their way through this. The trembling 



CONTRAST. 209 

bride, with eyes declined, saw only what 
was mournful ; a nameless dread had fas- 
tened on her spirits, that chilled her very 
soul; and by strangers it might well have 
been supposed, that she was rather a vie* 
tim dragged to the altar, than a tender 
bride, voluntarily approaching it, to phght 
her vows to the beloved of her heart. 

Mountflorence whispered every thing 
that was soothing and endearing. They 
were within a few paces of the entrance of 
the church, when the strength of Helena 
utterly forsook her, and she sank upon his 
breast. A good deal of confusion was oc- 
casioned by the circumstance; but the 
fears it excited were soon dispersed by her 
reviving. Mountflorence led her forward, 
and the ceremony immediately com- 
mencing, by an evidently resolute effort, 
she appeared to collect herself 

All went on well until the commence- 
ment of the solemn adjuration to confess, 
if conscious of any just cause why the ce- 
remony should not proceed, when the faint 
colour that had tinged the cheek of He- 
lena vanished from it, a shudder was seen 
to pervade her frame, and Mountflorence, 



210 CONTRAST. 

whose eyes were on her, feared she was 
on the point of fainting again. He was 
soon, however, relieved from this appre- 
hension ; again making an effort to reco- 
ver herself, she rested her hand on the 
railing of the altar, and motioned for the 
minister to proceed. 

But the ceremony was destined not to 
go on without interruption: when the 
ring came to be required, to his great con-, 
fusion, the bridegroom could not find it. 
After much searching, and many conjec- 
tures, he at length concluded he must 
have dropped it without, while assisting 
to recover her there ; and accordingly, his 
servant, who was in attendance, was sent 
out to look for it amongst the graves. 
After a short search, he found it on a 
tombstone. Some old women, who had 
collected about the church door, shook 
their heads at this, saying it was a sure 
sign that the new-married couple w^ould 
not enjoy many years together. 

At length Helena heard herself pro- 
nounced the wife of Sigismund. Oh, the 
sensations of that moment ! could she be- 
lieve it, that she was indeed his â€” indisso- 



CONTRAST. 211 

liibly his ? and she turned from the gratu- 
lations of the little party, to raise her 
eyes, with a kind of wild earnestness, to 
his. Mountflorence seemed to understand 
the look. â€” " My own !" he fondly whis- 
pered, as he clasped her to his heart ; " my 
Helena now for ever !" 

Tears burst from her â€” they relieved her 
swelling heart : she gradually grew more 
composed, and with a mild sweetness that 
enchanted, received the renewed congra- 
tulations of the few who had witnessed the 
ceremony. 

The minister and his wife, a pleasing, 
amiable woman, and their two daughters, 
who had attended as bridemaids, accom- 
panied the bridal party back to the inn, 
where they spent the remainder of the day ; 
and the next morning the journey was 
resumed.

CHAP. IX. 

" Sweet are the uses of Adversity, 
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous. 
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head : 
And this our life, exempt from public haunt. 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks. 
Sermons in stones, and good in every thing." 

After a prolonged excursion of a fort- 
night, the bridal party began to proceed 
homewards ; and from Woodston, Helena 
shortly removed, to be installed mistress 
of St. Finian's : neither of the other bridal 
parties had yet returned from theirs : en- 
tertainments in celebration of what had 
occurred, were only delayed till their arri- 
val, when it was expected the neighbour- 
hood would be a scene of festive gaiety for 
some time. 

Helena was glad that there was a short 
respite ere these entertainments commen- 
ced; a little uninterrupted time allowed 
her to collect her thoughts, and consider 
the new duties she had incurred. 



CONTRAST. 1213 

Reflections would suggest themselves, 
but she sedulously strove to banish all 
that could possibly lead to any thing in- 
jurious to the tranquillity of her beloved : 
to see a cloud now on her brow â€” to hear 
a sigh now stealing from her heart, and 
what might he not infer from it ? might 
it not lead to a doubt of the reality of 
that ardent, that impassioned love, that 
had hurried her to be his, spite of her oft- 
renewed determination to the contrary ? 

Would she be forgiven for breaking 
these resolves? but if any punishment 
awaited their failure, on her alone might 
it fall ! Vain wish ! her fate was now too 
inseparably connected with Mountflo- 
rence's, to render it possible she could suf- 
fer, without occasioning suffering to him ; 
and at the bare suggestion of this, she 
shrunk as from a thought fraught with 
madness. 

But whatever she might secretly think 
she merited, her unceasing arguments 
with herself had gradually a tranquillizing 
effect upon her mind ; still she was so ea- 
sily alarmed â€” her looks continued so deli- 
cate, that Mountflorence could not help 



1214 CONTRAST. 

contemplating her as a drooping flower, 
that required all that unceasing care and 
tenderness could do for its revival. 

What was his rapturous delight, to 
think that on him had devolved the right 
of watching over her ! that his was the 
guardian care, the fostering tenderness, 
on which she now relied ! 

Each day served to render her still dear- 
er and more precious to him, by discover- 
ing still some new charm in her mind ; 
and with mingled surprise and reproach, 
he thought of the manner in which, more 
than once, he had suffered his judgment 
to be misled conerning her. 

But Helena had never been just to her- 
self till now, and no wonder therefore that 
others should not. Hurried away by im- 
petuous feelings, she often strove, under 
the assumption of levity, and the affecta- 
tion of disdain, to conceal the real tender- 
ness and generosity of her nature ; but now 
that, disciplined by affliction, she saw the 
necessity of curbing these, what reason 
did she give Mountflorence to consider 
himself one of the happiest of men ! 
Amidst all the censure she had heretofore 



CONTRAST. ^15 

provoked, he had still, at times, been 
tempted to think their souls were not na- 
turally uncongenial ; and he was now con- 
iirmed in the persuasion. But though 
Helena felt that, on the continuance of his 
devoted attachment, her very existence 
depended, yet strange and inconsistent as 
it may appear, there were thoughts and 
reflections, that sometimes rendered it al- 
most a source of torture to her â€” a some- 
thing like a consciousness of un worthiness ; 
and then, in proportion as he loved, must 
he feel any calamity that befel her ; and 
what might not yet be in reserve for her 
unknown fate ? 

But she tried to fly from these â€” to dis- 
miss them from her mind, as the hideous 
phantoms of a feverish dream : and by 
still seeking refuge in varied pursuits and 
occupations, tolerably succeeded. She 
was often necessarily left alone ; lady Ross- 
glen could not always be with her; and 
Mountflorence, both as a landholder, 
and now a fixed resident in the county, 
had duties pressed upon him, that fre- 
quently drew him from home. The hours 
in which she was left to herself, she often 



216 OONTRAST. 

devoted to rambling about, delighted witb 
the varied scenery, the rich views, that 
at every turn presented themselves to her. 
For the musings of a romantic imagina- 
tion â€” for a mind imbued with a love of 
the picturesque, and inclined to those ab- 
stractions so soothing to the spirit, nothing 
could be better adapted than her new re- 
sidence, with its woods of ancient growth 
and solemn gloom, its screening hills, di- 
vided by wild woody dingles, wath burst- 
ing torrents raving through them, amidst 
bending trees and thickets. 

St. Finian's Abbey, as already observed, 
was a building of remote antiquity. With 
the moss of ages on its venerable brow, 
rifted by time, and interspersed wdth 
groups of shadowing trees, it stood in 
lonely grandeur, receding amidst the re- 
cesses of the green hills that rose above 
it. An undulating lawn extended in 
front, through which a mountain stream- 
let held its course, now, with mimic fury, 
foaming over low ridges of moss-tinted 
rock, and now again flowing on, clear and 
unruffled, to gain the tranquil mazes of 
the quiet vale. The pile had originally 



CONTRAST. 217 

been sequestered in deep embowering 
shades, but these had now been sufficient- 
ly thinned to admit a variety of views of 
those highly interesting and magnificent 
ruins ; where still, as in other days, devo- 
tees were from time to time to be seen, 
performing various penances, and the 
sweet custom of dressing the graves with 
flowers was kept up. The effect of time 
upon the productions of nature, as well as 
the works of man, was here visible. Many a 
tree with rifted rinds and long, lean, hang- 
ing boughs, like skeleton arms, here stood 
desolate, and with quivering leaves that, 
as in mockery, sawed the air, whispered 
how time had triumphed : but still many 
an ancient oak and sturdy elm flou- 
rished in primeval beauty, their umbra- 
geous shade forming a canopy of gloom, 
beneath the ample cope of which the shel- 
tered cattle loved to repose, in the noon- 
tide hour. 

The profound quietude of the place â€” 
its partial concealment amidst hills and 
trees, gave it altogether an air of monastic 
seclusion, that called to mind its original 

VOL. III. L 



218 CONTRAST. 

destination, and rendered it most particu- 
larly interesting to the imagination. 

Hither Helena delighted to repairâ€” here, 
when left to herself, to sit and meditate â€” 
here, where there was nothing to interrupt 
her reflections â€” nobody to notice the agi- 
tation that would still result from the in- 
voluntary recurrence of her thoughts to 
the past, or impede the overflowing grati- 
tude with which her chastened heart look- 
ed up to Heaven for the blessings now 
enjoyed. 

But her solitary hours were not entirely 
passed in this manner. She made it a point 
to go herself amongst the poor tenantry, 
that she might be enabled to judge, from 
actual observation, of their exact condition, 
and see how best the benevolent plans she 
and Mountflorence had formed with regard 
to them, could be carried into effect. 

At length, the arrival of her sisters with 
their lords was announced ; and the enter- 
tainments already alluded to, immediately 
commenced. 

Left immediately after breakfast one 
morning by JNIountflorence, as was some- 
times unavoidably the case, county busi- 



CONTRAST. 219 

ness now a good deal engaging him, He- 
lena put on her bonnet, and strolled away 
to St. Finians, to recruit herself by a quiet 
walk, after being kept up to a late hour 
the preceding night, at a ball in the neigh- 
bourhood. The day was heavenly : the 
sun shone, she thought, with even more 
than wonted brightness; and as she ap- 
proached the majestic ruin, there was a 
glow of transparency thrown over that, 
and the surrounding scenery, such as 
served to heighten the impressive and 
picturesque effect of each. She seated 
herself on her favourite spot, a grassy hil- 
lock, beside the stream; where, while she 
enjoyed the beauty and the tranquilHty of 
the scene, her ear was delighted with the 
blackbird's soft whistle, and the lark's me- 
lodious song. The fleecy tribe nipped the 
fresh herbage round her, and the cattle 
were lowing on the hills ; all, in short, was 
pastoral and cheering, and gradually im- 
parted a serenity to the mind of Helena, 
such as she had long been a stranger to. 
The past â€” the horrid past, seemed losing 
its hold on her long-haunted imagination ; 
L 2 



220 CONTRAST. 

her heart felt as if throwing off a cumbrous 
weight of sorrow; and a calm feeling of 
happiness to be diffusing itself throughout 
her soul. But how transient is human 
enjoyment ! the pleasures of this life seem 
to visit us at times but to render a change 
the more painful and oppressive. Helena 
was sitting absorbed in the enjoyment of 
the soothing feelings just described, when 
she was startled by the breathing of a sigh, 
or rather utterance of a groan, close to her. 
She started up, and retreating a few paces, 
strove to penetrate with her looks the 
thicket whence it issued, but in vain; the 
foliage was too thick for the eye to pene- 
trate, and she experienced she knew not 
what of uneasiness and alarm, at the 
thought of a person being concealed near 
her. Could it be a mendicant? but no, it 
was not probable that a person of this de- 
scription would rather have sought to 
avoid the chance of obtaining charity than 
solicit it ; and she became still more dis- 
turbed ; but she would examine the spot, 
and she accordingly forced her way through 
the tangled trees and bushes that had at 
once formed a support and screen for her 



CONTRAST. 221 

where she had been sitting ; but she could 
not discover any one, and her agitation, in 
consequence, a little subsided : for had the 
person concealed required any communica- 
tion with her, they certainly would not have 
withdrawn in this manner. Yet she could 
not help musing on the circumstance â€” the 
long-drawn groan, seeming to be wrung 
by agony from a tortured heart, dwelt 
upon her ear. '* And oh, vain hope !" she 
involuntarily sighed, " that with a heart 
burdened like mine, the tranquillity I need 
would be experienced ! Happy, happy, 
those, who, unconscious of mystery or con- 
cealment, dread no sudden shocks or sur- 
prises! yet again I may be an object of 
envy; but, alas! the tortured heart alone 
knows its own bitterness I it is given me 
again to inhale the sweetness of the rose, 
but how can I enjoy the fragrance, not 
knowing the moment in which its thorns 
may perhaps be forced within my palpi- 
tating breast." 

She walked on, without regarding in 
what direction, till she found herself in 
one of the private roads made through the 
domain. A poor widow, to whom she 



222 CONTRAST. 

had been very kind, had a little cabin at 
the side of it, and since so near, she thought 
she would just step in and inquire after 
one of her children, who had been very ill. 
Just as she was crossing it with this inten- 
tion, a man, uncouthly muffled up, darted 
past her, and as he plunged into the gloom 
of a narrow dingle, overrun with brush- 
wood, cast a glance at her â€” a withering 
glance, it seemed, for, with a shriek that 
rent the air, she fell lifeless on the earth. 

The poor cotter, who had been watching 
her approach, hastened out, and bore her 
into her hovel; water was sprinkled on 
her face, and in a few minutes she revived. 
The moment she came to herself, pushing 
away the woman, who intercepted her 
view of the door, and the little children, 
who had crept round her â€” " Where is 
he?" she demanded, with eyes starting, 
as it were, from their sockets. " Which 
way did he go ? or is he really gone ?" 

" Who, lady dear?" asked Norah ; " who, 
mistress, jewel ?" 

" Oh ! that apparition of horror ! that 
spectre of the dead !" cried Helena, rising, 
and repairing to the door, with wildness 



CONTRAST. 223 

in her look, her bonnet thrown aside on 
the floor, and her dark hair dishevelled 
o'er her ashy cheek. 

" Is it a ghost, mistress dear, you mean ? 
Why then sure, any how, it's not at this 
hour of the day, by the blessed daylight, 
that myself ever heard of such folks walk- 
ing." 

" Giiost !" repeated Helena, with an 
hysteric laugh. "Oh, no, no! would that I 
had nothing but ideal terrors to contend 
with ! I mean that man â€” that strange- 
looking man, that plunged into the dingle, 
just as I was crossing to you?" 

" Is it the pilgrim, jewel ?" 

" Pilgrim!" repeated Helena. " Are 
you sure â€” are you certain he is a pilgrim ? 
or do you know him ?" 

" No, jewel; its the neighbours have 
told me of him; they say he has been 
roaming about here these some days." 

" Here !" repeated Helena, emphati- 
cally ; and her heart, which had began to 
revive a little, again sunk within her. 

" Yes, gra ; he has been met at the 
abbey, and down at the cave, in the dell. 



224 CONTRAST. 

and at the blessed well, doing penance, to 
be sure." 

" And are there really persons that now 
go about doing penance ?" demanded He- 
lena, " or who call themselves pilgrims?" 

"Ah, then, sure it's the master could 
have told you that ! the abbey here, and 
its blessed well ; and Loughderg ; and the 
seven churches in the county Wicklow; 
and St. Patrick's Bed, at the Giant's Cause- 
way, are all stations for them." 

" And does no one know this man, of 
whom we are speaking?" 

" Sorrow one, that I know, knows him: 
but strangers often come on pilgrimages 
here." 

" If you seek through the county for 
him, you must find him, and learn his 
name for me," said Helena ; " 'tis essential 
to my peace â€” to my reason â€” to my life, 
that I should know it ! but you must not 
mention to any one what I have desired : 
lose no time in obeying me ; and there's 
nothing you can demand that you shall 
not have for your trouble and your se- 
crecy." 

" Ah, then I am sure it would well 



CONTRAST. 225 

become me to make a bargain for either ! 
as if it wasn't my duty to go all over the 
world, on my bare knees, for you, if you 
wanted it, after all you have done for me 
and mine â€” giving us clothes and food, 
God help us ! and making up to the poor 
childer, in all ways, for the loss of the 
poor father that's now under the turf. 
Make yourself easy, gra ; for if this pil- 
grim be above ground, troth, and it's my- 
self will make him out for you, before I 
am many days older." 

Helena, throwing some money to the 
children, took up her bonnet, and quitted 
the cabin. As she passed the dingle, she 
shudderingly cast a glance down it; but 
the object of her terror was not visible. 
Oh that he might prove what it had 
been intimated he might be ! And when 
she thought of the transient glance she 
had had, she tried to hope the best. 
Yet if her eye, after all, had not deceived

suggestion, and she strove to fly from it. 
Had she not witnessed a scene that ren- 
dered most improbable what she appre- 
hended? and she tried to take comfort

from the thought; but her feelings had 
been too terribly excited to allow of their 
being readily calmed; and besides, was 
not her soul still agitated by suspense? 
and she continued straying about, heed- 
less how the hours were passing, till she 
suddenly recollected the necessity there 
was for returning to the house without 
further delay, where there was to be a 
grand dinner-party that day, and splendid 
ball in the evening, if she wished to avoid 
creating alarm. Yet how could she pre- 
pare for company, in the state of mind she 
was in? But it must be done, and she 
turned homewards. 

Within a little distance of the house 
she was met by Mountflorence, coming 
out to seek her. â€” " Why, my love," he 
said, " I was beginning to think you had 
ran away from me. But have you been 
ill ? or did you meet with any accident ?" 
he demanded, in a tone of anxious alarm, 
on observing her extreme paleness, and 
the disorder of her appearance; her hair 
lying still damp about her face, while her 
bonnet, thrown carelessly on, was all soil- 
ed and crumpled, from having been flung 



CONTRAST. 227 

on the mud floor of the cabin, and there 
trampled on by the children, in pressing 
about her. 

"Nâ€”o, notâ€” very," answered Helena, with 
difficulty ; " near the cottage of poorNorah 
I became a little indisposed, and the water 
with which she thought proper to sprinkle 
my face, has, I make no doubt, made me 
a most deplorable-looking figure." 

" I really cannot contradict you," said 
Mountflorence ; " but how could you 
think of walking so far as Norah's this 
warm day ? no wonder you should be taken 
ill. You told me it was not your inten- 
tion to go farther than the abbey; and 
there it was, accordingly, I was about pro- 
ceeding to seek you." 

" It was not at first; but I don't know 
how it was, I was tempted on." 

" Well, no matter," said Mountflorence, 
as he fondly circled her waist with his 
arm ; " but this I must tell you, I believe 
I shall be tempted to turn over a new leaf 
with you, if this is the way you go stray- 
ing about during my absence ; and, instead 
of allowing you the liberty I have hitherto 
done, shut you up in one of the cells while 



228 CONTRAST. 

I am away, as a truant not to be trusted. 
Seriously, I shall get mamma to remon- 
strate with you, on the injury you may 
do yourself by incurring this fatigue," and 
he would not allow her to retire to dress 
till she had taken some refreshment, and 
appeared better. 

But the shock she had sustained was 
not easily to be got over ; more especially, 
still unrelieved as she was entirely from 
the terror that had been inspired; and 
never was the task of dressing so irksome. 
This was her first entertainment since her 
marriage, and she, accordingly, was to 
appear as a bride ; and her faithful Mar- 
garet, who had by this time become an 
expert attendant, was astonished at the 
indifference with which she put on her 
elegant dress, and her splendid ornaments, 
the fond gift of Sigismund. 

Never had she looked more lovely. 
The colour that gave animation to her 
countenance was fled, but her paleness 
imparted an interest to her appearance that 
was indescribably captivating, and every 
eye gazed on her with admiration, but that 
of envy â€” but all was lost upon Helena: 



CONTRAST. 229 

yet she made every possible effort to seem 
as usual : but forced efforts are seldom 
successful; and Mountflorence, who had 
made her countenance a study, would have 
been alarmed, could he have allowed him- 
self to imagine that she would have had 
any concealed cause for uneasiness from him. 

Mrs. Wetherall was, of course, of the 
party. Suddenly addressing herself to 
Mountflorence, while yet at dinner, she 
asked whether he knew who had come 
over by the last packet? but without 
allowing him to reply â€” " I conclude 
not," she said ; " for he is evidently come 
over incog, travelling as he is, under an 
assumed name. I saw him landing, and 
so learned this ; for he was pointed out to 
me in London as â€” asâ€”â€”" and she glanced 
significantly at Helena; and without finish- 
ing the sentence â€” " A prodigious fine- 
looking man he is !" she added â€” " I never 
saw such beautiful mustachios ; and then 
such eyes " 

" Of whom do you speak, ma'am ?** 
asked Mountflorence. 

" Why, of no less a personage than 
prince Zamoski !" 



830 CONTRAST. 

"Prince Zamoski !" repeated Mountflo- 
rence, in a tone indicative of no slight 
emotion ; " is it possible ?" and he invo- 
luntarily turned his eyes upon Helena. 
She was regarding him at the instant, and 
on encountering his eyes, a deep blush 
overspread her countenance. Mountflo- 
rcnce felt uneasy. Could it be that she 
had been already apprized of the prince's 
arrival, and not liking, from certain re- 
collections, to mention it to him, had be- 
come uneasy, for, under some kind of 
uneasiness he was now convinced she was, 
lest he should discover the circumstance ? 
Yet, no ; for to suppose this would be to 
imagine, that in some quarter it was 
known she had a particular interest in ob- 
taining the information, an idea that was 
not for a moment admissible. But her 
manner was certainly not as usual this 
day ; but had she not told him she was 
indisposed ? and was not that sufficient to 
account for all that he was now musing 
on ? and he felt quite indignant with him- 
self. Still his suddenly-darkened brow 
did not unbend, and the smile that had 
shed sunshine round him was gone. 



CONTRAST. 2S1 

Helena, who from time to time stole a 
timid glance at him, saw all this, to her 
extreme distress. At this exact juncture, 
to have had any thing occur that might 
unconsciously cause him to be more ob- 
ser\'^ant of her, when she so particularly 
required to be unnoticed â€” how unfortu- 
nate ! but it seemed to her as if there was 
to be nothing wanting to augment her 
misery. Invidious woman ! what had she 
done to provoke the enmity of her cruel 
relative ? for well she saw, from the turn 
of her eye, her glance at her, that it was 
from the most insidious motive she had 
made known the arrival of the prince. 

Many as were the days of unhappiness 
she had experienced, one of more thorough 
wretchedness than the present she had 
never passed â€” wretchedness aggravated 
by the necessity there was for concealing 
it ; and, as if to aggravate which, in the 
course of the evening it was announced, 
that Mr. and Mrs. De Montville had ar- 
rived at RockclifFe, so that the dreaded 
meeting with Adelaide could no longer be 
avoided ; and, to shame at the thought of 
encountering her, was united alarm at the 



232 CONTRAST. 

idea of the effect that might be produced 
upon Mountflorence, should, through any- 
natural resentment, her conduct to her 
have transpired. 

What a contrast did she feel she formed 
to her sisters, sparkling as they were with 
the genial glow of youth and happiness ! 
yet her prospects were as fair, her seeming 
happiness as assured, as theirs. But, ah ! 
she had at her heart what they had not â€” 
a canker-worm, through the consciousness 
of concealment, where all was imagined to 
be candour and sincerity. 

At length she was relieved from the 
painful restraint she had been enduring. 
Ere the last guest had well departed, she 
hastened to her chamber, and with an 
averted face, in order to prevent her seeing 
the tears that were streaming down it, 
desired her attendant to inform her master 
she felt so extremely indisposed, she would 
be glad he occupied another apartment 
that night. 

Mountflorence, on receiving this mes- 
sage, in great alarm, hastened to her cham- 
ber. Helena had hurried to bed, and on 
hearing him approach, feigned what she 



CONTRAST. 233 

was convinced would not visit her eyelids 
that night, a deep sleep ; but the artifice 
did not succeed ; Mountflorence continued 
bending over her pillow, till certain he 
would not retire without being in some 
degree relieved from the apprehension she 
had excited, she suddenly affected to 
waken, and extending her hand to him, 
" Oh ! my love," she cried, " why do I see 
you here ?" 

" How can you ask such a question," 
cried Mountflorence, in a tone of tender 
reproach, " after sending me such a mes- 
sage? but are you really so ill," he de- 
manded, fondly kissing her cheek, " that 
I am to be banished hence?" 

" Repose, I make no doubt, will restore 
me," replied Helena, a little evasively; 
" and now good night, my love ; for while 
you remain here, I am prevented seeking 
that rest essential to me." 

Mountflorence, fervently embracing her, 
repeated her emphatic " God bless you," 
and retired. 

As he was entering his dressing-room, 
putting his hand to his cheek, he found it 
wet: she was weeping then, for it was 



234 CONTRAST. 

her tears were upon it. " Could indisposi- 
tion have occasioned this?" and he be- 
came cruelly agitated. Under the in- 
fluence of this emotion, he was on the 
point of returning to her chamber, when 
the barbarity of disturbing her repose, if 
indeed indisposed, prevented him. But 
another day, he decided, should not pass 
without setting at rest the fears by which 
he was tormented ; he would force her to 
acknowledge whether or not they were 
groundless. 

To what a paroxysm of anguish did the 
wretched Helena abandon herself on his 
leaving her ! Starting up in the bed, she 
listened to his receding footsteps; then, 
throwing herself upon his pillow, she 
grasped it with frantic fondness to her 
heart, and bedewed it with her tears ; " for 
oh ! never, never, perhaps, would he again 
rest on it, in slumber at her side!" 

Impatiently she watched for the dawn ; 
the moment it was visible, she started 
from her feverish couch, and hastily dress- 
ing herself, stole from her chamber, and 
cautiously letting herself out, by a private 
door, hurried away to Norah's. 



CONTRAST. 235 

The astonishment of the poor creature, 
at seeing her at such an hour, was ex- 
treme; the anxiety it manifested for the 
information she had employed her to ob- 
tain, made her deeply lament not having 
any thing satisfactory to communicate. 
High and low she had sought the pil- 
grim, but without being able to make him 
out ; but in the course of the present day, 
she made no doubt she should, and she 
would then directly let her know. 

Helena endeavoured, but in vain, to 
ascertain at what hour she might expect 
to see her; and she departed in nowise 
relieved from the torturing incertitude 
that had occasioned this early visit. The 
sun was now rising, and from every bush 
and bough the feathered tribe were pour- 
ing forth their matin lays ; but neither the 
beauty of the hour, nor yet the tranquil- 
lity of the far-extended scene, had any effect 
upon her mind ; on the contrary, the lat- 
ter rather seemed to aggravate its anguish, 
forming as it did such a contrast to the 
present perturbed state of her feelings. 
She tried, however, to collect and compose 
herself, in order to avoid giving Mount- 



286 CONTRAST. 

florence any additional cause for uneasi- 
ness; and also, lest of otherwise provok- 
ing inquiries she might not know how to 
answer. 

She had yet another for trying to curb 
her feehngs â€” a wish to get back before he 
had risen; spite, however, of this wish, 
this anxiety to reach home time enough 
to prevent his knowing of her being abroad, 
she could not help still pausing as she pro- 
ceeded, under the torturing idea that, ere 
another day, she might be a banished 
wretch from all that was so fair, so lovely. 
Her way lay by the A bbey. How solemn- 
ly impressive its stillness, at this quiet 
hour ! as her eyes wandered over the hal- 
lowed pile, she envied the repose of those 
who rested within its ivied walls : yet a 
few days, a few hours, perhaps, and she 
might participate in what she envied 
them. She felt her frame shaken almost 
to dissolution by the shock lately sustain- 
ed ; and latterly she had more than once 
been induced to think she should not be 
long-lived. And why should she weep 
at the thought ? â€” she whose eyes had just 
been dim with tears of anguish ! What a 



CONTRAST. 237 

chequered scene had life proved to her ! 
No matter now, whether through her own 
means, or those of others ; such was the 
case, and bitterly she felt what she had 
been made to suffer. Yet so soon to be 
snatched from the glorious splendours that 
invest the morning sky â€” from cheering 
light â€” from those sweet smiles of heaven, 
that show us what a paradise this world can 
be ! with a heart still throbbing with all 
the glowing sensibilities of her nature, to 
be given up to dull forgetfulness â€” to be 
torn from him on whom her soul doated â€” 
to make room perhaps for another, to 
efface her idea from his mind; and how 
could she forbear to weep at the thought ! 
Again she hurried on; she was nearly 
within sight of the house, when, to her 
inexpressible confusion, she encountered 
IMountflorence. Like her, he had been 
unable to taste the blessing of repose 
throughout the night ; and like her, at an 
early hour, had abandoned his restless 
couch. As a serpent's tooth, an adder's 
sting, was the pang experienced by Mount- 
florence at the moment. Yet it was not 
so much meeting her out at this extraordi- 



238 CONTRAST. 

nary hour that startled him, as her woful 
appearance altogether ; her dress draggled 
by the morning dew, her hair in disorder 
about her face, her cheek pale as death, 
and eyes still swoln with weeping ; and 
â€” " Good God !" he exclaimed, starting 
back, " something must be amiss ! Helena, 
Helena," he cried, grasping her hands, 
" you are deceiving me ! I feel that you 
have deceived me !" 

Helena, forcing away one hand from 
him, covered her face with it. â€” " Deceiv- 
ing you !" she repeated ; " in what way do 
you accuse me of this ? â€” through what 
circumstance ?" 

" You cannot but be conscious," said 
Mountflorence, with something of bitter- 
ness in his tone ; " your extraordinary ap- 
pearance of this morning, and the strange 
embarrassment and abstraction of yester- 
day !" 

" Unkind Mountflorence !" said He- 
lena; " is nothing to be placed to the 
score of indisposition?" and she wept 
bitterly. 

Mountflorence was moved : had he then 
wronged her, by yielding to the thoughts 



CONTRAST. 239 

that had forced themselves upon him? 
and at the possibility he took her in his 
arms, pressed her to his breast, and said 
every thing that was kind and soothing. 
Still her tears fell.â€”" Yet I do not alto- 
gether deny," she cried, suddenly raising 
her head from his bosom, "that I have 
deceived you, if not to have told you 
that existence depended on your love â€” 
that the world without you would be a 
wilderness, be indeed to have done so!" 

The now transported Mountflorence 
clasped her again to his heart â€” " My love, 
my Helena !" he cried ; " how could I 
hurt your gentle nature as I have done ? 
but how easily is the miser alarmed about 
his treasure! till I called you mine, I knew 
not the fervour of my affection for you : 

to conceive it possible that " but he 

checked himself from proceeding, and fond- 
ly wiping away her tears, hurried her for- 
ward to the house, saying a comfortable 
breakfast would be of service to both. 

Helena tried to smile ; but spite of all 
her efforts, a stray tear would now and 
then fall: Mountflorence, however, no 
longer experienced the uneasiness that had 



240 CONTRAST. 

lately agitated his feelings ; he persuaded 
himself that her languor, and all that had 
disturbed him in her manner, was entirely- 
owing to over-fatigued spirits, or a slight 
indisposition ; still he was most reluctant 
to leave her, shortly after breakfast, as he 
was compelled. He did not depart with- 
out reminding her of their engagement to 
dinner that day at lord Glena's, with an 
assurance, that if she did not keep it, he 
would not remain ; for the place he was 
going to being nearer to his lordship's 
than St. Finian's, it had been settled that 
he should dress there, instead of returning 
home for the purpose. 

Helena gave him the required promise, 
and with a fond caress he left her. But 
she had promised what she did not know 
she could perform; for except she saw 
Norah, and except the information ob- 
tained relieved her from the state of horror 
she was in, it was utterly impossible she 
could meet him at loid Glena's. 

It need not be said, the agonizing im- 
patience wdth which she watched for her 
messenger ; but she was not kept long in 
this state: ere the morning was far ad-! 



CONTRAST. 241 

vanced, she saw her approaching ; she rush- 
ed out, through the shrubbery, to meet 
her, and beckoning her to a distance from 
the house â€” " Now ! now !" with breathless 
eagerness, she cried. 

" Well, lady dear, I have found him at 
last," said Norah ; " but troth, and to my 
belief, he's no more a pilgrim nor you and 
I: howsoever, be that as it may, I asked 
him his name, telling him by whose de- 
sire ; but nothing could make him tell it 
me ; * You should only hear it from him- 
self,' he said ; and without fail he desired 
you to be at the Abbey to-night, when 
you should know all you wanted ; and he 
went on muttering something to himself, 
of being a wronged man, and of having 
eome here to get justice done him ; and 
when I told you all this, he said, you'd 
guess well enough who he was, without 
his giving his name: but, oh, mistress, 
darling, how white you've turned ! sure 
it's not going to faint you are !" and the 
affrighted Norah looked about her, as if to 
see whether there was any one to whom 
she could call for assistance. 

VOL. Ill, M 



242 CONTRAST. 

" No, no," replied Helena, raising her- 
self from the tree against which she had 
tottered : " at the Abbey you say, to- 
night ?" 

"Yes, jewel; at the Abbey t<^-night, 
when it is dusk â€” he'll be sure to meet you 
there: and indeed he must see you, he 
said, for it was to do so he came into 
these parts, and has been roaming about 
here." 

" Enough, enough !" said Helena ; " you 
have had some trouble in seeking him, 
and I promised to recompense it," and she 
dropped her purse on the ground. 

" Oh, mistress, darling ! sure you don't 
think I'd take all this money from you ?" 
cried Norah, as she picked up the purse. 

" Take it, take it," said Helena, impa- 
tiently ; " it will be my last gift," she mur- 
mured. 

" Sure then, if I do, it will be with ten 
thousand blessings!" cried the at-once 
transported and nearly-overpowered No- 
rah; "with the blessing of the widow," 
dropping on her knees, " and of the poor 
fatherless and destitute. Long may you 
live in happiness and honour ! and -" 



CONTRAST. 243 

" Mock me not with these wishes !'* ex- 
claimed Helena, with rising frenzy ; " there 
are no blessings remaining for me ! all are 
lost â€” gone â€” wrested from me for ever ! 
never, never to be restored !" but in a more 
subdued tone, recollecting herself â€” " say 
nothing of all this, my good woman : I 
have met with something to disturb my 
mind, but I should not wish it to be 
known ; on your discretion I depend. 
Good-bye! make a good use of what I 
have given you ; and may you be happy 
with your children !" and waving to her 
not to speak, or attempt to follow, she re- 
treated to the house. 

Incertitude was now over â€” she was re- 
lieved from suspense, but how? to find 
herself the veriest wretch upon the face of 
the earth ! Whither should she fly ? where 
betake herself, to hide her shame and mi- 
sery ? to avoid the reproaches she had in- 
curred â€” the hearing of the happiness she 
had blasted? There were a number of 
caves upon this wild part of the coast ; she 
would creep into one of them, and have 
the consolation of sighing away the few 
M 2 



244 CONTRAST. 

remaining days of her short existence, in 
the vicinity of her beloved, where, haply, 
some chance might yet conduct him; and 
when he saw that by her death she had 
atoned for her offence against him, would 
he not, with the benevolence of his na- 
ture, be tempted to forgive her, and in 
forgiving, perhaps to remove her cold re- 
mains to the hallowed earth yet destined 
to receive his, so that in the grave they 
might again be united : and she wept tor- 
rents over the mournful images suggested 
by her fancy. 

These tears had, at length, the effect of 
cooling a little her burning brain : as she 
a little recovered herself, the necessity for 
deciding on her plan, without further de- 
lay, became obvious ; flight was her deter- 
mination; but how could she think of 
carrying this into effect, without account- 
ing to JNIountflorence for it ? Exclusive 
of the barbarity there would be in leaving 
him in suspense, or ignorance of her fate, 
the circumstance was liable to a miscon- 
struction, that might lead to the most 
dreadful consequences: but was there time 
for what she deemed expedient to prevent 



CONTRAST. 245 

injury to others, as well as any further in- 
jury to her own fame ? Yes, the day was 
yet early, and by not delaying, she made 
no doubt she should be able to accomplish 
her painful task, ere any alarm could be 
created at lord Glena's, by her not keeping 
her engagement there. Accordingly she 
fled to her chamber, where, bolting her- 
self in, to prevent interruption, she sat 
down, to at length unburthen her tor- 
tured heart to him, from whom she was 
on the point of tearing herself for ever. 



CHAP. X. 

" In his bosom Til unclasp my heart " 

" Necessary as I consider what I am 
about attempting, yet how should I have 
had courage for the effort, but that I 
know, ere this meets your eye, I shall be 
out of the reach of your resentment â€” your 
reproaches; and oh! still more dreaded 
and afflicting, the distress I shall have 
caused you ! But how shall I commence 



246 CONTRAST. 

the detail I have to give? Vainly do I 
strive to collect myself for the task. 
How shall I prepare you for a communi- 
cation my own soul shuddering recoils 
from ? But without the humiliation, the 
wretchedness, the idea of it overwhelms 
me with, my punishment would be in- 
complete â€” that punishment I too con- 
sciously feel I merit. 

" I know I might plead, in extenuation 
of my errors, the erroneous indulgence 
that cherished, instead of checked them : 
but no, I cannot offer such a plea, aware 
as I am that our errors are only excusable, 
when not sensible of the consequences 
likely to result from them. I early saw 
that the warmth of my temper, the impe- 
tuosity of my feelings, were likely to lead 
to evil ; but the thought did not operate 
to my advantage, and the consequence, 
the bitter consequence, has been what 
might have been anticipated. 

" But amidst my faults, want of sin- 
cerity was not to be numbered : impulse 
indeed was my guide ; I affected no re- 
gard I did not feel; I placed no trust 
where I did not confide; in short, I knew 



CONTRAST. 247 

no cold medium in my friendships or at- 
tachments; I either loved with all my 
heart, or else I loved not at all ; and where 
I confided, it was so implicitly, as to throw 
myself at once into the power of those on 
whom I relied. Of the cruel advantage 
taken by Bridgemore, of this ardent and un- 
suspicious temper, you know; of my giddy 
thoughtlessness, the sad fault of youth, and 
the carelessness occasioned by my embit- 
tered spirit, embittered by the idea of being- 
cast off by those on whose affection I had de- 
pended for not finding myself what the sen- 
sitive heart shrinks from, an isolated being. 
You know also of the letter I voluntarily 
wrote you ; and also of the one addressed 
to lady Rossglen, at the persuasion of my 
zealous friend, Mr. Trueman ; but you 
know not the despair into which I was 
plunged by their supposed neglect, de- 
stroying, as did this, the hope that till then 
had lingered in my heart, of some expla- 
nation yet taking place, that would prove 
what so deeply affected, the result of 
either artifice or mistake. In the feelings 
excited, I decided on retiring from what 
is called the world ; for what, I argued 



248 CONTRAST. 

with myself, had I longer to do in ii, 
stripped as I was of fortune, by perfidy, 
and deprived of the consolation of kindred 
ties, through unkindness ? 

" Mr. Trueman protested against this 
rash resolve of hasty irritation ; but I would 
hearken to nothing but its suggestions ; I 
would go to where no eye that knew me 
would be likely to encounter me ; where 
no sneer would be provoked by my alter- 
ed circumstances; and above all, where I 
should be so completely buried, that if 
late remorse touched the hearts of those 
who had treated me so unkindly, the feel- 
ing should be aggravated by the incerti- 
tude in which they should still be obliged 
to continue of my fate. 

" Finding me not to be dissuaded from 
my plan, Mr. Trueman spoke of the Con- 
tinent ; but though, in the romantic mu- 
sings of lonely hours, I had often wished 
to find myself the inhabitant of some of 
its magnificent solitudes, to wander along 
the shores of those beautiful lakes, beneath 
the shadow of those everlasting mountains, 
amidst those magnificent ruins, that at 



CONTRAST. 24^ 

every step, at every turn, awaken sonae 
recollection interesting to the heart, and 
enchanting to the imagination, I now- 
shrunk from the thought of any thing but 
my own suggestion â€” of hiding myself 
where it was most unlikely such a thing 
would ever be surmised. 

*' On the headland opposite to Wood- 
ston, beside the old building that runs 
rambling along the cliffs, that form what 
is called the Pirate's Cave, there stands ano- 
ther, at some distance from this, of exactly 
coeval date, as you doubtless know, that 
has been long abandoned by the Catholic 
family to which it belongs, through their 
settling abroad. The old followers of the 
family, to whom it was given up, were in 
the habit, I learned, while at Woods ton, 
of letting part of it, whenever they could, 
which was not perhaps once in many 
years, so lonely and out of the way was 
the situation ; and provided they were se- 
cure of remuneration for any accommoda- 
tion afforded, cared little about any thing 
else. The moment I decided on burying 
myself in solitude, this desolate place re- 
M 3

curred to my recollection, and I determin* 
ed, if possible, on becoming its inmate. 

" On mentioning my intention to Mr. 
Trueman, he again had recourse to argu- 
ments; but he had to do with a spirit, ren- 
dered petulant through disappointment, 
and stubborn through resentment; and 
finding me resolved, he proceeded to make 
the inquiries I requested, and soon gave 
me the gratifying information of being 
able to obtain what I wished. Arrange- 
ments were immediately made for my de- 
parture, and I forthwith set out, accom- 
panied by my maid. I felt impatient to 
be gone ; yet at the moment of quitting 
what is, as I have already said, called the 
world, some natural tears fell from me; 
yet, to me, it had proved no paradise : it 
had certainly abounded with enjoyments; 
but still I had not found in it the rose 
without the thorn, neither the spear of 
an Ithuriel, to point out who was to be 
trusted; but the heart involuntarily be- 
comes attached to what it has been accus- 
tomed to : were not this the case, would 
poor JNIisfortune so often shudder, as it 
does, at the thought of quitting this scene 



CONTRAST. 251 

of woe, where sorrow succeeding sorrow, 
like wave rolling after wave, breaks down, 
at length, the bruised reed, and crushes 
the drooping spirit. 

" To avoid the chance of recognition, 
which I should have run, by landing in 
the neighbourhood of Woodston, it was 
requisite I should proceed by the way of 
the metropolis : here, seized with I know 
not what, of nameless dread, I lingered 
several days, making a wish to view the 
romantic environs a pretext, and so beau- 
tiful as they are, so interesting, they did 
furnish me to myself with an excuse. As 
I stood by the romantic waterfalls of my 
native land, as I roamed through its mossy 
glens, and wound up its picturesque moun- 
tains, how often did I wonder to myself 
at the perversion of taste that caused the 
abandonment of such scenes ! When at 
length I forced myself to commence my 
journey onward, for every minute was now 
adding to the repugnance I felt to the 
plan 1 had persisted in adopting, so capri- 
cious is the mind, when unsettled by any 
irritable feeling, there was nothing to di- 
vert the thoughts, or relieve the spirits; 



252 CONTRAST. 

the roads were silent and solitary â€” nature 
smiled â€” the hills were green â€” the vallies 
gay ; but man looked haggard and forlorn ; 
and from the human wretchedness, visible 
in every direction, it seemed as if plenty 
and comfort had forsaken the land, with 
the owners of the deserted mansions, that 
were seen decaying away, amidst neglected 
plantations, records of other days and bet- 
ter times ; and in a state of the deepest de- 
jection I reached my destination. The 
siglit of it was not adapted to lessen the 
gloomy impression, previously made, upon 
my mind. The season, though elsewhere 
advanced, in this bleak spot was yet hardly 
visible, and to the nakedness of winter, 
was now added the dreariness of a cold 
wet evening. 

" I looked towards the range of hills 
that, tinged by distance with cerulean 
hues, had so often been my contemplation, 
from the embowered windows of my 
chamber at Woodston; but they were 
veiled in mist, and all seemed changed. 
But still what was the effect produced 
upon me by the sadness of external ob- 
jects, compared to that wrought upon my 



CONTRAST. 253 

feelings by the loneliness of all within ? 
I wished to escape from all who knew me ; 
yet when I looked round me, without 
meeting an eye, beaming with the gladness 
of recognition on me, in the place I was 
to call my home â€” without hearing any 
voice familiar to my ear greeting me with 
welcome, my dismayed soul sunk under 
my evident desolation; and in a paroxysm 
of anguish, waving my wondering attend- 
ant from me, I threw myself upon a seat 
and wept bitterly. â€” * Why was I reserved 
for this?' I dared to demand, ' or since 
destined to be thus forlorn, why endued 
with feelings to render the circumstance 
such a source of suffering? Oh! why,' 
I sighed, ' did I not share the early grave 
of my mother ? â€” why, on her cold bosom, 
was not my infant head laid in repose ? â€” 
why, like a tender blossom, did I not ex- 
hale away, ere the clouds gathered and the 
storms arose that have burst upon me? 
But could it be I was really so forsaken a 
creature ?' and I rose, and traversed the 
apartment, to try if I were not under the 
influence of some distressing dream, which 
exertion would enable me to shake off; 



254 CONTRAST. 

but the wind still continued to moan in 
my ears, and still a waste of waters was 
before my eyes. 

" For several days I continued in a 
state bordering on despair : the weather 
remained the same as on my arrival, and 
this added to the natural dreariness of the 
place, that with its sterile fields, its birds 
of portentous cry, and wild waves, tum- 
bling over one another to the rocky shore, 
as if in eager quest of something to engulf, 
rendered it one well calculated to chill the 
liveliest feelings. At length I became 
ashamed of the weakness to which I had 
yielded ; for in such a light did I consider 
the gloom I had allowed to overpower me. 
â€” * Whither,' I demanded of myself, 
* could I now go, that I should not find 
myself equally lonely, and be accompanied 
by regrets, that must cloud the brightest 
scene?' and I tried to rally myself; the 
clearing up of the weather, aiding my 
efforts for the purpose, enabling me as it 
did to stray abroad. In my solitary ram- 
bles about the cliffs and lonely fields, I 
made acquaintance with the little cabin 
children, that came peeping out at me from 



CONTRAST. 255 

the wretched hovels, by entering which I 
should have been cured of discontent, had 
I experienced it ; but it was not discon- 
tent I experienced â€” it was grief; it was 
regret for disappointed hopes â€” for mis- 
placed confidence; since I felt satisfied, 
that if assured of being still an object of 
interest to those I regarded, I should little 
have heeded the privations to which trea- 
chery had doomed me. 

"A letter from Mr.Trueman, at length, 
completely roused me: with what trem- 
bling impatience did I tear it open, under 
the faint hope of its containing some in- 
quiry. But, no; it was entirely about 
business ; and in the bitter disappointment 
of the moment, in the renewed irritation 
of an indignant spirit, I vowed within 
myself, since so utterly forgotten, to for- 
get. â€” 'But how absurd,' I exclaimed, after 
all that occurred, * to have indulged an 
expectation of being thought of! in the 
enjoyment of his restored fortune, Mount- 
florence thinks not of me â€” neither lady 
Rossglen, in her anxiety for the brilliant 
establishment of her daughters ! But this 
forgetfulness cannot always last ; there will 



9,56 CONTRAST. 

yet be compunctious visi tings of nature t 
and then I shall be avenged â€” then, when 
in vain I am sought â€” in vain it is inquired 
what has become of me !' and I exulted in 
the thought â€” yes, what will you say, 
when I tell you, I exulted in the thought 
of being a source of unavailing remorse to 
you and yours ? But better feehngs would 
sometimes prevail: my father was often 
thought of; and whenever he occupied 
my recollection, resentment seemed to 
die away, and, softened and subdued, I 
could only weep, and not exclaim, at the 
unkindness I had met with. 

" I had been a few weeks the inmate of 
my new abode, when, one night, as I was 
reading in the parlour, I was startled by a 
scream from my servant, and hastening to 
the hall, found her stretched at the foot of 
the staircase, in a fit. On recovering, she 
protested she had seen a human face peep- 
ing out at her from an apartment at the 
head of the stairs, long used as a lumber- 
room, and which, from the circumstance 
of the door being always kept locked, she 
was convinced must be one of the ghosts 
that she was assured troubled the house. 



CONTRAST. 257 

Of course, if she had seen any thing, I 
was aware it must be something more to 
be dreaded than a ghost, and accordingly, 
had the apartment examined ; but nothing 
was discovered to create alarm ; and the 
assertion of poor Margaret, therefore, was 
placed, by me at least, to the account of 
imagination. 

" But she was not mistaken in what she 
averred, as, in the end, was proved, there 
being secret means of ingress to this apart- 
ment, as well as to several others in the 
house, of which the basest advantage was 
taken. Shortly after this incident, I ob- 
served a man, muffled up in a boat cloak, 
so as to prevent a glimpse of his face, loi- 
tering every evening, at dusk, about the 
place. At first, I but slightly noticed 
him ; but when, every evening, about the 
same time, I continued to see him, a de- 
gree of curiosity was excited, that made 
me, at length, regard him more atten- 
tively, and suddenly I fancied, in his tall, 
majestic figure, I recognised yours. 

" What a wild idea !' you will exclaim ; 
but what is there which a romantic or 
ardent imagination is not capable of con- 



258 CONTRAST. 

ceiving? and what, after all, was there 
so improbable in it? You had confessed 
you loved me ; and love, not so easily- 
conquered, as in moments of resentment 
we are sometimes led to imagine, had, at 
length, led you to seek after me. But 
why then not at once avow yourself? But, 
no, there might be a reason for not exactly 
deciding on this : you might first wish to 
reconnoitre; or, from incertitude how, 
after what had occurred in London, I 
might receive you, feel anxious to give to 
our first meeting, at least the appearance 
of chance; in short, I was ingenious in 
accounting for every thing, in a way that 
might prevent any doubt of what I wished 
to believe. 

" The evening following this supposed 
discovery, I allowed myself to be seen, 
but no advantage was taken of the cir- 
cumstance ; and confirmed by this in my 
previous supposition, of your being deter- 
mined to be indebted to seeming chance 
for a meeting, I resolved on throwing 
myself, without further delay, in your 
way. My conclusion was, that you had 
taken up your abode in the neighbour- 



CONTRAST. 0,59 

hood ; and accordingly, the next morning, 
I sallied out, in expectation of shortly en- 
countering you, not doubting, from the 
persuasion I had yielded to, your being 
continually on the watch for me. I pro- 
ceeded along the cliffs, the direction in 
which I had always seen you come â€” you, 
1 persist in saying, because it was under 
the conviction of your being the person 
who had attracted my attention, that I 
acted as I did. I soon lost sight of home, 
and gradually found myself advancing in a 
road infinitely more wild and dreary than 
any previously explored, the sea dashing 
up its boisterous waves at one side, and at 
the other, high beetling cliffs, rent into 
frightful fissures, and dank with weeds 
and slime. I at length began to pause, 
and feel timid of venturing any further by 
myself, in such a direction ; but the hope, 
or idea, that by proceeding a little further, 
I might meet you, overcame my reluc- 
tance to go on, more especially conceiving 
it not improbable, from knowing of no 
other place in the savage spot where you 
could obtain shelter, that you might have 



260 CONTRAST. 

taken up your abode in the old building 
at the Pirates' Cave. 

" Step by step I proceeded, until I 
suddenly found myself before this terrible- 
looking place. The wild desolation amidst 
which it stood, the dark cavities over 
which it extended, the bewildering intri- 
cacies formed by the rocks, that here and 
there, in detached masses, seemed driven 
out into the sea, as if to brave and oppose 
the dashing waves, composed altogether 
such a scene, as, filling me with awe and 
terror, caused me involuntarily to recede. 
In turning to retrace my steps, chancing 
to cast my eye back on the building, I 
beheld two men, of ruffianly appearance, 
earnestly regarding me from within one 
of the gloomy excavations beneath it. 
All the imprudence of which I had been 
guilty, in venturing so far by myself, now 
struck at once upon my affrighted imagi^ 
nation, and I tried to hurry on ; but when 
I reflected on the length of way I had to 
go before I could catch even a glimpse of 
a cabin, I was ready to abandon myself to 
the terror that had taken possession of me. 

" At length, on finding footsteps fast 



CONTRAST. 261 

gaining upon mine, I lost all further com- 
mand over myself; and reeling in sicken- 
ing apprehension to the edge of the cliff, 
should have fallen down it, but for my 
arm being suddenly seized. For a minute 
I lost the power of perception ; on regain- 
ing it, I raised my head from the bosom 
on which it reclined, to see who it was 
that had saved me from destruction, and 
still muffled up in the boat-cloak that had 
hitherto prevented my discovering him, 
beheld sir Osbert Henley ! Oh ! the bit- 
ter disappointment of that moment, to 
find that it was to him, instead of you, 
that I was indebted for my preservationâ€” 
that it was him whom, of all created be- 
ings, I held most in abhorrence, I had so 
anxiously watched, and incurred such dan- 
ger in seeking. Starting from him, as 
from the coil of a serpent, and almost dash- 
ing him from me, as he attempted to re- 
grasp my hand, I hurried on. 

* I feared this,' he said ; but in an ac- 
cent more of sorrow than of anger, as he 
slowly followed; ' I would deprecate your 
displeasure,' he added, ' but that I perceive 
the effort would be now useless; but if 



262 CONTEAST. 

through no feeling for me, at least on your 
own account, do not oppose my attend- 
ance, for this savage place is not one for 
you to wander about in by yourself.' 

" I deigned no reply, and should have 
parted from him in contemptuous silence, 
but for the sudden suggestion, just as I 
came within sight of home, of the expe- 
diency of preventing his further hovering 
about my abode. â€” ' I did not think,' I said, 
suddenly pausing, * that any circumstance 
could have induced my holding commu- 
nication again with you for a moment ; 
but the further injuries I dread, from your 
pi-esumptuous intrusion on me, have com- 
pelled me : you can have no proper mo- 
tive for continuing in this place; should 
you persist, I shall immediately take the 
requisite measures for averting the mis- 
chief intended, I am convinced, by the 
circumstance.' 

" For a moment he cast his eyes down- 
ward, as if too much affected to speak ; 
then, in a subdued tone â€” * In what a light,' 
he exclaimed, * must I be viewed by you, 
to be thought capable of being actuated 
by any wish to your prejudice! yet when 



CONTRAST. 263 

I review circumstances â€” when I consider 
the way in which I have been misinter- 
preted, and maligned to you, I can hardly 
wonder at the accusation. I am indeed 
quite as much the victim of perfidy as 
yourself; nay more, for time will restore 
to you what you have been deprived of; 
but to me, never, never ! what the crud- 
est treachery has robbed me of, the esteem 
of her whom my soul adored !' 

" I smiled contemptuously â€” ' The sea- 
son of credulity is past,' I said ; * with such 
proofs of baseness as I have had, you must 
suppose me the weakest of the weak, if I 
could admit its denial !' 

* But by whom were those proofs ad- 
vanced?' demanded sir Osbert, with a 
little more warmth than he had yet ven- 
tured to betray; * by those who have 
given such proofs of inherent baseness in 
their own nature, as certainly to have ren- 
dered caution necessary in crediting them ; 
but we readily believe evil of those against 
whom we are previously prejudiced.' 

* Arguments on the subject are a waste 
of time,' was my reply. * To revert to the 
one demanding attention, what is your 



264 CONTRAST. 

object,' I asked, ' for insulting me, as I 
consider it, by intruding on me here ?' 

' Simply,' he answered, ' to try and ob- 
tain an opportunity for vindicating myself 
in your opinion : but do not turn from me 
with that look of scorn ; your frown I can 
better endure than that expression of con- 
tempt â€” ' yes, to try and obtain the power, 
I repeat, of retrieving myself in your eyes 
â€” of proving that I was incapable of acting 
the disgraceful part of which I have been 
accused : but I now see to what little pur- 
pose I should have made the attempt' 

" I paused for a few minutes â€” * No,' I 
then replied, ' there is one way by which 
I might be induced to hearken to you ; 
restore to me the letters I unfortunately 
allowed to remain in your possession ; or 
if not in your power to do this, prove to 
me, in a manner not to be doubted, how 
they have been disposed of, and I will 
then, but not till then, give you sufficient 
credit for sincerity, to be induced to listen 
to the vindication you express such an 
anxiety to offer.' 

' I take you at your word,' he said. 
* Your letters disposed of!' he cried ; * what 



CONTRAST. 265 

could have tempted me to part with, or de- 
stroy themâ€” what now to give them up, but 
the condition annexed to the circumstance, 
records as they are, of the only days I wish 
to remember? if I live until to-morrow, 
you shall have them.' 

* Then here, at this hour, I will meet 
you, for the purpose of receiving them,' I 
said, hurrying away as I spoke, to give 
vent to the bitterest feelings I had yet ex- 
perienced. Oh ! after thinking it was 
you who had followed me to this desert 
spot â€” you who had interposed between 
me and destruction, to find myself in 
error ! ' But what folly !' I exclaimed to 
myself, * after what occurred, to indulge 
such an idea ! After his silence to my 
letter, his studied avoidance of me, to im- 
agine it was Mountflorence sought me 
here ! oh no ! if a thought be ever now be- 
stowed on me, it will not be amidst the 
brilliant scenes of London, or perhaps the 
bridal festivities of his happy sisters !' 

" 1 wept bitterly : that chilling sense of 
forlornness that had been so overwhelming 
again returned, to sink me to the earth :

but I am dwelling on my feelings, when 
perhaps, in indignant anticipation of what 
this is intended to communicate, it is al- 
ready cast aside â€” but no; I will believe 
that justice, as well as benevolence, will 
still guide you, and that ere you discard, 
you will inform yourself why. 

" My abhorrence of sir Osbert unabated, 
what could have induced me to keep my 
appointment with him, but the hope that 
induced me to make it ? But the next day 
was one that totally precluded my going 
out, the rain pouring in torrents, and the 
wind blowing a hurricane; and I was sit- 
ting disconsolately at a window, looking 
vacantly at the waves dashing up their 
spray against the rocks, when I beheld sir 
Osbert approaching. My immediate im- 
pulse was to deny him admission ; but 
when I reflected on the disappointment 
to which this might subject me about my 
letters, I checked myself from yielding to 
it. He appeared before me with an air 
all humble and dejected, and taking the 
promised packet from his bosom, pressed 
it to his lips, and, with a deep sigh, re- 
signed it to me, saying his wush to oblige 



CONTRAST. 267 

me must be his excuse for his intrusion. 

" Having satisfied myself that the enve- 
lope contained all the letters I required, I 
intimated to him, as I put the packet aside, 
that if really anxious to address himself to 
me, he must, without delay, as I had but 
a few minutes to spare to him. 

* Be assured,' he replied, * I am but 
too well convinced of my presence being 
unwelcome, not to wish to take up as 
little of your time as possible; yet now 
that the opportunity so ardently sought 
for is obtained, I hardly know how to pro- 
fit by it, so great is my agitation, and so 
despairing am I besides of any thing I can 
advance in the way of justification being 
attended to. It has been observed, that 
where there is a consciousness of truth, 
there should be no hesitation ; but this is 
an observation, I conceive, that can apply 
to those only who are sensible they are ad- 
dressing themselves to an unprejudiced 
judge. This, unfortunately for me, is not 
my case : the greatest pains, I know, have 
been taken to poison your mind against 
me; and a variety of untoward circum- 
N 2 



268 CONTRAST. 

stances have conspired to render the efforts 
for the purpose but too successful: but 
not to render you impatient â€” you have 
not been a greater dupe to Bridgemore 
than I have. Like you, the confidence 
reposed in him by others led also to my 
reposing unlimited confidence in him : as 
the agent of my father, I conceived him 
worthy of being trusted; subsequent 
events have convinced me of the fallacy of 
this belief; in every way possible, my con- 
fidence in his integrity has been abused, 
for the purpose, as has been since ascer- 
tained, of drawing me into an alliance 
with his family ; and surely, if any thing 
but my rank in life were wanting to ac- 
quit me of the disgraceful meanness of 
which he accuses me, my indignant rejec- 
tion of this proposed alliance would be 
sufficient for the purpose: but he is not the 
only person I have to accuse of injuring me 
in your estimation : I have not now to 
learn, that to major Mountflorence I am 
indebted for your breaking with me. Nay, 
do not start away â€” I must be heard : the 
injured have a right to complain â€” the 
wronged to insist on justice. To his mis- 



CONTRAST. 269 

representations â€” yes, I assert, his misre- 
presentationsâ€” I owe all the misery I have 
endured ; for had his allegations been just, 
would he have hesitated to confront me in 
your presence? but no, that would have 
enabled me to disprove them, and thus 
the revenge he sought would have been 
disappointed. In short, justice to myself 
compels me to be explicit. His cousin. 
Miss Adelaide Mountflorence, thought 
proper to distinguish me by a preference, 
when or where it matters not to say, which 
not seeming to understand, induced her to 
address me a letter, inviting me to follow 
her, from the place where we had met, into 
Devonshire, and which act of imprudence 
becoming known to her family, engendered 
a hatred in their minds against me, from 
having, as they conceived, her honour in 
some degree at my mercy, that rendered 
them eager, major Mountflorence in par- 
ticular, to do me all possible injury.* 

" I could no longer command myself 
* Had I conceived,' I exclaimed, * that it was 
for the purpose of trying to lessen others 
in my estimation you sought this inter- 
view, be assured you never should have 



270 CONTRAST. 

obtained it. I have now only to add, that 
I wish myself alone.* 

' Excuse me for remaining another in- 
stant after this intimation,' he replied, 
proudly ; * but what is due to myself 
compels me. Although my assertions are 
denied credit, perhaps this,' unfolding a 
letter and laying it before me, *will obtain 
me some belief; for I presume Miss Ross- 
glen to be acquainted with the writing of 
Miss Mountflorence.' 

" Involuntarily I glanced at it, and saw 
it actually was the writing of Adelaide* 
I took it up, and found it contained the 
invitation he had mentioned : but could I, 
thinking of her as I did, believe even this 
testimony against her ? and I read and re- 
read it, in hopes of discovering it a fabri- 
cation. 

' I perceive,' cried sir Osbert, resentfully, 
after watching me some minutes in silence, 
' your misgiving doubt ; but see the wide 
difference,' he rather tauntingly added, 
* between wishing to believe and not to 
believe. How readily do we yield credit 
to any thing to the prejudice of those we 
dislike ! but with what reluctance to those 



CONTRAST. 271 

we love ! Here is evidence in her own 
hand-writing against Miss Mountflorence, 
and yet you linger in suspense as to what 
to decide ; because, to condemn her, must 
compel you to think less injuriously of 
him whom you hate and despise, him 
whom a mere vague unsupported charge 
was sufficient to ruin with you ; and 
can I forgive him to whom I owe this? 
no, never, never ! Had it been through 
any other motive than cool deliberate ma- 
lice â€” had it been,' and he looked search- 
ingly at me, * for the sake of possessing 
you himself, I could perhaps have found 
some excuse for his conduct ; but to tra- 
duce me, merely from implacable malice, 
without being goaded on by any other 
motive than inveterate dislike, as his ap- 
proaching nuptials with the beautiful 
friend of his aunt, lady Bellair, clearly 
proves, is what I cannot pardon. To put 
an end, however, to all doubts on the 
subject of the letter, I refer you to the 
lady herself respecting it.' 

" I could not immediately reply ; for a 
moment there was a hollow murmuring in 
my ears, and every thing seemed to swim 



272 CONTRAST. 

round me : a little recovering, I then beg- 
ged him to retire. 

' Immediately,' was the answer ; * yet 
before I obey your impatient wish for my 
departure,' and he affected to sigh, ' allow 
me to solicit your attention another mi- 
nute. I am not presumptuous enough to 
inquire your reasons for coming to this 
savage spot ; but whatever they may be, 
I trust they are not of a nature to induce 
your long continuance in it, at least with- 
out better protection than you now have, 
for you know not the dangers to which it 
will else subject you, infested as is this 
part of the coast, by a set of lawless de- 
predators, capable of any atrocity : promise 
me but this, that if your stay be pro- 
longed, you will have recourse to proper 
precautions for your safety ; and whatever 
may be my feelings at leaving the place, 
I still shall not be utterly miserable.' 

" I was just, at that instant,, in that dis- 
consolate state, that renders the slightest 
indication of interest sufficient to over- 
come; tears gushed from me; unwilling 
to have them noticed, from the cause to 
which I was aware they would be impu- 



CONTRAST. 273 

ted, I impatiently motioned him away, as 
I averted my head from him. He saw the 
conflict that was rending my heart, and 
withdrew, exulting, no doubt, at the mi- 
sery he had occasioned. 

" To what a whirl of contending feel- 
ings did he leave me ! Mountflorence, 
devoted, about being married to another ! 
and what was there in life worth living 
for? Still pride made me try to resist 
the anguish inflicted by the intimation. 
Had I not already, I asked myself, be- 
lieved an eternal separation effected be- 
tween us? but no, no â€” what I now en- 
dured convinced me to the contrary â€” con- 
vinced me, that, unconsciously, hope had 
lingered in my heart; but it was now rent 
away for ever, and like a shipwrecked 
wretch upon a desert coast, I stood in the 
midst of desolation, without the prospect 
of any outstretched hand to lead me to a 
happier spot. Oh! the pang attendant 
on the thought, that at the very moment 
I imagined Mountflorence to have quitted 
the gaieties of London for my sake, he 
was then, even then, probably breathing 
N 3 



274 CONTRAST. 

VOWS of tenderness into the ear of another, 
forgetful even of my very existence! â€” 
' And wa^ I then,' I asked myself, * utter- 
ly cast off by all whom I knew? by all 
whom I regarded? by all who had sur- 
rounded me in the gay season of prospe- 
rity ? Was he, to whom I had given such 
bitter cause of complaint â€” he whom I had 
treated with such scorn and contempt, 
the only being now to follow my lonely 
footsteps to the dreary solitude to which 
treachery had driven me? but ought I to 
give him credit for a disinterested feeling? 
Yet what motive could he now have for 
deceiving me, stripped as I was of for- 
tune? besides, by whom had I been taught 
to doubt his sincerity â€” by him, whose 
own, as far as I was concerned, I had 
every reason to think lightly of, from sub- 
sequent events. The letter of Adelaide 
was to me an incontrovertible proof of 
your having wronged him by your asser- 
tions ; and equally, I now felt persuaded, I 
had injured him by my suspicions of his 
being in collusion with Bridgemore, from 
the circumstance of his rejecting an alli- 
ance with him; and for the injustice I had 



CONTRAST. 275 

done him, was I not bound in honour, in 
feeling, to make him some reparation? 
and what could more sting the proud 
heart, that had tried to injure him with 
me â€” what more revenge the unkindness 
that I had experienced from Mountflo- 
rence, as well as the rest of his family, 
than the contempt I should evince for his 
advice, by giving my hand to him he had 
warned me to avoid ? but I shrunk with 
inward horror at the thought, and doubt- 
ful of myself â€” fearful of what the goad- 
ings of resentment, the changes in ray 
feelings might effect, I decided on admit- 
ting sir Osbert no more. 

" Two days elapsed without my seeing 
him, although he called. On the third, 
I was disturbed by an unusual bustle 
in the house; rising hastily to ascertain 
the cause, to my extreme consternation I 
found it had been entered the preceding 
night, and every article of value carried 
off, including a desk, containing almost 
all the money I was then mistress of, and 
the packet of letters returned by sir Os- 
bert. Nothing could be more embarrass- 
ing than the predicament in which this 



276 CONTRAST. 

placed me ; reducing me, as it did, to the 
distressing alternative of either applying 
to Mr. Trueman, for an advance out of 
his own pocket, or else of wanting actual 
necessaries. Of course this, on account of 
others, I could not think of subjecting 
myself to, and I accordingly sat down im- 
mediately, to acquaint him with what had 
happened. 

" I had just finished my application, 
when sir Osbert entered. â€” ' Forgive this 
intrusion,' he said ; ' but in wandering 
over the cliffs this morning, I found 
this,' producing, as he spoke, an India 
shawl ; ' and conceiving you might by 
this time have discovered your loss, I has- 
tened to restore it.' 

" I did not lose it in the way he appre- 
hended, I replied; and proceeded to in- 
form him of the occurrence of the night. 
He expressed himself greatly shocked, 
from the danger he conceived I had been 
in, adding his hope, that after this I would 
not much longer remain in such a place. 

" How completely did he deceive me ? 
What could I infer from this manner of 
expressing himself, but that he was sin- 



CONTRAST. 277 

cere ; naturally concluding, that, if influ- 
enced by any sinister view, he would not 
have been thus anxious for my removal 
from a place where he could so much bet- 
ter carry on any plot against me, than else- 
where ? alas ! little surmising the deep 
one he had laid! The arguments that 
suggested themselves for him, decided me 
more firmly than ever on avoiding any 
further intercourse with him. In pursu- 
ance of my request to be alone, he was 
taking leave, when, as if yielding to a sud- 
den impulse, he threw himself at my feet ; 
and â€” ' Forgive this determination,' he 
said, ' but, be you offended or not, after 
what has occurred, nothing shall induce 
me to quit this savage spot, while you 
continue its inmate/ 

" Coldly thanking him for the solici- 
tude manifested for my safety â€” * I could 
not see what advantage,' I added, * I could 
derive from his remaining, where he lodged 
being such a distance from my residence.' 

' Such a distance !' he repeated, starting 
on his feet. 

' Yes ; the Pirates' Cove was a great 
way,' I replied, â€¢ from where I lived.' 



278 CONTRAST, 

Â« He started.â€”^ The Pirates' Cove !' he 
cried, again repeating my words. ' And 
who pray informed you, may I ask, that I 
had taken up my quarters there ?' 

* No one,' I answered ; * I only surmised 
it, from knowing no other place in the 
neighbourhood where he could be accom- 
modated.' 

' Oh no,' said the dissembler, affecting 
to laugh, ' I may be acquainted with the 
dismals, but horrors are not yet grown 
familiar to me; and except they were, I 
should hardly think of seeking shelter in 
such a place.' ^ 

" For the first time I now demanded of 
him, whether he knew aught of Bridge- 
more. 

' No,' was the reply ; â€¢ but would that I 
did,' he added, * that I might drag him 
forth, to do me that justice, I fear, I have 
in vain essayed to do myself But no 
doubt he is by this time far beyond my 
reach. Yet, could he ever atone for the 
injur}'^ that his misrepresentations, in con- 
junction with those of others, have done 
me ! through them I find my hopes de- 
stroyed, and a wandering solitary life 



CONTRAST. 279 

probably my lot for ever ; for how can I 
endure the idea of settling, where the hap- 
piness I once looked forward to can now 
never be mine ?' and, apparently overcome 
by emotion, he seemed on the point of 
departing, when, as if suddenly recollect- 
ing himself, he entreated to be allowed to 
ascertain the way in which the robbers of 
the preceding night had got in, that he 
might see what precautions were requisite 
for my safety. The morning was con- 
sumed in his pretended examination of the 
house; and when at dinner-time I saw 
him departing, how could I avoid giving 
him an invitation, after all the trouble he 
had been incurring on my account ? Yet 
hardly had I given it, ere I repented, from 
the misconstruction I conceived the cir- 
cumstance was liable to ; but not a word 
or look occurred that could displease ; but 
he was too artful not to be aware of the 
injury he might do himself, by attempting 
to take any hasty advantage of my appa- 
rent relenting in his favour. But when 
he was gone, and I thought of the way in 
which the few last hours had been passed, 
in company with a person whom I had 



280 CONTRAST. 

been instructed to shun, who had been 
such a source of misery to me, and whom 
I had decided against ever holding further 
converse with, surprise, not unmingled 
with terror, pervaded my mind ; and I de- 
manded of myself whether I was not infa- 
tuated, under the influence of some fatality 
that was urging me onward again into the 
toils I had so despaired of ever extricating 
myself from? Yet, if undeservingof the pre- 
judice excited against him, why should I 
wish to cherish it ? but in wild affright, I 
recoiled at the idea of again permitting 
myself to argue in his favour, and again 
decided on seeing him no more. But this 
was a vain resolve, in such a place. I tran- 
quillized my mind however by my determi- 
nation of quitting it, the moment the ex- 
pected remittance from Mr. Trueman ar- 
rived: but my letter to him was inter- 
cepted, I need not say by whom, and a 
fabricated answer returned, containing a 
cold denial to my request. What was my 
disappointment, dooming me as it did, to 
remain not merely in a place I was now 
urged by so many circumstances to quit 



CONTRAST. 281 

>'ithoiit delay, but also under the greatest 
privations. 

" Abandoned to despair, at finding my- 
self thus destined, as it seemed, to be dis- 
appointed wherever I placed confidence, I 
heeded not the approach of sir Osbert, and 
attempted to retreat on being surprised by 
him : but opposing the attempt, he im- 
plored I would prove to him, his not being 
an object of absolute abhorrence, by letting 
him know whether there was any way in 
which he could remove the unhappiness I 
appeared labouring under? Gushing into 
tears, I broke from him. Why did he 
persecute me by this seeming interest, 
he whom I wished still to be compelled 
to abhor ? why intrude upon me in this 
cheerless hour, to force me to draw com- 
parisons calculated to make me think I 
was indeed unjust to him, in thus seek- 
ing to shun him ? 

" In the course of the day, a letter was 
received from him. He candidly con- 
fessed his perfect knowledge of the cruel 
embarrassments of my situation, and so- 
lemnly implored me, in justice to him, to 
let him be the means of extricating me 



282 CONTRAST. 

from them, by consenting to renew that 
engagement with him, that the perfidy of 
others had caused me to break ; assuring 
me, as I resolved, I would either restore 
him to happiness, or cause him, probably, 
to be a banished wretch for life, from coun- 
try and friends. 

" With something like a feeling of con- 
tempt, I threw aside this production ; but, 
urged by I know not what, except it was 
a secret fatality, I shortly took it up again. 
What struggles, what conflicts, did its 
second perusal cost me ! to hearken to 
him, and I need no longer remain in the 
solitude to which I had been so unfeelingly 
consigned ; but to unite myself to a person 
for whom I felt no preferable regard, on 
the contrary. But then, might not the 
sentiments once experienced be revived? 
and what could so effectually aid me in 
my efforts to overcome those I felt for 
another, those I was urged, by so many 
considerations, to conquer, as my accep- 
tance of this offer ? But vain would have 
been all these reasonings, futile all these 
arguments, but for the goadings of resent- 
ment: you disliked him, you had cau- 



CONTRAST. 283 

tioned me against him, and what could so 
effectually tend to prove I despised your 
advice â€” what -to sting the proud feelings 
of your heart, as my giving myself to 
him ? and I consented ! â€” yes, to be in 
some way revenged, to requite indiffer- 
ence with scorn, I consented to render 
myself a wretch ! 

" But I must pause : agitation at what 
you may now feel, at what you must 
think of me, overpowers me. I raise my 
head from the paper â€” the evening sun is 
mildly setting over the quiet fields: but a 
little while, and his last rays will have faded 
from the hill-tops ; but the moon will 
come forth, to supply his place, like the 
spirit of benevolence, to console for the 
lost splendours of departed prosperity. 
But not to impart tranquillity to my ach- 
ing breast will she diffuse her pale and 
mournful light, but to guide me hence. 
Never by her beams shall we stray together 
again in converse sweet, amongst those de- 
licious shades, listening to the night breeze 
sighing amidst the quivering foliage, and 
the deepened murmur of the falling floods. 
And must I then leave thee, my earthly 



284 CONTRAST. 

paradise ? But the serpent has entered to 
seize his prey, and another minute, and 
the hand of indignation itself would wave 
me hence. 

" In vain an ill-divining spirit would 
have prevented my hearkening to sir Os- 
bert : impelled by resentment, I lost sight 
of every other consideration ; but I was 

fated Yet, let me not express myself 

in this manner â€” it was I fated myself to 
misery, when I gave way to my wish of 
wounding the heart of another ! 

" On a gloomy morning â€” gloomy as 
the fate that awaited me, I allowed myself 
to be conducted to the old building at the 
Pirates' Cove, where sir Osbert made a 
plausible pretext for wishing our marriage 
solemnized. Every thing favoured the 
dissembler: my acquiescing in this wish, 
and his procuring the chaplain of a regi- 
ment quartered in the neighbourhood, 
with whom he was particularly intimate, 
to perform the ceremony, and who, with 
his wife, it was settled, should accompany 
us to England, immediately after its per- 
formance. 



CONTRAST. 285 

â€¢* I hardly entered ere it commenced : 
the little self-possession I had left remain- 
ing nearly forsook me at the moment, and 
I scarcely knew more of what passed until 
I heard myself pronounced the wife of sir 
Osbert. Oh, the sickening sensations of 
that moment ! overcome by them, I faint- 
ed away. On recovering, I found myself 
alone with him. Involuntarily I uplifted 
my eyes to his; but with what an ex- 
pression did I behold myself regarded â€” 
that of a fiend, exulting over the victim 
he had at length snared ! Shuddering, I 
closed them, and, oh, with what a fervent 
wish that they were never more to open ! 
But the period for dissembling was past. 
â€” * Come, come, my love,' he cried, rudely 
raising me from my reclining posture, 
* this is not exactly a time for the display 
of delicate sensibility; see,* turning my 
head in the direction of a window, * our 
friends are already in the boat, impatient, 
no doubt, for our joining them.* 

" Extricating myself from him, I stag- 
gered back to a chair, and, as if in search 
of some pitying countenance, casting my 
eyes round the apartment â€” * Where is my 



286 CONTRAST. 

maid ?' I faintly demanded ; ' you know 
you promised she should follow, and I 
cannot go without her.' 

* Indeed !' was the reply ; ' yet, for all 
that, my love,' in a taunting tone, * I be- 
lieve you must make an effort,' and as he 
spoke, he approached. 

" Seized with an indescribable terror, I 
started up, and was instinctively catching 
at the remnant of an old window-curtain, 
to prevent myself being forced away, when 
my hand became paralysed by the sight of 
some of the articles of which my residence 
had been plundered, lying on a table, 
placed there on purpose, no doubt, to 
make me feel his triumph over me com- 
plete. â€” * What do I see ?' I cried, with 
eyes rivetted. 

" Sir Osbert laughed. â€” ' Why, what 
must prove to you,' he said, ' that a pas- 
sionate lover recollects the old adage, that 
all is fair in love or war.' 

" I wrung my hands, in agony uncon- 
trolable. â€” * What have I done?' I despair- 
ingly exclaimed, raising my eyes to heaven. 

* Done !' he repeated â€” ' why, made me 
the happiest of men, by making me ruler 



CONTRAST. 287 

of the destiny of the proud, the scornful 
Helena Rossglen ! Yes, the scorned, the 
rejected sir Osbert, is now lord of the as- 
cendant, spite of the warning voice of the 
eloquent Mountflorence !' 

' Of my guardian angel !' I exclaimed ; 
' oh, had I attended to his warning voice, 
I should not be the wretch I now feel 
myself! But, monster! your triumph 
over me may not be as complete as you 
imagine : from what I have discovered, I 
have reason to doubt every thing; and, 
ere I yield to your authority, you shall 
first satisfy my friends that you have given 
yourself a legal right to exercise any over 
me.' 

' We shall see,' was the reply ; * yet 
would they were here to dare me to the 
proof! but no more trifling;' and as he 
spoke, he was about disengaging the cur- 
tain from my frantic grasp, when a cla- 
mour of voices was heard without the 
building : he paused â€” cast a glance from 
the window overlooking the road, then, 
with a muttered execration, snatching me 
up in his arms, rushed out through a door 
directly opening on the cliffs, and with 51 



288 CONTRAST. 

precipitation that endangered our lives, 
descended to the boat. Throwing me in- 
to, rather than placing me in it, he sprang 
in himself, and ordered the men to row 
out to sea, in a contrary direction from his 
yacht. 

" Soon after clearing the headland, a 
vessel was perceived in the offing, which, 
on being hailed, proved to be a trader 
bound for Cork : sir Osbert offered libe- 
rally to be taken on board with his party ; 
the offer was accepted, and the captain's 
birth resigned for the accommodation of 
the females. I alone, however, took pos- 
session of it. I need hardly say, I suppose, 
that the consternation of sir Osbert was 
occasioned by the alarm of conscious guilt, 
as he actually knew not, at the moment, 
of the escape of Bridgemore's unfortunate 
daughter. 

" Night came on, without any one ap- 
pearing to inquire after me : it was accom- 
panied by pitchy darkness and a rising 
storm ; the sails were reefed, and all the 
usual precautions taken to guard against 
the threatened danger. I was aware of all 
that was passing; but the anguish of my 



CONTRAST. 289 

soul rendered me unmoved by the thought 
of what might happen. Stretched upon a 
wretched pallet, I was hearkening to the 
wind,now rising to a hurricane,nowcoming 
with a moaning sound upon the ear, as if 
bewailing the mischief it was probably in- 
tended to do, when I was suddenly roused 
from a kind of stupefaction into which 1 had 
fallen, by a light glaring round me, and 
at the same moment the dreadful cry of 
* fire !' 

" But the instant before, I thought I 
should have welcomed death in any shape, 
but the instinct of nature now prevailing 
over every other feeling, I started up, and 
scrambled, I know not how, to the deck. 
What a scene there presented itself to 
iny view ! While 1 stood, petrified with 
horror, I felt myself suddenly caught 
up, and lowered into the boat, already 
filled with the crew, only waiting for my 
preserver, the captain, to row off from the 
burning wreck. As they pushed off, 
what were the shrieks, the yells of de- 
spair, of the doomed wretches left be- 
hind ! franticly I joined in their cries, foe

pity on them. While imploring this, sir 
Osbert was suddenly beheld amidst the 
burning shrouds ; and ere the involuntary 
shriek I uttered at beholding him had 
well escaped my lips, he was hurled over- 
board by the falling of a blazing mast. 

" I saw no more : on awaking to recol- 
lection, I perceived the dawn had broke, 
and that the boat was making for a little 
creek, at the head of which was a small 
village. Not without shuddering, I cast a 
glance over the watery waste behind me ; 
but all was over â€” the victims of one element 
were now engulphed in another. Not a ves- 
tige of the vessel remained : the cold grey 
sky had lost its lurid glare â€” the waves 
their fiery tinge ; and the cry of the sea- 
gulls, from their clefts in the ragged rock% 
was now the only one that met the ear, 
and priest, bridegroom, witness, all sunk 
in a watery grave : no lips but my own 
could reveal my hated marriage. 

" I know not how I got home from the 
little village to which I was borne. I 
expected to have found my little house- 
hold all consternation about me ; but sir 
Osbert had artfully taken care to prevent 



CONTRAST. 291 

any thing of the kind, doubtless lest of 
danger to himself from inquiries, till 
we had got away. A tale here awaited 
me, that thrilled me with horror â€” that 
rendered all I had just experienced slight, 
compared with the sensations it excited â€” 

my sensations at having been but I 

cannot command my hand to write the 
terrible word. 

" Several days passed in a state that 
baffles description : in vain I tried to calm 
my agitated soul, lest the wild disorder of 
my looks should occasion some dreaded 
surmise. With the thought of what I 
had been continually recurring to my 
affrighted imagination â€” the thought of 
what I should be, should the secret of 
my fatal marriage ever transpire, argu- 
ments, reasonings with myself, were un- 
avaihng to enable me to recover compo- 
sure ; should it ever be discovered, what 
would become of me ! whither should I 
fly ! where betake me, to avoid the shame, 
the obloquy, that must then for ever at- 
tach to my name ! but of this, I tried to 
persuade myself, to avoid distraction, 
o 2 



292 CONTRAST. 

there was no danger : the sea would not 
give up its dead, for the purpose of ren- 
dering me a wretch ; and within it rested 
all who could betray me to abhorrence. 

" At length, the arrival of Mr. True- 
man forced me to make more strenuous 
efforts to appear tranquil than I had 
yet done : he contrived to manage so, that 
my being an occupant of the place still 
remained a secret. With him I left this 
now-detested scene of so much suffering ; 
but oppressed by feelings â€” pursued by re- 
collections â€” haunted by images, that made 
me shrink, with a kind of dread, from ac- 
companying him back to the world, as he 
urged, believing the deep melancholy, or 
gloom visible in my looks and manner, to 
be the effect of solitude. But even though 
I had made up my mind as to my future 
plans, uninterrupted quiet was for a time 
indispensable, to allow^ me to recover 
my bewildered senses, or, in other words, 
shake off the dreadful impression made 
upon me by recent events. 

" Finding me again not to be persua- 
ded by his arguments, Mr. Trueman men- 
tioned a retired place, he thought would 



CONTRAST. 293 

-suit me, in Wales; the same in which 
you found me. Here, left to the repose 
I so much needed, screened from every 
curious eye, and removed from out the 
reach of all that could annoy or perplex 
me, the delicious quietude of the place 
had gradually something of a soothing ef- 
fect upon my mind. Here, allowed to 
* commune with my own heart, and be 
still,' I had leisure to consider whether it 
would be most advisable for me to return 
to that world, that could now only be as 
a great wilderness to me, or remain where 
the afflicting solitariness of my condition 
would not be so well known or felt as 
there ; for I now felt myself more isolated 
than ever, destitute as I now was of any 
one, as heretofore, to supply to me the 
place of those connections I believed es- 
tranged from me ; but while I wept at the 
idea of being so forlorn a creature, I still 
was aware there were many who would 
envy me, possessed as I again was of the 
power of gratifying each whim of capri- 
cious vanity or pride ; but ah ! I equally 
felt it must be those who either knew not 
feelings like mine, or else what it was to 



294 CONTRAST. 

stand aloof in the world, without a posi- 
tive claim on any one, for kindness or 
sympathy. 

" Bat how vain are human resolves ! 
when your mother, with maternal tender- 
ness, clasped me to her heart, and whis- 
pered that I had not been more deceived 
with regard to her than you, how did I 
sigh to find myself again amidst the domes- 
tic circle ! yet I had decided on remaining 
where I was, and I foresaw all the painful 
struggles to which I was probably subject- 
ing myself, by quitting retirement ; but 
spite of this vow and apprehension, I suffer- 
ed myself to be tempted from it. I tried, 
however, to hope that I should be able so 
to regulate my conduct, as to prevent any 
further idea of an alliance with me, with- 
out at the same time depriving myself of 
your regard as a friend : for while my very 
soul recoiled with horror at the thought of 
revealing the engagement I had formed^ 
I yet vowed never to give my hand with- 
out disclosing it ; and consequently sought 
to avert any overture or declaration, that 
might reduce me to the agonizing alter- 
native of either making the confession I 



CONTRAST. 295 

dreaded, or else of subjecting myself to 
the cruel imputation of want of sensibility. 
" Yet how could I entertain such a 
hope, feeling myself, as I did, agitated by 
your slightest attention? A short time 
proved how delusive it was ; on my deci- 
sion, I was told, yours depended: but 
your threat of going abroad I perhaps 
could have endured, but for the apprehen- 
sion of its proving but a prelude to the 
cessation of any further intercourse be- 
tween us. Hope at an end with regard 
to me, and what was there to oppose your 
turning your thoughts on another? and 
at the thought of becoming an object of 
cold indifference to you â€” of another en- 
grossing those attentions, those anxieties, 
that had been so dehghtful, I shrunk in 
agony. Yet to disclose what 1 sickened 
to think of, as I had solemnly resolved to 
do, should I ever contemplate a change 
of condition ! but what wrong, what in- 
jury should I do you, by departing from 
this resolve ? Yet could I have been as- 
sured that the confession would have oc- 
casioned no alteration in your sentiments, 
I might have prevailed on myself to make

it : but the dread of the light in which it 
might cause you to regard me! before that 
every scruple gave way, for I felt that 
without your love, to wish for existence 
would be impossible. 

" In violation of all I should have held 
sacred â€” of all I should have respected, I 
became yours, without revealing that the 
name of Rossglen was one I had no right 
to approach the altar by ; but I strove to 
flatter myself that no evil would result 
from the circumstance; that your happi- 
ness being now identified with mine, yours, 
so deserving of the peculiar care of Hea- 
ven, would be a means of securing me 
from suffering. Vain hope ! it is by let- 
ting the blow fall where we are most vul- 
nerable, that we meet with the punish- 
ment due to our errors : and what punish- 
ment can equal that which the tortured 
heart endures, at seeing the object of its 
devoted tenderness dragged into misery 
through its means ! 

" But though reflections could not be 
stifled, still there were moments in which 
I fancied tranquillity might be regained j 
but the peace, the repose, the smiling as- 



CONTRAST. 297 

pect of all around me, had a soothing ef- 
fect upon ray feelings, that led to the be- 
lief. Not long, however, was I allowed to 
indulge in this : how shall I proceed â€” how 
tell you, that from a waking day-dream 
of bliss I was roused, the other morning, 
by the sight, the actual sight, of the phan- 
tom of horror that had so often haunted 
my nightly couch ! 

" When reason had a little recovered 
from the dreadful shock sustained, I en- 
deavoured to take comfort, by believing 
my eyes must have deceived me, from 
recalling the inquiries I had caused to be 
made ere quitting the headland â€” inquiries 
that had all tended to induce a persuasion 
that there was nothing to be apprehended 
in unknown fate. 

" But I was not long permitted to cling 
to hope: a message received this morn- 
ing and now, even now, a monster 

waits within these tranquil shades, to force 
me hence! with blood-stained hands, to 
tear your shrieking Helena from your 
loved bosom, where she fondly hoped 
she should have found an earthly sanctu-

ary! but I anticipate his fell design â€” I 
hasten to where his malice cannot reach 
me. Ere this meets your eye, and I shall 
be where no reproaches, but those of my 
own heart, will assail me â€” where I shall 
feel no tears upon my cheek, but those 
with w^hich my own anguish has dewed it! 
" But how shall I give utterance to the 
farewell that must sever us for ever !â€” -How^ 
in what form of words, deprecate the re- 
sentment, the just indignation, that my 
abuse of that generous openness of nature, 
that gave me such ready credit for the vir-

the error, plead in extenuation of it? Oh 
no ! not to him, whose soul is the seat of 
rectitude : if a relenting feeling be expe- 
rienced, it can only be through the influ- 
ence of divine benevolence ! But lady 
Rossglen ! will she ever think with aught 
but abhorrence of the destroyer of her Si- 
gismund's happiness? But no, no! the 
interruption it has received will be but 
transient : ere long, and another will sup- 
ply the place of Helenaâ€” another will shed 
consolation for the sorrows she occasioned.

and efiface her idea. Oh, bitter thought ! 
not even to be allowed to hope she shall 
live in the memory of him her soul doats 
on ! But day declines ; the shades of even- 
ing begin to gather, and by this time per- 
haps, in a state of alarm at my not having 
made my appearance at lord Glena's, you 
may be meditating an immediate return : 
I must be gone then â€” another minute's 
delay, and what may not be the dreaded 
result !

beloved beyond language to express, fare- 
well, then, for ever, ever, in this world ! I 
tear myself from you, to avoid being torn 
by any other hand than that to which all 
must yield, need I say with what fervent 
prayers to Heaven for its choicest blessings 
to be ever showered upon you and yours !

could I indulge a hope, that I should ever 
again be thought of with tenderness, half 
its bitterness would be lost. But can I 
imagine that for her, so lately loved, the 
heart of Sigismund will alone prove itself 
unsusceptible of pity ? Oh no ! with in-

CHAP. XI. 

While writing the last sentence, Helena 
was disturbed by the clamorous application 
of her maid for admission : alarmed at 
her shutting herself up for so many hours, 
she had been before to the door in the 
course of the morning, and now returned 
with a determination of not being again 
sent away unsatisfied. Her unhappy 
lady perceiving, by her manner of ex- 
pressing herself, what her determination 
was, and fearful, if she longer dallied 
with her anxiety, of something unpleasant 
being the result, hastily folded up her 
letter, and putting it into her bosom, ad- 
mitted her. 

" Oh, ma'am, I have been so uneasy 
about you," cried the affectionate girl, al- 
most staggering into the room, through 



CONTRAST^ 301 

the agitation she was in, " lest you were 
unwell ! and so to be sure you are," she 
added, almost starting, as she cast her eyes 
upon the woe-fraught countenance of the 
wretched Helena ; " and there, after my 
laying out all your things for dressing, 
you'll not be able to go to my lord Glena's, 
I suppose ; and my poor master will be in 
such a taking !" 

" No, no, I am not so ill as that," said 
Helena, but with difficulty articulating; 
*' so go, my good girl â€” go, my kind Mar- 
garet," in a still lower and more subdued 
tone, she added, " to my dressing-room, to 
see that every thing is ready for me, and 
in a few minutes I will follow." 

" In a few minutes, ma'am ?" repeated 
Margaret, in a tone of evident doubt. 

" Yes, certainly ; so do as I have desired, 
that there may be no longer delay about 
my dressing." 

Margaret slowly obeyed her. The in- 
stant she was out of sight, Helena hasten- 
ed to depart ; she saw an alarm was created, 
that rendered it requisite there should be 
no longer delay in what she meditated. 
JJIuffling herself up, she knew notâ€” cared 



302 CONTRAST. 

not how, she stole from her chamber, and 
listening at every step she took, lest of 
being detected, passed outward without 
hindrance. She had no thought, no ob- 
ject, but to gain the shelter of one of the 
wild caves on the coast, and there lay her 
down and die. Onward she sped, through 
the loneliest and most intricate paths, re- 
gardless of briars and brambles, and moun- 
tain torrents, seized with an apprehension, 
from the rising frenzy of her brain, of a 
moment's pause â€” a moment's delay, occa- 
sioning the frustration of her plan of es- 
cape : pursuing her way in this headlong 
manner, her foot stumbled; as she was re- 
covering herself, she perceived that some- 
thing had fallen from her bosom ; stooping 
for it, she found it to be the letter address- 
ed to Mountflorence, which, in the hurry 
and confusion of flight, she had forgot 
having deposited there, when disturbed by 
Margaret. She shrieked, in wild dismay, 
at the discovery, for what might not be 
the fatal consequences of this forgetfulness ! 
Mountflorence, she was aware, had not 
heard unmoved of the arrival of prince 
Zamoski in the neighbourhood, and in 



CONTRAST. 303 

the rashness of awakened suspicion, on 
missing her, might turn to him for an ex- 
planation of the circumstance, that could 
not be demanded with impunity. She 
made a movement, to retrace her steps ; 
but shrunk back, with sudden horror, at 
the thought of thus incurring the risk of 
facing all she had sought to avoid by flight ; 
but the letter must be delivered â€” delivered 
without delay, or absolute distraction 
would ensue : but where was the faithful 
hand to be found to entrust it to ? 

As her eyes wandered round the solitary 
scene, as if in expectation of seeing some 
pitying being starting forward to aid her 
in this sad emergency, she bethought her 
of Adelaide, whose announced arrival but 
the day before at Rockcliffe had caused her 
such emotion ; and to her she instantly 
decided on repairing, for the purpose of 
imploring her to take charge of it. Yet 
how could she think of asking a favour of 
her, whom she had treated as she had 
treated Adelaide ? how of submitting to 
the humihation of such a circumstance? 
but she deserved it; and besides, what 
mattered it to her, who had done with 



804 CONTRAST. 

earth and earthly things, what humiliation 
she subjected herself to ? and she turned 
directly in the direction of the castle. The 
way was wild and solitary, but she was no 
longer capable of personal apprehension ; 
her fevered brain had no other thought 
than that of guarding her beloved from 
evil, and hiding herself from his just in- 
dignation. On she went, regardless of 
every thing â€” now so close to the sea as 
almost to be touched by the waves â€” then 
again through lonely fields, whence labour 
had long departed. At length, with a 
sinking frame, she reached the castle, a con- 
spicuous object, even at this dusky hour, 
from the moonshine that now rested on 
its ancient battlements, and the blaze of 
light that issued from the windows, indi- 
cative of the return of the family. Feebly 
she toiled up the rough ascent, and en- 
abled, by the massive folding doors of the 
hall being a little open, to reconnoitre, 
glided in, on perceiving no one, and pass- 
ing onward to the grand staircase, took 
refuge in the first apartment she came to, 
on ascending. This happened to be the 
drawing-rootn, already lit up for tea. Here, 



CONTRAST. 305 

as she stood listening for the approach of 
Adelaide, with her poor heart flutteringUke 
a frighted bird, and with glances of recollec- 
tion that added to the torture of the mi- 
nute, her eyes chancing to fall upon a large 
chimney -glass, near which she was stand- 
ing, she suddenly beheld Adelaide behind 
her, in an attitude of contemplation. 

With something like a cry of joyful 
surprise at beholding her thus suddenly, 
she turned ; but Adelaide had retreated, 
and in utter dismay, at believing her hav- 
ing done so was owing to the scorn and 
contempt in which she held her, from the 
recollection of her conduct to her, she 
sunk overpowered upon the floor. 

But in fancying what she did, she was 
mistaken; it was not Adelaide, but Ade- 
laide's counterfeit she beheld â€” the picture, 
in short, she so much resembled, of lord 
Le Poer's favourite sister, which, in conse- 
quence of the effect the sight of it always 
had upon him, his father had removed ta 
a niche or closet in the drawing-room, the 
door of which could only be opened by- 
pressing on a spring inserted near the fire-* 
place, when the panel turning out, disco^

vered the portrait that was hung against 
it, so admirably executed, that it might 
well be mistaken, at a little distance, or at 
least the uncertain light by which Helena 
beheld it, for a living person. 

While in a state of wild despair, that 
took from her all power of further exer- 
tion, the wretched Helena lay extended 
on the floor, Adelaide in reality approach- 
ed, singing to herself, in the joyous light- 
ness of her heart, as she entered the draw- 
ing-room ; but at the sight that here 
awaited her, she suddenly stopped, and 
starting back, was involuntarily retreating 
to the staircase, when Helena, slowly up 
lifting her head, rivetted her, through ab- 
solute astonishment, to the spot, by allow- 
ing her to ascertain who it was she beheld. 
Yet, could she believe her eyes ! could she 
really believe, that in the pale and hag- 
gard-looking object before her, it was He- 
lena â€” the so lately gay, and beautiful, 
and admired Helena â€” the observed of 
all observers, and supposed happy bride 
of Mountflorence, she beheld ! " Good 
God!" she exclaimed, " what does this 



CONTRAST. 307 

mean ? or is it really INIrs. Mountflorence 
that I see?" 

" Oh no, no!" cried Helena, in a voice 
of unutterable anguish, veiling her face 
with her hands, as she raised herself in a 
sitting attitude on the floor. 

" What does all this mean ? what has 
happened?" said the commiserating Ade- 
laide, kneeling down beside her, and pass- 
ing her arm round her waist ; " in pity 
relieve me from the terrible feelings you 
have excited !" 

*â€¢' You relent then," said Helena, turn- 
ing her eyes mournfully upon her, as her 
head sought the support her bosom afford- 
ed; " you have returned to tell me, that 
though you must continue to scorn, yet 
you can still pity ?" 

" I do not comprehend you," replied 
Adelaide; " until this moment, I knew 
not of your being here." 

" Ah ! do not attempt to deceive me," 
cried Helena ; " you were here a minute 
ago, and vanished on discovering who it 
was you saw." 

*' You are mistaken," said Adelaide, 
" but I think I can account how ;" and she 



308 CONTRAST. 

explained the circumstance of the picture: 
" thus, you see," she added, " you have 
unjustly accused me. But I did think," 
and there was a little indication of re- 
proach in her voice, " that you knew me 
too well, to imagine I would have acted 
unkindly towards any one, more especially 
one," and she tried to speak soothingly, 
and kissed her pallid cheek, " so deser- 
vedly dear to all who know herJ' 

" Oh ! no, no !" cried Helena, " and that 
is the pang that rends my heart â€” this the 
terrible conviction, that has rendered me 
an outcast, a wretched wanderer from my 
honne ! But I came not to complain, but 
to supplicate â€” I came to afford you the 
power of returning good for evil, by im- 
ploring you, despite of the cause for re- 
sentment I gave you, to grant me one 
favour. This letter," producing it from 
her bosom, " it is essential to have deli- 
vered, without delay ; but in vain I strove 
to bethink me of some other hand than 
yours to intrust it to : promise to take 
charge of it, and I will strive to rid you 
immediately of the sight of a person that 
I know must be unwelcome to you." 



CONTRAST. 309 

" How can you speak â€” how can you 
think in this manner?" said Adelaide, re- 
proachfully. " I never felt resentment; 
but, if I had, do you suppose it possible 
that, at such moment as this, I could have 
retained it? God forbid! No, my dear 
Mrs. Mountflorence, you know not how 
you have affected me: but is there no 
other way I can serve you, than by taking 
charge of your letter? Do be explicit, I 
implore, I beseech, for the sake of all par- 
ties!" But she was addressing herself to 
an ear no longer capable of hearing her 
soft persuasions. Inexpressibly alarmed 
on perceiving this, she gently withdrew 
her arm from the neck of the poor sufferer, 
and tenderly placing a cushion from one of 
the sofas under her head, repaired to the 
parlour, to communicate what had oc- 
curred. 

The surprise her communication occa- 
sioned, may easily be conceived. The 
conclusion of both gentlemen was, that 
some misunderstanding with Mountflo- 
rence had driven Helena to the rash step, 
which from her own confession she ap- 
peared to have taken ; and it was there- 



310 CONTRAST. 

fore their opinion, that there should not be 
a moment's delay in restoring her to her 
home. 

Nothing else but the conviction that it 
was essential to the honour of Helena that 
this suggestion should be acquiesced in, 
could have induced Adelaide to allow of 
her removal, from the dying state in which 
she appeared to her. The carriage was 
immediately ordered, in which lord Le 
Poer agreed to accompany her, to assist in 
taking charge of the unhappy sufferer ; 
while De Montville preceded them on 
horseback with the letter, to prepare 
Mountflorence for the state in which she 
was returning, and remove from his mind 
any injurious misgivings her flight might 
haply have occasioned. All this time 
Mountflorence was a prey to those anxious 
fears, that are the result of incertitude. 
Notwithstanding the confidence he as- 
sured himself he reposed in Helena, her 
altered manner, and that too just at the 
period of prince Zamoski's arrival in the 
neighbourhood, dwelt upon his mind, with 
a feeling of uneasiness he could not shake 
ofi*. The business which had compelled 



CONTRAST. 311 

his leaving her early this morning, was 
hastily got through, in the hope that he 
might find her at lord Glena's by the time 
he got there â€” a hope in which we need 
not say he was disappointed ; but it was 
not yet late â€” she was probably then on 
the road ; and he proceeded to dress, flatter- 
ing himself with hearing presently of her 
arrival. 

By the time he repaired to the drawing- 
room, every one expected was arrived but 
Helena : minute after minute sped with- 
out bringing her, and dinner was kept 
back on her account. At length the un- 
easiness of Mountflorence became so in- 
supportable, he could no longer command 
him&elf ; Helena must be ill, and he could 
not think of remaining. Unwilling to 
yield to this persuasion, lord and lady 
Glena entreated that a messenger might 
be first dispatched to ascertain this, ere he 
thought of departing; but he could not 
be prevailed on to hearken to a suggestion 
of the kind ; his soul was in torture, such 
as would not brook his remaining a mi- 
nute longer than was necessary, under the 
apprehensions he was enduring.

Lady Rossglen, finding him determined, 
insisted on accompanying him : he could 
not oppose her requestâ€” -he had no power 
to do so ; and they accordingly proceeded 
together in her carriage to the Abbey. 
The moment he alighted, he inquired for 
Helena ; but the domestics could give him 
no information concerning her â€” they had 
not seen her since morning. He flew up 
to her chamber; but she was not there â€” 
thence to her dressing-room, where he 
found Margaret, agreeably to the instri>c- 
tions she had received, putting every thing 
in order for her dressing. Her answers 
to his questions served to heighten the 
distraction he was in. In the house it 
was evident her lady was not, and he rush- 
ed from it to seek her abroad, though with 
a feeling that almost suspended the inten- 
tion. Instinctively he took the path to 
the Abbey, that delicious path winding 
through a wilderness of sweets, which they 
had so often traversed together â€” so de- 
lighted to wander in, at this cool, this si- 
lent hour, to enjoy the scented air, and 
listen to the mournful sound of falling 
waters; but all was now lost upon the: 



CONTRAST. 313 

unhappy Mountflorence. What was the 
dreadful trial that was approaching? yet 
perhaps there might be no cause for this 
agitation; but there was an ill-divining 
spirit within, that whispered otherwise, 
and he quickened his steps to the ruin, 
but again to be disappointed of finding 
her he sought ; " And how ridiculous, all 
things considered, to have imagined he 
should have found her here !" he said to 
himself, as he turned from it ; ** but where 
then was she?" and his brain maddened 
at the question. He was on the point of 
ordering his horse, with an intention that, 
perhaps, he would not have acknowledged 
to himself, of seeking prince Zamoski, 
when De Montville arrived. Hardly did 
he hear what he had to communicate, ere 
the letter was wrested from him ; his agi- 
tation was too great to permit a regular 
perusal of it ; eagerly his eye ran over it, 
in anxious quest of what it was essential 
to him to know : too soon was this under- 
stood ; he staggered under the dreadful 
blow, and, for a moment, was lost to all 
perception of his misery.

But was there no hope ? â€” might not all 
be a mistake â€” the result of an imagination, 
rendered liable to fear and self-imposition, 
from the apprehensions that lurked within 
her breast ? But how was this to be as- 
certained ? and there was madness in the 
thought of longer incertitude on the 
subject; but she might be able to give 
some clue by which inquiries might be 
made. The state however in which she 
was brought back, put an end to all 
hope of the kind ; and consigning her 
to the care of his afflicted mother, and 
the compassionating Adelaide, he decided 
on forthwith setting out, accompanied by 
De Montville, who indeed made it a point 
that he should not depart without him, in 
quest of the master of the vessel, on board 
which the dreadful catastrophe, described 
in her letter, had taken place, as the only 
probable means of learning what was to 
be believed. 

Prepared in any degree for her confes- 
sion, and there can be little doubt that 
indignation at the conduct of Helena 
would have had a powerful effect in pre- 
venting his sinking under the natural in- 



CONTRAST. 315 

tenseness of his feelings ; but at the mo- 
ment of resentment being awakened, pity- 
was also excited ; and in such a nature as 
his, it need hardly be said which was cal- 
culated to have the predominance. At 
the instant of discovering he was deceived, 
he also learnt she was dying, and in the 
apprehension of losing her, every thing 
was lost sight of, but the sufferings that 
had reduced her to the state that excited 
this fear. 

The person he set out in quest of was 
then wandering about the coast in search 
of employ, so that the inquiries after him 
were attended with a great deal of trouble 
and delay. In pursuing these, the friends 
chanced to pass through a little village, 
where their attention was attracted by a 
large assemblage of people : inquiring the 
cause, they were informed that the body 
of a man had just been taken out of a 
neighbouring river, and every one was 
anxious to have a view of it, in order to 
ascertain whether he was a connexion. 

Mountflorence felt a thrill through his 
nerves as he listened ; the feeling that urged 
p 2 



316 CONTRAST. 

him also to obtain a sight of the body was 
resistless. Dismounting, he entered the 
barn where it was laid, followed by De 
Montville; and with a hand rendered 
nervous by emotion, drew away the cloth 
that had just that instant been thrown 
over the face. 

What his feelings were, when, in the 
features thus revealed, he beheld those 
of the fell destroyer of his recent happi- 
ness, evidently wasted away, and hag- 
gard through famine and despair, may 
easier be conceived than described. He- 
lena then had not been mistaken, and 
no wonder that she had been driven to 
frenzy by the conviction ; but there was 
no further cause for apprehension; her 
tortured heart was relieved from the se- 
cret that had so oppressed it; and the 
snares of death had taken hold of him 
who had been a fiend of darkness in her 
path. How he oame by his fate, or what 
his motives were for seeking Helena, it 
mattered not to Mountflorence to conjec- 
ture; sufficient was it for him to know 
that he could no longer persecute. With 
a shuddering sensation he drew away from 



CONTRAST. 317 

the contemplation of the ghastly counte- 
nance, and taking the arm of De Mont- 
ville, withdrew. 

Some time elapsed ere he found himself 
sufficiently recovered from the effect pro- 
duced upon him, by the sudden revolution 
of feelings he had experienced, to remount 
his horse. 

There was now nothing to prevent his 
immediately turning homeward. As h^ 
proceeded, he tried to hope that all might 
be well again â€” that the dark and cloudy 
day that had so suddenly come upon him, 
might yet pass away, without any serious 
injury to his happiness; but when he 
thought of the state in which he had left 
Helena â€” when he reflected on what her 
feelings were, and at what, in consequence, 
he was aware she must endure, from the 
idea of the misery she had made him suffer, 
and her probable apprehension of the change 
her confession might have effected in his 
sentiments for her, he shuddered at the 
too great probability there appeared to 
him of finding this a fallacious hope ; and 
again there was a boding spirit, that took 
from him, at moments, almost all power of 



318 CONTRAST. 

maintaining any command over himself, 
through the agony it occasioned. 

The nearer he drew towards home, the 
more agitated he became; till at length 
he felt he had not courage to enter the house, 
without a previous inquiry there. 

De Montville accordingly consented to 
precede him. On their parting, Mount- 
florence gave his horse to one of the gate- 
keepers, and slowly advanced in the di- 
rection by which De Montville had pro- 
mised to return to him. More than once 
had he shrunk back, on coming unawares 
in sight of the house ; when he at length 
heard De Montville, he was starting for- 
ward to meet him, when he became sud- 
denly checked by the slow and lingering 
pace with which he saw him approaching. 
His heart turned cold, and staggering back 
against a tree, under the overwhelming 
presage of evil this excited, he was for a 
moment unable to hear what his pro- 
phetic heart told him he had to learn. 

Painful was the task delegated to De 
Montville, but he would have thought 
himself but little deserving of the name 
of friend, had he shrunk from it ; but ere 



CONTRAST. 319 

he had well made an effort to disclose the 
melancholy truth, Mountflorence, breaking 
from him, darted out of sight. Greatly a- 
larmed, De Montville pursued ; he attemp- 
ted to sooth â€” to remonstrate with him ; but 
with a sternness that proved he would not 
brook intrusion, he waved him away. 

Real grief cannot indeed bear even the 
restraint of an eye ; in its first paroxysms, 
even the voice of friendship itself is grat- 
ing to its ear ; for in the first deep inten- 
sity of its anguish, who, who can under- 
stand, or enter into its feelings, is the pas- 
sionate demand of the bereaved heart. 

Again bursting from his afflicted friend, 
Mountflorence plunged amidst the gloom 
of glimmering shades, where, unmolested, 
unannoyed by vain arguments, or attempts 
at consolation, he could give utterance to 
the anguish of his breaking heart. His 
senses felt stupified by the magnitude of 
the blow he had met with â€” a blow aggra- 
vated by being inflicted at the moment 
when he was suffering himself to hope he 
might be enabled to restore that peace to 
her wounded bosom, which had been so 
long a stranger to it. Could he believe 



320 CONTRAST. 

in the reality of what he had heard? 
Was he indeed a desolate bridegroom? 
Was he indeed already a widowed hus- 
band ? for the husband of his Helena he 
would ever style himself: -there was none 
to dispute his right to the title when she 
died, and to the grave she should bear his 
name with her. Was she, who but a few 
short weeks ago had given herself to his 
fond arms, in all the bloom of youthful 
beauty, was she already snatched from 
him ? already rendered incapable of ever 
more participating in his joys or sorrows ? 

What a feeling of desolation was the 
result of the reflection ! but in the disso- 
lution of this fond tie, he felt, at the mo- 
ment, as if every other was rent from him 
â€” as if he stood, a breathing creature, 
amidst utter silence and desertion. 

He moved on â€” he paused: whither 
should he betake him ? how could he face 
his home, despoiled as it was of all that 
had rendered it delightful? for what 
should he re-enter it ? not to receive the 
kiss of fond affection, the welcome of de- 
lighted tenderness ; but to gaze upon the 
dead â€” to listen, in vain, for the voice that 



CONTRAST. 321 

was music to his ear â€” to look, in vain, for 
the smile that was gladness to his heart : 
and not to be by, to receive her last sigh ! 
to whisper in her dying ear the assurance of 
his unaltered love, and forgiveness of all for 
which she claimed forgiveness! and he 
looked round him, in overwhelming wo, 
as if for the consolation, that, if offered, he 
would have derided. 

Every thing seemed in mournful sym- 
pathy with his feelings ; the trees rustled 
with a melancholy sound, in the night 
breeze, that swayed them to and fro, while 
the profound stillness of the hour deepen- 
ed even the murmur of the falling floods 
to solemnity. 

Again he moved onward â€” again he 
paused : it was beneath the shadow of the 
far-branching tree, where Helena and he 
had passed so many blissful hours â€” where, 
but the preceding year, as since acknow- 
ledged, she had shed such bitter tears, at 
the thought of having deprived herself of 
the power of retrieving his fortune â€” 
where, but the last week, they had sat to- 
gether under its magnificent canopy, con- 
templating the splendours of the gorgeous 



322 CONTRAST. 

/ west, and luxuriating in the contrast of 
present happiness with past inquietude, 
the air all balm, the flowers refreshed by 
the falling dews, exhaling their choicest 
bosomed scents, and all breathing peace 
and tranquillity around them, so soon to 
be interrupted in their bosoms. Ah ! in 
this moment of exquisite enjoyment, had 
the curtain that concealed the dreadful 
future been but a minute uplifted â€” but 
that which we cannot avoid, is, in mercy, 
concealed from us.

His eyes involuntarily turned towards 
the Abbey, but were quickly withdrawn, 
with a shuddering sensation, at the idea of 
the scene that would soon take place there : 
within its decaying walls, in the course of a 
few days, would repose her in whom his soul 
had delighted â€” here, reckless of the win- 
try storms of time, careless of the changing 
seasons, no more to be wooed abroad by 
the rising sun, no more by the pale-orbed 
jnoon â€” no more to be moved by the wail 
of grief â€” no more by the voice of love ; in 
silence and darkness, the daughter of beau- 
ty would rest, till time itself was no more.

His mother had by this time come out 
to seek him, De Montville, on finding 
the uselessness of attempting any argu- 
ments at present with him, having return- 
ed to the house. Instinctively she bent 
her steps towards the Abbey, and there, 
in its vicinity, found him as expected. 
He attempted to retreat, on seeing her ; 
but her tears, her entreaties, stayed him. 
She reminded him of the submission we 
owe to the will of Heaven â€” she represent- 
ed to him the utter improbability there 
was of Helena ever more having enjoyed 
happiness in this life, after what had oc- 
curred, and conjured him to let this consi- 
deration operate as it ought upon his mind. 

She described the sufferer as not merely 
collected in her last moments, but perfectly 
resigned to her early fate ; and this assu- 
rance, more than any thing she urged, 
seemed to have a consoling effect upon 
the wounded mind of the mourner: the 
sternness of his grief gave way to a sub- 
duing softness, and he no longer resisted 
returning to the house. The moment he 
entered it, he fled to the chamber of death.

His mother made no effort to prevent 
him ; she knew it was by yielding to grief, 
its sad indulgence, not opposing it, that it 
becomes gradually soothed and softened. 

All traces of suffering had departed 
from the countenance of the deceased ; a 
smile, the impress of celestial hope, was 
on it, and from the perfect composure of 
the features, it might have been supposed 
she was but in a calm sleep. And so un- 
altered as she was ! was she really more 
than in a slumber? But, ah, the chilling 
coldness of the marble lips! and were 
those eyes never more to open to him! 
and was this fair hand still to fall lifeless 
from his grasp ! Nature became, at 
length, exhausted by the renewed trans- 
ports of his sorrow, and he suffered him- 
self to be conducted to his own chamber. 

He insisted on being left to himself. It 
was midnight when he started from his 
widowed couch, to visit the dead again. 
Softly he opened the chamber-door, and 
listened; but it was the house of death, 
and the stillness of sacred sorrow prevailed 
throughout it : not a sound was to be heard, 
save the sighing of the wind amidst the

trees, and the wailings of the birds of 
darkness, that nestled in the ivied turrets 
and old chimneys of the pile. Still cau- 
tiously, notwithstanding, the mourner 
stepped forward, lest of any alarm being 
created that might impede the indulgence 
he sought. 

In the chamber of death he found his 
old nurse; but grief and fatigue had 
weighed down her heavy eyelids. Stretch- 
ed upon the floor, in profound repose, she 
offered no obstruction to the indulgence 
of his sorrow. In the midst of this, the 
mourner suddenly paused, to contemplate, 
with something like a rising feeling of en- 
thusiasm, the scene before him. 

The couch on which rested the deceased 
exactly fronted a window of large dimen- 
sions, the shutters of which, being care- 
lessly closed, admitted the silvery light 
of a full-orbed moon, that falling in di- 
verging rays upon the head, seemed to 
form a glory round it, that beautifully con- 
trasted with the murky light of the dim, 
neglected tapers, seven in number, at 
the feet, in conformity with the Catholic 
superstition of the nurse. " Is not this

wonderfully grand and sublime ?" thought 
Mountflorence ; " might not one imagine, 
from this sight, this seeming halo round 
that beauteous head, that the trump had 
sounded ; and that the dead, in the act of 
shaking off the sleep of death, of putting 
on immortality for mortality, was already 
circled by the glories of the heavens open- 
ing to receive the ascending spirit ? Oh ! 
could I think this, how could I longer 
mourn ? No, thou dear one ! though thy 
death has left me widowed and forlorn, 
triumphantly might I then exclaim, ' O ! 
death, where is thy sting? O! grave, 
where is thy victory ?' But it will yet be 
so: the grave must render up its dead; 
and bursting from its cold confines, its re- 
animated tenants spring to life eternal â€” 
' To the faithful, death the gate of life." 



THE END.

person, and always coveting the honouis of bis family, which the Earl claimed as his birthright At the Court of Milan there were many ladies of i ank and beauty desirous of captivating the young and gallant Lord of Ravenspui, but he was insen¬ sible to their alluiements, lus heart and affections being previously engaged to an English lady, with whom he in¬ tended uniting his hand as soon as he returned to his unti ve countiy The name of the lady was Geialdine Titz- hugh, only child of the Eail of Fitz¬ liugh it was m obedience to the wishes ol the lady s fathei that the Lord Ravenspui accompanied Lionel to Italy, and he obtained from the noble Earl, in letuin, the promise that the Lady Ge¬ ialdine should be the immediato rewaid of this act of obedience, when he agam visited England The Pnncess Victoiine, the mtended bude of the Duke of Clarcuce, pos- B 2

sessed all the eharactei istic beauty of her country, her hne dark eyes weie shrouded by long black silken lashes , her noble fiont, round which hung clus¬ tering locks of jetty blackness, bespoke а capacious mmd but the haughty ilisposition of Victonne glanced but seldom through the windows of her soul In the court of her father she had early learnt dissimulation, and as she saw Lionel moie admired her eye, when, with half-closed lids, it assumed the languishing look of love, she suited her countenance to his taste, and before him, softness was the prevailing expres¬ sion she assumed Yet was she not in¬ fluenced by love, but solely by am bition, and theie were moments when hei proud spnit ill brooked this re¬ straint The chosen friend of her bosom was the Signora Angelina Frescati, daugh¬ ter of the Count of that name , equally haughty with her mistress, and her

peer in beauty, she resolvei on cap tivating the Lord of Ravenspur, anxious " To win lus praise whom all admire But the uniform coldness with which the English nobleman received her de¬ licate advances, stung her to the quick Victonne saw the slight her fnend re¬ ceived, and affected to resent it, by shewing the utmost lndifierenoe to¬ wards Ravenspur, and lavishing every allowable approbation upon his brother " Angelina," said the Pnneess one day to her favounte, who was thought¬ fully leaning her head against a marble pedestal, " Angelina, what think you of Lord Henry Ravenspur ? or perhaps his brother, the haughty Earl ? Ah ' An¬ gelina, stai t not thus thinkest tbou I am blind? listen—the cold-hearted Ra¬ venspur scorns thy proffered love nay, nay, Angelina, I know thee well From. love to hate the distance is but short.

Tıs true the noble an of the pioud Ravenspur caught my wandenng eye , but this in¬ stant fiom my beait I tear tbe silly passion, and will lend а willing ear to the sensitive advances of Lord Henry.

But why tarries he ? some form of stale impedes his progress The door at this moment opened, am', accompanied by Lord Henry, the Duke of Claience appioached his nnstiess with a bow of profound íespect The colour rose to Victonne s cheek, but her aveiteel face shewed how ill such greetings accorded with her ideas of love Foitunately for the Princess, she was released from hei embariassinent by the entrance of Angelina, whom she has tdy approached Angelina had well fulfilled bei mis¬ tress's commands, for never had she ap-

Prince into a deep recéis, under pre¬ tence of pointing out the beauty of the surrounding scenery, she gave Lord Henry time and opportunity to disclose to Angelina " that life without hei would be a desert—that his heart was sick of love, and that uhe alone of womankind had ever touched his soul with love s dehghtful hopes and fears ' Angelina listened with deep attention, and as she raised her eyes and saw his handsome features glowing with all her country's warmth a flush of somewhat like agitation passed across her beauti- *ul countenance, and Henry ventured at this moment to raise her hand to his lips, and imprinting on it an impassioned kiss, he entreated she would permit him to make known his sentiments to tbe Count Frescati Angelina at first hesitated, but at length she gave a reluctant assent, and the impatient Lord Henry was leaving the room, when Angelina hastily called
13
hım back. " Wait, my lord, till the Pnnce's audience is concluded, nay, more, wait till to morrow, I entreat " " Every hour's an age till I know my fate, ' replied the impatient Henry, " but I will obey you, matchless Angelina Yet while I gaze upon those lovely teatures, 1 envy all and every thing that may approach them The wanton breeze may fan them, yet, while it seems to cool, it makes them glow more bril¬ liantly The daring fly that perches on tby lip , that envied rose, whicb, insen¬ sible to its bliss, inhales thy scented breath ' " My lord, interrupted Angelina, smiling, аз the Prince withdiew, " adieu, 'his evening we shall meet again " She kissed her hand, and casting a languish nig look upon her lover, she left him overwhelmed with delight, and joined the Princess As soon as the two ladies were left
14
alone, Victonne cxchimed ' Ah, my Angelina, I envy thee the impassioned glances of thy lover Heavens ' what a contiast twixt him and Lionel Alas ' iny fate is sail indeed \ ou niay, y ou must be happy Angelina, for wbere there is love theie is bliss The Signora Angelina felt assured she should be happy Nevei had Lord Henry appeared to «o much advantage as upon this eventful day, and she de¬ clared he was nota whit inferior to his brother, either m mien or person This delusion however was but transient, loi when the Eail of Ravenspur, dressed in his robes of state appealed that even¬ ing at the ducal palace, bis figure and his miunei were supenor lo all present, Scarcely could Angelina attend to tho flattering speeches of Lord Henry as her eyes mechanically sought bis bro¬ ther Her inattention was observed by Loid Hemy, aud a shade of discontent
15
displaced the smiles which had hitherto graced his handsome countenance An¬ gelina saw the change, and with a be¬ witching smile enquired if he were ill ? " 111 ? he replied, " why, yes, but it is α sickness of the heart I feel Too lovely Angelina, if you knew but half iny love, you would not waste a thought upon one of this gay company save only me But I see you love me not, Sig¬ nora, I feel you do not, yet there is not here a heart that beats with so quick pulsation, nor one would dare as much foi thee as this, he continued pressing his hand to his bosom ' Deaiest An¬ gelina, pardon me, but I cannot endure that you should share those smiles with others for which I languish and which should indeed be wholly mine ' ' Why, Signor, —my lord/ replied Angelina "you aie not jealous?' The colour fled Loul Henry s cheek, his lips turned pale, and his fi owning brow assumed a feaiful aspect
16
" Nay, my lord, ' she resumed, chang¬ ing her tone, and shrinking from his piercing glance, " I did but jest, but in good truth 1 am not wont to be so wooed ' " Where there is much love, rephed Lord Henry, endeavouring to smile in his turn, " there will be necessarily a small degree of anxiety ' His counte nance by degrees recovered its wonted expression, and Angelina, aware of her power, fearlessly resolved to attach liei fate to his The evening passed on her part with a display of timid sensitiveness, and on his with cautious circumspection Close¬ ly he watched her every aotion, but Angelina was bis match, oaä he could discover in her conduct nought which could give him umbrage On the con¬ trary, the timidity she assumed rivetted his chains, and, more enamoured than ever, he on the following day declared his pretentions to the Count Frescati
17 The Count requested a delay before he gave bis answer, but as he found his daughter and the Princess alike eager for the match, he yielded to their wishes, and llu nuptials of Victorino and An¬ gelina were celebrated on tbe same day

The nuptials of Pnncess Victonne were solemnized with the gieatest splendour, tilts and touinaments for

three successive days amused the court and here, as upon all othei occasions, Ravcnspur shone conspicuous Clad in a coat of mail of polished steel, with a cloak of ruby velvet, the bolder of which was formed of ravens embroidered in gold, and attached to each other by gracefully twisted branches, his plume- crowned helm was ornamented with the same bird (the crest of his family), grace¬ fully he managed bis spirited courser But that which most attracted the atten¬ tion and excited the envy of the ladies was an elegant scarf fastened round his arm, and the device of his shield, which, instead of the beanng of his family, was ornamented with л silver dove in profile, the eye of which was a ruby the motto which encircled the device was the dissyllable " Peerless " Raven- spur was challenged on the fiist day by several Italian nobles, each maintaining the superiority of his fan one s charms over those of the English dame, but
20
theEnglish Lord compelled tbem to own his dove waa peerless. On tbe third day, however, he appeared bearing a shield with a sun in the middle; the motto round it ran thus ; " Too brilliant to admit the gaze of aught but a Royal Eagle." The heart of the Princess beat quick as Ravenspur, after having carried off the prize of valour throughout tbe day, laid his trophies at ber feet. Her hand3 trembled as she fastened round his arm a silken scarf, and bade him " 'vear it and defend it." " With my life, uoble lady," replied the Earl energetically ; " they shall be entwined together," he continued, as he wound the scarf of the Lady Fitzliugh once across that of the Duchess of Clarence, without observing the flashing eye and swelling bosom, which betrayed to more than one bystander the feelings of the Princess. Her agitation, however, at length
21
betame so evident that she feigned indisposition , and the Duke, alaimed, entreated sbe would retire, himself con¬ ducting her from her eat of honour, pre-eded by Ravenspur bareheaded When she reached her own apart¬ ment, they left her to the care of Ange¬ lina and the attendants but the absence of the Princess put an end to lhat day s sport and Ravenspur returned to his own house, and wrote (a rare qualifica¬ tion in those times) a letter to the Lady Geraldine Fitzhugh. Hav ing enveloped it ш silk and tied it round with a golden thread he called for his most trusty esqune, and bidding him pre¬ pare for л journey, he committed to bis care the letter which was to give intelligence of his speedy retuin " Tell my lady love/ said the Baron, " that days are years without her that the clear blue sky of Italy is less dear to me than the stormy clime which shelters her I love tbat the black
22 eyes of Italian dames αϊ с not to be com pai ed with hers of soft and azure blue that day and night she occupies my thoughts,—that when I sleep, I dream of her, and when I awake my tnoughts are wholly hers Tell her, that on the wings of love, when once I touch my native land, I shall fly to hei much honouied presence, and at her feet claim the rewaid of all my toils Tell hei that one sweet smile liom hei will overpay the pangs of absence, and cheat "■ie into Elysium Quick, my faithful squire beai Ous lettéi to my lady love, and tins to Father Nicholas On his knee the esquue received the silken pa'eel, and kissing the laud of bis lord hastily left his piesence, and with all possible speed he hastened to make glad the heai t ol tlie Lady Geial¬ dine by tiding fiom bei intended loid Victonne m the mean while, though she had left the tilt yard, was still obliged to dissemble the cause of her mdispo-
23
sition , the presence of Angelina was now an intoleiable lestiaint, and feign¬ ing extreme weai mess, sht commanded all should li ave bei save \ntoinette, liei personal attendant and foster sister When alone with the latter, the long suppressed teais of indignant passion burst foith , while hei attendant, de¬ voted with the most disinterested affec¬ tion to her nnstiess, intreated she would unfold the cause of bei guef The Princess waved her hand to An¬ toinette, and bade hei hold her peace, since no power on eaith could ìelieve hei soriow " Yes, Signoia,' ıeplıed hei maid, ' theie is one being on eaith who can ìelieve vom gnef He who causes it may cine it. \h ' beloved lady, ill betide tht dav which brought the Count of Ravtnspui to Milan s proud toweis.

And now arrived the day when the Duchess of Clarence and her suite were
25
to commence their long and perilous jouiney No intieaties could prevail upon the Princess \o embaik loi Eng land , she chose ι athei to encounter the penis ol the land than those of the sea A soi t of litter was theielore provided foi bei and her female suite, while her male attendants travelled, some on hoises, some on mules, and some in a curious kind of eau îage which was much used m those times The fiist dny s journey lay through a smiling cultivated country, but on that which followed, it assumed a wildei appearance This part of Italy, too, was at this penod much infested by banditti, and at evei y turn of a projecting rock oui travelleis might have expected an attack, but thai their escort was so numeious. On the third day the Princess, who till she ap¬ peared at her fathei's court had nevei passed the precincts ot a convent garden, was compelled to admire the majestic piospect which opened to theie view vol ι с
26
when they attained the summit of one of the Apennines. The party having halt¬ ed to take some refreshment, they had an opportunity of looking back to the country they had traveised The moun¬ tain on which they rested о ertopped tliose around it, and the outline of the horizon was composed of all the neb luxuuance of an Italian landscape, kin¬ dled by the purple, golden tints of evening. In the opposite direction, the scene was far more grand though per¬ haps less pleasing, there the snor capt Apennines were tinged with α bright yellow, whiletheu dark sides, impeivious to the slanting rays of а setting sun, were enveloped in total darkness For some time the part) stood in pleasing contemplation of tbe supeib scene be¬ fore them, but the mountain air was cold, and the Duke proposed they should light torches and immediately begin their descent, as the guides assured them, there was a convent half way be-
27
tween this mountam and the next town, which could accommodate the ladies of the party The Princess was fatigued, but re¬ joicing m the prospect of being shel tei ed under the roof of a religious house for the night, she joyfully entered her litter, and the party again set forward The evening closed rapidly upon Ihem, and scarcely had they descended half way down the mountain when they were enveloped in the shades of night, then situation became consequently perilous, aud, to complete the dismay, a shrill whistle was heard Tbe guides gave the alarm, and eaeh man stood upon the defensive From several parts of tbe rocks suddenly were heard nume¬ rous wate hworels, as our tiavellers sup¬ posed, and all at once a hundred torches gleamed on either side, which disclosed a regular armed force above and below Salvator's pencil only could do justice to the scene Our travellers were passing
28
along a narrow winding udge cut out ot the mountain s side, w ithout any defence, except that whieh the sagacity of the mules and the hardy muleteers lui nished, to prevent then tailing into a deep and ra pid stream, whose loanngs tbey had long heard, and which was now visible, acting asa refiex and multiplying mirroi, giv ing back biokcnly and more numeious, the grotesque foi ms which above and below appeared on eveiy point where foot of man could rest Above them lose the mountain ¡.lmost perpendiculaily, and it appeared alike dangeious to advance or recede If they could have regained the summit, it would have availed them nought, to remain where they were was but lo wait like cowards till their enemies should spring upon them and lead them away captive To advance, therefore, was the only mode of conduct tiţey bad left them to adopt, and, since they were thus beset by danger on every
29
side, they resolved nobly to dare it, and use their aims to free them from then peni. They weie men whom they weie to attack, and men the lame of whose dai mg deeds bad resounded from one end of Italy to the othei , but oui tiavelleis weie surprised at their present hardı hood, foi α numerous escort of aimed men led the van of Lionel and his suite and another brought up the tear The Duke, indeed, was so amazed at the scene before lum, that he knew not how to act, but Ravenspur raising his spear, in а loud voice demanded ' the cause of this interi uption ? He was an svvei ed by the whizung of а spear which passed close to his helmet At this mo ment а tall figuro advanced to the brink of the opposite precipice ' Stand ' he cried, "and listen In the pause he made the rocks re echoed " listen —He then lesumed his speech thus " Knights ye seem, and brave ones too, for that moie woithy ot the name My с 3
30
followers are brave and valiant too, the pass is dangerous, and at а single word of mine the torches of my friends shall be extinct, and thus though surrounded you will not see your foes Each craggy point we know yield thee then oui prisoners, and for a ransom ye shall again be free " The situation of the robber was cho¬ sen purposely where the opposite rock gave back his last words distinctly, and this circumstance acting often upon the timid, had filled their minds with a su¬ perstitious awe, but the present com¬ pany were not to be intimidated by mere sounds, and Ravenspur advancing im¬ mediately opposite to the robber, be¬ tween whom and himself inn the rapid stream, replied in a loud tone " Insolent robber, talkest thou thus to us ? What ' think ye we are slaves, to bow at thy command? Would this dark and dis¬ mal stream were not between us " The robber laughed, and as the travellers quickened the pace of tbeir mules, he
31
called out, " Ye Boon sliall have your wish, Sir Kmght, the dark and dismal stream shall not be long between us ' In an instant the opposite rock was enveloped m darkness, except what faint light illumined the most prominent points from the toi ches our travellers carried Ere the lattei reached the bottom of the defile, they heard the tread of many feet moving with ìapidity, and the rustling of branches and trees, at length the shrill whistle again stole upon their ears, and the guides exclaimed, " They have crossed the pine bridge, and now there is no escape ■ ' The whole party me¬ chanically paused,—but for one mstant only, for upon the opposite side they obseived a part of the rock warm with the glow of fire, presently they heard the shull whistle again, and as the guides burned the mules along! they suddenly discovered a large fire, which a projecting rock had hither с 4
32
to concealed, though tbey had for some time observed its reflection Round this fire was а group of ban¬ ditti some leaning on spears, some busily employed in furbishing then arms, others stretched listlessly at theu length on the ground At a signal given from below, each man thrust a toich into the fire, and having kindled it they sprang from one projection to another, with the ease, swiftness, and secunty of chamois, until they reached the pine bridge Having placed two sentinels at the one end, they stood m fantastic groups on tbe surrounding paits of the rock, foiming subjects for the pencil exceeding all that the ima¬ gination could conjure up of wild and romantic The countenances of these men exhibited a variety of expression, which was perfectly discernible from the strong glare of the torches they carried Some of them looked gaily
33
upon our tiavellers, others appealed wiapped in thoirown gloomy thoughts, but the gieatei part woie a teinfic aspect gloomily tbey scowled upon lhe cavalcade as it passed the end ol the pine budge, and it had not ad vaneed many steps beyond il when they extinguished their toi ches, and the mountains, the toirents, and the tia veilers became in one instant an un distinguishable landscape The terrai s of the Princess and hei attendants weie greatly increased by this sudden transition from а glaie of light to total darkness, it was long ere they could distinguish the nearest objects, and slowly and in silence they pursued their dreary journey They leached the bottom of the rock in safety, but scarcely had the foremost of the party advanced beyond it, when the weie attacked on all sides, and quickly dispersed The contest was terrific, foi с 5
34 tlie robbers, who knew every inch of ground and its advantages, fought bravely, and the Duke, Ravenspur, and Lord Hemy, fought by the side of the litters, till the former ıeceıved a wound, exc.aiming, " I am slain " Lord Henry rushed forward to bis assistance, and Ravenspur, extending his shield over Lionel, resolved to die rather than desert his lord The moon at this mo¬ ment rising from beneath a sable cloud, disclosed to the astonished ť'avclleis that then guides, mules, and baggage were gone, tbat the wounded Duke was senseless from loss of blood, while the wailing of Angelina, who advanced towards Lord Henry, declared " that the httei of the Princess was also led away, and that their female attendants were at that moment surrounded by armed banditti ' The men who bore the litters were now fouud to have been traitors, as well as their guides, and
35
the Duke, Ravenspur, and Henry were on the point of being made prisoners, when a shull blast fiom а trumpet above startled the robbers Their chief put а small hoin to his mouth and an¬ swered it A reply was made from the top of the rock, and the robbers whis pering with each other, bade " Ra¬ venspui begone," adding, " the lady is by this tune m a place of safety , the Duke you may remove without moles tation at the next town or convent you shall know the ransom of the Lady Victonne " " Villain · ' exclaimed Ravenspur, sprmging towards the robber, " thinkest thou we shall quietly leave the Lady Victonne m tby power ' Tell us where she is to be found '" " I told you she was safe, ' replied the robber, disengaging himself from the grasp of Ravenspui, "and so she will iernam , but to find hei '—wl>j, if jou с 6
36
can you may. As he said this hfe wiapped himself in his cloak, and in an instant disappeared Ravenspur was not, however, so easi ly dismissed, having found some of lus people among the neighbouung rocks, he ordered them to bear the Duke to the convent while he himself would seek the lady Victonne A litter of bough's was made foi the invalid, and another for Angelina, which was suppoited partly by her husband , and in this procession they reached tbe convent without fuithei molcs'ation where the wounded Duke was restored to animation by the skill of the monks, mid theu subsequent hospitality speedily contributed to his restoration to health The lady Angelina was impatient at the absence of hei mistress and the dull monotony of the monastic life, the gloomy situation of the convent, the un certainty when she should emerge from
J7 this solitude, contributed to overcast hei countenance with chagrin, which tbe at tentions of bei husband were not stiong ι uough to dispel At the convent we shall leave them and follow the chivalrous Ravenspui m his search of the lady Victoi me

As Ravenspur reascended the lock, the moon broke forth in cloudless ma¬ jesty, and illumined the magniliceut prospect befoie him, every iude pro¬ jection glistened with a silvery white¬ ness, and the deep shadows they formed threw a wildness and a romantic beauty over the sui rounding objects, which gave them an additional chai m All, too, was still, except the roar of the wateis be¬ neath No sound stole upon his ear, and it seemed as if the universe was at rest and he alone was waking By the
39
time he aruved at the pine bridge, the eastern tops of the mountains had as¬ sumed a faint rosy tinge , ere he crossed the bridge he stood for a few minutes, musing upon the singularity of his pre sent situation , and as In» eyes wandered from steep to steep, be sow upon an op¬ posite crag what he imagined was the lady Victonne's veil He now, therefore, eageily advanced towaids the bridge, when the tnendly word " Benedicite ' stiuck upon his ear. Ravenspur turned quickly round, and beheld a fuai ascending the rock with hasty steps he halted till the lather reached hnn, and then inquired wli it could bring him alone, and at that time of the moi mng, to so desolate а place " I come, son, ' replied the fnar, " to counsel thee thou might'st as well at¬ tempt to climb the eagle s nest, and from beneath the motherbird to takehei young, as in that garb of thine to pass that bridge Thou must doff thy coat of

" No, my son," ıejoıned the fnai, " but prudence is not fear See, 1 have biought the peaceful garb of St Fran¬ cis Stay, noble sir, if thou wilt indeed release the lady Victonne, thou must by stratagem counteract deep strata¬ gems Heie, too, is the dress of a lay brother for the lady. Go, and may hea- veu prosper thee " The monk laid the dresses at the feet of the Baron, and left him without fur¬ ther parley Ravenspur gazed after hnn for some time, then stooping, took up the monk's garment, and aftei a few moments, con¬ sideration, he put it on over his coat of mail, rolling up that of the lay brother, he hid his helmet in a cleft of the rock,
41
and musing on the strange vicissitudes ot this mortal life, he agam slowly approached the budge, atter passing which, he directed his steps towaids that part of the rock where he fancied he saw tbe veil Scarcely could he toi beai a smile as his grey garments raught the morning breeze, at his outward transí tion, from α knight to a monk , and he pondered as he went touching the best means of supporting his new eharactei As he was climbing the rock, with somewhat of more agility than his brethren of the cowl wei e wont to evince, one of the banditti halloed to him, " Holla, father·" said the robber, " save yourself the trouble of climbing for that piece of flimsy finely, youi services are required to bury some of our brave fel lows, who were killed in a skiimish last night ' Ravenspur halted, and pulling his cowl ovei his face, he greeted the robbei with а " Benedicite " " Aye, we had warm work last night,
43
father, down below, ' said the rob ber, «hose name was Jacques , " while you were snoring in your cell we were fighting like men , and with men, too, I can tell you Our enemies fought brave¬ ly Here s to you, father," he continued, putting α flask to his mouth, "this moun¬ tain an is cold—will you pledge me > Nay, then, be hanged—hark, I hear the Captain's whistle ' " Aye, there he is sure enough, sus¬ pended to the point o f that rocs which overhangs the stream like an ibex, your head, father, I suppose, would grow giddy at so elevated а situation " " What, are you dumb this morning? But you know you have reached the spot where you are to be hoodwinked " Ravenspui pulled his cowl closely over Ins face " Aye, resumed Jacques, " that may be mighty fine, but you monks are fond of peeping, so, do you see, you must submit to the old fashion " As
43
the robber said this, he hastily threw a tluck cloak ovei the Baron s head, and wrapped it round him. " Now, ' he con¬ tinued, " I suppose they have sent one of their novices—but hark ye, man, don't be frightened, keep fast hold of this rope, and listen to my directions " As they commenced their ascent, Jacques occasionally gave directions to Ravenspur as to where there was a pro¬ jection, and talking of the various points of the rocks, as if his companion's eyes were at liberty to contemplate the wild scenery they were now traversing As they advanced the rush of waters in¬ creased, and Jacques observed, " aye, there now, there s а pretty noise for you, and what a view ' I have a great mmd to give you one peep at the cata¬ ract , but you must promise not to look to the right or the left " " Agreed,' said Ravenspur, who was panti ng for α breath of pure air " Agreed, my son—surely we are very near the
44
cataract, and are we not descending ıapıdly ? ' " A little bit, quoth Jacques, " now stand still, father, and 111 unhood you tor an instant, but stop, let's see if none of my comrades be abroad No, the coast is clear, and so here goes " As he concluded this speech, he pulled the cloak from the Earl, having placed him so tbat he could have а full view of the cataract " There, father,' said he, "theiesa view for you " It was indeed a lovely prospect from the summit of the highest rock the waters rushed with immense velooity into the stream below, its spray and foam in some parts totally concealed the surrounding scenery, while а thousand varying hues in splendid aiches weie the result of the suns rays upon this light and transparent veil Beyond the cata¬ tad, and on the opposite side, forests of oak and pine feathered down the
45
mountains,while on thespot on which the beholder stood, nought but bun en rock- were found Along the ton ent s brink a narrow pathway had been cut, which wound up the mountain s side, forming а dangerous ascent to all but the hardy mountaineers, who found safety and se cunty in its difficulty " Ah ' ' exclaimed the robber, all at once, and straining his eyes as if to penetrate the foam, " I thought I saw a woman s foim on the opposite rock, then recollecting himself, he quickly turned towaid» the EarLwhose eyes were fortunately at this mstant directed to¬ wards the cataract, " So, father, you ve looked enough, and now for your cowl Jacques having again hoodwinked Ra venspur, he proceeded merrily on, com menting occasionally upou the superıoı advantages of that countiy foi pei sons of his calling At length be halted saying, " Now stand still, father, as you
46
value your life,—be patient one instant, 111 soon be with you Ravenspur had foi some time in vain endeavoured to free himself from his incumbrance, but was just on the point of succeeding, when the voice of Jacques stole upon his ear, in conversation with а thud person, and the knight could plainly distinguish the following words " I tell you I m sure I saw her, she was stealing from behind the point ot the rock at the mouth of the cave and, a plague take her, uow we shall have a fine dance after her, to be sure she can t get far without help There she is, by Jupitei, away, Baptısto, IU follow with this reverend friar Come on, father, quick, quick, a plague upon him now, he 11 be drowned if I don t uncover his eyes " As Jacques said this, he ui ed the cloak from the Baron, telling him to grasp tightly by his belt, and fix his eyes
47
on the back of his head, while he crossed the wavin t *- bridge of pine, ' lest your head should grow giddy, father, he added, ' a fall into that torrent would soon give you a quietus There now, re¬ cover your breath and remember what I told you Ravenspur did as the robber desired him, and reached the opposite side in safety " Now, father/ resumed the robber, " you may make your fortune only tell the lady I shall bring to you, that her husband says, and that the fiery lord who was with him says, she must make herself contented here for a while, until they can send her ransom do ye hear ? and give hei some of youi prate about obedience in womankind and such like Ί here she is, by St Nicholas, faith she 11 outiun Baptısto , for your life, father, don t budge Jacques fled with rapidity and Raven¬ spur saw the lady Victonne skimming

the ground, rather thau touching it she ι ushed with such velocity along the edge of the precipice tbat he trembled ior her life, and so anxious was he for the re¬ sult, that he watched her immoveably At sight of him, however, upon whom she came unexpectedly, she started, then flinging herself at his feet, she clasped his knees and entreated his protection " Oh, reverend father, she exclaimed " save me, save me from this lawless banditti, Milan will nciily endow your convent, every thing which your supe¬ riors can desire shall be the result of the rescue of Victonne, Milan s daughter " Lady," replied Ravenspur with well dissembled accents, " I bear a mes¬ sage from the noble Lionel ' He cast a cautious glance around, and in an undei tone he added, " pretend compliance, and follow those men to the cave, I'll rescue you " He then fixed his eyes stead ily upon hei,
49
and half raised his hood, she recognized him, and, overcome with joy, was near falling to the ground " Daughter, ' resumed Ravenspur, as Jacques advanced " I expect obedience to thy lord's commands , return to thy place of retreat, till thou hearest further from the Duke " Victonne looked piteously at Raven¬ spur, but he poutted to the robbers and bade her follow their " Well done, father," said Jacques, " if you could make our Jeannette but half as complying as this lady, I would fill your hood with gold Come, Sig¬ imi a, on to your cave, our captain will be home anon, and then you'll know how long you will remain our guest As for you, father, Baptısto will lead you to our buttery You friars have no objection to a buttery visit Bap¬ tısto, give him a llaggon of the best Florence wine, and be sure, father, you try your skill on Jeannette ' vol ι D

56 when these restless spn its would retire to rest. In about an hours tune Jeannette appeared, accompanied by Jacques , tlie former looked earnestly towaids the bed, and Ravenspui was soon convinced that bis means of escape lay there She then pointed, unperceived by Jacques, to anothei part of the doimitoiy, and having placed tbe provision on the table, she bade lum " fall to," and left the apaitment She was no sooner gone than Jacques, who was pacing the cave with а slow and heavy step, stopped opposite to the Earl, and thus addressed bun " Fathei, thou canst give me absolu¬ tion ' ' Ravenspur was at a loss bow to reply to this request, and as he did not immediately answei, the îobber resum¬ ed thus " Tather, I do not ask foi absolution of the past that I may sin again

Ravenspur looked up "Iamwearyot this life," resumen die robbei, " and fam would quit it But I have sworn fidelity to the brave Manuel, and would not loi a king s ransom betray my captam ' " Thou wouldst quit this life, thou sajst?' ıeplıed Ravenspur, "thou shalt quit it, and with honour too , hast thou tablets > ' " Oui captam cannot read,' was the ıeply, "and his followers aie not bettei taught than himself but, reverend fa¬ ther, tell me, how can I quit this mode of lite and not betray my trust'" " Tbou shalt ask an audience of thy chief, ' replied Ravenspui, " and thou shalt swear to him, before tbou dost make known thy purpose, that thou ait acting from thine own free will, and that thou wilt bind thyself by a solemn oath never to breathe to mortal ear aught that relates to him or his retreat, that thou art bound for England, and that the safety of himself and his companions will d 5

Well, well, 1 see thou fearest to betray thy trust, no matter, the bold can al ways find means to accomplish their de signs Adieu, canst thou not secuie this door from all interruption ? " No," replied Jacques, " that old witch Jeannette will enter here

With some hesitation Jacques began to open his commission. The captain looked sternly at him.

65
same time she would take some refiesh- inent " The man then left the apartment, and Jeannette told the lady " to lake good heait, for a fuend was at bund Eat, Signoia, cat, thou wilt need sup¬ poit, toi, befoie the moinmg dawns, thou wilt climb the mount un s brow, and cie the setting sun thou shalt behold thy Lord But I dare not stay Faie- well, Signoia " About a quarter of an hour had elapsed after her departure, ere Raven¬ spui ventured to approach the opening, which he discovered, after some little difficulty, by means of a ray of light stieaming through a narrow crevice The stoni which was fitted into the wall being ıemoved with as little noise as possible, he pionounced the name of Victonne she had retreated to the othei end of the apaitment, when first she heard tlie noise caused by ıemovıng the blone, but advanced rapidly towaids the
ea
aperture as she recognized the voice of her dchveier, and from him briefly re¬ ceived the information respecting then purposed flight Victonne s fine eyes sparkled with delight as Ravenspui proceeded, and extending her hand towards him, she called him " hei deliverer, her knight " Ravenspur respettfully bent towards the Pnncess, and ıeplıed that " m doing every thing foi hei release, he did but do bis duty ' The word duty sounded cold and hmsh upon the Princess's ear, and her languishing look betrayed that she could have wished it had been sup¬ plied by that of love Ravenspur stayed but а short time near the Princess, and doffing his cowl, he again felt mastei of his fate He grasped his trusty sword, and having removed Jeannette s bed, he opened а small door, taking at the same time a lamp which the provident Jean nette had left with him The current
67
of air had nearly extinguished it and letreating hastily, he placed it in a shel tered spot, and again piepaied to ex¬ plore the passage, when he heaid voices approaching Having removed the bed, he seized his cowl and seated himself on a joint stool, with his hands crossed upon bis breast " I tell you, Jeannette," said Bap¬ tısto, "that I must see that he is there I saw Jacques skipping from cliff to cliff, like an ibex, and he had no Father Fran¬ cis with him What expedition can he be gone upon? Aye, the rogue, he wanted forthwith to have the poor fellows who died last night buried like christians, yet he is off, and left them bleaching on the rock Open the dcoi, I say" Jeannette with trembling hands un¬ closed the door, and her heart was re¬ lieved of a dead weight when she saw the monk seated quietly on his stool ' There, are you contented now ?
68
said she, " and besides, what signifies it that the monk is safe here, or ui bis con¬ vent ?

" The Duke of Milan '" echoed back Baptısto , " didst thou say tbe Duke of Milan ? why that puts mc in mmd of the Duke s daughter Poor thmg, ' he con¬ tinued , " she must be dull for want of company I think I'll sit a bit with her, and share my omelette with her too ' " A fine thing truly," resumed Jean¬ nette, scornfully , " you eat in the pre¬ sence of the Duke of Milan s daughter '' " Aye,' replied Baptısto , " she's like to eat many times in mine, for Manuel lias asked an enormous ransom, thinking the Duke hei father and hei husband will hesitate to pay it Can you guess bis drift ?—I'll tell ye —if they refuse, why he means to marry her himself ' Therufflan'sconversation was scarce-
70
ly to be endured by the impatient Ra¬ venspui " Son/ at length he said, disguising his feelings, " thou talkest at random Thou wouldst not intrude thyself upon the Princess s privacy ?" " He daies not," said Jeannette , "for I heard the captain say himself should sup with the Lady Victonne " A long dispute ensued between the m toxicated Baptısto and Jeannette, which was at last terminated by tbe approach of one of their comrades Ravenspur withdrew to a distant pait of the cell, aid passed unnoticed by the intruder, while the trio went wrangling away , Jeannette having taken the precaution to lock the door and carry away the key Ravenspur was fretted at this inter¬ ruption, and more so at the intelbgence of Jeannette respecting Manuel and the Signora. Time, too, fled, and he re¬ solved without further delay to explore the passage leading to tlie mountains ,
71
and, having ogam thrown off bis cowl, he with measuied steps paced the rock, and aftei a little time discovered the foot-rests alluded to by Jeannette This was sufficient, and be was leturnmg to his rctieat, when α voice said " Stand ' Ravenspui s piesence of mind did not foisake hnn, and pointing with his sword to the person who addressed him, he stalked haughtily by, and profiting by a short but peipendicular fall of the lock, he let himself drop, and to the man s mind vanished into an y nothing Asham¬ ed of saying be bad seen a ghost, al¬ though he felt convinced he had, he quitteil bis post, and was taking shekel behind a projecting point, when Raven¬ spur agam stalked haughtily by him, pointing to tbe opposite side of the tor rent " There, ' said he, in hollow accents, " there we shall meet again He then appeared to the terufied robbei to va lush, and was seen no more The ban-
72
dit quitted his post as fast as he could, and stealing to the buttery, declared to Jeannette that he bad indeed seen the ghost With good dissembling, Jean netto feigned horror at the tale, and advi sed him to hide himself till morning, and say nothing about the matter, as it might expose him to the ridicule of some of his companions whofeaied neither the living nor the dead The man veiy willingly agreed to this, and Jeannelte augiucd well of this com¬ mencement of an adventure, the lortu nate result of which she had much at heart Jeannette had been brought to this den of thieves by her husband, who, having fallen into sudden poverty, had been induced to join the hardy banditti which infested these mountains, and which wcie so numerous as to dely the attacks of the civil power Upon the death of her husband she wished to re turn to Milan, but she was too useful a domestic to be spaied, and too well ac
73
quainted with their roads and fastnesses to be allowed to depart A prisoner therefore she remained, for she was too old to attempt an escape by herself, but although she had long left the cıvıl ha bıtatıons ot men, and had become pee vish from incessant irritation, she had nevertheless a feeling heart, and had more than once planned the escape of an unfortunate pusoner. As she was always grumbling at the trouble the pri¬ soners gave her, she was never suspect¬ ed of assisting thein in their escape Ravenspur having once more reached the dormitory, trimmed his lamp, and cautiously advanced towards the cave where the Princess was anxiously ex¬ pecting his arrival Having enveloped her in tbe monk s garments, he led the way, and bade heı feailessly but atten lively attend to his directions Raven spur theu preceded her, and before he arnved at the spot where the centinél vol ι ï
74
had stood, he advanced alone Finding all was safe, he beckoned the Signora, and she quickly obeyed his summons With swift steps tbey paced Ihe edge oi the precipice, and having passed this formidable and conspicuous situation, they descended wilh tolerable ease, as the steps, if they may be so called, were here at no great distance from each other, the robbers feeling assured no ven¬ turous strangei would attempt to ex plore the upper part of the mountain As they descended their difliculties became greater, for tbe distance of many ot these footrests was so great, as to be totally impassable foi Victonne. Fa¬ tigued too by hei exertion, she began to fear that she sbouid never reach the convent in safety " Courage, noble Signora, said Ra¬ venspur, against whom sbe leaned , ' couiage, we shall have help foithwith The spot he had chosen as a resting
75
place for his weary companion, was tho point of a rock which commanded a partial view of the cataract, had it been daylight, but the shades of night still enveloped the mountains The rush of waters, which was accompanied by the howling of the blast, added greatly to the solemnity of their feelings. As the first faint streak of day was visible thiough the narrow defiles they were descending, Ravenspur started from 'ns position, and requested the Sigo aia vvould rise A distant liom was heaid from ab we · Victonne grasped the Baron s arın ' They have discovered our flight she exclaimed in trembling accents Ravenspur thought it probable, and he looked around for a place of refuge, and at length found α cave at а short distance, which appeared to have esca¬ ped the notice of the robbeis, as the low brushwood which surrounded it was
76
perfectly undisturbed, and grew in wild luxuriance on all sides of it It was, howevei, so much below them, that Victoiine could not spring from the peipendicular height upon which she stood to reach it The knight had just assured her tbat if she would make the effort he would catch her ere she reached the giound, when the horn again sounding, the Sig¬ nora in the terrei of the moment sprang from the precipice, and found herself encircled by the arms of Ravenspur, who bore her to the friendly retreat Scarcely had she recovered herself, when they heard voices " I tell you she must bave fled this way, she never could cross the pine bridge without assistance. She cannot have proceeded far these rocks would ill suit a wo¬ man s foot Hollo ' Baptısto · the news ? the news' Is she found? A plague on all women ' I say, here is always ю

Ah ■ Bap¬ tısto beckons ' they have got her, by Ju piter' And away they scudded like so many goats Victorme was half dead with terror, but yet, beset with dangers in this soli tude with Ravenspur by hei side, she enjoyed a fearful happiness And could she but have imagined love caused the Baron s solicitude on her account, she would voluntarily have submitted to live with him for ever in tbe midst of rocks and caves But in Ravenspur s countenance no trace of tenderness was seen , anxiety for hei safety as a woman, and more particularly as the bride of Lionel, she could discover m every action, but the anxiety which arose from so general a punciple did but ill accord with th > warmth of her own feelings Involun¬ tarily she clung to bis arm, and with
78
languishing looks implored him to pro¬ tect her "Ihave swoin, lady, as а kmght to protect the helpless and forlorn, and, though I grieve to say it, yet Milan's daughter lanks with these Rely upon my faith, my honour ' As he concluded this short speech, the biushwood at the entrance of the cave was shaken, as by some unseen hand Ravenspur rushed forward, and was on the point of thrusting his sword through the screen of foliage which concealed their hiding-place, when he was arrested by some one's calling out ' hold !

Her father lov d me, oft mvited me Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes Tha 1 liave pus d I ran it through, even from my boyish days To the very moment tl at he bade me tell it Othiixo
During their little voyage from Ge¬ noa to Marseilles, Ravenspur had be¬ guiled the time with tbe relation of his boyish adventures, of his first essay of arms against a Moorish prince in Spam, and of the honour of knighthood which was conferred upon him by John the Fust, King of Castile, upon that occa sion Of this narration we shall give the substance Ravenspur was an accomplished gen tleman of those distant times, in early youth he had imbibed a taste for let-
83
ters, and the vicinity of a Dominican convent to his own domains, and the friendship of one of the monks procured foi him the distinguishing talent of being able to read fluently m English and in Latin, and to write with ease. Many of the bravest knights about that period could do little more than sign their own names, and some could not do that Charmed with the docility of his pupil, Father Nicholas gave hnn free access to his library, which consisted chiefly in books upon theological subjects, his¬ tories of the saints, and legendary tales of tlie Crusades The deeds of prowess related in the latter charmed the young nobleman, and he would sit by the hour together in Father Nieholas' cell, heedless of the passing time, poring over old black lettered volumes, which contained the description of tilts and tournaments, knights and ladies, and dragons and witches, till his highly e 6
84
wrought feelings, disturbed by the en¬ tiance of the father, would ' vanish into airy nothing " Fathei Nicholas would sigh as he L,uzed upon the glowing cheek and spaikling eye of his enthusiastic pupil. Such had been the late Eail ol Raven¬ spui, whose untimely late (ht being killed unfoitunately m a tournament) had filled bis dependants with gnel, and caused the death of his lady, who, aftei hearing the melancholy intelligence, was suddenly taken in labour, and lived but to give birth to htr second son, Lord Ileniy Ravenspur, and then ex pned One evening the monk found Raven¬ spur wrapped in profound thought, the youth was then about fourteen yeais old, he had clad himself hi the sil.allest suit of mail which he could find iu bis armouiy, and his handsome biow was hidden by the piessure of a finely
8а
wrought helmet, which had been pie sented to his grandfathci by John of Γι ance I was thinking fathei, said the musing boy that I have uo parent to teach me the use of arms, and though I love books, I should not like to be come a monk No ıeplıed the father smiling , monks do not wear helmets and coats of mail but it is time my boy should sec the woild 111 write to the Eail Titzhugh he was thy father s friend, aud will be thine Thou shalt see the world, my boy thou shalt appear at couit, and rival half tbe youths who wait on Richard ' Ah, father resumed Ravenspur, springing from bis seat, and giasping the monks aim, ab, father in truth thou art my fathei now This coat of mail is not much too large, and the helmet needs but new wadding in the crown to be made to fit I long, he
86
cried, grasping a epcar, " to try the strength of this right arm. ' The monk smiled and sighed, as he replied " Thou art a brave boy—but me thinks I heai the tread of horses ' Ravenspur listened, and m a few moments the horn at the gate sounded Ravenspur rusbed to the portal, and though encumbered by the armour he had chosen, he soon reached the gale of the barbican, and there beheld a goodly tram. His eyes sparkled with delight, *' now, m good truth, they are enow to enliven my solitude, ' for his brother, Lord Henry Ravenspur, had been sent to court, in the tram of the Earl of Dartmond, that he might make his fortune The warder having as certtuned that the intruder was no less a guest than King Richard the Second himself, then only two years older than young Ravenspur, gave notice to his Lord of the approach of his illustrious
87
visitor The latter advanced in his cumbrous coat of mail, and kneeling on one knee, welcomed his Sovereign to his castle. Richard was, however, so amused at thequeci figure of the Earl, whose fine eyes were almost obscured by his hel¬ met, that he burst mto a fit of un¬ seemly laughter , which so offended tht Lord of the castle, that be rose hastily, and was retiring, when the King s voice arrested him " Stay, Ravenspur," said his High¬ ness, " I crave youi pardon. You would not forget the laws of hospitality, when we, your sovereign sue for shelter for the night " Father Nicholas fortunately caught the eye of his beloved pupil, and by a single glance restored him all his self-possession Ravenspur in grace¬ ful words gave his king welcome ; and Richard having crossed the drawbridge, entered the great court of the castle,
88 and then for the first time he observed Father Nicholas, and beckoned to him to advance " Benedicite said the fnai, crossing himself, ' this is an honour, unlooked loi by the Earl of Ravenspur. Youi Highness will paidon his lack of court¬ ly breeding, but it is а brave youth my liege, and well would grace а com t " Tather, resumed tlw monaich, with assumed gravity, ' you teach, I hope, that you do not practice, the war like figuie of your noble kmght,' and here the smile which lurked m his eye, involuntanly again played round his lips, as he glanced at the extraordinaiy figure of Ravenspur, who was hui rymg along the couit yard, that he might nd him self of his unwieldy accoutrements He, however, had too much respect for them to throw them hastily away , and he carefully hung up the suit of mail with some difficulty, and was reaching to-
89
wards the top of the pole, where the bel met was wont to rest, when Richaid en tei ι d the hall ' Ravenspui, cued the King, " you baveagoodly show of aimourhere' ' " My liege, replied the youth, "my ancestois, as Father Nicholas has told me, were used to carry oft the prize of valour, as many of these suits can tes¬ tify That belonged to the Duke of Menton , this Mooush suit to a Sara¬ cen, whom Reginald, fiist Earl of Ra¬ venspur, slew in Palestine, this was woin by my grandfdthei in the battle of Cresscy, and the suit beside it belong¬ ed to Hugh bt Foix, a knight whose deeds of aims were known and valued, where valoui was proverbial " " Giamercy ' ' ınteııupted the mo nartli, " but you play the oratoi, Ra- vtnspur lflbou shouldst fight as well as thou canst speak, woe betide the kmght that dares encountei thee "
90
Ah iny liege ' said Ravenspui walking proudly by the suits of mail ' the si„ht of spoils like these, won by the biaveiy of oui forefathers, would make a cowaid biave, and give hnn tongue to swear, that day noi night would he take iest till he achieved a name worthy of Ins sires Now by St Paul, my be 0 e, my heart pants for deeds of arms, and might I hope that youi Giace would not deny my suit, I had a boon to trave " Speak out, brave Ravenspui, speak out, I'll not say nay, unless our uncle Lionel cries halt.' Ravenspur had been so engrossed by the subject which had occupied bis thoughts for the last twelve months, and by tbe hope that now dawned in Ins mmd lhat his most ardent wish should be gratified, that he had not paid his re speets to any of the suite of Richard. Burning blushes now dyed his ingenuous
91
cheeks, when, gracefully advancing, he bent his knee to Lionel and craved his pardon ' Gallant youth, said the Prince, ex¬ tending his hand to Ravenspur, " I knew thy sire, and loved him too Rise, apologies are needless These suit« ol mail, recalling to me the memories of heroes, vvould make me blind and deaf to all but them Now lead us where we may rest our weary limbs,—for we have nddenhaid to day—and where we may attack thy venison Lead on, brave boy, and by my knighthood, Richard, this noble youth must to court with us, what says my liege, think you not the reverend father must resign an office which well he has fulfilled » ' Rithaid answered in the affirmative , and Ravenspur was in an extacy of joy, when he found he was really going into that woild, which was full of gallant lordsand lovely ladies, of brave knights
92
and proud nobles, and accoi dingly bu summoned his principal attendants round lum, and bade them make piepaiutions lor Ins departure on the monow Sorrowful looks and dejected counte nances were now seen m the castle, foi the Earl's domestics and retainers doated on their youthtul Lord A thousand pray¬ ers were said foi his welfare, a thousand blessings were invoked upon his head ; and when the morning dawned every one was at his post Father Nicholas passed the night in the castle, and early he roused his young friend from his light slumbers, and with much affection and solicitude, bestowed some pai ting advice upon the youth he had so fondly che¬ ushed Ravenspur promised nevei to folget the advice of bis early and most valued friend, and assuied him he would often communicate with Inni When his Highness had breakfasted, Ravenspui took a friendly leave of his domestics, and he parted from Fathei
93
Nicholas with tears Clod too, the foo!, who had been his companion in all his «ports, received a distinguishing mark of his mastei 's affection After he had crossed the drawbridge, and he was the last of the tiam he turned towards the fathei, and the old man, much aflected, again gave his Be¬ nedicite, then bending his steps towards his monastery, he retired to his cell to compose himself, that lie might mi et his Superıoı with becoming reverence and self-possession Ravcnspur in the mean while was re- 'oıcıng in his departure from the walls of his ancestois, yet he turned round upon reaching an eminence, which was the last that commanded а view of that mansion in which he had passed his boyish days, and took with a «igh α İmal glance at the ancient toweis Soon, however, the suriounding objects occu¬ pied his attention, and the gaiety of the monarch and his young courtiers dis-
94
peised this tiansitory gloom As they approached the capital, Ravenspur s de¬ light increased, not only at the gay dis¬ play of the lords and knights who came to meet the monaich, but α degree ot pleasure tbulled tlirough bis nerves ns he found himself the object of inquiry, to those oidei and noblci than himself Old John of Gaunt asked who tbat gal¬ lant youth was by Ricbaid s side ? tbe Duke of York s attention was attiacted by the same object, and the Eail of Fitzhugh approached the blushing youth, and inquired bis name " Ra venspur/ was the modest reply, and the woid " Ravenspur ' ' buist from the lips of the old Fitzhugh in accents of de¬ light " Ravenspui ' he repeated, " the son of my honoured fnend and deaiest lord ' Ah, my brave boy, thy noble mien proclaims thy lineage. Thou shalt abide at Fitzhugh s home thou shalt be to me а son " This greeting, so flattering, was over-
95
heard by Richaid " Ah, iny good Lord Fitzhugh, ' said the youthful monarch, " you would not 10b me ot my fuend ? ' " No, my liege," resumed Fitzliugh " I would but offei hnn my roof to call bis home. He shall attend your High¬ ness s commands at all tunes when it meets youi pleasure" Rav enspur w as anxious to accompany Fitzhugh home, foi he was diffident of his own powei s, and knew how to value a fuend like the uoble Earl, while the lattei, charmed with the ingenuous sim¬ plicity of tbe youth, lavished on him a father s fondness The young Earl was nevei weary of listening to the advice of his new fiieud, and lie panted to distinguish himself m some way which should make lum wor thy of the love and conlideuce of so no¬ ble α patron He soon tired of tbe dis sipstion of the court, and when one twelvemonth had elapsed, it happened that a French knight, called Coeur-de-
96
Roy, who had been sent by bis sovereign to Richard's court, was on tho point of returning to his native laud This knight was of distinguished bravery and ho¬ nour , and Fitzhugh advised young Ra¬ venspur to solicit permission of the King to visit France for a time, under the pro¬ tection of this celebrated knight Rich ard was somewhat offended at lhe re¬ quest, but he at length jave lus consent Ravcnspur now made α hasty visit to the north, to take his farewell of Father Nicholas The monk detained lum two days, when Ravenspur took leave of his valuable fuend, and returned to London, where he joined Cceur de-Roy They |oumied towarels Dover leisurely, and there embarked for Calais Nothing remarkable occurred at Pans, and Coeur-de Roy having paiticular bu¬ siness in the South of France, Ravenspur accompanied him thither. When they arrived at Marseilles, the French knight proposed they should make an excursion
9?
into Spain, and go to Burgos, whithei John of Gaunt bad repaired, in conse quence of an amicable arrangement be tween John the First, King of Castile, and the English Prince, who had been persuaded to telinquisb his picteiisions to the crown of that kingdom Gi cat preparations had been making for some time in this city, foi the so lemmzation of the nuptials of Henry, eldest son of the Castillan monarch, with Catheiine, daughter of John of Gaunt Spam was at this time a coun¬ try particulaily celebrated for deeds ol arms, the constant wars between the Moors and Chnstians cherished the spi nt of chivalry, and when either of these two people held solemn festivals, knights from each kmgdoin mingled in fnendly stufe, and contended for the meed of glory It chanced that several Moonsh knights had repan ed tb Buigos to bieak a lance with the Cbnstian knights upon VOL ι F
94 this grand occasion, and among the ι est a younger son of Mahomet, king of Grenada He was α handsome youth brave, noble and generous, but so much younger than all the Chustian knights, that none, fiom couitesy, would enter Ihc field against Inm. Upon the ai uval of Cœui de Roy aud Ravenspui, John of Gaunt hastened to inform the youthful Earl, tbat now was the time to distinguish himself " 1 said the gallant Lancastei ' will bo thy mastei in the art of ai ms, and this young Moousli Prince and thou shalt have a bout togethei, what says my Ravenspui - Ravenspui was so overjoyed at the prospect befoie lum, that he could seaicely say, " My heait panls to meet him ' "Now by the holy rood thou shewest a noble spn it, boy, aud this young Prince and thou shalt make thy first essay in anos befoie the bravesl company that ever graced а court oi

entered lists Knights from nil coun- tues aie ussembled hero, but all too generous to attack the youthful gallant Moorish Prince, who even now weeps that he has no foe ' John ol Gaunt then hastened to the King of Castile, and told hun ull that had passed , and the two Punces felt an tutei est in the approaching contest, which hied both the youthful candi¬ dates foi honour, with impatience foi Ihe day which was to decide their skill and prowess An immense aiea having been railed in, the lists weic maiked out, round which the King and all Ins princes and nobles, both foreign and native, with knights trom all nations, anxiously awaited the arrival of the gallant youths Ravenspur had scarcely allowed himself time to sleep since the Duke of Lan¬ caster had first named the contest The Mooush Punce, with equal ardour, had í 2
100
practised with his friends till they were weary of his importunity When the trumpets sounded, Raven¬ spur, on a milk white steed, Ins beaver up, entered the lists, and bowing gracefully as he ι ode round tbe area, wou tbe hearts of all preseut Having made the circuit, he dismounted, and took his seat at one end of lhe lists The ti umpet sounded again, and on а cream coloured charger of true Arabian breed the Moorish Prince entered, and going through the same ceremony as his fnendly opponent, took his seat at the opposite end Murmurs of applause ran through the admiring circle, and while the Christian knights fixed their eyes on their cham pion with anxious hopes for his success, they could not refrain from feeling some tbing like а pang at the idea that tbe gallant Moorish Punce should be dis graced The feeling was the same
ΙΟΙ
with icgard to the Moois the ladies were anxious the strife should not pro ceed, being interested equally foi each gallant youth. But Ravenspui and his opponent, too enget for the trial, would not listen to such a proposal, and upon the sound of the trumpet they mounted their hoises and spurring them ou, they met with equal foice A silence the most profound had succeeded to the tumultuous buz which had so lately tilled the air For some tune the contest was kept up with equal skill and bravery, but at length Raven¬ spui unhorsed his enemy, unable how evei to command his own impetuous coursci who leaped the fence, and boie hnn from the lists, he lost the pnze of ν ictory Covered with burning blushes, the young Moor rose, but finding him self still in possession of the field, his consciousness retuined, and he offered to attack the gallant Ravenspui,' foi so he tei med hım, " on foot " But
102
their friends objected to this proposal, and Ravenspur having chastized his horse, which had thus deprived him ot the prize (a chaplet from the hand of Queen Eleanor), was joined by Lan¬ caster, who leading bim m the one hand and the youthful Moor in the other, to King John's presence, bade them kneel down, and the gracious monarch gently laying his sword first on the shoulder of Ravenspur and then on the princely Moor, " bade thein rise and be knights in God's name " A splendid ball and entertainment closed the day's sport, and while the Earl of Ravenspur re marned m Burgos, he and the Moorish Prince were linked together in bonds ot closest amity Upon the return of Ra venspur to England, Fitzhugh intro duced his daughter to the new made knight. The lady Geraldine had been secluded m а monastery, and Fitzhugh now fondly hoped that Ravenspur would see her in the same flattering light as
103
he himself His wish was gratified tor Ihe young Earl no sooner saw her than he loved Nor wae Geialdine insensible to the handsome person of the accom¬ plished Ravenspui But the Earl wished to tiy their love, and as Lionel was going to Italy to tetch his bride, he pro¬ posed that Ravenspui should accom pany him This was a severe trial to both the lovers, they had known each othei but а few shoit months, and now to pait so soon, was most unwelcome news But Fitzhugh was ι esolute, promising, however, that upon the re¬ turn of Ravenspur to England, he would consent to give him the lady Geraldine as his bride. Ravenspui gave these details of his eaily life at the ι equest of Lionel, who was exceedingly pai tmi to hım, and de¬ lighted in shewing foith his abilities and valour upon all occasions Little did he suppose that he was fanning α flame m lus ladys bosom, which had already f 4

made havock in her peace, and threaten ed moie serious consequences With delight Victonne listened to the recital we have just given, magnifying in hci own mind every action of the man she loved, till he appeared in hei eyes more than mortal A victim to this ill fated passion, the Princess felt a depression of spirits which shecould not resist In vain Lionel exert ed himself to amuse her, anddivei t her at tention, as he imagined, from the recol lection of her native land, to which he attributed her dejection The only con¬ solation Victonne had, was to shut herself up with Antoinette in herown apartment, and give vent to unavailing sorrow The communication of her feelings to this faithful creature appeared to relieve hei woe fraught heart, foi to her, and hei alone, she could freely speak upon a subject that racked her soul with an guish The idea of ι caching Engl*, id and of Ravenspur s marriage with ano

On his right arm was tieraldine's scarf ; and bis shield bore the device of the raven ho¬ vering over a dove ; and his motto " lo the death." His charger was o*. Spanish breed, cream-coloured ; his eyr ol' lire, and blood-shot nostril, liespoki· bis race. Proudly he tossed his bead ; and as with slow and measured pace In;
145
made the circuit of the area, he pawed the giound, and seemed to snuff the battle from afin Behind Ravenspur came Lord Henry, clad iu а black suit of aunom, richly in¬ laid with silvei on bis ciesttd helm a mixed plumage of black and white wa¬ ved gratefully, and his shield was orna mented with tbe raven, encircled with the following motto " My time will come These noblemen and knights were fol¬ lowed by a long tram, to the number of sixty gentlemen, all splendidly attired, mil well mounted, all inspired by the piesence of their ladies, or the hopes of being able to bear away the prize of ,lory, to lay at the feet of those who nere in far distant climes The ti umpet having sounded, each I night took his station , but, to Raven¬ spur s sui puse, he found himself oppo¬ sed to his brother He stopped his horse m the midst of his career, and turned vol i u
146
him on one side, but Henry called out to him to advance, Ravenspur, however refused, when Lord Henry checking his hoise, approached his brother at agen¬ ţie pace, saying, " Ruvenspur, I must bieak a lance with you to day tieat me not as a boy, as though you teared your potent arm must level me in the dust You have hitherto borne off the prize, 'tis true, but уош arın ıs not, as I pre¬ sume, invincible to the test I chal¬ lenge you before this noble company ' Ravenspur still declined the contest till Lord Hemy observed scornfully " perhaps you think my arm the strong est, and yield the point, if so, I must perfoice relinquish the contest ' Stung by this sarcasm, Ravenspur ie plied " Henry, 'tis well you aie mj brother, foi never did I yield to mortal man But since you will have it so, so it must be take youi station, not as ι brother, but as a stranger knight " Lord Henry wheeled his courser round
147 ind glancing at Ins wife an expressive look, lushed with so much eagerness to the attack, that his hoise stumbled quickly, howevei, lie ι egained his loot¬ ing, and so stiange did it appeir, even to then companion knights, that bro¬ thels should engage in this fi icndly strife, that in a short tune all were resting their lances, and they alone weie engaged With pallid cheek and fixed eye, Geral¬ dine gazed upon her lord , while Ange¬ lina, her whole soul animating ber hne countenance, appeared to pant as eagoily for the fight as hci hot headed husband Foi some tune the contest appeared doubtful, and the spectatois in silence watched the event Lord Henry pro¬ ceeded at fibt with caution, while Ra¬ venspur acted solely upon the defensive M length the foimei became mitated at the detei mined neutrality of his brother, and he attacked him with more energy, and less skill, still Ravenspur only par¬ ried his thrusts till the increasing h2
14Ь
warmth of his bi other conv meed bimbe must, for bis own gioì y s sake, foi the «ако of bis ancient beieditary honours, enter the lists in good earnest against Loid Henry The scene was so unexpected, and so interesting, that the most profound still uess reigned not only on the coui t sidi of the area, but among the knights and the populace, and when Ravenspur be gan to display his skill and power, the ladies ıeached forward withstiainedeye-! and breathless silence, to watt h eveı\ tuin ot the conflict Lord Henrv at length collecting all his strength, seem ed lesolved on annihilating Ins brothei but his own eagerness proved lus dis grace for Ravenspur now seeing th it there was more than α fnendly stille ti encountei, watched his opportunity, anil profited by it so discieetly, that ere Hen ij was aware of his brother s intention lie was unhorsed. Ravenspur then ven cooly turned his com ser round, and took
149
bis formei station at one end of the lists Shouts of tnumph now rent the air, and the knights crowded round the con queror, foi they had seen and duly ap pieciated his forbeaiance The sports were inteirupted for a time by tins unlooked-for event, and the King expressed something like displeasure m the hearing of Norfolk, who fanned the llame by observing, " that the dishonour of one member of a family reflected on all the rest " " Now by my knighthood, replied the Earl of Fitzhugh, " Ravenspur has done most gallantly, for he did that which neither you nor I, my Lord, it seems, can do—he subdued lumsell Your Highness saw how he declined the contest, and let that hot headed boy take the consequence of bis íash folly What, methinks he has seen full oft the prowess of that same right arm, and by my truth he uow has felt it '
150
" We hke not this," said the King, turning his back upon the ancient Earl, whose small grey eye flashed hre, as moving quick away, he quitted his station, and approached his son-in-law Grasping his band, he in few words told Ravenspur he should return to the north, " and leave m> child behind me, ' he ad¬ ded , " but 1 leave her with this right arm to shield her from contempt, from wrong, and from oppression Fare ye well, my gallant son " " Stay, my Lord," replied Ravenspur , " I must know the cause of your depar. ture Has aught occurred my arm can—" " No, no," interrupted the Earl, 'tis nothing but a phantasy ; I am tired of bemg a spectator, where I was wont to play the brave. Farewell, my Lord so soon as this same pageant's ended, and that thou canst obtain permission, thoul't not forget Fitzhugh will long foi thy re¬ turn to the northern quarter of our Isle The castle of Ravenspur will scarce be
151
large enough for thee and Henry since this bout ' Ravenspur coloured as he ıeplıed," the castle of Ravenspur shall never be de. sérted by its lord Tut, my noble sire, this was but a chafing bout between me and Henry " " Well,' resumed Fitzhugh " I am glad thou thinkst so, yet, ere I go let me advise thee beware of Norfolk he is a serpent in thy path, and bosom friend of Henry " Ravenspui looked amazed as the Earl continued thus " Thou hast frequented camps more than courts, dear Lord, thy unsuspicious nature has much to learn so now again farewell " Before Ravenspur could collect bis thoughts to fashion а reply, FiUhugh was gone, and ere another hour had elapsed the venerable Earl had lett the precincts of the metropolis When Ra¬ venspur joined the court in the evening, to partake of the pleasures of the ball, h 4

he fancied he peiceived α degree of cold¬ ness m Richards manner, and that of his Queen He was willing, howevei, to allow it was only imagination, yet it was evi¬ dent that Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and Lancastei, and Hereford, were more attentive to him than they were wont this shewed something like party, for Noifolk dttathed himself closely to the King, and so did Lord Henry, the latter was most pointedly favoured , and Ange¬ lina was in conversation with the Queen nearly the whole of the evening The lady Geraldine, who had hitherto been honoured with most decided marks ot prefeience, was scarcely noticed nnd Victonne peiceiving this, approached the dignified Countess, and requested her Highness would for a shoit time spare her favounte The Queen bowed an as¬ sent, and, conducted by the Duchess of Clarence, Geraldine joined hei hus¬ band, who had been so deeply engaged

in conversation with Lionel, that he bad not peiceived the slight which bad been put upon Ins lady Upon seeing hi ι approach, accompanied by Ihe Duchess, something like the tiuth beamed upon his mind The blood ι ushed to his cheek, and defiance flashed from his countenance, as he caught the exulting look of Angelina Victonne, who saw the seeds of dis sention thus sown between the two bro thers, who was well acquainted with the disposition of her countrywoman, heavtd a sigh, and silently ejaculated а prayer foi Ravenspui s safety To the gentle Geraldine she insensibly became attach e 1, and hei allection for the Eai I, though u э less stiong, assumed a purer cast, she ıesolved to use her influence with Lionel, if it should be necessaiy, foi the support of Ravenspur The departuie of Fitzhugh had given much cause ot offence to the King Rich¬ ard foi got that his nobles weie wont to h5
154
resent with impunity the smallest insult given by monarchs, but on the present occasion he had been particularly irrita¬ ble The pleasures of the day had been interrupted , and the insinuations of one or two ot the courtiers had blinded him as to who was the first aggressor The artful Italian, Angelina, had clung to the Queen when hei husband fell, and entreated her protection, if her Lord had fallen to rise no more she wept too, and withdrew, lamenting the im petuosity of Ravenspur s disposition, " which had more than oucei ' she αϊ firmed, " embroiled him at the court of Milan, and frequently exposed Lord Henry to a treatment unbecoming a member of the house of Ravenspur ' Before this memorable evening closed, she wound herself completely round the affections of the Queen, and from this day forth she forsook her former mis tress, and became the chosen companion and favourite of her Highness
155
When the party broke up for the night, the King gave a formal good¬ night to Ravenspur and his lady, and the two latter returned to their apart¬ ments, weaned with the day s exertion, and disgusted with the intngues and dis¬ content of a court

DttjtcAK ΊΙ119 castle 1 nO α i)Ieuant site tho шг липЫу arni sweetly recommends itself unto our gentler tenses Macbeth The morning which followed this memorable day had scarcely dawned, when Ravcnspur and his lady repaired to chapel, and heard mass privately Gei aldine had hitherto appealed ш her lord's eye but as a beauttlul woman in the conversation, howevei they held together after mass, she proved herself an able adviser, as well as a charming companion. The conduct of Angelina had been closely observed by Geraldine the pre¬ ceding day, she had felt, and keenly too, the slight ber royal misti ess bad shewn her, and the exultation of the
157
haughty Italian upon that occasion The peisevenug obstinacy ot Lord Heniy, to her discerning mmd, betrayed moie of hate, than the iuendiy strite m deeds of aims, and though her gentle spnit shrunk from the alarming thought that blood might follow, she yet in tunul accents wained her loid that dangei was at hand Ravenspur at first smiled at hci alarms, but as she became more animated, her arguments gained strength Himselt eould not but own that certain facts were undeniable, yet his generous heai t lepelled the thought, and, soothing the teais and quieting the suspicions ot his lovely bude, he bade bei trust to his dis¬ ci etion, to bis own unsullied conduct, and the reputation he had gained in aims both at home and abroad, as safeguavds, which placed him beyond the reach of majesty itself " Will you, my lord," resumed his bride, " will you listen to my warning
158
voice when my woman's fears see cause for just alarms? " Trust me, sweet, I will/ replied the enamoured Ravenspur, "and be sure of this, thou shalt be my leading star, for well 1 see in that blue eye, that though thy woman's fears may tempt thee to dread alarms when none are nigh, yet that thou wouldst not counsel aught should bring dishonour on the names of brave Fitzhugh and Raven¬ spur " " No, by tbe holy rood, ' replied tbe lady Geraldine, " no, my brave Raven¬ spur, thou shall find thy wife is worthy of such a sire, and such a husband But remember the truly brave are prudent Ravenspur kissed her glowing cheek as she concluded, and tbey then prepared to attend the court It were needless to enter into the de¬ tails of the machinations of Lord Henry andhislady against Ravenspur Through the means of the Duke of Norfolk, Lord
159
Henry had acquired an uncommon in Huenee over Richard the Second, but he no sooner felt himself securely fixed in his Highness' favoui, than he gradually forsook lus foi mer friend, and so com¬ pletely worked upon the timid mind of Richard, tliat he alone enjoyed his pn¬ vate ear While Loid Henry was thus paving the way to his future rise, his lady gained that ascendancy over the Queen, which а strong mmd naturally acquires over one of an infeiior cast, and she moulded her mistress to her will Yet, though honours were offered to Lord Henry, he declined them all for his power, his fortune, however great, would still be that of a youngei son, so long as Ravenspur reigned master in lhe halls ofjhis ancestors No title m the mind of Lord Henry, however high sounding, was equal to that of his own ancient and powerful family To be loid of Ravenspur, and all its vast do- mams, —this was the point to which all
160
his hopes were bent, and this the focus of nil his worldly views The King had not penetration enough lo discover, under the feigned humility of Lord Heiuy, that ambition reigned paiamount, he therefore applauded his moderation, his disinterested attach¬ ment, and generous devotion of his time and person to the king Ins mastei An¬ gelina, too, wore the mask of deep humi- nnlity, and thus obtained a complete ascendancy ovei ber misti es a «is n ill upon the most tutling as the more 1111 portant points The lady Victonne saw with guef ot heart, that Ravenspui and his bude became daily more unwelcome guests at court, and Lionel, who was vexed at the little discernment shewn by lus nephew, proposed to Ravenspur tint tbey should repair for а tirne *o bis castle in Yoikshne " My lord * ' said Lionel, " invite Titzhugh to join us, and there in thine
161
pxtelisive wide domam we can enjoy our liberty Here our minds as well a» bodies are pent up and scarcely dare to think 111 to the King and tell hun our mtent. Old Lancaster and Hereford shall join our party, and there we II revel it bravely, and make wai upon the deei No treason that, as I piesume But why does not the lady of the castle give us a welcome ? ' Victorme answered for the troubled Geraldine, by saying, ' My good lord, you talk of Lancaster and Hereford were it not as well that they should not accompany us *> The«e are strange times, and though you smile, when I cry halt, alas ' my lord would to hea¬ ven we had no cause to halt ' " Now by my molhei s son, and that s myself, my Victorme plays the ti uant, ıeplıed theDuke, " why what cause have we to fear ? Let Richaid come and, it he likes, let Hemy too—we shall be uiow to give them welcome, come they I in, or come they foul Nay, Victonne,
162
thou hast lost thy spirit, sweel, and, by my troth, thy colour too Our northern clime suits not thy tender frame, and when we ve paid our duty in the north, we 11 e cu return to Italy, I like thy warm and glowing sky Our absence here may do good service to our fnends We are near the throne, and kings love not their heirs " The lady Geraldine wa° precisely of the same opinion as \ictorine, ehe thought it dangerous, at the present crisis of affairs to foim so decided a party as the assembling of these dıştın guished personages at the castle of Ra venspur, wbo were at this moment little in fevoLr with Richard How to avoid this danger was the next consideration but bei imagination, in general fertile in resources, failed her, and she felt com pelled to acknowledge there was indeed no alternative left for them, since Lionel himself had made the proposal Their departure from London was made known to the Kmg, who without
163
any evident mark of disapprobation or approbation, took a farewell ol Raven¬ spui and his lady To his uncle Cla rence he made some comment as to the fatigues о state being changed foi those of the chase , then tui mng to the Duchess he continued, " But lhat you, fair cousin, should quit the sunshine ot the court foi the dull routine of coun¬ tiy life, is stiange, yet I hear that Ravenspur mvites a goodly company to cheer your solitude Lancaster and Hereford, and others of like tried loy¬ alty. The chase is a dangerous game, let tbem look to it, they may chance o'ersboot the maik." " Your Highness," replied Clarence, " is jocular, nevertheless if our presence be necessary to your—" " Not at all," Richard quickly re¬ plied , " Norfolk and 1 have planned a sporting scheme, as well as you , Lord Henry Ravenspur has joined oui party thus we hunt on equal terms, and the
164
lovely Angelina shall grace oui spoils, and take tbe place of our Italian cousin Well, success attend youi sports, we will not mar them —adieu, kind uncle, and my loving youthful aunt When next we meet, 1 tiust the rose s bloom will animate thy cheek, for by my boh dame your Grace looks wan, as though this northern journey had scared the colour from thy lips—thy cheeks." Victonne's face was suffused with the blush of indignant pride as she replied , " I have found your courtly clime, my liege, uncertain as men's mmds The steady cold and bracing winds of the more northern parts of this fair isle, though cold, if uniform, may be more easily endured, than where it burns and freezes m the self same day Youi Highness will pardon me, when I return you'll find me like the rest of this gay crowd, perhaps. But farewell, my liege, farewell lady and cousin," she conti¬ nued, as she addressed the Queen, and
165
then turning to Angelina, with an ex¬ pressive glance she added, " farewell, Angelina, peihaps to meet no more ' Angelina for one instant felt abashed , hei ingratitude towaids her fonner mis¬ tress struck cold upon her heart, but quickly iccoveung berself, she bade the Duthess farewell m ber ovn native language Sounds, once so familial, caused an liidcscubable sensation in the bosom of Victonne, and bowing giatt- fully to the assembled touit, she ap proached htr husband, and they left the palace together Liontl could ill suppress Ins feelmgs upon this occasion but Victonne pressed his aim, and they hastily joined Ravenspur and lus lady, who had taken leave of their Iligli- n sses before Then jouiney to the uoilh was per ft-med gradually by all the party till they arrived withm one day s îoui ney , when Ravenspui and his lady iodi on before their gnosis, whom they left in
166
the chaige of their csqmres and other letalners Jacques attended his Lord from the zeal he had shewn m their ser vice, upon moie occasions than one he had been appointed to the honouiable situation of what would now be called, " My loid s gentleman," that ofhce, m those distant times, had howevei no dis tinguislung name, but it was a post most anxiously coveted and highly ıespected Jacques had devoted himself entirely to the sei vice of his lord, and resisted all the attempts of Jacquelma, who had endeavoured by eveiy means m her powei to induce hnn to enter the laelj Angelinas service Lord Henry was exceedingly anxious to attach this man to his letinue, for he conceived he was a bold dai ing fellow, who from his for¬ mei habits of ι apine might easily be persuaded to peilorm a deed of blood if necessary From Angelina he had heard the particulars of several daring deeds of the robbers of the Apennines,
167
and he was unwilling so biave а spint as Jacqups should be lost Ior want of employ Jacques was however mflexi ble he protended for а length ot lime not to understand the drift of Jaquelina, and when iu plam terms she pioposed he should change masters, he flatly re fused compliance Even Angelina had lavished many marks ot favoui upon this fellow, and Loid Пеш у himself had frequently addressed him with familiar and fnendly Ian H uage. But then at tempts to seduce linn from Ins loyalty were all in vain, Jacques was ena moured, if we may use the expiession, with the biaveiy of his loid, and the beauty and sweetness of Ins lady The castle of Ravenspui w α situated on an eminence, commanding α view ol the sea shore and the town of Raven spur It was an ancient and magnili cent building, supeuoi in many ìespects to buildings of that kind, geneially speaking, foi its owner had imbibed a
168
taste for many of the luxunes of a southern clime. The appioaeh to it lay tlnough а thick wood of chesnut and oak trees Tour reads led to the castle, termi¬ nated each in an immense area, and lacing four large poi tals, flanked bv toweis on each side A fosse of con¬ siderable breadtu suriounded the build ing, and α diawbudge gave admittance to the principal gateway, winch was of potine aicliitecture As 'oon as the gates were opened, there appeared on each side of the arched way two of the retainers of the castle, clad in the armour of the tunes, and standing in inches, which the thick¬ ness of the walls peinntted The spa cious court the tiavellers now entered was ciowded with retainers, forming a line loi the illustrious guests to pa-ss lluougli till they reached the grand door of entrance to the castle itself A spacious hall then piesented itself, gal
1бч
laiitly decked with suits of armour, stags hoins, and even heads of that noble animal, as well as of boars and other beasts of the chase , the flooi was oak, and at one end of this apartment blazed a huge lire, a checung sight in autumn The seneschal of the castle ushered them into a dining pai lour which bad been prepared particularly tor the reception of royal visitants The chans weie of carved ebony, the table oak , the dogs befoie the blazing heap of fuel which cheeied the dusky walls were ot silver, and over the chimney piece was α stag s head of an enormous size Many of the wine bot¬ tles, which were of delft, bore the dates of 1158 and 1232 The drinking cups were of all sorts and sizes, those which were placed at the head of the table were of gold and silver, many of the otheis were horn-cups tipped with those p-eeious metals, while others vtoe ι ι
170 aguni retained the natuial ionu of а tow s hoin At one end of Ibis apaitment were large folding doors which opened mio a gotlnt aichway of beautiful woik- inanslup , in the middle of this passage was suspended a himp, and at the lui thei end of it was another dooi, which led into the chapel The chapel was a mastei - piece of its kind , it was illumined by а large gothic window, richly blazoned with the arms of the family, the altar beneath it was covered with eumson velvet the candlesticks, the censors, and the cups weie of gold A cano¬ pied seat on either side of this aitai was appropiiated to the heads of the family, Ihe middle pait of the saeied budding was furnished with benches Two small chapels opposite to each othei gave the building the form of a cross, one of these was called " the Lady's Oiatoiy," foi in it Hit
m
ladies ol the castle always confessed, it was furnished with a confessional chan loi that puipose, and was fitted up with magnificence, and fronted with α beautiful sci ecu The opposite cha¬ pel was called ' the Kmght s Ch ipel, ' because the foundei of this elegant building was buned beneath it, his figuro ni iude e(fi a y, caived in stone, lay at full length m the middle ot it, and boie an insci iption mentioning his name and degiee, and mtieating tbc prayeis of the pious for his soul A cncumstancc afteivvaids happened in this chapel which gave it a peculiar degiee of interest but of this liei eafter Aftei the company had icfreshed themselves with (he splendid fai e before them, they ìetued to the withdia vmg room, leaving the letamers to revel it alone Passing up а laige oak stair¬ case, they entered а spacious apartment hung with the most superb tapestry, the chairs weie ol ebony, richly caived, ι 2
172
and inlaid with mother of-pearl two laige tables of the same wood, enriched with the same expensive aiticle, and udoined moreovei with peails, stood between the w indows, over these were looking-glasses of pohshed steel in bead liames, and large silver candlesticks graced the huge chimney-piect The floor was covered with crimson cloth as well as the seats of the chairs, which were ennched by a gold boi dering The sleeping apai tinenta of this stately build ing weie also hung with rich tapes¬ tiy, the bed furniture was ol diflerent coloured cloths, variously relieved by gold and silvei tummings The beds weie moslly formed with а dome top, but that appropriated to Lionel and his lady was composed of crimson velvet and shaped like а canopy , the top wa surmounted with a coronet, and thi royal arms embroideied at the head of the bed The counterpane was of silk and so weie the chan covers, two

massy candlesticks were placed on the su¬ perb ebony table, as well as two drinking cups contauniig the night potion, winch of the rarest wine, hot and highly spiced, was given to guests of a superıoı degree each visitant, however, and inhabitant of the castle, had a cup of the same kind, though less costly, accoidnig to his rank A.nongst those who were π ast olli cious in welcoming Ravenspur and his bride to the stately towers of Ravenspur wasClod theFool, he laboured incessant¬ ly to display his wit foi their amusement, and formed an intimate acquaintance with Jacques, from whom he leaint all that was going on at com t Jacques, who discovered much shrewd discern ment in this fellow, ıesolved to turn his abilities to account, and theiefore treat ed him with more than usual respect Finding that Clod was devotedly attach¬ ed to his master, he, after mature delibe ι 3

' " The fool," re¬ plied Clod, "but he is wise enough to resemble the stag hound he never licks the hand that whips him Ravenspui frowned, but Clod continued thus " he must bear the sting of the whip 'tis tţue, but he flings from it, and the huntei

lures hım back with a smile, and the silly fool is wheedled into submission, so you do me, my Lord, and so they do at couits, for the stag-hound is an animal that fiequeiits the woods, and its raiity in cities, makes it courted, but it is to its own undoing ' " Go to, said the Earl, " go to you talk of couits that ne er bave seen them " They Ulk of heaven who ne'ci will go there, ' rejoined Clod, " tıs so at couit foi there they fear to name it, lest they should be accused of country bleeding Ravenspur waved his band in token ot silence, and Clod retired to the kitchen, where he and Jacques having regaled themselves with a cold pasty and a flag- gon of October ale, began a desultoiy conveisation with the cook and otheis of which the following specimen will give a faint idea " Robert," said Jacques, addiessmg the huntsman, " where didst thou hunt

A short time after the arrival ot' Raven- spur at his castle, his friends proposed ex¬ amining the chapel, for they had been greatly struck by the beauty of its archi¬ tecture It was evening when they en¬ tered the sacred spot, the sun streamed partially through the oriel window, and threw a rich light upon the interior of the building Alight breeze sighed through
182
the luxunant ivy, whieh waving to and fio as impelled by the wind, gave that undulating shadow, so peculiaily beau¬ tiful at all times, but more pai ticularly so when pioduced by the bieeze and an evening sun Victonne was chauned with tbe beauties of theveneiable and sacred place, d clanng that it reminded her of those of Italy but that which most seemed to attract hei attention was the Knight s Chapel " Daughtei/ said Tatlıcı Nicholas, the confessei of the family and biothei of a neighbouung convent of Domini¬ cans, " daughtei, that chapel is indeed a monument woi thy the foundei of this holy building, more honouiable to Ins me¬ mory than the erection of the castle itself While that monument shall last, this noble house shall stand, for though time shall destioy all things, yet— ' " Father, ' ınteııupted Geraldine, not at ill appıovıng of the presumption ol

Father Nicholas took it and read it ovei attentively, it contained the fol¬ lowing words —

185
excite the anger of her lord, who pui- poscly and pointedly evaded the sub¬ iect wbenevei it was mentioned But а heavy foreboding oppressed his lady, and her spirits failed hci in tht impoi - tant duty of entertaining her guests Victonne saw her struggles, and deeply did she participate m them Much of her time, she spent in the chapel m prayers for Raveuspur's sutety, and tri¬ umph ovei his foes, and one day that she was thus employed, Victonne enteied the chapel for the same pioui purpose Their eyes met, suffused in tears, and Victonne overeóme by hei feelings, which as they were necessarily concealed in her own bosom, were more poignant than those of Geraldine, who was justi¬ fied in her anxious love by her duty, fell on the neck of the latter, and burst into an hysteric laugh ' Dear lady," said the unsuspicious Geraldine, " you are not well let me call the leach "
186
" No, no, ' replied tbt Pnncess, " no, no, 1 sliall be well anon My mind is harassed, my health is shaken, and my spints bioken ' Then, aware that she lnd said too much, fiom the expressive look of Ge¬ raldine, she added with a smile, "Fa¬ thei Nicholas, the good old man, will dispel this melancholy I await lum here, I am used, deai lady, to these fits of feeling Be not alai med, I shall soon be well ' "I willnot intrude upon your puvacy," replied Geraldine, " 1 can in my oratoiy pour forth my piayers formy much loved lord Yet Oh, Victonne ' if youi own sonows do not engross you quite, piay for my lord—piay heaven to aveit the vvoes I dread Alas, alas' that vii tue should be exposed to the guilty machinations of the wicked Piay loi me—foi Raven spui, deai lady " The Countess slowly left the chapel as she concluded this speech, and with-

While Ravenspur and his friends were enjoying the pleasuies of the chace, Lord Henry and his lady weie undermining the reputation of the for¬ mer in the mind of the King. Norlolk, who had hitherto been tbe leading star of Lord Henry, now felt, what expe¬ rience has so often verified,.that couit к 3
198
fuendships are like footmarks upon the sandy shore, which the next flow of tide shall eflace, leaving no trace behind of their former existence Yet, apparently to casual observers, this bieach was not very evident, for with the most coi.summate ait Lord Henry wore externally the marks of friendship, but the time was soon to arnve when a fair pretext would offei for breaking oft all connection with this powerful nobleman The butti of α son to Henry about this time caused much happiness to himself and Angelina, and the King and Queeii offering to become sponsors for their infant, the most splendid prepara¬ tions were made for the solemnization of its baptism Intelligence of this event was sent express to Ravenspur, who immediately forwarded л handsome piesent to his brothei upon the occa¬ sion , but as he had received no special invitation to be present at the ap-
199
pioachiiig ceremony, he did not volim tai tly oiler to make a journey to Lon¬ don for that purpose, the more pai ticu¬ larly as the lady Victonne was at this tune alarmingly ill Indeed she appeared evidently to be tast approaching to that state of ill health wbich gave cause of serious alaim to her anxious fnends Having one day, that she felt more than usually unwell, called her favourite attendant, she told her she was convinced that she should never return to Italy again, " and before I die," she added, " I wish to have some communication with Jacques" Antoinette wept, and endeavoured to convince her mistress that she was mis taken in her opinions as to the extent of her disorder "No, my Antoinette," replied the Pnncess, " no, but I have much to ar- ìange, much thatl wish to say to theloid of Raven°pur and his lady To Jacques __ к 4
200
also I have somewhat to communicate, and to you Tell his Grace lhat 1 de¬ mand an inleiview with this good fel¬ low, and as what 1 have to communicate concerns not England noi its King, our interview must be in pnvate " The Pnncess s countenance and man¬ nei assumed α more than usual energy as she spoke, and m silence, but with teai ful eyes, her attendant did bei bidding The Duke ìepaued immediately to his Duchess, and in affectionate lan¬ guage lamented her indisposition, which, he said, " was simply the efiect of the English climate, and he would forth¬ with wnte to Richard, and say he was impatient to return to Italy as the only means of lestonng hei to health " " Youi Grace may spare youiself the trouble," replied Victonne, " it is in vain—the blow is struck, and no balmy breath of spring, wafted even fi om Italy s lair clime, no healing powei of the

202
venspur will fall a victim to intrigue, and the lovely, happy Geraldine shall no longer grace the halls where she now commands as mistress." The Countess s cheek became paler as she spoke " I sliall not live to see this, but my friendship would provide a safe retreat for them, when my still heart, cold as the crystal drops, shall cease to beat, and these poor limbs shall ask no covering but the marble tomb as cold Yet, not to you my lord, will I confide the spot where 111 innocence and peace their days may yet ghde on, till Providence in its own good time shall stay its chastening hand, and bring them back again in triumph to their rude but much-loved home. Exhausted by speaking, the Duchess paused a few moments, while the Duke m profound attention took her hand, and listened as though her voice still nibrated on his ear, when she ceased to speak
203
' I would not, my lord," she íesumed with difficulty, " send for Jacques, with out your knowledge, but from a perfect conviction that if you were present at our interview, it might in after times much injure you, I still declare our conversation must be pnvate " The Duke much affected at the so¬ lemnity of her manner, raised her hand to his lip* and theu withdrew, leaving the Duchess in а state of exhaustion which precluded all idea of her seeing Jacques until the following day About eleven о clock on the succeed¬ ing day, Jacques was ushered into the piesence of Victorme, he had not seen her for some time, and he expressed by his looks how much he was shocked at the alteration in her appearance She smiled as he entered, and after a strug¬ gle with feelmgs excited by the remem¬ brance of the time and events which led to their first acquaintance, she began thus " Jacques, thy attachment to the кб
204
Loid of Ravenspur does thee honour well does he deserve thy love, well does the lovely lady of this castle deserve the toi feit of thy life, if tvvere needlul Jacques placed his band on bis beait, and bowed his head in silence to the Signoia, and she proceeded in the fol¬ lowing words " The variety of this northern clime is not more changeable than the mmds of its rude aud brave inhabitants 1 Raven¬ spur is prudent, but he is also high- minded m love with honour, and trem¬ blingly alive to aught that may impeach that honoui Should (as I foresee it will) the heavens lour upon his pre¬ sent gilded fortunes, thou must prove his friend Listen' dost thou reinem- bei, bejond Milan, a lovely spot, shaded with poplars, birch, the spiral fii, the noble oak, backed by the towering \pefinines, and hid fiom all intruders' gaze, except the chamois huntei s daring toot should tlnthei stray, or hunters of
205
a liereer breed ? Dost thou remember a lowly cot, which hanging on the beetling rock, o erlooks this lovely scene? ' "Noble lady,' replied Jacques, "full well the scene I know, and with reli¬ gious zeal will stake my ble to execute thy wishes ' The Pnncess again proceeded. " I do iitìii"ve thee, Jacques. dost ^tliou suppose thy fonner comrades could be induced to spare the inhabitants ot such a spot, if, poor and pei secuted, tliey there sought shelter from their powerful foes ? ' " The brave Manuel, ' replied Jacques, " would I am convinced pro¬ tect them " "Then, 'resumedthePruicess, 'when Ravenspur's star of glory shall fade away, and he to foreign climes should bend his steps, thithei lead him. Once, and only once I saw this lovely spot, and theu in fear and trembling But inatk me, Jacques, no living soul, not
206 Ravenspur himself shall know his des¬ tination till he is near it That humble cot tommands a distant view of the rob¬ ber s mount, there in secunty he may dwell, while its vicinity to Milan s court may through thy means give him intel¬ ligence of all that s passing here If thou shouldst hve and Ravenspur have sons, whose aspiring spirits shall spui n the mountain chace, and pant for deeds of arms, preserve thou this casket, it contains а signet which Milan or his successor will iot fail to recognize It also contains jewels to some amount,— turn these to gold, when necessity shall need, and for thyself take thou this and keep it for my sake, unless а time shall come that it may be useful in another sense " Jacques knelt upon one knee as he received the casket, and a ring, which the Princess placed upon his finger Then using, and turning towards a crucifix which was suspended over a
207
small altar m the oratoiy, where they then were, he knelt and took a solemn oath never to betiay his trust, or for¬ sake his lord and family " 'Tıs well, ' replied the Princess, hei countenance irradiated by an exult¬ ing smile " I feel thou wilt not forsake thy trust And now begone, be faith- lul, be secret, aud be brave, a time may come he shall requite thy love and trn d fidelity " Jacques bowed respectfully, and left the room deeply impressed with the solemnity of his late interview, and marvelling much how the Duchess could for one instant suppose that the Baron of Ravenspur, surrounded by wealth and honours, should ever need the friendship of so humble a bemg as himself Proud, however, of the con¬ fidence ıeposed in bim, and exalted in his own opinion by this proof of the good opimon of his betters, he retired cautiously to his own apartment, and
as
having bidden the casket, he resolved to devote himself entirely, and faithfully to the service of his loid and family be tuen repaired to the buttery, to assist in the picpaiations which were eaiiymg on for dinner The lady ViUoune in the mean¬ while threw herself upon her couch, and, overcome with fatigue, soon sunk into л sweet sleep In the evening she re¬ quested " that Ravenspur and his lady would oblige bei with an houi s convei¬ sation They obeyed bei summons instantly, and after some trivial and forced conversation, she extended her hand towards Geraldine, and pressing it to her lips fer' ently, she ciossed her¬ self, and apppared to be absoibed for some minutes in earnest prayei Hei countenance had never appeared so beautiful as at this moment The hec tic of fever gave additional lustre to her fine dark eye, which, raised to beav en, seemed lost in the contempla-
209
tion of scenes hidden from mortal ken , hei parled lips disclosed her ivory teeth, aad the smile which played aro u id tbem gave hei whole air somewhat of the appearance of an aeuul visitant A white veil, which was flung care¬ lessly over hei head, fell in graceful folds upon her shoulders, and slightly shidcd her open front In silence, Ravenspui looked upon the lovely being before bim, while the seraphic eyes of Geialdine, following the direction of those of her fuend, shone in liquid lustre, partaking more of heaven than earth Victonne having finished her pious and internal ejacula¬ tion, addressed herself to Ravenspur, dwelling with delight on the first days of their acquaintance, and again and again painting, m the most energetic language, her obligations to him, for his brave geneious and nob'e conduct dunng their adventure among the Apennines The recollection however, of
210
moments so deeply tinctured with senti¬ ments which hud shortened her days, was too much for her. Her eyes closed, and she would have fallen to the ground, had not Ravenspur sprang to ber assis¬ tance. Her insensibility was, however, momentary, and when she recoveru' her mental sensation, she fqr one in¬ stant allowed herself to be supported by that being, so fondly loved, so dearly cherished. Geraldine, affected at the exhausted state in which the poor inva¬ lid appeared, was leaving tbe room to call for the attendant of the Princess ; but the latter, with a face suffused with crimson, hastily bade her return, and having disengaged herself from Raven¬ spur, her head sunk upon her bosom, and she burst into tears. Geraldine approached her, and bade her take good heart. " We will all re¬ turn to Italy, dear lady," said the Countess, the mild air of that lovely paradise will restore thee to thy for-
m
mer health Now, in good truth, my Loid, has not the naming of her own sweet land called back the colour to her cheek, and given her eye a greater lustre? ' ic' ne smiled, but Ravenspur had u the deep recess of an oriel The tear started to his eye a truth rushed upon his mind which the recollection of innumerable circum¬ stances conformed He turned round to look at the wasted, faded being before him, her eyes were fixed on him. He advanced towards her rapidly, and kneeling before her, and by his side kuelt also his much loved bride, upon whose unsuspicious mind the truth ne er glanced Fondly she pressed the languid haud of Victonne, but, starting suddenly from her seat, she cried, "she is dying, Ravenspur," and rushed out of the room, leaving Ravenspur at the teet of the Pnncess Victonne's lips moved her hand was piessed closely
212
on heı heart, heı eyes were raised to heaven , this world appeared to be foi- gotteu, till the voice of Ravenspur called her back to earth " Lady, ' said Ravenspui, " dear and honouied lady, have you no com¬ mands that I could execute ì no wish that I could—" " Yes," quickly replied the Duthess, " and heed me well, beware of Hem y Ravenspur, and trust without reserve in Jacques " The energy with which she uttered these few woids ceased as tliey con¬ cluded her sinking form bent for¬ wards , and as Ravenspur gently raised himself to assist her, the head of the un¬ happy Victonne sunk upon his shoulder. She fixed her eyes on him with a look most eloquently tender, and expressive of love, then softly sighed out her existence, with the pleasing satisfaction of dying within his arms,—carrying, as she thought, her fatal secret to the
213
grave Whether Ravenspur acknow¬ ledged this to himself, remains un¬ known , certain it is, however, that he never named her without emotion, noi without expressing sentiments of the most profound respect The death of the Princess was con¬ sidered sudden and unexpected, and the festivities at the castle of Ravenspur were as suddenly changed mto mourn¬ ing Lionel lamented the loss of his Duthess most sincerely, and couuers were instantly dispatched to the King to inform lum of the death of his youth¬ ful aunt This melancholy intelligence threw a foiced gloom over the precincts of the court, and many an envious be¬ ing, who secretly rejoiced in her death, bore about the mockeiy of woe The remains of the Pnncess were de¬ posited in the chapel of Ravenspur Castle and her funeral service was performed by Father Nicholas. With much difficulty tbe monk performed
214
his office, -and on the following day he fell sick—no one, however, divining the cause of his indisposition. In the course of a few days he recovered so far as to be able to admit Ravenspur, who was on the point of quitting the castle. He assured thu good father that he should frequently hear from him, and after a long conversation, they separated with regret.

When Ravenspur left the royal pre¬ sence, he hastened to his lady His coun¬ tenance half told his tale before he opened his lips. For himself he could have borne disgrace : but tbat he should involve his beloved Geraldine in poverty and sorrow, was a grief which hung heavy on his heart, and clouded his brow with sadness " Ravenspur," said the Countess as he enlered the room, and halted at the door

lor words to biealhe his tidings, ' Ra venspur, the prophecy s fulfilled 11 eud its completion in thy looks Well let the bolt fall wheie it list, thy life is safe, and honour too Misfortune may o ei take thee, but dishonour never ' Rav enspur advanced towards bis lady " My heroic Geialdine, ' he cried, his face illumined with smiles, "thou ait right, misfoitune has o'orta'tn me— but dishonoui rests with those who shot the bolt I am banished, love, my fair domain confiscate, and my title gone " " Bauished !' ıeplıed Geraldine with changing cheek, " Banished ' " Even so, my love, ' replied her lord, " banished nevei to return But cheer thee, sweet, we must to Ravenspur to secure some few of the baubles we were wont to think so useless they must stand our stead in this dilemma Come, iny bonny Geialdine, thou and I must ti udge many a weary mile before our foot finds resting place "
2J7
The Earl endeavoured to s "Ле, but lus elľort was vaui, and sinking on а seat, and exteuding his arms towards his 1 idy, he said, " My beloved Geraldine " little did I suppose, when yesterday 1 jested with tbee on thy altered shape, that the ughtful hen ol Ravenspur vvould be boni a strangei to his fathei s land—an alien a wandei ei—or lhat in poverty and evile my loved and honoured wifeshould fiist be hailed a mother Geialdine s eyes were filled with tears as she itturned her lord s embraces ' We shall be together, she replicii " and my de ir father will av ert the woes of poveity Come, my Ravenspur, ltt us to horse, I still can mount my favou utc bappho Why Ravenspui—why love, tbou heedst mc not -rome, I will teach thee to be brave, and my dear loul shall see, that though my lips turn pale the rosy hue forsakes my cheeks, when I witness the mock encounter of wai s
238 affray, yet that I bear a heart shall laugh at souow " The lady Geraldine playfully soothed the irritated feelings of Ravcnspur , and, pressing her to Ins bosom, he blessed heaven, for that in all his woes, it still had kept in store for him a treasure be yond the pnce of rubies Aftei giving some directions to his attendants, and seeing every thing prepa¬ ied for hi ι lady ь comfort, he placed her m her littet, debiting Jacques to keep by the side of it duung the whole journey Jacques, pioud of this office, bowed low, and laying his hand upon his hcai t replied, " Death alone, my lord, shall separate me from it Will your lord ship pardon my offering you a woid of counsel ut this cntical moment*> it jou stand in need of a confidential, active person on your а -uval at Ravenspur, be lieve me, my lore', «heie ıs no one more worthy of trust than Clod, your lordship s

" My lord, resumed Clod, " they who bide eau tind before I get to Father Nicholas and back the fowler may be at hand to spread his nets Trust these gems to me 1 U return for moie , and
311
aiid to-night in Father Nicholas' cell you shall find them." " Well, as thou wilt, fool : there's a noble for thee ; thon soon wilt have ano¬ ther master." " The castle will," quoth Clod, " but not the fool. It I go not with thee, my lord, I will be master here ; they who are coming will not stay long. But the jewels. There is old Robert and Mar¬ gery ; they will weep their eyes out. Forsooth, my lord, give the jewels." With uncommon rapidity Clod dis¬ appeared, and as quickly returned. Thrice did he load himself with all he could carry of value, but ere the fourth time, the horn sounded at the gate. > " There they are, by Jupiter," and instead of running away, he absolutely ransacked the drawers of the cabinet; and filled every part of his dress with valuables of some kind or other, say¬ ing that " Robert was slow of foot, tuid vol. i. и
242
■would not reach the Outer portal withm a quarter of an hour, at least." Ravenspur, in the meanwhile, was so Absorbed in thought, that he heeded liltle of what was ** assing round him, -till he observed that the fool had per¬ fectly transformed his usual slim figure into that of a jolly looking,Puneh. Just as the Earl was upon the point -of speaking, Robert entered, with а face as long and as lanky as that with which Barry has depicted Pericles in his cele¬ brated picture of the victors claiming the prizes at the Olympic games. " How now !" said Ravenspur ; " thy «tory ? Thy fac«, Robert, is the harbinger of ill ; let thy tongue disclose its nature." *' Alas ! my lord," replied tho faithful domestic, " officers bearing thf King's eignet are at the gate, demanding pos- ■eessioii of the castle." " Why then," rejoined the Earl, "even let them have it. I am a banished

mau, Kóbort; but yet I had not thought so aoou to quit these walls. But kings, they say, have long arms, and so 1 find it. If thou lovest, me, Robert, thou and -Margery will remain here, unless the King should order otherwise." Robert's attention, however, was for an instant diverted from his master by the strange contortions of Clod, who at length broke out into bitter moanings, declaring he was poisoned, and that he must go instantly to Father Nicholas, who alone could cure him. While Clod made his exit, Ravenspur had been examining a fine old picture of his father and mother : and Robert iras so confounded with the news be liad just heard, that he remained silent, till he was startled by the sound of foot» »teps, " They are coming, my lord," said the terrified domestic ; " they are coming." The door was heard to open, aud from beneath the arras tbere ap¬ peared two strangen. Ravenspur looked .-------------------- «LŽ
244
at them haughtily, and bade them " not intrude themselves into his privacy." " We are but doing our duty, my lord," replied one of the officers ,· " we have tbe King's commands to take pos¬ session of the castle, and all within it." " Villain," said Ravenspur, darting upon the intruder a look from which he shrunk, " begone, or rather let me pass." The men stepped back as Ravenspur advanced, and passed them to leave the apartment, but they followed him at some little distance. When he en¬ tered the hall a heavy sigh escaped him ; it was full of his retainers, whose love got the better of their respect, and crowding round him, they in loud tones lamented his departure, and their own irrepaiable loss. This display of their affection almost unmanned tlieir master —maeter now no longer " My good friends," said Ravenspur, and there he paused j«." my good fi-iends," he re-
2tö
sumed, " I am pioud to say that though a banished man, your former master quits his native land with a name un¬ sullied Repress your gnef while I im¬ pai t to you my last commands " A profound silence lollowed this over¬ whelming speech " I am about to leave the halls of my ancestors to strangers, myself am doomed to mix with strangers, yet I could wish that two of you should share my banishment " A number of voices instantly burst foith " I will follow you to death," said one, " to the woild's end I will ac¬ company you," said a second , while a third, and many more in diflerent words, butali tending to show how tiuly Ra- „nspui was beloved, deelaied " they would go wherever be would lead, ' while old Robert, wringing his hands m frantic grief, lamented he was too old to attend his loid Ravenspur waved his haud for si-
246
lence, thi ice he essayed to speak, and thnce " tears such as angels weep," prevented hnn " My faithful followers, my brave retainers, would to heaven I could take you all with me, but it cannot be, and as all are tued and equal found, let lots decide " Ravenspui took from a pole α hel¬ met, when one of the officeis told lum " he must not remove a single article " " Who says me nay ? ' replied Ra¬ venspui, diawing his swoid, "nowby my holidam, but my soul is chafed, that such a knave as thou shouldst thus, in face of this bught array, dare to bid me cease Stand back, and at your peril impede my puipo«e The officeis looked at each other, while the attendants seemed but to wait a signal from then loid to fall foul upon them " Out, veilets," said old Robert, trembling with passion, " dare you step between the lion and his prey ' Non m
24?
good truth I knew! well from youi looks that Clod would beat you hollow Men of arms would scoin to waste their strength on such fine spun stuff as you are made of ' ' , Ravenspur, in the meanwhile, bad prepared the lots, аш! shaking them in he helmet, held it lorvvaid to his re¬ tainers. No one seemed anxious to take the fiist chance, the fear of uot bemg successful seemed to pre¬ ponderate over their hopes. " Am 1,' said Ravenspur, aftera few moments* suspense, "am I to go alone ?" A lush of candidates followed this appeal, and m a tone of exultation Oliver, Robert s son, and Thomas, son of the waider, drew the fortunate lots With a look of disappointment their companions tin ned away, and the Earl, glancing round him, bade them adieu in emphatic language " Shall we not see our lady ?" said many voices
248
" No, ' was the reply, " she is on her way to the castle, but I mu*t trust to your speed and diligence, Oliver and Thomas, to prevent her approach loa mansion of which she is no longer mis¬ tress She is 1 feai at no great dis¬ tance Bid liei repair to Fitzhugh Castle, theie to abide my coming I must to Fathei Nicholas awhile, and then shall join her Ere the Earl had concluded this speech, many of his relaméis had left the hall, and witliout waiting its con¬ clusion they hastened to meet their lady, while Ravenspui continued to give his ordeis to those who lemamed· " It would content, me much ' he said, " would my retainers still ι emani on this much loved spot if so the King per¬ mit ' Twould cheer my banishment. ' " All will remain, if such your wish, interrupted Robert " Tıs well, added Ravenspur then looking around the apartment, eath
249
brilliant suit of mail that adorned it being illumined by the slanting lays of the setting sun, he approached one suit, and taking from it the gauntlet and the sword, he strode haughtily by the offi¬ cers, and had gained the portal, when one of tbem followed, and told hnn to lepiace that aimour Ravenspui smiled contemptuously, using the answei of the Spartans upon a similai occasion, when they weie bade by Philip ot Macedón to lay down their aims ' Come and take them " He stopped at tbe thieshold, as if awaiting then approach , but seeing that they remained at а íespectful distance, he tuined lrom tbem indignantly, and de¬ liberately and silently ciossed the great court of the castle, for his few attendants who remained weie too much affected to interrupt him. When Ravenspur reached the barbican he halted, tuined slowly round, and as with intense feel¬ ing he viewed every part of the castle,
350
he-recalled his first departure from it, when, 'in the joy of his heart, he bailed the invitation of tbe King as the har¬ binger of future glory ; he conjured up the figure of Fat'uer Nicholas, heard his parting blessing, and then imagina¬ tion painted the delight with which he had lately welcomed his lovely bride, now an exile to these stately halls. A tear started to his eye ; wben rousing from his reverie, he hastily mounted his horse, and waving his hand to old Ro¬ bertille soon reached the monastery, Father Nicholas had been so much affected at the intelligence of Clod, that his aged frame refused to bear him to the castle. Ravenspur found the father alone in his cell. His cowl was thrown back, his hands were clasped, and his eyes stedfastly fixed on heaven. He rose hastily as his beloved pupil en¬ tered. " My son—my dear son," said the old man, " thou wouldst not be warned, and the prophecy is fulfilled.
251
Alas, where ıs thy lady? thy faithful Clod lias left me even now, and hes committed to my keeping the jewels of tbine house, and with earnest suit has begged I vvould permit him to wear to¬ night, my towl and hood " " Trust me, good fathei, that Clod is more knave than fool,—he is however a trusty knave But at this moment I think not much of lum, but have much to say to thee ' Ravenspui then, in a long conversa¬ tion, asked the fathers advice upon certain points, and gave directions to the monk upon others He then said he was bound foi Spain, but Father Nicholas urged stiongly tbat Italy was the better countiy, and this he did from a promise given by lum to the lady Victonne previous to her death; he also pointed out Jacques, as an ex¬ cellent guide to hım m his peregrina· tions, and one of whom he had the highest opinion '
252
" I have confessed him ofttn, and have found him," added the father, " a sincere penitent for his past offences, a zealous and attached retainer lo you, my dearest lord ' Ravenspur was pleased to find the father's opinion coincided with that of Ins own, and he now recollected that with her dying breath tbe lady Victo¬ nne had recommended him to bis no¬ tice While tbey were thus engaged, Clod entered in his own proper shape, and craved the promised garment fiom the fuar, putting down at the same tune a casket of jewels " Why thou ırreverend varlet, said the friar, his eyes kindling with indig¬ nation, " seest thou not thy loid and master?" " I have no time just now fo see him, but I am using my eyes, my feet, and hands m his sei vice," quoth Clod ' I may run with the hare, but I must keep with the bounds, and ι 'faith,
253
good father, the hounds have entered the castle. I have drank with them, too, and they pledged me in a cup of the best. My noble master," he con¬ tinued, bowing respectfully to Raven¬ spur, " my noble master, when the ravens scream, the prey is at hand ; they who have a house should keep it, but having lost it, they must—" " Sirrah," interrupted the monk, " take the cowl and begone." Clod put on the cowl and hood, ob¬ serving " that he was not the first wise man who had put on a cowl, neither was he the first fool who had played a wiser part than his lord." Father Nicholas was again checking him, when the Baron observed " that Clod was privileged ; he however called the latter, and bade bim tell the use he was going to make of the cowl." Clod replied thus : " My lord, when I came here to be cured of the effects of poison, and returned in my own
254
native form, my companions believed the prayers of the father had relieved me The second lime even now, that I returned, I pretended business to your lordship , but I have no pretext for re· turning а thud time, and suspicions would be excited, my movements would be watched by the gentry lately ar¬ rived and your lordship s nobles would travel to Ireland instead ot Italy, and your humble seivant would be deserv¬ edly whipped foi playmg a fool s part in good earnest Under this giave cowl I shall pass unmolested to all parts of the castle I am sent by Father Nicho¬ las with a message to old Robert and Margery I shall not dishonour the cowl, grey haus are a mark of wisdom, so is a grey cowl, they who outwit a right reverend fnar have but one more to dupe " Clod was proceeding in this diffuse style uninterruptedly, for the Earl of Ravenspur had ceased to listen, and
255
the father was gazing from the small casement at а horseman, who was ad¬ vancing full gallop towards the monas¬ tery " Tıs Jacques, said the friar, turning to the Baron Ravenspur staited from his seat, while Clod enveloping himself in his grey frock, followed his lord quickly to the entiance of the saeied building, where Jacques, hastily dismounting, disclosed the purport of his visit in the following woids
Jacöuh —Is not tins α rare fellow, my lord? He s good at any thing and yet а fool As ΐου Lim tr
" FtiTHFüL to the tiust your lordship honoured me with," said Jacques, " I attended the lady Ravenspui, and pro¬ posed thai we should ι est and take short stages on tbe road , but her anxiety to join your lordship would not permit her to stop moie than was absolutely neces¬ saiy, and we continued our journey with all possible speed, till within ten miles of youi castle there we were met by a laige body of youi lord¬ ship's retainers, who crowding round Ihe litter, intreated they might be per¬ mitted to take a sad l'ai e well of their
257
honoured lady , and she was just ex¬ tending her hand, with a tear in her eye and a smile on her lips, to those who were the nearest, when a messenger bearing the King s livery rudely rode up to us, and making his vvay through the crowd, piesented a letter which he said was for the Earl of Ravenspui " He is gone on in advance, said the Countess, " can you tell me its con tents - Is it of importance that it should be forwarded to my lord ' " It contains the King s commands to the Earl to quit England on the instant, and Ihave ordei s to hasten his dispatch, and forbid bis entering the castle he t'ormeily called bis As Jacques reached this pait ofhis nairative, Clod suddenly stai ted from his position and with the swiftness of au auow be disappeared, and soon reached the castle His departure was unnoticed, for the Eai I and Tather Ni
258
cholas were too much interested m Jacques s story, to heed the fool, wbo was however acting the pait of a veiy wise man " My lady has therefore sent me on to youi lordship, to know whither she should bend her steps, since it will now be impossible foi her to fulfil your lold- ship s commands, of repairing to Fitz- hugh Castle As sbe was surrounded by brave men, who would die in her de¬ fence, if necessary, I judged proper to come myself and know your lordship s pleasure ' " We would see your Abbot, Fathei Nicholas said Ravenspui, and then relapsed into an attitudeof deep thought, while Jacques stood respectfully silent, until the Abbot with nu*estic step ap¬ proached " Reverend father,' said Ravenspui, makin***? ι inclination ofhis bead at the sari, time, " reverend father, would
869
H be intruding on your hospitality, to crave a shelter for the lady Ravenspur for one night only î" " My lord," replied the Abbot, " the house of Ravenspur can command here, the lady shall be accommodated to the best of our ability " " We did not think," rejoined Raven- ápur with dignity, " we should evet want a house, and if we have framed our speech but rudely, pardon us, reverend Abbot—we have been more used to give command, than sue for favour For your hospitality accept our thanks—an exile's thanks Jacques," he continued, " return to your lady, and conduct her hither, and with morning's dawn awake us with thy hoin Send one to Fitz¬ hugh Castle, to tell the tale of oui mis- foi tunes, and say moreover that we ex¬ pect tbe Earl will cheer our exile by fie¬ quent communication. Quick, bring thy lady hithei " Jacques hastened away, and the Carl
260
returned into the convent, accompanied by the Abbot and Father Nicholas, and while they are engaged in an interesting conveisation upon the late sudden and unfortunate aspect of a branch of the House of Ravenspui, we will return to Clod, whom we left upon the long trot hastening to the caslle As he got near the castle he slackened his pace, accosting the stray peasants he met with m a fnendly tone The portal of the barbican was open, the court was deserted, and he crossed the hall without observation, and repaired to Robert s apaitment Robert was sitting in his armed chair, one elbow resting upon it, the band of which suppoited his head. He rose as the pretended monk enteied, and Mai^eiy putting dowu hei knitting, placed a chan for Clod We stand much in need of consolation, Father, said Robert, " and you ne\ei came m moie distressing times Has the Lord left the monasteiy ? '
261
" No," replied Clod in a feigned tone of voice " no, his Lordship is still there, and will not proceed till morning I am come, Robert, upon particular bu¬ siness for my Lord, and must immedi¬ ately enter the chapel " " Heaven defend us," said Margery, " that s impossible, the officers bave taken possession of the oak parlour, and it is impossible you should pass them " " Leave that to me," resumed Clod, in his own accents, which startled Mar¬ gery and her spouse, " only do you not interfere with my proceedings, and I'll answer for it I get into the thapel Hide thou this fnendly babit, and I will get my best cap with the new bells, and be thou and Robeit but silent, and I shall do very well. I had hoped to have ac¬ complished my business befoie this, but I have been mistaken. It I call for a bottle of hypocras, or a hot pot, do thou but bring it, Robert, and all will be well "
262
Robert aud Margery promised com¬ pliance, and Clod hastened for his new .cap, and then opening the door of the oak parlour, he boldly entered. " Who's there?" Eiid one of the offi¬ cers, in tones wbich plainly bespoke that the wine and ale of Ravenspur Castle were not deficient in strength as well as taste. " A friend," quoth Clod ; " a rare article in these times, and a valuable one too, as you shall find. What have we here ?" he continued, taking up a drinking-cup ; " drink for babes, by the jingling of these bells: Old Robert shall give us something better than this to drink to our new Lord's health. Here, Robert, bring us some of the wine my Lord last brought from Florence, unless that rogue Jacques has drank it all." " Pray," said one of the officers, "why do you—drink— the —the new lord's— health? how do you—you—know who— he is to—be—be ?"
263
' c Wfaat signifies who he is/* ansffered Clod ; " 1 have been at courts, and have always found that those who were in favour there, were those who were mas¬ ters He who possesses the castle, is the lord for me - Бе he blick or be he fair-* Wears he a cap, or Ыя own grey hair, He tiiat hu power and wealth to boo, And wisdom enough to look well to U- He that has griped Dame Fortune at laut, And has wit and will to hold her fust- He tbat can Mil on lite s gay stream, Nor lose Ins untes in pleeeure s dream,-* But steering clear of fierce debate, Veen with the wind and commands his (ate.

' " I'faith man, I can't say," replied Clod, " unless that /being a wise man- it was not thought proper thatawisefool should have a wise master But you don't drink—here's to him that com¬ mands fortune Possession is nine- tenths of the law, and yet my master that was, with all his bee-like providence, gathered honey for wasps to suck, and fui nished a comb for drones to devour " " Right, master Clod," rejoined one of the officers, " but— methinks —that— you speak freely of your late—ma— master " " What, are you come from court, and surprised at tbat ? why it is the fashion there, I trow, too see only with the King's eyes I was there once, and when he
S65
frowned, upon a man, 'twas a signal that 1 should turn my back upon him—but drink, my friend." Clod's companions were soon reduced to &stateot'inebriation,whiclirendered them totally incapable of keeping their eyes open, and he therefore, singing as he rose, entered the sacred building, and repaired to the knight's chapel, where he had hidden his treasure. He collected it all together, and deposited it in various parts of his dress, till he was so loaded that he could only move at a slow pace ; one heap of nobles he was obliged to leave, but all the jewels, and a cup of inestimable value, he contrived to secrete about his person ; the nobles he hid from all impertinent eyes, and then returning through the oak parlour, where his late companions were fast asleep, he disclo¬ sed to Robert the treasure he had saved for bis master's use, " and how/' he ad¬ ded, "for my cowl; lest my frequent vi¬ sits to the monastery should be observed, VOL. 1.

—I have dosed the two gentlemen in the parlour, and I think they are by this time set in for a sound nap, which will last till to morrow at noon-day, unless they are interrupted. Do thou, Robert, be ready at break of day to admit me into the caslle, and Margery, prepare me a posset, foi the fare of the monas¬ tery—water grutl and cabbage, or some such savoury mess—will sit but ill upon my highly seasoned stomach " Margery promised to attend to bis wishes, and Clod having put on the grey frock, was accompanied by Robert to the outer poital The few sei vants he mtt with m passing through the castle, gave him the path respectfully, while Clod, his eyes fixed on the ground, appealed ab¬ sorbed in his own melancholy cogita¬ tions , when he reached the door of the hall, he looked back upon them, and ex¬ tending his hands towards them, as if bestowing his benediction, he speedily crossed the court yard, and with all dib-
267
gence mounting a little sturdy poney which Robert had prov ided for him, he at a brisk cantei set oft for the monastery The porter having admitted him^ looked with surprise at one of his ordet being absent till so late an houi, but Clod passed bun quickly, and without any ceremony hastened to the apirtinent where the Eail and his Countess were laying plans for their future proceedings Clod had no sooner entered than he doffed his cowl aud began deliberately to unload himself " By St George,' said the fool, " 1 have givpn thein then possets, and cozened them well to boot Ariaut knaves they aie, and α plague to them, and they take mc for a bird ot their fealhei , no matter, my lord, they who hive to deal with hawks must know how to hoodwink them.

" I wear о motley coat, my lord, replied the fool, "be not sin prised if you hear I have changed it The lion himself resorts to stiatagem when he attacks a wild boar, and wby should not poor Clod the fool do his best to outwit those who think him knave as well as fool ?

273
yet with a forced smile she allowed Ra¬ venspur to lift liei to her litter, and then, drawing her veil closely round hei to conceal her agitation, she foi а time lound rebel in tears Ravenspui was surrounded by lus re taineis, who ıesolved on accompanying him to the sea-side When the cavalcade ıeached the watei's edge, the noble exile turned the hoise-litter ol bis lady, so that she could command a view of the castle, then gently assisting her to alight, she enteied the boat piepaied foi her, lrom whence she was lilted mto a vessel that was to convey them into the Ne thei lands Ravenspur paced the deck, his eyes stedfastly fixed on his much loved native jshores—while the daylight lasted , and long aftei twilight had hidden all but the dusky outline which seemed to mark the union of land, and sea, and sky, did he remain with folded arms, intently gaz к 5

279
moment he appealed to have recalled many years from oblivion In vain his attendants urged him to forbear, he hastened to his armoury, and pointing to a coat of mail he bad worn at the battle of Cressy, he persisted in putting it on, but its weight was too much for him, and he was compelled to acknow¬ ledge himself incapable of avenging himself and his beloved children " Oh, he resumed, with a deep sigh, " had heaven in mercy spaied my gal¬ lant boy, I should not now lack an arm to defend iny honour My Geialdine— my child—thou ait gone, and these aged limbs must sink unlamented to the giave Lead me to my couch, the blow has struck upon my heart, and I can lesist its chilling effects no longer To my couch, I say, and leave me to myself and my own sad thoughts " His attendants gladly obeyed his command, and Fitzhugh gave himself up a prey to grief and despair Day
280
after day passed on, and his regrets in¬ creased , no tidings had reached him of Ravenspur and his Geraldine, and the venerable Earl s health, unab.e to con¬ tend with the pressure of such accumu¬ lated and successive misfortunes, sunk into that state which is infinitely more alaiming than one of lrutation, in which the suflerci finds some rebet m complaint At length he felt con¬ vinced that his sorrows were drawing to a conclusion, and he dispatched a trusty servant to Fathei Nicholas, re questing Ins immediate attendance, the confessor of his own family beinet this time dangerously ill also Father Nicholas thought he was un¬ able to perform the journey, but Clod, when sent foi by tbe father, uiged him by the love he bore the house of Ra venspur to make the effort A com fortable httei was theiefore prepared for the monk, and, accompanied by his motley attendant, and two of the serv-
281
ing men of the Earl of Fitzhugh, he set oil' foi the castle ot the latter Father Nicholas lound the old Earl exceedingly debilitated, and approach¬ ing fast to that quiet home where the noble and his slave alike are at rest Fitzhugh was considerably agitated at sight of tbe monk, and it was some time before he could command his voice so as to articulate distinctly At length he said, " Father, I have much to say to you, the hand of power has deprived me of my life s best treasure, and my heait misgives ine , but I fear that Richaid, who has bestowed the castle, title, and domains of Raven spui upon Sn Henry, will wrest from the hands ol my beloved child this noble seat and laige domains ot her ancestois " Oh, do not think that Richard can commit so much injustice 1 ' ıeplıed the monk " 'Tweie well," interrupted Clod,
282 " my lord sbouid fear, for so its whis¬ pered at the court " " Ah · ' inter upted Fitzhugh, " bow knowcst thou that, lool î ' '· Asses and fools are synonimous," re¬ plied Clod, drily , " asses have long ears, and a long tongue too, for i'faith 1 said twere well an if he would " " Thou didst not say thus '' resumed the Ëarl, raising hunself fioin his seat, and aiming a blow at Clod with bis stall, which lay on the couch, " thou didst not say thus'" "In ti uth 1 did, my lord, and paid my respects to my future lord and lady, aud they llatteied me, and bade me be watchful tor them. And I shall watcb for them, аур, as the hawk does the dove, or the ι aveu for his piey nought sball escape me " " Peace, fool, said the fuai, " thy jesting is oul of time bee st thou not the Eail believes thee false ? Away, I will explain thy folly—away, away."
S83
Clod withdrew, but went no fin thei than the outside of the dooi The Earl listened patiently while Father Nicholas explained to the Eail the devoted at¬ tachment of the pooi fool to bis mas¬ ter, and being thus pacified, the monk disclosed to him that he thought he would do wisely to pi olit by the in¬ telligence of the fool, and secrete his treasuies, leaving u document behind lum, mli usted to юте honest hand, containing an inventory of such trea¬ sure, and the spot where it was con¬ cealed " To your caic I commit this charge," ıeplıed the Baron , "in the cbapel are vessels of gold and silver, and in an oaken chest m the north west towtr are bags ot gold Wheie wouldst thou advise they should be deposited '' " In the tombs of some of thine an¬ cestois replied the friar, "theieare some 1 know, wherein we could secrete vast treasuie "
284
" To night, then," said the Euri," thou shalt repair thither, and mark me just m the middleof the pavement oi the ti ansept there is a square stone it beai s no par¬ ticular mark, and therefore will escape all suspicion Beneath this stone, thou It hud a narrow stair, leading toa small vault beneath the chapel The vault wherein repose the ashes of my ancestors is formed hkeasemicncularaisle, having a gothic netted roof this stan has, when you are in the interior of the burial vault, an appearance of solid gotlucarchi- tecture, built puiposely thus as a sup¬ port to the subterranean building, from which spring the groined arches, foi m ing the vaulted roof of the semien cular aisles This stone, theiefore which is narrow, is unknown to all but me and it bas always been the practice ot oui house, that none but its heu should be informed of this secret The way of entering it is thus when you have raised the square stone 1 have already mention-
285 ed, which rests on a bed of earth, you must clear away the surface of the lat¬ ter, till you feel a ring, in the centre of this uug is a small biass plate, which on being piessed hard, will remove a spring, and the door will smk at one end, and consequently rise at the other, the com partments being unequally divided You will then find no difficulty in rais ing it completely, not forgetting to fix it open ere you descend, by means of something weighty. But this is an under¬ taking which you should not attempt alone, and yet it is a secret I am loth to impart to any one but youiself The mortal on whom it shuts, ne'er revisits this earth, unless some paiticular provi¬ dence rescue them betimes ' Father Nicholas immediately de¬ clared that he would trust Clod with his life and reputation, and that he would wish for no better companion than tht fool After some little hesitation, the Earl
286
gave au assent to this proposal, and Clod was called in and instructed na the part he was about to peform The next difficulty was how t>*e tieasure from the north-west tower should be conveyed to the chapel Clod mused upon this subect, and at jgth undertook to bear к m iti present place of imperfect securit" v"hen the family was retired to rest ' 'Tıs impossible," replied the Earl, " you will be heard , ' then suddenly recollecting himself, he added, " ti uant as I am, I had forgotten there is a subter¬ ranean passage from the tunet in which you sleep, leading to the chapel, but it has been long uuopeieo, and I fear the enterpiize may be coupled with some danger, at any rate with much difficulty ' " That's no mattet," said Clod, " there is the greater certainty of its being untenanted, so my good lord ex¬ plain but where the entrance is, and by to morrow's dawn your successors, who-
S87
evci they may be, may whoop for the gold and the treasure ' " Well said, ' ıeplıed the Earl " Fa¬ ther Nicholas can spend the night in the chapel without suspicion, and the ravens who are hovering ovei the prey shall be disappointed but I am weary, leave me, and you, good father, ıetıre to the apartment piepared for you, and take a little rest before the night falls After tin« conveisation, the Earl of '^ t/ht-ith sunk into a profound sleep, from winch he did not awake till the sun s morning rays gleamed through the high and pointed casement of his chamber, and 'brew a strong gleam upon his venerable countenance W hen he open ed his eyes he fixed them steadily upon Tather Nicholas, who was standing by his bedside, in company with the old housekeepei Ciod was stationed with bis cap in his hand at the foot of the bed The father returned tbe pressure of
288
Fitzhugh's hand, saying at the same time, " all will be well, my good lord ' Fitzhugh smiled, and for one instant glanced towards Clod, whoa» respectful salutation and speaking eyes confirmed the pressure ol the monk as a token of good But the Earl bad lost the power ot speech, and the father was anxious to admmibtei the last saciament of the church Exhausted by the exertion this ceremony required, the Earl closed his eyes, and for some minutes he remained so still, that tbe housekeeper tbouglit his breath was gone, and began a loud lament " Peace, daughter, ' said the friar, ' peace, you distuib the last few mo¬ ments of your lord s existence " At this instant Fitzhugh opened his eyes, and again fixing them on the friar with an expression of confidence and hope, he never again removed them. Father Nicholas at length bent forward, and
289 and finding that the spinthad fled to its pnnmevil source, anil left only a heap ot clay behind, he closed the eyes, рси formed a requiem for the soul ofthc depirted, and in 'he absence Ú lhe fa¬ thei confessor, and e\ery lelative who could take upon themselves the office he gave oiders* for the funeial of the Eail of Fitzhugh The apprehensions which h id been ex uted m the breasts of Fitzhugh s retain ers îespecting his dangei had totally su- peiseded those joyous amusements, with which they weie wont to beguile the tune tlie hawks weie neglected, the hounds would have been foi gotten, but that then loud baying leminded the huntsman ofhis duty No sooner there tore did the domestics ıeceıvc iuţelii gence of the deatli of the good old man than then gnef burst foith m noisy la ment and thej rushed nnpetuouslv to the ap u tinent wheie their beloved loid lay a lifeless corpse During this burst oi feeling, it was not possible for Father
290
Nicholas to make himself heaid As, however, tbe faithful and tendei -hearted Clod was by his side, the latter con¬ trived to direct then attention to the reveieud monk, whoso pale countenance and slendei form seemed fast approach¬ ing to lhe goal which the noble Earl had alieady reached When the fathei laised his ciutihx, the mourners' voices gradually sunk into low murmuis, and placing himself at the foot of the bed, he remained for some few minutes ab¬ soibed in mental devotion, then turn¬ ing his eyes aiound, he addressed the dejected attendants thus " My childien, let us not mourn as those without hope Youi beloved mas¬ ter, after a stormy life, has sunk to iest iu the evening of his days, honoured, loved, and lamented Mourn not his departure from a world, where sorrow w as all that remained for him Grief foi the misfortunes of the house of Raven¬ spui, and the depaiture of his lovely daughter, have no doubt hastened his
291
end Yet these circumstances should check youi grief, foi greatly as you have cause to mourn his loss, think how light youi affliction is when compared to his and hovv trifling is your misfortune when opposed to that of your much-honoured lady, the daughter of а deceased and broken hearted fat liei, and bude of a persecuted man Withdraw to the cha pel thither I will attend you, and there while you pour forth prayeis for your la¬ mented lord, ask also from abovepatience and submission to the divine will ' As the monk concluded these woids, the sorrowing train withdrew, and Fa¬ ther Nicholas soon followed them Hav¬ ing peifoimed a solemn mass foi the soul of the depaited, he retuined to the apaitment of death, and there, as being less likely to be intiuded upon, he gave directions to Clod to seciete as much of the treasures of the noble house as could be collected together dunng that night The subteiraneous passage into the chapel having been explored before, the
292
fool was ordeied to lepair thither al ono in the moining, after Ihe funeral of the noble Eail should be performed, to deposit all the cups ant' chalicts which .11)01 ned the holy edifice 111 the vault already desctibed " These are my last ordeis, added the fuai, "for 1 do not wish, Clod, that you and 1 should have any secret conference to¬ gethei aftei this Be discieet, be faith iul —and all will be well On the following night, at midnight, Ihe lemams of the Eail of Fitzhugh were deposited in the tomb of his nntts tors , agieeably to his own request, he was not placed in a coflin, but was wiap ped in a woollen ceie cloth Altei the ceremony was pei formed, Father Nicholas retn ed fi oin the chapel, locking the door afl ei lum He was followed by the household mourneis, and having enteied the hall, he gave the key of the chapel to Hie seneschal of Ibe castle, desiring he would keep it till the confessor of the family should
293
retimi to lus duty. " You will, how¬ ever, attend me tlnthei at four in the morning foi matins, ' he added, " and at noon to moirow 1 shall return to Ra¬ venspui monastery, for iny strength lails me, and I am anxious to lay my weaiy bones to rest with those of our holy ordei, who are goue to then great ac¬ count betöre me But foi my sinking fíame, I would have passed this night in the chapel in prayer for the soul ol the departed " "Benedicite, my children," he continu¬ ed, stretching out his hand towai ds them The retain-rs then sorrowfully dispersed to their difl-ient apartments, the monk to the couch m tho great parlour, re¬ questing that some oneof the attendants of the castle would pass the night in the same room with hnn, saying he felt ex¬ ceedingly indisposed This was in fact but an excuse, that he might escape suspicion respecting the removal ot the plate of the chapel Clod bent his steps to the noith-west tower, and ha mg se-
294
cuied the door of his turret chambei, he instantly decended the stairs which led to the chapel, canying with bun his iron cresset to hght him through the dreary passage Ere he entered the sacred dwelling, he heard the whispering of tongues —" I tell you," said a man's voice, " that we may as well profit by the nap of the reverend fathei, and secure some ol these gewgaws, as let the kmg bave them, at any rate we have as much nght to them as he has, and I should like exceedingly to tui n this cup into gold nobles " A groan of extraordinary length and depth of tone caused the cup to fall from his hands —" St George détend us ! ' exclaimed his companion, " art thou satisfied, Thomas *"' Another groan intercepted this fellow s obseivation, and the words " Beware of sacnlege 1 ' produced such an effect upon Thomas, that he began to climb up the highly or¬ namented wallshke amonkey, and reach-
29ο
ing the window by which he hail en¬ teied, he pimped from it, and never ceased to run till he sunk upon the ground from fatigue He was followed by his companion once Ihey turned round to look, when а light flashing in the chapel, they crossed themselves and continued then flight Truly did Clod rejoice in then de¬ paiture, and having hastily collected the tieasure he was anxious to conceal« he deposited it in the cell, and returned to his apartment, unlocked the door, and threw himself on his pallet, where he soon sunk into a profound sleep, from which he was awakened by the en¬ trance of the seneschal, who desired he would accompany hnn to the chapel, as Fathei Nicholas was ready to perfoiui matins Thither they repan ed , but when the monk approached the altar, the cups, the flaggons, all were gone The utmost astonishment prevailed, everyplace was searched, yet no where did they appeni ,
296
but upon the tomb of the piedecessor of the last Eail a paichment scroll was found, containing the following woids — " The tieasmcs oj the chapel have been lescued Jiom sacidegious hands a lime will come when the Raven shaU fall and the Raven shall use, then, and not till then, will they be restored It is m vain to seek lo peneti ate tlie mys¬ tery ' Father Nicholas feigned equal sur¬ pnse with the inhabitants of the castle, although he had in fact written this scroll and given it to Clod He how¬ evei finished his ìeligious duties, aud at noon, after some conversation with the seneschal of tbe castle, he departed from the castle of Fitzhugh, wholly unsus¬ pected of having visited the noi tb west tower, oi the chapel, for any purposes but those of religion. Clod, upon his ι eturn to the castle, appealed to have rccoveied his spirits, and it will now be necessaiy to account for his absence from Ravenspui, alter the

departure ofhis lord and lady from then native home Clod was well veised in human natine aud he felt convinced that he might by a little judicious flat tery ingratiate himself into the good graces of Loid Henry Ravenspur, who would no doubt rejoice at seeing the interests of ks eldei brothei forsaken by his former playfellow and fool, the bumble yet important Clod To court therefore he repai ed, wheie with much adroitness he succeeded in deceiving the favounte of the day, Lord Hemy whom the fool easily discovered to be high in favoui itb the King and Queen, while his lady ivas eveiy thing to her royal mistiess, the titles and estates of Ravenspui wete still in abeyance and although tbe King had as yet made no declaration respecting their future destination, it was whispered among the tourtieis that Loid Hemy was to be their futuie possessor Before Clod quitted the couit, this donation was confirmed, and Rumom, with her hun-
298
dred tongues, having conveyed to the King's ear the expressions which fell from the Earl of Fitzhugh, in his first paroxysm of rage, Richard expressed himself highly offended at the n tem¬ perate wai in th of the old nobleman He then recollected the hasty departuic of Fitzhugh from couit, at the time of his daughter s wedding, and there wanted not those who fanned tbe flame of math which this recollection kindled The new made lord of Ravenspur affected pity for the old man, and by those pal liatives which do but inciease and un¬ tate, instead of healing the wound, he so worked upon the King his master that he declared he would seize the castle of Fitzhugh to pay the expenses ol his lush expedition Ravenspur, howevei, uiged that the Earl was sick even to death, and that as it was likely grief would ьооп ìelease his Highness tiom the only obstacle which lay be tween him and the accomplishment of his eud, it were well to await the event
299
" Thy advice my Ravenspui, savouis of sound policy replied Richaid, and when the doting fool shall die we will sieze upon his local treasure and p u t of his estate but we destine the dom uus and castle of Fitzhugh to the posstssion of a fuend, α true and attached adheieut one whom we wholly tiust, one who h ıs pioved lumsell woi thyofourconfideuce ' 'Twere )ust and fitting youi higl ness should have full proof of the t nth and loyalty of lum upon whom you b< stow so uch a boon ıeplıed the aıttııl Ravenspur ' Υ ι who could be bast enou„h to pervert the gifts ot so buít volent so kmd a monaich, to his undo ing' But still, my liege we little know our friend from foe Alas ' he addtd with α deep sigh, ' who could have sup posed that Richard Ravenspur, my bio thei, should beai so false a heart ' Bebevi me my liege, I am not much inclined to visit Ravenspur, since he who w ıs its loid has proved himself unwoithy to possess it Was youi Highness well

302
and lesolved, since he could not pre¬ vent the total ruin of his late loved master, winch the confiscation of the property of Fitzliugh would complete, to return to the castle, and there watch the proceedings of 1 lem y Ravenspui, and, if possible, assist his exiled lord Where he had been he refused to tell even Father Nicholas, seeing that the monk daily grew infinn, and tbat the severities he piactised were daily sap ping the fountains of life, and tl it it would therefore be ciuel to give bun the intelligence, which could only dis tress him, without the least possibility of his being able to aveit the impend¬ ing evil Now, however, he thought it necessary to impart to hun the ex¬ tent of his information, and the good lathei wept as he listened to the tale of Henry Ravenspur s depiavity. " My days," said he, " are drawing to a period , I shall not live to see thL restoration of our beloved lord to the

Clod withdrew from the monastery with a heavy heait, Father Andrew might be α fnend to his late mastei, but Father Nicholas he knew was эпе Ex¬ cept to Robeit and Margeiy, he could now nevei ventine to mention the name of the exiled Ravenspui smce his as sumed devotion to the new lord had oflended his companions, and made them shun him Eaily therefore on the morrow he again repantd to the monastery, but his lu art sunk within lum as he saw a procession of friars, beanng crucifixes and torches, issue from one of the cloisters, and passing thiough the long aicade m tbe front of the building enter at the great door which led im¬ mediately to the chapel He halted a lew moments, then hastened on, and as be approached the saeied building the sounds of the monks voices stole upon his ear in melancholy harmony, chauut mg α funeral requiem, with а beating

306
hearers were best prepared to profit by his lessons But on the present oc¬ casion the grief of his heart depnved him of the power of drawing such con¬ clusions as the scene before him might naturally have suggested, and even if he had been less absorbed by his loss and forlorn condition, the audi toi s to whom he should have addressed him¬ self had never eome within the scope of his wit. His inductions were wholly applicable to himself, and in silence he moralized on the past, and speculated on the future In the deepest dejection he returned home, and communicated to old Robert and Margery the melancholy intelligence of Father Nicholas' decease. " Alack, alack," said Margeiy, " who will now supply his place in the chapel > who will now console and gne us mtei ligence of our dear loid and lady ' Oh, that I had seen him before he had died Said he nought about them, good Clod ' * " Truly, Margery,' replied the fool,
307
" he did give me comfortable woids res¬ pecting them, and I could almost be inclined to hope be had the spirit of prophesy upon him, for he said I should live to welcome back our lord to his no¬ ble domains ' Ah' quoth Margery, " said he thus ? The heavens rewaid him ,—and Clod, tell us, when are we to expect the new lord ? Woe is me that I should become serving-woman to an outlandish lady ' I well remember when my good 'ady died,—heaven rest her soul,—what a gloomy mansion it was little did I think that I should live to see that child who caused her death, revel it here over his elder biothei But Clod, thou hast seen the lady Victory, tell us what sort ot woman she is ? And she has got an Italian confessor, too' Marry on us, what will become of us ' " You ask so many questions, ' re plied the fool, " that I know not which to answer fiist, but if you will have
308
a little patience 1 will reply to them all —In the first place, the Kdy Vic¬ torme, not Victory, is very tall and commanding, handsomci tha ι my lady, having long jet-black hair, dark eyes, and a most eloquent complexion Then she frowns thus, and her eyes flash fire when she is angi y Her maid, Jacquelma, is just such another but it is impossible for me to do justice to the fathei confes¬ sor, and his chosen friend, Master Ni¬ colai Such α hopeful couple, so tall, and so thin, so dark, and so sallow , so humble, yet so haughty, so pious, and yet so worldly , that ι faith, Robert, you and I would find no difficulty in pronouncing them a couple of airaut knaves" Poor Robeit and Mai gei y anticipated but little pleasuie from the arnval of such inmates as Clod had just descubed, and they repaired with sad hearts to the great hall, for it grew near the hour of noon, the time for their common lepast
309
Since the departure of Ravenspur and his family, a gloom had taken place of the cheei tul muth which was used to make the walls of the castle lesound. Clod had no butt of consequence upon whom to vent his humour, and he be came not only gloomy, but somewhat testy , when, thciefoie, lie took his seat at the upper end of the table by his lord s chan, which now stood empty, he gave lhe retoit couiteous to Thomas, who inquued of him, " when next he meant to take another fool s tup ' " When 1 am assured I can leave a wise man behind me/ replied Clod, ' but if the sun nevei slimes till then, we'll have a long night, I trow what is it to thee whether I go or stay, unless ineleed thou ait anxious to step into my shoes, and weai motley ' " Truly, mastei Clod, ' quoth Thomas, " I have no desire for tby coat, neither tor thy cap, one fool in a house is enough in all conscience You know
310
the old proveib, If all fools wore white caps, we should look like a floch of geese " Clod smiled sarcastically as he said, " I am surprised you should lefuse my offer, since every ass thinks himself worthy to stand with the king's boises " " A fool s bolt is soon shot, drily an¬ swered Thomas, as be helped himself to a second trenchei of venison pasty. " A wise man doth not hang his wisdom on a peg But pray, master Clod, may I beso bold just to ask you what makes you so confounded sour to-day î —you look as pleasant as bottled ale in summer— Has father Nicholas thought pıopeı to to ordei a little flagellation ?" The colour flushed to the fool s cheek theu as suddenly fled, as he replied, " Father Nicholas is dead " " Dead ' ' echoed several voices. amongst which that of Thomas was most conspicuous, "now by my tioth I grieve I have angered thee, Clod, there is my hand,—he is α fool wbo
311

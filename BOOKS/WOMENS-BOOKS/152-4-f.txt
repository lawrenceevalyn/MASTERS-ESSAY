**When Heaven and Earth, as if contending, vie 

To raise his being, and serene his sohI, 

Can he forbear to join the general smile 

Of Nature ? â€” Can fierce passions vex his breast, 

Vv'^hile every gale is peace, and every grove 

Is melody ? â€” Hence, from the bounteous walks 

Of flovpering Spring, ye sordid Sons of Earth,

lERE Osmond was interrupted by a low 
but most malignant voice, exclaiming â€” 
'' Stuff â€” nonsense â€” folly V â€” and looking 
up he beheld Mr. Raymond at the elbow

of his lady^ where^ from this exclama- 
tion, he supposed he had been stationed 
some time. 

'' After wasting, in the ridiculous man- 
ner you have done/' he proceeded, ad- 
dressing himself to his wife and daughter, 
'' the moments 3^ou should have devoted to 
repose, I presume, ladies, you will not 
attempt to annoy me again with complaints 
of being fatigued.'* 

Confused and disconcerted beyond ex- 
pression, Osmond started up, and return- 
ing the m-anuscript, on which such polite 
animadversions had been made, to his poc- 
ket, precipitately withdrew to a distance, 
lest otherwise, if he longer listened to Mr. 
Raymond, he should be unable to repress, 
in the manner he wished, out of respect 
to the feelings of his lady and daughter, 
the indignation his conduct inspired him 
with. 

" But, for his brutality to them, the 
hour of remorse will yet, I make no 
doubt," he said to himself, *' arrive. â€” The 

blessings 



THE DISCARDED SON. 3 

blessings heaven bestows upon us are sel- 
dom if ever underrated^ or disregarded with 
impunity." 

As soon as his emotion had a little sub- 
sided, he repaired to Felisco, the heat 
being by this time a good deal abated, to 
enquire whet^^er he was not thinking of 
getting the horses ready. 

"No/* Felisco replied, '''not for ano- 
ther hour, at least;" as it was better to 
defer the renewal of their journey, than, 
when once recommenced, loiter on the 
road. 

Again, therefore, Osmond wandered 
away to indulge his own thoughts. The 
approaching se])aration between him and 
his fair companions was what now princi- 
pally occupied them ; for once across the 
Appennines, which, now that they were so 
near Venosa, they should shortly be, and 
he doubted not losing their society â€” â€¢ 
(It should here be mentioned, that Mrs. 
Raymond had given him to understand 
they were journeying to Naples, with an 
B % intention

intention of staying there some time) â€” 
the supercilious conduct of their ungrate- 
ful relative precluding a hope of a further 
intimacy being allowed between them, with 
such sentiments as he entertained for Miss 
Raymond, he could not but acknowledge 
it was better it should be prohibited, since 
so hopeless of ever being able to aspire to 
her hand. Still, however, the idea of this 
could not, in any degree, reconcile him to 
the thoughts of no more seeing â€” of no 
more conversing with her; for, alas! what 
the reason approves, the heart does not 
always subscribe to. 

Convinced that the longer he suffered 
his thoughts to dwell on her, the more un- 
happy he should be, he endeavoured to 
detach his ideas, by reviewing her father's 
conduct towards him ,* the rudeness, the 
dislike which it manifested â€” a dislike 
for which he was wholly at a loss to ac- 
count, surprised, as much as it disgusted 
him; as did also the profound attention 
with which he frequently saw him observ- 



THE DISCARDED SON. O 

ing him. From his manner (but that he 
knew they had never met before) he would 
have been tempted to imagine that either 
he had been so unfortunate as to inspire 
him with injurious suspicions^ or else to 
have mortally offended him. 

That the mother and daughter would 
feel some little regret at the breaking off 
of all further correspondence, he could 
not help thinking, and the thought at once 
pleased and pained him, since, while he 
"wished to live in their remembrance, he 
shrunk from the idea of being the source of 
any uneasiness to them. 

His reverie was at length interrupted 
by Mactalla calling to inform him the 
horses were ready. He hastened to the 
spot to which he had been summoned, and 
to his surprise found Mr. Raymond mount- 
ing his horse, totally regardless of his 
daughter. His lady, in no one instance.* 
had he treated as an object of any im^por- 
tance to him. It may readily be supposed, 
B 3 Osmond 



6 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Osmond did not neglect so favourable an 
opportunity of paying her attention. He 
assisted her on horseback ; but though an 
equally favourable one occurred for con- 
versation with her and her mother^ Mr. 
Raymond being, perhaps by his contriv- 
ance, separated from them by the inter- 
\^ention of Mactalla and the French boy, 
they rode on for a considerable time in 
ailence. At length Mrs, Raymond made 
an overture to break it, but from the lan- 
guid tone in which she spoke, it was evi- 
dent to him orginated more in a fear of 
giving him offence, should she act other- 
Vt^ise, than from, real inclination. 

That this languor v/as principally owing 
to the effect lier husband^s neglectful, or 
rather tyrannical conduct had on her spirits, 
Osmond could not doubt, and this idea re- 
vived his indignation asrainst him â€” an in- 
dignation not lessened by the correspond- 
ing melancholy that appeared in the man- 
ner of Miss Kaymond. He smothered it, 

however. 



THE DISCARDED SON. J, 

however^ and exerted himself to the ut- 
most to divert them from unpleasant re- 
flections. 

The beauty of the prospects that now 
came immediately under their observation, 
the characteristic qualities of the Italians, 
and the perfection they had attained in the 
respective arts and sciences, were the sub- 
jects they now chiefly conversed on. 

'^ But if Italy was infinitely less delight- 
ful than it is with regard to scenery and 
climate, still/* continued Osmond, fol- 
lowing up the observations he had made on 
both, '' the reflection of its having former- 
ly been the seat of the triumphant rulers 
and conquerars of the world, to whom na- 
tions bowed, and ages yet to come will 
celebrate, could not fail of rendering it 
interesting." 

" Assuredly," said Mrs. Raymond ; '' nor, 
in a contemplative mind, would the sensa- 
tions it is calculated to excite be lessened, 
perhaps, by the striking contrast there is 
B 4 between 



5 THE DISCAEDED SOW. 

between its present and former inhabi- 
tants/' 

'' In some instances, perhaps, they mar 
have degenerated," returned Osmond; 
'*^ but if inferior to them in the rougher 
arts, they certainly equal them in the 
softer/* 

" As, for instance,'* cried Miss Raymond^ 
" with regard to painting and statuary^ 
they stand unrivalled; and music, their 
eminence in that delightful science has 
justly occasioned their country to be styled 
the land of harmony/' 

*' They are, indeed, justly celebrated 
for all,'' returned Osmond. '' In their 
paintings. Nature herself seems to mingle 
the colours ; and as to their statues, they 
appear only wanting a second Prometheus 
to make them start into animation/' 

" And what does Mr. Munro think of 
Nature's own productions here ? "asked Mrs. 
Raymond. " In short, what does he think 
of the beauty of the Italian ladies, a na- 
tural 



THE DISCARI>ED SON. 9 

tural question you must allow for a fe- 
male?" 

Osmond bowed and smiled. â€” '' I have 
certainly/' he replied^ " thought nature 
prodigal to such of the Ftalian ladies as I 
have yet seen. Nevertheless, I am told 
that beauty is not more prevalent here 
than in other countries ; that here will 
often be sou2:ht in vain that charmino-com- 
bination of colours, and delicacy of form, 
which the eye of man demands, when it 
contemplates the softer sex; not mine, 
however, always, I candidly confess, since 
I thinkbeauty depends infinitely more upon 
expression, than this combination of co- 
lours ; at least, the finest complexion, the 
most delicate features, would fail of inte- 
resting me, if unindicative of mind. When 
true to its movements, then, indeed, na- 
ture has compleated her work, and the 
heart of man," (he glanced perhaps in- 
voluntarily at Miss Raymond as he spoke) 
^' must pay homage to it." 

" And yet it has been observed," said 
1. 5 Mrs^ 



10 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Mrs. Raymond, '' that it is difficult for 2t 
woman of great sensibility to be perfectly 
handsome, since sensibility, by its delicate 
motions, necessarily deranges the propor- 
tions of the face.*' 

*^*^True; but how captivating is the ex- 
pression which it substitutes for insipid re- 
gularity !" 

'^ I agree with you in thinking so," 
said Mrs. Raymond ; " the finest face in the 
world would fail of interesting me, if de- 
void of animation." 

" I love those fugitive graces," as an 
elegant v/riter styles them, " which of one 
amiable person form twenty." 

'' Of the Italian ladies it has been re- 
marked," resumed Osmond, ''^ justly, I 
make no doubt, that from the natural 
sweetness of their manners, and mellifluous 
tone of voice, they could not fail of pleas- 
ing, even though not possessed of any^ 
very particular personal charms." 

In this way they continued to converse 
for some time, till, at length, their ap- 
proach 



THE DISCARDED SON. 1 1 

proach to a steep and rugged declivity re- 
called them to a sense of danger. 

On descending this^ they found them- 
selves^ after proceeding some way, through 
flowering thickets and embowering shades, 
on the edge of a narrow river^ margined 
on one side with low rocks^ bespread with 
moss and brambles ,* and on the other by 
lofty hills, wholly covered with wood. 
The solemn grandeur of this sylvan scene 
was heightened at the hour by the rich 
glow the setting sun shed over it, and the 
gorgeousness of the evening clouds that 
floated through the blue expanse, shift- 
ing into shapes of visionary beauty, in 
which it required no great stretch of ima- 
gination to pourtray the antique tower 
with shady domes, and pinnacles adorned, 
or hills of wide extent, that rose or sunk as 
sportful fancy listed. 

The travellei-s, pursuing the course of 

the river, proceeded in a road, bounded at 

one side by the v/ater, and the other by 

tremendous precipices, forming, from 

B 6 their

their ruggedness, a striking contrast to 
the woody hiils on the opposite shore. 
The savage aspect of these^ however^ was 
for some time prevented having the effect 
it was so well calculated to produce^ 
namely^, that of inspiring melancholy and 
terror^ by the pastoral music heard in every 
direction, of shepherds collecting and re- 
turning homeward with their flocks, to fold 
them for the night. But as these cheerful, 
and from the indications they gave of not 
being out of an inhabited tract, welcome 
soundS;, died away, and the soft shadows of 
evening began to give place to the deeper 
shades of night, apprehension gradually re- 
sumed its empire over the minds of the 
party, and Mr. Raymond bitterly inveighed 
against Felisco, for delaying the renewal 
of their journey so long. Felisco, how- 
ever, contended that they should reach 
Venosa in very good time, and that had 
they recommenced their journey sooner, 
they would have found the horses unable to 
carry them. 

Osmond, 



THE DISCARDED SON. IS 

Osmond, for some time, succeeded to- 
lerably well in keeping up the splints of 
his fair companions ; but, at length, a 
rising wind, and darkening clouds, giving 
intimation bf an approaching storm, they 
became completely alarmed. 

Osmond, on their account, now anxi- 
ously demanded of Feiisco, whether, should 
a tempest overtake them, they could ob- 
tain any shelter from it ? â€” To v^^hich 
Feiisco replied â€” â€¢'' Very indifferent, if 
any/* Adding, however, by way of conso- 
lation, that he thought it would blow over. 
In this opinion Osmond was for some 
time inclined to concur, from the continual 
dispersion of the dark clouds which had 
gathered in the horizon, and the sinking 
of the wind ; but, at length, all hope of 
its passing away in the manner he wished, 
was annihilated by a sudden tlash of light- 
ning, and a tremendous burst of thunder, 
stunning to the sense, as in horrid uproar 
it was repeated from rock to rock, and 
down the dells of the mountains, the 

clouds 



H THE DISCARDED SON. 

clouds all the while illuminated^ and emit- 
ting fire. This awful spectacle was quickly 
succeeded by a torrent of rain, which pre- 
sently forming cascades, in the hollows of 
the cliffs, the road became nearly inun- 
dated by them in their progress to the 
river, which now, with foaming fury, 
lashing its banks, completed the horrors of 
the scene. 

The dreadful situation of the ladies, 
sinking beneath terror, and the violence 
of the storm, made Osm^ond again call out 
to Feiisco, to entreat him to find some 
shelter for them. 

'' Do, my good fellow," cried Mr. Ray- 
mond, in a tone very different to that in 
which he had heretofore addressed him ; 
" do, fori protest,'' (heightening the dis- 
like Osmond had conceived to him, by 
convincing him his concern was all of a 
selfish nature) '^ I fear, if much longer ex- 
posed to the storm, I shall never ^et over 
the effects of it." 

*' Aye, aye," exclaimed Feiisco, in a 

reproachful 



THE nWCARDED SOK. 15 

repitoachful tone^ ^' 'tis now that a service 
is wanted^ my good fellow^ and my ho- 
nest felloW;, but to-moiTow I warrant it 
will be, you stupid fellow, and you im- 
pertinent fellow/' 

'' By blessed St. Benedict, Felisco/' 
cried Maetalla, impatiently, *^' but this is 
no time to be ripping up old sores; the 
question now is, do you know of any 
place into which we can thrust quv heads ?'* 

'' Why, if lonesome shelter be not ob- 
jected to, I can lead you through a cleft m 
the mountains,'' answered Felisco, " to 
a ruinsd monastery, at no great distance." 

'' Any thing, any thing," eagerly re- 
plied Osmond; " lead on, my friend, for 
the storni, if possible, is betoming still 
more violent." 

" What strange company," said Mac- 
talla, falling to the rear, and riding close 
to his master^ as they followed Felisco to 
the ruin, " do misfortunes sometimes in- 
troduce a man to ! why, Signer^ do you 

know. 



16 THE DISCARDED SON. 

know, the building we are going to is full: 
of dead friars and nuns?'' 

" Vvell^" observed Osmond, '' we can- 
not be in better â€” at least quieter com- 
pany/' 

^' Some how such company is not, nor 
never was, by any means, to my mind ; 
I don't at all relish taking refuge amidst the 
dead." 

'' Would that we had nothing to fear in 
this world," said Osmond^ '^ but from the 
dead." 

" You are of opinion, then, Signor, 
that the dead cannot molest us." 

â€¢'^Assuredly lam of opinion that theman 
whose conscience is void of offence towards 
God and man, has nothing to dread from 
the inhabitants of the other world." 

^' O, then, if that be the case, I'll pluck 
up my courage ; for, thanks to the Powei-s, 
my conscience, I believe, is as fair and as 
clear as most of my neighbours ; and more- 
over, before I left Acerenza, I settled all 

accounts 



THE DISCARDED SON. 17 

accounts with it; not^ indeed, I must da 
myself the justice to say, that it was over- 
burthened at the time, but when a man hasr 
an opportunity^ he may as well rub out 
scores of that kind as not." 

A short time brought them to the ruin^ 
which the vivid lightning, that every miÂ« 
nute played around them,, still followed by 
rumbling peals of thunder, permitted them 
to see w^i an immense, but completely di- 
lapidated fabric. 

On alighting, the ladies, Mr. Haymond, 
and Osmond, took refuge under a porch, 
until Mactalla and Felisco had collected 
some sticks, when the latter striking a 
Tight, the materials for which he had for- 
tunately furnished himself with at the 
castle, they advanced into the interior of^ 
the building, preceded by their attendants, 
with each a fiaming brand. After making 
their way wi-th difficulty over broken flags, 
and heaps of rubbish, they found them- 
selves in the body of the chapel, amidst 
long-drawn aisles, and far-extended arcades, 

overrun 



1 8 THE DISCARDED SON, 

overrun with weeds, and where their situ- 
ation was scarcely less comfortless than it 
had been without^ the roof being in so de- 
cayed a state as to admit thâ‚¬ rain in many 
places. 

Notwithstanding this, however, the fear- 
ful gloom of the place rendered the ladies 
unwilling to advance in quest of another^ 
better calculated to afford them shelter.-^ 
At length the angry remonstrances of Mr. 
Raymond, backed by the gentler repre- 
sentations of Osmond, on the fatal conse- 
quences that could scarcely fail of resulting, 
from their continuing in one so damp and 
cheerless, induced them to go in. Accord- 
ingly, penetrating through the obscurity 
of the chapel, they beheld an elevation of 
several steps, which ascending, they found 
themselves in a spacious hall, ending in a 
narrow passage, terminated by a small 
apartment, still in good preservation, and 
affording besides a place capable of having 
fire. 

Maetallaand the French boy were imme- 
diately 



THE DISCARDED SON. 19 

diately dispatched for fuel^ and Felisco 
for some clothes^ belonging to the partv, 
which he had contrived to get into his 
hands at the castle^ and put up for them. 
As soon as these were brought^ and the 
fire kindled, Osmond withdrew, to give 
the ladies an opportunity of changing 
theirs ; and leaving Mactalla, and the bov^ 
as guards at the door^, repaired with Felisco 
to see after the horses, and look out for 
some shelter for them. 

After a tiresome search, they at last 
found a place for them at the rear of the 
building. On returning to it, Osmond ex- 
amined the entrance, and finding a door 
still attached to it, with an inside fastening, 
availed himself of this, to close it up, and 
thus prevent any disagreeable surprise. 

He had the satisfaction of finding his 
companions as comfortable as existing cir- 
cumstances would permit, the fire by this 
time emitting a blaze that thoroughlv 
lighted the room, and some old benches 
having been discovered in a corner, on 

one 



so THE DISCARDED SOX. 

one of which Mactalla had spread the re- 
mainder of the provisions. 

For the anxiety he had manifested about 
her and her daughter, Mrs. Raymond now 
evinced her gratitude, by paying him 
every attention in her power. Nor was 
she regardless of his humble friends, on 
their retiring^ out of modesty^ and respect^ 
to th^ farther end of the room; she insisted 
on their approaching the fire, and partici- 
pating in the comforts they had been the 
means of procuring. 

Very different to hers was the conduct 
of Mr. Raymond; for the exertions which 
had been made in the present instance 
to serve him, he appeared not more 
grateful than he had done before. 

The instant Osmond entered the apart- 
ment, he started from the fire at which he 
had been standing, and having previously 
taken refreshment, ordered Felisco to 
spread out upon the floor the remainder of 
the things belonging to him and the ladies, 
upon which, wrapped up in a roquelaure 

he 



THE DISCARDED SON, 1 1 

fee found amongst them, he lay down to 
repose, having first, however, taken care 
to satisfy himself that one or other of the 
party would keep watch. 

Osmond advised the ladies to follow his 
example ; their minds, however, were too 
perturbed to permit them, the horrors of 
this night too strongly resembling that of 
the night in which they had fallen into the 
hands of the banditti, not to make them 
tremble with apprehension of its terminat- 
ing in a similar manner. Osmond exerted 
himself, and was seconded by Felisco, to 
banish this apprehension, representing the 
little probability there was of banditti 
lurking about so unfrequented a quarter as 
the present, and the still less there was of 
their being pursued by those they had es- 
caped from, in a direction where they 
must be aware there was but little likeli- 
hood of being able to trace them. 

" Well, I trust, at last," said Mrs. Ray- 
mond, '^ that what you say may be the 
case, for I acknowledge I am not ambi- 
tious 



f 2 THE DISCARDED SON. 

tious of figuring away again as a heroine of 
romance/' 

" I now find, indeed/' added her fair 
daughter;, '' that it is much pleasanter to 
read of, than to meet with adventures." 

" Why, certainly/' said Osmond, '' I 
confess there was a little too much of the 
terrific in yours to permit them to be 
agreeable." 

'' Yet now that they are, I trust, over," 
rejoined Mrs. Raymond, in something like 
a tone of gaiety, ^' 1 don't know that I 
much regret them, they have furnished me 
with so complete a tale of wonder for my 
friends. My only objection to relat- 
ins: it will arise from mv fear of its bein<x 
considered too much in the Munchausen 
style to gain implicit credit." 

" But as a consolation, reflect, my dear 
Madam, that the more it is doubted, the 
o^reater is the estimation in which your 
imagination must be held." 

'' True," she returned, '' I did not think 

of that before. Yes, I shall certainly con- 

5 tent 



THE DISCARDED SON. Â§S 

tent myself with the idea of gaining ad- 
mirers, if I don't believers/' 

*'â–  The former. Madam," with a bow and 
a smile, said Osmond, " I am certain you 
can never find it difficult to obtain." 

'' Except," cried she, returning his 
smile, " where there is a deficiency of 
taste." 

" Exactly so," he replied. 
After a little farther conversation of a 
desultory nature, Mrs. Raymond finding her 
tona sposa had fallen asleep, proposed to 
Osmond, since they could not follow his 
example, and were, as he conceived, in r i 
danger of being disagreeably surprised, 
that he should finish the manuscript, her 
curiosity being strongly excited, she 
said, to hear how the repentance of Carlo 
ended. 

Osmond, by a bow, signified his readi- 
ness to obey her wishes ; and having seen 
that there was sufficient fuel at hand to 
keep up the fire some time longer, drew 
forth the manuscript, and, with the mo- 
ther

ther and 3augh(er seated beside him, and 
Mactalla and Felisco, by the express com- 
mand of the former, at no great distance, 
and convenient to the fire, proceeded as 
follows â€” 



*' Lovely as Isabella was, and greatly as 
his soul adored her, there were moments 
when, writhing under the tortures his 
knowledge of her had given birth to, in 
which Carlo wished he had never seen her 
-p-a wish, however, which always ended in 
wonder and repentance, for ever having 
, formed such a one. 

While Montana lived, Isabella, he re- 
solved, should never quit the mansion in 
which she had been brought up â€” a resolu- 
tion which w'as productive of additional tor- 
ments to him, so importunate was she to 
be taken to Naples, after the decease of her 
parents â€” an event that took place soon 
after her nuptials. 

Carlo 



THE DISCARDED SOX. Â§5 

Carlo was compelled to have recourse to 
various falsehoods, to excuse his not attend- 
ing to these importunities, but in vain he 
endeavoured to reconcile his lady to con- 
tinue in her present residence : yet not so 
much from weariness of its solitude, or the 
affecting remembrances it was calculated to 
keep alive, did Isabella desire to quit Cla- 
rizio, as from motives of vanity. She 
knew she was fair â€” she loved admiration ; 
and at Naples she was convinced her thirst 
for this would be amply gratified. To the 
idolizing Carlo, however, who, on every 
occasion, regarded her with a lover's eye, 
these, her real motives for desiring to visit 
that celebrated scene of luxury and plea- 
surb, remained unknown; he believed her 
to be as perfect in mind as she w^as in 
form.'^ 

*â– ' Here follows,'' said Osmond, after a 
pause of some minutes, during which his 
eye wandered over the manuscript, '^ a 
chasm of considerable length; but which^

the story, as, from a few words scattered 
throughout^ I fancy it was merely filled up 
with an account of the circumstance that 
betrayed to the knowledge of Montana the 
treachery of his friend/* 

'^''Ah! I apprehended his obtaining that 
knowledge/' cried Miss Raymond â€” '' poor 
Carloj I tremble for him/' 

'' But I am sure^ my dear girl, you must 
acknowledge he merits punishment/* ob- 
served her mother ; ^' deceit and ingrati- 
tude are crimes of the blackest dye/' 

^'I attempt not to excuse him/' returned 
Miss Raymond, with an air of con fusion; 
'' but we often pity where we cannot for- 
give/* 

" True/* returned her mother â€” '' but 
we delay Mr. Munro/' 

Osmond bowed, and then went on â€” 

"But I will be convinced â€” thoroughly 
convinced/' cried Montana, as he travers- 
ed, with disordered steps, the solitary 

chamber. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 97 

chamber^ to which he had retreated^ on 
hearing of the perfidy of his young and 
hitherto highly-esteemed friend, '' that 
Carlo has deceived me, ere I accuse him 
of baseness, so revolting to my nature is 
the idea of the apology I should think it 
incumbent to make, did I revile him 
without cause. I will visit him at Clarizio 
â–  â€” on the evidence of my own senses will 
I alone acquit or condemn him, should he 
prove the traitor he has been represented. 

Why then," he paused â€” his dark eyes 

rolled gloomily in their orbits, and fell 
upon a dagger. â€” '' Why then," viewin^^- 
with a ghastly smile, the shining instru- 
ment of destruction, '' that shall avenp-e 
me!" 

He tried to hope he should find Carlo 
innocent; but when he reflected on the 
tenor of his conduct since his marriao*e, 
the strange and confused excuses he had 
made, for not accepting any one of the 
many pressing invitations he had given 
him and his Lady to Naples, and the 
^ 2 equally 



28 THE DISCARDED SON. 

equally ridiculous ones he had offered/ for 
not sending him one in return to Clarizio, 
he feared â€” greatly feared^ he should find 
himself disappointed in this hope. 

With the utmost secrecy^ that, if injured^ 
his intended vengeance might not be frus- 
trated, he set out for his friend's man- 
sion. 

The crush pf worlds could not have asto- 
nished Carlo more than the information of 
his being at his gate. His feelings/ on the 
occasion, were aggravated by the restraint 
he was forced to impose upon them. 

With counterfeited, he flattered him- 
self, w^ell counterfeited joy, he hastened 
to give him welcome, but he was mistaken. 
Ill at dissembling, and taken beside by 
surprise, every look, every gesture, be- 
trayed the inward workings of his soul, 
and left the keen penetrating Montana, 
almost the instant he cast his eyes upon 
him, without a doubt of his being the vil- 
lain he had been represented. 

It was night when he reached the Castle 

of 



THE DISCARDED SON, 29 

of Clai'izio, and he retired to his magnifi- 
cent apartment without seeing Isabella ; 
for at the first intimation of his appra?.ch 
her husband had conjured her to retire to 
her's, nor leave it till she had seen him, 
promising the moment they again met, 
to assign his motives for this seemingly 
strange injunction. 

The instant he was at liberty, he* flew to 
ber^ and at her feet unburthened his heart 
of the anguish that oppressed it ; confessed 
the perfidy her charms had caused him to 
be guilty of, and, in the name oF love, 
implored her to keep herself out of the 
view of Montana. 

Isabella listened to him with astonish- 
ment, and a mixture of pleasure and pain. 
Her vanity was gratified by the convincing 
proof his conduct had given, of the power 
of her charms ; yet, at the same time, 
mortified to think she had been prevented 
achieving so noble a conquest as Montana 
would have been, his fortune and family 
being the first in Naples ; and with him, 
c 3 therefore. 



so THE DISCARDED SON. 

therefore^ she reflected, she should have 
enjoyed ali those pleasures she had so 
strong a propensity for, and for the priva- 
tion of which she no longer considered 
the iove and attentions of Carlo a sufficient 
recompenee. 

Carlo saw she was displeased, but owing 
to an inadvertent expression which es- 
caped her, imputed her being so solely to 
the false expectations with which he had 
inspired her, relative to Montana, of 
-whose intention to marry he could no 
longer keep her in ignorance.. 

The positive promise he required, to se- 
clude herself while Montana was their 
guest, he could not obtain. Nevertheless^, 
from the high opinion he entertained of 
her prudence, and the sincere affection he 
imagined she felt for him, he had no ap- 
prehension of her acting contrary to his 
"wishes; and under the pleasing hope of the 
storm he dreaded being averted by her 
compliance, he met Montana the ensuing 
morning, with something like hrs wonted

tranquillity. Short-lived was this tranquil- 
lity. At the very moment he was apolo- 
gizing for the non-appearance of Isabella, 
under the plea of indisposition^ a soft 
strain of music caused Montana to start 
with precipitation from him, and hasten to 
a distant apartment. With all the wildness 
and agitation of alarm^ Carlo followed, un- 
certain whether the strain proceeded from 
Isabella, or one of her attendants. His 
faculties became suspended by the shock he 
received, on finding it was from her. 

She introduced herself to Montana with 
all that winning sweetness, that simple ele- 
gance for which she was distinguished â€” a 
sweetness and elegance, that had her beau- 
ty been infinitely less than it was^, would 
still have rendered her a most attractive 
object. 

For a minute Montana was so over- 
powered â€” so dazzled by her charms, which 
never shone more brilliant than on this 
morning, so great were the pains her va- 
nity had induced her to take to set them 
off, that he was unable to speak or move, 
c 4 Then 



52 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Then recollecting the necessity there was 
for dissimulation at present in every in- 
stance with Carlo, in order to prevent any 
obstacles being thrown in the way of the 
revenge he meditated taking, he exerted 
himself to subdue his emotion ; and being 
an adept in what poor Carlo failed in^ name- 
ly, the art of disguising v/hat was passing 
in his mind, soon succeeded in quieting his 
apprehensions, and lulling h:m into a dan- 
gerous security. 

The ungovernable passion he conceived 
for Isabella, almost the instant he beheld 
her, made him rejoice at having what he 
looked upon as a fair pretext for dis- 
patching her husband. 

A few days after Jbis arrival at Ciarizio^ 
he proposed the amusement of the chace 
in the adjacent forest.** 

'' liei'e follows another break/* said Os- 
mond, '' but of no great length, as the pur- 
port of the succeeding lines evince/* 

''â€¢ Montana 



THE DISCARDED SON. 33 

'' Montana contrived to separate his un- 
suspecting host, by whose side he took 
care to keep, from his attendants, and on 
gaining a gloomy part of the forest, re- 
mote from that in which the chace was pur- 
suing, he complained of faintness, and 
proposed alighting. Carlo, of course, im- 
mediately dismounted, and hanging the 
bridles of the horses upon a tree, they pe- 
netrated still further into the bosom of the 
forest, Montana, with well dissembled 
weakness, leaning on the arm of the credu- 
lous Carlo. 

On a sudden he paused. â€” ''You grow 
worse, I fear,'' said Carlo, looking anxi- 
ously in his face, over which the dreadful 
passions, then labouring in his soul, had 
cast a ghastly hue, well caiculated'to inspire 
a belief of his being indisposed. 

''I do,'' replied Montana, speaking with 
affected difficulty. "â– ' Is this part of the 
forest totally uninhabited ?'' 

'' It is,'* returned Carlo, in a dejected 
tone^ conceiving the enquiry owing to his

requirins^ other assistance than he had the 
power of rendering him. 

'' Heard you not something this instant ? " 
asked Montana, grasping still more firmly 
the arm on which he leaned. â€” '' The bugle 
horn of the hunters perhaps/' 

'^ No/' answered Carlo ; " it was not the 
horn of the hunters, but the bell of the 
Chapel of Clarizio you heard striking/' 

*' Tliy knell '/' vociferated Montana, in a 
voice of thunder, and at the same instant 
plunged a dagger in his heart. 

" Die, traitor!" he exclaimed, as Carlo, 
on the withdrawing of his arm, staggered, 
and fell back. " Die, and to aggravate the 
pangs of death, krow that she for whom 
thou hast incurred this blow shall be mine 
â€” mine, ere the rrave has well hid thee 
from her view â€” mine too, with t\\e con- 
sciousness of my hand having precipitated 
thee into it. O fool, for a weak, fickle 
woman, to lose such a friend â€” to provoke 
such a foe, as I am ! â€” Fool, to hope, strip- 
ling as thou wert^ thou couldst outwit

'' The blow was merited/' said Carlo^ in 
accents scarcely intelligible; ''but my youth 
' â€” the powerful temptation, should have 
been considered as extenuations of my 

crime. My" Isabella he would have 

addedj but died with the loved name ho- 
vering on his lips. 

At the very moment, as was afterwards 
ascertained, that his repentant spirit for- 
sook its tenement of clay, Isabella, as she 
sat alone, contriving new decorations for 
the charms which had occasioned thisdread- 
ful catastrophe, was shocked and alarmed by 
a deep groan, as of' some one in mortal 
agony within her chamber â€” a circumstance,, 
as she was rather inclined to superstition,, 
which led her to imagine some evil was at 
hand. Her presentiment, however, of this 
by no means prepared her for what had 
happened. 

After the perpetration of this execrable 

deed, Montana lost no time in rejoining

the attendants; and having slightly wound- 
ed his arin^ and completely discomposed 
his dress^ in order to give colour to the 
tale he had fabricated^, to impose upon 
them^ informed them that he and their 
Lord had been suddenly beset by banditti^, 
from whom he had almost miraculously 
effected his escape^, but without being able 
to afford any assistance to his friend. 

They soon succeeded in finding the body 
of their murdered and beloved Lord ; his 
black hair drenched in gore, his manly fea- 
tures distorted by death. 

But thor.gh Montana had been able to 
impose upon their credulity, he had not 
been equally successful in imposing upon 
that of their Lady, owing to her superior 
!knovÂ»;Iedge of his character, and of the 
reaspn he had to be dissatisfied with Carlo. 
But though convinced he was his murderer, 
she was so equally certain, that to accuse 
him without being able to bring forward 
unquestionable proofs of his guilt, would 
only be io involve herself in additional 

trouble^ 



THE DISCARDED SON". ST 

trouble^ that she prevailed on herself to 
be silent with regard to her real opinion, 
solemnly, however, at the same time de- 
termining, if such proofs as the above ever 
fell in her way, not to neglect availing 
herself of them. 

Her affection for her Lord, though not 
so fervent as it had once been, owing to 
the levity of her disposition, was still too 
^sincere â€” too animated, not to make her 
bitterly deplore his death, especially when 
she reflected that she had been accessary 
to, or rather the occasion of it, by acting 
as she had done, in opposition to his 
wishes â€” the wishes of him, whose gentle- 
ness, whose tenderness, whose uniform 
study to promote her happiness had given 
him such claims upon her aiTection: she 
could not dwell upon this soid-harrowing 
idea without experiencing a degree of 
horror and remorse, that at times almost 
tempted her to lay violent hands upon 
herself 

Montana made several attempts to gain 

admission 



38 THE DISCARDED SON. 

admission to her chamber, all of which she 
repulsed wjth horror and disdain ; he was 
not, however, discouraged by this con- 
duct; he was persuaded he knew her better 
than she knew herself, and doubted not, 
therefore, her yet enabling him to accom- 
plish his prediction to her dying hus- 
band. 

On the day which beheld the remains of 
the youthful and once lovely Carlo con- 
signed to the tomb, a domestic picked up 
a dagger in the forest, which not doubting 
to have been the one wielded against him, 
he delivered, as in duty bound, to hi* 
Lady, hoping it might be the means of ena- 
bling her to trace his murderer. 

With shuddering horror, Isabella, as soon 
as she was left to herself, approached the 
table, on which, by her command, it had 
been laid, and minutely examining it, 
discovered, immediately beneath the han- 
dle, a small crest of the Montana family. 
This confirmation of her horrible suspi- 
cions for a few minutes threw her into 

agony. 



THE DISCAEDED SONT. 5Â§ 

agony. Then dropping on her knees â€” 
" May this dagger/' said she, grasping it 
between her trembling and uplifted hands, 
'' be sheathed in my heart, as it was in thine, 
ch Carlo! if I exert not myself to brin^T 
to punishment the cruel perpetrator of thy 
death/^ 

The room door was burst open as she 
spoke. She started up to chide the abrupt 
intruder, and beheld Montana. 

"Away, murderer!" she almost uncon- 
sciously exclaimed, shrieking, and shrink- 
ing back, on beholding him â€” '^away! let 
not my eyes be blasted by the sight of my 
husband's destroyer!'' 

Montana, however, v/as not to be awed 
from her presence : the storm which assail- 
ed him on forcing himself into it, neither 
surprised nor alarmed him; spite of it he 
maintained his ground, and with all the 
bold efifrontery of hardened guilt, per- 
sisted in denying the crime of which she 
accused him. 

His solemn protestations, however, of 

innocence 



40 THE DISCARDED SON. 

innocence shook not her opinion of his 
guilt; but though he failed of changing 
that opinion, strange, nay, horrible to re- 
late, he succeeded in appeasing the- re- 
sentment it inspired. His artful blandish- 
ments â€” his seductive wiles â€” his insinuat- 
ing flattery â€” his specious eloquence, at 
once dazzling and fascinating, gradually 
subdued her rage, by leading her to be- 
lieve it was alone owing to the irresistibi- 
lity of her charms that he had raised his 
hand against the life of her husband. In 
short, gratified vanity disarmed just indig- 
nation, and Montana v/as pardoned, on 
account of the motives she imputed his 
guilt to. 

I will not, Laura, needlessly lengthen 
this narrative by commenting on her con- 
duct â€” a narrative I am at times almost 
tempted to think it idle for me to continuCj. 
so great is my uncertainty of its ever* 
reaching your hands. My health is declin- 
ing fast, and if not transmitted to you be- 
fore my pilgrimage is ended, there is but

THE DISCARDED SON. 41 

little probability that it ever will ; for 
here no kind friend is at hand to catch my 
last faltering accents^ or pay obedience to 
my dying wishesâ€” but to proceed â€” 

Isabella â€” the vain and perjured Isabella^ 
became the bride of Montana^ ere, as he 
had predicted, the marble jaws of Carlo's 
sepulchre were well closed upon him. â€” 
The passion which had induced him to ask 
her hand, was, as he had himself foreseen, 
from his perfect knowledge of the incon- 
stancy of his own disposition, but of 
short duration. The contempt in which 
he held her for the levity of her conduct â€” - 
a contempt w^hich precluded his placing 
the smallest confidence in her, and made 
him conceive her unv, orthy of bearing his 
name, hastened its extinction ; as did i^tili 
further, the horror with which at times her 
base ingratitude to the memory of Carlo 
caused him to view her, w^ho, though he 
had ofiended him, had not offended, but 
adored her. 

Weariness 



4S THE DISCARDED SON. 

Weariness was shortly succeeded by a 
resolution to rid himself of her^ and thus 
make room for some other female, more 
deserving of his esteem, and the honour of 
perpetuating his name. Yet fickle as he was, 
and by this time hardened in iniquity, this 
was a resolution he probably never would 
have formed, but for the dreadful opinion 
he had conceived of Isabella, in conse- 
quence of her acceptance ofthe hand which 
she was conscious had shed the blood of 
her husband, and that too without any pas- 
sion to plead in extenuation of the crime 
she was guilty of; for well Montana knew 
he w^as no longer an object calculated to 
inspire love, faded and injured as his ap- 
pearance w^as by the licentious life he had 
long led. 

After their nuptials, he had taken her to 
Naples; they now returned to Clarizio, 
its solitude favourino: the desi^^ns he medi- 
tated against her life. Though unsuspi- 
cious of these designs, Isabella felt a terror 

she 



THE DISCARDED SON. 43 

she could not account for, at the thoughts 
of remaining there any time with himâ€” a 
terror not diminished by the mournful air 
of desolation^ the neglect it had expe- 
rienced from the period of their departure 
had occasioned it to wear. 

The affecting remembrances her return 
awakened, w^ere all that at this period waÂ»s 
wanting to complete the excruciating an- 
guish repentance and regret gave birth to; 
both of which Montana, in all their bitter- 
ness, had made her experience, ere she had 
been loDg his wife. 

Scarcely had she alighted from the car- 
riage, which reconveyed her to the belov- 
ed scenes of her early youth â€” the scenes of 
all her happiness with Carlo, ere a thousand 
tender recollections rushing on her soul, 
she fled, with an irrepressible cry of de- 
spair, to the chapel where his remains re- 
posed. 

Already the gloom of closing day per- 
vaded it, involving the remote parts in a 
fearful obscurity, and heightening the me- 
< lancholy 



44 THE DISCARDED SON. 

lancholyappearance of such objects as were 
distinguishable. 

Isabella paused beneath the porch;, ay/ed 
by the dim light, and a consciousness of 
unworthiness, from entering the holy place. 
Her e^e, however, eagerly darted forward 
to the tomb of her husband. She shrieked ; 
for at the instant a beautiful effigy of her- 
self, bending in a mourning attitude over 
the recumbent figure^ tottered^ and fell 
down. 

'*^0h:, Carlo â€” beloved Carlo l" exclaimed 
the now nearly frantic Isabella, rushing 
forward, and prostrating herself before his 
tomb, amidst the fragments of her broken 
effigy, ''is this â€” is this to indicate that thy 
pure spirit will hold no converse with 
mine in the other world ? â€” Oh, if so, re- 
voke the cruel determination ; let the 
voice of anguishâ€” the sincerity of my re- 
pentance, move thee to take compassion 
on me. Intercede for me with him, ve 
whose happy spirits mingle with his in the 
regions of the blest â€” -intercede for me with 

him," 



THE DISCARDED SON. 45 

him/' turning, by degrees, on her knees 
towards the monument of her parents, 
â– where stood their efng^ies. 

Again she shrieked and shrunk back; for 
a rising wind rushing furiously through 
the chapel, at the moment, shook the 
time-struck edifice, and for a moment 
made her imagine the figures about falling 
to crush her beneath them for her guilt. 

'' Oh, woe is me V she cried, '' abandon- 
ed of all," and smiting her fair bosom, she 
again prostrated herself on the ground. â€” 
Ker heart ascended in fervent prayer to 
Him whose ear is ever open to the cry of 
wretchedness and penitence. The warmth 
of her devotion by degrees a little calmed 
the perturbation of her spirit ; she reflect- 
ed on the remission of sins, promised to 
the penitent, and a gleam of comfort stole 
athwart her mind. 

She was suddenly interrupted by a noise; 
she looked up, and beheld at some dis- 
tance a faint light, resembling that which 
shaded tapers give. By degrees it cleared, 

and 
5 



-C6 THE DISCARDED so^^ 

and discovered to her view the figure of a 
man, leaning against an open door at the 
side of the chapel. 

Concluding him an attendant sent by 
Montana for her, and who, from unwil- 
lingness to disturb her devotions, had left 
his taper outside the chapel, and remained 
silent, she immediately arose ; but lest she 
should be mistaken, she enquired whether 
it was as she supposed ? 

He replied by bending his head, and ex- 
tending his arm towards the door. 

Isabella nodded. â€” ''I understand you," 
she cried ; '' lead on, I follow to my 
Lord.'^ 

He obeyed by gliding out before her, and 
led through several windings and turnings, 
to a remote apartment, in which Montana 
sat, and at the door of which he vanished, 
she knew not how, from her sight. 

On entering, she was alarmed, by Mon- 
tana fiercely dem-anding, as he started from 
a couch on which he was reclining, what 
had brought her there ? 

His 



THE DISCARDED SON. 47 

His commands, she replied, in an hum- 
ble and affrighted tone, his brutality having 
intimidated her â€” a brutality occasioned by 
his rage at having been broken in upon, at 
the very moment he was deliberating on the 
safest method to himself of putting her to 
death. 

'^ Tis false,'' he returned, his eyes gleam- 
ing, his lips quivering; '' I sent no mes- 
sage/' 

'' I understood from ohc of your at- 
tendants you had done so,'' she returned, 
in still more submissive accents than she 
had before spoken in. 
- " Let me know which of them," with 
encreasing fury, he cried, " had the auda- 
city to utter so impertinent a falsehood ?'* 

'' None of them," she replied; ''it was 
only from the gestures of the man I con- 
cluded you had sent for me." 

" Then now that you know I did not, 
away!" he cried, ''and let not your vanity 
again deceive you into a belief that I desire 
your company ; I have already had too 

much 



43 THE DISCAUDED SON. 

much of It â€” more than I ever will again/* 
in an under tone, he added, and with a 
look of dreadful meaning. 

The wretched Isabella withdrew from his 
pre5:ence in tears, but tears more of sorrow 
than iridi<xnation. With trembling steps 
she proceeded towards the apartment she 
was wont to occupy*; but ere she reached 
it, the memorials she every where beheld 
of departed happiness so w^orked upon her 
feelings, that in a paroxysm of anguish she 
cast herself on the ground. 

As she wept she fancied she heard herself 
called ; she raised her head, and beheld, at 
a distance, the person who had disturbed 
her in the chapel. 

It instantly struck her that Montana, re- 
penting him of the savageness of his recent 
conduct, had sent to request her to return 
â€” a request which nothing but the awe she 
stood in of him, his society, by this time, 
being quite as hateful to her as hers was 
to him, could have induced her to think 
of obeying. 

In 



THE DISCARDED SON. 49 

In much confusion at being thus sur- 
prised, she started up, and finding the 
supposed messenger did not speak, de- 
sired to know whether he had been sent for 
her? 

A bow was again the only way in which 
he replied to her. 

" Nay, my friend,*' said she, in a mild 
accent, '' you must speak, lest otherwise I 
again mistake your meaning â€” say, are you 
sent for me ?'* 

After the pause of a minute, a low but 
most emphatic voice replied â€” '' I am." 

Isabella directly returned, though with 
the greatest reluctance, to Montana; but 
what was her amazement, when on again 
appearing before him, she heard herself 
reviled with still greater fury than she had 
before been for intruding on him ! 

" Strange," said Isabella, roused to 
something like indignation, by his con- 
temptuous treatment, '' that you should 
call that intrusion which you have your- 
self desired ; I made your messenger 

VOL. IV. D assure 



10 THE DISCARDED SON. 

assure me this time I was sent for^ ere I 
came/' 

"Who is this impertinent â€” this lying 
messenger of whom you speak ?" demand- 
ed Montana^ with encreasing fury. 

'' One of your own hirelings, I suppose/* 
returned Isabella; "and what is more/* 
added she, with kindling eyes, " one who, 
like his master, has, I conclude, comm.itted 
some deed that makes him fear to shew his 
face, as he took care not to let me catch a 
glimpse of it." 

"Hah, insolence, and to me !" exclaim- 
ed Montana. 

Isabella in terror attempted to retreat ; 
but suddenly grasping her arm., he flung 
her to another part of the room, and im- 
mediately locked the door. 

" Nay, you shall now stay,'* cried he, 
returning to her. Then, with a malicious 
grin, (when a man has any mischief in his 
head, how readily does the devil furnish 
him with an oppox^funity of committing it!) 
twisting, as he spoke, one hand in her 

long 



THE DISCARDED SON. 51 

long floating tresses^ and searching in his 
bosom with the other. 

Isabella shrieked and struggled^ for the 
hilt of a dagger gleamed upon her sight. 

" Monster ! " she exclaimed, " do you 
mean to murder me?" 

^^''Do you not wish to be re-united to 
Carlo ?" asked Montana, with a ghastly 
countenance, and chattering teeth. 

''I do/' replied Isabella, panting with 
terror, " but " 

" And so you shall!" vociferated Mon- 
tana, drawing the dagger still further from 
his bosom. 

Isabella again shrieked and struggled, but 
in vain, to disengage herself from his 
grasp. 

"' Your shrieks â€” your struggles are use- 
less," said Montana; '' we are remote from 
the other inhabitants of the castle ; and 
even if we were not, who is there would 
dare to have the temerity to interfere be- 
tween us.'^ My soul has long been weary 
D 2 of 



52 THE DISCARDED SON. 

of you ; and what I dislike I never endure 
longer than necessity compels me." 

*^'Monster/' cried Isabella, '^'have you no 
fears for your own life, if you deprive me 
of mine?'* 

*^' None/' replied he, with the .-^xulting 
smile of a daemon. '''The manner in which 
I shall account for your death will prevent 
any suspicion of my being the cause of it. 
Carlo left a widow to prosecute me for his 
murder, yet 1 suffered no punishment for 
it. Isabella, unlike him, leaves no tender 
relative behind her to enquire into her 
fate ; what, therefore, should I fear on 
her account ?" 

As he spoke he drew the dagger from 
beneath his garment: for a minute he 
held it suspended over the head of his vic- 
tim, then struck it to her breast â€” she fell, 
and he instantly hurried to the door, to 
make good his retreat from the blood- 
stained apartment. As he was extending 
his hand to open it, a strange myste- 
rious- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 53 

rious-looking figure glided between him 
and it. 

He started back^ at once alarmed and 
dismayed^ for there was nothing in the 
chamber capable of affording concealment 
to any one ; neither any door to it but 
the one he had thus been prevented reach- 
ing." 

His panic^ however, was but momentary; 
the recollection of his safety being at stake 
made him speedily recover himself, and 
rush forward for the purpose of seizing 
the intruder, and one way or other silenc- 
ing him. But as he attempted to seize 
him, he eluded his grasp, yet, to his en- 
creasing amazement, without appearing to 
move." 

" Stop, Signor, stop,'* here interrupt- 
ed Mactalla, in a hurried accent, and with 
his eyes almost starting from his head; " I

ber, listened a considerable tirae^ but 
without hearing ought but the pealing 
thunder, and the whistling of the wind 
through the crevif^s, and long-drawn pas>- 
sages of the building: â€” 

" A music of (he night, that makes the teeth chatter, and the 
nails turn blue." 

'' Your ear deceived you," he at length 
said, addressing Mactalla, as he resumed 
his seat, and, at the request of his fair 
companions, the manuscript. 

'' A sensation more powerful than terror 
now took possession of Montana ; his feet 
became rooted to the floor â€” his eyes rivet- 
ted on the mysterious stranger. At length 
his features, which had hitherto been con- 
cealed by the intervention of his hand, be- 
came visible to him, and he beheld those 
pf the murdered Carlo! â€” at the same in- 
stant his coloured vest gave place to a 
shroud, which falling from his left breast, 
disclosed a gaping wound ! 

The blow inflicted on Isabella was not 

imme-

immediately mortal. The dreadful groan 
which burst from Montana, at this moment, 
caused her to unseal her eyes, and she be- 
held the apparition that had so alarmed 
him. She instantly made an eflbrt to rise 
and approach the spectre of her husband, 
but an unavailing one; the hand of death 
v/as on her, and chained her to the floor. 

Dreadful shrieks^ as of one in mortal 
agony, now resounded through the castle; 
the aflrighted domestics immediately col- 
lected, and guided by these, repaired to 
the apartment where this horrid catas- 
trophe had been acted. 

They found their Lady weltering in her 
blood on the floor, their Lord transfixed . 
and silent, his faculties apparently benumb- 
ed by horror. 

Isabella lived sufficiently long to relate 
all that had recently happened, and the 
circumstances that led to it, as the last 
sigh hovered on her lips. 

''The ways of Providence are just," said 

she; '' let no one dare to arraign them; nei-

pierced the heart of my husband might be 
sheathed in mine^ if I took not vengeance 
on his murderer, and my guilt in breaking 
the vow I made has been punished by the 
accomplishment of that prayer. 

" Montana thought, from the precau-

making any effort indicative of his having 
heard this order. 

Osmond repeated it.

" Then go out and seek for more/' said 
his master. 

Mactalla trembled. 

^' Felisco will accompany you/' said Os- 
mond, readily comprehending the cause 
of his tremor, and reluctance to obey him. 

Felisco, however, shewed no greater in- 
clination to move than he did, 

"What," 



THE DISCARDED SON. 59 

'^ What/' demanded Osmond^ turning 
his eyes on him, '^ have silly fears also laid 
hold on you ? â€” Come/' added he, starting 
from his seat, " follow me, and I will take 
care that no ghost or hobgoblin runs away 
with either of you whilst looking for 
wood." 

He was prevented, however, quitting the 
apartment, by a gentle intimation from 
Miss Raymond, of her unwillingness for 
him to leave them. He directly reseated 
himself, but almost unconsciously, so vio- 
lent was the emotion this incident, trifling 
as it v/as, excited. What would he not 
have given at the moment, to have been 
able to satisfy himself as to the real mo- 
tive of her reluctance to let him leave 
her!

presumptuous idea â€” he did more, he re-

sentiments of a tender nature on her part 
for him would experience from her father, 
and of consequence the unhappiness which 
must result to her from entertaining 
such. 

" Oh, never^ never nay her soft bo- 
som/' he sighed to himself, '' know a pang- 
on my account ; dear and transporting as 
I cannot deny to myself would be the con- 
eviction of her feeling an interest for me,

my present circumstances I should deem

I am of the insuperable obstacles fortune

" I should consider myself lost to gene-

sentiment for me than friendship/' 

By this time nothing remained on the 
hearth but expiring embers, which, as

Mactalla and Felisco ever and anon stir- 
red into a blaze^ with the end of their 
whipS;, served but to render darkness visi- 
ble. 

At length the faint light that emanated 
from these died av;ay, leaving the party in- 
volved in impenetrable gloom. 

" I dare say/' cried Mactalla^ not a little 
pleased at finding his master had ceased im- 
portuning him to go out for fuel^and trust- 
ing the observation he was about making 
would prevent his repeating the command, 
" that it cannot now be far from day/' 

" Tis not possible to see the hour/' 
said his master^ " but I am inclined to 
think 'tis not so late as you imagine.*' 

Miss Raymond pressed the spring of her 
repeater â€” it struck half past one. 

'â€¢'What's that ?" asked Mactalla, eagerly; 
'^ I heard something tick like a clock." 

" Miss Raymond's watch/' replied his 
master, ''striking half past one."

accent^ exclaimed Mactalla^ â€¢''â–  what a time 
we have to remain in this dismal place !" 

It had been previously settled by Os- 
mond and the ladies, that even though the 
storm sborild subside before daybreak^ 
they should not till then quit the ruin, on 
account of the loneliness of the ways 
about it. 

*' Be silent/^ said his master, in conse- 
quence of fancying he heard at the mo- 
ment the trampling of horses. 

'' What/' cried Mactalla, repiningly, 
'*" is the only comfort one can have in such 
a situation as this, that of chatting, and 
thereby knowing one is in safe company, 
to be taken from us?" 

*' Yes, especially when you seem in- 
clined to talk nonsense." 

'' Well," resumed Mactalla, after a short, 
but general silence, ^^ since this is the case, 
Felisco and I will go out and search for 
fuel, for any thing is better than remaining 
quiet in such a situation." 

^^ Silence, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 63 

" Silence, I say again/* cried Osmond^, 
in a more authoritative tone than he had 
ever before assumed towards him^, occa- 
sioned by hisnow plainly distingnishinguot 
only the trampling of horses but the voices 
of men. 

The reason of this injunction was quick- 
ly understood by the rest of the party^ and 
their terror became unspeakable. 

Osmond endeavoured to calm the fears of 
the ladies, although trembling himself 
with apprehension for tiiem, owing to Fe- 
lisco having in a whisper informed him, 
that the horsemen they henrd, and who 
were evidently approaching the ruin, were, 
he much feared, a party of freebooters, 
but too probably those they had escaped 
from. 

In a few minutes the clattering of horses 
hoofs upon the flagged area before the 
building, announced them at hand, and 
shortly after a tremendous crash, that they 
had burst into it. 

Osmond instantly dropped the trembling 
4 hand 



64 THE DISCARDED SON. 

hand which Miss Raymond no doubt un- 
consciously had placed in his^ and groped 
his way to the door of the apartment^ to 
try whether there was any fastening to it. 
None, however, meeting his hand, he 
placed himself against it, and, in a low 
voice, called to Felisco and Mactalla to 
do the same. They obeyed, and Mr. Ray- 
mond, whom tlie noise occasioned by ^the 
bursting open of the outer door had awak- 
ened, and to whom Mrs. Raymond, in 
whispering accents, imparted the appre- 
hensions they were under, also approached 
to lend his assistance in defending it. 

The voices of the intruders were soon 
heard in horrid uproar echoing through 
the ruin, and their heavy steps in a few mi- 
nutes approaching the apartment where the 
travellers were shut up. 

A deep groan, followed by a low excla- 
mation from Mrs. Raymond, now gave Os- 
mond to understand that Miss Raymond 
had fainted. The pain this intimation gave 
him was rendered more acute^ by his being 

withheld 



THE DISCARDED SON. 65 

withheld from rendering her any assist- 
ance, owing to his dread of being over- 
heard. 

" Prithee/' suddenly exclaimed a voice, 
at no great distance from the chamber â€” a 
voicCj which^ to his inexpressible horror^ 
Osmond immediately recollected to be that 
of one of the ruffians they had escaped 
from, '' I say, prithee Tivoli^, dost think 
this ruin inhabited ?'' 

" Zounds, hovv should I know any thing 
-of the matter?" grumbled out Tivoli; " the 
devil may have taken possession of it for 
what I know or care. It appears, how- 
ever, as if it was, by the door being fas- 
tened on the inside, and which you may 
recollect the last time we were here we 
found open." 

" True," replied the first speaker, ''that's 
what made me think so, and ask you the 
question, which caused you to growl so. 

D n me, Tivoli, I see clearly you'll 

never learn complaisance.'* 

'' Whilst 



66 THE DISCARDED SON. 

^' Whilst I keep company with you, you 
should have added/' said Tivoli. 

'' Ha, ha, not badly retorted, you dog,'' 
cried the other ; " I see you can cut with 
something besides your sword; but lest 
you should be too vain, let me tell you, 
Tivoli, your wit, like your sword, some- 
times wants sharpening ; 'tis dull â€” -dull at 
times as " 

'' Your own," returned Tivoli, " grant- 
ed, but that's only when there is not a tool 
at hand like you to whet it on." 

'' Well said, my boy," shouted the other, 
'' I see you improve." 

*' I am sorry truth won't allow me to re- 
turn the compliment," said Tivoli. 

'' Well, v^eW, no matter," said the 
other ; " instead of prating in this idle 
manner, had we not better search about to 
try whether tiie place be inhabited or not; 
as if it be, we may chance to light upon 
something comfortable, which, after the 
cursed drenching we have had, we stand 

much 



THE DISCARDED SON. 67 

much in need of. One would almost be 
tempted to think the devil owed us a 
grudge^ from the dreadful storms we have 
lately been overtaken by.'* 

" Nay^ no one that knows you could be 
tempted to think he owes you a grudge," 
cried Tivoli;, *"*â–  since they must know he 
has not any where a more faithful ser- 
vant." 

'' Yourself excepted/' returned the 
other^ '' for I think he has quite as much 
reason to be pleased with your services as 
he has with mine : but again I say this is 
idle talk; let's hunt about to try whether 
there be any thing living within the build- 
ing beside ourselves and the rats." 

'' Hunt about as much as you please by 
yourself," cried Tivoli, in a more surly 
accent than ever, " for curse me if I bear 
you company, I am already so fatigued by 
the rate at which we have rode ; beside, 
upon reflection, I am convinced that the 
door being: closed was owins: to the wind 
slapping it to, and thus causing the bolt 

to 



68 THE DISCARDED SON. 

to shoot ; for^ to my knowledge, the 
country people in the neighbourhood hold 
the place in too great dread to think of en- 
tering it^ at least after sunset; and as to 
travellers, you know 'tis entirely out of 
anv beaten tract/' 

'' Aye^ aye/' assented the other, " I 
suppose you are right ; I know^ as well as 
you that the simpletons about it think the 
devil holds his court in it sometimes, 
which to be sure, considering who its for- 
mer inhabitants were, one can't be much 
surprised at their doing." 

'' I wish with all my heart he had those in 
his clutches who have occasioned our being 
in it now/' said Tivoli. '' Our captain de- 
serves to be poniarded for not having 
put his prisoners to death at once ; if he 
had, what a troublesome business would 
have been saved us ! " 

" Well, well, take my word for it, he 
has learned wisdom," rejoined the other, 
''and should be excused now, for not 
doing what you think he ought, since who 

could 



THE DISCARDED SON. 69 

could have supposed such a trick would 
have been played him?" 

" Why not such a numskull as you^ to 
be sure/' cried Tivoli; '' but for my part, 
I never placed any confidence in that fox, 
Felisco ; I saw all along he was d â€” n â€” bly 
sly and deceitful ; and as to that velvet- 
tongued dog he called his friend, by the 
lord they are birds of a feather." 

'' Kay, as to my not suspecting them," 
said the other, in a tone which proclaimed 
him somewhat displeased by these observa- 
tions, '' I think it no disparagement what- 
ever of my sagacity not having done so. â€” 
Here's Rivorola, who all must allow as 
keen as a hawk, and yet he had no distrust 
whatever of them." 

*^ No, that I hadn't," exclaimed a new 
voice ; '' but with all their cunning, I 
think we shall yet be a match for them, 
now we've got scent of them. What a 
lucky thing our enquiring of the shepherds 
as we came along ! by the lord, I long more 
to have that traitor, Felisco, by the pole, 

than

than ever I did to rob a Cardinal ; for it 
was he, I am convinced, who contrived 
their escape, and proposed their cutting 
across the country, in the manner they 
have done. Those who pursued them the 
straight road have already, I suppose, re- 
linquished the chace, and returned home." 

'' No doubt,'' said Tivoli, '' and mad 
enough, I warrant, at having had only 
their pains for their trouble." 

" I mean," cried Rivorola, " to entreat 
the captain, as a particular favour, to let 
me have the settling of Felisco myself. As 
soon as I have tired myself torturing him, 
I shall flea him alive, as St. Bartholomew 
was." 

^^''And I," said Tivoli, '*^in order not to 
let his friend Mactalla have reason to com- 
plain of being treated in a less handsome 
manner, shall broil him on a gridiron, like 
St. Lawrence : as for the rest of the party, 
we'll poniard them on the spot." 

''^All but the young girl," cried Rivo- 
rola^ in the most horrid accent ; '' for let 

me 



THE DISCARDED SON. 7 1 

me tell you, comrades, she's a d â€” nd deal 
too pretty to be sent out of the world yet 
awhile ; I mean to ask the captain, who, 
by the by, ow^es me some remuneration 
for past services, to let me have her; and 
in order to prevent her creating any dis- 
turbance amongst us, as 1 know he'll dread^ 
I'll keep her confined in a remote part of 
the castle/' 

'' Do," said Tivoli ; '' and let it be also 
in a dark room, for curse me, else the sight 
of your cadaverous phiz will cause her to 
lay violent hands on herself, rather than re- 
main in your power." 

"Pshaw! "returned Rivorola, as if vexed, 
^'jesting is not in season always," walking 
away as he spoke, and quickly followed by 
the other two to the greatrelief of the con- 
cealed party. 

As soon as they were completely out of 
hearing, Felisco asked Osmond, in a whis- 
per, whether he had noticed that ruffian^, 
Rivorola, during the time he was at the 
castle ? 

On 



72 THE DISCARDED SON. 

On being answered in the negative â€” 
'^ He's the most atrocious of the gang/* 
proceeded Felisco, in the same low key ; 
" but for nothing so remarkable as for his 
excessive cruelty, insomuch that he is bet- 
ter known amongst his comrades by the ap- 
pellation of the bloodhound^ than his own 
name. You probably thought him jesting 
with regard to what he threatened con- 
cerning me, but I make no doubt, if in 
his power, he'd be as good as his word." 

'' And that villain, Tivoli,*' cried Mac- 
talla, in a low, but nevertheless indignant 
tone, " he would keep his with regard to 
me, I suppose. By the pov/ers, I wish I 
had him in a snug corner, out of the hear- 
ing of any one, at least any one inclined to 
serve him, and if I wouldn't make his bones 
as hot as he wishes to make mine, my name 
is not Mac â€” '- â€” ; by the lord I'd give him a 
roasting and a broiling, and that too with- 
out being at the trouble of laying him on 
a gridiron for the purpose." 

The fears of the travellers experienced 

but 



TtfE DISCARDED SON. 'f 5 

but a short suspension. They were quick- 
ly revived by the returning steps of the 
ruffians^, and their stopping within a few 
yards of the apartment, as if, from their 
suddenly ceasing to speak, for the purpose 
of listening. 

The heart of Osmond almost ceased to 
beat at the moment, since, from this cir- 
cumstance, he entertained scarce a doubt 
of their having heard some noise withla it^ 
which had excited their suspicions, and 
would of consequence occasion them to 
attempt entering it. Not on his own ac- 
count, however, did he experience the 
terror which now shook his frame; it was 
chiefly for his companions he trembled 
with apprehension â€” for the honest-hearted 
Felisco, who, in serving him, had, he 
feared, incurred a death of torture â€” for 
the fair, the gentle Cordelia. 

After a fearful â€” an agonizing silence of 
some, minutes, his feelings were again, 
somewhat relieved by hearing Rivorola ex- 
claim â€” 

VOL. IT. E '' Tis 



7i THE DISCARDED SON. 

^'^ Tis d â€” nd cold;" â€” and Tivoli, in 
grumbling accents^ enquiring why then he 
remained where he was ? 

" Because/' replied Rivorola, '' I fan- 
cied I heard a noise hereabouts." 

'' D â€” mn it/' returned Tivoli^ *^'' one 
%vould fancy you had a legion of ghosts at 
your heels, for you are always imagining 
vou hear a noise; to be sure you heard a 
noise here, but it was only that occasioned 
by the wind ; curse me if it doesn't blow 
cold enouoh to turn one to stone/' 

''^ Would that the storm was abated/* 
said Rivorola, " for I am impatient to be 
off, 1 so much dread the fugitives getting 
beyond our reach. Once at Venosa, and we 
may bid them good-by, since, doubtless^ 
there they'll take every precaution to en- 
sure their safety the remainder of the jour- 
ney.'* 

'^ Pshaw ! I have told you already, and 
I now tell you again, there is no danger of 
their escaping us, close as we have hitherto 



THE DISCARDED SDK. 75 

as there is of their being able to brave this 
storm, since we couldn't/* 

'' Speak for yourself/' cried Rivorola, 
indignantly ; '' I tell you I could have 
braved it if my horse would/' 

'' Ah ! and as to that/' replied Tivoli, in 
a savage tone, ^'I believe I am not the 
man to flinch from a thing of the kind ; I'd 
ride through a whirlwind if my beast 
would but carry me/' 

'' Let's see whether the sky clears/' said 
Rivorola, and again they walked away. 

They soon, however, returned, accom- 
panied by several of their companions, 
and again, to the inexpressible conster- 
nation of the travellers, stopped within 
a few paces of their retreat, as if meditat- 
ing an attack upon it, in which his appre- 
hensions of their doing, Osmond was near- 
ly confirmed by hearing one of them, in a 
hurried accent, exclaim â€” 

'"^Ha, do you think so? let's try ther^ 
that we may be out of doubt on the sub- 



76 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Tivoli's opposition to this proposal 
quickly^ however, relieved him from his 
dreadful fears. 

'^ I tell you/' said the surly villain, 
*' 'twas nothing but the wind you heard; 
so don't go to risk your neck by poking 
your nose into the holes and corners of 
this d â€” nd rumbling old edifice, since w^e 
have nothing at hand at present to enable 
us to repair it, in case it met with a frac- 
ture." 

Again the ruffians quitted the vicinity of 
the chamber, but again returned to it, and 
in this way continued for a considerable 
time, walking to and fro, to the extreme 
agitation of the travellers, as from sen- 
tences they occasionally overheard, they 
were not without apprehensions of their 
yet endeavouring to force their way to 
them. 

At length, to their unutterable joy, they 
heard one of them say â€” '' Come, come, 
lads, this delay will never do ; whether it 
ckars or not, we must be off directly." 

Upon 



THE DISCARDED BON. 77 

Upon which another immediately hal- 
loed â€” "Rivorola, as you are next the door, 
take a peep to see how the weather is." 

After the silence of a minute â€” ''' The 
rain is just over, and the sky clears apace/' 
shouted Rivorola. 

''Good news!" exclaimed the others^ as 
if with one voice; '' we'll to horse direct- 
ly." 

Accordingly, in the course of a few mi- 
nutes, the travellers had the satisfaction 
of hearing them gallop off. 

'' Blessed be St. Benedict," cried Mac- 
talla, with fervour, as he heard them de- 
parti ng, *^ for attending to my pray- 
ers." 

Osmond enjoined him silence a little 
longer, lest, by ways they w^ere not aware 
of, some of the banditti might unexpect- 
edly return. The idea that this might be 
the ease induced him to remain at the 
door until the grey light of early day per- 
vaded the apartment, and labourers were 
heard in the adjacent fields. He then, quit- 
E 3 tin<^' 



78 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ting the unpleasant station he had so long 
occupied^ and approaching the ladies^ of- 
fered his warmest congratidations to them 
on the happy termination of the perils of 
the night. 

Miss Raymond^ though by this time per- 
fectly restored to her senses, still appeared 
so faint and indisposed, as did also her 
mother, that Osmond advised their endea- 
vouring to obtain a little repose, ere they 
thought of renewing their journey. 

Their following this advice, however, 
was strongly opposed by Mr. Raymond, in 
consequence of his impatience to reach 
Venosa, and his needing no rest himself, 
after the long repose he had enjoyed in the 
course of the night. 

They appeared, however, so inclined 
to attend to it, that Osmond, know- 
ing they were now in perfect safety, de- 
termined to pay no attention to Mr. Ray- 
mond's wishes for immediately depart- 
ing. 

In Qrder, however, to avoid a second 

alterca- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 79 

altercation with him, the idea of which, on 
account of the ladies, being highly disagree- 
able to his feelings, he made the absolute 
necessity there was for allowing the horses 
some little time to feed and refresh them- 
selves, after being shut up so many hours 
without Ibod, the excuse for not indulg- 
ing him in the present instance. 

Mr. Raymond continued with his wife 
and daughter, evidently angry and discon- 
tented, at his wishes, relative to setting 
off immediately, not being complied with; 
and Osmond, ordering Mactalla to remain 
near the chamber, proceeded himself with 
Felisco to liberate the horses. 

The storm of the preceding night was 
now entirely passed away. The morning 
advanced with calmness, and as the clouds 
of night faded from the hills, a thousand 
beautiful objects started to view. The 
rural â€” the luxuriant landscape was render- 
ed still more attractive, by the groups of 
joyous labourers scattered throughout it; 
Â£4 it 



80 THE DlSCAf.BfD SON. 

it being now the autnmnal season, when the 
first gleam of day calls to the field the chil- 
dren of rural labour. 

Immediately adjoining the ruin^ all still 
continued quiet and lonely. The lux- 
uriant plain on which it stood was thinly 
scattered over with flocks, that unmolcnted 
cropped the flowery pasture ; and in the 
'woods of solemn gloom that overhung and 
nearly environed it, scarce any sound was 
heard but that of their shuddering foliage, 
as the light breeze swept through thcrn. 
The freshness of the n^oi^tened earth, the 
exhaling sweetness of the shrubs and flow- 
ers that abounded on every side, the bright- 
ening glories of the hour, had the effect of 
removing the languor which the dreadful 
agitation and anxiety of the preceding 
night occasioned Osmond to feel, but fail- 
ed of restoring him to his wonted tran- 
quillity or cheerfulness. 

For once the dripping rock, the moun- 
tain's misty top, swelled on his sight, and 

bright- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 81 

brightened with the dawn, without awaking 
a sensation of pleasure in his mind. The 
idea of the succeeding day being the last 
which he should in all probability pass in the 
society of Miss Raymond â€” the last in which 
he should have an opportunity of uninter- 
ruptedly indulging himself in the exqui- 
site, though dangerous pleasure of gazing 
on her, threw a damp on his spirits which 
rendered him incapable of enjoyment at 
present. 

The feel inofs. however, which occasioned 
this dejection he by no means encouraged, 
since he well knew that not only his hap- 
piness, but his. prosperity, his advance- 
ment in life, depended on their subjuga- 
tion â€” well knew that unless they were con- 
quered, he should be unable to make the 
exertions on which alone he . founded his 
hopes of independence. 

On returning to the ruin he found Mac- 
talla nodding on his post, completely over- 
powered by the fatigue he had recently un- 
E<5 dergone,. 



S^ THE BISCARDED SON. 

dergone. He immediately relieved him, 
in order to let him have a little rest ere 
they set off; and while Felisco^ who ap- 
peared as lively and alert as usual, pro- 
ceeded by his desire to an adjacent fields 
where he had observed herds and herds- 
men, to purchase milk and fruit for the 
ladies, endeavoured to amuse himself by 
looking about him. The objects that now 
fell under his inspection w^ere such as 
furnished bim with " ample food for medi 
tation." 

Notwithstanding the decay and desola- 
tion of the chapel, it was still characterized 
by anair of grandeur solemnly impressive; 
but what touched Osmond with still greater 
emotion than its noble arcades, now begirt 
^with streaming grass, its clustered pillars, 
or airy galleries, lit by windows yet retain- 
ing, in fragments of stained glass, vestiges 
of their original magnificence, was the 
sculptured tombs he beheld am.idst the 
? isles, green with damp aiid w^eeds; the 

inscrip- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 83 

inscriptions on many entirely defaced^ and 
on none more than sufficiently legible to 
prove how deceitful was the hope of those 
who trusted the perpetuation of their 
names to such records. 

Osmond's lively imagination readily ena- 
bled him to picture the sublime â€” the af-

"Yet ah,'* thought Osmond, as he re- 
flected on the victims that had here per^ 
haps been immolated at the shrine of su- 
perstition, '^ how many sighs may have 
mingled with that harmony ! how many 
eyes been blinded to the splendour of the 
scene by^tears of regret.!'

'' How melancholy are the effects of su- 
perstition and bigotry/' he continued, in- 
voluntarily pursuing the reflection; '''how 
dreadfully do they pervert the judgment, 
ns well as steel the heart ; for who that 
had not a perverted judgment, could for 
an instant suppose that a Being, whom 
we all know, from daily experience, to be 
one of mercy and benevolence, could 
take pleasure in acts or sacrifices that 
doomed any of his creatures to misery, could 
be gratified by any vows but those which 
the heart dictates. Oh, ye sons of the dust, 
how many are the calamities ye have 
brought upon yourselves by your mistaken 
notions â€” your wiirul induloence of error !'â€¢" 

On the return of Felisco he enquired of 
him concerning this ruin, and learned that 
its dilapidation and desertion were occa- 
sioned by z iXVâ‚¬7i^u\ earthquake many years 
back.

dreanij which made him suddenly start from 
a slumber he had fallen into in a remote 
corner of the chapel. 

Mr. Raymond^ in great consternation*, 
immediately made his appearance, followed 
by the ladies. Osmond quickly dispelled 
their apprehensions^ by explaining the 
cause of the outcry they had heard^ while 
poor Mactalla begged their pardon^ and 
expressed as much contrition for having 
disturbed them^ as if he had purposely 
done so. 

The party now partook of the refresh- 
ment provided by Osmond â€” Mrs. Ray- 
mond with grateful acknowledgments for 
his politeness and attention. 

Mr. Raymond, however, as usual pro- 
fited by the kindness he experienced with- 
out appearing to notice it ; and still, to 
the encreasing astonishment of Osmond, 
kept his face so enveloped, that not a fea- 
ture was visible. 

Their repast over, the party lost no

time in proceeding on their journey. â€” 
For some time the ladies, could not suf- 
iicientiy divest themselves of apprehen- 
sion, to feel at ease; at length their 
getting into a road bordered with fields 
rich in the treasures of Autumn, and scat- 
tered over with peasants^ whose assistance, 
if requisite, Felisco assured them they 
need not doubt obtaining, dissipated 
their fears, and restoring them to tran- 
quillity, permitted them to converse as 
usual. 

After chatting some time about the ter- 
rific incidents of the preceding nighty, she 
spoke of the manuscript with which he had 
amused them, saying it had furnislied her 
with such an 'episode as she wanted for her 
Tale of Wonder. 

" Well," said Miss Raymond, with her 
accustomed innocence and sweetness, " I 
confess, notwithstanding the extravagance 
of the story, I could not help being a little 
interested about Carlo." 

The

'''The temptation that assailed him was 
certainly so great/' observed Osmond, 
^' that one can hardly forbear mingling pity 
with their condemnation of him/' 

" But most assuredly/' remarked ]\frs. 
Raymond, '' he would have been more de- 
serving of that pity, had he made an efibrt 
to resist the temptation he met with. He 
who voluntarily risks his honour merits but 
little compassion for the misery incurred by 
indiscretion." 

''That of Isabella is certainly entitled 
but to little, if any," rejoined her lovely 
daughter. " United as she v/as to the ob- 
ject of her choice, and convinced, by ex- 
perience, of his meriting her affection, 
there was nothing to excuse, or in any 
manner palliate, her conduct. Let me not," 
added she, with quickness, and deeply 
blushing, evidently in consequence of 
catching Osmond intently regarding her 
at the moment, '' be supposed to mean 
that I think it would have admitted of ex- 
tenuation, had her situation been other than

it was. Premeditated error, I am well 
aware, admits not of apology/' 

'' Oh how unnecessary/' burst from the 
lips of the enamoured Osmond, " this ex- 
planation of your sentiments, to one so 
thoroughly sensible of â€” so deeply im- 
pressed with a conviction of " 

He suddenly recollected himself, and 
paused â€” paused in the most painful con- 
fusion, and with a cheek more deeply 
crimsoned at the moment, than was^that of 
the lovely object of his admiration. 

'' For â€” for," added he, making an ef- 
fort to finish the sentence in such a way as. 
should do away the idea of the compli^ 
ment it conveyed being dictated by aught 
but common politeness, '' it is utterly im- 
possible that any person who has had the 
honour of being in Miss Raymond's com- 
pany, could for an instant harbour a c^oubt 
of her not thinking correctly on every 
subject." 

'â€¢' She would not do so," said Mrs. Ray- 
mond, but evidently more for the purpose

Dp diverting the attention of Osmond from 
her daughter, who appeared at the mo- 
ment not less agitated and confused than 
he was, than from any wish to pursue the 
subject, as her immediately after dropping 
it proved, '' if she did not condemn the fair 
culprit of whom we have been speaking." 

Little further conversation, and that but 
of a desultory nature, ensued after this, 
till their arrival at Venosa, which took place 
ere the day was far advanced. 

What the feelings of the party were, on 
at length finding themselves safely housed 
in a comfortable inn, may easier be ima- 
gined than described. 

But though from the selfish concern he 
had throughout the journey manifested for 
himself, it was but natural to suppose those 
of Mr. Raymond not less lively on this 
occasion than his companions, he gave 
no utterance to them as they did, but in 
gloomy silence shrunk from the voice of 
congratulation, and quickly disappeared, 

leaving

leaving his wife and daughter alone with 
Osmond. 

Mrs. Raymond's sensations at finding 
herself, and those for whom she was more 
interested than for herself, again in a 
place of safety, for. a few minutes over- 
came her. When a little recovered, and 
with pious gratitude she had returned 
thanks to heaven for their deliverance 
from the dangers which had lately encom- 
passed them, she repeated her acknow- 
ledgments to Osmond for his services on 
the late occasion. 

" Be assured," said she, " while I retain 
the life you have been instrumentalin pre- 
serving, I shall cherish the most grateful 
recollection of your conduct." 

" Oh, Madam, how richly do you re- 
ward me for it," in the most im})assion- 
ed tone, and raising, and respectfully 
pressing to his lips the hand she extended 
to him as she spoke ; '' by the hope you 
have given me of retaining a place in your

remembrance, nothing more was wanting 
to complete the obligations your condes- 
cending kindness has laid me under/' 

'' You acknowledge fancied obligations 
in so handsome a manner/" replied Mrs. 
Raymond, smiling, " that I should like to 
have an opportunity of laying you under 
real ones." 

Then the present moment, by giving 
her liberty to say she objected not to his 
cultivating her further acquaintance, fur- 
nished her with one for the purpose, Os- 
mond was on the point of saying, but sud- 
denly checked himself, under the idea of 
her, perhaps, deeming him presumptuous 
â€” worse, designing and interested, if such a 
speech escaped him. 

Both ladies were so extremely fatigued, 
that as soon as they had partaken of a re- 
freshment with Osmond, they retired to re- 
pose, not, however, without Mrs. Ray- 
mond desiring him to hold himself in rea- 
diness to join them at supper. 

He 



di THE DISCATIDFD SON. 

He immediately followed their example, 
nor awoke till the evening was somewhat 
advanced^ when finding they were not yef 
risen, he procured an attendant to shew 
him the town. 

He continued his ramble till the hour at 
which he understood supper was ordered. 
On re-entering the inn, he ascended to the 
apartment which the ladies occupied ; 
but was prevented opening the door by 
the intervention of a waiter, who had run 
up after him. 

''Your supper, Signor," said he, but 
with a respectful bow, '' is prepared in 
another room.*' 

" What, have the ladies then changed 
their apartment ?" asked Osmond. 

'' O no, Signor, they are at supper in 
that, but the gentleman with them gave 
orders that your's should be prepared for 
you in another room.'* 

*' O, very well,'* replied Osmond, with 
forced calmness, but a countenance suf- 
fused 



THE DISCARDED SON. 03 

fused with the crimson glow of indignation, 
'' shew me to it/' 

The man obeyed. 

Osmond seated himself at table, where 
supper was already laid, but which pride 
in vain stimulated him to make an efibrt 
to touch. In vain too did it stimulate 
him io try and retain that appearance 
of composure it had in the first instance 
induced him to counterfeit. The feelings 
by which his mind was at present agitated 
were too violent, too agonizing, to allow 
of their either being long dissembled or 
controlled; and finding the impossibility 
of their being so, he suddenly started 
from the table, and desired to be shewn 
to his chamber, and, in order to avoid 
having any witness of his present emo- 
tion, his servant to be informed he should 
not require his attendance until morn- 
ing. 

As soon as he had, in the solitude of his 
chamber^ subdued, by the exertion of his 

reason^ 



di THE DISCARDED SON. 

reason, the irritation of his mind, suffi- 
ciently to permit him to reflect again %vith 
some degree of coolness, the fatal conse- 
quences that might ensue from resenting 
the contumelious, the injurious treatm.ent 
he had just experienced, in the manner his 
proudly indignant spirit prompted, became 
too obvious not to induce him to de- 
termine on evincing his deep sense of its 
ingratitude and baseness, in no other way 
than by immediately detaching himself 
from the society of Mr. Raymond. 

^^ Was I to associate with him after what 
has passed, I should indeed," he exclaimed, 
'^ prove to him that I merited it â€” should 
provoke what nothing could enable rne to 
support â€” my own contempt. 

" In what,'* he continued, as with disor- 
dered steps he paced his chamber, ''"'can 
that which has marked his conduct towards 
me originate? for the deliberate insult he' 
has offered me, there must be some cause. 
Surely he cannot entertain a suspicion of 

my 



THE DISCARDED SON. 9.5 

my being other than I have represented 
myself. 

''Ah!" cried he, after a thoughtful 
pause of some minutes, as the idea sud- 
denly started in his mind, ''I now see to 
what his conduct towards me was owino-. 
â€” Yes â€” yes; various circumstances now 
recur to my recollection, to convince me 
that 'tis on his daughter's account, to pre- 
vent any risk of his expectations con- 
cerning her being disappointed, that he 
has treated me in such a manner, doubt- 
less concluding I should have no hesita- 
tion in attempting to take advantage of any 
favourable sentiment in her bosom for 
me. Ah, in thinking so, how much does 
heT^ongme! â€” how little does he know 
me, when he imagines I would be capable 
of purchasing my own gratification at the 
expence of her welfare ! 

'^ The supposition, however, I acknow- 
ledge not an unnatural one â€” one too, which, 
if much oftener in her society, future cir- 
cumstances 



96 THE DISCARDED SOK. 

cumstances might perhaps justify; did I 
think otherwise^ I should arrogate too much 
to myself â€” a strength of mind, a forbear- 
ance^a command over myself, I feel I do not 
possess : yeSj I feel convinced, if much 
longer exposed to the power of her charms^ 
the passion with which my bosom palpi- 
tates for her could not be concealed â€” feel 
that the secret of my heart would be be- 
trayed, and that I should but too probably 
seek to inspire her with corresponding 
sentiments. 

" Let the consideration, therefore, of 
this, of the misery, the remorse I should feel 
for acting in such a mianner, conscious as 
lam, from the disposition of her father, of 
the unhappiness an attachment to me must 
be productive of to her, reconcile me to 
the thoughts of seeing her no more â€” of to- 
morrow's sun lighting me in all probability 
for ever from her/' 

Both pride and prudence determined 
him on quitting Venosa at an early hour 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 97 

the ensuing day, fast otherwise he might 
be suspected of wishing to intrude him- 
self on the further notice of Mr. Ray- 
mond and his family, and thus incur the 
imputation of a meanness he would have 
abhorred himself for ; or by chancing to 
see the fair Cordelia, betrav perhaps his 
feelings at the thoughts of their approach- 
ing separation. 

That none of the party would be at a loss 
to conjecture the reason of his departing 
so abruptly, he flattered himself. â€” At 
least, the mother and daughter would do 
justice, he hoped, to his motives for doing 
so, since, if they did, he trusted they 
â€¢would grant him a portion of their es- 
teem. 

But in vain he strove to subdue the an- 
guish which the idea of no more seeing the 
latter inspired. Time alone, he at length 
felt convinced, could enable him to do 
this. 

Exhausted by the violence of his emo- 
tions, yet still from the perturbation of his 

VOL. IV. F mind 



Â§8 THE DISCARDED SON. 

mind unable to think of rest, he threw 
open a lattice, and in the contemplation 
of the majestic mountains he had to cross 
the ensuing day, sought to lose the reflec- 
tions that now harrassed him ; but the sub- 
lime prospect they afforded had not the de- 
sired effect, nor with the involuntary admi- 
ration it excited did pleasure mingle, as 
would have been the case had he still re- 
tained a hope of traversing them in com- 
pany with Miss Raymond, of being allowed 
to guide her wandering eyes to their va- 
ried beauties â€” explore with her their ro- 
mantic recesses. 

At last he threw himself on the bed, but 
sleep only weighed down his eyelids, to 
give him up to more tormenting fancies 
than those by which he had been harrassed 
while awake. Amongst other terrifying 
dreams, he suddenly imagined himself, he 
knew not by what means, neither why or 
wherefore, transported to one of the ex- 
tensive forests of Africa, swarming with 
beasts of prey, whose dreadful cries ap- 
palled 



THE DISCARDED SON. 99 

palled his senses ; and that while gaz- 
ing about him, to see whether there was 
a possibility of extricating himself from 
its horrid confines. Miss Raymond, pale 
and fainting with terror, appeared before 
him, whom he instantly flew to succour, 
and espying an opening amongst the 
trees, hurried her forward, but had not 
proceeded far, when a rustling in ""Jie 
underwood behind causing him to look 
back, he beheld a tremendous tiger creep- 
lug after them, evidently watching for 
an opportunity of seizing them unawares; 
upon which, snatching up his lovely com- 
panion, he forced his way through all 
the opposing difficulties, till he came to 
a small glade, so beautifully sequestered, 
and remote from the spot in vyhich he had 
been alarmed for her safetv, that he 
thought he might venture to pause with 
her; but had scarcely rested her on a 
bank, when the formidable enemy he had 
borne her from^ sprung from a neighbour- 
F 2 ing 



100 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ing thicket^ and with wide-extended jaws and 
out-stretched talons, seized upon her, and 
carried her off, regardless of his frantic ef- 
forts to save her â€” efforts rendered still more 
violent by the tender, the agonizing tone in 
which she called upon him to save her. 

From this dream he started, too much 
affected by it to be able to sleep again ; 
the look with which Miss Raymond had re- 
garded him, the plaintive accent in which 
she had addressed him in it, were impressed 
on his imagination. â€” '^ O, if in reality I 
caught such a look," he involuntarily ex- 
claimed, '' heard such an accent, where â€” 
where would my resolution be ! like the base- 
less fabric of a vision, I fear I should find it 
vanish, without leaving a wreck behind/' 

His present feelings still more forcibly 
convincing him of the necessity there was 
for adhering to his determination of avoid- 
ing her in future, he arose ere the sun 
had made its appearance, and immediately 
rang for Mactalla. 

Instead 



THE DISCARDED SON. 10 1 

Instead of Mactalla, however, a man be- 
longing to the house answered the bell. 

Osmond desired his servant to be direct- 
ly sent to him. 

'' He is gone out^, Signor/* said the 
waiter, bowing. 

" Gone out!" repeated Osmond, some- 
what surprised ; " whither pray^ and 
when ?'* 

'* I can't say where, but he left this 
two hours ago on horseback, and desired, 
should you require him before he returned, 
you might be informed he would not be 
long absent.'' 

*' Strange where he can be gone to,*' 
said Osmond. '' Have his companions ac- 
companied him ?'* 

The man replied in the negative, adding, 
neither of them were yet up, and desired 
to know whether it was his pleasure they 
should be called ? 

'' No," Osmond returned, for as he 

could not think of departing till the return 

f3 of 



102 THE DISCARDED Â«0N. 

of his servant;, there was no occasion for 
their beinij disturbed. 

He dismissed the man^ but had scarcely 
done so, when the idea striking him that 
he should appear extremely deficient in gra- 
titude and politeness^ if in some way or 
other he did not take leave of Mrs. Rav- 
mond, he resolved on writing to her, and 
accordingly hurried from his chamber the 
moment he was dressed, in order to pro- 
cure materials for the purpose. 

He was ushered into another apartment, 
containing what he required, but scarcely 
had he been left to himself, and taken up 
a pen, ere the half-closed door of the room 
was thrown open. He involuntarily look- 
ed up, and beheld Miss Raymond retreat- 
ing from it. 

He directly started up, unable to deny 
himself the pleasure of once more gazing 
on her; and flying after her, conjured her 
not to let him be pained by supposing his 
being in the apartment had deterred her 

from 



THE DISCARDED SON. 103 

from entering it : â€” adding, with a look, 
but an unconscious one^ of tender re- 
proach, he trusted she would not object to 
doinff so when he informed her he was on 
the point of quitting it. 

*^ Nay, I assure you/' said she, returning, 
but in much confusion, and evidently 
greatly agitated, '' it was the manner in 
which I sav/ you employed, and my not 
finding my mother here, as I expected:" â€” 
Osmond now, for the first time, perceived 
the apartment he was in w-as the one they 
had occupied the preceding darv â€” '' that 
ftlone caused me to retire; but pray let me 
not prevent your writing, or I shall again 
withdraw." 

'' A few minutes will suffice. Madam,'* 
replied Osmond, with a deep and involun- 
tary sigh, a look of melancholy that proved 
it to have emanated from his heart, " to 
finish my letter; 'tis meant to be a brief 
one; but if lon;^-er, would still, I fear, but 
poorly speak the feelings of its writer. â€”

mother will:, however, I trust, do these 
more justice than he is himself capable of 
doing them." 

" My mother V repeated Miss Raymond, 
with quickness, and turning her fine eyes 
full upon him ; '' has she anything to say 
to your letter ?" 

" Tis addressed to her. She would just- 
ly have branded me with the epithet of un- 
grateful, at least I should have considered 
myself so, had I departed without express- 
ingmyhighsense of the obligationsher con- 
descending goodness has laid me under." 

"Departed!" said Miss Raymond; "then 
I presume/' she added, with a varying 
cheek, which gave rise to suspicions and 
emotions in the mind of Osmond, that at 
once transported and tortured him ; since, 
with all his generosity, he could not avoid 
being delighted at the idea of her enter- 
taining a more than common esteem for 
him â€” with all his passion, avoid being 
pained at the thoughts of her being in- 
volved in an attachment, which, from its 

hope- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 105 

hopelessness, for hopeless, as has been al- 
ready mentioned^ he was convinced one be- 
tween them must prove, could not fail of 
being attended with misery to her, '' you 
have given up your intention of going to 
Naples, at least for the present?'* 

'â€¢' By no means, Madam ; 'tis my inten- 
tion to proceed thither immediately." 

'^Indeed!'* in an accent expressive of 
surprise; '' then why write to â€” â€”but I see 
â€” I see how it is," with quickness, and 
suddenly starting from a thoughtful atti- 
tude, " we have hitherto proved such trou- 
blesome companions, that," half bowing, 
and affecting to smile, '' you gladly seize 
the first opportunity that has occurred for 
detaf;hing yourself from us." 

'* Good heavens!" exclaimed Osmond, 
with vehemence, and eyes and hands invo- 
luntarily uplifted, ''what a supposition! 
â€” O, Madam! Idoâ€”l will believe," after 
a transient pause, occasioned by tlie vio- 
lence of his emotions, the anguish of his

wounded feelings^ '' that the gentleness of 
your nature would not have permitted you 
to have given utterance to such a one, had 
you surmised the pain it would have inflict- 
ed on me." 

'^^ You â€” you dome but justice in ima- 
gining so/' cried Miss Raymond, in a tre- 
mulous accent, and with a look which 
evinced his agitation being neither unob- 
served or unfelt by her ; and a counte- 
nance expressive of such sweet, such sor- 
rowful repentance, for the distress she had 
given, as would have disarmed rage itself. 
*' I trust I am not capable of voluntarily 
giving pain to any one, much less a person 
whose life was risked for the preservation 
of me and my family." 

*' O, touch not on that subject again,'* 
interrupted Osmond, passionately : " In 
risking my life for the preservation of 
yours, I only risked what, had you been 
lost, would have been insupportable to me, 
and therefore merit no acknowledgment:

only say the supposition you have just 
given utterance to is not one you really en- 
tertain, and 1 am satisfied." 

'' Then be satisfied, for I acknowledge 
that it is not â€” more/' she proceeded, 
deeply blushing., and with a warmth, an 
agitation, which proved her heart alone 
dictating to her at the moment â€” '' I ac- 
knowledge that it was ungenerous, un- 
grateful in me, to endeavour to make 
you believe I ascribed your determination 
of detaching yourself from our society to 
a motive, which I w^as conscious it did 
not proceed from â€” yes, 1 must have been 
stupid, indeed, if I had not at once sur- 
mised it ov/ing to â€” to."' â€” She paused, as 
if overpowered by confusion, and turn- 
ed, with quickness, from the gaze of Os- 
mond â€” " My moLher," she continued, 
after the silence of a minute, but still 
averting her looks from his, ^'^ can better 
explain, can better apologize than I can, 
for â€” for what," hesitating, " has, I am 

certain, been the cause of it 1 therefore

wish^ on that account, you would see 
her ere you depart.'* 

" Believe me. Madam/' returned Os- 
mond, in the most respectful yet impas- 
sioned tone, " in any other instance your 
wishes would be as laws to me, but to lin- 
ger here merely for the purpose of letting 
Mrs. Raymond be pained by apologizing 
for conduct" â€” (Osmond perfectly com- 
prehended Miss Raymond's alluding to her 
father, in what she had just said,) â€” 
*' which she could not prevent, is what I 
cannot possibly think of/* 

'' Well, Sir," said Miss Raymond, again 
speaking collectedly, and making a move- 
ment towards the door, '' I shall say no 
more on the subject, only this, that I know 
my mother's sentiments on it so well, I am 
convinced her regret for the past will be 
aggravated by not having had a personal 
opportunity of apologizing for it.'* 

'' Then she knows not what is passing 
here," CA/laimed Osmond, laying his hand 
involuntarily on his breast, and the secret 

of 



THE DISCARI>EI> SOX. $09 

of his heart, through the agitation of his 
feelings^ bursting from his lips ; '' or in- 
stead of regretting, she would rejoice at 
what has happened, since a means of re- 
storing me to prudence, to recollection, 
of banishing me a society I could no longer 
indulge myself in with impunity. Need I 
explain the purport of these words ? â€” O 
no, surely no ! â€” you cannot be so uncon- 
scious of your own perfections as to be at 
a loss to understand me/' 

^^ I see. Sir," said Miss Raymond, as if 
she had not heard this speech, ^' I have in- 
terrupted you; besides, I wish to enquire 
when we shall set off. I will now, there- 
fore, bid you adieu/' 

She uttered these words with so distant 
an air, and in accents so equally eold. and 
repelling, that Osmond concluded he had 
oflfended her. The surmise wounded him to 
the soul, and instantly led him to believe 
he had completely deceived himself, with 
regard to the idea which but a few minutes 
before her extreme agitation, her varying 

colour^ 



llf) THE DISCARDED SON. 

colour^ her half- averted eye, had induced 
him to yield to. 

Silently and dejectedly he hastened be- 
fore her to open the door^ but at the very 
moment he laid his hand upon the lock, 
he involuntarily turned towards her, un- 
able to endure the thoughts of letting her 
leave him in displeasure â€” leave him too 
perliaps under the idea of his being a selfish,- 
designing, presumptuous character. 

*' I perceive. Madam/' cried he, in the 
most deprecating accent, '' I have been so 
unfortunate as to offend you; could you 
look into my heart, you would be convinc- 
ed how unintentionally â€” then see, that with 
my admiration, my adoration of you, one 
presumptuous thought never mingled; that 
for an instant I forgot not how lost to feel- 
ing, to generosity, I should be, to wish to 
excite in your bosom a corresponding sen- 
timent ; that a hint of those I entertain for 
you never would have escaped my lips, but 
for the violent agitation of my feelings. Let

of this moment^ by saying you forgive 
me.

** All Nature fades extinct ; and she alone 
Heard, felt, and seen, possesses every thought. 
Fills every sense, and pants in every vein.

And sad amid the social band he sits, 
Lonely and inattentive. From his tongue 
Th' unfinish'd period falls ; while, borne away 
On swelling thought, his wafted spirit flies 
To the vain bosom of his distant fair.

Osmond, 



THE DISCARDED SON. - 115 

Osmond, scarcely conscipus of what he 
Was about, so greatly was he agitated by 
the sight of her agitation and emotion^- 
an agitation, an emotion that revived in 
full force the idea he had been on the 
point of abandoning as illusive, advanced 
a little way from the door â€” 

" I â€” I meant to have said, Mr. Munro,'* 
resumed Miss Raymond, quickly recovci*- 
ing herself a little, and trying to speak 
with something like gaiety â€” *^' that I am 
not quite so easily offended as you imagine, 
or rather that I must be conscious of there 
being an intention to offend ere I can 
feel so. As a proof that I acquit you of all 
such intention, in short, that you were in- 
tirely mistaken in imputing anger to me, 
permit me now to offer you my best wishes 

for " again her voice faltered a little, 

" your health and happiness.'' 

She attempted to pass him as she spoke, 
but the feelings of Osmond had too com- 
pletely got the ascendancy over him at the 

moment. 



114 THE DISCARDED SON. 

â– jiiornent, to permit him to allow of her re- 
/tiring without hearing him express the gra- 
titude with which this goodness, this gentle- 
ness inspired him. Accordingly he gently 
seized her hand, as she moved towards the 
door. He lifted it to his quivering lips, 
he laid it for an instant to his throbbing 
heart, he folded it, for the first, and the 
last time, he believed, between his; he 
rested his cheek, pale and chilled by de- 
spair, for a moment on it. 

At length â€” " Words are inadequate,*' he 
isaid, but in broken accents, '' to express 
what I feel for your condescending good- 
ness. My wishes, my prayers for your fe- 
licity, can best, can only demonstrate the 
gratitude it has inspired. â€” O may they 
prove more successful than those I have ut- 
tered for my own- now appear likely to do. 
May fortune, may fate, in every instance, 
prove as kind to you as nature has been : 
may your destiny,*' he continued, with 
encreasing energy, and dropping involun- 
tarily 



THE DISCARDED SON. US 

tarily on one knee, " be as gentle as your 
nature. Above all^ my this dear, this in- 
estimable hand/' again his lips touched it^ 
'^ never belong to any one who does not 
thoroughly merit the happiness it will con- 
fer upon him ; let me but be assured it is 
the rich treasure of such a beings and the 
pangs of hopeless love will be lessened." 

Miss Raymond started^ and made ano- 
ther but a faint effort, and of consequence 
an unsuccessful one, to disengage her hand. 
This effort was quickly followed by a tear, 
which dropping on the hand of Osmond^ 
caused him in his turn to start, and ea- 
gerly elevate his eyes to her face. 

She turned it with quickness from him, 
but notwithstanding which he perceived 
that it was pale and covered with tears. 

This was not a sight to calm his emotion; 
kissing away the tear which had just fallen 
on .his handy he pressed hei-s still more fer- 
vently to his heart, and again bowed his 
head on it. 

The door was suddenly thrown open as 

he 



116 THE DISCARDED SON. 

he did so. He started;, and looking ap, 
beheld Mrs. Raymond. 

The sensations of this moment nearly 
overcame him. He knew not how he re- 
covered his feet, he knew. not how Miss 
Raymond vanished from the room, he knew 
not how he regained his own ; he was con- 
scious of nothing for some minutes, but 
that he must appear in the eyes of Mrs. 
Raymond, surprised as he had been by her 
at the feet of her daughter, a mean, despi- 
cable, designing character; as such, no 
doubt, be represented by her to the lovely 
Cordelia, to the utter destruction, in 
all probability, of that esteem which, 
without incurring the imputation of selfish- 
ness, he thought he might wish her to che- 
rish for him. 

" But I merit â€” I merit," in bitterness 
of soul he cried, and passionately strik- 
ing his throbbing forehead, " the wretch- 
edness, the idea of their degrading opi- 
nion makes me suffer â€” merit it, for hav- 
ing acted so contrary to the dictates of 

reason. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 117 

reason, of prudence, of generosity, as I 
have done in the recent instance. In- 
stead of any longer censuring, how warmly 
will Mrs. Raymond now probably applaud 
the repelling conduct of her husband to- 
wards me, now that she has such reason to 
believe the suspicions that occasioned it 
well founded." 

An hour passed away in the bitterest self- 
reproaches. The noise of a carriage then 
drew him to a lattice, which commanded a 
view of the street, and he beheld the Ray- 
monds stepping into a chaise, which im- 
mediately after drove off well attended. 

^'^They are gone then,'' said he, '^''gone 
for ever from my view â€” gone, without 
leaving me the consolation of thinking I 
shall retain that place in their remembrance 
I wished for. 

" O, fool!" again striking his forehead, 
as the idea suddenly occurred, '^ not to 
endeavour to justify myself in the opinion 
of Mrs. Raymond, whilst I had an o|:|por- 
tunity." 

The 



1 3 8 THE DISCARDED SON. 

The injustice he had been guilty of to- 
wards himself, in not endeavouring to see 
her â€” worse, the impropriety^ the cruelty 
he had been guilty of, with regard to Miss 
Raymond, in not trying to exculpate her, 
in the eyes of her mother, of the impru- 
dence which the recent scene might natu- 
rally occasion her to be suspected of, now 
struck him too forcibly not to renew, or 
rather aggravate his anguish. At length, 
unable longer to submit quietly to his tor- 
turing reflections, he again rang, to en-' 
quire for Mactalla, and hearing he was not 
yet come back, wrote a few hasty lines to 
be given him in case he returned, which 
he was now almost beginning to think was 
not his intention, desiring him to lose no 
time in following him to Naples; and quit- 
ting his chamber, mounted the horse which 
he had ordered to be prepared for him, and 
accompanied by Felisco, whose surprise at 
the conduct of Mactalla seemed quite as 
great as his, set forward on his journey, 
attended also by the French boy. 

In 



THE DISCARDED SON. 1 19 

In another frame of mind, the sublime 
scenery which met his view as he as- 
cended the Appennines. would have excit- 
ed the liveliest transports in his soul ; but 
now he crazed on all without emotion â€” so 
true is it, that to be able to enjoy the 
beauties of Nature, the mind must be at 
ease. Like Hamlet, it wxnt so heavily 
with his disposition at the moment, that he 
might have said â€” 

Â«* This goodly frame the earth, seems to me a stcril promon- 
tory ; this most excellent canopy the air, this majestical roof 
fretted with golden fire, appears nothing to me but a foul and 
pestilent congregation of vapours." 

The tears of the lovely Cordelia, her 
agitation in the recent scene, dwelt on 
his imagination, and awakened ideas 
that at once tortured and delighted him. 
â€¢ â€” Yes, he could not forbear thinking, 
from the emotion she had evinced, that 
he had inspired her with a warmer senti- 
ment than esteem. As he thought so â€” 
thought on the probability there was of 

her 



120 THE DISCARDED SON. 

her being yet compelled to give her hand 
â€¢where she could not altogether bestow her 
heart â€” on the possibility there was of his 
meeting another woman inclined to grant 
him her's, without his wishing to accept it, 
the Poet's observation recurred to his re- 
collection, that â€” 

â€” " For aught that ever he could read. 

Could ever hear by tale or history, 

The course of true love never did run smooth ; 

But either it v/as different in blood. 

Or else naisgrafted in respect of years, 

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends : 

Or if there were a sympathy in choice, 

War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it. 

Making it momentary as a sound. 

Swift as a shadow, short as any dream ; 

Brief as the light'ning in thecolly'd night. 

That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth ; 

And ere a man hath power to say â€” Behold ! 

The jaws of darkness do devour it up, 

So quick bright things come to confusion." 

His meditations were suddenly inter- 
rupted by Felisco*s riding up to inform 

him 



THE DISCARDED SON. 121 

him Mactalla was approaching. He imme- 
diately stopped, and turning, beheld hun 
pushing forward with all his might. 

'^ Upon my word/' Osmond exclaimed, 
on his coming within hearing, '' this is ra- 
ther an unexpected sight, as I felt almost 
inclined to imagine, Mr. Mactalja, that 
you had taken yourself entirely off.'* 

" By the Powers and so I feared you 
would, Signor,** said Mactalla, stopping 
within a yard or two of him, '' and there- 
fore I risked my neck by the haste I made 
to overtake you, notwithstanding which I 
was almost beginning to think I should not 
have succeeded in doing so.'* 

'â€¢'And pray may I enquire,'* resumed his 
master, '^ what took you from Venosa ?" 

" You shall hear, vSignor ; and when you 
^o, I trust you'll excuse my having quitled 
it without your leave, and also allow that I 
have done the business on which I went 
cleanly and cleverly, and for once prove 
that eaten bread is not always forgotten." 

" "What business?" demanded his master. 
VOL. IV. G '^ Why 



122 THE DISCARDED SON. 

" Why surely^ Signor, it can*t have 
slipt your memory the promise I made 
.in the m^idst of our recent dangers, to 
make a handsome acknowledgment to St. 
Benedict, for his kindness and protection, 
if we got safely through them/* 

Osmond nodded. â€” " I remember/* said 
he. 

'' Well, then, Signor, convinced that I 
should never prosper if I did not keep that 
promise, and moreover fearing such a 
good opportunity as offered at Venosn for 
fulfilling it might not occur again, I rose 
betimes this morning, for the purpose of 
visiting his convent, and, as I have already 
said, had the satisfaction of getting the 
business that took me there settled in the 
manner I wished, â€” My offering to him 
was m.ost graciously accepted in his name 
by one of the holy fathers, and who in re- 
turn assured me I might pursue the remain- 
der of my journey to Naples without any 
apprehension, as 1 had, by my conduct 
on this occasion, fully secured to myself 

the 



THE DISCARDED SDK. ISS 

the protection of the Saint. One thing in- 
deed liked to have marred all ; I forgot 
at first to mention how niany beside my- 
self were indebted to him ; an additional of- 
fering, however, on their account, quick- 
ly set matters to right again, by appeasing 
the anoerthe holv father felt at mv neali- 
gence." 

Osmond conld not forbear smiling at the 
simplicity which this anecdote argued Afac- 
talla possessed of His smile, hov/ever, was 
unaccompanied by any indication of that 
contempt which such simplicity might have 
excited in a more fastidious and less bene- 
volent mind. He who performed v/aat he 
conceived to be a duty, was, in his opi- 
nion, an object of respect and admiration, 
however superfluous or ridiculous that 
duty might appear in the eyes of sound 
reason . 

'' Accept my thanks, my good A'iend," 

said he, with a gracious smile, '' for your 

kind remembrance of me on the late occa-' 

sion. Your tribute of gratitude to St. Be- 

G 2 iicdict.

nedict, on my account, has laid me under 
obligations, which I shall take the earliest 
opportunity of evincing my sense of/' 

" What basket is that you have got 
dangling on your arm ?" asked Felisco, 
pointing to one on the left arm of Mac- 
talla. 

'' Basket ! by the Powers but I'd like to 
have forgot; 'tis a basket of provisions, 
which a pious lady, who chanced to hear my 
account of our late adventures, gave me to 
drop with an old hermit, as I passed over 
these mountains ; and who, by what I 
gathered from the shepherds, of whom I 
enquired concerning him as I came along, 
has his hut perched some where in this 
quarter." 

*' He has,'* said Felisco; '' if you elevate 
your eyes, you may see it on that high 
mountain that rises above the wooded ones 
to the left." 

** By the Powers and so I do,** cried 
Mactalla, joyfully; "what an admirer of 
fine prospects the old gentleman must be, 

to 



THE DISCARDED SON. 125 

to build his nest so high. Come, Feh'sco, 
as you know all the ins and outs of these 
mountains, be so good as to guide me to 
it, for I faithfully promised the lady (who 
by the bye made me a handsome present 
for the trouble 1 undertook on her ac- 
count) to give the basket with my own 
hands into his ; besides, I would not for 
the world lose the opportunity of obtain- 
ing the benediction of so holy a man/' 

Felisco consented, and Osmond having 
a wish to see a place of the kind, and con- 
ceiving besides, as they had by this time 
come a good way, that the horses required 
a little rest, alighted to join the party. â€” 
Accordingly, the horses being secured, 
and the French boy left to watch them, 
they began to ascend to the hermitage. 

The way to it w^as by zig-zag paths, 
many of them cut into steps, and almost 
all either shaded with trees and bushes, 
forming in many places delightful bowers, 
or fenced in with shrubby cliffs, bespl'ead 
G 3 with 



126 THE DISCAIIDED SON* 

with beautiful lichens, wild thyme, and 
flowers â€” 



** Amongst which the bee stray'd diligent. 
And with the extracted balm of fragrant vroodbine, 
Fili'd his little thigh." 

Through a small wilderness, they arrived at 
the little lawn on which the hermitage 
was erected. Twas fronted by perpendi- 
cular rocks of immense height, some naked 
and discoloured by time, others embossed 
with luxuriant mosses, and tufted with wild 
plants and shrubs. The mountain in the 
rear was broken into a variety of fantastic 
forms, wild, savage, pathless, and from its 
pendant precipices, and terrific height, 
evidently inaccessible to all but the light 
foot of the fearless chamois. Forests of 
pine, larch, and chesnut, cloathed its 
steep sides, apparently coeval with itself 

The vivid flowers that enamelled the 
ver&nt surface of the lawn^ the richly 

glowing" 



THE DISCARDED SON. 127 

glowing and aromatic shrubs that skirted 
the rocks that enclosed it^ formed a smil- 
ing contrast to the rude and gloomy scene 
bevond. 

On one side the hermitage was a small 
garden, containing a few vegetables and 
fruit trees ; on the other, bubbling up 
amongst some white stones, a natural foun- 
tain, supplied by the clear springs of i\\Q 
heights above. 

The hermit w^as then out ; and Mactal- 
la depositing the basket in the hut, re- 
paired with Felisco to look for him in the 
woods. 

Osmond preferred remaining behind, \o 
contemplate without interruption the sur- 
rounding scenery, or more probably in- 
dulge the reflections it was calculated to 

o 

inspire. 

From a pensive reverie he was suddenly 
roused by a rustling noise in the inner 
chamber of the hermitage, at the outer 
door of which he w^as leaning at ^he mo- 
ment^ waiting for the return of its owner, 
G 4 to 



128 THE DISCARDED SON. 

to examine it minutely. He turned hi^s 
eyes towards this^ and to his utter surprise 
beheld Mrs. Raymond advancing from it. 

^' Gracious heaven !" involuntarily^ and 
in extreme agitation, he exclaimed, *'is 
it possible â€” do I really behold Mrs. Ray- 
mond!" 

'^ Why, is there any thing so very asto- 
nishing in finding a woman gratifying her 
curiosity?" returned Mrs. Raymond. *' We 
stopt about an hour ago at a little auberge 
in the neighbourhood, for the purpose of 
baiting the horses, and having previously 
heard a great deal of this hermitage, I re- 
solved to avail myself of the opportunity 
that had thus occurred for visiting it. â€” A 
little fatigued by the time I had reached it, 
I sat down to rest myself, while my guides 
went in search of a shepherd's hut, to try 
and procure me some refreshment." 

'' O, now â€” now," thought Osmond, 
"^ have I again an opportunity of endea- 
vouring to exculpate myself in her opi- 
nion â€” more, endeavouring to exculpate 

her 



THE DISCARDED SON. 129 

her lovely daughter, i^ indeed, so wrong- 
ed as to be suspected of imprudence by 
her/' 

Still, notwithstanding the idea that ano- 
ther of the kind might not again occur, he 
could not for some minutes summon suffi- 
cient courage to enter upon the explana- 
tion he wished to make. At length, but 
in the most timid accent, he ventur- 
ed to entreat her attention for a few mo- 
ments â€” but was for an instant after una- 
ble to articulate another word, owinof to 
the confusion into which her, he con- 
ceived, severe look, but which in reali- 
ty was only a scrutinizing one, threw 
him. 

" It is essential to my future tranquillity. 
Madam," on a little recovering from this, 
he said, ^' that you should comply with my 
request.'* 

'' Well, Sir/' on his again pausing, said 
Mrs. Raymond, seating herself, as she 
spoke, on a sod seat outside the hut, ^' what 
have yoiL to say to me?" 

c 5 '' Ob, 



130 THE DISCARDED SON. 

^'^ Oh, Madam, more than I fear my feel- 
ings will allow me to give utterance to â€” 
yes, notwithstanding my anxiety to retain 
a place in your remembrance â€” that place 
whichyouso lately honoured mew^ith ahope 
of possessing â€” I knew not that I should be 
able to make an effort for the purpose, at 
least at the present moment, so depressed, 
so humbled, so completely overthrown, 1 
may say, is my mind by recent occurrences; 

but on account of of Miss Raymond," he 

added, Ddteringly, and in a still lower voice, 
"â–  'tio due to her, to you â€” I feel it to be due 
to both, to declare, in order to prevent 
that sweet, that delightful harmony and 
confidence subsisting between you being 
interrupted, that solely to my temerity, 
my indiscretion, my imprudence, the scene 
you witnessed at Venosa was owing. I op- 
posed, I impeded, I prevented Miss Ray- 
mond's withdrawing, yet not from any pre- 
sumptuous hope or thought â€” no, I pro- 
test, by all my hopes of happiness here- 
after, I call upon heaven to attest the 

truth 



THE DISCARDED SON, ISl 

truth of the declaration, but solely to de- 
spair â€” to the agonizing persuasion of no 
more having an opportunity of gazing on 
heo whom of all beings my eyes most de- 
lighted to dwell on. â€” Yes, Madam," he 
continued, but with eyes inclining towards 
the ground, and a rising blush upon his 
cheek, bright as the maiden blush of youth- 
ful beauty, '^ I can no longer conceal that 
I adore your lovely daughter. The frank- 
ness with which I avow my passion, will, I 
hope, be a means of inducing you to fore- 
go any injurious opinion you may have 
conceived of me, in consequence of the 
scene I have just alluded to ; since surely it 
must strike you, that if art fid, if designing, 
I would not reveal a ti'uth, calculated, I 
must be conscious, by putting you on your 
guard against me, to deprive me of all op- 
portunities of accomplishing my wishes." 

Ke then, but still in the most deprecat- 
ing tone, conjured her to lighten the an- 
guish of his present feelings, by permitting, 
him to hope he had not irreparably injured:

himself in her esteem^ or- laid the founda- 
tion of any unhappiness between her and 
her daughter. 

To this entreaty Mrs. Raymond made no 
reply. Osmond^ after awaiting one in si- 
lence some minutes^ ventured to steal ano- 
ther look at her, and saw, or fancied he 
saw, a gloomy thoughtfulness on her brow% 
which confirmed all the fears her silence 
had inspired. 

" Ah, Madam," he said, under the pain- 
ful impression of these fears, '' I see I am 
doomed to become the victim of appear- 
ances ; since you judge me by these, I 
cannot wonder at your withholding from 
rr^e the assurance Ihave entreated. Time, 
however, may yet convince you I was not 
altogether as undeserving of it as I am sen- 
sible you now imagine. Yes, my hence- 
forth shunning the sight of your lovely

in a broken voice^ he added^ this involun-

that home so dear to his regard, so interest- 
ing ^o his feelings^ so truly venerated, 
round which the warmest affections of his 
heart still hovered, having revived a thou- 
sand tender recollections, which complete-

as he spoke.

she aclded^ a smile brightening her fine fea- 
tures. 

*^*' Good heaven^ is it possible! â€” can it

claimed Osmond, " that the mother, like 
the daughter^ is an angel of forgive- 
ness !" . 

Mrs. Raymond pointed to a wild seques- 
tered path at the back of the hermitage. â€” 
Re directly ]Qd. her to it^ the men he had 
just seen being now at hand. On advancr 
ing some way in it, she paused, and â€”

emphatic accent, and raising her hand, im^ 
pressively, '' you do not yet know, nor 
can possibly conjecture ; ,but the period is 
at hand in which you'll be enlightened on

seeing the lips of Osmond sever ; "' your

saying, take this/' drawing a ring from her 
finger, and offering it to him. 

" Remind me. Madam ! " repeated Os- 
mond, with emphasis. ''Good heaven!'* 
colouring violently, and drawing back, 
'^ surely you cannot think it possible I re- 
quire any thing for that purpose." 

" Well, since you will not accept it on 
that account, accept it for another," said 
Mrs. Raymond, smiling ; ''accept it for the 
purpose of reminding you of my friend- 
ship, of my having more than a common 
esteem for you.'* 

^' Ohj Madam!" in accents which spoke 

the

the fulness of his heart, '' your conduct on 
the present occasion renders any further 
proof of that unnecessary/* 

'' Well, I will urge the matter no fur- 
ther/' said Mrs. Raymond, with seeming 
carelessness; 'Mndeed I know not that I 
am perfectly justified in parting with this, 
since it was a present from Cordelia/' 

'' Cordelia !'' echoed Osmond, with emo- 
tion so violent as to shake iiis frame, and 
involuntarily catching the hand which held 
the proffered gift. 

''Yes, a present from my daughter." 

''Ah, Madam!" cried Osmond, and 
gently disengaging the now inestimable 
ring from her hand, he pressed it to his 
lips ; " but what am I to think â€” what am 
I to infer from this ?" he suddenly ex- 
claimed, as if starting from a dream, and 
again looking not only with earnest- 
ness, but a degree of wildness at Mrs. Ray- 
mond. 

" You are to infer/' replied she, again 
laying her hand on his arm, and looking 

with 



13S THE DISCARDED SON. 

with mingled complacency and tenderness 
in his face, '' that virtue, sooner or later, 
will, even in this life, meet a reward; 
that let cynics say what they will to the 
contrary, real happiness may be experienc- 
ed here by those who steadily pursue the 
road of rectitude; in short, that innocence 
and goodness, like patience and industry, 
are blessings that assuredly lay the founda- 
tion for others. But endeavour to com- 
pose yourself â€” my daughter accom.panied 
me to the hermitage, and not being so fa- 
tigued as I was by the ascent to it, went 
with its holy inmate to view a curious 
grotto, a little way ofF; I expect her back 
by this time, and know she will be uneasy 
should she^not find me where we parted. I 
must, therefore, leave you now, but if you 
choose, you may by and bye follow me/* 

Then kissing her hand to hhn, she hur- 
ried back to the hermitage. 

For some minutes after she left him Os- 
mond was inclined to believe himself under 
the influence of a dream, so strange, so in- 
credible 



THE DISCARDED SON. 139 

credible did what had recently occurred 
appear to him â€” so strange^ so incredible, 
that she should meditate, as her looks, her 
words, above all, the circumstance of the 
ring tended to persuade him she did, fa- 
vouring his passion for her daughter â€” a 
daughter for whom she had such just reason 
to expect a splendid alliance. 

The only way in which he could account 
for such an intention, was by concluding 
she possessed an independant fortune, and 
saw no other means of preventing the 
lovely girl becoming the victim of a stern 
and inexorable father's ambition, than by 
consigning her to his arm.s. â€” '' Yes â€” yes, 
it must be so," he mentaliv exclaimed, '' it 
must be to a conviction of this nature â€” a 
conviction but too' probably derived from 
painful self-experience of the inability of 
wealth and splendour alone to confer hap- 
piness on the feeling heart, that her inten- 
tion of rendering me the most blest â€” most 
enviable of men is owing. And will Corde- 
lia â€” thelovely, the divine Cordelia herself 

^wiil 



HO THE DISCARDED SON. 

' â€” will she^ whom nature and education 
have so eminently qualified to shine in 
the most distinguished circles â€” will she 
acquiesce in this intention? will she be re- 
conciled to her mother's moderate views re- 
specting her? â€” O yes^ my heart assures 
me she will ; the proofs of reciprocal ten- 
derness, which her agitation, her emotion 
in our recent interview betrayed â€” those 
delightful proofs which prudence no longer 
interdicts my dwelling on, convince me, 
beyond a doubt, she will. Besides, I am 
convinced Mrs. Raymond would not have 
the cruelty to inspire hopes, at least of 
such a nature as she has given birth to in 
my bosom, without beholding a certainty 
of their being realized, since she must be 
aware that there is a wide difference be- 
tween the feelings excited bv the vanishing: 
of the happiness we never expected to 
possess, and that we had every hope of call- 
ing ours.'* 

Having a little subdued his agitation, he 
retraced his way back to the hermitage, and 

found 



THE DISCARDED SON. 141 

found the amiable mother and lovely daugh- 
ter sitting beneath the shadow of a cliff, 
with the refreshments the attendants had 
succeeded in procuring, spread upon the 
turf before them, and at a little distance 
conversing with them the hermit, an old 
man of eighty ; but notwithstanding his 
advanced age, still retaining a tinge on 
his cheek, and an animation in his eyes, 
that proved his faculties were unimpaired, 
and that he possessed health and tranquillity. 
But interesting as such an object would 
have been at another period to Osmond, he 
had now for some minutes only eyes for 
Miss Raymond, owing to his anxiety to 
learn whether she had yet received any 
intimation of her mothers surmised inten- 
tions, and how she felt on the subject, both 
which he flattered himself he should be 
able to discover by her countenance ; nor 
was he mistaken â€” the mantling blush that 
suffused it at his approach, the blended 
confusion and pleasure with which she half 
met, half avoided, his ardent gaze, con- 
vinced 



t42 THE DISCARDED SON. 

vinced him, that she was not only acquaint- 
ed with, but rejoiced at them. 

At the motion of her mother he took a 
seat beside her, and by those delicate, those 
nameless attentions which the enamoured 
heart can alone dictate, gave her silently 
to understand what was then passing in 
his. 

At length Mrs. Raymond, wishing to give 
her daughter an opportunity of endeavour- 
in 2" to overcome the emotion she was evi- 
dently in, sought to divert his attention by 
directincr it to the hermit. 

The venerable man, after conversing 
som.e time with them, was called away for 
some minutes by the return of Mactalla, 
who, besides the present, w-as charged with 
a messaofe to him. 

'' This is solitude indeed," said Mrs. Ray- 
mond, on his withdrawing out of hearing ; 
" but a solitude not appalling to the 
senses. â€” True,'' continued she, with quick- 
ness, anticipating the observations she saw 
Osmond on the point of making, '"^ we now 

see 



THE DISCARDED SO>r. 145 

see it under the most favourable circum- 
stances^ illumed with sunshine^ and adorn- 
ed with the rich and variegated beauties of 
Autumn. But when the storms arise, and 
foul and fierce all winter drives along the 
troubled air, when the foliage of the fo- 
rest lies in rude heaps upon the earth, and 
the brows of the mountains, instead of 
being veiled, as now", in light clouds, are 
covered wdth snow, I can easilv picture to 
myself what a savage scene it must present 
to the view. How deplorable the situation 
x)f its inhabitant must then be!'' 

'' But though this were not the case, it 
chills one to think of a human creature 
being so secluded from his species. I can 
scarcelv think that anv thins; short of the 
total overthrow of his jiopes and happiness 
can induce any one voluntarily to abjure 
society." 

^^ A social and benevolent spirit naturally 
thinks so,*' said Osmond ; ^'but, alas ! there 
are too many proofs of the reverse to admit 
a doubt on the subject being the case. Su- 
perstition 



144' THE DISCARDED SON. 

perslition and false notions of religion have 
often the same effect upon the mind, that a 
long series ofsufferingsometimes has, name- 
ly, that of creating gloom and misanthropy, 
and destroying all those social principles 
implanted in our nature, for the promo- 
tion of our own happiness and that of our 
species, and those corresponding sym- 
pathies, from the exercise and expe- 
rience of which man derives his highest 
felicity. 

" But doubtless sorrow sometimes gives 
a tenant to the hermitage â€” a devotee 
to the monastic cell ?'* rejoined Mrs. Ray- 
mond. 

"Assuredly,'* returned Osmond. ''lam 
well aware there are sorrows which must 
render a continuance in busy life insup- 
portable to the feeling heart. When the 
gates of death are closed upon his pro- 
spects, then, then, indeed, I do not won- 
der at a man's shrinking into solitude." 

*' But though we may not be able to per- 
suade ourselves that the hermit's life is a 

pleasant 



THE DISCARDED SON. 145 

pleasant one/' said Mrs. Raymond, pursuing 
the conversation the surrounding scenery* 
gave rise to, '' one cannot avoid thinking 
the shepherd's life must be a delightful one 
in these charming regions. A hundred 
times as I journied along, and caught a 
glimpse of the delicious solitudes they in- 
habit, the luxuriant plains on which they 
feed their flocks, the peace and tranquillity 
that appear to preside over their pine-sha- 
dowed and romantically situated dwellings; 
and contrasted these with the anxieties and 
dissentions that prevail but too much in the 
crowded haunts of men, I could not for- 
bear thinking, that here, at least, as Shakes- 
peare says, it were â€” 

<* A happy life, 
To be no better than a homely ssvain. 
To sit upon a hill as we do now. 
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point. 
Thereby to see the minutes how they run : 
How many makes the hour full complcat, 
How many hours bring about the day, 
How many days will finish up the year, 

VOL. IV. H How 



146 THE DISCARDED SON. 

How many years a mortal man may live. 
When this is known to divide the time- 
So many hours must I tend my flock. 
So many hours must 1 take my rest, 
So many hours must I contemplate. 
So many hours must I sport myseH ; 
So many days my ewes have been with young, 
So many weeks ere the poor fools will yean. 
So many months ere I shall sheer the fleece â€” 
So minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. 
Past over to the end they were created. 
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave." 

'" That the character into whose mouth 
Shakespeare put that beautiful speech 
should think such a life a sweety a lovely 
one, is not surprising/* said Osmond. ^' It 
was natural for the unfortunate lienry, 
encompassed as he was by danger, and har- 
rassed and perplexed in every direction, to 
think â€” 

" The hawthorn bush gave a sweeter shade 
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep, 
Than doth a rich cmbroider'd canopy. 
To kings that fear their subjects treachery"â€” 

That 



THE DISCARDED SON. lit 

That 

** The shepherd's homely curds. 
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle^ 
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade. 
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys. 
Is far beyond a Prince's delicates. 
His viar.ds sparkling in a golden cup. 
His body couched in a curious bed. 
When care, mistrust, and treasons wait on him." 

At length the hermit reappeared, and 
after a little further conversation with him, 
in the course of which Osmond, but in the 
most delicate manner, endeavoured to dis- 
cover whether it was misfortune had driven 
him to seek " this solitude forlorn/' and 
was informed, that his taking up his abode 
in it was solely the - result of inclination, 
the party took leave of him. 

How so old a man could possibly scram- 
ble up and down such mountains, to pro- 
cure for himself the necessaries of life, was 
a matter of astonishment to Osmond and 
his fair companions. In their way from 
H 2 his 



14B THE DISCARDED SON. 

his abode, however^, they learned from 
Felisco, that this was a fatigue he had long 
been exempt from, by the humanity, or 
rather piety of the people in the neigh- 
bourhood, who for their charitable con- 
tributions, conceived themselves wxU re- 
paid by his prayers, so great was his re- 
putation for sanctity. 

" Aye, so they say,*' rejoined Mactalla ; 
'^'"the lady who sent him the basket gave 
rne to iinderstand they mean to make a 
Saint of him as soon as he dies; and so they 
may if they please â€” but neither new nor 
old Saint will ever rival good St. Benedict 
in my regard." 

In their descent Mrs. Raym.ond entrust- 
ed toOsmond the care of her daughter, and 
thus afforded him an opportunity of giving 
utterance, in some degree, to the transports 
of his heart.'* 

" O, my Cordelia," he softly, and per- 
haps involuntarily whispered to her, as 
with cautious tenderness he guided her 
down the declivity^ " how richly does this 

moment^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 149 

moment, which gives to me the liberty of 
Styling you so, compensate me for all I 
have lately suffered ! O, thus, thus/' and 
for an instant he strained her to his throb- 
bing heart, "thus may we journey onward 
â€” thus may I be permitted to assist and 
support you through any difficulties that 
may occur ; say but that you participate in 
my present happiness/' eagerly endeavour- 
ing to catch a glance from her half-averted 
eyes, '^ and who in this world can be hap- 
pier than I shall/' 

'f I â€” I ever/' but not without a little he- 
sitation and a rising blush, replied his love- 
ly mistress, " participate in the happiness 
of my friends/' 

Osmond rapturously kissed her hand â€” 
*' Words are inadequate to express the 
feelings this goodness inspires," said he, 
'' but my actions will yet, I trust, de- 
monstrate the effect it has upon me/* 

The prospects that in various directions 

met the view of the party, caused them 

frequently to pause in their descent. â€” 

II 3 Here 



150 THE DISCARDED SOK. 

Here they beheld magnificent cascades^ 
foaming down stupendous precipices â€” 
therC;, rich vineyards and fertile plains^ 
diversified with chimps of trees, tinted 
with the golden hues of Autumn, and 
half shrouding the cottages of those whose 
flocks were scattered over them. The 
froth and green tincture of the falling 
Waters, the astonishing echoes of the rocks, 
amongst which they dashed, the striking 
contrast produced by the fertility of the 
plains, and the barrenness of the steeps 
that overhung them, the immense ridges of 
niountains that extended on every side, 
and the deep gloom of their vast forests, 
altogether produced a scene of the most 
romantic and impressive kind, such as com- 
pletely satisfied taste and fancy. 

The pleasing sensations which it inspired 
w^ere presently damped, however, by a mes- 
sage which awaited the ladies, at the spot 
where the French boy was stationed with 
the horses.

absence, Mr. Raymond dispatched a mes- 
senger, to inform them of the displea- 
sure it had excited and desired they 
might not lose a moment in rejoining 
him. 

The cheek of Osmond kindled at the 
terms in which his wish for their return 
was expressed. He restrained the indig- 
nation, however, it gave rise to in his 
mind, and respectfully kissing the hand 
of each, took leave of them for the present. 

He continued on the spot where they 
had parted till they quitted the auberge, 
then vaulted on his horse, and followed 
quickly after their carriage. 

How^ changed did now the face of na- 
ture appear to him ! From the revolu- 
tion his feelings had undergone, every thing 
again looked gay and smiling around him ; 
and restored, if not to calmness^ at least 
to happiness, he was now able to do ample 
justice to the picturesque scenery through 
which he travelled. 

H 4 The 



152 THE DISCARDED SON. 

The remainder of the journey passed 
without any occurrence worth mentioning. 
--â€”It was late when the party entered Na- 
ples^ and so dark, that Osmond had some 
difficulty in keeping up with the carriage 
of his fair friends. 

They alighted at one of the principal 
hotels, and as soon as they were accommo- 
dated, he desired to be shewn to an apart- 
ment. He was obeyed, and immediately 
after supper, retired to repose. 

Long as it was since he had had an op- 
portunity of enjoying any, still his antici- 
pations of the events of the ensuing day 
kept him awake, for a considerable time 
after he had laid his head on the pillow. 

At length Somnus laid his leaden sceptre 
on his eyelids, nor removed it until the 
inorning was far advanced. 

On rising he rang for Mactalla, and anxi- 
ous to know whether Mrs. Raymond had 
been enquiring for him, demanded, the 
instant he made his appearance, with a 

palpitating 



THE DISCARDED SON. 153 

palpitating hearty but seeming careless- 
ness, whether any one had been asking 
for him? 

" Oj no^ not a soul, Signor/' replied 
Mactalla ; '' indeed^, as his Grace the Duke 
D'Amalfi does not yet know of your ar- 
rival^ I don't know who should^ seeing that 
you are quite a stranger here." 

"True," replied Osmond; " butâ€” but/'- 
in some confusion, " w^hat I meant was, 
whether Mrs. Raymond had been making 
any enquiry for me this morning ?" 

'' She ! O no, not she ! â€” she didn't open 
her lips about you." 

'' You saw her then," said Osmond', with 
quickness;. '' at least I think I am to infer 
so from your answer." 

" O yes, I saw her at least an hour and- a 
half ago." 

" An hour and a hjtlf ago !" repeated Os- 
mond, in the most impatient accent, and 
totally forgetting himself, *' and not call 
me?" 

il5 "Call 



154 THE DISCARDED SOX. 

'' Call you ! â€” for what then ? â€” I am 
sure you wanted a good sleep, after all 
the fatigue you have lately undergone: 
besides, even if I had called you, I am 
sure you would not have had an opportu- 
nity of speaking to her, she was in such a 
hurry going, or rather Mr. Raymond was 
in such a hurry taking her away/' 

'^ Taking her away!" repeated Osmond, 
starting back, and surveying Mactalla with 
a wild stare â€” " and â€” and Miss Raymond,'* 
he faltered out with all the agitation of 
alarm, '' did he take her away also ?'' 

'' That he did," said Mactalla, ''bag and 
baggage â€” he took them all clean off." 

'' But â€” probably his address is known 
by the people of the house," cried Osmond, 
a little recovering himself from the idea 
of this being the case. 

'' No/' 

" Why, how do you know whether it is 
oris not?" in a passionate tone, he de- 
manded. 

" Because 



THE DISCARDED SON. 155 

^'Because I enquired/' answeredMactalla. 

^' And how â€” which way/' with encreas- 
ing vehemence, he asked, "did they go ?". 

'' They went in a coach/' returned Mac- 
talla, with the greatest coolness, " and 
turned to the left/' 

" You saw them going then ?'* 

"Yes." 

" And why not pursue them â€” how were 
you employed that you did not do so ?" 

"Why, Signor, I was in a little room 
that fronts the street, getting the Jewish 
ornament, which, against my inclination, 
I had so long worn upon my chin, taken 
off by a French barber I chanced to light 
upon ; but even though I hadn't been thus 
engaged, I don't know that I should have 
pursued them, seeing I didn't know of any 
reason I had to do so." 

" O;. you have undone me â€” you have 
undone me by not following them!" ex- 
claimed Osmond, passionately, and strik- 
ing his forehead. " My dream of happi- 
ness is over," he cried, pacing the room â€” 
116 



516 THE DISCARDED SON. 

" yes â€” yes/* to himself, '' this is the work 
of Mr. Raymond. He, doubtless^ by some 
means or other, suspected the intentions 
of his wife respecting me, and has carried 
her off in this manner, in order to prevent 
the fulfilment of them: but I will not 
quietly rest under such a disappointment ; 
I should merit the loss of the felicity thus 
-snatched from me, if I did not make an ef- 
fort to recover it. Pray,'* again address- 
ing Mactalla, " did you overhear no direc- 
tion given to the coachman?'* 

*' Why, I thought, Signor, that I heard 
that sinner, Mr. Raymond â€” for, by the 
lord, if his countenance, which, notwith- 
iJtanding all his care to conceal, I caught a 
glimpse of once or twice, don't belie him, 
he is one â€” say something about the Largo 
Castilio.** 

*' Run this instant, then,** said Osmoud, 
'^and procure me a guide thither." 

** Lord, Signor," cried Mactalla, whose 
astonishment at the wildness of his ges- 
tures was unspeakable, and which, as he 

at 



THE DISCARDED SON. 157 

nt present had no suspicion of the strong 
attachment between him and Miss Ray- 
mond, he was almost inclined to impute to 
a brain disordered by fatigue and long 
anxiety, '^ had you not better breakfast 
before you set out on your rambles? be- 
sides, there's his Grace the DukeD'AmaKi â€” 
to be sure he expects the first thing you'll 
do upon your arrival here is to pay him a 
visit." 

'' I am not in a state of mind to pay him 
one now," answered Osmond ; '' but to- 
morrow^ perhaps," he added, after a little 
hesitation, owing to the irreparable injury 
he suddenly reflected he might do himself 
with this nobleman, if he acted in any 
manner calculated to give him offence, as 
he could not but acknowledge his not has- 
tening to pay his respects to him was, and, 
besides, the ingratitude such conduct would 
manifest towards his amiable and valued 
friends at Acerenza, '^ I hope to be suffi- 
ciently recovered to do so. â€” In the course 

of 



15S' THE DISCARDED SON-. 

of the day, however, you shall go to his 
palace with a letter from me, to acquaint 
him of rny arrival, and enquire when it will 
be agreeable to have me p?y my respects 
to him, for men in his public situation are 
not always at leisure or disposed to receive 
visitors.'* 

''That I will, Signor,'* said Mactalla, 
joyfully, recovering from the consterna- 
tion which the idea of Osmond's not mean- 
ing to go near the Duke D'Amalfi, whom 
he looked upon as their sheet anchor at Na- 
ples, had thrown him into. 

" Very well â€” and now," in a hurried 
accent, " hasten to procure me the guide I 
^quire/* 

Mactalla finding it in vain to remon- 
strate against this measure, withdrew to 
obey him. 

" Yes," continued Osmond, on Alac- 
talla's retiring, '' 111 make every exertion 
to discover Mrs. Raymond ; and if fortu- 
nate enough to succeed, will take care not 
3 to 



THE DISCARDED SON. 159 

to lose sight of her again, except assured 
the intentions she flattered me with hopes 
of entertaining are altered. 

'^ Well, Signor," cried Mactalla, return- 
ing in a few minutes, accompanied by a 
well-dressed lad, ^' I have brought you 
such a person as you want : this young lad, 
Paulo Zerbi, says he knows every inch of 
Naples ; and to be sure 'tis not won- 
derful he should, seeing he was born 
and bred here, since I myself, who was 
never here before, know a good deal of 
it ; as for instance, I know that here are 
squares, streets, lanes, and alleys â€” then there 

are churches, convents, chapels, and " 

" Fools V* interrupted Osmond, pas- 
sionately, his impatience to commence hfs 
search being unspeakable: '' do you mean,*' 
he added, with a look, and in an accent 
very unusual with him, " to drive me en- 
tirely mad, by delaying me in this man- 
ner ? â€” eome along, boy,'* turning to the 
guide, '' lead the w^ay to the Largo Cas- 
tillo." 

The 



160 THE DISCARDED SON. 

The lad, without moving, looked at Mac^ 
talla, as if he required some further direc- 
tions from him. 

The fact was, Mactalla, in their way to 
the apartment, having dropped something- 
like a hint of the apprehended derange- 
ment of his master, owing to his solicitude 
to have him particularly attended to in his 
ramble, the lad conceived it requisite to 
know from him whether or not he should 
now obey the order he had received. 

Mactalla, alarmed by this conduct, lest 
it should create a suspicion in the mind of 
Osmond of what he had said,^ endeavoured, 
by significant looks, to make him under- 
stand he should go. 

Ere, however, he could make him com- 
prehend his meaning, Osmond, little brook- 
ing such delay, seized him suddenly by the 
shoulder, and shaking him rather roughly, 
enquired, in an angry tone, whether he 
was deaf? 

" No, Signor,'* replied the lad, in sub- 
missive accents, and bowing. 

" Then: 



THE DISCARDED SON. 161 

'' Then again I say, lead the way directly 
to the Largo Cas'tilio/' 

Still, however, Zerbi hesitated, and con- 
tinued looking at Mactalla, which Mactalla 
perceiving, and catching the penetrating 
eyes of Osmond on him at the moment â€” 

'' By the Powers then one would sup- 
pose you were !'' he cried; ''and what is 
tnore, not only deaf but incapable of mov- 
ing,'* givinghi^ at thesame moment a more 
expressive look than he had before done. 

The lad no longer at a lo3s to guess his 
meaning, again bowed to Osmond, and im- 
mediately led the way to the square he was 
so anxious to visit.

SMOND followed in silence, and so ab- 
sorbed in thought, that he neither heard 
nor saw any thing, and started, as if from 
a dream, on the lad's suddenly stopping 
and informing him he was then in the Largo 
Castilio, 

'' Indeed !" cried O.smond, looking 
aroundhim for a few minutes, withavacant 

eye ; 



THE DISCARDED SOxNT. 163 

eye; then recovering himself a little, '^ You 
know by whom these houses are occupied^ 
I presume, my friend?" 

'' Yes, Signor, except a few that are let 
to English families." 

" English families!" repeated Osmond^ 
^vith animation. ''Run, my good lad, and 
enquire at their respective mansions for a 
gentleman of the name of Raymond." 

'' Lord, Signor," cried Zerbi, hesitat- 
ing, and rubbing his head, ''won't my 
knocking at the different doors seem rather 
queer?" 

'' No matter," returned Osmond ; " I'll 
be at your elbow, to prevent any thing 
disagreeable resulting to you from your 
obeying my orders." 

" O, very well, Sign or ; if you'll take 
the blame of the thing upon yourself, lam 
satisfied to do as you wish." 

Accordingly he proceeded to make the 
enquiry he had been desired, but to no 
purpose. Mr. Raymond was not the inha- 
bitant 



164 THE DISCARDED SON. 

bitant of any one of the houses at which he 
knocked. 

As he approached the last oneâ€” 
'' Should disappointment await me here 
too/' cried Osmond mentally â€” his heart 
almost died within him at the idea. 

Again he was destined to experience it; 
but he v/as this time so lost in the surprise, 
the delight, the tumultuous emotions ex- 
cited by hearing Lord O'Sinister was the 
occupier of this mansion, that he scarcely 
felt it. 

To have met with even a common ac- 
quaintance in a place like the present, 
\vhere he neither knew% nor was known 
by any one, would have been a truly 
welcome circumstance ; no wonder then, 
that to meet thus unexpectedly a person 
vrhom he looked upon as a real friend, 
scarcely less interested in his welfare than 
his own family, should be a source of the 
liveliest pleasure to him. 

"Good heavens!" he exclaimed to 

himself.

himself, ^' how delightful, how fortunate 
his being here at such a period ! How wel- 
come will his society be to me, after being 
so long estranged from the society of all I 
could consider native friends ; and how 
serviceable may his notice prove io me ; 
the Duke D'Amalli will be convinced by it 
that his relations have not introduced an 
improper character to him ; and Mr. Ray- 
mond, should I be so fortunate as to dis- 
cover his residence, that I am not other 
than I have represented myself/* 

For some minutes he stood irresolute 
whether or not he should immediately pay 
his compliments to his Lordship. At length 
the agitation in which he found himself, 
and the idea that a letter might by this 
time perhaps be arrived for him at the hotel, 
from Mrs. Raymond, induced him to decide 
on deferring a visit to him to another op- 
portunity. 

The moment he re-entered the hotel, he 
eagerly enquired whether there was any 

message 



1G6 THE DISCARDED SON. 

message or letter for him, and to his ex- 
treme mortification 'svas answered in the 
negative. His chagrin, however, did not 
render him forgetful of the attention due 
to the Duke D'Amalfi. He wTote a respect- 
ful note to his Excellency, to acquaint him 
of his arrival in Naples, and request him to 
fix the time at which he would choose to see 
him. 

To this a most gracious answer was re- 
turned, in which the Duke, after expressing 
the pleasure it gave him to hear of his safe 
arrival, apologized for not bein â–  able to 
see him for a day or two, owing to a na- 
tional business of very great importance, in 
which he was, just at this juncture, engaged. 

Osmond, from the agitated state of his 
mind at present, and the wish he had to 
pursue, without interruption, his search 
after the Raymonds, was infinitely more 
pleased at this, than if he had been in- 
vited to an immediate confei^nce with his 
Excellency. 

JSome- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 167 

Sometimes he was inclined to hope his 
inquiries after this family would speedily 
prove successful ; then again, when he re- 
flected on the wary and suspicious man Mr. 
Raymond appeared to be, he almost de- 
spaired of success. 

Could he have flattered himself with a 
hope of their remaining any length of time 
in Naples, this w^as an apprehension he 
probably would not have yielded to ; but 
apprised, as from his conduct Mr. Ray- 
mond appeared to be, of the intentions of 
his lady respecting him, he could not per- 
suade himself that they would not speedily 
change their quarters. 

That Mrs. Raymond would ever vo- 
luntarily have left the hotel in such a 
manner, he had not the smallest idea. â€” 
His confidence in her sincerity w^as too 
great to permit him to harbour one of the 
kind â€” his opinion of her sensibility too 
exalted, to allow him to imagine she had 
trifled with his feelings, by inspiring hopes 
she knew to be fallacious, and must be con- 
vinced 



168 THE DISCARDED SON. 

"vinced could not be disappointed without 
inflicting the severest anguish. 

The pain which he felt assured she ex- 
perienced at being prevented coming to 
the explanation she had promised â€” the 
unhappiness he felt equally convinced her 
lovely daughter suffered from the circum- 
tance, aggravated his own. 

The transports into which he was thrown 
by his apprehensions of not discovering 
them, and of Mr. Raymond's forcing his 
daughter into a precipitateâ€” perhaps hate- 
ful unioU;, in order to keep her from his 
armSj were well calculated to encrease^ or 
rather confirm Mactalla's suspicion of all 
not being right in his head. 

This suspicion, in confidence, he im- 
parted to his bosom friend Felisco, who, 
on hearing the circumstances to which it 
was owing, allowed there was cause suf- 
ficient for it. He greatly consoled Mac- 
talla, however, by >issuring him he had 
no doubt whatever but that quiet and 
rest would speedily restore his master 

to 



THE mSGARDED SON. 169 

to his right senses^ and in the mean while 
â€¢dvised his keeping a watchful eye over 
him â€” advice which the strong affection 
Mactalia had conceived forOsmond, whose 
unassuming manners and gentle temper- 
were indeed particularly calculated to con- 
ciliate regard, rendered superfluous : but 
even though his attachment to him had 
been less fervent than it was^ still would 
the consideration of his being the highly 
valued friend of the Acerenza family^ to 
whom he (Mactalia) conceived himself 
under ur.returnable obligations, for their 
kindness to himself and father, have in- 
duced him to pay him every attention. 

His dread of his master's supposed 
malady being discovered by the people 
of the house, should he be much sub- 
jected to their observation, and of thus 
perhaps reaching the ears of the Duke 
D'Amaifi, to the great injury of his ex- 
pectations in that quarter, induced hiin 
to take upon himself the office of waiter,

to which circumstance, in all probability, 
was owing Osmond's not rising from ta- 
ble this day^ as he had done from that at 
Venosa, namely, without touching the re- 
past set before him, so lost was he in 
thought, so absorbed in painful reflections 
â€”reflections which had entirely dissipated 
the gleam of joy shed over his feelings by 
his unexpected discovery respecting Lord 
O'Sinister. 

A faint hope of meeting Mr. Ravmond, 
and thus perhaps being enabled to trace his 
residence, occasioned Osmond to visit a 
few of the coffee-houses in the evening; and 
probably he would have visited more, but 
for his suddenly recollecting he should de- 
rive no benefit from meeting Mr. Ray- 
inond, except he heard his name mention- 
ed, his features being still utterly unknown 
to him. 

The ensuing morning, agreeable to the 
resolve of the preceding day, he repaired 
to pay his respects to his noble and highly- 
esteemed 



THE DISCARDED SONT. 171 

esteemed friend. Lord O'SInister, but was 
disappointed of the pleasure of seeing 
him, by his Lordship having just gone out 
to ride, nor could the servant say when he 
would be back ; his return, therefore, 
being uncertain, Osmond, instead of wait- 
ing, begged to leave a note. Accord- 
ingly he was shewn into a library, where he 
wrote a few lines, merely stating the acci- 
dental manner in which he had discovered 
his Lordship's being in Naples, and the 
anxiety he felt to pay his compliments to 
him in person. 

On his return to the hotel, the restless- 
ness which anxiety and incertitude made 
him experience, united to his determina- 
tion of not losing any time in the prosecu- 
tion of his search after the Raymonds, 
which, if still in Naples, he thought he 
should be most likely to succeed in, by 
visiting the different public edifices, caused 
him to send for the guide of the preceding 
day. 

On his entering his apartment, Osmond 
I 2 demanded 



172 THE DISCARDED SON. 

demanded whether he could devote the 
whole of the day to him, as he wished 
in the course of it to go over Naples, 
and take a view of all its public build- 
ings. 

The lad, without replying, first viewed 
Osmond with a stare of astonishment, and 
then turning to Mactalla, regarded him 
with a similar one. 

'^ Why what the devil is the matter with 
you?*' asked Mactalla, again fearing if he 
did not interpose the hint he had given 
him respecting his master might be be- 
trayed. *"*' If the Signor had desired you 
to shew him to the infernal regions^ you 
could not look more surprised.'' 

'' And no wonder, I am sure you'll 
allow," said Zerbi. " Yes, I am certain 
you must confess it was enough to make 
me stare, to hear the Signor say, he in- 
tended going over i]\e city^ and view- 
ing all its public buildings in the course 
of one day, when I inform you, that

both sexes here are one hundred and forty- 
nine; besides which^ there are thirty- 
four houses for poor boys, girls, and 
women; also eleven hospitals, five semina- 
ries for ecclesiastics, four principal churches, 
thirty-two parish churches, seventy other 
churches and chapels, and upwards of one 
hundred and thirty oratories, or chapels of 
religious fraternities." 

*' Blessed St. Benedict ! but there are 
iTiore than are good of them, I v.arrant,'' 
said Mactalla, still more convinced, from 
this circumstance of his master being a 
little deranged, as he could not for a mo- 
ment imagine a person of his education ig- 
norant on the subject. 

Osmond could not forbear blushing at 
the absence of mind which the inadvertent 
manner he had just spoken in evinced. 

" I merely meant, my good lad,*' said 
he, again addressing Zerbi, "that I wished 
to see the most celebrated parts of the 
city, and the buildings generally first visit- 
ed by strangers.*' 

i3 ''O, 



174 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' O^ now I understand you. Signer/' re- 
turned Zerh'ij no longer hesitating to lead 
the way. 

The cathedral dedicated to St. Januarius, 
and in which the head and blood of that 
Saint, the latter in two crystal vials, are 
kept, was the first place Osmond was taken 
to ; and, notwithstanding the abstracted 
state of his mind^ he viewed it with some 
attention, and altogether considered it a 
T_ry line old structure. 

The Jesuits* church too, and which he 
next visited, decorated as it was in every 
part with the most costly ornaments, also 
laid claim to his admiration ; nor did that 
of the holy Apostles, esteemed the richest 
in paintings and other embellishments, 
excite a less lively sensation. 

The celebrated convent too of St. Clare, 
supposed to- be the largest in the wo. id, 
containing no fewer than one hundred and 
fifty nuns, exclusive of servants of all de- 
nominations, he considered well worthy of 
regard, and as he viewed its magnificent 

church. 



THE DISCARDl^D SON. 173 

churchy could not forbear wishing to have 
had a peep into its interior. 

Bat what particularly pleased him was 
the sublime views most of the religious edi- 
fices commanded â€” views, with the vast ex- 
tent and amazing grandeur of which the 
magnificence of those buildings perfectly 
accorded. 

Amongst other places, as in his opinion 
better worth seeing than any other, Zerbi 
took Osmond to the Grotto del Cane. â€” 
Here, however, Osmond staid but a few 
minutes: the cruel experiments practis- 
ed on the most faithful of the brute crea- 
tion, drove him with horror and disgust 
from, the spot, astonished how any person 
could allow their curiosity to be gratified 
at the expence of their humanity. 

In their way back to the hotel, delight- 
ful music from an open church invited 
him to enter; he found it crowded, and 
enquiring the cause, learned it was the 
festival of the Saint to whom it was dedi- 
cated. 

1 4 The 



176 THE DISCARDED SON. 

The sacerdotal splendour here exhibited 
to his view was truly dazzling to his senses; 
his attention^, however, was quicklv di- 
verted from this by the noise and confu- 
sion, occasioned by the number of peo- 
ple who were perpetually crowding in and 
crowding out. 

More confused than gratified by the 
scene, Osmond soon endeavoured to 
make his escape ; but in vain he strove 
to regain the entrance. At length he suc- 
ceeded in getting to a side aisle, where 
again he began to breathe freely. He pro- 
ceeded down this till his progress was im- 
peded by a bar, which raising, he found 
himself, on advancing a few steps farther, 
in an inclosure, containing a small altar, 
before which he was somewhat startled, 
on perceiving a gentieman extended, ap- 
parently in a deep swoon, and which, from 
his hand being pressed against his left side, 
Osmond concluded to be owing to some 
hurt he had received there. 

^' Poor gentleman/' said he, stopping,. 

and 



THE DISCARDED SON. 177 

and turning towards Zevh'i, who^, notwith- 
standing the crowd and bustle they had just 
been in^ had contrived to keep close to 
him/ '' what a melancholy situation ! I wish 
we could find some door here that we 
might carry him out." 

''Carry him out !" repeated Zerbi, with 
a stare of astonishment. 

" Yes/' replied Osmond, but without at- 
tending to this look ; " the air would be of 
use to him." 

^' Of use to him, Signor !" again repeat- 
ed Zerbi, and staring if possible still more 
strangely at him. 

'' Doubtless^,"' returned Osmond, and 
stepping forward he passed his arm under 
his neck, for the purpose of rendering him. 
some assistance. Scarcely had he done so, 
however, when he felt himself almost 
dragged to the ground, by the violent pall 
Zerbi gave to the skirt of his coat, and 
who at the same moment exclaimed â€” 

" Signor, Signor, are you really madl** 
(of his being so indeed be had now no 
I 5 longer.' 



178 THE DISCAKDED SON. 

longer a doubt) '^ or do you mean to com- 
mit sacrilege by robbing the dead?" 

Osmond, in unutterable astonishment, 
stared first at Zerbi and then at the body 
before him. Ere he recovered sufficiently 
from this to sive utterance to the curio- 
sity so strange a circumstance excited, a 
monk approached, and being informed by 
Zerbi of what had just passed^ immediately 
conceived the mistake Osmond had made^, 
his appearance announcing him a foreign- 
er, and in consequence explained to him, 
that it was customary at Naples to bring 
every person to church in full dress, soou 
after their death, for the purpose of having 
the service read over them, W'hich ceremo- 
ny being performed, the corpse was car- 
ried home, and having no further occasion 
for its fine clothes, was then stripped to 
the shirt and buried privately. 

Osmond, though through politeness he 
forbore to say so, could not help thinking 
it ludicrous in the extreme, dressing out 
the dead in such a manner; their general 

costume 



THE DISCARDED SON. 179 

costume being embroidered clothes, laced 
hat, long ruffles, hair finely powdered^ a 
blooming nosegay in one hand^ and the 
other pressed in a graceful manner against 
the side; but by no means disapproved of 
the custom that he also undei-stood prevail- 
ed here of carrying them uncovered to the 
grave, (since, as an elegant and animated 
writer has observed) he conceived it a 
custom calculated to annihilate the puerile 
dread of corpses, and at the same time 
present an instructive and striking image 
of the vanity of human life. 

He thanked the monk for his politeness, 
and was still further indebted to him, 
by being let out by him at a private 
door. 

The pleasure which this his first tour 
through Naples would have afforded him, 
w^ouldhave been great, but for his having 
sought in vain throughout it for those he 
was so anxious to discover. With cncreas- 
ed heaviness of heart he returned to the 
hott:l, almost convijiced he should see them^ 
I 'i no.

no more. He could alone keep himself 
from absolute despair, by determining to 
write to the Count, to implore him to en- 
deavour to obtain from his aunt the address 
of Mr. Raymond, with which he had no 
doubt of her being acquainted. 

At the door of the hotel he found Mac- 
talla, apparently watching for his return, 
and to his surprise with a sorrowful coun- 
tenance. 

'' What's the matter ?" he hastily, and in 
some agitation inquired, on gaining his 
apartment ; ''has any thing unpleasant oc- 
curred during my absence, Mactalla ? â€” for 
you seem quite cast down." 

*' By the Powei-sand a good right I have 
to be so," said Mactalla, ''for we are going 
to lose Felisco/' 

" Yes, Signor,'' said Felisco, who had 
also followed his steps, and now with a low 
bow advanced into the room; "and more- 
over, 1 am on the point of being rendered 
the happiest of men.'*^ 

" Indeed !" cried Osmond, "then I as- 
sure 



THE DISCARDED SON. 181 

sure yoU;, my good friend, I rejoice to 
hear so, for the obh'gations you have laid 
me under have rendered me highly inte- 
rested about you/' 

'' I thank you. Sign or, for your good- 
ness," saidFelisco, with another bow; '-'and 
now permit me to say, that if you have any 
curiosity to learn the circumstances which 
occasioned my joining the villains we so 
fortunately escaped from, I shall be happy 
to gratify you." 

"If agreeable to you to relate them, I 
shall be happy to listen to you." 

"Love, Signor," (began Felisco) "love 
was the occasion of my imprudence. A 
young Paysanne, the daughter of a farmer, 
in whose service I engaged, in consequence 
of being obliged to forsake the neighbour- 
hood of my native village, soon made a 
conquest of my silly heart; but as I ima- 
gined her father would never consent to 
her bestowing herself on such a poor 
wight as I was, I did all in my power to 
smother the passion with which she had in- 
spired 



182 TOE DISCARDED SOK. 

spired me, and for that purpose strove, a3 
much as pos^iible, to shun her, but to no 
purpose ; ^Anerever I went, she was always, 
like my shaLlovs% close at my heels ; if I 
went to the field to sow grain. Bona was 
sure to be there before me ; if I went to 
examine the fences, I was sure to meet 
with Bona ; when I went to reap the har- 
vest. Bona would start out upon me, like 
a bird from the midst of the standing corn; 
and never did I visit the market town, 
without finding her there, dressed out in 
her holiday finery, and looking as beau- 
tiful as an angel. Nay, I assure you. Sig- 
ner," observing Osmond smile at these 
words, '' I don't exaggerate in saying so, 
which 1 imagine you'll allow, when I in- 
form you, she has a fine round fat facci 
as red as a full-blown rose, and about the 
size of a middling cheese, and that her 
person is stout in proportion ; then she is 
as blithe as a bird, and as strong as a young 
horse; can continue dancing longer than 
a person bitten by the tarantula, and ma-

THE DISCARDED SON. 183 

nage a load many men would complain of. 
Often and often did she lighten my labour, 
by carrying large sacks of corn to the gra- 
nary for me/* 

'' What a happy man/' interrupted Os- 
mond, '' to be able to look forward to hav- 
ing such a divinity in your arms ! upon 
my word, Mr. Felisco, you are an enviable 
fellow/' 

'' Ay, so I should have said too/' cried 
Mactalla, '' had he said less of Miss Bona's 
fat face.'* 

"Well, every one to his taste," said Fe- 
lisco, but with rather an air of chagrin ; 
" if every one had the same, why what 
would there be but continual squabbles in 
the world."' 

"^ Justly observed, in;leed,*' cried Os- 
mond ; " and so now, if you please, my 
good friend, go on with your story.'* 

'' WeW, Signor, one day, it had like to 
have proved a fatal day to me, I went to 
market with some corn, â–  and there, as 
usual, I found her before me, flaunting iu

new ribbonS;, as gay and as proud as a 
horse oh the Corso^, looking altogether so 
charming indeed, that I could not forbear, 
contrary to my usual custom, ogling her a 
little ; for persuaded her father would 
never consent to our union, I tried, by 
distance towards her, to check a passion, 
that of course I could not but suppose 
would render her unhappy/' 

'' Generous indeed," said Osmond. 

'' Ah, Signor, but generosity in love 
affairs is seldom I believe of any long du- 
ration. Instead of returning my smile, as I 
expected, and indeed wished, she passed 
me with a scornful air, and immediately 
fell into discourse with a young man, the 
son of a neighbour, and who, I had some 
reason to imagine, looked upon her with 
an eye of love. In this idea, as also that I 
had deceived myself with regard to her 
sentiments for me, I soon became confirm- 
ed by the conduct I now saw going on 
between them. In short. Sign or, I got 
jealous, and at last became so transported 

with: 



THE DISCARDED SON. 185 

with fury on seeing her allow him to kiss 
her, that without more ado, I drew my 
stiletto, and flying upon them, plunged 
it first into her bosom, and then into his, 
savagely determining that no one should 
possess the happiness I coveted. 

'' The people gathered round ; I escaped 
through the crowd, and took refuge in the 
first church I came to, where ol course I 
was safe; but I could not remain here for 
ever; so in the dead of the night I resolved 
on flying to a neighbouring forest, in 
hopes of finding some one there who 
would take me into their service. But in 
these hopes I was disappointed, and being 
nearly starved, was on the point of ven- 
turing from my hiding-place, when I was 
surprised by a troop of banditti; my de- 
plorable situation excited their curiosity, 
and on hearing my melancholy story, they 
invited me to make one of their number, 
an invitation despair of obtaining a live- 
lihood in any other way, induced me 
after a little hesitation to comply with. 

Bitter 



185 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Bitter repentance^ however, soon overtook 
me for doing so, and I was meditatini^ my 
escape from the villains, at the very time 
you, Signor, and my friend Mactalla here, 
fell into their hands. 

'' What followed that event you know 
already ; all I have further therefore to re- 
late is, that it was my intention to have 
sought a living in some far distant country^ 
Init for the occurrence of this day. Passing^ 
through the Strada di Toledo, I found my* 
self suddenly clasped in the arms of a 
young man, the same I almost instantly 
perceived whom I thought I had killed. I 
leave you to judge, wSignor, what my asto- 
nishment at the moment must have been ; 
as also my joy, particularly when informed 
by him that my sweet Bona had also es- 
caped death, and was perfectly recover- 
ed, and loved me as well, if not better, 
for the proof, though so cruel a one, I had 
given of my passion for her. He more^ 
over told me that the scene which so work- 
ed upon my feelings in the market-place, 

was 



THE DISCARDED SON. ISf 

was entirely a contrivance of her's^ to dis- 
cover whether I really loved her or not, 
which she was rather ddiibtfnl of, owing 
to the reserve with which I treated her; and 
that her father finding nothing else would 
render her happy, and pleased besides with 
my conduct whilst in his service, had con- 
sented to our being united, if w^e ever met 
again. So to-morrov^ I propose setting 
Out for their village, and as I said at the 
commencement of my story, as-i thus on 
the point of becoming the happiest of 
men ; for though so imprudent as to asso- 
ciate for a time with a band of villains, 
yet as they never could prevail on me to 
perpetrate any heinous ofience, I flatter 
myself 'tis a circumstance which will not 
make against me with the old farmer, espe- 
cially when the motives that led to it are 
taken into consideration. 

'' My own prospects have not rendered 
me unmindful of what I owe to the com- 
munity ; I have already lodged information 
against the banditti, so that in a short time 

1 trust 



188 THE DISCARDED SON. 

I trust the public will be freed from their 
depredations.'" 

He then concluded, by informing Os- 
Blond that as the villaoe he was Â£:oinÂ«: to 
"was in the road to Acerenza, he would, if 
he pleased^ take the French boy along with 
him, who it was settled was to return thi- 
ther. 

Osmond gladly embraced such an op- 
portunity to send him back, and availed 
himself of the same to write to the Count. 

He warmly congratulated Feliscp on the 
happy termination of his troubles, and 
pressed a sum of money on him, as a proof 
of the sincerity of his gratitude for the 
services he had received from him, â€” 
Not being able, however, to prevail on 
him to accept this, he had Zerbi again 
summoned, and was conducted by him to 
a shop, where he purchased a handsome 
piece of silk for a wedding gown for the 
fair Bona, and a plain but neat suit of 
clothes for her husband elect, presents 
which he could not decline. 

Evening 



THE DISCARDED SON". 1^9 

Evening was approaching, and Osmond 
was on the point of going out upon another 
ramble, when a note was presented to him 
from Lord O'Sinister, requesting to see 
him immediately. 

That he did not delay obeying- the sum- 
mons of his noble friend, may readily be 
believed. He repaired to him with a de- 
termination of reposing unlimited confi- 
dence in him respecting the Raymonds, 
conceiving his assistance might do much 
towards enabling him to discover them. 

He found him in a magnificent drawling- 
room, but to his great surprise â€” a surprise 
not to be wondered at, considering what 
he had heard in the morning, reclined upon 
a couch, in a loose dress, and with his legs 
rolled up in flannel. 

After mutual interrogations had taken 
place, and his Lordship had informed Os- 
mond, whom he received with every de- 
monstration of pleasure, that ill health was 
the cause of his present visit to Naples, but 
in which he was unaccompanied by his 

family. 



190 THE DISCARDED SON. 

family, and gladdened his heart by telling 
him that he had heard from Heathwood 
but a few days previous to his departure 
from England^ and that all were then well 
there^ he proceeded to enquire why he 
did not wait to see him in the morning, 
adding, he knew nothing of his having 
called till after dinner, or he should cer- 
tainly have sent to request his company to 
it. 

Osmond unhesitatingly informed him. 
''Out riding!" repeated his Lordship, 
angrily, '' good heavens, how stupid of 
any of my people to say such a thing ! 
I was in bed at the time you called, and 
assure you I shall consider myself well of]^ 
if able to bear even the motion of a car- 
riage in the course of a month, so severely 
have I suffered by this attack of the 
gout." 

Then extending his hand to a bell that 
hung near the arm of the couch, he rang it 
violently. 

'' Who was it answered Mr, Munro }" m 

a tone 



THE DISCARDED SON. 191 

a tone of high displeasure, he demand- 
ed of the servant who obeyed his sum- 
nions. 

'' I don't know who your Lordship 
means/' replied the servant. 

" I mean the gentleman who left the 
note which I received at dinner/* 

" O, the gentleman who called while 
your Lordship was out riding/' as if sud- 
denly recollecting the circumstance. *' It 
was I, my Lord." 

"You infernal blockhead!" cried his 
Lordship, raising himself from his recum- 
bent posture, fury sparkling in his eyes, 
" what do you mean by saying I was out, 
w^hen you know I was in bed at the time Mr. 
Munro called, and that I have not been 
able to get into a coach, much less on 
horseback, since my arrival at Kaples. â€” 
You know there is no one in this house 
that rides out at present but Jenkins." 

^'True, true, my Lord," stammered out 
the man, in an atii-igh ted tone, and great 
confusion^ " but Iâ€” Iâ€” ^" 

" None 



199 THE DISCAT^DED SON. 

'' None of your stupid explanation5?. 
Sir V vociferated his Lordship. ''I have no- 
thing more to say to you than this â€” if you 
do not, of your own accord, know what 
answer to give my friends, enquire, for I 
am not to run the risk of having them 
offended through the blunders of my peo- 
ple. Retire, and remember I shall not 
give you a second admonition on the sub- 
jcct.- 

As soon as he had withdrawn, and his 
Lordship, with his wonted politeness, had 
apologized to Osmond for the vent he had 
given to his passion before him, he de- 
sired to know to what circum^ance his 
being in Naples was owing, having left 
England on so diOerent a destination, add- 
ing, in the whole course of his life, he 
had never been so surprised as by finding 
him here. 

Osmond as briefly as possible narrated 
all that had befallen him since his embarka- 
tion from England. 

His Lordship listened with the most pro- 
found 



TftE DISCARDED SON. 1 9S 

found attention to his narrative^ and also, 
to judge from his sudden starts, and the 
various changes his countenance under- 
went, with the most lively emotion. 

Instead, however, of expressing the 
sympathy which from these circumstances 
Osmond was led to believe it had excited 
in his mind, it was scarcely concluded, ere 
he burst into an immoderate and appa- 
rently uncontrolable fit of laughter, to 
the unutterable confusion as well as sur- 
prise of Osmond, who saw nothing in 
what he had been relating calculated to 
create mirth. 

'' My dear young friend,*' said the wily 
Peer, as soon as he had a little recovered 
himself, perceiving, by the flushing cheek, 
and kindling eye of Osmond, the resent- 
ment his unseasonable and apparently un- 
controlable mirth had excited â€” '' I ask ten 
thousand pardons for the latitude I have 
given to my feelings in the present in-

more pained than amused by your narra-

suffered yourself to be imposed upon by 
a set of artful adventurers." 

*^^ Adventurers, my Lord!" echoed Os- 
mond, with a look which seemed to say 
he did not perfectly understand him. 

" Yes/* returned his Lordship, with the 
utmost coolness, '' I dcn't pretend to say 
your Count Placentia is one, but then he 
is no better than a ridiculous fool, who 
has inspired you with hopes of the most 
futile, the most chimerical nature ; but I 
again assert, your Raymonds are. People 
of real consequence don't so easily fall 
into the hands of banditti as they led you 
to imagine. In a word, I have not a doubt 
on my mind of their being very intimately 
acquainted with the honourable gentlemen

movements were better known than you 
were aware of; or of their having associ- 
ated with you, under the hope of being 
introduced here in such a manner as should 
prevent any suspicion of what they were in 
reality being entertained; neither of their 
having gone off with the silence and secrecy 
they did, owing to their finding at length, 
through your own confession, for you say 
you were very candid with them, that this 
was a hope which could not be realized 
through your means, in consequence of 
your being a stranger here." 

^*^ Good heavens, my Lord!" exclaimed 
Osmond, all astonishment, '' what a suppo- 
sition, after telling you of our being pur- 
sued by the banditti, of their having been 
at Acerenza " 

*' You wonder I could entertain such a 
one. Trust me, my dear Osmond, your 
being pursued by the banditti was a mere 
stratagem, to prevent your suspecting

quently inducing people to have recourse 
to even superfluous measures to guard 
against detection; and as to their having 
been at Acerenza, did you ever see them 
at the Castle of Acerenza^ or hear aught 
of them there, but from a domestic^ doubt- 
less in league with them, to impose upon 
you and others ? In short, I am so 
thoroughly persuaded of their being v;r:at 
I have styled them, that not all your elo- 
jQUence will be able to make me forego this 
opinion ; neither shall I be able to divest 
myself of uneasiness on your account, ex- 
cept you promise to think no more of 
them â€” solemnly promise, should chance 
again throw them in your way, to avoid 
them as you would plague, pestilence, and 
famine/' 

'' Impossible, my Lord/' said Osmond, 
with warmth; ''never will I make a pro- 
mise I do not mean to fulfil. In place of 
flying, 'tis my fixed determination to per-

at it a very improbable circusnstance, and 
consequently that your present suspicions 
are erroneous/' 

'^ By no means, '^ replied his Lordship, 
'' for I am persuaded the banditti are not 
fonfined to one haunt. In a word, instead 
of being induced by reflection to give up 
what you are pleased to style my erroneous 
suspicions, I am the more confirmed in 
them by it.*' 

'' Then we had better drop the subject,

^ since one on which there is a difference 
of opinion cannot be dismissed too soon/' 
" Assuredly/* assented his Lordship^,

essential to the welfare of any particular 
person to have it further discussed. My 
dear Osmond/* he continued^ in one of 
his most insiduous tones, and with a cor- 
responding look, laying his hand too on 
Bis arm as he spoke, and gently pressing 
it, " you look displeased, you look oflfend- 
cd ; but surely, my dear fellow, you should 
not be angrv with a man for speaking his 
real sentiments, nor piqued with him for 
giving advice, when conscious, as I flatter 
myself in the present instance you must 
be, that his motive for doing so is friend- 
ship. If I had not the sincerest, the most 
heartfelt regard for you^ believe me I never

something like a sigh from the arm of 
Osmond, as he spoke, " none 1 now per- 
ceive is more distressing than that of of- 
fering advice/' 

^' Oh, my Lord," cried Osmond, com- 
pletely imposed upon in this instance, as he 
had been in many others, by the plausibility 
of the Peer, and ashamed of the petulance 
he now conceived he had betrayed, '' do 
not wrono; me so much as to imagine I can

coolness, '^ that is, if I had met with them 
in the way you did, and had been treated

or liberal sentiments, are requisite to pre-

ceptions daily, hourly practised in it.â€” 
The Camilla of Le Sage, and the Milwood

of jewels^ or a wealthy uncle in this 
quarter, they would not^ I dare say, 
fiave agonized your feelings by taking 
themselves off in the manner they did." 

" Gracious heaven !" exclaimed Osmond^ 
starting up in an agitation which shook 
his frame, and again flushed his cheek 
with crimson, '' what a horrible assertion f 
â€¢ â€” let us wave this subject, my Lord,'* he 
added, after a transient pause, endeavour- 
ing to collect himself, and returning to 
the couch, from which unconsciously he 
ha'^ started. 

" With all my heart,*' said his Lordship, 
nodding; *^ and yet, my dear lad,*' mo- 
tioning Osmond to resume his seat, " J 
am apprehensive the one I am about intro- 
ducing will not prove more agreeable.** 

** 'Tis impossible it can prove less so, 
my Lord." returned Osmond, calmly, and 
somewhat coolly ; for though persuaded 
Lord O'Sinister had spoken as he had done 
from the best motives, yet could he not 

help 



THE DISCARDED SON. 203 

help feeling both indignant and resentful, 
at hearing those, so dear to his regard, so 
truly believed by him to be already deserv- 
ing of being 

" Ensky'd and sainted," 

traduced in such a manner. 

^'Vvell then," proceeded his Lordship, 
'^' not to keep you in suspense, know that 
1 should consider myself unworthy of the 
appellation of your friend â€” the friend of 
your family, if I delayed^apprizing you of 
the destruction that to a certainty awaits

me out without interruption," observing 
Osmond again all emotion, and on the 
point of speaking; ''your doing so will 
not deprive you of the power- of still act- 
ing as yoii please." 

Osmond bowed respectfully, and the 
subtle Peer thus went on â€” 

'' The hopes which you indulge respect- 
ing the Duke D'Amalfi, are, trust me, 
like an edifice raised on sand, without a

not been my first visit to Naples, and 
know him to be, in every sense of the 
word, a complete courtier â€” a man who 
will never think of patronizing a person 
who has not, in some way or other, the 
power of renderin<j him a sen' ice. He 
is not, I assure you, by any means, one 
of those characters that find a pleasure 
in sheltering modest merit, and drawing 
it from obscurity. To use the words of 
a dramatic writer â€” '' If you can do him 
here, he will do you there,'' but not 
else. I leave you, therefore, to judge 
whether without even that claim upon 
his protection, which being a fellow-sub- 
ject would give you^ you have the least 
chance of succeeding with him." 

'*^ O, my Lord,'' cried Osmond, in an 
accent which proved it was with difficulty 
he had heard his Lordship thus far^, " I 
cannot believe that the Count Placcntia^ 
the Marchesa Morati, would expose me 
to such a humiliating disappointment as 
S your 



THE DISCARDEB SON. 203 

your Lordship intimates I am likely, or 
rather certain of experiencing from the 
Duke D'Amalfi. Neither can I believe 
that his Excellency would, voluntarily, 
incur the resentment of relations he so 
truly, as well as deservedly, esteems, 
by making a promise to them he never 
meant to fulfil. He pledged his word to 
them to provide for me, and never will 
I relinquish the hopes his assurance to 
do so has inspired, till I have unques- 
tionable proofs of their being deceitful 
ones/' 

'' Ere you obtain these, it may be toa 
late for you," said his Lordship, in an 
impressive tone, '' to remedy the evils 
which waiting for their realization caa 
scarcely fail of drawing on you. â€” The 
Duke D'Amalfi will not speedily termi- 
nate your suspense, lest if he did, his in- 
sincerity respecting you should be sus- 
pected ; and when he does, trust me he 
will not want a pretext for disappoint-

with the Acerenza family ; for men like 
him, versed in the arts of courts, are 
never at a loss to extricate themselves from 
any ditEculty. If you knew as mucii of 
the deceptions of life as I do, believe me, 
my dear Osmond, you would not be so 
incredulous in the present instance as you 
are." 

'' May I ever continue a si ranger to 
what is calculated to introduce si;r:pit:ion 
^nd distrust into the mind," said Osmond, 
with wavipth and energy ; '-' for I would 
rather sometimes be deceived, than live 
in perpetual apprehensions, of being so ; 
since if confidence between ^nan and man 
be destroyed, there can be no happiness 
in society," 

''Ah, this is quite the enthusiastic rant 
'of a* romantic mind," cried his Lordship, 
with a smile and a shrug ; " take my word

delay, this dangerous region of luxury. â€”

creasing vehemence, convinced, by per- 
ccifing no change in the countenance 
of Osmond, that Delacour had not en- 
lightened him with regard to his cha- 
racter, and that he might therefore ven- 
ture to press the matter, *' and do not re- 
fuse it again.** 

'' Believe me, my Lord," returned Os-

decline availing myself of it; for as. I

demanded his Lordship,, sitting upright on 
the couch, and fastening his keenly pene-

Again a Tdow was the only reply he re-

education, authorizes me to interfere in 
your conduct; prepare, therefore, %vith- 
out further hesitation, for your departure

" Excuse me, my Lord," said Osmond; 
^' I cannot think of preparing for what I do 
not intend should take place." 

'^ But I say. Sir," striking the arm of the 
couch with violence, " I say. Sir, there is 
a likelihood of your departure hence taking 
place; ways are to be found of overcoming 
obstinacy.* 

*' With your permission, my Lord,'* 
cried Osmond, " I w^ill now retire ; for I 
see my protracting my visit can answer no 
other end, than that of adding to the agita- 
tion it pains me to see you in, in your pre- 
sent state of health." 

" No, Sir, you shall not retire till you

" Then I must tell you. Sir/' said his 
Lordship, with a countenance distorted 
with fury, '' you are an ungrateful young 
villain! â€” a hypocrite! â€” an impostor! â€” a 
disgrace to the profession you have em- 
braced ! â€” a reproach to me for having 
thrown away my kindness!*' 

'' My Lord/' said Osmond, proudly, 
'' my heart acquits me of having merited 
such language." 

'' Then, by Heaven ! when your con-

it, itsh^ll, 'tis all that will acquit you. Not

the couch, on which he had hitherto been 
reclining, with the agility of an opera 
dancer^ and traversing- the room with quick 
and disordered steps, to the utter amaze- 
ment of Osmond, w^ho, from the state in 

which 



THE DISCARDED SON. ^15 

which he described himself, as well as his 
appearance^ had not an idea of his being 
able to move without assistance^ '' nothing 
degrading/* he proceeded, as if transport- 
ed out of himself by passion, '' which you 
do not merit at my hands, for the injury 
you have done me/' 

"Injury, my Lord!" cried Osmond. 

^^ Yes, Sir, the irreparable injury you 
have done me, by robbing me.*' 

''Robbing you, my Lord!** cried Os- 
mond, again echoing his words. '' Of 
what, my Lord ?'* he demanded, in the 
peremptory and steady voice of courage 
and conscious innocence, 

''Of what!" repeated the Peer; ^'why 
ofâ€” -ofâ€” myâ€” my tranquiHity !" he added, 
as if suddenly recollecting himself, and in 
a tone, and with a smile of the most insi- 
dious expression. 

" Then I will now take my leave, my

'*^Stop, Sir!" said his Lordship^ stamp- 
ing; the flannels in which his legs were 
enveloped, dropped, at the moment^ 
about his heels, and to the, if possible, en- 
creasing astonishment of Osmond, disco- 
vered them cased up in boots. 

The looks of Osmond first made him sen- 
sible of what had happened. For an in- 
stant he appeared confused ; then, as if 
to prove the correctness of what he had 
said, relative to a person brought up in 
the great world never being at a loss to 
relieve themselves from an embarrassment, 
he asserted, as with evidently feigned 
difficulty he returned to the couch, that he 
had been ordered by his physicians to wear 
boots, as a means of keeping down the 
swelling in his legs, and that he had not a 
doubt but that the exertions into which he 
had been hurried by the passion his (Os- 
mond's) obstinacy had thrown him into, 

would 



THE DISCARDED SON. 21/ 

would be attended with injurious conse- 
quences to him. 

Osmond, with an involuntary smile of 
scornful incredulity, for that his Lordship 
was, at the present period, no more 
an invalid than himself, he was now 
thoroughly convinced, from what had just 
passed, though why, or wherefore he 
should feign indisposition to him, was ut- 
terly above his comprehension, instead 
of appearing to notice this observation, 
drew still nearer to the door, but was 
again commanded to stop by his Lord- 
ship. 

'' Stop, Sir,'' said he again; '' I cannot 
permit you to withdraw, till I have told 
you, that less of the coxcomb in your ap- 
pearance would suit better with your pro- 
fession and prospects in life." 

'' The coxcomb, my Lord!" cried Os- 
mond, returning his malicious glance with 
an involuntary indignant and enquiring 
one. 

VOL. IV. L '* Yes, 



218 THE DISCARDED SON. 

1 '' YeSj Sir, the coxcomb ; else you 
would not wear that glittering gewgaw on 
your finger/' glancing at the right hand of 
Osmond, on which sparkled the valued gift 
of Mrs. Raymond. 

'' I have already told you, my Lord, how 
I came by this ring; as a pledge of friend- 
ship, I conceive myself fully warranted to 
wear it.'' 

" Doubtless," rejoined his Lordship, "as 
you do, to do whatever else you like. â€” 
Will you have the goodness. Sir, to favour 
me with a more particular view of that 
ring ?" 

'' Assuredly, my Lord," and immediate- 
ly drawing it from his finger, .he presented 
it to him. 

His Lordship examined it in silence ; 
then resting the hand which held it on the 
arm of the couch, he turned, with some- 
thing like his wonted countenance, to Os- 
mond, and after expressing his regret 
for the warmth into which they had 
^ been 



been transported, proposed, as they both* 
appeared tolerably cool again, their going 
over the subject they had just been dis- 
cussing. 

*^' Pardon me, my Lord," said Osmond;, 
^^ for objecting to this proposal, as my 
sentiments are unchangeable : to renew the 
subject we have been speaking on, could 
answer no other purpose than to renew 
the disagreeable altercation it gave rise to.'* 

'' Then, Sir,'' haughtily waving his hand, 
" you may retire ; and recollect the repe- 
tition of this visit will not by any means be 
agreeable to me/' 

'^ I am so well convinced of that, my 
Lord,'* returned Osmond, with a smile â€” 
but a smile of bitterness, '' that an idea of 
repeating it never once entered my head. 
â€” My fortune, 'tis true, is humble,*' he 
added, emphatically, and laying his hand 
on his breast, '' but the spirit of inde- 
pendance lodges here, and will ever, I 
trust, keep me aloof from him. who is ca-

*^'What, Sir! this to me?" demanded 
the Peer^ '' this to my face?'* 

'' Only to your face, my Lord/' cried 
Osmondj impressively ; '' I have nothing 
of the assassin in my disposition; I know 
not the meanness, the vileness of abusing 
an absent person.'* 

" I wish to be alone. Sir/' said his Lord- 
ship, with contemptuous coolness. 

'' My ring, my Lord, if you please, and 
your wish shall be gratified.'* 

'^^ Your ring, Sir!" repeated the Peer, 
in an accent of well-counterfeited asto- 
nishment, and raising himself from the arm 
of the cpuch, against which he had been 
leanino' â€” '^ vour rino-. Sir !" starin^: at Os- 
mond. 

" Yes, the ring, my Lord," repeated 
Osuiond, in a still more peremptory 
tone, '' which I put into your Lerd- 
s^aip's hands but a few minutes ago." 

^â€¢'Why 



THE DISCARDED SON. 25 i 

'^ Why you dream^ Sir â€” you dream!*' 
said his Lordship. 

'' O, my Lord/* cried Osmond, indig- 
nantly, '' this is really trifling with me 
past endurance." 

" Why, you scoundrel V returned his 
Lordship, ''do you mean to brand me with 
the epithet of thief?'' 

Osmond surveyed him for a few minutes 
in silence; then, with calmness â€” but a 
calmness, the expression of his counte- 
nance, his every look, his every gesture, 
proved to be more the result of contempt 
than reasonâ€”-'' My Lord, I have done,'* 
he said ; " reflection will, I make no doubt, 
render you fully sensible of, pardon the 
expression â€” the unworthinessof your con- 
duct to me." â€” Then slightly bowing, he 
quitted the apartment. 

With lingering steps Osmond proceed- 
ed towards the hotel, too much disturb- 
ed in mind to wish to enter yet any 
place where he was liable to observa- 
tion. 

L 3 But 



J222 THE DISCARDED SON. 

But powerful as were the emotions of 
anger and resentment which the outrageous 
conduct of Lord O'Sinister had given birth 
to, they were^ if possible^ surpassed by 
the surprise^, the curiosity it also excited. 
What his reason could be for wishing to 
appear an invalid in his eyes^, what his 
motive for driving him to Jamaica â€” for 
that he had a hidden one for desiring to get 
him thither was now evident to Osmond â€” 
he could not possibly conceive. 

Had his Lordship been a younger and a 
single man, he would have been almost 
tempted to solve the mystery, by suppos- 
ing him his rival with Miss Raymond, anxi- 
ous, on her account, to banish him to a 
distance; but situated as his Lordship was, 
Osmond in vain sought to fasten on some 
conjecture that might enlighten him on the 
present subject. 

While ahnost bewildering his brain with 
endeavouring to do this, a thousand broken 
hints, and disjointed sentences of Dela- 
cour'Sji all tending to prove his Lordship 

was 



THE DISCARDED SON, 223 

was not by any means the character he 
conceived hini^ recurred to his recollec- 
tion^ and inspin^d him with vague misgiv- 
ings and strange imaginings, such as de- 
cided him on making the most strenuous 
exertions to cancel the pecuniary obliga- 
tions he and his family were under to his 
Lordship. 

'^'^ Good heavens!" he mentally exclaim- 
ed, '''to what Kudden revolutions are we 
liable in this lif^! â€” our tastes, our feel- 
ings, our sentiments, as well as our situa- 
tions! But a few hours aoo, and how ex- 
alted was my opinion of lord O'Sinisfer ! 
now how ignoble do T think him ! â€” mean, 
tyrannical, dissimulative, presuming upon 
the name of benefactor, to dictate and 
govern \" 

That it was entirely out of malice his 
Lordship had kept back his ring from him, 
he persuaded himself; he could not how- 
ever bring himself to believe. that he meant 
to retain it ; but this belief did not prevent 
him from determining to send for it the 
L 4 ensuing 



224 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ensuing morning, should he not have re- 
ceived it before then. 

The expression of his countenance, and 
the agitation of his manner, on his return 
to the hotel, did not, by any means, tend 
to dissipate the idea with which his valet 
was at present impressed concerning him; 
for as he had learned from the servant who 
brought the note from Lord O'Sinister to 
Osmond, that his Lordship was a particular 
friend of his master, he could not possibly 
imagine that any thing disagreeable had 
occurred in the interview between them, 
and of conseqi'ience attributed the wild- 
ness and disorder of Osmond's looks to 
mental derangement. 

This being the last night he and Felisco 
had to pass together, they sat up to a late 
hour. Ere he went to bed, Mactalla 
thought it but prudent to take a peep at 
his master, so great was the perturbation 
of spirits under which he had retired 
to repose. Accordingly he softly entered 
his chamber, and setting down his light 

near 



THE DISCARDED SON. 255 

near the entrance, advanced with cautious 
steps to the bed, and gently parting the 
side-curtains^ had the satisfaction of find- 
ing him in a sound sleep. 

^' Ha, ha!" he cried to himself, on per- 
ceiving this, '' blessed St. Benedict has 
heard my prayers. This good rest will do 
wonders : 'twill restore him to his risfht 
senses ; blessings on his heart and hand- 
some face, what a pity that he should lose 
them for a woman V for osWng to some 
hints received from Felisco, who had had 
greater opportunities than he of observing 
Miss Raymond and Osmond, he no longer 
ascribed the supposed malady of his master 
solely to fatigue. Then withdrawing his 
head, he was on the point of closing the 
curtains, when Osmond, under the in- 
fluence of a dream, which represented 
Lord O'Sinister in the act of giving orders 
to some ruffians to seize and force him on 
board a vessel bound to Jamaica, start- 
ed up, and catching him by the collar, ex- 
L 5 claimed â€” 



2^6 THE DISCARDED SO?^. 

claimed â€” *"' No, villain, no, you shall not 
overcome me !" 

Mactalla, supposing the fit now strong 
upon him, exerted all his strength to dis- 
engage himself from his grasp, but in vain; 
finding which, he roared out for help, and 
soon succeeded in drawing a number of 
people to the room. The tumult they oc- 
casioned quickly brought Osmond to him- 
self, and, utterly abashed, he shrunk be- 
neath the bed-clothes ; while Mactalla, 
half-beside himself with terror and grief, 
answered their interrogations as to the 
cause of his outcries, by exclaiming â€” '' He 
is mad ! â€” he is mad \" 

Osmond, though almost provoked be-^ 
yond forbearance by this assertion, aware, 
as he was, of the irreparable injury it was 
calculated to do him, was yet too appre- 
hensive that to enter into any argument 
on the subject at present would only be ta 
confirm it, not to restrain his feelings, and 
content himself with merely requesting to 

be 



THE DISCARDED SON. 227 

be left again to his repose^ which a dis- 
agreeable dream^ he added^ had alone in- 
terrupted. 

This request, after some hesitation^ and 
a minute examination of his chamber, to 
see there was nothing in it with which he 
could injure himself, was at length com- 
plied with: sleep, however, visited him no 
more that night. 

The first thing he did, on rising the 
next morning, was to summon his valet to 
liis presence. 

Alarmed by the recollection- of^ what he 
had said concerning him the preceding 
night, Mactalla appeared before him with 
downcast eyes and an embarrassed air. â€” 
Ere Osmond entered into any remon- 
strance with him on the mischief such a 
report as he had set afloat respecting him 
was calculated to do, he demanded his 
grounds for it; and on being informed, 
could not avoid acknowledging to himself^ 
that the wildness and abstraction of his 
manner^ since his arrival at Naples, was 
l6 quite 



2^8 THE DISCARDED SOX. 

quite sufficient to induce a belief of his 
being a little deranged. For this he now 
accounted^ in such a manner as dissipated 
every idea of its being owing to aught but 
uneasiness of mind, and succeeded in con- 
vincing Mactaila, that â€” 

** His pulse, as his, did temperately keep time, 
And make as healthful music." 

The morning having nearly elapsed with- 
out any message from Lord O'Sinister^ as 
Osmond fully expected^ he, at lengthy 
wrote the following note to his Lordship, 
and dispatched it by Mactalla : â€” 



To the Right Honourable Lord Viscount 
O' Sinister. 

'^ My LorDj 

'' My extreme anxiety to 
recover the valued gift of friendship which 

I left 



THE DISCARDEI) SON. 2S^9= 

I left in your possession last nighty must 
plead my apology for again intruding upon 
your Lordship ; should it, by any accident, 
have been mislaid, I must entreat vour 
Lordship to have the goodness to direct a 
search for it. 

'' I have the honour to be, 
'' My Lord, 
^' Your Lordship's obedient servant, 

" Osmond Munro,'^ 



To this laconic billet Mactalia brought 
back an equally laconic one in reply, pen- 
ned by the worthy confidant and confede- 
rate of his Lordship, Mr. Jenkins. It ran 
thus: â€” 



'' Mr. Munro, 

"My Lord desires me to 
i&ay, he is utterly amazed at your persisting 

in 



!^50 THE DISCARDED S05T. 

in the insolentassertion you made last night. 
He bids me further tell you, that should 
you have the temerity to repeat it, he will, 
without further hesitation, have recourse to 
legal measures to silence you on it. 
'' I am. Sir, 
" Your's, 

'' J. Jenkins/^ 



While this note was penning, Mactalla 
was conversing with the servant who had 
been the bearer of his Lordship's first one 
to Osmond, and who, by some means or 
other, having: contrived to overhear the 
conversation that took place between them 
in their recent interview, now repeated 
the same to Mactalla, to his utter rage and 
amazement, insomuch that it was with dif- 
ficulty he was prevented making his way to 
his Lordship, for the purpose of reproach- 
ing him for his ungenerous conduct to- 
wards 



THE DISCARDED' SON. 231 

wards his mastei% and enforcing the resto- 
ration of the ring:. 

Osmond was so irritated by the perusal 
of Mr. Jenkins's insolent prodiiction^ as 
to snatch up his hat, with an intention of 
directly hastening to Lord O'Sinister's^ but 
on the threshold of the door reflection in- 
terposed to arrest his steps ; and the addi- 
tional mortifications which the considera- 
tion of a minute sufficed to convince him 
he should draw upon himself by seeking 
another interview with the Peer^ induced 
him to abandon the idea altogether. 

But never had he found a conquest over 
himself so difficult as in the present in^ 
stance, so insulted, so aggrieved did he con- 
sider himself. 

As soon as reason had regained her em- 
pire over him, pride stimulated him to 
make such exertions as should keep from 
the knowledge of his servant;, of whose 
knowrnof au^ht of what had recently oc- 
eurred he had no idea, the feelings then 
passing in his mind; and still further was 
^ he 



2^5'^ THE DISCA-RDED SON. 

he prompted to endeavour to regain an 
appearance of composure^ by the momen- 
tary expectation he was now in of being 
summoned to the Duke D'Amalfi. Instead, 
however^ of this being the case, he re- 
ceived another no^e from his Excellency, 
apologizing for being under the necessity 
of again putting off seeing him for a few 
days, owing to his being obliged to wait 
upon the king, then at Casserta; but en- 
treating him, in the interim, if needing 
any immediate service at his hands, not to 
be backward acknowledging the same. 

Osmond returned a polite and grateful 
answer to this billet, in which, after 
thanking his Excellency for his conde- 
scending goodness, he assured him, that 
emboldened by it, he should have had no 
hesitation in availing himself of it, had he 
any occasion. 

Osmond spent part of this evening in 
a;]:ain ramblins^ about the citv^ and visiting 
some of the public rooms, v^hich in Naples 
are reckoned peculiarly agreeable, answer- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 25-3 

ing the same purposes as the English cof- 
fee-housesj with this difference^ that they 
have a double ad vanta^^e with reoard to so- 
ciety ; ladies of the first fashion, as well 
as gentlemen, resorting to them, and 
passing their time in agreeable conversa- 
tion. 

Three days passed without any occur- 
rence worth relating, during which Os- 
mond was in momentary expectation of 
again hearing from the Duke. On the 
morning of the fourth the following letter 
was delivered to him :~ 



To Mr. Munro. 

'^ Notwithstanding the re- 
sentment your conduct has inspired me 
with, the friendship I feel for your father 
actuates me to make another efibrt to save 
you from destruction^ by candidly inform- 

ing^ 



S34 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ing you, a storm, you little dream of, is 
ready to burst on you, should you persist 
in your resolution of continuing here; but 
that this will be the case, I cannot believe 
â€” no, ere this, I both hope and imagine re- 
flection, which I knov/ often achieves what 
persuasion cannot, has made you sensible 
of the error you committed in opposing 
my wishes â€” an error, however^ which I 
shall forgive, should I find you repent- 
ant. 

" Your destiny is placed, I may say, in 
your own hands; should it, therefore, 
prove unfortunate, you will have no one 
to blame but yourself. 

" I shall expect an immediate answer^ 
for your own sake I trust it may be such 
a one as sliall restore you to the friendship 
of 

" O'SlNISTER.'" 



Without 



THE DISCARDED SON. S55 

Without hesitation, though not without 
indignation, Osmond returned the follow- 
ing nnswer to his Lordship: â€” 



** My Lord, 

"Were I to grant to threats 
what I have refused to solicitation, I should 
incur, what, since my commencement in 
life, it has been my study to avoid â€” my 
own contempt ! 

" Reflection, so far from convincing me 
I committed an error in resisting your 
Lordship's wishes for my departure hence, 
has tended to convince me that I should 
have been guilty of an unpardonable one, 
had I acquiesced in them. 

" If, therefore, nothing but acting con- 
trary to my own sense of right can avert 
the storm you speak of, it must burst ; 
for never will I purchase temporary safety 
by the voluntary forfeiture of self-esteem. 
I may be oppressed, but never can I feel 

humbled, 



^36 THE DISCARDED SON. 

humbled, while I can lay my hand upon 
my heart, and say I merit not oppres- 
sion. 

^' I remain, my Lord, 

'' Your Lordship's 
'' Obedient servant, 
'^'^ Osmond Munro.*' 



Had a doubt lingered in the mind of 
Osmond of Lord O'Sinister's having some 
secret motive for wishins: to drive him 
from Naples, this letter would have re- 
moved it ; but what this motive could pos- 
sibly be, he was still at as great a loss as ever 
to conjecture. 

Finding, the more he reflected on his 
conduct, the more agitated he became, 
he endeavoured, as much as possible, to 
divert his thoughts from dwelling on it. 

He had dined, and was trying to amuse 
them by reading, when three rufhanly 
looking men, followed by Mactalla, pale 

with 



THE DIJ5CARDED SOX. 937 

with affright, abruptly entered his apart- 
ment, and striding up to the table, at 
which he was sitting, the foremost, in no 
very complacent accent, enquired whether 
his name was not Munro ? 

*" For if it be,'' he continued, '' we have 
an order to take vou to the dunoreons of the 
palace*.'' 

'' The dungeons of the palace !" re- 
peated Osmond, in a tone of surprise, and 
laying down his book ; '' and pray on what 
account ?" 

'' O, that you'll hear when you get 
there; all we have to do is to lodge you 
there in safety, which to a certainty we 
shall, if your name be Munro." 

'' It is," said Osmond, impressively. 

" No such thing â€” no such thing," cried 
Mactalla, coming forward; ''by the Powers 
if you lay a finger on him," glancing at the

tions. 

ruffians 



238 THE DISCARDED SON, 

ruffians \vith a countenance as crimsoned 
with passion as but a minute before it had 
been blanched by terror, '' you'll repent 
it the longest day you have to live ; for 
this is not Mr. Munro, this is Count Placen- 
tia." 

" Count Placentia V repeated one of the 
fellows, sneeringly. '' Why, didn't he tell 
us himself this instant that his name was 
Munro?'* 

*' Don't believe a word of it/' cried Mac- 
talla ; '' this is a common trick with him, 
when he wants to have a little fun/' 

'^ A little fun ! â€” By thelord then he'il find 
heilhave no fun for saying so now/'rejoin- 
cd the ruffian, '*^ since his having done so will 
to a certainty lay him in one of the cold 
damp dungeons of the palace, except some 
one better known than your worship can 
testify his being Count Placentia/' 

'"' My name, I repeat," said Osmond, 
impressively, '' is Munro/" 

" No such thino; â€” no such thino/' a^ain 
vociferated Mactalla, almost out of breath 

with 



THE DISCARDED SON". 239 

with fear and agitation, and endeavouring, 
as he spoke, to catch the eyes of his mas- 
ter, in order to give him what he intended 
should be a significant wink. 

'' Why, what stuff is this!*' with a fero- 
cious aspect, and in a surly tone, ex- 
claimed another of the ruffians: ^' do you 
think we shall believe you before the gen- 
tleman himself? â€” no,no, the Signor has ac- 
knowledged himself to be the man wx want, 
so to prison he must go/' 

So saying, he and one of his companions 
laid hold of Osmond, as if intendins; to 
drag him along. 

" My friends,'' cried Osmond, with calm- 
ness, and disengaging himself from their 
grasp, '' there is no occasion for violence. 
It is my intention to accompany you 
quietly." 

'' x'Vccompany them quietly !" repeated 
Mactalla, aghast; "" acco^mpany such a set 
of cut-throat looking dogs, without know- 
ing why or wherefore ! no, no, you must 
not think of such a thing; let me call up

the people of the house, and Til answer 
for it we'll soon put them to flight.'* 

'' No/* said Osmond, '' I insist upon 
your not attempting a thing of the kind/' 
(convinced;, in his own mind, of this being 
the storm with which Lord O'Sinister had 
threatened him, and unwilling on many 
accounts to give the least publicity to the 
affair. ) '' I insist on vour not mentioning 
what has happened. Remain here quietly 
this evening, and to-morrow let me see 
you." 

'' Come, come. Signer/' cried one of 
the ruffians, impatiently, '^ we can tarry 
no longer/' and again he stretched out 
his arm, as if intending to seize Os- 
mond's. 

" I am ready to attend you," replied Os- 
mond, eluding his grasp. 

They descended the stairs in silence, and 
without encountering any one. One of 
the men led the way, and Osmond walked 
between the other two, followed by Mac- 
talla, wh'> could not be prevented attending 

his 



THE DISCARDED SON. 94 I 

his Steps, to see where they would take 
him ; lamenting all the way their ever 
having quitted the Castle of Acerenza, the 
good Marchesa Morati, the kind Count 
Placentia. 

'' O if they knew what was passing here,** 
cried he, '' to be sure they wouldn't order 
out the travelling equipage immediately ; 
but no matter â€” no matter, by blessed St. 
Benedict, if things don't soon take a turn, 
they shall shortly hear from me." 

On arriving at the prison, Osmond was 
delivered over to the keeper. Mactalla was 
following him into it, when the fellow, in 
a fierce voice, demanding what he wanted, 
occasioned him to pause. 

'' Nothing in the world," said Mactalla, 
in a gentle voice, trusting comj>}aisance 
might have a mollifying effect ; '' but 
only, like a dutiful servant, to be allowed 
to attend upon my good master here." 

" Your master must do without attend- 
ance now," cried the keeper, in a still 
more surly tone : and rudely pushing him 

TOL. IV. M into 



242 THE DISCARDED SON. 

into the street, he slapped the pionderous 
door in his face. 

Osmond was immediately after conduct- 
ed to a dungeon, which, judging from the 
number of sleps he descended to it, he 
concluded to be sunk far below the surface 
of the earth. As soon as he had entered 
it, the man who conducted him made a 
Tnovement towards the door with the lamp, 
as if intending to leave him to all the hor- 
rors of darkness. 

" May I not have a light?'* asked Os- 
mond, in an agitated voice. 

'^ Why as you are not a malefactor, you 
may be indulged with one," grumbled out 
the man, ''and with a clean truss of straw, 
provided you can pay for it." 

Osmond drew out his purse ; the Tiian 
set down the lamp, and withdrew. In a 
few minutes he returned with the straw, 
which he spread upon a long broad bench, 
in a corner of the dungeon. While thus 
employed, Osmond, although he had 
scarce a doubt upon his mind of having 

been 



THE DTSCARDEO SON. 245 

been arrested at the suit of Lord O'Sinister, 
for the debt of three hundred pounds 
which he had contracted to his Lordship iri 
England, was induced, bv a hope of being 
able to learn something of the further inten- 
tions of his Lordship, to enquire whether 
he knew the cause of his imprisonment? 

â€¢"^ Why yes/' returned the man, '"'tis 
Qwing to a countryman of your own, a no- 
bleman I think they style him." 

*' Can you inform me whether he has 
given any particular instructions respecting 
me ?'* asked Osmond. 

'^ I can give you no information on the 
subject," replied the man, surlily, "because 
*tis not my business to tattle. His lawyer, I 
daresay, will be with von to-morrow, and 
then perhaps heil gratify your curiosity." 

Hj^ then, having received the money he 
demanded for what he termed his civility, 
withdrew for the night, carefully barricad- 
ing the door after him. 

On being left to himself, Osmond took 

up the lamp, to examine the dreary cham- 

M 2 bci. 



244 THE DISCARDED S^K. 

ber, of which he had so unexpectedly be- 
come the inmate. He found it damp and 
miserable in the extreme ; nor could he, 
though he elevated the lamp high above 
his headj discover either grating or aper- 
ture, through which the light of day could 
gain admission to it. 

'^ In vain/' sighed he, despondently, as 
he replaced the lamp on the rugged floor, 
*^ in vain does the sun arise for the inhabi- 
tants of these wretched cells; in vain for 
them the breath of heaven diffiise health 
and sweetness round ; no cheering beam, 
no renovating gale find entrance here; and 
to aggravate the horror of the circum- 
stance, *tis man, cruel and unfeeling man, 
that excludes the precious blessings â€” he 
who for his kindred being, at least, should 
feel some touch of pity.'* â€¢ 

That Lord O'Sinister would have acted 
as in the present instance, would have had 
the inhumanity, the illiberality to arrest 
him for a debt, which it might fairly be 
said he had forced upon him^ Osnrond's 

conduct. 



THK^ r)TSGv\RDED SON. 245 

coiuluct, in taking no precaution for his 
safety, notwithstanding the threatening let- 
ter of his Lordship, fully proved his having 
no apprehension. 

That he had given instructions to have 
his confinement rendered as grievous as 
possible to him^ under the idea^ that in 
proportion to its horrors would be his ea- 
gerness to accede to any terms that should 
release him from it^ Osmond entertained 
no doubt. 

'' But he will find himself mistaken/' 
cried he, with an exulting smile, and a 
cheek glowing at the thoughts of an anti- 
cipated triumph, as with agitated steps he 
paced his cell; '' mistaken, in imagining 
coercive measures would ever bend me to 
his purpose ; triat for personal freedom I 
would ever submit to mental bondage â€” â–  
submit to be a slave rather. than a prisoner I 
Â« â€” no^ equal to his malice shall he find my 
courage ; his siiafts may pierce, but they 
shall not subdue my spirit.*' 

But transient was the satisfaction, th^ 
m3 pleasure 



246 THE DISCARDED SON. 

pleasure which Osmond derived from the 
thoughts ofdisappointing the malice, of re- 
sisting the tyranny of hispersecutor: should 
he find him inexorable^ determined to re- 
fuse him his liberty, except he acquiesced 
in his wishes, what then, he suddenly re-' 
ficctcd, would become of him! 

*' But noj no, ^tis impossible I should 
find him so," he cried;, starting, and re- 
covering a little from the shuddering and 
sickening emotion this agonizing idea had 
given birth to ; " impossible, except he 
is utterly devoid of sincerity, for he can- 
not regard the father and sacrifice the son; 
when he finds that I am not to be prevailed 
on to do what he requires, he will doubtless 
set me free. 

^' But, good Heavens! what may not 
dccur in the interim,'V thought Osmond, 
striking his forehead, almost distracted 
at the idea, "while he is endeavouring to 
accomplish his views : the Duke D'Amalfi 
may send for me; Mrs. Raymond may con- 
trive to give me some intimation of her 

abode.

libcde, tind with both perhaps I may be 
ruined for ever^ by not being able to wait 
upon them immediately. 

'' Stippose I write to the tyrant/' cried 
he, after mitsing* a few minutes, *' a calm 
and expostulatory letter, representing the 
Uselegsness of detaining me here, as my re- 
solution i^ not to be shaken, and calling 
upon him, by the regard he entertains for

%vhich can alone enable me to discharge my 
peeuniary obligations to him ; but no," 
he suddenly and passionately exclaimed, 
'^ noâ€” perish the idea of supplicating him 
whomldespisej of asking a favour from him, 
who can no longer inspire me with grati- 
tude. Patiently and quietly I will, I am 
determined, await his decision.** 

But patiently and quietly he could not 
think of the consequences this decision 
must lead to, should it be unfavour- 
able.

would speedily open his prison gates^ now 
despairing of their ever being unbarred, 
except he complied with the wishes of his 
Lordship^ which he solemnly vowed nevei* 
to do ; now dwelling with that agonizing 
fondness on the idea of his native home, the 
beloved connexions he feared he was for 
ever separated from, which the heart of 
feeling never fails of experiencing for the 
home and the friends it despairs of again, 
beholding ; now on that of the fair Corde- 
lia, who, like a bright vision, had sudden-

the same effect upon hlm^ the clanking 
of chains, the groan of captivity, the 
long-drawn and piercing shriek of de- 
spair. 

"Oh God!'' he cried, with uplifted 
hands, while the pangs of shuddering hu- 
manityj of agonized sensibility, bedewed 
his forehead with a cold perspiration, " if 
destined to remain in this situation, shut 
up my senses, that I may not hear the cry 
of distress I cannot alleviate, that so I 
may be spared the misery of knowing 
there are others as wretched as myself." 

He again courted sleep, and at length it 
weighed down his eyelids; but frightful and 
unconnected dreams prevented its afford- 
ing him ren^eshraent. On awaking, he was 
somewhat surprised, by finding Mactalla 
beside him v/eeping, at beholding him iii: 
so deplorable a situation. 

The poor fellow, whom inquietude and 

concern about his master had prevented 

(dosing his eyes all night, and whom the 

iirst glimpse of day had found at the pri-

390 *rHB DrSCAPvDED SON, 

son-door, had fought a hard battle to get 
-admittance to him. First he coaxed, as he 
called it â€” but to use his own words, might 
as well have whistled; then he scolded â€” but 
this only got him some hard knocks from 
the guards. At last he hit the right nail 
on the head, as he chose to express it j 
for enquiring for the keeper, he took him 
aside, and putting into his hand a purse^ 
not badly filled, immediately obtained from 
him the indulgence he required, 

Osmond, as he arose from his hard 
couch, thanked him for the anxiety he ma- 
nifested about him. 

*' Thank me[ â€” thank me!'* cried Mac- 
talla, scarce able to suppress the tears that 
again started to his eyes, *' for only doing 
my duty ; but did you sleep?" he conti- 
nued, in an anxious tone, and looking al- 
ternately at the straw, and the heavy eyes^ 
of his master; '^ no, not a wink, I dare 
say ; how should you indeed in such a 
place! O, the barbarians! to thrust any 
Christian into such a hole^ so damp, and so 

blacky

black, and so filthy. â€” Ah, this is not the 
way they treat prisoners in poor oiild Ire- 
land ; there they let them walk about, as a 
body may say, at their liberty; but â€” but 
don't you think one can get some redress 
for this bad usage ?'* 

" I don't know; I believe so," replied 
Osmond, scarcely conscious of what he was 
saying, so disturbed, so bewildered was he 
by his situation. 

" To be sure they can,'* said Mactalla, 
receiving from himself the answer he wish- 
ed for. " I mean to call directly upon the 
Duke D'Amalfi, who Iknow very well, hav- 
ing often seen him at Acerenza, and been 
noticed there by him- â€” and a condescend- 
ing agreeable nobleman he is, as any in 
this kingdom or the next to it â€” and explain 
the whole affair in a handsome gentleman- 
like manner to him; upon which I have no 
doubt he'll instantR say to meâ€” Mr. Mac-

a countryman of his/' 

" How/' cried Osmond, starting, and in 
an accent expressive of astonishment, "do 
you then know the cause of my confine- 
ment?" 

" Do I ! â€” do you think I could have 
Tested without learning it? â€” no, no; 
something struck me that it was owing to 
that blackguard of a Lord in the Largo 
Castillo. He a Lord ! â€” by the Powers Td 
be ashamed to be called a Lord, after hear- 
ing of such conduct in one; so to put my- 
self out of all doubt on the matter, away I 
posted from the prison last night to his 
house, and sure enough found 1 was not 
Eiistaken/' 

" And prav," demanded Osmond, in a col- 
lected tone, and with a keenly scrutinizing 
glance, 'Mvhat cause had yoa for suspect- 
ing Lord O^Sinister of enmity towards, 
me?'* 

Mactiilla looked a little confused at this 

question^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 9S^- 

(question, ^vhich Osmond perceiving, he 
pressed it still more home upon him ; 
and;, at lengthy, received an explicit an- 
swer. 

''Well/* rejoined Osmond, '' I must in- 
sist on your not commenting to any- 
one on his Lordship's conduct towards 
nie.'* 

'' To be surâ‚¬/' returned Mactalla ; '' as 
long as you have your hand in the lion'3 
mouth, one must be quiet and easy; but as^ 
soon as it is drawn put, \Avf then I hope 
one may have the pleasure of speaking 
their mind freely. But this is losing time ; 
I'll fly to the Duke D'Amalfi directly, bor- 
row the monev we want, pay off this dis- 
grace to our country, get a receipt in full 
of all demands, and then by the Powers 
you must give him a good big thrashing;, 
and I'll stand by to see that no one inter 
rupts you." 

''Hold!*' exclaimed Osmond, catching 
him by the arm, as he was hastening from 
the dungeon ; '' at your peril I charge you 

not

not to go to the Dnke D'Amalfi ; I would 
rather perish in this dungeon than be guilty 
of the indelicacy of soliciting such a favour 
from him as you allude you." 

*' Then pray/' said Mactalla, with evi- 
dently forced calmness, and looking ear- 
nestly in his face, "^ how do you propose- 
settling this affair?" 

This was a question which Osmond was 
not prepared to answer â€” a question which 
he had not yet ventured to put to himself, 
and which now gave rise to emotions that 
caused him to turn with quickness from 
Mactalla, and again pace the cell with agi- 
tated steps. 

'*^ I say, Signor/* resumed Mactalla, fol- 
lowing him, '' if you disdain owing an ob- 
ligation to his Excellency, how, in the 
name of Heaven, do you expect to get out 
of this frightful place, or be revenged* 
upon the old blackguard that put you into 
it?" 

"No matterâ€” no matter," cried Osmond; 
impatiently, and still endeavouring \o 

avoid

avoid his eyes, by again turning from him; 
^' this is his hour/* added he^ scarcely con- 
scious of what he was saying, "" mine is yet 
to come/' 

" That's as much as to say/' cried Mac- 
talla, " that cats may mew, and dogs will 
have their day : by St. Benedict but you 
couldn't have said any thing more to 
the purpose ; but^ Signor^ let me implore 
you " 

Here the entrance of the keeper, to an- 
nounce Lord O'Sinister's lawyer, inter- 
rupted him^ and this gentleman express- 
ing a v/ish to be left alone with Osmond^ 
he was ordered to retire, which he accord- 
ingly did, but with a very bad grace, and 
not without a suspicious glance at the pro- 
fessional man. 

'' Well, young man," began the lawyer, 
as soon as he found himself alone with 
Osmond, '' lam come hither by the com- 
mand of Lord O'Sinister, to inform you, 
that notwithstanding the ingratitude, inso- 
lence, and baseness of your conduct to-

" Never,*' cried Osmond, resolutely} and 
indignantly, *^' never; the liberty of which, 
his Lordship has deprived me is not half so 
estimable in my eyes, as that of which he 
seeks to rob me â€” the liberty of acting 
agreeably to the dictates of my reason.'' 

*^ Your reason !" repeated the lawver,^ 
with a supercilious smile; '' take my advice^ 
and let prudence dictate to you in the pre- 
sent instance.'^ 

'' You already know my determination^ 
Sir/' said Osmond, haughtily ; '' it were 
superfluous, therefore, to repeat it." 

*^ Then pray may I enquire how you 
hope to be liberated ? for Lord O'Sinister 
desired me to tell you he is positively de-

y.ou comply with his wishes, till you have 
discharged your bond to him for three hun-

'' Fairly and candidly/' replied Osmond^ 
" then, I inform you, that I behold no 
prospect whatever of being able to liquid 
date my debt to his Lordship but by instal- 
mentSj nor any chance of this prospect 
being realized^, but by my immediate resto-. 
ration to liberty. I have been recom- 
mended to the patronage of one of the 
most distinguished characters here, as his 
Lordship knows; but can derive no advan- 
tage from the circumstance, if he keeps me 
in confinement.'' 

" Well, I shall faithfully report what you 
have said to his Lordship, but apprise you 
in time, that I have not the least idea of 
his liberating you, on any other condition 
than your consenting ta quit Naples imme-

Osmond

Osmond was prevented reflecting on the 
strange conduct of his valet, by the number 
of lawyers that successively visited him^ to 
offer their services, in endeavouring ta 
arrange the affair that caused his imprison- 
mentâ€”services which he peremptorily re- 
jected, from a thorough conviction of 
their proving of no avail; and, at length, 
teazed and wearied by their intrusion, 
gave orders that another should not be 
admitted to him, 

^' Scarcely had he issued these orders^ 
when, to his great surprise, the Duke 
D*Angourmoise, a French emigrant noble- 
man, with whom he had formed an ac- 
quaintance at one of the public rooms> 
vas introduced. His Grace entered with a 
countenance overshadowed with gloom ^ 
and in the most lively terms, expressed the 
tegret he flelt at seeing Osmond in- such a 
deplorable situation â€” a regret, he protest- 
ed, heightened almost beyond endurance 
by his inability to rescue him from it. 

Osmond, penetrated and affected by such 

kindness 



^60 TflE DISCARDED SON. 

kindness in a stranger^ could scarcely give 
utterance to the feelings it excited â€” feel- 
ings which rendered him quite forget ful^ 
at the momentj of his having given himself 
some little claim to the attention and re- 
gard of his Grace, by having obliged him 
a few evenings back, with rather a consi- 
derable sum of money, inconsequence of 
his dropping a hint, inadvertently it ap- 
peared, of his being extremely embarrassed 
and distressed, owing to his not receiTing 
z remittance he had for some time been, 
expecting from France. 
â–  As soon as his emotion had subsided, he 
begged to know by what means his Grace 
bad discovered bis being in confinement ? 

The Duke looked a little confused at this 
question, but quickly recovering himself^ 
said he had seen him erttering the prison; 
*' into which,'' added he, ''I should have had 
no hesitation in instantly following you, 
for the purpose of enquiring whether I 
could have been of any service to you^ 
but for the lateness of the hour. Friend- 
ship 



THE DISCARDED SON. 901 

ihip has now brought me hither; if, there- 
fore, I can be of any use to you, point out 
the way, I implore you, and my zeal in 
your cause shall prove the alacrity and plea- 
sure with which I undertake it.'* 

Osmond thanked him most sincerely for 
his readiness to serve him ; but in the pre- 
sent instance, said he much feared it would 
not be in his power. He then, apprehen- 
sive if silent concerning the cause of his 
imprisonment, his Grace, whose esteem he 
was anxious to retain, from the high opi- 
nion he had conceived of him, might im- 
pute it to some dishonourable transaction, 
revealed the occasion of, but with an in- 
junction to secrecy ; for though he could 
no lousier consider Lord O'Sinister as his 
friend, he could not forget that he had been, 
as he imagined, the friend of his family, 
and on that account was unwilling to ex- 
pose him to censure. 

" Ungenerous and illiberal indeed,*' ex- 
claimed the Duke, on Osmond's concluding 
his unvarnished talCj as if fired with indig- ^ 
3 nation

nation at the injurious treatment he had ex- 
perienced â€” '' By Heavens, this tyrant Lord 
deserves to be called to a severe account for 
his conduct to you.** 

'' And doubtless he will/' rejoined Os- 
mond ; " the heart, my dear Duke, seldom 
lets a cruel or ignoble action pass with im- 
punity.** 

'' Perhaps not,** returned his Grace ; '' but 
I must confess the punishment it may inflict 
w^ouldbe quite too slow and secret to satisfy 
my vengeance, were I injured; but should 
his Lordship shew a still stronger disposi- 
tion than he has already done, to remain 
inexorable, shall I wait on him in your be* 
half?** 

*' I scarcely think,** said Osmond, with a 
heavy sigh, '' I shall be able to prevail on 
myself to make an overture to him; but 
should I, I shall most undoubtedly be happy 
to avail myself of your Grace*s kind offer.** 

He then invited his Grace to partake of 
his breakfast, which had hitherto remained 
untouched ; and while taking it, mentioned 

the 



THE DiSCARDED SOK. 263 

the number of lawyers that had called upon 
kirn. 

The Duke laughed at the recital. â€” '' Ex- 
cuse my mirth/' said he, '' but the asto- 
nishment you expressed at the number of 
lawyers that oliered their ser\ices to you 
occasioned it, by bringing to my mind an 
anerdoie oi Pope Innocent the Eleventh, 
and the Marquis Carpio. The latter being 
desu'ed bv the 'ormer to furnisn him with 
thirty thousand herd of swine, informed 
him that he could not possibly spare his 
swine; but it his Holiness required thirty 
thousand ^awyers, such a number was very 
much at his service However," continued 
his Grace, '' notwithstanding their num- 
bers, they all contrive to get a living, 
the disposition of the Neapolitans being 
naturally hery and litigious, insomuch that 
there are very few persons o? distinction 
who have not a cause depending : for when 
a Neapolitan cavalier has nothing else to 
do, he very gravely shuts himself up in his 
closet, and tumbles over his papers, to seÂ« 

whether

%vhether he cannot start a lawsuit, and con- 
sequently plague any of his neighbours." 

'' How greatly does this propensity to 
litigation prove them altered since the time 
ofStatius/' observed Osmond, "at least if 
they then merited hiseulogium on them â€” 

" By love of right, and native justice led, 
In the straight paths of equity they tread ; 
Nor know the bar, nor fear the judge's frown. 
Unpractised ia the wranglings of the gown."

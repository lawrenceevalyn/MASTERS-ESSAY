tenderpst vows sealed the chaste interviews ef bliss: time, asin lhe spell-boiiiíd regioni of enchantment, wore rapidly away ; na- ! ture 's glowing affection transported me into ' an ideal Elysium, and tinged every feeling, | every respiration, every effusion of soul, I with the energy of delight : now the ghost - oflost felicity haunts me, subdues the boast I of reason, scoffs at patience, at ι esignation, 1 at hope, and colours every sigh with deso- \ lation every thought with anguish." Such were Ins reflections, as he pursued the rapid course of the Metrcmo, as he ga7cd on ils gurgling eddies, and watched waves, vvhich, frotr time immemoiial, had , rolled unsubdued—waves once swelled by the ensanguined »treain of slaughter, once ·- strewed vvilh the bodies of unheeded slain, 1 once, and for ever, stamped upon the page * of history, in recording the defeat of As- } drubal, the tnumph of Claudius Nero, and ! Livius Salinator. Such are the passions of ]man, defying controul, turbulent and un- - t governable,
governable riding as the air blown bubble, in proud triumph on the wave of tune, broken by the fust straw of contention, and swallowed in the vorlex of eternity As Di Rinaldini approached the castle, an inward sensation seemed to reproach the hopeless picture he had sketched for as he looked up he beheld the youthful Isidore, bending like the genius of inspi¬ ration over the side of the rampart Ihe light elegance of his form the Panali whiteness of his forehead the waving pro¬ fusion of his ebon hair the speaking ia diancc of his animated eyes but above all Ле hectic glow which seemed the sponta neon effusion of newly awakened enthu siasm gaie to his featuies α char η the most alluring to his st ilion an appeaiance the most picturesque " And for me thought Huberto as softly he stole beieath the ıampart for mc are the active scenes of life re ignee! , for
for me ıs Isidore content to waste the warm energies of his mind in a solitude so ob- scine Friendship, great sovereign balm to affliction's power, heneefoi th I hail thee ; heneeforlh shalt thou diy the tear of re¬ membrance, shalt thou chase the soriows of ill-fated love " Again he looked up, for his soundless sleps, a lightly he pressed the grassy her¬ bage, attracted not the attention of the youth, siili gracefully recumbent, beseem¬ ed to float on ideal visions, he seemed lost in the exubcianee of fancy, alive only to the impulse ol sentiment. " If, like thee," thought our hero, as he traced a hand of snowy whiteness, pulling backa raven ringlet—" il like thee, ah ' suiely llemelfncle ments лп undivided heart " Doubtful was the sigh which succeeded ; whether it was the involuntary swell of tenderness,
«endeiness, we cannot determine; tuie it ıs, that he gaz«d upon the pilgrim, with an earnestness, an admiration not to be con- iroled , that the verdant besudes of erea- *ion were disregarded , that the past and Ihe future were alike effaced from memorv " V hy is the bliss of otheis the banc of iný existence ? ' articulated Isidore (Hu¬ berto scarcely breathed ) "Vthv merciful ľiovidence' am I doomed to wander through this gloomy worl the 'live of passion, ihe victim of g-ieff why are the ehám s of happiness denied my youth i why the sympathies of affection my ardour? whv like yon cv press wh» h bends to the breeze, why cannot I yield to the ordina¬ tion of Heaven ' Oh ' sainted Luscbia pro phetic friend' γοιι analı zed the feelings of my heart, y oil foreboded its do am—soi¬ row Rich in the imagined secret, Di Rinaldi¬ ni flew towards the drawbridge, he paused 3 not
not till he ìeached the rampart, til! he reached lhe side of the pilgrim —" Not all the eneigies of life are blasted," he ex claimed " Isidore, this day has the mists ofdespair vanished , this day h.s the cordial wirmthof fiiendship darted into my bosom has it whispered future peice Couit vou tbe beai en-born guest Let our comfort flow from the sane soinee Tnendship fills the aching void in my heart be your's as flexible ' A half-suppressed siniek burst from the lipsnflhevonih , hetottered hetrerrbled, the bloom fled his cheek, tears started to his eyes " Am I lo my unexpected approach to attribute this agitation ?

' " Ah' is it you who ask mc ? ' Huberto shuddered The youth snatihed his hand , he saw he had thrilled Ihe choid of woe, and, with a bitlet smile, he con- eluded— Solitude is an indulgence the пньсиЫс will court " In an instant dissolved the shadowy fabnc Huberto had elected peaee was creished in the dissolution He looked I vards the chapel where mouldered the foi m ot Adel¬ heida, and fell that fiieni'bhip could not silence every warring passion ol the soul, for there is «' λη avari« ir ßrirf , And the wan eye ol seirrow loves to gate U| on its secret hoard ot treasui d noes, In ο ι ing sol iude.

Often there with gloomy eagerness, had he reused the days of happier years, often there with a miser s caution had he re¬ traced the fleeting hours of bliss "My study wis melancholy, pursued Isidore unconscious of the encreased de jeetion of his friend — I was marking the pro„ressof time since the dawn of memory I was contrasting the bitterness of orphaned infancy to the sweet the endearing solu ι tude of parental tenderness I «as thinking had Heaven vouchsafed ine a mother my sharpest th oes of anguish h id been spared How strong flow dear how impulsive are the ties ot Nature what а ihimdoesshc fenge lo unne the claims of con an^uinity ' \hs tint chain evtemls not to mc I am out ofthe ıeach of us inducili e llıe irei tuie of illusion I stind asunen jlone in the cie mon Mone и Irnupted Di lìinaldmi I speak of filnl t Ums filten t bi¬ lime n Ч " \ d

Musing on the incident of 'he preceding night, on the conclusions of the pilgrim, and on his own conviction of treacheiy, trembling for the safety of his friend, and anxious to devise some melhod to aveit the thieatened aim of vengeance, he rested his hopes on the known experience, the tned affection the genuine profes ions of the canon, and resolved at once to un bosom his peiplexities, ind implor- hn counsel Γιοηι the eaihcst years of childhood, in the орешпд dawn of reason, in the gra¬ dual e\pansion of u telle ct, his had been the fostering hand which had checked the exuberance of passion, had pruned the shoots of knowledge where had been the difficulty wl ich he had not lightened, where the borrow m win h he had not sympa thized?

who had thus relinquished cveiy pursuit, had thus snapped the ties of kindred and when Huberto warm m the praises of his youthful guest, repaired to his cell, with painful admiration, with eager tendcincss, lie would listen to recitals of mysterious import, sometimes condemning the per¬ severing silene e of Isidore, sometimes pity¬ ing his sorrows, and sometimes almost doubting whether the stiength of e isini re gard could pioduce an attachment so fen ent He had just retuined from his morning ь dev olion had just regained lhe loved i e tırcment of his cell when the appearance- of Di Rinaldini put to flight the senous expression of his countenance, and lighted il ι ρ with the smile of welcome — ' Bless you mvson 1 ' he articulated, as he received lnm to his embiare— But wherefore, ' loolmf attentively In his face, " do I see vre tluioc-rly? hpeak, my esteemed young fuend, su ely my fears misgive me, or your look»

CHAPTER I. 



u Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow/' 

ARRIVED in Fleet-street, joyful were 
the greetings between the happy parents 
and their daughters, who were watching 
for them in the shop. Emily could almost 
have been affected by them, from the re- 
collections they awakened, but that she 
conceived it would have been a lessening 
of her dignity â€” a severing of the line she 
wished to draw between them, to suffer 
herself to be in anywise moved or inter- 
ested by beings of so different a descrip- 
tion to herself. Accordingly, dashing a- 
way the tear, that, starting from the foun- 

VOL. III. B

tain of a heart truer to the feelings of na- 
ture than she was yet aware of, hung 
trembling on her dark eyelash, she coldly 
bowed to the kind salutations of the Misses 
Tibbs on her introduction to them, and 
silently permitted herself to be shewn in- 
to the parlour, where the tea equipage was 
already laid against the arrival of the tra- 
vellers ; and any other refreshment being 
decEaed by them, Miss Tibbs immediate- 
ly commenced making tea. 

A great many mutual inquiries having 
passed between the mother and daughters, 
the former proceeded to mention this be- 
ing Miss St. Orme's first wisit to Lunnon, 
and that she would probably stay a little 
while with them â€” " So, girls," she cried, 
" you must stir about a bit, and let her see 
a little of the town while she is with us." 

"Laws, to be sure!" exclaimed Miss 
Susy, the younger sister, in an accent of 
delight; " it will give us all the pleasure 
in life, I'm sure, to go about with her." 

" The Halls have been wanting us this 
some time to make a party for the Co- 



bourg with them," said Miss Tibbs; "sup- 
pose we were soon to do so ? There will 
be a benefit to-morrow night, and a vari- 
ety of entertainments." 

" Then what's to hinder our going, 
dear ?" said the fond mother ; " and let us 
ask the Halls to take a bit of dinner with 
us, for 'tis a long way from Horsleydown, 
and they might like to rest themselves be- 
fore going to the theatre: and old Gimp 
too, and the three girls, and the two lads, 
for we owe them a dinner a long time; 
and the more the merrier, say I." 

* And not forgetting young Spriggins 
and Mr. Villers," added Miss Susy ; " as 
to his mother, she never goes to a play- 
house, so there's no use in asking her." 

Mrs. Tibbs nodded assent to whatever 
was suggested; and Miss Susy, starting 
up, said she would write invitations to the 
respective parties directly. 

" And I think," cried her sister, " we 
could contrive to shew Miss, to-morrow, 
Mrs. Salmon's Wax-work, and the Tower, 
b 2 



at least â€” that is, if pa can spare Nat," a 
young kinsman, who acted as foreman, 
and was her accepted suitor. 

" Why not?" rejoined her mother; " to 
be sure he can ; but, harkee ! don't you be 
going beforehand," and she laughed im- 
moderately, " to tell Miss of St. Dunstan's 
clock." 

" Lauk, no! I shouldn't think of that 
â€” 'tis so funny to see the surprise of a per- 
son who knows nothing about it." 

While these plans were arranging for 
her amusement, Emily sat as silent, and 
nearly as motionless, though perhaps not 
quite as smiling, as Patience on a monu- 
ment, incensed as she was at the vulgar 
presumption of these plebeians, in forming 
any thing of the kind for her ; and their 
stupidity in not at once perceiving the 
difference there was between her and 
them. 

Mrs. Tibbs, mistaking the silence of 
contempt and irritation for low spirits, 
owing to finding herself in a strange place, 
said all she thought likely to cheer and 



enliven her, observing, as soon as she be- 
gan to look about her, she would find her- 
self quite different. 

" To be sure she will," said Miss Susy, 
having finished her notes ; " and I am 
thinking we can't do less than take Miss 
to see the Hopera House; and then we 
must make a party for the Little Theatre, 
and Sadler's Wells, and the Surrey, and 
Astley's." 

" And some Sunday we'll take a coach, 
and go to the Regent's Park â€” it is so 
pretty, Xat says, with the water, and the 
bridges, and Primrose Hill in view." 

" To be sure we will," still assented the 
happy mother; " but, girls, -what's in the 
house for supper? I want to know what 
kind of housekeepers you've been ; be- 
sides, Miss did not eat one morsel of din- 
ner." 

" Why, there's a cold fowl, and ham, 
and mutton, and salad, and cucumbers." 

" Well, that'll do, with the prawns I 
brought up from Worthing ; so let's have it 



6 

presently, dears; for what with getting tip 
so early, and travelling so many miles, I 
doubt I shall soon be getting sleepy." 

What the old lady only feared, Emily 
determined to affect, in order to have a 
pretext for quickly withdrawing, deter- 
mined, whilst she remained with them, to 
keep herself as aloof as possible from the 
family. Accordingly, resisting the en- 
treaties that were made use of to induce 
her stopping supper, she was shewn to a 
bedchamber, where she was left to herself. 
There she sat long in meditation : abso- 
lutely horrified by the idea of the associa- 
tions with which she was threatened, she 
thought she might venture on the certain- 
ty of soon hearing from Mr. Elmore, to 
change her abode without further delay. 
The plan was no sooner formed than de- 
cided on ; and, in consequence, she made 
no objection, as would otherwise have 
been the case, to going out the next morn- 
ing, after breakfast, with the Misses Tibbs, 
conceiving, from her ignorance of the 



7 

town, there was a chance, in the course of 
her perambulations with them, of lighting 
en what she wished. 

She soon, however, detected the error 
she was in, in imagining such a thing â€” 
soon saw that to look for an elegant board- 
ing-house in the crowded streets and dirty- 
lanes through which they took her, was 
ridiculous, and accordingly felt not a 
little provoked with herself, for having 
consented to be dragged about. 

With all her discomposure, however, 
when she actually found herself at the 
Tower, she could not help feeling grati- 
fied, so interesting was the view of this 
old pile. Here, in the actual scene of the 
sufferings of those for whom the tear of 
gentle pity had so oft been shed, and where 
their pale attenuated forms seemed to glide 
in melancholy stillness before her, she could 
have liked to have lingered a little while ; 
but the Misses Tibbs, who had no parti- 
cipation in her feelings, eagerly hurried 
her on to view the curiosities of the place, 



8 

as impatient to be gone as they had been 
to enter. 

Vexed, fatigued, and disappointed, she 
returned to Fleet-street, with a positive 
determination against being one of the 
party in the evening to the Cobourg. Mrs. 
Tibbs was sitting at work in the shop, 
and, on her intimating this to her, uttered 
an exclamation of surprise. â€” " Why, lauk 
a mercy, Miss, you don't say so !" she 
cried; " w r hy, the party will be quite 
knocked up then !" 

" Pooh, pooh ! she doesn't mean what 
she says," cried the little grocer, who had 
resumed both his white apron and his sta- 
tion behind the counter; " she's fagged 
now ; but when she rests herself a bit, 
you'll see she'll change her mind. â€” But 
come, girls, let's hear what Miss saw â€” 
you didn't forget to shew her queen Bess 
and her page â€” no, sure ! nor the kings on 
horseback â€” nor the black tower, where 
the poor little princes were murdered?" 
" Now that's a good man, and don't be 



delaying the girls," interrupted his wife ; 
" for you see four o'clock is just on our 
backs, and there's no great time for 
dressing. â€” But, dear now, Miss," again 
turning to Emily, " I hope you'll change 
your mind, for if not, you'll be keeping 
us all at home." 

Emily was most haughtily unwilling to 
do this ; but, since compelled to remain a 
little longer under her roof, pride suggest- 
ed some immediate requital for the further 
obligation thus incurred; and accordingly 
she at length decided on the condescen- 
sion that was entreated. 

She had just finished changing her dress, 
when the two young ladies, bedizened at 
all points, entered her room, and testified 
no little surprise at seeing that she had 
merely exchanged one plain white dress for 
another. â€” " To be sure, Miss," said Miss 
Tibbs, after staring at her for a minute or 
two, " your dress is a very nice one; but 
to make it look a little dressy, I think 
you want a sash ; and if your things are 
B 3 



10 

not yet unpacked, I can lend you one, 
and a nice wreath for your hair." 

" I did not wish to make it look dressy, 
but quite the reverse," superciliously re- 
plied Emily. 

" Oh ! well, if that be the case, Miss," 
and urging her no further on the subject, 
they conducted her to the drawing-room, 
where, by this time, the expected guests 
were assembled â€” the females, like the 
Misses Tibbs, dressed in what they con- 
ceived the extreme of elegance, that is, 
with heads like pyramids crowned with 
flowers â€” tremendous pads, that, giving 
them a bend forward, made them look as 
if they had received an injury in the spine 
â€” and petticoats furbelowed up to their 
hips. 

To the horror of Emily, Mrs. Tibbs in- 
troduced her to the party. Abominable ! 
had she known she had an idea of the 
kind, she would have given her a hint on 
the subject ; however, it was no matter â€” 
she should soon be removed to a distinct 
sphere from them. 



11 

Dinner was shortly after announced. 
Emily found herself seated at table be- 
tween Mr. Spriggins, a pert young attor- 
ney, and Mr. Hall, a boat-builder at Hors- 
leydown ; and exactly opposite a Mr. Vil- 
lers, who had been previously mentioned 
as an eminent sugar-boiler to her â€” an in- 
timation that had, till now, prevented her 
doing more than glancing at him ; but 
now that she could not avoid noticing 
him, she could not help secretly acknow- 
ledging he would not have been unwor- 
thy of a higher rank. He was about nine- 
and-twenty, tall, finely proportioned, his fea- 
tures remarkably handsome, and his coun- 
tenance all intelligence. Emily felt herself 
blush on his suddenly catching her look- 
ing at him ; yet why should she blush ? it 
was merely owing to the accidental cir- 
cumstance of his sitting so exactly opposite 
to her, that she was doing so : his so ear- 
nestly regarding her, as he did, might be, 
and probably was, owing to a very diffe- 
rent cause. Be that as it may, however, 
there is not a doubt, that had those dark 



12 

expressive eyes belonged to a person of 
different rank, the intenseness of their 
gaze would have occasioned some little 
flutter in her heart; as it was, she could 
not exactly frown at it, but she put up 
her lip, and affected a thousand pretty airs 
of disdain. 

That her rank had been ostentatiously 
announced to the party previous to her 
entrance, she had no doubt; the know- 
ledge of it, however, seemed to have cre- 
ated no embarrassment, especially in Mr. 
Villers; he appeared perfectly cool and 
collected ; indeed, had his station justified 
the idea, she would have thought his man- 
ner rather proud and reserved ; but as it 
was, it would have been absurd to think 
so â€” a trader, a sugar-boiler, proud and re- 
served ! oh no ! that would be ridiculous 
indeed ! Yet had she been romantic or 
extravagant in her notions, she certainly 
would have said he looked amongst the 
present party " like a descended god ;" 
and, could she have divested herself of 
prejudice, would have acknowledged there 



IS 

was a great deal of striking elegance and 
perspicuousness in his address, and what- 
ever observations he made. 

In the course of the dinner he asked 
her to take wine. Ere she could reply, 
Mr. Hall, with a loud laugh, exclaimed 
â€” " Port, if you please, sir f and then 
turning to Emily, asked her if it was 
not so? â€” " For my friend, Mrs. Tibbs, 
says you are Irish, Miss," he cried, 
" and my cousin, Dick Brewer, who was 
over in Ireland for some time, told me, 
that whenever a gentleman there looks as 
if he were going to ask a lady to take 
wine with b\-n, she always calls out, be- 
fore he can speak, ' Port, if you please, 
sir." 

" It may be so, sir," said Emily, dis- 
dainfully shrinking back, " but not to 
my knowledge; but travellers tell strange 
tales." 

" So they do, ma'am," assented Mr. 
Spriggins ; " if we swallowed all they re- 
late, we should have no occasion to strain 
at a camel, ha, ha ! should we, old boy ?" 



14 

slapping Mr. Tibbs on the shoulder, next 
to whom he sat. 

" Well, and why not port if you please?" 
cried Mrs. Tibbs ; " I always say port my- 
self, when I am asked to hob-nob. I hate 
all your swashy trash of made-wines â€” 
they do wastly well indeed, with a bit of 
cake, of an evening at a card-table, or to 
mix with a glass of water of a sultry day, 
if one is a-dry; but at dinner, port, if you 
please, sir," and she laughed, " is the wine 
for me." 

" Ah ha ! let the old lady alone for 
knowing a good thing," said her husband. 

" As the jockey said of the horse that 
couldn't leap," cried Spriggins, " let him 
alone for leaping." 

" Ha, ha !" laughed Mrs. Tibbs, in con- 
cert with some of her party, " you are 
such a funny man, Mr. Spriggins !" 

" Witty in myself, ma'am, and the cause 
of wit in others â€” is it not so, ma'am ? 
do you perceive?" addressing himself to 
Emily. 

" No, sir, I do not." 



15 

" Ha ! more meant by that than meets 
the ear â€” hem â€” Shakespeare. But though 
my friend Chesterfield, or some other ge- 
nius like him, observes that quoting of old 
proverbs is not exactly the thing, yet I 
must take leave to observe, that none are 
so blind as those who wont see." 

" Perhaps so, sir ; but some people are 
naturally stupid." 

" Oh dear no, ma'am ! in this case only 
insensible to merit. â€” But, bless my heart 
and soul, Miss Gimp !" as if fearful, if he 
paused a moment, of incurring the impu- 
tation of dullness, " what's the matter ? 
why you look as solemn as an owl in an 
ivy-bush." 

"La! I am sure I thank you for the 
compliment; but if I did look low and 
ill," and she sighed, and tried to look in- 
teresting, " I'm sure no wonder, after the 
fright I got to-day." 

" Stars and garters ! how was it ? Did 
the brindled cat mew thrice, or scratch â€” 
or the parrot bite â€” or the pug snap â€” or 
the milliner disappoint â€” or " 



16 

" Lord ! how you do run on, Mr Sprig- 
gins! ten knots an hour! If your tongue 
was a racehorse, there would be no dan- 
ger, I am sure, of your not being in first. 
But it wasn't nothing of them things 
you mentioned that frightened me so. 
My cousin Ed'ard coaxed me to go out in 
his tilbury with him to-day, and we hadn't 
w r ell got to the hend of the street, when 
the orse chose, as captain Wattle says, to 
make a retrograde movement, and backed, 
and backed, till I thought he would have 
got into the ouse through one of the win- 
dows ; and I did so scream !" 

" Oh ! we'll take your word for that." 

" And then there was such a kick-up ! 
my aunt taking his part, and my uncle 
that of the orse." 

" Ah ! sided with the wisest animal of 
the two, I make no doubt. But proceed 
â€” the idea of your danger is really quite 
affecting." 

" If you had been by, you would have 
thought so ; and then the piece of work 
that followed!" 



17 

" Ay, so I suppose, as the raven said 
to the cock when they fought in the Hay- 
market, quite a rig ! Was it not so, think 
you, old boy ?" again giving a slap to the 
grocer ; " you who can give a raison for 
every thing." 

" I'm sure he could readily, at all e- 
vents, give one for not wishing to have 
you sit by him again," observed one of 
the young Halls â€” " your being so very 
troublesome; but I suppose you like a 
friend you can make an impression on." 

" Very well indeed, Mr. Robert â€” your 
equivoque is vastly good! â€” What say you, 
ma'am ?" to Emily ; " you take him ?" 

" No, sir â€” I should be very sorry in- 
deed." 

" Ha ! that's very well of you too, 
ma'am, as my friend Ollapod says â€” I 
owe you one, good ma'am, for that. But 
'tis now time for me to inquire â€” pray, la- 
dies, what is to be the entertainment of 
the evening? are we to look for mirth, or, 
like Fag, to prepare for wo ?" 

" La, Mr. Spriggins !" exclaimed Miss 



18 

Tibbs, " don't you know well enough 
there's never nothing but what is merry 
and entertaining at these here minor the- 
atres?" 

" Oh, ay, true, and so much the better 
â€” I am quite a votary of Momus â€” delight 
in Laughter holding both his sides." 

" Well, now do, that's a good soul, 
finish your dinner, and God bless you !" 
cried Mrs. Tibbs, " for I want to give the 
ladies a dish of tea before their going to 
the theatre; and if you keep chattering in 
this here way, we sha'n't have no time for 
nothing of the kind." 

" A word to the wise â€” mute as a mac- 
kerel in a moment â€” wont open my lips 
again till the spirit," glancing at the side- 
board, " moves me." 

At length all was dispatched, and the 
party began to arrange for setting out. 
Having taken such pains in decorating 
themselves, Emily was surprised at seeing 
the young ladies putting on their large 
bonnets and shawls, till it was explained 
they were to walk, as the theatre was only 



19 

at the other side of Waterloo Bridge, and 
that they could leave their wraps, as they 
called them, at the entrance. 

In the way, Mr. Villers politely offered 
his arm to Emily, but she distantly re- 
fused it ; had they been more on an equa- 
lity, she might have been pleased with the 
attention, and glad of the support of such 
an arm ; but as it was, to rest on the arm 
of a tradesman, a sugar-boiler â€” Heavens ! 
she would never have got the better of the 
reflection â€” no, no, that would be quite 
too condescending indeed ! 

The first time of her entering what 
might be termed a regular theatre, she 
would have looked about her, and ques- 
tioned, and observed, and admired, had 
she yielded to her real feelings ; but 
to appear any way struck or pleased, by 
any thing she saw in company with such 
a party â€” to allow such plebeians to re- 
mark on her country ignorance â€” no, that 
would be too bad indeed ; and so merely 
casting a contemptuous glance round her, 
she seated herself, in haughty silence, as 



20 

far back in the box, and close to the side, 
as possible. 

A few minutes elapsed before all the 
party were seated to their satisfaction â€” 
much manoeuvring was practised to get 
Mr. Villers down amongst the other young 
ladies in the front, but he dextrously par- 
ried it all, and finally secured a place be- 
side Emily. She was pleased at this, but 
merely â€” yes, certainly, on no other ac- 
count than because she thought him more 
tolerable than any of the rest of the set ; 
and, as a proof of her indifference about 
it on any other account, she suffered a 
considerable time to elapse ere she per- 
mitted it to be known she was aware of 
who was sitting by her. At length some- 
thing irresistibly ludicrous on the stage 
so completely discomposed her affected 
gravity, that, in spite of her efforts to pre- 
vent it, she burst into a fit of laughter. 
After this, she could not immediately re- 
assume the previous stateliness of her man- 
ner, and, in consequence, some conver- 
sation ensued between her and the person 



21 

next to her. â€” " It is really too bad," she 
cried, as she endeavoured to recompose 
her features, " this laughing against one's 
judgment â€” one really feels provoked with 
oneself for such folly." 

" It is not folly, in my opinion, to al- 
low oneself to be innocently amused," said 
Mr. Villers ; " on the contrary, I should 
deem it rather the reverse of wisdom not 
to do so. Besides, a ready capability of 
being so argues, in my idea, a pleasant 
and delightful temperament, indicative of 
what is amiable and interesting â€” a certain 
degree of innocence even (how much so- 
ever you may have mixed in the world), 
and of benevolence ; for I cannot believe 
that the mind which is unhappy in its 
construction or reflections can ever be 
moved to real mirth, and regard, there- 
fore, the person incapable of being so, 
something in the same way as Shake- 
speare regarded the man incapable of be- 
ing moved by music, as one that I should 
not altogether like to trust." 

" Oh ! well, this is setting the matter 



&^ 



22 

in a new light," said Emily ; " so, for the 
future, whenever I laugh, as I have just 
done now, I shall recall your argument, 
in order to be reconciled to myself for 
having done so." 

" I should feel but too much flattered/' 
returned Mr. Villers, emphatically, " if 
any argument or observation of mine were 
thought worthy of being recalled to your 
recollection." 

The lady slightly bowed, and immedi- 
ately turned away her head, under the 
pretext of looking at some one in one of 
the further boxes, with perhaps a slight 
sensation of regret at the gentleman's rank 
not permitting her to indulge in any little 
coquetry with him. 

At length the entertainment was over, 
and the party returned to Fleet-street to 
supper. But whatever might be the se- 
cret inclinations of Emily, her dignity 
would not permit her to condescend any 
further by remaining for this. Consistent 
with this, she feared indeed she had al- 
ready done too much ; it was due, there- 



23 

fore, to herself, to let the party see, by 
withdrawing as soon as possible from them, 
that it was not choice that kept her a- 
mongst them ; and accordingly, in spite 
of the earnest entreaties of Mrs. Tibbs and 
her daughters, backed by the silent ones 
of Yillers's dark eyes, she repaired to her 
chamber almost the moment after her re- 
entering the house. 

" "Well, Miss St. Orme, what do you 
think of Mr. Yillers ?" asked Mrs. Tibbs, 
the next morning, as they were at break- 
fast in the drawing-room. 

" Who ? me, ma'am ! really it is so very 
unlikely, so vastly improbable, I should 
encounter the gentleman again, that I don't 
know that I have bestowed a thought on 
111111." 

" Well, well, if he spoke truth, I am 
pretty certain that's more than he could 
say about you ; but I know what I know 
â€” the truth on't is, but for you we should 
not have had his company yesterday to 
dinner." 

? But for me, ma'am !" 



24 

* Yes, my dear; he had just entered 
the shop, where I was standing at the 
time, to make an apology to Mr. Tibbs, 
just as you and the girls were coming out 
at the hall-door ; and so no sooner did he 
see you, than he asked who you were ? 
and on being told a visitor here, my gen- 
tleman suddenly changes his mind, and 
after stammering, and blushing, and cough- 
ing, like I don't know what, said that in- 
deed he believed, after all, he could not 
deny himself the pleasure of joining so 
agreeable a party, and so he would come." 

" Ridiculous!" exclaimed Emily, curv- 
ing her lip, and affecting to be intent on 
the newspaper. 

* Aye, so you may say, my dear," cried 
Mrs. Tibbs; " but these ridiculous things 
are continually happening â€” young men 
will fall in love with handsome young 
girls ; and let me tell you, Mr. Villers is 
vastly thought of â€” 'tis quite a favour, I 
assure you, to get him to come to one. 
But, lauk ! if I don't think I hear his voice 
upon the stairs !" and her ear had not de- 



25 

ceived her, for the next instant the door 
opened, and the truly-handsome Yillers 
made his appearance. 

After paying his compliments in a ge- 
neral way, he came deputed by his mo- 
ther, he said, to entreat their company 
for that evening, and with a hope that the 
omission of the ceremony of waiting on 
her would not hinder Miss St. Orme from 
complying with the request. â€” " It was 
fully the intention of my mother,"' he add- 
ed, turning to Emily, " to have had that 
pleasure this morning, but some friends 
from the country unexpectedly arrived to 
prevent her. I do however repeat my 
hope, that this will not occasion her the 
severe disappointment she will feel, if not 
fortunate enough to have her invitation 
accepted by Miss St. Orme." 

Emily's cheek flushed. There was some- 
thing in what was said that argued an idea 
of equality â€” equality between her, the 
descendant of Milesian chieftains, and a 
vender of molasses and his mother ! Pre- 
sumptuous thought! She wished to e- 

VOL. III. c 



26 

vince her resentment â€” her high disdain at 
it, but she knew not how â€” there was 
something in the collected manner of Vil- 
lers so bordering on the dignified, as to 
check the insolence of her arrogance, and 
make her suddenly look down, as she at- 
tempted to regard him with scorn. She 
positively declined, however, being of the 
party in the evening. 

" Then you'll be the means of keeping 
us all at home," exclaimed Miss Susy, in 
a very pettish accent. 

" I should hope not," said Emily, in a 
supercilious tone ; " I did rather imagine," 
and she laid an emphasis on the words, 
" that it would not have been expected I 
should have gone out whilst here." 

" And why not, my dear?" cried Mra 
Tibbs ; " why should it have been expect- 
ed that you would not go out? no such 
thing was thought, indeed ; and, as Susy 
says, if you wont go out this evening, 
why you'll be the means of preventing 
any of us." 

" Well, ma'am, rather " and she 



27 

paused and hesitatedâ€”" well, ma'am, to 
oblige you," she added â€” " merely to oblige 
you, I consent." 

Villers sighed. â€” " Well," he cried, " a 
favour from some persons is a favour, let 
it be conferred as it may." 

Emily in a moment was rendered sen- 
sible of the ill-nature, the ungraciousness, 
she had been guilty of in the emphasis â€” 
the marked emphasis, she had laid on these 
last words, by this observation. She co- 
loured violently at the reflection â€” felt 
vexed and confused ; but ere she could 
make an effort to do away the impression 
the circumstance was calculated to make, 
Villers was gone. 

But by the time evening arrived, she 
was perfectly reconciled to herself again. 
It was requisite, to prevent the risk of 
any thing unpleasant resulting from her 
condescension, to have it understood, that 
she could never have thought of going to 
such a place, but to oblige another person. 

The house was in the City-road. There 
was a handsome court before it, laid out 
c 2 



28 

with shrubs and flowers. A servant, in a 
handsome livery, admitted the party, and 
another conducted them to the garden, 
where tea was prepared in a summer-house. 
The moment they appeared, Villers has- 
tened to meet them, and taking Emily's 
hand, led hen forward, and introduced her 
to his mother â€” a handsome, respectable- 
looking, old lady, though perhaps with a 
little more of urbanity than elegance in her 
manner. 

Her reception of Emily was such as 
clearly bespoke a previous prepossession 
in her favour; she testified the greatest 
pleasure at seeing her â€” thanked her for 
her kindness (Emily would have liked the 
word condescension better) for not waiting 
for the ceremony of a visit â€” and finally 
expressed her hope that she should often 
see her. 

Emily only coldly bowed to all this, and 
in silence took a seat. Every thing look- 
ed handsome and respectable ; the garden 
was very nicely laid out, and the summer- 
house fitted up so as to render it a plea- 



29 

sant retreat ; it was divided, and in the 
inner recess two nice female domestics of- 
ficiated at the tea-table. But Emily chose 
to look with disdain on 1 every thing â€” 
what belonged to a citizen must, of course, 
be citizenic, and only worthy of being- 
sneered at ; she affected to think the gar- 
den reminded her of Drugget's, and made 
no doubt, had the gardener yielded to the 
instructions of his employers, he would 
have cut its trees and hedges into as many 
barbarous devices. But, with all her pre- 
judice, she could not deny to herself that 
had she met with some of the present 
party elsewhere, she would neither, from 
their appearance or manner, have disdain- 
ed their acquaintance; but as it was, she 
kept herself aloof from all conversation 
with them : some of the elder part of the 
company, to be sure, were not the very 
quintessence of elegance. 

" Well, to be sure," said Mrs. Tibbs, as 
she began sipping her coffee, with a plate 
of hot cake before her, " this is what I 
call w r ery delightful ; but I so dote upon 



30 

any thing that is rural like, or countri- 
fied." 

" Yes, I thought you would all like 
having your tea here, better than in the 
house," said Mrs. Villers, with a smile of 
good-nature. 

" Dear, to be sure â€” no comparison," as- 
sented another of the party, Mrs. Brixton, 
the fat wife of a rubicund-faced alderman. 
" Well, I must say, if I enwy you any 
thing, ma'am, 'tis this here garden â€” 'tis 
so pleasant to be able to get a mouthful 
of fresh hair without any trouble. That's 
the worst thing I must say of the city â€” 
our often not having a yard big enough to 
swing a cat in." 

" Ah ! it is a terrible thing, indeed, 
ma'am," said Mrs. Tibbs, with a sympa- 
thetic sigh ; " such a place as this would 
be my delight â€” the garden so pleasant, 
and the road in front of the house so live- 
ly, with the cattle coming to market, and 
the stage-coaches passing backwards and 
forwards, and the folks of a holiday going 
out to the tea-houses." 



31 

Emily, at length, began to feel surpris- 
ed and disconcerted at her silence and re- 
serve having no effect upon the party ; 
they all continued to laugh and chat as 
fearlessly as if no person of consciously- 
felt superiority was by. But perhaps it 
was not explained to them who she was ; 
yet, if possessed of any tact, would they 
not at once have seen ? Stupid ! But this 
was the consequence of being thrown a- 
mongst such people ; they had no discri- 
mination â€” no comprehension of what was 
intended to mark the difference of rank ; 
and in high disdain at the idea, she sud- 
denly rose, and slightly saying the place 
was too warm for her, left it. 

Villers was not sorry perhaps at the 
movement ; he eagerly followed â€” * Our 
attempt at a shrubbery, I suppose, you 
turn into ridicule, Miss St. Orme?" he 
cried, as he joined her; " but we citizens 
must be satisfied, as the poet says, with 
just a glimpse of nature." 

" And quite sufficient, I should pre- 



sume, for those who cannot expect to have 
more," was the supercilious reply. 

" Yes, for those who have not had 

But the eye that has once been delighted 
with the pomp of woods and garniture of 
fields â€” the misty mountain and the steam- 
ing lake â€” that has scanned a wide horizon, 
and rested on a prospect varied with all 
that could excite enthusiasm or pleasure, 
can scarcely revert to the dusky houses 
and close streets of a crowded metropolis, 
without a sensation of disgust and dissa- 
tisfaction. But it is Adam's penalty to 
endure some privations for some blessings 
â€” at least we sons of trade must be con- 
tent to do so. Those who are chained to 
a counter, or confined to a warehouse, 
must be content to forego the enjoyments 
of rural life." 

" Yes, but happily without taste enough 
to understand what is lost by the neces- 
sity." 

" In many cases probably, but not in 
all â€” no, that, as one of the poor devils," 



33 

laughing at, though he had greater rea- 
son to be offended with this impertinent 
remark, " I must deny ; I am only afraid 
there is sometimes to be met amongst us 
too keen a sense â€” too lively a susceptibi- 
lity for what is delightful and fascinating." 

Ere Emily could reply* if indeed she 
intended to do so to this speech, in which 
more was meant than met the ear, Miss 
Susy had joined them. 

With extreme impatience this young 
lady had listened to what her mother had 
said in the morning, at breakfast, on the 
subject of Mr. Villers, to Emily, and with 
still greater watched his looks and atten- 
tions towards her. Instigated by jealousy, 
she hastily followed them from the sum- 
mer-house, unable to endure the thought 
of their enjoying an uninterrupted tete-a- 
tete; though, had she known all, she might, 
like the poor Helena, have known that it 
were all one, though she should love a 
bright particular star, and hope to wed it, 
he was so above her, in his bright radi- 
ance and collateral light. 
c3 



34 

" So, Miss St. Orme, you found the 
summer-house too hot, did you?" 

Emily merely replied by an assenting 
nod. 

" Well, for my part I didn't find it so ; 
I think it is quite delightful." 

" Really ! then why not return to it ?" 

" Oh ! perhaps that might be most de- 
sirable â€” a third person is sometimes an 
unpleasant addition." 

Had Emily yielded to her feelings, she 
would have turned about, to petrify her 
with a look ; but she would not have it 
thought that her ears were even shocked 
by a hint of the possibility of any rival- 
ship between her and the daughter of a 
dealer in figs and raisins, and accordingly 
walked on quietly, without seeming to 
have heard the observation. How it affect- 
ed Villers she knew not; but, as he walked 
behind her with the disconcerted fair one, 
she thought she heard him speaking in a 
tone of remonstrance to. her. 

The walks were interspersed with pe- 
destals for flowers ; coming to one with a 



35 

moss-rose tree on it, she stopped to inhale 
the delicious breath of one that was just 
blowing. Villers immediately severed it 
from the stem, and gave it to her; it was 
the only one in blow, but this could not 
excuse his not shewing the same attention 
to Miss Susy ; her face instantly became 
scarlet, and, drawing back, she crossed 
into another walk. 

" What's the matter?" asked her sister, 
who at the moment joined them ; " has 
any thing happened to Susy ?" 

" I really don't know," Villers replied ; 
* if there has, I am unconscious of it." 

" Unconscious of it !" almost screamed 
the exasperated Susan, who had stopped 
to listen for his answer â€” " No, sir, you 
cannot be unconscious that something has 
happened to offend me." 

â€¢' I am indeed." 

" What, not conscious that your pass- 
ing me over â€” that your not offering me a 
rose, when you were presenting one - to 
Miss St. Orme, must affront me ?" 

" My dear Miss Susan, and is that pos- 



36 

sible?" cried Villers, half-laughing ; " don't 
you know that I had not another to offer 
you, and that the garden, too insignifi- 
cant indeed to speak of, is at your com- 
mand ?" 

" No, sir, I disdain every thing in it, 
now that 1 have been obliged to remind 
you of your inattention," and tears of ab- 
solute passion burst from her. 

" And is all this piece of work about 
this?" said Emily, contemptuously, tak- 
ing the rose from her bosom as she spoke, 
and half-throwing it to Mr. Villers, with 
a request that he would make his peace 
with the lady by giving it to her. 

" No," said Villers, looking reproach- 
fully at her, " since you have worn it, it 
shall wither here;" and he immediately 
placed it within his own. 

Emily coloured, and felt unpleasant. 
There was excessive presumption, she con- 
ceived, in any indication of gallantry from 
him ; yet while she thought so, there was 
a something in his manner that checked 
the expression of her displeasure at it. 



37 

She was relieved from her embarrass- 
ment by the party now beginning to ad- 
journ to the house. Two handsome draw- 
ing-rooms, eommunicatingby folding-doors, 
were ready to receive them ; the first was 
prepared for dancing, and in the second 
were card-tables. This inner one opened 
to a small but elegant conservatory, filled 
with the choicest flowers and plants, and 
mildly lighted by alabaster vases of exqui- 
site beauty, so as to give it the appear- 
ance of being illumed by moonlight. Emi- 
ly could not help a glance of admiration, 
and might have bestowed the same on all 
else she saw, could she have forgotten her 
being in the house of a citizen. 

Dancing soon commenced, but in vain 
Villers entreated for her hand. She had 
already, in coming to such a party â€” in 
mixing in such society, condescended suf- 
ficiently, more indeed than she could ap- 
prove, or reconcile to her feelings ; but to 
do more â€” to do ought but sit quietly a- 
rnongst them, was out of the question ; 
and peremptorily therefore she refused 



38 

Villers. But, with all her prejudice, she 
could not avoid acknowledging, as she sat 
silently observing them, that the quadrille 
was well danced â€” so well indeed, that had 
it been by a fashionable set, she would 
have pronounced it gracefully ; but as it 
was, she could only allow it to be cor- 
rectly. 

Whatever might have been the secret 
inclination of Villers, his character of host 
would not permit him to devote himself 
exclusively to her, but in the intervals of 
dancing he regularly joined her. At length 
there was a long one, and the ladies took 
their turn at the pianoforte. There was a 
great deal of excellent playing and sing- 
ing â€” much taste and science evinced, and 
Emily began rather to wonder at the ad- 
vantages of these city girls. 

" Would it be as useless to ask you to 
play as to dance ?" said Villers, as he was 
sitting by her. 

Emily only replied by putting up her 

Hp. 

" Well, perhaps," said he, half-laughing, 



39 

" it is as well you refuse; for what is now 
charming might be rendered but too re- 
sistless, if heightened by further attrac- 
tions ; as the poet observes, it would be 

' Like the poisoning of a dart, 



Too apt before to kill." 

Emily affected not to hear this speech ; 
there was no alternative, if she appeared 
to hear it, but to evince displeasure, and 
this, she knew not how, but she did not 
like to evince towards him. 

She soon perceived he was not only pas- 
sionately fond of music, but perfectly un- 
derstood it. More than once, as he was 
conversing with her, he paused to listen to 
the mellifluous sounds that floated through 
the apartment ; and conscious that not- 
withstanding the excellence of what she 
heard, there was no one in the apartment 
that excelled, if equalled her, in the me- 
lodious art, she could not help wishing 
that the reserve she wished to maintain 
would permit her to astonish and delight 
Villers. 

She was not much accustomed to resist 



40 

her feelings ; vanity at length triumphed 
over pride â€” she purposely made a remark, 
that induced the urgent entreaty she wish- 
ed for, as an excuse for gratifying herself. 
â€” " Well, since you are so very earnest," 
she said, in reply, " I would not like to 
be thought disobliging;" and she careless- 
ly rose, and carelessly approached the pi- 
ano. â€” "But what shall I sing?" she de- 
manded, in an affected tone ; " suppose, 
by way of variety, I give you a ditty;" 
and without further preface she sung that 
exquisite little song inserted in the " Pas- 
sionate Madman" of Beaumont and Flet- 
cher, with a sweetness, a pathos, and de- 
licacy, that did ample justice, and gave 
full effect to the beauty of the poetry. 



Hence nil ye vain delights, 
As short as are the nights 

Wherein you spend your folly ! 
There's nought in this life sweet, 
If men were wise to see't, 
But only melancholy, 
Oh, sweetest melancholy ! 



41 

Welcome, folded arms and fixed eyes â€” 
A sigh that piercing mortifies â€” 
A look that's fasten'd to the ground â€” 
A tongue chain'd up without a sound ! 

Fountain-heads and pathless groves â€” 
Places which pale pas-ion loves â€” 
Moonlight walks, when all the fowls 
Are warmly hous'd, save bats and owls â€” 
A midnight bell â€” a parting groan â€” 
These are the sounds we feed upon ; 
Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley- 
Nothing's so dainty sweet as lonely melancholy. 



Perhaps the impression her sweet voice 
was calculated to make upon the feelings 
of Villers, who literally hung over her 
enamoured, was not lessened by its falter- 
ing towards the conclusion of the song. 
It had been a favourite with Mr. Elmore 
and her mother â€” she had not sung it be- 
fore since the decease of the latter, and 
suddenly recalling her to mind, awakened 
feelings that, nearly overcoming, rendered 
her scarcely able to finish it, when, abrupt- 
ly rising, she hastily sought the conserva- 
tory, adjoining to which was the piano. 



42 

Villers followed â€” " You are indisposed, 
I fear," he cried, in a tone of the tenderest 
alarm. 

" No, not indisposed," she replied, half 
averting her face from him to conceal her 

tears, "only "but in broken sentences 

she proceeded, " I must not sing that song 
again," and completely subdued by her 
emotion, she threw herself on a chair. 

Villers procured her a. glass of water â€” 
she grew better after taking it â€” her spirits 
became composed â€” a soft melancholy suc- 
ceeded to the agitation she had been in, 
and she felt in no hurry to quit her pre- 
sent situation. 

If previously she had appeared lovely 
in the eyes of Villers â€” the innately-ele- 
gant and accomplished Villers, how much 
more captivating did she now appear, w r hen 
for a moment unstudied and simple ! He 
looked, he listened, as if he could never 
be tired of either â€” as if he only wanted a 
glance of encouragement to lay himself, 
his heart, his fortune, at her feet. 

Conversation ensued. Emily, with her 



43 

prejudices, was astonished to find that he 
had travelled â€” travelled not for gain, or 
the vulgar purpose of business, but for in- 
formation and pleasure. He had already- 
seen every thing worthy of remark in the 
kingdom ; been to France and Switzer- 
land, and visited part of Italy â€” " And I 
yet trust," he said, -" to see the eternal city, 
and visit the delightful regions of Greece. 
But I am a great explorer," he proceeded, 
" and should, could it be permitted, like 
to visit every track that has ever borne 
the impress of man ; but further I should 
not greatly wish to go ; for though none 
can more truly â€” more reverently admire 
the dread magnificence of nature than I 
do, yet, unconnected by any associations 
with human life, it fails of inspiring that 
thrilling interest so delightful to experi- 
ence. But how eloquently has the abbe 
De Chateaubriand expressed what I have 
attempted ! â€” ' Gladly,' he says, ' would I 
again make my couch on the banks of the 
Eurotas or the Jordan, if the heroic shades 
of the three hundred Spartans, or the 



44 

twelve sons of Jacob, were to visit my 
slumbers; but I would not go again to 
explore a virgin soil, which the plough- 
share has never lacerated; give me now 
ancient deserts, where I can conjure up, at 
pleasure, the walls of Babylon, or the le- 
gions of Pharsaliaâ€” plains whose furrows 
convey instruction, and where, mortal as 
I am, I trace the blood, the tears, the 
sweat of humankind." 
1 Emily was fond of literary subjects; 
the remarks of Villers were those of a ju- 
dicious and comprehensive mind, without 
pedantry or affectation, and, despite of 
herself, she was pleased, and unable to a- 
void shewing it ; perhaps there would 
have been no effort for the purpose, had 
the gentleman been other than he was ; 
but as it was, the difference in their rank 
â€” a faint sigh heaved her bosom at the 
thought of it. Had there been any equa- 
lity between them, the language of those 
dark impassioned eyes, that still, as often 
as she encountered them, she found fast- 
ened on her face, as if reading her very 



45 

countenance, might not have been unde- 
lightful to her; but as it was, she was 
sorry â€” yes, certainly sorry, to see such in- 
dications of admiration in his manner ; for 
with all her passion for it, her ambition 
for universal admiration, she by no means 
absolutely wished to inspire a hopeless at- 
tachment ; and hopeless must be any one 
that was entertained by a person in his 
station for her. 

The whole of the party but themselves 
had by this time collected in the front 
drawing-room, and Emily was the subject 
of discussion. â€” " Who is she ?" and " What 
is she?" were the questions; and " I think 
her extremely conceited'' â€” " Very affected 
indeed" â€” "Neither dancing, nor speaking, 
nor choosing to seem as if she belonged to 
the party," the remarks. 

" Xo, my dears," said good-natured Mrs. 
Tibbs, " don't think by no means it's ow- 
ing to pride or conceit her not talking 
much, or dancing like yourselves, but on- 
ly to trouble. It's not long since she lost 
her mamma, and has been left dependent 



46 

on a step-papa ; so you may think if she 
hasn't cause for grief and heaviness of 
heart, poor dear creature ! My cousin 
down at Copsely told me all about her, 
and of her having only a few hundreds she 
could call her own, God knows, a slender 
provision for any one, more especially for 
a young body brought up as she has been. 
To be sure her poor mamma did it for 
the best, but, in my opinion, seeing there 
was so little for her, I think it would have 
been better to have made a lady-milliner 
of her." 

" Ah ! well, she's a pretty creature â€” 
I dare say she'll get a good match," said 
Mrs. Villers. 

" Pretty !" echoed Miss Brixton, con- 
temptuously ; " w r ell, for my part " 

and she tittered, and tossed her head, and 
adjusted her superb pearl-necklace, in some 
little agitation of spirit; " but what do 
you think of her?" 

" Me ! what a question !" with a shrug ; 
" when you know I have only eyes for 



47 

" Yes, and I think the same," rejoined 
Mrs. Tibbs ; " I think it very likely in- 
deed that she will be well married ; and 
till she is, poor dear ! she would be quite 
welcome to be off and on with me; for 
with her little it would be a great matter 
to be where she would be at no cost." 

Well is it for our tranquillity that we 
know not half what is thought or said of 
us. Oh ! how would Emily have flamed, 
had she been aware of the conversation 
that was going on about her ! Yet per- 
haps it might have proved an useful les- 
son, by evincing the mortifications that 
arrogance provokes. Had she conducted 
herself differently, the inquiries and re- 
marks that alone occasioned this humili- 
ating history of her would never have 
been excited. The worm will turn when 
trampled on ; and man, proud, noble, dig- 
nified â€” man will rise indignantly, when he 
finds his fellow of clay attempting to scorn 
or revile him. 

An elegant repast concluded the enter- 
tainment. Had Emily allowed herself to 



48 

be ingenuous, she would have confessed 
herself pleased with the evening, but 
pride forbade the idea; and when asked 
how she liked it, she merely replied by a 
supercilious smile. 

Miss Susan chose to remain in the pouts, 
and the next morning refused coming 
down to breakfast, under the pretext of 
being indisposed. The grocer and his fore- 
man always took theirs by themselves, so 
there was nothing to interrupt the chit- 
chat of those who now assembled at it. 

" Well, Miss St. Orme, and now that 
you have seen more of him, don't you 
think Mr. Villers a fine young man ?" be- 
gan Mrs. Tibbs ; " so handsome as he is, 
and so well hedicated as he has been. But 
it was quite the pride of his father, 
poor man ! to have him brought up a fine 
scholar. What with one thing and an- 
other, he'll be quite a prize for whoever 
may get him ; for, besides the fine fortin 
his father left him, no one doubts but he'll 
come in for all the great possessions of his 
mother's brother, old Molasse, of Jamaica. 



49 

But there's no good fortin can befal him 
but what he merits, so good a son as he 
is, not looking down upon his mother, 
and despising her, because she's not as 
well informed and as helegant in her man- 
ners as himself â€” entertaining her old 
friends, and consorting with them, to 
please her, though, to be sure, not the 
kind of acquaintance suited to him, and 
determining never to marry no one he 
doesn't think will behave kind and re- 
spectful to her. Poor Susan ! no wonder 
she should like him ; but, indeed, I am 
sorry she behaved so pettish as she did 
last night, for indeed he never gave her 
no reason to think he was a lover of hers, 
so she had no right to be angry with him 
for being partickler to another ; if he had, 
I should have been angry myself with him 
for not minding her first. But he never 
did more than dance with her one night 
at a lord mayor's ball, where, somehow, 
poor dear ! she seemed to be overlooked. 
There's no mother but might be glad of 

VOL. III. D 



50 

such a mat?h for a daughter ; but though, 
thank Heaven ! we are well to do in life, 
and my girls are not amiss, I never, not 
I, expected so great a one for either of 
them, and never hasked Mr. Tillers for 
nothing more than the sake of his own 
company." 

Emily made no observation on what 
she heard ; indeed, by the manner in which 
she kept looking out at the window, she 
wished to evince indifference about it. 

In the course of her conversation, the 
preceding evening, with Villers, she had 
given him to understand she should be 
but a short time longer with the Tibbses ; 
and the following letter, which was brought 
to her whilst at breakfast, was the result 
of the intimation : â€” 

" To Miss St. Orme. 
" I fear I shall be accused of te- 
merity; but are there not circumstances 
that sometimes excuse it ? Not knowing 
the moment wlien the present opportuni- 
ty for declaring the sentiments with which 



51 

Miss St. Orme has inspired me might be 
lost, I feel it impossible to resist availing 
myself of it. Her permission to submit 
to the consideration of her friends my 
pretensions to her favour will confer un- 
speakable happiness on her devoted 

" E. Villers. 
" City Road, June 17, 18â€”." 

" So," thought Emily, " this comes of 
condescension ; if I had conducted myself 
differently, the gentleman would never 
have had the presumption to intimate he 
thought he had pretensions to my hand. 
To my hand! Ridiculous! But he must 
be undeceived â€” he must learn to know 
that wealth will not, in every case, make 
amends for the want of birth ;" and she 
blushed for the insulted dignity of her fa- 
mily. 

While almost unconsciously looking 

over the letter again, meditating the way 

in which she should answer it, Mrs. Tibbs, 

whose curiosity was a good deal excited 

d 2 






52 

by the agitation she saw it had occasioned 
her, read it quietly over her shoulder, and 
suddenly exclaimed, slapping her hand on 
the tableâ€”" Well, if Mr. Villers hasn't 
proposed for her, Nanny ! My dear, I 
wish you joy, with all my heart and soul; 
I do indeed, and don't mind poor Susan's 
being a little frumpish when she hears of 
it. Only to think of the luck !" 

Emily rose disdainfully from her chair 
â€” " Through my means, ma'am, be as- 
sured," she said, " Miss Susan will expe- 
rience no uneasiness." 

" Why ! â€” what ! â€” my dear, you don't 
mean to refuse Mr. Villers?" 

Emily only replied by a scornful smile. 

" Well, if you do, you must be in love 
with some one else. Yes â€” that must be 
the reason, for certain." 

'â€¢ No, ma'am, it is not for certain," 
Emily haughtily replied; " it does not by 
any means follow. Indeed I might feel 
some surprise at the real one not appearing 
obvious. However, that is of no conse- 
quence â€” undoubtedly elsewhere it would. 



53 

I certainly shall refuse Mr. Villers â€” de- 
cidedly refuse him. with perhaps some 

slight sensation of astonishment at his hav- 
es 

ing put it in my power to do so. Though 
he might not have been exactly informed 
of the difference, yet I think he might 

have perceived But it is no matter; 

we often bring mortifications on 01 
by yielding to mistaken ideas."' 

" Well, my dear/' in a depressed tone, 
" well, it can't be helped ; there's no one 
here has a right to argue with you. or per- 
suade you â€” I only wish you may be as 
fortunate again." 

Emily deigned no reply to a wish that 
intimated a fear affronting to her self- 
conceit and vanity, but, in silence, quit- 
ting the room, hastened to her own, where, 
losing all pity for the disappointment of 
the gentleman, in the indignation his pre- 
sumption in looking up to her, or deem- 
ing himself entitled to look up to her, had 
occasioned, she wrote the following answer 
to the generous proposal of the amiable 



54 



Villers, for he was perfectly apprised, in 
making it, of her situation. 



" To Edward Villers, Esq. 

" SIR, 

" I feel obliged for the senti- 
ments you have expressed relative to me; 
but your happiness would be but very 
little promoted by such an answer as you 
have desired being returned to your letter. 
People brought up with such very differ* 
ent notions and ideas as must have been 
the case with us, from, to be sure, what 
was accidental â€” the difference of birth, 
could never, I conceive, assimilate so as 
to render them happy in an union. Un- 
happily for me, I am now almost the only 
representative of my family, and therefore 
consider it doubly an imperative duty, not 
to act derogatory to its dignity, by form- 
ing an unequal alliance. So regulated are 
human affairs, no doubt wisely, that every 
advantage has its tax ; and amongst them 



55 

that of high birth, compelling us often to 
smother and restrain our real feelings. 
But though compelled, under this im- 
pression, to decidedly decline your ad- 
dresses, I beg leave to assure you, it will 
at all times afford me pleasure to hear of 
your welfare, and am, 

" SIR, 

" Your obedient servant, 

" Emily St. Orme. 
" Fleet-street, June 17, 18â€”." 



But the quick dispatch of her letter did 
not immediately quiet her feelings ; it was 
scarcely gone ere she began to wish it had 
not been couched in quite such a style; a 
little softening of her refusal â€” a little less 
abruptness and hauteur, might not have 
been amiss, she thought, more especially 
as it might have so happened that Villers 
was yet in ignorance of who exactly she 
was. It could not be helped, however; 
repent or regret it as she might, it was 



56 

gone past recall. She could not, however, 
detach her thoughts from it; the effect it 
was calculated to produce began to occupy 
her imagination, and, in consequence, she 
began to wish she could avoid seeing Til- 
lers again. There was something abso- 
lutely formidable in the idea of those dark 
eyes, she could not help secretly admiring 
so much, being bent on her with disdain 
or reproach. Yet what was to be done? 
she knew not when she might hear from 
Mr. Elmore; and the better estimate she 
was beginning to form of the expences of 
London, made her tremble at the thoughts 
of encountering them without being cer- 
tain on this point. 

While painfully meditating the subject, 
Mr. Tibbs good-naturedly sent her up the 
newspaper. With scarcely any interest, 
she was glancing over it, so much was her 
mind perplexed and distressed at the mo- 
ment, when, amongst the list of fashion- 
able arrivals from the coast, her eye sud- 
denly encountered the name of her friend, 



57 

Mrs. Adair; her heart fluttered with plea- 
sure, and she instantly decided on repair- 
ing to her. 

Mrs. Adair was a pretty, trifling little 
being, of some fortune, with whom Emily 
had become acquainted at a school in Bath, 
and who, a year or two after leaving it, 
married counsellor Adair, the second son 
of sir Erasmus; she had always professed 
a violent regard for Emily, and repeatedly 
invited her to spend some time with her, 
but which, through one circumstance or 
another, Emily had hitherto been pre- 
vented doing. But there was now no fur- 
ther obstacle; nothing could be more de- 
sirable than a renewal of her invitation ; 
and under the full conviction of it, she 
immediately set about dressing herself, de- 
lighted at the idea of quickly finding her- 
self the inmate of an elegant mansion, and 
at last introduced into the magic circles of 
bon ton ; and sending for a coach, ordered 
the man, as she was stepping into it, to 
drive her to the nearest stand of chairs to 
d3 



58 

Russell-square, in which was the residence 
of Mrs. Adair; for to be seen descending 
from such a vehicle as a hackney-coach, at 
the door of any of her own acquaintance, 
was out of the question. 



CHAPTER II. 



" With quicker life, as gilded coaches pass, 
In sidelong courtesy she drops the gin--,." 



Mrs. Adair was at home and alone, and, 
on the announcement of her name, came 
out to the head of the stairs, in eager im- 
patience, to meet her. Having given her 
a thousand welcomes, and asked her as 
many questions, she ostentatiously paraded 
her through her elegant mansion, for she 
had been married far beyond her expecta- 
tions, and, in consequence, had not a little 
pride in exhibiting the style in which she 
lived, especially to a person whom she had 



59 

been compelled to regard as a superior, 
from the greater expences in which she 
had been indulged, Mr. Elmore allowing 
no restrictions, either with regard to the 
education or whims of Emily, in every 
instance having her considered as his 
heiress. 

We shall pass over what immediately 
followed â€” the adroit manner in which 
Emily brought about the desired invita- 
tion, without betraying where she was; 
suffice it, every thing was settled com- 
pletely to her satisfaction, and the ensu- 
ing day fixed for her becoming the inmate 
of her friend. 

On quitting the chair, she again pro- 
cured a coach, and impatiently returned 
to the city, to prepare for her intended 
removal. 

Much regret was expressed on its being 
announced in the family, and great curio- 
sity evinced, to know where she was go- 
ing. But she studiously evaded all in- 
quiries on the subject, convinced, if she 



60 

suffered it to be known, she should run 
the risk of being horrified by some inqui- 
ries after her from these vulgar citizens; 
and, Heavens ! what a thing it would be 
to have known in the circle she was about 
mixing in, that she had once been abso- 
lutely an inmate in a grocer's dwelling! 
the idea was almost annihilating. She 
was sorry, however, she could not make 
some immediate return to the plebeians, 
for the obligation they doubtless conceived 
she was under to them ; but as soon as she 
had the power, she certainly should do so, 
and then for ever banish from her recol- 
lection the mortifying circumstance of 
ever having known such people. 

She had given her friend to understand 
that she was then in the country ; and, to 
carry on the deception, therefore, it was 
requisite she should appear to have come 
from it ; accordingly, in the coach in which 
she left Fleet-street, she was driven to 
Hammersmith, where, procuring a chaise, 
she repaired to Russell-square, and was 



61 

received with open arms by Mrs. Adair, 
who anticipated the most agreeable results 
from her being with her. 

The elder brother of counsellor Adair 
was married, and between his lady and 
Emily's friend a great deal of rivalry ex- 
isted â€” each being jealous of the attention 
shewn the other by the family. For some 
time the balance had been pretty equal 
between them ; but latterly the scale had 
completely turned in favour of the eldest 
daughter-in-law, through the circumstance 
of a young friend, of considerable fortune, 
whom the family were anxious to secure 
for the youngest son, colonel Adair of the 
Guards, having taken up her abode with 
her, and over whom she possessed great 
influence. 

Now, as Mrs. Counsellor Adair knew 
nothing whatever of the change in Emily's 
prospects, through any alteration in Mr. 
Elmore's, Emily very wisely sinking that 
circumstance altogether, she conceived her 
being with her w r ould give her quite as 
much consequence in the eyes of the fa- 



62 

mily, as her sister-in-law's friend did her. 
Besides, there was all that dash, and fa- 
shion, and air of consequence, about Emily, 
that rendered it gratifying to her pride to 
produce her as her intimate ; and, in short, 
from these and various other considera- 
tions, nothing could be more flattering 
than her reception of her. Counsellor 
Adair too, by-the-bye, not the most sapient 
of lawyers, evinced great pleasure at her 
becoming their inmate, whatever gratified 
his pretty, fluttering, little wife, being 
gratifying to him ; and Emily, at finding 
herself again in her proper element, was 
all enchantment. 

Her first introduction was to the fa- 
mily of counsellor Adair. Besides the 
heads, and those already mentioned, it 
consisted of two marriageable daughters, 
ready to accept the first offer that could 
advance their interest or consequence in 
life. Sir Erasmus was a keen worldly 
man, who never, for an instant, lost sight 
of his own interest â€” his lady was a ma- 
noeuvring woman of fashion â€” his eldest 



63 

son was stiff and haughty â€” his youngest 
one vain and affected â€” and his eldest 
daughter-in-law, satirical, conceited, and 
selfish ; their rank in life, however, was 
sufficient to satisfy Emily. 

She had now made her debut in fash- 
ionable life, and the onset had not by 
any means disappointed her expectations. 
Handsome, lively, accomplished, au fait 
in every thing that was requisite to make 
her appear to advantage, with a reputed 
fortune of considerable consequence, she 
was everywhere admired and flattered, 
and by none more than by the family she 
was amongst, the friend of Mrs. Adair 
being completely thrown into the back- 
ground by her. But she aimed much 
higher than the handsome colonel â€” a co- 
ronet was the object of her ambition, and 
she determined nothing else should satisfy 
her ; indeed, with her pretensions both 
from birth and beauty, it would be ridi- 
culous to allow any thing less ; but a mi- 
litary beau of his fashion was not unplea- 
sant to have dangling after her, and she 



64 

accordingly gave him just sufficient en- 
couragement for the purpose. 

But it was odd, that in the midst of 
what she thought so delightful, she should 
sometimes feel a weight on her spirits, a 
heaviness, a depression, and that at those 
moments the image of Villers invariably 
rose to her view. In vain she looked a- 
round for some one to equal him â€” she 
saw none to compare with him in perso- 
nal, and, as far as she could judge, mental 
accomplishments ; and a thousand times 
she thought what a pity it was, that such 
advantages as he possessed should be 
thrown away â€” that such eyes as his should 
be wasted in looking over musty ledgers 
â€” the graces of such a form as his lost a- 
midst Jamaica puncheons; but were his 
rank equal to his appearance, he would be 
too captivating â€” a prize almost beyond the 
deserts of any one. 

The duke of Holmsdale neither was 
forgotten ; she ardently wished to encoun- 
ter him again, that she might confound 
him with shame and regret for his con- 



65 

duct, by letting him see who it was he 
had insulted; for she would persist in think- 
ing that it was to a misconception of her 
rank was owing his conduct â€” that had he 
actually understood it, he would never 
have dared to act as he did. 

At length she suddenly encountered 
him, one night, at a splendid affair of the 
duchess of Wiltshire's, in Grosvenor- 
square, for which she had called forth all 
the wonders of her face. She could not 
have done so at a moment more gratifying 
to her vanity, while the buzz of admiration 
was yet sounding in her ear, and she saw 
a hundred glasses directed towards her, 
and heard as many voices inquiring who 
she was. For a moment she met his ea- 
ger gaze with a fixed look of scorn, then 
turned away, with an air calculated to 
evince the disdain in which she held him. 
It was not feigned ; but though she wish- 
ed in every way to prove it, it was im- 
possible, as her eyes wandered round the 
room, to prevent their sometimes brush- 



66 

ing over him, and still as they did, she 
found that he seemed to see only her. But 
neither the admiration or humility with 
which he appeared to regard her had any 
effect on her; she still returned but a 
frown to his beseeching looks, and when- 
ever he seemed about approaching her, 
moved in a contrary direction. 

But he was not to be repulsed. After 
the trouble he had given himself about 
her, he could not think of letting her es- 
cape so easily the toils he had spread for 
her; he remained on the watch, and at 
length found an opportunity of addressing 
her. As she was resting herself after 
dancing, she suddenly heard a deep-drawn 
sigh breathed almost in her ear, and hasti- 
ly turning her head, found him sitting on 
the form behind her. She was instantly 
rising, but, gently laying his hand on her 
arm, he prevented her â€” " Let me implore 
â€” let me beseech Miss St. Orme," he cried, 
in the most earnest yet deprecating tone, 
" to listen to me for a moment ; and if I 



67 

have not the happiness of completely vin- 
dicating myself in her opinion, I shall not 
then attempt to detain her." 

" To do so now, for the purpose you 
wish, is useless, I am convinced," replied 
Emily, haughtily. 

" No, no," replied his grace, impatient- 
ly, and still opposing her quitting her 
seat, " I will not permit myself to think 
that Miss St. Orme can remain inexorable 
to the representations of truth, or persist 
in doing herself the injury of believing 
that any one could meditate an offence 
against her. Had she resisted the sudden 
influence of doubt, she would have found 
how much she wronged me, by ever en- 
tertaining one to my prejudice â€” that my 
reverence for her was fully equal to my 
admiration." 

Emily could not be persuaded of this. 
The grounds for suspicion were too strong 
to allow her to think she had wronged 
him by the doubt she had yielded to ; but 
despite of this conviction, she gradually 
suffered herself to be softened and appeas- 



68 

ed. There was something too delightful, 
too gratifying to pride and vanity, in the 
idea of exhibiting him in such a splendid 
assembly as her captive, to be resisted; 
and, finally, she consented to the renewal 
of their acquaintance, gave him her ad- 
dress, and introduced him to her friend. 

Elsewhere he might have found it more 
difficult to overcome her resentment; but 
she had not resolution to maintain it now, 
from the triumph her relinquishing it af- 
forded her. Had she resisted it, she would 
not have had the felicity of seeing herself 
the most distinguished person in the as- 
sembly for the remainder of the evening, 
the notice of his grace giving her all the 
eclat requisite for the purpose of making 
her so. 

He did not long delay availing himself 
of the permission granted to pay his re- 
spects to her. The next day brought 
him to Russell-square, and from that 
one scarce passed in which he did not 
make his appearance there. The motive 
that brought him was obvious; and as 



69 

Emily could not now entertain the slight- 
est doubt of his being serious, she affected 
no reserve towards him. That he would 
never have been otherwise, she felt per- 
suaded, but for his having been incorrectly 
informed as to her actual station in society, 
and that therefore she was fully justified 
in her present conduct towards him ; vo- 
luntarily choosing to overlook, or banish 
from her thoughts, what the man must be 
who could attempt to take advantage of a 
supposed inferiority of situation, and want 
of protection, to betray to destruction â€” 
how heartless, how base, how truly vile 
and contemptible, he must be ! But she 
should be quite as happy with him, she 
concluded, when this reflection would force 
itself upon her, as was requisite in exalted 
life ; for there, of course, domestic felicity 
was out of the question â€” such as she might 
have enjoyed with Villers, had the dis- 
tinctions of family (and she sometimes 
sighed that they had not) permitted her 
to accept his addresses ; but in this state 
we cannot have every thing we desire; 



70 

and what was there for which a ducal co- 
ronet, and the proud precedence it would 
entitle her, would not compensate? 

The exultation of her friend at her 
splendid prospects was scarcely inferior to 
her own ; she could not now, unfortunate- 
ly, be a duchess herself, but next to actu- 
ally being so, it was gratifying to the ima- 
gination of pretty, fluttering, little Mrs. 
Counsellor Adair, to call a bosom friend 
one. For this gratification she would have 
sacrificed the interest of not merely a thou- 
sand brothers-in-law, but brothers; no 
sooner, therefore, did she conceive the 
duke paying his addresses to Emily, than 
she immediately wheeled about, and aban- 
doning the cause of poor Augustus, which 
she had heretofore advocated, attached her- 
self entirely to the interest of his illustri- 
ous rival. 

Delightful the additional eclat it would 
give her, to have a duchess for her most 
particular intimate ! She had not yet been 
presented, owing to sir Erasmus being a 
violent oppositionist ; but she resolved, as 



71 

soon as ever Emily was married, in despite 
of family politics, to be so, for the plea- 
sure of being so by a woman of her ex- 
alted rank. Meantime she decided that 
the nuptials should take place at her house 
â€” drew up, in imagination, the article that 
should announce to the admiring world 
the happy event â€” fixed on the bride's dress 
â€” and arranged relative to the tradespeople 
that should be employed on the occasion. 
But though the duke looked and sighed 
unutterable things, he still did not speak 
to the point ; but as there was no know- 
ing the moment he would, both ladies 
continued talking over matters, and me- 
thodizing and arranging them so as should 
prevent any unnecessary delay when called 
upon to act. Somehow too it so happened, 
that after the night of the duchess of Wilt- 
shire's party, Emily had not an opportunity 
of exhibiting his grace again in the man- 
ner she wished. Although they continu- 
ally met at the same places, yet either he 
was on the point of departing just as she 
entered, or else something cross interfered 



72 

to prevent his attaching himself to her; 
but nothing further distinguished his at- 
tentions to her in public, though in pri- 
vate they were all that vanity could de- 
sire. However, it was of no consequence 
â€” he would soon be announced to the 
world as her conquest ; and in the mean- 
while the expences of Emily knew no 
restriction â€” her dresses, her adornments, 
were all of the most costly description ; for 
it was now no matter what extravagance 
she was guilty of. 

Not a little were the envy and chagrin 
of the Adair family at hearing of the ad- 
dresses of the duke â€” they were at once 
envious of the splendid destiny of Emily, 
and disappointed that Augustus had not 
obtained her, more especially as, in trying 
to ingratiate himself with her, he had lost 
all chance of winning the friend of Mrs. 
Adair, from his sudden neglect of her, on 
account, as he imagined, of a richer prize. 

Mrs. Adair, who deeply resented his 
conduct, taking it as an affront to herself, re- 
joiced at his disappointment, yet with such 



73 

a degree of ill-will towards Emily, as made 
her wisli it had been occasioned through 
any other means than her exaltation. 
Proofs of this were not wanting, but they 
were like blunted arrows to Emily ; the 
attacks of petty malice were now only 
amusing to her â€” those attacks which she 
was now every instant provoking, by the 
additional conceit and impertinence of her 
manner ; she had before been repellingly 
haughty, but she now affected an air of 
condescension â€” of patronage at times, that 
was still more irritating. 

About this period she encountered lady 
Irby one night at a brilliant party. Her 
ladyship was the wife of a rich baronet, 
and the daughter of a Scotch peer, and had 
been educated with her and Mrs. Adair, 
at the same school at Bath, and on both 
of whom, as well as every other person 
not of titled connexions, she had affected 
to look down. Her airs of disdain, and 
arrogant assumption of superior conse- 
quence, had never been forgiven by Emi- 

vol. ui. 1 



74 

ly ; but Mrs. Adair, who held rank in the 
greatest respect, only thought of her with 
superior deference for them, and on their 
meeting in London after their respective 
marriages, had done every thing in her 
power to bring about an intimacy ; but in 
vain â€” her ladyship disdainfully repulsing 
every effort for the purpose. The morti- 
fication inflicted by this Mrs. Adair had 
detailed to Emily ; and while Emily was 
incensed with her for having subjected 
herself to it, she was still more irritated 
against lady Irby. 

With regard to her, however, a change 
had taken place in the sentiments of lady 
Irby; her ladyship followed the fashion, 
and seeing it had become so to admire 
Emily, and lift her into consequence, she 
no longer disdained the idea of her ac- 
quaintance, but still wishing to give her 
notice of her an air of condescension, in- 
stead of going up to her at the party just 
alluded to, she conceitedly dispatched a 
gentleman to conduct her to her. 

But Emily was not a person to com- 



75 

promise her own dignity ; and if induced 
to do so, it certainly would not have been 
to her ladyship. For a moment her cheek 
was flushed with indignation, at her pre- 
suming to think sH^r.is a person to be at 
her beck ; then recovering from her emo- 
tion, and rejoiced at the idea of retaliating 
upon her for all her insolence both to her- 
self and her friend, she laughed, protested 
she was sure there must be some mistake 
in the message that had been delivered, for 
she had not the slightest recollection of 
such a being as lady Irby being in exist- 
ence; and immediately turning away, re- 
sumed the conversation which had been 
interrupted by her ladyship's ambassador. 
The rage of lady Irby at hearing her 
answer was unutterable. Disdain her 
condescending overture, and pretend not 
to know her ! it was more than she ever 
eould or would forgive â€” a mortification, 
an affront, that made her vow implacable 
enmity to her, and decide on doing her 
every injury that lay in her power. 
E 2 



76 

An opportunity for gratifying her malice 
was not long wanting. A day or two after, 
she chanced to meet a person from the 
same neighbourhood in Cornwall, and 
from them learned . fV ;.; whole particulars 
of Mr. Elmore's loss of fortune, and the 
consequent destruction of Emily's expecta- 
tions of one ; and under the impression of 
this not being known where she was de- 
termined on mentioning it, trusting if any 
deception, as she strongly suspected, had 
been practised by Emily, the discovery of 
it would occasion her removal from Mr. 
Adair's, and consequent banishment from 
the circles of fashion. But to accomplish 
her aim, it was requisite she should com- 
municate to Mrs. Counsellor Adair herself 
what she had to detail; she accordingly 
immediately set about apologizing for her 
past conduct, not caring how she humbled 
herself one way, so she could gratify her- 
self another. 

The result was rather what she expect- 
ed â€” Mrs. Adair's eagerly accepting her 
apology, and evincing the highest delight 



77 

at her overture for an intimacy. Her 
communication was received with a min- 
gled sensation of doubt, surprise, and an- 
ger. Good Heavens ! poor, alarmed, little 
Mrs. Adair reflected, if after all the at- 
tention and kindness she had shewn her, 
it should be proved that she had been de- 
ceived, and that Emily was in reality of 
no consequence, how shocking it would 
be ! but then if the duke were really seri- 
ous in paying his addresses to her â€” ay, 
there was consolation in that thought ; 
and under the hope, or rather conviction, 
of his being so, she resolved on remaining 
silent concerning what she had now heard 
to her, lest of giving offence. 

To the family of the Adairs, too, she 
wished, for reasons that must be obvious, 
to be equally silent on the subject ; but her 
wish to keep them in ignorance of what 
she had heard was frustrated by the busy 
malice of lady Irby. They exulted in 
her communication, and in consequence 
would have had no hesitation in immedi- 
ately declining any further notice of Emi- 



78 

]y, but for their persuasion of the brilliant 
destiny that awaited her. This, however, 
was not powerful enough to restrain all in- 
dications of their malice; from this period 
Emily began to be annoyed by embarrass- 
ing hints and inuendoes; sir Erasmus, 
with mock gravity, frequently inquiring 
whether it was not on a speculative plan, 
to add to the large property he had already 
in the kingdom, Mr. Elmore was gone to 
America ; and Mrs. Adair more than once 
sneeringly observing, that perhaps it was 
on a voyage to Utopia. In short, Emily 
clearly saw, from what passed, that some- 
thing was wronÂ£ â€” that some invidious ru- 
inour or whisper had got abroad, and she 
would have been shocked and alarmed at 
the thought, but for the belief of the duke's 
intentions. But how teazing not to have 
these explained! what anxiety of mind 
would be saved by having them so ! for 
there was something frightful in the con- 
templation of her situation if, for a mo- 
ment, a doubt of them obtruded. 

Flattered and admired wherever she 



79 

went, she was universally regarded with 
envy; but had she been followed to her 
chamber â€” had the terrors that there, at 
times, assailed her imagination â€” the tears 
with which, forlorn as she could not but 
consider herself, she often deluged her pil- 
low, been witnessed, she would have been 
considered perhaps more as an object of 
pity. Naturally of the most ardent feel- 
ings, and from infancy, till within a very 
recent period, accustomed to the utmost 
kindness and affection, she often experien- 
ced, in her present situation, a void â€” a drea- 
riness, that weighed down her heart, and 
created a secret longing after that domes- 
tic happiness she was yet ready to sacrifice 
at the shrine of ambition. But her mor- 
tifications had only commenced. As she 
was sitting, one morning, at a very late 
breakfast with Mrs. Adair, the fair brow 
of this lady suddenly became contracted, 
and tossing, rather than presenting to her 
the paper she had been looking over â€” 
* There," she exclaimed â€” " there is a fine 
proof of the duke's gallantry ! upon my 



80 

word, after this I don't think I shall ever 
admit him within my doors again !" 

Emily quickly found the article that 
had excited her ire, and, with feelings of 
the deepest mortification, read as follows : 
â€” " One of the most splendid fetes yet 
given took place last night, at the princely 
mansion of his grace of Holmsdale, in Pic- 
cadilly. The whole of the magnificent 
suite of apartments was thrown open on 
the occasion, exhibiting a scene of splen* 
dour that recalled to the delighted imagi* 
nation all that has been ever described of 
oriental grandeur, but with a chasteness 
in the decorations that prevented the eye 
from being unpleasantly dazzled by the 
glare. The ball was opened by the duke 
himself, and the beautiful and accomplish- 
ed lady Almeria Mordaunt ; nor till a late 
hour did the company, comprising all that 
was elegant and dignified in the fashion* 
able world, begin to depart, charmed with 
the entertainment, and equally with the 
unceasing attentions of their illustrious 
host." 



81 

â–  Well, what do you think now ?" de- 
manded Mrs. Adair, as soon as she saw 
she had finished it. " After this I conceive 
it could not be very surprising if his grace 
was never admitted here again ; and in- 
deed it seems to me, from what has oc- 
curred, as if his visiting here was only for 
the purpose of trifling; for, if serious, what 
so natural as that he should have taken 
the opportunity this entertainment afford- 
ed of introducing you publicly as his in- 
tended bride?" 

Emily could not dispute the assertion ; 
pride impelled her to make light of the 
matter, but the effort was beyond her 
power; she turned white, vainly attempted 
to articulate, and, at length, overpowered 
by feelings, which Mrs. Adair's being 
witness to rendered still more painful, 
she stooped over her cup, hoping, with 
the tea she swallowed, she should gulp 
down the feelings that seemed choking 
her. At this instant a thundering knock 
was heard ; immediately after, some one 
E 3 



82 

flying up the stairs ; and the next instant 
the door was thrown open, and his grace 
walked in. 

Emily, trembling with emotion, caught 
up the paper which she had thrown aside, 
that she might avoid his looks till she had, 
in some degree, recovered herself; but Mrs. 
Adair sat stiff and stately, encountering 
his smiling looks with one of silent scorn, 
and on his attempting to shake hands, as 
usual with her, drawing back. â€” " So," he 
exclaimed, his countenance suddenly al- 
tering, " I see how it is ! it is exactly as I 
apprehended. That paper," glancing at 
the one in Emily's hand, " has been an- 
nouncing what must have made me ap- 
pear guilty of the most unpardonable in- 
attention ; but it is all an error â€” a mistake, 
owing entirely to the negligence of those 
who had the conducting the affair. Your 
names," and he addressed himself alter- 
nately to each lady, " were the very first 
on the list of those who were to be invit- 
ed ; but, through carelessness, the cards 
for you, as well as those for several other 



83 

persons, were not sent, though till this 
morning I remained ignorant of the cir- 
cumstance. But that you should have 
believed me capable of the omission that 
has been imputed to me, hurts me indeed. 
The pleasure of the entertainment was en- 
tirely destroyed through not seeing you 
at it; from being surprised, I became 
alarmed. But how, Emily â€” how," and he 
attempted to take her hand â€” " how could 
you suspect â€” how accuse me of what you 
have done ?" 

Emily almost started. It was the first 
time he had ever called her Emily ; and 
would he have addressed her so familiarly 
if he had not been serious? No â€” the 
thing was utterly impossible; and the 
chill of apprehended disappointment sud- 
denly gave place to the renovating glow 
of reviving hope. 

The duke was too keenly observant not 
immediately to perceive the effect he had 
so artfully produced, and was not slow in 
taking advantage of it; in short, he so ar- 
gued, so persuaded, so protested, that ere- 



&4 

dit was at length given to his assertions. 
We readily believe what we wish ; be- 
sides, there was something so galling in 
the idea of being slighted, so even dis- 
maying to Emily in the thought of find- 
ing him insincere, that even against her 
reason, perhaps, she allowed herself to be 
induced to believe what he wished. A 
reconciliation being effected, his grace 
proceeded to say, that one of the motives 
for his early visit was to ask their com- 
pany to Richmond, whither he was about 
going by water. His barge was in wait- 
ing at Whitehall Stairs, and the day was 
quite a delicious one for the puqx>se. Nei- 
ther lady started any objection to the pro- 
posal, and at his desire messengers were 
immediately dispatched to Mrs. Adair, 
her friend, and the two Misses Adair, with 
their brothers, to join the party. The in- 
vitation was accepted, and in less than 
half-an-hour they were all at the place of 
embarkation. They found, as mentioned, 
his grace's barge in waiting, with some 
military friends of his; it was elegantly 



85 

fitted up for the reception of a party, 
shaded by a light awning, that kept off 
the heat of the sun, and waved a gentle 
air. A boat with music followed ; and 
nothing could be more delightful than 
the excursion, the fineness of the day, the 
smoothness of the water, the softness of 
the varied scenery â€” all combining to ren- 
der it so. The full-bosomed Thames 
sparkled brightly in the dancing sunbeams ; 
and on the scented air came the careless 
laugh of rustic merriment, intermingled 
with the lowing of cattle laving their 
panting sides in the cool stream, the war- 
bling of birds, and the tinkling of sheep- 
bells ; while the liveliness of the scene was 
still further heightened by the multitude 
of boats passing up and down, filled with 
gay and happy parties, that the fineness 
of the day had brought out. 

A sumptuous entertainment, by his pre- 
vious order, awaited his grace's party, at 
the Star and Garter on Richmond Hill. 
Ere proceeding thither, they strolled to- 
wards Petersham, and thence to the Park. 



86 

Emily, to whom the scene was entirely 
new, delighted with its exquisite richness 
and beauty, there stood, enchanted, on 

" Thy liill, delightful Sheen f there swept 

The boundless landscape : now her raptur'd eye 

Exalting swift, to huge Augusta sent â€” 

Now to the sister hills that skirt her plains â€” 

To lofty Harrow now â€” and now to where 

Majestic Windsor lifts his princely brow, 

In lovely contrast to this glorious view, 

Calmly magnificent; then turn'd 

To where the silver Thames first rural grows ; 

There let her feasted eye unwearied stray, 

Luxurious â€” there rove thro' the pendent woods 

That nodding hang o'er Harrington's retreat, 

And stooping thence to Ham's embow'ring walks * 

As they rambled on, his grace contrived 
to detach Emily from the rest of the par- 
ty. â€” " I want to have my Emily," he said, 
" for a few minutes to myself," fondly 
drawing her hand under his arm, and 
pressing it to his heart ; " it is a restraint 
â€” a terrible restraint on feelings like mine, 
never to be able to converse with her alone. 
She must, to allow me this enjoyment, 
consent to pass a few days at the villa she 
will visit this evening, where Mrs. Chii- 



87 

Hngworth â€” poor Mrs. Chill ingworth !" and 
he smiled a little reproachfully, " has pro- 
mised to come to give her a meeting, and 
hear from her that she does not give cre- 
dit to the vile gossiping stories she knows 
she has heard to her prejudice. We can 
then quietly arrange all that is requisite 
for the completion of my wishes." 

He paused, looking at her as if for a re- 
ply, but Emily could not immediately 
speak. Her previously-agitated spirits were 
completely subdued by this sudden dis- 
persion of every doubt. She tried to strug- 
gle with her feelings, but her lip quivered, 
and tears fell from her. 

" Why weeps my Emily ?" demanded 
the duke, in a tone of equal tenderness 
and alarm ; and he took advantage of there 
being no one in sight to pass his arm round 
her waist, and press her to his bosom. 

" I doift know," faintly articulated 
Emily, and for a moment she allowed her 
head to rest against his shoulder; " but I 
believe I have not been well to-day, but 
" and she seemed as if gulping down 



88 

some strong emotion, " I shall soon be 
better ;" and raising her head, she tried to 
smile again. 

" And you consent," again demanded 
the duke, u to oblige me? â€” consent, with- 
out any of these Adairs, to pass a few clays, 
at my villa, with Mrs. Chillingworth ?" 

Emily replied by a look. 

* How blest I am !" exclaimed his grace, 
and he passionately kissed her hand ; " but 
myEmily may rely on her complying sweet- 
ness meeting a grateful return from me." 

They walked on, she confidingly hang- 
ing on his arm, and he addressing her with 
fervent earnestness, when suddenly a gen- 
tleman on horseback, attended by a groom, 
appeared in view. The duke started on 
beholding him, muttered something that 
sounded like an execration, and looked at 
either side, as if anxious to make his es- 
cape; but the thing was impossible, and 
he accordingly was forced to proceed. 

On coming up with them, the stranger 
checked his horse â€” " And so, marquis, you 
are taking a pleasant ride to-day?" â€” 



89 

" Yes ; and so, duke, you are taking an 
equally-pleasant walk?" were the greet- 
ings between them, and some other vague 
remarks or questions ensued ; but during 
the whole of which the looks of the stran- 
ger were not for an instant withdrawn 
from Emily ; his piercing eyes seemed ab- 
solutely darting into her very countenance, 
so much so as to make her colour, and 
feel confused. 

At length he rode off, and was no soon- 
er out of hearing, than, her curiosity ex- 
cited, Emily inquired who he was? 

The duke evaded the question ; but on 
its being repeated, said he was the mar- 
quis of Lewis. 

" Ob, the marquis of Lewis!" repeated 
Emily, with archness, " the brother of the 
beautiful and accomplished lady Almeria 
Mordaunt, with whom his grace of Holms- 
dale had the honour of opening the ball 
last night?" 

" Pshaw !" exclaimed the duke, peevish- 
ly, " I wish he had been to the devil be- 
fore we met him !" 



90 

" That would be a pity," observed Emi- 
ly ; u he looks a great deal too good and 
too pleasant to be sent there." 

" Good ! yes, he is all sanctification â€” ^ 
hate such fellows !*' 

" Why, to be sure," cried Emily, again 
a little archly, " they may sometimes form 
a mortifying contrast." 

" Contrast !" contemptuously ; a yes, to 
whatever is natural and agreeable. But 
it is time to turn," apparently wishing to 
change the subject ; " we must not be very 
late to dinner, lest of not being in readi- 
ness for the tide." 

They had just finished their coffee after 
dinner, when it was announced that this 
served ; the sun was by this time set, but 
a bright moon supplied its place, and the 
enchantments of the shadowy scene were 
heightened by music. The villa of which 
the duke had spoken was at the Middle- 
sex side. They landed at the foot of a 
beautiful lawn, at either side of which was 
a colonnade leading to the house. Tea 
awaited them in-a magnificent hall, through 



91 

the folding doors of which you looked, 
through the vestibule, full upon theThames, 
now rippling in the moonbeams, and the 
fine woods of the royal gardens. Several 
fine paintings and family portraits orna- 
mented it; and off of a noble gallery above 
were doors hung with crimson draperies, 
leading into the billiard-room, and other 
apartments appropriated to company; and 
in this hall it was the fashion of the house, 
whenever his grace was at it in summer, 
to have his evening parties; there was al- 
ways music upon the river on these occa- 
sions, and a band within doors for dan- 
cing ; and at a particular hour detached 
tables were spread for supper, to which 
the guests sat down just in what parties 
they pleased. 

Emily could not avoid looking round 
her, with the most complacent sensations 
at the idea, that all this splendour, and 
luxury, and magnificence, which now 
called forth her admiration, she should soon 
have the command of. The evening ad- 
vanced, and dancing commenced ; but the 



duke told her to decline it, that he might 
not lose the happiness of conversing with 
her uninterruptedly, and she obeyed him 
unreluctantly, delighted at the proud dis- 
tinction which his uninterrupted atten- 
tions gave her ; and with looks radiant 
with happiness and exultation she was 
listening to his insidious professions, when 
suddenly the marquis of Lewis was an- 
nounced. 

" Damnation !" escaped through the 
clenched teeth of the duke at the mo- 
ment ; and â€” * This is a very unexpected 
pleasure indeed, marquis," was his excla- 
mation, as he advanced to meet him. 

" Yes, so I rather imagine," replied the 
marquis, and Emily thought he looked 
and spoke with significance. 

The duke coloured violently, and sud- 
denly passing his arm under his, led hitn 
away to a distance. 

The eyes of Emily followed them . They 
talked together for a few minutes with 
great earnestness; the duke then joined 
the rest of the party, and the marquis ap- 



93 

proaching, took a seat beside her, and en- 
tered into conversation with her. She 
found him elegant and entertaining, and 
was not a little pleased at his having thus 
singled her out; there was but one mo- 
tive to which she could impute it, and 
it was gratifying to her pride and vanity 
to have the duke perceive that he was not 
the only exalted conquest she was likely 
to have had to boast of. She looked to 
see whether he was observing them, but 
not again for the remainder of the even- 
ing could she catcli his eyes ; and but for 
the explanation that had taken place in 
the course of the day, she would indeed 
have been both mortified and alarmed. 

With this explanation she had no op- 
portunity of acquainting her friend that 
night ; but the next morning, as they w r ere 
sitting tete-a-tete at breakfast, she men- 
tioned it, together with the promise she 
had given to pass a few days at his grace's 
villa with Mrs. Chillingworth. 

Mrs. Adair was almost delirious with 
joy at her coramuaication ; and they were 



94 

settling the different orders it would be 
necessary to give immediately, when a 
letter was brought to Emily, directed in 
an unknown hand, and with a coronet on 
the seal. She tore it open with all the 
eagerness of impatience, and read as fol- 
lows : â€” 



" To Miss St. Orme. 

" The marquis of Lewis presents 
his compliments to Miss St. Orme, and 
will esteem it a particular favour her al- 
lowing him the honour of a short confer, 
ence this morning, or any other that may 
be more convenient; when he shall have 
the solicited honour, he trusts to be able 
to excuse his apparent presumption in re- 
questing it. 

" Park-place, July 19, 18â€”" 



" Good Heavens ! only to think !" and 
in the flutter of her heart, and the exul- 
tation of her vanity, she put the billet in- 



95 

to the hand of Mrs. Adair, fully persuad- 
ed, in the exuberance of the latter, that 
the required conference was for the pur- 
pose of proposing for her, owing to some 
intimation that no time was to be lost in 
trying to secure her â€” " only to think of 
such a sudden conquest ! But I saw, the 
moment he beheld me," she exclaimed, 
" that he was struck â€” yes, in the in tense- 
ness of his gaze, the admiration I had in- 
spired ;" and hastily turning to a portable 
desk, she returned the following answer : â€” 

" To the Marquis of Lewis. 

" Miss St. Orme's compliments 
to the marquis of Lewis, and will have 
the honour of receiving his lordship at any 
hour he may choose to call this morning, 
" Russell square, July 19, 18 â€” " 



" Well," she cried, impatiently, to her 
friend, the moment she had dispatched her 
note, " well, what do you say to this ?" 



96 

" Say !" returned Mrs. Adair, with a 
deep sigh, and a look of dejection. " I say 
I think it a terrible and a shamefnl thing 
for a girl's friends to allow her to accept 
the first middling proposal that offers. If 
my family had not been so hasty," and 
again she sighed, " in inducing me to ac- 
cept the addresses of Mr. Adair, there is 
no knowing what my lot too might have 
been." 

Emily could scarcely suppress a smile 
at the idea of the vanity that suggested 
the possibility of her having been equally 
lucky with herself, and, if inclined to vex 
her, could have reminded her, that her 
friends were certainly not more eager for 
her to accept the proposal of Mr. Adair 
than she was herself; however, she let the 
assertion pass, only replying to it by ob- 
serving,, that people might be very happy 
without a title. 

" Yes, that I know, to be sure ; but 
then, when people see, by the good fortune 
of others, what they were entitled to." 

"Oh, come! who knows what yours 



97 

may yet be P cried Emily, jumping up in 
the gaiety of an exulting heart. " Mr. 
Adair may yet be lord chancellor," and 
with a laugh at the idea of the figure such 
a little, dapper, smirking-looking mortal 
would cut on the woolsack, she ran out 
of the room, to make some little altera- 
tions in her dress, against the arrival of 
her expected visitor. 

Yet it was really barbarous to heighten 
the pangs of the disappointment that a- 
waited him, by striving to make herself 
appear to still greater advantage â€” she 
really almost felt for the pain she was com- 
pelled to inflict on him ; still it was de- 
lightful to have to boast to the duke of 
the rejection of an offer scarce less illus- 
trious than his own, and she could not 
help thinking it so; and, with all her sen- 
sibility for the marquis, 

" With easy pace, 
Glides by the ^lass, and turning views her face." 

At length he was announced,* and Emi- 

VOL. III. F 



98 

ly hastened down to receive him. Hav- 
ing thanked her, in the most elegant terms, 
for the honour she had done him, in grant- 
ing his request, he proceeded to say, that 
he should not unnecessarily trespass on 
her time, by delaying to explain the mo- 
tive for that request, and which indeed, 
he added, he was also impatient to do, in 
order to excuse himself of presumption in 
her eyes. 

Emily bowed, and smiled, and looked 
all sweetness and condescension, and they 
were seated. 

A pause of a minute ensued. The mar- 
quis appeared embarrassed â€” even distress- 
ed. At length â€” M I did hope," he said, 
" to have been quite collected ; but I be- 
lieve it is almost impossible to be so when 
one's feelings are deeply interested; be- 
sides, there is such an awkwardness, stran- 
ger as I am, in But not to dally with 

your patience, you have perhaps, madam, 
heard of my sister?" 

Emily started ; this was a question very 
different from the one she had expected ; 



99 

and in the surprise, disappointment, and 
confusion it occasioned, she had hardly 
power to articulate, she had. 

" And " he again paused, and look- 
ed anxiously, even feelingly, in her face. 

" And what else, my lord?" faintly de- 
manded Emily, for every nerve was be- 
ginning to become agitated, and her heart 
to feel sick. 

" Why, that the duke of Holmsdale 
has been long a pretender to the hand of 
lady Almeria Mordaunt, and has at 
length obtained a promise of it, whether 
in perfect conformity with my wishes, it 
matters not to say ; but that I must be 
anxious about the conduct of a person, in 
whose actions one so nearly connected and 
dear to me as a sister is concerned, must be 
evident, and to this anxiety is owing the 
liberty I have now taken. When I had 
the honour of meeting you with his grace 
yesterday, I could not avoid making re- 
marks, that, tending to strengthen some 
rumours I had previously heard, deter- 
F 2 



100 

mined me on seeking an opportunity for 
making further observations. I was not 
long at a loss for this, and the result was 
a determination to solicit the conference 
you so condescendingly granted, that I 
might be satisfied from you, ere I permit- 
ted my sister to ratify her engagement, 
that the duke, in requiring her to do so, 
was committing no breach of honour, faith, 
or generosity." 

The previous expectations of Emily 
can better convey an idea of what her pre- 
sent feelings were than any description. 
Never had pride or exulting vanity re- 
ceived a severer humbling. The vain 
boastings she had been guilty of â€” the 
sneers, the ridicule, she might now expect 
them to draw upon her â€” the malicious 
triumph that would be enjoyed at her ex- 
pence â€” all occurred to her imagination, 
striking, like envenomed arrows, through 
her soul, and overwhelming her with 
shame, confusion, and disrtiay. 

Her choking sensations, her gaspings, 
her variations of colour, so alarmed the 



101 

marquis, that he was rising to ring for as- 
sistance, when, laying her hand upon his 
arm, she prevented him. She could not 
bear â€” no, she could not endure, that any 
one should know, by witnessing her pre- 
sent emotions, that she so felt her disap- 
pointment. At length a violent burst of 
tears came to the relief of her labouring 
heart. â€” " No matter," she cried for the 
power of utterance â€” " no matter what 
violation of honour he commits; as far as 
I am concerned, he is at liberty to carry 
his vows whither he pleases. Yes," she 
passionately added, starting from her seat, 
and pacing the room in all the agitation 
of disordered feelings, fire sparkling in her 
eyes, and her cheek again in a glow â€” 
" yes, could he now, instead of his coro- 
net, lay an imperial diadem at my feet, 
with the riches of the East to boot, I 
would reject, scorn, trample on him, as 
the most abject, the most contemptible, 
the most despicable of human beings, as 
he must ever be, who meditates an injury, 
under the presumption of its being unat- 



102 

tended with any risk. But he may yet 
find his error â€” yet find, that, though an 
orphan, I am not so utterly destitute of 
protection as to be insulted with impu- 
nity. Had I had " But she could 

not finish the sentence â€” rising sobs suffo- 
cated her voice ; and utterly exhausted by 
the violence of her emotions, she threw 
herself upon a sofa, and resting her face on 
her arm, wept convulsively, overwhelmed 
by the chilling idea of the complete for- 
lornness of her situation; for well she knew 
the beings she was amongst â€” well she 
knew, that though all would have eagerly 
participated in the triumph of her exalta- 
tion, there was not one of them who would 
feel for any injury, step forth to redress 
any wrong, or devote an hour to the alle- 
viation of sickness or sorrow; and the 
thought was like a scorpion's sting to a 
heart that had hitherto been accustomed 
to the most endearing kindness â€” to have 
every want, every wish anticipated and 
gratified â€” every care soothed and softened. 
At length, recollecting herself, she raised 



103 

her head, and apologized to the marquis 
for having seemed to forget he was by. 

The marquis only wanted to see her a 
little recovered, to take his leave. He was 
awkwardly situated â€” distressed at seeing 
her so affected, yet fearful of attempting 
either advice or consolation, lest of giving 
offence, or mentioning his determination, 
if in his power to prevent it, that his sis- 
ter should never be the wife of the duke of 
Holmsdale ; and gladly therefore quitted a 
scene so embarrassing, the first moment 
he could. 

Emily was musing, after his departure, 
how she could best break the affair to Mrs. 
Adair, when that lady, abruptly entering 
the room, saved her the trouble of any 
further consideration on the subject, by 
candidly avowing she had overheard every 
thing that had passed, by being in the 
next room. â€” " And a pretty ridiculous 
business it is !" she said. " Well, for my 
part, I have always thought that people 
should be sure of things before they boast 
of them. I confess I always had my 



104 

doubts; it seemed to me so improbable 
that the duke, with his high pretensions, 
should not look for rank." 

" Did it?" interrupted Emily, in a tone 
that instantly recalled her to a sense of her 
impertinence, and made her, from her un- 
willingness to give offence (an unwilling- 
ness originating in the doubt she was yet 
in of the truth of lady Irby's information), 
immediately endeavour to atone for what 
she had said, through the influence of dis- 
appointment and envy ; for whilst it gra- 
tified her to think of having a duchess for 
her intimate friend, still she could not help 
repining at the superior good fortune of 
Emily, and almost rejoicing at her pre- 
sent mortification. 

Without deigning any further attention 
her, Emily quitted the room, in an irri- 
tation of mind that would have induced her 
also to quit the house directly, had she pos- 
sessed the means of going elsewhere. De- 
barred of the power of immediately evincing 
her resentment, how was her haughty spirit 
wounded ! â€” how did she rave at the re- 



105 

strietions of her condition! but the dis- 
cipline was only commencing, that was 
to subjugate this spirit â€” to subdue that 
Violence, the mortifications, the humilia- 
tions, which overweening pride provokes. 

Whilst she was shut up in her chamber, 
brooding over the wreck of hopes, and 
expectations, and gaudy fancies, Mrs, 
Adair, anxious to know how to regulate 
her conduct towards her, proceeded to 
lady Irby's, to try whether she might give 
credit to her ladyship's assertion concern- 
ing the change in Mr. Elmore's circum- 
stances. 

She persisted in it, and, in consequence, 
Mrs. Adair was almost inclined to set a- 
bout getting rid of Emily immediately; 
but still a fear that her ladyship might be 
mistaken, or, through malice to Emily, 
whom she knew she hated, have invented 
what she mentioned, deterred her. 

She wished, on her own account, to 
have concealed the disappointment Emily 
had met with; but lady Irby was too 
F 3 



106 

subtle to permit her. By degrees she drew 
the fact from her, and laughed immode- 
rately, in the exuberance of her malice, at 
the detail she gave her. â€” " But it is just as 
I imagined," she said, wiping away the tears 
which laughing had brought into her eyes. 
" I just thought the duke had as much 
idea of her as he had of me, that he could 
not marry. But you, you poor, innocent, 
simple, little being," laying her hand upon 
the shoulder of Mrs. Adair, " to be so 
duped! But come; wiser folks than 
either of us have often been so; so don't 
pout, because you wont have a duchess 
for a confidante." 



107 



CHAPTER III. 



But there are hours, when on that bosom steals 

A rising terror; then indeed she feels. Cb*bec. 

Not knowing exactly what to think, Mrs. 
Adair's conduct was so much as usual, 
when they met again at dinner, that Emi- 
ly suffered herself to believe she had ne- 
ver meant to offend her, glad to be able 
to do so, for the purpose of satisfying her 
pride about remaining longer with her. 

There was a party for the opera in the 
evening. At first Emily decided against 
going ; but when she thought of the mo- 
tive to which her staying at home would 
be imputed, she altered her mind, unable 
to endure the idea of having it thought 
she felt the disappointment she had sus- 
tained, that, in fact, she did not estimate 
her claims, her pretensions, too highly, to 



108 

think any thing about it. But in spite of 
the suggestions of pride, she set about 
dressing with languor; she had received 
an humbling she could not immediately 
get over, and that rendered almost any 
effort painful at the moment. She looked 
ill, and she saw it ; there was all the pale- 
ness and haggardness in her countenance 
of a person exhausted by violent emotions, 
and, for the first time, she had recourse 
to art to restore the natural brilliancy of 
her complexion ; but if she went out, it 
must be with the certainty of obtaining 
admiration; distant was the period in 
which she should bear to be viewed with 
indifference. 

She had not been long in the house, 
when, as her eye wandered restlessly about, 
the disturbance of her mind preventing 
her paying that attention to the music 
which, in general, from the delight she 
took in it, was the case, she perceived 
Villers in the pit, in company with lady 
Ockley and her three elegant daughters. 

Emily was a little surprised at tbe cir- 



109 

cumstance, as sbe knew her ladyship to 
be a very high woman â€” a person she ne- 
ver would have supposed likely to over- 
look an inferiority of rank, in consideration 
of manners or appearance ; but it seemed 
soon accounted for. 

On lady Irby, who was of the party, in- 
quiring of Mr. Freeman, a gentleman that 
knew every body, and was a brief abstract 
and chronicle of the times, who that very 
handsome man was with the Ockleys ? he 
replied, after mentioning his name, that 
he was a young citizen, but who had just 
relinquished business, in consequence of 
having succeeded to the immense posses- 
sions of an uncle in the West Indies, and 
who, through some fortuitous circum- 
stance, having been introduced to the 
Ockley family, met with such encourage- 
ment from them, that it was imagined he 
would be united to the eldest daughter â€” 
the eldest daughter of lord Ockley ! she, 
with her indisputable claims to conse- 
quence, and even affluent fortune, ready 
to accept him, whom she, comparatively 



110 

nothing, in the arrogance of her heart, had 
rejected with scorn ! 

There was a rebuke conveyed in the 
intimation that overwhelmed her with 
shame ; and abashed and degraded in her 
own eyes by the reflection of her almost- 
idiotic folly, and presumptuous self-con- 
ceit, she shrunk back, as if anxious to con- 
ceal herself from observation ; but again 
she almost unconsciously bent forward to 
look at Villers. She now, for the first 
time, perceived he was in mourning ; and 
she thought the dress set off his fine figure, 
and rendered even the expression of his 
countenance more striking. 

He was sitting by Miss Ockley, and in 
conversing, she saw that they frequently 
became inattentive to the entertainment ; 
she sighed deeply, involuntarily sighed, 
at the corroboration this was of what she 
had just heard â€” at the reflection that but 
for herself, she might at that moment have 
been occupying the envied place of the 
otherâ€”- occupying it with a full claim on 
the tender â€” the endearing attentions of 



Ill 

Villers. â€” " Fool! idiot!" she internally 
murmured, as the thought crossed her 
imagination, compelling her to contrast 
what she would then have been with what 
she now was. At length she caught his 
eye, and it might be fancy, but she thought 
he started at beholding her ; if, however, 
he felt any emotion, it was but transient, 
for though he continued to look at her, it 
was without any apparent recognition ; 
and just as, yielding to a sudden impulse, 
she was on the point of bowing to him 
with a smile, he turned away his head. 

There was something in the abruptness 
with which he dii?_ a^hat stung her to the 
very soul ; but what right had she to com- 
plain of his scorn or indifference? Could 
he think of her letter â€” that letter which 
seeing her must immediately have recalled 
to his recollection, and view her with any 
other feelings ? Oh ! what would she not 
have given to have this perpetual record 
against her again in her possession ! yet 
of what avail? to destroy it could not do 
away the impression which its folly, its ab- 



112 

surdity, its insolence, must have made 
upon him ; and at the idea of the light in 
which it must have made her appear, she 
hid her burning face, and shrunk as much 
as possible out of sight. 

There was an inundation of visitors the 
next morning at Mrs. Counsellor Adair's. 
Mrs. Adair, with her friend, and the two 
Misses Adair, and lady Irby, with several 
others, dropped in one after another; and 
there was a great deal of laughing and 
chattering, and nick-naming God's crea- 
tures, and talking of what did not concern 
them ; and several random shafts had been 

fcjv. 

aimed by malice at E-nly, and some very 
mortifying allusions made, when (oh, hor- 
ror and dismay !) the little counsellor ap- 
peared, ushering in sir Herbert Euston, 
whom, from never having, as she had pray- 
ed, encountered since the day at Ashted, 
Emily was almost beginning to forget. 

Nothing could equal her consternation 
-at now beholding him, aware, as she was, 
of the mortification he had the power of 
exposing her to. Sickening at the thought, 



US 

she suddenly took the resolution of deny- 
ing being the person he took her for, 
should he recognize her. There was no- 
thing else for it ; no alternative, but either 
to stoutly deny the fact, or permit herself 
to be subjected to the sneers and ridicule 
of the invidious set amongst which she 
was. The baronet, who, it seems, had been 
out of town all this time, knew almost 
every one in the room. Having paid his 
compliments to all he did know, he glan- 
ced round it, and in doing so, noticed 
Emily ; for a moment he hesitated, then 
approaching with a bow â€” * This is really 
an unexpected happiness," he said â€” "one 
I almost despaired of." 

Whatever was the internal emotion of 
Emily, she appeared collected; she bowed 
in return, smiled, and then proceeded to 
say, she rather believed he was under 
some mistake, as she had not the pleasure 
of recollecting their ever having met be- 
fore. 

" What ! not at Ashted?" exclaimed sir 
Herbert, absolutely recoiling a few paces 



114 

through surprise. "Oh dear! surely you 
must remember that." 

Emily shook her head significantly. 

" Well, really this is most extraordina- 
ry. I could have sworn you were the lady 
I met there; the very voice as well as 
look â€” but perhaps you have a twin sister, 
ma'am ?" 

" No. sir," coldly, " I have not the hap- 
piness of having any sister." 

" What are you and Miss St. Orme ar- 
guing about, sir Herbert?" suddenly de- 
manded Mrs. Counsellor Adair. 

" Why I am trying, ma'am, to persuade 
her I have had the felicity of seeing her 
before, and she to persuade me I have 
not." 

" La, how odd ! and where was it you 
thought you saw her?" 

Sir Herbert mentioned ; and still doubt- 
ing the assertion of Emily, proceeded to 
detail the whole scene at Ashted, convin- 
ced, if it was as he suspected, this would 
be a means of ascertaining. 

Emily felt all the confusion he was con- 



115 

fident this would occasion her; and to 
conceal it from the invidious eyes that 
were keenly regarding her at the moment, 
turned to the window near which she was 
sitting. But that this pretext for avoid- 
ing the looks of the party afforded her no 
relief, may easily be conceived, when, as 
if there had been an absolute combination 
that morning to drive her to distraction, 
the first objects she beheld on glancing 
from the window were Mrs. Tibbs, Miss 
Tibbs, and Mr. Nat, crossing so exactly 
opposite the house, and with their eyes 
so steadily fixed upon it, as to give her 
no room to doubt its being their aim, 
through some unfortunate discovery rela- 
tive to her. 

Unable to endure the thought of the 
scene that must ensue, should they be 
ushered into the drawing-room, she in- 
stantly started up ; and regardless of the 
construction that might be put on the cir- 
cumstance, nothing being so terrible to 
her imagination as what she dreaded at 
the moment, hurried from the apartment, 



116 

and flying down stairs, directed the porter 
to say, if she was inquired for by such 
persons as she described, that she was not 
there. 

Scarcely had she given this command, 
when a modest little double knock com- 
ing to the door, she retreated into an ad- 
joining parlour, and almost immediately 
after heard the voice of Mrs. Tibbs ask- 
ing for her ; in reply, the porter said he 
knew of no such person. â€” " No such per- 
son p* echoed Mrs. Tibbs ; " why, lauk-a- 
mercy, if this ben't the oddest thing that 
can be ! Why it was only yesterday that 
this here young man heard from the foot- 
man of a carriage that he saw her stepping 
out of, that she w r as living here." 

u I don't care who the devil he heard it 
from," returned the porter ; " I suppose I 
know better than he, or his informer, who 
lives here; the man was hoaxing him 
when he told him what you say." 

" Oh, very likely indeed, sir !" cried Mrs. 
Tibbs. u But, to be sure, one was so cer- 
tain of finding her here from it, that one 



117 

could scarcely help believing but what it 
was you were wrong at first. You see, 
sir, we are to have a little hop to-morrow 
night, on account of its being my eldest 
daughter's birthday ; and that's the reason 
we were so hanxious to find out this here 
miss, that we might have hasked her too." 

" Well, now that you can't, you see, 
you may have a hop here too, for you 
may hop off as soon as you please." 

" To be sure, sir. But, lauk-a-mercy, if 
it's not beginning to spit ! Well, if I dj<Jr*t 
think all along we should b^ Â° \P ,er, 
'tis so sweltry, and, sn- ' lookin &^ >w it's 
coming. Maybe, sir, you a Â°t,e kind 
enough to let us stand in the hall a bit 
till it's over; for I am so monstrous hot 
with my walk from Fleet-street to this 
here square, for we had but a shilling ride 
by the way, that, if I am catched in the 
rain, I shall go nigh, I'm sure, to get my 
death of cold." 

" Well, stop a moment," said the por- 
ter; and entering the parlour where Emi- 
ly was, he was about inquiring what he 



118 

should do, when a significant motion of 
the hand gave him to understand, and re- 
turning, he said he was sorry he could 
not do as was wished, but his master 
would be displeased if he found strangers 
in the hall. 

Emily recovered herself a little when 
she found them actually gone ; but when, 
glancing from a window, she saw them 
crossing the square, exposed, through her 
means, to all the violence of a thunder- 
storm, and reflected on the kindness and 
hospitality she had experienced from them, 
her heart i Xj v Â°r for her conduct to- 
wards the-ii, and she almost wished she 
had run the risk of laughter and derision, 
rather than have incurred its reproaches ; 
however, it couldn't be helped, the deed 
was done, and she tried to find some such 
sufficient excuse for it as should lessen the, 
pain it occasioned her. 

Whilst trying, Mrs. Counsellor Adair 
entered the room quite in a pet. The eye 
of Emily had not been quicker in recog- 
nizing Mrs. Tibbs than the keen one of 



119 

sir Herbert; and this recognition of her 
coming to inquire for Emily, as was soon 
ascertained to be the case, confirming his 
previous assertions concerning Emily, de- 
cided Mrs. Adair on no longer having any 
hesitation in getting rid of her, as a person 
utterly unentitled to a residence in such a 
mansion as hers, and to which she was still 
further impelled by a conviction that no- 
thing could be more pleasing to lady Irby 
than her doing so. â€” " I don't wish, Miss 
St. Orme," she said, " to offend you, but 
really I cannot forbear inquiring who 
those most extraordinary -looking person- 
ages are that were just inquiring for you â€” 
personages that it is really quite distress- 
ing to see at the door, as acquaintances of 
any in the family." 

Emily durst not venture to speak for a 
moment ; then, in a provoking tone â€” " I 
am sorry I cannot inform you," she said, 
" they are unknown to me. But allow 
me to observe, was their appearance even 
more extraordinary than you are pleased 



120 

to consider it, if I condescended to notice 
them, I conceive there is no one in your 
family that need scruple to do so. How- 
ever, let that pass ; and permit me to add, 
in order to- prevent your experiencing any 
further shock through my means, I wish 
to end my visit." 

"Well, just as you please as to that; 
indeed I cannot press you to prolong it, 
for we are about making arrangements 
that would render it inconvenient to have 
any one longer with us. Dear lady Irby 
has asked us to pass some time at her 
charming villa ; and though she is all kind- 
ness, sweet woman ! I could not think of 
intruding any one uninvited on her." 

" It would be highly reprehensible, in- 
deed," said Emily ; " a breach of etiquette 
I would not for worlds you should be 
guilty of on my account," and she retreat- 
ed to her chamber. But here the scene 
was changed; without almost a shilling 
remaining, she was under a positive ne- 
cessity, from what she had said, of chan- 



121 

ging her abode immediately, and her brain 
grew dizzy at the horrors that seemed to 
environ her. 

She was wringing her hands distracted- 
ly, the anguish of her feelings not a little 
aggravated by the reflection, that but for 
herself she would not be in the dilemma 
she was, since, but for the ingratitude she 
stood self-accused of to the Tibbses, she 
would not, in such a predicament, have 
thought any thing of seeking a temporary 
shelter under their hospitable roof again, 
when some one tapped at the door. She 
started, and endeavouring to recompose 
her features, proceeded to open it, and, 
to her extreme surprise, beheld, in the 
person who had claimed admission, lady 
Laurestine. 

Her ladyship was the widow of a rela- 
tion of the Adairs, whom she had mar- 
ried in the East Indies, whence she was 
but lately returned, but leaving behind 
the youth and beauty she took out with 
her ; this, however, she could not bear to 

vol. in. G 



122 

have imagined, and accordingly had re- 
course to the most ridiculous expedients 
to try and conceal the circumstance â€” for 
Instance, she could not dance; but lest her 
not doing so should be imputed to the 
real cause â€” want of flexibility, she regu- 
larly, on entering a ball-room, pretended 
to have got a hurt in her ancle, or to have 
met with some other little accident in 
stepping out of her carriage, that prevent- 
ed her participating in that delightful a- 
musement, which, like other young people, 

â–  she quite doted on. The want of con- 
nexions of her own had thrown her almost 
entirely on the Adairs for an introduction 
into fashionable life, and they took advan- 

' . tage of the circumstance to do every thing 
in their power, from selfish motives, to 
frustrate her intention of marrying again, 
by making continual allusions to her age, 
and deterring her from dressing in the 
style she wished, by a fear of their ridi- 
cule ; so that she absolutely abhorred them, 

< and only waited for a good opportunity to 
cut the connexion. But as she was per- 



123 

feetly sensible that she was not quite an 
fait in the etiquette or elegances of polite 
life, she had long been wishing to have 
some one with her, from whom she could 
gather all she wished, without any danger 
of derision; and it instantly struck her, on 
learning that Emily was no longer to be 
allowed to remain in Russell-square, that 
she never could have a better opportunity 
of obtaining what she required, with the 
advantage of Emily being a person whom, 
from her situation, when she had answer- 
ed her purpose, she could either disi 
or retain, as best suited her inclination or 
convenience ; and accordingly she decided 
on giving her an invitation, and repaired 
to her chamber for the purpose. 

Never was heavier weight lifted from 
the heart of anxious mortal, than was re- 
moved from the wildly-throbbing one of 
Emily's by this invitation. With youth- 
ful elasticity she in a moment recovered 
herself; the idea that struck her was, that 
lady Laurestine, having no family of her 
G 2 



124 

own, bad taken a fancy to her; and the 
delightful illusion was the instantaneous 
foundation for a thousand airy castles. 

Every thing being arranged for her im- 
mediate removal to her ladyship's house 
in town, whence it was the intention of 
lady Laurestine to depart the next day, 
for a beautiful villa she had purchased at 
Ealing, her ladyship descended to the 
party below, to inform them of the invi- 
tation she had given ; and Emily shortly 
followed to take leave. 

Nothing could exceed their mortifica- 
tion at what had occurred. Instead of 
finding Emily exposed to inconvenience 
or humiliation, to think that the malice 
they had exercised for the purpose of sub- 
jecting her to these, had only served to 
put her more in the way of admiration 
and attention, was a galling disappoint- 
ment to them, they could hardly endure 
without acknowledging. Poor little Mrs. 
Counsellor Adair could not indeed conceal 
hers â€” she was all vexation and mortifica- 
tion, to think that Emily had so little rea- 



125 

son to lament her expulsion from her 
splendid residence, to which she had hoped 
to have seen her clinging, with all the fond 
tenacity of the Israelites to the comforts 
of Egypt, and, in the petulance of her dis- 
appointed pride, protested she never would 
renew an acquaintance with her again. 

* Till she becomes a duchess you mean, 
my love," cried lady Irby, satirically. 

" Oh, or a marchioness !" observed Mrs. 
Adair, sneeringly ; and again there was a 
great deal of laughing at the expence of 
Emily. 

The villa of lady Laurestine was de- 
lightfully situated. The elegant mansion 
stood on a lawn, skirted on either side by 
a rich shrubbery, and commanding a full 
view of the country navigation of the 
Thames, and a long tract of the beautiful 
scenery through which its silver current 
flows. The neighbourhood was populous 
and elegant. Lady Laurestine was im- 
mediately visited by every family of fa- 
shion in it ; and balls, and rural fetes, and 
parties for viewing the different places of 



126 

note in its vicinity, were continually tak- 
ing place; and Emily had the supreme sa- 
tisfaction of visiting the spot where Thom- 
son sung the seasons and their change, 
and the villas of Garrick and of Pope, and 
Strawberry Hill, recalling, by its hints 
from cloistered tombs, and screens, and 
oratories, the thrilling horrors of Otranto 
to her recollection ; and, in short, felt her- 
self again quite in her element, from the 
scenes in which she was again engaged, 
and felt herself again becoming authorita- 
tive and dictatorial, in consequence of the 
manner in which lady Laurestine looked 
up to her on every occasion. 

But an unpleasant feeling was some- 
times excited by the ignorance which her 
ladyship often betrayed on points of eti- 
quette : she had a trick of going out to 
the hall with her guests herself â€” and of 
staring and wondering â€” and inquiring the 
price of any thing she saw very new or 
beautiful â€” and of pressing people to eat 
at table â€” and telling what different arti- 
cles at it cost her â€” and of saying, if she 



127 

mentioned any one newly ennobled, that 
they had made a lord of him, instead of 
created him a peer; and these were all 
horrible vulgarisms to Emily, which she 
strove to correct, but often in vain, for, in 
spite of the pains she took with her lady- 
ship, such was the force of early habit, 
that she was continually betraying herself, 
to the utter dismay of Emily, especially 
if it chanced to be in a party where 
their want of affinity was not known. 
Then she knew nothing of the distinctions 
of rank, of precedence, or heraldry â€” or 
why the titled daughter of a peer should 
still be called by her Christian name, if 
married to a baronet â€” or the widow of a 
peer retain her title, if married again to a 
man of inferior rank â€” or why the son of 
a lord John, or a lord George, or so forth, 
should not also be styled so after his fa- 
ther's death ; and all these matters were 
excessively distressing to Emily. 

There were others, however, who were 
not quite so fastidious: young Stanton, 
the dashing son of a dashing family, whose 



grounds joined her ladyship's, thought he 
could well put up with her deficiences and 
her ignorances, for the sake of her worldly 
endowments, and accordingly a flirtation 
was gradually brought about between 
them, to the great amusement of every 
one who witnessed it but Emily ; but 
she had confidently made up her mind to 
being adopted by her ladyship, and she 
could not contemplate the possibility of 
finding herself mistaken with complacen- 
cy. But no, she could not â€” would not 
fear this. No, it was next to impossible 
that at her time of life lady Laurestine 
could think of changing her state again. 
To be sure, the alteration in her dress was 
a little suspicious, for now that she no 
longer dreaded the malicious Adairs refer- 
ring to her every moment, as to an old 
parish-register, for dates of almost-forgot- 
ten circumstances, she had thrown aside 
caps and high frills; but then Emily re- 
flected it was the fashion of the day for all 
to dress alike â€” grandmothers, mothers, 
daughters, down to the third and fourth 



129 

generations. Xo more the poet spoke to 
waning age : â€” 

" Let time, that makes you homely, make you sage; 

The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age. 

Henceforth retire, reduce your roving airs, 

Haunt less the plays, and more the public prayers; 

Reject the Mechlin head and gold brocade â€” 

Go pray, in sober Norwich crape array 'd. 

Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take â€” 

Their trembling lustre thews how much you shake; 

Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl â€” 

You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl. 

So for the rest, with lets incumbrance hung, 

You'll walk through life unmingled with the young, 

And view the shade and substance as you pass, 

With joint endeavours trifling at the glass, 

Or Folly drest, aud rambling all her days 

To meet her couuterpart, and grow by praise; 

Yet still sedate yourself, and gravely plain, 

You'll neither fret nor envy at the vain." 

At length lady Laurestine issued invi- 
tations for a grand fete, to consist of a 
dinner for a select party, and a ball in the 
evening for a still more numerous one. 
Emily had the directing of the affair, and 
every thing was in a style of profuse ex- 
pence and striking elegance. 
G3 



no 

The company began to arrive at five, 
and amused themselves, till the announce- 
ment of dinner, in rambling through the 
grounds, where the walks, winding through 
rich groves and shrubberies, presented, at 
almost every turn, a view of the river; 
and after the repast returned to the lawn, 
where tea and coffee were served under 
the shade of the trees; and they continued 
dancing and strolling about, till after a 
grand display of fireworks, as night ap- 
proached, when they repaired to the sa- 
loon, where the ball regularly commenced. 

Dressed with the most studious ele- 
gance, and elated by general admiration, 
Emily appeared the queen of the evening; 
and the exultation of gratified vanity was 
not a little heightened by those who wit- 
nessed the homage that was paid her. 
Odious sir Erasmus and lady Adair being 
out of town, lady Laurestine had ventured 
to ask the rest of the family, and in their 
party were included lady Irby and sir Her- 
bert Euston. 

" Well, ma'am," cried the latter, ap- 



131 

proaching Emily with a sliding bow, and 
a hand pressed against his breast, " may I 
hope now to be acknowledged as an ac- 
quaintance, since now, as in town, you 
cannot deny having seen me before?" 

" Certainly not," bridling up, " I don't 
seek to deny facts." 

"Pardon me â€” I am sure not; and I 
have many apologies to make for the per- 
tinacity with which I adhered to what 
you chose to deny ; but I trust you will 
impute it to the right motive, and so for- 
give it â€” a wish to be considered some- 
thing in the light of an acquaintance by 
you." 

" To me it is so perfectly immaterial 
what it was owing to, that 1 will impute 
it to any thing you please." 

" Nay, how can you be so unkind â€” 
how let your looks and manner be at such 
variance? The sweet girl you so much 
resemble would not have been so ill-na- 
tured â€” she would, I am sure, have allow- 
ed me to think that she was happy to see 



* Indeed ! then, as you once mistook 
me for her, I hope you will never do so 
again." 

" Barbarous ! what have I done to me- 
rit such severity ?" 

" Perhaps nothing â€” it is not always re- 
quisite to offend, to be thought of with 
indifference." 

" Worse, positively ! why, I should 
rather excite anger and scorn, than be 
thought incapable of awakening any emo- 
tion." 

" Oh, well ! only let sir Herbert exer- 
cise his happy talent of amusing some at 
the expence of others, and he need not 
fear that. But I am monopolizing him, 
and really that is not fair, when there is 
such an opportunity as here for the dis- 
play of this ;" and so saying she bowed, 
let her eyes brush over the party to which 
he belonged, and passing her arm under a 
young officer s, who was waiting to con- 
duct her to a quadrille set that was form- 
ing, turned away. 

" Spiteful enough," cried the baronet, 



133 

as he retreated to his own immediate set, 
" 'pon honour !" 

" Oh, yes ! vastly spiteful â€” very much 
so, indeed !" exclaimed little Mrs. Counsel- 
lor Adair; " but she is very malicious and 
jeering, I assure you ; she used to laugh 
at me so sometimes, you can't think." 

" Oh ! with you â€” with you, my dear 
madam !" cried the baronet ; " we can't 
permit the elegant Mrs. Counsellor Adair 
to do herself the injustice of thinking any 
one could laugh at her." 

A smile passed over the features of some 
of the party at this polite contradiction ; 
but letting it escape comment â€” " She real- 
ly is an insolent creature," said lady Irby ; 
" I see she has not yet descended from the 
stilts on which she elevated herself to play 
the anticipated part of madame la com- 
tcssc" 

" Preposterous !" exclaimed Mrs. Adair ; 
M but, after all, don't you think she has 
some little reason to be arrogant with sir 
Herbert, for, no doubt, lady Laurestine 
told her all that passed in the drawing- 



134 

room, and, as Shakespeare says, a tree 
with but one green leaf on it, would have 
been provoked by the ridiculous light in 
which he made her appear." 

" How unfortunate," with an affected 
sigh, exclaimed the baronet, " that I 
should have suffered my innocent little 
playfulness of language to offend ! In fu- 
ture I believe I shall doom myself to si- 
lence." 

" Oh, no !" languished out lady Irby, 
" you are quite too amusing for that." 

He bowed. â€” " Your ladyship does me 
honour; but, Heavens!" directing the 
eyes of the party to a lady just then ap- 
proaching, " who have we here? That 
rotund figure absolutely looks like the 
Heidelberg Tun, with a flounced petticoat 
on it ; and the two saplings at either side, 
her daughters, I presume, like lathy wil- 
lows planted against an unshaped mound 
of earth. Positively, three times round 
her would be quite sufficient exercise for 
any one in the course of a day, not quite 
a determined pedestrian." 



135 

" Oh, ridiculous!" cried lady Irby, 
" Pray, sir Herbert, as little Miss Simper 
says, don't make me laugh." 

" My dear madam, I have not the 
slightest design upon your risible faculties, 
or the gravity of your features; but just 
look at that enchanting fair one â€” she, I 
mean, in celestial blue â€” what a superla- 
tively fine complexion she would have, if 
the hues had retained their proper stations! 
but unfortunately they have shifted sta- 
tions. But how divinely lady Bloomer 
looks to-night ! There is a complexion 
indeed !" 

" Yes," assented lady Irby, * like the 
colours of the morning sky â€” as bright 
and transient too ; but if coming and 2:0- 
ing can render it natural, it certainly is 
so, for it lasts till night, and is put on 
again in the morning. But who is that 
little beau, with that fluttering-looking 
little girl hanging on his arm? they look 
like a pair of butterflies, just ready to take 
wing and skim about us." 

" I profess ignorance." 



136 

" Ob, he !" said counsellor Adair ; " he 
is, happily for him, the son of a man of 
large fortune, since he certainly never 
could have made one for himself." 

" And yonder is an heir to hereditary 
genius, but to genius only," added the 
baronet ; " and really, when one sees a fat 
and greasy citizen loaded with wealth and 
honours, and sees such a fellow, with a 
heart so exquisite to feel â€” a hand so noble 
to spend, yet without the means of grati- 
fying the generous impulses of his noble 
nature, one cannot forbear railing at that 
jade Fortune ; her blindness is the only ex- 
cuse that can be made for what appears so 
unequal a distribution of her gifts." 

" Would it not be a good speculation 
if he turned his thoughts upon our fair 
hostess ?" asked one of the party. 

" Why, yes, only I am afraid some one 
has started before him â€” young Stanton's 
attentions are unremitting, and, as you 
may perceive, not badly received." 

" But I understood," said captain Cau- 
therley, the gentleman just alluded to, 



137 

" that he was engaged to Miss "Walham, 
that pretty-looking girl, whose appearance 
struck me on entering." 

" Might have been â€” but at lover's per- 
juries, they say, Jove laughs." 

" Heavens ! and can he give up such a 
girl for lady Laurestine ?" 

" Can he ? what a simple question ! 
Why, my dear Cautherley, one would 
suppose by it, that instead of being a fa- 
shionable dasher of the Guards, noted on 
the pave of Bond-street, you were one of 
the seven sleepers, just emancipated from 
your cave." 

Cautherley shrugged his shoulders, but 
made no reply. 

In the meanwhile lady Laurestine was 
gliding about with her enamoured swain. 
But notwithstanding her pleasure in listen- 
ing to him, with many a heaving sigh did 
she contemplate the dancing at its com- 
mencement, bitterly regretting she could 
not venture on an exhibition calculated 
to confirm her pretensions to juvenility ; 
but with all her vanity she dreaded enter- 



138 

ing into a competition with the really 
youthful votaries of Terpsichore, lest her 
aim should be defeated. Fearful, however, 
that her not joining in the amusement 
might be imputed to the right cause, she 
at length suddenly pretended to have hurt 
her ancle by treading on a pebble â€” 
" Which, exclusive of the pain," she cried, 
" is so provoking, from hindering me from 
dancing, which I so dote on." 

Stanton saw through the artifice ; but 
suppressing all indications of having done 
so, professed himself, as he trusted the 
pain occasioned by the accident would be 
but slight, scarcely able to regret it, since 
insuring to him her uninterrupted conver- 
sation for the remainder of the evening â€” 
" More especially," he added, " as I my- 
self detest dancing ; though rather than 
let another have your hand, I certainly 
should have conquered my reluctance to 
it." 

Delightful! then he had no suspicion 
of the fact â€” he thought her as youthful 
as her glass represented her to be to her* 



139 

self, that is, when the labours of the toilet 
were completed â€” and she might dizen 
herself out like a youthful Hebe, without 
any fear of derision. 

While all this was passing, Emily was 
laughing, dancing, and coquetting. She 
was walking on the lawn with one of her 
partners, when the fireworks took place, 
and some rockets bursting directly over 
her head, made her start back, to avoid 
the shower of sparks that was falling, and 
in so doing she precipitated herself into 
the arms of some one behind her. She 
turned to apologize, and beheld Villers â€” 
lie, with the Ocklevs, were amongst the 
guests invited for the evening, and had 
come with them. 

The surprise, the confusion of Emily, 
robbed her, for a minute, of the power of 
utterance; but the emotion was all on the 
side of the lady â€” the gentleman was per- 
fectly cool and collected ; he knew indeed 
of her being there, so that he was not 
taken by surprise; but even if he had, he 
probably would have evinced nothing but 



140 

indifference. The calm smile with which 
he listened to her apology â€” the more 
distant one with which he hearkened to 
her inquiries after his mother, were such 
proofs of this â€” such mortifying proofs, 
as stung her to the very soul. It w r as 
all then over ; she could no longer affect 
â€” no longer agitate that heart, the value 
of which she had learned too late to esti- 
mate. 

In anguish of spirit, she turned aside 
her head ; she affected to be looking at the 
glittering meteors in the air, but at the 
instant she saw nothing. Major Clairville, 
her partner, had been separated from her 
by the pressure of the crowd, but he soon 
discovered, and immediately rejoined her. 
The instant he had, Villers moved away, 
to let him stand beside her ; and in pique 
and resentment at this, Emily suddenly 
complained of the spot being unpleasant, 
and let the major conduct her from it. 

He would have renewed the lively con- 
versation they were carrying on, but the 
spirit that had supported it was fled â€” 



141 

Emily knew neither what he said, or she 
replied, and for a minute thought of 
withdrawing from the scene ; but, no â€” 
she would not allow even Villers a tri- 
umph â€” she would not allow him to think 
she regretted the past ; and, in conse- 
quence, she rallied her spirits, and permit- 
ted herself again to be conducted to the 
dancers, but with a hope, perhaps un- 
known to herself, of being followed by 
Villers, and awakening in his heart, by 
again exhibiting herself to him, those 
feelings he had once experienced for her. 
But delusive was the hope â€” when she en- 
countered his eyes again, Miss Ockley was 
leaning on one arm, and her sister on the 
other; and to them he was completely de- 
voted for the remainder of the evening. 

Late as was the hour at which Emily 
retired to her chamber, she was up the 
next morning before the breakfast-hour, 
the disturbance of her mind preventing 
her from sleeping, and went out to w r alk 
about till lady Laurestine came down. 
After straying for some time through the 



142 

shrubbery, she turned into an arbour close 
to the hedge which divided the grounds 
of lady Laurestine and Mr. Stanton, and 
was endeavouring to amuse her thoughts 
with one of the books she found scattered 
there, it being an agreeable retreat in the 
heat of the day, when she heard voices at 
the other side of the hedge, and listening, 
distinguished them to be those of young 
Stanton and Miss TValham, whose resi- 
dence was his father's house, her parents 
being dead, and she, with her small for- 
tune, being left in his care. 

No way interested in their discourse, 
Emily was resuming her book, when the 
mention of lady Laurestine's name, in 
very disrespectful terms, by young Stan- 
ton, induced her again to listen, and, in 
consequence, she soon ascertained, that 
should lady Laurestine be weak enough 
to marry him, she must be wretched in- 
deed, as he plainly informed his compa- 
nion, for the purpose, as it seemed to 
Emily, of stifling her reproaches for his 
inconstancy, that his sole inducement for 



143 

thinking of her ladyship was her fortune, 
which once secure of, he would turn her 
adrift, to meet the punishment she well 
merited, for her vanity and folly, in sup- 
posing it possible that he could think of 
her for herself alone. 

Emily's previous opinion of him was 
not very favourable, but she did not think 
quite so badly of him as she was now 
compelled to do. For some time she he- 
sitated how to act; at length common hu- 
manity decided her on revealing to her 
ladyship what she had overheard, little a- 
ware of the invidiousness of the task, of 
endeavouring to open the eyes of a silly 
infatuated woman to what must be most 
wounding to her feelings. 

Just as she re-entered the house, her 
ladyship was descending to breakfast. 
Hardly permitting herself to bid Emily 
good-morrow, she proceeded to speak of 
the preceding evening, protesting she 
thought every thing had gone off admir- 
ably, and she hoped the papers would do 



144 

justice to the affair. â€” " Nothing hindered 
my enjoyment being perfect," she conti- 
nued, " but that unfortunate little turn 
I gave my ancle hindering me, as it 
did, from dancing, which, considering the 
divine partner I should have had, in that 
resistless creature Stanton, was really pro- 
voking. A-propos, where can the lazy 
mortal be ? He promised to breakfast here 
this morning â€” But there he is," seeing 
him at the moment crossing the lawn : 
" well, certainly he is very handsome," 
drawing a chair close to her own for him. 

" Who handsome?" demanded the gen- 
tleman, putting his head in at the window 
at the instant. 

" Not you, you wretch ! I assure you : 
so don't go to be vain in consequence of 
what you overheard ;" and while she mo- 
tioned him to his seat, she pretended to 
scold him for being so late. 

" Well, I acknowledge," he cried, " that 
I am late this morning â€” that I did not 
know how to quit my pillow ; but then it 



145 

was owing to delicious dreams, that m 
sleep restored to me the image of her I 
adore." 

" Really !" with simpering coquetry, 
exclaimed her ladyship ; " and whose pray 
may that be ?" 

" See," he replied; and taking her hand, 
and kissing it, he directed her eyes to a 
large glass that was hanging opposite. 

"Ah, you abominable flatterer!" she 
cried, affecting to push him from her. 
" Now, don't you think him one, Miss 
St. Orme?" 

" Yes, I do indeed," emphatically re- 
plied the sickened Emily. 

" There, you hear now what Miss St 
Orme thinks of you ! Now, don't sup- 
pose, after that, I shall listen to another 
word you have to say." 

" Oh, I shall yet hope," and he leered 
with impudent effrontery at Emily, " to 
have Miss St. Orme think better of me." 

But the attention of Emily was diverted 
from them, by the receipt of several let- 

VOL. III. H 



146 

ters from town, which she hastily finished 
her breakfast to peruse. Bat she would 
not have been in quite so great a hurry to 
do this, had she been aware of the little 
pleasure she should have derived from 
their perusal. They came from the trades- 
people whom she had employed there, and 
who, by this time, were apprised of her 
departure from Russell-square, and en- 
lightened also as to other matters, with 
pressing demands for the adjustment of 
their respective accounts. The elegant 
madame La Rouge, of Pail-Mall, and 
monsieur Millefieur, in the Haymarket, 
and Mr. Cordonnier, of Bond-street, all 
requested she would have the goodness to 
look over their bills, and let them be set- 
tled immediately, as this w r as the time 
they were making up their books, and 
therefore it was absolutely requisite all 
demands should forthwith be discharged. 

It might be so; but what is necessary 
and expedient we cannot always do, and 
this was the case at present with Emily ; 
she had not, at the instant, the command 



147 

of five pounds, nor could she touch the 
little pittance of hers in the funds till she 
was of a^e. She had heretofore studiously 
tried to divert her thoughts from all re- 
currence to her actual situation ; but this 
could no longer be done, and what to do 
she knew not, for she clearly saw that no 
excuse would be accepted for the adjust- 
ment of these matters; neither indeed was 
it endurable to think of making one, after 
the airs of even patronage she had assumed 
in issuing her orders. 

At length, in this desperate dilemma, 
she decided on going to Mr. Scribbleby, 
Mr. Elmore's solicitor, in Lincoln-square, 
and consulting with him. It was certain- 
ly an unpleasant measure to be compelled 
to, for, as she had been introduced to him, 
she knew him to be a prosing, sententious, 
tiresome being, and withal purse-proud ; 
but it could not be helped ; he had no 
right to dictate, or find fault with her, or 
give himself airs of consequence ; and so, 
procuring a chaise, and taking the accounts 
H 2 



148 

with her, she hurried off to his residence. 
She found him at home, and, compliments 
being over, which, to say truth, were brief 
enough between them, Emily, in displea- 
sure at his never having attempted to in- 
troduce her to his family, making a point 
of never inquiring about them, she pro- 
ceeded to business. 

" Hem! â€” how! â€” pressed to settle these 
matters?" cried Mr. Scribbleby, as he lei- 
surely put on his spectacles, to con over 
the papers. " Agitating in the first in- 
stance, no doubt ; but the law affords par- 
tial protection to minors â€” id est, allows 
them to be sued for absolute necessaries, but 
nothing else ; and if we can prove that the 
items here do not come under that head â€” 
hem ! â€” let me see â€” dress of gros de Naples 
â€” robe, richly trimmed with tulle â€” superb 
Cashmere â€” reticule of natural flowers, in 
beads â€” white satin slippers â€” embroidered 
sandals â€” lace veil and scarf. Oh, you are 
safe! yes, perfectly safe!" taking off his 
spectacles, and putting them up as care- 
fully as he had taken them out ; " not one 



149 

of these articles come under the de- 
scription of those you could be sued for â€” 
not one of them can be considered as ne- 
cessaries; and in certain cases we must 
avail ourselves of the advantages the law 
allows us." 

" I beg your pardon, sir," said Emily, 
flaming out ; " in my rank of life, they 
were, and must be considered, necessaries 
â€” indispensable necessaries, and as such be 
settled for; I must beg, therefore, that 
you will suggest some method for me to 
do so." 

" Well, I believe, if they were only to 
be paid for ad valorem* it would not be a 
difficult matter to raise the sum requisite. 
But, de facto, I will have nothing to say 
to the affair; all I will do is, when I 
write to Mr. Elmore, to state the case to 
him for his opinion; and so, my dear, 
there is no occasion for your delaying 
yourself longer here ; and if you take my 
advice, should you be silly enough â€” mark 
what I say â€” silly enough to give these 



150 

people any promise of paying them, let it 
only be that it shall be ad arbitrium." 

Still more offended and exasperated, 
Emily flung out of the office, almost with- 
out the ceremony of bidding him good- 
bye, just as his insolent-looking wife and 
rouged-up daughters were alighting from 
their splendid coach, for which her humble 
vehicle had been compelled to make way, 
and encountering whom completed her 
discomposure, passing her as they did, 
though knowing who she was, without 
any other recognition of her than a rude 
stare. â€” " Insolent!" exclaimed Emily to 
herself; " the connexions of a scrivener â€” 
of a parchment-engrosser, to give them- 
selves such airs X*- and with trepidation she 
flung herself into the chaise, and ordered 
it to madame La Rouge's. She dreaded 
facing her; but any thing was preferable 
to be dunned at lady Laurestine's. There 
was no possibility of evasion ; and the re- 
sult of her communication was, the sug- 
gesting to the ready-witted madame the 



151 

idea of introducing a friendly little Jew 
of her acquaintance to her. 

Emily caught at the proposal â€” consent- 
ed to stay that night at madame's ; and by 
that hour the next day, had the exquisite 
satisfaction of thinking she had settled 
with all to whom she was indebted, and 
left herself nothing to receive on coming 
of age. A cold shudder crept through 
her veins at the latter reflection, and she 
felt very much inclined to be very low- 
spirited : but it would be an age till she 
was of age ; and during the long interval 
of two years, what might not happen to 
reverse the present gloomy prospect? So 
she determined to rally her spirits, and 
not torment herself sooner, at least, than 
was necessary. 

Her business in town being concluded, 
she prepared to return to Ealing. 

On finding, the preceding day, it was 
requisite to remain for the night in Lon- 
don, she had written to acquaint her lady- 
ship with the circumstance ; and in doing 
so, conceiving she could not have a better 



152 

opportunity of revealing the discovery she 
had made respecting Stanton, made her 
letter of excuse for her temporary absence 
the vehicle of information concerning it ; 
concluding the detail by earnestly admo- 
nishing her ladyship to weigh well, and 
consider what she was about, ere she put 
herself in the power of a man who appear- 
ed so unprincipled. 

On arriving at Ealing, she heard her 
ladyship was absent on business, nor ex- 
pected back again till the next day. It 
instantly struck her, that it was her letter 
had taken her from home, to consult with 
some friend on the best mode of breaking 
with Stanton ; of course, however, she 
asked no questions, but endeavoured to 
amuse herself by reading and strolling 
through the grounds. 

On descending to the breakfast-parlour, 
the next morning, she found a sumptuous 
breakfast laid out for a large party. She 
was proceeding to ask who was expected 
with lady Laurestine, when a cavalcade 
of carriages appeared in view, with the 



153 

servants decorated with favours, and the 
truth at once flashed upon her. 

Lady Laurestine had that morning 
sealed her destiny, by giving her hand to 
young Stanton, and the bridal party, in- 
cluding the whole of the Stanton family, 
were coming to breakfast. 

The bridegroom entered, with her lady- 
ship hanging on his arm, and immediately 
leading her up to Emily, presented her to 
her as his bride, and asked for her congra- 
tulations. 

Emily felt something like a shock given 
to her feelings at the moment, but she en- 
deavoured to conceal all appearance of 
emotion, and wished them joy. 

The bride simpered, and affected to 
blush and look down ; and the bridegroom 
thanked her â€” * And in addition to my 
thanks for your congratulations, let me 
also, madam," he cried, fastening his eyes, 
with an expression so truly demoniac up- 
on the face of Emily, as for a moment to 
chill her blood, " thank you for the good 
H3 



154 

services you attempted to do me with this 
lady, and assure you, that I shall let no 
opportunity escape me of trying to requite 
them as they merit." 

Emily coloured violently ; she saw that 
lady Laurestine had not only been guilty 
of weakness with regard to herself, but of 
treachery with regard to her; and that her 
house, in consequence, was no longer a 
residence for her, and accordingly decided 
on immediately withdrawing from it, as 
the only way of saving herself from being 
insulted. In consequence of this decision, 
she retired the moment breakfast was over, 
at which no one appeared to know she 
was present, to prepare for her departure. 

There was nothing to delay it â€” no time 
required for consideration as to where she 
should go, for she had not the power of 
going anywhere but to theTibbs's, though, 
after the conduct with which she reproach- 
ed herself towards them, nothing could be 
more unpleasant to her feelings than the 
thought of incurring additional obliga- 
tions to them ; but so was she situated at 



155 

the moment, that it was unavoidable. 
But she must now certainly soon hear 
from Mr. Elmore, and then she should be 
able to remove to a residence more eli- 
gible for her, and to requite, in some de- 
gree, their kindness. 

She sent a billet to lady Laurestine, to 
apprise her of her intention of leaving her 
house that day ; a very laconic answer was 
returned, purporting that her ladyship 
could not possibly think of pressing her to 
prolong her stay, as she was on the 
very eve of setting out with her dear Mr. 
Stanton, and her dear new sisters-in-law, 
on a delightful tour. 

Emily could not help wishing to pre- 
vent the Stantons from having the triumph 
of seeing her actually depart alone, unat- 
tended ; there was something humiliating 
in the circumstances under which she was 
leaving the house, and she accordingly 
ordered the chaise to a private door; but 
the order was countermanded, and the 
Miss Stantons, laughing to excess, as if 
there was something very diverting in 



156 

what they saw ; and their papa and mam- 
ma, and the bride and bridegroom, and 
the whole set, in short, had the felicity of 
seeing her off. She drew up the glasses, 
and a violent fit of crying took place. It 
was the first time in which she had felt 
truly desolate, and she shuddered at the feel- 
ing. It is true, she believed she should be 
kindly received by the Tibbses ; but then 
theirs was but a chance home, and how 
dismal were the thoughts excited by the 
reflection ! 

It was past six in the evening before 
she reached Fleet-street. Her courage 
gave way a little as she approached the 
house ; and instead of ordering her things 
to be taken out at once, as she had at first 
intended, from the heartiness with which 
Mrs. Tibbs had invited her to repeat her 
visit whenever agreeable, she thought she 
would first see the family. 

On inquiring for them, from Mr. Nat, 
who, as usual, was standing behind the 
counter, he directed her to the parlour, 
the glass door of which was shaded by a 



green curtain ; she tapped at it, and being 
desired to walk in, found only the grocer 
there, and his eldest daughter, preparing 
to go to tea. Both looked surprised at 
seeing her, and to this, her surprise, she 
imputed the momentary hesitation of Miss 
Tibbs in coming forward to meet her ; but 
she knew not so well how to account for 
the sturdiness with which her father kept 
his seat, only noticing her by a nod. Her 
mind was too sore at the moment to let 
her meet with any thing like unkindness 
without emotion ; she became chilled, and 
only by a strong effort could prevent her- 
self from bursting into tears. But she 
might be too captious; the poor little 
grocer did not exactly know the etiquette 
of things, she knew ; and so trying to be- 
lieve he neither meant to be unkind or 
slighting, she suffered herself to accept 
the chair which Miss Tibbs presented to 
her, and proceeded to inquire for the rest 
of the family. 

Her mother and sister were in the coun- 
try, Miss Tibbs replied. 



158 

" Really! Would they soon be ex- 
pected home?" was the next question. 

" Yes, I hope so ; now that my mother 
is recovered, I think we shall soon see 
them." 

" Why, has she been ill?" 

" Oh, yes! very : at one time we thought 
we should have lost her;" and Miss Tibbs 
spoke in a tone of emotion. 

" Indeed ! really I am very sorry to hear 
this." 

â€¢' So you should ! so you should !" ex- 
claimed the grocer, drawing forward his 
chair, and then pushing it back again with 
violence â€” " so you should ! for it was ail 
along of you that my poor dear girls were 
near losing their poor dear mother, and 

I, the best " He could not finish the 

sentence. 

Emily looked aghast. 

" Ay, it's very true," he resumed, reco- 
vering his voice ; " you can't have forgot 
the day you refused letting her have shel- 
ter in Russell-square." Emily started. 



159 

" Yes, you may well colour," he cried ; 
" we beard all about it, through a cousin of 
our housemaid's, who had just been hired 
there; and God forgive me for wishing, 
when 1 found that it was through your 
means I was near losing my pen woman, 
that you might yet suffer for your pride 
and ingratitude. Poor soul ! she little 
thought when, in the good-nature of her 
heart, she sought you out, that you would 
have served her in such a manner; but it's 
no matter â€” no matter now ; God was 
graciously pleased to bring her through 
the illness she got through your means, 
and so, child â€” and so I forgive you â€” yes, 
I do forgive you." 

Forgive her ! but how could she forgive 
herself? â€” how could she look up, and ac- 
knowledge, after the detection of such in- 
gratitude on her part, the purpose for 
which she had come ? â€” no, death was pre- 
ferable to the meanness of such a thought. 
Yet, when she reflected on the actual pre- 
dicament in which she stood at the mo- 
ment, that she neither knew where else to 



160 

go, or had the means of paying for any 
accommodation, her brain grew dizzy at 
the frightfulness of her situation, every 
thing seemed to swim round her, and 
but for the sudden starting up of Miss 
Tibbs, who saw her changing counte- 
nance, she would have fallen on the floor. 

Hysterics followed â€” faintings ensued, 
and she was finally conveyed to a cham- 
ber, and the chaise discharged, and for se- 
veral days after, she knew nothing further 
of what passed. When recovering from 
the delirium which fever had occasioned, 
the first object she noticed, on regaining 
the clear use of her reason, was Mrs. Tibbs, 
bending anxiously over her. She had re- 
turned sooner than was expected by her 
family, and no sooner learned what had 
occurred, than, losing in pity for Emily all 
the resentment her conduct had excited, 
she set about playing the part of the good 
Samaritan, and to her unremitting care 
Emily was, in a great measure, indebted 
for her recovery. 

Unable to endure her looks, from the 



161 

reproaches they conveyed to her heart* 
Emily closed her eyes, and with passionate 
agony raising her hands, and letting them 
fall with force upon the bed, demanded 
of Heaven why she had been spared â€” 
why not taken in place of some one who 
had friends to lament them ? 

" Come, come, dear !" said Mrs. Tibbs, 
in a soothing tone, " this is not speaking 
pretty. God is the best judge who to take 
and who to spare, and all we should do is 
to be so prepared that he shall never take 
us unaware. It is not for us to know why 
he spares the old, and the ugly, and the 
poor, and the wretched, and takes the 
young, and the beautiful, and the rich, 
and the happy ; all that may perplex us 
here will be explained hereafter; and, in 
the meantime, all we have to do is to 
make the best use of the time he grants 
us, which, God knows, at the very longest, 
is but a short one." 

" Long â€” long enough for the enjoy- 
ment that is granted us in this wilderness 
of wo!" still more passionately exclaimed 



162 

the invalid, and again she relapsed into 
delirium. 

Much as we miss those who have hung 
over our cradle of infancy, yet never are 
they so truly missed, as when, recovering 
from illness, we seek the kindred eye 
that gives us the assurance of being of va- 
lue to some one. 

This was the first illness Emily had 
had since the death of her mother, and 
she again sunk under the intense agony 
of the thought, that there were now none 
any otherwise interested in her recovery 
than from compassion, verifying the poet's 
elegant remark â€” 

" On some fond breast the parting soul relies, 
Some pious drops the closing eye requires. 

Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries â€” 
Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires." 

But in the course of a few days she 
again evinced symptoms of amendment; 
and spiritual aid being then obtained for 
her, in addition to medical, the admoni- 
tions she listened to gradually recalled her 
o a sense of the submission and gratitude 



163 

she owed to Heaven. This once awaken- 
ed, murmurs were at an end; penitential 
tears bedewed her pale cheeks at the idea 
of having ever forgotten it ; and with the 
review of her errors, came the perfect con- 
viction of her requiring chastening ; much 
longer delayed, and how obdurate in pride 
â€” in vanity â€” in self-conceit, might she 
have become ! 

Was it for her â€” is it for any of us, to 
look down upon our fellow-mortals with 
pride and disdain, knowing, as we do, 
that we are all alike in the sight of God â€” 
that the high and the low, the rich and 
the poor, the loathsome beggar, with the 
proud prince on his imperial throne, are 
all alike fashioned bv the same divine 
hand, animated by the same divine spirit, 
and redeemed by the same divine mercy ? 
As these reflections crossed her mind, in 
the fullness of her heart she exclaimed it 
was good for her indeed to be afflicted. 

And surely she was afflicted. A few 
days after she was able to sit up, Mrs. 
Tibbs, with a joyful countenance, entering 



164 

her chamber, exclaimed â€” " Well, now I 
think I have brought you something that 
will do you more good than even the ner- 
vous drops of our good doctor," putting, 
as she spoke, the long-wished-for letter 
from America into her hand. 

Emily, her feeble hand trembling with 
emotion, eagerly opened it; but its contents 
were of a nature to overwhelm her with 
anguish. No remittance came ; and far 
from knowing when he might be able to 
send one, Mr. Elmore knew not whether 
he should ever possess the power, being 
most cruelly deceived with regard to the 
representations that had induced him to 
quit England. 

We shall not dwell on the terrible shock 
this letter was to the feelings of Emily. 
But though subjecting her to dependence, 
not so much on her own account as his, did 
she deplore the cruel disappointment of 
his expectations. She loved him with 
filial tenderness, and could ill bear that, 
after his long enjoyment of ease and afflu- 
ence, he should lose their comforts just as 



165 

the period was approaching that rendered 
them most requisite. But lamentation 
was useless; her situation required exer- 
tion, and after some painful struggles, she 
at length compelled herself to fairly con- 
fess it to the kind friends she was with, 
and entreat their assistance in enabling her 
to turn the abilities and accomplishments 
she was mistress of to some account. That 
she possessed such as could be serviceable, 
was a great consolation to them under the 
sorrow they felt at her communication â€” a 
communication that rendered them but 
still more kind and affectionate, if possible, 
and made her, as she reflected on the very 
different effect it would have produced on 
the heartless beings for whom she had 
once slighted them, more bitterly than 
ever reproach herself for that instance of 
ingratitude towards them. 

" Yet though I am glad, to be sure, my 
dear," cried Mrs. Tibbs, " that you can do 
something to help yourself, I can't help, 
at the same time, being sorry that you 
should be brought to the necessity, by not 



166 

taking the offer of Mr. Villers; such a 
match as he would have been, to say no- 
thing of his being such a fine young man 
â€” but marriage, they say, comes by des- 
tiny; so it can't be helped â€” you may get as 
good a one again perhaps." 

A bitter smile passed over the features 
of Emily, tears rushed to her eyes, and to 
conceal them she stooped over some work 
she was doing. 

"There," proceeded Mrs. Tibbs, little 
aware of the feelings she was exciting â€” 
" there, you'd have been mistress, had you 
taken him, of one of the finest places in 
Northamptonshire, which he made a pur- 
chase of on giving up business, after get- 
ting into possession of his uncle's great 
fortune; and there, they say, he's living 
like a prince, or rather, has every thing 
fit for a prince, for he's now gone on his 
travels. The moment his match with 
Miss Ockley was broken off, he fixed on 
going abroad." 

" What ! is he not married to her ?" ex- 
claimed Emily, with trembling eagerness, 



167 

and who, in the apprehension of hearing 
that he was, had hitherto studiously shrunk 
from all allusion to him. 

" No, nor never will, I durst to say 
now. Let people do what they will to hide 
it, the cloven foot will peep out. My 
young lady was introduced to his mother, 
and pretended the greatest reverence for 
her, for, as was proved, it was all pretence; 
and there â€” there was nothing but visitings 
every day between the two families, and 
quite a talk of the marriage beginning; 
and every thing going on as smooth as 
heart could desire, when, one night, at her 
mamma's, when she thought he was in a 
different part of the room, Mr. Villers 
caught her slyly making fun of his mother, 
with some others of her own party, and 
from that moment he determined to break 
off with her ; and, to be sure, he was right, 
for those who make game of the old can 
never have a good heart ; and besides, he's 
one of the best of sons ; and so now he's 
gone to visit Italy and Greece, they say ; 
and when he comes back, to be sure, he'll 



168 

be for getting married, for he's food of 
home, and happy will she be who gets 
him." 

" And I," thought Emily, in anguish 
of spirit â€” " I, but for my own fault, might 
have been the partner of this delightful 
excursion â€” might with him have gazed 
with rapture on the sublime records of de- 
parted ages, and, still more delightful, have 
been the means of saving my guardian 
friend â€” my paternal protector, from fur- 
ther privations ; preventing his grey hairs, 
perhaps, from being brought down with 
sorrow to the grave." 

Her emotion becoming too powerful 
for suppression, she rushed from the room ; 
but long was it ere she could regain the 
calmness which the review of what she 
had lost through her folly and arrogance 
had disturbed. Yes, she had, through 
their means, dashed the proffered cup of 
felicity from her lips, and doomed herself, 
in all probability, to a youth of slavery â€” 
an old age of neglect â€” doomed herself to 
see her beauty, her accomplishments, all 



169 

that she had so lately vaunted herself on, 
wither in obscurity, and death perhaps 
approach, without the melancholy conso- 
lation of thinking 

" There would l>e a friend's complaint, a kind domestic 

tear, 
To please her pale gl'osr, or grace her mournful bier." 

" But I deserve what I feel â€” what I 
may have to suffer!" she exclaimed ; " yes/ 
taking from her notecase his letter, which. 
she knew not why, she had continued to 
treasure there, and passionately pressing 
it to her lips, " yes, beloved Villers, I me- 
rit the wretchedness I have drawn upon 
myself by my conduct to you. Gene- 
rously you would have transplanted me 
from the sterile soil of poverty, to be of 
your own fair garden the joy and pride â€” 
there to enjoy with you the cheering in- 
fluence of those vernal suns and showers, 
that there diffuse their warmest largess ; 
but in the idiotic pride of my heart I 
scorned you, and humbled and tortured 
must that heart ever remain for the of- 
fence."

f 

A short time procured her the situation 
of a governess ; but it is not our intention 
to follow her progressively through every 
scene that ensued â€” suffice, that from be- 
ing now compelled often to bear their in- 
flictions, she saw, in all its odiousness, the 
effect of excessive pride and arrogance up- 
on the human mind, rendering it cold, 
selfish, tyrannical, but still endured with 
patience what she suffered, from the re- 
flection that she had frequently been the 
means of similar pain to others. Time 
sped, but without bringing about any 
thing pleasant to her ; the letters of Mr. 
Elmore continued complaining and me- 



171 

lancholy; and she remained without any 
friends, save those kind ones whom, in the 
presumptuous arrogance of her heart, she 
had once scorned and despised, but ulti- 
mately, as a proper chastening for this, 
been compelled to humble herself to for 
kindness. 

Strange revolution ! but she had now 
little enjoyment, but what was derived 
from those whom she had thus once de- 
spised. No child ever more ardently long.* 
ed for a holiday, than she did for the day 
in which she thought she should be allow- 
ed to pass a few hours with them. In 
moments of ease, the courtly accents of 
elegance must please the ear ; but when 
the heart is sore, and laden with trouble, 
it is the voice of kindness only can glad- 
den it. 

The good couple had the happiness of 
having both their daughters well married 
â€” Miss Tibbs to her kinsman, the long- 
expecting Mr. Nat, and her sister to a 
timber-merchant, in affluent circumstances; 
I 2 



172 

and Emily heard of others being married 
and settled â€” but still she continued the 
same ; and when the thought would ob- 
trude, how often, in the vanity of her 
heart, she had imagined, long before this 
period, young as she was, she should have 
been splendidly allied, a tear would some- 
times fall at the bitter disappointment of 
her expectations : but still, awakened to a 
sense of her errors, she went on patiently 
and uncomplainingly, at once convinced 
that she merited chastisement, and had no 
other way of atoning for the past than by 
bearing this with calmness. But though 
the spirit was willing, the flesh was weak ; 
her strength at length sunk under a 
nervous complaint, brought on by rigo- 
rous confinement and excessive fatigue, 
united to the unceasing cause she had for 
anxiety, and she was compelled to resign 
her situation. 

Not wishing to be a constant tax upon 
the kindness of her friends, she took a 
small lodging, and for some time let them 
know nothing of what had happened. At 



173 

â€¢length, her illness increasing to an alarm- 
ing degree, she could no longer deny her- 
self the consolation of seeing them ; and 
from tiiis time Mrs. Tibbs took upon her- 
self the task of seeing that she was pro- 
perly attended to, for by this time she 
was reduced to such a state of weakness, 
as to be unable to make any personal ex- 
ertion. When at length, through the at- 
tention she had now paid her, she was be- 
ginning to get a little better, this kind- 
hearted being had her removed to her own 
house, in order to have her more immedi- 
ately under her own eye ; but still the ad- 
vances of Emily towards complete con- 
valescence were but slow â€” her anxiety to 
get well absolutely retarded her recovery ; 
for she could not endure remaining a help- 
less burthen on the benevolence she felt 
she so little merited. 

Mrs. Tibbs, who penetrated what was 
passing in her mind, was in a terrible per- 
plexity about her ; she saw r the necessity 
there was for her having a little further 
indulgence, yet how little she could afford 



174 

to give up any further time for the pur- 
pose. At length a plan struck her, that 
she conceived would exactly answer: her 
son-in-law, Mr. Somers, was about going 
into the country, to view some woods ad- 
vertised for sale; his wife and sister were 
to accompany him, for the sake of a plea- 
surable excursion, and the former was just 
at the instant in want of a young person 
to go with them, as an attendant on her 
little boy, just then weaned ; and would 
Emily accept the situation, it would give 
her, Mrs. Tibbs reflected, an opportunity 
of benefiting her health, without, at the 
same time, the pain of thinking her time 
was passing for nothing. 

Emily had a momentary hesitation on 
the proposal being made her, and there 
was a quick variation in her colour, and a 
rising in her throat, and then she acquies- 
ced in it ; she wanted indeed the renova- 
tion of breathing the pure air of heaven, 
after being so long oppressed by the den- 
sity of a London atmosphere, and of catch- 
ing something more than glimpses of na- 



175 

ture, in the decorations of a citizen's box 
at Lambeth. 

But her pleasure at the arrangement 
was not heightened when she learned that 
Miss Somers was to be of the party, whom 
she had often met in Fleet-street, and 
thought any thing but agreeable. Yet 
the young lady could be so if she pleased, 
but then she knew to whom ; she had 
learned the story of Emily, and, in con- 
sequence, conceived indeed it would be 
quite a waste of courtesy to shew her any. 
She was somewhat past the period of ado- 
lescence ; but this was a circumstance she 
very carefully concealed, and, by a vulgar 
eye at least, might be considered what is 
called handsome, there being a full-grown 
figure, with a great deal of glare in her 
complexion, and good dark hair, that con- 
trasted well with it. Her education had 
been at a fashionable boarding-school ; and 
five thousand pounds, left her by her god- 
mother, in addition to what she got from 
her father, made her deem herself of no 
slight consequence; yet notwithstanding 



176 

all the advantages she possessed, it had 
somehow so happened that she had not 
yet met with such an offer as she con- 
ceived herself entitled to, or indeed any. 

If Emily was disconcerted to hear she 
was to be of the party, not less was she 
to hear of the arrangement respecting 
Emily, certain plans she meditated mak- 
ing her greatly dislike the idea of having 
her along with them. However, she could 
not prevent it, and so she conceived her 
best policy would be to conceal this dis- 
like, and act in such a manner as should 
obtain for her the confidence of the other, 
without which she feared there might be 
a chance of her proving injurious to her 
interests. She had a good deal of cun- 
ning, and Emily not much suspicion ; and 
so she found no great difficulty in per- 
suading the latter that she had hitherto 
quite misunderstood her, and that far from 
ever meaning to slight her, she had long 
been wishing for her acquaintance, and 
was now quite delighted at the opportu- 
nity which her being engaged by her sis- 



177 

ter, and travelling with them, would af- 
ford them for becoming intimate. 

But if Emily was soothed and gratified 
by this, how terribly was she again dis- 
concerted on learning that Northampton- 
shire was their destination, and that while 
Mr. Somers went on to view the purchase 
he wished to make, the ladies were to stop 
at Ashley, the seat of Mr. Villers ! Any 
thing but this she fancied she could have 
borne with composure ; but to encounter 
him after what had taken place â€” to be- 
come the inmate of his mansion, without 
the privilege of entering his society â€” no, 
she could not bear the thought, and for a 
moment she meditated drawing back from 
her engagement, when the displeasure 
it would probably excite checked her, 
and finally determined her on going on 
through the ordeal. And, after all, why 
such emotion at the thought ? Long be- 
fore this Mr. Villers was doubtless appris- 
ed of what had occurred ; so that if they 
did chance to encounter, there would be 
I 3 



178 

no necessity for any painful explanation. 
But even supposing her companions had 
the indelicacy to mention her, there was 
a great probability, from the situation she 
was in with them, that she should not be 
thrown in his way; and so she endeavour- 
ed to reconcile herself to what had at first 
been so agitating. 

Mr. Somers had his own coach ; the 
party travelled in it (a groom and Miss 
Somers's maid occupying the dicky- box), 
and slept at Bedford ; and the next day, 
at an early hour in the forenoon, reached 
Ashley, one of the finest seats considered 
in the county. The noble structure, built 
about the reign of Elizabeth, stood on 
the ascent of a hill spread with fine masses 
of wood. A beautiful stream, rendered 
still more picturesque by some small 
islands, flowed in front, and lost itself at 
either end in woods of the most magnifi- 
cent description, through which walks, 
winding in mazy intricacy to the banks of 
the river, and several other enchanting 
spots, embellished with ornamental build- 



179 

ings, were cut. The interior of the man- 
sion corresponded in every respect with 
the exterior; the apartments were lofty 
and spacious, the entrance commanding, 
and the whole indicative of taste and opu- 
lence. An establishment suitable to it 
was kept up; and none were more no- 
ticed or respected in the neighbourhood 
than its proprietors. 

The travellers not having mentioned the 
exact day at which they might be expect- 
ed, the family were out when they arrived; 
but there was a courteous housekeeper to 
receive them, and pay them every requi- 
site attention ; and having refreshed them- 
selves, Mrs. Somers, all impatience, as she 
said, to look about her, proposed they 
should walk about a little. Her husband 
made no objection ; but his sister eagerly 
withdrew to her toilet, unwilling to be 
seen till she had rebeautified, the hand- 
some Villers, with his noble mansion, be- 
ing a prize worth taking some pains to 
secure, and the hope of being able to do 



180 

which had, in reality, been the induce- 
ment for her present journey. 

Emily, who had no choice, was prepar- 
ing to follow Mr. and Mrs. Somers with 
the child, when something getting amiss 
with the lacing of one of her boots, she 
was forced to set him down, that she 
might adjust it; he began to whimper, 
and his father, in consequence, taking him 
up in his arms, desired her to make what 
haste she could to come after, the day be- 
ing so warm, he did not like the fatigue 
of carrying him. 

But Emily was in no hurry to obey 
this order. Trembling with emotion, she 
had scarcely power to support herself. In 
proportion to the admiration â€” the delight 
inspired by the scene around her, was her 
anguish and regret. What she actually 
was at the moment, and what she actually 
might have been but for herself, rose in 
torturing contrast to her imagination â€” < 
yes, but for herself; instead of entering it 
as a poor dependant, she might now have 



181 

been the happy mistress of the noble man- 
sion â€” the loved, the valued of its noble 
master's heart. â€” " Oh, thought of agony !" 
she exclaimed, as with compressed an- 
guish she pressed her clasped hands against 
her breast, " fool, idiot ! how do the con- 
sequences of your folly stare you every 
moment in the face? But why did I suf- 
fer myself to be dragged hither?" she cried; 
" why, when I must have been aware it 
would be the cause of having every pre- 
vious regret renewed, if not heightened ? 
But perhaps, without being compelled to 
feel still more severely for my conduct, the 
punishment it has incurred might not have 
been considered sufficiently great." 

She started, for at that instant she heard 
approaching footsteps, and in much con- 
fusion, picking up her gloves, which she 
had thrown on the floor when she stooped 
to settle her boot, was preparing to quit 
the parlour, when Villers himself made 
his appearance. Not expecting it was him 
she should have seen, from what she heard, 
her emotion at thus unexpectedly behold- 



182 

ing him was not controllable, and his at 
seeing her was scarcely less. He was has- 
tily passing through the room to the glass 
door, by which, it being a summer par- 
lour, the Somerses had gone out upon the 
lawn, when his eye caught a glimpse of 
her, as she 6tood rather shaded by the 
door at which he had entered. For a mo- 
ment he stood transfixed, as if doubting 
the evidence of his eyes ; then eagerly ap- 
proaching with an extended hand â€” " This 
is an unexpected pleasure indeed," he 
cried, with a countenance brightly glow- 
ing ; " I heard of the arrival of Mr. and 
Mrs. Somers, and their sister, and was 
hastening to bid them welcome, but I did 
not hear by whom they were accompa- 
nied." 

Emily, rather suffering him to take her 
hand than giving it, blushed deeply, and 
hung her head, tempted, by this observa- 
tion, to imagine, that, after all, he was not 
yet apprised of the real fact ; for if so, he 
could not be surprised, she conceived, that 
she should not have been mentioned to 



188 

him, and at one glance seeing, if it were 
as she feared, the cruel embarrassment in- 
to which she should be thrown. 

" My mother," he proceeded, " is also 
returned from her ride, and in an adjoin- 
ing apartment with some visitors; if not 
about following your friends, permit me 
to conduct you to her." 

" Her friends !" It was then as she ap- 
prehended; this was not the appellation 
he would have bestowed upon them, had 
he exactly known her situation with them, 
and her agony at the thought of the ex- 
planation that was yet to take place nearly 
overcame her. â€” " No, no," she hastily ex- 
claimed, on his attempting to draw her 
hand under his arm, to lead her to his 
mother, " I cannot !" and ere she had time 
to say, " I must not," Miss Somers came 
bursting in upon them. She had seen Vil- 
lers dismounting, and, anxious to try and 
prevent what had actually occurred, had 
hastened the completion of her toilet. 

Having listened for a minute at the 
door â€” " Oh, I will explain," she cried, as 



184 

she absolutely burst in, " I will explain 
all that is requisite to be known. Poor 
thing ! this must have been most cruelly 
embarrassing;" and adroitly disengaging 
Emily from Villers, and hooking her own 
arm under his â€” " Go, my love, go," she 
proceeded, to the former, " to your room, 
and I will let Mr. Villers know exactly 
how matters are." 

Emily could not help, after this, being 
impatient till she saw her again ; she long- 
ed to know â€” she could not help being all 
anxiety to know how Villers would re- 
ceive the communication she had to make 
himâ€” whether he would be as powerfully 
affected by it as, in spite of herself, she 
could not avoid imagining. A consider- 
able time, however, elapsed ere she had 
any opportunity of learning this. At 
length, just a short time before the an- 
nouncement of dinner, Miss Somers en- 
tered the apartment where she was by 
herself with the child, and throwing her- 
self on a seat â€” " Well, really," she cried, 
as she untied her bonnet, and felt, as she 



185 

took it off, that it had not disordered her 
hair, " this is a perfect paradise of a place." 

" Yes," assented Emily ; " but " and 

she was on the point of asking what said 
Mr. Villers to your communication? when 
she checked herself: no â€” she would not 
have it known that she was anxious to 
learn. Yet when idly chattering and 
playing with the child, and gazing on her- 
self, Miss Somers went on a considerable 
time, cruelly dallying, as she thought, with 
her impatience, she could not avoid indi- 
rectly leading to the subject ; but in vain. 
Miss Somers would understand no allu- 
sion ; and at last, starting up,- protested 
she was sure they were by this time seek- 
ing for her in the drawing-room, and ab- 
ruptly retired. 

The heart of Emily sunk within her; 
she had allowed herself to imagine that 
Villers would have listened with no com- 
mon interest to the communication of 
Miss Somers; and to find herself mistaken! 
For had it been as she had allowed herself 
to think, surely Miss Somers would have 



186 

told her; that no sensation had been ex- 
cited by it â€” that it had been hearkened to 
as a mere matter of course, from what had 
previously taken place, was a mortifica- 
tion, a pang, a disappointment, a convic- 
tion of her being indeed completely thrown 
aside â€” an object of utter indifference, that 
at once wrung every feeling, and chilled 
her to the soul. 

Miserable and humbled as we may be, 
yet still, long as we are, from time to time, 
surprised into a belief of still being an ob- 
ject of interest to some one, the soul can 
experience something like a joyous re- 
bound; but once deprived of this â€” led to 
consider ourselves a severed link from the 
great chain of existence, that no one misses 
or cares about us, and what a blank be- 
comes creation â€” what a drag existence! 
And for her to be so considered â€” her who 
had been so loved, so valued â€” her whose 
feelings were so acute, who had so long 
been accustomed to the sweet play of the 
affections, for her to be obliged to believe 
that she was comparatively of no greater 



187 

interest in the creation now than the wild 
field flower she trampled under foot â€” oh 5 
there was agony, insupportable, chilling, 
desolating agony in the thought ; and sub- 
dued by it, she forgot the envied child 
that was playing on the carpet, and, lean- 
ing her face against the back of the chair, 
wept convulsively. 

Had she, however, overheard all that 
passed between Miss Somers and Villers, 
she would not perhaps have felt exactly 
what she now did. Villers was not a be- 
ing to hear of the distress or misfortunes 
of any one without emotion, more espe- 
cially of one whom he had known under 
such different circumstances â€” one whom 
he had thought so of; and he certainly 
wished that, since things were as they 
were, it had been under any other roof 
than his own that he had encountered her 
again. There was something terribly awk- 
ward, distressing, embarrassing, in the pre- 
dicament in which it had placed him. 

" Well, and so you have heard all about 
poor Emily, " said Mrs. Somers, address- 



188 

ing herself to him after dinner. " Poor 
thing! who would have thought, when 
you first saw her looking so lady-like, that 
she ever would have been a servant of 
mine? But have you seen my little boy, 
sweet fellow ! yet, ma'am ?" turning to 
Mrs. Villers. 

" No, ma'am, not yet." 

" Indeed ! Then I will ring the bell 
for Emily to bring him," and she accord- 
ingly rose, and rung the bell. 

Open as was the brow of Villers, yet he 
could darkly contract it at times, and he 
certainly did so now, and strove to catch 
the eye of his mother ; but in vain â€” the 
good lady being engaged, at the moment, 
in admiring the rich texture of the lady's 
gown who was sitting by her, so there 
was no one to oppose the cruel indelicacy 
of bringing Emily in, he himself not 
choosing to speak against it ; but pushing 
back his chair, he prepared to make his 
escape the moment he should hear her, 
when Miss Somers, who was sitting next 
him, and had been watching his varying 



189 

countenance, laying her hand upon his 
arm â€” " I guess your feelings," she cried; 
" and mine, I assure you, are in unison. 
Not for the world would I have the poor 
soul exposed to what she must feel, should 
she be dragged in here. It is astonishing 
such a thing could be thought of; but my 
poor sister," and she spoke in a lowered 
tone, and cast a pitying glance at her, 
" has not the tact that could be wished 
for. However, no matter, I shall prevent 
what would be so painful," and at that in- 
stant, hearing the voice of the child, she 
started up, and flying to the door â€” " Go 
back," receiving him from the almost- 
fainting Emily, " to your room, my love," 
she cried, in a tone sufficiently loud to be 
overheard by Villers, who she knew was 
listening; "and when they are tired of 
your little charge here, I will bring him 
to you myself." 

" I am grateful to you," whispered Vil- 
lers, as she turned from the door, and un- 
consciously he took the child from her 
arms ; " you have saved me from the most 



190 

distressing embarrassment, by the manner 
in which you have acted ;" and from this 
the lady took her cue, and Emily became 
the subject of her discourse, and how much 
she entered into her feelings, and what 
her own were for her, and how much she 
regretted not having yet the power of 
proving these. â€” " But till I am my own 
mistress," she said, as leaning on the vo- 
luntarily-offered arm of Villers, she was 
walking on the lawn with him after tea, 
" which will not be till I am either of age 

or " and she looked down so prettily, 

as she thought, leaving him to finish what 
her modesty would not let her, " this will 
not be the case." 

Of age ! something made Villers smile 
at the moment ; but the lady did not per- 
ceive him, and perhaps it was as well she 
did not ; for there was a slyness in the 
smile that might not have pleased her, 
and it would have been a pity she should 
have been discomposed, she felt in so per- 
fectly complacent a humour, flattered and 
soothed by the attentions of Villers, and 



191 

encouraged to hope from them, that by 
a little longer perseverance in the part she 
was playing, she should just be enabled 
to accomplish what she wished. 

Whether utterly mistaken in the sup- 
position, we leave time to disclose; so far, 
however, must be acknowledged, that 
Villers liked her better than he had ever 
done before, or ever thought he should, 
for she had not exactly struck his fancy at 
first ; but now, though he still certainly 
did not think her quite as handsome as 
she thought herself, he was beginning to 
think her a girl that might be liked â€” 
good-humoured, and sincere, and affec- 
tionate, and paid her the most marked 
attention, from the attention he was in- 
duced to believe she shewed Emily. 

Whenever they could converse apart, 
Emily was the constant theme, through 
his restless anxiety to have some plan 
struck out for rescuing her from further 
dependence ; but though he suggested se- 
veral he thought extremely feasible, there 
was still some difficulty or objection ak 



192 

ways started to them by Miss Somers, 
owing to her knowledge â€” yes, to nothing 
else in the world but her knowledge of 
poorEmily's unhappy temper. Poor thing ! 
she would not for any consideration have 
said any thing to her prejudice; but since 
Mr. Villers had thought proper to consult 
with her respecting her, it was impossible 
for her to avoid acknowledging, that really, 
with such a temper, she knew not how 
they could strike out any plan to serve 
her, so irascible, so sullen, so captious, 
and ready, at the slightest allusion to her 
situation, to flame out, and be offended. 
It had prevented her from doing a thou- 
sand things for her she wished â€” yes, really 
made her fear to shew her the kindness 
she desired. 

Villers was grieved to hear this â€” more 
than grieved ; it conveyed a feeling of dis- 
appointment to his heart. There was one 
certain way of preventing any further dis- 
tress to Emily ; but if her temper were 
such as had been represented to him, how 
could he excuse to himself his giving way 



193 

to his reviving sentiments of admiration 
for her ? No, he would not, by doing so, 
endanger his domestic happiness, run the 
risk of introducing discord into his well- 
regulated family, and disturbing the tran- 
quillity of his dear mother â€” no beauty, 
no fortune, no accomplishments, could be 
an equivalent â€” could compensate for tem- 
per ; and since Emily possessed not what 
was so invaluable, she must not â€” could not 
be more to him than she was ; yet he felt, 
even while he formed this resolution, that 
he must be miserable till he knew her se- 
cured from any further trials. 

In the meanwhile, she had no reason to 
complain of any inattention to her com- 
fort. The good old housekeeper, scarcely 
considered as a domestic, from the length 
of time she had been living in the family, 
took care to prevent any obtrusion in the 
apartment which she occupied with her, 
and managed so as to have her nice pret- 
ty little niece take all the trouble of the 
child off her hands; and Mrs. Villers

194 

herself often came to sit and chat a little 
while with her ; but she could not forget ; 
and though she did not murmur, she could 
not but regret. 

But though Miss Somers remained in- 
flexibly silent with regard to Villers, Emi- 
ly was not long without being led to be- 
lieve, that though he did not speak of her 
â€” for if he had, she was sure Miss Somers, 
who seemed so frank and communicative, 
would have told her â€” she was not alto- 
gether unthought of by him. It could 
not be for Mrs. Marjoram, who had her 
Encyclopaedia comprised in the scientific 
production of Hannah Glasse, that there 
was always such a variety of entertaining 
books in her apartment ; and that there 
should be such a thought for her, as to 
provide her with this amusement, soothed 
and gratified the mind of Emily. 

If a doubt of the books being purposely 
left for her had remained, it would have 
been dispelled by what occurred a few days 
after the idea had struck her of their being 
so. Entering the room abruptly one morn- 



195 

ing, where Emily was sitting with the 
housekeeper, the eye of Miss Somers was 
caught by a splendid edition of the last 
new work of lord Byron, which Emily 
had been reading, and only laid down on 
her entrance. Instantly darting on it â€” 
u Why, I asked Mr. Villers for this," she 
said, " the other evening, knowing he 
had just got it down from London, and he 
told me a friend was perusing it, and yet 
here it is !" But suddenly, after pausing 
a moment, during which she looked very 
thoughtful and extremely disconcerted â€” 
<fc I suppose it was sent up here for me," 
and she closed it, evidently with an in- 
tention of taking it with her. 

" No, it was not, Miss," cried Mrs. 
Marjoram, who could be both bluff and 
abrupt when she chose, and taking it very 
quietly out of her hand as she spoke ; 
" and no one must take it from this, till 
I do myself, to return it to the library." 

" Why, do you read poetry ?" asked 
Miss Somers, in a giggling tone. 
K2 



196 

" Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don't," 
returned the affronted housekeeper; "but 
be that as it may, this book sha'n't go 
hence till I choose." 

" Oh, well !" with a toss of the head, in 
her turn affronted, " I am sure I don't 
care a pin about it," cried Miss Somers ; 
" so, my good woman," flinging out of 
the room as she spoke, " you may keep it 
till Doomsday for me." 

" Marry come up !" cried Mrs. Marjo- 
ram, with her comely countenance a little 
discomposed, " I admire at some people 
thinking that no one can be thought of 
but themselves, when, if they knew but 
all, they'd find how mistaken they were. 
But finish your book, my dear," address- 
ing herself, in her usual tone of kindness, 
to Emily ; " yet if you took my advice, 
you'd take a walk first this fine spring 
day ; it will do you good, and bring back 
a little colour to your cheeks, and give 
you a little appetite, which, God knows, 
you want, for you eat nothing." 

" I should like it," said Emily, " but," 



197 

sighing, " you know Mrs. Somers always 
chooses I should sit by the child whilst he 
sleeps." 

" Bless my heart ! I shouldn't have 
thought of such a thing ! This is a fine 
way of bringing up a child, humouring 
all their whims, and making them grow 
up to be a plague and a pest to every one. 
I wish I had the management of little 
master, and I'd soon cure him of having 
a person to watch him while he sleeps ; 
but since it must be so, there is my niece; 
so do, my dear, put on your bonnet, and 
go out." 

Emily suffered herself to be persuaded ; 
she had long been wishing for a walk, but 
had hitherto resisted this wish, lest of any 
unpleasant encounter. Mr. Villers evi- 
dently sought to shun her, and since he 
did, be his motive for this what it might, 
she equally wished to avoid him ; but she 
had seen him going out for a ride this 
morning, and so conceiving there could 
be no danger of what she feared, she gave 
way to the good-natured Mrs. Marjoram's 



198 

entreaties, and her own inclination; for it 
was, as the housekeeper had said, a lovely 
spring-day â€” the voice of the turtle was 
again heard in the land, and there was all 
that freshness and genial warmth in the 
air that are indicative of teeming buds and 
springing flowers, and is so delicious to 
the feelings. 

All seemed indeed without to feel " how 
warm, how enlivening the sunbeams were." 
To pursue the quotation â€” " The birds, 
that had been silent for five whole months, 
now perched on the naked branches of the 
trees, looked up with a kind of joyful ado- 
ration to their enlivening deity, and began 
to plume themselves in his presence, and 
try their unaccustomed throats in songs of 
praise to him ; the very boughs on which 
they stood seemed to disclaim their late 
dead withered state, and, swelling out in 
ten thousand buds, promised soon to meet 
his radiance with a more cheerful aspect ; 
the little lambs, that had hitherto, since 
their birth, known no enjoyment beyond 
the supplying the calls of nature from the 



199 

cold wet herbage, now seemed to feel new 
motions in their blood, and new ideas 
with them, and by a thousand antic frisk- 
ings joined in the general joy." 

In this joy Emily could once have par- 
ticipated; but when, as she walked on, she 
thought of the parent she had lost at that 
period two years ago, without a hope now 
remaining of ever finding any one to sup- 
ply her place; and crossing the rustic 
bridge thrown across the stream, wound 
up, through the woods, to a round emi- 
nence rising amidst them, on which a mo- 
numental pillar was placed, and thence 
beheld the house spreading its white front 
and turretted wings to the view, backed 
by a hanging grove, and the sequestered 
meadows along the margin of the river 
stocked with sheep, and the neat cottages 
beautifully scattered amidst the green en- 
closures, and the general air of comfort 
and tranquillity that pervaded all, and 
was forced, by what she saw, to reflect 
on the domestic happiness she had lost 
through her own means, and the paradise 



200 

she had exiled herself from, her heart 
sunk within her, and nature appealed in 
vain to her senses ; and throwing her arm 
round the pillar for support, she leant her 
face against it, and wept bitterly; then 
raising her head, and uplifting her me- 
lancholy eyes â€” " Sweet spring !" she cried, 
repeating this beautiful sonnet of Drum- 
mond, so applicable at the moment â€” 

" Sweet Spring ! thou com'st with all thy goodly train, 

Thy head with flames, thy mantle bright with flow'rs ; 
The zephyrs curl the green locks of the plain, 

The clouds for joy in pearls weep down their show'rs. 

Sweet Spring ! thou com'st â€” but, ah ! my pleasant 
hours, 
And happy days, with thee come not again; 
The sad memorials only of my pain 

Do with thee come, which turn my sweet to sours. 
Thou art the same which still thou wert before â€” 

Delicious, lusty, amiable, fair; 

But she, whose breath erabalm'd thy wholesome air, 
Is gone, nor gold nor gems can her restore. 

Neglected Virtue ! seasons go and come, 

When thine, forgot, lie closed in the tomb." 

Tears were again falling, when some- 
thing like a suppressed breathing made 
her turn her head with quickness, and she 



201 

beheld Villers. Her confusion at disco- 
vering him so near her was unutterable. 
He had overheard her sighs, her regrets, 
then, and she knew not which way to 
look. He had heard, he had witnessed 
enough indeed, to touch him sensibly, 
and make him think it scarcely possible 
she could be what Miss Somers had re- 
presented her with regard to temper â€” 
that feeling so intensely, as it was evident 
she did, she could be so thoroughly un- 
amiable in this respect. Yet why should 
Miss Somers misrepresent her? what mo- 
tive could she have for doing her an in- 
jury? 

Villers was not vain, but the truth be- 
gan to dawn upon him ; and under the 
idea of injustice having been done the 
poor afflicted, he was gently taking her 
hand, with a look of mingled love, admi- 
ration, and pity, when Miss Somers sprung 
upon them. She knew of Emily's hav- 
ing gone out ; but as she knew Villers had 
rode out, it gave her no concern. When, 
k 3 



202 

however, she saw him very unexpectedly 
returning, and, instead of entering the 
house on alighting, hasten towards the 
path Emily had taken, she thought it 
high time to be on the alert, and ac- 
cordingly lost not a moment in following. 
At first she thought of joining him direct- 
ly, when anxiety to discover whether there 
was actually any appointment between 
him and Emily, as she began to fear, made 
her suddenly check her impetuosity, and 
just keep near enough not to lose sight of 
him. At length she began to feel con- 
vinced she had needlessly alarmed herself, 
but the consolation imparted by the idea 
was of short duration â€” she was springing 
forward to discover herself to Villers, when 
she beheld Emily, saw that he beheld her 
also, and in the emotion he evinced at the 
instant, all she had to apprehend. 

With the scorpion stings of envy and 
jealousy in her heart, she watched him to 
the spot ; then, unable to endure the idea 
of his giving utterance to what too plainly 
she perceived he felt, she rushed after him, 



203 

and assuming her usual aspect as she 
caught his arm, under the pretext of be- 
ing near stumbling â€” " My dear girl, I am 
so glad I have found you !" she cried, ad- 
dressing herself to Emily; " for my sister 
is quite mad that you should have ne- 
glected the poor babe so unkindly as you 
have done by coming out." 

" I did not neglect him," said Emily, 
her cheek deeply flushing, and in an agi- 
tated tone." 

" Oh, yes ! you know you did indeed, 
and " 

But Emily listened to no more â€” she 
turned abruptly from the spot, glad of a 
pretext to escape from Villers, yet hurt 
to the soul that her altered situation should 
thus be recalled to his view, by the humi- 
liation she had been compelled to submit 
to before him. 

" There, I suppose I have sent her back 
in a fine mood !" exclaimed Miss Somers, 
" merely for reminding her of her duty." 

" You certainly must have sent her back 
grieved to find herself in a situation so 



204 

every way unworthy of her," cried Villers, 
warmly; "but on this account I trust she 
will not much longer have any cause for 
regret." 

Miss Somers turned pale, and bit her 
lip with spite and vexation ; but trying to 
conceal what she felt â€” " Oh dear ! I am 
sure I hope so too," she said ; " no one 
can more wish than I do for her to get 
into a pleasanter situation; and I am sure 
it would give me the greatest happiness if 
she would allow me to assist in setting 
her up in some little business â€” a little ha- 
berdashery-shop, for instance, in some 
country town or village â€” don't you think 
it would be a good plan for her ?" 

" Oh, a most excellent one !" replied 
Villers, with a sarcastic smile ; " she is 
just the very being for selling threads and 
needles." 

" And her temper would there " 

" Be much less exercised, I make not 
the slightest doubt, than elsewhere." 

Miss Somers looked earnestly at him â€” 
she saw all was not right, and accordingly 



205 

thought it would be quite as well for her 
to change the subject; and so, for the thou- 
sandth time, she burst out into raptures 
about the beauties of his residence, pro- 
testing she could live and die with plea- 
sure in such a place. â€” " I do so dote in- 
deed upon green fields, and shady groves, 
and purling streams," she cried ; " but in- 
deed," and she cast her eyes on the ground, 
and tried to have it thought she blushed, 
" I was always of a sentimental and rather 
tenderly romantic turn." 

But all would not do â€” neither eulogi- 
ums on his seat, nor eulogiums on herself, 
nor gentle sighs, nor tender glances, nor 
trembling pressures on the arm on which 
she had fastened â€” the gentleman continu- 
ed as cool, and collected, and unmindful 
of all these fair openings for gallantry, as 
if it had been his grandmother that was 
walking by his side; and Miss Somers 
was most excessively provoked and ex- 
tremely disappointed, but still determined, 
if not on patience, on perseverance; and 
recollecting what had been said of the oc- 



206 

casion of the match between him and Miss 
Ockley being broken off, she suddenly 
began to evince the. greatest fondness for 
his mother, hanging upon her continually, 
and kissing her sleek white forehead, and 
protesting she put her so in mind of her 
own poor dear mamma whom she had 
lost, that she could scarcely help calling 
her mamma also. 

" Why then, Nelly " 

"Oh, horrible!" she almost screamed; 
"I beg, brother, you'll reserve that cooklike 
appellation for your servant, and give me 
my proper one of Elinor." 

" Why then, Elinor, I wonder," began 
her brother one day â€” a plain, blunt matter- 
of-fact man, that could never be suspected 
of any thing very deep or very daring, 
" how you can be saying this, when Mrs. 
Villers is so comely, and you know our 
poor mother was as thin as a whipping- 
post." 

" Lord !" she exclaimed, angrily and 
confusedly, " how ridiculous an observa- 
tion ! That's not what I meant ; I didn't 



207 

mean to say they exactly resembled one 
another in person, but in temper " 

" Temper !" repeated Mrs. Somers, and 
she laughed outright ; " why then I am 
sure it's no great compliment to Mrs. Vil- 
lers to say that, if 'tis true all you've told 
me about your mother; for you've said 
that she fretted the very flesh off her 
bones with her peevishness, and that, from 
her constant fretfulness, it was a happy 
release for you all." 

The rage of Miss Somers at this mal-a- 
propos disclosure was scarcely controllable. 
For a moment she was either unable to 
speak, or fearful of attempting it. Then, 
as she rose to leave the room, too much 
offended to remain longer in it â€” " I am 
sure 'tis fortunate for me," she cried, " that 
I am not much in the habit of saying any 
thing I care about, since I find what I do 
say is so liable to perversion and misrepre- 
sentation." 

Villers must have been much less pene- 
trating than he was, not to have seen what 
all this manoeuvring meant; but even 



208 

though the lady had continued to advance 
in his good opinion, as she had done on 
her first arrival, still this would have been 
far from enabling her to succeed in her 
aim with regard to him. This, however, 
was not the case; the moment he began 
to suspect her of having misrepresented 
Emily, that moment he had ceased to con- 
sider her any longer pleasing, nor could 
she in any way recover the ground she 
had lost ; yet he knew not for a short time 
what to think of her having actually mis- 
represented Emily, from something that 
occurred a short time after this. 

The family were engaged to a party 
one evening in the neighbourhood ; Mrs. 
Villers, not finding herself very well, de- 
clined going, and Miss Somers, nowise 
abashed from still affecting to dote on her, 
protested she would not leave her, and 
tea was just making, at which, to the sur- 
prise of both ladies, Villers made his ap- 
pearance â€” but he had some reason of his 
own for not choosing to go out that even- 
ing; when Mrs. Villers, turning to Miss 



209 

Somers, good-naturedly said â€” " Suppose, 
my dear, now that we are so snug and easy 
by ourselves, you go up for the poor girl 
above to come down to us ?" adding, that 
it often grieved her to the heart that the 
strictness of etiquette would not allow her 
always to have her of their party. 

" Oh, to be sure !" cried Miss Somers, 
jumping up with every appearance of joy- 
ous alacrity ; but changing her air on 
reaching the housekeeper's room, where, 
as usual, Emily was sitting â€” " Mrs. Vil- 
lers," in a languid tone she said, " has sent 
me up to bring you down to tea, as we 
are quite by ourselves, and no visitors are 
expected." 

Emily, who, with something of the joy- 
ous alacrity which Miss Somers had just 
so well counterfeited, had sprung from her 
chair to obey the invitation, instantly re- 
seated herself on hearing the conclusion 
of what she chose to say. â€” " No," she 
said, colouring violently, " I must beg 
shell excuse me; visitors may drop in, 
and I will not place her in the awkward 



210 

predicament she would then find herself 
in, were I with her." 

Miss Somers did not attempt to argue 
with her, but returning to the drawing- 
room â€” " Well, where is she?" demanded 
Mrs. Villers impatiently. 

" Oh, 'tis just as I thought it would 
be," replied Miss Somers, as she resumed 
her seat at the tea-table ; " the lady would 
not come indeed, because she had not had 
the compliment paid to her before." 

" Well, really," cried Mrs. Villers, quite 
in a pet, " this is being very unreasonable 
and captious, and a proof of a temper I do 
not by any means like." 

" Ah, poor thing ! it is her misfortune to 
have such an one," sighed Miss Somers, 
and she stole a glance, as she spoke, at 
Villers ; but he had walked to the win- 
dow, and was leaning against it, so she 
could not see his countenance : if she had, 
perhaps she might have been gratified, 
for she certainly would have seen displea- 
sure in it at the moment. He was indeed 
displeased that Emily should have made 



211 

so ungracious a return to the kindness of 
his mother, in whose good opinion he ar- 
dently wished her to stand high, for he 
had solemnly made up his mind to never 
marry any one whom the good lady could 
not think she should live happily with; 
and how could she think she could be 
happy with a person of an unfortunate 
temper? Yet did he really think serious- 
ly of Emily again? no, certainly net â€” 
no, by no means ; but there was no know- 
ing yet â€” she was so lovely, so interesting 
â€” yet, no, decidedly no ; he would never 
suffer himself to think either seriously of 
her, or any other person again, without 
first allowing himself time to study their 
character. He had once been betrayed 
into precipitancy, and he blushed when- 
ever he reflected on the circumstance ; but 
never again would he allow himself to 
give such a proof of the domination of 
his passions over him. No â€” all lovely as 
Emily was to the eye, all interesting as 
she now was to the heart, he must be con- 
vinced, beyond a doubt, that her temper 



212 

was not what he had again been painfully 
led to believe ; that the discipline she had 
gone through had not been exercised in 
vain, or she should never know of her re- 
viving power over him. 

But the next morning relieved him 
from a very unpleasant struggle with his 
feelings; for, in spite of his resolves, the 
idea of Emily kept clinging to his imagi- 
nation, and her image entwining itself 
about his heart. Happening to be in his 
mother's dressing-room, when the house- 
keeper came in to receive some ordersâ€” 
" I wouldn't have given you the trouble 
of coming here, Marjoram," said Mrs. Vil- 
lers, kindly, " but would have gone to 
you, as usual, but that I didn't like to run 
the risk of meeting that girl in your room." 

" Why, what has she done to offend ?" 
demanded Mrs. Marjoram, a little blunt- 
ly, in reply ; and who, it may be here ne- 
cessary to observe, was in a closet adjoin- 
ing her apartment, when Miss Somers en- 
tered it the preceding evening, and so 
overheard all that passed between her and 



213 

Emily. " Why didn't you hear?" asked 
her lady ; and she proceeded to tell her. 

" And you believed Miss Sorners again ?" 
demanded the housekeeper. 

" To be sure I didâ€” why shouldn't I ?" 

" Why, indeed I don't know, as I sup- 
pose you never detected her in an untruth 
before; but as that is not the case with 
me, I think I should have doubted her; 
and now you shall hear my story ;" and 
accordingly she told all she had overheard. 

Her lady uplifted her hands and eyes 
in utter astonishment at the baseness of 
Miss Somers, in thus misrepresenting to 
each party what the other had said. â€” 
" Well, to be sure," she said, " she must 
be a very bad young woman to tell such 
untruths; and how rejoiced I am, Marjo- 
ram, that I didn't go to your room and 
meet the poor thing there ! for if I had, I 
should certainly have huffed her, and after 
what I have now heard, I should have 
been so sorry to have done so." 

" Yes, I suppose you would. Poor 
thing ! she was so ready to go down to 



214 

you, till she was affronted by the rest of 
the message she thought you sent her; 
and no wonder, she that was born and 
bred a gentlewoman, to be told, indeed, 
that you would not have admitted her to 
your presence, only you expected no vi- 
sitors; no wonder, I say, that her poor 
heart should swell at it, and that she 
should cry as if it would break." 

Villers hearkened to no more ; he quit- 
ted the room in an agitation that could not 
have been concealed. â€” " Dear, suffering 
Emily !" he exclaimed to himself, " this 
must no longer be." Yet would Emily 
allow him to rescue her from further ills? 
would she indeed take refuge in the bosom 
that so fondly wished to shelter her? He 
shrunk from the idea of a second rejec- 
tion ; yet still more he shrunk from the 
idea of being accepted, without a corre- 
sponding passion on her side. 

He was abstractedly musing on the 
subject when he heard the voice of Miss 
Somers; and too much incensed against 
her to wish to encounter her at the mo- 



215 

ment, he hastily turned into a long pas- 
sage, leading in quite a different direction 
to that in which he heard her approach- 
ing, and running parallel with the picture 
gallery, and dividing it from several other 
apartments. Besides the two grand en- 
trances at either extremity to the gallery, 
there were some pannelled doors in this 
passage opening into it. 

As Villers was advancing, he perceived 
one of them pushed back a little, and in- 
voluntarily glancing through it, started 
with emotion, at discovering Emily with- 
in, busily occupied in taking a sketch of 
his portrait, which, executed by one of the 
first artists in London, had lately been 
hung up there. The timid look which 
she ever and anon cast around her, indi- 
cative of a fear of being surprised, evinced 
this being done by stealth, a I what mo- 
tive but one could she have for it? â€” one 
the most flattering, the most delightful to 
a lover's feelings. 

Enraptured, transported, he was ready 
to rush in, and throw himself at her feet; 



216 

but the delicacy due to her feelings made 
him restrain the ardour of his own; he 
would not pain the charmer by bursting 
in upon her at such a moment, while it 
put an end to all further irresolution about 
her. He would still conceal within his 
own heart the delicious discovery he had 
made of the secret of hers. But whilst 
he was thus watching her, and delighted- 
ly anticipating the interview he meant 
immediately to seek, another was watch- 
ing him. Miss Somers, who kept gliding 
about in every direction, like a castle spec- 
tre, had caught a glimpse of him as he 
was retreating to avoid her. She had 
previously learned from her maid, whom 
she employed as a spy upon her, as she 
could not watch both her and Villers at 
the same time, that Emily w T as in the gal- 
lery ; and on seeing Villers turn into the 
passage adjoining, it instantly struck her 
that there was an appointment there be- 
tween them. Impetuous as her feelings 
were, however, she w r ished, ere she gave 
way to them in this instance, to first ascer- 



217 

tain whether it was as she suspected ; and 
softly stopping for the purpose, where the 
recess of a door let her hide herself from 
Yillers, she soon found she was mistaken 
in the conjecture, but without deriving 
any consolation from the circumstance; 
the door at which she stopped also giving 
her a glimpse into the gallery ; and what 
the result was likely to be of Villers dis- 
covering Emily engaged in the manner she 
was there, instantly striking her. 

Maddened with jealous apprehension, 
she remained for a few moments irresolute 
how to act. Then thinking of a plan, she 
stole away to her chamber, to collect and 
recompose herself. 

Luxuriating in his own thoughts, Vfl- 
*lers was walking up and down the shrub- 
bery, about an hour after, when she sud- 
denly appeared before him. He involun- 
tarily stepped back on seeing her; but al- 
most instantly recollecting himself, and 
what, as his guest, was still due to her, 
suddenly checked his retrograde move- 
ment, and permitted rier to join him.

After a little desultory chat â€” " I have 
been thinking," she cried, " that really it 
is a pity, with her accomplishments, poor 
Emily should be in the situation she is 
now in. Every day discovers some new 
talent in her. It was but yesterday I dis- 
covered she had quite a turn for drawing; 
I was expressing a wish," here she sighed, 
and leaned a little more heavily on the 
arm on which, as usual, she had fastened, 
as if under the influence of some emotion 
that rendered support necessary, " for a 
copy of a portrait which I saw here, but 
which must be nameless, when she surpris- 
ed me, by saying, she thought she could do 
one for me, and this day set about the task ; 
and really, as far as I have seen of what she 
has already done, I think there is every 
probability of her executing it very faith- 
fully." 

Villers started, as if an envenomed sting- 
had penetrated his heart at the moment. 
What! was the rapturous belief he had 
given way to then erroneous? Had his 
vanity â€” his self-love, deceived and led him 



219 

astray ? He turned pale â€” his lip quivered ; 
and after a vain effort or two to appear 
collected, muttering something of having 
a letter to write, hurried the lady back to 
the house, and there parted from her. 

But again alone, and it was not long 
ere he recovered from the disorder into 
which she had thrown him. Treacherous 
as she had proved herself already in one 
instance, might she not be so in another? 
He knew what her aim was, and that for 
its furtherance she must know it was ex- 
pedient to prevent his imagining that a 
person he himself admired was attached to 
him ; and in the probability of finding the 
fact to be what it actually was, his heart 
became relieved and quieted, and his de- 
termination of seeking a speedy interview 
with Emily resumed ; this would put an 
end to all further doubts and conjectures â€” 
realize his hopes, or at once terminate 
them.

CHAPTER V. 



** Welcome, ye shades ! ye bowery thickets, hail ! 

Ye lofty pines, ye venerable oaks, 

Ye ashes wild, resounding o'er the steep ! 

Delicious is your shelter to the soul, 

As to the hunted hart the sallying spring, 

Or stream full-flowing, that his swelling sides 

Laves as he floats along the herbag'd brink. 

But something occurred to retard this de- 
termination ; from the gallery, after re- 
maining there as long as she thought there 
was no danger of being surprised there by 
any of the family, Emily went to indulge 
herself again with a walk. The tumult 
of her thoughts gave way to the quietude 
of the woods. The tranquillity of their 
walks calmed the throbbings of her anxi- 
ous heart, while the freshness and the 
beauty of the verdure charmed her. Fear- 
ful of approaching the spot where she had 
been the preceding day, lest if she did, 



221 

and should again meet Villers, her revisit- 
ing it might be imputed to a hope of a 
second encounter there with him, she now 
struck into quite a contrary direction. 

After straying about some time, she at 
last came to a sweetly-sequestered spot, 
where shaggy banks, steep, and divided 
by a babbling brook, invited her to sit 
down and repose herself, and listen to the 
tuneful birds, " and see how pleasantly 
they smile, and hear how chirpingly they 
talk." 

She had sat some time here, lulled by 
the vocal woods and waters into a kind of 
luxurious indolence, when, accidentally 
looking up, she beheld a gentleman, with 
a fishing-rod, on the opposite side of the 
stream, earnestly regarding her. She 
blushed deeply at being surprised in so 
abstracted a state, and, starting up, was 
moving from the spot, when, hastily cross- 
ing the stepping-stones in the brook, the 
stranger joined her, with a hope that he 
was not the means of driving her away. 

Emily distantly replied in the negative, 



222! 

and would then have shaken him off, but 
he was not so easily to be got rid of. 

Keeping by her side, he now and then 
forced her to speak, by his remarks on 
different spots, and by his proffering assist- 
ance, where, here and there, there was an 
impediment in the way, a steep bank to 
climb, or a rill to cross, or where the roots 
of the old trees had started above the soil. 
At length Emily, fearing he meant to go 
on to the house with her, and not wishing, 
by any means, to be implicated in an ad- 
venture, suddenly stopped, and telling 
him she had some way farther to proceed, 
begged he would not take the trouble of 
attending her any further. 

* Trouble !" he repeated, in a tone he 
meant to be reproachful ; " you must great- 
ly misjudge both yourself and me, if you 
think I can term it so," and he entreated 
she would not have the cruelty to prevent 
his going on with her. 

But Emily was inexorable, and forced 
to be more explicit than she had before 
been, so plainly told him it would be highly 



223 

disagreeable his persisting in walking any 
further with her, that he at last bowed, 
and drew back ; but glancing behind her, 
just as she reached the house, she saw 
he had traced her, at a distance, to it; 
however, if he chose to inquire after her, 
the situation in which she was in it, would, 
she conceived, be likely to prevent his ob- 
taining any satisfaction about her; and by 
not going out again for a day or two, she 
trusted she should run no risk of encoun- 
tering him again in her walks. 

Villers learning she had walked out, 
went out in quest of her, after he had re- 
covered from the disturbance occasioned 
by Miss Somers, but, missing her, was 
returning to the house, when he unex- 
pectedly encountered his gay neighbour, 
sir Marmaduke Sycamore, and they had 
some lively conversation together; and 
that day, after dinner â€” " I met your fa- 
vourite, ma'am, sir Marmaduke Sycamore, 
this morning," said Villers, addressing his 
mother; " and only he was most particu- 



224 

larly engaged, he would have dined with 
us." 

" Well, I am sure I should have been 
very happy to have seen him," said the 
good lady, " he is always so lively and 
good-humoured." 

" Yes â€” but great a favourite as you are 
with him, for love begets love, it would 
not be entirely on your account, my dear 
mother, he would have dined with us to- 
day. Don't be shocked or jealous," he 
proceeded, laughing; " but he encounter- 
ed a peerless beauty in the woods to-day, 
whom he traced hither ; and could he have 
given us his company, I shrewdly suspect 
the chief inducement would have been a 
hope of seeing her again." 

Villers knew that by some Miss Somers 
might be considered handsome; and so 
not knowing but it was her, instead of 
Emily, the baronet meant, and wishing to 
ascertain, he mentioned what he had said 
for the purpose. 

Miss Somers knew well enough she was 



225 

nut the admired fair one, but still could 
not resist the temptation of trying to in- 
duce Villers to believe she was, it might 
be such a means of raising her in his esti- 
mation ; and so catching his keen eye 
turned on her as he was speaking to his 
mother, she affected to blush and look 
down. â€” " And I am sure I could not have 
thought," she said â€” " and really I never 
imagined " 

" Why, what the deuce, Nelly," de- 
manded her brother, " was it you the 
gentleman meant ?" 

" Nelly ! There again," she screamed. 
** that hideous name !" 

M Hideous! Why, then, Nelly, I don't 
think you should be abusing, or finding 
fault with a name you got so much by 
having. Was it not because you were 
called after her, your godmother left you 
five thousand pounds? But come tell us, 
was it you this baronet meant?" 

" Me! Yes, it was me; and is there 
any thing astonishing in that ? Perhaps 
you are surprised." 

L 3 



226 

" Oh, not I ! every eye forms a beauty, 
you know; and many people, I know, 
think you a very good-looking girl â€” old 
Smithers in particular; the worst of it is, 
when you are getting oldish, but we wont 
say when that will be," and he laughed, 
" you will be apt to be getting fat and 
heavy." 

Miss Somers started up, and, with tears 
of absolute vexation in her eyes at the 
inuendo conveyed in these words, was 
leaving the room, when Villers, restored 
to even complacency of feeling towards 
her, from the belief that she, not Emily, 
as he had at first feared, was the object of 
the baronet's admiration, said something 
gallant, which, calming her perturbation, 
induced her to resume her seat. 

But he was soon undeceived with re- 
gard to the mistake she had led him into. 
The enamoured baronet got himself in- 
vited the next day to Ashley, expressly 
on account of the lovely stranger; and his 
look of blank disappointment, on being 



227 

introduced to Miss Somers, proved to Vil- 
lers the falsehood she had uttered. 

He had some little hesitation on the 
subject, and then decided on patiently 
waiting the issue of what had occurred ; 
the baronet, he was aware, was not of a 
temper to check his feelings, and the man- 
ner in which Emily received his declara- 
tion of admiration would, Villers reflected, 
be a satisfactory test of her sentiments for 
himself. 

Yet should he lose her, by putting her 
to this test, should unhappy circumstances 
prevail over her genuine feelings ; but, no 
â€” if she really loved him â€” really had that 
purity and delicacy of mind he wished to 
find the woman possessed of whom he 
made his wife, she would not be swayed 
by these; and he finally decided on abiding 
by this trial of her regard. 

Sir Marmaduke was not long in learn- 
ing the situation of Emily, and from that 
moment she became persecuted by him. 
He was one of those characters that con- 
ceive the rich and the poor cannot possibly 



228 

have feelings in common ; that money is 
quite an equivalent for the loss of reputa- 
tion to a person in an inferior rank ; and 
accordingly, from the moment he obtained 
a knowledge of her actual situation, he 
began to persecute her with the most in- 
sulting offers. 

This was the greatest humiliation her 
reverse of fortune had yet drawn upon 
Emily, and she felt it to the heart, more 
especially as she feared making any com- 
plaint on the subject, lest of embroiling 
Villers on her account, or inducing him 
to suspect her of some levity or indiscre- 
tion. Her tranquillizing walks were re- 
linquished, and she became a close prisoner; 
but this did not avail ; he had emissaries 
in the house, and she was continually an- 
noyed with his letters. 

At length, one evening, indirectly in- 
formed that he had a party at the house, 
she decided on taking advantage of the 
circumstance to go out. After straying 
about some time, she took possession of a 
pretty rustic temple, just where the river, 



229 

falling over some natural impediments of 
stone, formed a cascade, and was sitting 
admiring the splendour of the landscape 
in the setting sun, yet thinking, with bit- 
ter feelings, of the hastening moment, 
that would soon tear her from these lovely 
scenes, to immure her again within the 
smoke, the noise, the bustle, of a crowded 
metropolis, where nought but what was 
now sickening to her sad heart awaited 
her, when sir Marmaduke suddenly stood 
before her. 

Her immediate impulse was to fly ; but 
he hastily secured the door, and she be- 
came convinced, at the instant, that what 
she had heard of his having a party was a 
falsehood, fabricated for the purpose it had 
effected. 

Excessively alarmed at such perseve- 
rance, she was struggling to free her hand 
from him, which he had seized, on fas- 
tening the door, when she heard some one 
trying to enter, and the next instant saw 
Villers looking in at the window, to see 
who it was had bolted the door against 



230 

him. On perceiving her, she saw him 
start back, and immediately after turn 
away, as if with an intention of quitting 
the spot. 

Anxious at once to be released from her 
present situation, and convinced, if she 
allowed him quietly to depart, there would 
be but little chance of her clearing herself 
m his opinion, from the most injurious 
surmises, she no sooner saw this, than, 
rendered desperate by the idea, she abso- 
lutely dashed the baronet from her, and 
flying to the window, called upon Viilers 
not to go. 

He half turned â€” paused, as if hesitating, 
and then again approached the door. Sir 
Marmaduke could no longer refuse open- 
ing it, and, as he did so, Emily, rushing 
past him, fell almost against the arm of 
Viilers, as she told him of having been 
detained there against her will. 

The countenance of Viilers flushed to 
the deepest crimson, and for a moment 
there was a tremor in his frame, indica- 
tive of the most angry feelings. Then re- 



231 

collecting himself, and evincing to Emily 
his wish for her to depart, by leading her 
a few paces from the door, he returned to 
expostulate with sir Marmaduke on the 
impropriety of his conduct. 

Warm words ensued â€” sir Marmaduke 
had too much fashionable effrontery not to 
attempt vindicating his conduct, and Vil- 
lers sternly declared that he considered an 
insult offered to any one under the pro- 
tection of his roof as an insult to himself. 
But when, proceeding in his remonstrances, 
he was betrayed, by his exasperated feelings, 
into a full disclosure of Emily's story â€” 
the cruel tale of what her faithless fortune 
promised once â€” how immediate was the 
change in the baronet's manner ! His heart 
was not radically bad â€” on the contrary, 
though often led astray by the impetuo- 
sity of his feelings, and the force of bad 
example, there was still truth, and gene- 
rosity, and honour in it ; and to think he 
had been the means of insulting misfor- 
tune so overwhelmed him with shame, 
and regret, and remorse, that there was 



232 

no humiliation at the moment he would 
not have submitted to, by way of atone- 
ment, for the circumstance. 

The result of the reflections it gave 
birth to was a romantic determination 
(at least so it might, and probably would 
have been considered by his fashionable 
contemporaries), to make the amende ho- 
norable to the fair aggrieved, for his con- 
duct, by offering his hand to her accep- 
tance. He was completely master of his 
own actions, amenable to no control, and 
too wealthy to require any additional af- 
fluence : all that he required with a wife 
Emily possessed â€” youth, beauty, birth, 
accomplishments, and, above all (as he had 
contrived to obtain undeniable proof of), 
good principles; and the next morning, 
shortly after breakfast, Mrs. Villers receiv- 
ed a letter from him, with one for Emily, 
with his proposal in it, and an entreaty, 
after a full confession of his conduct, that 
she would intercede and interfere with her 
fair inmate for him. 

The good lady was all astonishment, 



233 

and for some time could do nothing but 
express this ; she then suggested to Villers, 
who, as well as Miss Somers, happened 
to be by, that, instead of going up to 
Emily, it would be better to send for her, 
as, till matters were all settled, it might 
be as well not to let Marjoram, with whom 
she was sitting, know any thing of the 
affair. 

Villers assented to the propriety of the 
suggestion, not so much, however, per- 
haps on that account, as from a wish to 
see, or rather ascertain at once, how Emily 
would receive this proposal â€” but a wish 
that was attended with fear and trem- 
bling. 

But if he was agitated by doubt, so was 
Miss Somers by spite ; she certainly wish- 
ed to get rid of Emily as a rival, but it 
was not by any means by having her ele- 
vated above her, and her complexion be- 
came absolutely jaundiced with envy at 
the thought. 

Little aware of the respective feelings 



she had given rise to in the minds of the 
party, Emily obeyed the summons of Mrs. 
Villers, but looking pale and ill, from the 
agitation she had suffered the preceding 
evening on Villers's account â€” an agitation 
that, sending her to her chamber, had 
been the means of preventing his having 
the immediate opportunity he wished of 
speaking with her. Mrs. Villers received 
her most kindly, and making her take a 
seat beside her, proceeded, after a little 
preface, to put the baronet's letter into her 
hand. 

The surprise of Emily on its perusal 
was unutterable. 

u Well, my dear," asked Mrs. Villers, 
after allowing a little time for this emo- 
tion to subside â€” " well, my dear," smiling, 
" are you or I to answer that letter?" 

" You, if you please, ma'am," replied 
Emily. 

" Well," smiling still more significant- 
ly, " and I may tell the baronet to come 
here whenever he pleases ?" 



235 

" Most assuredly, ma'am," again grave- 
ly replied Emily, " you must have that 
liberty, but not on my account." 

" Not on your account!" and she drew 
herself back a little, in order to be better 
able to survey her countenance ; " why, 
sure, my dear, you are not going to re- 
fuse him ?" 

" He honours me by his proposal," said 
Emily ; " and what has been so fully and 
generously apologized for, I wish not to 
think any more about, but it is not tny 
intention to accept it." 

" Not accept it ! not accept the propo- 
sal of sir Marmaduke Sycamore â€” a pro- 
posal that would make the hearts of so 
many girls of even assured fortune (you 
must not be offended, my dear) jump 
with joy ! Why, are you serious, or in 
your senses ?" 

" I hope so, ma'am." 

" Then indeed, my dear, there are 
people that might not think so on this 
occasion. And pray," bluntly, " what 
may be your reason for refusing this offer?" 



236 

" Perhaps I may have more than one," 
said Emily; " however, one shall suffice â€” 
I feel no predilection in favour of the gen- 
tleman." 

" Tut, tut ! this is all nonsense !" ex- 
claimed Mrs. Villers, impatiently, the 
good-natured anxiety she felt about Emily 
making her lose almost the command of 
her temper, at the idea of her losing such 
an opportunity of being rescued from her 
unhappy situation ; " people can be very 
happy together, without absolutely hav- 
ing love on both sides ; and indeed, in cer- 
tain situations (I must again desire you, 
my dear, not to be offended) it is quite 
ridiculous to hear them talking of any 
thing of the kind." 

Emily's cheek flushed deeply â€” " I be- 
lieve it is often considered so," she cried, 
" for the unfortunate to pretend to be any 
thing but automatons." 

Villers rose from his chair in much 
emotion, and for the first time in his life 
he looked angrily at his mother; but his 
resentment was but transient â€” he knew 



237 

her heart â€” knew her motives for speaking 
in this manner, and checking himself, re- 
sumed his seat, and throwing his arm a- 
cross the back of it, pretended to be oc- 
cupied with a newspaper, whilst in reality 
his very heart and soul were hanging on 
every word and look of Emily's. 

" The short and the long of it, then," 
Mrs. Villers abruptly said, " is, that if 
you do not accept him, you must be in 
love with some one else, my dear; for no- 
thing else could possibly make you so blind 
to your own interest ; come, confess â€” is it 
not so ?" 

Emily tried to laugh, but she was too 
cruelly embarrassed to be able; yet she 
endeavoured, spite of the fluttering of her 
conscious heart, to support the look she 
encountered; but when, glancing towards 
Villers, she saw his eyes fully, intensely 
bent on her at the moment, her own invo- 
luntarily sought the ground, whilst, if red be- 
fore, her cheek was now crimson, and " No" 
was just quivering on her lips, when again 
catching a glance from Villers, she read 



238 

in it something so tender, so impassioned, 
so beseeching, that, unable to utter the 
denying monosyllable, she abruptly start- 
ed up, and at once thanking Mrs. Villers 
for the interest she evinced about her, and 
expressing her hope that she would not 
ascribe her rejection of an offer she so 
much approved to any erroneous cause, 
precipitately withdrew from the apart- 
ment. 

" Yes, I see plain enough how it is," 
said Mrs. Villers, composedly resuming 
her spectacles and work as she withdrew, 
" it is clear enough she is in love with 
some one else. â€” Come, is it not so, xMiss 
Somers ? for, like almost all young people 
when together, I dare say you have been 
making confidants of one another." 

Miss Somers coloured with tumultuous 
joy, and she could have hugged the old 
lady for the suggestion. Eagerly catch- 
ing at it â€” " I don't deny that it has been 
so, ma'am," she said, " that we have in- 
deed opened our hearts to each other; 
but " and she looked down, and af- 



239 

fected, as if in confusion, to be playing with 
the strings of her reticule. 

" But what, my dear ?" demanded Mrs. 
Villers, a little impatiently ; " come, speak 
out â€” you know you are safe in any thing 
you tell us." 

" But then you know, ma'am, if I am 
under a promise of secrecy â€” so far, how- 
ever, I think, 5 ' hesitatingly, " I may say 
that you are not mistaken in your conjec- 
ture, ma'am â€” there is indeed an attach- 
ment â€” an " Here she paused for a 

moment, owing to some sudden movement 
of Villers at the instant, and then resum- 
ing â€” " an unfortunate attachment; but 
more I must not disclose." 

" An unfortunate attachment !" repeat- 
ed Villers, evidently in some little agita- 
tion of spirits ; " and why do you consi- 
der, pray, the attachment you suspect your 
friend of, an unfortunate one ? : ' 

" Because I consider," replied Miss So- 
mers, calmly, " that she is trifled with." 

" Trifled with !" exclaimed Villers, em- 
phatically, and colouring violently. 



240 

" Yes, certainly â€” that there is nothing 
serious at the other side." 

u And pray, may I ask your reason for 
entertaining â€” so erroneous an opinion," 
Villers was on the point of adding; but 
checking himself, he merely said â€” " such 
an opinion ?" 

" Why, because the gentleman has ne- 
ver yet come to any serious explanation 
with her, though perfectly his own mas- 
ter, and aware of her attachment; and the 
conviction that he never will, has made me 
argue a thousand times on the subject with 
her. It is scarcely probable that a person 
of his exalted rank, his ancient title " ' 

" Title !" repeated Villers, in a faltering 
tone, and changing colour â€” " title, do you 
say ?" 

" Yes, but you must not ask me what 
â€” I can't indeed tell that," and it would 
indeed have been a very difficult matter 
for her to have done so. 

Villers, without attempting to urge her, 
hastily rose, and retreated to the study. 
He had not taken many turns here, ere 



241 

his perturbation began to subside. Again 
he reflected that those who are capable of 
falsehood or deception in one instance, are 
capable of it in another ; he knew the la- 
dy's views â€” he knew, for the furtherance 
of them, she had already asserted what was 
not true; and under the idea of her hav- 
ing again done so, he gradually recovered 
his composure. To put an end to any 
further doubts or disquietudes, however, 
he resolved to delay no longer coming to 
an explanation with Emily. She had fair- 
ly borne herself out through the test he 
had put her to, that is, she allowed him 
to see, by her rejection of the baronet, 
that she was not to be swayed by ambi- 
tious or pecuniary motives; and all that 
now remained was to ascertain whether 
her sentiments for him were what he had 
allowed himself fondly to imagine. At 
first he thought of seeking an immediate 
interview ; but lest he should be fated to 
disappointment â€” lest, after all, what Miss 
Somers had said might, in this instance, 

VOL. III. M 



242 

prove to be correct, he changed his mind, 
unwilling that even Emily should witness 
the feelings which, in this case, he feared 
he should betray, and addressed her as 
follows : â€” 



" To Miss St. Orme. 

" Unable longer passively to en- 
dure the tortures of suspense, I throw 
myself upon the generosity of Miss St. 
Orme, to relieve me from what is so tor- 
menting. I would solicit a conference, 
but in my present incertitude I have not 
courage to ask it. This evening, the mo- 
ment I can break away from our guests, 
I shall be on the lawn before the windows 
of the room in which she sits, and shall 
then (with what anxiety !) look for some 
look â€” some signal, to let me know what 
I have to hope or fear, and according to 
which I shall act. Yet let me â€” but no, I 
will not entreat, assured, from my know- 
ledge of her feelings, that she will not 
trifle with mine. All I shall add is, that 



243 

whatever I can picture to myself of feli- 
city would be comprised in calling her 
mine ; and that be her sentiments for me 
what they may, she must ever possess the 
regard of her devoted 

" Villers." 



The letter wrote, how to have it deli- 
vered to her was the next consideration, 
as he had manv reasons for not wishing it to 
go through the hands of any of the family. 
At length he decided on placing it in a 
book he knew she was reading, could he 
but get unperceived to the housekeeper's 
apartment. By dint of watching he was 
enabled, as he thought, to do this, and in 
a degree felt his mind easy ; as he thought, 
we say, for he was watched to the very 
spot. 

Miss Somers, all agitation and anxiety 

to know what would be the result of the 

suspicion she had endeavoured to excite, 

gave her maid a hint to be on the alert, 

M 2 



244 

and accordingly, gliding about in every 
direction, Villers was traced to the house- 
keeper's room, and, from one adjoining, 
observed depositing the letter there. 

The moment he was withdrawn, the 
trusty abigail, emerging from her conceal- 
ment, pounced upon it, like an eagle upon 
its prey, and hurrying with her prize to 
her mistress's apartment, received an im- 
mediate recom pence for her dexterity. 
The lady then set about the perusal, and, 
with the most wrathful and malignant 
feelings, found her apprehensions of Vil- 
lers being seriously attached to Emily 
confirmed. For a few minutes she was 
too completely disconcerted by the cir- 
cumstance to be able to rally herself; she 
then desperately decided on running every 
risk, rather than tamely submitting to the 
disappointment of her own hopes concern- 
ing him. Emily once out of the way, and 
she had the vanity to imagine there could 
be but little doubt of their accomplish- 
ment. 

Determined by this illusive idea, she 



245 

set her brains to work, and quickly de- 
cided on a method she conceived likely to 
effect her purpose. In pursuance, imme- 
diately after dinner, she pretended to be 
taken extremely ill; and saying she would 
try what lying down for a little while 
would do for her, precipitately withdrew, 
not to her chamber, but to the house- 
keeper's room, where she found Emily 
alone. Knowing that Mrs. Marjoram was 
gone out about some business of her lady's, 
she had come, she said, to have a little 
unrestrained chat with her, and according- 
ly some time passed in conversation, when 
Emily suddenly noticed Villers walking 
up and down before the windows, and at 
the same time Miss Somers saying, the 
sun was extremely troublesome, darting 
in so at them, desired -Emily to let down 
the curtain of the one she was sitting op- 
posite to. 

Emily hesitated to obey her; she saw 
the looks of Villers directed towards the 
windows, and saw in them a solicitude â€” 



246 

an anxiety, that, giving her a suspicion of 
the fact, made her reluctant to do what 
might be misconstrued into an intimation 
of displeasure at his appearing to wish to 
engage her notice. 

Miss Somers, finding she hesitated, very 
impatiently, but without allowing it to 
be known she knew why she did so, re- 
peated her command. 

Emily slowly began to undo the cord 
by which it was drawn up ; she sighed, 
for Villers, catching a glimpse of her at 
the instant, looked so full of meaning, so 
tender, so imploring, that she knew not 
how to seem anxious to shut herself from 
Ills view ; she cast a timid glance at Miss 
Somers â€” she saw she was keenly observ- 
ing her, and the curtain began to descend; 
but ere it had got above two or three 
inches, she was beginning involuntarily 
to restrain it, which Miss Somers perceiv- 
ing, and out of all patience, jumped up, 
and, ere Emily had time to prevent her, 
but without being seen from without, 



247 

whipped away her hand from the cord, 
and thus made it fall abruptly in the face 
of Villers. 

He had not expected this so abrupt, 
so decided an intimation that he had no- 
thing to hope for, and for a moment the 
pang of disappointment was indeed severe; 
then collecting himself, he retired from 
the spot. Yes, in no other light than as 
the signal he had requested by his letter, 
to let him know what he had to hope or 
fear, could he consider what had happened. 
Well, it w r as something to be out of sus- 
pense; he did not know 7 how it was, how- 
ever, that his being relieved from it did 
not, in the present instance, afford him 
all the relief he had expected. But a short 
absence from home would set all matters 
to right again. Mr. Somers was gone to 
view the woods he had come down about ; 
so there was nothing to prevent this, and 
his horses were accordingly ordered to be 
got ready, and, apprising his mother of 
his intention that night, he set off by an 
early hour the next morning. 



248 

Meanwhile, no sooner had Miss Somers 
ascertained his having returned to the 
house, than, recovering her apparent com- 
placency â€” " I wish, my dear creature," 
she cried, addressing the greatly, discon- 
certed Emily, " you would leave pacing 
the room about in this manner, for I want 
to speak seriously to you." 

" Well, I am attentive then," said Emi- 
ly, turning to her. 

" The fact is then, my dear girl," pro- 
ceeded Miss Somers, " I think it right to 
let you know the sentiments of Mrs. Vil- 
lers. At first I thought of being silent on 
the subject, from delicacy to your feelings; 
but, upon consideration, I think that would 
be a very false delicacy, and so I have de- 
cided on being candid. In the first place, 
then, she is convinced that your rejection 
of sir Marmaduke is owing to an attach- 
ment to another person ; that that other 
person is her son ; and that your coming 
here with Mrs. Somers was for the sole 
purpose of trying to revive that passion 
he once entertained for you, and which, if 



249 

she disapproved of then, as unquestionably 
she did, she must, of course, doubly dis- 
approve of now, not only from the un- 
happy reverse that has taken place in your 
circumstances (don't be offended, my dear), 
but her entertaining views for him with 
regard to somebody else, that shall be 
nameless ;" and here, with what she con- 
ceived a pretty air of embarrassment, Miss 
Somers looked down, and tried to have it 
thought she blushed. 

Emily started, changed colour, and, for 
a few minutes, was violently agitated. To 
be suspected of the meanness, the forgetful- 
ness of herself, of which, as she was led to 
believe, Mrs. Villers accused her, was in- 
deed wounding to every feeling; and if 
Villers thought the same; but, no â€” his 
looks, his manner, testified the contrary. 
The persuasion of this, however, was not 
sufficient to reconcile her to the idea of a 
longer continuance in the house; and as 
soon as she had recovered from the emo- 
tion occasioned by Miss Somers, she in- 
M 3 



250 

formed her, that if Mrs. Somers meant to 
make a much longer stay, she should re- 
turn to town without her. 

This was just what Miss Somers wanted, 
and eagerly catching at the idea â€” " Then 
I am sure she does mean to do so," she 
cried; " but by to-morrow I shall be able 
to let you know ; and indeed, after what 
I heard this morning, much as I shall miss 
you here, I cannot urge your continuance." 

Emily sighed bitterly, and tears started 
to her eyes; she had hoped for a little 
longer respite from the privations that a- 
waited her in London â€” a little longer en- 
joyment of the quietude of nature ; but it 
was not to be, and she tried to submit 
calmly to her fate. But if she had wa- 
vered in her resolve of quitting the house 
without further delay, she would have 
been decided the next morning, when in- 
formed by Miss Somers of the departure 
ofVillers; and that his leaving home so 
abruptly, was for the express purpose of 
proving to his mother she was mistaken 
in supposing him attached to her. 



251 

Pride alone enabled Emily to over- 
come the pang she endured at this intima- 
tion, and the same feeling made her avow 
her determination of departing directly. 

Miss Somers highly applauded it; but 
to let her return to London was not by 
any means her intention â€” she had another 
scheme in view ; there chance might again 
throw her in the way of Villers, and meet- 
ings and explanations might ensue, that 
might as dexterously undo what she had 
been doing, as the hand of Penelope ever 
undid her web; and so she decided on 
fairly getting her out of the kingdom, if 
possible. She had a confidential friend 
settled in Dublin, and to her she had writ- 
ten that very day about her, and now 
mentioning her to Emily, and reminding 
her how often she had heard her express 
a wish for visiting Ireland, she proposed 
giving her a letter of introduction to her. 

Emily hesitated; she had wished â€” she 
did wish to see Ireland, the birthplace of 
her parents â€” the land of her forefathers ; 
but then to enter it a solitary stranger! 



252 

Yet, comparatively, what else was she now 
anywhere? and she finally consented to 
accept the proposal, induced by the re- 
flection of the many mortifications her do- 
ing so might perhaps be the means of 
saving her. 

No sooner had she signified this, than 
Miss Somers set to work, and so adroitly 
managed matters, terrified lest Villers 
should unexpectedly return, as not only 
to get her off that very evening, but pre- 
vent any private conference between her 
and Mrs. Villers. 

The nearer the moment for departing 
approached, the heavier became the heart 
of Emily ; yet it was not the idea of going 
among strangers that entirely oppressed 
it â€” that of leaving the place where she was 
equally affected her. Yet why, she ar- 
gued with herself, but in vain, this con- 
cern for leaving a place where she could 
no longer flatter herself with being an ob- 
ject of interest to any one? Still she 
clung to it â€” still felt the same sensations 
at quitting it, as if a home. 



253 

Yet while she thus grieved at quitting 
it, how soon should she be forgotten in it ! 
Formed for domestic life, it was not prob- 
able that Villers would much longer con- 
tinue single; and then indeed, if even 
now his thoughts for a moment dwelt on 
her idea, how utterly would new ideas, 
new images, new associations, banish it 
for ever from his mind ! 

But that Miss Somers would be the 
person instrumental in effecting this, she 
could not believe. No, with regard to 
him, she could not exactly credit her as- 
sertions ; for though she still continued to 
consider her a good-natured, rather well- 
meaning kind of girl, there was evidently 
too great a dissimilarity between them to 
allow her to imagine he ever thought se- 
riously of her, notwithstanding her asser- 
tion to that effect. There was an elegance 
in the mind of Villers that extended itself 
to whatever he was concerned in, and to 
which there was nothing in the mind of 
Miss Somers that corresponded. 

Yet what, after all, was it to her whom 



254 

he married, since alike would be the con- 
sequence to her â€” utter exclusion from his 
thoughts ? The coach in which she was 
to pursue her journey to the Head took 
her up at the park-gate, and till she had 
seen her into it, Miss Somers never lost 
sight of her. Emily could have wished 
to have been left a little while to herselfâ€” 
could have wished to have been allowed, 
by herself, to take leave of the delightful 
shades she was quitting ; but it was not an 
indulgence to be granted her. 

More dead than alive, feeling as if she 
was torn away from all that could ever in- 
terest her, she reached the Head ; a packet 
was just ready for sailing ; and going on 
board immediately, she took refuge in her 
birth from the curiosity and observation 
she saw she had excited. 

A lady and gentleman, whom her deep 
dejection, and apparent want of protection, 
had greatly interested, kindly brought her 
up in the ehaise with them to Dublin, 
and dropped her at the house of Mrs. 
Mellefont, in Rutland-square, to whom 



255 

she found she was introduced as a young 
person wanting to turn her abilities to ac- 
count. 

We shall pass over her sensations at 
finding herself at length in the birthplace 
of her parents^-finding herself there under 
circumstances so very different from those 
under which she had once fondly imagin- 
ed she should have found herself, without 
a friend to welcome her â€” a hope of notice 
or attention. 

As soon as the bewildering effect which 
the manner in which she had been hurried 
away from Ashley, and the rapidity with 
which she travelled, had produced upon 
her mind, was recovered from, she exerted 
herself to make some inquiries after the 
few remaining connexions of her parents, 
but without deriving any gratification 
from the circumstance; on the contrary, 
it was an aggravation of her sorrowful 
feelings to learn that they were all scat- 
tered and dispersed, their possessions pass- 
ed into other hands, their ancient seats 
mouldering to decay, and, literally, almost 



256 

the places that had known them knowing 
them no more ; and this was the family, 
now to the dust gone down, on which she 
had so vaunted herself; and tears â€” tears 
of renewed bitterness at what she had lost, 
through the silliness of her pride, gushed 
from her. 

But she was not long allowed to indulge 
uninterruptedly in useless lamentation. 
Mrs. Mellefont had taken her under her 
patronage, and greatly disliking that any 
one in her service should eat the bread of 
idleness, she gave some gentle hints that, 
recalling Emily to a sense of her depen- 
dent situation, aroused her also to the ne- 
cessity of exertion. 

Mrs. Mellefont, in the course of a year 
or two after her marriage, had become a 
widow, and was now just throwing aside 
her weeds, with no kind of objection what- 
ever to the idea of a second choice. Her 
circumstances were not quite as affluent 
as the world in general imagined, but this 
she chose to keep to herself; and for the 
purpose of carrying on the deception, kept 



257 

up the same expensive establishment that 
had been kept up in the lifetime of her 
husband, to whose country she had got so 
attached, that, for the present at least, she 
did not mean to quit it. She was in ge- 
neral reckoned a very charming woman, 
possessed of so much taste and sensibility, 
and then gave such divine entertain- 
ments. 

To superintend and arrange all matters 
relative to these was her chief object in 
engaging Emily ; but it was with a deter- 
mination of always keeping her in the 
background she did so â€” a determination 
which Miss Babillard, a friend who resided 
with her, highly approved of; protesting, 
when once these kind of humble compa- 
nions were brought forward, they got so 
assuming and presuming, there was no 
such thing as enduring them. 

What Emily felt or thought she con- 
fined to herself; and certainly, if constant 
employment could have been of service, 
she should have been benefited ; but some- 
how it so happened she got paler and 



258 

thinner every day. No notice however 
was taken of this ; Mrs. Mellefont never 
noticed any one by whom she was not in- 
terested, and how could a person with 
whom she scarcely ever conversed interest 
her exquisite feelings ? 

Some time passed away, and there be- 
gan to be a great talk of the king's com- 
ing over that summer, and all began to be 
preparation, and expectation, and joy ; and 
it seemed to Emily to be no tear but of 
her shedding â€” no sigh but of her breath- 
ing. 

Villers had long been meditating a visit 
to Ireland, and he now decided on it ; yet 
not so entirely from curiosity, or a wish to 
witness the delighted feelings of a loyal 
people, at the first royal visit paid to their 
shores in amity, as to make certain inqui- 
ries, suddenly prompted by some very 
unexpected discoveries. 

Learning that Mrs. Mellefont would 
either be able to answer or assist him in 
these, he obtained a letter of introduction 
to her ; but not from Miss Somers, through 



259 

whose means, however, he was already so 
well known to her, that his reception from 
the lady was of the most flattering descrip- 
tion. 

She was indeed quite charmed at hav- 
ing this opportunity of becoming acquaint- 
ed with a person of whom she had previ- 
ously heard so much, and found him so 
perfectly answering every idea she had 
formed of him, that she began to feel a 
very strong inclination to rival her friend ; 
this inclination at once decided her on si- 
lence as to the subject of his inquiries ; but 
lest her giving him no satisfaction what- 
ever should prevent the intimacy she wish- 
ed for, she artfully pretended, that though 
not in her power now to give him the in- 
formation he required, yet she made no 
doubt it would shortly. 

This artifice succeeded. Allured by 
false hopes, he was a daily visitor, but still 
without obtaining any satisfaction. His 
arrival was a month previous to the royal 
visit, and shortly after Mrs. Mellefont re- 
paired to a beautiful villa she had in the 



260 

county of Wicklow, and urged him to be- 
come her inmate. This however he re- 
fused ; but delighted with the beauty of 
her neighbourhood, and still in expecta- 
tion of receiving the information he wish- 
ed for from her, he paid her many visits 
here. He was one of the party at a very 
elegant entertainment she gave one day, 
commencing with a dejeune on the lawn, 
and which commanded a fine view of the 
adjacent and enchantingly diversified 
country. 

The conversation, as usual on such oc- 
casions, was lively and desultory. Mrs. 
Mellefont exerted all her agremens to ren- 
der her guests pleased and pleasing ; and 
only to have seen her now, one would 
have thought she was all made up of smiles 
and sweetness. She could however frown 
occasionally, and even raise her voice a 
little louder than might have been ima- 
gined; but then these variations of hu- 
mour were only shewn to those whose 
situations, it must be supposed, deadened 
all the delicate sensibility of their nerves. 



261 

But as she conceived there would be no 
particular attraction in what any body 
might be (namely, good-humoured), she 
resolved on also letting Villers know, on 
the conquest of whose heart she was now 
decidedly bent, that she was as rare in 
her endowments as amiable in her tem- 
per. The removal from her own mansion 
to his would be so pleasant, and then, be- 
sides, a means of also freeing her from 
some little embarrassments, in which she 
had contrived to get herself involved since 
her husband's death ; and accordingly she 
gradually introduced the subject of paint- 
ing; and on Villers being forced to com- 
pliment her on the judiciousness of her re- 
marks, though perfectly aware they were 
all borrowed from different treatises on 
the subject, and declaring he was confident 
from them she must be an adept in the 
art, she desired a servant to go to Em for 
her last-finished performance â€” a copy, she 
added, with a half-languishing and down- 
cast look of love animating indifference. 
But she had not the gratification of shew- 



262 

ing this performance; her messenger re- 
turning to say, that Miss Em, as he chose 
to style the person he had been sent to, 
had desired him to inform her that she had 
not had time yet to finish the drawing 
she wanted. 

" Finish it !" repeated one of the party ; 
"why howis this, Mrs. Mellefont? I thought 
it one of your own doing." 

" Oh yes, certainly ! that is," stammering 
and colouring violently, " all the principal 
parts. What I left to be executed by 
this girl was so trifling, as really to make 
me -wonder at her assurance in sending 
such a message, so indicative of what is 
false." 

" Well, no matter," said a gentleman 
who sat near her, " people sometimes," 
and he smiled a little slyly, " arrogate to 
themselves what they have no right to, 
it is so delightful, so gratifying to vanity 
and self-importance, to be thought a talent- 
ed person. To make amends for the pre- 
sent disappointment, treat us with that 
divine air on the harp with which you 



263 

enchanted me so much the other even- 
ing.Â» 

Mrs. Mellefont stared. â€” " What air, or 
what evening, did he mean ?" she demand- 
ed. 

" The evening before last, when, though 
I was in an excessive hurry to town," he 
added, " I stopped for a full half-hour un- 
der your window to listen." 

" Oh ! ay, now I recollect â€” yes, cer- 
tainly, I should be delighted to oblige you ; 
but the fact is, I have hurt my right hand 
a little." 

Her fair friend burst out laughing. â€” 
" The fact is," said she, " she is not per- 
fect in it ; for it was Em you heard, who 
assuredly is a most enchanting performer." 

" And pray who is Em ?" was the al- 
most general inquiry ; " is she some one 
Mrs. Mellefont has got here to play the 
part of the Invisible Girl ?" 

" Pshaw, nonsense!" exclaimed Mrs. 
Mellefont, peevishly. " Miss Babillard 
speaks so much at random, that one should 



264 

not mind what she says. The person you 
inquire about is in the capacity of humble 
companion here, and just does every thing 
in that mechanical way that people who 
acquire accomplishments for their support 
generally do." Then, evidently anxious 
to give a turn to the conversation, she 
proceeded to demand of Villers whether 
he was fond of dramatic representations ? 
adding, she had prepared a petite piece 
for the entertainment of the evening, 
which she hoped would meet with his ap- 
probation. 

Villers bowed, and, as he saw was ex- 
pected, said something complimentary; 
and the lady proceeded to give him the 
programme, describing the piece as one 
taken from the Belle Assemble of madame 
Gomez, representing the adventures of an 
uncle and nephew, who, shipwrecked on 
a wild coast, discover, in a fair savage of 
the place, a daughter of one, and an object 
of love and admiration to the other; and 
who, after encountering innumerable dan- 



265 

gers, are, by a lucky chance, transported 
back again to the gay and luxurious re- 
gions of France. 

" Really I do believe it might excite 
some interest," said Miss Babillard, " could 
Em have been prevailed on to play the 
part of La Belle Sauvage" 

" How flattering !" cried Mrs. Mellefont, 
in a tone of disdain, " when you know, 
as you do, I have undertaken that my- 
self 

" True, I do speak giddily, to be sure; 
but there really is something so mutably 
wild in the looks of Em, that I really 
think she would have been quite the thing 
for it : she has all the lightness and fresh- 
ness of youth too about her, such as would 
certainly favour the illusion of the scene ; 
for, in my opinion, a person should look 
as well as act a character ; and then, as she 
composed the "

posed a ramble through the grounds, the 
repast being by this time over. No one

266 

objected ; and fastening upon Villers, she 
sought, by every art in her power, to 
heighten the admiration she was begin- 
ning to flatter herself, through the com- 
pliments she had extorted from him, she 
had inspired him with. 

Had the gentleman been really inspired 
with this, she certainly gave him every 
opportunity he could desire for expressing 
it, continually contriving to detach him 
from the rest of the party. From one of 
these innumerable digressions they came 
very suddenly upon their companions, just 
as they were entering a picturesque cot- 
tage in the midst of a delightful shrub- 
bery, and overlooking a rapid stream, a- 
cross which a ledge of rock formed a ro- 
mantic bridge, to deep woods at the op- 
posite side, whilst, pouring through natu- 
ral chasms, concealed by thickets, the 
stream formed a beautiful waterfall. 

A young woman was busied within, 
fastening up the curtains of white and rose- 
coloured muslin, that decorated the long 
French windows with wreaths of flowers. 



267 

Mrs. Mellefont started, as if through sur- 
priseJ^St seeing her there, and evidently 
much disconcerted, made an immediate 
attempt to prevent the company from en- 
tering; but in vain â€” Miss Babillard hur- 
ried them forward, and she and Viilers 
followed. Xo one, however, noticed the 
young woman, nor did she appear to no- 
tice any one, still continuing to stand with 
her back to the company, as if wholly oc- 
cupied by what she was about. 

Mrs. Mellefont perceiving this, began 
to recover from the confusion she had been 
in, and to shew Viilers the drawings that 
ornamented the place, but still glancing, 
from time to time, behind her. Her tem- 
per at last got the better of her caution, 
and in a tone of the sharpest asperity, she 
imperiously exclaimed to the person above 
alluded to â€” " What are you about there? 
don't you see that you have given no dra- 
pery to that curtain â€” that you have drawn 
it as tight as a Quaker's cap ?" 

No answer was returned, neither any 
X2 



268 

attempt made to alter what she disap- 
proved of â€” on the contrary, the person 
she addressed seemed moving from the 
window ; upon which, exasperated beyond 
all patience, Mrs. Mellefont flew to it, and 
gave a pull to the curtain, that dragged 
it, together with the cornice, on her head. 

For a moment she stood overwhelmed 
with shame at the violence she had be- 
trayed, then, becoming still more enraged 
with the person to whom she imputed 
having exposed herself in this manner, she 
pushed her violently away, and bade her, 
in the most authoritative tone, send in 
some one who better understood what she 
had attempted than she did, with her ob- 
stinacy and stupidity. 

" Lord, my dear ! how can you be in 
such a fury ?" said Miss Babillard ; " I am 
sure poor Em is neither obstinate nor stu- 
pid ; but really you are enough to fright- 
en any one." 

Poor Em, however, as Miss Babillard 
called her, without attempting any vindi- 
cation of herself, and still contriving, by 



269 

the aid of a large bonnet, to keep her face 
from being seen, was quitting the place, 
when, either through the agitation she 
was thrown into, or else the manner in 
which she kept looking down, in order to 
avoid the eyes of any one, she overthrew 
a china vase in her way, and smashed it 
to pieces. 

Mrs. Mellefont now absolutely scream- 
ed with rage, protesting she had done this 
by design, not accident, and accordingly 
she should either make her reparation for 
it, or lose her protection. 

The agitated girl, without replying, 
made her escape, and several of the party 
now began to interfere and intercede for 
her â€” Villers in particular, who said, if 
Mrs. Mellefont would permit, he could 
readily repair the loss she had sustained, 
as he had recently made a purchase of 
some very beautiful china vases at Wor- 
cester, two of which he would be most 
happy to send her on his return to Eng- 
land. 

Mrs. Mellefont, as selfish as she was ir- 



270 

xitable, readily consented to accept the 
present ; and imputing the wish to make 
it to the motive most flattering to herself, 
her brow directly cleared, and again smil- 
ing, she protested she was quite sorry â€” 
vastly so indeed, for the little warmth 
she had just been betrayed into; but there 
was a cool insolence about the girl in ques- 
tion, that really did often provoke her out 
of all patience; however, she should no 
longer regret the accident that had just 
iiappened, as it allowed her to receive an 
obligation where it would be delightful to 
be obliged. 

Villers bowed, but, with an internal 
smile, thought how little she would have 
been gratified, had she known what was 
then passing in his mind respecting her. 

From the cottage they proceeded to a 
grotto, forming a kind of vestibule to the 
theatre, a shady walk connecting them, 
which, at night, she informed them, was 
to be illuminated. The grotto was di- 
vided into two apartments ; but on at- 
tempting to open the door of the inner 



271 

one, in which Mrs. Mellefont said there 
was some curious shell-work worth being 
seen, she found it locked ; and calling to 
one of the gardeners to open it, was told 
by him that Miss Em had just locked her- 
self in there. 

- " Impertinent !"' exclaimed Mrs. Melle- 
font, relapsing into passion, " but it is no 
-matter â€” I shall take care she dares not 
take such liberties again." And then, mo- 
tioning for those who had followed to move 
back, was quitting the place, without 
making an effort to have the door opened, 
when Miss Babillard, pushing past her, 
knocked at it, desiring Em to open it im- 
mediately. 

" No, by no means," cried Mrs. Melle- 
font, as if in some alarm ; " Miss Babillard, 
I really wonder " 

'â€¢' Lord, my dear! don't either wonder 
or scold any more," returned Miss Babil- 
lard ; " I am determined to rest here. So 
come, Em, open the door." 

For a moment she was not obeyed ; the 
door then slowly opened, and the perse- 



272 

cuted girl came forth; but, no longer 
striving to conceal her face, what was the 
utter astonishment of Villers, after the re- 
peated denials he had received from Mrs. 
Mellefont of knowing any thing about 
her, at beholding Emily ! 

" Good Heavens ! she here," he exclaim- 
ed, involuntarily turning his eyes from 
her on Mrs. Mellefont, " after all your as- 
sertions â– " 

Mrs. Mellefont was, for a moment, con- 
founded; then summoning all her cou- 
rage and her audacity to her aid â€” " Why, 
is it possible," she cried, in a tone of sur- 
prise equal to his own, and looking with 
a stare, " that this is the person you were 
so anxious about ? I really never should 
have thought " and she had the ef- 
frontery to declare that Emily had intro- 
duced herself by a fictitious name to her. 

Villers, however, knew the contrary â€” 
knew by whom Emily had been intro- 
duced to her, and that no deception had 
been practised, and, in utter contempt of 
her falsehood, turned away from her, pro- 



273 

voked to think how long he had been her 
dupe â€” how much she had trifled with his 
feelings ; but her motives for this were 
evident : her advances indeed were too 
glaring to permit him to remain long in 
ignorance of her aim â€” an aim which, even 
if there had been no Emily in the case, 
she never could have had the remotest 
chance of succeeding in. 

From her his eyes again fell upon Emi- 
ly, who, though pale, and almost of sha- 
dowy thinness, had never looked to him 
more lovely, more interesting; and unable 
to control his feelings of heightened love 
and admiration, when, after bowing slight- 
ly to the party, and calmly expressing her 
regret to Mrs. Mellefont for having been 
the occasion of so much disturbance, she 
was preparing to retire, he made an effort 
to catch her hand ; but, shrinking back, 
she avoided his touch, with such a look of 
recoiling disdain â€” of scornful reproach, as 
chilled his very soul, and turned of an 
ashy hue the cheek which, the moment 
N 3 



274 

before, had been crimsoned with the rich 
glow of joyful surprise; and ere he had 
recovered from the consternation she had 
thrown him into, she was gone. 

But conscious that he neither me- 
rited her disdain or scorn, and believing 
her not to be capricious, it was not very 
long ere he recovered from his alarm, un- 
der the conviction of some artifice having 
been the cause of what had occasioned it, 
and which accordingly induced him, as 
soon as he became collected again, to seek 
an interview with her. But quick as he 
was in seeking this, Emily was gone. Mrs. 
Mellefont, clearly perceiving there w r as 
but very little chance of succeeding in her 
designs upon him, if she permitted them 
to meet, slipped away unperceived by 
him, and hastening to Emily, told her, 
after what had passed, she could not permit 
her to remain another minute in the house; 
so that by the time Villers inquired for 
her, she was on her way back to Dublin. 

But in leaving the mansion of Mrs. 
Mellefont, she had no other regret than 



275 

what she felt at having suffered a feeling 
of resentment towards him, to make her 
treat Villers as she had done. She soon 
learned his arrival in Ireland, and disco- 
vered the terms he was on at Mrs. Melle- 
font's ; and presuming he had heard where 
she was, could form no other conclusion, 
from never understanding that he inquir- 
ed after her, but that he now held her 
either in too much contempt or indiffer- 
ence to do so, and could not, in conse- 
quence, avoid a feeling of resentment and 
indignation. 

But, when pursuing her solitary jour- 
ney back to town, she came calmly to re- 
flect on the past, she bitterly regretted 
the indulgence she had given this feeling, 
from the conduct it had led to. What 
right had she to seem angry with Villers 
for not appearing to have remembered 
her ? and how little was her evincing this 
calculated to revive any sentiment of es- 
teem for her in his bosom ? Yet how 
eon Id she reconcile the idea of being now 
utterly indifferent to him, with the joy 



276 

lie had manifested at beholding her â€” a joy- 
accompanied by surprise ? Surprise ! and 
why should he have been surprised at see- 
ing her, when he knew she was with Mrs. 
Mellefont ? But did he know this ? A 
suspicion of the truth began to flash upon 
her mind, and, under the idea of having 
wronged him by the previous supposition 
she had entertained of his having forgot 
her, she thought, with heightened regret, 
amounting even to agony, of the petu- 
lance she had betrayed towards him. Oh ! 
if his mind still harboured any lingering 
regard for her â€” if at all on her account he 
had come over, how might this petulance 
have undone her! 

In intolerable anguish she wrung her 
hands â€” " Oh ! am I fated then for ever 
to be the destroyer of my own happi- 
ness !" she cried; " after all I have suffered 
through hasty feelings, is it thus â€” thus I 
still suffer them to have dominion over 
me?" 

But might he â€” would he not be apt to 
make allowances for the captiousness of 



277 

feelings rendered still more sensitive â€” 
more keenly susceptible through misfor- 
tune ? But a short time would determine 
this ; if it proved to be as she wished, he 
would not be long in seeking her out. 

Through a servant of Mrs. Mellefont's 
she obtained a small lodging contiguous to 
one of the northern outlets. Here her hours 
were past in listening to every sound, un- 
der the idea of its being the voice of Vil- 
lers she might hear inquiring for her, or in 
listlessly wandering about, when all expec- 
tation of seeing him for that day was over. 
Every day this became fainter and fainter, 
till at length it was utterly relinquished. 

What then, when no longer buoyed up 
by this hope, was the utter sinking of her 
heart ! how terrible, how unbearable her 
feelings, at the forlornness of her situa- 
ation ! how horrible the dread that over- 
whelmed her shuddering spirit at the pro- 
spect that was before her â€” the chilling 
prospect of dragging on her existence a 
solitary individual, unknown, unconnect- 
ed, unregarded ! 



278 

Almost unconsciously she passed over 
one of the contiguous bridges one even- 
ing, and walked onwards towards the 
country. After passing through a little 
obscure village or two, she got into a so- 
litary road, when suddenly she heard a 
cry of sorrow, and looking up from the 
ground, on which her eyes were cast at 
the moment in deep rumination, she found 
it was a wail for the dead, from a group 
of three or four women, who were de- 
scending the bank at the moment from 
the ruins of an old church, where they 
had been burying an infant. 

A little girl was skipping on before 
them, making use of the spade with which 
they had been digging the grave to assist 
her in jumping. As they came down the 
bank, Emily turned up it, and making her 
way through the briars and brambles that 
were thickly matted over the old forgotten 
graves, stood there observing them. The 
mother was in bitter sorrow â€” " And must 
I leave you here ?" she cried, casting up 
her eyes towards the desolate spot she had 



279 

just left, where already the howlet was 
beginning its hootings in the clustering 
ivy that mantled over the place; " he 
nestled warmly but a night ago in my 
bosom, and now must he sleep in the cold 
earth !" 

F Ah, then, Molly ! what's the use of 
going on in this way ?" cried one of her 
companions ; " isn't it being kilt you'll be 
with grieving so ? So come along, jewel, 
come along, for I must be going, for Pat 
will be the death of me, if I am not at 
home when he comes from the wall." 

" And so must I too," said the other; 
" for there's Tom Lawrence's wake at 
Raheny, and sorrow bit of himself, or any 
of them that would be for giving me, if I 
wasn't to be after going to it." 

But the mourner resisted their efforts 
to draw her away from the spot â€” " No," 
she said, " no, I can't go yet a while ; but 
do you go, and take little Peggy with 
you, and I'll follow soon." 

After a few more arguments they con- 
sented, and the moment they were gone, 



280 

seating herself on the bank opposite the 
churchyard, she again abandoned herself 
to unrestrained grief. 

Deeply affected, Emily, at length see- 
ing her nearly overcome, went to her â€” 
" Can I be of any service to you ?" she 
said, offering her a smelling-bottle as she 
spoke. 

Raising her head from her hands, as she 
leant her elbows on her knees â€” U No, 
Miss," she cried, " no," after looking at 
her for a moment, " nothing will do me 
good but crying," and again she gushed 
into tears. 

" I know what you grieve for," said 
Emily, " and I do not wonder at your 
grief; but could tears recall your little in- 
nocent, how uncertain is it, in such a 
world as this, that you would have reason 
to rejoice at the circumstance ! My mo* 
ther," and Emily involuntarily seated her- 
self beside her, " would have cried had 
she lost me ; but had she known what 
was before me, she would have cried still 
more bitterly at my being spared." 



281 

Her voice was so gentle, so soothingâ€” 
the arguments she continued to pursue so 
reasonable, so persuasive, that gradually 
the poor woman's grief became calmer, 
and at length, heaving a deep sigh â€” 
" You have done me good, Miss," she 
cried, " by your speaking, and God bless 
you, for your feeling so much for the sor- 
row of a poor stranger !" 

She now no longer hesitated to quit the 
spot ; and as they walked on together, 
Emiiy became still more interested by her, 
from the manner in which she conversed. 
On reaching her home, a small neat house 
nearly opposite one of the bridges, she in- 
vited Emily to walk in, and rest herself; 
and Emily, anxious to remain out as long 
as possible, from the absolute horror she 
felt of returning to her solitary lodging, 
accepted the invitation, and was shewn 
into a neat drawing-room, commanding a 
fine view of the Dublin and Wicklow 
mountains, and of the city, apparently 
stretched at the feet of the former. â€” " Oh, 
how much I should like to be here!" in- 



m 

voluntarily exclaimed Emily, charmed 
with the grandeur of the prospect, and 
pleased with the gentle manners of the 
poor woman of the place. 

The latter eagerly caught at the idea, 
saying that floor was to be let, though no 
bill was up, owing to the grief and con- 
fusion she had been in about her little boy 
â€” " But then I am afraid, Miss," she add- 
ed, " there wouldn't be accommodation 
here for you and the friends you are with, 
for, to be sure, you are not by yourself?" 

Emily's sick heart sunk within her â€” 
" I am an orphan," she said, and she turn- 
ed aside her head, to conceal the bitterness 
of her wo. 

The sorrow it was now evident she was 
in, only served to render the sympathetic 
Mrs. Murphy more anxious to have her 
with her. Matters were soon arranged 
between them, and the next day Emily 
removed to her peaceable abode, from 
lodgings that she had found dreary, and 
gloomy, and disagreeable in every respect ; 
.arid for a few days the change was of ser- 



283 

vice; her spirits then again sunk â€” the 
grandeur of the illumined mountains, the 
hum of the city, the murmurs of the 
waves, the plaintive cry of the curlews, 
failed to charm, or amuse, or soothe. 

The contemplation of her frightful si- 
tuation could no longer be prevented, and 
with a shrinking heart she saw, that if 
she wished to save herself from the fangs 
of absolute want â€” worldly want, that 
keenest and most frightful of human evils, 
with her sore and bruised spirit, her sub- 
dued strength, and declining health, it 
was still absolutely requisite she should 
make exertions, give up the quietude of 
solitude, to be again the slave of unpity- 
ing caprice. 

Shrinking from the thought, she began 
to turn in her mind, whether she could 
not have recourse to her pen for support ; 
but, alas! with her perturbed and dis- 
tracted thoughts, how impossible was it 
for her to frame a work of imagination ! 
Yet still she hoped she should be able to 
compose them sufficiently for the purpose, 



284 

and in this idle expectation day after day- 
wore away. 

At last the king arrived, and she had 
the unexpected delight (for even to her 
sad and isolated heart it was a delight to 
witness his arrival where he had been so 
long and ardently expected) to see him pass. 
During the whole of the day, after her re- 
turn from church, she had observed more 
than an usual bustle about the roads, and 
heard rumours that his majesty was ex- 
pected to pass that way, but which, ow- 
ing to the arrangements made for his land- 
ing at Dunleary, she gave no credit to; so 
that when the joyous sounds that rent the 
very air gave notice of his approach, she 
was completely agitated by surprise. The 
glad tidings were quickly caught; the 
Park guns, the opposite battery, the peal- 
ing bells, proclaimed them, and all was 
rapture and gratulation; but the excite- 
ment given to her spirits was but tran- 
sient : when, the next day, she beheld 
every one flocking to the Park, and found 
herself without a friend to invite her forth, 



285 

how did her sick heart again sink within 
her ! â€” how did the crowded cars of joyous 
beings she saw passing by, force upon her 
desponding imagination the forlornness of 
her situation ! 

All hope of now seeing or hearing any 
thing more of Villers was over; yet when 
the royal departure was announced, at 
which time she supposed he would take 
his, now concluding he had come over for 
no other purpose than to witness the re- 
joicings for the royal visit, the chilling 
pang she felt, like that of deadly disap- 
pointment, would almost have led to a 
contrary belief. 

Heartless, hopeless, she was dragging 
her failing limbs along, from a solitary 
ramble she had taken on the evening of 
the king's going aboard, unable, from the 
feverish restlessness of despair, to remain 
still, though with hardly strength for the 
exertion of going out, when she was start- 
led, by observing a man lurking behind 
some bathing-machines she was passing at 



286 

the moment, and, for the first time, now 
become sensible of the imprudence she 
was guilty of in staying out so late as she 
was now in the habit of doing. She tried 
to rally her strength, for the purpose of 
hastening on; but when she considered 
the loneliness of the road, not a house be- 
ing then in view, and the utter hopeless- 
ness of being able to escape him, if he 
chose to overtake her, the effort was use- 
less, and she began to totter. At this in- 
stant she heard him spring across the road ; 
but the next " Emily â€” Miss St. Orme," 
pronounced by the voice of Villers, re- 
called her fleeting senses. 

" Good God !" and for a few minutes 
she could utter nothing more. " You 
still here?" she then added, and uncon- 
sciously she laid her hand upon his arm 
for support. 

* Yes, so you may perceive," he cried, 
smiling, and pressing her hand, and fond- 
ly kissing it. H But why so surprised at 
this being the case ?" 



287 

" Why, I thought â€” I imagined, when 
there was nothing to attract or interest you 
here " 

" I should be gone. Well, and you 
thought very justly ; if there had been no- 
thing still to attract and interest me here, 
I should certainly, even before this, have 
taken my departure." 

There w r as an expression, a look of 
meaning in his eyes, as he uttered this, 
that made the heart of Emily flutter. She 
blushed â€” she looked down â€” she began â€” 
but, no, she would not give way to hope 
again â€” hope that had so often proved klle 
and delusive to her ; and trying for com- 
posure, she proceeded to inquire for his 
mother. 

They began to walk on, Emily endea- 
vouring to converse ; but her thoughts so 
busily employed in wondering what had 
brought him at such an hour to the soli- 
tary beach, and what he had alluded to 
when he said there was still something to 
interest and attract him in the place, that 



288 

she often became silent without knowing 
it. 

At length they reached her abode, and 
Emily saw him glancing his eye over it, 
and she felt something like an unpleasant 
sensation as she saw him do so; yet she 
could not surely be so absurd as to feel 
mortified at his seeing her in such a resi- 
dence, after what he already knew of the 
change in her condition; yet she could 
not help feeling a little pain and confusion 
at the idea, that he might expect to be 
asked in, and of having no proper refresh- 
ment to offer him. 

This however he did not; for on her 
hesitatingly asking him to walk in, on the 
door being opened, he said â€” " No, not 
to-night; but to-morrow I shall certainly 
call; for as I shall soon be leaving this, I 
must have a little conversation with you." 

Soon leaving this ! Oh, what a death- 
like chill did these words throw upon her 
feelings! Soon leaving this! and then 
would end for ever all further acquaint- 



289 

ailce â€” all further intercourse between 
them. She had hardly power to ascend 
to her solitary chamber, where, throwing 
herself upon the bed, half the night passed 
away ere she could prevail on herself to 
make an effort to retire to repose. 

Endeavouring to conceal the wretched- 
ness of her feelings under a sickly smile, 
she received Villers; she saw him look 
earnestly in her countenance, and she 
blushed slightly at the misery she feared 
he read there. Nothing, however, escaped 
him to allow her to imagine he noticed 
any thing particular, and perhaps she was 
a little hurt to find him more lively and 
entertaining than she had ever before 
found him. 

Yet why should she expect him to sym- 
pathize in her feelings ? How could she 
expect, after all that had occurred, that 
he could feel a very lively interest about 
her? Yet why had he come then ? What 
did he want to converse with her about ? 
and in thinking and wondering, she often, 

vol. iil o 



290 

as on the preceding night, became si- 
lent. But she was soon roused from her ab- 
straction, through the malice of Mrs. Mel- 
lefont. In continual dread of Villers dis- 
covering her, from his indefatigable exer- 
tions for the purpose, she decided on try- 
ing to do something that might be a means 
of driving her from Dublin; and accord- 
ingly employed a medical man, who had 
attended her during a dangerous fit of ill- 
ness she had at her house, to importune 
her for the debt incurred by his attend- 
ance on her, well aware of her not then 
having the ability to discharge it, as well 
as contrary to her promise of taking it 
upon herself. 

His foreman arrived whilst she and 
Villers were conversing, and being ushered 
up stairs, introduced himself, with his 
master's bill, accompanied by a peremp- 
tory request, at the suggestion of Mrs. 
Mellefont, for its immediate discharge. 

Emily turned pale, and trembled with 
dismay and confusion, at a demand so un- 
expected, and pressed for before Villers ; 



291 

she endeavoured to draw the messenger 
from the room, but in vain ; and she was 
faltering out an apology for not being then 
able to settle with him, when Y filers, 
suddenly starting up, said, that since he 
saw she was then engaged, he would in- 
trude no longer upon her, but return at 
tea-time, in the evening, and hastily took 
his leave. 

The moment he was gone, she began 
to recover herself; and telling the man he 
might rely, in the course of the day, on 
her calling on his master, begged he would 
then retire. He hesitated; but on her 
trembling lips repeating the assurance, and 
his reminding her, that if she did not keep 
it, she would be put to a great deal of un- 
pleasant trouble and expence, he took his 
leave. 

The moment she had got rid of him, 
Emily hastened to her trunk, and taking 
from it the only memorial that now re- 
mained of former happy days, a beautiful 
locket, given to her on a birthday by 
o 2 



292 

Mr. Elmore, and prepared to go out to 
dispose of it, as the only way by which 
she could obtain what she required ; but 
invincible was the reluctance with which 
she thought of parting with it ; she kissed 
it â€” she bedewed it with her tears â€” she 
pressed it to the sad bosom on which it 
had so often rested, when that bosom was 
calm and joyous, and the remembrances 
it excited rived her very soul with anguish ; 
but precious as it was, from the remem- 
brances connected with it, it must go â€” 
must pass into the hands of those who 
would set no other value on it than what 
it derived from being an ornament; and 
dashing away her tears, she put on her 
bonnet and shawl, and disposing of it at 
the first jeweller's she came to, repaired to 
the apothecary's ; but what was her sur- 
prise, when, on asking for his bill, he in- 
formed her it was paid ! 

"Paid !" she repeated ; " and by whom ?" 
" I am not at liberty, ma'am, to tell," 
he replied. " But by the time you get 
home, you will find your receipt there*" 



293 

Emily paused, mused, reflected, and 
the truth then flashed upon her mind. 
Yes, it was Villersâ€” -the generous, the 
feeling Villers, that, in this quiet, this de- 
licate way, had relieved her from the em- 
barrassment she was under. But while 
her heart glowed with gratitude â€” with 
heightened love and reverence for him, 
yet even to him she would not owe an 
obligation of the kind; and accordingly, 
the first thing she did on seeing him in 
the evening, was to return him the notes 
he had parted with for her. â€” " Ere I an- 
swer you, as to how I passed the day," 
she said, with a forced smile, " I must 
settle a little business with you ; for you 
cannot deny having been concerned in ar- 
ranging some for me," and as she spoke, 
she put the notes into his hand. 

With an impatient â€” " Pish !" and 
sudden contraction of his brow, he crushed 
them, and, thrusting them into his waist- 
coat pocket, went to the window, where 
he remained for some minutes without 
03 



294 

speaking; then turning to her, with re- 
sumed cheerfulness, he began to converse 
as usual ; but every moment expecting to 
hear him say this would be his last visit, 
Emily had neither heart nor power to keep 
up a conversation, nor strength enough 
almost to support herself. 

Tea at length was over, and a silence of 
some minutes after made the very soul of 
Emily almost faint within her, at the idea 
of his being then about announcing what 
she dreaded to hear. This however was 
not the case; suddenly drawing his chair 
close to hers, and resting his arm upon 
the back â€” " I have been long wanting," 
he cried, f to inquire of you after your 
friend, Miss Somers. Pray, may I ask 
when you heard from that interesting 
young lady ?" 

" Interesting!" Emily mentally repeated, 
and looked up in his face. " Not very re- 
cently," she replied, " indeed, but once 
since my coming over, and that immedi- 
ately after my arrival." 



293 

" Yet she professed a great regard for 
you." 

" Yes." 

" Her not writing oftener is no great 
proof of it, however." 

" Why no; but then she goes out so 
much, that " 

" I see you are inclined to make excuses 
for her; but no wonder, from the great 
regard you have for her; for you must 
have had a great regard to place such un- 
bounded confidence in her as she asserted." 

" Unbounded," repeated Emily, colour- 
ing scarlet deep. 

"Yes, so she said," and he laughed very 
maliciously, Emily thought, at the pertur- 
bation into which it was evident to him 
he had thrown her. 

" I don't know that she had a right to 
say that," conscious indeed that she had 
never disclosed to her the secret of her 
heart, although fearful she might have pe- 
netrated it, and thoughtlessly revealed it. 

Villers looked at her for another minute, 
with an expression in his countenance that 



296 

still more flattered her, then â€” "Well, not 
to teaze or perplex any further," he cried, 
" the fact is, Miss Somers was not, I be- 
lieve, deserving, in any degree, either of 
your confidence or regard ; circumstances 
have lately transpired to excite such a be- 
lief. There is a homely saying, that when 
knaves fall out, honest men come by their 
right; so, when accomplices in treachery 
quarrel, the truth transpires. Miss So- 
mers had a quarrel with her maid, and in 
revenge for the indignity she conceived 
offered to her, the incensed demoiselle be- 
trayed every thing she was privy to; and 
the confidence placed in her by her lady, 
for the purpose of obtaining her assistance 
in various schemes, was indeed unlimited. 
The result was a conviction that you were 
indeed deceived by what Miss Somers pro- 
fessed for you ; as a proof of which, was 
her possessing herself of a letter addressed 
to you, and keeping it back, but which, 
through her accidentally dropping, through 
the confusion and agitation of guilt, fell 
again into the hands of the person it came 



297 

from, but without their then suspecting 
the trick played about it. I fancy â€” yes, 
I was right," taking out his pocketbook, 
and examining it â€” "here it is;" and as he 
spoke, he presented a letter to her, and im- 
mediately rising, walked to the window. 

Amazed, agitated by what she heard, 
wondering who it was could have address- 
ed a letter to her at Ashley, Emily eager- 
ly opened it, and as eagerly ran her eye 
over the contents. With these the reader 
is already acquainted ; it was the identical 
letter, as of course has been guessed, that 
Miss Somers contrived to get into her 
possession through the dexterity of her 
confidant. What the sensations of Emily 
were at the moment may easier be con- 
ceived than described ; and " Good God ! 
this letter â€” this letter," with her cheek 
flushing with transport, "had Miss Somers 
the cruelty to conceal !" she involuntarily 
exclaimed. But scarcely had she done 
so, ere conscious of all she had betrayed 
by the exclamation, she knew not which

way to look â€” where to hide herself to 
conceal her confusion. 

" Yes, she had the cruelty," cried Vil- 
lers, turning quick from the window, and 
catching the expression, with transport in 
his looks ; " she had the cruelty to attempt 
separating hearts destined, I trust, to ren- 
der each other happy ;" and he caught 
the trembling, almost-fainting Emily in 
his arms, and kissed her varying cheek, 
and called her his own, his dear â€” his be- 
loved Emily. 

When mutual emotion had subsided, 
mutual explanations took place ; and the 
heart that had so long been chilled by de- 
spair, again became warmed and reanimat- 
ed by joy ; and Emily now learnt that he 
had come over purposely on her account, 
and that it was his determination never 
to have returned till all hope of finding 
her out was relinquished. His mother, 
he added, was informed of his sentiments 
for her, and impatient to receive and em- 
brace her as a daughter.â€”" And as such,

my Emily," he fondly said, " will not long 
delay letting me have the felicity of pre- 
senting her to her." 

Delay ! â€” no ! How could she delay the 
blissful moment that was to give her the 
delightful assurance of again belonging to 
some one â€” of again being an object of in- 
terest in the creation, and tasting the 
sweets of domestic happiness ! Two or 
three days after this, their marriage was 
solemnized at a neighbouring church, and 
immediately after, they sailed for Eng- 
land, where Emily was indeed received 
with transport. How delicious were her 
tears â€” her feelings at again finding herself 
clasped to a bosom glowing with maternal 
tenderness for her ! " Oh ! this â€” this, in- 
deed," she cried, as she raised her humid 
eyes with gratitude to Heaven, " is a re- 
compence for the past â€” a happiness that 
compensates for all I lost !" All, indeed, 
that through her own means she had lost, 
was won back through her proper convic- 
tion of the errors that had plunged her 
into misery.

But her least cause of gratulation was 
not the ample power she now had of evin- 
cing to her paternal friend the affection 
and gratitude she owed him. Letters 
were immediately addressed to him by her 
and Villers, inviting him over immediate- 
ly to take up his future residence with 
them â€” an invitation he readily accepted ; 
for his heart had long been yearning to 
return to his native country, whilst, at 
hearing of the unexpected reverse in the 
condition of her whom he loved as a child â€” 

" One bright gleam 

Of setting life shone on his evening hours; 

Not less enraptured than the happy pair, 

Who, we hope, may flourish long in tender bliss, and rear 

A numerous offspring, lovely like themselves, 

And good â€” the grace of all the country round."

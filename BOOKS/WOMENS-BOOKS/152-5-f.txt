A HE keeper entered abruptly^, and to the 
astonishment of Osmond, informed him he 
was free. Osmond demanded of him to 
whom he was indebted for his discharge ? 

'' I have no time to waste in telling you 
particulars/' replied he, in a surly accent; 

VOL. V. B " to

*^' to know you have got it, might satisfy 
you, I think/' 

Osmond asked no further questions, nor 
delayed returning to the hotel, accompa- 
niied by his friend, the Duke D'Angou- 
moise; but by no means as happy at his 
unexpected restoration to liberty, as might 
have been expected. The idea of its being 
owing to the interference of Mactalla with 
the Duke D'Amalfi, entirely damped the 
pleasure it was calculated to afford him. â€” 
In this idea he was confirmed the moment 
he cast his eyes upon his valet, whom he 
found in his drawing-room. 

'' So, Sir,'' said he, '' I perceive you 
have thought proper to disregard my or- 
ders." 

''Well, I confess I have, Signor," re- 
turned Mactalla ; '' but I am sure when 
you give yourself time to reflect, you must 
acknowledgeit would have been surprising 
if I had not â€” surprising, if I had let you 
remain in a damp dungeon, when I knew I 
ciould get you out of it ; and, moreover, 

that 



THE DISCARDED SON. 3 

that the Marchesa Morati and Count Pla- 
centia, who gave yoUj in a manner, as one 
may say, into my care, would never for- 
give me, if I had acted otherw ise." 

'' A pretty light/' cried Osmond^ who, 
notwithstanding his vexation, was scarcely 
able to suppress a smile at this latter asser- 
tion, '' you must have made me appear 
in to his Excellency." 

'' In as handsome a light as you could 
desire, Signor â€” I know his Excellency inti- 
mately, as I believe I have already men- 
tioned, so I went to hirn. I told him 
plump that I had comiC out of my own head, 
(which, to be sure, was no lie,) to borrow 
three hundred poujids for you ; as through 
my forgetting your portmanteau at Venosa, 
in which was the principal part of your cash, 
you w^ere put to very great inconvenience 
for that sum, your pride being too great to 
allow you to borrow^ of any one, which I 
knowing, I had made bold to wait upon 
his Excellency, to ask it of him, taking it for 
granted he would be hap^^y to have an op-* 
X i^ portunity

portunity of conferring a favour on a person 
to whom his friends and relations at Ace- 
renza were under such great obligations; 
Count Placentia being certainly indebted 
to you for the preservation of his life and 
the right use of his senses â€” ' Aye^ aye, so 
he is/ cried the good Duke; 'and there 
is nothing, on that account, which I would 
not do to serve the Chevalier, your mas- 
ter ; so take this purse to him/ presenting 
me one, in the most handsome and gentle- 
manly manner possible, * and give him 
my compliments, and I will have the plea- 
sure of calling on him in the course of the 
day/ ' That I will, an please your Ex- 
cellency,' said I ; and away I flew to seek 
a lawyer, to settle the rest of the business. 
By the Powers, no one can be at a loss to 
find one here â€” the instant it was known I 
wanted one, they came flocking about me 
like a swarm of bees ; and ' give it to me,* 
cries one of them, meaning the purse, 
which I kept in my hand, and ' give it 
io me,* cries another â€” ^ Softly, softly,

gentlemen/ says I, ' I'll give my money to 
neither one nor other of you; but if any 
one of you v;ill follow me into the prison^ 
to settle a little business I have to transact 
there, I will give him â€” what I think pro- 
per." 

Though this statement did not, by any 
means, tend to reconcile Osmond to the 
conduct of Mactalla, still he could not 
bring himself to express any further disap- 
probation of it, owing, as he clearly saw 
it was, to the sincerity of his regard for 
him. He determined, however, to acquit 
himself, without delay, of meanness and 
deception in the eyes of the Duke D'Amalfi, 
by coming to a candid and immediate ex- 
planation with his Excellency, on the sub- 
ject. 

'' Vvell/' said the French Duke, '' 'tis 
unnecessary, I presume, my dear friend, 
to say that I most sincerely rejoice at your 
restoration to liberty â€” rejoice at your hav- 
ing so speedy an opportunity of chastising 
the person who deprived you of it â€” You 
B 3 doubt- 



O THE DISCAKDED SON. 

doubtless/' he added, as if he looked upon 
his doing so as a thing of course, '' mean 
to demand satisfaction of Lord O'Sinister 
for his conduct to you ?" 

Osmond looked with astonishment for a 
few minutes at his Grace, without speak- 
ing. 

" Certainly not the kind of satisfaction 
which your Grace, I fancy, means,'' he 
then replied: 'â€¢' even though I had received 
from his Lordship what I was conscious 
the world V7ould consider sufficient provo- 
cation to justify my requiring such from 
him, still w^ould my principles, the pro- 
fession I have embraced, the disparity of 
our ages, and many other powerful con- 
siderations, vv ith hold m.e from such a mea- 
sivre. As I have already said, I leave it 
to Lord O'Sinister's own rejections, to re- 
venge the injurious treatment I have ex- 
perienced from him." 

'' And is it possible," demanded his 
Grace, bending his dark and penetrating 
eyes upon Osmond^ '^ that you can think 

of 



THE DISCARDED SON. 7 

of sitting down patiently under the wrongs 
you have met with from him r" 

Osmond bowed. 

The Duke shrugged his shoulders and 
smiled sarcastically â€” '' Well, my young 
friend/' cried he, shaking his head, "1 may 
envy your forbearance, but, I candidly 
confess, I do not admire it. The coolness 
of philosophy is unnatural in the season of 
youth; but you, doubtless, are the best 
judge of your own actions. I shall now,'^ 
he added, smiling still more superciliously^ 
'' take my leave, as you may perhaps have 
some preparations to make for the illus- 
trious visitor you are expecting " 

So saying, he withdrew with a sliding 
bow from the room. 

Never had Osmond felt himself so hurt â€” â–  
so irritated, as at the mom.ent, insomuch 
that had his Grace remriined another mi- 
nute, he probably would have convinced 
him he did not possess that kind of cool- 
ness which he had so sneeringly attributed 
to him. In a short time, however, he re- 
B A collected 



B TIJE DISCARDED SON. 

eoUected himself sufficiently to rejoice that 
the French Duke, by his precipitate de- 
parture, had prevented any thing of an un- 
pleasing nature occurring between them â€” 
" As, no doubt/' said he to himself, '' re- 
flection will convince him of the impro- 
priety of his language to me â€” convince 
him that, without acting contrary to the 
character which, from the line of life I have 
embraced, it behoves me to support, I 
could not act otherwise than I intend with 
regard to Lord O'Sinister." 

A long and early visit from the Duke 
D'Amalfi gave a turn to his thoughts. â€” 
Though advanced in life,' his Excellency 
still retained a countenance full of spirit 
and vivacity ; his conversation, too, was 
highly animated ; his manners and address 
insinuating in the extreme : altogether he 
was one of those kind of characters that 
instantly attract attention, and almost as 
immediately conciliate respect and esteem. 
The prepossession which Osmond had con- 
ceived in his favour, from the description 

he 



THE DISCARDED SON. 9 

he had received of him from his friends at 
Acerenza, was confirmed the moment he 
beheld him ; but had the reverse been the 
case^ he would have been deficient indeed 
in sensibilitv, as nothing' could be more 
jrracious â€” more condescendino: than his 
Excellency's conduct to him. He spoke 
of the services he had rendered the 
Acerenza family as if done to himself and 
protested nothing could afford him greater 
happiness than to evince his grateful sense 
of these, by taking him by the hand on 
every occasion. 

Persuaded, from some inadvertent ex- 
pressions of Mactalla's, that Osmond was 
unpleasantly siiuated with regard to money 
matters, hisExcellency resolved not to delay 
putting into his hands the whole of the 
sum he had received for his use from 
Count Placentia, and for the express pur- 
pose of doing which was his present visit: 

His Lordship's injunction to silence on 

the subject being too strict to allow him 

to think of violating it, he gave Osmond to 

B 5 under- 



JO THE DISCARDED SON. 

understand that the sum with which he thus 
surprised him, was the produce of a kind 
of sineci'.re situation, which he haid had 
vacant for some time in his <jift, but con- 
sidered as his, from the moment he had 
been recommended to his patronage by 
Count Flacentia, and the nature of which, 
he added, he would explain to him in 
the course of a few days, when he should 
be at leisure to see and entertain him at 
his palace. 

Osmond was not without a strong suspi- 
cion that the case was not exactly as his 
Excellency had represented ; but was 
withheld, by a fear of giving olTence^ 
from divulging it : that he entertained 
such a one, however,, his countenance 
plainly intimated to his Excellency. â€” 
After he had expressed the high sense he. 
entertained of his goodness and conde- 
scension, he entered into an explanation 
relative to IMactalla, which alTorded no 
little amusement to the Duke, and by 
being placed to the right account, ren- 
dered 



THE DISCARDED Sf)N. 11 

dered him still more pleased with his p7"o- 
tegce. . Osmond, after discharging- the pe- 
cuniary obligation which his attendant had 
been the means of laving him under to 
his Excellency, found himself still master 
of nine hundred pounds, the principal 
part of which sum he resolved on remit- 
ting the next day to his father, that want 
of cash might not be any hindrance to his 
immediately coming over, with his family, 
to Italy, where Osmond now considered 
himself settled for life. 

He was abouf proceeding the next 
morning to a banker's^ for the purpose of 
procuring an order on England for his 
lather, when the French Duke abruptly 
entered his apartm.ent â€” "" 3/1 y dear friend,'* 
cried he, with his usual insinuating smile, 
as soon as Mactaila, who was attending on 
his m.astcr, had withdrawn, '' I fear greatly 
that the business which has brought me 

hither will make vou doi'bt the sincerity

of my regard â€” nay, I am convincfd it 
will, if you 'are one of those v/hothF^ika

man should prefer the safety to the re-, 
putation of his friend/' 

Osmond started. â€” 'â€¢ The reputation !" 
he repeated with emotion â€” " I really can- 
not comprehend your Grace's meaning-â€” 
be so obliging as to explain it/' 

The Duke bowed. 

*' The indignation which I experience 
whenever I hear of a base or ungenerous 
deed/' cried he^ '' the abhorrence in which 
1 hold any thing like oppression or cruelty^ 
made me anxious for you to call Lord 
O'Sinister to account for his conduct to 
you. Your declining to do this rendered 
me dissatisfied, as doubtless you perceived. 
That your motives for your forbearance 
towards him were truly praiseworthy, re- 
flection tended to convince me; still, how- 
ever^ I could not be reconciled to it, not 
only because I felt your injuries as if they 
"were my own, but because I was inclined to 
think the world would not approve of it : 
but notwithstanding this dissatisfaction, I 
determined never again to obtrude the sub- 
3 ject 



THE DISCARDED SOX. 15 

ject on you â€” a determination in which I 
should have persevered, but for the occur- 
rence of last night. Chance threw me 
into a party of which his Lordship wa3 
one. Neither the speciousness of his 
niannei-s, nor the high estimation in which 
he appeared to be held by the rest of the- 
eompany, had any influence over the 
unfavourable sentiments with . which his 
behaviour to you had inspired me for 
him. I viewed him with a chilling aspect^ 
and studiously avoided entering into con- 
versation with him. In the course of the 
evening, the Duke D'Amalfi happened to 
become the subject of discourse â€” Like 
other great men, he has enemies as well 
as friends. Prejudiced in his favour. by 
his conduct towards you, I ranked myself 
on the side of the latter, and warmly op- 
posed some bitter sarcasms thrown out 
against him, advancing, as a proof of his 
meriting the reputation he possesses for 
liberality of sentiment and generosity of 
feeling, his behaviour to you. Lord 0\Si- 

nister^ 



14 THE DISCARDED SON. 

nister, upon this, immediately took me up. 
He did not deny, he said, its being a proof 
of his being generous ; but he assuredly 
should its being a proof of his possessing 
either prudence or discernment, since, 
if wise, he certainly would not have be- 
stowed a favour till assured it was merited; 
nor, if discerning, have failed of seeing 
that, in the present instance, this w^as not 
the case. My retort to this observation 
was acrimonious in the extreme â€” I avowed 
myself your friend, and insisted on his 
Lordship's silence respecting you, except 
he spoke of you in the terms you deserv- 
ed. He maliciously protested he should 
do so in no other; and, in order to acquit 
himself, he said, of the cruelty and injus- 
tice of which I accused him, proceeded to 
assign such reasons for his conduct to you, 
.as certainly, to those who believed him, 
must have justified it. I, however, was 
not of the number; I spoke of the man- 
ner in which you had passed over the 
wrongs received at his hands, as a proof 

of 



THE DISGAEDED SON. 15 

of the nobleness of your mind. He laugh- 
ed sneeringly at the assertion^ and openly 

declared it v;as not principle^ but 

^ But I will not^ iny dear friend^ shock you 
by repeating the degrading expression he 
made use of; suffice it to mention, he 
said that it was the want of spirit, which 
you manifested on every occasion, that 
had given him such a prejudice against 
you â€” a want of which you had given the 
most unequivocal demonstration, by re- 
sisting all his solicitations to you, though 
backed by those of your friends, to enter 
the armv, in which he could have provided 
most amply for you â€” Nay, hear me out," 
continued the Duke^ observing the quiver- 
ing lips of Osmond open â€” '' He bade me 
tell you, that so far from thinking more 
highly of you, for your forbearance to- 
wards him, he despised you for it; and 
should ever continue to do so, by ascrib- 
ing it to the most degrading motives. In 
short, my dear friend, except you notice 
in the usual way his conduct to you^ it will 

be 



16 THE DISCARDED SON. 

be Utterly impossible for you to remain in 
Naples, asuothing else can prove the vile 
appellation, with which he has branded 
you, unfounded/" 

" Enough, enough," cried Osmond, in 
an agitation to Vv'hich no language could 
do justice â€” '' Were I to hesitate about do- 
ing what is necessary to remove from my 
honour the stigma which he has cast upon 
it, I should deserve to lie under it the re- 
mainder of my life. The heart cannot be 
read ; I cannot wonder, therefore, that 
forbearance beyond a certain point should 
be misinterpreted. Lord O'Sinister, by 
putting it out of my power to recover my 
reputation in any other manner, forces 
me to raise ray hand against him â€” let the 
issue of the affair, therefore, be what it 
may, I trust I shall be acquitted in the 
sight of Heaven and the world."' 

'' Doubt it not/' cried the Duke hastily: 
'* submission to wrongs is not required 
even by religion, much less by society. 
The man who does not feel what is due to 

his 



THE DISCARDED SON. 17 

his character, and act accordingly, must 
be an object of general disesteein and con^ 
tempt. It stands therefore to reason, that 
resentment, which can alone actuate him 
to do this, is an useful principle in human 
nature, implanted for the wisest purposes, 
to guard private rights, and restrain the 
malevolence of the violent ; and that, 
therefore- " 

" My dear Duke," interrupted Osmond, 
with a forced smile, ^' argument is unne- 
cessary in this instance. I have decided 
how to act, and only want to know 
whether you will be my friend on this oc- 
casion ?'* 

" Assuredly," replied the Duke â€” 
'^ could you suppose otherwise ? I pre- 
sume," and Osmond thought he spoke 
v;ith eagerness, '^ 'tis your wish that I 
should wait upon Lord O'Sinister imme- 
diately ?" 

Osmond bowed. â€” '' I fly then," said his 
Grace ; and kissing his hand to Osmond, 
he darted from the room, leaving him a 

prey 



18 THE DISCARDED SON. 

prey to the most painful and opposite feel- 
ings and reflections. 

Notwithstanding the pi'ovocation he had 
received from Lord O'Sinister^, and his 
possessing a naturally warm and impetuous 
spirit^ keenly susceptible of wrong, and 
proudly indignant at it, he could not for- 
bear shuddering at the thoughts of raising 
his hand against him, whom he believed 
to have been the benefactor of his family 
â€” The die, however, was cast â€” to retract 
the determination he had avowed to the 
French Duke^ was not to be thought of; 
he therefore strove to think with calmness 
on what appeared to be inevitable. 

His ambassador to Lord O'Sinister 
speedily returned â€” " Well, my friend/' 
said he, the moment he entered the apart- 
ment, '' I have settled all matters with 
his Lordship. This evoiing, about seven 
o'clock, he will give you the m.eeting I 
dem.anded of him for vou, in one of the 
fields which skirt the west end of the city, 
a few miles from this. Lest, however, 

you 



THE DISCARDED SON. 19 

you should be tempted to imagine me fond 
of sanguinary measures^ I assure you I en- 
deavoured to compromise the affair be- 
tween you^ by proposing to him his pub- 
lickly retracting what he had said to your 
disadvantage, and making .an apology for 
the same ; but against such a measure he 
positively protested. In the first place^ 
he said he never would retract an asser- 
tion which he knew to be just ; and in the 
next, declared that you had set afloat re- 
ports concerning him, which had inspired 
him with such a thirst for venaeance, that 
except you gave him an opportiuiity of 
gratifying it, by meeting him like a man 
of spirit, it was his fixed determination to 
post you throughout Naples for a pol- 
troon/* 

'' Say no more, I beseech you, on the 
subject/' cried Osm.ond, in a hurried and 
agitated accent, " lest you beget in my 
bosom a spirit as malignant â€” as savage as 
his/' 

He then expressing a w^sh to be left for 

a little 



^0 THE DISCARDED SON. 

a little while to himself, the French Duke 
took his leave till evening. As soon as he 
departed, Osmond repaired to a banker^ 
where he procured an order on a house m 
London for seven hundred pounds, which 
he enclosed in a letter to his sister, to be 
forwarded if he fell in the approachin-g 
rencontre, and which contained a circum- 
stantial account of all that had befallen 
him since his arrival in Naples. He also 
wrote to Count Placentia and the Duke 
D 'Amain, to thank them for the kindness 
he had experienced at their hands, and as- 
sure them, to his last moment, he cherish- 
ed the most grateful remembrance of it. â€” 
These letters, after touching on their con- 
tents, he delivered to the French Duke 
on his return in (he evening, with an en- 
treaty for their being forwarded, should 
he fall, as soon as possible after his de- 
cease. He also, in case this took place, 
put into his hands a hundred pounds, as a 
legacy for Mactalla, and another U^r the 
expences of his feineral. All matters being 

finally 



THE DISCARDED SON. 21 

j5.nally arranged, and the Duke having so- 
lemnly plighted his word that he would, in 
every instance, obey the instructions he 
had received from him, should there be 
occasion, which, however, he fervently 
hoped there might not, they set out for 
the place of appointment in a carriage, 
which they dismissed within a i^ew yards 
of it. 

They found Lord O'SInister and his se- 
cond already on the ground. Osmond re- 
tired to a distance, but the French Duke 
approached them, and, by his gestures, it 
seemed to Osmond as if he was again en- 
deavouring to have the business settled in 
an amicable manner. That, if he had made 
such an effort, he had failed in it, however, 
was soon obvious to Osmond, by seeing him 
and the other second busily employed in 
loading pistols, with a brace of which the 
Duke shortly joined him, saying â€” " The 
man is a savage ; he will hearken to no 
terms of accommodation.'' 

As Osmond took the pistol from the 

Duke, 



<*^ 



THE DISCARDED SOK. 



Duke^ a deep sigh escaped him â€” not on 
his own account, however, was it breathed, 
but on that of the sufferings his family- 
would experience should he fall â€” the loss - 
they would sustain should he now be torn 
from them â€” now, that he had every pros- 
pect of being able to assist them essentially. 
His reflections on the subject were inter- 
rupted by the Duke exclaiming â€” " My 
dear friend, what are you about ? Lord 
O'Sinister has taken aim at you â€” v/hy don't 
you advance your pistol/' 

Osmond raised it, but ere he had well 
drawn the trigger, he received a ball in 
his right arm, which obliged him to drop 
his w^eapon, and at the sam.e instant, to 
his unutterable astonishment, as well as 
horror, (since he was not conscious of 
having taken any certain aim at him,) he 
beheld Lord O'Sinister fall ! 

" Be off," cried the French Duke hastily; 
" for his Lordship is shot/' 

Osmond, however, remained motion- 
less, wildly staring at his fallen opponent. 
5 â€”'' My 



THE DISCARDED SON. 23 

â€” ^' My dear friend/* proceeded ihe Duke 
impatiently, '' you can do no good by 
lingering here ; on the contrary, you are 
preventing that prompt assistance being 
rendered to his Lordship which he requires, 
for till I see you off, I cannot think of 
approaching him ; fly, and depend on my 
instantly joining his second, to see every 
thing that is requisite done for him/* 

'' Whither shall I fly?" asked Osmond. 

'' Do you perceive yonder lonely build- 
ing?" cried the Duke, pointing to a dis- 
tant one. 

" I do/' said Osmond. 

"^ Cross those fields in front of us/^ 
resumed the Duke, '' and you will find 
yourself at it; remain there till you see 
me, which will be as soon as I hear the 
surgeon's report of his Lordship's case ; 
should it be a favourable one, you may 
return to your lodgings, but if the reverse, 
you must make your escape with all pos- 
sible expedition, as his Lordship has many 
powerful friends iiiJ^Japles, who, no doubt,

>vill exert themselves to avenge his death â€” â€¢ 
But see, my friend," casting his eyes upon 
the arm of Osmond, which was bleeding 
fast, " you have also suflTered yourself, in 
this unfortunate rencontre ! â€” Permit me 
to make use of this handkerchief;** and 
drawing one from the pocket of Osmond, 
he bound it round his wound, and then 
again conjured him to fly. 

Osmond turned into the path he had 
been directed by his Grace to take, and 
advanced forward, but without well know- 
ing what he did. On reaching the build- 
ing where he was to take shelter, he found 
it to be a large old barn. The door being 
partly open, he entered, and having sa- 
tisfied himself that no one was in the place, 
he closed it, and proceeded to a large 
heap of straw which he perceived in a 
corner, and upon which he threw himself, 
utterly exhausted by emotion and loss oF 
blood ; and happy would he have felt at 
the moment, had he been assured he never 
should have risen from itâ€” so wretched 

^ did 



THE DISCARDED SON. ^^ 

did. he feel on Lord O'Sinister's account, 
of whose being morraily wounded he had 
scarcely a doabt, from the manner in 
which he fell. The idea of his having pro- 
voked his fate^ in no degree abated the 
horror with which it inspired Osmond ; he 
felt that if his surmises respecting him were 
true, he never more should know happi- 
ness : how to act â€” whither to betake him- 
self, should they prove so, he knew not, 
from the distracted stde of his mind. 

An hour elapsed without anything oc- 
curring to interrupt his agonizing reflec- 
tions; the door \vas then suddenly pushed 
open, and by the faint light it admitted, 
Osmond beheld tin*ee men enterinp- the 

o 

barn, with something stretched across their 
arms. A few minutes sufficed to convince 
him that the3^were banditti^ and that what 
they carried was a murdered body. 

" Is there any snug hole," demanded 
one of them, in a true ruffianly accent, 
'' into which we could thrust this old fel- 
low?" 

VOL. V. c *' Oh, 



26 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' Oh, let the priest do that for him/' 
said a second ; " there is a heap of some- 
thing yonder â€” straw, I suppose ; let us 
tumble him on that, and be off for the 
corpse of his master, for should it be dis- 
covered yet awhile, an alarm will be given 
that may prevent our escape.** 

'' True," cried the third, "no time 
should be lost in securing it;" and hastening 
to the corner in which Osmond lay, and 
which, fortunately for him, was by this 
time involved in almost total darkness, 
they threw the body close by him^ and 
departed. 

Osmond's first impulse was immediately 
to fly the place ; but a moment's reflec- 
tion cheched his obeying this, by repre- 
senting to him the likelihood there was of 
the light without betraying him to the 
ruflians. He had scarcely made up his 
mind to quietly remaining where he was, 
ere they returned With another body, 
which they threw, with as little ceremony 
as they had done the preceding one^ upon 

the

the Straw, and then again withdrew. As soon 
as they retired^ Osmond, anxious to ascer- 
tain the direction they took;, raised his 
head from the straw, for the purpose of 
listening; but from which he was quickly 
diverted by a faint moan. He started, un- 
certain whether or not his ear had deceived 
him â€” It was repeated^ and he no longer 
doubted its proceeding from one of the 
bodies that had been flung beside him.â€” 
All the horrors of his own situation were 
now aggravated, by the idea of its jircvent- 
ing him from rendering any assistance to 
the poor sufferer at hand. While deliber- 
ating on the measures he should pursue, 
the risk he should run of missing the Duke 
D'Angournoise, and falling into the power 
of the banditti, by venturing out on his 
account, the pushing open of the door 
again caused him to shrink into the straw, 
and hold in his breath. 

For a few minutes a rustling noise, as 

of some one groping about, was all he 

c 2 heard ; 



23 THE DISCARDED SOX. 

heard ; he then heard some one say^ in a 
low muttering tone â€” ** I certainly saw him 
enter this place â€” yes, yes, I am positive I am 
not mistaken; here, therefore, will I remain 
till I have sufficient light to look about me." 

This determination was not the most 
agreeable one in the world to Osmond; 
but in a minute after, the uneasiness it 
gave rise to was dissipated by the excla- 
mation of â€” '^ Blessed St. Benedict!" con- 
vincing him it was Mactalla who had last 
entered ; he accordingly pronounced his 
name, and, in return, heard his own shouted 
forth, in the most joyful accent. He imme- 
diately extricated himself from the straw, 
and advancing towards the door, was fol- 
lowed thither by Mactalla, whom caution- 
ing to speak in a lowxr key, he acquainted 
with the incident thai had just occurred, 
and expressed a wish for him to go out, in 
quest of assistance for the unfortunate 
stranger. 

'' What, and leave you here' to be 

butchered 



THE DISCARDED SON. ^ 

butchered by the rufifians ?" demand^ 
Mactalla. 

'' I don't imagine there is any danger 
of their returning/' replied Osmond ; "at 
all events, I am unvviiling to quit this at 
present^ lest my doing so should cause me 
to miss the Duke D'Angournoise^ whom I , 
expect here every moment." 

'' The Duke D'Angoumoise !" repeated 
Mactalla, in a voice expressive of much 
astonishment, " did he promise to join you 
here. Sign or?'* 

'' He did, else should I not expect 
him/' 

" Then take my word for it, Signor, 'tis 
a promise he does not mean to keep/* 

'^ What makes you think so?" asked 
Osmond. 

" I'll tell you another time, Signor," 
returned Mactalla, '' for here I do not 
think it very safe for us to have much con- 
versation/' 

Osmond imputing to conjecture what 

he had said relative to the Duke^ felt still

unwilling to quit the barn ; but finding 
him resolved on not leaving it without 
him, at length quitted it, and struck into 
the road leading from Naples. They had 
not proceeded far, when they espied a 
light, glimmering through a grove which 
skirted one side of the way, and towards 
which they instantly hastened â€” Osmond, 
'With 21 heart fluttering- with joy at the idea 
of being able to procure assistance for the 
wounded stranger. After advancing some 
vards, they found themselves before a 
small low building, almost shrouded in 
trees, and from a lattice of which still 
beamed the light that had attracted them 
to it : but scarcely liad they com.e within 
sight of it, when an unpleasant idea came 
across the iTiind of Osmond, that caused 
him to pause â€” It might be, he suddenly 
reflected, the hiding-place of the banditti 
he had seen in the barn. Mactalla, too, 
as if struck by the saiue idea, also stopped, 
and catching his master by the skirt of the 
coat, as if apprehensive of his proceeding, 

exclaimed 



THE DISCARDED SON. 31 

exclaimed in his ear â€” " Softly, softly, Sig- 
nor; by St, Benedict, we may have only 
quitted the den, to run into the jaws of 
the lion himself here." 

" No/' said Osmond, after a short inter- 
val of silence, during which he looked 
about him attentively â€” '' No, there is no- 
thing in the appearance of t\\h place in- 
dicative of its being the haunt of persons 
of the description you allude to; n looks 
more like the neat and peaceful ;^h'^de of 
some industrious peasant. I will venture, 
therefore, to knock at it â€” In the cause 
of a distressed fellow-creature, he must be 
selfish indeed who would not run a little 
risk/^ 

Ere, however, he applied his hand to the 
door, bethought it adviseable to listen for 
a few minutes at it. Mactaila, not satisfied 
with listening, put his eye to the key-hole, 
and the instant after, called out in a gen- 
tle tone â€” " Pray, open the door if you 
please." 

c 4 ''Do 



32 TIJE DISCAKDED SON. 

'' Do you see any one }" asked Osmond 
anxiously. 

'' By the Powers, I do ! â€” one of the 
prettiest little creatures I ever clapped my 
eyes on/' replied Mactalla, half raising his 
head â€” '' Look through the keyhole your- 
self, Signor, to be convinced I only speak 
truth/' 

Osmond stooped, and beheld through 
the aperture an old in an and a young girl, 
seated at a table, in a small neat apartment, 
their looks directed towards the door, as if 
they had heard something, and were ra- 
ther alarmed, of which their being, Os- 
mond was soon convinced by hearingthegirl 
exclaim in a terrified accent â€” '* Grand- 
father, did you not hear somebody speak ? 
I am sure I did/' 

"No, ckild," replied the oU nian, "it 
was only the wind, as it rushed through 
the crevices of the door, von heard.'* 

' "' By the Powers!" cried Mactalla, who 
had applied his ear so close to the door 

as 



THE DISCARDED SON. S3 

as to be able to distinguish perfectly what 
was passing within, '' but you are mis- 
taken, and your granddaughter is right." 

The old man, in a trembling voice, 
now demanded who was there ? â€” Osmond, 
in a tone well calculated to still alarm, 
replied â€” '' Two travellers who have lost 
their way." 

'' And who are in momentary expecta- 
tion of being overtaken by a gang of rob- 
bers/' rejoined Mactalla, "who have just 
dispatched two other travellers, that now 
lie bleeding in the barn above/' 

^' Alack-a-day ! in my barn?'* cried the 
old man with emotion, but without open- 
ing the door. 

" By St. Benedict, I don't know whether 
it is your's or not," answered Mactalla ; 
*' but the sooner yau open the door, the 
sooner you'll know." 

The door was now cautiously unbarred, 
and Osmond, at the sight of whose coun- 
tenance the terror of the old man appear-

ed to vanish;, and hib impatient valet^ were 
admitted. 

He briefly related to him the purpose 
for which they had intruded on him, and 
entreated, if he had the power, not to de- 
lay sending assisMnce to the unfortunate 
strangers in the barn. 

'' Alack-a-day !'' cried the old man, 
shaking his head, " I have not the power 
of rendering them any assistance ; I have 
no body here with me but my granddaugh- 
ter ; but if you chuse, sheil shew you to 
a house not far off, where you"]} be able 
to procure what you require." 

'^ If you please then/' returned Osmond, 
^' Vv'e'il accept her services." 

The fair Bianca, whose pretty face the 
gallantry of Mactaila had sufiiised with 
blushes, accordingly led the way through 
a spacious avenue cut through the grove, 
and bordered with lemon and orange trees, 
whose delightful exhalations revived the 
languid senses of Osmoad, to a magnifi-

cent villa. As concisely as possible, she 
explained to * the porter who admitted 
them into the hall, the business which had 
brought her thither^ which he had no 
sooner heard, than he summoned several 
other domestics, for the purpose of getting 
some of them to hasten to the barn.â€” 
Amongst these, Mactalla was agreeably sur- 
prised by discovering an old acquaintance^ 
an attendant of the Duke D'Amalfi in his 
last visit to x\cerenza, and by whom he 
w^as at the same instant recognized. Their 
mutual recQornition was the means of 
discovering to Osmond that the house 
he was then in belonged to the Dukc^ 
which Mactalla had no sooner heard, than 
he exclaimed aloud in the most joyful ac- 
cent â€” " We are in luck, we are in luck ! 
â–  â€” got into the right* box after all 1" and 
hastened to inform the servants that liis 
master was the particular L-ieiid and fa-

the greater attention they paid him, the 
more they would oblige the latter. Upon_

hearing which,, the steward, a respect- 
ahle elderly inan, was called, who, on 
learning the intimacy that subsisted be- 
tween Osmond and his lord, immedi- 
ately ushered him into an elegant apart- 
ment, where refreshments were presently 
laid before him, whilst several servants 
"were dispatched with lights and cordials 
to the barn^ and orders to bring back 
the unfortunate strangers, whether dead 
or /'ive. The stevv^ard perceiving Osmond 
look p?Ae and exhausted, proposed his 
rcmaini-ng for the night at the villa â€” a 
proposal which met with a ready acqui- 
escence, as till Osmond had heaixl from 
the Duke D'Angoumoise, he could not 
think of venturing back to Naples. On 
the stewa^d^s retiring to give directions for 
an apartment to be prepared for him, Os 
mond turned v/ith im.patience towards Mac- 
talla_, who had followed and continued in 
the room with him, and desired to knovv 
by what means he had been able to 
trace him to the barn^, and the reason

he had for supposing the Duke D'Angou- 
moise would not fulfil his promise of re- 
pairing thither ? 

'' You shall henr. Signer/* answered 
Mactalla â€” " No sooner had I cast my eyes 
upon the countenance of the Duke D'An- 
goumoise^ who, by the bve, is '' 

'' My friend/' said Osmond, hastily in- 
terrupting him, and in a commanding 
tone, perceiving by the turn of his fea- 
tures that he was about uttering some free 
remark upon his Grace. 

Mactalla bowed. â€” '^' Well, vSignor, as I 
was about saying, no sooner had I looked 
in his face this morning, when he callech 
upon you, than my mind misgave me 
something w^as wrong: so when I quitted 
the room, 1 stopped at the door "

cried Osmond, with a frowning aspect. 

Mactalla shook his head, and thus pro- 
ceeded â€” '' Vv ell, Signor, what I heard then 
made me return to the same station vvhen 
the Duke came back from Lord O'Sinister,

and thus I learnt that you were to meet his 
Lordship this evening, which, to be sure, 
I can't sav I was very sorry to hear, as I 
expected nothing less than that you would 
give him the dressing he so richly merited, 
for his conduct to you ; so, making certain 
of this, I determined on seeing a little of 
the fun, and accordingly repaired to the 
place of appointment, where I hid me be- 
hind a hedge, and it was a mercy my 
lauo^hino- did not betrav me/' 

^'^ Gracious Heaven !*' exclaimed Os- 
mond, with mingled horror and disgust, 
'^ is it possible that you could laugh at 
the melancholy catastrophe you witnessed 
there?" 

'^ Why, do you really believe, Signer^ 
that you wounded Lord O'Sinister ?'' 

'' Do I believe it ?" demanded Osmond. 
^' How can I doubt it, after what I saw ?'' 

'' Why, to be sure, his Lordship did 
sham a wounded man neatly. He put me 
in mind of a set of strolling plavers in the 
county of Cork, to whom my grandfather 

lent 



THE DISCARDED SON. 39 

lent an old bc\rn to play m^ and who ac- 
cordingly let rne m ibr nothing. They 
promised the people^ i[ they caine to see 
them^ theyVi i.ill themselves to give them 
satisfaction ; and to be snre^ to all appear- 
ance they kept their word, for they had 
long knives^ which they thrust into their 
sides : and wx were all going away perfectly 
satisfied^ when Tom ^i\Turphy^ a young 
friend of mine, whispered in my ear that 
he sa:v one of the dead men rise up and 
walk away, as if nothing at all was the 
matter with him, I could not believe him ; 
so perceiving the foot of one of the dead 
ladies thrust beyond the curtain, I turned 
back to convince myself all was right, 
and gave it a gentle pinch, when, by the 
Powers, out she roared, and jumping up, 
walked quietly oflT, just as my Lord O'Si- 
nister did when your back was turned â€” 
up he got, as nimble as a bee, met the 
French Duke more than half way, shook 
him heartily by the hand, and then walked 
off with him and iiis second ; upon which,

here's a humbiiof said I to myself^ anvl 
posted after you directly^ to let you know 
the trick that had been played you ; but 
just as I saw you enter the barn, it came 
into my head, that they might be again 
plotting something against you, so I turned 
back in hopes of overtaking them and hear- 
ins: what thev were sayins,-; but not beins: 
able to discover them in any direction. Ire- 
turned to you.'* 

*' Good Heavens! what a tale have vou 
told me!" cried Osmond â€” '' How great 
would be my indignation did I credit it! 
but that 1 cannot diO, Your senses must 
indeed, my good friend, have deceived- 
you, for that such a villanous transaction 
would be connived at by the Duke D'An- 
goumoise, who is " 

'^ A big blackguard !" interrupted Mac- 
talla, calmly. 

*' Silence," exclaimed Osmond passion- 
ately ; " I insist upon your not presuming 
to mention his Grace again in a disrespect- 
ful manner. I look upon him at present 

as 



THE DISCARDED SON. 41 

as one of my most sincere friends^ and 
until I have reason to think the contrary, 
will uphold his character even at the risk of 
my life. You must repair to-morrow morn- 
ing to Naples, at as early an hour as pos- 
sible, when I trust vou'll receive a favour- 
able account of Lord O'Sinister's health/* 
'' Don't doubt it/* replied Mactaila. 
The steward now re-entered the apart- 
ment ; he informed Osmond that the two 
unfortunate strangers had been brought t(y 
the villa. The servant was quite dead, he 
said; but the surgeon, who had been called 
in to the assistance of the master, enter- 
tained hopes of his recovery. ile had 
been put to bed, he added, and every 
thing done that was requisite for him. 
' Thi^s information afforded Osmond very 
great pleasure. The steward's attention 
was now called to his wounded arm, from 
which his own and Afactnlla's had been 
diverted, by the conversation that had just 
passed between them â€” The surgeon was 
brouglit in to dress it. The ball had 

lodged 



49 THE DISCARDED SON. 

lodged in a fleshy part of the arm, so that 
it was easily extracted. While the wound 
was dressing, Mactalla did nothing but 
rage at the vile trick which he pei-sisted in 
saying had been played upon his master. 

" Those were a desperate set of ruffians 
whom you were so unfortunate as to fall 
in withj Signor/' said the surgeon^ while 
employed about the arm of Osmond, tak- 
ing it for granted, as did the steward, that 
he had been wounded by those who at- 
tacked the other travellers. 

'"Desperate!" repeated Mactalla, "aye, 
that you may say with a witness â€” who 
could have thought that a Lord and a Duke 
would have been guilty of such villany ?" 

'' A Lord and a Duke!'* cried the sur- 
geon, with a wild stare of astonishment, 
'' capable of waylaying and murdering 
people !" 

*' Yes," returned Mactalla; "' buly by 
the Powers, they shall pay for their 
tricks." 

'' Really, my friend, you have strongly 

excited 



THE DISCARDED SON. 41 

excited my curiosity/' said the surgeon â€” 
" will you be so good as to give me the 
particulars of the affair }" 

" Oh, willingly/' cried Mactalla. " You 
must know/* drawing a little nearer to 
him, " that there is now in Naples an old 
thief called Lord O'Sinister, and a sly 
rogue of a Frenchman, called the Duke 
D'Angoumoise. These *' 



Here he caught a glance, so expressive 
of anger and resentment, from his master, 
as to put a stop to all further communi- 
cation on the subject, to the great disap- 
pointment of the surgeon, as his looks 
testified. The moment he had retired with 
the steward â€” '' Gracious Heaven V ex- 
claimed Osmond, in the most impatient 
accent addressing Mactalla, '' knowing as 
you do, the predicament in which I at 
present stand with regard to Lord O'Sinis- 
tcr, how could you be so imprudent as to 
give a hint of what has happened, to the 
surgeon ? I may probably be deprived of 
my liberty in consequence of your having 

done 



44 THE DISCARDED SON. 

done SO ; since, no doubt, if his Lordship 
be declared in a dangerous way, an imme- 
diate search will be made after me." 

Here Mactalla turned aside, evidently 
to suppress a laugh, which so exasperated 
Osmond, that with difficulty he forbore 
ordering him from the room. 

The steward soon returned, and Osmond 
shortly after was conducted to the chamber 
prepared for him ; but though fatigued 
both in body and mind, the occurrences 
of the day had made too deep, too dread- 
ful an impression upon him, to permit 
of his sleeping for a considerable time. â€” 
In consequence of his restless night, his 
slumbers were protracted to a late hour 
in the morning. On awaking, he found 
Mactalla by the bedside. He arose imme- 
diately, and as he was dressing, enquired 
whether he was yet thinking of going to 
Naples ? 

" Thinking V* repeated Mactalla, *â– " I 
have been there already^ and am just come 
back." 

" Well, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 45 

" Well^ well/' cried Osmond, faltering- 
through emotion, and looking anxiously 
in his face â€” '' What news of Lord O'Si- 
nister ?" 

'' Ah ! he's in a bad way/' answered 
Mactalla. 

'' Gracious Heaven !" exclaimed Os- 
mond, in a tone of anguish, and clasping 
his hands together; '' and the Duke D'An- 
goumoise â€” " 

'' Oh ! by the Powders, 'tis all over with 
him/' 

'' He has fled, I presume/' cried Os- 
mond, looking still more earnestly in the 
countenance of Mactalla. 

'^ Faith, you have hit the right nail on 
the head," replied the other coolly. 

'^ What will become of him ?" exclaimed 
Osmond, almost distracted aboul him. 

" He'll go to the devil," returned Mac- 
talla, with the same coolness with which 
he had just before spoken. 

'â€¢ Good God !" cried Osmond^ casting 

his 



46 THE DISCARDED SON. 

his eyes towards heaveii;, '' why did I ac- 
cept his offers of service ? why did I em- 
ploy him in such a business?'* 

'' Aye, why did you indeed?" said Mac- 
talla â€” '' Such were the very words I made use 
of to the bankersâ€” Gentlemen, says I, why 
did he employ such a fellow ? â€” why didn*t 
he entrust me with his money, instead of 
putting it into the hands of a foreigner â€” 
a " 

'' What bankers ? â€” what money do you 
mean }" cried Osmond, wildly staring at 
Mactalla. 

'' Read this," said Mactalla, very com- 
posedly taking a letter from his waistcoat 
pocket, and presenting it to him, ^' it will 
inform you better than I can." 

'^ A letter!" exclaimed Osmond, as with 
a trembling hand he took it from him ; 
*^ where did you get it ?" 

" I got it at the Duke D'Angoumoise's 
lodgings â€” He had the complaisance to 
leave it there for you." 

Osmond. 



THE DISCARDED tiON. 



47 



Osmond, with increased emotion, broke 
the seal, and read as follows. 



'-' Sir, 

'' That on first hearing of my 
conduct, your rage and indignation will 
be beyond bounds, I make no doubt; but 
equally am I convinced, that as soon as 
reason resumes her usual empire over you, 
and you are again enabled to reflect with 
coolness, the anger and resentment with 
which it inspires you, will, in a great 
measure, be overcome by the considera- 
tion of the useful lesson it aflbrds vou. 

" As, without experience, 'tis scarcely 
possible to pass through life with safety, 
so the sooner a man acquires^what is so 
requisite to guide him through its shoals 
and quicksands, the better; and the more 
highly he pays for it, the greater is the 
likelihood of its making a due impression 
on him. 

" Instead, 



48 THE DISJAllDED SON. 

*' Instead, therefore, of regretting your 
acquaintance with me, and the dross it has 
been the means of depriving you of, you 
should rather rejoice at the circumstance, 
from the knowledge you have acquired by 
it. The distrust with which it will doubt- 
less inspire you of mankind in general, the 
diffidence of your own judgment, (a too 
presumptuous opinion of which is the great 
bane of youth,) will, in all probability, 
save you from still greater depredations. 

'' But to prove to you that I am not so 
callous and unprincipled as, at first h 'tar- 
ing of my conduct, you mav be led to 
imagine, I solemnly assure you, that though 
from having been the victim of deception 
myself in many instances, I think it but 
fair to retaliate upon mankind in general, 
the numerous wrongs I have received at 
their hands, by taking advantage of them 
whenever 1 can â€” I should have spared 
you, (so much did your candour and sen- 
sibility please me, ) but for imperious ne- 
cessity. As some atonement for abusing 

the

the confidence you reposed in me, per- 
mit me to inform yoii^ that you need be 
under no uneasiness with regard to Lord 
O'Sinister â€” the pistol 1 delivered into your 
hands was not loaded. His motive ipv wish- 
ing you to believe him mortally wounded^ 
is to induce you to quit Naples, which lie 
has some powerful reasons, best known to 
himself^ for wishing you to leave.â€” 
Mis acquaintance and mine comiincnced 
some years back, and was renewed en our

After what I have said, it can scarcely be

deprived you of, and that, but for your 
own credulity, you never would have sus- 
tained such a loss. In future, admit no 
stranger to your confidence â€” to look with 
an e}e of suspicion on all â€” to believe that 
every man you meet is a villain, watching, 
like a tyger with extended talons, for a 
favourable opportunity of springing on 
his prey, is the only way of travelling with 
safety through this bad world ; do this, 
and you may defy the very devil himself, 
\vhich is Lord O'Sinister. Accept the as- 
surance of my high consideration ; and 
amongst your friends, be assured you have 
not one who more truly estimates your 
worth than 

The Duke D'Angoumoise/* 



" What a character I" exclaimed Osmond, 
letting the letter drop from his hand. 

" He*s a complete, big villain,*' cried 
Mactalla, stooping to pick it up. 

'' A villain, indeed!" echoed Osmond, 

as 



THE DI.SCARDED SON. 51 

as he walked about the rooiH;, in an agita- 
tion impossible to be described. 

" That he is/' rejoined the other, '' to 
run away with the hundred pounds you 
intended for me when you died." 

*' Don't mention that, 'tis nothing to 
the rest/' cried Osmond, indignantly waving 
his hand. 

'' No, to be sure, I know 'tis nothing- 
compared to eight hundred pounds," re- 
plied Mactalla : then after a pause â€” " But 
I am not in the least surprised at what has 
happened, for I saw by Monsieur's phiz 
that he was a slv dog, and always disliked 
him as much as I do the rest of the French 
fellows. By St. Benedict, when I was at Paris, 
I was often tempted to give some of them 
a good kicking â€” There you'd see a fellow 
bowing and scraping to you, and grinning 
full in your face, as if he was your most 
humble servant; and the next instant catch 
him winking at another, as much as to say 
he had humbugged you. The Marchcsa 
Morati had a fellow of this kind, and one

day he took it into his head to make game 
of me, as he thought, behind my back ; 
but it happened to be before my face â€” 
a fev\^ gentle kicks, however, made Mr. 
Friseur change his tone, and gallop off 
faster than he came.'* 

'' Pray," demanded Osmond, suddenly 
and angrilv, "^ what induced you to sport 
with my feelings, by telling me Lord 
O'Sinister was in a bad way ?" 

Mactalla looked earnestly at him for a 
moment â€” '' I merely meant, Signor,'' re- 
plied he, '' that he was in a bad way with 
regard to his soul.'' 

'' And the bankers," added Osmond. 

" Why, that on hearing the Duke D'An- 
goumoise had quitted his lodgings, I re- 
paired to them, in hopes of saving your 
money ; but it was too late ; he had re- 
turned the order you received from them 
on England, and got your hard cash in 
exchange for it." 

'' What deliberate villainy !" cried Os- 
mond, with uplifted hands. 

" Yes, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 53 

'' Yes, yes, deliberate enough/' said 
Mactalla ; " he was sure of his game, so 
did every thing quietly and coolly â€” ^I wish 
to the Lord I had been at his elbow, when 
he was sliding into his pocket the hundred 
pounds I was to have got after your death." 

'' Psha !" returned Osmond, impatiently, 
'^ let me hear no more of that ; in some 
way or other, I shall endeavour to revvard 
you for your services." 

*' 0\ if it comes to that, hang the dirty 
money, say I â€” by the Powers, Ned Mac- 
talla values money as little as any lord in 
the kingdom." 

The steward now made his appearance 
to enquire after Osmond's health, and 
whether he was yet disposed for break- 
fast ? â€” Osmond, for form's sake, reply- 
ing to this question in the affirmative, 
(the French Duke's letter having de- 
prived him at the moment of all appe- 
tite,) was ushered to an elegant saloon, 
where the morning repast was prepar- 
ed for him, and at which the steward 
D 3 would

would attend. Disturbed and perplexed^, 
so that to make an eHhi't to enter into 
conversation was painful in -the extreme, 
Osmond would gladly have dispensed 
with his attendance ; but finding he could 
not prevent this without giviivg offence^ 
he forced himself to enter into dis- 
course with him, in the course of which 
he learnt, that besides the present villa, 
the Duke D'Amalfi had several others, still 
more splendid and beautiful, to which, 
whenever state aflairs would allow of his 
leaving the metropolis, he was wont to 
repnir with select parties. Soon after 
breakfast the steward withdrew, having 
previously, however, requested Osmond 
not to think yet awhile of returning to 
Naples â€” a request which Osmond had no 
hesitation in promising to comply with, 
as, in the present state of his mind, the 
idea of entering into any thing like a busy 
scene was insupportable to him. Lt^it to 
himself, his thoughts immediately reverted 
to the conduct of Lord O'Sinister and the 

French 



THE DISCARDED SON. 55 

FrenchBuke: forthatofthe forrnerhc could 
assign no cause whatever ; it appeared to 
him as inexplicable as vile â€” for t.-.-^ latter^ 
the letter v/hich had disclosed it had icMy 
explained the motives to which it v is 
owing â€” '' Detestable wretch \" he exclaim- 
ed, as he reperused this letter^ " thy ad- 
vice is not less odious than thy conductâ€” 
Thou v/oii!dst. If thou couhist^ corrupt as 
well as deceive ; but never, I trust, will 
that suspicion thou counsellest me to har- 
bour, find admission to my breast â€” that 
suspicion which is the certain precursor 
of guilt; for he who imagines e\c.yman 
his enemy, will naturally become the ene- 
my of every man." 

His passion by degrees subsiding, dur- 
ing the first paroxysm of which, h.e had 
meditated pursuing the Duke D'Anixou- 
moiie, and bringing him to the punish- 
ment he merited, he finally decided, 
after a little deliberation, on relinquish- 
ing this intention, and leaving him to 
the avenging hand of Heaven ; reflection

convincing hvin, liiat he could not di- 
vulge his baseness without implicating 
Lord O'Sinister, who'se conduct the con- 
sideration of the obligations he believed 
his family owed him. rendered him un- 
willing to expose to public censure. 

His meditations were broken in upon 
by the surgeon coming to dress his arm â€” 
He spoke favourably of it, as also of the 
wounds of the stranger. On his retiring, 
Osmond was about repairing to a beautiful 
gai*den, into which the saloon opened, 
when Mactalla abruptly entered the apart- 
ment, and stopt him. 

'' By St. Benedict, Sign or/' cried he, 
almost out of breath, " but the old gen- 
tleman, whose life you have been instru- 
mental in saving, has become (in spite of 
every body in the hou?re) a walking ghost. 
On regaining his recollection, and learn- 
ing the m.eans by wiiich he had been 
brought hither, I was called, at his par- 
ticular request, for the purpose of let- 
ting him know to whom he was indebted, 

which 



THE DISCARDED SON. 57 

which I had no sooner done^ than up he 
would get to see you/' 

^' Good Heavens!" exclaimed Osmond, 
''^ surely he should have been informed, 
that to see me, it was not requisite for him 
to rise/* 

'' So he was, Signor ; but he would not 
be persuaded to the contrary, and is now 
in a gallery adjoining his chamber ; nor 
will he be laid again (that is, in bed, I 
mean) till he has seen you/' 

" Conduct me instantly to him," said 
Osmond ; " his rashness may prove fatal 
to him/' 

Mactalla obeyed. On their reaching the 
gallery he withdrew, and Osmond advanc- 
ing down it, found the stranger on a couch 
at the further end. He seemed to be up- 
wards of sixty, and what with the paleness 
and languor which his wounds had occa- 
sioned, the grey locks that thinly shaded 
his forehead, and a look of deep melan- 
choly, which seemed to say it was some- 
thing more than the hand of time that had

form, appeared altogether one of the most 
interesting objects he had eve^' seen. 

On Osmciid s drawing near him, he at- 
tempted to rise, but was prevented by Os- 
mond's hurrying forwar ^ and gently laying 
hold ofhisarm. â€” " My preserver!*' he then 
exclaimed in a broken voice^ and fastening 
his eyes with a kind of wild earnestness 

upon his countenance â€” '' My '* his 

bosom heaved with convulsive sobs, and 
hastily averting his head;, he burst into 
tears.

eyes towards heaven : then, after a pause, 
turning them aoain upon Osmond^, '' be 
not uneasy/' he auded ; " my present 
feelings will not injure me, for they are 
the delicious offspring of gratitude â€” grati- 
tude for what, but a short time ago, I

rienced. Bnt say," his eyes wandering 
from the countenance of Osmond, and sud- 
denly resting on his arm, '' say,"^' with an 
emotion that shook his whole frame, 
*' wert thou not wounded in my de- 
fence ?" 

^' Would that it had been in so just a 
cause,'' said Osmond, emphatically. 

â€¢' Ah, now I remember," returned the 
stranger, '' your servant informed me it 
was by the hand of a villain, whom you 
once considered as a friend." 

*' Even so," replied Osmond. 

*' And what is the name of this villain?" 
demanded the stranger, in a tone of vehe- 
Mience^ which^ considering the state he 

was

was in, astonished Osmond; "'reveal it/' 
cried he, his eyes kindling with pas- 
sion, '' that he may receive the punish- 
ment his treachery merits. I have power, 
and I have inclination to avenge your 
wrongs/' gently pressing, as he spoke, the 
arm of his young preserver. 

" His name is sacred/' returned Osmond ; 
*' the hand which wounded me was once 
extended in kindness to my family, and 
that consideration will for ever prevent my 
seeking to revenge the injury it has done 
me.' 

'" Oh my â€” my preserver!" again burst 
from the evidently struggling bosom of the 
old man, ^nd for an instant he hid his Iiice 
against the shoulder of Osmond ; then 
raising it, but still grasping his arm, '' this 
generosity â€” this nobleness/' he cried, 
*' will not go unrewarded. Oh, God !" 
suddenly raising his hands and eyes towards 
heaven, while a faint colour flushed his 
clicek, " my penitence is accepted by thee, 
L^ise wouldst thou not," and meekly cross-

ing his arms upon his breast, he bowed 
his head in token of humility and thank- 
fulness^ '' permit me to experience such 
an hour as this. My son/' he added, again 
directing his looks to the astonished Os- 
mond, *' I see my emotion startles thee ; 
more, it inclines thee to believe my senses 
disordered; but tn^st me they are not; 
could I boast of my conduct being as per- 
fect as they are, I should be a much hap- 
pier m.an than I now am; but " 

*^ Fardon me, Sir," cried Osmond, '^ for 
interrupting you; but really I cannot for- 
bear again entreating you to retire to re- 
pose." 

^â€¢' I will in a few minutes; but ere I do, 
permit me to ask you a few questions rela- 
tive to yourself. Your servant, besides 
telling m.e your name, informed me that 
you had not been long in Naples, but that 
it was your intention to settle here : what 
could induce your family to submit to such 
a measure â€” submit to part with such a 
son?'* 

'' Impe- 



THE DISCAEDID SON. 63 

^' imperious necessity/' answered Os- 
mond. 

The stranger started â€” '' Are they then 
unfortunate?" he demanded. 

'' If those can, be styled so who are in 
possession of domestic happiness. The 
source of all their felicity â€” love, has also 
been the source of all their misery." 

'' From your words I should infer your 
parents married against the consent of 
their friends.'* 

Osmond bowed. 

" And have they never been able to ob- 
tain a reconciliation with them?" 

Osmond looked earnestly in his counte- 
nance; its expression, however, so thorough- 
ly convinced him that it v,as not imperti- 
nent curiosity which dictated the enquiries 
he addressed to him, that after a little he- 
sitation, he replied to his last question. 

*^^ And do they not curse those â€¢obdurate 
relatives?" asked the stranger in a hurried 
accent. 

'' Curse them !" repeated Osmond; 
5 â€¢ *' curse 



64 THE DISCARDED SON. 

*â– ' curse the authors of their being ! they 
forgive, thev pity their obduracy â€” for of 
what sweet enjoyments has it not been the 
means of depriving them !" 

"^True â€” most true/' returned the other^ 
in an inward tone, and again striking his 
breast w^ith a look of unutterable anguish. 
*' Here, indeed, the crime carries the pu- 
nishment along with it. Oh, for such a 
crime, for denying forgiveness to a sup- 
plicating child, what sufferings can atone !" 
" Dear Sir,'' said Osmond, alarmed by 
his encreasing emotion, ''pray allow nie to 
support you to your chamber." 

'' Do with me as thou wilt," cried he, 
throwing himself on the neck of Osmond, 
and feebly straining him to his bosom, 
'' for thou art â€” thou art !" â€” his utterance 
failed him as he attempted to proceed, a 
deadly paleness overspread his counte- 
nance, his eyes closed, and he fainted in 
the arms of Osmond. 

Shocked beyond expression, Osmond 
gently laid him upon the couch, and has- 
tened 



IHE DISCARDED SON. 65 

tened to procure assistance for him. He 
was carried to his bed^ and immediately 
undressed ; but a length of time elapsed 
ere he shewed any symp,toms of returning 
animation. On reviving it was evident to 
all that his senses were deranged. Osmond 
requested the surgeon might directly be 
sent for, and then withdrew from the 
chamber to the garden, in hopes the air 
would remove the languor and depression 
he experienced. 

The villa Vt^as seated on a lofty promon- 
tory, embosom.ed in woods, and command- 
ing an extensive view of the bay and the 
adjacent country. In another frame of mind, 
and Osmond would have been transported 
even to enthusiasm by the richly diversified 
prospects it overlooked; but now his eye 
roved almost unconsciously over the pictu- 
resque scenery, so much were his thoughts 
engrossed by recent occurrencesâ€” the cruel 
enmity of Lord O'Sinister, the perfidy of 
the Frenchman, and the strange conduct of 
the old gentleman. That the senses of the 

latter 



C6 THE DISCARDED SON. 

latter had been disordered from the very 
commencement of their conversation, or 
else that he had, by some look or expres- 
sion, awakened some agonizing remem- 
brances in his bosom, he could not help 
imagining. It struck him, from his broken 
sentences, that he was some obdurate parent, 
who too late had become contrite for his 
cruelty to his offspring â€” too late perceiv- 
edâ€” 

** That revenge, though sweet at fust, bitter ere long, back oa 
itself recoils." 

His reflections were interrupted by the 
surgeon, who, as soon as he had visited the 
unfortunate stranger, came to inform him 
what he thought of his patient. He pro- 
nounced him at present in a high fever, 
evidently brought on by violent agitation, 
the least renewal of w^hich could not fail, 
he asserted, of proving fatal to him. 

This information made Osmond bitterly 
deplore having sulfered himself to be pre- 
vailed on to converse so long with him. 

In 



THE DISCARDED SON. 67 

In the midst of his regrets on the subject;, 
he v/as joined by the steward^ who came 
to tell him that the old gentleman was 
again calling for him^ and insisting on 
another interview. 

'' Then to put an end to all further im- 
portunity en that head/' said Osmond^ '' I 
will immediately quit the villa, since after 
hearing the surgeon's report of his cas^, 
I should conceive '^myself accessary to his 
death, if I at present complied with his 
wishes." 

He then, in case the unhappy invalid 
should need pecuniary assistance on reco- 
vering, gave his written address to the stew- 
ard^ with an injunction to deliver it to him as 
soon as he got better. He also having 
thanked the good man for the kind atten- 
tion which he had experienced at his hands, 
and which he asj^ured him he should mention 
to his Lord, the Duke D'Amalfi, in the 
terms it merited, requested him to have 
the goodness to send Mactalla to him. 

He immediately withdreVv for the pur-

pose, but returned in a few minutes. â€” 
'^ Your servant is not at* present within, 
Signor/' said he, '' but I have dispatched 
a messenger for him." 

'' What can possibly have taken him 
hence ?" asked Osmond. 

" What, I make no doubt, will excuse 
his absence to you, Signor â€” love!'* cried 
the steward, smiling ; '' the pretty grand- 
daughter of old Guiseppe, the shepherd, 
-who directed you hither last night, has 
quite smitten him, and he has hied him to 
her cottage, to tell her,. 1 suppose, of her 
conquest." 

" Foolish fellow," said Osmond ; ^' he 
should consider, ere he suffers himself to fall 
in love, or make love, whether his situation 
"^vill admit of his marrying, whether " 

Certain recollections stopped all fur- 
ther censure on poor Mactalla, and crim- 
soned his cheeks with blushes, for anim- 
adverting on what he had himself been 
guilty of â€” '' Ah," thought he, as he 
turned aside to conceal from the steward 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 69 

the confusion which the reflection gave 
rise to, '^ how apt are we all to forget onr 
own errors ; how carefully should we re- 
view our own conduct, ere we permit our- 
selves to censure that of others.** 

Mactalla quickly appeared, and was or- 
dered by his master to procure him either 
a carriage or horses immediately to return 
to Naples, an order which he received with 
a deep sigh. In the course of half an hour 
he returned to say that a chaise was at the' 
door, and a horse for himself. 

'' Then get yourself ready to depart di- 
rectly.'* 

/'Ready, Signori'* Mactalla repeated, 
in an accent expressive of surprise; " I am 
ready now.'* 

â€¢'' Why surely you cannot think of riding 
with one boot and a slipper on," said Os- 
mond, px)inting, as he spoke, to the legs 
of Mactalla. 

" I have got a wound," returned Mac- 
talla, sighing grievously as he stooped 
down to examine them, '' and that's the 

reason. 



TO THE DTSCARDKD SOK. 

reason, I suppose, why I forgot the otlier 
boot; but I'll get it on in a minute/' and 
he was hurrying from the room, when Os- 
mond concluding the wound he spoke of 
was in his leg, caught him by the arm. 

'' No^ no, my friend," cried he, '' God 
forbid that I could be capable of con- 
sciously letting any one put themselves to 
pain on my account; you shall dismiss the 
horse, and ride in the carriage with me to 
Naples." 

Mactalla casta look full of gratitude on 
his master, his eyes swam in tears, and for 
an instant he appeared unable to speak; 
then heaving a deep sigh â€” '' I fancy, Sig- 
nor," said he, " I may venture on horse- 
back, for my wound is here," laying his 
hand on his heart., 

"Oh, now I understand vou," returned 
Osmond, laughing; "yes, yes, since your 
wound is there, you may, as you say, ven- 
ture on horseback, so hasten to put on 
your boot; and here," drawing forth his 
purse, " take this money, and distribute it,, 

' at 



THE DISCARDED SON. 71 

at your own discretion, amongst the ser- 
vants/' 

Mactalla retired, but in a few minutes 
returned, to say he was ready to depart. 
Osmond was attended to the carriage by 
the steward, whom he again thanked for 
the civility and kindness he had expe- 
rienced from him, and reminded of the 
paper he had entrusted to his care for the 
unhappy stranger. 

As soon as he found himself again in 
possession of his apartments at the hotel, 
he sat down to transcribe the French 
Duke's letter, for the purpose of sending 
a copy of it to Lord O'Sinister, the idea 
of letting his Lordship suppose he had 
completely imposed upon him being in- 
supportable. Besides, he flattered him- 
self revealing to him his knowledge of his 
villainy would be a means of preventing 
any further repetition of it, by inducing 
him to believe that henceforward he should 
find him on his guard. 

The next day he received a summons to 

the 



72 THE DISCARDED SON. 

the Duke D'Amalfi, with whom he had a 
long interview, and was fully instructed 
in the duties of the situation his Excel- 
lency had appointed him to. He ac- 
quainted his Excellency with his having 
been indebted to the hospitality of his 
domestics, but carefully avoided all such 
particulars of his recent adventure as could 
create a suspicion of the loss he had sus- 
tained, or the baseness of Lord O'Sinister. 
The first he was unwilling to let his Ex- 
cellency know, lest he should conceive 
the divulgetnent owing to interested mo- 
tives, and the second for reasons already 
mentioned. 

From this period he became a frequent 
visitor at the AmalQ palace, and thus had 
opportunities of acquiring many elegant 
and agreeable acquaintances; he had be- 
sides quite as much leisure as he could 
desire, in consequence of his situation 
being almost a sinecure, for the pursuit of 
the studies he delighted in, and excursions 
to all the celebrated places about Naples, 

so 



THE DISCARDED SON. 73 

SO gratifying to a person of classic taste 
and vivid imagination. In short, at this 
period his fortunes again be^^an to assume 
a smiling aspect, and but for certain re- 
collections and considerations, he might 
have been pronounced in a happy, and 
of course an enviable situation. He could 
not forget the fair Cordelia, and he 
feared he should no more behold her, at 
least till too late for the kind intentions 
of her mother respecting them to be rea- 
lized. 

Three weeks passed pleasantly aw^y 
without any thing occurring worthy of no- 
tice, during which he sent several times to 
enquire after the health of the wounded 
stranger, wdiom he at length had the satis- 
faction of hearing pronounced out of dan- 
ger, but still in so Vv^eak a state as to be in- 
terdicted seeing any one, but those whose 
attendance upon him was absolutely requi- 
site. 

While Osmond was thus agreeably spend- 
ing his time, Mactalla was not idle. He 

VOL. V. E fonned 



74 THE DISCARDED so>r. 

formed many acquaintances amongst the 
great men of great men^ in the number of 
which was Mr. Jenkins, the confidant and 
prime agent in all matters of villainy of 
Lord O'Sinister. This honourable gentle- 
man had latterly become extremely jea- 
lous of a needy adventurer^ styling himself 
a German Count, though his ignorance 
and audacity evidently bespoke him of low 
ori<jin, whom Lord O'Sinister, since his 
arrival at Naples, had taken into his confi- 
dence, and of course pay, to the great di- 
minution of his, Mr. Jenkins's emoluments. 
After devising many schemes to ruin him 
with his employer, but not one of which 
succeeded, he at length hit upon one, 
w^hich could not but answer he thouorht : 
this was to betray.to Mactalla a plot which 
they had concerted against Osmond, and 
thus cause its frustration, in such a manner 
as should lead the peer to believe it en- 
tirely owing to the mismanagement of the 
German, and accordingly induce him to 
dismiss him from his service. 

In 



THE DI3CARDKD SON. V J 

In pursuance of this resolution, he 
informed Mactalla that Lord O'Sinister^ 
finding he could not banish Osmond from 
Naples, of his motives for desiring to do 
which he pleaded ignorance, had come 
to a determination of attempting his life, 
by means of the German Count, who, in 
order to obtain an opportunity of taking 
it in such a way as should prevent his be- 
ing involved in any disagreeable conse- 
quences, had been instructed to seek him 
out, for the purpose of uisteninga quarrel 
on him. 

â€¢*â–  Having in vain, however, for some 
time past sought him at the different public 
places he was knov/n to frequent," pur- 
sued Jenkins, '' it has at length been set- 
tled, that the Count, as he styles himself, 
(though I am convinced he has no more 
right to call himself so than either vou or 
I have) should write to him immediately, 
accusing him of having mentioiied his 
name in a disrespectful manner, of which 
his having done so a man is already pro- 
K 2 \ided 



76 THE DISCAP.DED SON. 

vided to swear, and demanding satisfaction 
for the same. Neither denial nor remon- 
strance on the subject are to be attended 
to; a duel they are determined to provoke; 
and the Count's second is to play your 
master the same trick with regard to the 
pistols, which the French Duke did." 

'' Is the person of my master/' asked 
Mactalla, whose countenance underwent 
various contortions, while listening to 
Jenkins, '' known to the German Count, 
or the fellow he has got to bear evidence 
for him?" 

"No," replied Jenkins, '' 'tis utterly 
unknown to them ; the Count was at- 
tended to the different places in which he 
sought him. by Lord O'Sinister in dis- 
guise." 

'' His Lordship, I suppose, thought you 
too conscientious to employ you in this 
pretty business," said Mactalla, in ra- 
ther an ironical tone, and viewing Mr. Jen- 
kins askance. 

" I only know," returned Jenkins, ''that 

like 



TFIE DISCARDED SON. 77 

like many other people in the world, he 
thinks more highly of new favourites, than 
he does of old ones. The German is every 
thing with him now; but I am mistaken if 
I have not done the rascal's business for 
him â€” yes, I am convinced the failure of 
the scheme now in agitation against your 
master vÂ»'ill occasion his dismissson, as my 
Lord will doubtless attribute it to his 
bungling; but remember, my dear friend, 
in putting your master up to their villany, 
you take care not to involve me in any 
scrape." 

Mactalla nodded significantly, and then 
desired to know at what time the letter he 
had spoken of might be expected ? 

'' In the course of the ensuing morn- 
ing,'* Jenkins replied. 

Mactalla a^ain nodded, and thev soon 
after separated, but not without Jenkins 
requesting to be timely apprised of his 
master's plans with respect to the German, 
that he might have the satisfaction of 
E 3 witnessing 



*o THE DISCARDFD SOX. 

witnessing his disappointment and dis- 
grace. 

The rage and indignation of Mactalla at 
the nefarious plot contrived against his 
master were so greats that on parting with 
Mr. Jenkins, he felt strongly tempted to 
repair to a magistrate, disclose the whole 
affair to him, and have Lord O'Sinister 
and his vile a^xents taken ud, as his in- 
tended murderers. When he came to 
reflect, however, on the consummate art 
of which his Lordship was possessed, the 
weight whi( h his r^nk and fortune would 
give to whatever he said, and the little 
probability there was of Jenkins being 
prevailed on to bear evidence against 
him, he abandoned this intention, as one 
more likely to injiire than to serve his 
master. Yet to ]tt his Lordship and his 
hireling:^ entirely escape punishment was 
not to be thought of. rXi'tcr iraich de- 
liberation on the sr.l)ject, he at length, 
having fully persuaded himself that he 

never 



THE DISCARDED SON". 79 

never could work upon his master to do 
what he wished on the present occasion^ 
formed the resolution of taking the affair 
entirely into his own hands, and of course 
concealing it from him. â€” '' I willj Iwiil/' 
he criedj capering about as the liea struck 
him; "I'll manage it entirely myself, for 
he's by the half too quiet for such big 
rogues; I'll try if I can't cure them of 
playing any more tricks upon travellers." 

He accordingly, in pursuance of this 
resolution^ kept a look-out for the ex- 
pected letter^ which at an early hour the 
ensuing morning he received from the 
hands of a waiter. He directly withdrew 
with it to his own chamber, where having 
perused it, he replied to it in the name 
of his master, appointing the Count, who 
in his billet merely expressed a wish for 
a private conference with Osmond, to call 
upon him at one o'clock, an hour at which 
he knew his master w^ould be engaged with 
the Duke D'Amalfi. 

As soon as Osmond had set out for his

the drawing-room^ to await the coming of 
his expected visitor. The interval of ex- 
pectation was chiefly employed by him in 
contemplating his figure in the glass^ and 
admiring the fashionable air his master's 
cloaths had given him. â€” " By St. Bene- 
dict/' cried he, as he gazed upon himself, 
^'biit its a true saying, that fine feathers 
make fine birds ; if I hadn't known who 
my father w^as, I should certainly have pass- 
ed for a gentleman in niy ovvnevesnow.'* 

The Count was piinctnai to his appoint- 
ment; he was ushered into the drawing- 
room by a lad whom Mactalla had en- 
gaged,^and properly instructed for the oc- 
casion. After the usual salutations were 
over â€” '' I have waited upon you, Sir/* 
said the Count, in a grufftone, and with a 
frowning aspect, '' about a very unpleasant 
business.'* 

'' I am sorry to hear that/' replied Mac- 
talla, coolly. 

'' Yes, 



THE DISCARDED SON. " 81 

'' Yes, Sir, upon an affair/' and the 
German tried to look important, " which 
I am afraid will not end but with the sa- 
crifice of one â€” it may be both our lives." 

"Then we are likely to have tight work 
of it/' observed Mactalla. 

'' Come, come. Sir, this light manner 
of speaking is unbecoming the afHiir in 
hand, and can answer no other end than to 
render still more severe the chastisement 
you have provoked from me.'' 

"For what, will you be kind enough 
to tell me?" said Mactalla. 

" For w^hat !" repeated the German; 
" do you then pretend lo%e ignorant of 
the injury you have done me, by publicly 
traducing my character. Sir?" 

" And pray who may have told you I did 
that?" asked Mactalla, with a smile, and 
the most perfect coolness. 
. " V/ho ! I have my witness at hand. 
Sir/' and as he spoke he hastily advanced 
to the door, and gave admissicn to a fellow 
who had accompanied hun to the hotei. â€” 
L 5 " This, 



82 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' This, Sir/' ci iecl he, pointing to the 
ruiiianj as he advanced into the room, for 
such both the business he had come upon, 
and his appearance, proclaimed him to be, 
''is the sfentleman â€” a orentleman.I must 
premise to you of the strictest honour and 
veracity, who heard you the other, even- 
ing, in a public room, call rne a gambler 
and a swindler." 

'' Well, if he had," said Mac'talla, " I 
dare say he'd have heard what he couldn't 
have given the He to." 

" What, this to my face !" thundered- 
out the German ; '' but you shall pay dear- 
ly for thus aggravating the insult you have 
ofiered me ; yes, yes, you shall know that 
the Count Sr.hwarten Gluckstade Langue- 
sala is not a person io be offended wuh

the satisfaction a gentleman has a right io 
insist upon, on such an occasion, I'll post 
you for a covÂ«*ard, and inflict manual 
chastisement upon you, wherever and 
whenever I meet you ; yes, I'll teach you

what it is/' pacing the room as he spokC;, 
in a seeming rage, '' to offend a man of 
honour â€” V\\ " 

" vSoftly, softly/' interrupted Mactalla, 
'*â–  what signifies putting yourself into such 
a passion? can't you take pattern by me^ 
man ? Don't you see how qufet and easy 
I am ? Whenever I am angry, I always 
make it a point to keep myself cool, that 
I m.ay be able to do what I wish v/ith plea- 
sure to myself and friends. From v^hat 
you have said, I suppose I am to under- 
stand that you wish for an opportunity of 
driving a bullet through my body ?" 

'' Jubt so^ Sir â€” just so/' replied the 
German. 

" And v/ny not say so in a quiet civil 
way ?" said Mactalla ; '' one word would 
just have done as well as a hundred." 

'' Sir, wrongs like mine are enough to 
make any man speak." 

*"' Aye, and fight too, it should seem," 

rejoined Mactalla â€” " And so, Mr. what's

your name," turfHiis*- to the Count's ac- 
coijiplice, '' \ou positively say you heard 
me the other night, abusing your good 
friend here. Count â€” Count â€” oh ! by the 
Powers, his godfathers and godmothers 
gave him too many names for me to re- 
member them/' 

" Hi swear it," returned the ijuffian. 

^' Oh, you need not give yourself the 
trouble," cried Mactalla, coolly ; " your 
word v/ill be believed as readily as your 
oath at any time, I am sure." 

" Yes, Sir/' vociferated the German, 
*' as sure as your name is Munro, he heard 
you traduce my character; so no more 
trifling, but say at once, will you give 
v^e the satisfaction I require for the in- 
jury ?- 

'*â–  Only point out a snug private place 
to meet you in,'* said Mactalla^ " and I 
am your man/' 

The Count turned to his companion, 

and after a little consultation, a lonely 

fitld, at a little distance from the city, was 

5 the 



THE DISCArOIiD SON. 85 

the place appointed for Mactalla to meet 
him in, in the course of an hour. 

'' And as to seconds/' continued the 
Count, '' we may as well dispense with the 
attendance of all but this gentleman/' 
glancing at his friend. 

Mactalla nodded^ as if perfectly satisfied 
with this arrangement; and the Count hav- 
ing previously charged him to be punc- 
tual, withdrew with his comnanion. 

The instant they were gone, Mactalla 
took off his master's clothes, and enveloped 
himself in a great-coat, beneath which he 
concealed a large oak stick he had pur- 
chased for the occasion. With the lad 
then already mentioned, driving before 
him a mule furnished with two large pan- 
niers, he proceeded to the place of ap- 
pointment. Within a few yards of it he 
caused the lad to retire with the mule be- 
hind a large clump of trees, and unaccom- 
panied advanced towards the Count, who 
with his second had preceded him to the 
ground. 

He 



86 THE DISGAPvDED SON. 

He very quietly suffered all the usual 
preparations for a duel to be made ; but 
on the pretended second presenting him 
with a pistol, he in return laid him pros- 
trate at his i^eet, with a blow of his oak cud- 
gel, and then rushing upon the Count, 
seized him by the collar,, and dashed the 
other pistol from his grasp. 

"'What's this for â€” what's this for?" 
roared out the struggling Count, in a ter- 
rified accent, and with the ghastliness of 
cowardice and conscious guilt. 

'' Merely to shew you," returned Mac- 
talla, '' how the boys in the county of 
Cork treat such big blackguards as vou 
are/' 

So saying, he fell upon the German just 
as if it was a sack of corn he had to thrash, 
between every stroke he laid upon him 
exclaiming â€” " This is the way, this is the 
way," to the unutterable amusement of 
Mr. Jenkins, who having called upon him 
at the hotel, and heard what was about 
taking place^ had followed his steps, for 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 87 

the purpose of witnessing the disorace and 
disappointment of his rival with Lord 
O'vSinister. 

The unfortunate German danced^ caper- 
ed, roared, supplicated, and finally pro- 
tested he would have justice. 

" Be easy man, be easy," cried Mactalla^ 
'' aint I administering justice as fast as I 
can ? you would have done m.e an injury, 
and I in return am inflicting a little gentle 
chastisement upon you, and if this is not 
justice, the devil is in't/' 

The Count's companion, who had merely 
received a blow across the shoulders, quicklv 
recovered his legs ; but perceiving Jenkins, 
and concluding he v;as come to the assis- 
tance of Mactaila, he took to his heels. 

Mactalla at length pretty well satisfied 
with the flagellation he had bestowed on 
the Count, threw him on the ground, and 
pulling some cords from his pocket, began 
tying his hands and legs. While doing 
this â€” '' Aye, aye, Mr. Count," he cried, 
*' by the Powers^ but I think you'll be m.ore 

careful 



88 THE DISCAPvDED SON. 

careful for the future how you get yourself 
into the hands of my countrymen ; you'll 
not be in a hurry again, I think;, to hire 
yourself to blow out the brains of an in- 
nocent man. By St. Benedict, I'd give 
all I am likely to be worth these ten years^ 
to have an opportunity of giving just such 
another dressing to the old rascal who em- 
ployed you ; but his turn will come yet â€” â–  
sometime or other he'll meet with bis 
deserts." 

Havinjr finished bindino; the Count, he 
called to the lad to lead forv>'ard the mule, 
which being done, he seated Count Schwer- 
tan Gluckstade Languesala in one of the 
panniers, to the great delight of Mr. Jen- 
kins, who clapping him on the shoulder, 
exclaimed in an exulting tone â€” '' By the 
Powers, as you say yourself, my dear 
friend, but you have done the business.'* 

" Neatly, I think," cried Mactalla, smil- 
ing and rubbing his hands, '' neatly ; but 
it's not quite finished yet." 

*' No ! why Vt'hat remains to be done ?" 

-Why, 



THE DISCAKDED SON. S9 

t 

â€¢' WhV;, to balance the Count with as 
great a scoundrel as himself/' and as he 
spoke he closed with Mr. Jenkins^ tripped 
up his heels in a moment, and producing 
some more cord, began binding him as 
he had done the Count. 

'^ Are you mad^ are you mad ?" roared 
out Jenkins. 

" No, neitiier so mad nor so stupid, as 
not to know that you played the part of 
second to that abominable old villain, 
your master, when he attempted the life 
of mine, and that with all your heart you 
would have entered into this second plot 
against him, had you been required. P^now^- 
ing this, you may therefore bless your 
stars that I let you off so easily ; if you 
have any regard for your back, I advise 
you to let me know in time, any roguish 
schemes that may be formed against him.'' 

Then, -in spite of all his entreaties and 
struggles, he placed him in the other pan- 
nier, and ordered the lad to drive forward 
the mule. 

Thus. 



90 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Thus did Mactalla enter Naples, and 
proceed to the house of Lord O'Sinister, 
in the Largo Castillo. He knocked at the 
door in the true style of a precursor of a 
carriage, in consequence of which the 
porter fully expected an equipage was 
approaching; but not perceiving one, 
he, after staring a few minutes in silence 
at Mactalla, enquired, in rather an angry 
tone, what had made him knock in such a 
manner ? 

''Are you Hind,'' asked Mactalla, '' that 
you don't see your ma:.ter*s friends ?" 

*' Where?'' demanded the porter, as 
did also several other servants, who were 
lounging about the hall. 

'' Vv'hy, yonder,'' replied Mactalla, 
pointing to the mule, '' in that new- 
fashioned carriage." 

The bursts of laughter which issued 
from the servants, at the sight he thus pre- 
sented to their view â€” a sight rendered 
doubly delectable by the hatred they bore 
Mr. Jenkins and the Count, quickly drew 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 91 

the rest of the domestics to the door, who 
sharing in their mirth, the uproar became 
so great as to attract Lord O'Sinister to a 
balcony, to learn the occasion of it. Mac- 
talla no sooner espied his Lordship, than 
retreating a little way from the door, so 
as to command a good view of him, he 
took off his hat and made him a pro- 
found reverence; after which he smiled 
significantly in his face, and pointed with 
his thumb over his shoulder to the mule. 
Then turning round, with the assistance of 
the boy, he took off the panniers, and, to 
use his own words, quietly and coolly 
emptied their contents upon the flags; af- 
ter which he again saluted his Lordship, 
with the same air of ironical respect he had 
before done, and retired, followed by the 
shouts and acclamations of the servants, 
and, we may also believe, the anathemas 
of his Lordship. 

On his return to the hotel, he {ound his 
master arrived before him, and heard that 
lie had been enquiring for him â€” '' I can't 

help 



92 THE DISCA-RDED SOX. 

help it," cried he, in reply to a waiter, 
who informed him he did not appear pleas- 
ed at finding him absent; '' a man can't 
be here, and there, and every where, at 
once." 

'' What's the matter?'' asked Osmond, 
who had overheard these words, as he en- 
tered the room. 

'''Matter! â€” matter enough have I had 
\ipon my hands this blessed day, or I won- 
der at it," returned he â€” '^ By the Powers, 
but that Count what-do-you-call-him is 
a stout strong fellow â€” if he had been born 
in England or Ireland, where he'd have got 
a little courage from the example of others, 
I shouldn't have found it quite so easy a 
matter to trounce him as I did; -but as it 
was, I think, I have trimmed his jacket 
neatly for him. â€” Ha, ha, Mr. Scowerten 
Backslide Long-as-a-sallct â€” that you are, 
as long as twenty of them, you'll not be 
in a hurry again, I think, to undertake such 
a barbarous business." 

''What do you mean?" demanded Os- 
mond 



THE DISCARDED SON". 93 

inond with quicknesS;, and turning round 
to survey him. 

'' Oh ! nothing more than that â€” that old 
sinner in the square yonder hasn't left 
off his tricks yet/' 

^^ Explain yourself/'* said Osmond^ evi- 
dently agitated. 

^' That I will/' replied Mactalla. He 
accordingly related to Osmond all that had 
lately occurred. 

Unspeakable v;as the amazement and 
indignation of Osmond, at the particulars 
he communicated to him. The silence 
which he had hitherto maintained, with 
regard to Lord O'Sinister's conduct towards 
him, he could no longer think of preserv- 
ing ; it seemed to him that his safety de- 
manded his being explicit on the subject. 
He accordingly resolved on acquainting 
the Duke D'Amalfi with the whole of it, 
and requesting his interference with his 
Lordship. 

His Excellency had just set off for a villa 
some miles distant from Naples, with a large 

party 



94 THE DISCARDED SON. 

party of friends, and thither Osmond de- 
termined to follow him immediately, as 
indeed he had been invited to do. A 
chaise was accordingly sent for, and in 
the course of an hoiif after his return from 
the field of battle, both Mr. Mactalla and 
his miaster were on their wav to the resi- 
dence of his Excellency. This villa, like the 
one at which they had received succour 
for \\\e wounded stranger, was rich in na- 
tural and artificial beauties; the house itself, 
built with an airy lightness suitable to the 
climate, was a m.odel of elegant architec- 
ture. A double flight of marble steps^ 
adorned en either side'with antique statues, 
led to its vestibule, supported by several 
beautiful Corinthian pillars, and opening 
into a spacious saloon enlightened by a 
dome of richly-stained glass, and decorated 
with all that painting and sculpture could do 
'for its embellishment. When the doors lead- 
ing from this to the sitting-rooms, and again 
the outer ones that opened from these apart- 
ments into different parts of the grounds,

"were thrown open, a scene of grandeur, 
beaiitVj and variety, was presented to the 
view, that defied description. 

A classic taste was everywhere apparent 
in the disposition of the grounds : a pleas- 
ing solemnity prevailed in front of the 
edifice; the lawn on which it stood w^as 
shadowed with noble cedars ; and over a 
winding stream adjoining this, and half 
shrouded from view by clustering thickets, 
a rude bridge was thro^vn, bespread with 
moss and ivy ; and ending in the arched 
entrance of a time-struck temple, the 
ruins of which, scattered amidst the deep 
masses of shade that covered the steep 
banks at this side, gave a picturesque effect 
to the whole. At the rear of the house, 
spacious walks extended, m.argined with 
parterres of the choicest flovvers^ and di- 
vided by groves of orange trees, and 
thickets of myrtle and roses ; from hence 
was cauo^ht a distant view of the olitterino: 
spires of Naples, backed by ranges of moun- 
tains gradually fading into air, and o'ertop- 

ped

ped by Mount Vesuvius, casting up fire and 
smoke, and veiling at intervals the bright 
azure of the cloudless skies, while through 
the luxuriant foliage of the elevated woods, 
the eye looked down upon the blue watei*s 
of the bay, enlivened by the light sails of 
innumerable vessels, and on its matchless 
shores. 

At this delightful retreat, at which Os- 
mond arrived just as its beauties were be- 
ginning to be veiled by the shades of twi- 
light, he found a large party assembled, and 
busy in preparing for a masquerade, that was 
to be given that night. As soon as he had 
paid his compliments to the Duke, who pro- 
fessed himself very agreeably surprised by 
his having so speedily followed him from 
Naples^ Osmond not having said any thing 
when they parted, calculated to make hisEx- 
cellency imagine such was his intention, he 
retired to change his dress, and equip him- 
self for the approaching entertainment, 
which he did by merely assuming a mask 
and domino; but neither the novelty of

the scene, (it being the first time he had 
ever been at an entertainment of the kind^ ) 
the magnificence that every where met his 
view, the harmonious strains that floated 
through the apartments, nor the gaiety 
of the crowd that filled them, could di- 
vert the uneasiness that preyed upon 
him, or for an instant dissipate the corrod- 
ing reflections the unaccountable conduct 
of Lord O'Sinister had excited. At length, 
fatigued with a scene, in the pleasures of 
which he could not participate, he with- 
drew to the garden, which was partially 
iiluminated. The lighted alleys, which 
were nearly as crowded as the room, he 
soon forsook for a distant walk bordered 
with beautiful groves, and where no other 
light prevailed than the soft shadowy light 
shed by the moon, now slowly rising above 
the wooded hills, nor any sound save the 
soft sighing of the zephyrs, and the mur- 
muring of waters. 

To the imposing tranquillity of this 
scene, the irritation of Osmond's feelings 
â€¢ ,,^V0L.V. ? gradually 



08 THE DISCARDED SO'X. 

gradually yielded. In a not unpleasant 
reverie, he wandered on till he came to 
the termination of the walk, which gradu- 
ally expanded, and ended in a large grass 
plat, of oval form, in the centre of which 
was a light circular temple of white marble, 
at each side of which played a beautiful 
fountain. Osmond seated himself in the 
temple, and gazed around him with the 
liveliest admiration. The grass plat was 
margined with the most delicious shrubs, 
and round the spacious walk that encom- 
passed it the groves compleatly swept^ 
and uniting in the rear, formed deep shades, 
now partially silvered by the moon ; but 
what particularly attracted his regard was, 
the beauty of the statues that decorated 
the fountains. After sitting some time 
to enjoy the profound stillness that reign- 
ed in this part of the garden, and the de- 
lightful freshness of the air, rendered cool 
by the ascending waters, he arose for the 
purpose of examining them. As he walked 
jround one of the fountains, he suddenly 

became 



THE DISCARDED SON. 09 

became motionless with admiration, at the 
sight of a figure seated on the edge of the 
white marble bason^ the head averted, and 
representing a female in an attitude of the 
most profound melancholy â€” The softness 
of the drapery, the exquisite manner in 
which the symmetry of the form was re- 
vealed through it, and the striking pen- 
siveness of the attitude, filled Osmond with 
no less wonder than admiration. While 
gazing, as if spell-bound, on this match* 
less specimen of art, he fancied he heard 
a deep sigh ; he listened attentively, but 
the sound not being repeated, concluded 
his ear had deceived him. At last his eye 
wandered in a different direction: quickly, 
however, it reverted to the object that had 
so fascinated it â€” He started, as it did, for 
the attitude appeared changed â€” "But, no, 
no," he cried, after gazing for an instant 
with a kind of fearful wonder on the figure 
â€” " no, it cannot be â€” my senses, bewil- 
dered by the various objects that have 
lately met my view, deceive me â€” yet no," 
F 2 he 



loo THE DISCARDED SON. 

he exclaimed, ''for the head now evi- 
dently moves/' 

He made an effort to seize the figure, as 
he saw it rising from the fountain ; but 
with a piercing shriek it eluded his grasp, 
and flew towards the walk up which he had 
come â€” He impulsively pursued. TJie agi- 
tation into which the incident had thrown 
him, made him feel his mask suffocating; 
he tore it off, and flung it away. In a few 
minutes he came up with the flying fugi- 
tive â€” he gently seized her robe, and be- 
sought her not to be alarmed. 

''Oh, Heavens!'' she instantly exclaim- 
ed, in an under-tone, and the next mo- 
ment dropt, apparently fainting, in his 
arms. 

'' Good God, of what has my temerity 
been the cause !'' cried Osmond. 

He looked wildly round him for assis- 
tance, but perceived no one at hand to 
administer any ; and after a little hesitation, 
resolved on bearing his fair burthen to the 
temple which he had just occupied^ On 

' depositing 



THE DISCARDED SON. 101 

depositing her there^ he took off her mask, 
in order to let her have the full benefit of 
the air, and eagerly casting his eyes on 
her features, beheld those of his beloved 
and lovely Cordelia. 

The rapture of this moment seemed to 
compensate to him for all the pain he had 
suffered on her account. He pressed her 
to his bosom â€” he pronounced her name 
in the softest, gentlest accent â€” he kissed, 
unconsciously, perhaps, as well as involun- 
tarily, her cheek, pale and cold, at the 
instant, as the marble of which, but a 
few minutes before, he had imagined her 
composed. At length she began to shew 
signs of returning animation â€” " Where 
am I ?'* she exclaimed, in a tremulous 
tone, as, her eyes opening, she looked 
wildly about her. 

" Safe, safe, my beloved â€” my Cordelia T' 
cried the enraptured Osmond, with irre- 
pressible emotion. 

'' Ah ! now I recollect all,'' she replied, 

lifting her eyes to his face as she raised her

head from his shoulder â€” " Good Heaven^ 
how little did I imagine I should have met 
yon here!'* 

'' And as little/" replied Osmond, '' did' 
I imagine such happiness was m store for 

me. Oh ! my may I/' he added, in 

a somewhat more timid accent, *' may I 
again venture to say, my Cordelia, what have 
I not suffered since we parted! but of this," 
and he gently took her hand, *' you must 
be a judge, when I tell you I despaired 
of ever meeting you again/' 

" Per â€” perhaps/' in a low and hesitat- 
ing accent, returned Miss Raymond, mak- 
ing an effort, but a vain one, to withdraw 
her hand from his, " it would have been 
better for both if we never had/' 

Osmond started â€” the chillness of death 
seemed to fasten on his heart â€” '' Better !" 
he repeated with difficulty â€” " better that 
we had never met again \ Oh, Miss Ray- 
mond ! â€” But I will not reproach youâ€” the 
inequality of aur fortunes forbids such a 
measure." 

*' As 



THE DISCARDED SON. 103 

^^ As would justiceâ€” as would humanity ! 
did you know the motive which actuated 
me to say so. â€” Yes^ I repeat, since destined 
to part for ever, it would have been better 
if we had never met again/' 

^^ To part for ever '/' repeated Osmond^ 
clasping his hands. 

Miss Raymond for an instant raised her's 
towards heaven, with a despairing look, 
and then pressed them on her bosom. 

^' That this should be the case/' she cried, 
'' that a lasting separation between us is in- 
evitable, you will not wonder, when I tell 
you that Lam^ '' 

'^ Oh, speak!" cried Osmondâ€”'' In pity, 
in compassion,'* and he dropt kneeling 
at her feet on finding her pause, '' declare 
why we must part â€” ignorance on such a 
subject i^ not endurable." 

''That J am," resumed Miss Raymond, 
after pausing a few minutes, during which 
her faee was covered with her handkerchief, 
" theâ€” â€” But see," she added, with a faint 
scream, starting up and stretching her arms

over the shoulders of Osmond, as he still 
continued kneeling before her â€” '' see my 
mother \" 

Osmond at these words hastily arose, and 
half turning, beheld a lady ascending the 
steps, in whose features, on advancing, he 
recognized those, of Mrs. Raymond. She 
suddenly stopt, and after surveying him 
and her daughter alternately for a minute, 
with the most scrutinizing earnestness, ex- 
claimed, in an accent expressive of astonish- 
ment as well as agitation â€” '' Good Hea- 
ven ! Mr. Munro here !" 

Miss Raymond, in trembling accents, ac- 
counted to her for being in the temple, 
attributing her having quitted the house to 
her having been overcome by the heat and 
noise. 

'' Have you explained to Mr. Munro,** 
demanded Mrs. Raymond, with evident 
emotion, ^^ the " 

Miss Raymond's eyes fell beneath the en- 
quiring glance of her mother â€” -" I intended 

to have done so," she said ; '' but ** 

'' Retire 



THE DISCARDED SON, 105 

^' . Retire then, my love/' returned her 
mother, '^ and I will take the painful task 
upon myself/' 

Miss Raymond bowed in sign of acqui- 
escence, and advanced to the steps. Osmond 
involuntarily started forward to hand her 
down them â€” ^' Are all my dreams of hap- 
piness then come to this?" he cried, in a 
tone of bitterness, as he presented his 
hand, or rather gently took her'sâ€” ^^ After 
being allowed to entertain such hopes â€” 
to indulge in such expectations, must I 
for ever be compelled to give you up ?'* 

Miss Raymond sighed â€” she hesitated â€” 
she paused on the last step. 

'' If to know the pain is mutual, which 
the disappointment of the expectations you 
allude to occasions, can afford you any con- 
solation, receive that consolation now,'' 
she said, in a low and trembling voice â€” 
'' receive it with my best wishes for your 
returning happiness â€” May â€” â€” "

Osmond started-^sighed- â€” pressed, for 
an instant, the trembling hand of the lovely 
Cordelia to his sinking heart, and then 
reluctantly, most reluctantly, resigning it; 
reascended the steps to Mrs. Raymond. â€” 
A silence of a few minutes ensued â€” Mrs. 
Raymond then began. 

" Most painful, as I have just said, is 
the task I have taken upon myself; equal 
to the happiness I should have derived from 
realizing the hopes I gave birth to in your 
bosom^ is the anguish I feel at being com^ 
pelled to destroy them." 

" Compelled!'' repeated Osmond, in- 
voluntarily, and v/ith reproachful bitter- 
ness â€” " Ah, Madam ! acknowledge that 
when you inspired them, you were not 
so sensible of your daughter's value as you 
are now," 

" Your

^'^ Your surmise is most unjust,'* returned 
Mrs* Raymond with quickness. â€” " I so- 
lemnly protest, in the sight of Heaven, 
that the change ih my intentions respect- 
ing you, is occasioned neither by pecuni- 
ary nor ambitious motives, but entirely 
by your having " 

^'What?'' exclaimed Osmond, grasping 
her hand, scarcely conscious of what he 
was about, his very soul appearing to 
hover on his lips â€” '' Oh, Madam, in mercy 
prolong not the tortures of suspense." 

*' Raised your hand against the life of 
her father !" said Mrs, Ravmond, finishing 
the sentence which agitation had inter- 
rupted. 

^' Raised my hand against the life of her 
father!- â€” the life of Mr. Raymond!" re- 
peated Osmond, aghast, and dropping the 
hand which he had seized â€” '' Great God ! 
who has accused me of such a crime ? Tell 
me, tell me. Madam," in vehement ac- 
cents he continued, the paleness of horror 
giving way to the glow of rage and indig- 
F 6 nation.

I may force him to confess he has given 
utterance to a falsehood.'* 

" Ah ! would to Heaven you could con- 
vince me that the accusation v/as a false- 
hood â€” would to Heaven you coiild con- 
vince me that your hand v/as never raised 
against Lord O'Sinister." 

'^ Lord O'Sinister I'* repeated Osmond, 
staring wildly at her â€” '' Lord O'Sinister V 
he again uttered, with almost breathless 
emotion â€” *â€¢" But â€” but," and he trembled 
through a prophetic fear, " Lord O'Sinis- 
ter and Mr. Raymond are not one." 

'' Alas! too truly.'' 

Again horror-struck, Osm.ond recoiled 
a few paces â€” "Gracious Heaven!" he in- 
wardly exclaimed, as he leaned his tremb- 
ling frame against a pillar, '' v/hat a dis- 
covery ! His Lordship's motives for wish- 
ing to force mc from Naples are now ex^ 
plained. But fcr imposing upon me in 
the manner he has done â€” for shrouding

titious name, what can have been the 
cause ? Ohj how much more successfully 
^vould he have checked my growing par- 
tiality for his daughter, by at once dis- 
covering himself to me, than by the mea- 
sures he adopted for the purpose ; had he 
at once revealed to me v^ho the fair object 
of my admiration was, honour and grati- 
tude w^ould have united to oppose my 
rising passion.'' 

That Mrs. Raymond, or as she should 
henceforth be called. Lady O'Sinisrer, had re- 
ceived an erroneous statement of all thathad 
passed between him and Itis Lordship, her 
words implied. As Osmond reflected on 
this, a faint hope sprung in his mind, that 
perhaps, if undeceived on the subject, she 
might again be induced to give counte- 
nance to his wishes respecting h.er daugh- 
ter â€” those wishes which she had so con- 
tributed to strengthen ; at all events, he 
deemed it due to his character, to endea- 
vour to clear it from the aspersions which^ 
he made no doubt, had been thrown upon

to collect his thoughts^ so as to be enabled 
to speak with some degree of composure, 
again approached her; scaixely^ however, 
had he commenced his intended vindicar 
tion, ere she interrupted him, 

'' 'Tis unnecessai'y for you^ believe me." 
she cried;,/' to enter into any vindication of 
your conduct; my esteem^ my regard for 
you rem.ain undiminished. â€” You look as- 
tonished at this assertion, wondering, no 
doubt, at my intentiorrs concerning yoii 
being changed, since my opinion of you 
continues the same ; but to account for 
their being so, know that the- public in ge- 
neral are so fully persuaded of your having 
attempted the life, of. her father, that for 
me to sanction your union v;ith my daughr 
ter, would be to draw upon myself a.lasting 
opprobrium." 

" And who, who," demanded Osmond,, 
indignantly, '' is the person who has im- 
pressed such a belief on the public mind?" 

'* A persoÂ»," returned her Ladyship^

ceeded. 

''Lord O'Sinister and Lhave long been 
on such termSy as would, some years baclc^

propose a separation, but that I was aware 
I could not separate myself from him with-^

abandon the sacred duties of a mother, and 
expose her to the pernicious influence of 
flattery and corrupt society, I determined

able were the mortifications which this de- 
termination drew upon me; but for all I 
have been more than compensated â€” Firsts 
By the consciousness of having done my 
duty^ and secondly, by the affection, ten- 
derness, and virtues of my Cordelia â€” vir- 
tues of which, from the first dawn of reason, 
she gave the fairest promise. Convinced 
by sad experience, that the most splendid 
is not always the happiest station, I have 
always been more solicitous for my daugh- 
ter's union with a man of principle than 
fortune. With your connexions, your 
character, your pursuits, and principles, 
I have long been intimately acquainted 
' â€” what I thought of these, ray sanction- 
ing the partiality between you and her 
must better testify than v/ords. I quickly 
perceived, and resolved on encourag- 
ing it, having in my own hands the power 
of launching you into life, in a man- 
ner suitable to her birth; and feeling con- 
vinced that she could not make a choice 
more calculated to ensure her happiness, 

I looked 



TIXE DISCARDED SON. 113 

I looked forward to the period of your 
union with impatience^ as to a period in 
which she would be snatched from the ca- 
prices of a tyrannical father, and I restored 
to domestic felicity â€” to all those social 
delights to which I had long been a stranger 
in the house of my husband : in shorty I 
indulged in a thousand exquisite anticipa- 
tions, which are now all^ alas ^ like the 
airy fabric of a vision^ dissolved, without 
leaving a wreck behind/' 

*' Oh, Madam/' in a voice scarce audi- 
ble, cried Osmond, " in pity spare me ! â€” 
Dwell not, dwell not, 1 conjure you, on 
the felicity that has been thus torn from 
my grasp/' 

'' Pardon me,'' said Lady O'Sinister, 
in a voice almost as broken as his own, 
and laying a trembling hand upon his 
arm â€” '' To be brief â€” my Lord conceived 
a suspicion of my designs respecting you 
â€”-this suspicion was sufficient to induce 
him to contrive a pretext for removing 
me and Miss Athelstone immediately from

returning to it rn the course of an hour; 
but instead of allowing this, he took us 
to a house which had;, previously to his 
coming to Naples, been engaged for him, 
where he had recourse to precautions that 
rendered it utterly impossible to have any 
communication with you. The restriction 
en his daughter's liberty and mine con- 
tinued till after your unfortunate rencontre 
with him.'' 

" Oh, Madam/' exclaimed Osmond, " I 
cannot avoid thinking that affair has either 
been grossly misrepresented, or cruelly 
exaggerated to you. The most insulting 
artifices " 

*' I am perfectly aware of all/' inter- 
rupted Lady O'Sinister, '' of the cruel 
machinations that were practised a^^ainst 
you ; but my believing you innocent is

on you, I am convinced I should forfeit 
that esteem which I have hitherto retained, 
though not without many painful sacrifices, 
my Lord, in order to try and lighten the 
enormity of his own conduct, having made 
it a point to villify mine â€” a proceeding 
which compelled me to be rigidly circum- 
spect in all my actions. Hitherto, in con- 
sequence of this circumspection, his slan- 
ders have gained no credit â€” But the world 
is prone to ill-nature ; 'tis ever eager to 
rob you of the applause it bestows. Be- 
sides, it judges from appearances, and I 
therefore make no doubt that if in the 
slightest instance I deviated from propriety, 
much more gave my daughter to the man 
who is generally believed to have raised 
his hand against the life of her father, I 
should unhesitatingly be accused of having^ 
played the part of a hypocrite to this period, 
and remain ever after an object of calumny. 
That the censure which we are conscious 
of not deserving, we should disregard, you 
may perhaps say; but when you reflect

A. DEEP sigh was Osmond's response to 
this observation of Lady O'Sinister. After 
a short pause â€” ''^ To what is inevitable/' 
resumed her Ladyship^ '^ your good sense

must endeavour to forget ''

will be looked for. Come/' added she, 
tenderly pressing his arm, and looking 
anxiously in his face, '' let me not part 
from you under the saddening idea of your 
yielding to this disappointment â€” promise

'' Tim.e, Madam," said Osmond, respect- 
fully pressing the hand she rested on his 
arm, and half averting his eyes to avoid 
her's, ^' time may enable me to overcome

Osmond sighed and shook his head de-

as hope to induce his Lordship to act in

^' His Lordship's persecuting enmity to-

dulging any expectation of the kind â€” Oh ! 
Madam, for this enmity â€” for his wishing 
too to conceal himself from my knowledge, 
can you assign any reason ?'' 

'' To say I could not, would be to utter

motives 



120 THE DISCARDED SON. 

motiv-es of the most delicate nature enjoirt 
me silence on the subject. Time may un- 
veil much to your knowledge; but let the 
discoveries you may yet make be what 
4liey may, I trust they will never banish 
from your recollection whose father â€” â€¢ 
whose husband Lord O'Sinister is.*' 

" Good Godl" exclaimed Osmond, in 
the most violent agitation, '' what mystery 
is couched beneath these words ? â€” Explain, 
explain. Madam, I conjure you, the im- 
port of them ! You have put me on the 
rack by what you have said â€” Tell me, has 
Lord O'Sinister done me any greater v/rong 
than I am aware of?'' 

Lady O'Sinister appeared alarmed and 
confused by this question â€” '' I repeat," 
returned she, '' what I haye just said, that 
relative to every part of his conduct not 
already known to you, my lips are sealed, 
I have wounded, and outraged my feelings, 
by the explicit manner in which I have al- 
ready spoken of him to you; nothing but 
absolute necessity could have induced me

to violate the laws of delicacy and decorum, 
by mentioning him in such terms. To 
prevent, however, any unnecessary un- 
easiness, permit me to assure you, that 
whatever were the nameless wrongs he me- 
ditated, they have been rendered abortive, 
by that good Providence which still 
watches over the children of the virtuous 
man."

few paces at these words, his eyes kind- 
ling, his cbeeks flushing to crimson, his 
breathing short, and interrupted by emo- 
tion â€” '' The children, said vou }â€”l now 
begin to develop the mystery â€” my sis- 
ter !"â€” He paused â€” paused to reSect on 
the various circumstance?, which, as they 
gradually occurred to his recollection, 
confirmed his conjecture of his sister's 
destruction having been attempted by Lord 
O'Sinister. The sudden manner in which 
he had made an offer of his patronage to 
his father â€” his immediately sending him- 
away from his family â€” the equally sudden

his Lordship, had ceased speaking of him â€” 
the broken hints, the hatred, the contempt 
in which Delacour held him â€” the vile cha- 
racter which his Lady gave him, all as re- 
view^ed by Osmond, convinced him that he 
wasnot mistaken inthissupposition â€” ''Yes, 
yes, the veil isnow completely rentaway,'Mie 
cried, ^^and he stands confessed a monster of 
depravity â€” yes, I now perceive that the ge- 
nerosity which called forth such warm, such 
heartfelt acknowledgments, was assumed for 
the purpose of betraying innocence â€” that 
he only afiected benevolence, to obtain an 
opportunity of inflicting wounds, which 
human pity could not have healed : but he 
shall not go unpunished. It was not his 
fault that my sister escaped his snares, and 
by Heaven he shall experience the pu- 
riishment he merits, for ever having sought

I love be doubled in his own ; in the hor- 
rors of remorse may his nights be spent â€” 
his days in vain efforts to elude them ;

'' Go on/' interrupted Lady O'Sinister, 
in a tone of the most reproachful bitter- 
ness; *''^cal] down still deeper maledictions 
on his head ; to complete his punishment, 
pray that he may go childless to his 
gi-ave." 

Osmond started, and instantly recollect- 
ed himself. â€” ''Ah, Madam/* l\e exclaimed^ 
''surely the severity of that speech was not 
merited â€” surely some littleallowanceshoiild 
be made for feelings like mine ! â€” yet I ac- 
knowledge â€” candidly acknowledge myself 
in error^ for having suffered them to 
transport me so far in your presence/' 

" Be assured I neither wonder at, nor 
resent their having done so/' replied her 
Ladyship ; " but though I acknowledge 
this, I cannot forbear conjuring you to 
moderate their violence,â€” My Lord has

not escaped punishment, believe me, and 
that too ofa severe nature, for the injury he 
meditated against your sister, and I so un- 
fortunately, by means of an unguarded ex- 
pression, have betrayed to you ; let the 
knowledge of this, therefore, appease 
your resentment. To pursue its dictates 
would be to betray to your father what 
he at present; is happily ignorant of, and 
thus, in all probability, draw greater evils 
upon your family, than any they have 
yet experienced. Let me conjure you, 
therefore, to think no more of what^ you 
have so unexpectedly discovered." 

'' I will not promise what is impossible," 
answered Osmond, after a silence of some 
minutes, during which he appeared buried 
in reflection. '^ My senses must be com- 
pleatly steeped in forgetfulness, ere I can 
cease to think of what I have heard ; but 
I will promise to leave it to the hand of 
Heaven, to avenge the wTongs of the in- 
jured." 

'^^ Enough/-' said Lady O'Sinister; ''that 

promise

promise completely satisfies me: and now^ 
my dear â€” dear young friend^ we must part; 
a long interval may elapse ere we meet 
again ; but trust me^ neither time nor dis- 
tance will lessen the regard I entertain for 
you â€” nothing but your dereliction from 
the virtues Vv'hich made me adopt the idea 
of giving you the treasure of my life can 
diminish it. To hear of yonr happiness^, 
to be instrumental to it, will add to mine. â€” - 
Of the liberal patron you have found in the 
Duke D'Amalfi, I am not ignorant ; but 
should you in process of time find a con- 
tinuance in this country unpleasant â€” â€¢ 
should you, in short, require another 
friend, I trust, instead of seeking a nev/ 
one, you vv^ill apply to your old one/* 

" Oh, Madam/' cried the greatly agi- 
tated Osmond, alm.ost convulsively grasp- 
ing the hand which, as she uttered the last 
words, she extended to him, '' this is a 
cruel kindness â€” since doomed to lose the 
pleasure resulting from your society, ag- 
gravate not the pangs of that doom, by

giving me still greater reason to regard 
you/' 

'' Adieu, then/' returned her Ladyship^ 
and for an instant she pressed with fervour 
his hand between hers ; " may Heaven bless 
and for ever prosper you ; never, never 
shall I cease considering you as my son â€” 
never, never/' she repeated, but in an 
under and broken voice, ''shall I cease la- 
menting your not being so in reality.'' â€” 
Then again bidding him adieu, she broke 
from him, and precipitately retired. 

Osmond, with despairing eyes, pursued 
her receding steps ; when she was no lon- 
ger visible, he threw himself, in an agony 
too great for description, upon the spot 
where they hnd parted. â€” " Thus, thus, 
then/* he wildly exclaimed, ''end all mv 
fond, my flattering hopes ! Oh, '.vhv â€” 
why was I perm/itfed to indulge in such, 
since destined to have them disappoint- 
ed Â»" 

He now raved with all the violence of 
resentment against the cruel and unprinci- 
pled- 



THE DISCARDED SON, 1 27 

pTed author of his iinhappiness; then again 
softened into tenderness at the recojlecticn 
of Lady OSinister's kindness. Her con- 
duct now appeared to him in a morenobie 
light than it had ever done before ; since^ 
from the explanation that had just taken 
place^ he was convinced she had been ac- 
tuated to give him her daughter- â€” :he trca-- 
sure of her liTe^ as she emphatically stvled 
her, chiefly by a wish to make atone- 
ment to hini for the injuries his family 
had experienced from her Lord When 
he thought cf those injuries â€” when he 
thought cf Lord O'Sinister's having me- 
ditated the destruction of his sister, he 
spurned at himself for regretting the idea 
of not being allied to him : but the feel- 
ings which occasioned this indignation 
against himself, were but transient ; love, 
almighty love, quickly resumed his em- 
pire over him, and every nerve throbbed 
with anguish at the thoughts of being for 
ever separated from Cordelia. In the bit- 
terness of disappointment he was at first 
G 4 tempted 



128 THE DISCAEDED SON. 

tempted to accuse Lady O'Sinister of sa- 
crificing too much to the public opinion ; 
but a Jittie retiection convinced him a 
%voman of delicacy could not have acted on 
the present occasion in any other manner 
than she did. 

From the temple he repaired to the 
spot where he had so unexpectedly beheld 
the lovely girl. He threw himself on the sod 
which her feet had so recently pressed^ he 
bent over the waters which had reflected 
her image, and with which he had every 
reason to believe her tears had mingled. â€” 
Yes, her sighs, her attitude, her with- 
drawing from the gay and brilliant assem- 
bly in tlie house, all convinced him that 
sorrow was seated at her heart, as did 
equslly her exclamation, her fainting, at 
discovering him, that he was the cause of 
that sorrow. 

He continued wandering about the gar- 
dens till the dawn of morning, when per- 
ceiving he could no longer escape obser- 
vation in them, he retreated to the house, 

and 



THE DISCARDED SON. 129 

and desired to be shewn to a chamber. â€” 
This being done, Mactalla, but without 
being called for, was sent to him. Ab- 
sorbed in the most saddening reflections, 
Osmond for some time heeded not the 
strange grimaces, and broken exclama- 
tions of his valet. At length he was roused 
to something like attention, by Mactalla's 
saying, as he took his coat from him â€” 
'" How unfortunate, how^ unfortunate !" 
and turning hastily to him, demanded 
what ? 

'' Oh, nothing," replied Mactalla, as he 
folded up his coat, and laid it upon a 
chair, '' but that you should fall in love 
with the daughter of the devil." 

'' How !" exclaimed Osmond, starting, 
and surveying him with a kind of wild ear- 
nestness. 

'"Aye, its too true," returned Mactalla. 
*^ I have found it all out." 

" Found what out ?" asked Osmond, 

with the utmost impatience; ''^ don't let 

G 5 me 



130 THE DISCARDED SON. 

me be tortured now with one of your 
round-about stories." 

'' Oh faith I wish the story I have to tell 
you was as sweet as it is short. â€” As I was 
amusing myself on the lawn with looking 
at the company coming and going, and 
dancing about in groups, like fairies by 
anoonlight, who should I see but your 
beautiful mistress, and her handsome mo- 
ther^ coming towards a carriage, with that 
old fox, Mr. Raymond, as I thought him. â€” 
Oh ho, says I to mvsclf, on seeing them, 
here will be good news for my master; so I 
turned to a servant of the Duke's, who was 
with me, and asked him where that gen- 
tleman, nodding at Mr. Raymond, lived? 
â€” What, Lord O'Sinister? said he. â€” Lord 
O'Sinister, repeated I; pho^ pho, no, not 
Lord O'Sinister, but that gentleman, â€” and 
I again looked at the supposed Mr. Ray- 
mond. â€” Why, man, I tell you, said he, 
that the gentleman you are looking at is 
Lord O'Sinister, an English. Nobleman, 

who 



THE DISCARDED SON. 131 

who has a villa adjoining my Lord's, 
with whom he has lately become very 
intimate/' 

" Intimate \" echoed Osmond^ involun- 
tarily, and with a presageful idea, that 
if this were true, he should not much 
longer enjoy the friendship of his Excel- 
lencv. 

'' Yes/' replied Mactalla, " I enquired 
into all the particulars, and so found 
that it was true enouo;h." 

'' I hope," said Osmond, ^' you made 
no observation relative to his Lordship." 

*^' Me V returned Mactatla, somewhat 
confused, " no not a word did 1 say about 
him/' 

'' Not one word?" asked Osmond, in an 
incredulous tone. 

" No, by the Powers, not one, but that he 
wasan old rogue, and that it was a thousand 
pities he didn't break his neck clamber- 
ing over the Appen nines." 

*^ Ah, I thought something of the kind,"' 
G 6 cried 



135 THE DISCARDED SON. 

cried Osmond^ vshaking his head; '' in fu- 
ture I must request^ nay insist^ on your 
silence with regard to him." 

He then having extorted a promise to 
this effect from Mactalla^ dismissed him^ 
and threw himself half undressed upon the 
couchj which he quitted in the course of 
a few hours^ without having once closed his 
eyes, and with both an aching head and 
heart, and also a resolution not to touch 
on the subject which he had left Naples 
for the purpose of consulting with the 
Duke on, since he had discovered Lord 
O'Sinister to be the father of his Cordelia. 

While dressing, Mactalla made his ap- 
pearance, and brought him a message 
from his Excellency, requesting his com- 
pany to breakfast, ttte-a-tete with him in 
his library. 

Osmond hastened thither, and was re- 
ceived by his noble patron with his usual 
condescension ; the attendants were dis- 
missed^ and they sat down to breakfast alone. 

After 



THE DISCARDED SON. 133 

After a little desultorv^ conversation^ 
principally relative to the entertainment 
of the preceding night, the Duke suddenly- 
turning a scrutinizing glance upon Osmond, 
said â€” '' You don't look well, my young 
friend, this morning ; I'm much inclined 
to imadne this climate does not a<2Tee with

Osmond sio^hed heavi!v. â€” '' Would that 
I had not more reason to complain of 
other matters," cried he, involuntarily, 
'' than I have of it." 

'' Indeed ! and pray may T, without the 
charge of impertinence, enquire what it is 
you have to complain of?" 

Osmond recollected himself, and blushed 
deeply at his inadvertence. â€” " Nothing 
worth your Excellency's listening to," re- 
turned he. 

A silence of some minutes followed 
these words, during which the Duke ap- 
peared both thoughtful and embarrassed.

â‚¬)smond-iâ€” '' My young friend/' said he, 
with a forced smile, I am afraid you will 
think strangely of me, when I tell you that 
I should not have been sorry to have 
heard you acknowledge I was not mis- 
taken/' 

Osmond started and stared^ as well in- 
deed he might, with astonishment. 

'' The truth is/' proceeded his Excel- 
lency, after another pause, " my having 
taken a foreigner under my protection, 
and given him a situation which many na- 
tives of the kingdom solicited in vain, has 
caused such general discontent, that I â€” I/' 
hesitating greatly, and rather shunning 
the penetrating eyes of Osmond, '' find 
myself in a most aw^kvvard predicament, 
insomuch that I should not have been sorry 
to havevfound you disinclined to continue 
here/' 

'' Then be satisfied, my Lord," said Os- 
mond, rising involuntarily from the table, 
his face suffused with the dov/ of indigna- 

tion^

tion^ *'^for I am disinclined to continue her6 
â€” to continue where treachery pursues me 
wherever I go/' 

^*' Treachery!" repeated the Duke, also 
quitting the table ; '' pray explain your- 
self; for I â€” I really am at a â€” a loss," but 
again hesitating, so as to convince Osmond 
he was insincere in the assertion, *' to com- 
prehend your meaning/' 

^'Excuse me, my Lord/' said Osmond^ 
again recollecting himself, aftd in a respect- 
ful but decided tone; '' neither explana- 
tion nor recrimination would, I am confi- 
dent, be availing here; nor shall I longer ob- 
trude upon your Excellency's time, than to 
entreat that from this instant you would 
consider yourself extricated from the un- 
pleasant predicament in which you stand 
on my account^ as the situation you were 
so graciously pleased to bestow on me is 
again at your Excellency's disposal/' 

" Nay/' cried the Duke, evidently hurt, 

'' you wrong me^ if you suppose, by what 

5 I said^ 



13G THE DISCARDED SOX, 

I said, that I meant you should resign it 
immediately.'' 

'' If your Excellency thought I would 
not," replied Osmond, warmly, ''you must 
have had a very ignoble opinion of me." 

"Well/' said the Duke, ''I must insist 
on your accepting such an equivalent for 
it as shall enable you to settle yourself 
with comfort in your own country/' 

" Pardon me, my Lord/' returned Os- 
mond, haughtily and firmly, " I will nei- 
ther wound my own feelings, nor suffer 
your Excellency to run the risk of having 
your's wounded, by again receiving any 
additional obligation from you ; all I re- 
quire from your Excellency is common jus- 
tice â€” that you will allow it to be generally 
understood, that your gift to me was not 
revoked on account of any unworthiness 
on my part." 

" Depend upon it," returned the Duke, 
equivocally, " I will not say any thing to 
injure you ; your conduct to the Acerenza 

famihv, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 137 

family, were I even inclined to do so^ 
would prevent me/' 

'' My conduct whilst I enjoyed the pa- 
tronage of your Excellency, would equally 
do so, I should hope/* returned Osmond, 
with en creasing warmth. 

The Duke's brows contracted, his sallow 
cheek became flushed ; he drew back a few 
paces, and measured Osmond with a scorn- 
ful eye.â€” " Young man,*' he then haugh- 
tily said, " recollect yourself/' 

Osmond turned in indignant silence 
from him, and paced the room for a few 
minutes, ere he would trust himself to 
speak again ; then pausing â€” '' I see, I see," 
cried he, in a tone of .mingled dejection 
and bitterness, " in this business the 
cloven foot that has so long pursued m.e. 
That your Excellency has a noble heart, I 
believe,*' added he; *' provoke not, there- 
fore, that remorse which the noble heart 
never fails of experiencing for injuring the 
innocent, bv suffering yourself to be pre- 
vailed on to villify my character/* 

'' Come, 



13S THE DISCARDED SON. 

'*â–  Come, come. Sir/* hastily said his Ex- 
cellency^ " be rational, and instead of ad- 
moHishing, suffer yourself to be admo- 
nished ; I ask no explanation of your am- 
biguous sayings, but merely advise you, 
instead of any longer wasting your time in 
idle pursuits in Naples, to return without 
delay to your native country, in which I 
again offer to provide you Vvith the means 
of settling yourself.'' 

" Worlds should not tempt me to accept 
that offer; but though I decline^ I entreat 
your Excellency to believe I am truly 
grateful for it/' 

"Well, Sir, I am sorry to find your 
pride so excessive; should it lower, you 
will find me sfill ready to perform what I 
have offered/* 

'' That I should ever again trouble your 
Excellency, seem.s most unlikely, as it 
is my intention to follow your advice, 
by immediately setting olf for Eng- 
land.'* 

'^ I rejoice to hear so/' returned the 

Duke, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 139 

Duke, in an accent that permitted Osmond 
to have no doubt of his not having now 
spoken with sincerity: '^ Come, disdain 
not good counsel ; be a friend to yourself, 
by suffering rne to prove one to you/* 

*' I have already taken the liberty of 
mentioning how your Excellency can do 
so/' replied Osmond; ''let not my cha- 
racter be aspersed^ when I am no longer 
at hand to vindicate it, and you will 
indeed give yourself a claim to the title of 
one/' 

He then begged permission to take an 
immediate leave of his Excellency, which, 
after a little hesitation, was granted him. 

The chaise which had brought him from 
Naples v;as still in waiting at the villa; 
and in a few minutes after he had bid adieu 
to the Duke, he was on his way back, 
for X\\c purpose of making immediate 
preparations for his departure for Eng- 
land. 

During his vshort journey various were 
the changes his mind underwent, and vio- 
lent 



140 THE DISCARDED SOX. 

lent the struggles he experienced. â€” 
That it was some vile allegation of Lord 
O'Sinister's, which had occasioned the 
Duke to withdraw his patronage froni hnn, 
he had not the smallest doubt, as but the 
preceding morning his Excellency had ex- 
pressed a hope of his having relinquished 
all thoughts of returning to England; 
and in the height of the resentment and 
indignation which this cruel treachery, this 
unprovoked enmity of his Lordship's in- 
spired him with, he was almost tempted to 
hasten back, and in the presence of the 
Duke confront him with his villainy. No- 
thing but consideration for the feelings of 
Lady O^Sinister, and her lovely and be- 
loved daughter, v;ithheld him from this 
measure, although almost convinced any- 
thing he advanced in opposition to the 
statement of his Lordship would be un- 
availing, since not supported by the testi- 
mony of any one who could have weight 
with his Excellency. 

On his arrival at the hotels he was in- 
formed 



THE DISCARDED SON. 141 

formed by a waiter that an old gentleman 
had come to lodge there that day^ who 
had very particularly enquired for him^ and 
requested to see him the instant he re- 
turned. That this was the stranger whose 
life he had been instrumental in saving, 
Osmond had no doubts and sincerely did 
he rejoice at his recovery; but notwith- 
standing, felt so unwilling, from the state 
of mind he was then in, to visit him, that 
he was on the point of desiring his re- 
turn might be concealed, when benevo- 
lence suddenly interposed, and induced 
him to repair to his apartment. 

He found he was not 'mistaken in his 
conjecture, and was received with the 
most flattering demonstrations of gratitude. 

'^^ My son â€” my friend â€” my preserver !" 
cried the old gentleman, or, as we shall 
in future stvle him, Signor Barbarino, 
such being the name he gave himself, 
eagerly extending his hands as he spoke 
to Osmond^ '^ words cannot do justice 

to 



142 THE DISCARDED SON. 

to the gratitude your conduct;, your unre- 
mitting enquiries, and the generous mo- 
tive which actuated you to leave your ad- 
dress for me, has inspired ; but thank God, 
for the sake of others I thank him, po- 
verty is not amongst the evils I groan 
under. Could riches alone confer hap- 
piness, I were then supremely blessed ; 
but praised be Heaven I have lived to 
find they cannot! â€” for but for my con- 
viction of their inability to do so, I might 
have died in enmity with those whom 
I am bound by the laws of nature to love 
and serve. â€” Oh, by so long keeping my 
heart closed against them, what days â€” what 
years of felicity have I not lost !" 

'' My dear Sir," said Osmond, " but 
few, 1 believe, pass through life w^ithout 
some cause of reproach against themselves. 
â€” For the errors we commit we must hope 
we shall obtain forgiveness by repentance 
and atonement." 

He then, anxious to give a turn to the 

conver- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 143 

conversation from the effect he saw it was 
likely to produce upon the debilitated 
frame of the invalid, mentioned the reason 
of his not having made personal enquiries 
after him. 

" I am sensible of your kind considera- 
tion for me in every instance/' returned 
Signor Barbarino; '' but/' and he looked 
anxiously as well as tenderly in the coun- 
tenance of Osmond, " I fear you have not 
had the same consideration for your- 
self" 

Osmond heaved a' deep sigh, and bent 
his eyes to the ground. â€” " Of bodily in- 
disposition/' replied he, '' I have no cause 
to complain." 

'' But of mental; I understand you V* 
eagerly exclaimed the other; '' tell me â€” 
tell me,*' laying his hand, with trembling 
emotion on the arm of Osmond, " is the 
affliction under which you labour one that 
friendship can relieve ?" 

Osmond shook his head despondently. 
" My dear Sir/* cried he, pressing the 

feeble 



144 THE DISCARDED SON. 

feeble hand which rested on his arm^ ^' be 
assured I am truly grateful for the solici- 
tude you express about me ; but time 
alone can relieve the affliction you have 
noticed/' 

" That it may speedily do so, shall be 
one of my most fervent prayers/' returned 
Sign or Barbarino. 

Osmond testified his gratitude for this 
speech by a bow, and both in the course 
of a few minutes becoming a little more 
composed, he learned that Signor Barba- 
rino was not a native of Italy, but had 
visited Naples solely for the purpose of 
recovering a large sum of money due to 
him by a merchant there, and that he was 
on the point of quitting it, when in a so- 
litary ramble with an old confidential ser- 
vant, whose unhappy fate he deplored 
with tears, he met with the dismal adven- 
ture which introduced him to the know- 
ledge of Osmond. 

After a little further conversation, Os- 
mond arose to take his leave for the pre- 
sent. 



TKE DISCARDED SON. 145 

sent. Signor Barbnrino looked both sur- 
prised and disappointed. â€” '' I ^m\y ex- 
pected/* said he, '' to have had the plea- 
sure of your company this day, and trust, 
as well as entreat, you will not disappoint 
me.*' 

'^ I assure you, my dear Sir,*' replied 
Osmond, 'â€¢' nothing should prevent m.y 
spending it with you, but my being 
under a necessity of making immediate 
arrangements for my departure from Na- 
ples.*' 

" From Naples ! â€” and pray may I en- 
quire whither you are going ?'* 

*' To England." 

"To England! â€” good Heaven, how for- 
tunate V exclaimed Signor Barbarino, in 
a tone of extacy. 

â€¢' Fortunate !*' repeated Osmond, i!i vo- 
luntarily, and w^ith a look of astonish- 
ment. 

" Yes ; for I am about departing for thai 

. kingdom myself; and came hither as much 

for the purpose of trying to prevail on

146 THE DISCARDED SON. 

you to accompany me thither, as for that 
of thanking you for your kindness and at- 
tention to me. Will you permit me to 
travel with you ?" 

*' Most willingly, my dear Sir." 

'^ I am going thither/' resumed the old 
gentleman, " in quest of what I have long 
been a stranger to â€” happiness ; 'tis there 
only I can recover it â€” there only I can 
make expiation for my manifold sins and 
offences !" 

Osmond looked at him with encreased 
astonishment, and nothing but politeness, 
and the consideration that he could not ask 
his confidence without granting him his in 
return, which many reasons militated 
against his doing, prevented his giving 
utterance to the curiosity which his mys- 
terious language excited. 

'^ All my arrangements are already 
made," proceeded Signor Barbarino, '^ so 
that whenever you choose to depart, I am 
ready to attend you." 

Osmond replied it was his intention to 

set 



THE DrSCAIlDED SON. 147 

set out the ensuing da}% if he^ Signer Bar- 
barino, had no objection. 

" On the contrary," he answered, to the 
great satisfaction of Osmond, who was 
anxious in the extreme to quit Naples, lest 
a longer continuance in it should expose 
him to some new insult from Lord O'Sinis- 
ter, that would compel him to pass those 
bounds he had prescribed to himself with 
regard to his Lordship, out of respect to 
the feelings of his lady and daughter. 

Their plans finally adjusted, and his pro- 
mise given that he would return to dine 
with Signor Barbarino, he withdrew from 
his apartment to his own, for the purpose 
of commencing preparations for his depar- 
ture, and apprising TvLictalla, while he had 
the power of making a choice, of the pro- 
bability ihere was of his not being able to 
retain him in his service after his arrival 
in England. 

*' Well, that shan't prevent my going 

with you there," said Mactalla^ as soon as 

he had a little recovered the surprise which 

H 2 the 



148 THE DISCARDED SON. 

the unexpected information of Osmond 
had occasioned him. ''No, no, by the 
Powers, I wouldn't give up the chance of 
remaining in your service, for any offer 
that could be made me here." 

'' I can only say in return/' said Os- 
mond, " that I trust fortune will yet smile 
sutTiciently to enable me to reward, in the 
manner 1 wish, your faithful attachment.'* 

'' Tut, tut. Sign or, don't speak of re- 
warding a man for doing what is agreeable 
to himself. I like and love you, and that 
is the reason I stay with you.'*â€” Then, 
after a short pause, '' to be sure there is 
one thing I should like to have done be- 
fore I leave Italy.'* 

^' What may that be ?'* asked Osmond. 

''Why, Signor, to ^et a few lines wTit- 
ten, to have placed at the head of my fa- 
ther's grave, for the purpose of letting 
people know w ho he was. There he lies in 
the church-yard of Acerenza, without any 
oneknowingany thing of the matter; which, 
seeing he was a brave soldier, fought many 

severe 



THE DISCARDED SON. .149 

severe battles^ and received innumerable 
wounds, I think rather a hard case/' 

^' You want an epitaph for him/* said 
Osmond, smilinpr at the pride his valet 
betrayed in wishing to perpetuate the name 
of his father. 

'^ The very thing/' replied Mactalla, joy- 
fully ; " if I could but get somebody to 
write one, there is a young man belong- 
ingto Acerenza nowin Naples, who I know 
I could depend on for getting it engraved 
on the tomb-stone/' 

" Well, suppose I was to invoke a muse 
on this occasion/' asked Osmond, '' what 
should I say of the virtues of your fa- 
ther?" 

'' The virtues,'' repeated Mactalla, as if 
a little puzzled by the question, and rub- 
bing his head, thoughtfully; " why I can't 
pretend to say, Signor, that he was very 
sober, nor yet very quiet ; the truth is, 
indeed, he was a devil of a drinker and 
fighter/' 

" Well, but doubtless he was steady in 
H 3 his 



150 THE DISCARDED SON. 

his attachments, coiKtftant to his wife> 
and " 

'' Ahj the less. Signer/' interrupted 
Mactalla, shaking his head, '' we say on 
that subject, I believe, the better, at lea^t, 
if the word of my mother was to be 
taken/* 

' '' Well," returned Osmond, again smil- 
ing, '^bravery, like charity, covers a mui- 
titude of faults; so your father shall be 
handed down to posterity as a good 
man." 

He accordingly sat down to a writing- 
table, and in a few minutes wrote the pro- 
mised epitaph, to the unspeakable delight 
of Mactalla. 

Osmond had no farewel visits to pay in 
^aples^; as soon, therefore, as the neces- 
sary arrangements for his departure were 
made, he repaired to his new friend, and 
passed the remainder of the day with him, 
and the next morning, as agreed upon, 
embarked v.ith him, their ba<r ;raoe and va- 
lets, on board a vessel in the Bay of Naples. 

Their 



THE DISCARDED SON. 151 

'Their voyage we shall pass over in si- 
lence, nothing occurring in the course of it 
worth mentioning^, and content ourselves 
^v/ith saying, they arrived in safety at Fal- 
mouth. 

Osmond landed without knowing to what 
part of the kingdom Signer Barbarino was 
bound, nor did he learn, till he waÂ«3 about 
setting off for Scotland, when the old gen- 
tleman acquainted him he was also going 
thither, and into his immediate neigh- 
bourhood, and therefore begged he might 
be allowed to pursue the remainder of his 
journey with him. 

In this request Osmond readily acqui- 
esced ; he had gradually indeed conceived 
such a prepossession in favour of the old 
gentleman, who, though often despond- 
ing, and always mysterious, was neverthe- 
less a pleasing companion, that he could 
not think of biddinr: him adieu without 
regret ; neither in the course of their jour- 
ney could he altogether suppress the cu- 
riosity he hh to know to whom he was 
II 4 goii^jg 



152 THE DISCABDED SON. 

goin|: in his neighbourhood ; his enquiry 
on this subject, however^ was evaded in 
a manner which prevented his renewing 
it. 

At a sinall town about three miles from 
Heathwood, Osmond took leave of him, 
but with a promise of seeing him again 
the ensuing day, till when he avowed an 
intention of remaining where they had 
alighted. Here also Osmond was induced, 
by his uncertainty concerning the present 
situation of his family, to leave Mactalla 
for the present â€” a circumstance v/hich was 
extremely agreeable to Sign or Barbarino, 
as he had taken a very particular fancv to 
the m.erry valet of his young friend, inso- 
much that at all times he preferred his at- 
tendance to that of hh own servant^ prc- 
bably owing to the gratification he afforded 
his curiosity relative to Osmond, about 
whom and his family he sought opportuni- 
ties of askii^g questions. 

A carriage not being immediately to be 
procured, Osmond proceeded to the habi- 
tation 



THE DISCARDED SON. 153 

tation of his father on foot. As he drew 
near the beloved spot^ endeared to his af- 
fections by being at once the residence of 
those most dear to his regard, and the 
scene of his purest felicity â€” the only feli- 
city he had ever yet experienced without 
alloy^, his heart swelled with a thousand 
delicious sensations â€” a thousand delightful 
anticipations; and spite of all the vexa- 
tion he had lately experienced^ the disap- 
pointment of his fondest hopes^ the wounds 
inflicted on his heart by treachery, he would 
have felt happy at the moment, but for 
the uncertainty above alluded to â€” the con- 
jectural fearo which a review of Lord O'Si- 
nister's conduct caused him to be agitated 
bv. 

Ix was now the latter end of Febrnarv, 
but as yet the brownness of Winter had in 
no place given way to the verdure of 
Spring, and the dreariness of the faded 
landscape was encreased by the wintry 
music of a cold and rustling wind, and the 
gloom of closing day^ for it was late when 
H 5 Osmond 



154 THE DISCAKDED SON. 

Osmond set out for Heathwood. But when 
he caught a glimpse of his native home, 
fear and melancholy were alike dissipated. 
He bounded forward, but on a sudden stop- 
ped, horror-struck at beholding the house 
shut up, without the smallest indication of 
its being inhabited. 

^' Oh God!" he exclaimed, in agony, 
^' what an ominous sight is this ! Has 
death been busy here â€” have I returned 
only to mcurn over the ashes of my pa- 
rents !'* 

He hastened to the gate; he knocked and 
called aloud; but the mournful echo of 
his own voice was the only sound that met 
his ear, save the melancholy lowing of the 
catHe scattered o'er the lea. . He tried, 
btK io vain, to discover a glimpse of light 
through the shutters, or a tint of smoke 
from the chimnies. At length, determined 
on ascertaining the fact, whether or not the 
house was entirely deserted, he climbed 
over the gate, and made his way through 
the-ishrubbery. As he feared, however, he 

found 



THE DISCARDED SON. 155 

found the rear shut up like the front, and 
was of consequence convinced that it was 
totally uninhabited, as also that it had been 
so for a long time ; the dock spreading its 
broad leaves over the very threshold of the 
doors, and the court, and winding avenues 
through the shrubbery, on the neatness of 
which be knew his father used to pride 
himself, being completely overgrown with 
weeds. That some dreadful event had oc- 
casioned the desertion of this beloved spot, 
he had not the smallest doubt, as for an in- 
stant he could not suppose^ that had the 
family been only gone on a visit, or party 
of pleasure, they would not have ]eh some 
person to take care of it. 

Grief and disappointment for a fev/ 
minutes completely subdued the unhappy 
youth ; he returned to the front of tlie 
house, and leaning his face against the 
barricaded door, which but a few minutes ' 
before he had hoped the liand of his father 
would have opened to him, shed a tor- 
rent of bitter tears. Then repassing the 
u 6 gate^ 



156 THE DISCARDED SON. 

gate, he bent his steps to the nearest cot- 
tagCj for the purpose of enquiring into 
the fate of his family^ which he doubted 
not being known to all the neighbourhood. 

This cottage happened to be Farmer Wat- 
kins% whom Osmond well remembered 
having often, when a bov, amused himself, 
in concert with other lads of his age, at his 
expence, his precise manners, and affecta- 
tion of sanctity, rendering him the butt of 
the village. 

The casements were not yet closed, 
and through them Osmond espied the 
farmer, seated by himself before a blazing 
fire, which sent forth a cheerful light, that 
caused his mansion to form a striking con- 
trast to the lonely and dreary one he had 
just quitted. 

Osmond tapped at the door, and was 
desired to come in. He accordingly 
raised the latch and entered. The former, 
supposing it to be one of his rustic neigh- 
bours, who had called on him, turned in- 
dolently on his chair ; but at sight of a 
5 very 



THE DISCARDED SOX. 157 

Tery elegant young man, instinctlvely 
started from it. Osmond as instinctively 
took off his hat^ and approached him with 
an extended hand ; for though he had 
never liked Watkins, yet in the present 
state of his feelings, his being an old ac- 
quaintance was sufficient to make him expe- 
rience a sensation of joy at beholding him., 

'' I perceive/' cried he, with a forced 
smilC;, seeing Vv'atkins surveying him with 
a vacant stare^ " that you do not recollect 
me." 

'' I profess/* answered Watkins^ " if 
thou knowestf me, thou hast the advantage 
of me, for I remember thee not.""' 

'' What, not the son of your neighbour^,. 
Osmond Miinro?'* 

- "Osmond Munro 1" repeated Watkins ; ' 
^' verily I never should have recognized 
thee, if thou hadst not proclaimed thyself, 
for thou art encreased much in stature since 
I last saw thee ; thou left this a boy, and 
hast returned a man/* 

" Which, considering I have been some

years absent, is not to be wondered at : 
but doubtless, my friend, you can give me 
some information respecting mv family. â€” 
'Tis unnecessary, lam sure, to tell vou how 
ofreatlv I have been shocked and alarmed 

o - 

at finding their house shut up " 

"Then thou hast not lately heard from 
them?" 

'' No, for some time past I have led ra- 
ther an untiettled life/' 

"True, I recollect since thou quittedst 
this, thou hast been a great traveller : 
been to foreign parts, and seen many rare 
sights/' 

" Many but, my friend, I am on- 

the rack to know somethins: of mv fa- 
mily/' 

" Well, I will satisfy thy curiosity/' 

" Curiosity !" repeated Osmond, invo- 
luntarily, and resentfully ; " my anxiety 
you mean/' 

Watkins nodded. â€” " Thy father is â€” "^ 

He paused;, and looked earnestly at 

Osmond. 

^^Dead!'* 



THE DISCARDED SON. 159 

" Dead V said Osmord, in a faltering 
voice, horror-struck by this pause, which 
he imputed to compassion for his feel- 
ings. 

'â– ^ No, thou art mistaken,'' replied Wat- 
kins, shaking liis head, and smiling niali- 
ciou^ily, as Osmond, on afterwards recall- 
ing his look at the moment to mxind, re- 
collected, '' he is not dead, but in the 
house of bondage/' 

'' In prison !" exclaimed Osmond ; 
'^'^ great Heaven, for what?" 

'' For not paying what he justly 
oweth.^' 

" And who â€” w^ho," demanded Osmond, 
in a tone of bitterness, and with a look 
of angwish, '' who is the merciless creditor 
that has done this? â€” for merciless must he 
be who could deprive of his liberty a man 
whose principles, like my father's, must be 
too well known, to permit a doubt to be 
entertained of his paying what he owed, if 
he had the power." 

'â€¢' Thy father," resumed Watkins, " con- 
tracted

traded a large debt, as thou doubtless 
knowest, since part of the borrowed mo- 
nkey was, 1 understand, sent to supply thy 
necessities at the University, whither thou 
%vast so foob'shly sent/' 

'' Your opinion on the subject is un- 
asked,*' interrupted Osmond, haughtily ; 
*' if you have any intelligence to commu- 
nicate respecting my father, and choose to 
impart it, I would thank you to be as 
brief as possible/' 

Watkins again nodded, and with a ghast- 
ly smile of malice thus proceeded â€” '' To 
that worthy nobleman, Lord O'Sinister, 
thy father, as I was about imparting to thee, 
contracted a large debt/' 

Osmond started. â€” '' My fears were then 
prophetic !" he involuntarily exclaimed, 
distractedly striking his forehead ; " but 
go on â€” go on," he added, waving his hand 
to Watkins to proceed. 

" The bond which the worthy Peer 
received from thy father for the money 
he lent him^, he gave as a reward for long 

and

and faithful services to a domestic of his^ 
who being in want of a lirtle ready cash^ 
sold the said bond unto me^ upon which I 
called upon thy father for the payment of 
the same; and he not discharging my just 
demand, I put him into the house of bon- 
dage, where verily he shall stay, until he 
has paid me the uttermost farthing." 

'' No doubt/' cried Osmond, with a 
smile of bitterness, '^ since of course he 
whose vile agent you are, has instructed 
you to persecute him with the utmost 
rancour.*' 

" I know not what thou meanest," re- 
turned Watkins, angrily, 

" I mean," replied Osmond, *' that a 
villain has planned the destruction of an 
innocent man, and engaged you to assist 
him in the business." 

'' Ah, I perceive," cried Watkins, spite- 
fully, "thou retainest something of the old 
leaven, for thou wcrt always a saucy and 
presumptuous boy ; but verily no wonder, 
for thy father was ever too sparing of the 

rod

rod to thee. But if thou waxeth wroth^ 
thou must quit my habitation, where the 
voice of clamour is a stranger. I invited 
thee not to enter it, therefore I do no 
wrong in bidding thee quit it." 

" Fear not/' said Osmond, surveying 
him with forced composure, '^ that I shall 
make my visit too long ; I know myself 
too well, not to be afraid of continuing 
much longer in your company." 

*' What, thou threatenest then/* return- 
ed Watkins, changing colour; '' if thou 
dost not take thyself off directly, thou wilt 
compel me to cry aloud." 

" Thy crying aloud would avail thee 
but little, if I had decided on obeying the 
present impulse ; but I should view myself 
with scorn, if I stooped to chastise such a 
miscreant as thou art ; 'tis he who hast set 
thee on to this, and not thou, his poor 
abject tool, that I shall single out for ven- 
geance." 

He then rushed from the cottage. The 
day was by this time almost closed in ; but 

neither 



THE DISCARDED SOjN. 163 

neither the deepening shades of approach- 
iiig night, the loud howling of the wind, 
which had encreased to a storm, nor yet 
the rain that accompanied it, were re- 
garded by the unhappy Osmond ; the 
dreadful situation of his family occupied 
every thought, engrossed every sense. â€” -He 
became almost distracted as he reflected on 
this^ unable as he was to devise any mode 
by which it might be alleviated ; for of 
the real profits accruing from the situation 
he had held under the Duke D'Amalfi, but 
a few guineas, in consequence of the great 
expencess incurred by travelling, now re- 
inaincd, and he knew not a being to whom 
he could look for sympathy, much less as- 
sistance on tlie present occasion. In the 
midst of the agonizing refieclions to which 
it gave rise, he suddenly recollected his 
not having enquired the prison of his fa- 
ther. To return, however, to the inso- 
lent and malicious Watkins, was not to be 
thought of. From the middle of the heath, 

therefore^ 



164 THE DISCARDED SOM. 

therefore, into which he had unconscious- 
ly wandered, he was casting his eves around 
in quest of another cottage, at which he 
might make the enquiry, when they acci- 
dentally fell upon a man in the garb of a 
labourer, a few paces from him, and who 
for some time had, though unperceived, 
been attentively regarrling him. Ere 
Osmond had time to decide whether he 
would address him or not, the ir.an drew 
near, and with a low but rustic bow, 
said â€” 

" No offence, I hope. Sir, but you 
seem, begging your pardon for saying 
so, to be in a kind of quandary, so if I 
can be of any service to you, command 
me." 

"â–  Thank you, my friend,*' replied Os- 
mond ; '' if you are an inhabitant of this 
place, you can perhaps inform me where 
Mr. Munro is to be found ?'* 

" Captain Munro! bless his heart, "that I 
can ; but,'* as if suddenly recollecting 

himself. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 165 

himself, " you must first, if you please, be 
kind enough to tell me your business with 

''I am his son/' returned Osmond. 

'' What, master Osmond !'' almost shout- 
ed the other ; '' dang it, who could have 
thought of this }" 

" Methinks/' hastily exclaimed Osmond, 
'' your voice is familiar to me." 

'' Ah, vou have heard it often enouo-h 
to remem.ber it ; many a trick has Tom 
Stubbs helped you to play/* 

'' My honest friend/' cried Osmond, 
extending his hand, and with something of 
a joyous sensation^ for he had not only 
seen, but heard sufficient from his father, 
of the honest rustic, to make him think 
highly of him, '' I ask your pardon for 
not sooner recollecting you, but the shock 
I have received since my return hither, 
must be my excuse for not having done so. 
I expected to have been received by my 

family, instead of which '* 

" I know. 



166 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' I know, I know/' interrupted Stubbs^. 
almost sobbing. 

*^ You said/* rejoined Osmond, " you 
could inform me where to find my fa- 
ther." 

"Yes, I can give you all the particu- 
lars you want to hear about him ; but this 
is no place to tell the story in ; the wind 
blows cold, and the rain is coming on 
faster and faster ; and besides â€” besides," 
added the honest farmer, tenderly laying 
his hand upon the arm of Osmond, *' you 
are wet already/* 

" No matter/' returned Osmond, " I wish 
not to lose a moment in seeing my fa- 
ther.** 

" *Tis quite too late to see him to- 
night," said Stubbs, " and too dark, and too 
dismal, I am sure, to go to any distance ; 
so you must come hoame with me, to my 
cottage ; I cannot, 'tis true, give you a 
fine bed, but I'll give you a clean one, 
and what is more, a hearty welcome ; 

yes. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 167 

yes, by goles, if I had jewels and gold to 
set before you, you'd be as welcome to 
them as to my bacon and eggs: so come 
along, come along, Mr. Osmond, and I 
pray you do not let your spirits sink; for 
according to the old saying, ' when things 
are at the w^orst, they'll mend/ â€” Your fa- 
ther is an honest and good man, and God 
has ever such in hisspecial keeping/' 

The indignation with which the insolence 
of Watkins inspired him, had dried up the 
tears that burst from Osmond, at behold- 
ing the desertion of his native home ; but 
at the kindness of Farmer SUibbs his dry 
and burning eye again became deluged; 
and forgetting that the darkness of the hour 
would conceal his emotion, he hastily pass- 
ed his hand over his face. 

Since he could not obtain an interview 
with his father that night, he readily ac- 
cepted an invitation, that promised to 
afford him the melancholy pleasure of con- 
versing about him. 

Farmer Stubbs found his good dame 

busy 



168 THE DISCARDED SON. 

busy in preparing supper against his re- 
turn. He quickly announced his guest to 
her, and as quickly made him exchange his 
wet coat for a dry one. He then put him in 
possession of the warm seat, which he was 
wont to occupy himself in the chimney cor- 
ner, threw some additional logs upon the fire, 
and called to his dame to produce a bottle 
of her elder wine, for the excellence of 
which she was famed throughout the neigh- 
bourhood. Not finding this call, however, 
obeyed with the promptness he expected, 
he arose from the table, surprised as well 
as angry, for his dame, he had always 
considered as good-natured and hospitable 
as himself, and, beckoning her into ano- 
ther room, enquired the reason of her not 
having done what he desired? 

'' Why, Thomas," replied she, '' you 
know there was but little of the wine re- 



'' Dang it," exclaimed the farmer, re- 
treating a few paces from her, and sur- 
veying her with a look of mingled scorn 

and 



THE DISCARDED SON. 169 

and ridicule, " art thou growing a miser 
in thy old days?'* 

" Noa^ Thomas, noa ; God forbid ; but 
yesterday, when I went to poor Madam 
Munro, with the two w^oodcockg you shot, 
she looked so sadly, that I took it into my 
head she had not comfortable things to 
take; so this morning meeting Jem Macal- 

listcr going to D , I brought him 

home with me, and sent her all the wine I 
had left, with my duty.'' 

'^^ Did you?" said the farmer, in an al- 
tered accent, and again approaching his 
dame; "then thou art a good girl still; 
and dang me but thou shalt get a new hat 
at Easter, to prove that I think thee so. 
But," thoughtfully, " 'tis an awkward thing, 
to be sure, to mention a thing, and then not 
produce it, 'specially when one can't tell 
the reason why; for I wouldn't, for the 
price of a new horse, have the poor youth 
know that his parents were beholden for 
any thing to such poor folks as we. Non, 
noa, he's grieved, and sick enough at heart 
already, without knowing that. Ah, dame, 

VOL. y, I hadst 



170 THE DISCARDED SON. 

hadst thou seen him^, as I did, in the middle 
of the bleak heath â€” I verily thought he was 
some poor crazed being, going to make 
away with himself." Then, after a short 
pause â€” '' Well, it can't be helped ; since 
we can't have wine, v/hy we must be con- 
tent with ale; so let's have a humming 
jug in no time, and plenty of sugar and 
ginger; and, d'ye hear, be sure you cut 
some rashers off of the best flitch, and rout 
about to get plenty of eggs." 

Dame Stubbs nodded significantly, and 
the farmer hastened back to his dejected 
guest, at whose importunate request he 
speedily commenced the relation he had 
promised him, but which, in his language, 
being more prolix than was necessary, we 
shall Sfive in our own. 

The gallant husband of the unfortunate 
lady, against whom Lord O'Sinister so un- 
happily succeeded in his machinations, as 
mentioned in the beginning of this storv, 
returned from the Continent, but to find 
the wife whom he had left blooming in 
health and beauty, and happy as conscious 

inno- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 171 

innocence, the smiles of fortune, and the 
esteem and affection of friends^ could ren- 
der her, in the last stage of a consumption, 
brought on by remorse. His grief and so- 
licitude about her wrung from her a confes- 
sion of her unworthiness ; and at the grave, 
in which a few days after Jie saw her laid, he 
solemnly swore never to rest till he had re- 
venged her wrongs and his own. This vow, 
by means not necessary to relate. Lord O'Si- 
nister was quickly informed of, in conse- 
quence of which he immediately resolved on 
shifting his quarters, and remaining abroad, 
till assured he might return with safety â€” his 
attachment to this world being too great 
not to render him anxious to keep out of 
the way of any circumstance likely to send 
him out of it. 

His par.sion for Elizabeth continued still 
unabated; but doubly armed as he now 
knew her to be by love and virtue against 
him, he by this time v;as convinced there 
WSL.S not a chance of ever succeeding by 
the common arts of seduction with her; 
and accordingly, in pursuance of this con- 
1 2 victioj^ 



172 THE DISCARDED SON. 

\iction, conceived the project of trying 
what effect working her uu to despair 
about her family would have on her. In 
consequence, therefore, of this project, 
he had the bond which he had received 
from Munro delivered by the hands of a 
confidential agent, just as he was on the 
point of embarking for the Continent, 
into those of Watkins, whose principles 
and hatred to Munro he was fully apprised 
of by Jenkins, with instructions for him 
how to act, and what tale to tell concern- 
ing it. 

After Munro had been a few weeks im- 
prisoned, the agent above-mentioned was 
to deliver to Elizabeth a letter from his 
Lordship, stating his having heard by 
chance, at his seat in Derbyshire, for it 
was his intention, (for fear of a pursuit, to 
conceal where he really was, ) of the con- 
finement of her father, and also that he 
would instantly have released him from 
it, but for having many powerful reasons 
for believing he had been most ungrateful 
for former kindness; notwithstanding which, 

however, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 173 

however^ he was willing to restore him not 
only to liberty^ but to place him in af- 
fluence for the remainder of his life, pro- 
vided she would accede to his wishes, by 
giving up a young man, whose friends^ 
e^'en supposing he continued constant, 
which was a very doubtful matter, would 
never consent to their union, and permit- 
ting the person who delivered this letter to 
her to convey her to the arms of his 
Lordship. 

Did we choose to launch into similies, 
we might say, that a Jew never more re- 
joiced at an opportunity of making a 
good bargain, or a miser of adding to 
his hoard, than did Watkins at obtain- 
ing one of gratifying the hatred he bore 
Munro, for repelling the efforts pride 
actuated him to make, to be on fami- 
liar terms with him. The day after he 
became possessed of this long-wished for 
opportunity, he repaired to his house, 
and on enquiring for him, was ushered 
into the parlour, where he found him 
I 3 seated. 



174- THE DISCARDED SON. 

seated^ evidently indisposed in mind and 
body^ his wound still continuing very 
painful^ and his spirits being dreadfully 
depressed by the unsettled state into 
which the long confinement and expences 
it occasioned had thrown his affairs, and 
the disappointment of his expectations re- 
lative to Lord O'Sinister, of whose having 
offered him a situation adequate to the 
one it had compelled him to resign, he 
had entertained no doubt. With that dis- 
ta]U civility which his forward manners 
obliged him to use, he enquired, on 
Watkins's entering the parlour, into the 
cause which had procured him the favour 
of a visit from him ? 

Watkins, who was dexterous in the art 
of tormenting, did not gratify his curiosity, 
until he had completely exhausted his pa- 
tience, and agitated his mind. When, 
at length, he explained it, astonishment 
for a few minutes deprived Munro of ut- 
terance. 

''Good God!" he exclaimed, on reco- 
vering 



THE DISCARDED SON. 175 

verirtg a little from the shock he had re- 
ceived, '' there must certainly be some 
mistake in all this ; the bond which I gave 
to Lord O'Sinister, and you say his servant 
has sold to you, was not payable in less 
than five years^ and then only by instal- 
ments." 

'' Well, though , thou ' doubtest my 
word/' cried Watkins, '' thou wilt not, 
perhaps^ doubt the evidence of thine own 
eyes ;'" and as he spoke, he drew forth the 
bond from his bosom, and unfolded it to 
the view of Munro, who hastily glancing 
over it, perceived with amazement, and it 
might almost be said with horror, for little 
short of that did he feel at the idea of 
being in the power of such a man as he 
considered Watkins, that it was payable on 
demand. The livid paleness of his cheek, 
the dropping of his eyelids on his ascer- 
taining this, more forcibly proclaimed, 
than any language could have done, what 
he felt at the m.oment. After a silence of 
a few minutes, during which he appeared 
1 4 buried 



176 THE DISCARDED SON. 

buried in thought^ he lifted his heavy eyes 
to WatkinSj who, all the time^ had, with 
the most exulting malice, been regarding 
him, and begged he would let the bu- 
siness rest as it was at present, until he 
had written to Lord 0*Sinister on the sub- 
ject, and enquired into what appeared to 
him at present both a mysterious and trea- 
cherous transaction. 

'' At all events," added he, '' to have 
recourse to hostile measures against me 
would be of no service whatever to you, 
as it is totally out of my power at present 
to liquidate any part of the debt. At the 
very moment you entered, I was on the 
point of writing to his Lordship, to apo- 
logize for being unable to do so at present, 
:1s about this time I conceived he might ex- 
pect payment.'' 

The crafty Watkins, apprehensive of 
his real intentions respecting him being 
disappointed, if he gave him any reason 
to suspect them, immediately replied â€” 

'' Do not trouble thyself unnecessarily ; 

what- 



. THE DISCARDED SON. 177 

whatever thou mayst think to the contrary, 
I am not destitute of charity and loving- 
kindness; write at thy leisure to the great 
man^ and when thou hast received his an- 
swer^ let me know^ and I will call upon 
thee, to have this affair settled to our mu- 
tual satisfaction/' 

He then departed, leaving Munro not 
only surprised at his conduct, but penetrat- 
ed with remorse by it, since it led him to 
believe that he had wronged him, in the 
opinion he had so long harboured of him. 

That a man of Munro's understandinc: 
should so easily be imposed on, may ap> 
pear unnatural to some ; but let it be un- 
derstood by those who think so, that his 
knowledge of the artifices of life, without 
which the wariness of distrust seldom be- 
comes the inmate of the virtuous mind, 
bore no proportion to his knowledge of its 
sorrows : he would have been happy to 
have concealed from his wife and daughter 
the cause of Watkins's visit, but at the 
time of receiving it they were unfortu- 
1 5 nately 



.178 THE DISCAEDED SON. 

nately in an ndjoining room, and so over- 
heard the \vhole of the conversation be- 
tween them : but great as was the disqui- 
etude this gave to Mrs. Munro, it was 
trifling compared with that Elizabeth felt, 
owing to her knowledge of the real cha- 
racter of his Lordship, and consequent de- 
velopment of the motives which had ac- 
tuated him to act in such a manner with 
regard to the bond. That he had resolved 
on her destruction, or that of her family, 
she clearly saw; but ihe terrible appre- 
hensions which this conviction inspired, 
she sedulously concealed, persuaded that 
theirdivulgement ji:.ight do mj.ich mischief, 
but no good, since she well knew her fa- 
ther had not the means of avoiding- any 
evil with which he might be threatened, 
and that he could not hear of Lord O'Sinis- 
ter's vile designs respecting her, Vv'ithout 
being irritated to seme measure, that would 
not fail of aggravating the malice of his- 
Lordship. 

To Providence she looked up for frus- 
3 trating 



THE DISCARDED SON. 179 

trating the intentions of this their unpro- 
voked and persecuting foe. She prayed 
too, more fervently than ever^ for the 
speedy return of Delacour^ whom she consi- 
dered as a kind of bulwark against his Lord- 
ship. She tried also to prevent herself 
from sinking into despair, by hoping that^, 
even if things came to the worst â€” even if 
her father were imprisoned, still his con- 
finement would only last till Delacour 
came back. 

Munro only delayed, after the depar- 
ture of Watkins, writing to Lord O'Sinister, 
till he had a little collected himself He 
entered into a warm expostulation with his 
Lordship, on the deception which had been 
practised on him, besought him by return 
of post, for he supposed him at his house 
in London, to let him knov/to what it was 
to be imputed ; and ended by declaring, 
that should his Lordship decline interfering 
with Watkins on the subject, he should con- 
ceive himself cruelly treated.

in the power of any one to molest hiiiij he 
could only account for by concluding some 
one had injured him in his opinion; but 
then, if this were the case, what an igno- 
ble mind did such a step augur his Lord- 
ship possessed of ! 

Munro was not in a state of health to 
bear either an encrease of anxiety, or vioÂ« 
lent agitation, without injury. Nothing 
but a dread of alarming his wife and 
daughter prevented his keeping his bed the 
day after Watkins's visit, he felt himself so 
extremely indisposed. Towards evening 
he grew so much worse, that he could no 
longer conceal his situation from them; and 
soon after tea, was on the point of with- 
drawing to his chamber, when aloud knock 
at the hall door caused him to pause: on its 
being opened, a rough voice was heard en- 
quiring for him. Munro fancying there was 
somehesitation in the servant's answer, nod- 
ded to Elizabeth to open the parlour door; 
she obeyed, but started back in affright, 
at beholding three ruffianly-looking men 

close 



THE DISCARDED SON. IBl 

close lo ity who instantly rushed in^ and 
with a ferocious glance round the apart- 
ment, approached her father. Munro's 
heart almost misgave him at their sight; 
stillj however, with tolerable composure^^ 
he enquired their business with him ? â€” 

'^ Why not the most agreeable business 
in the world, to be sure. Captain,'' cried 
the foremost of them ; " but such things,'' 
and he smiled as he probably thought face- 
tiously, " will sometimes happen in the 
best regulated families. We have a writ 
against you, at the suit of one Jeremiah 
Watkins, of this neighbourhood/' 

At this confirmation of his fears MunrO' 
involuntarily raised his hands and eyes 
towards heaven, in astonishment at the trea- 
chery and cruelty of the wretch; while Mrs. 
Munro, with a deep sigh, dropped back, 
fainting, on the chair, from which she. 
had started in terror, at the entrance of 
the ruffians. 

Munro with difficulty now raised his^ 

enfeebled 



1S2 THE DISCARDED SON. 

enfeebled frame from his chair, and made 
an effort to approach his wile., but was 
prevented by one of the men. 

"â– ' Come, come. Captain/' exclaimed he, 
interposing between them, "^ I ask pardon, 
but your Lady is in good hands, and no 
time must to be lost, for it is a long 
walk to D r 

Elizabeth turned wildly at these w^ords 
from her mother, and almost shrieking, 

repeatedâ€” '' To D ! Oh good God '/' 

she exclaimed, wringing her hands, ''^surely 

you will not think of taking him to D- 

at such an hour, and in such a night as 
this, (for it ^.^as both stormy and wet;) 
he is ill, and it will be his death, perhaps, 
if you do. Oh, I conjure you,'' dropping 
almost unconsciously on her knees, *' if he- 
be indeed your prisoner, let him remain 
here at least this night/' 

*' Sorry I can't oblige you. Miss," re- 
plied one of the men, ''but the thino^ is 
utterly impossible; we must do our duty, 

let 



THE DISCARDED SON. 183

may/' 

Elizabeth, but without changing her 
attitude^ turned her imploring eyes from 
him to her father. . Munro made an effort 
to speak, but an unsuccessful one ; agony 
of mind had completely overcome him ; 
and as he involuntarily leant upon one of 
the men, he motioned with his languid 
hand to another to bring him a glass of 
water from the sideboard. The man 
obeyed, and after he had swallowed it, he 
recovered sufficiently to be enabled to bid. 
his daughter rise. 

"We must part, my dearest girl," he cried, 
pressing her to his bosom, on which she- 
had sunk, " but it will only be for a few 
hours. In the morning you and your mo- 
ther, you know, can both come to me to

who in vain endeavoured to make the pro-

inanimate form of his wife, " what hast 
thou not made me and mine suffer ! but 
for thee, this hour of bitterness would never 
have been experienced." 

The

The men becoming impatient for him 
to depart, and being also anxious to do 
so himself, ere his wife reoained her senses, 
lest the distress he had no doubt she 
wijould betray on recovering should de- 
stroy the composure he wished to main- 
tain, he no longer hesitated to attend them. 
With trembling hands Elizabeth assisted 
him on with his great-coat, and with an 
almost bursting heart, followed him to the 
gate, where he again strained her to his 
bosom, again besought her to exert her- 
self, and tried to administer some little 
comfort to her, by reminding ner they 
should meet on the morrow. 

The anguish which Elizabeth, for fear 
of aggravating his, had struggled against 
in his presence, burst forth the moment 
he w^as out of sight. The event that had 
just befallen him, now that it had really 
taken place, she con-::dercd as a much 
more disastrous one than when she had 
merely apprehended it. The hopes she 
had clung to, in order to prevent herself 

from 



THE DISCARDED SON: 187 

from sinking beneath the anticipation of this 
misfortune, had now entirely forsaken her. 
Delacour might, she reflected, never re- 
turn ; or, if he did, it might be without 
t]>e power (for an instant she would not 
suppose â€” no, she knew his noble nature 
too well, to permit her to think that it 
might be without inclination) to succour 
her father ; if so, his sun was for ever set, 
she feared â€” she dreaded he had for ever 
quitted his home. 

The night was stormy â€” rain fell too in 
large drops; but the agonizing idea of 
her father's sufferings rendered Elizabeth 
at the moment regardless of all besides.- â€” 
She continued leaning against the gate 
at which he had parted from her, till 
roused by the voice of her mother, who, 
on recovering and missing her husband, 
had wildly started from her seat, and, with 
an intention of following him to prison, 
rushed from the house. 

Elizabeth interposing between her and 
the gate, conjured her to give up this in- 
tention

tention for the present, as one that could 
not fail of drawing disappointment and ad- 
ditional sorrow on her, since there was not 
the least likelihood of her being able to 
overtake her father, or gain admission to 
him that night. Mrs. Munro, however^ 
persisted in it, till Elizabeth, in an agony 
of distress, dropped kneeling at her feet, 
nor even then relinquished it, till her ma* 
ternal fears were awakened by thedeath-like 
paleness of her daughter, and the wildness 
of her looks. 

*' Till to-morrow, then," cried she, as 
she eagerly raised her from the ground, 
and returned with her into the house, '' I 
will endeavour to controul my impatience 
to rejoin your father; but then we meet 
to part no more ; yes," continued she, 
clasping her hands together, and looking 
up to Heaven, with all the enthusiasm of 
tenderness, ''still shall my arm pillow his 
head, still will I exert myself to mitigate 
his anguish, still pour the balm of love 
into his soul, and lull him to his rest,

praising my God for permitting me to do 
so/' 

On this night, the most wretched, tljongh 
many were the sorrowful ones they had 
passed, Mrs. Munro or Elizabeth ever 
knew, we shall not dwell ; suffice it to sav. 
it was passed without either thinking of 
re.t, and that at the first glimpse of day 
they prepared for their visit to D . 

As -hev were on the point of settinf>- 
off, Stubbs made his appearance. â€” He 
had heard the preceding night of the 
arrest of poor Munro, but at too late 
an hour to think of enquiring after the 
ladies. He now came for that purpose ; 
and also to ask whether he could be of any 
service to them or the Captain, on whom 
he mentioned his intention of calling im- 
mediately, though not without- shame as 
well as sorrow, he protested, at the- idea 
of his having been the means of intro- 
ducing him to a person capable of serving 
him as Lord O'Sinister had done. â€” '' But to 
a certainty/' added he, '' his Lordship must 

be 



190 THE DISCARDED SON. 

he in a state of madness at present, or he 
never could have been guilty of such con- 
duct." 

'' Oh that madness had been the cause 
of it, for then a hope might be entertain- 
ed of receiving reparation for it/' Eliza- 
beth with difficulty prevented herself from 
saying. 

She gratefully accepted Stubbs*s offer of 

attending her and her mother to D -, 

and carrying some things which she had 
packed up for her father. 

No carriage vyas to be procured in the 
neighbourhood^ and exhausted as she was 
with grief and agitation, Mrs. Munro, with 
difficulty, although supported by the arm 
of her daughter, reached the prison of 
her husband. 

The gloomy and miserable apartment in 
which she found him, the only furniture 
of which consisted of a wooden bedstead, 
on which the gaoler's wife had contented 
herself with spreading a rug for his accom- 
modation, it not being the custom, she in- 
formed 



THE DISCARDED SON. 19] 

formed him, to provide beds for the pri- 
soners, and the idea of the dreadful hours 
he must have passed by himself in such a 
place, did not tend to revive her dejected 
spirits. 

^^True/' cried Munro, as with one arm 
he clasped his weeping wife, and with the 
other his equally shocked daughter to his 
bosom, '' my pillow last night was a hard 
one; but wdth all its hardness, many downy 
ones have been rendered mxore intolerable, 
by the thorns a guilty conscience has 
strewn over them. Besides, how many 
nobler heads than mine have rested on a 
worse one; how many, grown grey in the- 
service of their country, been v/iihout a 
place on which to repose. ^Tis sometimes 
requisite for us to look into the situation 
of others, to check murmurs at our own/' 

Munro had passed ihc night in reflecting 
and arranging plans for the future â€” the 
dreary future he feared. * 

Persuaded^ by a minute retrospect of 

the 



192 THE DISCARDED SON. 

the conduct of Lord O'Sinister, that there 
was but little hope of his interfering with 
Watkins concerning him, and still less, from 
hisknowledgeofWatkins's disposition, of his 
being brought into any terms, he had made 
up his mind to continuing in prison ; and 
in consequence thereof had decided on im- 
mediately endeavourin::^ to procure some 
person to undertake the m.anagement of 
his farm^ and also on parting with his 
house, provided his wife insisted on taking 
up her abode with him^ which he rather 
imagined she would. 

A few minutes conversation with her 
sufiicing to convince him such w^as her de- 
termination, he sent for Stubbs^ of whose 
having attended them to the prison, and 
waiting below to knov/ whether he had any 
commands for him, Elizabeth had inform- 
ed him, his well-know^n honesty, and the at- 
tachn^ent he had always evinced for him, 
rendering him anxious to have him under- 
take the management of his affairs, and 

brieflv 



THE DISCARDED SON. 193 

brieflv explained his present v^ishes and 
intentions, and had the satisfaction offjnd- 
ing hirn willing to undertake what he de- 
sired. 

This matter' being arranged, Elizabeth 
was deputed to return to Heath wood^ for 
the purpose of' packing up such things as 
were requisite for their accommodation in 
their new abode, and discharging their 
little household, Munro conceiving their 
economy at present could not be of too 
rigid a nature. 

Elizabeth feeling that exertion was ab- 
solutely requisite, to pre^ ent her sinking 
into litter despondence, could not be pre- 
vailed on to let a carriage be procured to 
take her back. 

The day was gloomy, but just as she 
came within sight of Heathv^ood, the sun 
breaking through the clouds, that had till 
then obscured his brightness, and striking 
full upon the windows and heights in the 
rear, shed a dazzling cheerfulness o'er the 

VOL. V. K scene. 



154 THE DISCARDED SON. 

scene, that, from the contrast it presented to 
the one she had just quitted, heightened all 
the gloomy horrors of the latter in her imagi- 
nation ; but neither this cheerfulness â€” the 
wild and thrilling melody of the birds that 
thronged the adjacent brakes â€” the soft low- 
ing of the cattle that fed in the vicinity, 
and was still echoed by the neighbouring 
hills â€” nor yet the grateful fragrance of 
the shrubs that clustered round the house/ 
half hiding its glittering windows, could 
now, as heretofore, impart a charm to 
sooth or animate the spirits of Elizabeth. 
On the contrary, she became still more 
dejected, since in proportion to the de- 
lightfulness of what had so long been the 
residence of her father, was her regret at 
his being perhaps forever torn from it. 

Stubbs left her at the gate, for the pur- 
pose of preparing the cart, in which he had 

olfered to convey the packages to D , 

and sending his wife to assist her in pack- 
ing. 

The 



THE DISCARDED SON. 195 

The tears which Elizabeth had hitherto 
with difficulty suppressed, gushed from her 
on entering the house, where a melancholy- 
stillness, disordered apartments, half open- 
ed shutters, and grates destitute of fire, 
proclaimed its sad abandonment. In the 
luxury of grief, however, she did not per- 
mit herself to indulge; she entered with- 
out loss of time upon i\\e task delegated 
to her, the most distressing part of which, 
owing to the pain she had reason to be- 
lieve it would give them, was her being 
obliged to inform the two domestics their 
services were no longer wanting. 

Having put up the light articles herself, 
and selected such of the heavy ones as 
were required, she left the packing of these 
to the servants and Dame Stubbs, (who, 
in pursuance of her husband's desire, had 
hastened to her,) and repaired to the 
garden, in order to indulge without re- 
straint the feelings that swelled her heart 
almost to bursting. 

K 2 The 



196 THE DISCAKDED SON. 

The recollections which this delightful 
spot revived in her mind, were not by any 
means calculated to alleviate the bitterness 
of these. Not a walk, not a shade, not a 
shrub, almost, which did not recall the me- 
mory of some happy or interesting hour. 
In its bowers, which the winds of autumn 
were now daily stripping of their gorgeous 
foliage, still had the summer evenings 
worn away in pleasing converse, or in- 
nocent amusements. In its winding walks, 
its sheltering grove, the approach of spring, 
its protruding buds, and the gradual reno- 
vation of a faded world, had" been hailed 
by her with enthusiastic delight. Here, 
too, had she wandered with Delacour â€” 
with him from whom she now feared 
she was for ever separated ; for except 
the situation of her parents changed for 
the better, she solemnly resolved never 
to enter into any engagem.ent that could 
render, her liable to be removed from 
them â€” Here, too, had his delighted eye 

ranged 



THE DISCARDED SON. 197 

ranged %vith her's o'er nature's beauties ; 
and here â€” oh here, had he held her to 
his heart, and \owed perpetual constancy. 

" And must this beloved spot/' she ex- 
claimed, with a burst of anguish at the 
idea, " so endeared, so hallowed by ten- 
der recollections, must it pass into the 
hands of strangers ? â€” ^Oh, cruel and per- 
fidious man," she added, her thoughts sud- 
denly recurring to LordO'Sinister, "what a 
dreadful use do you m^ke of the bounty of 
Heaven I" 

An approaching step caused her to 
turn, and with mingled surprise and indig- 
nation, she beheld Watkins. He had seen 

her returning to the house from D , 

and being anxious to have a little conver- 
sation in private with her, followed her 
steps, and finding the hall door open, 
stole in un perceived after her. 

Elizabeth started at so unexpectedly be- 
holding him, and obeying the impulse of 
indignation, directly hurried from him. â€” 
He followed. 

K 3 *^ Why 



1D8 THE DISCARDED SON." 

*' Why dost thou fly me?'' he cried â€” 
*' I am net a v/olf in sheep's clothing, that 
thou needst fear me. I pray thee let me 
comnrjune with thee a little." 

In vaJH;, however, would he have im- 
,plored her to do this, but that it sud- 
denly occurred to her that he might have 
come for the purpose of maKinsr some 
pleasing proposition relative to her father; 
and accordingly stopping and tiirning to- 
wards him, she d>>ired to know his , busi- 
ness with her. 

'*' Verily,'' replied he, in a tone such as 
she had never before heard him speak in, 
and with a strange expression of counte- 
nance^ '' it is to tell thee that thou art 
young and fair to look upon^ and '' 

Hastily interrupting him^ Elizabeth, with 
flashing eyes and kindling cheek, bade 
hira begone, if his intention was to cfTend 
her. 

*' Nav, in truth it is not," cried he, in 
deprecating accents: *^ only hear me out, 

and 



THE DISCARDED SON. 199 

and thou wilt find I have no such inten- 
tion." 

" Be brief then/' returned Elizabeth, 
somewhat haughtily. 

He nodded, and thus went onâ€”'' Thou 
art young and fair, as I have already said, 
but unhappily my wife is neither. On the 
contrary, she is w^ell stricken in years, and, 
moreover, is troubled with the cholic, and 
the phthisic, and the rheumatics ; and the 
quack doctor who was in these parts last 
year, and to whom I gave a golden guinea 
for his opinion of her case, said she could 
not possibly last much longer ; now, there- 
fore, if thou w^ilt promise me that I shall 
find favour in thy sight, and that when she 
goeth the way of all fiesh, thou and I shalt 
be one, I will without delay take thy father 
out of the house of bondage, and wait his 
own time for the payment of what he owes 
me/' 

For a few minutes, surprise and indig- 
nation took from Elizabeth the power of 
K 4 utter- 



500 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Utterance : on regaining it, she com- 
manded him, in accents indicative of the 
feelings he had excited^ to leave her â€” 
*' I cannot find words/' she exclaimed^ 
" adequate to express my abhorrence of 
your ins(3]ence and treachery â€” Begone, 
therefore, I say, directly, or I shall v*'ith- 
out further hesitation i^ave you turned 
hence/' 

'/ Ah/' wirh a maiirioiis grin, and his 
cadaverous coiintenarce flushed with rags 
and spite, " I should be glad to know who 
thou wouldst apply to for that purpose : 
since thy father, by his folly, hast put it 
out of his own power to befriend thee, thou 
wilt not find many, I fancy, who will turn 
champions for thf^e; so thou hadst better 
in time humble tliy pride to thy fortunes, 
and not threaten where thou canst not 
harm. â€” 'tis my pleasure to stay longer here, 
in vain, therefore, wilt thou bid me be- 
gone ; and as to thy saying thou wouldst 
gei some one to turn me hence, I should 

lau2:h 



THE DISCARDED SON. 20 X 

laugh to scorn any one who attempted to 
do so/' 

*' Indeed ! " exclaimed a voice with which 
he was wel! acquainted, and instantly Stubbs 
made his appearance from behind a hedge, 
where he had overheard the whole of the 
above conversation, having, under the idea 
of his being about some mischief, in conse- 
quence of seeino^ him slvlv stealing; towards 
the house, followed him thither â€” '' We 
shall see that, for if you do not march off 
as fast as those spider legs of your's will 
carry vou, I shall make bold to irive vour 
worship a shove/' 

" Nay," cried Watkins, changing colour, 
and shewing]: anvthino; but an inclination 
to laugh, " I know no right thou hast 
either to give me a shove or bid me get 
hence/' 

'' As to that," returned Stubbs, with his 

usual coolness, " I am not the first man, by 

many, who has done what he had no right 

to do ; however, I think 1 have a right to 

K 5 do 



ig02 THE DISCA?.DFD SCN. 

do what r have now threatened; and, to 
a certainty, I will, ifyou provoke me, for 
'tis the duty of every man to serve his fel- 
low-creatures, more especially an unpro- 
tected female. You said, if I understood 
you right, that Miss Munro would not find 
it an easy matter now to get a friend ; but 
that's not the first falsehood you told, and I'll 
be SYv^orn it won't be the last. The daughter 
of such a man as her father is, will never 
want a friend in Heaven or on earth. So 
begone, I say begone, thou oppressor of 
the oppressed, nor ever dare to shew thy 
face again, where, in place of happiness, 
thou hast Introduced sorro^.v â€” Begone, I 
say, and bless thy stars for my having let 
thee off so quietly, for if I did as I wish, 
rd make thee kiss the ground for thy au- 
dacity â€” Thou look up to Miss Munro ! â€” 
thou, to the daughter of a gentleman ! â€” 
By golcp^ I know not whether to wonder 
most at thy wickedness or impudence.'* 
** Kay, beware how thou slanderest me," 

cried 



THE DISCARDED SON. 203 

cried Watkins, but retreating as bespoke 
behind Elizabeth, whom a fear of the good- 
natured Stubbs bringing himself into some 
scrape on her account^ should she leave 
them together^ prevented from immedi- 
ately retreating to the house; ''I know 
of no wickedness thou canst charge me 
with/' 

" God forbid I could accuse myself of 
half so much! But you'll yet meet with 
your punishment for all, I dare say â€” Yes, 
yes, I make no doubt you'll yet be made 
to ^ee\ for alt vou have made others suffer. 
The few ill-gotten pounds vou have scraped 
together mayn't always last â€” riches maketh 
unto themselves wing^s, and fleeth awav ; 
and often when people think themselves 
most secure, they are in most danger â€” 
Job, to wit. You who are so deep read 
in scripture cannot but know how, when 
he thought himself at the height of his 
glory, the four corners of his dwelling 
were smote by the winds of Heaven, and

all that he had perished; and, by the Lord^ 
as I passed by your house this morning, I 
spied a huÂ£:e crack in one of the corners, 
"vvhich, for any thing one can tell to the 
contrary," and he nodded significantly at 
Watkins, '^ rnay be the beginning of trou- 
bles.'^ 

â€¢' Verily," returned Watkins, in the most 
spiteful accents, ^^ I care not if thou spied 
a thousand cracks, for the landlord re- 
paireth all damages, and the mason he era- 
ployeth is a kinsfolk of mine, and he and 
I understand one another." 

'' No doubt," cried Stubbs, with an arch 
sneer, again nodding, ^'^ and so do I un- 
derstand you both â€” Here's a pretty scoun- 
drel," he added, " does mischief in order 
to get money ! So, I suppose, if you in- 
sured at one of the fire-offices, we should 
soon have a bonefire in the village." 

'' Neighbour, once for all, I tell thee," 
quoth V/atkins, with encreasing venom in 
his voice and countenance^ '' if thou per- 

sistest 



THE DISCAKDED SON. 205 

slstest in traducing mc^ thou wilt compel 
nie to lay the cudgel of chastisement across 
thy shoulders, as Balaam did across the 
shoulders- of his ass/' 

'' By the Lord, but I must be a greater 
ass than Balaam's beast ^as though, if I let 
you/' said Stubbs; and glanv^^ing his eye 
around, somewhat inflamed with indigna- 
tion, he perceived a gardener's spade upon 
the ground, which snatching up â€” *' Be- 
gone, I say again, begone," cried he. 

'^ No, 'tis my pleasure," returned Wat- 
kins, determined, if possible, from his un- 
willingness to be overcom.e in the pre- 
sence of Elizabeth, to maintain his ground, 
'' to tarry longer here." 

'' Then 'tis my pleasure that you should 
not," cried Stubbs ; and darting towards 
him, he presented the spade, as if it was 
really his intention to shovel him from the 
place. 

Watkins no longer attempted to remon- 
strate or resist ; he danced round Elizabeth 
with the greatest agility, and then betook

206 THE DISCARDr.D SON. 

himself to flight, Stubbs, irritated and 
anxious to expose hirn to derision/ pur- 
sued. In his haste to avoid him^ Watkins 
plTimped headlong into a horse-pond, mid- 
way between his cv/n lioiise and the one 
he had just quitted ; with the greatest diffi- 
culty, and all covered with slime, he <iot 
out of it, and continued his career, still 
followed by vStubbs. ' 

The astonishment of Mrs. Watkins, at 
seeing her husband dripping like a water- 
god, and out of breath \uth terror, and 
running dart into the house pursued by 
Stubbs, also panting from the latter cause, 
was too great for description. 

'' Procure assistance,'' cried Watkins^ 
retreating to an inner room, '' for that 
wicked man," pointing to Stubbs, "chaceth 
me with evil intentions." 

Mrs. Watkins, like an obedient wifc^ 
was hastening to the door, for the purpose 
of doing what she was desired, when seiz- 
ing her by the wrist, Stubbs entreated her 
to listen quietly to him for a minute. 

" 'Tis 



THE DISCAnDTD SON. 207 

'' 'Tis now^ Mrs. Watkins/' said he^ 
'''three or four and twenty years at leasts 
since you and I nrst became acquainted, 
and during this time I don't think you ever 
heard any thing bad of me/' 

'' Why DO, truly, I can't say I ever heard 
any evil of thee." 

'" Why then, I think you may give cre- 
dit to what I shall tell you." 

" Thou canst not deny, surely, that thou 
hast thrown my spouse into great tribu- 
lation." 

'' No, but yon can't be anr^rv Vv-ith me 
for having done so, since it v/as by taking 
your part â€” yes, sly as he looks there, I 
surprised him making love, boasting o-f 
your having got the cholic, and the phthi- 
sic, and the devil knov^s ^vhat, and so that of 
course it might soon be expected you would 
lie under the soH ; and thereupon I got so 
angry with him, for speaking in such a 
manner of such a good prudent wife as 
you have always been to him, and wishing

you dead, that, by the Lord, for theli^e of 
liie, I couldn't act otherwise than I did." 

*^' Oh the wicked one!" exclaimed Mrs. 
Watkins^ who being a little inclined to 
jealousy, from a consciousness of not being 
an over- agreeable helpmate, readily be- 
lieved what Stubbs related to her â€” '' who 
could have thought of such a thing !" 

*' Aye, who to be sure : but then re- 
member, Dame, smooth water runs deep.'* 

'' And who is the cockatrice who has 
inticed him from my bosom ?'* 

'' O, no matter; 'tis a person that merits 
no hard names, and despises him too much 
to bestow a thought o!) him ; so ask no 
more questions about her, but think of 
some way of punishing him â€” You have 
fifty pounds a-year^ you know, at your 
own disposal." 

Mrs. Watkins nodded. 

'^ Then will it away from him, and take 
my word he won't be in so great a hurry 
for your death as he now is." 

*f Verily 



THE DISCARDED SON. 209 

" Verily thou roiinsellest well/' re- 
turned Mrs. Watkins; '' I will, therefore, 
do as thou advisest, as soon as 1 can get 
hold of a man of the law.'* 

^' Oh. -then vou shall soon have hold of 

one, for lam going streight to D , 

and will send lawyer Claw over to you 
immediately/' 

'' Do, and thou ^vilt confer a kindness 
on me, for I am much vexed, and longeth 
to be revenged for the infidelity I have 
met with." 

" To be sure, or you wouldn't be a wo- 
man of spirit â€” Dang me, if I was you/' 
and Stubbs looked a little archly, " if 1 
w^ouldn't try to make him a little jealous 
also/' 

Mrs. Watkins, notwithstanding her vex- 
ation, simpered a linle at this speech; her 
ghastly countenance, however, quickly 
recovered its natural acerbitv on i\\Q re- 
a])pcarance of her husband, who, during' 
the above conversation, which neverthe- 
less had not been loi>t upon him, had been

shifting his clothes in an inner room. Ke 
now attempted not only to deny what 
Stubbs had alledged against him, but to 
put in a caveat against the hostile inten- 
tions of his wife ; but in vain did he try 
to invalidate the testimony of one, or 
subdue the resentment of the other ; and 
Stubbs departed, exulting at the thought 
of having him punished, in some degree, 
for his hypocrisy and impudence. 

On re-entering .the house, he found 
poor Elizabeth in the parlour, and in an 
agony of tears ; the specimen which the 
audacious Watkins had given her, of the 
insults her now unprotected situation ren- 
dered her liable to, having completely 
overpov."ered her spirits. 

He and his dame exerted themselves to 
the utmost, to endeavour to console her; 
and Elizabeth, convinced that to hearts like 
theirs, no return for kindness could be 
half so acceptable as a persuasion of that 
kindness being of service, forced her- 
self to t^ppear benefited by theirs. In 

the

the present state of her feelinLT^, however, 
so painful was it to her to do this, that 
she could not avoid rejoicing, v/hen the 
farmer informed her he was ready to set 

out to D' . 

The prison of her father was a building 
of ancient date, and had for a considerable 
period been the residence of a noble fa- 
mily, the head of which forfeited both 
his title and property, by the active part 
he took in the memorable rebellion of 
forty-five. Soon after the confiscation of 
â€¢his fortune, this, the ancient seat of his 
ancestors, in the stately halis of which 
bards had often rehearsed the exploits of 
the valiant, was converted into a prison, 
for which its strength and healthy situa- 
tion rendered it well calculated. Great 
part of its ancient park still remained at- 
tached to it, affording a pleasant walk to 
such as loved the shade of melancholy 
boughs, and the contemplation of objects 
calculated to send their souk back to the 
days of old. 

Munro 



S12 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Munro found no difficulty in procur- 
ing such apartments as he required; but 
though these were reasonable, and he 
endeavoured to live in the most econo- 
mical manner, denying to himself in- 
dulgences the impaired state of his health 
rendered almost indispensible, he soon 
found himself dreadfully straitened with 
regard to money matters, a circumstance 
particularly distressing at this period ; 
the anxiety of Mrs. Mimro's mind hav- 
ing brought on a nervous fever, that 
rendered her in need of many things he 
was thus without the power of procuring 
her. 

In this exigence, Elizabeth exerted 
herself to the utmost of her power to 
assist her parents. She excelled in fine 
works, and secretly applied to the priest, 
who, from time to time, still continued 
to visit her mother, and was a truly bene- 
volent man, to endeavour to get her em- 
ployment in this line, amongst the families 
he visited. 

The 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2l3 

The good man, at once applauding and 
afTected by the motive that induced her to 
make this application to him, prom.ised 
to do all in his power to serve her. He 
kept his word, but without being able 
to render her any essential service, know- 
ino[ but few families in the nei<>hbour- 
hood. 

Six weeks â€” six heavy and melancholy 
weeks passed away, without any change 
for the better taking place in the situation 
of her parents, when one morning, at the 
expiration of this period, as she was re- 
turning from a shop in D , where 

she had been to make some trifling pur- 
chase, she was overtaken and accosted by 
an elderly man, oi' rather a genteel ap- 
pearance, who having inquired whether 
her name was Munro, and being answered 
in the affirmative, drew a letter from his 
pocket, and presented it to her, with 
an entreaty for her to peruse it on the 

spot. 

Confused 



214 THE DISCAR1>ILD SON. 

Confused and surprised, Elizabeth hesi- 
tated for a few minutes what to do; at 
length, on being urged in a still more 
vehement manner to an immediate per- 
usal, she broke the seal, but with a hand 
rendei^d tremulous by agitation ; and cast- 
ing her eyes over the contents, perceived, 
with amazement that could only be equal- 
ed by the indignation its purport gave rise 
to, ( this being the letter his Lordship had 
ordered to be delivered to her, after she 
had had some weeks experience of the 
bitterness of confinement,) that it came 
from Lord O'Sinister. 

'^ There, Sir,'' cried she, hastily fold- 
ing it up, her pale cheek (lushed to crim- 
son, by the indignant feelings of her soul 
â€” '^ There, Sir," flinging it to its vile 
bearer ; " your returning that letter to his 
Lordship will better explain to him my

tion of which he seeks to deprive me^ it

As for you â€” but/' turning scornfully from 
him, '' I will not degrade myself by hold- 
ing further converse with such a being â€” 
The man capable of accepting such an em- 
ployment as you have done, must be in- 
vulnerable to reproach, destitute of every 
principle of honour, generosity, and feel-

abject of mortals." 

" Nay, young lady, this is being what 
I call rather severe,'' returned the auda- 
cious emissary of his Lordship, endeavour- 
ing at the same time to obstruct her pro- 
gress. 

Elizabeth pushed by him, and flew, 
rather than ran, to the prison, towards 
which, whilst speaking to him, she had 
been rapidly advancing, forgetting, from 
the agitation into which the incident had 
thrown her, that by so doing she might 
expose him to the observation of her fa-

ther, (their sitting-room overlooking the 
street, ) and thus, perhaps^ be compelled 
to enter into explanations she had many- 
reasons for wishing to avoid. 

What she thought not of really happen- 
ed. Munro, soon after she went out, 
sauntered towards a window, whence he 
beheld the whole of the scene between her 
and the vile agent of Lord O'Sinister. Her 
gestures left him no room to doubt her 
having been grossly insulted ; and now â€” 
now he felt with agony the loss of liberty 
â–  â€” now that he beheld his child insulted, 
without iKiving the power of flying to her 
aid, and chastising the wretch who had 
meanly taken advantage of her unprotected 
situation to offend her. 

Breathless, and trembling in every limb, 
Elizabeth would gladly have kept out of 
his sight, till her agitation had in some 
degree subsided, but that she had no other 
alternative, the chamber she occupied be- 
ing only accessible through the sitting- 
room, than to remain exposed to the stare 

of 



THE DISCAllDEB SON. 217 

of a number of the other prisoners^ or re- 
turn to him, to which, of course, she gave 
the preference. 

Having, with all the calmness she could 
assume, and looks purposely averted from 
his, enquired after her mother, who had 
lain down before she went out, she was 
gliding along the side of the room to her 
chamber, when Munro hastily approach- 
ing, seized her by the arm, and drawing 
her towards a window â€” 

'' Elizabeth,'* said he, in a tone almost 
of sternness, and fixing his penetrating 
eyes on her face, " I have just witnessed a 
scene that requires explanation/' 

Elizabeth started â€” her cheek alternately 
faded and flushed â€” every look evinced dis- 
tress and confusion. At length, after the 
hesitation of a few minutes, she attempted 
to stammer out something of having been 
mistaken for another person. 

Her father looked at her with still more 
scrutinizing earnestness â€” " Elizabeth," said 
he, in an accent such as he had never be- 

voL. V. L fore

fore addressed her in^ '^ no prevarication â€” 
By Heaven, I'll have the truth/' 

Shocked and alarmed^ Elizabeth dropt 
kneeling at his feet ; still, however, she 
endeavoured to avoid the explanation he 
demanded. Her efforts to do so, however, 
proved unavailing; the paternal anxiety 
of her father was too much awakened, to 
permit him to allow of any evasion ; and 
by degrees the whole of Lord O'Sinister's 
conduct towards her was unfolded to him. 

The emotions to which the disclosure 
gave rise, may easier be conceived than 
described ; with horror at her narrow es- 
cape from the snares of the villain, was 
mingled indignation and rage, at the de- 
ceptions practised on himself, which the 
particulars she gave, or, more correctly 
speaking, he extorted from her, fully eluci- 
dated. For a few minutes he felt too be- 
wildered, too agitated, to be able to arti- 
culate more than, like Goldsmith's good- 
natured manâ€” 

*Â« How have I been decciv'd !'* 

â€¢ With 



I THE DISCARDED SON. 219 

With fervent piety his heart then as- 
cended in thanksgiving to Heaven^ for the 
preservation of his child â€” " Oh thou/' he 
cried, one hand resting on the shoulder of 
the weeping and still kneeling Elizabeth, 
the other raised in a supplicating attitude 
â€” ^' Oh thou, who hast hitherto protected 
the innocence of my child, still, still 
vouchsafe to make her thy care ! Should 
it be thy divine wall to call me hence, ere 
the allurements of youth and beauty are 
faded, oh, raise her up some tender guar- 
dian to supply my place, and guard her 
from the perils to which they expose 
herl" 

It was settled that nothing should be said 
to her mother respecting the baseness of 
Lord O'Sinister. Nothing, however, could 
prevent Munro from writing an upbraid- 
ing letter to him, in which, after fully 
expatiating on the enormity of his con- 
duct, he bade him beware, if he wished 
to avoid being held up to the contempt 
he merited, of again insulting his daughter. 
L 2 From 



220 THE DISCARDED SON. 

From this period, another six weeks 
passed away, without anything occurring 
to interrupt in any degree the now tire- 
some monotony of their days; at the ex- 
piration of which, Munro found himself 
so cruelly embarrassed, as to decide upon 
addressing his father. At first he re- 
solved on concealing from his wife and 
daughter his application to him, lest it 
should inspire hopes that- might expose 
them to disappointment ; but the agitation 
into which penning it threw him, took 
from him the power of adhering to this 
resolution. 

The day after he dispatched it, an 
answer w^as returned. Munro attempted 
to open it, but the agitation occasioned 
by the idea of perusing a letter that 
ivouldj in all probability, decide his fate, 
was so great, that he was under the ne- 
cessity of resigning it to Elizabeth, who 
was alone present. 

Their astonishment at its contents was 
unspeakable, nor was their anguish less; 

but 



THE DISCARDED SON. 221 

but ere these are mentioned, it is necessary 
to relate, that a short period before the 
imprisonment of Miinro, one dreary night, 
^vhen the whirling tempest raved along 
the heath, and foul and fierce all winter 
drove along the darkened air, a gentle- 
man and his servant, on iiorseback, mis- 
sing the beaten track over it, appliel at 
the house of Munro for directions to re- 
gain it. 

Munro, whose native hospitality and 
benevglence nothing could impair, mi 
satisfied with giving them the required in- 
formation, kindly invited them to alight, 
and take shelter in his dwelling, till the fury 
of the storm had abated. 

His invitation was joyfully accepted; the 
servant was sent to enjoy the comforts of 
his kitchen fire, and the master brought in 
to participate in those of his parlour. 

Scarce had he entered it, ere Munro 

recognized in him an old acquaintance, 

of the name of Macintosh, a Baronet, 

L 3 residing 



222 THE DISCARDED SON. 

residing in the neighbourhood of Glen- 
gary. 

This recognition, however^ led to no 
conversation of a particular nature, nor 
produced any alteration in the manner 
of either â€” One still remained lively and 
communicative, the other courteous and 
unembarrassed. 

The mind of Munro was just at this junc- 
ture too much occupied by the unplea- 
santness of his situation, to permit him to 
dwell on any thing which did not imme- 
diately concern himself; he, therefore, 
scarcely bestowed a thought on Sir James 
after he had quitted his habitation. 

But not so Sir James â€” his thoughts 
continued to hover round the dwelling of 
Munro, long after he had taken his depar- 
ture from it : in a w^ord, the beauty of 
Elizabeth had made a complete conquest 
of his heart; and of no object but her 
could he think, at least with any degree 



of pleasure to himself. 



He 



THE DISCARDED SO^N. S'23 

He was at this period someWliat advanc- 
ed in life, and in his person betrayed both 
the ravages of time and dissipation^ to 
which he had always been inclined; but 
without suffering his propensity to it to 
involve him in any difficulties, his avarice 
and ambition being fully equal to his 
passion for pleasure. 

Fortune smiled not on his youth, but 
love made amends for her deficiencies; 
his then handsome figure and insinuating 
address so recommending him to the good 
graces of a lady of large fortune, near 
Glengary, but unpossessed of any attrac- 
tions but what she derived from that for- 
tune, as to induce her to bestow her hand 
on him. Contrary to his expectations, 
and with equal truth it might be said, his 
wishes, (for she was considerably older than 
himself, ) she continued to maintain her post 
in this world at the period which again in- 
troduced Munro to his knowledge. Notwith- 
standing this circumstance, however, he 
would have had no hesitation in endeavour- 
L 4 ing 



224 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ing to create for himself an interest in the 
fair bosom of the lovely Elizabeth, but that 
he feared dangerous consequences might 
result to him, from deceiving the daughter 
of such a man as Munro. 

A few days previous to the receipt of 
Munro 's letter at Glengary, his matrimo- 
nial fetters were broken by the hand of 
death. Scarcely did he find himself freed 
from them, ere he conceived the project 
of endeavouring at once to gratify both 
his love and his avarice, by trying to pre- 
vail on Mrs. Munro to persuade her hus- 
band to make Elizabeth his heiress, and 
bestow her on him. 

That he knew he had some influence with 
Mrs. Munro, or he never would have 
thought of such a project, may readily 
be supposed. She had for years been a 
constant visitor at his house, the servile 
homage she paid Lady Macintosh, in order 
to obtain the countenance of a woman of 
her rank and respectability in the neigh- 
bourhood, having rendered her a great 

favourite 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2^5 

favourite with her Ladyship, whose pride 
was excessive; and Sir James^ from his wish 
to stand well with all who could in any 
degree contribute to his gratification, had 
the address to persuade her she was equally 
esteemed bv him. 

Convinced bv this condiict that he had 
attached her to his interest, no sooner had 
he seen the remains of his lady consigned 
to the spot v/here he had been long wish- 
ing to see them deposited, than he re- 
quested a private audience of Mrs. Munro, 
in which he briefly revealed the pur- 
pose for which he had desired it; and 
pledged himself, if she succeeded in the 
business he wished her to undertake, to 
make not only a handsome addition to 
her jointure, but to let her retain pos- 
session of the mansion-house during her 
life, and in every respect treat her as the 
head of the family. 

Pride and selfishness were Mrs. Munro 's 

governing, principles ; it cannot, there- 

L J fore 



^26 THE DISCARDED SON. 

forC;, be supposed she had any hesitation in 
agreeing to do what promised so amply 
to gratify both. In the efforts she made 
for accomplishing the wishes of Sir James^ 
and to which she pretended to her credu- 
lous husband, she was merely stimulated by 
a sense of justice and humanity^ she quickly 
succeeded. 

In consequence^ a letter was on the 
point of being dispatched to his long dis- 
carded and cruelly persecuted son, at the 
moment his arrived at Glengary. 

The answer returned to his application 
was dictated by Sir James, and written by 
Mrs. Munro, her husband having long 
been under the necessity of employing 
an amanuensis ; and briefly stated that he, 
Mr. Munro, being disinclined to visit the 
sins of the father upon the children, had 
decided upon making his granddaughter 
his heiress, provided she consented to ac- 
cept the hand of Sir James Macintosh, ( of 
whose wealth, consequence, and virtues,'

THE DISCARDED SON. 227 

an exaggerated account was given,) in 
which case, but on no other condition, his 
affairs should be arranged, and a proper 
provision made for him and his family. 

To describe what Elizabeth felt at the 
perusal of this letter, at finding, as it 
were, the fate of her parents put into her 
hands, and that without making a sacrifice 
no less painful in her idea than would have 
been that of life, there was no hope â€” no 
prospect of their being restored to liberty, 
or any other comfort, would be impossible. 

Recoiling from making this sacrifice, yet 
almost ashamed of doing so, she sought to 
avoid the looks of her father, lest she should 
read reproach and indignation in them, 
for her hesitation on the subject. 

His disposition, however, was too dis- 
interested, to permit him to feel either 
angry or indignant at this circumstance ; 
nor from his knowledoe of the streno;th of 
her attachment to Delacour, did he feel 
any surprise at it. For the first time, how- 
ever, he wished, but in silence, that this 
L Q atttach- 



S28 THE DISCARDED SON, 

attachment had not existed, since nothings 
he almost felt persuaded^ from the style of 
the letter just received^ but her compli- 
ance with the wishes of her grandfather, 
could obtain for him any change of situa- 
tion. 

He determined;, however;, not to let 
despair prevent his making another effort 
for the purpose ; accordingly^ as soon as 
he had dissipated the terrors under which 
he saw poor Elizabeth trembled^ he ad- 
dressed another letter to his father, stating 
the engagement between her and Delacour;, 
and conjuring him, in the most energetic 
termS;, not to let her refusing to break a 
vow^ which honour and generosity alike 
demanded her keeping, since nothing could 
be more disinterested â€” more noble than 
the conduct of her lover, prevent him 
from rendering him the assistance he re- 
quired. 

Elizabeth tried to hope this letter would 
have the wished-for effect ; but if it should 
not, her heart almost died within her at 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 225 

the idea. How then was she to act ? â€” 
*' Relinquish hope â€” relinquish happiness 
â€” relinquish Delacour !'* was her response 
to this self-interrogatory^ In the solitude of 
her chamber, and the hour of darkness and 
despair â€” Yes^ if nothing but her acquies- 
cence to the proposal of her grandfather 
could obtain the enlargement of her father^ 
she solemnly vowed to comply with it.

UNRO, too "vvell acquainted with the 
stubborn nature of his father, to imagine 
he would give up a measure on which he 
appeared to have set his heart, and unsus- 
picious of the resolution Elizabeth had 
formed, the subject being too painful for 
her to touch on, could no longer make a 
struggle against despair. Want already- 
stared him in the face, and the horrors its 
approach excited were aggravated by the 

languishing 



THE DISCARDED SON. 231 

languishing state of Mrs. Munro's health 
and his anticipation of what the sufferings 
and dangers of Elizabeth would in all pro- 
bability be^ should she^, as now appeared 
likely to be the case, be left an orphan 
ere the return of Delacour. The gloom of 
his mind infected his manners, and com- 
municated itself to his countenance; he 
could no longer force himself to converse, 
no longer command a smile; the society 
of his wife and daughter ceased to charm, 
and'in the most retired parts of the grounds 
attached to the prison, he now passed 
those hours he had heretofore devoted to 
them. 

Elizabeth, ignorant of what was really 
passing in his mind, imputed the sudden 
alteration in his manners to displeasure, at 
her having had any hesitation on a point 
which concerned his happiness and her 
mother's. 

'' He accuses me, in all probability," 
she cried to herself, '' of selfishness â€” deems 

me 



23^ THE DISCARDED SON. 

me unworthy, perhaps, of the tenderness 
he has so long lavished on me â€” " the idea 
almost rived her heart â€” '' But his cruel 
father, perhaps/' she continued, '' will 
furnish me w^ith an opportunity of proving 
to him that I am not entirely engrossed by 
selfâ€” Oh, should he,'' with all the wildness 
of despair she added, '' at what a price â€” at 
what a dreadful price shall I regain his 
good opinion l'*^ 

An answer was returned to Munro's 
second application the evening after it 
was sent. Their frugal dinner over, Mrs. 
Munro had withdrawn to her humble 
couch, which she v/as now^ seldom able to 
quit for any length of time, and only he and 
Elizabeth, at the moment of its delivery, 
were together, seated at a distance from 
each other, silent, sorrowful, abstracted. 

With something like a feeling of despera- 
tionâ€” a feeling which gave a transient 
animation to his countenance, Munro 
broke the seal. A gbnce at the contents 

sufficed 



THE DISCARDED SON. 235 

suflBced to convince him they were unfa- 
vourablc;, and dropping the letter^, he 
struck his hand on his forehead, and in- 
stantly rushed from the room. 

As he quitted it, Elizabeth rose from 
her seat, and with trembling knees (his 
emotion making her apprehend the worst) 
approached the chair he had occupied, and 
taking up the letter, glanced over it. For 
an instant she remained motionless, the pic- 
ture of despair, then sinking on her knees 
â€” '' Ch, Delacour! â€” beloved Delacour!" 
she exclaimed, clasping her hands together, 
'' must I then give you up ? â€” Is there no 
way of saving my family, but by my re- 
signation of you ? â€” Alas ! I behold none ; 
and in breaking the vov.' I fondly plighted 
to you, I plant thorns in my bosom, which 
must for ever rankle there. Since thus 
doomed to part, would that we had never 
Biet â€” never met!" she repeated with a 
burst of anguish, and drawing from hev 
bosom his picture â€” that picture which had 

so 



2j4 TIiE DISCARDED SON. 

SO long been pressed against the heart 
where his image was enshrined â€” so often 
addressed and wept over â€” '' Ah, Hea- 
vens ! how little did he imagine^ when he 
sent me this, the hour would ever arrive 
in which I should have uttered such a 
wish!" 

Her contemplation of the likeness of her 
lover did not tend to assuage her anguish; 
she pressed it involuntarily, and with agon- 
izing tenderness, to her pale and quivering 
lips â€” she deluged it with her tears â€” she 
held it to her heart, as if she never, never 
meant again to take it thence, while with 
a despairing look her eyes were raised to- 
w'ards Heaven, as if, like the unhappy Ju- 
liet, demanding '' whether there was no 
pity sitting in the clouds, that saw into 
the bottom of her grief?'* 

Her thoughts at length reverting to her 
father â€” to the air of distraction with which 
he had quitted the room, she hastily arose, 
and not without bitterly reproaching her- 
self 



THE DISCARDED SON. 235 

self for having so long delayed to follow 
him, hastened to the solitary haunt he 
was wont to frequent. 

The gloom of twilight had already fallen 
o'er the scene, and a cold and savage blast 
howled mournfully through the old and 
leafless trees that shadowed the spof. She 
found him pacing the ground, with an air 
that too evidently proclaimed the dreadful 
agitation of his mind, 

'' Oh ! my dear father/* she instantly ex- 
claimed, in accents of mingled tenderness 
and melancholy, '^ what an evening is 
this for you to be out ! â€” let me conjure 
you to come in.'' 

Munro, for the first time shrinking from 
her, on her attempting to take his arm-, 
motioned with his hand for her to leave 
him. 

^' Oh, I cannot â€” cannot V* she cried â€” 
'^ I cannot think of leaving you exposed to 
such a storm as this." 

Again Munro waved his hand for her to 

quit 



^36' THE DISCAKDED SON. 

quit him â€” '' No/' said he, in a tone of 
sternness and solemnity : '' the storm 
within/* and he struck his breast, '' renders 
me insensible to that without ; but even 
if this were not the case, my life is now of 
too little consequence, too wretched, to 
permit me to be anxious to preserve it â€” â€¢ 
he who looks forward w-ithout hope, can 
scarcely be anxious to avoid death. Like 
a blasted tree, I have withered, no mdre 
to revive ; and the sooner 1 drop, the 
better." 

Elizabeth's alarm encreased â€” she looked 
earnestly in his face â€” his eye was wild â€” 
his cheek of a sallow paleness â€” of the 
brightness of his countenance not a trace 
remained. 

*' Oh, should the sacrifice I am about 
making be made too Lite to save him !'* 
she internally exclaimed. 

Shuddering at the fearful idea, she 
clung to his arm â€” '' Oh, my father \" she 
cried, '' despair not of yet enjoying. hap-

her father regarding her with a look of min- 
gled incredulity and wonder, ^' that I could 
know myself possessed of the power of 
obtaining your liberty^ and yet refuse ex- 
ercising it ?'' 

Munro no longer doubting her sincerity, 
clasped her to his heart â€” '' Many daugh- 
ters have done virtuously,*' he exclaimed^ 
as he strained her to his bosom, while tears 
of tenderness, gratitude, pity, and regret, 
gushed from him, and bedewed her pale 
cheek; ^' but thou â€” oh! thou^ my Eliza- 
beth^ excellest them all, for well I know 
what it must cost thee to make the sacrifice 
thou hast promised.** 

" I â€” I will not deny..** returned Eliza- 
beth, in faltering accents, '' that it is a

painful one ; 'tis due to Delacour;, 'tis 
due to my own character^ to acknowledge 
that I cannot break my engagement to him 
wiihout a pang. But oh^ my father^ have 
you not instructed^ have you not taught 
me to believe^ that virtue will still pour 
balm o'er the wounds inflicted by the sa- 
crifices she demands of us ?" 

'' Yes^ assuredly ; the sorrov/s of virtue 
are still followed by her consolations : but, 
my Elizabeth, lest you should he tempted 
to imagine the nature of your father 
changed, that seliishness has at length 
gained dominion over him, I protest to 
you, in the awful sight of Heaven, that no- 
thing but consideration for your mother, 
nothing short of being convinced she must, 
sink beneath her present sufferings, if not 
speedily alleviated, could indu(^e me to 
permit the sacrifice you have decided 
on/' 

He no longer delayed returning to his 

apartment, which he had no sooner entered, 

3 than 



THE DISCARDED SON. S39 

than he sat down to answer the letter from 
Glengary : with pain â€” with anguish of heart 
he wrote it, too well acquainted with the 
nature of Elizabeth not to know what she 
must suffer on the present occasion; too 
sincerely attached to Delacour â€” the warm- 
hearted and noble Delacour^ not to be 
agonized by the idea of what he would 
feelj when he should hear of her broken 
vow, her violated fa^th â€” in short, her re- 
solution, far' from lessening tis wretched- 
ness, only changed the nature of it. Gf 
this Mrs. Munro v:as now informed, but 
without any comment on the pain attend- 
ing on it. Like her husband, however, 
she had too perfect a knowledge of the dis- 
position of Elizabeth, not to know what her 
feelings relative to it must be ; and as 
nothing but consideration for her couM 
have induced him to acquiesce in it, so 
nothing but a conviction, that a much 
longer continuance in prison would prove 
fatal to him, could have occasioned hereto 

do so. 

Munre's 



g40 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Munro*s letter to Glengary brought the 

transported Sir James to D the next 

morning, with a letter from the old gen- 
tleman, enclosing a bank note of fifty 
pounds, but stating, that in consequence of 
the evidently reluctant acquiescence, his 
proposal of uniting her to the Baronet had 
met with, he had decided on not libe- 
rating him, till the marriage of Elizabeth 
had taken place. 

The base, the ungenerous distrust this 
letter manifested his father harbouring of 
him, roused all that was fiery and indignant 
in the nature of Munro. The presence of 
Sir James, however, made him quickly 
endeavour to subdue the emotion it ex- 
cited. 

After expatiating some time on the pain 
he felt at the idea of his having suffered 
so much, and the happiness he should de- 
rive from endeavouring to prove himself 
"worthv of his future confidence and friend- 
ship. Sir James requested to be indulged 
with an interview with his fair mistress^ 

who^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 24 I 

who, on the announcement of his name, 
had precipitately, with her mother, left 
the room. 

Since matters had proceeded thus far, 
Munro, conceiving it but right that he 
should be gratified, repaired to Elizabeth. 
He found her in a state of the most pain- 
ful agitation ; but though every feeling 
revolted at the idea of seeing Sir James, 
of listening to a declaration which never 
â€” never, she felt persuaded, could again 
be pleasing to her ear, she refused not com- 
plying with his request, but let her father 
lead her to the room, since, like him, she 
could not avoid acknowledging, that since 
she had consented to accept the addresses 
of Sir James, propriety demanded her act- 
ing so as to conceal her repugnance to 
them ; but notwithstanding this, involun- 
tarily, and with averted eyes, she shrunk 
back, on his attempting to take her hand 
from her father. He persisted, however, 
and leading her to a seat, spite of her too 
evident distress, with a cheek flushed with 

VOL. V. M rapture. 



342 THE DISCAr^DED SON. 

rapture, for Sir James was incapable of 
feelinpj for any mortal but hiniself^ thanked 
her^ in the most high-flown terms^ for con- 
senting to render him the most enviable of 
men, and assured her the study of his life 
should be to evince his gratitude. 

Elizabeth tried to listen to him with com- 
posure; buf when he ventured to press 
for an early day, and artfully represented 
the necessity there w^as for it, by mention- 
ing^ her grandfather's determination rela- 
tive to her father, and which he pretended 
he had vainly attempted to alter, she could 
no longer controul her feelings. Snatch- 
ing away her hand, she started up, and 
flew from the room, in an agony too great 
for description. But scarcely had she left 
it, ere tenderness for her parents induced 
her to return, and falter out ai) apology for 
having quitted it so abruptly. 

Sir James, whatever might be the dis- 
pleasure he felt, and that he felt some was 
probable, as he was both a vain and an ir- 
ritable man^ at an emotion which augured

his being more than indifferent to her, let 
nothing be seen in his looks and manner 
but smiles and softness ; he again led Vei* 
to a seat, expressed the deepest regret for 
(he sudden indisposition to which he af- 
fected to impute her recent conduct, and 
finalty by degrees revived the subject which 
had been thus interrupted; and had, at 
length, the supreme felicity of receiving a 
promise from her to become his in the 
course of a few days, but accompanied by 
a request, to be excused seeing him again, 
till the one appointed for their mar- 
riage â€” a request which, after her ready 
acquiescence to his wishes. Sir James could 
not avoid complying with. 

The disgust which Elizabeth felt at the 
jRaming declarations of Sir James, united 
to her wish for an uninterrupted opportu-' 
nity of endeavouring to reason herself into 
composure, andreconcileherself in some de- 
gree to a fate that now seemed inevitable, 
was her motive for this request. 

But in vain did she endeavour to reason. 
M 3 with

with herself â€” the nearer the hour ap- 
proached, in which to dwell longer on the 
idea of Delacour^ that idea which she had 
so long, so fondly cherished, would be 
criminal, the more wretched she became. 
No tear, no sigh, however, betrayed to 
her parents what she suffered ; nor was a 
tear, a sigh, requisite to do so ; her coun- 
tenance was the faithful index of her 
heart, and with unutterable anguish, from 
its sad expression, they perceived that at 
the shrine of filial duty she was about sa- 
crificing every hope of earthly happiness. 
Munros anguish was rendered still more 
poignant than his wife's, by the observa- 
tions which he had opportunities of mak- 
ing on Sir James, and which inclined him 
to believe he was one of those selfish cha- 
racters, who make their own gratification 
their first, if not sole consideration, and 
with whom, of course, it was not to be 
imagined a person of so very opposite 
a nature as was Elizabeth, could ever en- 
joy felicity. 

Still, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 245 

Stilly however^ notwithstanding this siir- 
misCj the situation of her mother withheld 
him from desiring to see her recede from 
her newly-formed engagement ; and there 
were moments in which he tried to sooth 
his agonized mind, by indulging a hope 
that her gentle virtues, her unaffected 
sanctity, and sweetness of disposition, 
would have too powerful an effect upon 
Sir James, not to permit the fulfilment of 
this engagement to obtain her some degree 
of happiness. 

Such was the substance of the story 
which Stubbs, in his plain, though prolix 
manner, related to the deeply-interested 
and agonized Osmond. We shall not 
dwell on the frequent interruptions it re- 
ceived from him, neither the alternate 
bursts of passion and of sorrow it excited ; 
suffice, that on its conclusion, he might 
with truth have said â€” 

'< There's not a wretch that lives on common charity. 
Bat's happier far than me." 

M 3 In 



^46 THE mSCAKDtD SON. 

In vain did Stubbs, who^, as he pro- 
ceeded in his narrative, had gradually 
raised himself in his estimation, by the part 
Avhich, notwithstanding his unostentatious 
spirit^ he could not avoid acknowledging 
he had taken in the concerns of his family, 
endeavour to assuage his anguish, and pre- 
vail on him to partake of the frugal fai'e 
set before him. His artless eloquence was 
unavailing, and, at length, silenced, by Os- 
mond's telling him, after he had gratefully 
thanked him for his attention, that the 
greatest kindness he could at present con- 
fer on him, would be to let him take pos- 
session of the chamber he had so hospita- 
bly offered him. 

The principal part of the night, for he 
neither thought of undressing or reposing, 
was passed, by Osmond, in pacing the nar- 
row limits of his chamber, mourning over 
the misery of his family. 

" Unhappy parents," he repeatedly ex- 
claimed, '^ \vhat must you not sufler at 
beholding the, wretchedness of your daugh- 
ter ! 



THE DISCARDED SO^. 247 

ttv f and yoUj my clear, dear sister, would 
to Heaven, by the sacrifice of myself, I 
could save you from that you are about 
i"naking \" 

Was there no way, he considered, by 
which this sacrifice might be prevented ? 
might not an appeal to the honour, the 
sensibility of Sir James, or a representa- 
tion in person on the subject to his grand- 
father, avert it? 

*"' But no^ no/' with all the wildness of 
despair, he replied to himself, '' Sir James 
has not feelings that can be moved by an 
appeal of the kind, or he never could 
have acted as he has done ; nor the obdu- 
rate parent of my father, a particle of hu- 
manity in his disposition, or he never would 
have taken advantage of the distress of his 
son, to doom his child to misery !" 

But the contemplation of this misery wa& 
not his only source of anguish at present ; 
tJie idea of what he was thoroughly con- 
vinced Delacour would suffer, at losing 
Elizabeth, scarcely less tortufed him. 

M 4 '' Oh 



248 . THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' Oh why, why/' in agony he exclaimed, 
'^ must a love like theirs be rent asunder! 
Ohj Delacour^ dear and inestimable friend, 
must the cup of sorrow be administered to 
thee by friends, to whom thy happiness is 
so precious!" 

At the first dawn of day he quitted his 

chamber, impatient to set out for D . 

Stubbs, however, could not immediately 
attend him thither ; he was, therefore, 
forced to curb his impatience, as, without 
his return being cautiously announced to 
his family, he could not think of appear- 
ing before them, lest, in the present agi- 
tated state of their feelings, seeing him 
abruptly might be attended with fatal 
consequences; especially as he knew there 
was nothing they less expected at this mo- 
ment, owing to their having, Stubbs in- 
formed him, received the letter he wrote 
from Naples, stating his being to all ap- 
pearance settled there for life, and express- 
ing his hope of their shortly joining him 
in that kingdom. 

To 



THE DISCARDED SON. 249 

To while away the tedious moments he 
was obliged to wait for the farmer, or ra- 
ther avoid that observation so irksome 
to the suffering heart, he strolled into 
the garden, and from thence to a wild 
and savage part of the heath, where, at 
this early hour, every thing looked cold, 
bleak, and dismal. The summits of the 
immense mountains, viewed from hence, 
rugged with rocks, and patched with a rank 
and mournful grass, and appearing, from 
the undulating horizon they formed, as if, 
(to make use of the words of a modern 
writer, in speaking of similar onesj " im- 
pelled and driven onward in immense 
waves and broken swells,'' were yet veiled 
in heavy clouds, while the mists and exha- 
lations of morning returned in streaming 
showers upon the vallies that intersected 
them, heightening their dreariness almost 
to horror. 

The sympathetic gloom of every object 

was, however, infinitely more consonant 

to the present feelings of Osmond, than a 

M 5 livelier 



!^50 THE DISCARDED SON. 

livelier scene would have been; and he 
nccordingly continued wandering abour, 
gazing on the well-remembered haunts of 
his childhood^ with a sensation of mingled 
bitterness and pleasure, till Stubbs came in 
quest of mn)j to inform him he was ready 
to attend him to D . 

Midvv-ay between it and Heathwood 
they met a chaise andfour^ driving rapidly 
towards the latter place, from, which, as it 
passed^ Osmond was much surprised at 
hearing himself called. lie stopped; the 
chaise did so at the same moment, and 
with sensations impossible to be described^ 
he beheld Delacour. 

'"' Good Heavens ! do niy senses deceive 
rne '/' cried Delacour, bursting open the 
door^ and springing out, '' or have I really 
the happiness of seeing you â€” still seeing 
you in the land of the living ! O, m,y dear, 
dear fellov//' shaking Osmond by the 
hand,, with all rhe cordiality of friendship, 
**what have I not suffered on your account! 
The idea of your dismal fate made me 

dread. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 251 

dread^ as much as long, to behold your 
family : but no more^ at least at present^ 
of past sorrows â€” this blessed moment more 
than compensates for all. Come, you 
must turn back with me ; and as we pro- 
ceed to Heathwood^ gratify the anxiety I 
feelj to know by what miracle, for to no- 
thing less can I think your preservatioti 
owing, you escaped the merciless waves 
that swallowed up the frigate you were in."" 

'' You shallhear all, my dear friend/^ re- 
turned Osmond; '' but you must order the 
chaise to turn, for â€” for," involuntarily he- 
sitating, ''mv familv have leftHeathwood.'' 

''â€¢' Left Hcathwood!" echoed Delacour^ 
in an accent indicative of the greatest suf* 
prise ; '*" what that dear little snug retreat 
your father was so fond of ! but I trust th^ey 
have not removed to any great distance 
from it." 

''No, not a great way," replied Osmond, 
with forced composure ; '' but order the 
carriage to turn, and take us to the. inn at 
D-â€” ." 

^A 6 Then 



25^ THE DISCARDED SON. 

Then drawing Stubbs aside, he, in a low 
voice, requested him to hasten to his fa- 
ther, cautiously break his return, and in- 
form him, but without touching on the 
incident that had just taken place, that he 
would shortly be with him. 

" Good God r' exclaimed the warm- 
hearted Delacour, with a burst of grateful 
joy, on Osmond's taking a seat beside him, 
''how little did I imagine, at the com- 
mencement of this day, such happiness 
was in store for me, as I now enjoy, from 
seeing you again in health and safety ! â€” 
Yet great as it is,'' he added^ after a tran- 
sient pause, and with a half sigh, '^ it is 
liot perfect. The idea of returning to 
y.our, sister, only rich in love, prevents its 
being so. The hopes with which I quit- 
ted England have been disappointed. In- 
stead of making the prosperous voyage I 
expectedi ere I had compleated it, the ship 
I commanded, inconsequence of the inju- 
ry it sustained, in an engagement with two 
larger vessels of the enemy, which we had 

the 



THE DISCARDED SOX. 253 

the satisfaction^ however, of thinking we 
revenged in a manner that must prevent 
their shortly making another, foundered; 
and my brave companions and I must have 
gone to the bottom, but for a frigate 
bound for England, that suddenly hove in 
sight, the fleet with which we set sail 
from Portsmouth being dispersed by heavy 
gales. My ship, as you may perceive,'* 
glancing with a half smile at his arm, which 
Osmond, now for the first time, perceived 
in a sling, "was not all that suffered in the 
battle with the Monsieurs." 

All hope of Delacour's being able to 
prevent the sacrifice of his sister, destroyed 
by this statement, Osmond felt himself more 
wretched than ever, so painful to his feelings 
was the idea of the task, which he saw had 
devolved to him, of acquainting him with 
the loss of Elizabeth, 

After a little deliberation, he resolved 
on being silent on the subject, till they 
had reached the inn, and then, on practis- 
ing

ing a little deception on Delacour, by 
informing him Elizabeth was already mar- 
ried^ lest otherwise he should attempt 
to obtain an interview with her/ and thus 
augment the wretchedness of all par- 
ties. 

" Is there an absolute necessity for our 

stopping at D ?'* asked Delacour sud- 

denly^, and with an anxious look. 

Oppressed by the most agonizing sensa- 
tions, Osmondj with difficulty, articulated 
â€” '^Yes.'^ 

''And why ?" demanded Delacour, still 
more earnestly and anxiously, 

'' You shall â€” hear/' with involuntary 
hesitation, returned Osmond, '* as soon as 
we get to the inn/* 

*' To the inn V repeated the impetuous 
Delacour. '' Dear Osmond,'* suddenly 
grasping his arm, and looking in his face, 
''â– you alarm me â€” your manner is constrain- 
ed â€” your looks are embarrassed â€” more,

the tortures of suspense are not endurable/' 

"1 conjure you to suspend for the pre- 
sent all further enquiries on the sub- 
ject/' cried Osmond, in the most suppli- 
cating accent, unwilling, from the agita- 
tion he was in, to commence yet awhile the 
story he had to relate. 

*^ Impossible â€” impossible ! you might as 
well bid the wild waves be still, as bid me 
cease my enquiries till answered/' 

V See, D â€” â€” appears in sight/' cried 
Osmond ; ^' a few minutes more, and you. 
shall be gratified, my dear Delacour/' 

" Well, now I trust/' said Delacour, on 
their entering an apartment, shutting 
ihe door, and turning towards Osmond 
^as he spoke, '' you will no longer hesi- 
tate releasing me from the rack on which 
you have placed me/' 

" Heaven can attest how unv.'illingly," 

returned Osmond, in accents of mingled 

'solemnity and tenderness. ^'Oh Delacour,

^56^ THE DISCARDED SON.

heart, without inflicting a still severer one

hours I have experienced, since we last 
parted ; but this outdoes them all in 
bitterness, since it reduces me to the ne- 
cessity of wounding the feelings of him,

beth "' 

^' Drive me not to madness by pausing!" 
exclaimed Delacour, the flush which impa- 
tience had given to his manly cheek yield- 
ing to a deathlike paleness, and his lips 
quivering through emotion. '' Elizabeth ! 
what â€” what of her }" 

'' Is- " 

"Dead!'' interrupted Delacour, "in a 
tone of horror, and evidently holding by 
a chair to prevent himself from sinking to 
the floor. 

" To you,'' returned Osmond, after the 
silence of a minute, and in a solemn and 
emphatic accent. 

" Ha !'-â€¢ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 257 

*'' Ha!'' exclaimed Delacour^, starting, 
and with an emotion that again crimsoned 
his cheek; ^' what say you ?" approaching 
Osmond ; " Elizabeth not dead but to me ! 
' â€” do you mean to insinuate that she is 
faithless â€” do you wish me to understand 

that she is " 

'' Married," cried Osmond, with difR- 
culty, and instantly turning from his 
gaze. 

'^ Married â€” Elizabeth married !" repeated 
Delacour, after a silence of some minutes 
â€” a silence, which more forcibly than lan- 
guage could have done, proclaimed the 
shock the intelligence had given him. 
â€” "But," after another pause, *^*^ what a 
fool am I to be so surprised at the news ! 
for w^hat attractions can I pretend to, that 
I should be astonished at not being able to 
fix the wavering affections of a volatile 
woman ? You will oblige me," he added, 
but evidently with difficulty, and in a tone 
of mingled irony and bitterness, ''by letting

me know who my happy successor in her 
favour is?" 

Osmond^ but with reluctance, informed 
him. 

^' A Baronet !" resumed Delacour; '^well, 
my pride at least should be gratified by her 
not having sacrificed me to a meaner ri- 
val" 

"â–  O Delacour/" cried Osmond^ turning 
v/ith quickness towards him, eager, from 
laudable pride^ to vindicate his sister, of 
the selfishness, inconstancy, and vanity, 
which it was now evident Delacour im- 
puted to her, '' could you look into her 
heart, you %vould find " 

He paused â€” paused, owing to his sud- 
denly reflecting on the cruelty he should 
be guilty of, in trying to ju*?tify Elizabeth 
in the opinion of her lover, since no 
doubt could be entertained, tiiat in pro- 
portion TO his esteem for her, w^ould be 
his regret for her loss. 

''"Well," resumed Delacour, after evi- 
dently 



THE DISCARDED SON. 259 

dently waiting a few minutes for him to 
finish the sentence, *^' could I look into her 
heart, what should I find there ? â€” art, 
afTectation, and vanity/' 

''Let us wave the subject/' cried Os- 
mond, greatly agitated ; 'tis a most un- 
pleasant one." 

'' Truly so/' returned Delacour, '' as 
would, indeed, any other at the present 
moment, for I feel much fatigued ; as I 
cannot, therefore,'' pulling the bell as he 
spoke, '' any longer enjoy your company, 
I request you may frot, on my account, de- 
lay rejoining your no doubt happy family.*' 

^' My happy family !" almost groaned 
Osmond ; '' Oh Delacour ." 

A waiter appearing, Delacour desired to 
be shewn to another room. 

" Delacour, stop, for an instant, I im- 
plor-e you," cried Osmond, alarmed by the 
wildness of his looks, and agonized at the 
idea of his shutting himself up to brood 
over his disappointment; '' surely," catch*

ing him by the arm, as he was quitting the 
apartment, '' you do not mean to let us 
part in such a manner â€” you do not in- 
tend to let what has happened interrupt 
our friendship ?" 

'* For ever/"* returned Delacour, with a 
look of fierceness, and in a corresponding 
tone. ^^ Of your truth, your sincerity, I 
entertained not a higher opinion than I 
did of your sister's, and yet she has de- 
ceived â€” cruelly deceived me ; I will not, 
therefore, put it in the power of another 
of the family to do so. From this period 
I trust the name of Munro will remain a 
stranger to my ear." 

" Time often conquers strong preju*- 
dices,'' said Osmond ; '' I will not, there- 
fore, despair of your yet being convinced, 
that among your friends you do not rank 
more sincere ones than are those who bear 
it.'' 

'' Perhaps so ; but till that time arrives;^ 
I trust we shall never meet." 

'' Greatly 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2G1' 

^^ Greatly as my feelings are hurt by 
yoiir treatment/' cried Osmond, " yet I 
cannot â€” cannot bring myself to join in 
that wish." 

Delacour, without replying, made another 
effort to withdraw his arm from the grasp 
of Osmond, but which a sudden faintness 
that came over him rendered unavailing. 
Osmond, perceiving him change colour 
and stagger, hastily supported him to a 
couch. 

'' For Heaven's sake, my dear fellow/* 
he eagerly demanded, '' what is the mat- 
ter?'' 

Delacour, without speaking, glanced at 
his wounded arm, and with a sensation of 
horror, Osmond beheld the scarf which 
supported it deluged in blood, occasioned 
by the bursting open of his wound, in con- 
sequence of the agitation he had experi- 
enced. 

Osmond was hastening to procure him 
assistance, when he stopt him, to desire he 
would only ring for his servant, whose at- 
tendance.

tendance, he added, %vas all that was re- 
quisite. 

Osmond obeyed. As soon as the arm of 
Delacour was bound up, and a glass of 
w^ine administered to him by the hand of 
Osmond, whose attentions appeared to 
have an effect upon him, he with difficulty 
avoided acknowledging, he again moved 
tow^ards the door, for the purpose of quit- 
ting the room. 

'''Delacour, ere you retire, will you not 
tell me whether I may not hope to see 
yo.u again t" said Osmond, following him. 
" I mean to quit this place almost im- 
mediately,** replied Delacour. 

''^ Indeed ! then 'tis probable we shall 
not meet again, at least for a long, long 
period. Well â€” but,** with a deep sigh, 
*' 'tis our lot to suffer in this life â€” ** then 
almost involuntarily tendering his hand, 
" Delacour, will you not bid me fare- 
well ?** 

*' Oh, Osmond !** grasping his offered 
hand, " why this ? â€” You add to the pain 

I already 



THE DISCARDED SON. 265 

I already labour under, by thus persisting 
to be kind â€” if you regard me^ let us part 
now." 

'' Adieu then V* cried Osmond â€” '' May 
Heaven bless you, and health and happi- 
ness be your'sl" 

'' 'Th a good wish/* said Delacour, 
evidently struggling with his feelings, "and 
I will echo it. Osmond, notwithstanding 
what has happened â€” what I have said, trust 
me, I shall ever rejoice at hearing of your 
welfare; and not only of your's, but (for 

I am not vindictive) of her's who '"* 

He paused for an instant in evident agony, 
and then proceededâ€”'' Yes, tiiough she 
has blasted my hopes of happiness, may 
her's never perish â€” may she never, never 
experience a pang similar to that she has 
made me feel ! Osmond, farewell ! if we 
can ever meet again without pain, I shall 
not regret the circumstance;'' then drop- 
ping his hand, he quitted the room. 

" Oh, never,'* sighed Osmond to him-

in all probability, now met for the last 
time. Oh;, Delacour ! inestimable friend! 
thouj whom with truth I may say, I have 
w^orn in my heart's core â€” aye, in my heart 
of hearts, what can console me for the loss 
of thy society â€” thy friendship !" 

As soon as the violence of his emotions 
had a little subsided, he left the apartment, 
for the purpose of repairing to the prison 
of his father. In the hall he encountered 
Mactalla. 

'' Ah, Signor!" exclaimed he, in his 
usual manner, "^ or Sir, as in future I shall 
style you, since wx are now on British 
ground, I am glad I have met you, for 
there is the real Signor, Signor Barbarino, 
fretting and foaming to see you." 

" It is not in my power to wait on him 
at present ; I therefore desire he may not 
know of my being here." 

Mactalla looked earnestly at his master 
for a minute without speaking, then sud- 
denly turning on his heel, he darted to a 

door 



TilE DISCARDED SON. 265 

door at the side of the hall, and throwing 
it open â€” '' Sign or Barbarino â€” Signor Bar- 
barino!" he exclaimed, to the utter amaze- 
ment as well as displeasure of Osmond, 
w^ho had never before known him to act 
in any other than the most submissive man- 
ner^ '' here is my master." 

Osmond, in a frame of mind that could 
not permit him. to brook trifling, was un- 
able to suppress the anger and indignation 
this direct disobedience to his orders ex- 
cited. 

" How dare you. Sir," cried he, darting 
a furious glance at JMactaHa, '' act in such 
a maiwier ?" 

"' Nay, pray don't chide him/' said Sig- 
nor Barbarino, who on Osmond's being 
announced, had approached the door, and 
now laid his hand on his arm ; " what he 
has done has been in compliance with my 
wishes; let him not, therefore, suffer for 
his good-natured anxiety to oblige me." 

" If it was in my power^ Sir," cried Os- 
mond, but still in a ruffled voice, '' to de-

vote any time to you at present, I should 
not be angry with him for the manner in 
â– which he has acted ; but I am at this junc- 
ture so particularly engaged, that it is not 
possible for me to do no." 

'' I am sorry to hear that/' returned 
Signor Barbarino, '' for I hoped to have 
had your company this day at least; but 
indulge me with a few minutes conversa- 
tion." 

Osmond reluctantly consented, and en- 
tering the parlour^ the old gentleman closed 
the door. 

" I have already been so fortunate," 
continued he, " as to discover the Xriends 
I came hither in quest of; and not having 
forgot to mention you in the course of 
the conversation I have had with them, re- 
lative to recent events, their anxiety for 
an introduction to you is so great, that I 
shall feel myself much mortified if not 
able to gratify them, by prevailing on you 
to spend the day with us/* 

'' For the favourable report which has 

given 



THE DISCAPxDED SON. 267 

given birth to the anxiety you speak of, 
accept my acknowledgments^ Sir/* said 
Osmond; '''but underierving should I be 
of your favourable sentiments^ ( as I am con- 
fident you would yourself con fesS;, did you 
know how^ I am situated at this moment,) 
"were I to comply with your present wishes." 
" Whvj vou are not in any trouble, I 
hope?" demanded the old gentleman, fix- 
ing-^ls still penetrating eyes on the coLinÂ« 
tenance of Osmond. 

Osmond involuntarily shook his head. 
'' Am I to understand/' rejoined Signor 
Barbarino, " that you have been disap- 
pointed with regard to the situation in 
which you expected to find your family .^'* 
Again a melancholy shake of the head 
was Osmond's only reply. 

" Ah ! I perceive you have/' resumed 
Signor Barbarino â€” "Trust me, I sincerely 

sympathize with you ; but '* and he 

paused for a moment, "^ yielding to de- 
jection can do no good; therefore, let 
me conjure you, my dear young friend, 
N 2 to 



268 THE DISCARDED SON. 

to exert yourself, be the trial you have 
just met with what it may, since fortitude 
under affliction is not only a proof of re- 
signation to the will of the Supreme, ( with- 
out whose divine permission no evil, we are 
taught to believe, can befal us, ) but also 
one of the best we can give of undei-standing; 
it being a superlative folly, every one must 
allow, to complain of what is inevitable; 
for, as the sparks fly upward, so is man, 
sooner or later, destined to suffer." 

Osmond made no reply to this speech, 
or as he considered it at the moment, com- 
mon-place harangue ; but whilst listening 
to it, the following beautiful lines of Shake- 
speare recurred to his recollection : â€” â€¢ 

'* 'Tis all men's office to speak patience 
To those that wring under the load of sorrow ; 
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency 
To be so moral, when he shall endure 
The like himself." 

^' I hope I shall be able to profit by your 
counsel, Sir," said he, on the old genile- 

man's

man's pausing â€” '' And now/' makings as 
he spokCj a movement towards the door^ 
** I must bid you adieu for the present/' 

" Well if you must go, you must," 
cried Signer Barbarino; '' but not that way, 
if yon please/' beckoning him from the 
door towards which he had gone, to ano- 
ther on the opposite side of the room^ and 
which, as he spoke, he ?AXVig open. Os- 
mond involuntarily glanced vvitliin the 
apartment thus displayed to his viesv ; but 
scarcely had he done so, ere he started back 
in unutterable amazement, with a most a 
doubt of his being awake â€” almost a belief of 
his eyes having deceived him- a belief that 
perhaps the reader will not be surprise^^ a't 
his being inclined to vield to, Vvhen in- 
formed that they rested on his parents and 
his sister.

owing, and during which, with truth it 
might be said,

""Am I really awake?" he demanded, 
'^ or do my senses deceive me ?" 

*' Oh, my 55on \" now burst from the 
labouring bosom of Mnnro, as he advanced 
from the arm of the sofa, against which 
he had been leaning, and on which his 
wife and daughter, tremblin": with as^ita- 
tion, were seated. 

Osmond heard no more â€” He rushed for- 
ward into the extended arms of his father 
' â€” Repassed from them into his mother's 
and sister's. 

" Oh, moment of ecrtacy !" cried Munro, 
as he beheld their mingling tears of joy, 
his own dropping at the sight, and his still 
fine countenance beaming with the grati- 
tude with which his h'^nrt v/as filled to 
Heaven â€” *' Oh, moment of ecstacy !" he 
repeated, on beholding his son improved 
in every grace, in figure, in feature, in 
manly beauty, what he already knew he 
was in disposition and accomplishments, 
namely, all that the fondest, proudest fa-

compence me for past sufiferings !'* 

â€¢* But teil me, tell me/' said Osmond^ 
in the scarce audible voice of strong emo- 
tion, and suddenly disengaging himself 
from the embraces of his mother and sister, 
'*^ tell me/V glancing from his father at 
Signor Barbarino, '^ hew â€” by what means 
did that most benevolent of men, for \o

" Ask nature,*' replied Signor Barbarino, 
in an emphatic voice, and laying his hand 
on his bosom, while tears rolled dov^n his 
furrowed cheeks. 

'^Nature!'' repeated Osmond, with en- 
creasing emotion, and again a wildness in 
his looks, which were now entirely bent 
on the old gentleman â€” " ilre you then 
connected with us ?'' 

" By the title of father,*' returned Sig- 
nor Barbarino, approaching Mrs. Munro,

I came hither to seek, the friends^ the re- 
latives with whom I hope to pass the rem- 
nant of my days. My sorrowing and re- 
pentant spirit has already been soothed by 
their kindness and forgiveness ; and could 
I hope that the prejudice which past trans- 
actions must have inspired you with agaivist

^' He must have a malignant disposition 
indeed/' cried Osmond, with all his wonted 
animation, '' wiiom repentance and atone- 
ment cannot soften â€” The forgiving parent

" Oh ! thou," cried Signor Barbarino, 
or as we shall in future style him, Don 
Alphonso de Xercs, (his real name,) his 
eyes uplifted towards Heaven, '' who by 
permitting me to enjoy this happiness^ 
hast given me to hope my repentance is 
accepted by ihee, for ever bless and pros-

Osmond â€” '' By actions also," he con- 
tinued, '' will I endeavour to prove the 
sincerity of my regard for you â€” Hence- 
forward " 

" O, my dear Sir," interrupted Osmond 
impatiently, and grasping his hand, " in 
rescuing those I love from misery â€” in giv- 
ing me the power," his thoughts suddenly 
reverting to Bela-cour, '^ of saving the 
noblest heart that Heaven ever enshrined 
within a human breast, from breaking, you

transport of joy he exclaimed;, '' is it

nized myself by inflicting on you !"

'* Last scene of all. 
That ends this strange eventful history." 

SHAKESrfiARi;. 



HILST Osmond was answering the 
eager inquiries which his declaration rela- 
tive to Delacour excited, himself restless^ 
wretched^ and impatient, ordered a, chaise 
to be got ready to take him from Dâ€” ^ â€” . 
Some time elapsed ere this order was obeyed^, 
and just as he was on the point of stepping 
into h, an old gentleman advanced from 
the inn, and entreated to be favoured with, 
tlie vacant seat, having, he said, vainly tried 
N 6 throughout 



976 THE DISCARDED SON. 

throughout the neiahbourhood to procure 
another for himself, and being under an 
indispensible engagement to set out for 
London imn^.ediately. 

In the present slate of his mind, Dela- 
cour could ill brook the thoughts of a 
corn |}an ion ; he therefore hesitated a few 
minutes ere he replied to this entreaty, 
when the natural benevolence of his dis- 
position getting the better of him^ he as- 
sented. 

More^ however, he could not prevail 
on himself to clo. As the carriage rolled 
off he informed the stranger he must ex- 
cuse his not entering into conversation, 
being too indisposed at the moment to be 
equal to any exertion ; then closing his 
eyes, he leant back in a corner of it, and 
resigned himself to the agonizing reflec- 
tions then prevailin X in his mind. 

Absorbed in these, he neither remarked 
the length of way they travelled without 
stopping, nor the gradual approach of 
night, till roused from his reverie^ by be- 
ing 



THE DISCAKDED SOX/ 277 

ing asked by the stranger whethei" he would 
not alight; upon which starring as if from 
a clrearn^ he looked about him, and found 
the chaise before a house, which a faint 
ray of light streaming from a window 
rendered just visible. 

" This is the stage at which we are to 
put up for the night/' snid the old gentle- 
man ; ''we have had a lono sitting-^ and 'tis 
time now that V7e should have some re- 
freshment." 

Delacour, without making any reply to 
this observation, mechanically ali2;hted, 
and followed him into the house. They 
were u>;hered into a neat parlour, well 
lighted, and v/here a cheerful fire sent forth 
an animating blaze. 

'' This is comfortable indeed," cried the 
old gentleman, rubbing his hands with an 
air that proclaimed his really thinking so. 
''All v/e now want is a good supper â€” 
prav. Sir, may I ask what you would like 
to have?"^ 

'' You would oblige me^, Sir,*' returned 
5 Delacoufj 



278 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Delaroiir, sowt^w'iat impat'rntly, " by not 
consultiiig me on the subject ; order what 
you please^ and trust me I shall be satis- 
fied/' 

" Well, Sir, I sbaT dio as you wish," 
slightly bownng, and ringing the bell. 

Delacour, pa< ing' the room with disor- 
dered steps, and folded arms, heeded not 
who obeyed this siimmons, till again ad- 
dressed by the old o-f-ntJe'Tian. 

"For a minute. Sir," said he, ^' may I 
request yoiir attention ?" 

Angry at being, as he conceived, teazed, 
Delacour paused, and was on the point of 
saying he must excuse his sitting down fo 
supper with him, when the faculty of speech 
was for an instant suspended, by the object 
that met his gaze as he turned towards 
him. 

Elizabeth, pale, trembling, and evidently 
ao^itated to a degree that rendered her 
scarcely able to support herself, stood 
leaning against the side of the fireplace. 
'' Gracious Reavcn!" at length he ex- 
claim ed^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. ^79 

claimed, but still reo^ardino' her with wild- 
ness, '' do not my senses deceive me! do 
I see aright, or has my imagination, dis- 
ordered by trouble, raised up this vision^ 
to add to my tortures !" 

Elizabeth, with a faint smile, but without 
speaking, extended her hand to him, and 
the old gentleman instantly vanished from 
the room. 

Instead of acceptino^ her proffered hand, 
however, Delacour involuntarily retreated 
a few paces further from her. 

" Elizabeth," he cried, a^ter regarding 
her for another minute in silence, and with 
still greater wildness, '' explain the mean- 
ing of all this! Why, why do I see you 
here? â€” why with that countenance, after 
what has happened ? Surely it is not pos- 
sible you could wish to witness the anguish 
you have inflicted ?'*^ 

" Oh, Delacour !" naw burst from the 
quivering lips of Elizabeth ; then after a 
momentary pause, ^^ you will soon be 

convinced

ccnvlnred that I merit no reproaches from 
you â€” no doinbt of my tenderness: yes, 
when you learn that the hand you once 
thought worth your acceptance^ is still at 
my own disp^osal /' 

^' Not marrie^J !" interrupted Delacour, 
eagerlv approaching her.then again involun- 
tarily recoiling with a look of incredulity â€” 
'' Oh, Elizabeth ! after what I heard " 

'' I am still, notwithstanding, yoiir's," 
she returned, with quickness, \\\â‚¬i pale- 
ness of her cheek giving place Xo a glow- 
ing blushâ€” '^ That â€” that is '' hesi- 
tating a little, and vrith something like 
a smile of archness, ^^ provided I have no 
reason to believe you do not wish me to 
be so/' 

" Wish !" repeated Delacour with vehe-- 
mence, and no longer attempting to resist 
the impulse of his feelings â€” '' Wish V 
snatching her to his heart, and straining 
her t(> it some minutes in silence â€” '^ Lei 
this transport tell you vvhat I wish. But 

am 



THE DISCARDED SON. 281 

am I indeed to believe my present hap- 
piness real ?â€” am I indeed to believe 
you single, and still inclined to render 
me the most blest of men ? Nay, dearest 
Elizabeth/' observing her countenance 
lower a little at these ^vords, '' pardon me. 
Only reflect on the sudden transition I have 
experienced from despair to bope, and 
you will not â€” cannot, I am certain, Vv'on- 
der that I should doubt the reality of the 
change â€” IIow, how, if it be real, can I re- 
concile to mvself the conduct of your bro- 
ther â€” the cruel â€” the agonizing deception 
he practised on me?" 

" He is at hand, to account for that 
himself," replied Elizabeth ; " and when 
you have heard him, you will, I am ron- 
vincerl, acknovsledLve that instead of being 
a cruel, it was a kind one/' 

Ere Delacour conld give utterance to 
x\\e impatience he felt \o see Osmond, for 
i\\Q purpose of receiving from him this de- 
sired explanation, the door opened, and 

Osmond 



S89 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Osmond ir^ade his appearance, his counte- 
nance beaming with the transports of his 
soul. 

'' Oh, Delacour I*' hastily advancing to- 
wards him, and eagerly taking his hand, 
he exclaimed, '' as I shared in your sor- 
row, so do I now participate in your joy. 
In again having the happiness of looking 
forward to being connected with you by 
other ties than these of friendship, ! find 
myself rercrnpensed for many a s^nd and 
agonizing hour." 

Then entreating the greatly agitated 
Delacour to endeavour to compose him- 
self, he bnefly related the circumstances 
already knovv'n Xo the reader, and which, 
as Elizabeth had predicted, Delacour could 
not hear without acknowledging that his 
conduct towards him had been the very 
reverse of unkind. 

" And will Don Alphonso, indeed," 
cried Delacour, in an anxious tone, and 
with an emotion that recalled to his cheek 

- the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 283 

the colour which ilhiess and suiTcring had 
banished from it, " \sl\l he indeed be gene- 
rous enough to wave the pretensions he 
has so just a right to form for my Eliza- 
beth, in favour of a person who has so 
little of this world's goods to endow her 
with ?'' 

'' Oh, wliat a question !" cried Osmond. 
'' Vvhere would be his honour, his justice, 
his generosity, if he hesitated for an in- 
stant fulfilling her ffither's promise of giv- 
ing her to youâ€” you who so disinterestedly 
selected her for your bride, when there 
was but little prospect of fortune ever 
miling on her. Oh, Delacour! trust me, 
Don Alphonso â€” But his actions will better 
speak for him than I can. Let the know- 
ledge of his having been your companion 
hither, and this being Hcathwood, dissi- 
pate all your doubts, if indeed you have 
any on the subject. In pursuance of his 
wishes to carry into eiTect a little plot he 
contrived as soon as he learnt you were at

284 THE DISCARDED SON. 

D â€¢, for the purpose of heightening 

your surprise, I resisted my own to ter- 
minate immediately your nnhappiness/* 

'' Don Alphonso my companion from 
D /' cried DelaCour^ in accents indi- 
cative of the greatest surprise, *' and this 
Heathwood !" then after the pause of a 
minute; â€” '' Well, I acknc ivledge/' with all 
his wonted animation, '' my happiness 
is more perfect for hnvjng been a little 
delayed." 

Munro, his wife, and Don Aiphonsa, 
110V7 entered ; the scene that ensued may 
easier be conceived than described â€” suffice 
it to say, that on the transported Dela- 
cour's turning to the latter, after having 
paid his compliments to the two former, the 
old gentleman taking him by the hand and 
affectionately pressing it â€” " Your pre- 
sence,'' said he, " was all that w^as wanting 
to render compleat the happiness of this 
day. A few hours ago, and I imagined I 
could not think more highly of the sacri- 
fice 



THE DISCARDED SON. 285 

fice my granddaughter intended making 
for her parents than I then did ; but since 
I have seen you, I won't say/' smih'ng a 
little archly, '' conversed with you, I find 
her merit in agreeing to that sacrifice was 
even greater than I at first thought/* 

Delacour attempted but in vain to make 
a suitable reply to this speech, so full was 
his heart at the moment ; his looks, how- 
ever, were eloquently expressive of what 
he felt. 

As soon as composure was in some de- 
gree restored to the party, they adjourned 
to another room, where an elegant sup- 
per was laid out for them. On the cloth 
being removed, and the servants with- 
er, awn, a general explanation took place. 

After having for a considerable period, 
but in vain, endeavoured to derive happi- 
ness from the gratification of his vanity, 
and stifle, in the hurry of dissipation, the 
voice of nature and of conscience, which 
incessantly reproached him for his conduct 
to his daughter â€” a daughter who never but 

in 



286 THE DISCARDED SON. 

in one instance had given him the smallest 
cause for displeasure, a lingering fit of ill- 
ness brought him, Don Alphonso proceed- 
ed to inform his attentive auditoi-s, to a 
proper way -of thinking. 

'' li was then/' he continued, '^ when 
stretched as I imagined upon a death-bed, 
that reflection regained its wonted empire 
over me, and in the bitterness of the re- 
morse it excited, I vowed to make all the 
atonement in my power for my past con- 
duct. 

'' This vow, as soon as I recovered, 
would have occasioned me to set out for 
this kingdom; but that a very considerable 
part of my property was vested in the 
hands of a person in Naples/' 

He then entered into a minute detail of 
the adventure which brought him and Os- 
mond acquainted, and of the manner in 
which he had discovered his being his 
grandson. 

" Nothing but a fear of the knowledge/* 
proceeded Don Alphonso, '' of our con- 
nexion 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2S7 

nexion causing such a restraint in his 
manner, as might prevent my ascertain- 
ing whether or not his disposition was 
what appearances proclaimed it to be, and 
which 1 was most anxious for doing, with- 
held me from discovering myself to him^ 
on learning who he was. 

'' My solicitude on this head satisfied, 
he should then have known our affinity ; 
but that, like a whimsical old man, per- 
haps you will say, I became desirous of 
heightening, as much as possible, the sur- 
prise 1 was aware the communication of 
it w^ould give him, and accordingly de- 
cided on delaying it till my arrival here ; 
but with difficulty did I persevere in this 
resolution â€” with difficulty forbear fall- 
ing on his neck, and calling him my 
son, when, as was often the case, in the 
course of conversation, he mentioned his 
parents, and by half-uttered sentences 
gave me too clearly to understand the 
anxiety with which his heart was racked 
about them. 

*^ The 



288 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'^ The agitation which I experienced on 

alighting at this place, in consequence of 
knowing I was then in the vicinity of those 
whom I so longed^ yet dreaded, to see, 
from the prejudice, I naturally supposed 
they entertained against me, was so vio- 
lent, as to induce me to determine on 
postponing the disxovery I had to make 
till this morning, when I trusted I should 
be sufficiently composed to set about it 
in the manner I wished ; and accordingly, 
therefore, suffered the companion of my 
journey to leave me, without giving him 
a hint of^ the secret with which my bosom 
laboured. 

'' Just as I w^as on the point of rising 
this morning, his merry valet (but with a 
countenance at the moment that gave him 
no right to the appellation) entered my 
chamber. Hastily, and with alarm, T en- 
quired what had happened to make him 
look so pale and melancholy ; and he in 
reply very briefly informed me, that he 
had just learnt from a person in the inn, 

with 



TilE DISCARDED SOX. 2S9 

with whom he had entered into conversa- 
tion about the family of his master, of 
your being," glancing at Munro> ^'^ in 
confinement at D , for debt. 

" I will nor,'' continued Don Alphonso, 
" dwell on the scene that followed this in- 
formation ; suffice it to say, ti>at I lost 
no time in discovering mvseif to the honest 
and warm-hearted J^jactalla, and setting 
about the enlargement of those he was so 
interested about." 

In reply to Osmond's enquiry, as to the 
manner in which this was accounted for 
to them, Don Alphonso said that he had 
sent a letter to his father, merely stating 
that his release was efiected by the inter- 
position of an old Spanish friend of Mrs. 
Munro's, who was then impatiently wait- 
ing at the inn to embrace her and her 
family. 

" On the scene that here again took 
place when we met, I shall no more dwell,** 
cried Don Alphonso, '' than I did on the 
one that preceded it. From your own 

VOL, V, f) feelings/* 



290 THE DISCARDED SON. 

feelings," and he looked alternately, and 
with almost equal affection, at Osmond 
and Delacour, '' ye can well, 1 am con- 
vinced, picture to yourselves what that 
must have been, which took place between 
a penitent father and a forgiving daughter 
- â€” a long separated parent and child. Oh, 
at the moment in which my enfeebled arms 
again enfolded her â€” in which I again strain- 
ed her to the heart from which I had so 
long strove to banish her, I felt compen- 
sated for years of suffering ; yet at the 
same time convinced that I merited not 
only these, but years of suffering to come^ 
for having for such a period remained in- 
exorable to the voice of nature : but the 
Almighty is more merciful to man, than 
man is often to his kindred being â€” in his 
sight the tear of repentance drops not in 
vain, nor is the sighing of the contrite 
heart disregarded. 

'' At the very moment in which you 
made your appearance," resumed Don Al- 
phonso, after a short pause addressing his 

grandson. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 291 

grandson, '' we were on the point of dis-. 
patching a messenger to Heathwood in 
quest of you, some little alarm being ex- 
cited in our minds by your delay in join- 
ing us.'* 

As soon as the emotions awakened by 
the above narrative v;ere a little cahned, 
Osmond gave a brief account of all that 
had occurred in his recent visit to the 
scenes of his youth ; and Delacour then 
satisfied the curiosity of his friends, by 
acquainting them with the circumstance 
that occasioned his returning home so much 
sooner than was expected. 

Munro also stated, that, for being able 
to accommodate them so immediately at 
Heathwood, he was indebted to Farmer 
Stubbs, who, as soon as the transports he 
experienced at the happy revolution in 
his affairs had a little subsided, busied 
himself to get it in '^cder for their recep- 
tion. 

The period fixed for the nuptials of Eliza- 
beth with Sir James was yet four days oflf^ 
o 9 and 



592 TlIE DISCARDED SON. 

dnd till its arrival it was decided, though 
not without some deliberation, and many 
arguments pro and con, that in order to 
render still more severe his merited disap- 
pointment, and that of his base coadjutor, 
DO intelligence of what had passed should 
be dispatched to Glengar}^ from which, 
owing to the request of Elizabeth, they 
did not till then expect to see any one. 

'' But since the wedding-day of my 
granddaughter has been fixed," said Don 
x\Jphonso, with an air of liveliness that 
proclaimed the restoration of his happiness, 
'' I am determined she shall not be disap- 
pointed of being a bride at the expected 
time â€” that is, provided Captain Delacour 
has no objection to becoming the substi- 
tute of Sir James on this occasion, nor she 
to permitting him." 

'' I see, Sir," cried the animated Dela- 
cour, with a look of grateful transport, 
" you are determined on adding to the obli- 
gations I already owe you." 

'^ Weil, I perceive you have no objec- 
tion 



THE DISCARDED SON. 29'S 

tion to my proposal^" resumed Don AI~ 
phonso â€” '' Miss Munro/' turning still 
more jocosely to his granddaughter^ ^' it 
now rests with you to say, whether or not 
it shall be carried into effect.'^ 

Elizabeth blushed^ and bent her eyes. 

'' Silent !" rejoined her grandfather â€” - 
'^ Well, Captain Delacour, I have heard it 
said, that when ladies are so, without re- 
gard to certain questions^ there is no 
cause for despair/' 

''I trust not, in the present instance, 
vSir,". cried Dclacour, " since I cnndidly 
confess, after being so near losing my 
Elizabeth, 1 shall not be able to divest my- 
self of doubts and apprehensions, till I 
know she is positively mine ; still, not- 
withstanding this, I know not, invalid as I 
am," and he glanced at his wounded arm, 
'' how to " 

*' Plead your own cause/' interrupted 
Osmond. 

'' Exactly so," said Delacour, '' and 

therefore must entreat " 

o 3 '' Others 



294 THE DISCARDED SON. 

*' Others to do so for you, since too 
modest a fellow/' smiling a little ironically^ 
'' to be able to do so yourself/* 

" V/ell, I am much mistaken/' said 
Munro^ directing his looks to Delacour, 
" if the very circumstance that causes you 
to hesitate in urging your wishes, is not 
one more likely than any other to ob-' 
tain their accomplishment â€” I do not know 
Elizabeth, if she does not prefer acquiring 
the privilege of watching over the health 
of her lover, to the indulgence of those 
-punctilios dictated by maiden coyness/' 

'' You transport me by iYie supposition. 
Sir," criell Delacour, with a glow upon his 
cheek, that more forcibly than even words 
could have done, proclaiined his feelings 
at the moment. 

*' And to do so, still more/' said Os- 
mond, " I will speak for Elizabeth, and 
say, that she acquiesces in xyxQ wishes of 
all here present/' 

The scene closed by its being positively 
settled, that on the day which was to have 

given 



THE DISCARDED SON. 295 

given her to Sir JameS;, she and Delacoiir 
should be united. 

The intervening period was chiefly de- 
voted by the family to making arrange- 
ments relative to their future mode of 
living. The fortune of Don Alphonso was 
noble^ and it was decided that a residence 
suitable to it should immediately be 
sought for in some pleasant part of the 
kingdom ; and that on obtaining it, Heath- 
wood should be given up to Farmer Stubbs, 
as a reward for his fidelity and affection to 
its present possessors. 

Of all his family, Osmond now only 
breathed the sigh of regret ; neither pre- 
sent gaiety, nor anticipations of future 
promised splendour, nor expected change 
of scene, could for a moment detach his 
thoughts from the fair Cordelia, or weaken 
the anguish with which he dwelt on the 
disappointment of his hopes concerning 
her. Almost persuaded that to subdu^^ his 
passion was beyond his power, there were 
4 times 



'-'Ji> TU>: DISCARDED SON. 

times when he had it in contemplation to 
make his father acquainted with it, and en- 
treat his interference with Lord O'Sinister ; 
still, however, he was withheld from this 
measure, by the consideration of the ran- 
corous hatred his Lordship bore him, the 
little likelihood, therefore, there was of his 
being prevailed on to acquiesce in his 
wishes, and the probability there was of 
exciting the resentment and indignation 
of his father, should he express an incli- 
nation to be allied to a man, who had 
meditated the dishonour of his family. 

Relative to the adventures on the conti- 
nent, in which he had been engaged with 
Lord O'Sinister, he meant to maintain an 
inilexible silence, lest, otherwise, if he 
touched upon them, he should be unable 
to conceal the feelings v/ith which they 
had inspired him, and by the reveal- 
ing of which, the full enormity of his 
Lordship's conduct towards him must be 
betrayed, which the consideration of his 

being 



THE DISCARDED SON. 297 

being the father of Cordelia rendered 
him most unwilling it should be ; as also 
the, at present, unhappy state of his own 
mind. 

Too much disturbed at this crisis, to be 
able at all times to participate, as he 
wished, in the happiness of his friends, he 
contrived pretexts for withdrawing him- 
self from them, and plunging amidst the 

** Glimmering shades and sympathetic glooms" 

of Firgrove, where he could uninterrupt- 
ediy dwell on the idea so precious to his 
heart : but even the melancholy pleasure 
he derived from cherishing this idea w^as- 
not always unalloyed. Convinced that in 
indulging a passion he had every reason to 
believe hopeless, he was guilty of a weak- 
ness highly censurable, the reproaches he 
incessantly, as well as involuntarily, made 
himself on the subject, embittered the de- 
light he had in reflecting on-. Cordelia : 
still, however^, notwithstanding these re- 
o 5 proaches^ 



298 THE DISCARDED SON. 

proaches, he could not, or rather he would 
not, make an effort to tear her from his 
heart. 

The morning previous to that fixed for 
their marriage, he was surprised by his 
sifter and Delacour, in one of his lonely 
haunts at Firgrove. 

*' Upon my word," cried Delacour, the 
moment he perceived him, shaking his 
head, and affecting a grave look^ " this 
looks ruSj'icious \" 

" Vv'hat ?" demanded Osmond hastily. 

'' Why, thi^ pas'ion f'cr solitude. Come, 
my dear fellow, make your sister and me 
your confidants, for thouj^h no longer ex- 
periencin Â»; the par ,^s of --opeless love, we 
can nevertheless sympathise with those wiio 
do/' 

'' 1 make no doubt you can ; but,'* a 
little pettishly, 'â€¢ notwithstanding, I shall 
not tax either the sympathy of one or the 
other.'* 

"^ Well, what is now j ejected mav yet 
perhaps be solicited, for though you have

not all the marks of Rosalind's uncle upon 
you, 'svhereby to know a man in love, yet 
still I cannot help suspecting that the little 
blind deity has not been entirely idle with 
regard to you/' 

'' Indeed ! and pray may I ask what has 
given birth to such a suspicion ?" 

" Why, first, your being at a time of life 
when 'tis natural for a man to be in loveâ€” 
secondly^ certain little absences in your 
manner- â€” and thirdly, your evident pre- 
dilection for solitude. I shall soon begin 
to examine these shades narrowlv, in ex- 
pectation of finding *' odes upon haw- 
thorns, and elegies on brambles," deifying 
the name of some rural fair one â€” But come," 
changing his tone, ^' to drop a siibject 
which I see does not please you, know that 
your sister's motive and mine for coming 
in quest of you, was to communicate some 
intelligence which I have received by ex- 
press from my aunt â€” It will not, perhaps, 
surprise you to hear that Lord O'Sinister

is dead ; but it will^ perhaps, to hear he 
died penitent/* 

'' Dead !â€” Lord O'Sinister dead !" cried 
Osmond; in the greatest emotion^ and in- 
voluntarily recoiling a few paces â€” *^ And 

his " 

" His family/* resumed Delacour, on 
his pausing, '' have already returned from 
the continent â€” they are now with my 
aunt/' 

*' And does she mention any particulars 
concerning them?'' asked^ or rather fal- 
tered out Osmond. 

"^ A few. Amongst other things, she 
informs me the death of Lord O'Sinister 
was owing to an affair of honour with 

Colonel C , the officer whose wife he 

seduced some years ago, and who, on dis- 
covering the injury he had received from 
him, took a vow never to rest till he had 
revenged the same. To tnis vow was ow- 
ing his Lordship's precipitate departure 
from England, and his travelling incog oa

the continent, under false pretexts; but^ 
notwithstanding the various stratagems he 
had recourse to for eluding it^ vengeance at 

length overtook him; Colonel C traced 

him to Naples, notwithstanding the circui- 
tous way in which he pursued his journey 
thither, his frequent stoppages on the road, 
and travelling under a fictitious name. At 
the first shot, his avenging hand laid him 
low. The wound was immediately pro- 
nounced mortal ; nevertheless the unhappy 
man lived two davs after receiving it, du- 
ring which he manifested the greatest con- 
trition for his past offences, and endeavour- 
ed to prove the sincerity of this contrition^ 
by the manner in which he arranged his 
afTairs. Amongst those to whom he con- 
ceived reparation, due from him I was rank- 
ed â€” he bequeathed me a sum adequate to 
what he was the means of my father's losing ; 
but which bequest, I trust every one who 
knows me, will do me justice to believe, 
vas not requisite to obtain my forgiveness 

when 



302 THE DISCARDED SON. 

when I heard of his repentance ; for if re- 
pentance satisfies Heaven, as we are assured 
it does, how mnch more should it satisfy 
erring man! â€” But 1 am a bad hand at grave 
reflections, or sage remarks/' continued 
Delacour, laughing, as if at himself; '' suf- 
fice it;, therefore, to say, that to have heard 
of his Lordship's regret for his misdeeds^ 
would have been sufficient of itself to have 
made me obliterate them from my remem- 
brance/* 

'' Good God !" exclaimed Osmond to 
himself â€” " surely, surely if Lord O'Sinis- 
ter wished in his last moments to make re- 
paration to all whom he had injured, I 
could not have been forgotten by him/' 

This idea made him look earnestly in 
the countenance of Delacour; but to his 
infinite mortification he read nothing there^, 
calculated to confirm it, and his heart im- 
mediately sunk. 

Making an effort, however, to conceal 
what was passing iB his mind, he asked, with 

forced 



THE DISCARDED SON. 303 

forced composure, whether Lady 0*Sinis- 
ter and her daiij^hter were soon expected 
in the neighbourhood ? 

'' Yes/' said Delacour, with seeming 
carelessness^ tnrninor from Elizabeth, with 
whom he was conversing, *' the nuptials 
of Miss i.\thelstone are to be solemnized 
the '* 

" The nuptials of N5iss Athelstone I" with 
difficulty repeated Osmond, and changing 
colour. 

*' Yes, like your obedient servant, 
she is now on the very eve of matri- 
mony." 

" On the very eve of matrimony V* again 
repeated Osmond, staggering back a few 
paces, and catching hold of a tree for 
support. 

'^ The intelligence seems to affect you," 
said Delacour. 

" Ye â€” s, with surprise,"' stammered out 
Osmond: recollecting himself â€” " I â€” I can't 
help being a little surprised that her mar- 
riage should take plate so soon after the 
death of her father.**

504 THE DISCARDED SDK. 

'' 'TIs in pursuance of his wishes/' re- 
turned Delacour. '' He willed away her 
hand^ as I may say, in his last moments, 
and exacted a promise from her to fulfil 
the engagement he formed for her as soon 
as she arrived in England/' 

'' And pray, pray, may I ask/' said Os- 
mond, in a voice scarce articulate, and 
trembling between hope and fear, '* who, 
who *the person is to whom he has be- 
queathed so precious a gift?" 

'^ I really cannot tell you,'* answered Dela- 
cour; " but whoever he is, he is certainly 
an enviable being, for she is not only a. 
very fine, but a very amiable girl/' 

"And â€” and,'' still more earnestly, more 
anxiously, enquired the agitated Osmond, 
" is she perfectly satisfied with her father's 
election for her?" 

*' O, perfectly, I understand from my 
aunt. She says she is convinced it will be 
a love match on both sides." 

'' A love match !" repeated Osmond to 
himself; '' and but a few short weeks ago 

permitting 



THE DISeABDED SON. 305 

permitting me to hope I never could be 
forgotten â€” O woman ! woman !" striking 
his forehead, " false, deceitful woman \" 
then recollecting himself again, and now 
more anxious than ever, from a motive of 
pride, to conceal his unhappy attachment, 
he was precipitately quitting the spot/ 
when Delacour prevented him by catching" 
his arm. 

'' Nay, my dear fellow, you must not 
leave us," said he, '' for since so near that 
magnificent mansion,'' glancing at the Ilaii, 
which they were nov/ within ^\%\it of, *Mve 
mean to view the interior of It." 

" Excuse me," cried Osmond, endea* 
vouring to disengage his armâ€”'' Some 
other time â€” â€” " 

'' Indeed I cannot/' returned Delacour. 
*' If you persi&t in leaving us^ the suspicion 
I have just alluded to will not be weaken- 
ed, I assure you." 

*^ Well, lead on," said Osmond, endea^ 
vouring, but in vain, to smooth his ruflflcd 
brow, '' and I will follow you." 

They 



306 



THE DISCARDED SON. 



They accordingly proceeded to the 
house. On entering the hall, the house- 
keeper was summoned ; she knew Eliza- 
bethj and on conducting the party up 
stairs into a spacious gallery, left them, 
saying she was certain it must be more 
agreeable to them to view the apartments by 
themselves, than with her for their guide. 

The gallery in which she left them was 
lined with family portraits. Over these 
the eye of Osmond carelessly wandered, 
till at length it became fixed, by suddenly 
discovering the picture of Miss Athelstone, 
a highly-finished likeness, representing her 
in all the pride of youth and beauty. 

Osmond immediatelv became rooted to 
the spot. 

" What a heavenly portrait!" observed 
Elizabeth, as leaning on the arm of Deia- 
cour she also stopped to view it. '' Cer- 
tainly this must be some bright vision of 
his imagination, which the painter has here 
embodied, for I never saw any creature in 
real life, so exquisitely beautiful." 

'' You 



THE DISCARDED SON. 307 

'' You are mistaken, I assure you," cried 
Delacour â€” '' that is the portrait of Miss 
Athelstone, and when you and Osmond 
see her, I make no doubt you will concur 
with me in opinion, that the artist has not 
done her more than justice/' 

" More than justice 1'^ repeated Osmond 
emphatically, and again thrown off his 
guard, by the emotions this resemblance 
of the fair Cordelia awakened in his bosom 
â€” ''oh, how impossible for pen or pencil 
to do her justice! And yet so lovely is 
the portrait, that^ in the words of Shake- 
speare, I cannot forbear exclaiming â€” 

Â«' What demigod 

Hath come so near creation? move the e eyes, 
Or whether riding on the balls oi" mine. 
Seem they in motion ? Here aie sever'd lips 
Parted with sugar-breatii â€” so sweet a bar 
Should sunder such sweet friends ; here, in her h^vr^ 
The painter plays the spider, and bath wove* . 
A golden mesh t'entrap the i.earts of men. 
Faster than gnats in cobwebs : but her eyes !â€” 

How 



308 THE DISCARDED SON, 

How could he see to do them ? having made obc, 
Methinks it should have power to steal both his, 
And leave itself unfinish'd !" 



" Come, come/' cried Delacoiir, mov- 
ing forward with Elizabeth, '' you seem 
quite fascinated by that picture. If you 
take my advice, my dear fellow, you will 
gaze no longer on it, since the original is 
engaged.'* 

"I believe you are right," said Osmond, 
affecting to laugh, and tearing himself, 
but not without a Iin2:erin2: look, from the 
spot; 'Mo continue to do feiO any longer 
might perhaps be a-ttended with dangerous 
consequences." 

Delacour and Elizabeth turned into an 
apartment ofTthe gallery, Osmond followed 
their steps, and was advancing after them 
through it to an opposite door, at which 
they went out, when he became suddenly 
rivetted fo the floor, by beholding Lady 
O'Sinister and her daughter on a sofa, at 



THE DISCARDED SON. 309 

no great distance from the one by which 
he had entered. 

Surprise for an instant took from him 
the power of thinking, as well as of mov- 
ing. The plot which had been contrived 
to heighten that of Delacour, then recurred 
to his recollection, and, like him, he be- 
gan to think he had been deceived in the 
present instance. 

'' But should I be mistaken," he cried 
to himself, the flush of suddenly revived 
hope yielding to the paleness of apprehen- 
sion. 

Suspense was not endurable â€” his anxiety 
to terminate it restored him to the use of 
his faculties ; he eagerly approached the 
ladies, who had risen the moment they 
caught his eye. Lady O'Sinister's hand 
was extended to him ; he caught it, and 
raised it to his lips, his looks, however, at 
the same moment wandering towards her 
daughter, who half meeting, half shunning 
his glance^ prevented him alike from either

310 THE DISCARDED SON. 

hoping or despairing, and whose eyes at 
the moment, like 

** The dewy-star of evening, shone in tears." 

" I see/* said her Ladyship, in a voice 
which proclaimed her in no little emotion 
at the moment, " that your friend succeed- 
ed in imposing on you, relative to us." 

'' Imposing !" repeated Osmond â€” '' Oh 
Madam, am I then to discredit what he told 
me.J^" 

'' Why, not absolutely," returned Lady 
O'Sinister, hesitating a little, and half smil- 
ing, '' for he doubtless told you my daugh- 
ter was enjjao^ed." 

" He did/' said Osmond, in accents 
scarce articulate. 

. " Well, in telling you so, he only told 
you what was true, for she is engaged â€” 
Yes," after the pause, the agitating pause of 
a minute, during which her eyes were fixed 
upon the varying countenance of the trem- 
bling 



THE DISCARDED SON. 31 J 

bling Osmond, '' she is engaged â€” engaged 
to him whom I myself selected for her â€” to 
him whose modest worth, whose virtues, 
whose fortitude, render him deserving of 
her/' 

Then turning to her blushing daughter, 
she took her hand, and joining it with that 
of Osmond â€” " Take her, Munro," she con- 
tinued, pressing their united hands for an 
instant between her's â€” " In thus joining 
your hands, I fulfil the dying commands of 
my Lord, and accomplish my own wishes â€” 
May Heaven shower its choicest gifts upon 
you, and long continue you a blessing to 
others, as well as to each other.'' 

Then dropping their hands, she covered 
her face with her handkerchief, and hastily 
retired from the room. 

The transported Osmond continued for 
some time after she withdrew, in that state 
in which Bassanio described himself, on re- 
ceiving from the gentle Portia an assurance 
of being his. 

" Madam, 



312 THE DISCARDED SON, 

" Madam, you have bereft me of all wordâ€”* 
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins ; 
And there is such confusion in my powers. 
As after some oration fairly spoke 
By a beloved prince, there doth appear 
Among the buzzing pleased multitude ; 
Where every something, being blent together. 
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy 
Exprest, and not exprest." 

The scene that ensued between him and his 
fair mistress, we shall pass over in silence. 

After an hour had elapsed Lady O'Sinister 
returned^ and Miss Athelstone at her mo- 
tion withdrawing, she proceeded to ex- 
plain to Osmond some particulars she deem- 
ed it necessary he should know. 

ITer Lord, truly penitent in his last 
moments, she said, for all the injuries he 
had done him, as well as those he had me- 
ditated against his family^ hadj after giving 
his free consent to his union with his 
daughter, willed him half his fortune, in 
case he no longer washed for such an alli- 
ance. 

For 



THE- DISCARDED SON. 313 

For concealing himself from his know- 
ledge at Acerenza, and during the pe- 
rilous adventures that succeeded their de- 
parture thence, apprehension of his ha\ ing 
discovered his conduct towards his sister, 
was his motive; and for slandering him in 
such a way to the Duke D'Amalfi, as made 
that nobleman anxious to get rid of him, his 
dread oi^ \\h succeeding; in his efforts to dis- 
cover his dauohter, should he be allowed 
to remain in Naples. 

" And now/' added she, " this I trust is 
the last time his errors will ever be recalled 
to recollection ; the sincere contrition he 
Mt, and atonement he made for them, 
having, I humbly trust," expiated them in 
the sight of Heaven, and equally so I hope 
in the eyes of the world ; for^ as the Poet 
says â€” ' lie who by repentance is not satis- 
fied, is not of heaven or earth.' â€” I shall no 
logger dwell en the painful subject, than 
merely to observe, his fate afiibrds a strik- 
ing proof of the fatal consequences that 
result from letting passion have entire do-

minion over us. Had he early endeavoured 
to curb his unhappy propensities, he might 
tiovv, in all probability, have been in the 
full enjoyment oflife^ surrounded by ad- 
miring friends, and rejoicing in the pro- 
spect of his child's happiness." 

A flood of tears for a few moments im- 
peded the utterance of Lady O'Sinister. 
On recovering, she proceeded to inform 
the sympathizing Osmond that she had ar- 
rived the preqeding day at Firgrove, where, 
in consequence of an express she had sent 
to her, she was met by Mrs. Dunbar, her old 
and most intimate friend. â€” By her house- 
keeper, she added, she had been informed 
of all that had lately happened at Heath- 
wood, and by her had a private message 
delivered to Delacour and Osmond's father, 
announcing her arrival, and desiring to see 
them immediately. â€” " In this interview," 
she proceeded, '' I fully explained to your 
father all that was requisite for him to 
know ; and learning that your sister was 
to be married to-morrow, was induced to 

consent 



THE DISCARDED SON. 3 J 5 

consent to my Cordelia's becoming a bride 
at the same time." 

" Words are inadequate/' said the en- 
raptured Osmond, respectfully kissing her 
hand, '' to do justice to the gratitude with 
which your goodness, in this instance, as 
â€¢well as in every other, has inspired me; 
but it shall be my study io evince, by 
my actions, my sense of it. I know not, 
however, how I shall be able to forgive 
Delacour, for keeping me so long in ig- 
norance of the happiness tha-t was in store 
for me." 

'' Nay, it was not his fault, I assure you^ 
that you did not sooner learn it ; but my 
agitation was so great yesterday, I felt 
quite unequal to seeing you then." 

Her Ladyship then proceeded to inform 
him that her brother, Mr. Be^rscroft, had 
accompanied her to Scotland,' and that she 
had prevailed on Osmond's family to take 
up their reiidence with her at Firgrove, 
till they had succeeded in obtaining such 
a habitation as they now required. She 
p 2 completed 



316 THE DISCARDED SON. 

completed his joy, by further stafing, that 
just before her departure from Naples, she 
had the pleasure of meeting his Acerenza 
friends, happy as their virtues entitled 
them to be, and determined on visiting 
Great Britain the ensuing Spring, for the 
purpose of convincing him, neither time 
nor absence had occasioned any change in 
their sentiments for hirp. 

Lady O'Sinister's conference with him 
over^ she led the way to a magnificent sa- 
loon, where, besides his fair mistress, De- 
lacour and his sister, he found the rest of 
his friends from Heath wood, and Mr. 
Beerscroft. To this gentleman he was im- 
mediately introduced by her Ladyship, as 
his destined nephew ; after which he re- 
ceived the congratulations of all present 
on his unexpected happiness. 

An animated conversation then took 
place, till the party separated to dress for 
dinner. In the dressing-room appropri- 
ated to his use, O&mond found Mactalla 
impatiently expecting him. 

''By 



THE DISCARDED SON. S 17 

" By St. Benedict/' exclaimed he, in an 
exulting tone^ as he closed the door to 
prevent his being overheard, ^' one may 
welj say now it never rains but it pours ; 
who could have thought of such changes ! 
Poor sinner; but peace be to his soul; 
they say he died a true penitent, and so 
let him rest for me: and FiOW, your ho- 
nour, to let you know of a little surprise of 
my own." 

''Well, what was it?" asked Osmond, 
?s he began to busy himself about his toi- 
lette 

" Why nothing more or less than my 
popping upon little Bianca here." 

"Bianca I" repeated Osmond. 

*' Yes, the grand-daughter of the old 
man who sent us to the villa of the Duke 
D'Amalfi, the night you discovered Don 
Alphonso in the barn." 

'' O, now I recollect," said Osmond. 

" Well, your honour, the old man died 

shortly after that, and his death leaving 

poor little Bianca destitute, she was forced

to look out for a service. As good luck 
vroiiid have h. Miss Athelstone wanted a 
waiting-woman just at that time; and hear- 
ing of Bianca from a person belon-^ing to 
the villa to which his Lordship, her father, 
removed her from Naples, to be out of 
your way, she hired her, and has brought 
her over with her; and travelling has not 
by any means, I assure you, disagreed with 
her; she looks prettier than ever, and if 
your honour has no objection to having a 
married man in your service, I think I 
shall be tempted to try my fortune with 
her/* 

"By all means; if you really love the 
pretty Bianca, and think she returns your 
regard, and is v7orthy of possessing it, 
delay not asking â€¢ her hand; and assure 
yourself nothing in my power shall be 
wanting to contribute to your felicity. 
Providence has wrou9:iU a wonderful 
chai'ge in my situation, and the best way 
in which I can evince my gratitude for that 
change, is by endeavouring to promote 

the

the happiness of my fellow-creatures. I 
gladly embrace this opportunity of inform.- 
ing you, that your happiness is one of my 
first considerations. From the light in 
which your faithful services have made me 
regard you, I should always^ did I consult 
my own wishes^ desire to retain you with 
me; but if you think, when married, you 
can be happier in a residence of your own, 
have no hesitation in telling me, since 
whatever is most likely to contribute to 
your felicity, will ultimately be most 
pleasing to me." 

'^Happier elsewhere than with you!" 
cried Mactalla, in a broken voice, ''no, 
no, and if Miss Bianca is not content to re- 
main in her present situation, she may re- 
tain her present name for me/' 
- ^' Well, my good fellow, consult her on 
the subject ; and rely on it, let your deci- 
sion be what it may, you shall be rendered 
independant." 

From the affecting demonstrations of 

poor Mactalla*s gratitude he escaped as

soon as possible, and was speedily rejoined 
by the rest of the party. The remainder of 
the day was chiefiyspentin pleasing conver- 
sation^ and the following morning, at nine 
o'clock;, Miss Athelstone and Osmond, and 
Delacour and Elizabeth, were united in the 
chapel of Firgrove ; the former was given 
awav by her uncle, and the latter by her 
father. The double ceremony over. Lady 
O'Sinister, who, on this joyful Oceanian, 
had exchanged her robe of sable for a 
plain white one^ conducted by Mr Miin- 
ro, led the way to the apartment in which 
breakfast was laid out, and w^hich, from its 
beauty, was perfectly calculated for a nup- 
tial entertainment ; it was fitted up in imi- 
tation of the winter green-house mentioned 
in the Tatler, and of which the following is 
a description. 

The area was a hundred paces Ions;, fifty 
broad, and roof thi. ty i^cct high, i lie wall, 
toward the North, was of solid stone. On 
the South side, and at both the ends, the 
stone-work rose but three feet from the 

ground^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 521 

groinul, excepting the pilasters, placed at 
convenient distances, to strengthen and 
beautify the building; the intermediate 
spaces were filled up with large sashes, of 
the strongest and most transparent glass. â€” 
The middle sash, which was wider than any 
of the ofhers, served for the public en- 
trance, to which you mounted by six easy 
steps, and descended on the inside by as 
many more. This shut and opened with 
greater ease, kept the wind out better, and 
was at the same time more uniform than 
folding doorG. 

In the middle of the roof there ran a 
ceiling, thirty feet broad from one end to 
the other; this was enlivened by a mas- 
terly pencil, with all the variety of rural 
scenes and prospects, which he had peo- 
pled with the whole tribe of svlvan deities. 
Their characters and their stories were so- 
well expressed, that the whole seemed a 
collection of all the most beautiful fables 
of the ancient poets, translated r^to co- 
lours. The remaining spaces of the rooC

ten feet on each side of the ceiling, were 
of the clearest glass, to let in the sky and 
clouds from above. The building pointed 
full East and West, so that you might 
enjoy the sun while he was above the ho- 
rizon. His rays were improved through 
the glass, and you received through it 
what was desirable in a winter sky, without 
the coarse alloy of the seasons. The greens 
and flowers seemed sensible of this benefit; 
they flourished and looked cheerful, as in the 
Spring, while their fellovz-creatures abroad 
were starved to death: a very moderate ex- 
pence of fire, over and above the contribu- 
tions received from the sun, served to keep 
this large room in a due temperature, it 
being sheltered from the cold winds by a 
hill on the North, and a wood on the East. 
There went throni^h the whole length 
of the floor a spacious walk of the finest 
gravel, made to unite and bind so firmly, 
that it seemed one continued stone, with 
this ;idvantage, that it w^as easier to the 
ieet, and better for walking, than if it was 

what 



THE DISCARDED SON. 323 

what it seemed to be. At each end of the 
walk, on the one and on the other side of 
it, lay a square plat of grass, of the finest 
turf and brightest verdure. V/hat ground 
remained on both sides, between these 
little smooth fields of o'reen, was ilaooed 
with large quarries of white marble, where 
the blue veins traced out such a variety of 
irregular windings through the clear sur- 
face, that these bright plains seemed full of 
rivulets and streaming meanders. This, to 
the eye that delighted in simplicity, was 
inexDressibly more beautiful than the che- 
quered floors, which are in general so much 
admired. Upon the right and upon the 
lelt, along the gravel walk, wxre ranged 
interchangeably, the bay, the myrtle, the 
orange, and the lemon-trees, intermixed 
with painted hollies, silver firs, and pyra- 
mids of yew, all so disposed, that every 
tree received an additional beauty from its 
situation ; besides the harmony that rose 
from the disposition of the whole^ no shade 
cut too strongly, or broke in harshly oa

the other, but the eye was cheered with a 
m'Mj rather than a gorgeous diversity of 
greens. 

The borders of the four grass plats were 
garnished with pots of flowers^ those deli- 
cacies of nature which recreate two senses 
at once, and leave such delightful and 
gentle impressions on the brain, that they 
mzj he reckoned of equal force with the 
softest airs of music toward smoothing our 
tempers. In the center of everv plat was 
a statue; the figures made choice of were 
n Venns, an Adonis, a Diana, and an 
Apollo, such excellent copies, as raised the 
same delight that would have been drawn 
from the sight of the ancient originals. 

The North wall would Dave been but a 
tiresome waste to the eye, if it had not 
been diversified with the most lively orna- 
ments suitable to the place. To this in-

center of the ^wa]}, poured from out an urn. 
This, by a fall of abo^e twenty feet, made 
a most delightful cascade into a bason, 
that opened wide within the marble floor 
at that side. At a reasonable distance on 
either hand the cascade, the wall was hol- 
lowed into two spreading scallops, each ot" 
which received a couch of green velvet, 
and formed at the same time a canopy over 
them. Next to them were two iartre a via- 
ries, likewise let into the stone ; the6e were 
succeeded bv two erottoes, set off with all 
the pleasing rudeness of shells and moss, 
and cragged stones, imitating in miniature,, 
rocks and precipices, the most dreadful and 
gigantic w^orks of nature. After the grot- 
toes were two niches, the one inhabited by 
Ceres, with her sirkfc and sheaf of wheat; 
and the other by Pomona, v,'ho, with a 
countenance full of good cheer, poured 
out of her horn a bounteous Autumn of 
fruits. Last of all came too colonies oF

by the same hand that enriched the ceil-

In this deliohtful spot, which it was 
scarcely possible to enter without feeling 
the spirits revived^ and a sweet compla- 
cency diffused over the mind; not to be 
wondered at, when 'tis considered that here 
the music of falling.!: waters, the symphony 
of birds, the gentle hnmming of bees, {he 
breath of flowers, the fine imagery o-f 
painting and sculpture^ in a wordj the 
beauties and charms of nature and of art, 
courted all the facr.kies, refreshed the 
fibres of the brain, and smoothed every 
avenue of thouglit ; it. was here that the 
young. bridal folks received the iirst congra- 
tulations of their friends on their marriage

fair to renLter productive of all the happi- 
neiis they merited.

THE DTSCAHDFxD SON. C-^T 

" O happy love, where love like this is found ; 

O heart-fdt raptures, bli^s beyond compare, 
I've paced much this weary inurtal round. 

And Sage Etperience bids me this dtclaie â€” 
' If heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare, 

One cordial in this melancholy vale, 
"Tis when a youthful, lovfhg, modest pair 

In other's arms, breathe out the tender tale. 

Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the ev'ning gale." 

Previous to thrs happy day Don Al- 
pbonso had made a disposition o^ his pro- 
perty, and given to each oT his grand- 
children a fortune suitable to their birth. 

Soon after breakfast the grateful heart of 
Miinro led him back to his late residence 
at Heath v;ood, for the purpose of putting 
Stubbs in possession of it. He had ap- 
pointed the honest rustic asid his wife, but 
without hinting to them wr^y, to meet him 
there, and was arcompanicd, at his particu- 
lar request, by his father-in-law, his son, 
Delacour, and Mr. Beersrroft. 

Leading the way into th^' parlorr, he 
motioned Stubbs and his dame^ who re- 
ceived 



328 THE DISCAr.DED SON. 

ceivecl him in the hall, to follow. On 
their obeving, he took the farmer by the 
hand. 

" Farmer/' said he, " 'tis at length given 
me to evince, by something more than 
words, the gratitude I owe yon. The friends 
by whom we are now surrounded know the 
obligations I am under (o you ; thev know 
that many of the sorrowful hours I latterly 
passed beneath this roof, were divested of 
their bitterness through your means; that 
for any little comfort either I or mine 
lately enjoyed, we were solely indebted to 
vour kindness. Henceforward consider 
this house as your's; and not only it;, 
but all within and appertaining to it, for 
ever. I give it to you, in the full persua- 
sion that it v/ill still, as heretofore, afford a 
refuge to the houseless child of want; that 
still, as in former times, its gate will 
readily open to the afflicted and the way- 
faring. Necessity, I know, obliged you to 
send your family from you, but that exists 
no longer ; collect them without delay,

in the enjoyment of that domestic felicity^ 
to which the industry, honesty, and bene- 
volence that distinguished their morn- 
ing so justly entitle you. â€” Mrs. Stubbs," 
turning from the astonished farmer to his 
equally astonished wife, and presenting 
her his hand, ''I should deem myself ex- 
tremely remiss, if I did not also avail my- 
self of this opportunity to thank you for 
the kind attentions my family and I re- 
ceived from you. Long, long/' uniting 
the rough and srtn-burnt hands of the ho- 
nest rustics, and pressing them for a few 
minutes between his^, ^' long, long/' with 
fervour he added, " m.ay you and your 
husband be spared to each other; hand in

together; may you live to see vour chil- 
drens' childien rejoicing around you ; and

ping their hands, he ri.sh'^ ri from the room, 
overpowered by emotion. 

'' Amen \" exclaimed Don Alphonso to 
what he had just said, but in a voice scarce 
articulate, and dropping at their feet a rich 
and heavy purse. 

" Noa, noa/' cried the sobbing farm.er, 
instantly picking it up, and following him; 
" noa, noa/' trying to force it upon him; 
" if ye do not all wish to break my heart 
outright by your kindness, you'll take this 
back." 

" Nay,*' said Osmond, interposing, '' you 
must not refuse my grandfather; he means 
that purse to defray the expences of a 
liousewarming, which we must have here as 
soon as your children arrive." 

" Yes," rejoined Deiacour, '' and I be- 
speak the hand of^ your daughter for the 
first dance ; so say no more or: the subject, 
farmer, but do you and your dame," 
slapping him on the shoulder, '' make 
haste and smarten yourselves to come down

THE DISCARDED SON. B31 

to the Hall^ for I assure you, v/e shall take 
it much amiss if the healths of the brides at 
least are not drank there by you." 

'' Well, well, if it must be/' said vStubbs^ 
heaving a deep sigh, indicative of the ful- 
ness of his heart, '' v/hy it must ; but to 
be sure, I can't help thinking myself in a 
dream.'* 

The party now quitted the house, the 
bridegrooms impatient to rejoin their 
lovely brides, and the other gentlemen 
convinced that till left to themselves, the 
honest couple would not be able to regain 
any degree of composure, 

A surprise of a very unexpected nature 
awaited their return to the Hall. Munro's 
last letter to Glengary, announcing the 
happy revolution in his circumstances, and 
Elizabeth's consequent rejection of Sir 
James, reached it too late, owing to an 
accident his messenger met with on the 
road, to prevent his step-dame from send- 
ing the housekeeper to Ik a th wood, to 
make preparations for the return of its 

owners^ 



339 THE DISCARDED SON. 

owners, according to a promise she had 
Hiade to that effect, in consequence of her 
'\\ishing to do something likely to lessen 
Elizabeth's prejudice to her, witu vvhom^ 
from the moment she looked forward to 
her becoming the wife of the Baronet^ 
her selfish policy made her anxious to stand 
well. 

Mrs. M'Tullogh, or more properly Mrs. 
O'Grady, having, about this time, given 
herself a right to the latter appellationj 
by accepting the hand of Sir Patrick 
Dunboyne's valet, of whom the united at- 
tractions of her person and purse, both of 
a weighty description, had made a com- 
pleat conquest, could not have been sent 
upon a more agreeable errand, since af- 
fording her an opportunity of again seeing 
Munro, to whom and his family she was 
sincerely attached. 

She was accompanied from Glengary by 
her husband, partly to please himself, and 
partly his master, Sir Patrick, then con- 
fined there by a severe fit of the gout, and 

whose 



THE DISCARDED SON. SSS 

whose solicitude for intelligence of his 
nephew made him anxious to send some 
one to him^ on whose account he could 
depend, and also by old Andrew, in order 
that he might have the pleasure of clapping 
his een once more upon his young master, 
as he still persisted in calling the discarded 
heir of Glengary. 

At the little inn in the village^ where 
they thought proper to alight, these good 
folks heard of the happy change which had 
taken place in the fortunes of Munro, and 
the marriage of his son and daughter. In- 
stead, therefore, of proceeding to his re- 
cent habitation, they repaired straight to 
the Hall ; and so delighted did they appear 
at the happiness they there witnessed, and 
so anxious to remain a short time specta- 
tors of it, that Lady O'Sinistcr invited 
them to remain till the ensuing^ day â€” an 
invitation they joyfully accepted. This 
led to another surprise. On the party 
'below assembling to dinner, which, in ho- 
nour of the day, was scarcely inferior to 

that

that which had been served above, Mrs. 
O'Grady^ after a little conversation with 
him, discovered, in Mactalla, the son of 
an only and beloved brother, who had 
quitted his native country, many years 
bark, with an officer belonging to the 
Irish brigades in France, and of whom she 
had long, though vainly, been seeking in- 
telligence. Her happiness was unspeak- 
able; as to that of Mactalla, the happy 
change in the affairs of his master's family 
rendered his, at the moment, scarcely ca- 
pable of addition. All the addition, how- 
ever, it was capable of, it received from the 
discovery of his neav relationship to so cre- 
ditable a woman as appearances led him to 
believe Mrs. O'Grady, and the assurance she 
gave him of making him her heir, ifnotbless- 
ed with a family of her own, having, previous 
to her marriage, stipulated that she should 
have her property at her own disposal. 

In spite of her joy, however, at disco- 
vering him, Mrs. O'Grady could not help 
being vexed at the alteration that had taken 

place 



THE DISCARDED ?0K. 335 

place in the orthography of his name ; but 
quickly ceased to be so, on Mactalla's as- 
suring her, on her speaking to him on the 
subject, that in fiiture he shoukl take care 
to spell it exactly as their ancient family did; 
and that it was not his fault, neither 
the fault of his father, that the alteration 
she so much disapproved of had taken 
place, but entirely owing to the ignorance 
of the Marchesa Morati, who, from never 
having been in Ireland, and knowing no- 
thing of the language, neither knew how 
to spell or pronounce an Irish name 
properly. 

" Well, well, my darling boy," cried 
his overjoyed aunt, again clasping him in 
her arms, while tears of joy ran down her 
cheeks, '' no matter, no matter, since the 
foreigners did nothing worse to you than 
alter your name, I am satisfied," 

''With the lea\e of the present good 
company," said farmer Stubbs, who with 
his dame had been invited to this enter- 
tainment, addressing himself to Mactalla,

on the removal of the cloth, *' you ^voukl 
favour us, perhaps, with an account of 
your adventures, for to be sure, Mr. Mac, 
seeing you have been abroad so long, you 
must know many wonderful things." 

'' That I do,'* cried Mactalla, drawing 
himself up with an air of importance, and 
a smile of infinite satisfaction, '' and will 
with pleasure, Mr. Stubbs, give you all 
the information you wish. To begin then 
â€” but Mr. O'Grady, the bottle stands v/ith 
you ; by St. Benedict, and St. Patrick too, 
if you don't push it about more briskly, 
but I shall be tempted to believe you im- 
posed upon my good aunt here, when you 
told her you were an Irishman. Well, Mr. * 
Stubbs,'' he resumed, after filling his glass, 
'^as I was about tellino- vou, I and mv 
master left the castle of Acerenza, and a 
famous fine castle it is, one lovely fine 
morning ; but with truth I may say, as 
you'll allow, by and bye, when you have 
heard all I have got to tell you, 'tis not 
always a day that opens well that ends well;

many a bright morning has been succeeded 
by a cloudy nighty and many a cloudy 
night by a bright morning. â€” But to go on 
with my story^ without circumlocution, as 
they say in my country. The first place 
we came to after quitting the castle was a 
village, but would you believe it, the devil 
a soul was living in it ! no, by the Powers, 
for they were all murdered alive one night, 
and buried in the middle of it-â€” but stay. I 
forget to tell you, there w^as another in 
company with us ; but if we were not 
hampered by having such a spalpeen with 
us, 'tis no matter.'* 

^'That's a darling," cried Mrs. O'Grady, 
" I see youhavn't forgot your Irish." 

'' By St. Benedict, no ; I kept it in stor^ 
till my return : but come, I can travel no 
further without another glass of wine, and 
to give it a zest^ V\{ give you a bit of a 
toast â€” May the new married couples

shall be nameless, be shortly as happy as 
they are/' 

^â€¢^Ah!" exclaimed old Andrew, as he 
wiped away the tears with which joy suF- 
fused his eyes, " you are a cantie cheel, 
Mr. Mac, and put me in mind of my aiii 
youthfu' days/' 

'' Well, now to proceed," resumed Mac- 
talla ; '' all our misfortunes were brought 
upon us by that devil of a French boy I 
just told you about. He couldn't keep up 
with me and my iviaster, and so fearing 
we'd give him the slip, he kept bellowing 
out every moment, like a young bull, that 
he was ooinor to be robbed. Talk of the 
devil and he'll appear, used my grand- 
mother Norah say, and by St. Patrick 
she said what was right, for the robbers 
did come at last. A great storm coming 
en towards night, I and my master took 
refuge in a wood by the road side ; and 
snug enough we thought ourselves, till the 
squalling of Monsieur discovered us to a 
gang of about forty thieves, that had also 

lakeia 



THE DISCARDED SON. 33 D 

taken shelter there. I placed myself be- 
tween them and my master and the little 
boy, and though only armed with a horse- 
whip, gave a devil of a dressing to the 
forty rogues, notwithstanding the swords, 
and pistols, and carbines, with which they 
were armed. I fought them a long time, 
still crying out to my master, as I laid ' 
about me, to have courage." 

'' What !" interrupted Farmer Stubbs, 
'' with only a whip were you able to fight 
and kill forty men, armed with swords and 
pistols !" 

'' What, kill them all ! no, no, with such 
odds against him, that would have been 
more than Sampson himself could have 
done. I think I did very well in fighting 
them all for an hour, and then laying fif- 
teen of them low." 

Here a burst of laughter from honest 
Stubbs again broke the thread of Mr. 
Mactalla's story. 

''By the P9wers, but you have got into 

a merry humour. Master Stubbs,*' cried he, 

q 2 after

after viewing him some minutes in silence; 
^' I should like to know what it is has 
tickled your fancy so suddenly; it can't be 
the tragical. battle^ I am sure^ I have been 
telling you of." 

^^ Why, I'll tell you/' said Farmer Stubbs, 
as soon as he was again able to speak, 
which w^as not immediately. '' First, how- 
ever/' (looking all round him), ''asking 
pardon of this good company for inter- 
rupting you ; but if I was to have been shot 
for it, I couldn't help laughing at your 
story, Mr. Mac, it so put me in mind of 
one I read some years ago, written by a 
man of the name of â€” of Munchausen; ay, 
that was it, I think; by goles, yours is as 
like it as one egg is to another, only that I 
don't think there are quite so many lies in 
yours/' 

" Lies !" repeated MTullogh, rising from 
his seat ; '' by the Powers, Mr. Stubbs, 
but this is not the language of a gentle- 
man/" 

^^ Come, come,'* cried old Andrew, in- 
terposing. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 341 

terposing, *"' deil take me if there shall be 
ony quarrelling on sic s happy day as this ; 
comej Maister Stiibbs^ ye must beg Mais- 
ter Mac's pardon, and tlien a' will gang 
wcel again." 

This vStubbs readily did, protesting he 
meant no offence. 

'^ No, io be sure/' rejoined Andrew, 
" for he must be a crankous churl, which 
I am sartain, from your sonsie looks, you 
are not, Maister Stubbs, who could wish 
to gi* offence to a peerson who was put- 
ting their inveention to the rack to afford 
them amusement, as Maister Mac has been 
kind enough to do for us." 

Mactalla looked a little askance at this 
speech of old Andrew's ; his natural good 
humxOur, however, soon got the better of 
all petulance, and to prove its ascendancy, 
he proposed singing some Italian airs, for 
the amusement of the company. His pro- 
posal was accepted ; and such was the ef- 
fect his quivering and shaking had upon 
his auditors, that in a little while several of 
Q 3 them 



34 !3 ' THE DISCARDED SON. 

them endeavoured to chime in with him^ 
by each trying to adapt a song in their 
own language to the Italian air he favoured 
them with. 

Old Andrew chose â€” ''Green grow the 
rushes^ O ;'* Farmer Stubbs â€” '' Chevy 
Chace ;" and Mr. O'Grady a^id his lady â€” 
^^ Ellen a Roon." 

That the harmony their united exertions 
produced was of the most delightful na- 
ture, we shall not pretend to assert ; such 
as it was, however^ they were perfectly sa- 
tisfied with it. 

Their vocal was at length interrupted 
by instrumental music from an adjoin- 
ing hall, in which, by the command of 
the lady of the mansion, an entertain-* 
ment was provided for the principal te- 
nants, whilst the others were feasted at the 
inn in the village. 

The mortification of Watkins on this 
occasion was such as to induce him to 
seclude himself from every eye; and 
shortly after resolve on quitting a place 

where 



THE DISCARDED SON. 343 

Vk'here his conduct to a worthy man had 
rendered him hateful to all. 

The gentlemen looked in upon the 
happy party below^ and for a short time 
th^ridegrooms mingled with the dancers, 
ef whom Mr. Mac, as he was generally 
styled, was the most conspicuous. As he 
had before charmed and amazed by his 
singing, so did he now by his dancing; 
but with such grand requisites as he was 
in possession of for dancing well, namely, 
a light heart and light heels, it was not 
surprising he should excel in this accom- 
plishn>ent. 

Most unwillingly did Mr. and Mrs. 
O'Grady and old Andrew set off the next 
morning for Glengary. Munro, however, 
determined never intentionally to give any 
one reason to complain of him, would 
not understand the hints they threw out, 
of their readiness to exchange his father's 
service for his. He did not, however, 
permit them to depart, without receiving 
Q 4 substantial 



544 THE DISCAKBED SON. 

substantial proofs of the gratitude he felt 
for their long and disinterested attachment 
to him, neither without a letter to Sir 
Patrick, thanking him for the place he had 
allowed him to retain in his remembrance; 
and entreating him, as soon as he was suffi- 
ciently recovered to be able to travel, to 
favour him with a visit, and, if agreeable, 
take up his residence in future with him. 

Happy in the society of each other, the 
party at Firgrove neither wished nor 
thought of separating, when about a week 
after Munro and his family had become 
inmates of it, an express arrived from 
Sir Patrick, to inform him of the sud- 
den death of his father, just after the 
old gentleman, in consequence of hearing 
of the change that had taken place in 
his circumstances, had destroyed a will 
made agreeably to the wishes of Mrs, 
Munro, and avowed a determination of 
being again on good terms with him. 

Upon this intelligence Munro lost no 

time 



rut DISCARDED SON. 345 

fiine in setting out for Glengary, accom- 
panied by hi3 son and son-in-law. â€”Their 
arrival so immediately after the decease 
of its late owner, was neither expected, 
(SirFatrickhavinggiven her no intimation 
of the express he had dispatched to Heath- 
wood) nor yet desired by the fair relict, 
as it prevented the removal of certain 
valuables she had taken a particular fancy 
to, and which, from perhaps conceiving 
employment the best antidote against sor- 
row, she had busied herself in selecting 
and packing up, almost from the moment 
of her husband's death. 

Compelled by the arrival of the heir to 
see these restored to their usual places, 
her rage and mortification knew no 
bounds, ^and in a paroxysm of passion she 
quitted the house, though informed by 
Munro, that out of respect to the memory 
of his father, he should make no objeciion 
to her remaining in it, till she had provided 
herself with a suitable residence elsewhere. 

We

We should here drop her entirely, buf 
that we wish, as far as is in our power, to 
prove that there are but few instances of 
vice not sooner or later meeting with pu- 
nishment in this life. From the neighbour- 
hood of Glengary, to which she soon after 
bade a final adieu, convinced, from her 
perfect consciousness of the impropriety 
of her conduct, that in losing the title 
of its mistress^ she had lost all that had 
ever obta^ined, or could obtain her the 
notice of its inhabitants, she repaired to 
Edinburgh, where the property she was 
possessed of gave her such charms in the 
eyes of a professional gentleman there> 
as induced him to solicit her hand, very 
shortly after they became acquainted, and 
which, under the idea of his being deeply 
enamoured of her, and in possession of 
a handsome fortune, she had no great 
hesitation in bestov/ing on him. 

Scarcely, however, w^as the nuptial 
knot tied, ere she had convincing proofs

oJT being mistaken in both suppositions ; 
regret and repentance followed the con- 
Tiction â€” but a regret and repentance 
%vhich neither excited sympathy;, nor yet 
amended her ovm heart. 

Munro was too well remembered in the 
rieighbourhood of Glengary for a general 
joy not to pervade it^, at his succeeding to 
the inheritance of his forefathers â€” a joy 
which, but for propriety, would have been 
publicly manifested, oivhis arriving to take 
possession. 

In about six weeks after the death of 
his father, he found himself comfort- 
ably settled with his family at Glengary. â€” 
Their arrival was welcomed by those re- 
joicings which decorum in the first instance 
had prohibited ; and for which, his health 
and Mrs. Munro's being by this time per- 
fectly re-established, there wasjiothing to 
prevent their making suitable returns. But 
in doing this they did not confine their at- 
tentions entirely to their fashionable and

wealthy neighbours ; benevolence, as well 
as hospitality, again took up its abode 
at Glengary ; nnd whilst the jocund guest 
laughed o'er the sparkling bowl, in the 
richly ornamented saloon, and in the tro- 
phied halls, blazing with innumerable 
lights, youths and virgins led off the 
dance, the humbler apartments re-echoed 
with the voice of rustic mirth, and the 
grateful effusions of relieved distress;' in a 
word, the mansion became what it had for- 
merly been â€” 

** A refuge to the neighbouring poor, 
And stranger led astray." 

His natural stock of pity, encreased by 
the sufferings he had himself undergone, 
his own experience of what it was to eat 
the bitter bread, and drink the baleful 
Gup of misery, Munro never neglected an 
opportunity of administering to the wants 
of his fellow-creatures. On the contrary^

he \fas eager in his search after objects of 
distress, and was still aided in the luxury of 
doing good by his faiuily. 

The residence of Don Alphonso was 
fixed for life, with his daugliter. An elegant 
and extensive suit of apartments was ap- 
propriated to his use at Glengary, com- 
municating/by means of a spacious conser- 
vatory^ lined with costly exotics^ and at all 
times furnishing a pleasant walk^ with a 
small gothic building, containing a chapel, 
and apartments for a priest. 

Here also Sir Patrick, after a little strug- 
gle between pride and inclination, con- 
sented at length, at the earnest request of 
his nephew and niece, to pitch his tent, 
as long as poor Poulsalough remained at 
nurse. 

Delacour and his Elizabeth, at the ear- 
nest request of Mrs. Dunbar, who having 
no nearer relative than him, avowed her 
intention of making him her heir, fixed 
their residence at Black Crag, Lady O'vSi-

HERMANN AND EMILIA, 

From the German of 

AUGUSTUS LA FONTAINE, 

4 "vols. 13s. sewed. 
*' Thrs is faid to be a tranflation from the German of 
Auguitiia La Fontaine, who, it every thing be his that is laid 
to his c'n.'uge, mud be allowed to be a molt indttatigable 
novel writer. The bafte with which many of his works nndl 
be conipoted, n^ay ftrve to account for their iucquaiity, 
Htniiann ;s a virtuous enthufialt, pyll'.lTing ail that romantic 
feeling and eccentricity which Fontaine delights tu Â«^'ive to liis 
haradters. The ftory is interefting, and liic lupericrify which 
virtue, undtr every diCadvaniage, poUeiltsovtr vice, li dii'played 
in vivid coiuurs. On this account, the worK> is certainly 
entitled to praik."

are, in general, well drawn, and lome aie even onginal, elpe- 
cially that of the o'd Dowager Lady Dinwicldiv^. The b^-ck,

LUSSINGTON ABBEY, 

A NOVEL, 

BY HENRIETTA ROUVIERE, 
2 vols. gs. sewed. 
*' We began the periifal of this work with no very high 
expectations of finding it polfefled of much merit j the caule 
cf cur expeditions being then fo low, was vhe very humble, 
we had ahnoft faid ftrvile dedication to the Reviewers. When 
we had entered a little way into the ftory, we found ourfelves, 
however, rather agreeably difappointed. Ti\is ftory is 
wrought up with a confic'erabie degree of fkill j fcvcral cA tjie " 
charailers are well drawn, efpecially that of an Iriib (ervant, 
and that of Sulan before fne became a woman. The tale glib 
is told in a manner calculated to render it entertaining, and 
to excite confiderable intereil.'' Literary Journal^ Aug. 1 304. 



THE YOUNG FATHER, 

BY W. F. WILLTAMS, ' 

3 vols. 12s. sewed. 

*< If this production cannot be ranked in the first class of 

works of the same kind, it certainly may, when compared 

with iheojdinary run of novels, he allowed a considerable deal 

of merit. This, it must ue confessed, is no very high praise. 

In evei-y department of literature, good works are, perha^^s, 

comparatively rare; but this particularly holds in the case oj 

nortls. The present novel, however, certainly possesses 

some interest at leails and nothing appears in it which is grossly 

absuitl and unna;wvai."

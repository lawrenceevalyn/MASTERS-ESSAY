THE LAST MAN.
CHATTER I. Нели you not the rushing sound of the coming tempest ? Do you not behold the clouds open, and destruction lurid and dire pour down on the blasted earth ? See you not the thunderbolt fall, and arc deafened by the shout of heaven that follows its descent ? Feel you not the earth quake and open with agoniz¬ ing groans, while the air is pregnant with shrieks and wailings,—all announcing the last days of man ? vol. πι. в
No ! none of these things accompanied our fall ! The balmy air of spring, breathed from nature's ambrosial home, invested the lovely earth, which wakened as a young mother about to lead forth in pride her beauteous offspring to meet their sire who had been long absent. The buds decked the trees, the flowers adorned the land : the dark branches, swollen with seasc nable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of spring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial warmth of the un¬ clouded empyrean : the brooks flow ed mur¬ muring, the sea was waveless, and the promon¬ tories that over-hung it were reflected in the placid waters; birds awoke in the woods, while abundant food for man and beast sprung up from the dark ground. Where was pain and evil ? Not in the calm air or weltering ocean ; not in the woods or fertile fields, nor among the birds that made the woods resonant with song, nor the animals that in the midst of plenty basked in the sunshine. Our enemy,
tilæ the Calamity of Homer, trod out hearts, and no sound was echoed from her steps— With ills the land is rife, with ills the sea, Diseases haunt our frail humanity, Through noon, through night, on casual wing they glide, Silent,—a voice the power all-wise denied.* Once man was a favourite of the Creator, as the royal psalmibt sang, " God had made him a little lower than the angels, and had crowned him with glory and honour. God made him to have dominion over the works of his hands, and put all things under his feet" Once it was so ; now is man lord of the creation ? Look at him— ha í I see plague í She has invested his form, is incarnate in his flesh, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven- seeking eyes. Lie down, О man, on the flower- strown earth ; give up all claim to your inhe¬ ritance, all you can ever possess of it is the small cell which the dead require. * Elton's translation of ILsiod, в 2
Plague is the companion of spring, of sun¬ shine, and plenty. We no longer struggle with her. We have forgotten what we did when she was not. Of old navies used to stem the giant ocean-waves betwixt Indus and the Pole for slight articles of luxury. Älen made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth's splen¬ did trifles, gems and gold. Human labour was wasted—human life set at nought. Now life is all that we covet ; that this automaton of flesh should, with joints and springs in order, perform its functions, that this dwelling of the soul should be capable of containing its dweller. Our minds, late spread abroad through count¬ less spheres and endless combinations of thought, now retrenched themselv es behind this wall of flesh, eager to preserve its well-being only. We were surely sufficiently degraded. At first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures. We nerved
ourselves to the task : " in the midst of despair we performed the tasks of hope." We went out with the resolution of disputing with our foe. We aided the sick, and comforted the sorrowing ; turning from the multitudinous dead to the rare survivors, with an energy of desire that bore the resemblance of power, we bade them—live. Plague sat paramount the while, and laughed us to scorn. Have any of you, my readers, observed the ruins of an anthill immediately after its destruc¬ tion ? At first it appears entirely deserted of its former inhabitants ; in a little time you see an ant struggling through the upturned mould ; they reappear by twos and threes, running hither and thither in search of their lost companions. Such were we upon earth, wondering aghast at tho effects of pestilence. Our empty habitations remained, but the dwellers were gathered to the shades of the tomb. As the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and
THE LAST MAN', wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society. Palaces were deserted, and the poor man dared at length, unreproved, intrude into the splendid apartments, whose very furniture and decorations were an unknown world to him. It was found, that, though at first the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those before supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and hideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were thrown down, the products of human labour at present existing were more, fir more, than the thinned generation could possibly consume. To some among the poor this was matter of exultation. We were all equal now; magnifi¬ cent dwelhngs, luxurious carpets, and beds of <lown, were afforded to all. Carriages and horses, gardens, pictures^ statues, and princely libraries, there were enough of these even to superfluity ; and there was nothing to prevent each from assuming possession of his share. We were all equal now ; but near at hand was au
equality still more levelling, astate where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be as vain as riches and birth. The grave yawned beneath υ & all, and its prospect prevented any of us from enjoying the ease and plenty which in so awful a manner was presented to us. Still the bloom did not fade on the cheek*· of my babes ; and Clara sprung up in years and growth, unsullied by disease. We had no reason to think the site of Windsor Castle pecu¬ liarly healthy, for many other families had ex¬ pired beneath its roof; we lived therefore with¬ out any particular precaution ; but we lived, it seemed, in safety. If Idris became thin and pale, it was anxiety that occasioned the change ; an anxiety I could in no way alleviate. She never complained, but sleep and appetite fied from her, a slow fever preyed on her veins, her colour was hectic, and she often wept in secret ; gloomy prognostications, care, and agonizing dread, ate up the principle of life within her. I could not fail to perceive this change. I often
wished that I had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have dis¬ tracted her thoughts. But it was too late now. Besides that, with the nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion, she was too weak ; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the over active life within her, which, as with Adrian, spent the vital oil in the early morning hours, deprived her limbs of strength. At night, when she could bave me unperceivcd, she w r andered through the house, or hung over the couches of her children ; and in the day time would sink into a perturbed sleep, while her murmurs and starts betrayed the unquiet dreams that vexed her. As this state of wretchedness became more con¬ firmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at con¬ cealment more apparent, I strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope. I could not wonder at the vehemence of her care ; her very soul was tenderness ; she trusted indeed
that she should not outlive me if I became the prey of the vast calamity, and this thought sometimes relieved her. Wc had for many years trod the highway of life hand in hand, and still thus linked, we might step within the shades of death ; but her children, her lovely, playful, animated children—beings sprung from her own dear side—portions of her own being— depositories of our loves—even if we died, it would be comfort to know that they ran man's accustomed course. But it would not be so young and blooming as they were, they would die, and from the hopes of maturity, from the proud name of attained manhood, they were cut off for ever. Often with maternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on life's wide stage. Alas for these latter days ! The world had grown old, and all its inmates partook of the decrepitude. Why talk of infancy, man¬ hood, and old age ? We all stood equal sharers of the last throes of time-worn nature. Arrived at the same point of the world's age—there в S
was no difference in us ; die name of parent and child had lost their meaning ; young boys and girls were level now with men. This was all true ; but it was not less agonizing to take the admonition home. Where could we turn, and not find a desola¬ tion pregnant with the dire lesson of example f The fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and gaudy flowers sprung up,—or where a few w r heat-fields shewed signs of the living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left half¬ way, the ploughman had died beside the plough ; the horses had deserted the furrow, and no seedsman had approached the dead ; the cattle unattended wandered over the fields and through the lanes ; the tame inhabitants of the poultry yard, baulked of their daily food, had become wild—young lambs were dropt in flower-gardens, and the cow stalled in the hall of pleasure. Sickly and few, the country people neither went out to sow nor reap ; but sauntered about the meadows, or lay under the hedges*
when the inclement skv did not drive them to m/ take shed ier under the nearest roof. Many of those who remained, secluded themselves ; some had laid up stores which should prevent the necessity of leaving their homes ;—some deserted wife and child, and imagined that they secured their safety in utter solitude. Such had been Ryland's plan, and he was discovered dead and half-devoured by insects, in a house many mile«! from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity. Others made long jour- nies to unite themselves to those they loved, and arrived to find them dead. London did not contain above a thousand inhabitants; and this number was continually diminishing. Most of them were country peo¬ ple, come up for the sake of change ; the Lon¬ doners had sought the country. The Ьиьу eastern part of the town was silent, or at moat you saw only where, half from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more ransacked than pillaged : bales of rich India
goods, shawls of price, jewels, and spices, un¬ packed, strewed the floors. In some places the possessor had to the last kept watch on his store, and died before the barred gates. The massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their hinges ; and some few lay dead on the pavement. The wretched female, loveless vic¬ tim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of high-born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had died before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered appearance. Women whose delicate feet had seldom touched the earth in their luxury, had fled in fright and horror from their homes, till, losing themselves iu the squalid streets of the metropolis, they had died on the threshold of poverty. The heart sickened at the variety of misery presented; and, when I saw a specimen of this gloomy change, iny soul ached with the fear of what might befall my beloved Idi is and my babes. Were they, sur¬ viving Adrian and myself, to find themselves
protectorless in the world ? As yet the mind alone had suffered—could I for ever put off the time, when the delicate frame and shrinking nerves of my child of prosperity, the nurs¬ ling of rank and wealth, who was my com¬ panion, should be invaded by famine, hardship, and disease ? Better die at once—better plunge apoinard in her bosom, still untouched by drear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own î But, no ; in times of misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be over¬ come by them. I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow- and pain ; and if I were van¬ quished at last, it should not be ingloriouslv. I stood in the gap, resisting the enemy—the impalpable, invisible foe, who had so long be¬ sieged us—as yet he had made no breach : it must be my care that he should not, secretly under¬ mining, burst up within the very threshold of the temple of love, at whose altar I daily sa¬ crificed.
The hunger of Death was now stung more sharply by the diminution of his food : or was it that before, the survivors being many, the dead were less eagerly counted ? Now each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, Ö ! far more worth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone ; and the daily, nay, hourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with sickening misery. This summer ex¬ tinguished our hopes, the vessel of society was wrecked, and the shattered raft, which carried the few^ survivors over the sea of miser}', was riven and tempest tost. Man existed by twfbs and three? ; man, the individual who might sleep, and wake, and perform the animal func¬ tions; but man, in himself weak, yet more powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean ; man, the cjueller of the elements, the lord of created nature, the peer of demi-gods, existed no longer. Farewell to the patriotic scene, to the love of liberty and well earned meed of virtuous aspira-
tion î —farewell to crowded senate, vocal with the councils of the wise, whose laws were keener than the sword blade tempered at Damascus !— farewell to kingly pomp and warlike pageantry ; the crowns are in the dust, and the wearers are in their graves !—farewell to the desire of rule, and the hope of victory ; to high vaulting am¬ bition, to the appetite for praise, and the crav¬ ing for the suffrage of their fellows ! The nations are no longer ! No senate sits in council for the dead ; no scion of a time honoured dynasty pants to rule over the inhabitants of a charnel house ; the generals hand is cold, and the sol¬ dier has his untimely grave dug in his native fields, unhonourcd, though in youth. The market-place is empty, the candidate for popular favour finds none whom' he can represent. To chamliers of painted state fare 11 !—To mid¬ night revelry, and the panting emulation of beauty, to costly dress and birth-day shew, to title and the gilded coronet, farewell ! Farewell to the giant powers of man,—to
knowledge that could pilot thfi deep-drawing bark through the opposing waters of shoreless oeean,-~to science that directed the silken balloon through the pathless air,—to the power that could put а barrier to mighty waters, and set in motion wheels, and beams, and vast machinery, that could divide rocks of granite or marble, and make the mountains plain í Farewell to the arts,—to eloquence, which is to the human mind as the winds to the sea, stir¬ ring, and then allaying it ;—'farewell to poetry and deep philosophy, for man's imagination is cold, and his enquiring mind can no longer expa¬ tiate on the wonders of life, for " there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the crave, whither thou goest Г —to the graceful building, which in its perfect propor¬ tion transcended the rude forms of nature, the fretted gothic and massy saracenic pile, to the stupendous arch and glorious dome, the fluted column with its capital, Corinthian, Ionic, or Doric, the peristyle and fair entablature, whose
harmony of form is to the eye as musical con¬ cord to the ear !—farewell to sculpture, where the pure marble mocks human flesh, and in the plastic expression of the culled excellencies of the human shape, shines forth the god !—farewell to painting, the high wrought sentiment and deep knowledge of the artist's mind in pictured canvas—to paradisaical scenes, where trees are ever vernal, and the ambrosial air rests in per¬ petual glow :—to tlie stamped form of tempest, and wildest uproar of universal nature encaged in the narrow frame, О farewell ! Farewell to music, and the sound of song ; to the marriage of instruments, where the concord of soft and harsh unites in sweet harmony, and gives wings to the panting listeners, whereby to climb heaven, and learn the hidden pleasures of the eternals ! —Farewell to the well-trod stage ; a truer tra¬ gedy is enacted on the world's ample scene, that puts to shame mimic grief: to high-bred comedy, and the low buffoon, farewell i—·Man may laugh no more.
Alas ! to enumerate the adornments of hu¬ manity, shews, by what we have lost, how supremely great man was. It is all over now. He is solitary ; like our first parents expelled from Paradise, he looks back towards the scene he has quitted. The high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague, lie between it and him. Like to our first parents, the whole earth is before him, a wide desart. Unsup¬ ported and w r eak, let him wander through fields where the unrcaped corn stands in barren plenty, through copses planted by his fathers, through towns built for his use. Posterity is no more ; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning ; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, О deserted one, lie down at evening-tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond igno¬ rance alone canst thou hope for ease ! Joy paints with its own colours every act and thought The happy do not feel poverty—for delight is as a gold-tissued robe, and crowns them
with priceless gems. Enjoyment plays the cook to their homely fare, and mingles intoxication with their simple drink. Joy strews the hard couch with roses, and makes labour ease. Sorrow doubles the burthen to the bent-down back ; plants thorns in the unyielding pillow : mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their bitter bread ; cloathing them in rags, and strew¬ ing ashes on their bare heads. To our irremedi¬ able distress every small and pelting incon¬ venience came with added force ; we had strung our frames to endure the Atlean weight thrown on us ; we ^ank beneath the added feather chance threw on us, " the grasshopper was a burthen.*'' Many of the survivors had been bred in luxury —their servants were gone, their powers of com¬ mand vanished like unreal shadows: the poor even suffered various privations ; and the idea of another winter like the last, brought affright to our minds. Was it not enough that we must die, but toil must be added ?—must we prepare our funeral repast with labour, and with un-
seemly drudgery heap fuel on our deserted hearths—must we with servile hands fabricate the garments, soon to be our shroud ? Not so ! We are presently to die, let us then enjoy to its full relish the remnant of our lives. Sordid care, a vaunt ! menial labours, and pains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our ex¬ hausted strength, shall make no part of our ephe¬ meral existences. In the beginning of time, when, as now, man lived by families, and not by tribes or nations, they were placed in a genial clime, where earth fed them untitled; and the balmy air en wrapt their reposing limbs with warmth more pleasant than beds of down. The south is the native place of the human race; the land of fruits, more grateful toman than the hard-earned Ceres of the north,—of trees, whose boughs are as a palace-roof, of couches of roses, and of the thirst-appeasing grape. We need not there fear cold and hunger. Look at England ! the grass shoots up high in the meadows ; but they are dank and cold,
unfit bed for us. Corn we have none, and the crude fruits cannot support us. We must seek firing in the bowels of the earth, or the unkind atmosphere will fill us with rheums and aches. The labour of hundreds of thousands alone could make this inclement nof)k fit habitation for one man. To the south then, to the sun !—where nature is kind, where Jove has showered forth the contents of Atnalthea's orn, and earth is a garden. England, late birth-place of excellence »and school of the wise, thy children are gone, thy glory faded ! Thou, England, wert the triumph of man í Small favour was shewn thee by thy Creator, thou Tsle (if the North ; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours; but the hues he gave aie faded, never more to be renewed. So we mu>t leave thee, thou marvel of the world ; we must bid farewell to thy clouds, and cold, and scarcity for ever ! Thy manly hearts arc still ; thy tale of pow er jmkI liberty at its close ! Bereft of man, () little isle ί the ocean
waves will buffet thee, and the laven flap his wings over thee; thy soil will be birth-place of weeds, thy sky will canopy barrenness. It was not for the rose of Persia thou wert famous, nor the banana of the east ; not for the spicy gales of India, nor the sugar groves of America ; not for thv vines nor thy double harvests nor for thy vernal airs, nor solstitial sun—but for thy children, their unwearied industry and lofty aspiration. They aie gone, and thou goest with them the oft trodden path that leads to oblivion,— Farewell, sad Ые, farewell, thy fatal glory Is summed, cast np, and cancelled ia this story.*
* Cleveland's Poems.
CHAPTER IL In the autumn of this year Й09в, the spirit of emigration crept in among the few survivors, who, congregating from various parts of England, met in London. This spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far off thought, until communicated to Adrian, who imbibed it with ardour, anel in¬ stantly engaged himself in plans for its execution. The fea.* of immediate death vanished with the heats of September. Another winter was before us, and we might elect our mode of parsing it to the best ad van tige. Perhaps in rational philo¬ sophy rone could be better chosen than this
scheme of migration, which would draw us from the immediate scene of our woe, and, leading us through pleasant and picturesque countries, amuse for a time our despair. The idea once broached, all were impatient to put it in exe¬ cution. We were still at Windsor; our renewed hopes medicincd the anguish we had suffered from the late tragedies. The deatli of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that Windsor Castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, ai'sd even Idrb lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a lust sunbeam tinges its silver cup. dust at this time Adrian came down to us ; his eagei 1оокь shewed us that he was full of some scheme. 1 le hastened to take me aside, and disclosed to ше with rapidity his plan of emigration fiom England. To leave England for ever ! to turn from its polluted fields and groves, and, placing the sea between us, to quit it, as a sailor quits the
rock on which he has been wrecked, when the saving ship rides by. Such was his plan. To leave the country of our fathers, made holy by their graves !—We could not feel even as a voluntary exile of old, who might for pleasure or convenience forsake his native soil ; though thousands of miles might divide him, England was still a part of him, as he of her. He heard of the passing events of the day ; he knew that, if he returned, and resumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it re¬ quired but the will, to surround himself at once with the associations and habits of boyhood. Not so with us, the remnant. We left none to re¬ present us, none to rcpcople the desart land, and the name of England died, when we left her, Iu vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety. Vet let usgo! England is in her shroud,— we may not enchain ourselves to a corpse. Let us go—the world is our country now, and we will choose for our residence its most fertile spot. vol. ih. с
Shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death ? T .et us rather go out to meet it gallantly :—or perhaps—for all this pendulous orb, this fair gem in the sky's diadem, is not surely plague-striken—perhaps in some secluded nook, amidst eternal spring, and waving trees, and purling streams, we may find Life. The world is vast, and England, though her many fields and wide spread woods seem interminable, is but a small part of her. At the clohe of a dav\ march over high mountains and through snowy vallies, we may come upon health, and committing our loved ones to its charge, replant the uprooted tree of humanity, and send to late posterity the tale of the ante-pestilential race, the heroes and sages of the lost state of things, Hope bed ons and sorrow urges ih, the heart beats high with expectation, and this eagei desire of change must he an omen of success. О come ! Farewell to the dead ! farewell to 'mi tombs of those we loved!—farewell to giant
London and the placid Thames, to river and mountain or fair district, birth-place of the wise and good, to Windbor Forest and its antique castle, farewell ! themes for story alone are they, -—we must live elsewhere. Such were in part the arguments of Adrian, uttered with enthusiam anel unanswerable rapi¬ dity. Something more was in his heart, to which he dared not give words. He felt that the enei of time was come ; lie knew that one by one we should dwindle into nothingness. It was not adviseable to wait this sad consummation in our native country ; but travelling would give us our object for each day, that wouid distract our thoughts from the swift-approaching end e>f things. If wc went to Italy, to sacred and eternal Kome, we might wnh greater patience submit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low. We might lose our selfish grief i»i the sublime aspect of its desolation. All this was in the mind of Adrian : but he thought of my children, and, instead of communicating f о c Ä
mc these resources of despair, he called up the image of health and life to be found, where we knew not—-when we knew not; but if never to be found, for ever and for ever to be sought. lie won me over to his party, heart anel souk It devolved on me to disclose our plan to Idris. The images of health and hope which I presenteei to her, made her with a smile consent. With a smile she agreeel to leave her country, from which she had never before been absent, and the spot she had inhabited from infancy ; the forest anel its mighty trees, the woe)dland paths and green recesses, where she had played in childhood, and had lived so happily through youth ; she would leave them without regret, for she hoped to purchase thus die lives of her children. They were her life; dearer than a spot consecrated to love, dearer than all else the earth contained. The boys heard with childish glee of our removal. Clara asked if we were to go to Athens. " It is possible," I replied ; and her countenance became radiant with plea-
aure. There she would behold the tomb of her parents, and the territory filled with recollec¬ tions of her father's glory. In silence, but without respite, she had brooded over these scenes. It was the recollection of them that had turned her infant gaiety to seriousness, and had impressed her with high and restless thoughts. There were many dear friends whom wè must not leave behind, humble though they were. There was the spirited and obedient steed which Lord Raymond had given his daughter ; there was Alfred's dog and a pet eagle, whose sight was dimmed through age. But this catalogue of favourites to be taken with us, could not be made without grief to think of our heavy losses, and a deep sigh for the many things we must leave behind. The tears rushed into the eyes of Idris, while Alfred and Evelyn brought now a favourite rose tree, now a marble vase beautifully carved, insisting that these must go, and exclaiming on the pity
that we could not take the castle and the forest, the deer and the birds, and all accustomed and cherished objects along with us. " Fond and foolish ones," I said, É€ we have lost for ever treasures far more precious than these ; and we desert them, to preserve treasures to which in comparison they are nothing. Let us not for a moment forget our object and our hope ; and they will form a resistless mound to stop the overflowing of our regret for trifles."" The children were easily distracted, and again returned to their prospect of future amusement. Idris had disappeared. She had gone to hide her weakness ; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears ; I found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and broken exclama¬ tions could not be suppressed ; with surpassing grief I beheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow ! I drew her towardsme ; and, as she felt
íny kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what re¬ mained to her. " You are very kind not to re¬ proach me," she said : " I weep, and a bitter pang of intolerable sorrow tears my heart. And yet I am happy ; mothers lament their children, wives lose their husbands, while you and my children are left to me. Yes, I am happy, most happy, that I can v\ eep thus for imaginary sorrows, and that the slight loss of my adored country is not dwindled and annihilated in mightier misery. Take me where you will; where you and my children arc, there shall be Wind¬ sor, and every country will be England to me. Let these tears flow not for myself, happy and ungrateful as I am, but for the dead world—for our lost country—for all of love, and life, and joy, now choked in the dusty chambers of death:' She spoke quickly, as if to convince herself ; she turned her eyes from the trees and forest- paths she loved ; she hid her face in my bosom,
and we—yes, my masculine firmness dissolved —we wept together consolatory tears, and then calm— nay, almost cheerful, we returned to the castle. The first cold weather of an English October, made us hasten our preparations. I persuaded Idris to go up to London, where she might better attend to necessary arrangements. I did not tell her, that to spare her the pang of part¬ ing from inanimate objects, now the only things left, I had resolved that we should none of us re¬ turn to Windsor. For the last time we looked on the wide extent of country visible from the terrace, and saw the last rays of the sun tinge the dark masses of wood variegated by autumnal tints; the uncultivated fields and smokeless cottages lay in shadow below ; the Thames wound through the wide plain, and the venerable pile of Eton college, stood in dark relief, a prominent ob¬ ject ; the cawing of the myriad rooks which in¬ habited the trees of the little park, as in column or thick wedge they speeded to their nests,
disturbed the silence of evening. Nature was the same, as when she was the kind mother of the human race ; now, childless and forlorn, her fertility was a mockery ; her loveliness a mask for deformity. Why should the breeze gently stir the trees, man felt not its refreshment? Why did dark night adorn herself with stars— man saw them not ? Why are there or fruits, or flowers, or streams, man is not here to enjoy them ? Idris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine. Iler face was radiant with a smile.— ťt The sun is alone, 11 she said, ci but we are not. A strange star, my Lionel, ruled our birth; racily and with dismay we may look upon the annihilation of man ; but we remain for each other. Did I ever in the wide world seek other than thee ? And since in the wide world thou remainest, why should I complain ? Thou and nature are still true to me. Beneadi the shades of night, and through the day, whose garish light displays our solitude, thou с 3
wilt still be at my side, and even Windsor will not be regretted. I had chosen night time for our journey to London, that the change and desolation of the country might be the less observable. Our onlv surviving servant drove us. We past down the *.teep hill, and entered the dusky avenue of the Long Walk. At times like these, minute circum¬ stances assume giant and majestic proportions ; the very swinging open of the white gate that ad¬ mitted us into the forest, arrested my thoughts as matter of interest ; it was an every day act, never to occur again í The setting crescent of the moon glittered through the massy trees to our light, and when we entered the p' .k, we scared a troop of deer, that fled bounding away in the forest shades. Our two boys quickly slept ; once, be¬ fore our road turned from the view, I looked back on the castle. Its windows glistened in the moonshine, and its heavy outline lay in a dark mass against the sky—the trees near us waved a solemn dirge to the midnight breeze,
Idris leaned back in the carriage; her two hands pressed mine, her countenance was placid, she seemed to lose the sense of what she now- left, in the memory of what she still possessed. My thoughts were sad and solemn, yet not of unmingled pain. The very excess of our misery carried a relief with it, giving sublimit) and elevation to sorrow. I felt that 1 carried with me those I best loved; I was pleased, after a long separation to rejoin Adrian ; never again to part. I felt that I quitted what I loved, not what loved me. The castle walls, and long familiar trees, did not hear the parting sound of our carriage-wheels with regret. And, while I felt Idris to be near, and heard the re¬ gular breathing of my children, I could not be unhappy. Clara was greatly moved; with streaming eyes, suppressing her sobs, she leaned from the window, watching the last glimpse of her native Windsor. Adrian welcomed us on our arrival. He was all animation ; you could no longer trace in bi»
look of health, the suffering valetudinarian ; from bis smile and sprightly tones you could not guess that he was about to lead forth froia their native country, the numbered remnant of the English nation, into the tenantless realms of the south, there to die, one by one, till the last man should remain in a voiceless, empty world. Adrian was impatient for our departure, and had advanced far in his preparations. His wisdom guided all. His care was the soul, to move the luckless crowd, who relied wholly on him. It was useless to provide many things, for we should find abundant provision in every town. It was Adrian's wish to prevent all labour ; to bestow a festive appearance on this funeral train. Our numbers amounted to not quite two thousand persons. These were not all assembled in London, but each day wit¬ nessed the arrival of fresh numbers, and those who resided in the neighbouring towns, had re¬ ceived orders to assemble at one place, on the
twentieth of November. Carriages and horses were provided for all ; captains and under officers chosen, and the whole assemblage wisely organized. All obeyed the Lord Protector of dying England ; all looked up to him. His council was chosen, it consisted of about fifty persons. Distinction and station were not the qualifications of their election. We had no station among us, but that which benevolence and prudence gave ; no distinction save between the living and the dead. Although we were anxious to leave England before the depth of winter, yet we were detained. Small parties had been dispatched to various parts of Eng¬ land, in search of stragglers; we would not go, until we had assiued ourselves that in all human probability we did not leave behind a *inole human beitm'. On our arrival in London, we found that the aged Countess of Windsor was residing with her son in the palace of the Protectorate; we re¬ paired to our accustomed abode near JI\de
Park. Idris now for the first time for many years saw her mother, anxious to assure herself that the childishness of old age did not mingle with unforgotten pride, to make this high-born dame still so inveterate against me. Age and care had furrowed her cheeks, and bent her form; but her eye was still bright, her manners autho¬ ritative and unchanged ; she received her daughter coldly, but displayed more feeling as she folded her grand-children in her arms. It is our nature to wish to continue our systems and thoughts to posterity through our own offspring. The Countess had failed in this design with regard to her children ; perhaps she hoped to find the next remove in birth more tractable. Once Idris named me casually—a frown, a convulsive gesture of anger, shook her mother, and, with voice trembling with hate, she said— (( I am of little worth in this world ; the young are impa¬ tient to push the old off the scene ; but. Idris, if you do not wish to see your mother expire at your feet, never again name that pei son to me;
all else I can bear ; and now I am resigned to the destruction of my cherished hopes : but it is too much to require that I should кле die in¬ strument that providence gifted with murderous properties for my destruction." This was a strange speech, now that, on the empty htage, each might play hb part without impediment from the other. But the haughty Ex-Queen thought as Octavius Cæsar and Mark Antony, We could not stall togethei In the w hole wcild. The period of our departure was fixed for the twenty-fifth of November. The weather wab temperate ; soft rain» fell at night, and by day the wintry sun shone out. Our numbers we T e to mov e foi w ard in separate parties, and to go by different routes all to unite at last at Paris. Adnan and his division, consisting in all of five hundred persons were to take the direction of Dover and Calais.
On the twentieth of November, Adrian and I rode for the last time through the streets of London. They were grass-grown and desert. The open doors of the empty mansions creaked upon their hinges ; rank herbage, and deforming diit, had swiftly accumulated on the steps of the houses; the voiceless steeples of the churches pierced the smokeless air; the churches were open, but no piayer was offered at the altars; mildew and damp had already defaced their or¬ naments, birds, and tame animals, now home- Icbs, had built nests, and made their lairs in con¬ secrated >pots. We passed St Pauľs. London, which had extended so far in suburbs in ¿ill di¬ rection, had been somewhat deserted in the midst, and much of what had in former days obscured this \aat building was icmoved. Itb ponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like a temple, but a tomb. Methought above the portico was en¬ graved the Hhjatet of England. We passed on eastwards, engaged in such solemn talk as t!*
times inspired. No human step was heard, nor human form discerned. Troops of dogs, deserted of their masters, passed us ; and now and then a horse, unbridled and unsaddled, trotted to¬ wards us, and tried to attract the attention of those which we rode, as if to allure them to seek like liberty. An unwieldy ox, who had fed in an abandoned granary, suddenly lowed, and shewed his shapeless form in a narrow door-way ; every thing was desert ; but nothing was in ruin. And this medley of undamaged buildings, and luxurious accommodation, in trim and fresh youth, was contrasted with the lonely silence of the unpeopled streets. Night closed in, and it began to rain. We were about to return homewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted our attention. It v\as a child singing a merry, lightsome air ; there was no other sound. We had traversed London from Hyde Park even to where we new were in the Minories, and had met no person, heard no voice nor footstep. The
singing was interrupted by laughing and talk¬ ing; never was merry ditty so sadly timed, never laughter more akin to tears. The door of the house from which these sounds proceeded w T as open, the upper rooms were illuminated as for a feast. It was a large magnificent house, in which doubtless some rich merchant had lived. The^ singing again commenced, and rang through the high-roofed rooms, while we süent ly ascended the stair-case. Lights now appeared to guide us ; and a long suite of splendid rooms illuminated, made us still more wonder. Their only inhabitant, a little girl, was dancing, waltzing, and singing about them, followed by a large Newfoundland dog, who boisterously jumping on her, and interrupting her, made her now scold, now laugh, now throw herself on the carpet to play with him. She w r as dressed gro« tesqueîy, in glittering robes and shawls fit for a woman ; she appeared about ten years of age. We stood at the door looking on this strange scene, till the dog perceiving us barked loudly ;
the child turned and saw us : her face, losing its gaiety, assumed a sullen expression : she slunk back, apparently meditating an escape. I came up to her, and held her hand ; she did not re¬ sist, but with a stern brow, so strange in child¬ hood, so different from her former hilarity, she stood still, her eyes fixed on the ground. *' What do you do here ?" I said gently ; iC Who are you ?''—she was silent, but trembled violently. " My pooi child,'" asked Adrian, " are you alone Ρ' 1 There was a winning softness in his voice, that went to the heart of the little girl ; she looked at him, then snatching her hand from me, threw herself into his arms, clinging round his neck, ejaculating—" Save me ! save me !" while her unnatural sullenness dissolved in tears. <e I will save you, v he replied, Ci of what are you afraid ? you need not fear my friend, he will do you no harm. Are you alone?"* α No, Lion is with me." " And your father and mother ?—" " I never had any ; I am a charity girl.
Every body is gone, gone for a great, great many days ; but if they come back and find me out, they will beat me so !" Her unhappy story was told in these few words : an orphan, taken on pretended charity, ill-treated and reviled, her oppressors had died : unknowing of what had passed around her, she found herself alone ; she had not dared venture out, but by the continuance of her solitude her courage revived, her childish ν ivacity caused her to play a thousand freaks, and with her brute companion she passed a long holiday, fearing nothing but the return of the harsh voices and cruel usage of her protectors. She readily con¬ sented to go with Adrian. In the mean time, while we descanted on alien sorrows, and on a solitude which struck our eyes and not our hearts, while we imagined all of change and suffering that had intervened in these once thronged streets, before, tenantless and abandoned, they became mere kennels for dogs, and stables for cattle :—while we read the death
THE of the world upon the dark fane, and hugged ourselves in the remembrance that we possessed that which was all the world to us—in the mean¬ while --------- W r e had arrived from Windsor early in Oc¬ tober, anel had now been in London about six weeks. Day by day, during that time, the health of my Idris declined: her heart was broken; neither sleep nor appetite, the chosen servants of health, waited on her wasted form. To watch her children hour by hour, to sit by me, drinking deep the dear persuasion that I re¬ mained to her, was all her pastime. Her vivacity, so long assumed, her affectionate display of cheerfulness, her lightdieartcd tone and springy gait were gone. I could not disguise to myself, nor could she conceal, her life-consumintr sorrow. Süll change of scene, and reviving hopes might restore her ; I feared the plague only, and she was untouched by that. 1 had left her this evening, reposing after the
fatigues of her preparations. Clara sat beside her, relating a story to the two boys. The eyes of Idris were closed: but Clara perceived a sudden change in the appearance of our eldest darling ; his heavy lids veiled his eyes, an un¬ natural colour burnt in his cheeks, his breath became short. Clara looked at the mother ; she slept, yet started at the pause the narrator made —Fear of awakening and alarming her, caused Clara to go on at the eager call of Evelyn, who was unaware of what was passing Her eyes turned alternately from Alfred to Idris; with trembling accents she continued her tale, till she saw the child about to fall : starting forw ard she caught Ыш, and hôr cry roused Idris. She looked on her son. She saw death stealing across his features; she laid him on a bed, she held drink to his parched lips. Yet he might be saved. If I were there, he might be saved; perhaps it was not the plague. Without a counsellor, what could she do'ť Цау
and behold him die ! Why at that moment w r as I away? "Look to him, Clara," she exclaimed, " I will return immediately. 11 She inquired among those who, selected as the companions of our journey, had taken up their residence in our house; she heard from them merely that I had gone out with Adrian. She entreated them to seek me: she returned to her child, he was plunged in a frightful state of torpor ; again she rushed down stairs ; all was dark, desert, and silent; she lost all self-possession; she ran into the street ; she called on mv name. The pattering rain and howling wind alone replied to her. Wild fear gave wings to her feet; she darted forward to*seek me, she knew not where ; but, putting all her thoughts, all her energy, all her being in speed only, most mis¬ directed speed, she neither felt, nor feared, nor paused, but ran right on, till her strength sud¬ denly deserted her so suddenly, that she had not thought to save herself. Her knees failed her, and she fell heavily on the pavement.
She was stunned for a time ; but at length rose, and though sorely hurt, still walked on, shedding a fountain of tears, stumbling at times, going she knew not whither, only now r and then with feeble voice she called my name, adding with heart-piercing exclamations, that I was cruel and unkind. Human being there was none to reply ; and the inclemency of the night had driven the wandering animals to the habitations they had usurped. Her thin dress was drenched with rain; her wet hair clung round her neck ; she tottered through the dark streets; till, striking her foot against an unseen impediment, she again fell; she could not rise; she hardly strove; but, gathering up her limbs, she resigned herself to the fury of the elements, and the bitter grief of her own heart. She breathed an earnest prayer to die speedily, for there was no relief but death. While hopelesb of safety for herself, she ceased to lament for her dying child, but shed kindly, bitter tears for the grief I should experience in losing her.
While she lay, life almost suspended, she felt a warm, soft hand on her brow, and a gentle female voice asked her, with expressions of tender compassion, if she could not rise? That another human being, sympathetic and kind, should exist near, roused her ; half rising, with clasped hands, and fresh springing tears, she entreated her companion to seek for me, to bid me hasten to my dying child, to save him, for the love of heaven, to save him! The woman raised her; she led her under shelter, she entreated her to return to her home, whither perhaps I had already returned, Idris easily yielded to her persuasions, she leaned on the arm of her friend, she endeavoured to walk on, but irresistible faintness made her pause again and again. Quickened by the encreasing storm, we had hastened our return, our little charge was placed before Adrian on his horse. There vn 4 an as- semVage of persons under the portico of our house, in whose gestures I instinctively read vol. in. r>
some heavy change, some new misfortune. With *>wift alarm, afraid to ask a single question, I leapt from my horse; the spectators saw me, knew me, and in awful silence divided to make way for me. I snatched a light, and rushing up stairs, and hearing a groan, without reflection I threw open the door of the first room that pre¬ sented itself. It was quite dark ; but, as I stept within, a pernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening qualms, which made their way to my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a groan repeated by the person that held me. I lowered my lamp, and saw a negro half clad, writhing under the agony of disease, while he held me with a convulsive grasp. With mixed horror and impatience I strovj to disen¬ gage mvself, and fell on the sufferer; he wound his naked festering arms round mc, his face was close to mine, and his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was over¬ come, my head was bowed by aching nausea; till, reflection returning, I sprung up, threw the
wretch from me, and darting up the staircase, entered the chamber usually inhabited by my family. A dim light shewed me Alfred on a couch ; Clara trembling, and paler than whitest snow, had raised him on her arm, holding a cup f)f water to his lips. I saw full well that no spark of life existed in that ruined form, his featurea were rigid, his eyes glazed, his head had fallen back. I took him from her, I laid him >oftly down, kissed his cold little mouth, and turned to speak in a vain whisper, when loudest sound of thunderlike cannon could not have reached him in his immaterial abode. And where was Idris? That she had gone out to seek me, and had not returned, were fearful tidings, while the rain and driving wind clattered against the window, and roared round the house. Added to this, the sickening sensation of disease gained upon me ; no time was to be lost, if ever I would see her again. I mounted my horse and rode out to seek her, fancying that I heard
her voice in every gust, oppressed by fever and aching pain. I rode in the dark and rain through the labyrin¬ thine streets of unpeopled London, My child lay dead at home ; the seeds of mortal disease had taken root in my bosom; I went to seek Idris, my adored, now wandering alone, while the waters were rushing from heaven like a cataract to bathe her dear head in chill damp, her fair limbs in numbing cold. A female stood on the step of a door, and called to me as I gal¬ lopped past. It vvas not Idris ; so I rode swiftly on, until a kind of second sight, a reflection back again on my senses of what I had seen but not marked, made me feel sure that another figure, thin, graceful and tall, stood clinging to the foremost person who supported her. In a minute I was beside the suppliant, in a minute I received the sinking Idris in my arms. Lifting her up, I placed her on the horse: ¡die had not strength to support herself; so I mounted
behind her, and held her close to my bosom, wrapping my riding-cloak round her, while her companion, whose well known, but changed coun¬ tenance, (it was Juliet, daughter of the Duke of L —) could at this moment of horror obtain from me no more than a paising glance of com¬ passion. She took the abandoned rein, and conducted our obedient steed homewards. Dare 1 avouch it? Tliat was the last moment of my happiness ; but I was happy. Idris must die, for her heart was broken : I must die, for 1. had caught the plague; earth was a scene of deso¬ lation ; hope was madness ; life had married death ; they were one ; but, thus supporting my fainting love, thus feeling that 1 must soon die, I revelled iu the delight of possessing her once more; again and again 1 kissed her, and pressed her to mv heart. m/ We arrived at om home. I assisted her to dismount, I carried her up stairs, and gave her into Clara's care, that her wet garments might be changed. Briefly I assured Adrian of her
safety, and requested that we might be left to repose. As the miser, who with trembling caution visits his treasure to count it again and again, so I numbered each moment, and grudged every one that was not spent with Idris. 1 returned swiftly to the chamber where the life of my life reposed ; before I entered the room 1 paused for a few seconds ; for a few seconds 1 tried to examine my state ; sickness and shud¬ dering ever and anon came over me; my head was heavy, my chest oppressed, my legs bent under me ; but I threw off resolutely the swift growing symptoms of my disorder, and met Idris with placid and even joyous looks*. She was lying on a couch ; carefully fastening the door to prevent all intrusion ; I sat by her, we embraced, and our lips met in a kiss long drawn and breathless-—would that moment had been my last ! Maternal feeling now awoke in my poor girľs bosom, and she asked : " And Alfred ?" "Idris," 1 replied, u w r e are spared to each other, we are
together ; do not let any other idea intrude. I am happy ; even on this fatal night, I de¬ clare myself happy, beyond all name, all thought —what would you more, sweet one ? 4 Idris understood me : she bowed her head on my shoulder and wept. " Why," she again asked, " do you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus ?" " Well may I be shaken,* I replied, " happy as I am. Our child is dead, and the present hour is dark and ominous. Well may 1 trem¬ ble î but, I am happy, mine ow r n Idris, most happy." " I understand thee, my kind love, v said Idris, " thus—pale as thou art with sorrow at our loss ; trembling and aghast, thou wouidest assuage my grief by thy dear assurances. I am not happy," (and the tears flashed and fell from under her down-cast lids), tc for we are inmates of a miserable prison, and there is no joy for us; but the true love I bear you will render this and every other loss endurable."
" We have been happy together, at least," I said ; " no future misery can deprive us of the past. We have been true to each other for years, ever bince my sweet princess-love came through the snow to the lowly cottage of the poverty-striken heir of the ruined Verney. Even now, that eternity is before us, we take hope only from the presence of each other. Idris, do you think, that when we die, we shall be divided ? 4 " Die ! when we die ! what mean you ? VVhat secret lies hid from me in those dread¬ ful words ?" ťí Must we not all die, dearest ? v ï asked with a sad smile. " Gracious God í are you ill, Lionel, that you speak of death? My only friend, heart of my heart, speak !° 4i I do not think," replied I, "that we have any of us long to live ; and when the curtain drops on this mortal scene, where, think you, we shall find ourselves ?"
Idris was calmed by my unembarrassed tone and look; she answered:—"You may easily believe that during this long progress of the plague, I have thought much on death, and asked myself, now that all mankind is dead to this life, to what other life they may have been borne. Hour after hour, I have dw T elt on these thoughts, and strove to form a rational conclu¬ sion concerning the my&tery of a future state. What a scare-crow, indeed, w r ould death be, if we were merely to cast aside the shadow in which we now walk, and, stepping forth into the unclouded sunshine of knowledge and love, revived w r ith the same companions, the same affections, and reached the fulfilment of our hopes, leaving our fears with our earthly л -est ure in the grave. Alas ! the wime strong feeling which makes me sure that I shall not wholly die, makes me refuse to believe that ï shall live wholly as I do now. Yet, Lionel, пел er, never, can I love any but you ; through eternity I must desire your society ; and, as I am inno-
cent of harm to others, and as relying and con¬ fident as my mortal nature permits, I trust that the Ruler of the world will never tear u** asunder.' 1 *' Your remarks are like yourself, dear love, ' replied I, ťt gentle and good ; let us cheribh such a belief, and dismiss anxiety nom oui minds. But, sweet, we are so formed, (anil there is no sin, if God made our nature, to yield to what he ordains), we are =ю foi med, that wc must lo^ e life, and cling to it ; we must lo\ e the living smile, the sympathetic touch, and thrilling voice, peculiar to our mortal mecha¬ nism. Let us not, through security in hereafter, neglect the present. This present moment, short as it is, is a part of eternity, and the dearest part, since it is our own unahenably Thou, the hope of my futurity, art my prebent joy. Let me then look on thy dear e>es, and, reading love in them, drink intoxicating plea¬ sure. 0 Timidly, for my vehemence somewhat terrified
her, Idris looked on me. My eyes were blood¬ shot, starting from my head ; every artery beat, methought, audibly, every muscle throbbed, each single nerve felt. Her look of wild af¬ fright told me, that I could no longer keep my secret:—" So it is, mine own beloved," I said, 4e the last hour of many happy ones is arrived, nor can wo shun any longer the inevitable destiny. I cannot live long—but, again and again, I say, this moment is ours V Paler than marble, with white lips and con¬ vulsed features, Idris became aware of my situa¬ tion. My arm, as I sat, encircled her waist, she feit the palm bum with fever, even on the heart it pressed :—" One moment," 11 she murmured, scarce audibly, " only one moment."— She kneeled, and hiding her face in her hands, uttered a brief, but earnest prayer, that she might fulfil her duty, and watch over me to the last. While there was hope, the agony bad been unendurable ;—all was now concluded ; her feelings became solemn and calm. Even as
Epicharis, unperturbeel and firm, submitted to the instruments of torture, did Idris, suppressing every sigh and sign of grief, enter upon the endurance of torments, of which the rack anel the wheel arc but faint and metaphysical sym¬ bols. I was changed ; the tight-drawn corei that sounded so harshly was loosened, the moment that Idris participated in my knowledge of our real situation. The perturbed and passion- tossed waves of thought subsieled, leaving only the heavy swell that kept right on without any outward manifestation of its disturbance, till it should break on the remote shore towards which I rapidly advanced :— ifi It is true that I am sick," I said, " anel your society, my Idris, is my only medicine ; come, and sit beside me." She made me lie down o'.; the couch, and, drawing a low ottoman near, sat close to my pillow, pressing my burning hanels in her cold palms. S.*ie yielded to my feverish restlessness, and let me talk, and talkeel to me, on subjects
btrange indeed to beings, who thus looked the last, and heard the last, of w hat they loved alone in the world. We talked of times gone by ; of the happy period of our early lo\e; of Ray¬ mond, Perdita, and Evadne. We talked of what might arise on this desert earth, if, two or three beiii£ saved, it were slowly re-peopled. —We talked of what was beyond the toni b , andj man in hi» human shape being nearlv ex¬ tinct, we felt with certainty of faith, that other spirits, other шпнЦ other peiceptive beings, sightless to us, niut-t people with thought and love this beauteous and imperishable unnerve We talked-—I know not how long—but, m the morning I awoke from a painful heavy slumber; the pale cheek of Idris rested on my piliow ; the large orbs of her eyes half raised the h'ds, anel shewed the deep blue lights beneath ; her hps were unclosed, and the slight murmurs they formed told that, even while asleep, she buffered. " If she were dead," I thought, " what difference? now that form is the tem-
pie of a residing deity ; those eyes are the win¬ dows of her soul ; all grace, love, and intelli¬ gence are throned on that lovely bosom—were she dead, where would this mind, the dearer half of mine, be? For quickly the fair propor¬ tion of this edifice would be more defaced, than are the sand-choked ruins of the desert temples of Palmyra.
CHxVPTER III.
Imtis stirred and awoke; alas ! she awoke to misery. She saw the signs of disease on my countenance, and wondered how she could per¬ mit the long night to pass without her having sought, not cure, that was impossible, but alle¬ viation to my sufferings. She called Adrian ; my couch was quickly surrounded by friends and assistants, and such medicines as were judged fitting were administered. It was the peculiar and dreadful distinction of our visi¬ tation, that none who had been attacked by the pestilence had recovered. The first symp¬ tom of the disease was the death-warrant, which in no single instance had been followed
by pardon or reprieve. No gleam of hope therefore cheered my friends. While fever producing torpor, heavy pains, bitting like lead on my limbs, and making my breast heave, were upon me ; I continued insen¬ sible to every thing but pain, and at last even to that. I awoke on the fourth morning as from л dreamless sleep. An irritating sense of thirst, and, when I strove to speak or move, an entire dereliction of power, was all I felt. For three clays and nights Idris had not moved from my side. She administered to all my wants, and never slept nor rested. She did not hope ; and therefore she neither endeavoured to read the physician's countenance, nor to watch for symptoms of recovery. All her thought was to attend on me to the last, and dien to lie down and die beside me. On the third night animation was suspended ; to the eye and touch of all I was dead. With earnest prayer, almost with force, Adrian tried to draw Idris from me. He exhausted every adjura-
tion, her child's welfare and his own. She shook her head, and wiped a stealing tear from her sunk cheek, but would not yield ; she entreated to be allowed to watch me that one night only- wit h such affliction and meek earnestness, that she gained her point, and sat silent and motion¬ less, except when, stung by intolerable remem¬ brance, she kissed my closed eyes and pallid lips, and pressed my stiffening hands to her beatincr heart. At dead of night, when, though it was mid winter, the cock crowed at three o'clock, as he¬ rald of the mornino- change, while hanging over me, and mourning in silent, bitter thought for the loss of all of love towards her that had been enshrined in my heart ; her dishevelled hair hung over her face, and the long tresses fell on the bed ; she saw one ringlet in motion, and the scattered hair slightly stirred, as by a breath. It is not so, she thought, for he will never breathe more. Several times the same thing occurred, and she only marked it by the same
reflection; tül the whole ringlet waved back, and she thought she saw my breast hea\e. Her first emotion was deadly fear, cold dew stood on her brow ; my eyes !ľdf opened ; and. re-assured, she would have exclaimed, ť; He lives !" but the words w r ere choked by a spasm, and she fell with a groan on the floor. Adrian was in the chamber. After long watching, he had unwillingly fallen into a sleep. He started up, and beheld his sister senseless on the earth, weltering in a stream of blood that gibhed from her mouth. Encreasing signs of life in me in some degree explained her state ; the surprise, the burst of joy, the revulsion of every sentiment, had been too much for her frame, worn by long months of care, late shat¬ tered by every species of woe and toil. She was now in far greater danger than I, the wheels and springs of my life, once again set in motion, acquired elasticity from theii short suspenzom For a long time, no one believed that I ¡should indeed continue to live ; during the reign of the
plague upon earth, not one person, attacked by the trrim disease, had recovered. IVI y restora- tion wa.s looked on as a deception ; e\cry moment it was expected that the evil symptoms would recur with redoubled λ iolence. until confirmed convalescence, absence of all fe\er or pain, and encreasing strength, brought blow conriction that I had recovered from the plague. The restoration of Idrb was more problemati¬ cal. When I had been attacked bv illness, her cheeks were sunk, her form emaciated; but now, the \essel, which had. broken from the effects of extreme agitation, did not entirely heal, but was as a channel that drop by drop drew from her the ruddy stream that \ i\ died her heart. Her hollow eyes aud worn countenance had a ghastly appearance ; her cheek-bones, her open fair brow, the projection of the mouth, stood fearfully prominent ; you might tell each bone in the thin anatomy of her frame. Her hand hung powerless ; each joint lay hare, so tliat the light penetrated through and through.
It was strange that life could exist in what was wasted and worn into a very type of death. To take her from these heart-breaking scenes, to lead her to forget the world's desolation in the variety of objects presented by travelling, and to nurse her failing strength in the mild climate towards which we had resolved to journey, was my last hope for her preservation. The preparations for our departure, which had been suspended during my illness, were re¬ newed. I did not ι e\ ive to doubtful convales¬ cence ; health spent her treasures upon me ; as the tree in spring may feel from its wrinkled limbs the fresh green break forth, and the liv¬ ing saj) lise and circulate, so did the renewed vigour of my frame, the cheerful current of my blood, the new-born elasticity of my limbs, in¬ fluence iny mind to cheerful endurance and pleasurable thoughts. l\!y body, late the heavy weight tliat bound me to the tomb, was ex- uberant with health ; mere common exercises.
were insufficient for my reviving strength ; me¬ thought I could emulate the speed of the race¬ horse, discern through tlie air objects at a blind¬ ing distance, hear the operations of nature in her mute abodes ; my senses had become so re¬ fined and susceptible after my recovery from mortal disease. Hope, among my other blessings, was not denied to me ; and I did fondly trust that my unwearied attentions would restore my adoied girl. I w as therefore eager to forward our pre¬ parations. According to the plan first laid down, we were to have quitted London on the twenty-fifth of' November; and, in pursuance of this scheme, two-thirds of our people — ¿he people ■ all ihat remained of England, had gone lonvard, and had already been some weeks in Paris. First my illness, and subsequently that of Idris, had detained Adrian with his division, which consisted of three hundred persons, so that we now departed on the first of January, 2098. It was my wish to keep Idris as
distant as possible from the hurry and clamour of the crowd, and to hide from her those ap¬ pearances that would remind her most forcibly of our real situation. We separated ourselves to a great degree from Adrian, who was obliged to give his whole time to public business. The Countess of Windsor travelled with her son. Clara, Evelyn, and a female who acted as our at¬ tendant, were the only persons with whom we had contact. We occupied a commodious carriage, our servant officiated as coachman. A party of about twenty persons preceded us at a small distance. They had it in charge to prepare our halting places and our nightly abode 1 . They had been selected for this service out of a great number that offered, on account of the superior sagacity of the man who had been appointed their leader. Immediately on our departure, I was de¬ lighted to find a change in Idris, which I fondly hoped prognosticated the happiest results. All the cheerfulness and gentle gaiety natural to
her revived. She was weak, and this alteration was rather displayed in looks and voice than in acts ; but it was permanent and real. My reco¬ very from the plague and confirmed health instil¬ led into her a firm belief that I was now secure from this dread enemy. She told me that she was sure she should recover. That she had a presentiment, that the tide of calamity which deluged our unhappy race had now turned. That the remnant would be preserved, and among them the dear objects of her tender affection ; and that in some selected spot we should wear out our lives together in pleasant society u Do not let my state of feebleness deceive you,' 1 she said ; " I feel that I am better ; there is a quick life within me, and a spirit of anticipation that assures me, that I shall continue long to make a part of this world. I shall throw oif this degrading weakness of body, which infects even my mind with debility, and I shall enter again on the performance of my duties. 1 was sorry to leave Windsor: but
now I am weaned from this local attachment ; I am content to remove to a milel climate, which will complete my recovery. Trust me, elearest, I shall neither leave you, nor my brother, nor these dear children ; my firm extermination to remain with you to the last, and to continue to contribute to your happiness and welfare, would keep me alive, even if grim death were nearer at hand than he really is. 1 ' I was only half re-assureel by these expres¬ sions ; I could not believe that the over-ouick flow of her blood was a sign of health, or that her burning cheeks denoted convalescence. But I hael no fears of an immediate catastrophe ; nay, I persuaded myself that she would ulti¬ mately recover. And thus cheerfulness reigned in our little society. leiris conversed with ani¬ mation on a thousand topics. Her chief desire w r as to lead our thoughts from melancholy re¬ flections ; so she drew charming pictures of a tranquil solitud^, of a beauteous retreat, of the simple manners of our little trihe, anil of the
patriarchal brotherhood of love, which would survive the ruins of the populous nations which had lately existed. We shut out from our thoughts the present, anei withdrew our eyes from the dreary landscape we traversed. Winter reigneel in all its gloom. The leafless trees lav without motion against the elun sky ; the forms of freist, mimicking the foliage of summer, strew ed the ground ; the paths were overgrown ; the un¬ ploughed cornfields were patched with grass and wccelb ; the sheep congregated at the threshold of the cottage, the horned ox thrust his head from the window. The wind was bleak, and frequent sleet or snow-storms, adeleel to the me¬ lancholy appearance wintry nature assumed. Wo arrived at Rochester, and an accident causeel us to be detained there a day. During that lime, a circumstance occurred that changed our plans, and which, alas ! in its result changed the eternal course of events, turning me from the pleasant new sprung hope I enjoyed, to an obscure and gloomy desert. But I must give vol. m. F
some little explanation before I proceed with the final cause of our temporary alteration of plan, and refer again to those times when man walked the earth fearless, before Plague had become Queen of the World. There resided a family in the neighbourhood of Windsor, of very humble pretensions, but which had been an object of interest to us on account of one of the persons of whom it was composed. The family of the Claytons had known better days ; but, after a series of reverses, the father died a bankrupt, and the mother heart¬ broken, and a confirmed invalid, retired with her five children to a little cottage between Eton and Salt Hill. The eldest of these children, who was thirteen years old, seemed at once from the influence of adversity, to acquire the sagacity and principle belonging to a more mature age. Her mother grew worse and worse in health, but Lucy attended on her, and was as a tender pa¬ rent to her younger brothers and sisters, and in the meantime shewed herself so good-humoured,
social, and benevolent, that she was beloved as well as honoured, in her little neighbourhood. Lucy was besides extremely pretfy ; so ,vhen she grew to be sixteen, it «'2·- ΐϋ Ιλ ¡supposed, notwithstanding !u-r poverty, that shf should have admirers. One of these was the son of a country-curate ; he was a generous, frank-hearted youth, with an ardent love of knowledge, and no mean acquirements. Though Lucy was untaught, her mother's conversation and man¬ ners gave her a taste for refinements superior to her present situation. She loved the youth even without knowing it, except that in any difficulty she naturally turned to him for aid, and awoke with a lighter heart every Sunday, because she knew that she would be met and accompanied by him in her evening walk with her sisters. She had another admirer, one of the head-waiters at the inn at Salt Hill. He also was not without pretensions to urbane superiority, such as he learnt from gentlemen's servants and waiting- maids, who initiating him in all the slang of high
life below stairs, rendered his arrogant temper ten times more intrusive. Lucy du' not disclaim him-— she was incapable of that feeling; bvit she was sorry when she saw him approach, and quietly resisted all his endeavours to establish an intimacy. The fellow soon discovered that his rival was preferred to him ; and this changed what was at first a chance admiration into a passion, whose main springs were envy, and a base desire to deprive his competitor of the ad¬ vantage he enjoyed over himself. Poor Lucy^s sad story was but a common one. Her lover's father died ; and he was left destitute, He accepted the offer of a gentleman to ςο to India with him, feeling secure that he should soon acquire an independence, and return to claim the hand of his beloved. He became in¬ volved in the war carried on there, was taken prisoner, and years elapsed before tidings of his existence were received in his native land. In the meantime disastrous poverty came on Lucy, Her little cottage, which stood looking from its
trellicc, covered with woodbine and jessamine, was burnt down ; and the whole of their little property was included in the destruction. Whither betake them ? By what exertion of industry could Lucy procure them another abode? Her mother nearly bed-rid, could not survive any extreme of famine-struck poverty. At this time her other admirer stept forward, and renewed his offer of marriage. He had saved money, and was going to set up a little inn ãt Datchet. There was nothing alluring to Lucy in this offer, except the home it secured to her mother ; and she felt more sure of this, since she was struck by the apparent generosity which occasioned the present offer. She accepted it ; thus sacrificing herself for the comfort and wel¬ fare of her parent. It was some years after her marriage that we became acquainted with her. The accident of a storm caused us to take refuge in the inn, where we witnessed the brutal and quarrelsome be¬ haviour of her husband, and hi?r patient endu-
ranee. Her lot was not a fortunate oue. Her first lover had returned with the hope of making her his own, and met her by accident, for the first time, as the mistress of this country inn, and the wife of another. He withdrew despair¬ ingly to foreign parts ; nothing went well with him ; at last he enlisted, and came back again wounded and sick, and yet Lucy was debarred from nursing him. Her husband's brutal dispo¬ sition was aggravated by his yielding to the many temptations held out by his situation, and the consequent disarrangement of his affairs. Fortunately she had no children ; but her heart was bound up in her brothers and sisters, and these his avarice and ill temper soon drove from the house ; they were dispersed about the coun¬ try, earning their livelihood with toil and care, lie even bhewed an inclination to get rid of her mother-—but Lucy was firm here^—she had sa¬ crificed herself for her ; îdıe lived for her—she would not part with her—if the mother went, she would also go—beg bread for her, die with her s
but never desert her. The presence of Lucy was too necessary in keeping up the order of the house, and in preventing the whole establishment from going to wreck, for him to permit her to leave him. He yielded the point; but in all ac¬ cesses of anger, or in his drunken fits, he re¬ curred to the old topic, and stung poor Lucy's heart by opprobrious epithets bestowed on her parent. A passion however, if it be wholly pure, en¬ tire, and reciprocal, brings „ith it its own solace. Lucy was truly, and from the depth of heart, devoted to her mother ; the sole end she pro¬ posed to herself in life, was the comfort and preservation of this parent. Though she griev ed for the result, yet she did not repent of her marriage, even when her lover returned to be¬ stow competence on her. Three years had in¬ tervened, and how r , in their pennyless state, could her mother have existed during this time ? '1 bi« excellent woman was worthy of her child's de¬ votion. A perfect confidence and friendship ex-
stcd between them ; besides, she was by no means illiterate ; and Lucy, whose mind had been in some degree cultivated by her former lo\er, now found in her the only person who could understand and appreciate her. Thus, though suffering, she was by no means desolate. and w hen, during fine summer days, she led her mother into the floweiy and shady lanes near their abode, a gleam of unmixed joy enlightened her countenance; she saw that her parent was happ), and she knew that this happmess was of her sole creating. Meanwhile her husband's affairs grew more and more involved; ruin was near at hand, and she was about to lose the fruit of all her labours when pestilence came to change the aspect of the world. Her husband reaped benefit from the mineral misery, but, as the disaster tnciea^ed, the spit it of lawlessness seized hun, he descited Ыь home to revel m the luxuiies promised him in London, and iound theie a grave. Iler fonner lener had
been one of the first victims of the disease. But Lucy continued to live for and in her mother. Her courage only failed when she dreaded peril for her parent, or feared that death might prevent her from performing those duties to which she was unalterably devoted. When we had quitted Windsor for London, as the previous step to our hnal emigration, we visited Lucy, and arranged with her the plan of her own and her mother's removal. Lucy was sorry at lhe necessity which forced lier to quit her native lanes and village, and to drag an infirm parent from her comforts at home, to the homeless waste of depopulate earth ; but she vvas too well disciplined by adversity, and of too sweet a temper, to indulge in repini ngs at what was inevitable. Subsequent circumstances, my illness and that of Idris, drove her from our remembrance ; and we called her to mind at last, only to conelude that she made one of the few wdio came from Windsor to join the emigrants, and that she was already к íí
in Paris. When we arrived at Rochester therefore, we were surprised to receive, by a man just с >me from Slough, a letter from this exemplary sufferer. His account was, that, journeying from his home, and passing through Datchet, he was surprised to see smoke issue from the chimney of the inn, and supposing that he should find comrades for his journey assembled there, he knoci 1 and was admitted. There was no one in the house but Lucy, and her mother ; the latter had been deprived of the use of her limbs by an attack of rheuma¬ tism, and so, one by one, all the remaining inha¬ bitants of the country set forward, leaving them alone. Lucy intreated the man to stay with her; in a week or two her mother would be better, and they would then set out; but they must perish, if they were left thus helpless and forlorn. The man said, that his wife and chil¬ dren were already among the emigrants, and it was therefore, according to his notion, impossible for him to remain. Lucy, as a last resource, gave
Jiim a letter for Idris, to be delivered to her wherever he should meet us. This commission at least he fulfilled, and Idris received with emotion the following letter ; — *' Honoured Lady, " I am sure that you will remember and pity me, and I dare hope that you will assist mc ; what other hope have I ? Pardon my manner of writing, I am so bewildered. A month ago my dear mother was deprived of the use of her limbs. She is already better, and in another month would I am sure be able to tra¬ vel, in the way you were so kind as to say you would arrange for us. But now everybody is gone—everybody—as they went away, each said, that perhaps my mother would be better, before we were quite deserted. But three days ago I went to Samuel Woods, who, on account of his new-born child, remained to the last ; and there being a large family of them, I thought I could persuade them to wait a little longer for us;
but I found the house deserted. I have not seen a soul since, till this good man came.^—- What will become of us ? My mother does not know our state ; she is so ill, that I have hidden it from her. i( Will you not send some one to us ? 1 am sure we must perish miserably as we are. if 1 were to try to move my mother now, she would die on the road ; and if, when she gets better, I were able, ï cannot guess how, to find out the roads, and get on so many many miles to the sea, you would all be in Prance, and the great oeean would be between us, which is so terrible even to sailors. What would it be to me, a woman, who never saw it ? We should be imprisoned by it in this country, all, all alone, with no help ; better die where we are. I can hardly vvrite—1 cannot stop my tears—it is not for myself; 1 could put my (rust in God; and let the worst come, 1 think I could bear it, if I were alone.

This letter deeply affected Idris, and she in¬ stantly proposed, that we should return to Datchet, to assist Lucy and her mother. I said that I would without delay set out for that place, but entreated her to join her brother, and there await mv return with the children. But Idris was in m/ high spirits, and full of hope. She declared tliat «he could not consent even to a temporary sepa¬ ration from me, but that there was no need of this, die motion of the carriage did her good, and tlie distance was too trifling to be con&idered. We could dispatch messengers to Adrian, to inform him of our deviation from the original plan. She spoke with vivacity, and drew a picture after her own dear heart, of the pleasure we should bestow upon Lucy, and declared, if I went, she must accompany me, and that she should very much dislike to entrust the charge of rescuing them to others, who might fulfil it with coldness or inhumanity. Lucy's life had been one act of devotion and virtue ; let her now reap the small reward of finding her excellence
appreciated, and her necessity assisted, by those whom she respected and honoured. These, and many other arguments, were urged with gentle pertinacity, and the ardour of a wish to do all the good in her power, by her wdiose simple expression of a desire and slight¬ est request had ever been a law with me. I, of course^ consented, the moment that I saw that she had set her heart upon this step. We sent half our attendant troop on to Adrian ; and with the other half our carriage took a retrograde course back to Windsor. I wonder now how I could be so blind and senseless, as thus to risk the safety of Idris ; for, if I had eyes, surely I could see the sure, though deceitful, advance of death in her burning cheek and encreasing weakness. But she said she was better ; and I believed her. Extinction could not be near a being, whose vivacity and intelligence hourly encreased, and whose frame was endowed with an intense, and I fondly
thought, a strong and permanent spirit of life. Who, after a great disaster, has not looked back with wonder at his inconceivable obtuseness of understanding, that could not perceive the many minute threaels with which fate weaves the inextricable net of our eiestinies, until he is inmesheel completely in it ? The cross roads which we now entered upon, were even in a worse state than the long neg¬ lected high-ways ; and the inconvenience seemed to menace the perishing frame of Idris with ele- struction. Passing through Dartford, we arrived at Hampton on the second day. Even in this short interval my beloved companion grew sensibly worse in health, though her spirits were still light, and she cheered my growing anxiety with gay sallies; sometimes the thought pierced my brain—Is she dying?—as I saw her fair neshless hand rest on mine, or observed the feebleness with which she performed the accus¬ tomed acts of life. I drove away the idea, as if
it had been suggested by insanity; but it occurred agam and again, onl\ to be dispelled by the continued liveliness of her manner. About mid-day, after quitting Hampton, our carriage broke down: the shock caused Idns to faint, but on her rev iv ing no other ill consequence ensued ; our party of attendants had as usual gone on before us, and our coachman went m ■search of another \chicle, oui former one being rendered by this accident unii t for service. The onlv place near us was a poor -village, in which he found a kmd of cara\ an, able to hold four people, but it was clumsy лпа ill hung; besides this he found а л cry excellent cabriolet: our plan was soon ai ranged , I would chive Idris in the latter ; while the children were conveyed by the sei \ ant m the former. But these arranee- ments cost time; we had agiecd to proceed that night lo Windsor, and thither our purveyors» had gone: u e should find considerable difficulty in getting accommodation, before we reached this place; after all, the distance wat» oni} ten miles;
my horse was a good one ; I would go forward at a good pace with Idris, leaving the children to follow at a rate more consonant to the uses of their cumberous machine. Evening closed in quickly, far more quickly than I was prepared to expect. At the going down of the sun it began to snow heavily. I attempted in vain to defend my beloved com¬ panion from the storm; the wind drove the snow in our faces; and it lay so high on the ground, that we made but small way ; while the night was so dark, that but for the white covering on the ground we should not have been able to see a yard before us. We had left our accompany¬ ing caravan far behind us ; and now I perceived that the storm had made me unconsciously deviate from my intended route. I liad gone some miles out of my way. My knowledge of the country enabled me to regain the right road ; but, instead of going, as at first agreed upon, by a cross road through Stanwcll to Datchet, I was obliged to take the way of Egham and
Bishopsgate. It was certain therefore that I should not be rejoined by the other vehicle, that I shoulel not meet a single fellow-creature till we arrived at Windsor. The back of our carriage was drawn up, and I hung a pelisse before it, thus to curtain the beloved sufferer from the pelting sleet. She leaneel on my shoulder, growing every moment more languiel and feeble ; at first she replied to my words of cheer with affectionate thanks; but by degrees she sunk into silence ; her head lay heavily upon me ; I only knew that she lived by her irregular breathing anel frequent sighs. For a moment I resolved to stop, and, op¬ posing the back of the cabriolet to the force of the tempest, to expect morning as well as I might. But the wind was bleak and piercing, while the occasional shudderings of my poor Idris, and the intense cold I felt myself, de¬ monstrated that this would be a dangerous experi¬ ment At length methought she slept—fatal sleep, induced by frost : at this moment I saw the
heavy outline of a cottage traced on the dark horizon close to us: " Dearest love," I said, u support yourself but one moment, and we shall have shelter ; let us stop here, that 1 may open the door of this blessed dwelling."" А л I spoke, my heart was transported, and my senses swam with excessive delight and thankfulness; I placed the head of Idris against the carriage, and, leaping out, scrambled through the snow to the cottage, whose door was open. I had apparatus about me for pro¬ curing light, and that shewed me a comfortable room, with a pile of wood in one corner, and no appearance of disorder, except that, the door having been left partly open, the snow, drifting in, had blocked up the threshold. I returned to the carriage, and the sudden change from light to darkness at first blinded me. When I recovered my sight—eternal God of this lawless world ! О supreme Death ! î will not disturb thy .»ilent reign, or mar my tale with fruitless excla¬ mations of horror—I saw Idris, who had fallen
from the seat to the bottom of the carriage ; her head, its long hair pendent, with one arm, hung over the side.—Struck by a spasm of horror, ï lifted her up; her heart was pulseless, her faded lips unfanncd by the slightest breath. I carried her into the cottage ; I placed her on the bed. Lighting a fire, I chafed her stiffening limbs; for two long hours I sought torestore departed life; and, when hope was as dead as my beloved, I closed with trembling hands her glazed eyes. I did not doubt what I should now do. In the confusion attendant on my illness, the task of interrili»; our darling Alfred had devolved on his grandmother, the Ex-Queen, and she, true to her rulmg passion, had caused him to be carried to Windsor, and buried in the family vault, in St. George's Chapel. I must proceed to Windsor, to calm the anxiety (if Clara, who «ould wait anxiously for us—vet I would fain spare her the heart-breaking spectacle of Idris, brought in by mc lifeless from the
journey. So fibt I would place my beloved beside her child in the vault, and then *eck the poor children who would be expecting me, I lighted the lamp* of my carriage ; I wrapt her in f uTs, and placed her along the seat ; then taking the reins, made the hordes go forward. We proceeded through the snow, which lay in masses impeding the way, w hile the descending flakes, driving against me with redoubled furv, blinded mc. The pain occasioned by the angry element·-, and the cold iron of tir shafts of frost which bufľetted me, and entered my aching flesh, were a relief to me ; blunting my mental suffer¬ ing. The horses staggered on, and the reins hung Joostly iu m\ liando. I often thought I would la\ my head close to the bweet, cold face of mv lost angel, and thus resign myself to con¬ quering torpor. Yet I must not leave her a prey to the fowls of the air; but, in pursuance of my determination place her in the tomb of her
forefathers, where a merciful God might permit me to rest also. The road we passed through Egham was familiar to me; but the wind and snow caused the horses to drag their load slowly and heavily. Suddenly the wind veered from south-west to west, and then again to north-west. As Samp¬ son with tug and strain stirred from their bases the columns that supported the Philistine temple, so did the gale shake the dense vapours propped on the horizon, while the massy dome of clouds fell to the .south, disclosing through the scattered web the clear empyrean, and the little stars, which were set at an immeasurable distance in the crystalline fields showered their smali ravs on the glittering snow. Even the hor c es were cheered, and moved on with renovated Чгсп^Ь. We entered the forest at Ih shopgate, imã at the end of the Long Walk I *aw the Cattle, iv the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers. 1 ' I looked with reve-
rence on a structure, ancient almost as the rock on which it ste>od, abode of kings, theme of ad¬ miration for tlie wise. With greater reverence and tearful affection I beheld it, аь the asylum of the long lease of love 1 had enjoyen! there with the perishable, unmatchablc treasure oi' dust, which now lay cold beside me. Now indeed, I could have yielded to all the softness of mv nature, and wept; and, womanlike, have uttereel bitter plaint«; while the familiar trees, the herds of living deer, the s ward oft prest bv her fair ν feet, one by one with sail association presented themselves. The white gate at the end of the Long Walk was vv iele open, and í rode \ψ the empty town through the fir&t gate of the feudal tower; and now St. George's Chapel, with its blackened fretted sides, was rillit before me. 1 halted at its door, which uns opun; I entered. and placed m> lighted lamp on the altar; then I returned, and with tender caution 1 bote Idns up the ai&Ie into the chancel, and laid Ыт *-efti\ down on the carpet which eovereel the sup
leading to the communion table. The banners of the knights of the garter, and their half drawn swords, were hung in vain emblazonry above the stalls. The banner of her family hung tiiere, still surmounted by its regal crown. Farewell to the glory and heraldry of England ! — 1 turned from such vanity with a slight feel¬ ing of wonder, at how mankind could have ever been interested in such things. I bent over the lifeless, corpse of my beloved; and, while looking on her uncovered face, the features already con¬ tracted by the rigidity of death, I felt as if all the visible universe had grown as soulless, inane, and comfortless, as the clav-cold imao'c beneath me. I felt for a moment the intolerable sense of struggle witli, and denestation for, the laws which govern the world; till the calm still visible on the face of my dead love recalled me to a more soothing tone of mind, and I proceed¬ ed to fulfil the last office that could now be paid her For her I could not lament, so much I vol. ти. f
envied her enjoyment of " the sad immunities of the grave. 1 ' The vault had been lately opened to place our Alfred therein. The ceremony customary in these latter days had been cursorily performed, and the pavement of the chapel, which was its entrance, having been removed, had not been replaced. I descended tbe steps, and walked through the long passage to the large vault which contained tbe kindred dust of my Idris. I dis¬ tinguished the small coffin of my babe. With hasty, trembling hands I constructed a bier beside it, spreading it with the furs and Indian shawls, which had wrapt Idris in her journey thither. 1 lighted the glimmering lamp, which flickered in this damp abode of the dead ; then I bore my lost one to her last bed, decently com¬ posing her limbs, and covering them with a mantle, veiling all except her face, which re¬ mained lovely and placid. She appeared to rest like one over-weaned, her beauteous eyes steeped
in sweet slumber. Yet, so it was not she was dead ! How intensely I then longed to lie down beside her, to gaze till death should gather me to the same repose. But death does not come at the bidding of the miserable. I had lately recovered from mortal illness, and my blood had never flowed with such an even current, nor had my limbs ever been ъо instinct with quick life, as now. I felt that my death must be voluntary. Yet what more natural than famine, as I watched in this cham¬ ber of mortality, placed in a world of the dead, beside the lost hope of my life ? Meanwhile as I looked on her, the features, which bore a sisterly resemblance to Adrian, brought my thought back again to the living, to this dear friend, to Clara, and to Evelyn, who were probably now in Windsor, waiting anxiously for our arrival. Methought I heard a noise, a step in the far chapel, which was re-echoed by its vaulted roof, and borne to me through ttie hollow passages. Had Clara seen my carriage pass up the town, F 2
and did she seek me here ? I mus^t save her at least from the horrible scene the vault presented. I sprung up the steps, and then saw a female figure, bent with age. and clad in long mourning robes, advance through the dusky chapel, sup¬ ported by a slender cane, yet tottering even\with this support. She heard me, and looked up ; the lamp 1 held illuminated my figure, and the moon-beams, struggling through the painted glass, fell upon her face, wrinkled and gaunt. yet with a piercing eye and commanding brow— I recognized the Countess of Windsor. With a hollow voice she asked, " Where is the prin- cess r I pointed to the torn up pavement : she walked to the spot, and looked down into the palpable darkness ; for the vault was too distant for the rays of the small lamp I had left there to be discernible. ťí Your light," she said. I gave it her; and she regarded the now visible, but precipitous steps, as if calculating her capacity to descend.
Instinctively I made a silent offer of my assist¬ ance. She motioned me away with a look of scorn, saying in an harsh voice, as she pointed downwards, " There at least I mav have her un- disturbed." She walked deliberately down, while I, over¬ come, miserable beyond words, or tears, or groans, threw myself on the pavement near— the stiffening form of Idris was before me, the death-struck countenance hushed in eternal repose beneath. That was to me the end of all í The day before, I had figured to my¬ self various adventures, and communion with my fi iends in after time—now I had leapt ihe interval, and reached the utmost edge and bourne of life. Thus wrapt in gloom, enclosed, wailed up, vaulted over by the omnipotent puesent, I was startled by the sound of feet on the steps of the tomb, and I remembered her whom I had utterly forgotten, my angry visitant; her tall form slowly rose upwards from the vault, a living statue, instinct with
hate, and human, passionate strife : she seemed to me as having reached the pavement of the cu.de ; she stood motionless, seeking with her eyes alone, some desired object—till, perceiv¬ ing me close to her, she placed her wrinkled hand on my arm, exclaiming with tremulous accents, (i Lionel Verney, my son !" This name, applied at such a moment by my angel's mother, instilled into me more respect than I had ever before felt for this disdainful lady. I bowed my head, and kissed her shrivelled hand, and, remarking that she trembled violently, sup¬ ported her to the end of the chancel, where she sat on the steps that led to the regal stall. She suffered herself to be led, and still holding my hand, she leaned her head back against the stall, while the moon beams, tinged with various colours by the painted glass, fell on her glisten¬ ing eves ; aware of her weakness, again calling to mind her long cherished dignity, she dashed the tears away ; yet they fell fast, as she said, for excuse, iC She is so beautiful and placid,
even in death. No harsh feeling ever clouded her serene brow ; how did I treat her? wound¬ ing her gentle heart with savage coldness; I had no compassion on her in past years, does she forgive me now? Little, little does it boot to talk of repentance and forgiveness to the dead, had I during her life once consulted her gentle wishes, and curbed my rugged na¬ ture to do her pleasure, I should not feel th из.'" Idris and her mother were unlike in per¬ son. The dark hair, deep-set black eyes, and prominent features of the Ex-Queen were in entire contrast to the golden tresses, the full blue orbs, and the soft lines and contour of her daughter's countenance. Yet, in latter days, illness had taken from my poor girl the full outline of her face, and reduced it to the in¬ flexible shape of the bone beneath. In the form of her brow, in her oval chin, there was to lie found a resemblance to her mother ; nay in some moods, their gestures were not unlike;
nor, having lived so long together, was this wonderful. There is a magic power in resemblance. When one we love dies, we hope to see them in another state, and half expect that the agency of mind will inform its new garb in imitation of its decayed earthly vesture. But these are ideas of the mind only. We know that the instrument is shi\ered, the sensible image lies in miserable fragments, dissolved to dusty no¬ thingness ; a look, a gesture, or a fashioning of the limbs similar to the dead in a living person, touches a thrilling chord, whose sacred har¬ mony is fe 7 in the hearťs dearest recess. Strangely moved, prostrate before this spectral image, and enslaved by the force of blood mani¬ fested in likeness of look and movement, I remained trembling in the presence of the harsh, proud, and till now unloved mother of Idris, Poor, mistaken woman! in her tendei est
mood before, she had cherished the idea, that a word, a look of reconciliation from her, would be received with joy, and repay long years of severity. Now that the time was gone for the exercise of such power, she fell at once upon the thorny truth of things, and felt that neither smile nor caress could penetrate to the uncon¬ scious statCj or influence the happiness of her who lay in the vault beneath. This conviction, together with the remembrance of soft replies to bitter speeches, of gentle looks repaying angry glances ; the perception of the falsehood, paltry- ness and futility of her cherished dreams of birth and power ; the overpowering knowledge, that love and life were the true emperors of our mortal state; all, as a tide, rose, and filled her soul with itormy and bewildering confusion. It fell to my lot, to come as the influential power, to allay the fierce tossing of these tumul¬ tuous waves.

With ardent and overflowing eloquence, I re¬ lieved my heart from iti burthen, and awoke to the sense of a new pleasure in life, as I poured forth the funeral eulogy. Then I referred to Adrian, her loved brother, and to her surviv¬ ing child. I declared, which I had before almost forgotten, what my duties uere with regard to these valued portions of herself, and bade the melancholy repentant mother reflect, how- she could best expiate unkindness tow ards the dead, by redoubled love of the survivors. Con¬ soling her, my own sorrows were assuaged; my sincerity won her entire conviction. She turned to me. The hard, inflexible, per¬ secuting woman, turned with a mild expression of face, and said, "If our beloved angel sees иъ now, it will delight her to find that I do )ou even tardy justice. You were worthy of her; and ггош my heart I am glad that you won
her away from me. Pardon, my son, the many wrongs I have done you; forget my bitter words and unkind treatment—take me 3 and go¬ vern nie as you will." 1 seized this docile moment to propose our departure from the church. " First," 1 ' she said, " let us replace the pavement above the vault."* Λ Ve drew near to it ; * c Shall we look on her again ?''

We need not torture ourselves by gazing on the soulless body, while her living spirit is buried quick in our hearts, and her surpassing loveliness is so deeply carved there, that sleeping or waking she must ever be present to us.'' For a few moments, we bent in solemn silence over the open vault. I consecrated my future life, to the embalming of her dear memory ; I vowed to serve her brother and her child till death. The convulsive sob of my companion made me break off' my internal orisons. I next
dragged the stones over the entrance of the tomb, and closed the gulph that contained the* life of my life. Then, supporting my decrepid fellow-mourner, we slowly left the chapel. í felt, as í stepped into the open air, as if I ha · quitted an happy nest of repose, for a dreary wilderness, a tortuous path, a bitter, joyless hopelos pilgrimage.
С ПАР ТЕК IV.
Or r escort had been directed to prepare our ¿diode for the night at the inn, opposite the ascent to the Castle. We could not again visit the halls and familiar chambers of our home 1 , on a mere visit. We had already left for ever the glades of Windsor, and all of coppice, flower\ hedgerow, and murmuring stream, which gave shape and intensity to the love of our country, and the almost superstitious attachment with which we regarded native England. ît had been our О о intention to have called at Lucy's dwelling in Datchet, and to have re-assured her with pro-
mises of aid and protection before we repaired to our quarters for the night. Now, as the Countess of Windsor and I turned down the steep hill that led from the Castle, we saw the children, who had just stopped in their caravan, at the inn-door. They had passed through Datchet without halting. I dreaded to meet them, and to be the bearer of my tragic story, so while they were still occupied in the hurry of arrival, I suddenly left them, and through the snow and clear moon light air, hastened along the well known road to Datchet. Well known indeed it was. Each cottage stood on its accustomed site, each tree wore its familiar appearance. Habit had graven unerase- ably on my memory, every turn and change of object on the road. At a short distance be- vond the Little Park, was an elm half blown down by a storni, some ten year* ago ; and still, with leafless snow-laden branches, it stretched across the pathway, which wound through a meadow, beside a shallow brook, whose brawl-
hig~ was silenced by frost—that stile, that white gate, that hollow oak tree, which doubtless once belonged to the forest, and which now shewed in the moonlight its gaping rent ; to whose fan¬ ciful appearance, tricked out by the dusk into a resemblance of the human form, the children had given the name of Falstaff; —all these ob¬ jects were as well known to me as the cold hearth of my deserted home, and every moss- grown wall and plot of orchard ground, alike as twin lambs are to each other in a stran¬ ger's eye, yet to my accustomed gaze bore dif¬ ferences, distinction, and a name. England re¬ mained* thouídi England was dead—it was the ghost of merry England that I beneld, under v\ hose greenwood shade passing generations had sported in security and case. To this painful re¬ cognition of familiar places, was added a feeling experienced by all, understood by none—a feel¬ ing as ifin some state, less visionary than a dream, i u some past real existence, I had seen all I saw, with precisely the same feelings as I now
beheld them—as if all my sensations were a duplex mirror of a former revelation. To get rid of this oppressive sense I strove to imagine change in this tranquil spot—this augmented my mood, by causing me to bestow more attention on the objects which occasioned me pain. I reached Datchet and Lucy's humble abode —once noisy with Saturday night revellers,or trim and neat on Sunday morning it had borne tes¬ timony to the labours and orderly habits of the housewife. The snow lay high about the door, as if it had remained unclosed for many days. * £ What scene of death hath Roscius now to act? 1 * I muttered to myself as I looked at the dark casements. At first I thought I saw a light in one of them, but it proved to be merely the re¬ fraction of the moon-beams, while the only sound was the crackling branches as the breeze whirred the snow flakes from them—the moon sailed high and unclouded in the interminable ether, while the shadow of the cottage lay black on the garden behind. I entered this by the open
wicket, and anxiously examined each window. At length I detected a ray of light struggling through a closed shutter in one of tlie upper rooms—it was a novel feeling, alas! to look at any house and say there dwells its ibiial in¬ mate-—the door of the house was merely on the latch: sol entered and ascended the moon- Ii t staircase. The door of the inhabited room was ajar : looking in, I saw Lucy sitting as at work at the table on which the light stood; the imple¬ ments of needlework were about her, but her hand had fallen on her lap, and her eyes fixed on the ground, shewed by their vacancy that her thoughts wandered. Trates of care and watch¬ ing had diminished her former attractions—but her simple dress and cap, her desponding atti¬ tude, and the single candle that cast its light upon her, gave for a moment a picturesque grouping to the whole. A feaiful ìeality re¬ called me from the thought—a figure lay stretched on the bed covered by a sheet—her mother was dead, and Lucy, apart from all the
world, deserted and alone, watched beside the corpse during the weary night. I entered the room, and my unexpected appearance at first drew a scream from the lone survivor of a dead nation; but she recognised me, and recovered herself, with the quick exercise of self-control habitual to her. " Did you not expect me ?" I asked, in that low voice which the presence of the dead makes us as it were instinctively as¬ sume. " You arc very good," replied she, " to have come yourself; I can never thank you suffi¬ ciently ; but it is too late. 1 " " Too late,' 1 cried 1, ' 4 what do you mean ? It is not too late to take you from this deserted place, and conduct you >u -------- ~" My own loss, which I had forgotten as I spoke, now made me turn away, while choking grief impeded my speech. I threw open the window, and looked on the cold, waning, ghastly, misshaped circle on high, and the chill white earth beneath—did the spirit of sweet Idris sail
along the moon-frozen crystal a ir ?—No, no, a more genial atmosphere, a lovelier habitation was surely hers ! I indulged in this meditation for a moment, and then again addressed the mourner, who stood leaning against the bed w' ! Xh that expres¬ sion of resigned despair, of complete misery, and a j^atient sufferance of it, which is far more touch¬ ing than any of the insane ravings or wild gesti¬ culation of untamed sorrow. I desired to draw her from this spot; but she opposed my wish. That class of persons whose imagination and sensibility have never been taken out of the narrow circle immediately in view, if they possess these qualities to any extent, are apt to pour their influence into the very realities which ap¬ pear to destroy them, and to cling to these with double tenacity from not being able to compre¬ hend any thing beyond. Thus Lucy, in desert England, in a dead world, wished to fulfil the usual ceremonies of the dead, such as were cus¬ tomary to the English country people, when
dea^h was a rare visitant, and gave us time to receive his dreaded usurpation with pomp and circumstance—going forth in procession to de¬ liver the keys of the tomb into his conquering hand. She had already, alone as she was, ac¬ complished some of these, and the woik on which I found her employed, was her mother's shroud. TV r \ heart sickened at such detail of woe, which a female can endure, but which is more painful to the masculine spuit than dead¬ liest struggle, or throes of unutterable but tian- sient agony. This must not be, I told her ; and then, as further inducement, I communicated to her my recent loss, and gave her the idea that she must come with me to take charge of the orphan children, whom the death of Idi is had deprived of a motheA care. Lucy never lesisted the tall of a duty, so she Yielded, and closing the case¬ ments and doors with care, she accompanied me back to Windsor. As we went she communi¬ cated to me the occasion of her mother's, deatli.
Either b} some mischance she had got sight of Lucy's letter to Idris, or she had overheard her conversation with the countr>man who bore it; however it might be, she obtained a knowledge of the appalling situation of her*elf and her daughter, her açed frame could not sustam the anxiety and horror this discov ery instilled—she concealed her knowledge from Lucy, but brooded over it through sleepless nights, till fever and delirium, swift forerunners of death, disclosed the secret. Her life, v\ hich had long been hovering on its extinction, now } ielded at once to the united effects» of misery and sickness, and that same morning she had died After the tumultuous emotions of the day, 1 was glad to find on my arrival at the inn that my companions bad ictired to rest. I gave Lucy in charge to the Countess^ attendant, and then sought repose from my \aiious struggles and impatient regrets. For a few moments the events of' the day floated m disastious pageant through ni)- brain, till bleep bathed it in forget-
fulness; when morning dawned and I awoke, it seemed as if my slumber had endured for years. My companions had not shared my oblivion. Clara's swollen eyes shewed that ¡she had passed the night in weeping. The Countess looked haggard and wan. Her firm spirit had not found relief in tears, and she suffered the more from all the painful retrospect and agonizing regret that now occupied her. We departed from Wind¬ sor, as soon as the burial rites had been per¬ formed for Lucy's mother, and, urged on by an impatient desire to change the scene, went for¬ ward towards Dover with speed, our escort having gone before to proviile horses ; iinding them either in the warm stables they instinc¬ tively sought during the cold weather, or stand¬ ing shivering in the bleak fields ready to sur¬ render their liberty in exchange for offered corn. During our ride the Countess recounted to me the extraordinary circumstances which had
brought her so strangely to my side in the chancel of St. George's chapel. When last she had taken leave of Idris, as she looked anxiously on her faded person and pallid countenance, she had suddenly been visited by a conviction that she saw her for the last time. It was hard to part with her while under the dominion of this sentiment, and for the last time she endeavoured to persuade her daughter to commit herself to her nursing, permitting me to join Adrian. Idris mildly refused, and thus they separated. The idea that they should never again meet grew on the Comités*/·* mind, and haunted her perpetually ; a thousand times she had resolved to turn back and join us, and was again and again restrained by the pride and anger of which she was the slave. I'roud of heart as she v\as, she bathed her pillow with ni«ditlv tears, and through the day was subdued by nervous agitation and expectation of the dreaded event, which she «;ь wholK incapable of curb-
ing. She confessed that at this period her hatred of me knew no bounds, since she con¬ sidered me as the sole obstacle to the fulfilment of her dearest wish, that of attending upon her daughter in her last moments. She desired to express her fears to her son, and to seek conso¬ lation from his sympathy with, or courage from his rejection of, her auguries. On the first day of her arrival at Dover she walked with him on the sea beach, and with the timidity characteristic of passionate and exag¬ gerated feeling was by degrees bringing the conversation to the desired point, when she could communicate her fears to him, wdien the mes¬ senger who bore my letter announcing our tem¬ porary return to Windsor, came riding down to them He gave some oral account of how he had left us, and added, that notwithstanding the cheerfulness and good courage of Lady Idris, he was afraid that she would hardly reach Windsor alive.
" True," said the Countess, "your fears are just, she is about to expire Ρ As she spoke, her eyes were fixed on a tomb- like hollow of the cliff, and she saw, she averred the same to me with solemnity, Idris pacing slowly towards this cave. She was turned from her, her head was bent down, her white dress was such as she was accustomed to wear, except that a thin crape-like veil covered her golden tresses, and concealed her as a dim transparent mist. She looked dejected, as do¬ cilely yielding to a commanding power; she sub¬ missively entered, and was lost in the dark recess. ' f Were I subject to \isionary mood?,"' said the venerable lady, as she continued her narra¬ tive, íŕ I might doubt my eyes, and condemn my credulity ; but reality is the world I H ve in, and wdmt I saw I doubt not had existence be¬ yond myself. From that moment I could not rest ; it was worth my existence to see her once again before she died ; I knew that I VOL. II. G
should not accomplish this, yet I must endea¬ vour. I immediately departed for Windsor; and, though I was assured that we travelled speedily, it seemed to me that our progress was snail-like, and that delays were created solely for my annoyance. Still I accused you, and heaped on your head the fiery ashes of my burning impatience. It was no disappointment, though an agonizing pang, when you pointed to her last abode ; and words would ill express the abhorrence I that moment felt towards you, the triumphant impediment to my dearest wishes. I sa vr her, and anger, and hate, and injustice died at her bier, giving place at their departure to a remorse. (Great God, that 1 should t^el it!) which must last while memory and feeling endure. To medicine such remorse, to prevent awaken¬ ing love and new-bom mildness from pro¬ ducing the same bitter fruit that hate and harshness had done, I devoted all my endea¬ vours to soothe the venerable penitent. Our
party was a melancholy one ; each was pos¬ sessed by regret for what was remediless ; for the absence of his mother shadowed even the infant gaiety of Evelyn. Added to this was the prospect of the uncertain future. Before the final accomplishment of any great voluntary change the mind vacillates, now soothing itself by fervent expectation, now recoiling from ob¬ stacles which seem never to ha"^e presented themselves before with so frightful an aspect. An involuntary tremor ran through me when Ì thought that in another day we might hau- crossetl the watery barrier, ami have set forward on tliat hopeless, interminable, >ad wander- НШ, which but a short time before ΐ regarded a> the only relief to sorrow that our situation afforded. Our approach to Dover was announced by the loud roarings of the wintry sea. They were borne miles inland by the sound-laden blast, and by their unaccustomed uproar, impart¬ ed a feeling of insecurity and peril to our stable a c >
«diode. At fiibl we haidl) pei nutted ourselves lo think that any unusual eruption of nature caused thib tremendous wai of air and water, but latlur fanciid that we ìnciely Ibluied to what we had beai d a thousand times befoie, when we had wakhed the flock·* (if fkece-crowned waves, diiven b} the winds, come to lament and die on the barren *and*> and pointed rocks.

ripples refracted the sunbeams, which «died their radiance through the clear blue frosty air. This placid appearance of nature was hailed as a good augury foi the voyage, and the chief immediate¬ ly repaired to the harbour to examine two steam¬ boats which WLre moored there. On the follow¬ ing midnight, when all were at rest, a frightful storm of wind and clattering rain and hail iiìM disturbed them, and the voice of one shrieking in the streets, that tlie sleepers must awake or they would be drowned ; and when they rushed out, half clothed, to discover the meaning of this alarm, they found that the tide, rising above every mark, was ru-hing into the town. They ascended the cliff, but tlie darkness permitted only the white cre^t of waves to be seen, while the roaring wind mingled its bowlings in dire accord with the wild surges. The awful hour of night, the utter inexperience of man ν who had never seen the sea before, the wailing of women and cries of children added to the hoi ror of the tumult.
All the following day the same scene con¬ tinued. When the tide ebbed, the town was left dry ; but on its flow, it rose even higher than on the preceding night. The vast ships that lay rotting in the roads were whirled from their anchorage, and driven and jammed against the cliff, the vessels in the harbour were flung on land like sea-weed, and there battered to pieces by the breakers. The waves dashed against the cliff> which if in any place it had been before loosened, now gave way, and the affrighted crowd saw vast fragments of the near earth fall with crash and roar into the deep. This sight operated differently on different persons. The greater part thought it a judgment of God, to prevent or punish our emigration from our native land. Many were doubly eager to quit a nook of ground now become their prison, which appeared unable to resist the inroads of ocean's giant waves. When we arrived at Dover, after a fatiguing day's journey, we all required rest and sleep;
but the scene acting around us soon drove away such ideas. We were drawn, along with the greater part of our companions, to the edge of the cliff, there to listen to and make a thousand conjectures. A fog narrowed our horizon to about a quarter of a mile, anel the misty veil, cold and elense, enveloped sky and sea in equal obscurity. What added to our inquietude was the circumstance that two-thirds of our original number were now waiting for us in Paris, and clinging, as we now did most painfully, to any addition to our melancholy remnant, this divi¬ sion, with the tameless impassable ocean between, struck us with affright. At length, after loiter¬ ing for several hours on the cliff, we retired to Dover Castle, whose roof sheltered all who breathed the English air, anel sought the sleep necessary to restore strength and courage to our worn frames and languid spirits. Early in the morning Adrian brought me the welcome intelligence that the wind had changed : it had been south-west ; it was now
north «east. The sky was stripped bare of clouds by the increasing gale, while the tide at its ebb seceded entirely from the town. The change of wind rather increased the fury of the sea, but it altered its late dusky hue to a bright green ; and in spite of its unmitigated clamour, its more cheerful appearance instilled hope and pleasure. All day we watched the raging of the mountainous waves, and towards sunset a desire to decypher the promise for the morrow at its setting, made us all gather with one accord on the edge of the cliff. When the mighty luminary approached within a few degrees of the tern pes t-tosbcd horizon, suddenly, a wonder í three other suns, alike burning and brilliant, rushed from various quarters of the heavens towards the great orb ; they whirled round it. The glare of light was intense to our dazzled eyes ; the sun itself seemed to join in the dance, while the sea burned like a furnace, like all Vesuvius а -light, with flowing lava beneath. The horses broke loose from their stalls iu terror—a
herd of cattle, panic struck, raced down to tlie brink of the cliff, and blinded by light, plunged down with frightful yells in the waves below. The time occupied by the apparition of these meteors was comparatively short ; suddenly the three mock suns united in one, and plunged into the sea. A few seconds afterwards, a deafening watery sound came up with awful peal from the spot where they had disappeared. Meanwhile the sun, disencumbered from his strauge satellites, paced with its accustomed majesty towards ita western home. When—we dared not trust our eyes late dazzled, but it seemed that—the sea rose to meet it—it mounted higher and higher, till the fiery globe was ob¬ scured, and the wall of water still ascended the horizon ; it appeared as if suddenly the motion oí earth was revealed to us—as if no longer we w ere ruled by ancient laws, but were turned adrift m an unknown region of space. Many cried aloud, that these were no meteors, but globos of burn¬ ing matter, which had set fire to the earth, and о 3
caused the vast cauldron at our feet to bubble up with its measureless waves; the day of judgment was come they averred, and a few moments would transport us before the awful countenance of the omnipotent judge; while those less given to visionary terrors, declared that two conflicting gales had occasioned the last phænomenon. In support of this opinion they poin Æcl out the fact that the east wind died away, while the rushing of the coming west mingled its wild howl with the roar of the advancing waters. Would the cliff resist this new battery ? Was not the giant wave far higher than the pre¬ cipice ? Would not our little island be deluged by its approach ? The crowd of spectators fled. They were dispersed over the fields, stopping now and then, and looking back in terror. A sublime sense of awe calmed the swift pulsations of my heart—I awaited the approach of the destruction menaced, with that solemn resigna¬ tion which an unavoidable necessity instils The ocean every moment assumed a mote ter-
rifiç aspect, while the twilight wa£ dimmed by the rack which the west wind spread over the sky. By slow degrees however, as the wave advanced, it took a more mild appearance ; some under current of air, or obstruction in the bed of the waters, checked its progress, and it sank gradually ; while the surface of the sea became uniformly higher as it dissolveel into it. This change took from us the fear of an immediate catastrophe, although we were still anxious as to the final result. We continued during the whole night to watch the fury of the sea and the pace of the driving clouds, through whose openings the rare stars rushed impetuously; the thunder of con¬ flicting elements deprived us of all power to sleep. This endured ceaselessly for three days and nights. The stoutest hearts quailed before the savage enmity of nature; pro¬ visions began to fail us, though every elay foraging parties were dispersée! to the nearer towns. In vain we schooled ourselves into the belief, that there was nothing out of the common
order of naturein the strife we witnessed; our disasterous and overwhelming destiny turned the best of us to cowards. Death had hunted us through the course of many months, even to the narrow strip of time on which we now stood ; narrow indeed, and buffeted by storms, was our footway overhanging the great sea of calamity— As an unsheltered northern shore Is shaken by the wmtry wave— And frequent storms for evermore, (While from the west the Ьл^а winds rave, Or from the east, or mountains hoar) The struck and íoíťring· sand-bank Live.* It required more than human energy to bear up against the menaces of destruction that every where surrounded us. After the lapse of three days, the gale died away the sea-gull sailed upon the calm bosom of the windless atmosphere, and the last yellow leaf on the topmost branch of the oak hung without motion. The sea no longer broke with

fury ; but a swell setting in steadily for shore ? with long sweep and sullen burst replaced the roar of the breakers. Yet we derived hope from the change, and we did not doubt that after the interval of a few days the sea would resume its tranquillity. The sunset of the fourth day favoured this idea ; it was clear and golden. As we gazed on the purple sea, radiant beneath, we were attracted by a novel spectacle ; a dark speck—as it neared, visibly a boat, rode on the top of the waves, every now and then lost in the steep vallies between. We marked its course with eager questionings; and, when we saw that it evidently made for shore, we descended to the only practicable landing place, and hoisted a signal to direct them. By the help of glasses we distinguished her crew ; it consisted of nine men, Englishmen, belonging in truth to the two divisions of our people, who had preceded us, and had been for several weeks at Paris. As countryman was wont to meet countryman in distant lands, did we greet our visitors on their
landing, with outstretched hands and gladsome welcome. They were slow to reciprocate our gratulations. They looked angry and resentful; not, less than the chafed sea which they had traversed with imminent peril, though apparent¬ ly more displeased with each other than with us. It was strange to see these human beings, who appeared to be given forth by the earth like rare and inestimable plants, full of towering passion, and the spirit of angry con¬ test. Their first demand was to be conducted to the Lord Protector of England, so they called Adrian, though he had long discarded the empty title, as a bitter mockery of the shadow to which, the Protectorship was now reduced. They were speedily led to Dover Castle, from whose keep Adrian had watched the movements of the boat. He received them with the interest and w r onder so strange a visitation created. In the confusion occasioned by their angry demands for prece¬ dence, it was long before we could discover the secret meaning of this strange scene. By degrees,
from the furious declamations of one, the fierce in¬ terruptions of another, and the bitter scoffs of a third, we found that they were deputies from our colony at Paris, from three parties there formed, who, each with angry rivalry, tried to attain a superiority over the other two. These deputies had been dispatched Ъу them to Adrian, who had been selected arbiter ; and they had journied from Paris to Calais, through the vacant towns and desolate country, indulging the while violent hatred against each other ; and now they pleaded their several causes with unmitigated party- spirit. By examining the deputies apart, and after much investigation, we learnt the true state of things at Paris. Since parliament had elected liim Itylamľs deputy, all the surviving English had submitted to Adrian. He was our captain to lead us from our native soil to unknown lands, our lawgiver and our preserver. On the first arrangement of our scheme of emirrruion, no continuer; separation of our members was
contemplated, and the command of the whole body in gradual ascent oi' power had its apex in the Earl of Windsor. But unforeseen circum¬ stances changed our plans for us, and occasioned the greater part of our numbers to be divided for the space of nearly two months, from the supreme chief. They had gone over in two distinct bodies; and on their arrival at Paris dissension arose between them. They had found Paris a desert. When first the plague had appeared, the return of travel¬ lers and merchants, and communications by letter, informed us regularly of the ravages made by disease on the continent. But with the encreased mortality this intercourse declined and ceased. Even in England itself commu¬ nication from one part of the island to the other became slow and rare. No vessel stemmed the flood that divided Calais from Dover ; or if some melancholy voyager, wishing to assure himself of the life or death of his relatives, put from the French shore to return among us, often the
greedy ocean swallowed his little craft, or after a day or two he was infected by the disorder, and died before he could tell the tale of the desolation of France, We were therefore to a great degree ignorant of the state of things on the continent, and were not without some vague hope of finding numerous companions in its wide track. Rut the same causes that had so fearfully el i minished the English nation had had even greater scope for mischief in the sister land. France was a blank ; during the long line of road from Calais to Paris not one human being was fou nek I u Paris there were a few, perhaps a hundred, who, resigned to their coming fate, flitted about the streets of the capital and assembled to converse of past times, with that vivacity and even gaiety that seldom deserts the individuals of this nation. The English took uncontested possession of Paris. Its high houses and narrow streets were lifeless. A few pale figures were to be diştin-
guished at the accustomed resort at the Tui¬ leries; they wondered wherefore the islanders should approach their ill-fated city—for in the excess of wretchedness, the sufferers always ima¬ gine, that their part of the calamity is the bit¬ terest, as, when enduring intense pain, we would exchange the particular torture we writhe under, for any other which should visit a different part of the frame. They listened to the acce unt the emigrants gave of their motives for leaving their native land, with a shrug almost of disdain— " Return," they said, " return to your island, whose sea breezes, and division from the conti¬ nent gives some promise of health ; if Pestilence among you has slain its hundreds, with us it has slain its thousands. Are you not even now more numerous than we are ?—A year ago you would have found only the sick burying the dead ; now we are happier ; for the pang of struggle has passed away, and the few you y Lid here are patiently waiting the final blow. But
you, who are not content to âie y breathe no longer the air of France, or soon you will only be a part of her soil. Thus, by menaces of the sword, they would have driven back those who had escaped from fire. But the peril left behind was deemed imminent by my countrymen ; that before them doubtful and distant ; and soon other feelings arose to obliterate fear, or to replace it by pas¬ sions, that ought to have had no place among a brotherhood of unhappy survivors of the expiring world. The more numerous division of emigrants, which arrived first at Paris, assumed a supe¬ riority of rank and power ; the second party- asserted their independence. A third was formed by a sectarian, a self-erected prophet, who, while he attributed all power and rule to God, strove to get the real command of his comrades into his own hands. This third division consisted of fewest individuals, but their purpose was raore one, their obedience to their leader more entire,
their fortitude and courage more unyielding and active. During the whole progress of the plague, the teachers of religion were in possession of great power; a power of good, if rightly directed, or of incalculable mischief, if fanaticism or in¬ tolerance guided their efforts. In the present instance, a worse feeling than either of these actuated the leader. He was an impostor in the most determined sense of the term. A man who had in early life lost, through the indulgence of vicious propensities, all sense of rectitude or self- esteem ; and who, when ambition was awakened in him, gave himself up to its influence unbridled by any scruple. His father had been a metho¬ dist preacher, an enthusiastic man with simple in¬ tentions ; but whose pernicious doctrines of elec¬ tion and special grace had contributed to destroy all conscientious feeling in his son. During the progress of the pestilence he had entered upon various schemes, by which to acquire adherents and pow r er. Adrian had discovered and defeated
these attempts ; but Adrian was absent ; the wolf assumed the shepherd's garb, and the flock admitted the tleception : he had formed a party during the few weeks he had been in Paris, who zealously propagated the creed of his divine mission, and believed that safety and salvation w r ere to be afforded only to those who put their trust in him. When once the spirit of dissension had arisen, the most frivolous causes gave it activity. The first party, on arriving at Paris, had taken pos¬ session of the Tuileries; chance and friendly feeling had induced the second to lodge near to them. A contest arose concerning the distribu¬ tion of the pillage ; the chiefs of the first divi¬ sion demanded that the whole should be placed at their disposal ; with this assumption the op¬ posite party refused to comply. When next the latter went to forage, the gates of Paris were shut on them. After overcoming this difficulty, they marched in a body to the Tuileries They found that their enemies had been already ex-
pelled thence by the Elect, as the fanatical party designated themselves, who refuseei to admit any mto the palace who did not first abjure obedience to all except God, and his delegate on earth, their chief. Such was the beginning of the strife, which at length proceeded so far, that the three divisions, armed, met in the Place Vendôme, each resolved to subdue by force the resistance of its adversaries. They assembled, their muskets were loaded, and even pointed at the breasts of their so called enemies. One word hael been sufficient; and there the last of mankind would hav e bur- thened their souls with the crime of murder, and dipt their hands in each other's blood. A sense of shame, a recollection that not only their cause, but the existence of the whole human race was at stake, entered the breast of the leader of the more numerous party. He was aware, that if the ranks were thinned, no other recruits could fill them up ; that each man was as a priceless gem in a kingly crown, which if de¬ stroyed, the earth's deep entrails could y i edd no
paragon. He was a young man, and had been hurried on by presumption, and the notion of his high rank and superiority to all other pre¬ tenders ; now he repented his work, he felt that all the blood about to be shed would be on his head; with sudden impulse therefore he spurred his horse between the bands, and, having fixed a white handkerchief on the point of his uplifted sword, thus demanded parley ; the opposite leaders obeyed the signal. He spoke with warmth ; he reminded them of the oath all the chiefs had taken to submit to the Lord Pro¬ tector ; he declared their present meeting to be an act of treason and mutiny ; he allowed that he had been hurried away by passion, but that a cooler moment had arrived ; and he proposed that each party should send deputies to the Karl of Windsor, inviting his interference and offering hiibmission to his decision. His offer was ac¬ cepted so far, that each leader consented to com¬ mand a retreat, and moreover agreed, that after the approbation of their several parties had been
consulted, they should meet that night on some neutral spot to ratify the truce. At the meeting of the chiefs, this plan was finally concluded upon. The leader of the fanatics indeed re¬ fused to admit the arbitration of Adrian ; he sent ambassadors, rather than deputies, to assert his claim, not plead his cause. The truce was to continue until the first of February, when the bands were again to assem¬ ble on the Place Vendôme; it was of the utmost consequence therefore that Adı ian should arrive in Paris by that day, since an hair might turn the scale, and peace, scared away by intestine broils, might only return to watch by the silent dead. It was now the twenty-eighth of fJanuary ; every vessel stationed near Dover had been beaten to pieces and destroyed by the furious storms I have commemorated. Our journey however would admit of no delay. That very night, Adrian, and!, and twelve others, either friends or attendants, put off from the English shore, in the boat that had brought over
the deputies. We all took our turn at the oar ; and the immediate occasion of our departure affording us abundant matter for conjecture and discourse, prevented the feeling that we left our native country, depopulate England, for the last time, to enter deeply into the minds of the greater part of our number. It was a serene starlight night, and the dark line of the English coast continued for some time visible at intervals, as w ľ e rose on the broad back of the waves. I exerted myself with my long oar to give swift impulse to our skiff; and, while the waters splashed with melancholy sounel against its sides, I looked with sad affection on this last glimpse of sea-girt England, and strained my eyes not too soon to lose sight of the castellated cliff, which rose to protect the land of heroism and beauty from the inroads of ocean, that, turbu¬ lent as I had lately seen it, required such cyclo¬ pean walls for its repulsion. A solitary sea-gull winged its flight over our heads, to seek its nest in a cleft of the precipice. Yes, thou shalt re- VOL. III. u
visit the land of thy birth, I thought, as I looked invidiously on the airy voyager ; but we shall, never more ! Tomb of Idris, farewell ! Grave, in which my heart lies sepultured, farewell for ever í We were twelve hours at sea, and the heavy swell obliged us to exert all our stiength. At length, by mere dint of rowing, we reached the French coasf. The stars faded, and the grey morning cast a dim veil over the silver horns of the waning moon—the sun rose broad and red from the sea, as we walked over the sands to Calais. Our first care was to procure horses, and although wearied by our night of watching and toil, some of our party immediately went in quest of these in the wide fields of the unen¬ closed and now harren plain round Calais. We divided ourselves, like seamen, into watche?, and some reposed, while others prepared the mornings repast. Our foragers returned at noon with only six horses—on these, Adrian and I, and four others, proceeded on our journey to-
wards the great city, which its inhabitants had fondly named the capital of the civilized world. Our horses had become, through their long ho¬ liday, almost wild, and we crossed the plain round Calais with impetuous speed. From the height near Boulogne, I turned again to look on England ; nature had cast a misty pall over her, her cliff was hidden—there was spread the wa¬ tery barrier that divided us, never again to be crossed ; she lay on the ocean plain, In the great pool a swan's, ne-.t. Ruined the nest, alas ! the swans of Albion had passed away for ever—an uninhabited rock in the wide Pacific, which had remained since the creation uninhabited, unnamed, unmarked, would be of as much account in the world's future history, as desert England. Our journey was impeded by a thousand ob¬ stacles. As our horses grew tired, we had to seek for others ; and hours were wasted; while we и 2
exhausted our artifices to allure some of these enfranchised slaves of man to resume the yoke ; or as we went from stable to stable through the towns, hoping to find some who had not forgotten the shelter of their native stalls. Our ill suc¬ cess in procuring them, obliged us continually to leave some one of our companions behind ; and on the first of February, Adrian and I en¬ tered Paris, wholly unaccompanied. The serene morning had dawned when we arrived at Saint Denis, and the sun was high, wdien the clamour of voices, and the clash, as we feared, of wea¬ pons, guided us to where our countrymen had assembled on the Place Vendôme. Wc passed a knot of Frenchmen, who were talking earnestly of the madness of the insular invaders, and then coming by a sudden turn upon the Place, we saw the sun glitter on drawn swords and fixed bayonets, while yells and clamours rent the air. It was a scene of unaccustomed confusion in these days of depopulation. Roused by fancied wrongs, and insulting scoffs, the op-
posite parties bad rushed to attack each other ; while the elect, drawn up apart, seemed to w r ait an opportunity to fall with better advantage on their foes, when they should have mutually weakened each other. A merciful power inter¬ posed, and no blood was shed ; for, while the in¬ sane mob were in the very act of attack, the fe¬ males, wives, mothers and daughters, rushed be¬ tween ; they seized the bridles ; they embraced the knees of the horsemen, and hung on the necks, or enweaponed arms of their enraged re¬ latives ; the shrill female scream was mingled with the manly shout, and formed the wild cla¬ mour that welcomed us on our arrival. Our voices could not be heard in the tumult ; Adrian however was eminent for the white charger he rode ; spurring him, he dashed into the midst of the throng; he was recognized, and a loud cry raised for England and the Pro¬ tector. The late adversaries, warmed to affec¬ tion at the sight of him, joined in heedless con-
fusion, and surrounded him ; the women kissed his hands, and the edges of his garments ; nay, his horse received tribute of their embraces; some wept their welcome ; he appeared an angel of peace descended among them ; and the only danger was, that his mortal nature would be demonstrated, by his suffocation from the kind¬ ness of his friends. His voice was at length heard, and obeyed ; the crowd fell back ; the chiefs alone rallied round him. I had seen Lord Raymond ride through his lines ; his look of victory, and majestic mien obtained the respect and obedience of all : such was not the appear¬ ance or influence of Adrian. His slight figure, his fervent look, his gesture, more of deprecation than rule, were proofs that love, unmingled with fear, gave him dominion o\er the hearts of a multitude, who knew that he never flinched from danger, nor was actuated by other motives than care for the general welfare. No distinction was now visible between the two parties, late ready
to shed each other's blood, for, though neither would submit to the other, they both yielded ready obedience to the Earl of Windsor. One party however remained, cut off from the rebt, which did not sympathize in the joy exhibited on Adrian's arrival, or imbibe the spirit of peace, which fell like dew upon the softened hearts of their countrymen. At the bead of this assembly was a ponderous, dark- looking man, whose malign eye surveyed with gloating delight the stern looks of his followers. They had hitherto been inactive, but now, perceiving themselves to he forgotten in the uni¬ versal jubilee, they advanced with threatening gestuies: our friends had, as it were in wan¬ ton contention, attacked each other ; they wanted but to be told that their cause was one, for it to become so: their mutual anger had been a lire of straw, compared to the slow-burning hatred they both entertained for these seeeders, who seized a portion of the world to come, there to entrench and incastellate themselves, and to issue
with fearful sally, and appalling denunciations, on the mere common children of tlie earth. The first advance of the little army of the elect re¬ awakened their rage ; thev grasped their arms, and waited but their leader's signal to commence the attack, when the clear tones of Adrian's voice were heard, commanding them to fall back ; with confused murmur and hurried retreat, as the wave ebbs clamorously from the sands it lately covered, our friends obeyed. Adrian rode singly into the space between the opposing bands; he approached the hostile leader, as re¬ questing him to imitate his example, but his look was not obeyed, and the chief advanced, followed by his whole troop. There were many women among them, who seemed more eager and reso¬ lute than their male companions. They pressed round their leader, as if to shield him, while they loudly bestowed on him every sacred deno¬ mination and epithet of worship. Adrian met them half way ; they halted : " What,' 1 he said, " do you seek ? Do you require any thing of
us that we refuse to give, and that you are forced to acquire by arms and warfare ?" His questions were answered by a general cry, in which the words election, sin, and red right arm of God, could alone be heard. Adrian looked expressly at their leader, say¬ ing, ťť Can you not silence your followers 't Mine, you perceive, obey me.' 1 The fellow answered by a scowl ; and then, perhaps fearful that his people should become auditors of the debate he expected to ensue, he commanded them to fall back, and advanced by himself. " What, I again ask," said Adrian, " do you require of us ?" " Repentance,'*' replied the man, whose sinis¬ ter brow gathered clouds as he spoke. " Obe¬ dience to the will of the Most High, made ma¬ nifest to these his Elected People. Do we nol all die through your sins, О generation of un¬ belief, and have we not a right to demand of you repentance and obedience ?" h a
" And if wc refuse them, what then ?" his opponent inquired mildly. u Beware, 11 cried the man, " God hears you, and will smite your stony heart in his wrath; his poisoned arrows fly, his dogs of death are unleashed í We will not perish unrevenged— ■ and mighty will our avenger be, when he de¬ scends in visible majesty, and scatters destruc¬ tion among you." e * My good fellow," said Adrian, with quiet scorn, " I wish that you were ignorant only, and I think it would be no difficult task to prove to you, that you speak of what you do not understand. On the present occasion how¬ ever, it is enough for me to know that you seek nothing of us ; and, heaven is our witness, we seek nothing of you. I should be sorry to em¬ bitter by strife the few days that we any of us may have here to live ; when there/' he pointed downwards, " we shall not be able to contend, while here we need not. Go home, or stay ;
pray to your God in your own mode; your friends may do the like. My orisons consist in peace and good will, in resignation and hope. Farewell!" He bowed slightly to the angry disputant who was about to reply; and, turning his horse down Rue Saint Honoré, called on his friends to follow him. He rode slowly, to give time to all to join him at the Barrier, and then is- sueel his orders that those who yielded obedience to him, should rendezvous at Versailles. In the meantime he remained within the walls of Paris, until he had secured the safe retreat of all. In about a fortnight the remainder of the emigrants arrived from England, and they all repaired to Versailles; apartments were pre¬ pared for the family of the Protector in the Grand Trianon, and there, after the excitement of these events, we reposed amidst the luxuries of the departed Bourbons.
CHAPTER V. Afte π the repose of a few days, we held a council, to decide on our future movements. Our first plan had been to quit our wintry na¬ tive latitude, and seek for our diminished num¬ bers the luxuries and delights of a southern climate. We had not fixed on any precise spot as the termination of our wanderings ; but a vague picture of perpetual spring, fragrant groves, and sparkling streams, floated in our imagination to entice us on. A variety of causes had detained us in England, and we had now arrived at the middle of February ; if we pursued our original project, we should find our¬ selves in a worse situation than before, having exchanged our temperate climate for the into-
lerable heats of a summer in Egypt or Persia. We were therefore obliged to modify our plan, as the season continued to be inclement; and it was determined that we should await the arrival of spring in our present abode, and so order our future movements as to pass the hot months in the icy vallies of Switzerland, defer¬ ring our southern progress until the ensuing au¬ tumn, if such a season was ever again to be beheld by us. The castle and town of Versailles afforded our numbers ample accommodation, and foraging parties took it by turns to supply our wants. There was a strange and appalling motley in the situation of these the last of the race. At first I likened it to a colony, which borne over the far seas, struck root for the first time in a new country. But where was the bustle and in* dustry characteristic of such an assemblage; the rudely constructed dwelling, which was to suffice till a more commodious mansion could be built ; tlie marking out of fields ; the attempt at culti*
vation ; the eager curiosity to discover unknown animals and herbs ; the excursions for the sake of exploring the country ? Our habitations were palaces—our food was ready stored in granaries —there was no need of labour, no inquisitive- ness, no restless desire to get on. If we had been assured that we should secure the lives of our present numbers, there would have been more vivacity and hope in our councils. We should have discussed as to the period when the existing produce for man's sustenance would no longer suffice for ns, and what mode of life we should then adopt. We should have considered more carefully our future plans, and debated concerning the spot where we should in future dwell. But summer and the plague were near, and we dared not look forward. Every heart sickened at the thought of amuse¬ ment; if the younger part of vïur community were ever impelled, by youthful and untamed hilarity, to enter on any dance or song, to cheer the melancholy time, they would suddenly
break off, checked by a mournful look or ago¬ nizing sigh from any one among them, who was prevented by sorrows and losses from mingling in the festivity. If laughter echoed under our roof, yet the heart was vacant of joy ; and, when¬ ever it chanced that I witnessed such attempts at pastime, they encreased instead of diminishing my sense of woe. In the midst of the pleasure- bunting throng, I woukl close my eyes, and see before me the obscure cavern, where was garnereel the mortality of Idris, and the dead lay around, mouldering in hushed repose. When I again became aware of the present hour, softest melody of Lydian flute, or harmonious maze of graceful dance, was but as the de¬ moniac chorus in the Wolfs Glen, and the caperings of the reptiles that surrounded the magic circle. My dearest interval of peace occurred, when, released from the obligation of associating with the crowd, I could repose in the dear home where my children lived. Children I say, for
the tenderest emotions of paternity bound me to Clara. She was now fourteen ; sorrow, and deep insight into the scenes around her, calmed the restless spirit of girlhood ; while the remem¬ brance of her father whom she idolized, and respect for me and Adrian, implanted an high sense of duty in her young heart. Though serious she was not sad ; the eager desire that makes us all, when young, plume our wings, and stretch our necks, that we may more swiftly alight tiptoe on the height of maturity, was sub¬ dued in her by early experience. All that she could spare of overflowing love from her parents' memory, and attention to her living relatives, was spent upon religion. This was the hidden law of her heart, which she concealed with childish re¬ serve, and cherished the more because it was secret. What faith so entire, what charity so pure, what hope so fervent, as that of early youth ? and she, all love, all tenderness and trust, who from infancy had been tossed on the wide sea of passion and misfortune, saw the finger of apparent divinity
in all, and her best hope was to make herself acceptable to the power she worshipped. Evelyn ivas only five years old ; his joyous heart was incapable of sorrow, and he enlivened our house with the innocent mirth incident to his years. The aged Countess of Windsor had fallen from her dream of power, rank and grandeur ; she had been suddenly seized with the conviction, that love was the only good of life, virtue the only ennobling distinction and enriching wealth. Such a lesson had been taught her by the dead lips of her neglected daughter ; and she devoted herself, with all the fiery violence of her charac¬ ter, to the obtaining the affection of the remnants of her family. In early years the heart of Adrian had been chilled towards her; and, though he observed a due respect, her coldness, mixed with the recollection of disappointment and madness, caused him to feel even pain in her society. She saw this, and yet determined to win his love ; the obstacle served the rather to excite her ambition. As Henry, Emperor of Germany,
lay in the snow before Pope Leo's gate for three winter days and nights, so did she in humility wait before the icy barriers of his closed heart, till he, the servant of love, and prince of tender courtesy, opened it wide for her admittance, bestowing, with fervency and gratitude, the tribute of filial afiection she merited. Her under¬ standing, courage, and presence of mind, became powerful auxiliaries to him in the difficult task of ruling the tumultuous crowd, which were sub¬ jected to his control, in truth by a single hair. The principal circumstances that disturbed our tranquillity during this interval, originated in the vicinity of the impostor-prophet and his followers. They continued to reside at Paris ; but mis¬ sionaries from among them often visited Versailles—and such was the power of assertions, however false, yet vehemently iterated, over the ready credulity of the ignorant and fearful, that they seldom failed in drawing over to their party some from among our numbers. An instance of this nature coming immediately under our notico,
we were led to consider the miserable state in which we should leave our countrymen, when we should, at the approach of summer, move on to¬ wards Switzerland, and leave a deluded crew behind us in the hands of their miscreant leader. The sense of the small ness of our numbers, and expectation of decrease, pressed upon us; and, while it would be a subject of congratulation to ourselves to add one to our party, it would be doubly gratifying to rescue from the pernicious influence of superstition and unrelenting tyranny, the victims that now, though voluntarily en¬ chained, groaned beneath it. If we had con¬ sidered the preacher as sincere in a belief of his ow r n denunciations, or only moderately actuated by kind feeling in the exercise of his assumed powers, we should have immediately addressed ourselves to him, and endeavoured with our best arguments to soften and humanize his views. But he was instigated by ambition, he desired to rule over these last stragglers from the fold of death ; his projects went so far, as to cause him
to calculate that, if, from these crushed remains, a few survived, so that a new race should spring up, he, by holding tight the reins of belief, might be remembered by the post-pestilential race as a patriarch, a prophet, nay a deity ; such as of old among the post-diluvian s were Jupiter the conqueror, Serapis the lawgiver, and Vishnou the preserver, These ideas made him inflexible in his rule, and violent in his hate of any who presumed to share with him his usurped empire. It is a strange fact, but incon testible, that the philanthropist, who ardent in his desire to do good, who patient, reasonable and gentle, yet disdains to use other argument than truth, has less influence over men's minds, than he who, grasping and selfish, refuses not to adopt any means, nor awaken any passion, nor diffuse any falsehood, for the advancement of his cause. If this from time immemorial has been the case, the contrast was infinitely greater, now that the one could bring harrowing fears and transcendent hopes into play ; while the other
had few hopes to hold forth, nor could influence the imagination to diminish the fears which he himself was the first to entertain. The preacher had persuaded his followers, that their escape from the plague, the salvation of their children, and the rise of a new T race of men from their seed, depended on their faith in, and their submission to him. They greedily imbibed this belief; and their over-wcening credulity even rendered them eager to make converts to the same faith. How to seduce any individuals from such an alliance of fraud, was a frequent subject of Adrian s meditations and discourse. He formed many plans for the purpose ; but. his own troop kept him in full occupation to ensure their fidelity and safety ; beside which the preacher was as cau'ious and prudent, as he was cruel. His victims lived under the strictest rules and laws, which either entirely imprisoned them within the Tuileries, or let them out in such numbers, and under such leaders, as precluded the possibility of controversy. There was one among
them however whom ï resolved to save ; she had been known to us in happier days; Idris had loved her ; and her excellent nature made it peculiarly lamentable that she should be sacri¬ ficed by this merciless cannibal of souls. This man had between two and three hun¬ dred persons enlisted under his banners. More than half of them were women; there were about fifty children of all ages ; and not more than eighty men. They were mostly drawn from that which, when such distinctions existed, was denominated the lower rank of society. The exceptions consisted of a few high-born females, who, panic-struck, and tamed by sorrows had joined him. Among these was one, young, lovely, and enthusiastic, whose very goodness made her a more easy victim. I have mentioned her before : Juliet, the youngest daughter, and nowsolerelicof the ducal house of L—. There are some beings, whom fate seems to select on whom to pour, in unmeasured portion, the vials of her wrath, and whom she bathes even to the lips in
misery. Such a one was the ill-starred Juliet, She had lost her indulgent parents, her hrothers and sisters, companions of her youth ; in one fell swoop they had been carried off from her. Yet she had again dared to call herself happy ; united to her admirer, to him who possessed and filled her whole heart, she yielded to the lethean powers of love, and knew and felt only his Hfe and presence. At the very time when with keen delight she welcomed the tokens of ma¬ ternity, this sole prop of her life failed, her hus¬ band died of the plague. For a time she had been lulled in insanity : the birth of her child re¬ stored her to the cruel reality of things, hut gave her at the same time an object for whom to pre¬ serve at once life and reason. Every friend and relative had died off, and she was reduced to solitude and penury ; deep melancholy and angry impatience distorted her judgment, so that she could not persuade herself to disclose her distress to us. When she heard of the plan of universal emigration, she resolved to remain be-
hind with her child, and alone in wide England to live or die, as fate might decree, beside the grave of her beloved. She had hidden herself in one of the many empty habitations of Lon¬ don; it was she who rescued my Idris on the fatal twentieth of November, though my imme¬ diate danger, and the subsequent illness of Idris, caused us to forget our hapless friend. This circumstance had however brought her again in contact with her fellow-creatures; a slight ill¬ ness of her infant, proved to her that she was still bound to humanity by an indestructible tie ; to preserve this little creature's life became the object of her being, and she joined the first divi¬ sion of emigrants who went over to Paris. She became an easy prey to the methodist ; her sensibility and acute fears rendered her accessible to every impulse ; her love for her child made her eager to cling to the merest straw held out to save him. Her mind, once unstrung, and now tuned by roughest inharmonious hands, made her credulous : beautiful as fabled goddess, with
voice of unrivalled sweetness, burning with new lighted enthusiasm, she became a stedfast prose¬ lyte, and powerful auxiliary to the leader of the elect I had remarked her in the crowd, on the day we met on the Place Vendôme ; and, recollect¬ ing suddenly her providential rescue of my lost one, on the night of the twentieth of November, I reproached myself for my neglect and ingrati¬ tude, and felt impelled to leave no means that I could adopt untried, to recall her to her better self, and rescue her from the fangs of the hypo¬ crite destroyer. I will not, at this period of my story, record the artifices I used to penetrate the asylum of the Tuileries, or give what would be a tedious account of my stratagems, disappointments, and perseverance. I at last succeeded in entering these walls, and roamed its halls and corridors in eager hope to find my selected convert. In the evening I contrived to mingle unobserved with the congregation, which assembled in the chapel to listen to the crafty and eloquent harangue of vol. m. ι
their prophet. I saw Juliet near him. Her dark eyes, fearfully impressed with the restless ed are of madness, were fixed on him ; she held her in¬ fant, not yet a year old, in her arms ; and care of it alone could distract her attention from the words to which she eagerly listened. After the sermon w r asover, the congregation dispersed; all quitted the chapel except she whom I sought; her babe had fallen asleep ; so she placed it on a cushion, and sat on the floor beside, watching its tranquil slumber. I presented myself to her ; for a moment na¬ tural feeling produced a sentiment of gladness, which disappeared again, when with ardent and affectionate exhortation I besought her to ac¬ company me in flight from this den of supersti¬ tion and misery. In a moment she relapsed into the delirium of fanaticism, and, but that her gentle nature forbade, would have loaded me with execrations. She conjured me, she com¬ manded me to leave her—" Beware, O beware," she cried, "fiy while yet your escape is practicable.
Now you are safe; but strange soundsand in¬ spirations come on me at times, and if the Eternal should in awful whisper reveal to me his will, that to save my child you must be sacrificed, I would call in the satellites of him vou call the tyrant, they would tear you limb from limb; nor would I hallow the death of him whom Idris loved, by a single tear." She spoke hurriedly, with tuneless voice, and wild look ; her child awoke, and, frightened, began to cry; each sob went to the ill-fated mother's heart, and ¡die mingled the epithets of endearment she addressed to her infant, with angry commands that 1 should leave her, Had 1 had the mean«», î would have risked all, have torn her by force from the murderer's den, and trusted to the healing bahn of reason and affection. But I had no choice, no power even of longer btrugglo ; steps were heard along the gallery, and the voice of the preacher drew near, Juliet, saraining her child in a close embrace, fled by another passage. Even then I would ι 2
have followed her ; but my foe and his satellites entered ; I was surrounded, and taken prisoner. I remembered the menace of the unhappy Juliet, and expected the full tempest of the man's vengeance, and the awakened wrath of his followers, to fall instantly upon me. I was questioned. My answers were simple and sin- cere. " His own mouth condemns him," ex¬ claimed the impostor ; " he confesses that his in¬ tention was to seduce from the way of salvation our well-beloved sister in God ; away with him to the dungeon ; to-morrow he dies the death ; we are manifestly called upon to make an exam¬ ple, tremendous and appalling, to scare the children of sin from our asylum of the saved.^ My heart revolted from his hypocritical jar¬ gon : but it was unworthy of me to combat in words with the ruffian ; and my answer was cool ; while, far from being possessed with fear, methought, even at the worst, a man true to himself, courageous and determined, could fight his way, even from the boards of the scaffold,
through the herd of these misguided maniacs. <( Remember, 0 I said, " who I am ; and be well assured that Τ shall not die unavenged. Your legal magistrate, the Lord Protector, knew of my design, and is aware that I am here ; the ery of blood will reach him., and you and your miserable victims will long lament the tragedy you are about to act.° My antagonist did not deign to reply, even by a look;—"You know your duty," he said to his comrades,— (C obey." In a moment I was thrown on the earth, bound, blindfolded, and hurried away—liberty of limb and sight was only restored to me, when, surrounded by dungeon-walls, dark and impervious, I found myself a prisoner and alone. Such was the result of my attempt to gain over the proselyte of this man of crime; I could not conceive that he would dare put me to death. —Yet I was in his hands ; the path of his am¬ bition had ever been dark and cruel ; his power
was founded upon fear ; the one word vv hich might cause me to die, unheard, unseen, in the obscurity of my dungeon, might be easier to speak than the deed of mercy to act. He would not risk probably a public execution ; but a private assassination would at once terrify any of my companions from attempting a like feat, at the same time that a cautious line of conduct might enable him to avoid the enquiries and the vengeance of Adrian. Two months ago, in a vault more obscure than the one I now inhabited, I had revolved the design of quietly laying me down to die ; now I shuddered at the approach of fate. My imagination was busied in shaping forth the kind of death he would inflict. Would he allow me to wear out life with famine ; or was the food administered tome tobe mcdicined with death? Would he steal on me in my sleep ; or should í contend to the last with my murelerers, knowing, even * bile I struggled, that I must be over¬ come ? I lived upon an earth wdiose diminished
population a child's arithmetic might number; I had lived through long months with death stalk¬ ing close at my side, while at intervals the shadow of his skeleton-shape darkened my path. I had believed that I despised the grim phantom, and laughed his power to scorn. Any other fate I should have met with courage, nay, have gone out gallantly to encounter. But to be murdered thus at the midnight hour by cold-blooded assassins, no friendly hand to close my eyes > οι* receive my parting blessing— to die in combat, hate and execration—ah, why, my angel love, didst thou restore me to life, when already I had stepped within the portals of the tomb, now that so soon again I was to be flung back a mangled corpse í Hours passed—centuries. Could I give words to the many thoughts which occupied mc in eudless succession during this interval, I should fill volumes. The air was dank, the dungeon-floor mildewed and icy cold; hunger came upon me too, and no sound reached me
from without. To-morrow the ruffian hacì declared that I should die. When would to-morrow come ? Was it not already here ? My door was about to be opened. I heard the key turn, and the bars and bolts slowly re¬ moved. The opening of intervening passages permitted sounds from the interior of the palace to ι each me ; and I heard the clock strike one. They come to murder me, I thought ; this hour does not befit a public execution. I drew my¬ self up against tbe wall opposite the entrance ; I collected my forces, I rallied my courage, I would not fall a tame prey. Slowly the door receded on its hinges·—I was ready to spring for¬ ward to seize and grapple with the intruder, till the sight of who it was changed at once the tem¬ per of my mind. It was Juliet herself; pale and trembling she stood, a lamp in her hand, on the threshold of the dungeon, looking at me with wistful countenance, But in a moment sho¬ re-assumed her self-possession ; and her languid
eyes recovered their brilliancy. She said, " I am come to save you, Verney/* tc And yourself also,' 3 I cried : "dearest friend, can we indeed be saved r' 1 " Not a word," she replied, " follow me Г' I obeyed instantly. We threaded with light steps many corridors, ascended several flights of stairs, aud passed through long galleries; at the end of one she unlocked a low portal ; a rush of wind extinguished our lamp ; but, in lieu of it, we had the blessed moon-beams and the open face of heaven. Then first Juliet spoke:— ct You arc safe, 1 ' she said, " God bless you í — farewell Γ I seized her reluctant hand—" Dear friend," 1 ' I cried, " misguided victim, do you not intend to escape with me? Have you not risked all in facilitating my flight? and do you think, that I will permit you to return, and suffer alone the effects of that miscreant's rage ? Never !" " Do not fear for me,' 1 replied the lovely girl mournfully, « and do not imagine that without ϊ3
. the consent of our chief you could be without these walls. It is he that has saved you ; he assign¬ ed to me the part of leading you hither, because I am best acquainted with your motives for coming here, and can best appreciate his mercy in permitting you to depart. 1 ' " And are уои, 1 ' 1 cried, " the dupe of this man? He dreads me alive as an enemy, and dead he fears my avengers. By favouring this clandestine escape he preserves a shew of con¬ sistency to his followers; but mercy is far from his heart. Do you forget his artifices, his cruelty, and fraud ? As I am free, so are you. Come, Juliet, the mother of our lost Idris will welcome you, the noble Adrian will rejoice to receive you ; you will find peace and love, and better hopes than fanaticism can afford. Come, and fear not; long before day we shall be at Versailles ; close the door on this abode of crime —come, sweet Juliet, from hypocrisy and guilt to the society of the affectionate and good." I spoke hurriedly, but with fervour: and
while with gentle violence I drew her from tlie portal, some thought, some recollection of past scenes of youth and happiness, made her listen and yield to me; suddenly she broke away with a piercing shriek:—"My child, ray child ! be has my child ; my darling girl is my hostage." She darted from me into the passage; the gate closed between us—she was left in the fangs of this man of crime, a prisoner, still to in¬ hale the pestilential atmosphere which adhered to his demoniac nature ; the unimpeded breeze played on my cheek, the moon shone graciously upon me, my path was free. Glad to have escaped, yet melancholy in my very joy, I retrod my steps to Versailles.
CHAPTER VI.
Eventful winter passed ; winter, the res¬ pite of our ills. By degrees the sun, which with slant beams had before yielded the more extended reign to night, lengthened his diurnal journey, and mounted his highest throne, at once the fosterer of earth's new beauty, and her lover. We w r ho, like flies that congregate upon a dry rock at the ebbing of the tide, had played wantonly with time, allowing our passions, our hopes, and our mad desires to rule us, now heard the approaching roar of the ocean of de¬ struction, and would have fled ¡to ¡some [sheltered crevice, before the first w r ave broke over us.
We resolved without delay, to commence our journey to Switzerland; wc became eager to leave France. Under the icy vaults of the glaciers, beneath the shadow of the pines, the swinging of whose mighty branches was arrested by a load of snow ; beside the streams w hose in¬ tense cold proclaimed their origin to be from the slow-melting pdes of congelated waters, amidst frequent storms which might purify the air, we should find health, if in truth health were not herself diseased. We began our preparations at first with alacrity. We did not now bid adieu to oui native country, to the graves of those we loved, to the flowers, and streams, and trees, which had lived beside us from infancy. Small sor¬ row would be ours on leaving Paris. A scene of shame, when w e remembered our late con¬ tentions, and thought that we left behind a flock of miserable, deluded victims, bending under the tyranny of a selfish impostor. Small pangs should we feel in leaving the gardens,
woods, and halls of the palaces of the Bourbons at Versailles, which we feared would soon be tainted by the dead, when we looked forward to vallies lovelier than any garden, to mighty forests and halls, built not for mortal majesty, but palaces of nature's own, with the Alp of marmoreal whiteness for their walls, the sky for ' mt their roof. Yet our spirits flagged, as the day drew near which we had fixed for our departure. Dire visions and evil auguries, if such things were, thickened around us, so that in vain might men say— These are their reasons, they are natural,* we felt them to be ominous, and dreaded the future event enchained to them. That the night owl should screech before the noon-day sun, that the hard-winged bat should wheel
around the bed of beauty, that muttering thun¬ der should in early spring startle the cloudless air, that sudden and exterminating blight should fall on the tree and shrub, were unaccustomed, but physical events, less horrible than the mental creations of almighty fear. Some had sight of funeral processions, and faces all begrimed with tears, which flitted through the long avenues of the gardens, and drew aside the curtains of the sleepers at dead of night. Some heard wailing and cries in the air ; a mournful chaunt would stream through the dark atmo¬ sphere, as if spirits above sang the requiem of the human race. What was there in all this, but that fear created other senses within our frames, making us see, hear, and feel what was not ? What was this, but the action of diseased imaginations and childish credulity ? So might it be ; but what was most real, was the existence of these very fears ; the staring looks of horror, the faces pale even to ghastliness, the voices struck dumb with harrowing dread, of those
among us who saw and heard these things. Of this number was Adrian, who knew the delu¬ sion, yet could not cast off the clinging terror. Even ignorant infancy appeared with timorous shrieks and convulsions to acknowledge the pre¬ sence of unseen powers. We must go : in change of scene, in occupation, and such security as we still hoped to find, we should discover a cure for these gathering horrors. On mustering our company, we found them to consist of fourteen hundred souls, men, wo¬ men, and children. Until now therefore, we were undiminished in numbers, except by the desertion of those who had attached themselves to the impostor-prophet, and remained behind in Paris. About fifty French joined us. Our order of march was easily arranged; the ill success which had attended our division, deter¬ mined Adrian to keep all in one body. I, with an hundred men, went forward first as pur¬ veyor, taking the road of the Còte d'Or, through Auxerre, Dijon, Dole, over the Jura
to Geneva. I was to make arrangements, at every ten miles, for the accommodation of such numbers as I found the town or village would receive, leaving behind a messenger with a writ¬ ten order, signifying how many were to be quartered there. The remainder of our tribe was then divided into bands of fifty each, every division containing eighteen men, and the remainder, consisting of women and children. Each of these was headed by an officer, who carried the roll of names, by which they were each day to be mustered. If the numbers were divided at night, in the morning those in the van waited for those in th? rear. At each of the large towns before mentioned, we were ail to assemble ; and a conclave of the principal officers would hold council for the general weal. I went first, as I said; Adrian last. His mother, with Clara and Evelyn under her protection, re¬ mained also with him. Thus our order being determined, I departed. My plan was to go at first no further than Fontainebleau, where in a
few days I should be joined by Adrian, before I took flight again further eastward. My friend accompanied me a few miles from Versailles. He was sad ; and, in a tone of unac¬ customed despondency, uttered a prayer for our speedy arrival among the Alps, accompanied with an expression of vain regret that we were not already there. " In that case, w I observed, " we can quicken our march ; why adhere to Ъ plan whose dilatory proceeding you already disapprove ?" i( Nay," replied he, " it is too late now. A month ago, and we were masters of ourselves ; now,—" he turned his face from mc ; though gathering twilight had already veiled its expres¬ sion, he turned it yet more away, as he added— " a man died of the plague last night !" He spoke in a smothered voice, then sud¬ denly clasping his hands, he exclaimed, " Swift¬ ly, most swiftly advances the last hour for us all; as the stai s vanish before the sun, so will his near approach destroy us. ï have done
my best; with grasping hands and impotent strength, I have hung on the wheel of the cha¬ riot of plague ; but she drags me along with it, while, like Jaggernaut, she proceeds crushing out the being of all who strew the high road of life. Would that it were over—would that her procession achieved, we had all entered the tomb together !" Tears streamed from his eyes. * 6 Again and again," he continued, tc will the tragedy be acted ; again I must hear the groans of the dying, the wailing of thesurvivors ; again witness the pangs, which, consummating all, envelope an eternity in their evanescent existence. Why am I reserved for this ? Why the tainted wether of the flock, am I not struck to earth among the first f It is hard, very hard, for one of woman born to endure all that I endure !" Hitherto, with an undaunted spirit, and an high feeling of duty and worth, Adrian had fulfilled his self-imposed task. I had contem-
plated him with reverence, and a fruitless desire of imitation. I now offered a few words of en¬ couragement and sympathy. He hid his face in his hands 9 and while he strove to calm him¬ self, he ejaculated, " For a few months, yet for a few months more, let not, O God, my heart fail, or my courage be bowed down ; let not sights of intolerable misery madden this half- crazed brain, or cause this frail heart to beat against its prison-bound, so that it burst. I have believed it to be my destiny to guide and rule the last of the race of man, till death extin¬ guish my government; and to this destiny I submit. Ci Pardon me, Verney, I pain you, but I will no longer complain. Now I am myself again, or rather I am better than myself. You have known how from my childhood aspiring thoughts and high desires have warred with inherent disease and overstrained sensitiveness, till the latter became victors. You know how I placed
this wasted feeble hand on the abandoned helm of human government. I have been visited at times by intervals of t fluctuation ; yet, until now, I have felt as if a superior and indefatigable spirit had taken up its abode within me or rather incorporated itself with my weaker being. The holy visitant has for a time slept, perhaps to show me how pow f erless I am without its inspiration. Yet, stay for a while, О Power of goodness and strength ; disdain not yet this rent shrine of fleshly mortality, О immortal Ca¬ pability ! While one fellow creature remains to whom aid can be afforded, stay by and prop your shattered, falling engine Г His vehemence, and voice broken by irrepres¬ sible sighs, sunk to my heart ; his eyes gleamed in the gloom of night like two earthly stars ; and, his form dilating, his countenance beaming, truly it almost seemed as if at his eloquent ap¬ peal a more than mortal spirit entered his frame, exalting him above humanity.
He turned quickly towards me, and held out his hand. " Farewell, Verney,'' he cried, ťt brother of my love, farewell ; no other weak expression must cross these lips, I am alive again : to our tasks, to our comhats wuh our unvanquishable foe, for to the last I will struggle against h er."" He grasped my hand, and bent a look on me, more fervent and animated than any smile ; then, turning his horse's head, he touched the animal with the spur, and was out of sight in a moment. A man last night had died of the plague. Tlie quiver was not emptied, nor the bow unstrung. We stood as marks, while Parthian Pestilence aimed and shot, insatiated by conquest, unob¬ structed by the heaps of blain. A sickness of the soul, contagious even to my physical mecha¬ nism, came over me. My knees knocked to¬ gether, my teeth chattered, the current of my blood, clotted by sudden cold, painfully foiced
its way from my heavy heart. I did not fear for myself, but it was misery to think that we could not even save this icmnant. That those I loved might in a few days be as clay-cold as Idns in her antique tomb ; nor could strength of body or energy of mind ward off the blow. A sense of dcţuadtUion came over me. Did God create man, mciely in the end to become dead earth in the midst of healthful vegetating natine -1 Was he of no moie account to his Makei, than a field of com bh«hted m the ear p Wei e our proud dieanb thus to fack ť Our name was wntten " a little lower than the angel s ,"' and, behold, we were no be t tei than ephcmei ι.

АЬь í the mei e shcpheuľs hut of sti aw we passed on the road, contained in its structure the principi* of greater longev ny than
the whole race of man. How reconcile this sad change to our past aspirations, to our appa¬ rent powers ! Sudden an internal voice, articulate and clear, seemed to say :—Thus from eternity, it was de¬ creed : the steeds that bear Time onwards had this hour and this fulfilment enchained to them, since the void brought forth its burthen. Would you read backwards the unchangeable laws of Necessity ? Mother of the world ! Servant of the Omni¬ potent ! eternal, changeless Necessity ! who with busy fingers sittest ever weaving the indissoluble chain of events!—I will not murmur at thy acts. If my human mind cannot acknowledge that all that is, is right ; yet since what is, must be, I will sit amidst the ruins and smile. Truly we were not born to enjoy, but to submit, and to hope. Will not the reader tire, if I should minutely describe our long-drawn journey from Paris to Geneva? If, day by day, I should record, in the
form of a journal, the thronging miseries of oui- lot, could my hand write, or language afford words to express, the variety of our woe; the hustling and crowding of one deplorable event upon another? Patience, oh reader! whoever thou art, wherever thou dwellcst, whether of race spiritual, or, sprung from some .sunning pair, thy nature will be human, thv habitation the earth ; thou wilt here read of the acts of the extinct race, and wilt ask wondcringh, if thev, who Millered what thou findest recorded, weicof frail flesh and *-oft organization like thyself. Most true, (hey were —weep therefore; for surely, solitarv being, thou wilt be of gentle disposition; shed compassionate tears; but the while lend th\ attention to the Lde, and learn the deeds and sufferings of lh\ predecessors. Yet the kbt events that marked our progres through France were so full of strange horror and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too long in the narrai ion. If 1 were to dissect each incident, e\ erv small fragment of a second would VOL. 111. К
contain an harrowing tale ţ whose minutest word would curdle the blood in thy young veins. It is right that I should erect for thy instruction this monument of the foregone race ; but not that I should drag thee through the wards of an hospital, nor the secret chambers of the charnel- house. This tale, therefore, shall be rapidly unfolded. Images of destructie; », pictures of despair, the procession of the last triumph of death, shall be drawn before thee, swift as the rack driven by the north wind along the blotted splendour of the sky. Weed-grown fields, desolate towns, the wild approach of riderless horses had now become habitual to my eyes; nay, sights far worse, of the unburied dead, and human forms which were strewed on the road side, and on the steps of once frequented habitations, vv here, Through the fle^h that wabtes away Beneath the parching sun, the whitening bones Stai t forth, and moulder m the sable dot *
Sights like these had become—ah, woe the while! so familiar, that we had ceased to shudder, or spur our stung horses to sudden speed, as w e passed them. France in its best days, at leaht that part of France through which we travelled, liad been a cultivated desert, and the absence of enclosures, of cottages, and even of peasantry, was saddening to a traveller from sunny Italy. or busy England. Yet the towns were frequent and lively, and lhe cordial politeness and read\ smile of the wooden-shoed peasant restored good humour to the splenetic. Now, the old woman sat no more at the door with her distaff—the lank beggar no longer asked charity in cour¬ tier-like phrase ; nor on holidays did thepeasantry thread with slow grace the mazes of the dance- Silence, melancholy bride of death, went in pro¬ cession with him from town to town through the spacious region. We arrived at Fontainebleau, and speedily prepared for the reception of our friends. On mustering our numbers for the night, three were к 2
found missing. When I enquired for them, the man to whom I spoke, uttered the word ςί plague," and fell at my feet in convulsions; he also was infected. There were hard faces around me; for among my troop were sailors who had crossed the line times unnumbered, soldiers who, in Unssia and far America, had suffered famine, cold and danger, and men still sterner- featured, once nightly depredators in our over¬ grown metropolis ; men bred from their cradle to see the whole mnchine of society at work for their destructif n . I looked round, and saw upon the faces of all horror aud despair written in glaring character.-.. We passed four days at Fontainebleau. Several sickened and died, and in the mean time neither Adrian nor any of our friends appeared. My own troop was in commotion; to reach Switzer¬ land, to plunge into rivers of snow, and to dwell in eaves of ice, became the mad desire of all. Yet we liad promised to wait for the Earl; and he came not. My people demanded to be led
forward—rebellion, if so we might call what was the mere casting away of straw-formed shackles, appeared manifestly among them. They would away on the word without a leader. The only chance of safety, the only hope of pre¬ servation from every form of indescribable suffer¬ ing, was our keeping together. I told them this; while the most determined among them an¬ swered with sullenness,that they could take care of themselv es, and replied to my entreaties with scoffs and menaces. At length, on the fifth day, a messenger ar¬ rived from Adrian, bearing letters, which directed us to proceed to Auxerre, and there await his arrival, which would only be deferred for a few days. Such was the tenor of his puhlic letters. Those privately delivered to me, detailed at length the difficulties of his situation, and left the arrangement of my future plans to my own discretion. His account of the state of affairs at Versailles was brief, but the oral communica¬ tions of his messenger filled up his omissions,
and shewed me that perils of the most frightful nature were gathering around him. At first the re-awakening of the plague had been concealed ; but the number of deaths encreasing, the secret was divulged, and the destruction already achieved, was exaggerated by the fears of the survivors. Some emissaries of the enemy of man¬ kind, the accursed Impostors w r ere among them instilling their doctrine, that safety and life could only be ensured by submission to their chief ; and they succeeded so well, that soon, instead of desiring to proceed to Switzerland, the major part of the multitude, weak-minded women, and dastardly men, desired to return to Paris, and, by ranging themselves under the banners of the so called prophet, and by a cowardly worship of the principle of evil, to purchase respite, as they hoped, from impending death. The discord and tumult induced by these conflicting fears and passions, detained Adrian. It required all his ardour in pursuit of an object, and his pa- tience under difficulties, to calm and animate
such a number of his followers, as might coun¬ terbalance the panic of the rest, and lead them back to the means from which alone safety could be derived. He had hoped immediately to fol¬ low me; but, being defeated in this intention, he sent his messenger urging me to secure my own troop at such a distance from Versailles, as to prevent the contagion of rebellion from reaching them ; promising, at the same time, to join me the moment a favourable occasion should occur, by means of which he could withdraw the main boely of the emigrants from the evil influence at present exercised over them. I was thrown into a most painful state of un¬ certainty by these communications. My first impulse was that we shoulel ail return to Ver¬ sailles, there to assist in extricating our chief from his perils. I accordingly assembled my troop, anel proposed to them this retrograde movement, instead of the continuation of our journey to Auxerre. With one voice they re¬ fused to comply. The notion circulated among
them was, that the ravages of the plague alone detained the Protector ; they opposed his order to my request ; they came to a resolve to pro¬ ceed without me, should I refuse to accompany them. Argument and adjuration were lost on these dastards. The continual diminution of their own numbers, effected by pestilence, added a sting to their dislike of delay ; and my oppo¬ sition onlv served to brine; their resolution to a crisis. That same evening they departed to¬ wards Auxerre, Oaths, as from soldiers to their general, had been taken by them : these they broke. I also had engaged myself not to desert them ; it appeared to mc inhuman to ground any infraction of my word on theirs. The ¡same spirit that caused them to rebel against me, would impel them to desert each other; and the most dreadful sufferings would be the conse¬ quence of their journey in their present unor¬ dered and chief!ess array. These feelings for a time were paramount]; and, in obedience to them, I accompanied the rest towards Auxerre.
We arrived the same night at Villeneuve-la- Guiard, a town at the distance of four posts from Fontainebleau. When my compan-ous had retired to rest, and I was left alone to revolve and ruminate upon the intelligence I received of Adrian's situation, another view of the subject presented itself to me. What was I doing, and what was the object of my present movements ? Apparently 1 was to lead this troop of selfish and lawless men towards Switzerland, leaving behind my family and my selected friend, which, subject as they were hourly to the death that threatened to all, I might never see again. Was it not my first duty to assist the Protector, setting an example of attachment and duty ? At a crisis, such as the one I had reached, it is very difficult to balance nicely opposing interests, and that towards which our inclinations lead us, obstinately assumes the appearance of selfishness, even when we meditate a sacrifice. We are easily led at such times to make a compromise of the question ; and this was my present resource. к S
ï resolved that very night to ride to Versailles ; if I found affairs less desperate than I now deemed them, I would return without delay to my troop ; I had a vague idea that my arrival at that town, would occasion some sensation more or less strong, of which we might profit, for the purpose of leading forward the vacillating mul¬ titude—at least no time was to be lost—I visited the stables, I saddled my favourite horse, and vaulting on his back, without giving myself time for further reflection or hesitation, quitted Ville- neuvc-la-Guiard on my return to Versailles. I was glad to escape from my rebellious troop, and to lose sight for a time, of the strife of evil with good, where the former for ever remained triumphant. I was stung almost to madness by my uncertainty concerning the fate of Adrian, and grew reckless of any event, except what might lose or preserve my unequalled friend. With an heavy heart, that sought relief in the rapidity of my course, I rode through the night to Versailles. I spurred
my horse, who addressed his free limbs to speed, and tossed his gallant head in pritle. The constellations reeled swiftly by, swiftly each tree and stone and landmark fled past my onward career. I bared my head to the rush¬ ing wdnd, which bathed my brow in delightful coolness. As I lost sight of Villcneuve-la- Guiard, I forgot the sad drama of human mi¬ sery ; methought it was happiness enough to live. sensitive the while of the beauty of the verdure- clad earth, the star-bespangled sky, and the tameless wind that lent animation to the whole. My horse grew tired—and I, forgetful of his fatigue, stilt as he lagged, cheered him with my voice, and urged him with the spur. He was a gallant animal, and I did not wdsh to exchange him for any chance beast I might light on, leav¬ ing him never to be refound. All night we went forward ; in the morning he became sensible that we approached Versailles, to reach which as his home, he mustered his flagging strength. The distance we had come was not less than fifty
miles, yet he shot down the long Boulevards swift as an arrow ; poor fellow, as I dis¬ mounted at the gate of the castle, he sunk on his knees, his eyes were covered with a film, he fell on his side, a few gasps inflated his noble chest, and he died. I saw him expire with an anguish, unaccountable even to myself, the spasm was as the wrenching of some limb in agonizing torture, but it was brief as it was intolerable. I forgot him, as I swiftly darted through the open portal, and up the majestic stairs of this castle of victories—I heard Adrian's voice— О fool ! О woman, nur¬ tured, effeminate and contemptible being—I heard his voice, and answered it with convul¬ sive shrieks ; I rushed into the Hall of Her¬ cules, where he stood surrounded by a crowd, whose eyes, turned in wonder on me, reminded me that on the stage of the world, aman must repress such girlish extacies. I would have given worlds to have embraced him ; I dared not—Half iu exhaustion, half voluntarily, ï
threw myself at my length on the ground— dare I disclose the truth to the gentle offspring of solimele? I diel so, that I might kiss the elear and sacred earth he trod. I found even thing in a state of tumult. An emissary of the leader of the elect, hael been so w 01 ked up b} Ыь e hief, and by his own fanatical стсеч!, as to make an attempt on the hfe of the Protector and preserver of lost mankind. His hand was arre&ted while in the act of poignarding the Earl ; this cncumstance hael causeel the clamour I heard on my arrival at the castle, and the confused assembly of persons that I found assembled in the Salle dTIercule Although superstition and demo¬ niac fury had ciept among the emigiants», }et rêverai adhered with fidelity to their noble chieftain, anel many, whose faith anel love had been unhinged by fear, felt all their latent affec¬ tion íekindled by thU detestable attempt. A phalanx of faithful breasts closed round him ; the wretch, who, although a prisoner and in
bonds, vaunted his design, and madly claimed the crow r n of martyrdom, would have been torn to pieces, had not his intended victim inter¬ posed. Adrian, springing forward, shielded him with his own person, and commanded with energy the submission of his infuriate friends— at this moment I had entered. Discipline and peace were at length restored in the castle; and then Adrian went from house to house, from troop to troop, to soothe the disturbed minds of his followers, and recai them to their ancient obedience. Rut the fear of immediate death was still rife amongst these survivors of a world's destruction ; the horror occasioneel by the attempted assassination past away ; each eye turned towards Paris. Men love a prop so well, that they will lean on a pointed poisoned spear ; and such was he, the impostor, who, with fear of hell for his 'scourge, most ravenous wolf, played the driver to a credulous flock. It was a moment of suspense, that shook even
the resolution of the unyielding friend of man. Adrian for one moment was about to give in, to cease the struggle, and quit, with a few ad¬ herents, the deluded crowd, leaving them a miserable prey to their passions, and to the worse tyrant who excited them. But again, after a brief fluctuation of purpose, he resumed his courage and resolves, sustained by the bin- gleness of his purpose, and the untried spirit of benevolence which animated him. At this moment, as an omen of excellent import, his wretched enemy pulled destruction on his head, destroying with his own hands the dominion he had erected. His grand hold upon the minds of men, took its rise from the doctrine inculcated bv him, that those who believend in, and followed him, were the remnant to be saved, while all the rest of mankind were marked out for death. Now, at the time of the Flood, the omnipotent repented him that he had createli man, and as then with water, now with the arrows of pesti-
lence, was about to annihilate all, except those who obeyed his decrees, promulgated by the ipse divi t prophet. It is impossible to say on what foundations this man buiît his hopes of being able to carry on sucli an imposture. It is likely that he was fully aware of the lie which murderous nature might give to his assertions, and believed it to be the cast of a die, whether he should in future ages be reverenced as an inspired delegate from heaven, or be recognized as an impostor by the present dying generation. At any rate he resolved to keep up the drama to the last act. When, on the first approach of summer, the fatal disease again made its ra¬ vages among the followers of Adrian, the im¬ postor exultingly proclaimed the exemption of his own congrégation from the universal cala- mi ty. lie was believed ; his followers, hitherto bbut up in Paris, now came to Versailles Min¬ gling with the coward band there assembled, they reviled their admirable leader, and asserted their own superiority and exemption.
At length the plague, slow-footed, but sure in her noiseless advance, destroyed the illusion, in- vading the congregation of the elect, and showering promiscuous deatli among them. Their leader endeavoured to conceal this event ; he had a few followers, who, admitted into the arcana of his wickedness could help him in the execution of his nefarious designs. Those who sickened were immeeliatelv anel quietly with¬ drawn, the corei and a mi el night-grave disposeel of them for ever; while some plausible excuse was given for their absence. At last a female, whose maternal vigilance subdued oven the effects of the narcotics administered to her, be¬ came a witness of their murderous designs on her only child. Mad with horror, she woukl have burst among her deluded fellow-victims, and, wildly shrieking, have awaked the dull ear of night with the history of the Mend-like crime; when the Impostor, in his last act of rage and desperation, plunged a poignard in her bosom.
Thus wounded to death, her garments dripping with her own life-blood, bearing her strangled infatit in her arms, beautiful and young as she was, Juliet, (for it was she) denounced to the host of deceived believers, the wickedness of their leader. He saw the aghast looks of her auditors, changing from horror to furv—the names or those already sacrificed were echoed by their relatives, now assured of their loss. The wretch with that energy of purpose, wduth had borne him thus far in his guilty career, saw his danger, and resolved to evade the worst forms of it—he ru&hedon one of the foremost, seized a pistol from his girdle, and his loud laugh of derision mingled with the report of the weapon with which he destroyed himself. They left his miserable remains even where they lay ; they placed the corpse of poor Juliet and her babe upon a bier, and all, with hearts bubdued to saddest regret, m long procession walked tow aids \ eradles They met troops
of those who had quitted the kindly protection of Adrian, and were journeying to join the fanatics. The tale of horror was recounted—all turned back ; and thus at last, accompanied by the undiminished numbers of surviving hu¬ manity, and preceded by the mournful emblem of their recovered reason, they appeared before Adrian, and again and for ever vowed obedience to his commands, and fidelity to his cause.
CHAPTER VII. These events occupied so much time, that June had numbered more than half its elays, before we again commenced our long-protracted journey. The day after my return to Ver¬ sailles, six men, from among those I had left at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, arrived, with intelli¬ gence, that the rest of the troop hael already proceeded towards Switzerland. We went for¬ ward in the same track. It is strange, after an interval of time, to look back on a period, which, though short in itself, appeared, when in actual progress, to be drawn out interminably. By the end of July we entered Dijon; by the end of July
those hours, da^s, and weeks had mingled vvith the ocean of forgotten time, which in their pas¬ sage teemed with fatal e\ents and agonizing sorrow. By the end of July, little more than a month had fff me b\, if man's life were mea- >ured by the rising and setting of the sun : but, alas ! in that interval ardent youth had become gre} -haired ; furrows deep and imeraseable were trenched in the blooming cheek nf the young mother ; the elastic НтЬъ of early manhood, paraly/ed as by the burthen of }ears, assumed the decrepitude of age. Nights passed, during whose fatal darkness the sun grew* old before it rose, and burning days, to cool whose baleful heat the balmy eve, lingering far iu eastern climes, came lagging and ineffectual, davs, iti which the dial, radiant in its noon-day station, moved not ils shadow the space of a little hour, until a whole hfe of sorrow had brought the sufferer to an untimely grave. We departed from Versailles fifteen hundred souls. Wc set out on the eighteenth of June.
We made a long procession, in which was con¬ tained every dear relationship, or tic of love, that existed in human society. Fathers and husbands, with guardian care, gathered their dear relatives around them ; wives and mothers looked for support to the manly form beside them, and then with tender anxiety bent their eyes on the infant troop around. They were sad, but not hopeless. Each thought that some one would be saved; each, with that pertina¬ cious optimism, which to the last characterized our human nature, trusted that their beloved family would be the one preserved. We passed through France, and found it empty of inhabitants. Some one or two natives survived in the larger towns, which they roamed through like ghosts ; we received therefore small cuerease to our numbers, and such decrease through death, that at last it became easier to count the scanty list of survivors. As we never deserted any of the sick, until their death per¬ mitted us to commit their remains to the shelter
of a grave, our journey was long, while every¬ day a frightful gap was made in our troop — they died by tens, by fifties, by hundreds. No mercy was shewn by death ; we ceased to ex¬ pect it, and every day welcomed the sun with the feeling that we might never see it rise again. The nervous terrors and fearful visions which had scared us during the spring, continued to visit our coward troop during this sad journey. Every evening brought its fresh creation of spectres ; a ghost was depicted by every blighted tree ; and appalling shapes were ma¬ nufactured from each shaggy bush. By de¬ grees these common marvels palled on us, and then other wonders were called into being. Once it was confidently asserted, that tlie sun rose an hour later than its seasonable time; again it was discovered that he grew paler and paler ; that shadows took an uncommon appear¬ ance. It was impossible to have imagined, dur¬ ing the usual calm routine of life men had be¬ fore experienced, the terrible effects produced
by these extra\agant delusion·*: m truth, of such little worth are our senses, when unsup¬ ported by concurring testimony, tliat it was with the utmost difficulty I kept myself free from the belief in supernatural events, to which the major part of our people îeadilv gave credit. Being one sane amidst a crowd of the mad, í hardly dared assert to m\ own mind, that the \ ast luminary had undergone no change—that the shadows of night were unthickened by innu- meiable shapes of awe and terror; or that the wind, as it Ming in the trees, or whistled round an empty building, was not pregnant w itli sounds of wailing and despair. Sometimes rea¬ lities took ghostly slhipis ; and it was impossible for one's blood not to curdle at the perception of an ел idem mixture of what we knew to be true, with the \ыопаг\ semblance of all that we feared. Once, at the dusk of the evening, we saw a ligure all in white, apparently of more than human stature, flourishing about the road, now
'hrowkig up its arms, now leaping to an asto_ nishing height in the a?r, then turning round »evcral times successively, then raising itself to its full height and gesticulating violently. Our troop, on the alert to discover anel believe in the supernatural, made a halt at som« 1 distance from this shape ; and, a& it became darker, there was something appalling even to the incredulous, in the lonely spectre, whose gambols, if they hardly accorded with spiritual chgnitv, were be} ond human pow с is. Now it leapt right up in the air, now sheer over a high hedge, and was again the moment after in the road before us. lìy the time 1 came up, the fright experienced by the spectators of this ghostly exhibition, be¬ gan to manifest itself in the fhght of some, and the close huddling together of the rest. Our goblin now perceived us; he approached, and, as we drew reverentially back, made a low bow. The sight was irresistibly ludicrous even to our hapless band, and his politeness was hailed by a bhout of laughter ;—then, again springing up, vol. Ш. ь
as a last effort, it sunk to the ground, and be¬ came almost invisible through the dusky night. This circumstance again spread silence and fear through the troop ; the more courageous at length advanced, and, raising the dying wretch, discovered the tragic explanation of this wild ■ scene. It was an opera-dancer, and had been one of the troor> which deserted from Ville¬ neuve la-Guiard : falling sick, he had been de¬ serted by his companions ; in an access of de¬ lirium he had fancied himself on the stage, and, poor fellow, fiis dying sense eagerly accepted the last human applause that could ever be bestow r ed on his grace and agility, At another time we w r ere haunted for several days by an apparition, to which our people gave the appellation of the Black Spectre. We never saw it except at evening, when his coal black >steed, his mourning dress, and plume of black feathers, had a majestic and awe-striking ap¬ pearance; his face, one said, who had seen it for a moment, was ashy pale ; he had lingered far
behind the rest of his troop, and suddenly at a turn in the road, saw the Black Spectre coming towards him ; he hid himself in fear, and the horse and his rider slowly past, while the moon¬ beams fell on the face of the latter, displaying its unearthly hue. Sometimes at dead of night, as we watched the sick, we heard one galloping through the town ; it was the Black Spectre come in token of inevitable death. He ere w ffiant tall to vulgar eyes ; an icy atmosphere, they said, surrounded him ; when he was heard, all ani¬ mals sliuddered, and the dying knew that their last hour was come. It was Death himself, they declared, come visibly to seize on subject earth, and quell at once our decreasing numbers, sole rebels to his law. One day at noon, we saw a dark mass on the road before us, and, coming up, beheld the Black Spectre fallen from his horse, lying in the agonies of disease upon tbe ground. He did not survive many hours ; and his last words disclosed the secret of his mysteri¬ ous conduct. He was a French noble of dis- L· «v
tinction, who, from the effects of plague, had been left alone in his district; during many months, he had wandered from town ю town, from province to province, seeking some survivor for a companion, and abhorring the loneliness to which he was condemned. When he discovered our tioop, fear of contagion conquered his love of society. He dared not join us, \ct he could not resolve to lose sight of us, sole human beings who besides himself existed in wide and fertile France; so he accompanied us in the spectral guise Τ have described, till pestilence gathered him to a larger congregation, even that of Dead Mankind. It had been well, if such vain terrors could have distracted ели* thoughts from more tangible eviK But these w сте too dreadful and too m.iiiv not to force themselves into e\ery thought, every moment, of our lives. We were obliged to balí at different periods for days together, till another wild jet another was consigned as a clod to the vast clod which had been once our
living mother. Thus we continued travelling during the hottest season ; and it was not till the first of August, that we, the emigrants,—reach ľ, there were just eighty of us in number,—entered the gates of Dijon. Wc had expected this moment with eagerness, for пол' we had accomplished the worst part of our drear journev, and Switzerland was near at hand. Yet how could wc congratulate ourselves on any event thus imperfectly fulfilled? Were these miserable beings, who, worn and wretched, passed in soirowful procession, the sole remnants of the race of man, which, like a flood, had once spread over and possessed the whole earth ? It had come down clear and unimpeded from its primal mountain source in Ararat, and grew from a puny streamlet to a vast perennial river, generation after generation flowing on ceaselessly. The same, but di verbified, it grew, and swept onwards towards the absorbing ocean, whose dim shores we now reached. It had been the mere plaything of nature, when first it
crept out of uncreative void into light ; but thought brought forth power and knowledge ; and, clad with these, the race of man assumed dignity and authority. It was then no longer the mere gardener of earth, or the shepherd of her flocks; "it carried with it an imposing and majestic aspect ; it had a pedigree and illustra¬ ting ancestors ; it had its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records and titles.'"* This was all over, now that the ocean of death had sucked in the slackening tide, and its source was dried up. We first had bidden adieu to the state of things which having ex- isted many thousand years, seemed eternal ; such a state of government, obedience, traffic, and domestic intercourse, as had moulded our hearts and capacities, as far back as memory could reach. Then to patriotic zeal, to the arts, to reputation, to enduring f ¿ime, to the name of country, we had bidden farewell. We
saw depart all hope of retrieving our ancient state—all expectation, except the feeble one of saving our individual lives from the wreck of the past- To preserve these we had quitted England—England, no more ; for without her children, what name could that barren island claim ? With tenacious grasp we clung to such rule and order as could best save us ; trusting that, if a little colony could be preserved, that would suffice at some remoter jieriod to restore the lost community of mankind. But the game is up ! We must all die ; nor leave survivor nor heir to the wide inheritance of earth. We must all die! The species ot' man must perish ; his frame of exquisite work¬ manship ; the wondrous mechanism of his senses ; the noble proportion of his godlike limbs ; his mind, the throned king of these ; must perish. Will the earth still keep her place among the planets ; will she still journey with unmarked regularity round the sun ; will the seasons change, the trees adorn themselves
with leaves, and flowers shed their fragrance, iu solitude ? Will the mountains remain un¬ moved, and streams still keep a downward course towards the vast abyss; will the tides rise and fall, and the winds fan universal na¬ ture ; will beasts pasture, birds fly, and fishes swim, when man, the lord, possessor, perceiverj and recouler of all theæ things, has passed away, as though he had never been ? Θ, what mockery is this! Surely death is not death, and humanity is not extinct ; but merely passed into other shapes, unsubjected to our percep¬ tions. Death is a vast portal, an high road to life : let us hasten to pass ; let «s exist no more- in this living death, but die that we may live í We had longed with inexpressible earnestness to reach Dijon, since we had fixed on it, as a kind of station in our progress. But now we entered it with a torpor more painful than acute suffering. We had come slowly but ir¬ revocably to the opinion, that our utmost efforts wouid not preserve one human being alive. We-
took our hands therefore away from the long grasped rudder ; and the frail vessel on which we floated, seemed, the government over her suspended, to rush, prow foremost, into the dark abyss of the billows. A gush · f grief, a wanton profusion of tears, and vain lamen ».s, and overflowing tenderness, and passionate hut fruitless clinging to the priceless few that re¬ mained, was followed by languor and reckless¬ ness. During this disastrous journey we lost all those, not of our own family, to whom we had particularly attached ouivelvob among the mi 1 '- vivors. It were not well to fill these page-; with a mere catalogue of losses ; yet I cannot refrain from this last mention of tho^e principally deat to us. The little mrl whom Adrian had rescind о from utter desertion, during our ride tlnough l^ondon on the twentieth of Novembet, died л Auxerre, The poor child had attached bet ч if greatly to us; and the suddenness of her death added to our sorrow. In the morning we hud L 3
seen her apparently in health—in the evening, Lucy, before we retired to rest, visited our quarters to say that she was dead. Poor Lucy herself only survived, till we arrived at Dijon. She had devoted herself throughout to the nursing the sick, and attending the friendless. Her excessive exertions brought on a slow fever, which ended in the dread disease whose approach soon released her from her sufferings. She had throughout been endeared to us by her good qualities, by her ready and cheerful execution of every duty, and mild acquiescence in every turn of adversity. When we consigned her to the tomb, we seemed at the same time to bid a final adieu to those peculiarly feminine virtues conspicuous in her ; uneducated and unpre¬ tending as she was, she was distinguished for patience, forbearance, and sweetness. These, with all their train of qualities peculiarly Eng¬ lish, would never again be revived for m. This type of all that was most worthy of ad¬ miration in her class among my countrywomen,
was placed under the sod of desert France ; and it was as a second separation from our country to have lost sight of her for ever. The Countess of Windsor died during our abode at Dijon. One morning I was informed that she wished to see me. Her message made me remember, that several days had elapsed since I had last seen her. Such a cir¬ cumstance had often occurred during our jour¬ ney, when I remained behind to watch to their elose the last moments of some one of our hap¬ less comrades, and the rest of the troop past on before me. But there was something in the manner of her messenger, that made me sus¬ pect that all was not right. A caprice of the imagination caused me to conjecture that some ill had occurred to Clara or Evelyn, rather than to this aged lady. Our fears, for ever on the stretch, demanded a nourishment of horror; and it seemed too natural an occurrence, too like past times, for the old to die before th«» young.
I found the venerable mother of my Idri* lying en a couch, her tall emaciated figure stretched out ; her face fallen away, from whicb the nose stood out in sharp profile, and her large tlark eyes, hollow and deep, gleamed with such light as may edge a thunder cloud at sun-set All was shrivelled and dried up, except these lights ; her voice too was fearfully changed, as she spoke to me at intervals. " I am afraid, 4 * said she, "that it is selfish in me to have asked you to visit the old woman again, before she dies : yet perhaps it would have been a greater shock to hear suddenly that I was dead, than to see me first thus" I elapsed her shrivelled hand : " Are you in¬ deed so ill ?" I asked. " Do you not perceive death in my face," re¬ plied she, " it is strange ; I ought to have ex¬ pected this, and yet I confess it has taken me unaware. í never clung to life, or enjoyed it, till these last months, while among those I sense¬ lessly deserted; and it is hard to be snatched
immediately away. I an glad, however, that I am not a victim of the plague ; probably I should have died at this hour, though the world had continued as it was in my youth.* 1 She spoke with difficulty, and I perceived that she regi 4ted the necessity of death, ev en more than she cared to confess. Yet she had not to complain of an undue shortening of existence ; her faded person shewed that life had naturally spent itself. We had been alone at first ; now Clara entered ; the Countess turned to her with a smile, and took the hand of this lovely child ; her roseate palm and snowy fingers, contrasted with relaxed fibres and yellow hue of those of her aged friend ; she bent to kiss her, touching her withered mouth with the warm, full lips of \outh. " Verney," said the Countess, " I need not recommend this dear pirl to you, for your own sake you will preserve her. Were the world as it w as, ï should have a thousand sage precautions to impress, that one so sensitive, good, and beauteous, might escape the dangers
that used to lurk for the destruction of the fair and excellent. This is all nothing now. " I commit yon, my kind nurse, ţo your uncle's care; to yours I entrust the dearest relic of my better self. Be to Adrian, sweet one, what you have been to me—enliven his sad¬ ness with your sprightly sallies; soothe hjs anguish by your sober and inspired converse, when he is dying ; nurse him as you have done røe." Clara burst into tears ; " Kind girl, r said the Countess, " do not weep for me. Many dear friends are left to you." " And yet," cried Clara, " you talk of their dying also. This is indeed cruel—how could I live, if they were gone? J f it were possible for my beloved protector to die before me, I could not nurse him ; I could only die too." The venerable lady survived this scene only twenty-four hours. She was the last tie binding us ţo the ancient state of things, It was impos¬ able to look on her, and npt call to mind in their
wonted guise, events and persons, as alien to our present situation as the disputes of Themis- tocles and Aristides, or the wars of the two roses in our native land. The crown of Eng¬ land had pressed her brow; the memory of my father and his misfortunes, the vain struggles of the late king, the images of Raymond, Evadne, and Perdita, who had lived in the world's prime, were brought vividly before us. We consigned her to the oblivious tomb with reluctance ; and when I turned from her grave, Janus veiled his retrospective face ; that which gazed on future generations had long lost its faculty. After remaining a week at Dijon, until thirty of our number deserted the vacant ranks of life, we continued our way towards Geneva. At noon on the second day we arrived at the foot of Jura. We halted here during the heat of the day. Here fifty human beings—fifty, the only human beings that survived of the food- teeming earth, assembled to read in the looks of each other ghastly plague, or wasting sorrow,
desperation, or worse, carelessness of future 07 present evil. Here w e assembled at the foot of this mighty wall of mountain, under a spreading w r alnut tree; a brawling stream refreshed the green sward by its sprinkling ; and the bus\ grasshopper chirped among the thyme. We clustered together a groupe of wretched suf- feiers. A mother cradled iu her enfeebled arms the child, last of many, whose glazed eye was about to close for ever. Here beauty, late glow¬ ing in youthful lustre and consciousness, now wan and neglected, knelt fanning vv ith uncertain motion the beloved, who кь, striving to paint his features, distorted by illness, w ith a thankful smile. There an hard-featured, weather-worn veteran, having prepared his meal, sat, his head dropped on his breast, the úseles» knife falling from his grasp, his limbs utterly relaxed, as thought of wife and child, and dearest relative, all lost, passed acros» his recollection. There sat a man who for forty years had basked in fortune's tranquil sunshine ; he held the hand
of his last hope, his beloved daughter, who had just attained womanhood ; and he gazed on her with anxious eyes, while she tried to rally her fainting spirit to comfort him. Here a servant, faithful to the last, though dying, waited on one, who, though still erect with health, gazed with gasping fear on the variety of woe around. Adrian stood leaning against a tree; he held a book in his hand, but his eye wandered from the pages, and sought mine ; they mingled a sympa¬ thetic glance; his looks confessed that his thoughts had quitted the inanimate print, for pages more pregnant with meaning, more absorb¬ ing, spread out before him. By the margin of the stream, apart from all, in a tranquil nook, where the purling brook kissed the green sward gently, Clara and К veiy n were at play, some¬ times beating the water with large boughs, sometimes w r atching the summer-flies that sported upon it, Evelyn now chased a butter¬ fly—now gathered a flower for his cousin ; and his laughing cherub-face and elevar brow told of
the light heart that beat in his bosom. Clara, though she endeavoured to give herself up to his amusement, often forgot him, as she turned to observe Adrian and me. She w r as now fourteen, and retained her childish appearance, though in height a woman ; she acted the part of the ten- dercst mother to my little orphan boy ; to see her playing with him, or attending silently and sub¬ missively on our wants, you thought only of her admirable docility and patience ; but, in her soft eyes, and the veined curtains that veiled them, in the clearness of her marmoreal brow, and the tender expression of her lips, there was an intel¬ ligence and beauty that at once excited admira¬ tion and love. When the sun had sunk towards the precipi¬ tate west, and the evening shadows grew long, we prepared to ascend the mountain The at¬ tention that we were obliged to pay to the sick, made our progress slow. The winding road, though steep, presented a confined view of rocky fields and hilh, each hiding the other, till our
farther ascent disclosed them in succession We were seldom shaded from the declining sun, whose slant Ьеапь weie instinct with exhausting heat. There are times when minor difficulties grow gigantic—times, when аь the Hebrew poet expressively terms it, '· the grasshopper is a burthen;" so was it with our ill fated party this evening. Adrian, usuallv the first to rally his spirits, and dash foremost into fatigue and hard¬ ship, with relaxed limbs and declined head, the reins hanging loosely in his grasp, left the choice of the path to the instinct of his horse, now and then painfully rousing himself, when the steep¬ ness or the ascent required that he should keep his beat with better caie. Fear and horror en¬ compassed me. Did his languid air attest that he abo was struck with contagion ? How long, when I look on this matchless specimen of mor¬ tality, may I perceive that his thought answers mine? how long will those limbs obey the kindly spirit within? how long will light and hfe dwell
in the eyes of this my sole remaining friend ? Thus pacing slowly, each hill surmounted, only presented another to be ascended ; each jutting corner only discovered another, sister to the last, endlessly. Sometimes the pressure of sickness in one among us, caused the whole cavalcade to halt ; the call for water, the eagerly expressed wish to repose ; the cry of pain, and suppressed sob of the mourner—such were the sorrowful attendants of our passage of the Jura. Adrian had gone first. I saw him, while I was detained by the loosening of a girth, struggling with the upward path, seemingly more difficult than any we had yet passed. He reached the top, and tbe dark outline of his figure stood in relief against the sky. He seemed to behold something unexpected and wonderful; for, pausing, his head stretched out, bis arms for a moment extended, he seemed to give an All Hail ! to some new vision. Urged by curiosity, I hurried tojóin hím. After battling for many
tedious minutes with the precipice, the same scene presented itself to me, which had wrapt him in extatic wonder. Nature, or nature's favourite, this lovely earth, presented her most unrivalled beauties in resplendent and sudden exhibition. Below, far, far below, even as it were in the yawning abyss of the ponderous globe, lay tbe placid and azure expanse of lake Leman; vine-covered hills hedged it in, and behind dark mountains in cone-like shape, or irregular cyclopean wall, served for further defence. But beyond, and high above all, as if the spirits of the air had suddenly unveiled their bright abodes, placed in scaleless altitude in the stainless sky, heaven- kissing, companions of the unattainable ether, were the glorious Alps, clothed in dazzling robes "of light by the setting sun. And, as if the world's wonders were never to be exhausted, their vast im¬ mensities, their jagged crags,' and roseate paint¬ ing, appeared again in the lake below, dipping their proud heights beneath the unruffled waves
— palaces for the Naiads of the placid waters. Tow ns and villages lay scattered at the foot of Jura, which, with dark ravine, and black pro¬ montories, su etched its roots into the watery expanse beneath. Carried away by wonder, I forgot the de ith of nun, and the Ihing and beloved fiicnd near me. When I turned, I saw tearb streaming from his eves»; his thin hands pressed one against the other, his animated coun¬ tenance beaming with admiration, " Why,"' died he, atlast, "Why, oh heart, vvhisperest thou of gi ief to me ť Юппк m the beauty of that scene, and possess delight beyond what a fabled paradise could afford."" By degrees, our whole paity surmounting the steep, joined us ; not one among them, but gave visible tokens of admiration, surpassing any be¬ fore e\peiienced. One cried, " God reveals his heav c n to us ; we may die blessed/ 1 Another and another, with bioken exclamations, and ex¬ travagant phiases, endeavoured to express the intoxicating effect of tins wonder of nature. So
wc remained awhile, lightened of the pressing burthen of fate, forgetful of death, into whose night wc were about to plunge; no longer re¬ flecting that our eyes now and for ever were and would be the only ones which might perceive the divine magnificence of this terrestrial exhibition. An enthusiastic transport, akin to happiness, burst, like a sudden ray from the sun, on our darkened life. Precious attribute of woe-worn humanity î that can snatch extatic emotion, even from under the very share and harrow, that ruthlessly ploughs up and lays waste every hope. This evening was marked by another event, 1'assing through Ferney in our way to Geneva, unaccustomed sounds of music arose from the rural church which stood embosomed in trees, surrounded by smokeless, vacant cottages. The peal of an organ with rich swell awoke the mute air, lingering along, and mingling with the in¬ tense beauty that clothed the rocks and woods, and waves around.
Music —the language of the immortals, dis· closed to us as testimony of their existence- music, " silver key of the fountain of tears,"" child of love, soother of grief, inspirer of heroism and ra( iant thoughts, О music, in this our desolation, we had forgotten thee ! Nor pipe at eve cheered us, nor harmony of voice, nor linked thrill of string; thou earnest upon us now, like the revealing of other forms of being; and transported as we had been by the loveliness of nature, fancying that we beheld the abode of spirits, now we might well imagine that we heard their melodious communings. We paused in such awe as Mould seize on a pale \olaribt, \ kiting some holy shrine at mid¬ night ; if she beheld animated and smiling, the image which she worshipped. We all stood mute; many knelt. In a few minutes however, wc v ere recalled to human wonder and sympa¬ thy by a familiar strain. The air was Haydn's **" New-Created World," and, old and droop¬ ing as humanity had become, the world yet
fresh as at creation's day, might still be worthily celebrated by such an hymn of praise. Adrian and I entered the church ; the nave was empty, thouirh the smoke of incense rose from the altar, bringing with it the recollection of vast congregations, in once thronged cathedrals; we went into the loft. A blind old man sat at the bellows; his whole soul was ear; and as he sat in the attitude of attentive listening, a bright glow of pleasure was» diffused over his countenance ; for, though his lack-lustre eye could not reflect the beam, yet his parted lips, and every line of his face and venerable brow spoke delight. A young woman sat at the keys, perhaps twenty years of age. Her auburn hair hung on her neck, and her fair brow shone in its own beauty ; but her droop¬ ing eyes let fall fast-flowing tears, while the con¬ straint she exercised to suppress her sobs, and still her trembling, flushed her else pale cheek ; she was thin; languor, and alas! sickness, bent her form.
We stood looking at the pair, forgetting what we heard in the absorbing sight; till, the last chord struck, the peal died away in lessening reverberations. The mighty voice, márgame we might call it, for we could in no way associate it with mechanism of pipe or key, stilled its sonorous tone, and the girl, turning to lend her assistance to her aged companion, at length perceived us. It was her father ; and she, since childhood, had been the guide of his darkened steps. They were Germans from Saxony, and, emigrating thither but a few years before, had formed new ties with the surrounding villagers. About the time that the pestilence had broken out, a young German student had joined them. Their sim¬ ple history was easily divined. He, a noble, loved the fair daughtei of the poor musician, and followed them in their flight from the per¬ secutions of his friends; but soon the mighty leveller came with unblunted scythe to mow, together with the grass, the tall flowers of the
field. The youth was an early victim. She preserved herself for her father's sake. His blindness permitted her to continue a delusion, at first the child of accident—and now solitary beings, sole survivors in the land, he remained unacquainted with the change, nor was aware that when he listened to his child's music, the mute mountains, senseless lake, and unconscious trees, were, himself excepted, her sole audi¬ tors. The very day that we arrived she had been attacked by symptomatic illness,. She was para¬ lyzed with horror at the idea of leaving her aged, sightless father alone on the empty earth ; but she had not courage to disclose the truth, and the very excess of her desperation ani- mated her to surpassing exertions. At the accustomed vesper hour, she led him to the chapel; and, though trembling and weeping on his account, she playei, without fault in time, or error in note, the hymn written to celebrate m 2
the creation of the adorned earth, soon to be her tomb. We came to her like visitors from heaven itself; her high-wrought courage ; her hardly sustained firmness, fled with the appearance of relief. With a shriek she rusheel towards us, embraced the knees of Adrian, and uttering but the words, " О save my father !" with sobs and hysterical crieb, opened the long-shut flooelgates of her woe. Poor girl !—she and her father now lie side by side, beneath the high walnut-tree where her lover reposes, and which in her dying moments she had pointed out to us. Her father, at length aware of his daughter's danger, unable to see the changes e)f her dear countenance, obstinately held her hand, till it was chilled and stiffened by death. Nor did he then move or .speak, till, twelve hours after, kindly death took him to his breakless repose. They rest beneath the sod, the tree their monumen'»; —the hak
lowed spot is distinct in my memory, paled in by craggy Jura, and the far, immeasurable Alps ; the spire of the churcii they frequented still points from out the embosoming trees ; and though her hand be cold, still methinks the sounds of divine music which they loved wander about, solacing their gentle ghosts.
CHAPTER VIII.
We had now reached Switzerland, so long the final mark and aim of our exertions. We had looked, I know not wherefore, with hope and pleasing expectation on her congregation of hills and snowy crags, and opened our bosoms with renewed spirits to the icy Biz, which even at Midsummer used to come from the northern glacier laden with cold. Yet how could we nourish expectation of relief ? Like our native England, and the vast extent of fertile France, this mountain-embowered land was desolate of its inhabitants. Nor bleak mountain-top, nor
snow-nourished rivulet ; not the ice-laden Biz, nor thunder, the tamer of contagion, had pre¬ served them—why therefore should we claim exemption ? Who was there indeed to save ? What troop had we brought fit to stand at bay, and combat with the conqueror? We were a failing rem¬ nant, tailed to mere submission to the coming blow. A train half dead, through fear of death —a hopeless, unresisting, almost reckless crew, which, in the tossed bark of life, had given up all pilotage, and resigned themselves to the de¬ structive force of ungoverned winds. Like a few furrows of unrcaped corn, which, left standing on a wide field after the rest is gathered to the garner, are swiftly borne down by the winter storm. Like a few straggling swallows, which, remaining after their fellows had, on the fir,->t unkind breath of passing autumn, migrated to genial climes, were struck to earth by the first frost of November. Like a stray sheep that wanders over the sleet-beaten hill-side, while.
the flock is in the pen, and dies before morning- dawn. Like a cloud, like one of many that were spread in impenetrable woof over the sky» which, when the shepherd north has driven its companions " to drink Antipodean noon, 11 fades and dissolves in the clear ether—Such were we I We left the fair margin of tlie beauteous lake of Geneva, and entered the Alpine ravines ; tracing to its source the brawling Arve> through the rock-bound valley of Servox, beside the mighty waterfalls, and under tbe shadow of the inaccessible mountains, we travelled on ; while the luxuriant walnut-tree gave place to the dark pine, whose musical branches swung in the wind, and whose upright forms had braved a thou¬ sand storms—till the verdant sod, the flowery dell, and shrubhery hill were exchanged for the sky-piercing, untrodden, seedless rock, te the bones of the world, waiting to he clothed with every thing necessary to give life and beauty."* Strange tliat we should seek shelter here !
Surely, if, in those countries where earth was wont, like a tender mother, to nourish her chil¬ dren, we had found her a destroyer, we need not seek it here, where stricken by keen penury she seems to shudder through her stony veins. Nor were we mistaken in our conjecture. We vainly sought the vast and ever moving glaciers of Chamounix, rifts of pendant ice, seas of con- gelated waters, the leafless groves of tempest- battered pines, dells, mere paths for the loud avalanche, and hill-tops, the resort of thunder¬ storms. Pestilence reigned paramount even here. By the time ihat day and night, like twin sisters of equal growth, shared equally their dominion over the hours, one by one, be¬ neath the ice-caves, beside the waters springing from the thawed snows of a thousand winters, another and yet another of the remnant of the race of Man, closed their eyes for ever to the light. Yet we were not quite wrong in seeking a scene like this, whereon to close the drama. m ii
Nature, true to the last, consoled us in the very heart of misery. Sublime grandeur of outward objects soothed our hapless hearts, and were in harmony with our desolation. Many sorrows have befallen man during his chequered course ; and many a woe-stricken mourner has found himself sole survivor among many. Our misery took its majestic shape and colouring from the vast ruin, that accompanied and made one with it. Thus on lovely earth, many a dark ravine contains a brawling stream, shadowed by roman¬ tic rocks, threaded by mossy paths—but all, except this, wanted the mighty back-ground, tf>o towering Alps, whose snowy capes, or bared ridges, lifted us from our dull mortal abode, to the palaces of Natures own. This solemn harmony of event and situation regulated our feelings, and gave as it were fitting costume to our last act. Majestic gloom and tragic pomp attended the decease of w retch¬ ed humanity. The funeral procession of mo- narchs of old, was transcended by our splendid
shews. Near the sources of the Arveiron we performed the rites for, four only excepted, the last of the species. Adrian and I, leaving Clara and Evelyn wrapt in peaceful imohserving slumber, carried the body to this desolate spot, and placed it in those caves of ice beneath the glacier, which rive and split with the slightest sound, and bring destruction on those within the clefts—no bird or beast of prey could here pro¬ fane the frozen form. So, with hushed steps and in silence, we placed the dead on a bier of ice, and then, departing, stood on the rocky platform beside the river springs. All hushed as w e had been, the very striking of the air with our persons had sufficed to disturb the repose of this thawless region ; and we had hardly left the cavern, before vast blocks of ice, detaching them¬ selves from the roof, fell, and covered the human image we had deposited within. We had chosen a fair moonlight night, but our journey thither had been long, and the crescent sank be¬ hind the western heights by the time we had ac-
complished our purpose. The snowy mountains and blue glaciers elione in their own light. The rugged and abrupt ravine, which formed one side of Mont Anvert, was opposite to us, the glacier at our side ; at our feet Arveiion, white and foaming, dashed over the pointed rocks that jutted into it, and, with whirrmg spray and ceaseless roar, disturbed the stdly night. Yellow lightnings plav ed around the vast dome of Mont Blanc, silent as the snow-clad rock they iiki- r mnated ; all was bare, wild, and sublime, while the singing of the pines in melodious mui- murmgs added a gentle interest to the ro.jgh magnificence. Now the riving and fall of itv rocks clave the air; now the thunder of the avalanche burst on our ears. In countries whose featuies are of less magnitude, nature be tra y s her hung powers in the foliage of the trees, m the growth of herbage, in the soft purling <f meandering streams, here, endowed with giant attributes the torrent, the thunder-storm, and the flo« of massive waters, display her activitv
Such the church-yard, such the requiem, such the eternal congregation, that waited on our companion's funeral ! Nor was it the human form alone ν hich we had placed in this eternal sepulchre, whose ob¬ sequies we now celebrated. With this last victim riague vanished from the earth. Death had never wanted weapons wherewith to destroy life, and we, few and weak as we had become, were still exposed to every other shaft with which his full quiver teemed. But pestilence was absent from among them. For »even years it had had fail sway upon, earth ; she had trod every nook of our spacious globe ; »he had mingled with the atmosphere, which a* a cloak enwraps all our fellow-creatures—the inhabitant « of native Europe—the luxurious Asiatic—the swarth} African and fiee American had 1к.чп vanqui&hed and destroyed by her.

our lives—the word plague no longer rung in our cars—the aspect of plague incarnate in the human countenance no Itmger appeared before our eyes. From this moment I saw plague no more. She abdicated her throne, and despoiled herself of her imperial sceptre among tbe ice rocks that surrounded us. She left solitude and «dence co-heirs of her kingdom. My present feelings are so mingled with the past, that I cannot say whether the knowledge of this change visited ш, as we stood on this sterile spot, It *eem$ to me that it did ; that a cloud seemed to pas» from over us, that a weight was taken from the air; that henceforth we breathed more freely, and raised our heads with ноше [x>r- tion of former liberty. Yet wc did not hope. We were impressed by the sentiment, ihat our race was run, but that plague wouid not be our destroyer, The coming time was as a might ν river, down which a charmed l*oat i«* driven, whose mortal steersman knows, that the obvious peril is not the one he needs fear, yet that danger is nigh ; and wbo floats awe-struck under beeť-
ling precipices, through the dark and turbid waters—seeing in the distance yet stranger and ruder shapes, towards which he is irresistibly impelled. Wbat would become of us? О for some Delphic oracle, or Pythian maid, to utter the secrets of futurity î О for some (Edipus to solve the riddle of the cruel Sphynx ! Such (Edipus was I to be—not divining a words juggle, but whose agonizing pangs, and sorrow- tainted life were to be the engines, wherewith to lay bare the secrets of destiny, and reveal the meaning of the enigma, whose explanation closed the history of tlie human race. Dim fancies, akin to these, haunted our minds», and iibtilled feelings not unallied to pleasure, as we stood beside this silent tomb of nature, reared by these lifeless mountains, above her living veiib, choking her vital principle. u Thus are we left," said Adrian, t( two melancholy blasted trees, where once a forest waved. We are left to moura, and pine, and die. Yet even now we have our duties, which we must string
ourselves to fulfil : the duty of bestowing plea¬ sure where we can, and by force of love, irradi¬ ating with rainbow hues the tempest of grief* Nor will I repine if in this extremity we preserve what we now possess. Something tells me, Ver¬ ney, that we need no longer dread our cruel enemy, and I cling with delight to the oracular voice. Though strange, it will be sweet to mark the growth of your little boy, and the develop¬ ment of Clara's young heart. In the midst of a desert world, we are everything to them ; and, if we live, it must be our task to make this new mode of life happy to them. At present this is easy, for their childish ideas do not wander into futurity, and the stinging craving for sympathy, and all of love of which our nature is susceptible, is not yet awake within them : we cannot guess what will happen then, when nature asserts her indefeasible and sacred powers ; but, long before that time, we may all be cold, as he who lies in yonder tomb of ice. We need only pro¬ vide for the present, and endeavour to fill with
pleasant images the inexperienced fancy of your lovely niece. The scenes which now surround us, vast and sublime as they are, are not such a» can best contribute to this work. Nature is here like our fortunes, grand, but too destructive, bare, and rude, to be able to afford delight to her young imagination. Let us descend to the sunny plains of Italy. Winter will soon be here, to clothe this wilderness in double deso¬ lation ; but we will cross the bleak hill-tops, and lead her to scenes of fertility and beauty, where her path will be adorned with flowers, and the cheery atmosphere inspire pleasure and hope. 1 ' In pursuance of this plan we quitted Cha¬ mounix on the following day. We had no cause to hasten our steps ; no event w r as trans¬ acted beyond our actual sphere to enchain our resolves, so we yielded to every idle whim, and deemed our time well spent, when we could be¬ hold the passage of the hours without dismay. We loitered along the lovely Vale of Servox ; passed long hours on the bridge, which, crossing
the ravine of Arve, commands a prospect of its pine-clothed depths, and the snowy mountains that wall it in. We rambled through romantic Switzerland; till, fear of coming winter leading us forward, the first days of October found us in the valley of La Maurienne, which leads to Cenis. I cannot explain the reluctance we felt at leaving this land of mountains ; perhaps it was, that we regarded the Alps as boundaries between our former and our future state of existence, and so clung fondly to what of old we had loved. Perhaps, because we had now so few impulses urging to a choice between two modes of action, we were pleased to preserve the existence of one, and preferred the prospect of what we were to do, to the recollection of what had been done. We felt that for this year dagger w r as past ; and wc believed that, for some months, we were secured to each other. There was a thrilling, agonizing delight in the thought-—it filled the eyes with misty tears, it tore the heart with tumultuous hea vings ; frailer than the " snow
fall in the river," were we each and all—but we strove to give life and individuality to the mete¬ oric course of our several existences, and to feel that no moment escaped us unenjoyed. Thus tot¬ tering on the dizzy brink, we were happy. Yes ! as we sat beneath the toppling rocks, beside the waterfalls, near ----- Forests, ancient as the hills, Ana folding sunny spots of greenery, where the chamois grazed, and the timid squir¬ rel laid up its hoard—descanting on the charms of nature, drinking in the while her unalienable beauties—we were, in an empty world, happy. Yet, О days of joy—days, when eye spoke to eye, and voices, sweeter than the music of the swinging branches of the pines, or rivulet's gen¬ tle murmur, answered mine—yet, О days replete with beatitude, days of loved society—days un¬ utterably dear to me forlorn—pass, О pass be¬ fore mc, making me in your memory forget what I am. Behold, how my streaming eyes blot this senseless paper—behold; how my fea-
tures are convulsed by agonizing throes, at your mere recollection, now that, alone, my tears flow, my lips quiver, my cries fill the air, unseen, un¬ marked, unheard I Yet, O yet, days of delight ! let me dwell on your long-drawn hours ! As the cold increased upon us, we passed the Alps, and descended into Italy. At the uprising of morn, we sat at our repast, and cheated our regrets by gay sallies or learned disquisitions. The live-long day we sauntered on, still keeping in view the end of our jour¬ ney, but careless of the hour of its comple¬ tion. As the evening star shone out, and the orange sunset, far in the west, marked the posi¬ tion of the dear land we had for ever left, talk, thought enchaining, made the hours fly— О that we had lived thus for ever and for ever í Of what consequence was it to our four hearts, that they alone were the fountains of life in the wide world? As far as mere individual sentiment was concerned, we had rather be left thus united together, than if, each alone in a populous desert
of unknown men, wc had wandered truly com- panionless till hfe's last term. In tliis manner, we endeavoured to console each other ; in this manner, true philosophy taught us to reason. It was the delight of Adrian and myself to wait on Clara, naming her the little queen of the world, ourselves her humblest servitors. When we arrived at a town, our first care was to select for her its most choice abode ; to make sure that no harrowing relic remained of its former inha¬ bitants ; to seek food for her, and minister to her wants with assiduous tenderness. Clara entered into our scheme with childish gaiety. Her chief business w r as to attend on Evelyn ; but it was her sport to array herself in splendid robes, adorn herself with sunny gems, and ape a princely state. Her religion, deep and pure, did not leach her to refuse to blunt thus the keen sting of regret ; her youthful vivacity made her enter, heart and soul, into these strange masque¬ rades. We had resolved to pass the ensuing winter
at Milan, which, as being a large and luxurious city, would afford us choice of homes. We had descended the Alps, and left far behind their vast forests and mighty crags. We entered smiling Italy. Mingled grass and corn grew in her plains, the unprvmed vines threw their luxu¬ riant branches around the elms. The grapes, overripe, had fallen on the ground, or hung pur¬ ple, or burnished green, among the red and yellow- leaves. The ears of standing corn winnowed to emptiness by the spendthrift winds ; the fallen foliage of the trees, the weed-grown brooks, the dusky olive, now spotted with its blackened fruit ; the chesnuts, to which the squirrel only was harvest-man ; all plenty, and yet, alas ! all poverty, painted in wondrous hues and [fantastic groupings this land of beauty. In the towns, in the voiceless towns, we visited the churches, adorned by pictures, master-pieces of art, or galleries of statues—while in this genial clime the animals, in new found liberty, rambled through the gorgeous palaces, and hardly feared
our forgotten aspect. The dove-coloured oxen turned their full eyes on us, and paced slowly by ; a startling throng of silly sheep, with patter¬ ing feet, would start up in some chamber, for¬ merly dedicated to the repose of beauty, and rush, huddling past us, down the marble stair¬ case into the street, and again in at the first open door, taking unrebuked possession of hallowed sanctuary, or kingly couneil-chambe*·. AVe no longer started at these occurrences, nor at worse exhibition of change?—when the palace had be¬ come a mere tomb, pregnant with fetid stench, strewn with the dead ; and we could perceive how pestilence and fear had played strange antics. chasiiiff the luxurious dame to the dank fields and bare cottage ; gathering, among carpets of Indian woof, and beds of silk, the rough peasant, or the deformed half-human shape of the wretched beggar. We arrived at Milan, and stationed ourselves m the Vice-Hoy's palace. Here wc made laws for Ourselves, dividing our day, and living dia-
tinct occupations for each hour. In the morning we rode in the adjoining country, or wandered through the palaces, in search of pictures or an¬ tiquities. In the evening we assembled to read or to converse. There were few books that we dared read ; few, that did not cruelly deface the painting we bestowed on our solitude, by re¬ calling combinations and emotions never more to be experienced by us. Metaphysical disquisi¬ tion ; fiction, which wandering from all reality, lost itself in self-created errors ; poets of times so far gone by, that to read of them was [as to re$d of Atlantis and Utopia ; or such as referred to nature only, and the workings of one par tic u - iar mind ; but most of all, talk, varied and ever new, beguiled our hours. While we paused thus in our onward career towards death, time held on its accustomed course. Still and for ever did the carl h roll on, enthroned in her atmospheric car, speeded by the force of the invisible coursers of never- erring necessity. And now, this dew-drop in
the sky, this ball, ponderous with mountains, lucent with waves, passing from the short ty¬ ranny of watery Pisces and the frigid Ram, en¬ tered the radiant demesne of Taurus and the Twins. There, fanned by vernal airs, the Spirit of Beauty sprung from her cold repose; and, with winnowing wings and soft pacing feet, set a girdle of verdure around the earth, sporting among the violets, hiding within the springing foliage of the trees, tripping lightly down the radiant streams into the sunny deep. " For Ιο í winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines, with the tender grape, give a good smell.'"* Thus was it in the time of the ancient regal poet ; thus was it now. Yet how could we miseiable bad the ap-
vol. in.
к
proach of this delightful season ? We hoped indeed that death did not now as hereto¬ fore walk in its shadow; yet, left as we were alone to each other, we looked in each other's faces with enquiring eyes, not daring altogether to trust to our presentiments, and endeavouring to divine which would be the hapless survivor to the other three. We were to pass the summer at the lake of Como, and thither we removed as soon as spring grew to her maturity, and the snow disappeared from the hill tops. Ten miles from Como, under the steep heights of the eastern mountains, by the margin of the lake, was a villa called the Pliniana, from its being built on the site of a fountain, whose periodical ebb ard flow is de¬ scribed by the younger Pliny in his letters. The house had nearly fallen into ruin, till in the year £090, an English nobleman had bought it, and fitted it up with every luxury. Two large halls, hung with splendid tapestry, and paved with marble, opened on each side of a
court, of whose two other sides one overlooked the deep dark lake, and the other was bounded by a mountain, from whose stony side gushed, with roar and splash, the celebrated fountain. Above, underwood of myrtle and tufts of odor¬ ous plants crowned the rock, while the star- pointing giant cypresses reared themselves in the blue air, and the recesses of the hills were adorned with the luxuriant growth of chesnut- trees. Here we fixed our summer residence. We had a lovely skiff, in which we sailed, now stemming the midmost waves, now coasting the over-hanging and craggy banks, thick sown with evergreens, which dipped their shining leaves in the waters, and were mirrored in many a little bay and creek of waters of translucent darkness. Here orange plants bloomed, here birds poured forth melodious hymns; and here, during spring, the cold snake emerged from the clefts, and basked on the sunny terraces of rock. Were we not happy in this paradisaical retreat ? If some kind spirit had whispered n 2
forgetfulness to us, methinks w r e should have been happy here, where the precipitous moun¬ tains, nearly pathless, shut from our view the far fields of desolate earth, and with small exer¬ tion of the imagination, we might fancy that the cities were still resonant with popular hum, and the peasant still guided his plough through the furrow, and that we, the world's free denizens, enjoyed a voluntary exile, and not a remediless cutting off from our extinct species. Not one among us enjoyed the beauty of this scenery so much as Clara. Jiefore we quitted Milan, a change had taken place in her habits and manners- She lost her gaiety, she laid aside her sports, and assumed an almost vestal plainness of attire. She shunned us, retiring with Evelyn to some distant chamber or silent nook ; nor did she enter into his pastimes with lhe same zest as she was wont, but would sit and watch him with sadly tender smiles, and e}cs bright with tears, yet without a word of complaint. She approached us timidly, avoided
our caresses, nor shook off her embarrassment till some serious discussion or lofty theme called her for awhile out of herself. Her beauty grew as a rose, which, opening to the summer wind, discloses leaf after leaf till the sense aches with its excess of loveliness. A slight and variable colour tinged her cheeks, and her motions seemed attuned by some hidden harmony of surpassing sweetness. We redoubled our tenderness and earnest attentions. She received them with grateful smiles, that fled swift as sunny beam from a glittering wave on an xVpril day. Our only acknowledged point of sympathy with her, appeared to be E vei} n. This dear little fellow was a comforter and deli»ht to из О beyond all words. His buoyant spirit, and his innocent ignorance of our vast calamity, were balm to us, whose thoughts and feelings were over-wrought and spun out in the immensity of speculative sorrow. To cherish, to caress, to amuse him was the common task of all. Clara, who felt towards him in some degree like a young
mother, gratefully acknowledged our kindness towards him. To me, О ! to me, who saw the clear brows and soft eyes of the beloved of my heart, my lost and ever dear Idris, re-born in hi& gentle face, to me he was dear even to pain ; if I pressed him to my heart, methought I clasped a real and living part of her, who had lain theie through long years of youthful happiness. It was the custom of Adrian and myself to go out each day in our skiff to forage in the adjacent country. In these expeditions we were seldom accompanied by Clara or her little charge, but our return was an hour of hilarity. Evelyn ransacked our stores with childish eager¬ ness, and we always brought some new found gift for our fair companion. Then too we made discoveries of lovely scenes or gay palaces, whither in the evening we all proceeded. Our sailing expeditions were most divine, and with a fair wind or transverse course we cut the liquid waves ; and, if talk failed under the pressure of thought, I had my clarionet with nie, whicb
awoke the echoes, and gave the change to our careful minds. Clara at such times often re¬ turned to her former habits of free converse and gay sally ; and though our four hearts alone beat in the world, those four hearts were happy. One day, on our return from the town of Como, with a laden boat, we expected as usual to be met at the port by Clara and Evelyn, and we were somewhat surprised to see the beach vacant, I, as my nature prompted, would not prognosticate evil, but explained it away as a mere casual incident. Not so Adrian. lie was seized with sudden trembling and apprehen¬ sion, and he called to me with vehemence to steer quickly for land, and, when near, leapt from the boat, half falling into the water ; and, scrambling up the steep bank, hastenod along the narrow strip of garden, the only level space between the lake and the mountain. I followed without delay ; the garden and inner court were empty, so was the house, whose every room we
visited. Adrian called loudly upon Claras name, and was about to rush up the near moun¬ tain-path, when the door of a summer-house at the end of tlie garden slowly opened, and Clara appeared, not advancing towards us, but leaning against a column of the building with blanched cheeks, in a posture of utter despondency. Adrian sprang towards her with a cry of joy, and folded her delightedly in his arms. She withdrew from his embrace, and, without a w r ord, again entered the summer-house. Her quivering lips, her despairing heart refused to afford her voice to express our misfortune. Poor little Evelyn had, wdiile playing with her, been seized with sudden fever, and now lay torpid and speechless on a little couch in the summer-house. For a whole fortnight we unceasingly watched beside the poor child, as his life de¬ clined under the ravages of a virulent îvphus. His little form and tiny lineaments encaged the embryo of the world-spanning mind of man.
Man's nature, brimful of passions and affecdoib, would have had an home in that little heart, whose swift pulsations hurried towards their close. His small hand's fine mechanism, now flaccid and unbent, would in the growth of sinew and muscle, have achieved works of beauty or of strength. His tender rosy feet would have trorl in firm manhood the bowers and glades of earth —these reflections were now of little use : he lay, thought and strength suspended, waiting unresisting the final blow. We watched at his bedside, and when the ac¬ cess of fever was on him, we neither spoke nor looked at each other, marking only his ob¬ structed breath and the mortal glow that tinged his sunken cheek, the heavy death that weighed on his eyelids. It is a trite evasion to say, that words could not express our long drawn agony ; yet how can words image sensations whose tormenting keenness throw us back, as it were, on the deep roots and hidden foundatioi.s of our nature, which shake our being with earth- N S
quake-throe, so that we leave to confide in ac¬ customed feedings which like mother-earth sup¬ port us, and cling to some vain imagination or deceitful hope, w hich will soon be buried in the ruins occasioned by the final shock. I have called that period a fortnight, which we passed watching the changes of the sweet child's malady —and such it might have been—at night, we won¬ dered to find another day gone, while each particular hour seemed endless. Day and night were exchanged for one another uncounted ; we slept hardly at all, nor did we even quit his room, except when a pang of grief seized us, and wc retired from each other for a short period to conceal our sobs and tears. We en¬ deavoured in vain to abstract Clara from this deplorable scene. She sat, hour after hour, ooking at him, now softly arranging his pillow, and, while he had power to swallow, adminis¬ tered his drink. At length the moment of his death came : the blood paused in its flow—his eyes opened, and then closed again: without
convulsion or sigh, the frail tenement was left vacant of its spiritual inhabitant. I have heard that the sight of the dead has confirmed materialists in their belief. I ever felt otherwise. Was that my child—that moveless decaying inanimation ? My child was en¬ raptured by my caresses; his dear voice cloath- ed with meaning articulations his thoughts, otherwise inaccessible ; his smile was a ray of the soul, and the same soul sat upon its throne in his eyes. I turn from this mockery of what he was. Take, О earth, thy debt ! freely and for ever I consign to thee the garb thou didst afford. But thou, sweet child, amiable and beloved boy, either thy spirit has sought a fitter dwelling, or, shrined in my heart, thou liv est while it lives. We placed his remains under a cypress, the upright mountain being scooped out to receive them. And then Clara said, ** If you wish me to live, take me from hence. There is some¬ thing in this scene of transcendent beauty, in
y. these trees, and hills and waves, that for ever whisper to mc, leave thy cumbrous flesh, and make a part of us. I earnestly entreat you to take me away." So on the fifteenth of August we bade adieu to our villa, and the embowering shades of thi· abode of beauty ; to calm bay and noisy water¬ fall; to Evelyn's little grave we bade farewell ! and then, with heavy hearts, we departed on our pilgrimage towards Rome
CHAPTER IX. Now-—soft awhile—have I arrived so near the end ? Yes ! it is all over now—a step or two over those new made graves, and the weari¬ some way is done. Can I accomplish my task ? Can I streak my paper with words capacious of the grand conclusion ? Arise, black Melan¬ choly ί ciuit thy Cimmerian solitude ί Ering with thee murky fogs from hell, which may drink up the day ; bring blight and pes¬ tiferous exhalations, which, entering the hollow caverns and breathing places of earth, may fill her stony veins with corruption, so that not only herbage may no longer flourish, the trees may rot, and tlľi rivers run with gall—but the ever-
lasting mountains be decomposed, and the mighty deej) putrify, and the genial atmosphere which clips the globe, lose all powers of gene- ration and sustenance. Do this, sad visaged power, while I write, while eyes read these pages. And who will read them ? Beware, tender offspring of the re-born world—beware, fair being, with human heart, yet untamed by care, and human brow, yet unploughed by time—be¬ ware, lest the cheerful current of thy blood be checked, thy golden locks turn grey, thy sweet dimpling smiles be changed to fixed, har*h wrinkles í Let not day look on these lines, lest garish day waste, turn pale, and die. Seek a cypress grove, whose moaning boughs will be harmony befitting ; seek some cave, deep em¬ bowered in earth's dark entrails, w here no light will penetrate, save that which struggles, red and dickering, through a single fissure, staining thy page with grimmest livery of death. There is a painful confusion in my brain,
w hich refuses to delineate distinctly succeeding events. Sometimes the irradiation of my friend's gentle smile comes before me ; and methinks ts light spans and fills eternity—then, again, I feel the gasping throes— We quitted Como, and in compliance with Adrian's earnest desire, we took Venice in our way to Rome. There w r as something to the Knglish peculiarly attractive in the idea of this wave-encircled, island enthroned city. Adrian had never seen it. We went down the Po and the Brenta in a boat ; and, the days proving intolerably hot, we rested in the bordering palaces during the day, travelling through the night, when darkness made the bordering banks indistinct, and our solitude less remark¬ able ; when the wandering moon lit the waves that divided before our prow, and the night- wind filled our hails, and the murmuring stream, waving trees, and swelling canvass, ac¬ corded in harmonious strain. Clara, long over¬ come by excessive grief, had to a great degree
cast aside her timid, cold reserve, and received our attentions with grateful tenderness. While Adrian with poetic fervour discoursed of the glorious nations of the dead, of the beauteous earth and the fate of man, she crept near him, drinking in Ins speech with silent pleasure. We banished from our talk, and as much as possible from our thoughts, the knowledge of our de¬ solation And it would be incredible to an in¬ habitant of cities, to one among a busy throng, to what extent we succeeded. It was as a man confined in a dungeon, whose small and grated rift at first renders the doubtful light more sen¬ sibly obscure, till, the visual orb having drunk in the beam, and adapted itself to its scantiness, he finds that clear noon inhabits his cell. So we, a simple triad on empty earth, were multi¬ plied to each other, till we became all in all. We stood like trees, whose roots are loosened by the wind, which support one another, waning and clinging with encreased fervour while the wintry storms howl.
Thus we floated down the widening stream of the Po, sleeping when the cicale sang, awake with the stars. Wc entered the narrower banks of the Brenta, and armed at the shore of the Laguna at sunrise on the sixth of September. The bright orb slowly rose from behind its cupolas and towers, and .shed it- jk*nctrating light upon the gla.vsy water-.. W reck > of gon¬ dolas, and some few uninjured one>. were strewed on the beach at Ричоа. We em bai ked in one of these for the widowed daughter of ocean, who, abandoned and fallen, *-at forlorn on her propping ь!с», км Λ mg toward- tiu* fai moun¬ tains of Grevce. We rowed Inditiv out the Laguna, and entered ('anale Grandt*. The tide ebbed Milleidy from out the Ыч»ксп portal and violated hall- of \ cince- sea weed and sea mon¬ sters were left on the blackened marble, while the salt ooze defaced the matchless work*, of art that adorned their walls, and the sea gull flew out from the sbattei ed window. In the midst of this appalling ruin of the monuments of
man's power, nature asserted her ascendancy, and shone more beauteous from the ccmtrast. The radiant waters hardly trembled, while the rippling waves made many sided mirror* to the sun; the blue itmwiKtty. seen bev»nd Lido, 4treirhvd far, unvpecked by Inkit, ло trancpiil, síj lovely, that it Hcmed to m ν ite u^ to quit the land strewn with rums, and to **ek refuge from sorrow and fear on its placid extent. We saw the ruins of this hapless city from the height of the tower of San Marco, immedi¬ ate' ν under u% and turned with sickening heart«? to the ч*а, which, though, u Ы 1 a grave, rears no mon 1 1 ment, discloses no ruin. Evening bacì come apace. The sun set in calm majesty be¬ hind the mbty summits of the Apennines and its golden and roseate hue> painted the moun¬ tains of the opposte shore. "That land,"' said Adrian, u unged with the last glories of the da\, i»! Greece.'" Greece! The sound had a responsive chord in the ÍK¡«om of Clara. She vehemently reminded us that vie had promised
to take her once again to Greece, to the tomb of he*r parents. Whv go to Rom? ? what should we do at Rome ? We might take one of the main vessels to he found here, embark in it, and '»teer right for Albania. I objected the dangers of ocean, and the dis¬ tance of the mountains we »aw, from Athens; a tlistance which, from the savage unculdvation of the country, was almost impassable. Adrian, who was delighted with Clara's proposal,obviated these objections. The season was favourable; the north-west that blew would take us trans¬ versely across the gulph ; and then we might find, in some abandoned port, a light Greek caique,adapted for such navigation, and rundown the coast of the Morea, anel, passing over the Isthmus of Corinth, without much land-travelling or fatigue, find ourselves at Athens. This ap¬ peared to me wild talk ; but the <*еа, glowing with a thousand purple hues, looked so brilliant and safe ; my beloved companions were so earnest, so determined, that, when Adrian said, " Well,
though it is not exactly what you wish, yet con¬ sent, to please me"—I could no longer refuse. That evening we selected a ve?sel, whose size just seemed fitted for our enterprize ; we bent the sails and put the rigging in order, and re¬ posing that night in one of the city's thousand palaces, agreed to embark at sunrise the follow¬ ing morning. When winds that move not its calm surface, sweep The azure sea, I love the land no more ; The smites of the serene and tranquil deep Tempt my unquiet mind— Thus said Adı ian, quoting a translation of Mosehus's poem, as in the clear morning light, we rowed over the Laguna, past Lido, into the open sea—·I would have added in continuation, But, when the roar Of ocean's gray abyss resounds, and foam Gathers upon the sea, and vast waves burst— But my friends declared that such verses were evil augury; so in cheerful mood we left the shallow waters,and, when out at sea, unfurled our
sails to catch the favourable breeze. The laugh- ingmorning air filled them, while sun-light bathed earth, sky and ocean—the placid waves divided to receive our keel, and playfully kissed the dark sides of our little skiff, murmuring a welcome ; as land receded, still the blue expanse, most waveless, twin sister to the azure empyrean, afforded smooth conduct to our bark. As the air and waters were tranquil and balmy, so were our minds steeped in quiet. In comparison with the unstained deep, funereal earth appeared a grave, its high rocks and stately mountains were but monuments, its trees the plumes of a herse, the brooks and rivers brackish with tears for departed man. Farcw r ell to desolate towns —to fields with their savage intermixture of corn and weeds—to ever multiplying relics of our lost species. Ocean, we commit ourselves to thee-— even as the patriarch of old floated above the drowned world, let us be saved, as thus we he- take ourselves to thy perennial flood. Adrian sat at the helm ; I attended to the
rigging, the breeze right aft filled our swelling canvas, and we ran before it over the untroubled deep. The wind died away at noon ; its idle breath just permitted us to hold our course. As lazy, fair-weather sailors, careless of the coming hour, we talked gaily of our coasting voyage, of our arrival at Athens. We would make our home of one of the Cyclades, and there in myrtle- groves, amidst perpetual spring, fanned by the wholesome sea-breezes—we would live long years in beatific union—Was there such a thing as death in the world ?— The sun passed its '»nitb, and lingered down the stainless floor of heaven. Lying in the boat, my face turned up to the sky, I thought I saw on its blue white, marbled streaks, so slight, so immaterial, that now I said—They are there— and now, It is a mere imagination. A sudden fear stung me while I gazed ; and, starting up, and running to the prow,—as I stood, my hair was gently lifted on my brow—a dark line of ripples appeared to the east, gaining rapidly on us
—my breathless remark to Adrian, was followed by the flapping of the canvas, as the adverse wind struck it, anel our boat lurched—swift as speech, the web of the storm thickened over head, the sun went down red, the dark sea was strewed with foam, and our skiff rose and fell in its en¬ creasing furrows. Behold us now in our frail tenement, hem¬ med in by hungry, roaring waves, buffeted by winds. In the inky east two vast clouds, sailing contrary ways, met ; the lightning leapt forth, and the hoarse thunder muttered. Again in the south, the clouds replied, and the forked stream of fire running along the black sky, shewed us the appalling piles of clouds, now- met and obliterated by the heaving waves. Great God ! And we alone—we three— alone— alone—sole dwellers on the sea and on the earth, w r e three must perish í The vast universe, its myriad worlds, and the plains of boundless earth which we had left—the extent of shoreless sea around—contracted to my view—they and
all that they contained, shrunk up to one point, even to our tossing bark, freighted with glorious humanity. A convulsion of despair crossed the love- lieaming face of Adrian, while with set teeth he murmured, " Yet they shall Ьэ saved !" Clara, visited by an human pang, pale and trembling, crept near him—he looked on her with an en¬ couraging smile—" Do you fear, sweet girl ? O, do not fear, we shall soon be on shore !"' The darkness prevented me from seeing the changes of her countenance ; but her voice was clear and sweet, as she replied, st Why should I fear ? neither sea nor storm can harm us, if mighty destiny or the ruler of destiny does not permit. And then the stinging fear of surviving either of you, is not here—one death will clasp us undivided." Meanwhile we took İn all our sails, save a gib; and, as soon as we might without danger, changed our course, running w r ith the wind for the Italian shore. Dark night mixed every-
thing ; we hardly discerned the white crests of the murderous surges, except when lightning made brief noon, and drank the darkness, shew¬ ing us our danger, and restoring us to double night. We were all silent, except when Adrian, as steersman, made an encouraging observation. Our little shell obeyed the rudder miraculously well, and ran along on the top of the waves, as if she had been an offspring of the sea, and the angry mother sheltered her endangereel chikk I sat at the prow, watching our course ; vv hen suddenly I heard the waters break with re¬ doubled fury. We were certainly near the shore—at the same time I cried, íť About there !" and a broael lightning filling the сопсал e. shewed us for one moment the level beach a-hcad, dis¬ closing even the sands, and stunted, ooze- sprinkled beds of reeds, that grew at high water mark. Again it was dark, and we drew in our breath with such content аь one may, who, while fragments of volcano-hurled rock elarken the air, sees a vast mass ploughing the vol, in. о
ground immediately at his feet. What to do we knew not—the breakers here, there, every¬ where, encompassed us—they roared, and dashed, and flung their hated spray in our faces. With considerable difficulty and danger wc succeeded at length in altering our course, and stretched out from shore. I urged my compa¬ nions to prepare for the wreck of 4>ur little skiff, and to bind themselves to some oar or spar which might suffice to float them. I was myself an ex¬ cellent swimmer—the very sight of the hca was wont to raise in me such sensations, as a hunts¬ man experiences, when he hears a pack of hounds in full cry ; I loved to feel the waves w rap me and strive to overpower ше ; while I, lord of my¬ self, moved this w ay or that, in spile of their angry bufletings. Adrian also could swim— but the weakness of his frame prevented him from feeling pleasure; in the exercise, or acquir¬ ing rny great expertuess. lint what power could tlie strongest swimmeroppo.se to the over¬ powering violence of ocean in its fur) ? My ef-
forts to prepare my companions were rendered «early futile—for the roaring breakers prevented our hearing one another speak, and the waves, that broke continually over our boat, obliged me to exert all my strength in lading the water out, as fastas it came in The -\v bile darkness, palpable and rav less, hemmed us round, dissi- pated only bv the lightning; sometimes we be¬ held thunderbolts, fieiv red, fall into the sea, and at intervals л ast spouts stooped from the cloud«, churning the wild ocean, which rose to meet them ; w hile the fierce gale bore the rack onwards, and they were lost in the chaotic mingling of sky and sea. Our gunwales had been torn away, our single sail had heen lent to ribbands, and home down the stream of the wind. We had cut away our mast, and lightened the boat of all idle contained—Clara attempted to assist me in heaving the water from the hohl, and, as sdie turned her eyes to look on the lightning, 1 could discern by that momentary gleam, that resignation had con- υ 2
quered every fear. AVe have a power given us in any worst extremity, which props the else feeble mind of man, and enables us to endure the most savage tortures with a stillness of soul which in hours of happiness we could not have imagined. A calm, more dreadful in truth than the tempest, allayed the wild beatings of my heart —a calm like that of the gamester, the suicide, and the murderer, when the last die is on the point of being cast—while the poisoned cup is at the lips,—as the death-blow is about to br given. Hours passed thus—hours which might write old age on the face of beardless youth, and grizzle the silky hair of infancy— hours, whih the chaotic uproar continued, while each dread gust transcended in fury the one before, and our skiff hung on the breaking wave, and then rushed into the valley below, and trembled and spun between the watery precipices that seemed most to meet above her. For a moment the gale paused, and ocean sank to comparative
silence—it was a breathless interval; the wind which, as a practised leaper, had gathered itself up before it sprung, now with terrific roar rushed over the sea, and the waves struck our stern. Adrian exclaimed that the rudder was gone ;— cc We are lost," cried CJara, i( Save yourselves— О save yourselves Г The lightning shewed me the poor girl half buried in the water at the bottom of the boat ; as she was sinking in it Adrian caught her up, and sustained her in his arms. We were without a rudder—we rushed prow foremost into the vast billows piled up а -head— they broke over and filled the tiny skiff; one scream I heard—one cry that we were gone, I uttered; I found myself in the waters; dark¬ ness was around. When the light of the tern* pest flashed, I saw the keel of our upset boat close to me—I clung to this, grasping it with clenched hand and nails, while I endeavoured tluring each flash to discover any appearance of my companions. 1 thought I saw Adrian at no great distance from me, clinging to an oar ;
I sprung from my hold, and with energy bey oml my human strength, I dashed aside the waters as I strove to lay hold of him. As that hope failed, instinctive love of life animated me, and feelings of contention, as if a hostile will com¬ bated with mine. I breasted tbe surges, and flung them from me, as I would the opposing front and sharpened claws of a lion about to enfang my bosom. When I had been beaten down by one wave. I rose on another, while I felt bitter pride curl my lip. Ever since the storm had carried us near the shore, we had never attained any great distance from it. With every flash I saw the bordering coast; yet the progress I made was smalt, whiki each wave, as it receded, carried me back into ocean's far abysses. At one moment l felt my foot touch the sand, and then again I was in dec]) water; my arms began to lose their power of motion ; my breath failed me under the influence of the strangling waters—a thou¬ sand wild and delirious thoughts crossed mc·;
as well as I can now recall them, my chief feel¬ ing was, how sweet it would be to lay my head on the quiet earth, where the surges would no longer strike my weakened frame s nor the sound of waters ring in my ears—to attain this repose, not to save my life, I made a last effort—the shelving shore suddenly presented a footing for me. I rose, and was again thrown down by the breakers—a point of rock to which I was en¬ abled to cling, gave me a moment's respite ; and then, taking advantage of the ebbing of the waves, I ran forwards—gained the dry sands, and fell senseless on the oozy reeds that sprinkled them. I must have lain long deprived of life ; for when first, with a sickening feeling, I unclosed my eyes, the light of morning met them. Great change had taken place meanwhile : grey dawn dappled the flying clouds, which sped onwards, leaving visible at intervals vast lakes of pure ether. A fountain of light arose in an encreasing stream from the east, behind the
waves of the Adriatic, changing the grey to a roseate hue, and then flooding sky and sea with aerial gold. A kind of stupor followed my fainting ; my senses were alive, but memory was extinct. The blessed respite was short—a snake lurked near me to sting me into life—on the first retrospec¬ tive emotion I would have started up, but my limbs refused to obey me ; my knees trembled, the muscles had lost all power. I still believed that I might find one of my beloved companions cast like me, half alive, on the beach ; and I strove in every way to restore my frame to the use of its animal functions. I wrung the brine from my hair ; and the rays of the risen sun soon visited me with genial warmth. With the restoration of my bodily powers, my mind be¬ came in some degree aware of the universe of misery, henceforth to be its dwelling. I ran to the water's edge, calling on the beloved names. Ocean drank in, and absorbed my feeble voice, replying with pitiless roar. I climbed a
near tree ; the level sands bounded by a pine forest, and the sea clipped round by the horizon, was all that I could discern. In vain I ex¬ tended my researches along the beach ; the mast we had thrown overboard, with tangled cordage, and remnants of a sail, was the sole relic land received of our wreck. Sometimes I stood still, and wrung my hands. I accused earth and sky—the universal machine and the Al¬ mighty power that misdirected it. Again I threw myself on the sands, and then the sigh¬ ing wind, mimicking a human cry, roused me to bitter, fallacious hope. Assuredly if any little bark or smallest canoe had been near, I should have sought the savage plains of ocean, found the dear remains of my lost ones, and clinging round them, have shared their grave. The day passed thus ; each moment contained eternity; although when hour after hour had gone by, I wondered at the quick flight of time. Yet even now I had not drunk the bitter potion to the dregs ; I was not yet persuaded of my о 3
loss ; I did not yet feel in every pulsation, in every nerve, in every thought, that I remained alone of my race,—that I was the last man. The day had clouded over, and a drizzling rain set in at sunset. Even the eternal skies weep, I thought ; is there any ¡shame then, that mortal man should spend himself in tears ? í remembered the ancient fables, in which human beings are described as dissolving away through weeping into ever-gushing fountains. Ah ! that so it were ; and then my destiny would be in some sort akin to the watery death of Adrian and Clara. Oh ! grief is fantastic; it weaves a web on which to trace the history of its woe from every form and change around ; it incorporates itself with all living nature ; it finds sustenance in every object ; as liiţht, it fills all things, and, like light, it givo its own colours to all. I hail wandered in my search to some dis¬ tance from the spot on which I had been cast, and came to one of those watch-towers, which at stated distances line the Italian shore. I was
glad of shelter, glad to find a work of human hands, after I had gazed so long on nature's drear barrenness ; so 1 entered, and ascended the rough winding staircase into the guard-room So far was fate kind, that no harrowing vestige remained of its former inhabitants ; a few planks laid across two iron tressels, and strewed with the dried leaves of Indian corn, was the bed j »resen t ed to me ; and an open chest, containing some half mouldered biscuit, awakened an ap¬ petite 1 , which perhaps existed before, but of which, until now, 1 was not aware. Thirst also, violent ami parching, tlie result of the sea- water I had drank, and of the exhaustion of my frame, tormented ine. Kind nature had gifted the supply of these wants with pleasurable SL'ibations, *o that I—even I !—vv as refreshed and calmed, as I ate of this sorry fare, and drank a little of the sour wine which half tilled a flask left in this abandoned dwelling. Then I stretched myself on the bed, not to be disdained by rhe vig¬ tim of shipwi eck. The earthy smell of the dried
leaves was balm to my sense after the hateful odour of sea-weed. I forgot my state of loneliness. I neither looked backward nor forward ; my senses were hushed to repose ; I fell asleep and dreamed of ail dear inland scenes, of hay-makers, of the shepherd's whistle to his dog, when he demanded his help to drive the flock to fold ; of sights and sounds peculiar to my boyhood's mountain life, which I had long forgotten. I awoke in a painful agony—for I fancied that ocean, breaking its bounds, carried away the fixed continent and deep rooted mountains, together with the streams I loved, the woods, and the flocks—it raged around, with that con¬ tinued and dreadful roar which had accom¬ panied the last wreck of surviving humanity« As my waking sense returned, the bare walls of the guard room closed round me, and the rain pattered against the single window. How dreadful it is, to emerge from the oblivion of slumber, and to receive as a good morrow the mute wailing of one's own hapless heart—to
return from the land of deceptive dreams, to the heavy knowledge of unchanged disaster !·— Thus was it with me, now, and for ever I The sting of other griefs might be blunted by time ; and evren mine yielded sometimes during the day, to the pleasure inspired by the imagination or the senses ; but I never look first upon the morning-light but with my fingers pressed tight on my bursting heart, and my soul deluged with the interminable flood of hopeless misery. Now I awoke for the first time in the dead world—I awoke alone—and the dull dirge of the sea, heard even amidst the rain, recalled me to the reflection of the wretch I had become, The sound came like a reproach, a scoff—like the sting of remorse in the soul—I gasped«—the veins and muscles of my throat swelled, suffo¬ cating me. I put my fingers to my ears, I buried my head in the leaves of my couch, I would have dived to the centre to lose hearing of that hideous moan. Hut another task must be mine—again ï
visited the detested beach—again 1 vainly looked far and wide—again I raised my unanswered cry, ifting up the only voice that could ever again force ihe mute air to sylla hie the human thought. What a pitiable, forlorn, disconsolate being I was ! My very aspect and garb told the tale of my despair. My hair was matted and wild — my limbs soiled with salt ooze ; while at sea, I had thrown off those of my garments that encumbered me, and the rain drenched the thin summer-cloihinír. I had retained—mv feet were bare, and the hi unteci reeds and broken shells made them bleed—the while, 1 hurried to and fro, now looking earnestly on some distant rock which, islanded in the ->ands, bore for a moment a deceptive appearance- now vrith flashing eye-. reproaching the murderous ocean for its unut¬ terable cruelty. Fora moment I compared myself to tliat mo¬ narch of the waste—Robinson Crusoe. We had been both thrown coin pan ion less—he on the shore of a desolate bland : í on that of a desolate
v\ odd. I v/as rich in the so called goods of life. If I turned my steps from the near barren scene, and entered any of the earth's million cities, I should find their wealth stored up for my accommodation—clothes, food, books, and a choice of dwelling beyond the command of the princes of former times—every climate was subject to m\ selection, while he was obliged to toil in the acquirement of every necessary, and was the inhabitant of a tropical island, against w hose heats and storms he could obtain small shelter.— \ iew ing the question thus, who would not have preferred the Sybarite enjoyments 1 could command, the philosophic leisure, and ample intellectual resources, to his life of labour and peril ť" Yet he was far happier than 1: for he could hope, nor hope in vain—the destined vessel at last arrived, to bear him to country¬ men and kindred, where the events of his soli¬ tude became a fire-side tale. To none could 1 ever relate the story of my adversity ; no hope had I. líe knew that, beyond the ocean which
begirt his lonely island, thousands lived whom the sun enlightened when it shone also on him : beneath the meridian sun and visiting moon, I alone bore human features; I alone could give articulation to thought ; and, when I slept, both day and night were unbeheld of any. He bad fled from his fellows, and was transported with terror at the print of a human foot. I would have knelt down and worshipped the same. The wild and cruel Caribbee, the merci- les Cannibal —or worse than these, the uncouth, brute, and remorseless veteran in the vices of civilization, would have been to me a beloved companion, a treasure dearly prized—his na¬ ture would be kin to mme ; his form cast in the same mould ; human blood would flow in bis veins; a human sympathy must link us for ever. It cannot be that I shall never be¬ hold a fellow being more í —never!—never!— not in the course of years !—Shall I wake, and sfX'ak to none, pass the interminable hours, my soul, islanded in the world, a solitary point,
surrounded by vacuum ? Will day follow day endlessly thus?-—No! no! a God rules the world—providence has not, exchanged its golden sceptre for an aspic's sting. Away ! let me fly from the ocean-grave, let me depart from this barren nook, paled in, as it is, from access by its own desolateness ; let me tread once again the paved towns ; step over the threshold of man's dwellings, and most certainly I shall find this thought a horrible vision—a maddening, but evanescent dream. * I entered Ravenna, (the town nearest to the spot whereon I had been cast), before the se¬ cond sun had set on the empty world ; I saw many living creatures ; oxen, and horses, and dogs, but there was no man among them ; I entered a cottage, it was vacant; I ascended the marble stairs of a palace, the bats and the owls were nestled in the tapestry ; I stepped softly, not to awaken the sleeping town : I re¬ buked a dog, that by yelling disturbed the sa¬ cred stillness; I would not believe that all was
as it seemed—The world was not dead, but I was mad; I was deprived of sight, hearing, and sense of touch ; 1 was labouring under the force of a spell, which permitted me to behold all sights of earth, except its human inhabitants ; they were pursuing their ordinary laoours. Every house had its inmate ; but I could not perceive them. If I could have deluded my¬ self into a belief of this kind, I should have been far more satisfied. But my brain, tenacious of its reason, refused to lend itself to such ima¬ ginations—and though I endeavoui ed to play the antic to myself, 1 knew that I, the offspring of man, during long years one among many— now remained sole survivor of my species. The sun sank behind the western hills ; I had fasted since the preceding evening, but, though faint and weary, I loathed food, nor ceased, while yet a ray of light remained, to pace the lonely streets. Night came on, and sent every living creature but m^ to the bosom of its mate. It was my solace, to blunt my mental agony
by personal hardship—of the thousand beds around, I woulel not seek the luxury of one ; I lay down on the pavement,—a cold mar¬ ble step served me for a pillow—midnight came ; and then, though not before, did my wearied lids shut out the sight e>f the twinkling stars, and their reflex on ihe pavement near. Thus Τ passed the second night of my desolation.
CHAPTER X.
í awoke in the morning, just as the higher windows of the lofty houses recciveijL the first beams of the rising sun. The birds were chirp¬ ing, perched on the w r indow sills and deserted thresholds of the doors. I awoke, and my first thought was, Adrian and Clara are dead. I no longer shall be hailed by their good-morrow— or pass the long day in their society. I shall never sec them more. The ocean has robbed me of them—stolen their hearts of love from their breasts, and given over to corruption what was dearer to me than light, or life, or hope. I was an untaught shepherd-boy, when
Adrian deigned to confer on me his friendship. The best years of my life had been passed with him. All I had possessed of this worlds goods. oí happiness, knowledge, or virtue—I owed to him. He had, in his person, his intellect, and rare qualities, given a glory to my life, which without him it had never known. Beyond all other beings he had taught me, that goodness, pure and single, can be an attribute of man. It was a sight for angels to congregate to behold, to view him lead, govern, and solace, the last day's of the human race. My lovely Clara also wa> lost to me—she who last of the eiaughters of man, exhibited ail those feminine and maiden \ irtue>s, which poets, painters, and sculptors, have in their various languages strove to express. Yet, as far as she was concerned, could I lament that she was re¬ moved in early youth from the certain advent of misery ? Pure she was of soul, and all her intents were holy. But her heart was the throne of love, and the sensibility her lovely counte-
nance expressed, was the prophet of many woes, not the less deep and drear, because she would ha\e for ever concealed them. These two wondrously endowed beings had been spared from the universal wreck, to be my companions during the last year of solitude. I had felt, while they were with me, all their worth. I w as concious that every other sentiment, regret, or passion had by degrees merged into a yearning, clinging affection for them. I had not forgotten the sweet partner of my youth, mother of my children, my adored Idris ; but 1 saw at least a part of her spirit alive again in her brother ; and after, that by Evelyn's death I had lost what most dearly recalled her to me; I enshrined her memor\ in Adrians form, and endea\ oured to confound the two dear ideas. I sound the depths of my heart, and try in vain to draw thence the expressions that can typify my love for these remnants of my race. If regret and sorrow came athwart me, ai v. ell it might in i.ur solitary and uncertain state, the clear tones of
Adrian's voice, and his fervent look, dissipated the gloom ; or I was cheered unaware by the mild content and sweet resignation Clara's cloud¬ less brow and deep blue eyes expressed. They were all to me—the suns of my benighted soul —repose in my weariness—slumber in my sleep¬ less woe. Ill, most ili, with disjointed words, bare and weak, have I expressed the feeling with which I clung to them. I would have wound myself like ivy inextricably round them, so that the same blow might destroy us. I would have entered and been a part of them— so that If the dull subitanee of mv fledi were thought, even now I had accompanied them to their new and incommunicable abode. Never shall I see them more. I am bereft of their dear converse—bereft of sight of them, I am a tree rent by lightning ; never will the bark close over the bared fibres—never will their quivering life, torn by the winds, receive the opiate of a monienťs balm. I am alone in the
world-^but that expression as yet was less preg¬ nant with misery, than that Adrian and Clara are dead. The tide of thought and feeling rolls on for ever the same, though the banks and shapes around, which govern its course, and the reflec¬ tion in the wave, vary. Thus the sentiment of immediate loss in some sort decayed, while that of utter, irremediable loneliness grew on me with time. Three days I wandered through Ka- venna—now thinking only of the beloved beings who slept in the oozy caves of ocean—now- looking forward on the dread blank before me; shuddering to make an onward step—writhing at each change that marked the progress of the hours. For three days I wandered to and fro in this melancholy town. I passed whole hours in going from house to house, listening whether I could detect some lurking sign of human exist¬ ence. Sometimes I rang at a bell; it tinkled through the vaulted rooms, and silence sue-
ceeded to the sound. I called myself hopeless, yet still I hoped; and still disappointment ushered in the hours, intruding the cold, sharp steel which first pierced me, into the aching festering wound. I fed like a wild beast, which seizes its food only when stung by intolerable hunger, I did not change my garb, or seek the shelter of a roof, during all those days. .Burning heats, nervous irritation, a ceaseless, but con¬ fused flow of thought, sleepless nights, and days instinct with a frenzy of agitation, possessed me during ehat time. As the fever of my blood encreased, a desire of wandering came upon me. I remember, that the sun had set on the ñfth day after my wreck, when, without purpose or aim, I quitted the town of Ravenna. I must have been very ill. Had I been possessed by more or less of de¬ lirium, that night had surely been my last ; for, as I continued to walk on the banks of the Man- tone, whose upward course I followed, I looked wistfully on the stream, acknowledging to my- VOL. ш. r
self that its pellucid waves could medicine my woes for ever, and was unable to account to myself for my tardiness in seeking their shelter from the poisoned arrows of thought, that were piercing me through and through. I walked a considerable part of the night, and excessive weariness at length conquered my repugnance to the availing myself of the deserted habita¬ tions of my species. The waning moon, which had just risen, shewed me a cottage, whose neat entrance and trim garden reminded me of my own England. I lifted up the latch of the door and entered. A kitchen first presented itself, where, guided by the moon beams, I found materials for striking a light. Within this was a bed room ; the couch w r as furnished with sheets of snowy wdiiteness ; the wood piled on the hearth, and an array as for a meal, might almost have deceived mc into the dear belief that I had here found what I had so long sought—one survivor, a companion for my lonehness, a solace to my despair. I steeled
myself against the delusion ; the room itself was vacant : it was only prudent, I repeated to my¬ self, to examine the rest of the house. I fan¬ cied that I was proof against the expectation ; yet my heart beat audibly, as I laid my hand oň the lock of each door, and it sunk again, when I perceived in each the same vacancy. Dark and silent they were as vaults ; so I returned to the first chamber, wondering what sightless host had spread the materials for my repast, and my repose. I drew a chair to the table, and ex¬ amined what the viands were of which I was to partake. I u truth it was a death feast! The breed, was blue and mouldy; the cheese 1ь, a heap of dust. I did not dare examine the other dishes ; a troop of ants passed in a double line across the tablecloth ; every utensil was covered with dust, with cobwebs, and myriads of dead flies: these were objects each and all betokening tihe fallaciousness of my expectations. Tears rushed into my eyes; surely this was a wanton display of the power of the destroyer. What *2
had I done, that each sensitive nerve was thus to be anatomized ? Yet why complain more now than ever ? This vacant cottage revealed no new sorrow—the world was empty; man¬ kind was dead—-I knew it well—why quarrel therefore with an acknowledged and stale truth ? Yet, as I said, I had hoped in the very heart of despair, so that every new impression of the hard-cut reality on my soul brought with it a fresh pang, telling me the yet unstudied les¬ son, that neither change of place nor time could bring alleviation to my misery, but that, as I now was, I must continue, day after day,, month after month, year after year, while I lived, I hardly dared conjecture what space of time that expression implied. It is true, I was no longer in the first blush of manhood ; neither had I declined far in the vale of year»—men have accounted mine the prime of life: I had just entered my thirty-seventh year ; every limb was as well knit* every articulation as true, as when I had acted the shepherd on the hills of
Cumberland ; and with these advantages I was to commence the train of solitary life. Such were the reflections that ushered in my slumber on that night. The shelter, however, and less disturbed re¬ pose which I enjoyed, restored me the follow¬ ing morning to a greater portion of health and strengths than I liad experienced síl ce my fatal shipwreck. Among the stores I had discovered on searching the cottage the preceding night, was a quantity of dried grapes; these re¬ freshed me in the morning, as I left my lodging and proceeded towards a town which I dis¬ cerned at no great distance. As far as I could divine, it must have been Forli. I entered with pleasure its wide and grassy streets. All, it is true, pictured the excess of desolation; yet ï loved to find myself in those spots which had been the abode of my fellow creatures. I de¬ lighted to traverse street after street, to look up at the tall houses, and repeat to myself, once they contained beings similar to myself—I was
not always the wretch I am now. The wide square of Forli, the arcade around it, its light and pleasant aspect cheered me. I was pleased with the idea, that, if the earth should fee again peopled, we, the lost race, would, in the *eÊcs left behind, present no contemptible exhibition* of our powers to the new comers. I entered one of the palaces, and opened the door of a magnificent saloon. I started—I looked again with renewed wonder. What vrild-lookmg, unkempt, half-naked savage was that before me ? The surprise was momentary. I peroeived that it was I myself whom I be¬ held in a large mirror at the end of the halí. No wonder that the lover of the princely Idris should fail to recognize himself in the miserable object there pourtrayed. My tattered dress was that in which I had crawled half alive from the empestuous sea. My long and tangled hair hung in elf locks on my brow—my dark eyes,. now hollow and wild, gleamed from under then» —my cheeks were discoloured by the jaundice*
which (the effect of misery and neglect) suffused my skin, and were half hid by a beard of many days' 1 growth. Yet why should I not remain thus, I thought; the world is dead, and this squalid attire is a fitter mourning garb than the foppery of a black suit. And thus, methinks, I should have re¬ mained, had not hope, without which I do not believe man could exist, whispered to me, that, in such a plight, I should be an object of fear and aversion to the being, preserved I knew not where, but I fondly trusted, at length, to be found by me. Will my readers scorn the vanity, that made me attire myself with some care, for the sake of this visionary being ? Or will they forgive the freaks of a half crazed imagination ? I can easily forgive myself—for hope, however vague, was so dear to me, and a sentiment of pleasure of so rare occurrence, that I yielded readily to any idea, that cherished the one, or promised any recurrence of the former to røy sorrowing heart.
After such occupation, I visited every street, alley, and nook of Forli. These Italian towns presented an appearance of still greater deso¬ lation, than those of England or France. Plague had appeared here earlier—it had finished its course, and achieved its work much sooner than with us. Probably the last summer had found no human being alive, in all the track included be¬ tween the shores of Calabria aud the northern Alps. My search was utterly vain, yet I did not de¬ spond. Reason methought was on my side; and the chances were by no means contemptible, that there should exist in some part of Italy a survi¬ vor like myself—of a wasted, depopulate land. As therefore I rambled through the empty town, I formed my plan for future operation». I would continue to journey on towards Rome. After I should have satisfied myself, by a nar¬ row bcarch, that I left behind no human being m the towns through which I passed, 1 would write up in a conspicuous part of each, with white paint, in three languages, that " Verney,
the last of the race of Englishmen, had taken up his abode in Rome." In pursuance of this scheme, I entered a painter's shop, and procured myself the paint. It is strange that so trivial an occupation should have consoled, and even enlivened me. But grief renders one childish, despair fantastic. To this simple inscription, I merely added the ad¬ juration, u Friend, come ! I wait for thee !— Deh, vieni ! ti aspetto Γ On the following morning, with something like hope for my companion, I quitted Forlì on my way to Rome, Until now, agonizing retro¬ spect, and dreary prospects for the future, had stung me w hen awake, and cradled me to my repose. Many times I had delivered my&elf up to the tyranny of anguish—many times I re¬ solved a speedy eud to my woes; and death by my own hands was a remedy, whose practica¬ bility was even cheering to me. What could I fear in the other world ? If there were an hell, and I were doomed to it, I should come an
adept to the sufferance of its tortures—the act were easy, the speedy and certain end of my de plorable tragedy. But now these thoughts faded before the new born expectation. I went on my way, notas before,feeling each hour, each minute^ to be an age instinct with incalculable pain. As I wandered along the plam, at the foot of the Appennines—through their vallies, and over their bleak summits, my path led me through a country which had been trodden by heroes, visited and admired by thousands. They had, as a tide, receded, leaving me blank and bare in the midst. But why complain? Did I not hope ?—so I schooled myself, even after the en¬ livening spirit had really deserted me, and thus I was obliged to call up all the fortitude I could command, and that was not much, to prevent a recurrence of that chaotic and intolerable despair, that had succeeded to the miserable shipwreck, that had consummated every fear, and dashed to annihilation every joy. f rose each day with the morning sun, and left
my desolate inn. As my feet strayed through the unpeopled country, my thoughts rambled through the universe, and I was least miserable when I could, absorbed in reverie, forget the pas¬ sage of the hours. Each evening, in spite of weariness, I detested to enter any dwelling, there to take up my nightly abode-—I have sat, hour after hour, at the door of the cottage I had se Iected, unable to lift the latch, and meet face to face blank desertion within. Many nights, though autumnal mists were spread around, I passed under an ilex—many times I have supped on arbutus berries and chesnuts, making a fire, gypsy-like, on the ground—because wild na¬ tural scenery reminded me less acutely of my hopeless state of lonelines?, I counted the days, and bore with me a peeled willow-wand, on which, as. well as I could remember, I had notched the days that had elapsed since my wreck, and each night I added another unit to the melancholy sum. I had toiled up ϋ. hill which led to Spoleto.
Around was spread a plain, encircled by the chesnut-covered Appennines. A dark ravine was on one side, spanned by an aqueduct, whose tall arches were rooted in the deli below, and attested that man had once deigned to bestow labour and thought here, to adorn and civilize nature. Savage, ungrateful nature, which in wild sport defaced his remains, protruding her easily re¬ newed, and fragile growth of wild flowers and parasite plants around his eternal edifices. I sat on a fragment of rock, and looked round. The sun bad bathed in gold the western atmo¬ sphere, and in the east the clouds caught the radiance, and budded into transient loveliness. It set on a world that contained me alone for its inhabitant, I took out my wand—-I counted the marks. Twenty-five were already traced— twenty-five days had already elapsed, since hu¬ man voice had gladdened my ears, or human countenance met my gaze. Twenty-five long, weary days, succeeded by dark and lonesome nights, had mingled with foregone years, and
had become a part of the past—the never to be recalled—a real, undeniable portion of my life-— twenty-five long, long days. Why this was not a month í — Why talk of days—or weeks—or months-^-I must grasp years in my imagination, if I would truly picture the future to myself—three, five, ten, twenty, fifty anniversaries of that fatal epoch might elapse— every year containing twelve months, each of more numerous calculation in a diary, than the twenty-five days gone by—Can it be ? Will it be ?—We had been used to look forward to death tremulously—wherefore, but because its place was obscure ? But more terrible, and far more obscure, was the unveiled course of my lone futu¬ rity. 1 broke my wand ; I threw it from me. I needed no recorder of the inch and barley¬ corn growth of my life, whije my unquiet thoughts created other divisions, than those ruied over by the planets—and, in looking back on the age that had elapsed since I had been alone, I disdained to give the name of days aud hours to
the throes of agony which had in truth portioned it out. I hid my face in my hands. The twitter of the young birds going to rest, and their rustling among the trees, disturbed the still evening-air —the crickets chirped—the aziolo cooed at in¬ tervals. My thoughts had been of death—these sounds spoke to me of life. I lifted up my eyes —a bat wheeled round—the sun had sunk behind the jagged line of mountains, and the paly, crescent moon was visible, silver white, amidst the orange sunset, and accompanied by one bright star, prolonged thus the twilight. A herd of cattle passed along in the deli below, untended, towards their watering place—the grass was rustled by a gentle breeze, and the olive-woods, mellowed into soft masses by the moonlight, contrasted their sea-green with the dark che»- nut foliage. Yes, this is the earth ; there is no change—no ruin— no rent made in her verdu¬ rous expanse ; she continues to wheel round and round, with alternate night and day, through
the sky, though man is not ber adorner or in¬ habitant. Why could I not forget myself like one of those animals, and no longer suffer the wild tumult of misery that I endure? Yet, ah í what a deadly breach yawns between their state and mine î Hare not they companion» ? Have not they each their mate—-their cherished young, their home, which, though unexpressed to us, is, I doubt not, endeared and enriched* even in their eyes, by the society which kind nature has created for them? It is I only that am alone—I, on this little hill top, gazing on plain and mountain recess—on sky, and it* starry population, listening to every sound of earth, and air, and murmuring wave,—-1 only cannot express to any companion my many thoughts, nor lay my throbbing head on any loved bosom, nor drink from meeting eyes an intoxicating dew, that transcends the fabuloun nectar of the gods. Shall I not then complain? Shall I not curse the murderous engine which has mowed down the children, of щеп, Щ
brethren ? Shall I not bestow a malediction on every other of nature's offspring, which dares live and enjoy, while I live and suffer ? Ah, no.' I will discipline my sorrowing heart to sympathy in your joys ; I will be happy, be¬ cause ye are so» Live on, ye innocents, nature"'» selected darlings ; I am not much unlike to you. Nerves, pulse, brain, joint, and flesh, of such am I composed, and ye are organized by the same laws. I have something beyond this, but I will call it a defect, not an endowment, if it leads me to misery, while ye are happy. Just then, there emerged from a near copse two goats and a little kid, by the mothers side ; they liegan to browze the herbage of the hill, I approached near to them, without their perceiving me ; I gathered a handful of fresh grass, and held it out; the little one nestled close to its mother^ while she timidly withdrew. The male stepped forward, fixing his eyes on me: I drew near, still holding out my lure, while he, depressing his head, rushed at me with his horns, I was a
very fool ; I knew it, yet I yielded to my rage* I snatched up a huge fragment of rock ; it would have crushed my rash foe. I poized it— aimed it—then my heart failed me. I hurled it wide of the mark ; it rolled clattering among the bushes into dell. My little visitants, all aghast, galloped back into the covert of the wood ; while I, my very heart bleeding and torn, rushed down the hill, and by the violence of bodily exertion, sought to escape from my mise*- rable self. No, no, I will not live among the wild scenes ornature, the enemy of all that lives I will seek the towns·— Rome, the capital of the world» the crown of man's achievements. Among its storied, streets, hallowed ruins, aud stupendous remains of human exertion, I shall not, as here, find every thing forgetful of man ; trampling on his memory, defacing bis works, proclaiming from hill to bill, and vale to vale,—by the tor¬ rents freed from the boundaries which he imposed —by the vegetation liberated from the laws which
he enforced—by his habitation abandoned to mildew and weeds, that his power is lost, his race annihilated for ever. ï hailed the Tiber, for that was as it were an unalienable possession of humanity. I hailed the wild Campagna, for every rood had been trod by man ; and its savage uncultivation, of no recent date, only proclaimed more dis¬ tinctly his power, since he had given an honourable name aud sacred title to what else would have been a worthless, barren track. I entered Eternal Rome by the Porta del Popolo, and saluted with awe its time-honoured space. The wide square^the churches near, the long ex- lent of tlie Corso, the near eminence of Trinità de* Monti appeared like fairy work, they were so «lent, so peaceful, and so very fair. It was evening ; and the population of animals which still existed in this mighty city, had gone to rest ; there was no sound, save the murmur t 'of its many fountains, whose soft monotony wa» harmony to my âoul. The knowledge that I
was in Rome, soothed me ; that wondrous city, hardly more illustrious for its heroes and sages, than for the power it exercised over the ima¬ ginations of men. I went to rest that night ; the eternal burning of my heart quenched,—my senses tranquil. The next morning I eagerly began my ram¬ bles in search of oblivion. I ascended the many terraces of the garden of the Colonna Palace, under whose roof I had been sleeping; and passing out from it at its summit, I found myself on Monte Cavallo. The fountain sparkled in the sun; the obelisk above pierced the clear dark-blue air. The statue» on each side, th« works, as they are inscribed, of Phidias and Praxiteles, stood in undiminished grandeur* representing Castor and Pollux, who with majestic power tamed the rearing animal at their side. If those illustrious årtiets had in truth chiselled these forms, how many pass¬ ing generations bad their giant proportions outlived í and now they were viewed by the last of the species they were sculptured to
represent and deify. I had shrunk into in¬ significance in ray own eyes, as I considered the multitudinous beings these sione demigods had outlived, but this after-thought restored me to dignity in my own conception. The sight of the poetry eternized in these statues, took the sting from the thought, arraying it only in poetic ideality. I repeated to myself,—I am in Rome í I be¬ hold, and as it were, familiarly converse with tlie wonder of the world, sovereign mistress of tlie imagination, majestic and eternal survivor of millions of generations of extinct men. I endea¬ voured to quiet the sorrows of my aching heart, by even now taking an interest in what in my youth I had ardently longed to see. Every part of Rome is replete with relics of ancient times. The meanest streets are strewed with truncated columns, broken capitals—Corinthian and Ionic, and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry. The walls of the most penurious dwellings en* close a fluted pillar or ponderous stone, which o-nce made part of the palace of the Cæsars ;
and the voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified as they were by man. I embraced the vast columns of the temple of Jupiter Stator, which survives in the open space that was the Forum, and leaning my burning check against its cold durability, I tried ίο lose the sense of presen t misery and present desertion, by recalling to the haunted cell of my brain vivid memories of times gone by. I rejoiced at my success, as I figured Camillus, the Gracchi, Cato, and last the heroes of Tacitus, which shine meteors of surpassing brightness during the murky night of the empire ;—as the verses of Horace and Virgil, or the glosving periods of Cicero thronged into the opened gates of my mind, I felt myself exalted by long forgotten enthusiasm. I was delighted to know that î beheld the scene which they beheld—the scene which their wives and mothers, and crowds of the unnamed witnessed, while/ at the same time they honoured, applauded, or wept for these
roatchless specimens of humanity. At length, Uien, I had found a consolation. I had not vainly »ought the storied precincts of Rome—I had discovered a medicine for my many and vital wounds. I sat at the foot of these vast columns. The Coliseum, whose naked ruin is robed by nature in a verdurous and glowing veil, lay in the sun¬ light on my right. Not far off, to the left, was the Tower of the Capitol. Triumphal arches, the falling walls of many temples, strewed the ground at my feet. I strove, I resolved, to force myself to see the Plebeian multitude and lofty Patrician forms congregated around ; and, as the Diorama of ages passed across my subdued fancy, they were replaced by the modern Ro¬ man ; the Pope, in his white stole, distributing benedictions to the kneeling worshippers ; the friar in his cowj ; the dark-eyed girl,-veiled by her raezrøra ; the noisy, sun-burnt rustic, lead¬ ing his herd of bufialoes and oxen to the Campo Vacemo. The romance with which, dipping
our pencils in the rainbow hues of sky and transcendent nature, we to a degree gratuitously endow the Italians, replaced the solemn gran- deur of antiquity. I remembered the dark monk, and floating figures of " The Italian," and how my boyish blood had thrilled at the description. I called to mind Corinna ascending the Capitol to be crowned, and, passing from the heroine to the author, reflected how the Enchantress Spirit of Rome held sovereign sway over the minds of the imaginative, until it rested on me—sole re¬ maining spectator of its wonders. I was long wrapt by such ideas ; but the soul wearies of a pâuseless flight ; and, stooping from its wheeling circuits round and round this spot, suddenly it fell ten thousand fathom deep, into the abyss of the present—into self-knowledge— into tenfold sadness. I roused myself—I cast oft* my waking dreams; and I, who just now could almost hear the shouts of the Itoman throng, and was hustled by countless multitudes, now beheld the desart ruins of Rome sleeping
under its own blue sky ; the shadows lay tran^ quilly on the ground ; sheep were grazing un« tended on the Palatine, and a buffalo stalked down the Sacred Way that led to the Capitol. I was alone in the Foru«m ; alone in Rome ; alone in the world. Would not one living man—one companion in my weary solitude, be worth aLi the glory and remembered power of this time- honoured city? Double sorrow—sadness, bred in Cimmerian caves, robed my soul in a mourn¬ ing garb. The generations I had conjured up to my fancy, contrasted more strongly with the end of all—the single point in which, as a pyramid, the mighty fabric of society had ended, while I, on the giddy height, saw vacant space around me. From such vague laments I turned to the con¬ templation of the minutiæ of my situation. So far, I had not succeeded in the sole object of my de¬ sires, the finding a companion for my desolation. Yet 1 did not despair. It is true that my inscrip¬ tions were set up for the most part, in insignificant
towns and villages ; yet, even without these me¬ morials, it was possible that the person, who like me should find himself alone in a depopulate land, should, like me, come to Kome. The more slender my expectation was, the more I chose to build on it, and to accommodate my actions to this vague possibility. It became necessary therefore, that for a time I should domesticate myself at Rome. It beccarne necessary, that I should look my disaster in the face—not playing the school-boy's part of obe¬ dience without submission ; enduring life, and yet rebelling against the laws by which I lived. Yet how could I resign myself? Without love, without sympathy, without communion with any, how could I meet the morning sun, and with it trace its oft repeated journey to the even¬ ing shades? Why did I continue to live—why not throw off the weary weight of time, and with my own hand, let out the fluttering prisoner from my agonized breast ?—It was not cowardice that withheld me; for the true fortitude was to endure; VOL. III. ц
and death had a soothing sound accompanying it, that would easily entice me to enter its demesne. But this I would not do. I had, from the moment I had reasoned on the subject, instituted myself the subject to fate, and the servant of necessity, the visible laws of the invisible God—I believed that my obedience was the result of sound reason¬ ing, pure feeling, and an exalted sense of the true excellence and nobility of my nature. Could I have seen in this empty earth, in the seasons and their change, the hand of a blind power only, most willingly would I have placed ray head on the sod, and closed my eyes on its love¬ liness for ever. But fate had administered life to me, when the plague had already seized on its prev—she had dragged me by the hair from out the strangling waves—By such miracles she had bought me for her own ; I admitted her autho¬ rity, and bowed to her decrees. If, after mature considerai ion, such was my resolve, it was doubly necessary that I should not lose the end of life, the improvement of my faculties, and poison its
fiow by repmings without end. Yet how cease to repine, since there was no hand near to ex¬ tract the barbed spear that had entered my beai t of hearts? I stretched out my hand, and it touched none whose sensations were responsive to mine. I was girded, walled in, vaulted over, by r»cven-fold barriers of loneliness. Occupation alone, if I could deliver myself up to it, would be capable of affording an opiate to my sleepless sense of woe. Having determined to make Rome my abode, at least for some months, I made arrangements for my accommodation—I selected my home. The Colonna Palace was well adapted for my purpose. Its grandeur—its treasure ot paintings, its magnificent halls were objects sooth¬ ing and eyen exhilarating. I found tlie granaries of Rome well stored with grain, and particularly with Indian corn ; this pro¬ duct requiring less art in its preparation for food, I selected аь my principal support. I now found the hardships and lawlessness of my youth turn to account. A man cannot throw off the habits <¿2
of sixteen years. Since that age, it is true, I had lived luxuriously, or at least surrounded by all the conveniences civilization afforded. But before that time, I had been " as uncouth a .savage, as the wolf-bred founder of old Romc' n — and now, in Rome itself, robber and shepherd propensities, similar to those of its founder, were of advantage to its sole inhabitant. I spent the morning riding and shooting in the Campagna — I passed long hours in the various galleries—I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or beauteous nymph, I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded by marble forms of divine beauty. Each stone deity was possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal fruition of love. They looked on me with u n sympathizing complacency, and often in wild accents I reproached them for their supreme indifference—for they were human shapes, the human form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament. The perfect moulding brought with it tlie idea of colour and motion ;
often, half in bitter mockery, half in self-delusion, I clasped their icy proportions, and, coming be¬ tween Cupid and his Psyche's lips, pressed the unconceiving marble. I endeavoured to read. I visited the libra¬ ries of Rome. I selected a volume, and, choosing some sequestered, shady nook, on the banks of the Tiber, or opposite the fair temple in the Borghese Gardens, or uneler the old pyramid of Cestius, I endeavoured to conceal me from myself, and immerse myself in the subject traced on the pages before me. As if in the same soil you plant nightshade and a myrtle tree, the j y will each appropriate the mould, moisture, and air administered, for the fostering their several pro¬ perties—so elid my grief find sustenance, and power of existence, and growth, in what eke had been divine manna, to feed radiant medita¬ tion. Ah ! while I streak this paper with the tale of what my so named occupations were— «diile 1 shape the skeleton of my days—my (* 3
hand trembles—ray heart pants, and my brain refuses to lend expression, or phrase, or idea, by w hich to image forth the veil of unutterable woe that clothed these bare realities. 0, worn and beating heart, may I dissect thy fibres, and tell how in each unmitigable misery, sadness dire, repinings, and despair, existed ? May I record my many ravings—the wild curses I hurled at torturing nature—and how I have passed days shut out from light and food—from all except the burning hell alive in my own bosom ? I was presented, meantime, with one other occupation, the one best fitted to discipline my melancholy thoughts, which strayed backwards, over many a ruin, and through many a flowery glade ; even to the mountain recess, from which in early youth I had first emerged. During one of my rambles through the habi¬ tations of Rome, I found writing materials on a table in an author's stud v. Parts of a manu- ücript lay scattered about. It contained a learned
disquisition on the Italian language ; one page an unfinished dedication to posterity, for whose profit the writer had sifted and selected the niceties of this harmonious language—to whose everlasting benefit he bequeathed his labours. I also will write a book, I cried—for whom to read?—to whom dedicated? And then with silly flourish (what so capricious and childish as despair ?) I wrote, DEDICATION* TO THE ILLUSTItlOUS DEAD. SHADOWS, AKISE, ΑΧΏ ΚΚΛΙ) YOUIt FALL í BEHOLD THE HISTORY OF THE LAST MAN. Yet, will not this world be re-peopled, and the children of a saved pair of lovers, in some to me unknown and unattainable seclusion, wan¬ dering to these prodigious relics of the ante-pes¬ tilential race, seek to learn how beings so won-
d rous in their achievements, with imaginations infinite, and powers godlike, had departed from their home to an unknown country ? I will write and leave in this most ancient city, this " world's sole monument/' a record of these things. I will leave a monument of the existence of Verney, the Last Man. At first I thought only to speak of plague, of death, and last, of desertion ; but I lingered fondly on my early years, and recorded with sacred zeal the virtues of my companions. They have been with me during the fulfilment of my task. 1 have brought it to an end—I lift my eyes from my paper—again they are lost to me. Again 1 feel that 1 am alone. A year has passed since I have been thus oc¬ cupied. The seasons have made their wonted round, and decked this eternal city in a change¬ ful reibe of surpassing beauty. A year has passed; anel 1 no longer guess at my state or my prospects—loneliness is my familiar, soi row my
inseparable'companioïi. I have endeavoured to brave the storm—I have endeavoured to school myself to fortitude—I have sought to imbue myself with the lessons of wisdom. It will not do. My hair has become nearly grey—my voice, unused now to utter sound, comes strangely on my ears. My person, with its human powers and features, seem to me a monstrous excrescence of nature. How express in human language a woe human being until this hour never knew ! How give intelligible expression to a pang none but I could ever understand î —No one hasentered Home. None will ever come. I smile bitterly at the delusion I have so long nourished, and still more, when I reflect that I have exchanged it for another as delusive, as false, but to which 1 now cling with the same fond trust. Winter has come again ; and the gardens of Home have lost their leaves—the sharp air comes over the Campagna, and has di iven its brute inhabitants to take up their abode in the many dwellings of the deserted city—froat has
suspended the gushing fountains—and Trevi has stilled her eternal music. I had made a rough calculation, aided by the stars, by which I endeavoured to ascertain the first day of the new r year. In the old out-worn age, the Sove¬ reign Pontiff was used to go in solemn pomp, and mark the renewal of the year by driving a nail in the gate of the temple of Janus. On that day I ascended St. Peter's, and carved cm its topmost stone the æra 2100, last year of the world' My only companion was a dog, a shaggy fel¬ low, half water and half shepherd's dog, whom 1 found tending sheep in the Campagna. His master was dead, but nevertheless he continued fulfilling hi» duties in expectation of his return. If a sheep strayed from the rest, he forced it to return to the flock, and sedulously kept off everv intruder. Hiding in the Campagna I had come upon his sheep-walk, and for some time observed his repetition of lessons learned from man, now useless, though unforgotten. His
delight was excessive wdien he saw me. He sprung up to my knees ; he capered remnd and iound, wagging his tail, with the short, quick bark of pleasure : he left his fold to follow mc. and from that day has never neglected to watch by and attend on me, shewing boisterous gratitude whenever I caressed or talked to him. His pat¬ tering steps and mine alone were heard, when we entered the magnificent extent of nave and aisle of St. Peters. We ascended the ïuvriad steps together, when on the summit 1 achieved my design, and in rough figures noted the date of the last year. 1 then turned to gaze on the countrv, and to take leave of Home. I had long determined to quit it, and I now formed the plan I would adopt for my future career, after 1 had left this magnificent abode, A solitary being is by instinct a wanderer, and that 1 wouid become. A hope oi' amelio¬ ration always attends on change of place, which would even fighten the burthen of my life. 1
had been a fool to remain in Home all this time : Borne noted for Maľaria, the famous caterer for death. But it was still possible, that, could I visit the whole extent of earth, I should find in some part of the wide extent a survivor. Methought the sea-side was the most probable retreat to be chosen by such a one. If left alone in an inland district, still they could not continue in the spot where their last hopes had been extinguished ; they would journey on, like me, in search of a partner for their solitude, till the watery barrier stopped their further pro¬ gress. To that water—cause of my woes, perhaps now to be their cure, I would betake myself. Farewell, Italy!—farewell, thou ornament of the world, matchless Rome, the retreat of the soli- tarv one during long months !—to civilized life— to the settled home and succession of monotonous days, farewell í Peril will now be mine ; and I hail her as a friend—death will perpetually cross
my path, and I will meet him as a benefactor ; hardship, inclement weather, and dangerous tempests will be my sworn mates. Ye spirits of storm, receive me ! ye powers of destruction, open wide your arms, and clasp me for ever ! if a kinder power have not decreed another end, so that after long endurance I may reap my re¬ ward, and again feel my heart heat near the heart of another like to me, Tiber, the road which is spread by nature's own hand, threading her continent, w T as at my feet, and many a boat was tethered to the banks- I would with a few books, provisions, and my dog, embark in one of these and float down the current of the stream into the sea; and then, keeping near land, I would coast the beauteous shores and sunny promontoriefe of the blue Mediterranean, pass Naples, along Cala¬ bria, and would dare the twin perils of Scylla and Charybdis ; then, with fearless aim, (for what had I tii lose?) skim ocean's surface towards Malta and the further Cyclades. I would vol. m. H
avoid Constantinople, the sight of whose well- known towers and inlets belonged to another state of existence from my present one ; I would coast Asia Minor, and Syria, and, passing the seven-mouthed Nile, steer northward again, till losing sight of forgotten Carthage and deserted Lybia, 1 should reach the pillars of Hercules. And then—no matter where—the oozy caves, and soundless depths e)f ocean may be my dwell¬ ing, before I accomplish this long-drawn voyage, or the arrow of disease find my heart as I float singly on the weltering Mediterranean ; or, in some place I touch at, I may find what I seek— a companion ; or if this may not be—to endless time, decrepid and grey headed—youth already in the grave with those I love—the lone wanderer will still unfurl his sail, and clasp the tiller—and, .still obeying the breezes e)f heaven, for ever round another and another promontory, anchoring in another and another bay, still ploughing seed¬ less ocean, leaving behind the verdant land of native Europe, ado vv n the tawny shore of Africa,
1 laving weathered the fierce seas of the Cape, I may moor my worn skiff in a creek, shaded by spicy groves of the odorous islands of the far Indian ocean. These are wild dreams. Yet since, now a week ago, they came on me, as I stood on the height of St. Peter's, they have ruled my imagi¬ nation. I have chosen my boat, and laid in my scant stores. 1 have selected a few books ; the principal are Homer and Shakespeare—But the libraries of the world are thrown open to me— and in any port I can renew my stock. I form uo expectation of alteration for the better; but the monotonous present is intolerable to me. Neither hope nor joy are my pilots-—restless despair and fierce desire of change lead me on. I long to grapple with danger, to be excited by fear, to have some task, however slight or volun¬ tary, for each day's fulfilment. I shall witness all the variety of appearance, that the elements can assume—1 shall read fair augury in the rainbow—menace in the cloud—some lesson or
record dear to шу heart in everything. Thus around the shores of deserted earth, while the sun is high, and the moon waxes or wanes, angels, the spirits of the dead, and the ever-open eye of the Supreme, will behold the tiny bark, freighted with Verney—the last man. thk EUD.

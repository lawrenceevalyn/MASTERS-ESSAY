AVING entered the Streigats of Mesk 
sina, the Italian shores appeared in view, 
exhibiting a variety of the most beautiful 
scenery^ set off and heightened by the bril- 
liant clearness of the atmosphere. In the 
enthusiasm it awakened, Osmond could not 
refrain from exclaiming, in the language of 
the poet, 

" Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast, 
The sons of Italy were surely blest > 
â–¼ 01. HI. B Whater^r

"Whatever fruits in different climes were found, 
That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground; 
Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear, 
"Whose bright succession decks the varied year ; 
Whatever sweets salute the northern sky. 
With vernal lives that blossom hut to die : 
These here disporting own the kindred soil. 
Nor ask luxuriance from the jjlanter's toil: 
While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand. 
To vrinnow fragrance round the smiling land." 

But human pleasure is liable to conti- 
nual interruptions. As the vessel was 
doubling Cape di Spartivento, a galley 
suddenly bore down upon it, and, being 
unprepared for resistance, took it with 
little opposition. 

The Count, who was all impatience to 
behold his dear aunt, and realise the plans 
he had formed for the amusement of Os- 
mond, was nearly distracted at this unex- 
pected event, and with his usual impe- 
tuosity would immediately have announced 
his rank to the pirates, and endeavoured 
to enter into a negociation with them for 

the

the restoration of his liberty, but for CX*}- 
mond's entreating him in a whisper not 
to be hasty in any thing he did on the 
present occasion, as he had not a doubt 
but that the knowledge of his rank would 
rather retard than accelerate his wishes. 

" Well, my dear friend," replied the 
poor Count, with a mournful look, and in 
a low voice, " you shall guide me; but I 
trust you'll no longer deny that I am sin- 
gularly unfortunate, that I am one of those 
unhappy b^ngs over whom a kind of fata- 
lity seem^^ hang, counteracting and dis- 
appointing all their intentions/' 

Osmond was on the point of answerino- 
when a smart blow on the back with the 
flat side of a cutlass prevented him ; and 
turning with quickness he perceived a 
fierce and savage-looking man behind him, 
who, from his* dress and the authority he 
assumed, he concluded to be the captain 
of these sea robbers â€” " Come, come, my 
young spark," cried he in Italian, on catch- 
ing the eye of Osmond, '- you and your 
B 'i com pa-

companion here must shift your quarters.^ 
So saying he took him by the arm and led 
him into the galley, as did one of his com- 
panions the Count. The crew of the cap- 
tured vessel being secured under the 
hatches, and a few men put on board to 
manage it, the pirate, to the surprise of 
the Count, shaped his course towards 
Acerenza. 

While securing the other prisoners, Os- 
mond and the Count were locked up by 
themselves in the principal cabin, and had 
thus an opportunity afforded of convers- 
ing, of which the Count, in particular, 
eagerly availed himself. â€” '' Oh, miserable 
man that I am!" he exclaimed, striking 
his breast with violence, the moment he 
found himself again alone w^ith Osmond; 
" oh, miserable man ! destined to be the 
incessant sport of fortune! Oh, wretched 
life, in which there is nothing certain but 
death ! Though born to wealth and ho- 
nours, yet here am 1, doomed perhaps to 
pass the remainder of my days in slavery â€” 

a slavery 



THE DISCARDED SON. 5 

a slavery the horrors of which will be ag- 
gravated by the idea of your being also 
dragged into it through niy means." 

'' For heaven's sake, my dear Count/' 
cried Osmond, who began to be seriously 
alarmed for his senses^ so wild and disor- 
dered were his looks and gestures, '' endea- 
vour to moderate these transports. I make 
no doubt this affair will end better than 
you imagine." 

'' But should it not, should it not," de- 
manded the Count, in apparent agony, 
and clasping his hands, '' will you then be 
able to administer any consolation, to sug- 
gest any arguments calculated to assuage 
my misery r" 

'' I trust I shall," said Osmond, endea- 
vouring to raliy his own spirits (for he 
was not without his share of agitation at 
the Situation in which he found himself), 
that he might be enabled to speak with 
calmness to the Count, such as had hitherto 
proved successful in subduing the violence 
of his emotions ; '' I trust I shall â€” trust I 
s 3 shall

shall be able to convince voik that in the 
midst of all their distresses^ there remains 
to every sincere Christian that mixture of 
pure and genuine consolation which 
springs from the promises and hopes of 
the gospel ; of what a singularly happj 
distinction this makes in their situation^ 
beyond the state of those who are left 
without any thing Xo look to but a train 
of unknown causes and accidents^ in which 
they see no lights no comfort; of the joy- 
ful hope we can entertain that the suffer- 
ings of the present time are but slight when 
compared with the happiness promised in 
the end to the virtuous; that -evils besides, 
when borne with patience and dignity, 
improve and ennoble our characters, bring 
into exercise several of the manly and he- 
roic virtues, and by the constancy and 
iidelity they call into action on earth, 
prepare us for X\\^ highest rewards in hea- 
ven ; that moreover, from the present 
constitution of human nature, it is requi- 
site for our well-being that they should be

scattered in our path^ since few of us can 
bear uninterrupted prosperity without be- 
ing corrupted by it ; the poisonous weeds 
that grow up in that too luxuriant soil re- 
quire the hand of adversity to extirpate 
them. It is the experience of sorrow and 
distress that subdues the arrogance of 
pride, tames the violence of passion, soft- 
ens the hardness of the Felfisi-i heart, and 
humanizes the temper to feel for the woes 
of others." 

The Count here seized the hands of Os- 
mond, and pressed them with fervor to his 
bosom. â€” â€¢' Oh my dear friend/' with tear- 
ful eyes, he cried, '' what would I give 
tha/ 1 had the same command over my 
feelings that you have ; that I had my 
mind stored with the same self-evident and 
divine truths that yours is; since I ain 
satisfied, if that were the case, I should be 
a very diflerent creature to what I now am, 
capable of supporting the hour of trial 
with fortitude, and admiYiistering consola- 
tion to myself and others; but from this

instant I am resolved to set about the 'con- 
quest of myself â€” resolved to prove to you, 
that I ha\^ profited by your arguments 
and example. Yes, I'll no more be like 
a vane blown about by every gale. To 
convince you I am sincere, I wish to hea- 
ven some new trial was this moment to 
befal me. For from henceforth," he add- 
ed, starting up with an altered voice and 
countenance, 

" No terror to my view, 
No frightful face of danger can be new ; 
Inui'd to sufiTer, and resolv'd to bear, - 
The fates without my power shall be without my care." 

Osmond did not altogether join him in 
the above wish, aware that to declaim 
against our errors was a much easier thing 
than to conquer them when of long stand- 
ing. 

Their conversation was at length inter- 
rupted by the entrance of the Captain and 
another man. The evening was by this 
time far advanced; and in a gruf?' voice 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. ii 

the former demanded of his prisoners whe- 
ther they would not turn in ? To which 
the Count replied in the negative^ add- 
ing, disturbed minds could feel but little 
inclined to repose. 

" Well/' rejoined the Captain, but in the 
same surly tone, '' you may follow your 
inclinations; we know how to treat pri- 
soners well, who have the appearance of 
being able to pay for good treatment/' 

'' Depend on it/' said the Count eagerly, 
and starting from the seat on which he had 
just thrown himself, '' there's none we ex- 
perience from you shall go unrewarded^ 
Say what you demand for oiir release/*' 
continued he, forgetful of all Osmond had 
said to him against precipitancy on the 
subject, '' and " 

'' Patience, patience," interrupted the 
Captain, with a grin of exultation, " I 
have too much business on my hands to 
engage in any other at present. The day 
after to-morrow, and you and 1 will talk 
over what you have mentioned/* 

B 5^ This. 



1(5 THE DISCAI^DF.D SON, 

This speech^ tending to convince Os- 
mond there was but little danger of their 
being detained in captivity^ calmed in a 
great degree the agitation of his mind. It 
failed, however, of producing a similar 
effect on the Count, owing to his anger at 
the delay of the negociation he wished 
to enter into; and thus, bv the feel in o^s 
he betrayed on the occasion, convinced 
Osmond that notwithstanding his recent 
assertions, he had not yet entered upon the 
task of reformation. 

The Captain's companion having taken 
Â«ome provisions from a locker^ they seated 
themselves at a table ; and regardless of the 
presence of their prisoners, who sat at some 
distance from them, renewed a conversa- 
tion in which they w^ere engaged on enter- 
ing the cabin. â€” '' I tell you again," cried 
the Captain, '' you did wrong, very wrong, 
Varcclli, in persuading me to make the 
recent capture; for I am convinced, in 
consequence of the division of our crew 
it has occasioned,. we shall not be able to 
carry the Marchese's plan into execution." 

" Bless 



THE DISCARDED SDK. II 

'^ Bless your heart/' replied the other, 
*^*" who have v.e to contend with but wo- 
men ? I bet voii anv wao:er, that with four 
men I achieve the business in hand.'* 

" Hold, hold, not so fast, my friend/* 
returned the Captain ; ^'^ I see you know 
but little of the establishment of the castle 
of Acerenza by W'hat you have said. Why 
to my knowledge there are never less than . 
forty men-servants within it, all stout, 
strong, active fellows, and who would soon 
succeed in sending you and your fourm.en 
to the devil, Mr. Varcelli. If T had not 
been obliged to divide my brave lads, by 
yielding to your avaricious wishes, I should 
not have doubted succeeding in the en- 
terprize we have undertaken ; but now% 
weakened as our force is, T have serious 
apprehensions of failing in it. A pretty 
thing it will be if w^e are compelled to 
give it up, and thus not only lose the 
reward promised us by the Marchese, but 
the chance we should have had, by perse- 
vering in it, of enriching ourselves with 
the treasures of Acerenza. Come, as you 
B 6 have

have been the means of brinonioj me 
into a hobble, set your d â€” mnd plotting 
brains to work to get me out pf it.*' 

While this discourse was passings Os- 
mond watched the Count with fear and 
trembling, terrified lest from the emotion 
he saw it had thrown him into, he should 
discover himself â€” a circumstance which he 
doubted not would occasion^ if not their 
imim.ediate destruction^ at least their lasting 
captivity ; as, from what he had heard of 
the Marchese SalviJina, he was convinced 
he vv^as the person who had instigated the 
rufiians to the attack of Acerenza, for the 
purpose of either murdering or carrying 
off the Count, of v/hose not being there 
at present he understood he was igno- 
rant. 

The cabin being small, and the looks of 
the Captaki and his comrade every now 
and then directed towards him and his 
friend^ he could do nothing more than en- 
deavour to catch the eyes of the Count, in 
order to g've him a significant look, ex- 
pressive of the ixecessity there was for 

silence; 



THE DISCARDED so^^ IS 

silence; but in vain he tried to do this ; 
the looks of the Count were rivetted upon 
the ruffians; and at length, to the utter 
dismay of Osmond, he passionately ex- 
claimed;, clasping his hands together, and 
looking up â€” '' Gracious heaven ! surely 
you will not permit such wickedness to 
triumph. You will not permit innocence 
and virtue to be injured with impunity." 

'^ Hey ho ! what's that you said, my 
spark?" cried the Captain, dropping his 
knife and fork, with which he had for some 
time been very busily employed, and turn- 
ing, as did his companion Varcelli, a fierce- 
ly-inquiring look, first upon the Count and 
then on Osmond. 

The Count instantly arose ; Osmond also 
started from his seat ; and perceiving, if he 
did not prevent his speaking, all he wished 
concealed would be betrayed, pushed him 
aside, and stepping before him, exclaimed, 
but not without giving him an expressive 
glance â€” '' 111 tell you â€” I'll explain to you 
the cause of his exclamation." 

'^ Be 



14 THE DISCARDED SON. 

" Be quick, then/' cried the Captain ; 
^' let me know without hesitation whether 
either of you know aught of the castle of 
Acerenza, or the family it belongs to ?" 

'' Yes, yes, you shall be obeyed," re- 
turned Osmond, slowly approaching the 
table, endeavouring to think of something 
plausible to say. 

'' WIell, why don't you begin/', cried the 
Captain. 

'" Ere I do," rejoined Osmond, hesitat- 
ingly, and in order to gain a little more 
time for consideration, " will you favour 
me with a glass of brandy and water ?" 

" Varcelii, hand him the glass," said the 
Captain gruffly. 

Varcelii obeyed. Osmond kept the glass 
for a few minutes to his lips; and during 
this interval, recollected himself sufiicient- 
]y to fabricate the following story for his 
insolent interrogator: â€” 

'' I perceive, from the exclamation of 
my friend, you have been led to imagine 
â€¢wx know something of the Morati family. 

In 



THE DISCARDED SON". 15 

In the supposition that we do^ you are not 
mistaken." 

" The devil I'm not!" vociferated the 
Captain^ pushing back his chair from the 
table;, in order to have a better opportu- 
nity of viewing Osmond. 

'' No," returned Osmond, with coolness, 
'''you are not; though greatly so^, if you 
imagine we are interested about' any of 
the members of it. 

'' For several years a law-suit of consi- 
derable consequence has been carrying on 
between the houses of Morati andTarento. 
To bring it to a conclusion, the evidence 
of two persons of the name of Alhama,. 
father and uncle to my friend here (glanc- 
ing at the Count), was a few months ago 
found to be necessary. Accordingly an 
inquiry was set on foot after them; and 
at length, though not ^yithout great diffi- 
culty, their residence being in a remote 
part of Spain, they were discovered, and 
induced to come to Italy. Previous to 
their arrival, it was ascertained that their 
5 evidence 



J 6 TJIF DISCARDED SON, 

evidence was likely to occasion the suit to 
be decided in favour of the Tarento family. 
This circumstance instigated the haughty 
and sanguinary one of Morati to form the 
horrible project of assassinating them â€” a 
project they but too well succeeded in car- 
rying into effect. My friend, on learning 
the dreadful fate of his two nearest and 
dearest relatives, and that their murderers, 
owing to their rank and consequence in 
the country, had met with no punishment 
for their crime, took a solemn vow never 
to rest till with his own hand he had in- 
flicted an exemplary one on them. In 
short, to be candid â€” for since I have told 
so much I may as well tell you all â€” nothing 
short of the life of the Marchese Morati, 
and her nephews, the young Count Pla^ 
eentia, who was also concerned in the 
murder, w^ill appease his vengeance. We 
were bound for her castle, the walls of 
which we intended scaling at nighty when 
you captured us.'' 

'' And pray who may you be.^" demand- 
ed 



THE DISCARDED SON. If 

cd the Captain^ surveying him with a seriv- 
tinizing look; '' did the Morati family 
murder any of your kindred }" 

'' No/' replied Osmond^ with quickness^ 
" but in injuring^ my friend^ they injured 
me. You inquire who I am. I have 
been known some time to Don Alhama; 
and on his imparting his injuries to me, 
pledged my word to assist him in taking- 
revenge for them.*' 

" Wellj well, 'tis a maxim v/ith me never 
to interfere in what does not concern my- 
self/' cried the Captain, again drawing in 
his chair to the table, and filling himself 
out a bumper of brandy. " In a little 
time, upon certain conditions which I shall 
then explain to you, I shall make no ob- 
jection to setting you and your friend free, 
to blow the castle of Acerenza to ,the de- 
vil if you chuse it/' 

Osmond bowed in token of gratitude, 
and then retreated from the table. In a 
few minutes after, the Captain and his 
companion quitted the cabin. The mo- 

m.ent

ment the astonished Count heard them 
overhead â€” '' For heaven's sake^ my dear 
friend," he cried, in alow voice, and turn- 
ing his eyes full upon Osmond, '' what was 
your motive for fabricating such a story 
as you have just told ?" 

*' This is no time for explaining/* re- 
turned Osmond ; " I can only assure you a 
very sufficient one, and entreat you to keep 
yourself composed, let you hear what you 
may ; above all, to be silent with respect 
to yourself Thank Heaven, it occurred 
to us to give Antonio a caution on the 
subject, ere he was removed from us." 

" I will endeavour to act as you wish, 
my friend," replied the Count ; '' perhaps 
Heaven m^av enable us to frustrate the in- 
tentions of these ruffians with regard to 
A^'erenza." 

" I trust it may," cried Osmond ; and in 
saying so, he said not only what he sin- 
cerely hoped, but was beginning to think 
might be the case; since, from the impli- 
cit credit the Captain appeared to give td^ 

his 



THE DISCARDED SON; l[) \ 

1 

his story, and his acknowledged want of ] 

hands for the business in agitation, he 
thought it probable as well as possible that 
he and his friend might be allowed to join 
the crew in their meditated attack upon > 

the castle, and thus an opportunity afibrded 
of alarming its inhabitants in time to put ^ 

ihem on their guard. ^ 

The Captain shortly after returned to I 

the cabin, still accompanied by Varcelli, 
who appeared to be his right-hand' man; \ 

and soon after, in consequence of a hint 
he dropt, the Count and Osmond retired \ 

to their respective births. - 

Neither were inclined to repose; and i 

even if thev had, they vv^ould still have re- i 

sisted the inclination, from the anxiety 
they felt to overhear the Captain and his j 

associate. Nothing new, however, tran- 'â–  

spired from either. 

They had the honour of breakfasting the - 

next morning with them; soon after which I 

they were left for several hours to them- â€¢ 

selves^ during which they suffered no smalr^vf?? 

inquietude^ 



$0 THE DISCARDED SON. 

inquietude, hints having dropt from the 
Captain while at breakfast of its being his- 
intention to make an attack upon the castle 
of Acerenza in the course of the approach- 
ing night. At length Varcelli made his 
appearance, and told Osmond the Captaia 
wanted to speak to him upon deck. 

Thither Osmond immediately followed^ 
^vith a heart palpitating with the hopes 
this summons gave rise to. â€” '' Well, my 
friend,'' cried the Captain, taking him by 
the arm i\\e moment he appeared, and 
drawing him aside, '' does the spark below 
continue in the same mind he was in yes- 
terday.?" â€” Osmond bowed. â€” ''And are 
you as inclined as ever to aid him in his 
designs on the Morati family }" â€” Osmond 
again bent his head. â€” '' Come, come, 
man," proceeded tlie Captain, in a surly 
tone, and with a look which perfectly ac- 
corded wilh it, '' speak out at once, and 
don't be giving me any of your d â€” mnd 
dumb-show." 
V^ " Our sentiments^ then, with regard to 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 21 

the Morati family have not experienced 
the least change/' said Osmond. 

'' Then, since that is the case/' cried the 
Captain joyfully, '' we may all accomplish 
our respective wishes comfortably and 
pleasantly together. You must know that 
my crew is so weakened, owing to my hav- 
ing sent part on board the vessel you were 
in, that without two or three additional 
hands, I do not think it would be safe to 
venture to x\cerenza. Now, rather than 
be at the trouble of sending to shore in 
quest of a few bravoes, I w^ill let you and 
your friend accompany me thither to- 
night, and thus afford you a speedy op- 
portunity of taking the revenge you thirst 
for, provided you give me up whatever 
valuables you have about you, as it is not 
my intention to ask you to return to the 
ship with me ; and which, considering how 
ready I am to oblige you, and the hand- 
some usage you have received from me^ I 
think you cannot possibly object to.'* 

'' Assuredly not," returned Osmond, 

eagerly 



gf THE DISCARDED SON. 

eagerly and delightedly. " Permit me to 
inform my friend of your kindness; for 
since the dreadful fate of his relations, he 
has been in a state of mind that renders 
caution necessary in communicating any 
thing to him calculated to afi'ect his feel- 
ings/* 

'' Very well, you shall ; but rem.ember," 
continued the Captain, in a jocose tone, 
and with a sly look, '' no tricks upon tra- 
vellers. I saw a handsome watch-chain in 
his fob, and several handsome rings on his 
fingers." 

Osmond laid his hand upon his breast â€” 
"Trust to my honour," said he; " if all 
the things vou saw are not forthcoming, 
I shall not ask you to fulfil your present 
generous intentions respecting us/* 

" That's an honest lad/' returned the 
Captain, clapping him on the back ; '' but 
remember you tell your friend there must 
be no jabbering till we have done our 
work in the castle. About twelve, I in- 
tend landing ; by which time, as there is 

no 



TPIE DISCAIIDED SON. 23 

no moon at present, the night will be as 
dark as we could wish. By the help of 
scaling-ladders, we shall easily surmount 
the walls that encompass the castle. Our 
difficulties and dangers commence when 
we get within those ; as in the centre of 
the outer court is a double row of low 
buildings, occupied by the male domes- 
tics." 

" But what then ?" asked Osmond, anx- 
iously. *' You reckon upon their all being 
asleep, or at any rate in bed, I conclude, 
before you make your entry." 

" Why, yes. But as I was going to ob- 
serve â€” whether up or abed, never being 
ofl' their guard, too much caution cannot 
be used in passing their lodgings to the 
upper court, which once having got pos- 
session of, we may, by having the whole 
of the castle and all the rest of its inhabi- 
tants then completely in our power, bid 
them defiance." 

'' Never off their guard, do you say?" 

cried 



24 THE DISCARDED SON. 

cried Osmond, with difficultly suppressed 
eagerness. 

*' No, they have always arms and lights 
beside them, in case of a surprise like the 
one I meditate ; and which, from the situ- 
ation of the castle on a lonely part of the 
coast, its owners have always been appre- 
hensive of. So recollect, my friend, to 
keep in mind the necessity of circumspec- 
tly) n ; for once alarmed, and we have but 
little chance of succeeding in our enter- 
prize.'* 

" Rely upon my making a proper use 
of what you have told me,'' said Osmond, 
with sparkling eyes and a flushing cheek; 
" and now, with your permission, I'll return 
to my friend below." 

, He accordingly descended to the cabin, 
and found the poor Count the very pic- 
ture of despair. He motioned him to the 
window, and in a low accent, and as brief- 
ly as possible, revealed to him the motive 
of his fabricated story to the Captain, and 
the result of it. 

Extravagant 



THE DISCARDED SON. 25 

Extravagant as were the transports the 
Count had given way to on former occa- 
sions, they were trifling compared with 
those he now betrayed. He laughed and 
wept at the same instant, returned thanks 
to Heaven, and rapturously embracing Os- 
mond, called him not only his preserver, 
but the preserver of his family. Then 
putting all his valuables into his hands, â€” 
'' Here, here, my dear friend," he cried, 
" let the rascal have all these immediately ; 
and if not sufficient to satisfy his rapacity, 
let him send me a bond for any sum, and 
I will sion it.'' 

Osmond, again terrified for his senses, 
endeavoured to calm the transports which 
in his opinion endangered them, by re- 
minding him of the fatal consequences 
that might result from the least impru- 
dence, and the recent assurance he had 
given him of endeavouring to gain a com- 
mand over himself â€” '' In order to prove 
to me that vou w^ere siiicere in 5rivinÂ«' it/"* 

YOL. III. c conti- 



26 THE DISCARDED SON. 

continued he, '' *tis requisite that you 
t^hould bear the present change in your 
prospects with moderation/' 

" My dear friend/' cried the Count, 
gently pressing his arm, '' rest assured 
that you shall never again see me so dis- 
turbed. But now, not to be all extasy, 
all transport, that I find we are on the 
point of regaining the liberty I feared was 
for ever lost to us, would, in my opinion, 
be to argue me possessed of a dull inani- 
mate soul.'* 

A reply from Osmond was prevented by 
the entrance of the Captain. 

'' Heyday, my young sparks," cried he, 
as he rushed in, '' have you got to logger- 
heads, that you speak so loud ? at least 

you, Don , I forget your name,'* 

glancing at the Count.

*' And therefore wert thou bred to virtuous knowledge. 
And wisdom early planted in thy soul, 
That thou might'st know to rule thy fiery passions, 
To bind their rage, and stay their headlong course ; 
To bear with accidents, and ev'ry chance 
Of various life ; to struggle with adversity ; 
To wait the leisure of the righteous gods ; 
Till they, in their own good appointed hour.

A long and shining train ; till thou, well pieas'd. 
Shall bow, and bless thy fate, and own the gods are just."

THE DISCARDED SON. 29 

Long before the midnight hour, the vessel 
was anchored within sight of the castle ; 
and exactly at twelve, the party destined 
to attack it was landed beneath its walls, 
armed with pistols, cutlasses, and boarding- 
pikes. The walls, by means of scaling- 
ladders, were surmounted with ease. Os- 
mond took care to be afnongst the first 
who attempted them. The night was of a 
pitchy darkness â€” dark as the deed the pi- 
rate hoped to perpetrate beneath its man- 
tle; but a glimmering light at a distance 
pointed out to Osmond the buildings oc- 
cupied by the servants. 

With cautious steps he drew awav from 
the ruffians, and advancing up the court drew 
a pistol from his belt, and fired it. The con- 
sequence was such as he looked for. The 
domestics, alarmed, quickly sallied forth ; 
some with arms, and others with torches. 
The moment they appeared â€” " The walls 
have been scaled by banditti, my friend>^," 
exclaimed Osmond ; '' be prompt in your 
measures, and they cannot escape.'' 

c 3 '' This

" This way^ this way/* (to the utter 
astonishment of the domestics^ ^ho had no 
idea of his being then more than on his 
way to the castle) vociferated the County 
who unperceived had followed the steps of 
Osmond; but notwithstanding their asto- 
nishment, no time was lost in making in- 
quiries ; and after a slight scuffle the pirate 
and his crew were seized. 

A servant then hastened to the inner 
courts to account to the Marchesa for the 
xecent disturbancej and prepare her for the 
approaching interview with her nephew. 
By the time, therefore, he and his friend 
reached the castle, she, with several of her 
attendants, was ready to receive him. 

Their meeting was truly affecting : for 
several minutes neither had power to 
express the mutual pleasure it gave rise 
to. When at length tears had a little 
relieved the fulness of their hearts, the 
Count, gently disengaging himself from 
the enfolding arms of the Marchesa, turned 
to Osmond, and taking him by the haiKiâ€” 

" Behold, 



THE DISCAEDED SON. 31 

'- Behold, my dearest aunt/' he cried, as 
he led him towiirds her, '' the person to 
whom, under Heaven, you are indebted for 
your present safety â€” to whom I am indebt- 
ed for the power of congratiifating y'>n on 
it. But for his interposition, I should ere 
this, I make no doubt, have been no more. 
After saying thivS, it were sirperflaous to 
add^ the ob!ij>ations I owe him arc unre- 
turnable. Receive him, my dearest aiint â€” 
receive the Chevalier Munro as a second 
son. Trust me, the welcome and esteem 
which you may now grant him on my ac- 
count, you will shortly accord him on his 
own." 

The Mavchesa extended her hand, and 
taking Osmond's, pressed it to her lips and 
to her heart. 

''Welcome, thrice welcome," she said;, 
*â– ' to Acerenza. Oh how unnecessary for the 
Count to desire me to receive as a son him 
to whom, he informs me I am indebted for 
the preservation of his life !" 

*' The Count rates quite too highly, 
c 4 Madam, 



52 TEE DISCAHDED SON. 

Madam, the services I had the happiness of 
rendering him/' returned Osmond, as with 
the warm glow of gratitude and sensibility 
diiTusing itself over his cheek, he bowed 
respectfully on her hand. " He does more 
' â€” he forgets that for any I conferred, I 
have received more than an adequate re- 
turn. Yes^ my dear Madam, believe me I 
am more a debtor than a creditor of the 
Count." 

"" Generous souls ever endeavour to 
make light of the obligations they confer,'* 
said the Marchesa : " but come," added 
she, '' we'll change the subject for the 
present^ for I am certain you both need 
refreshment; and besides I am all impatience 
to learn the particulars of the recent affair, 
to what circumstance your arriving at such 
a moment, and in such company, is 
owing." 

As she spoke, she led the way to a table 
which the delighted and afibctionate do- 
mestics had already spread with refresh- 
ments; and seating herself at it, with the 

Count 



THE DISCARDED SON. S3 

Count on one hand and Osmond on the 
other^ was soon gratified by the recital 
she wished to hear; when agitation im- 
peded the utterance of the Count, Os- 
mond taking up the story ; and when 
modesty caused Osmond to pause, the 
Count impetuously pursuing it. 

^' Good Heaven \" exclaimed the Mar- 
chesa, on their concluding; " how won- 
derful are thy ways, in all how manifest 
thy wisdom and goodness ! How forcibly 
does what 1 have just heard convince me 
that we should never be impatient under 
afflictions ! Had you not been taken by 
the pirate/' addressing herself particu- 
larly to the Count, " a meeting like the 
present would never in all probability 
have taken place; and yet 1 dare say at 
the moment you were not a little discon- 
certed at the circumstance." 

The Count blushed, and Osmond invo- 
luntarily smiled at these words, which the 
Marchesa perceiving, also smiled herselfj 
but in a manner which gave Osmond to 
c 5 under- 



S4 THE DISCARDED SON. 

understand she was thoroughly acquainted 
with the temper of her nephew. 

After two hours passed at table, she in- 
sisted on the friends retiring to repose. 
Accordingly, Osmond was conducted to a 
magnificent chamber, where fatigue, united 
to the happy consciousness of security, 
quickly closed his eyes. 

On awaking in the morning, he touched 
a bell, as he had been desired to do, when 
he chose to rise. A servant immediately 
obeyed his summons; and having accom- 
modated him with a rohe cle chamhre, de- 
sired to knovz whether he would like the 
refreshment of a bath. Osmond replying 
in the affirmative, v/as conducted to one 
lined with bea^Uiful white marble, at the 
end of a gallery adjoining his chamber, 
and whence he was ushered to an elegant 
dressing-room, where he found habiliments 
of various kinds prepared for him â€” a very 
pleasing attention, as by this time his own 
were not such as he could have liked to 
appear in. On being drcst, he was shewn 

to 



THE DISCAEDED SON. 35 

to a saloon, where the Marchesa awaited 
him to breakfast. She received him with 
a smile of true benevolence, and led him 
herself to the breakfast-table, which front- 
ed a range of lofty lattices, descending to 
the ground, and commanding a view of 
the most beautiful scenery. 

" You must be content. Chevalier," said 
she, as they took their seats, '' to breakfast 
alone with me ; for the Count finds h'm- 
self too much affected by the recollections 
this place hss revived, to be able to join 
us for the present." 

Osmond made a suitable reply to this 
speech^* and the Marchesa, previously, 
however, dismissing the attendants, pro- 
ceeded to say â€” '' To tell you the truth. 
Chevalier, I am rather pleased tban other- 
wise at his absence, being extremely anx- 
ious for the opportunity it has afforded 
me of having a little private, con^ ersation 
with you. Though still early," she conti- 
nued, smiling perhaps interr:ully at the 
surprise which from the looks of Osmond 
c6 it 



36 THE DISCARDED SON. 

it was evident this declaration occasioned 
him, '' we nevertheless have had a long 
conversation this morning, by which means 
I have ascertained your possessing an as- 
cendancy over him, that convinces me you 
are the properest person that can be 
chosen for disclosing the joyful tidings in 
store for him." 

Osmond started and clasped his hands. 
'' Joyful tidings !'" he repeated, in atone 
and with a look that, had a doubt been 
entertained of the sincerity of his regard 
fov the Countj would at once have dissi- 
pated it. 

" Oh how delightful is it," resumed the 
Marcliesa, perfectly appreciating his feel- 
ings on this occasion, and smiling with a 
tearful eye and ineffable sweetness on him, 
^' when friendships take root in our early 
years, ingrafted on the ingenuous sensibi- 
lity of youth; since friendships then con- 
tracted possess and retain to the last a ten- 
derness and warmth seldom known in those 
that are formed in the riper periods of life, 

Qf 



THE DISCARDED SON. S7 

of which the emotions excited by the re- 
membrance of our ancient and youthful 
connections is a convincing proof ! for 
what heart is there of the smallest feeling 
that does not melt away at the recollet tion 
of those; and no w^onder the dissolution 
of them being perhaps the most painful 
trial to which we are exposed here below/'" 
A deep sigh issued from her bosom as 
she uttered these last words â€” a sigh which 
evinced this observation the result of ex- 
periencC;, not conjecture. After a short 
pausCj she thus went on â€” "" Yes^ joy fid 
tidings, I repeat;, avv'ait my dear nephew, 
which you will readily allow^ I believCj 
when informed that his juvenile friend, the 
Dukede Molina lives, and that his fair mis- 
tress. Lady Elizara, is still unmarried â€” the 
one as much his friend, and the other as 
inclined as ever to unite her destiny with 
his ; of which, but for the precipitancy 
with which he was hurried from ihe king- 
dom, he would have heard ere this ; as the 
very day after his rencontre with the DukCj 

Lady 



SS THE DISCARDED SON. 

Lady Elizara arrived in Naples, having con- 
trived, by means of a domestic whom she 
bribed to assist her, to effect her escape 
from the mansion whither Salvilina con- 
veyed her from Acerenza, for the pur- 
pose of compelh'ng her to become his 
bride; and as soon as her brother was 
in a state of convalescence, so fully jus- 
tified the Count in his opinion, and con- 
vinced him, that only a mind black as Sal- 
vilina's could have cast an imputation 
on him, that all his friendship for and 
wish for an alliance with him revived ; 
to prove which, as soon as he was able to 
travel, he set out for this castle, with his 
sister, trusting he should find the Count 
concealed within it. His disappointment 
at not meeting him was considerably ag- 
gravated by our not then knowing where 
the dear wanderer was. He determined 
on going himself in quest of him ; but 
honoured me by entrusting Lady Elizara 
to my care. In the letter I wrote to the 
Count, to acquaint him with the death of 

my 



THE DISCARDED SON. S9 

my dear Lord, and entreat his speedy re- 
turn^ I feared disclosing to him the happy 
termination of his troubles^ lest the tran- 
sports I well knew such a disclosure would 
excite should be too much, without a 
friend at hand to moderate them ; for a 
frame and mind like his, enervated by sick- 
ness and long-suffering, I still see that toa 
much caution cannot be used in acquaint- 
ing him with the change in his prospects; 
and am therefore induced to entreat you 
to undertake the task, the weakened state 
of my own spirits at present, owing to 
various afflicting events, convincing me 
that I am totally inadequate to it myself.'* 

Osmond bowed. *' With delight, with 
pleasure^ Madam," he said. '' Oh what 
transport, to have the power of adminis- 
tering consolation to the afflicted mind ; 
and still more to have the power of re- 
moving the grief that rendered that con- 
solation necessary ! How amply will my 
friend be now rewarded for his past suffer- 
ings;

ings ; and how truly does he whose gene- 
rous heart prompts him to take so lively 
an interest in the fate of others^ merit the 
recom pence they'll receive/* 

-" His nature is indeed truly noble," re- 
joined the Marchesa; " and could he but 
acquire a little steadiness, he would be 
every thing his friends could wish ; as 
much their happiness as he is now their 
pride : but as long as he permits his 
feelings to triumph over his reason, he 
must continue a source of uneasiness to 
them/' 

'' Hope every thing from the restora- 
tion of his happiness; my dear Ma- 
dam/' said Osmond. " A mind despair- 
ing of the accomplishiiicnt of its wishes^ 
could scarcely be otherwise than unset- 
tled/' 

" I hope much, but not every thing, 
from it/' replied the Marchesa, with vi- 
vacity, '' since I hope a great deal from 
you. Yes^ my dear Chevalier^ from the 

high 



THE DISCARDED SON. 41 

high opinion my nephew entertains of 
you, and the influence you possess over 
him, I am persuaded you can do more to- 
wardsrendering him the perfect creature na- 
ture designed him to be, than either time or 
the change in his affairs. I rely/' she con- 
tinued, '' on your preventing any farther 
hostilities between him and the Marchese 
Salvilina, which I much fear he will feel 
an inclination to renew. When he disco- 
vers that the meditated attack upon the 
castle was intended for the purpose of 
rifling it of its richest treasure, its bright- 
est ornament, Lady Elizaraâ€”'* 

" Heavens, is it possible?" exclaimed 
Osmond. 

^' The pirate, doubtless from a hope of 
being able by such a measure to avert, if 
not entirely, at least in some degree, from 
himself the punishment he has incurred^ 
confessed all to my people. 

'^ The Marchese, convii^ced that by stra- 
tagem he should never be able to wrest 
Lady Elizara from me, determined on hav- 
ing 



42 THE DISCARDED SON, 

ing recourse to violence for t^ , purpose. 
I am sorry to say this is a country in which 
a man can never be at a loss for ready in- 
struments to execute any villainy he may 
plan. Speedily^ therefore, he met with 
such desperadoes as he wanted; meaning, 
as soon as Lady Elizara was again in his 
pov/er^ to quit the kingdom for some time 
v^ith her/' 

'' Has your Ladyship yet come to any 
determination respecting the wretches 
that have been so fortunately thrown into 
your power?'* 

'' You may be sure I think them deserv- 
ing of exemplary punishment; but am so 
sensible it cannot be inflicted on them 
without publicity being given to an afiair 
on many accounts it were better to have 
buried in oblivion^ that I believe I shall let 
them escape it. To the obligations you 
have already conferred on me. Chevalier, 
you would add bv condescending to take 
the subject into consideration;, and becom^ 
ing the arbiter of their fate yourself." 

'' With 



THE DISCARDEH SON. i^ 

** With pleasure^ Madam/' replied Os- 
mond ; "^ my having heard your Ladyship's 
sentiments will be a guide to me how to 
act/' 

'* The ship they captured is already re- 
leased/' said the Marchesa, '' and of course 
my nephew's attendant Antonio." 

Osmond expressed great pleasure at this 
circumstance ; fears of creating suspicion 
in the mind of the pirate, and thus of 
causing the overthrow of the plans he had 
been at such pains to arrange^ having pre** 
vented his interfering about him. 

After a little further conversation re- 
specting the atrocities of Salvilina, Osmond 
inquired whether Lady Elizara was then in 
tKe castle ? 

" vShc is/' replied the Marchesa ; ^^ never 
having left it since her brother committed 
her to my protection, nor never will, I 
trust, till she has resigned her present 
name." 

'' Her Ladyship knows, I presume, of the 
Count's return?" 



ii THE DISCARDED SON. 

" Yes; but is too well aware of the ne- 
cessity there is for preparing him for an 
interview with her, to appear before him 
unexpectedly : and now^ Chevalier, with 
your permission/'' added the Marchesa, 
"breakfast by this time being over, " I will 
return to him, and endeavour to argue 
him into a proper state of mind for joining 
you, and hearing the delightful intelli- 
gence you have to communicate. In the 
mean while, if disinclined to take a ramble 
about the grounds^ you'll find in an ad- 
joining apartment, books, musical instru- 
ments, and implements for writing, to 
amuse yourself with." 

*' In such a mansion as this/' respect- 
fully bowing, '' I am convinced 'tis impos- 
sible any one can be at a loss for amuse- 
ment/' rising as he spoke to open the 
door for her Ladyship,

N the Mafchesa's withdrawing:, Osmond 
quitted the saloon, impatient to take a 
nearer survey of the beautiful scenery it 
commanded. 

Immediately before it stretched a gent- 
ly-swelling and extensive lawn, covered 
with a short, soft^ thick grass of the finest 

verdure.

verdure, and diversified with detached 
groves of orangCj lemon, almond, and 
myrtle, now all in full blossom, and by the 
richness of their scents giving new sweet- 
ness to the breath of morning. On either 
side it was bounded by a steep wilderness^ 
whose hairy sides were with thickets over- 
grown, '' grotesque and wild." 

" And over-head up-grew, 

Insuperable height of loftiest shade ; 

Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palmâ€” 

A sylvan scene ; and as the ranks ascend. 

Shade above shade, a woody theatre

Than on fair evening cloud, or humid bow.**

beautiful island, and on whose transparent

terminated it; beyond which, an ample 
valley, exhibiting all the richness of culti- 
vation, was seen winding amidst vine-clad 
hills, towards a range of majestic moun- 
tains â€” here, swelling on the sight, with 
dark-green forests and intermingled vil- 
lages ; and there, fading from it into the 
softest tints of azure. 

Osmond's admiration of this sublime 
and beautiful scenery was enthusiastic. 
With eager curiosity, a bosom swelling 
with excess of pleasure, he frequently 
stopt and looked around him, as if fearful 
of passing too lightly over any part of it. 

On reaching the flowery borders of the 
lake, he again paused, in order more lei- 
surely to contemplate its various beauties. 
The bright sun-beams, refracted and ex- 
panded on its ripling waters, through which 
the snowy swan majestically sailed, had an 
enchanting effect; and naany of the clus- 
tering trees of the island, owing to the 
spray occasioned by some intercepting

rocks on its margin, appeared, when the 
sun shone on them, as if hung with the 
richest gems. 

Anxious to take a more critical survey 
of this delightful spot, Osmond stent into 
a small boat he found moored close to the 
shore, and not far from a beautifully or- 
namented vessel at anchor; and, with the 
assistance of a boat-hook, had but little 
difficulty in steering himself to the island. 
On landing, he found himself amidst the 
most luxuriant and beautiful foliage^ 
forming a succession of natural arbours 
to the centre of the island. On gaining 
this, his further progress was impeded by 
some craggy heights, bespread with wild 
thickets, and lost at each side in an ap- 
parent impenetrable mass of shade. On 
narrowly examining, he suddenly espied 
an arched chasm in one of the clilTs: 
he immediately approached it; and pass- 
ing through, found himself, to his un- 
utterable surprise, in a spacious cavern 

or 



THE DISCARDED SON. 49 

or grotto, of the most romantic appear- 
ance. 

Its roof was lofty, and composed entire- 
ly of rocks and minera, which here and 
there descending to the ground, formed 
magnificent though irregular arches em- 
bossed with creeping vegetables, and tint- 
ed with the most beautiful colours. The 
apparently incessant moisture that trickled 
down the sides,' had^ in different parts, 
collected into rills, which iell from rock 
to rock with a murmuring noise, soothing 
and delightful to the ear, and which, as . 
they broke the rays of light that crevices 
in the roof admitted, formed the most ro- 
mantic vibrations and appearances, suf- 
ficiently almost to have warmed the ima- 
gination into a belief of being in the splen- 
did palace of a fairy. 

Osmond, wondering and admiring at 
every step, proceeded through a labyrinth 
of rocks to another opening, beyond which 
he beheld a spiral staircase. Impatient to 
see all the wonders of the place, he eagerly # 
ascended this^ and found himself, on gain-

ing the last step, before the entrance of a 
noble apartment, crowned with a lofty 
dome, embellished with the finest paint- 
ings, and supported by a double row of 
white marble pillars ; the intervals between 
them alternately filled up with statues of 
the most exquisite workmanship, and 
couches covered with rose-coloured silk^ 
surmounted with pedestals of bronze, and 
antique vases filled with the richest and 
most odoriferous flowers. 

After taking a survey of this apartment, 
and its costly embellishments, Osmond 
advanced to view the scenery it command- 
ed, and descending some steps shaded by a 
projecting pediment, resting, like the roof, 
on beautiful pillars, found himself on the 
brink of a steep rock, down which a noble 
sheet of water precipitated itself into a deep 
bed beneath, through which flowed a broad 
and transparent stream to the lake. At the 
foot of the fall, alternately lost and re- 
appearing amidst the wliite foam it occa- 
sioned, was a beautiful figure of Venus, 
represented in the act of wringing her wet 

tresses- 



THE DISCARDED SON* . 5 1 

tresses over her shoulder^ as if about quit- 
ting the lucid element; and a little fur- 
ther on, but stijl so situated as, like the 
goddess on whose motions they appeared 
attending, to be continually lost to the 
view, was a group of three lovely nymphs, 
leaning on each other. 

The scenery on either side was perfectly 
appropriate : high fences of wicker-work 
extended along the edge of the stream, in- 
terwoven w^ith creeping shrubs; and be- 
yond them were dispersed bowers of roses 
and myrtle, backed by shady groves, re- 
sounding with the melody of innumerable 
birds. Such an enchanting spot altogether 
Osmond had never seen ; nor did he think 
it possible one could be found more cal- 
culated for the indulgence of that luxu- 
rious languor the climate of Italy gives 
rise to, the wanderings of the imagina- 
tion, the reveries of fancy, the waking 
dav-dreams, so delicious to taste and sen- 
sibility, than it was. 

From the contemplation of its beauties,

he was suddenly diverted by a soft strain 
of music. Restarted, 1 Jokr^d round him, 
listened attentively^ and, on a lepetition 
of the sound, conceiving it proceeded 
from the room, returned thit'ier immedi- 
ately, casting his eyes eagerly around in 
quest of the invisible musician, but with- 
out perceiving any other object than those 
which had previously met his view. Stilly, 
however, persuaded he was not mistaken, 
he examined the apartment more narrowly 
than he had before done, and at length dis- 
covered, behind one of the statues, a small 
door Dartly open, leading to another room 
of smaller dimensions, but still more taste- 
fully furnished than the outer one ; and at 
tlie furthest end of which, by an open lat- 
tice, and in such a direction as, without 
allowing her to see him, afforded him a 
perfect opportunity of seeing her, sat a 
young lady with a lute. 

Scarcely had the eyes of Osmond fallen 
on her, than every sense became absorbed 
in admiration, so beautiful an object never

before having met his enraptured gaze : 
yet it was not so much the gracefulness of 
her form, or the dazzling fairness of her 
skin, though so delicate, so clear^ that the 
meandering of her blue veins was seen as 
through a t ansparent veil ; neither the soft 
glow of her complexion, though 

** The softest bloom that Nature spreads 
Gave colour to her cheek } 

nor yet the dimple of that cheek, though 
such as painters give to Hebe; or the 
radiance of her fine blue eyes, sparkling 
through their long silken lashes, that 
charmed him so much as the ineffable 
sweetness and animated expression of her 
countenance â€” a countenance to which the 
pale auburn hair that hung in wild profu- 
sion over her brow, and cast a softening 
shade upon her lovely cheek, gave an air 
of inexpressible innocence. 

She seemed to be scarcely seventeen. 

Her dress was a robe of pale blue taffety, 

fastened at the breast by a clasp of pearls, 

and made so as to display to the greatest

S4 THE DISCARDED SON. 

advantage the symtDctry of her fine per*- 
son. Altogether she was one of those 
kind of beings that quickly awaken the 
feelings which roiize the passions into 
play. 

Although her style of beauty did not at 
all resemble that of the Italian, still Os- 
mond^ from not having heard of the Mar- 
chesa having any female relative or other 
visitor at present with her than Lady Eli- 
zara de Molina, took it for granted that it 
vas Lady Elizara whom he now saw, and 
under that persuasion could not forbear 
involuntarily exclaiming'to himself, as he 
gazed upon the lovely creature â€” '^ Happy 
Placentia ! happiest of the happy, in hav- 
ing such a being destined to thy arms 1 
'Tis well, 'tis fortunate I know thy enviable 
lot, else might my heart have yielded to 
her attractions. Have yielded !" â€” A shake 
of the head, and deep sigh, finished the 
sentence. 

In the dangerous pleasure of gazing on 
her, and listening to her delightful strains, 
Osmotid was not long indulged. In the 

course 



THE DISCARDED SON. 55 

course of a few minutes she laid aside her 
lute, quitted her seat, and;, ere Osmond 
could get to any sufficient distance from 
the door at which he had been watching 
her, to prevent a suspicion of having been 
so employed, she made her appearance in 
the outer room. 

^ She started back on beholding him, and 
for a minute remained motionless ; then^ 
again advancing, bowed slightly, in return 
to the profound obeisance he made her, 
as she glided past him, and descended to 
the grotto beneath. 

Diffidence prevented Osmond from at- 
tempting to follow her steps, as, till pro- 
perly introduced, he conceived it would 
be indecorous for him to attempt address- 
ing her; but though he had not thought 
so, still would the agitation, the confusion, 
he felt at having been surprised by her in 
such a manner have withheld him at the 
moment from making an effort for the 
purpose. 

Chancing to cast his eyes towards the

portico^, he beheld her crossing a bridge 
thrown over a narrow part of the lake, 
which now appeared so conspicuous an 
object, he was much surprised he had not 
before noticed it. As soon as the thick 
shades on the opposite shore had hid her 
from his view, the spell which fascinated 
him to the spot being broken, and the 
surprise, nay perhaps uneasiness, his longer 
absence from the palace might occasion^ 
occurring to his recollection, he repaired 
to the grotto; and being convinced, from 
the direction she had taken, that there must 
be an outlet from it to the water, examined 
narrowly, and at length succeeded in dis- 
covering a small door, opening to the left 
bank. Along this he pursued his way to 
the bridge ; but what words can paint the 
astonishment he experienced, when, on 
reaching the spot where he had seen it, 
neither bridge nor vestige of a bridge were 
visible ! 

'' Good heavens !" he involuntarily ex- 
claimed, as for a minute he became trans- 
fixed 



THE DISCARDED SON. 67 

fixed through surprise, '' is all I have seen 
then an illusion of the senses?" 

With hasty steps he measured his way 
back, impatient to have the mystery ex- 
plained. He found the boat where he had 
left it ; and leaping into it, succeeded in 
a few minutes in gaining the opposite 
shore. 

He found the Marchesa in the saloon, 
evidently awaiting his return with impa- 
tience. 

" My dear Chevalier," she cried, eagerly 
advancing to meet him, the moment he 
made his appearance, '' your friend is ex- 
pecting you in his study." 

Bowing â€” '' I will do myself the honour 
of immediately attending him," he replied. 

A servant was summoned to shew him 
the way. He found the Count seated with 
his back to the door, and apparently in a 
deep reverie. Dismissing the servant, he 
softly approached, and laid his hand upon 
his shoulder. The Count, without starting 
or evincing any emotion whatever, looked.

vip, and on perceiving who it was â€” '' Ha!'* 
in accents of the greatest calmness, '' my 
dear Munro, is that you ? Your looks/' 
attentively regarding the deeply-glowing 
cheek of Osmond, '' give me pleasure, as 
they impart to me the gratifying assurance 
of your health having sustained no injury 
from the perils and fatigues you have re- 
cently undergone.*' 

" No, thank Heaven, none whatever," 
returned Osmond. 

*' You have been taking a ramble, I un- 
derstand,** rejoined the Count. 

" Yes, an enchanting one. I v/ish you 
had accompanied me in it, as I think the 
freshness of the morning air and the beauty 
of the prospects could not have failed of 
reviving^ your spirits." 

*' My dear friend/* gravely replied the 
Count, motioning for him to take a seat be- 
side him, " I have been much better em- 
ployed ; which I am persuaded you will 
concur with me in thinking, when I inform 
you that the principal part of the morn^

THE DISCARDED SON. 59 

ing has been spent by me in endeavouring 
to collect my too long scattered ideas, and 
laying down rules for the regulation of my 
future conduct. I confess I was cruelly- 
agitated on my arrival here ; but consi- 
dering this is my first visit to the castle 
since the death of my dear and ever-to-be 
lamented uncle^ that is not a circumstance 
to be wondered at. No sooner, however, 
did I a little recover from the emotions 
thus excited in> my mind, than I resolved 
to set about the task I so faithfully pro- 
mised you to undertake, namely, that of 
trying to conquer my passions. I really am 
ashamed of having been so long the sport 
of every gale that blew. I now see clearly 
that without steadiness a man can never 
hope to support the dignity of his nature, 
or possess a chance of tranquillity. In- 
stead, therefore, of any longer beholding 
m^ like the flexile ozier, trembling and- 
agitated on every occasion, expect, in fu- 
ture, to see me like the firm rock, over 
tj 6 which.

which the tempests rave and billowrs roar^ 
without making any impression on it.*' 

" Nay^ I hope not/* returned Osmond, 
with forced gravity, but an inward smile, 
loo well acquainted with the disposition of 
the Count, not to be almost convinced that 
his present resolution would occasion no 
greater alteration in him than the many 
others of a similar nature he had formed; 
"' since the man who cannot be moved by 
the occurrences of this life, is even more 
to be pitied than he who suffers himself to 
be too greatly affected by them â€” his want 
of sensibility keeping him a stranger to a 
thousand delicious sensations." 

*' Better remain unacquainted with these 
than enjoy them at the cxpence of dignity 
and ease." 

*' hct reason only have dominion over 
sensibility; and believe me, my dear 
friend," resumed Osmond, with solemn 
earnestness, '' so far from de^radinff, it 
will ennoble our character, and render still 
more exquisite our pleasurcs^." 

3 ^' Well, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 6 1 

'' WelL when once I have got my feel- 
ings in complete subjection^ I may per- 
haps yield to it; but not till then â€” not 
till I am thoroughly convinced I can com- 
mand myself. But the period in which I 
shall be enabled to do this is not^ 1 trust, 
very far distant. Indeed;, I almost feel as 
if it were already arrived. Yes^, I cannot 
help persuading myself that I have already, 
by dint of argument^ acquired that philo- 
sophic coolness which prevents a man 
being disturbed by any circumstance. At 
all events, I am thoroughly convinced that 
there are no emotions, however violent, 
which I should not be able to conceal. 

'^ I see you are doubtful of this/' per- 
ceiving Osmond smile â€” " O Vr'ould to Hea- 
ven/' starting from his chair, and clasping 
his hands together, " something was this 
instant to occur^ to give me an opportu- 
nity of proving to you that you are too 
incredulous," 

''What!" demanded Osmond^ also ris- 
ing, conceiving he could not have a better 

opening 



62 THE DlSCARDErr SON. 

opening than the one thus afforded him 
for breaking the intelligence he had to 
communicate, '' do you think you could 
avoid appearing moved, if you heard that 
your friend the Duke de Molina was not 
mortally wounded by you ?" 

" I should certainly/' returned the Count, 
but with an air of the greatest nonchalance j 
" be pleased at the information, but nei- 
ther transported out of myself, nor yet 
extremely surprised at it; consequently 
could, without any difficulty, retain my 
composure/* 

*' Not surprised at such intelligence !" 
repeated Osmond involuntarily, and in ac- 
cents demonstrative of his being greatly, so 
himself by the assertion. 

' *^ No ; for 'tis such as for some time past 
I have thought it very likely I should yet 
receive-." 

" What ! after telling ine the Duke dropt 
lifeless at your feet !" 

" Fainting, my dear friend â€” fainting, I 
Â©nly meant," said the Count coolly. 

'' Good. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 63 

'â€¢' Good heavens !" exclaimed Osmond, 
with irrepressible emotion â€” then a little 
jnore calmly, " And did you never take any 
pains to ascertain his fate ?" 

'' My dear creature/' cried the County 
" I was so occupied in pursuit of his sister^ 
that I had neither time nor opportunity/* 

^' Well/' resumed Osmond, eager to 
communicate the joyful tidings with which 
he was charged, and also convinced, from 
what the Count had said on the subject, 
no farther preparation relative to the 
Duke de Molina was necessary, " you were 
not mistaken in your surmises of yet hav- 
ing pleasing intelligence concerning your 
Boble friend. He lives- â€” lives to renew 
his intimacy with you." 

'' And pray, my dear friend,** asked the 
Count, but without any alteration in his 
looks, or the accent in which he had just 
before spoken, ^' how came you by this 
inteilrgence ?" 

" The Marchesa was my author,** replied 
the astonished Osmond â€” astonished at the 

seeming 



64 THE DISCARDED SON; 

seeming apathy with which the Count re- 
ceived information;, which, notwitostanxl^ 
ing his being in some degree prepared for 
it, would he feared have overpowered him 
â– with joy. 

" Strange that she should not have 
imparted it to me/' somewhat thought- 
fully, resumed the Count. 

'' She feared being unable to support 
the sight of the emotions she imagined it 
would cause you.'' 

^' Ah, w^hat a convincing proof of her 
knowing nothing of the revolution that has 
taken place in my disposition V* 

A revolution, indeed, Osmond now be- 
gan to fear, and of a most unpleasant na- 
ture; else he could not possibly, he 
thought, have heard of the safety of the^ 
man for whom he professed so great a re- 
gard, the brother too of the woman he 
adored, with the indifference he had done. 
In a word, he began to thi.ik, from the 
manner in which he now conchicted himself^ 
that owing to the great fatigue of mind and 

body 



THE DISCARDED SON. 65 

body he had lately gone through, he was 
beginning to fall into a lethargic state; 
and under this idea, determined to be very 
brief with regard to Lady Elizara, conceiv- 
ing, if any thing could rouze him from 
such a dangerous one, it would be the 
tidings he had to communicate respecting 
her. 

Accordingly â€” "Well, my dear Count/' 
he proceeded, '' doubtless nothing is now 
wanting to complete your happiness, but 
an assurance of Lady Elizara's being still 
Hnmarried/' 

*' It certainly would contribute towards 
it/* replied the Count, but with the most 
perfect calmness, " since I think it impos- 
sible she could ever enjoy felicity with 
such a man as Salvilina/' 

'' And is it only on that account you 
would be pleased to hear she was not his 
bride?" 

'' Why, not altogether," quietly seating 
himself in the chair he had just before va- 
cated; '^but while I acknowledge this, per- 
mit 



()G THE DISCARDED SON. 

Tnit me also to say^ that to hear she ^vas 
free this moment would not occasion the 
slightest alteration in my manner; for 
never again will I, I am resolved^, suffer 
myself to be affected as I have heretofore 
been by joy or woe. Henceforward I am 
determined to meet with the same forti- 
tude, the same composure^ whatever may 
befal me/' 

" You may determine, but, pardon me 
for adding, I doubt much your being able 
to do so. Yes, notwithstanding your 
boasted philosophy, I cannot help think- 
ing that you could not hear of Lady Eli- 
zara being at this very moment under the 
roof with you, and not only at liberty, 
but inclined to crown without delay your 
fondest wishes, without being at least a 
little agitated/' 

'' No, no, not in the smallest degree, I 
assure you, my dear friend," leaning back 
in his chair, and jogging one foot over the 
other, with an air of the greatest indi5- 
ference. 

^' What J 



THK DISCARDED SON. 67 

'' What ! not if you were positively as- 
sured she was in the castle â€” assured that 
in another moment you might have her 
in your arms; that beloved, that faithful^ 
that divine girl, (speaking a little more 
feelingly on the subject than perhaps he 
would have done but for the incident in 
the grotto) whom you have so long doated 
on, and despaired of ever possessing?" 

'' No, no/' shaking his head ; '' and 
now, my dear friend, I trust you will no 
longer doubt my having obtained that 
command over my feelings I wished 
tor." 

'' Indeed, my dear Count, I cannot be- 
lieve it possible you could receive such 
intelligence unmoved â€” could hear that 
your Elizara was actually at this moment 
in the castle of Acerenza without emo- 
tion." 

" Ah !" with some little change of voice 
and countenance, '' I wish it was in any 
one's power to assure me she was." 

''It 



^8 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' It is in mine/' exclaimed Osmond. 

The Count started. ''Don't trifle with 
me/' he cried. 

" Heavens ! could you think it possible 
I would trifle with you on such a subject ? 
Upon my honour, my soul/' with a degree 
of vehemence he had never before spoken 
with, observing the Count still regarding 
him with a doubtful look, '' I am serious. 
She is â€” your Elizara is at this instant in 
the castle; and long ere this I make no 
doubt expected to have seen you at her 
feet.'' 

The Count heard no more. He started 
from his seat, with a precipitancy that 
caused him to overset both the celestial 
and terrestrial globe, and catching Os- 
mond in his arms, rapturously embraced 
him, as if he had mistaken him for the fair 
Elizara herself. Then starting away a few 
paces, he exclaimed â€” 



" Oh my soul's joy f 
If after every tempest comes such calm. 



Maj 



THE DISCARDRD SON. 69 

May the winds blow till they have waken'd death ; 
And let the lab*ring bark climb hills of seas 
Olympus high, and duck again as low 
As hell's trom heaven. If it were now to die, 
'Twere now to be most happy ; for I fear 
My scul has her content so absolute, 
Tliat not another comfort like to this 
Succeeds in unknown fate." 

And with these words he fiew out of the 
room, leav! .g Osmond not a little diverted 
at his expeii^^^ On the subsiding of his 
involuntary mirth â€” '' What a proof/* 
thought he, ^Moes the poor Count furnish 
of the difBculty which attends the conquest 
of any long-indulged error or propensity, 
and also of the little knowledge we in ge- 
neral have of ourselves. In vaunting of 
his strength of mind and steadiness^ under 
the firm persuasion of his possessing both^ 
he but followed the example of many of 
his fellow-beings; for how few of us are 
there who thoroughly know ourselves till 
put to the test. When no storm threatens 
â€” when no billows roar â€” when neither

70 THE DISCAKDED SON. 

dazzling sunshine, nor yet appalling 
gloom, appears â€” when all around us is 
smooth and tranquil â€” how frequently do 
we boast of our firmness, and think our- 
selves equal to any exertion ! But if the 
prospects alter â€” if proofs of this boasted 
firmness are required-^how often do we 
shrink back, and disappoint every expec- 
tation we had raised ! With what indul- 
gence, what candour, should not the con- 
sideration of this induce us to view the 
weaknesses and errors of our fellow-crea- 
turer, ! The very best among us should re- 
gard these with lenity, since even such 
cannot, except tried, assure themselves 
that they might not fall into similar ones. 
'Tis only such as have preserved their for- 
titude unshaken through all the changes of 
this life, whose principles, like the rock in 
the midst of the tumultuous billows of the 
deep, have remained firm in the midst of 
temptations, that have a right to animad- 
vert with severity on the failings and frail- 
ties of others. These, however, are the 

very 



THE DISCARDED SON. 71 

very last who would do so ; since ever in 
proportion to the rectitude of the heart, 
is the commiseration with which it views 
the erroi-s of others." 

These reflections were followed by 
others, on the happiness the Count was in 
the enjoyment of at the moment, and must 
look forward to, in a union with so anoelic 
a creature as Elizara ; and again the invo- 
luntarily sighing heart of Osmond pro- 
nounced him the happiest of the happy." 

His reflections were at length interrupt- 
e-d by the entrance of the Marchesa. She 
approached him with a joyful countenance, 
and extending her hand, which he respect- 
fully took and raised to his lips â€” '' My 
dear Chevalier,'' she said, ''' accept my 
thanks for the manner in which you have 
acquitted yourself of the task I enjoined 
you. The Count bears his unexpected 
good fortune with infinitely more compo- 
sure than I could have expected he would^ 
but doubtless owing to the manner you 
prepared him for it. Language is inade- 
quate 



72 THE DISCARDED SON. 

quate to express the obligations I consider 
myself under to you for the services you 
have rendered him and me : my actions 
will, I trust, more forcibly speak my sense 
of them.'* 

'' I must intreat your Ladyship/* cried 
Osmond, a blush of modesty suffusing his 
cheek, '' not to touch again on such a sub- 
ject. If you knew the pain it gives me, I 
feel assured you would not." 

'' You shall be obliged ; but the less I 
say the more \ shall think. I have left 
your friend at the ^t^\ of his lovely mis- 
tress, and have already dispatched a courier 
to Naples, Xo apprize the Duke de Molina 
of the return of our dear truant, and to 
request his immediate presence here." 

Osmond, supposing some time would 
elapse ere the Count would desire his com- 
pany, conceived he could not have a bet- 
ter opportunity than the present for bring- 
ing matters to a conclusion relative to the 
pirate and his crew. Accordingly, having 
previously inquired of the Marchesa whe- 
ther 



THE DISCARDED SON. 7$ 

ther she had any objection to his ttow do- 
ing so^ or her sentiments respecting these 
culprits had undergone any change since 
her former conversation about them^ he 
rang, on her replying in the negative, for 
them to be brought before him. 

They were conducted into his presence 
by some of the principal domestics of the 
castle; and as they entered at one door, 
the Marchesa, unwilling to be a spectator 
of the scene, retired at another. 

Osmond did not inform them of her 
determination, until he had expatiated for 
some time, and with much severity, on the 
offence they had meditated committino-. 
and the fatal consequences that must ine- 
vitably have resulted to them from the 
perpetration of it ; nor then, without as- 
suring them, if any circumstance hereafter 
occurred to prove that the mercy her La- 
dyship extended to them failed of touching 
their hearts with repentance, and making 
them amend their lives, the punishment 
they now escaped would to a certainty fall 

VOL. III. , E upon 



74 THE DISCARDED SON. 

upon them. They appeared contrite, and 
promised amendment; and having restored 
the articles they had extorted from him 
and the Count, were dismissed, and in a 
few minutes after, literally turned from 
the walls of Acerenza. 

Scarcely did Osmond find himself again 
alone, ere, contrary to his expectations, 
the Count, with all that breathless eager- 
ness which ever marked his air and man^ 
ner, when any thing interesting to him 
had occurred, burst into the room, for 
the purpose of conducting him to Lady 
Elizara. 

"^ She is impatient â€” she is all impa- 
tience," he exclaimed, grasping, as he 
spoke, the arm of Osmond, '' to behold 
my friend, my deliverer, my more than 
all, than eitherâ€” the preserver of her adored 
self." 

Osmond made an effort to draw back, in 
order to obtain an opportunity of inform- 
ing him that he had already seen Lady Eli- 
zara; lest otherwise, if he first received the 

information 



THE mSCARDED SOK. 75 

information of his having done so from 
her, he might make inquiries of an embar- 
rassing nature. 

Regardless of this effort, however, the 
Count hurried him on to the apartment 
where Lady Elizara expected them, and to 
which, by this time, the Marchesa had re- 
turned. 

Osmond entered it with a secret tremor, 
but the cause of which he either could not 
or. did not like to surmise. But how quick- 
ly did it vanish, when, on casting his eyes 
on Lady Elizara, he beheld in her, although 
a very lovely girl, a very different beauty 
from the one he had seen in the grotto. 
vSurprise (perhaps the sensation he expe- 
rienced at the moment deserved another 
appellation) rivetted him for a minute to 
the floor; then, recollecting himself, he 
suffered the impatient and impetuous 
Count to lead him forward. 

Lady Elizara rose on his approach, and 

with a smile of gratitude and ineffable 

sweetness, extending her hand to him, 

E 2 begged 



76 THE DlSdARDED SON^ 

begged bis acceptance of her warmest ac- 
knowledgments for the obligations he had 
conferred upon her, and (her speaking eye 
glancing at the moment, but as if involun- 
tarily, upon the Count) her friends. 

Osmond, bowing respectfully upon her 
fair hand, assured her that she rated too 
hinhlv the services alluded to ; yet at the 
same time that the hour which had given 
to him the happiness of rendering such, 
would ever be hallowed in his remem- 
brance. 

*' Oh ! my Elizara," cried the enraptured 
Count, placing himself beside her, and 
gently circling her waist with his arm, on * 
her resuming her seat, '^ my heart seems as 
if it would burst with the fulness of its joy. 
Nothing â€” nothing but the presence of your 
brother, and the performance of the cere- 
mony that secures you mine, is now want- 
ing to render me the happiest being under 
the canopy of heaven. That over, and,** 
suddenly starting up, " I will let loose the 
dogs of war, and with wings as swift as 

meditation. 



TilE DISCARDED SOiT. 77 

meditation, or the thoughts of love, sweep 
to my revenge. Yes, the perfidious Sal- 
vilina shall then experience my vengeance 
â€” shall then know that a spirit like mine is 
not to be insulted or wronged with impu- 
nity." 

The Marchesa and Lady Elizara both 
looked alarmed at this deeiaration. The 
Litter, however^ better concealing her fears 
than the former â€” " I am glad I know your 
determination in time, Count," cried she, 
with a laughing air; '' for as I have no de- 
sire to play the part of a widowed bride, 
I am resolved, except you faithfully pro- 
mise not to do any thing likely to en- 
danger your safety till I have told you I 
am tired of you, which Heaven knows may 
be much sooner than you are aware of, not 
to change my present state.*' 

'^ You are right, perfectly right. Lady 
Elizara, in forming such a resolution," said 
the Marchesa ; " and I will uphold you in 
it with all my heart." 

^'Assuredly," cried Osmond, ''every one 
E 3 must 



78 THE DISCARDED SON. 

must concur with your Ladyship in think- 
ing so/' 

'"^What!" most impatiently demanded 
the Count, " agree in thinking that I de- 
serve to have my happiness retarded, ex- 
cept I give up my revenge V 

'' My dear Count/' proceeded Osmond^ 
rising, and laying his hand on his arm, 
" believe me, as one of our most sublime 
poets has said â€” 

** RevengÂ«, tho' sweet at first, 
Bitter ere long, back on itselt reoMls." 

'' But. to let 3uch a villain escape un- 
punished V thoughtfully rejoined the 
Count. 

'' He will notâ€” be assured he will not, 
my dear Count/' cried Osmond, with 
energy ; '' the goadings of his own con- 
science will not suffer him to do so." 

*' But when the wrongs I have received 
at his hand are known, what will the world 
say to my forbearance ?'* 

'' That 



THE DISCARDED SON. 79 

*' That by practising such, you evinced 
a noble mind; since it certainly requires 
a much less effort to resent than forgive 
our injuries." 

'* You must indeed, my dear nephew/' 
said the Marchesa, also leaving her chair, 
and approaching him, '' pass over the con- 
duct of Salvilina in silence, if you wish to 
make me any amends for all I have lately 
suffered on your account." 

" Yes, and instantly make a promise to 
that ef!ect," added Lady Elizara, with an air 
of the most playful gaiety, and a bewitch- 
ing smile, '* or I immediately retract the 
concessions I have made in your favour." 

The Count cast a half-smiling, half- 
reproachfiil look at her at these words: 
then, after a little further hesitation â€” 
*^ Well, I am conquered," cried he ; '' I 
submit : who can resist the pleadings of 
those they love ?" 

A desultory and agreeable conversation 

of some length followed this amicable ad- 

E 4 justment 



so *THE DISCARDED SO>J*. 

justment relative to Salvilina; after which 
the party broke up to dress for dinner. 

Impatient to relate the incident of the 
grotto, Osmond attended the Count to his 
dressing-room, for the purpose of reveal- 
ing it to him. 

The Count listened to him with the most 
profound attention. On his concluding â€” 
" So very handsome, say you }" cried he. 
" I really/' with thoughtfulness, '' cannot 
surmise who she is; but probably some 
visitor of my aunt's, who, finding how she 
was engaged this morning, repaired to 
the island, in order to avoid being any re- 
straint upon her.'* 

'' Should it prove so, then," said Os- 
mond eagerly, and with a flushing cheek, 
" we are likely to see her at dinner." 

" Certainly ; but should we not, depend 
upon it your curiosity respecting her shall 
not long remain ungratified, as I shall take 
care to inquire of my aunt about her. As 
to the bridge, which gave you such asto- 
nishment.

nishmentj it is the ingenious contrivance 
of the Marchesa ; and turning on a pivot, 
can, with the greatest ease imaginable^ be 
thrown from the island^ across the lake^ to 
which, by touching a spring, it immedi- 
ately flies back to its shelter, amidst tufts 
of low trees and bushes, that completely 
hide it from casual observation. By being 
able to set it aside in this manner, the ap- 
pearance of the island is rendered still more 
romantic, and an opportunity afforded of 
sailing entirely round it." 

" It does honour to her Ladyship's taste 
and ingenuity/' observed Osmond, '' and 
renders still more delightful the charming 
spot we have been speaking of, by giving 
an air of enchantment to it.'' 

As soon as Osmond had finished dress- 
ing, he repaired to the chamber of the 
Count, who immediately attended him 
thence to the saloon, where, besides the 
Marchesa and her lovely young friend^ - 
they found a large party assembled, in â€¢ 
E -5. honour* 



S2 THE DISCARDED SON. 

hDnoiir of his Lordship's arrival, of which 
early intimation that day had been given 
throughout the neighbourhood. 

To these friends, as soon as they had 
pfaid their congratulatory compliments, 
Osmond was introduced, in a manner that 
ensured him the most gracious reception. 

There were several pretty women pre- 
sent ; and in the course of a few minutes^ 
the Count found an opportunity of in- 
quiring of Osmond by a glance, whether 
his fair incognito was amongst the number 
of these? to which inquiry the other re- 
plied by a significant shake of the head. 

To all the refinements of modern lux- 
ury, such as Osmond had witnessed in the 
mansion of Lord O'Sinister, was here uni- 
ted a degree of princely magnificence^ 
i^hich heightened the effect these refine- 
rfients were calculated to have upon the

But neither produced such an effect 

upon the mind of Osmond as the winning

manners of his noble hostess, and the not 
less conciliating deportment of the other 
members of her family. 

The Marchesa Morati, although at this 
period somewhat advanced in the autumn 
of her days, still retained vestiges of supe- 
rior beauty; but though she had not pos- 
sessed a trace of this, still v/ould she have 
been a fascinating object, from the soft- 
ness and urbanity of her manners, the dig- 
nity of her air, the elegance of her move- 
ments, the wish she on every occasion 
manifested to promote the happiness of 
others, and the sense and spirit which 
marked her conversation, and proclaimed 
her understanding and accomplishments of 
the first rare. At this juncture, she was 
rendered still more interesting by the pen- 
sive cast which grief for her beloved lord 
had given to her features, and w^hich evi- 
dently firoved that the cheerfulness she at 
present displayed was not the result of 
inclination, but assumed for the purpose

of rendering still more perfect the felicity 
of her nephew and his fair mistress. 

To the playful vivacity and amiable in- 
genuousness of youth, the latter added all 
those winning graces that spring from cul- 
ture and refinement. Her beauty, of the 
true Italian kind, was highly attractive ; 
her persoa was tall, and strikingly elegant ;. 
her face a fine oval ; her complexion dark,, 
but clear, and made to appear still more 
delicate by the contrasting darkness of her 
luxuriant hair; her eyes were black, large, 
sparkling, and so expressive, that language 
was scarcely necessary to explain her mean- 
ing. In a word, she was altogether so be- 
witching an object, as fully to justify, in 
the opinion <:S Osmond, the adoration with 
which the Count regarded her.. 

Not inferior to the admiration and 
esteem with which he regarded her and 
her noble friend, was that which they ex- 
perienced for him. The fine openness of 
his countenance, its candour and sweetness^ 

the 



THE DISCARDED SON. 85 

the easy elegance of his figure, the unstu- 
died gracefulness of his manner, the per- 
suasive eloquence with which he delivered 
his sentiments, the pleasingly-modulated 
tones of his voice â€” all excited an imme- 
diate prepossession in their minds in his 
favour, such as would have insured to him 
their notice and attentions, even though 
he had not been introduced to them as he 
was, under the character of a preserver. 

During dinner, the conversation was ge- 
neral, and of the most animated descrip- 
tion ; but even if it had been less so, Os- 
mond would still have found sufficient in 
the costly embellishments of the banquet- 
ting-room, and the varied and extensive 
prospect ils long range of lofty lattices, 
now all thrown open to admit the air, com- 
manded, to have amused and engaged his 
attention. 

Immediately before them extended a 
spacious and delicious flower-garden, with 
several beautiful fountains adorned with 

fiofure^

figures of the finest marble^ and cooling" 
and embalming the air with their silvery 
waters; and further on a vast tract of 
country, finely diversified, and enlivened 
with flocks and herds, and scattered cot- 
tages, half shrouded by the luxuriance of 
the foliage, amidst which they reared their 
humble heads, and which here and there 
admitted partial views' of the sea, reflecting 
all the glittering glories of the sun; the 
whole bounded by aspiring mountains, 
gradually receding and fadiing into the 
mist of distance. 

After dinner the company became scat- 
tered, every one amusing themselves ac- 
cording to their respective inclinations.. 
Some sat down to cards in the saloon; and 
others, in detached parties, dispersed them- 
selves over the gardens, which, as evening 
advanced, were splendidly illuminated, and 
furnished with music and refreshments. 

Osmond, in the course of the evening, 
found an opportunity of detaching the 

Gount: 



THE DISCARDED SON. 87 

Count for a few minutes from the rest of 
the party. 

" Well, my dear Count/' he anxiously 
cried, on drawing him aside, '' well (look- 
ing at him with an air of impatience), have 

you inquired " 

/^ About the fair stranger â€” yes, but tc>- 
no purpose. Both my aunt and Lady Eli- 
zara plead ignorance concerning her. I 
am, therefore, inclined to believe her, from 
this circumstance, neither more nor less 
than a pretty little fcmme de cJianibrc be- 
longing to the castle.''" 

" No, no,'' hastily exclaimed Osmond, 
*' 'tis impossible. Her look, her air, her 
dress, her appearance altogether, permit 
me not to harbour a doubt of her being 
of superior rank." 

" Strange ! then who can she be ?" re- 
turned the Count, with a musing nir. Then, 
after a pause of a minute â€” '' I shall inquire 
in another quarter to-morrow, and flatter 
myself with being more successful." 

Osmond was highly pleased with this 

assurance. 



88 THE DISCARDED SON. 

assurance. '' And yet why should I be so 
anxious to discover her?" he cried to 
himself; " why stimulate enquiries that 
can obtain for me nothing but an idle gra- 
tification ? since, whether she be married 
or unmarried, titled or untitled, portioned 
or portionless, I am equally interdicted bj 
my situation from thinking of her.'* 

Still, however, notwithstanding this re- 
flection, he could not help continuing to 
w'ish to learn who she was. 

His impatience to gratify the curiosity 
awakened in his mind by the description., 
he had received of the scenes surrounding 
the abode of which he had so unexpect- 
edly become an inmate, was too great, and 
the impression made by recent occurrences 
still too lively, to permit of his remaining, 
long in an inactive state. 

At an early hour the next morning, he^ 
forsook his couch ; and finding, on quit- 
ting his chamber, that the family were not 
yet up, sallied forth. 

Involuntarily, perliaps^ he bent his steps 

towards ^ 



tHE CISCAHDED SON. S^ 

towards the grove which the preceding 
day had hid the lovely stranger from his 
view ; and through its verdant mazes was 
pursuing his way to the island, -when^ 
chancing to cast his eyes around him^ he 
beheld her reading upon a moss-covered 
bank, overshadowed with flowering tim- 
brage.

but quickly recovered the power of mo-

stranger.

but not without a little hesitation, as if 
somewhat flurried, and a deepening blush 
upon her lovely cheek, over which her fair 
hair lightly fluttered, '' 'twas the suddenness 
with which you appeared that made me 
appear as if you had done so," 

'' For having been the occasion of any 
disturbance to you, permit me. Madam/* 
cried Osmond, in the most respectful ac- 
cent, his dark and eloquently-expressive 
eyes beaming with admiration, ^* to entreat 
your forgiveness/* 

" You have it, vSir, They must have a 
strange temper indeed, who could not rea- 
dily pardon what was not intentional." 

*' My intrusion was certainly not in- 
tentional ; but â€” but â€” truth obliges me 
to declare" â€” and as he spoke he stole a 
glance, half timid, half ex pres&ive of the feel- 
ings she had inspired him with, at her, ^' that 
on my entering the grove, had I known it 
concealed you, I could not have forborne 
seeking the spot."

at the idea of his having offended her by 
^vhat he had just said^ '' let me not, I con- 
jure you, Madam^ be the means of driving 
you hence/^ 

'' You are not, ^Sir ; I was thinking of 
going ju^it as you appeared." 

The heart of Osmond throbbed with 
hope. She was probably then returning 
home; and even if she did not permit him 
to attach himself to her side, still at a dis- 
tance, he reflected, he could watch her 
steps, and thus by obtaining a knowledge 
of her residence, readily learn, he con- 
ceived, her name and situation.. 

But to his inexpressible disappointment, 
on evincing an intention of pursuing the 
same path she had taken, she suddenly 
stopt, and turning towards him, entreated 
him not to attempt following her. 

Osmond^ 



THE DISCARDED SON, 93 

Osmond, utterly disconcerted by this re- 
quest, since, besides the pleasing expec- 
tations it obliged him to give up, he knew 
not whether or not to attribute it to an 
idea of his being presumptuous, remained 
for a moment silent and motionless. 

'' To oblige you. Madam," he then said, 
" I know of no mortification to which I 
would not submit. Rest assured, there- 
fore, your wishes shall be obeyed.*' But 
a little recovering from the confusion into 
which she had thrown himâ€”'' As some little 
recompence for my ready acquiescence to 
them, will you suffer me to ask whether, 
at some future and not very remote pe- 
riod, I may not indulge a hope of again 
seeing you â€” whether the woods of Ace- 
renza are alone honoured with your visits 
â€” its palace not sometimes graced by your 
presence ?" 

The fair stranger bowed. '' I do not 
look forward to the happiness of being 
geen there,*' she replied ; *' and â€” â€” ** 

What 



94 THE Discarded son. 

What further she meant to say was here 
prevented by the voice of a man suddenly 
calling upon her from an adjacent thicket, 
by the name of Cordelia. 

She started, changed colour, looked at 
once alarmed and confused ; and as she 
hurried forward, motioned Osmond by her 
hand to the forbearance she had previously 
enjoined him. 

Accordingly, with his eyes he only pur- 
sued her, the modesty and sensibility of 
his nature being too great to permit him 
to do any thing that could make him ap- 
pear intrusive, or occasion pain to ano- 
ther. 

Yet never had he found any impulse so 
difficult to resist as that which had urged 
him to trace her flying steps. The im- 
pression which her beauty had previously 
made upon him was this day strengthened 
by the harmony of her accents, the sweet- 
ness and complacency of her manners. 
But if her voice dwelt upon his ear, so also 

did 



THE DISCARDED SON. 95 

did the unwelcome one which had so sud- 
denly, so roughly, and evidently so unex- 
pectedlyj called her away : and equal to 
his wish to learn who she was,, was the one 
he experienced, to know what relationship 
or connection subsisted between her and 
the person from whom it proceeded. 

At length, starting from the reverie into 
which she had plunged him, he returned 
to the spot where he had surprised her; 
and throwing himself upon the turf she 
had pressed, resigned himself for some 
minutes to the inward contemplation of 
her charms, during which he more than 
once repeated her name â€” the name of 
Cordelia^ which, to his ear at least, had 
music in it. Then, in order to try and 
give a turn to his thoughts, the indulgence 
of which he was convinced could not fail 
of entailing pain upon him, he took out 
his pocket-book and pencil, and committed 
to paper the ideas suggested by a very 
fanciful dream of the preceding night, in 

which

which the fair stranger was represented' as 
a sovereign princess^ driven from her pos- 
session in a neighbouring state by a 
cruel usurpation, which, after going 
through unheard of dangers, he had the 
good fortune to overthrow, and was re- 
warded for his services with her hand. The 
following was his

With joys that mock me as they fly.

That riots in each vein. 

At least with Reason share the sway.

Permit her government by day. 

And yours shall be the night.

The seraph's song of praise. 
The music of the moving spheres. 

In fair Cordelia's lays. 

Lead where the fays and fairies dance. 

By moonlight on the green ; 
Or where Diana holds her court. 

Amid the sylvan scene.

With variegated blooms ; 
And sportive zephyrs waft around 

Their exquisite perfumes,

The encreasing heat at length remind- 
ing Osmond of the lateness of the hour, 
he returned to the castle ; and finding the 
family were already assembled at break- 
fastj hastened to the saloon^ where^ besides 
those he expected to see, he found several 
of the guests of the preceding day. 

As soon as breakfast was over, a sio^nifi- 
cant glance from Osmond induced the 
Count to conduct him to his study, where, 
as soon as they entered, Osmond recount- 
ed the incident of the morning. 

When he had ceased speaking â€” ^' The 
person of whom I meant to inquire con- 
cerning your mysterious divinity," cried 
the Count, " is a young man of the name 
of Mactalla, a domestic in the castle, and 
the son of an Irishman, who served during 
the late monarchy as a soldier in the Irish 
brigades in France, and who, in that situa- 
tion, having had an opportunity of render- 
ing a signal service to my uncle, the Mar- 
chese Morati, who, disliking a life of total 
F 2 indolence. 



100 THE DISCARDED EON. 

indolence, also served in one of these for 
some time, had his discharge obtained, and 
was brought to Acerenza, where he conti- 
nued till his death, leaving his son, who 
was also his companion hither, to the pro- 
tection of his generous patrons. The 
young man has proved himself fully de- 
serving of their kindness ; and beside be- 
ing faithful, sincere, and affectionate, is 
shrewd, smart, and lively, in a word, every 
way qualified to make discoveries of the 
nature you are now anxious for; and 
therefore I resolved, from my conviction 
of this, to apply to him on the subject, 
when I found I could obtain no satisfac- 
tion from the Marchesa or Lady Eli- 
zara.'* 

'' I presume. Count," said Osmond, smi- 
ling a little archly, '*^he has given you un- 
questionable proofs of his cleverness in the 
way you allude to.'* 

" O no, no, upon my honour," returned 
the Count; " for you know, my dear crea- 
turCj I was always in love." 

'' And 



fHE DISCARDED SON. 10 1 

'' And therefore did I advance such a 
supposition. ' 

*' But I mean/' returned the Count, a 
little confusedly, '' with only one object/' 

Osmond again smiled, perhaps a little 
incredulously ; and the Count rang for 
Mr. Mactalla, who, in a few minutes, made 
hi ^ appearance, and presented to the view 
of Osmond the figure of a tall slight young 
man, about four or five-and-twenty, and 
with a ccuntenance replete with vivacity, 
good nature, and good humour. 

The Count, at the request of Osmond, 
entered into no very minute particulars 
respecting the fair stranger; but merely 
said his curiosity had been excited by the 
appearance of such a person near the 
castle, and that he much wished if he 
(Mactalla) did not already know who she 
was, he would endeavour to discover. 

Mactalla, after musing for some minutes 

â€¢ â€” *' I have it," cried he, suddenly striking 

his hand on his forehead, " I have it, by 

the Powers/' in accents of delight, and 

F 3 filliping 



102 THE DISCARDED SON. 

filliping his fingers; " I can guess wha 
she is â€” yes, yes, 'tis plain enough." 

''Indeed! Pray who is she then?" de- 
manded the Count, scme^.vhat impatiently. 

*' Why your Lordship can't have forgot 
your surly neighbour, Signor Trapanti." 

" No, the unsocial being. But what of 
him ? what has he to say to the young lady 
in question?" 

'' She is his niece, I am persuaded." 

" His niece !" echoed the Count. 

*' Yes, I am certain she is. Thinking his 
servants did not pay him proper attention, 
and beside that they took advantage of his 
frequent illnesses to plunder him, he lately 
fetched from Naples the destitute orphan 
daughter of a brother of his, for the pur- 
pase of nursing him, and having an eye 
to matters when he is not able himself; 
and findffig her attentions to him and 
his concerns not only pleasing but ser- 
viceable, is unwilling to let her quit the 
house for a minute, except in his com- 
pany, lest she should meet with something 

that 



THE DISCARDED SON. 103 

that might induce her to leave him entire- 
ly. Spite of all his watchings, however, she 
sometimes contrives to make her escape into 
these groundsj but always with fear and 
trembling, as more than once her steps 
have been traced by him." 

'' And prithee where didst thou pick 
up all this intelligence ?" 

** From very good authority, please your 
Lordship â€” from a young damsel belonging 
to his family/' 

" And amongst the other things she told 
thee, did she mention the name of the 
young lady ?'* 

^' No, Signor, no; but described her as 
a very angel." 

" Yes, yes, it must be her," cried the 
Count, in an inward voice. Then again 
addressing Mactalla â€” '' Lq\ horses be got 
ready for the Chevalier and me immedi- 
ately, and do you hold yourself in readi- 
ness to attend us. I am resolved on beat- 
ing up the quarters of Signor Trapanti 
F 4 this 



104 THE DISCARDED SON, 

this morning, if for no other purpose for 
that of plaguing him for his sins/* 

The moment Mactalla ^.vithdrew to exe- 
cute the orders of the Count, Osmond^ who 
till then had pretended to be employed in 
looking over the books, hastily approach- 
ed the Count â€” '' And pray who is this 
Signor Trapanti?" eagerly burst from his 
lips. 

** An old superannuated rake, who^ hav- 
ing no longer power to follow his vicious 
propensities, has turned misanthrope, and 
now rails at what he formerly pursued. 
His domain adjoins this, and his fortune is 
extremely large, and every year encreas- 
ing, as he is now as miserly as he was for- 
merly profuse, insomuch that for some 
time past he has declined mixing in so- 
ciety." 

"Should he suspect the motive of the 
visit you are about paying him, may he 
not,'* said Osmond, in a hesitating accent, 
*' be tempted to confine more strictly his 

lovely 



THE DISCARDED SON. 105- 

lovely niecCj and thus render still more 
unhappy her situ-ation?*' 

'' We must manage matters in such a 
way as to prevent his having a suspicion 
of the kind. While you entertain the 
niece, lil contrive to keep him employed/* 

'' Ah; my dear Count/' rejoined Osmond 
with a sigh, '' why should I attempt to 
pursue an object I can never hope to pos- 
sess ? My situation totally precludes my 
entertaining one of the kind. Would it 
not, therefore, be better for me not to â€” '* 

'"Stuff! stuff!" impatiently interrupted 
the Count; " I will not suffer you to pro- 
ceed in such a strain. On going this morn- 
ing.toSignor Trapanti's Fam positively de- 
termined, and equally determined that you 
shall accompany me: not another vvord^ 
therefore, on the subject..''

k E are easily persuaded to do what we

his scruples by the e.Tort he had made to 
excuse himself from going whither his 
he^rt had already travelled (for that the

and the horses being announced at the 
moment, they directly monntedj and set 
forward, attended bv Mactalla. 

Their ride was through delightful groves> 
along the banks of purling streams, so 
bespread with flowers, that it seemed as if 
Flora herself had just been wandering 
along them. " A verdurous wall" hid the 
dwelling of Signor Trapanti from casual 
observation. On penetrating this, Osmond 
beheld a spacious structure, but which^ 
from the alterations suspicion and spleen 
had caused the owner to make in it, infinite- 
ly more resembled the baronial residence 
of a chief of old, than the light and airy 
structures of the Italians. 

As Osmond's eyes wandered over the 
gloomy abode, he involuntarily but silent- 
ly exclaimed to himself â€” '' Fit dwelling, 
indeed, fop misanthropy ; but ah, how un- 
fit a one for youth, for beauty, for sensi- 
bility!'' 

'' I apprize you in time," said the Count, 

while Mactalla was knocking at the gate, 

F G '' that

'Mhat we are likely to be refused admis- 
sion here; but having once commenced 
the siege, I am resolved on no account to 
raise it, without bringing the governor to 
comply with my wishes." 

" Surely if once denied admission, you 
don't mean to persevere in demanding 
it?*' 

" Indeed but I do. Patience and per- 
severance are not quite such great stran- 
gers to me as you may imagine.'* 

An old withered porter, nearly with age 
grown double, but still with something 
facetious in his countenance, answered 
Mactalla's summons ; and on learning the 
occasion of it, positively declared his mas- 
ter was from home. 

- " Come hither. Sir," said the County 
beckoning to him. On his obeying â€” 
" Can you look me in the face," he added, 
*' and repeat that assertion ?'* 

'' Yes, upon my veracity, my Lord, can 
I," bowing profoundly low ; *' the Signor

lawyer in Acerenza, on business of great

" Signor Thomaso I ah, I know him well 
â€” as great a rogue as the- profession was.

in a law-suit ; he took fees on both sides, 
and cheated me most horridly. I'H follow 
your master to his house, and if I don't find 
him there, or that he has been there, woe 
be to you, old Cerberus.'' 

Osmond, appreheni^ive that their pursu- 
ing Signor Trapanti might be the means 
af involving the lovely niece in some un- 
pleasant predicament, earnestly endeavour- 
ed, as soon as they had turned their backs- 
on his mansion, to dissuade the Count from 
such a measure, but to no purpose; he per- 
sisted in riding on towards Ace renza, but was 
prevented entering it, by meeting the car- 
riage of Signor Trapanti some little distance 
from it, into which, on discovering whose it 
was, the eyes of Osmond instantly darted; 
but instead of beholding the face that had

young lady who occupied a seat in it^ one 
he had never before seen. 

'^ Upon my honour, my dear fellow,'' 
cried the Count, on learning his disap- 
pointment, " I am almost inclined to be- 
lieve that it is an ideal being you have been 
speaking of all this time/' 

*' I wish you could make me think so.** 

" Well, well, we'll endeavour to prove 
whether 'tis so or not. Mactalla shall im- 
mediately be set to work." 

'' No, no," cried Osmond, but so faintly, 
that the Count plainly saw his opposition 
to the measure was but affected ^' At all 
evenfs," added he, " don't, I conjure you, 
mention the aiiair to the Marchesa or Lady 
Elizara ; for I should be very unwilling ta 
appear ridiculous in their eyes." 

'' O rely on my secrecy ; but at the same 
time permit me to observe, that your ad- 
miration of one beautiful woman could 
never make you appear ridiculous in the 
eyes of another.'*

This clay, as on the preceding one, a 
splendid party dined at the castle, and in 
the evening there was a grand display of 
fire-works on the lake ; after which music 
and dancing filled up the principal part of 
the night. 

The Count had earnestly entreated that 
his nuptials might immediately take place; 
but a conviction of the impropriety of 
such a measure, and the likelihood there 
was of its giving offence to the Duke de 
Molina, made the Marchesa^ and of course 
Lady Elizara, deaf to all his solicitations on 
the subject. 

To fill up the interval of expectation in 
such a manner as should somewhat beguile 
it of its tediousness to him^ the Marchesa 
contrived a constant succession of amuse- 
ments at the castle. For an instant, these 
never rendered Osmond forgetful of the 
fair and mysterious stranger. In defiance 
of prudence, and the arguments of rea- 
son, he still continued to dwell on her 
idea, and haunt the spots where he thought

there was the greatest probability of meet- 
ing her, but to no purpose. Day after day 
wore away without seeing her again ; nor 
was Mactalla, as he learnt from the Counts- 
more successful in his researches after her. 

At length the Duke de Molina arrived^ 
and the morning after his lovely sister and 
her amiable lover were united in the cha- 
pel of tlie castle, and in the presence of 
a number of distinguished friends and re- 
latives. From the chapel they returned 
in procession to the grand saloon, where 
a numerous assemblage waited to offer 
their congratulations, and participate in 
the festivities of the day. Nothing could 
exceed the splendor and gaiety displayed- 
on this occasion. 

Ere the congratulations which this joy- 
ful event gave rise to w^ere well over, 
die Marchesa drew Osmond aside, and in- 
sisted, in order, she said, to keep alive the 
remembrance of it in his mind, and of 
course his wishes for the continuance of 
the happiness it occasioned, on his accep- 
tance

tance of a ring of considerable value, and 
a cabinet filled with precious antiques; 
after which the Count, with a positive 
threat of demolishing both, if not instantly 
taken by him, presented hrm with a gold 
box, enriched with diamonds, and contain- 
ing his picture, and a highly ornamented 
and valuable watch and cliain. 

Osmond felt almost averpowered by the 
generosity and kindness of these noble 
friends; he tl^>ught they rated too highly 
their obli"ations to him : but at the same 
time, their having done sa, by still further 
convrncing him of the nobleness of their 
natures, heightened his regard and esteem 
for them. 

Towards the decline of this joyful day, 
either owing to the languor over-fatigued 
spirits is apt to create, or to the pleasure 
he derived from sometimes having an un- 
interrupted opportunity of indulging his 
reflections, Osmond gradually detached 
himself from the gay and brilliant crowd 

that 



I 1 4 THE DISCARDElJ SON. 

that filled the palace and gardens of AcC"- 
renza^ and wandered away to an undulating 
valley, shrouded by thick aspiring woods, 
and refreshed by a clear and wildly-devious 
vStream. The delightful contrast which its 
tranquillity formed to the noise and bustle 
he had just leftâ€” no sound meeting the ear 
save the faint rustling of the trees^ and the 
warbling of the bird^ that thronged them, 
together with the mugnificenca of the 
scene, tinted as it was wiÂ«i the crimson 
blush of evening, the warm glow whicli 
the setting sun pours over creation â€” ^ 
awakened a soothing, a luxurious pleasure 
in the mind of Osmond â€” that serene de- 
light, that ineffable feeling of benevolence, 
*^ the parent of disinterested good will to 
ethers/* which the view of smiling nature 
never ftiils of exciting in a heart of sensi- 
bility. 

'' Of him v^ho could unmoved behold 
such a scene as this/' cried Osmond, his 
eyes delightedly roving over it, *^ with 

justice 



THE DISCARDED SON. 1 1 5 

justice it might be said â€” he's fit for trea- 
sons, stratagems, and spoils; let no such 
man be trusted/' 

As he pursued his walk and his reflec- 
tions together, his attention was suddenly 
caught by a beautiful green mount, ma- 
jestically rising above the surrounding 
shades, and crowned with an open temple 
of white marble, covered with a dome of 
the same, supported by light pillirs. Os- 
mond, concluding from the elevation of 
this building^ it must command an enchant- 
ing prospect, eagerly ascended to it; but 
scarcely had he reached it, ere every sense 
became absorbed in surprise and admira* 
tion, at beholding on the opposite side, a 
few paces below it, seated like a mountain 
nymph upon a tufted sod, her shining 
tresses merely prevented from streaming 
in the light breeze that blew around her 
by a chaplet of wild flowers, her robe 
white and fluttering, and warm on her 
cheek the sultry season glowing, the love- 
ly stranger. 

He

He might perhaps have continued houfs 
rivetted to the spot, had not the accidental 
turning of her head discovered him to her, 
and thus broke the spell that bound him. 

On perceiving her rise hastily, as if with 
an intention of* retreating, he darted for- 
Vv-ard, and throwing himself before her â€” 
" Oh do not/' he cried^ in accents at once 
supplicating and impassioned, unable to 
resist the impulse of his feelings, '^ do not 
]et me be the means of still frightening 
you away. If you knew how restlessly, 
how ardently I have sought for such a 
minute as the present, you would not, I 
flatter myself, think of shortening it." 

He paused, in eager expectation of a 
reply. In vain, however, he looked for 
one. She spoke not, neither did she at- 
tempt to move; yet that something she 
wished to say, was evident from the ex- 
pression of her countenance. 

" Oh say,'* resumed the impetuous youth, 
agitated by this silence beyond the power 

of 



â€¢THE DISCARDED SON. 117 

of controlling his emotions^ " how am I 

to interpret this silence ? Am I to " 

A loud hollo from the other side of the 
temple prevented his finishing this speech, 
and put the fair stranger to flight. He 
pursued her, perhaps involuntarily, and 
not without a wrathful invective against 
the person, whoever he was, that had driven 
her away ; but ere he had got many yards 
in the tangled path into which she had 
darted, his cloaths got entangled in a bush 
of prickly shrubs, which his impetuosity 
made him overlook and stumble amongst ; 
and before he could extricate himself, the 
person whose voice had occasioned all 
this confusion made his appearance, and 
presented to the view of Osmond the fea- 
tures of one of the guests of Acerenza â€” 
an elderly gentleman of the name of Be- 
lermo, who set up for a great physiogno- 
mist; and in order to make his talent 
known^ and thus obtain for himself some 
little distinction, such as he was conscious, 
without making an eflbrt for the purpose,

he should vainly hope for, tormented 
every one with his observations. The 
high estimation in which he found Os- 
mond w^as held at the palace of Ace- 
renza, induced him to believe, if he could 
impress him with an opinion of his clever- 
ness, he should reap some advantage from 
the circumstance ; he therefore attached 
himself to him as much as possible through- 
out the day ; and for the purpose of fol- 
lowing up his plan respecting him, traced 
his steps. 

'' Ah, my dear young friend,'* he ex- 
claimed, '' how much does your having 
stolen away from the madding crowd with- 
in, convince me that you are the young 
philosopher your countenance led me to 
believe V 

*' Philosopher, Sir !*' repeated Osmond, 
perhaps a little sternly, doubtful at first 
whether he was not laughing at him ; but 
on looking earnestly in his face perceiv- 
ing that he really was not â€” '' upon my word. 
Sir, you confer a title on me to which I 
make no pretensions." 

''And 



THE DISCARDED SON. 1 I 9 

*' And therefore do you merit it. Yes, 
your unassuming manners, your abstracted 
air, the indifference in which, to judge 
from your looks, you hold the pomps and 
vanities of this world â€” all confirm your 
right to the title; a title which any one 
who is at all a physiognomist will at the 
first glance bestow upon you; but never 
yet indeed was I mistaken in the judg- 
ments I formed from the countenance; 

never yet -" 

^' Some other time. Sir,'' cried Osmond, 
but not w^ithout a difficultly-suppressed 
laugh at this curious original, **" some other 
time,'' tearing away, as he spoke, his coat 
from the briars, '" I shall be happy to at- 
tend you, but at present I have an engage- 
ment elsewhere." 

" Nay, if it be to meditate on the beau- 
ties of nature, permit me to accompany 
you." 

'^ You do me honour. Sir, by the re- 
quest," returned Osmond, no longer able 
to smother his laughter; '' but" â€” then not 

knowing 



1^0 THE DISCARDED SON. 

knowing what to say, he stopt abruptly, 
and kissing his hand to him, vanished in a 
moment from his view. 

In vain, however, he hurried down the 
path the fair stranger had taken â€” in vain 
explored every neighbouring bush and 
thicket â€” she was no where to be seen, nei- 
ther any habitation to which she could 
have retreated ; and at length he reluc- 
tantly ceased his pursuit of her for the 
present. 

The idea that he should in all probabi- 
lity have discovered where she lived, and. 
so have been enabled to learn who she 
was, but for the intrusion of Signor Be- 
lermo, so irritated him, that had he en- 
countered him again at the moment, he 
would probably have given him some rea- 
son to retract his assertion of his being a 
philosopher. 

But as reflection resumed its empire over 
him, all his anger was turned against him- 
self. With confusion and remorse he 
thought of his conduct ; his having dared, 

situated 



THE DISCARDED 30K. I2l 

situated as he was, lo breathe a sentiment 
of tenderness, or evince a wish to inspire 
one. 

Osmond was not of a disposition wilfully 
fo indulge in what be conceived wrong. 
From this hour, therefore, he resolved on 
no more seeking the fair stranger, and on 
doing every thing in his power to detach 
his thoughts from her. The resolution 
was painful, but a conviction of the conse- 
quences of not attending to h being much 
more so, determined him on adhering to 
it. 

The next morning, after breakfast, as he 
was sitting alone and rather pensively in 
his chamber, a gentle tap came to the door, 
and on his desiring the person to enter, 
Mactalla made his appearance. 

'' Do I intrude, Signor/' cried he, bow- 



t> 



Osmond nodded, and Mactalla, shutting 
the door, then approached him. 

*' I have news for you, Signor," exclaim- 
voL. III. G ed 



122 Tlli: DISCARDED SOX. 

ed he in a joyful accent^ '' I have news for 
you." 

Osmond started â€” '' News !" repeated he, 
instantly concluding it was something re- 
lative to the fair stranger he had to com- 
municate. Then recollecting his resolu- 
tion of the preceding night â€” " Have you?" 
said he, in a more composed accent, and 
resuming his seat. 

'' Yes, and that I have by the Powders. 
You must know, Signor, that yesterday, ia 
searching after a pet dog of my Lady Mar- 
chesa's, in a remote and lonely part of the 
castle, long disused by the family, I chanced 
to discover her favourite waiting-woman in 
conversation with a young lady of great 
beauty, and who so strongly resembled the 
description given by my Lord the Count 
of the lady he set me upon making inqui- 
ries after, that I instantly resolved on ques- 
tioning Madam Beatrice closely about her. 
Accordingly I lay in wait till she quitted 
the gallery in which I had surprised her ; 

and 



TITE DISCARDED SON. l^^f 

and theiij by dint of cross questionings 
and coaxing, drew from her that the young 
lady in question was a Miss Raymond, the 
daughter of an English gentleman of for- 
tune, but w^ho, owing to an unfortunate 
affair of honour, had been under the ne- 
cessity of quitting his own country, bring- 
rng with him his family, consisting of her 
and her mother; and who, having some rea- 
son to imagine that his steps were traced, had 
turned out of the straight road to Naples, 
for the purpose of taking refuge for a 
time in this castle, with the late owner of 
which, my Lord Marchese, he was former- 
ly well acquainted, and of whose death he 
was ignorant at the time he formed this 
resolution. V/ithin half a league of this he 
stopt, and dispatched a letter hither by a 
confidential servant, which the Marchesa 
opened, and finding it came from a person 
who had enjoyed the friendship of her 
Lord, she directly hastened to assure him 
in person of the asylum he required under 
her roof. Accordingly, in the dead of the 
Â« 2 night, 



1^4 THE DISCARDED SON. 

night J he and his family were introduced 
into the castle, and immediately put in 
possession of apartments not likely to 
subject them to intrusion, and two of her 
household, on whose prudence and secrecy 
she particularly relied, appointed to wait 
on them. She and Lady Elizara spent 
much time in their company till the arrival 
of the Count, since which they have rarely 
been with them, lest their being so should 
expose them to his knowledge, and thus 
be the means of having them betrayed to 
that of others/* 

''What, by the Count!'* interrupted 
Osmond, with something like indignant 
astonishment ; " suspect him capable of 
an act of such baseness?" 

'' No, Signor, no. They have no idea 
he would do so in any other way than by 
yielding to an over anxiety to render them 
happy." 

'' Ah, now I understand you,*' said Os- 
mond. 

^' Since the Marchesa and Lady Elizara 

have 



tliE DISCARDED SON. IS5 

have ceased being much ^vith them^ the 
young ladv has had recourse to books and 
stolen rambles for amusement ; for her fa- 
ther is either so severe^ or else so appre- 
hensive, as thev have before been on the 
Continent, of her being seen by some one 
who may know her^ that with his good will, 
he'd immure her like a nun. This, Signor, 
is the whole of what I had to comiounicate, 
and which of course will not travel farther/' 
Osmond sighed, and remained silent and 
thoughtful for a few minutes. Then rais- 
ing his eyes to Mactalla â€” " I thank you, 
my friend/' he cried, '' for the pains you 
have taken to oblige me ; for I perceive 
you are perfectly aware that it was to 
please me the Count stimulated you to 
the inquiries you have done. I conceive, 
however, that my curiosity w^as.of an idle 
nature ; and therefore beg you may give 
yourself no further trouble on my account. 
Of the necessity of silence relative to what 
you have told me, be assured I am too well 
Q 3 aware 



126 THE DISCARDED ^SON, 

aware for you to be tinder any apprehen- 
sion of my dropping a hint on the sub- 
ject.'^ 

When ]eh again to his own reflections â€” 
'' Is she tlien unhappy ?" Osmond menially 
excLaimed. '' Oh that I had the power of 
affording to her father the refuge he rc- 
qiiircSj of stepping between him and dan- 
ger. Vain wish ! let me not indulge in 
such ! Let mc ratlier wish to obtain what 
is possibleâ€” a conquest over the feelings 
that now agitate me/' 

He had now been an inmate of the castle 
of Acerenza upwards of a months and could 
ro longer think of deferring his return to 
his native country. Accordingly^ he in- 
structed a servant to make inquiries for a 
vessel bound to England. The Marchesa 
and her nephew being apprised of this, no 
longer delnyed acquainting him with the 
wishes thev had formed for his continu- 
ance with them. To *:.ilence their painful 
solicitations on this head^ Osmo-ul w:ls at 

length 



THE DlSCAKDrD SON. 127 

length induced to confess the motives that 
urg^ him to return home. This confes- 
sion^ however, so far from having the de- 
sired eficct, rendered them if possible still 
more importunate with him to remain 
where he then was; and as an inducement 
to him to do so^ entreated him to invite^, in 
their united names, his family to come over 
immediately, aiul take up iheir residence 
at a pleasant and commodious house at no 
great distance from the castle, and apper- 
t^iining to its domain. 

But no arguments, no entreaties, could 
obtain from Osmond his acquiescence to 
this m.ensure. He knew the sentiments 
of h'm family too ^.vell, not to be con- 
vinced that they would consider them.selvcs 
degraded by accepting an asylum from 
strangers, and that what they considered 
as a de2:radation they wbukl never volun- 
tarily submit to : and as to himself, his 
pride, his principles, revolted from the 
idea of his being a dependant, of sinking 
in supineness the talents with which Ilea- 
G 4 veil 



128 THE DISCAHDF.D SOX, 

ven had endowed him â€” No; in place of 
doing this, he resolved, by the active exer- 
tion of these, of the abilities he was master 
of, to make a vigorous effort for that in- 
dependance which is the aim, the ambition 
of everv generous spirit to possess, and 
thus at all events to have the felicity of 
thinking he deserved it. 

This resolution, together with the senti- 
ments in which it originated, he candidly 
confessed to his noble friends. The Mar- 
chesa ceased her importunities the moriient 
he had done so; and the Count also con- 
tinued Silent and thoughtful for some irii- 
nutes after ; then suddenly starting up, 
and shaking off the cloudy aspect he h::d 
assumed on Osmond's positive refusal to 
continue at the castle â€” ''Well, my friend," 
cried he, "suppose it were possible in this 
country to procure you the indcpendance 
you merit, would you then have any oii- 
jection to remaining in it, and thus afford- 
ing us a chance of sometimes enjoying the 
happiness of your society ?'' 

Osmond 



THE DISCARDED SON. 129 

Osmond paused- â€” he deliberated â€” he felt 
convinced that the Count would never 
have asked such a question, if not possess- 
ed of the power of serving him in Italy. 
He reflected on the great uncertainty there 
was of his obtaining a settlement^ at least 
such a one as he wished for^ for some time 
in England ; as though, in order to pre- 
vent his spirits from sinking into utter 
despondence, he had endeavoured to buoy 
himself up with hopes of I;Ord O'Sinister's 
exerting himself to serve him, still he had 
never for an instant forgot how posiiively 
his Lordship had declared to him that he 
should not be able to do this essentiallv, 
if at all, for a considerable period ; and 
that Delacour's friends might not be in- 
clined to exert their interest for anv but 
their own immediate connexions. The 
result of these reflections^ therefore^ was 
his entreating the Count to have the good- 
ness to explain himself, candidly acknow- 
ledging that the first road to honourable 
G 5 indepen- 



130 THE DISCAnDED SON. 

independance that opened to his view he 
would joyfuiiy embrace. 

" Whis is what I purpose/' replied the 
Count. " The Duke D'Amalfi, a near re- 
lation of mine, and now at the head of af- 
fairs in Napte. has repeatedly assured me 
that nothing could possiblv confer greater 
happiness on him than an oppoi'tunity of 
obliging me. I shall^ therefore, if you 
permit, v/rite immediately to recommend 
you <o his patronage." 

Osmond accepted this proposal with joy 
and rratitude. Accordfnirlv a courier was 
immediately dispatched by the Count \vith 
a letter to his noble relative concerning 
him. 

To this an answer, not merely favour- 
able bnt also highly flattering, was received 
at the expected time; and the day after, 
Osmond began to make preparations for 
his departure from Acerenza. Too well 
aware of the injury he was doing to his 
future prospects, by wasting the present 

hours 



THE DISCARDED SON. 131 

hours in idleness â€” of the welfare of his fu- 
ture days depending in all probability on 
the manner in which he emploved the 
present time, to suffer himself to be pre- 
vailed on by the Count to defer it longer 
than was absolutely necessary. 

The Marchesa now made a proposal to 
him that v/as trulv agreeable, namely, as 
the attendance of a valet could not be dis- 
pensed with by him, to take PJartalla into 
his service^ who, notwithstanding his sin- 
cere attachment to her familv, wished to 
extend his rambles beyond her domain ; 
and had besides conceived such a partiaiit}^ 
for him, he having been the servant ap- 
pointed to wait on him^ that he felt soli- 
citous to continue in that situation. 

This matter beiffg arranged to the satis- 
faction of all parties, Osmond next availed 
himself of an opportunity that just at this 
juncture occurred of writing to England. 
His letter was long and explanatory. Aiter 
entreating no time might be lost in writ- 
G inir 



132 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ing to the difT'erent places where there was 
a chance of Delacoiir's touching on his re- 
turn to Europe^ he expressed his hopes of 
his parents having no objection to joining 
him as soon as possible in Italy, where 
every thing that filial love and duty conld 
dictate for tl>eir happiness should be done 
by him. 

, The Count, as the most likely method 
he thought he could have recourse to for 
the purpose, endeavoured to induce him 
to protract his stay at Acerenza, by assuring 
him he was positive, if he prolonged it,, 
they should yet be able to discover who- 
the fair stranger was. Osmond, however^ 
Tem-ained inexorable to his entreaties; but 
at the same time promised not only to visit 
him speedily but often^ .should he have it 
in his power. 

At an early hour one morning, ere yet 
the mists and exhalations of early day had 
disappeared, Osmond, having previously 
the preceding night taken a most affec- 
tionate 



The Discarded son. 133 

tionate leave of his noble and generous, 
friends, quitted their hospitable mansion 
on horseback, which ir>ode of travel I ini; 
\vt)uld better than anv other, he conceived, 
enable hirn to gratify his curiosity with re- 
gard to the scenery he should travel through; 
and attended, besides his valet Mactalla, by 
a little French boy, the son of a deceased 
servant of the Marchesa's, for the purpose 
of guiding a sumpter mule, the road be- 
tween the castle and Naples being extreme- 
ly bare of accommodation for travellers. 

The Count gave him an introductory 
letter to the Duke D'Amalfi, and tried to 
force a pecuniary obligation on him; but 
to no purpose â€” the manner in which he 
meant to prosecute his journey, united to 
the circumstance of his having received his 
purse back again from the pirate undimi- 
nished in its contents^, making Osmond con- 
ceive it absolutely unnecessary far him to 
incur one of the kind. 

The Count, however, differing in opi- 
jiion from him, and finding it impossible 

to 



134 TilE DISCARDED SOX. 

to prevail on him to do what he wished, 
privately dispatched a messenger %vith a 
letter to the Duke D'Amalfi, two days pre- 
ceding his departure^ in which, after ex- 
patiating on the too scrupulous delicacy 
of Osmond w-ith regard to pecuniary mat- 
terSj he entreated his Excellency to have 
the 2:oodness to aDprooriale the sum of 

O ' ill 

twelve hundred pounds, for which he en- 
closed him an order on his banker in Na- 
ples, to the use of Osmond, in such a w^ay 
as should induce him to believe it was the 
produce of whatever situation he might 
be appointed to. 

With a heavy heart Osmond quitted the 
castle of Acerenza. Next to his own im- 
mediate connexions^ there were none for 
whom he entertained so high a regard as 
the amiable family he had parted from. 
He would indeed have considered himself 
ungrateful in the extreme, if he had not 
felt the parting with such friends, after the 
innumerable proofs of esteem and affec- 
tion he had received from them. 

Gradually,, 



THE DISCABDED SON. 133 

Gradually, however, in all probability, 
the sadness of his spirits would have yield- 
ed to the pleasing hopes he entertained of 
enjoying, ^rd that at no very distant pe- 
riod, perhaps^ again their society, but for 
the despair he felt of ever more beholding 
Miss Raymond, whose idea, an invO'Un- 
tarv retrospect at the moment he was quit- 

J i. ^ 

ting it, of the hours he had passed at the 
castle^ had awakened in his mind. 

As much as possible., how^ever, he strove 
to banish the fee]in2:s this idea o-ave birth 
to ; and at length X\\q numerous objects 
of grandeur and beauty that, as the dawn 
brightened, swelled on his sight, began to 
second the eflbrts he made for the purpose. 

The sun vras just beginning to gild \X< 
stately towers, when he paused to indulge 
himself with another and a last view of the 
castle of Acerenza. As he gazed upon its 
green groves and forests, gently agitated 
by the breath of morning, and resounding 
with the warblino-s of innuir.erable birds â€” 
*' Delightful shades !" he involuntarily and 
5 jnentally 



156 THE DISCARDED SON. 

mentally exclaimed^ his heart swelling with 
gratitude and tenderness at the recollec- 
tions they revived, '' ever may you con- 
tinue as now/ the bovvers of innocence and 
peace â€” ever inav the illustrious owners of 
the noble pile you shadow â€” that mansion 
where the houseless child of want sues not 
in vain for admission â€” where the stranger 
finds a ready refuge â€” ever may they con- 
tinue in possession of the happiness they 
so eminently merit." 

Then with a lingering adieu to all the 
beloved and enchanting haunts in which 
he had passed so many delightful hours, he 
rode on. For some time nothing could 
be more agreeable than his journey â€” the 
road;, for a considerable way after leaving 
the castle, gently sloping and winding 
amongst clifls covered with aromatic plants 
and flowers, and tufted with the most 
beautiful and fragrant shrubs, the exquisite 
sweetness of which was diffused around by 
a light breeze that swept over the cliffs ; 
but as the sun ascended in the horizon, 

thi^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 137 

this by degrees dving away, the heat be- 
came intense^ and the swarming insects 
that buzzed around troublesome in the 
extreme. 

After a long endurance of both, Osmond 
and his companions at length alighted^ and 
turning their horses to feed;, sought re- 
fuge themselves amidst the embowering 
shades, that almost in every direction met 
the view; and here Osmond could not but 
admire the provident care of nature^, who, 
as if aware of the necessity there was for 
shelter in such a climate, had, with a pro- 
fuse hand, scattered trees and shrubs 
around, the thickly interwoven foliage of 
wliich denied admission to the sunbeaira 
that had brought them to perfection, like 
to favourites, as Shakespeare beautifully 
says, 

** Made proud by princes, that advance tlieir piide 
Against the power thiU bred it." 

Osmond 



]3S THE DJSCAEDED .Â»iON. 

Osmond having taken possession of a 
delightfully situated arbour^ composed of 
orange^ spiry myrtle^ and lemon, surmount- 
ed by tufts of almond-trees, with a beauti- 
ful grove in the rear, and a fine meadow 
in front, still moist and verdant, notwith- 
standing the vertical sun that darted on it, 
in consequence of a fine clear rivulet that 
iTjeandered through the soil to a distant 
pile of rocks, down which it fell, checking 
and preventing the sweets of the surround- 
ing blossoms from being too potent, a 
basket of provisions was unpacked for his 
breakfast. 

Completely screened in his embowered 
retreat from the su!j, he enjoyed the con- 
templation of the effect it produced 
around. Flocks and herds were seen in 
every direction languidly ruminating ia 
the shade ; and shepherds stretched be- 
neath the expansive boughs of chesnut- 
trees, enjoying their leafy covert with a 
degree of luxurious indulgence peculiar to 

the 



7IIE DISCARDED Â«OK. 15^ 

the Italians, and for which they are remark- 
ed for enjoving the serenitv and s^enml 
warmth of their climate. 

As soon as they had breakfasted, Mac- 
talla and the French boy lay down to 
repose; but the mind of Osmond w^as too 
busily employed in reviewing the past and 
anticipatin,i>" the future, to permit him to 
follow their example. Absorbed in re- 
jection, he literally took no note of time^ 
till the awaking of Mactalla, when, looking 
at his watch, he found the sultry hours of 
noon were over, and that if they wished to 
get in at an early hour to the place whci'e 
they vvcre to rest for \he night, and which, 
from the Ion esc men ess of the roads, he 
understood it was essential to their safety 
to do, they had no further time to lose. 

Accordingly, he quickly remounted, and 
soon after found himself in a road bounded 
on one side by a river, and on the other 
by apparently impenetrable woods; on 
the opposite side of the river, and extend- 
ing along it, rose stupendous mountains,. 

many

many of them covered from the base to 
thesummitj with awful forests of pine and 
larch^ and others interspersed and rendered 
rugged with rocks and precipices, in many 
places projecting far^ and glooming npon^. 
the water beneath. 

The sun by this time sinking in the west> 
threw a warm glow over this wild tracts a 
crimson tint upon its rocks and jutting 
cliffs, that heightened its sublimity ; to 
which the richly coloured clouds that 
lightly floated over it, transiently veiling 
the bright azure of the heavens, added not 
a little. Altoo-ether it was a scene calcu- 
lated to awaken the enthusiasm of a devo- 
tee of Nature's; and by degrees the feel- 
ings it inspired Osmond with, so com- 
pletely absorbed him, as to interrupt the 
tanversation which he had from time to 
time carried on in the course of the day 
with his attendant Mactalla, whom he found 
at once intelligent and entertaining, and 
well acquainted with the road they were 



travelling. 



But

But soon the attention of Osmond be- 
came entirely engrossed by a village at 
the foot of the mountains, and character- 
ized by an air of the most chilling desola- 
tion. Nothing animate was visible either 
in or about it, and up to the very doors of 
the liouses the paths were choaked with 
w^eeds and grass. 

'' Ah Signor/' cried Mactalla, gently 
riding up to him, on perceiving the ear- 
nestness wath which he regarded this dreary 
spot, '' I see you are surprised by the 
stillness and loneliness of that place/' 
pointing across the water with his whip. 

'' I am indeed," replied Osmond ; '' pray 
to what may that stillness and loneliness be 
owinp-?" 

'' Faith, Signor, to a very sufficient 
cause â€” to its having no inhabitants." 

^' No inhabitants!" in accents of sur- 
prise, repeated his master. 

'' That I know^ of," rejoined Mactalla, 
'' except it be a stray sheep or a goat from 
the mountains."

'^'^ Heavens 1 what a mortality must have 
prevailed amongst them \" exclaim?d Os- 
mond. 

" A mortality ! Ah Signor, but I'll tell 
you all about it, if you have no objection 
to a melancholy story." 

'' Not the least, if you have none to tell 
one/' 

'' Oh not the smallest; merry or sad 'tis 
all one to me. I used to keep the Mar- 
chesa's people alive and merry with my 
stories.'' 

'' What ! your dismal ones ?" asked Os- 
mond, half smiling, 

^' Yes, Signor; for a dismal one always 
led to a merry one : when I had lowered 
their spirits, the least I could do was to 
raise them again. I had always something 
pleasant to tell them of my own country,^ 
little Ireland; how the lads at the patterns 
there, after drinking lovingly together for 
hours, would sally forth to bang one ano- 
ther 



THE DISCARBED SON. 145 

ther for nothing at all but the lionour of 
the thing, and that of their different coun- 
ties; and then, after amusing themselves 
at this sport for half an hour or so, return 
quietly to their booths, as good friends as 
ever with one another/' 

'M see you have not forgotten your na- 
tive country," cried Osmond. 

^' No, vSignor; my poor father was too 
fond of talking of it^ to let me do so â€” but 
to the story I promised to tell you. About 
two years ago, the Marchesa Morati, and 
her husband the late March ese, went to 
pay a visit to a friend residing among the 
most distant of the mountains on the op- 
posite shore. Returning from this to their 
castle, they got benighted and bewildered 
amongst those tremendous ones, immedi- 
ately in the neighbourhood of Tessino. 
Whilst endeavouring to regain their road, 
they fancied they heard dreadful shrieks 
mingling with the cold blast that blew 
around them â€” and the next morning 
proved they were not mistaken ; for the 

VOL. III. .H iirst 



146 THE DISCARDED SON; 

first news they heard on rising was, that 
all the inhabitants of Tessino had been 
murdered the preceding night; and doubt- 
less both they and their attendants would 
also have been dispatched^, had they then 
been discovered in its neighbourhood, 
which, seeing that all the party were not 
perhaps too well prepared for a journey 
to the other world, might not have proved 
a very agreeable circumstance to the feel- 
ings of some of them/* 

*^' Good heavens !*' exclaimed Osmond, 
with horror in his look and accent, " to 
what was so dreadful a catastrophe owing?** 

" You shall hear, Signor. A lad of the 
name of Felisco, a native of Tessino, the 
son of a shepherd, and one himself, was 
employed by a wealthy farmer, residing 
amongst those mountains, to keep sheep 
for him. At no great distance from the 
place where his flock fed, was rather a well 
frequented road ; and opportunities thus 
afforded Felisco of witnessing the depre- 
dations and savage acts of cruelty com- 
mitted 



THE DISCARDED SON. IA7 

mitted on travellers by a desperate gang 
of robbers, who found shelter in a forest 
hard by. At first he "was terribly fright- 
ened whenever any of them came in his 
way, which was often the case ; but at 
length, finding they never attempted to 
injure or molest him in any manner, he 
by degrees came to think no more of them 
than if they had been so many of the in.- 
nocent sheep he tended ; and at length 
suffered them to scrape a kind of ac- 
quaintance with him, but remained deaf 
to all the arguments they used, the Cap- 
tain in particular â€” for Felisco was a stout 
active lad, and the rogue knew therefore 
would be an acquisition to his troop â€” to 
try and prevail on him to forsake his mean 
and tiresome employment of keeping 
sheep, as they chose to call it, and put 
himself in the way of obtaining fame and 
riches by joining them. 

'' It happened one morning that he and 

his master went to a neighbouring town 

to sell some sheep. A man, who had 

n 2 come 



148 THE DISCARDED Â£0N. ] 

come thither to purchase provisions, was^ 
in consequence of his suspicious appear- ] 
ance, taken up and exposed to view in the 
market-place, and a large reward offered ; 
to any one who could prove whether or \ 
not he belonged to a troop of banditti in i 
the neighbourhood, by whom the son of a ^ 
man of considerable consequence and for- 
tune had been lately murdered. Amongst \ 
the rest, Felisco took a peep at the stran- 
ger; and notwithstanding his being dis- i 
guised, instantly recognized in him his ac- 
quaintance, the'captain of the robbei*s. \ 

'' Doubtful how to act, he immediately I 
took his master aside, and imparted the dis- \ 
covery to him, who, being a little more 1 
knowing than he was, hesitated not to take , 
advantage of it, by directly going to a ; 
magistrate to identify the stranger, and i 
thus secure the reward promised to the ' 
person who did so. I 

" That Felisco, how^ever, had the best ; 
right to this was well known, which the ) 
inai^istrate at length learning, he insisted 

on 



THE DISCARDED SON. 149 

on its being divided with hfm; and after- 
wards employed him as a guide to the 
troops that were sent out in quest of the 
rest of the banditti. With their grand re- 
treat, however, Fclisco was unacquainted; 
but notwithstanding, several of them were 
taken through his means, and together 
with their leader, executed : after which 
the magistrate, fearful that it would not be 
safe for him to remain in his old neigh- 
bourhood, sent him privately, and under 
his special protection, from it. 

" The result proved his apprehensions 
well founded. The survivors of the gang, 
after loHg searching for him, for the 
purpose, as one of them afterwards con- 
fessed, of revenging themselves on him, 
for the loss of so many brave comrades, 
came to the horrid resolution of destroy- 
ing all his friends and relations in Tes- 
sino â€” a resolution which they carried into 
effect, descending from their hiding-places 
in the mountains to the village, at the 
dead hour of midnight, when all the poor 
H 3 inhabi- 



150 THE DISCARDED SON. 

inhabitants were buried in repose after the 
fatigues of the day. Blessed St. Benedict! 
Avhat horrid sights did it present the next 
morning ! But I'll not shock you, Signor^ 
by dwelling on these. Suffice it to say, 
the reiKiains of the poor massacred inhabi- 
tants were all quietly laid in one grave, 
and ever since the village of Tessino has 
been truly a deserted one. They say the 
houses are soon to be pulled down, and a 
monastery erected on their scite, by way 
of an asylum for travellers benighted 
amongst the desolate mountains in this 
quarter, and where daily prayers are to be 
ofTered up for the souls of those who so 
miserably perished. Considering the gran- 
deur amd loneliness of the situation, I 
don't think, Signor, a better could be 
fixed on for a religious edifice.'' 

To the justness of this observation Os- 
mond assented by a slight inclination of 
his head : and now the sun disappearing 
from the horizon, the wavering woods, 
and rocks, and mountain tops, that long 

retained 



THE DISCARDED SON. 1.51 

retained the ascending gloom, were be- 
ginning to be involved in the gloom of 
night â€” a gloom rendered more impressive 
by the terrific grandeur or rather wildness 
of the surrounding scenery ; and a rising 
wind, that now howled dismally through 
the clefts of the mountains, now swept in 
hollow gusts over the tali forests that hung 
upon their sides. 

" I am much mistaken," cried Mactalla, 
after a short interval of silence, '' if a storm 
be not coming on. The clouds looked 
threatening as the sun disappeared ; and 
See, Signor, how vainly the moon strives 
to make her appearance. I hope we may 
ireach the place where we are to put up for 
the night before it begins; for it won't be 
the most agreeable thing in the world to 
be overtaken by one here. Ah, commend 
me to the roads of little Ireland, where, if 
a person be surprised by a storm, they have 
always a snug inn at hand to thrust their 
heads into. Fine landscapes are fine things, 
but in my mind there's nothing so plea- 
H 4 sant 



152 THE DISCARDED SON. 

sant to a weary traveller as a cosy little 
parlour, with plenty of provisions/' 

" Did you ever hear more of the inno- 
cent occasion of the dreadful catastrophe 
yon have been relating to me ?" asked Os- 
mond, still too much occupied in reflect- 
ing on it, to attend to the observations 
he was making. 

'* No, Signor, though I have frequently 
inquired for him. We were very intimate; 
indeed I may say a kind of friendship sub- 
sisted between us. Some people blame 
him for what he did : for my part I say 
nothing â€” only that I think he had better 
not have made himself so busy ; for as 
shaking water that has a foul bottom only 
renders it muddy, so disturbing si>ch 
folks only renders them more mischiev- 
ous." 

" Nay, my friend, 'tis a duty we owe to 
society to bring wickedness to punishment 
whenever we have the power. He that 
would neglect to avail himself of an op- 
portunity to do so^ would justly be consi- 
dered 



THE DISCARDED SON. 153 

sidered in the light of an accessary to the 
crimes of those he thussufiered to escape/* 

'' I stand corrected, Signor/' returned 
MactaEa, in accents of submission. 

Osmond now inquired whether they 
were stiil far distar.t from the hamlet wher^ 
they purposed resting for the night ? 

*â€¢ As it is now too dark for me to see 
about me/' replied Mactalla, '' if I knew 
how many miles we had come, I could re- 
solve that question. Pray, Signor, is it 
possible to calculate distance by time c^' 

'' Certainly/' answered his master. 

'' May It please you then, Signor, to 
make up. the number of miles you think 
we have come, from three o'clock this- 
morning down to the present hour, which 
I take to be about ten, from the time that. 
has eiupsed since we heard a vesper bell." 

'' We had much better push on than 
waste time in trying to calculate how far 
we have come ; for I now perfectly agree 
with you in thinking that a storm is at 
hand/' 

11 5 They 



151' THE DISCARDED SON. 

They accordingly pushed forward, but, 
to their great vexation, were ahnost every 
five minutes obliged to slacken their speed, 
owing to the little French boy, who in vain 
tried to make his mule keep up with their 
h'orses, perpetually exclaiming, under the- 
terrifying apprehension of being left be- 
hind, '' All voleur ! au voleiir ! an voleur !" 
an exclamation that, notwithstanding Mac- 
talla's solicitations to the contrary, Osmond 
could not avoid attending to. 

" Long threatening comes at last,'' cned 
Alactalla, on feeling some heavy drops of 
rain fall upon his face, accompanied by 
vivid flashes of lightning and tremendous. 
hursts of thunder.' 

""' We must get on as fast as w^e can," 
said Osmond; " for I am pretty well con- 
vinced this storm will not soon be over.'* 

" Ah, you were right, Signor, to say as 
fast as we can, which by the Powers won't 
be very fast; for this beast (alluding to 
the mule, which, for some time past, he 
had been stationed by, in order to try and 

o:et 



THE DISCARDED SON. 155 

get it forward) is to the full as stubborn, 
I'll be sworn, as any of her generation ever 
were. By the Lord, I might just as well 
beat one of the trees as beat her." 

'' Well, my friend/' cried Osmond, '^ we 
must only have the greater patience." 

In a short time the storm became so vio- 
lent, that it was utterly impossible for them 
to proceed. They accordingly alighted, 
and leading their affrighted horses^ sought 
shelter from its violence at the entrance of 
a wood that skirted the road. 

" By St. Benedict," cried Mactalla, as 
they slowly made their way into it, and the 
blue lightning quivered round their heads, 
*^ one might almost be tempted to think 
the end of the world at hand; for such 
fire and brimstone as this was never, I be- 
lieve, seen or smelt before : but courage, 
eourage," he continued, on their arriving 
beneath the foliage of some tall and inter- 
woven trees, matted together in wuld luxu- 
riance; "let me tell you, Signor, both 
H G man, 



156 THE mSCAllDED SON. 

man and beast might be worse off than 
here." 

The shelter they had obtained v/as, how- 
ever, but partial. The rain fell in torrents, 
and was freqiicntiv blown in their faces by 
sndden squalls cf wind, and which also 
bowed, with frightful violence, the trees 
around them; the tumultuous heavings of 
which, as agitated by the wind, now resem- 
bled the roaring and breaking of waves 
upon a rocky coastâ€” now the doleful 
shrieking of unquiet spirits. 

" I should not much like to be alone in 
this dismal place," said Mactalla, getting 
closer to his master, " for I have heard that 
ghosts, like witches, ride upon the wind ; 
though to be sure none but such as had 
very bad quarters at home would venture 
out such a night as this." 

" And whv not ? seeincr no blast that 
blew could i^njure them, being but airy 
nothing themselves." 

*^^ Holy St. Benedict ! you believe in 
them then?" 

" Nq 



THE DISCARDED SON. 157 

*' No, I have not said I did. I have only 
spoken of them in the light in which they 
are regarded by those who do â€” but hark 1 
Diethinks I hear the trampling of horses/' 

Mactalla instantly became silent, and 
both listened attentively^ but without 
hearing aught for a few minutes but the 
raging of the wind in the wood. They 
then clearly distinguished the clattering of 
horses'" hoofs, accompanied by a eonfused 
murmur of mens' voices. 

'' Signor/' cried Mactalla, in a whisper^ 
ing tone, and suddenly pressing the arm of 
Osmond, " let us be cautions ; for I should 
not be in the least surprised \^ the men we 
hear were a troop of banditti. Holy St. 
Benedict take us into his keeping, and get 
13S safely through the perils and dangers of 
this night ! '' 

Osmond, who did not by any means think 
his conjecture erroneous, now in his turn 
reminded him of the necessity of silence; 
The wind again rising, prevented their 
bearing for some minutes any other sounds 

than 



o> 



l5i THE WSCARDED SON. 

than those it occasioned. On its subsiding 
they were startled by hearing the horses 
near the thrcket which sheltered them^ and 
a hoarse voice at the entrance exclaiming 
â€” '' Ho, here appears to be a spot that will 
afford shelter to ourselves and beasts ; let 
us alight,, and get out of this d â€” nind storm, 
which has given me a greater drenching 
than I ever got before." 

This speech induced Osmond and his 
companions to change their quarters. On 
advancing a little farther into the wood, 
they again paused, for the purpose of list- 
ening to the conversation of those who 
had obliged them to move, and which in a 
few minutes convinced them they were not 
wrong in their surmises respecting them. 

They complained of their ill luck, in not 
having met with the booty they expected 
that night. 

" But the night is not yet over/' ob- 
served one of the party, '' and before it is 
we may be more fortunate ; so instead of 
any longer railing or lameiiliug, let us en- 
deavour 



THE DISCARDED SON. 15f} 

deavour to do something to make ourselves 
comfortable. Come^ stir about^ lads^ and 
try to get something* together to make a 
fire." 

This order being obeyed, a quantity of 
faggots was speedily collected, and a light 
being struck, a fire was kindled, round 
which the party ranged themselves. The 
strong glare which the flame, as it spread, 
east around them, permitted Osmond, on 
his cautiously advancing a few paces for 
the purpose, to vi^w their countenances, 
than which nothing could be conceived 
more illustrative of their profession ; cun- 
ning and ferocity were imprest on every 
feature, and an additional fierceness given 
to their aspects by their savage style of 
dress. Notwithstanding the disappoint- 
ment they spoke of, and the weather, they 
appeared in high spirits; but, like their 
appearance, their mirth was of the rough- 
est nature. 

'^ Tivoli," cried one of them, who, by 

his ordering, seemed to have some au- 

3. thority 



160 THE DISCARDED SON. 

thority over the rest, " what provisior>s 
have you got ?** 

'' But little^ if any/* grumbled out a 
rough sullen bass voice, '' as you might 
know, if you gave yourself lime to reflect; 
for many hands make light work/' 

*^' True, true/' assented the other; ''I 
might have known, as you say, that we 
can't eat oiir cake and have it ; but pro- 
duce us what you have, and like an ho- 
nest lad as you are, try if you can't rum- 
mage ys out a flask of wine â€” it will help 
to warm us. I am devilish hungry, how- 
ever, let me tell you." 

Wine being produced, the ruffians be- 
came rtill mere noisy and argumentative 
than they had before been. 

'' Oh, holy St. Benedict!" at length 
softly exclaimed Mactalia, in his master's 
ear^ '^ what will become of us ?" 

" Trust in Heaven/*^ returned Osmond, 
in the same low key. 

" So I do, Signorj blessed be the name 
Â©f St. Benedict/* 

^^ Hollo, 



THE DISCARDED SON. IGl 

'* Holloj Tivoli/' vociferated he who 
appeared to be the leader of this band of 
villains, '' I say Tivoli, I'll be d â€” mnd, if 
you don't replenish the fire^ if we shan't 
;soon be without a sparky which, see- 
ing there is no prospect of the weather 
soon clearing, would not be over agree- 
able." 

After a pawse^ Tivoli replied â€” " Why I 
can find no more faggots." 

" By the head of our fraternity/' cried 
the other, '' but that is a good joke. I trow 
if you can see the w^ood for trees. Here, 
numskull, take this brand and search about; 
dive deeper into the wood, and I'll warrant 
me you'll have something more than your 
pains for your trouble.'* 

" I'll bear him company," said another, 
starting up, and also snatching a brand 
from the fire, the strong glare of v/hich 
falling full upon his features, permitted 
Osmond and Mactalla to have a full view 
of them, which the latter no sooner had, 
than starting back â€” '' Oh, holy St. Bene- 
dict 1" 



fG^ THE BISCA11D1?:D SON. 

diet!" crossing himself, and in an under 

tcTne, he exclaimed, " who could have 

thought of such a thing? but that man's 

being here is wonderful/' 

â–  '' What man ?'' demanded Osmond, with 

involuntary quickness^ but also in a low 

voice. 

*' Don't question ine now, Signor ; I am 
too much flurried to be able to answer 
you." 

'' Dive ^te\i into the wood, lads, and 
you'll be certain of getting plenty of fuel," 
again vociferated the leader; '' we lack 
comfort much ; so let us at least have that 
of a good fire." 

The men advanced in the direction in 
which Osmond and his companions were. 
The former kept a watchful eye upon 
them, and as they gradually advanced, gra- 
dually retreated. The little French boy was 
here as troublesome a companion as he 
had proved on the road â€” his attention 
being so engrossed by the banditti, that 
he continually suffered Osmond and Mac- 

talla 



THE DISCARDED SON. 365 

falla to get the start of him, and then his 
fears returning, obliged them, by some Te- 
hement, though not loud exclamation,, to 
tetrace iheir way back for him. 

At length Osmond, in consequence of 
hearing the ruffians who had been sent to 
gather wood, suddenly stop, as if to listen^ 
began to fear the boy had been overheard 
â€¢â€”a fear in which he was shortly confirmed 
by hearing one of them exclaim â€” *^ Aye^ 
ayCj d â€” mn â€” tion, what can it be ?'* 

He paused no longer, but driving the 
boy before him, stopt not again until, with 
his companions, he found himself in a small 
opening amongst some thickets, on the 
edge of a rapid river. Owing to the re- 
moteness of this spot from the place where 
they had left the banditti, he conceived 
they could not find a better one to stop 
in. At all events, they had no other alter- 
native than either to do so, or retrace the 
way they had come, the thickets that ex- 
tended on either side appearing ab&olutely 
impenetrable, 

'' Yes, 



164 THE DISCARDED SON. 

*' YeSj yes/' said Mactalla, replying \o 
what he said on the subject, ' we are here, 
I think, perfectly safe, blessed be good St, 
Benedict for his attention to my prayers. 
The moment I set my foot in the town of 
Cassino, where stands his own convent, 
founded by himself I shall take care to 
make him a return, and that of no trifling 
nature either, for his goodness on this oc- 
casion. Yes, yes, he shall find I have a 
proper sense of gratitude for his protec- 
tion of us this night.'* 

Osmond could not forbear smiling at the 
simplicity of his attendant, although by no 
means at ease in his own mind â€” his uncer- 
tainty of the direction the banditti might 
pursue not permitting him to be without 
some apprehension ii\\\ of their being dis- 
covered. It now occurred tu him to in- 
quire whether Mactalla bad put up any wea- 
pons of defence for them ? and to his great 
vexation was answered in the negative ; 
for his great omission in not doing which, 
Mactalla implored his forgiveness,, and ac- 
counted 



THS DISCARDED SON. 165 

counted for by declaring he was so agitated 
between joy and grief at quilting Ace- 
renza^ that he scarce knew ^vhat he was 
about. 

The fury of the storm had by this time 
much abated â€” the rsin was nearly over, 
the wind had sunk into a hollow murmur, 
and at intervals the moon showed her pale 
face^ as on that sad night, '' w^hen Arindal 
the mighty fell, when Daura the lovely 
failed, fair as the moon on the hills of 
Fura, white as the driven snow^ sweet as 
the breathing gale/* 

'' The weather clears so fast/* said Mac- 
talla, after a long and profound silence, 
" that I dare say the banditti will soon 
leave the coast clear to us again.'* 

'' Till the return of morning, however, 
I think it better for us to remain where we 
now are/* observed Osmond. 

**â–  Assuredly, Signor; but/* starting, and 
laying his hand upon his master's arm, 
"^ blessed St. Benedict ! is there not some- 



thing rustling amongst the trees ?' 



Osmond 



160 THE DISCARDED SON. 

Osmond listened for a few minutes at- 
tentively ; then â€” ''â€¢ 'tis but the horse-s 
moving/' cried he ; '' let us^ however, be 
silent, lest an enemy be nearer than we 
imagine/' 

The silence he enjoined was soon, how- 
ever/interrupted by the boy (who, with 
the restlessness peculiar to his age, had 
wandered away to a distance) exclaiming 
aloud, as if in the greatest agony â€” " I am 
killed! I am killed !^^ 

Osmond instantly flew to his assistance, 
and raising him from the ground, on which 
he found him extended, enquired what had

'' Oh master, master,'* said or rather 
roared the boy, '^ one of my legs is surely 
broke, for the mule has trod upon it/' " 

'' By St. Benedict, I wish," cried Mac- 
talla, who had followed close upon the 
steps of his master, '' that it waS your head 
she had got under her foot, and that she 
had kept it there till the day of judgment/' 
Osmond having satisfied himself that the

leg was not fractured^ endeavoured to si- 
lence -the boy, and at last, though not 
without much difficulty, succeeded. 

" K pretty thing, you little urchin," 
proceeded Mactaila, '' if, through youj* 
squalling, any mischief should befal us. 
By the Lord I have a great mind to make 
both you and your mule pay this instant 
fcu' all the vagaries you have both been 
Â§oing on with ever since you left Ace- 
renza. Signor, do you think he could 
possibly have been heard by the ruffians?" 
'^ I hope not,*' replied Osmond. 
'^ Ah, the cut-throat dogs, what an es- 
cape we have had from thenl !" 

" You should return thanks to Heaven 
for it,'* rejoined his master. 

" So I do, Signor, so I do ; blessed be 
the name of St. Benedict for his kindness 
to us." 

'' Aye, aye, you have reason indeed to 
be thankful to him for his kindness in 
throwing you into our power," exclaimed 
^ hoarse voice at the moment, immediately

behind him; and at the same instant he 
felt his arms seized^, as were also those of 
Osmond. 

Their feelings on the occasion at find- 
ing themselves surprised by the villains 
they flattered themselves they had escaped 
from, may easier be conceived than de- 
scribed. 

Osmond, however, speedily collecting 
himself, made an effort to regain their li- 
berty, but an unsuccessful one, by offering 
to surrender quietly all they were possessed 
of at the moment, for the purpose. He 
and Mactalla were forced to mount their 
own horses, not however without much 
resistance on the part of the latter â€” he 
stamped, stormed^ begged, prayed, but all 
to no purpose. 

^' There's no use in praying to us," cried 
one of the gang ; '' what's become of your 
friend St. Benedict, that you should leave 
off doing so to him ?" 

" Ha, ha. Monsieur Frenchman/* ex- 
claimed another of the party, '' 'tis to you

we are indebted for this prize. Tivoli, 
let's see what his mule is loaded with." 

Tivoli obeyed. The provisions he pro- 
duced were eagerly devoured. They then 
remounted, daylight beginning to appear, 
and, with Osmond and Mactalla in the cen- 
re, set pff at a sm art pace. 

After pursuing some time the road their 
prisoners had deviated from, in order to 
obtain shelter from the storm, they struck 
into a deep forest, which they continued 
to traverse for a considerable period, ia 
the most zig-zag manner imaginable, mak- 
ing openings for themselves through ap- 
parently impenetrable thickets, by the re- 
moval of matted boughs, which they still 
replaced, not only with astonishing dex- 
terity, but so as to deceive the nicest eye.

CHAP. VII. 



** Black was the forest, thick with beech it scood. 

Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn ; 

Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts were worn.** 



SMOND, who possessed in an eminent 
degree that cool and steady courage which 
keeps the n.ind collected in the hour of 
danger/ could not but admire the ingenu- 
ity they displayed in the methods they had 
recourse to to prevent pursuit. 

Their not having put him and his com- 
panions immediately to death, induced him 
to believe it was not their intention to do 
so; but either to sell them to slavery in 

some 



THE DISCARDED SON. 171 

some foreign land^ or keep them in a state 
of servitude upon themselves. 

This idea induced him to take as much 
notice as possible of the labyrinths they 
travelled^ that in case he should be fortu- 
nate enough to succeed in making his 
escape, he might not be altogether desti- 
tute of a clue to guide him through them. 

At length, emerging from the ^' close 
dungeon of innumerous boughs/' through 
which they had so long been pursuing 
their way, Osmond beheld a rude lawn, 
terminated by a narrow but rapid river, 
on the opposite bank of which arose 
the massy walls of an immense fabric, sur- 
mounted by tremendous heights, bespread 
with wood, and exhibiting a scene of so- 
lemn grandeur, rendered still more impres- 
sive by the decaying appearance of the 
pile they commanded â€” for as the dawn 
was by this time sufficiently advanced to 
permit objects to be distinguished, Osmond 
could perceive that many of its proudly- 
swelling ?nd receding towers were green 
I S with 



172 THE DISCARDED 5>0N. 

tvith the moss of age, and several of its 
turrets and strongholds shattered and 
crumbling away. 

But as (to use the words of a celebrated 
author) we look upon the wounds of a 
defaced soldier with more veneration than 
we do upon the most exact proportions 
of a beautiful woman, so in all probability 
this magnificent structure inspired Osmond 
with greater admiration as well as awe, now 
in the wane of its days, than it would have 
done in all its pride and glory. 

The pleasure, however, the contempla^ 
tion of it afforded him was as transient as 
involuntary. The dreadful purposes to 
which there was reason to suppose it now 
devoted â€” the idea of the equally dreadful 
fate that perhaps awaited him and his com- 
panions within it â€” for he speedily learned 
that this was the retreat of the banditti â€” 
made him presently view it with horror. 

On reaching the river^ the ruffians stopt, 
and a bugle being sounded by one of them, 
a draw-bridge was quickly let down, 

which 



THE DISCATIDED SON. 173 

which crossing, they entered upon a deep 
vaulted passage, guarded at each end by a 
heavy portal of iron and wood, and still 
further defended by towers. On quitting 
this, they alighted, and proceeded on foot 
through a succession of gloomy courts, 
encompassed by mouldering buildings, to 
a* hall of vast magnitude, lighted by a large 
fire and sevei^al immense lamps, with flam- 
ing burners, suspended from the cieling, 
and which altogether, from lis numerous 
arcades, its double row of pointed win- 
dows, divided by spacious galleries, the 
stately pillars that supported its ponde- 
rous and richly-fretted roof, and the va- 
rious outlets by means of small gothic 
doors that appeared among these, strongly 
resembled the interior of a cathedral. At 
the upper end was a large table, which 
two men were busied in spreading for an 
entertainm.cnt. Of these one of the ruf- 
fians demanded whether the Captain and 
his party were yet returned ? and on being 
answered in the negative, he and his com- 
1 3 panions 



174 ' THE DISCABDED SON. 

panions immediately withdrew, in rude and 
clamorous confusion, to exchange their 
wet clothes for dry ones^ leaving Osmond 
and Mactalla to their own cogitations. 

No sooner had they withdrawn, than Os- 
mond, anxious to mitigate the terror which 
his countenance evinced his entertaining 
for their pergonal safety, by imparting to 
him the conjectures he had formed with 
regard to the intentions of the bandiui 
concerning them, turned eagerly towards 
Mactalla, who stood at a little distance 
from him ; but to his surprise, instead of 
being able to catch his attention, he saw 
it rivetted upon an opposite and half-open 
door, at which a beckoning hand was just 
visible, and which at last he approached, 
but with seeming reluctance, and instantly 
after disappeared. 

This incident gave birth to a more un- 
pleasing sensation in the mind of Osmond 
than any he had before experienced. 
When he reflected, however, on the length 
of time Mactalla had been in the service 

of 



THE DISCARDED SON. 175 

of his nobk friends at Acerenza, and the 
high character ihey had given him;, the 
suspicion it awakened of his integrity was 
done away, and in its place the possibility 
there was of his having recognized among 
the banditti some person whom he had for- 
merly known, suggested itself to him â€” 
an idea that gained strength, on his recall- 
ing to his recollection the surprise he had 
suddenly given indications of experiencing 
in the wood. But that any good was like- 
ly to accrue from this circumstance, Os- 
mond could scarcely flatter himself, in 
consequence of his conceiving it scarcely 
possible that any one but a mind incapable 
of a generous action, could be the associate 
of such wretches. 

Harassed by fatigue and agitation, he 
threw himself on a bench near the fire. 
But neither fatigue nor agitation prevent- 
ed his making vigorous efforts to keep 
himself from sinking into utter despair â€” 
efforts, however, which the uninterrupted 
leisure he now had to reflect on his situa- 
I 4 tion. 



176 THB DISCAHDED S05?. 

lion, would hardly have permitted to "be 
successful^ but for the firm reliance he had 
on Providence. 

The shock occasioned by the change in 
it was heightened by the sudden manner in 
"ivhich that change had taken placeâ€” the 
anguish it inspired by the contrast he could 
not help drawing between what it now was 
â– and had been. 

Oh where were now the pleasing hopes, 
the delightful visions he had indulged 
in with almost a certainty of seeing them 
realized ! Gone^ lost, dispersed, without 
leaving aught behind but their aggravat- 
ing remembrance. Yes, the recollection 
of departed joys, like a gloomy ghost, op 
rather a malicious fiend, heightened thÂ« 
horrors of his present situation, by forcing 
him to contrast them with past pleasures. 

At length, from the contemplation of 
wÂ»hat he could not meliorate, he tried to 
detach his thoughts, by surveying the spa- 
cious apartment in which he found him- 
self. 

The 



THE DISCARDED SON. 177 

The imposing grandeur of its appear- 
ance v/as well calculated to do this^ by 
bringing to his recollection the days of 
other years, when doubtless far other 
sounds than now prevailed within it^ 
awoke its echoes. 

'' How humbled is no^v^ this proud edi- 
fice!" he ment-^/ily exclaimed,"^' how de- 
graded its honours ! What a saddenin<j 
conviction does its altered state afford;, of 
the fluctuating nature of all sublunary 
thino;s ! Its towers no lonoer vieldinor re- 
pose to the weary traveller â€” its chambers 
security or peace â€” clamour and intempe- 
rance presiding at its banquets^ â€” and vio- 
lence stalking round its dreary walls '/' 

The sound of a bugle from without in- 
terrupted his meditationsâ€” a sound which 
quickly and in tumultuous disorder brought 
back most of the party that had made him 
prisoner. Tlicy passecl With quickness 
through the hall to meet the new comers, 
consisting of their Captain and several 
com^rades wiihout, and with v.'hom thev

Speedily returned, together with two fe- 
males and a gentleman^ who had just fallen 
into their hands. 

To describe what Osmond felt at this 
moment, at beholding females in the power 
of such ruffians, is impossible. How much 
more so, therefore, to describe what he 
suffered, when, owing to the accidental 
failing back of her veil, he discovered, in 
the features of one of these unhappy la- 
dies, the enchanting features of Miss Ray- 
mond! 

For a minute horror suspended all his 
faculties. Then â€” ' Oh, could it be, was 
it possible," ixi agony he asked himself, 
*' that she, whose beau-y was sufncient to 
make an auchor/.e almost iorget his vows, 
was she in the ptnvcr of a lav;iesi> ban- 
ditti!" 

From an attitude of c'cep despondence 
he was at length roused by toe faint- 
ing of her ritother (as he look it for 
granted tlic other lady was), on the so^t 
which had been pointed out to her on her 
3 entering 



THE DISCARDED SON. 179 

entering the hall. He instantly sprung for- 
ward, forgetful, in his eagerness to render 
her assistance^ of the effect which his sud- 
den and unexpected appearance might per- 
haps have upon Miss Raymond. 

On his approach, she lifted her eyes from 
the inanimate form of her mother, and 
aneeting his, started back, with a look that 
seemed to say f^he was doubtful at the mo- 
ment of the evidence of her senses. Then^ 
in a trembling, an agitated voice â€” '' Gra- 
cious Heaven V she exclaimed, '' do I 
really behold Mr. Munro ? Has he then 
been as unfortunate aa we are ?" 

An expressive look was the only way in 
which Osmond was capable of replying at. 
the inoment to this question. 

Miss Raymond now appearing to recol- 
lect herself a little, replaced her arm under 
the head of her mother, and removM the 
veil with which, like herself, she also was 
covered, to give her air; w^hih.t Osmond, 
regaining the power of speech, entreated 
ia.*:glass of water. This, though neither

Tery speedily nor very graciously, he suc- 
ceeded in obtaining; and by its aid she 
was soon after brought to herself. 

On regaining her senses â€” " Oh, my dear 
mother/' cried her lovely daughter^ as she 
.supported her still drooping head on her 
bosom^ '' we are not alone unfortunate t 
Mr. Munro is equally so ; for he also has- 
fallen into the power (lowering her voice) 
of these wretches/' 

'' Mr. Munro!" repeated her mother^ 
wnth quickness^ and raising her head, she 
turned her eyes full upon Osmond: '' Good 
Heavens, is it possible .^'' 

Osmond bowed respectfully on catching 
her gTance. â€” '' Be assured. Madam/' he 
said, '' I shall cease to regret the circum- 
stance that brought me hither, if it should 
furnish me with an opportunity of render- 
ing you ^any service. At all events, whe- 
ther it should or not, I trust it will be 
some little mitigation of your distress, 
some conrolation to you, to know that 
there is a person at hand who sympathizes 

in 



THE DISCARDED SON. 181 

h\ your sufferings, and would willingly 
risk his life to serve you." 

'' Your countenance convinces me of 
your sincerity/* with a grateful loot re- 
turned Mrs. Raymond ; '' and though I am 
well aware that the acknowledgment is. 
calculated to fi^ten upon me the imputa- 
tion of selfishness, Icanuot help confessing 
that I derive satisfaction from seeing you 
here ; but 'tis natural, and therefore I trust 
in some degree excusable, to be, pleased, in 
the hour of distress, at meeting with those 
who can sympathize with us. I will con- 
strue finding a friend in this terrifying 
place into a favourable omen, and not onlv 
pray but hope that Heaven will deliver us 
in safety from it.'" 

As, from some v/ords which had escaped 
Miss Raymond, Osmond understood the 
gentleman who had been brouoKt in alonor 
with them was Mr. Raymond, he could not 
help being surprised at his not making an 
attempt to afford the least assistance to 
Mrs. Raymond ; and still more on catch- 
lug

ing him, while the above conversation was 
passing, attentively regarding him from 
behind a pillar, wfth (Osmond could not 
help thinking from his attitude, for his 
countenance was completely shaded from 
view by the cape of a great-coat, and a 
large hat) an angry and indignant aspect, 
for which he could not possibly account, 
as he knew he was sufficiently near to dis- 
tinguish his daughter's address to him, and 
of consequence know he did not belong to 
the banditti. 

Osmond was prevented replying to 
Mrs. Raymond by the approach of the 
Captain. He came to inquire whether 
the ladies chose any supper, which, not- 
withstanding the hour, he denominated the 
meal to which he was about sitting down ; 
and on being answered in the negative â€” 
" O very well, ' he exclaimed, with an ait* 
of the most callous indifference ; '' then 
there is no use in your remaining any lon- 
ger here : so hollo, Cesaria â€” I say Cesaria^ 
hollo.^' 

" IlerÂ©^ 



THR DISCARDED SOX. 185 

" Here, noble Captain/' answered an old 
woiTian, limping towards him from a side 
door, with a lamp in one hand, a stick in 
the other, and a large bunch of keys dang- 
ling from her girdle, and so withered and 
so wild in her attire, so perfectly corre- 
sponding with the representation given of 
witches, that if an inhabitant of England 
some hundred years back, Osmond made 
no doubt she would have been com.pelled 
to go through some disagreeable ordeal. 

'' Shew these ladies to their apartments 
in the north tower,'' he resumed ; '' and 
that gentleman," pointing to Mr. Ray- 
mond, who still retained his station at the 
pillar : " as to you, Sir^" glancing at Os- 
mond, " a chamber is prepared for you in 
another part of the building.*' 

Osmond was concerned to hear this ; 
nor were the ladies less s(f. Almost con- 
vinced, however, that to oppose the ar- 
rangement would be useless, they express- 
ed, but by looks^ the discontent it gave 
them . 

"â€¢ Yes, 



ISl THE DISCARDED SON^ 

" Yes^ noble Captain/' said the hag, re- 
plying to her master, and motioning at the 
same time to his fair prisoners to follow 
Ker. 

As Mrs. Raymond rose to obey this mo- 
tion, she kissed her hand, with a look of 
graiitude, to Osmond ; nor did her lovely 
daughter pass him without noticing him 
by a similar one. 

He continued motionless oh the spot 
where she had left him, g^ziug after her ; 
and then when she had entirely disappeared 
from his view^ amidst the remote and clus- 
tered pillars of the hailâ€” invoking all 
those 

" Angels and seraphs who delight in goodness. 
To forsake theii skieg, and to her couch descend," 

until roused from his abstraction by a vio- 
lent pull by the deeve, and the hoarse 
voice of one of the ruffians exclamiing â€” 
" D â€” mn me^, Sir^ are you deaf? I have 
been bawling in your ear this half hour> 

to 



THIS DISCARDED SON. ~1S5 

to know ^vhethe^ you would chuse any 
-supper ?" 

Osmond, sick at heart from the horrid 
fears which had taken possession of him 
respecting Miss Raymond^ replied in the 
negative. 

" Then I presume/* the other rejoined^ 
" you have no objection to retiring t^ 
rest?'* 

Osmond bowed. 

*' Here then, Ossuna/' beckoning to a 
man at some distance, " here, I say ; shew 
the Signor here to one of the chambers off 
the long gallery." 

Ossuna nodded, and approached with a: 
lamp; and at the same moment the other: 
went back to the supper-table, which by 
this time was covered, and about which 
most of the gang had taken their seats, all. 
apparently in high glee. 

But though anxious to retire iVom a scene- 
of such coarseness and riot as the present,. 
Osmond was. withheld from immediately 

quitting

quitting it^ by the surprise he experienced 
at beholding Mactalla, just as Ossuna was 
approaching him, busily employed^ and 
with an air of the greatest satisfaction^ in 
attending on the robbers. 

This sight revived his former suspicioi* 
concerning him, but which his entirely 
yielding to was still opposed by the con- 
sideration of the character he had received 
of hini, and at length usurped by another, 
namely^ cxf his brain being turned by ter- 
ror â€” a suspicion in which the longer he 
attended to him the more he was confirm- 
ed, as nothing could possibly be stranger 
than his grimaces^ or more curious than his 
replies to the questions which from time 
to time the robbers addressed to him. 

'^ What's your name, fellow?" at last 
demanded the Captain, slightly glancing 
at him over his shoulder, as he stood be- 
hind his chair, v^ith a golden goblet in his 
hand. 

" Mactalla, an please your reverence,*^

with a low bow, be replied, although at 
the moment the Captain's back w^as entire- 
ly turned to him. 

" Very well^ then, I say Mr. Mac/' but 
without looking at him^ and with his mouth 
half full, '' I say what are you good for?'* 

" Why, please your reverence, like my 
neighbours^ perhaps not good for a great 
deal: but then (with quickness) I am wii* 
ling." 

" Ha â€” willingness makes amends in some 
degree for want of abilities; but I say â€” I 
suppose you could put your hand to some- 
thing?" 

^* Yes, please your reverence," with a 
rather low bow, though still the eyes of the 
Captain were directed from him, '' to any 
thing you should wish me to lay it on." 

*' Ha, very well, very w^ell, that will do ; 
we want assistants in the menial line, for 
instance in the stables. I suppose you 
could trim a horse?" 

'' Yes, or an ass, please your reverence, 
if one fell in my w^av." 

'' IIa> 



188 THE rUSCARDED SOK. 

" Ha^ ha^, well said, Mr. Mac/^ shouted 
one of the party â€” *' here's my service t^ 
you, and let me tell you 'lis not here you'll 
be likely to meet with one/' 

*' Yes, yes, it must be so,'* said Osmond^ 
mentally, and with a deep sigh, as he mo- 
tioned Ossuna to lead the way from the 
hall; '' yes, yes, 'tis too evident that fear 
has deranged liis intellects. Unhappy crea- 
ture \ and yet he is not so great an object 
of compassion as at the first glance one 
Blight be led to imagine ; for doubtlesa 
the keenness of his feelings is blunted by 
the state to which he is reduced." 

From the hall Osmond was conducted 
through several winding passages to a spa- 
cious staircase of oval form, terminating 
in a lon^ fcallerv, near the extremitv of 
which Ossuna opened a door, and bade him 
enter, presenting iiim at the same time 
with the lamp he had hitherto carried. 
Osmond obeyed, and immediately after 
heard the door loclicd on the outside. 
Left to himself, he elevated the lamp, m 

ordev 



THE DISCARDED SON. j 89 

order to be better enabled to see about 
him, and found himself within a large bed- 
chamber, with two other doors half open 
in it. Curiosity and suspicion inducing 
him to examine beyond these, he found 
they merely led into small cabinetSj to 
which there appeared no other means of 
obtaining admission than what they af- 
forded. His examination of these over, 
he resolved on admitting the light of day, 
if possible, into his apartment; but to his 
infinite mortification, soon found that all 
the spaces formerly occupied by latti.ces 
were now blocked up with closely-cement- 
ed stones. 

Compelled to be content with the sickly 
light of the lamp, he placed it on an old- 
fashioned dressing-table, and threw himself 
into an equally old-fashioned chair be^i4c 
it^ unable to rest, or rather shuddering 
with horror at the thoughts of resigning 
himself to repose, from the dreadful iip- 
prehensions with which he was tormented 
about Miss Raymond. 

-^'Oh, 



190 THE DISCARDED SOJf. 

'' Ohj should these soul-harrowing ap- 
prehensions be realized ! " he wildly cried* â€” 
he paused, he startedâ€”'' Even now â€” even 
now/' with greater emotion, he exclaimed, 
*' they may be on the point of being so â€” 
even now some ruffian may be stalking to 
her chamber â€” even now, regardless of 
their mingling shrieks, be tearing her from 
the arms of her mother, the grasp of her 
father!" 

His veins swelled, his temples throbbed, 
every limb shook with agitation, as this 
dreadful idea suggested itself to his imagi- 
nation. With a glaring eye he searched 
round the chamber, in hope of discovering 
some weapon of defence ; but nothing 
met it but mouldering furniture and dark 
wainscotting, destitute of any ornament, 
but here and there a fragment of tapestry. 
He then proceeded to the door, and tried 
to force it, for the purpose of going in 
quest of the north tower, and risking his 
life, if necessary, in uniting with the fa- 
ther to try and preserve the daughter; but 

it 



THE DISCARDED SON. 191 

it resisted all his efforts to wrench it from 
the hinges. 

With suspended breath he then listened 
attentively at it ; but no sigh, no scream, 
no shriek of distress met his ear. A death- 
like stillness prevailed throughout, but a 
stillness from which he derived no conso- 
lation, when he reflected that, from the 
magnitude of the building, the most atro- 
cious deeds might be perpetrated at one 
end, without those at the other having the 
smallest intimation of them. 

At length the impossibility of accom- 
plishing his wishes in the present instance 
induced him to endeavour to calm the 
apprehensions to which they were owing. 
He called his reason, his religion, his for- 
titude to his aid. He reflected, that she 
for whose safety he was so agonized, was 
under the special protection of a divine 
Being â€” of Him, whose angels watch over 
the couch of innocence and virtue â€” of 
Him, whose eye, whose ear, was never 

closed : 



193 THE DISCARDED SO!f. 

closed; who was at once omniscient and 
omnipresent. 

As hiÂ« confidence in Heaven revived, 
the tumult of his spirits, the burning heat 
of his brain, subsided. He quitted the 
door; and though the appearance of the 
bed was extremely uninviting â€” its long 
dingy curtains of dark-green velvet, and 
moth-eaten coverlid of the same, giving it 
a sepulchral air, chilling to the feelings â€” 
threw himself upon it, but without taking 
off any of his cloaths. 

But instead of courting sleep, he now 
busied himself in recalling to his recollec- 
tion all that had passed between him and 
the fair Cordelia in the hall; in reflecting 
on the enquiries she must have made, the 
conversations she must have held respect- 
ing him, to be acquainted with his name, 
and render it also so familiar to her mo- 
ther': but the idea that to curiosity alone 
both might be owing, checked the hopes 
they might otherwise have given birth to. 

That 



THE DISCARDED SON. 195 

That it was either from the Marchesa 
Morati or Lady Elizara she had learnt who 
he wa5> he could not doubt ; and he felt 
happy at the idea^ from his conviction of 
their favourable sentiments for him â€” until 
he reflected^ that perhaps it was solely 
owing to the flattering terms in which he 
had been mentioned to her, and to no 
prepossession in his favour, that he was 
indebted for the notice she had taken of 
him. 

^' But how ungenerous to wish her to 
feel such a prepossession â€” to wish her to 
harbour sentiments which could not fail of 
being productive of regret, of uneasiness 
to her, so great are the obstacles, so little 
the likelihood of their ever being over- 
come, which fortune has placed between 
us/' He reflected â€” ''Henceforth it shall 
be my study to suppress such a wish, to 
avoid her society as much as possible. Ah 
Heavens ! how idly do I talk ! how strange- 
ly do I forget our present situation I Per- 

voL, III. K haps 



194 â€¢ tHE DISCARDED SOK. 

hnps I shall be but too soon convinced 
that I shall never have another opportunity 
of beholding her/' 

The anguish imparted by this thought^ 
since he could not conquer, he at length 
strove to lose in sleep; but the repose he 
courted his perturbed imagination would 
not permit him to enjdy.. Though his eyes 
were closed, frightful and disjointed visions 
harassed and perplexed him : from one of 
these he was suddenly rouzed by a noise 
outside the chamber door, but which, for a 
minute or two, he knew not whether to 
imagine ideal or not. 

At length convinced his ear had not de- 
ceived him, and that it was occasioned by 
some one endeavouring to unlock it in 
siuch a way as should prevent their being 
6verheard, he softly quitted the bed, and> 
approaching the door, applied his eye to 
the keyhole, but involuntarily started back 
on doing so, in consequence of perceiving 
bh'e apparently on fire, and of more than 

human 



THE DISCARDED SON. 19S 

human size, glaring througK it. A mo- 
ment's reflection, however, by enabling 
him to account for the extraordinary ap- 
pearance of this eye, which was intirely 
owing to an oblique light interposing be- 
tween it and the door, made him smile at 
himself for having done so, and apply his^ 
again to the aperture; on doing which, 
he distinguished two men, the hand of one 
upon the key, and to whose cautious ef- 
forts to open it the door at length gave 
way; and Osmond retreating behind it, de- 
termined at least to have a struggle for his 
life; for that it had been opened in this 
manner for the purpose of dispatching 
him while he (as it v*as imagined) dept^ 
he had not the remotest doubt. 

The men on advancing a few paces in 
the chamber, stopt, and the foremost of 
them, who carried a lanthorn, emitting just 
a sufficient ray to permit their persons to be 
visible, exclaimed^ in a whispering voice, 
after listening attentively a few minutes â€” 
'' Aye, aye, he is fast asleep, little dream- 
K 2 ing,

ing, I warranty of what is about happening 
to him.'* 

'' No, I dare say not/' replied the other, 
in the same low key ; '' but come, I'll be 
oflf^ as you say you don't want my assist- 
ance ; but take care you don't neglect 
making a proper use of the present oppor- 
tunity for quieting him ; such another 
may not occur again. In less than half an 
hour I shall expect to hear that you have 
settled his business properly." 

A significant nod was the only reply he 
received ; and retiring, his companion se- 
cured the door with the same caution with 
which he had opened it; after which^ with 
noiseless steps, he approached the bed. 

Within a few paces of it, a sudden ele- 
vation of the lanthorn causing the light 
to fall full on his features, those of Mac- 
talla became visible to the astonished Os- 
mond. 

All his former suspicions of him instant- 
ly revived. He no longer doubted his 
being an accomplice of the banditti â€” no 

longer 



THE DISCARDED SON. 197 

longer doubted his having betrayed him 
into their power^ and nov/ undertaken the 
horrid task of murdering him. 

'' Dear and amiable Marchesa/' he invo- 
luntarily exclaimed to himself, " little did 
you imagine what a fatal present you were 
making m.e : but he shall not â€” no, the vil- 
lain shall not quietly triumph in his wick- 
edness; he shall at least experience the 
shame of detection/' And* Osmond was 
springing forwards, when a kind of fearful 
curiosity to see what steps he would take, 
on finding the bed vacated, suddenly with- 
held him. 

Having placed the lanthorn on the floor, 
Mactalla, gently opening the side curtains, 
thrust his head between, and continued 
for a minute in a listening attitude; then^ 
drawing from his bosom what seemed to 
be a glittering dagger, he appeared to 
plunge it repeatedly into the bed. 

Osmond's feelings, no longer control- 
able, he was again on the point of rushing 
on him, when again he was prevented by 
K 3 a sudden 



.V9S THE DISCARDED .SON. 

a sudden exclamation of â€” " Oh, holy St. 
Benedict ! I am ruined â€” I am deceived ! 
I have trusted in a villain, and he has un- 
done me ! Yes/' he continued, snatching 
up the lamp/and tearing open the curtains, 
'' he has made away with him himself, and 
that not a minute ago; ft)r (laying his 
hand upon it) the bed is still warm: but 
ril be revenged â€” yes. Til be revenged on 
you, you deceitful villain, though 1 should 
lose my life for being so," â€” hastily ad- 
vancing as he spoke towards the door. 

" Hold, my friend, hold," cried Osmond, 
interposing as cautiously as possible be- 
tween him and it, and with forced calm- 
ness, the sudden transition from despair to 
hope, suspicion to confidence, occasioning 
him no less emotion than had his late 
dreadful apprehensions, and also no little 
remorse, for ever having doubted the in- 
tegrity of Mactalla, notwithstanding the 
sufficient excuse he had had for doing so. 

'' Is it you â€” is it yourself that I hear ?" 
cried Mactalla, in a transport of joy, which, 

had 



THE DISCARDED SON. 199 

had a doubt to his prejudice still lingered 
in the mind of Osmond, would have com- 
pletely dissipated it, elevating the lanthorn 
to his face as he spoke, in order to assure 
himself he was not mistaken â€” '' Blessed be 
the Powders above for your being still alive 
and safe. I thought Felisco had done your 
business for you ; for evil communication, 
they say, corrupts good manners : but by 
the Lord if he had, it should have been the 
worst business for him he ever had a hand 
in." 

*^ Pray explain the recent scene," said 
Osmond^ advancing from the door, and 
motioning for him also to quit it, '' which 
I confess alarmed me not a little.'* 

"â–  I cannot tell you particulars now,'* 
replied Mactalla ; *' I can only tell you 
that in the course of the night you shall 
be informed of what you are so desirous to 
hear â€” 'tis now getting late." 

''Later' interrupted Osmond, not a little 
surprised. " Is it possible I can have slept 
so long.'^" 

K 4 '' 'Tis 



200 THE DISCARDED SON. 

" ^Tis very true indeed/' rejoined Mac* 
talla ; " 'tis as I have alreadv told vou, late, 
and such of the gang as intend being upon 
the pro^vl to-night are already off. As 
soon as I leave you, repair to the hall, 
â€¢where you'll find refreshments ready for 
you. After partaking of these, express a 
wish for a little air; and on descending to 
the court, turn \o the right, and keep in 
that direction till you come io an arched 
gateway : pass through it, and a little be- 
yond it, at the left side, you'll perceive a 
narrow passage ; there remain till I come 
to you. Should any one inquire by what 
means it was you got out of your cham- 
ber, say Felisco opened the door for you, 
which will be readily believed, as he often 
has the charge of the prisoners." 

" Hold," cried Osmond, catching hira 
by the sleeve, in order to prevent his im- 
mediately quitting him, as, upon laying 
the lanthorn upon the table to supply 
the place of the lamp, which had long been 
extinguished, he was about doing â€” ''' Can 

vou 



THE DISCARDED SON. 20 1 

you give me any information of the other 
prisoners the banditti made last night ?" 

'*â–  Me, no â€” I know of no other than 
ourselves." 

Osmond then informed him. 

After staring at him for a minute with 
a vacant look â€” " You are joking," cried 
he. 

'^ Noj I am serious indeed/' returned 
Osmond ; " Mr. Raymond and his family 
are now in the same unhappy situation 
that we are." 

" Well, ril enquire of Felisco about 
them." 

'' Who is this FeiiscO;, whom you have 
so often mentioned to me â€” this man with 
whom you appear to be so intimate here P" 

" "Bye and bye you shall hear all. Sig- 
ner; but at present 1 cannot gratify your 
curiosity." 

'* Well, do not fail to make the inquiries 
you have promised, and endeavour to 
learn the way to the north tower." 

Mactalla^ as if impatient to be gonc^ 
Ik 5 oiily. 



202 THE DISCARDED SOt?. 

only nodded, and then vanished from llie 
room. 

Osmond remained for some minutes after 
hirn in a most painful state of anxiety and 
suspense, owing to the vague hopes and 
expectations which his words had given 
rise to; for unsatisfactory as they were, 
still Osmond clearly comprehended from 
them that, a scheme was in agitation for 
their deliverance. 

As soon as he had a little collected him- 
self, he quitted his chamber, but without 
faking the lanthorn, the gallery beyond it 
admitting the light of day. He had not 
advanced a great way down this, when the 
sight of some steps he had not noticed be- 
fore inclined him to believe he had mis- 
taken his wav, and he was thinking of re- 
tracing it, for t\\Q purpose of trying to de- 
tect his error, when, casting his eyes for- 
ward, he beheld a staircase to the left, 
which induced him to advance; and thoug*h 
on gaining this he found it was not the 
one he had ascended to the gallery, still 
3 concluding 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2f)3* 

concluding it led to the hall, he ventured 
to go down it. As he proceeded, he could 
not forbear pausing to admire its singular 
form, expanding towards the top like a 
far, and the richness of its sculptured walls 
and cornices, and which led him to believe 
it had formerly been the principal staircase 
â€” a belief in which he was confirmed on 
finding it terminated in an immense rotunda, 
covered with a majestic dom.e restina: on 
rows of marble pillars, and from which 
several, passages branched off in various 
directions. This magnificent apartment 
opened by means of several folding-doors, 
now more than half demolished, to the 
hanging wood, which, on his approach to 
the edifice, liad caught the attention of 
Osmond, and over which the setting sun 
now shed a mellow lustre, that rendered 
still m.ore picturesque their appearance. 
Osmiond eagerly advanced to one of these 
openings, to inhale the fresh breeze that 
sighed through the waving foliage, and 
gaze for an instant upon the romantic sce- 
\ 6 nery 



204 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ncry before him. Almost insensibly the 
contemplation of this calmed his spirits, 
and, \vrapt in the pensive musings it in- 
spired, he might perhaps have continued 
some time, had he not suddenly recollected 
his appointment with Mactalla. 

He re-ascendedj as he thought, the stair- 
case he had come down ; but a door at the 
top convinced him he was wrong. 

Fearful of being involved in the intri- 
cate passages below, he knocked at this 
door, for the purpose of trying whether 
any one was within, that he might enquire 
his way to the hall. 

A voice immediately replied â€” to which 
his heart vibrated â€” the soft, the melo- 
dious voice of Miss Raymond. She de- 
sired him to come in. With a hand trem- 
bling with agitation, he immediately tried 
to open the door; but it resisted his effort 
â€” there was a key in it â€” he tried again, and 
was more successful. 

He found both mother and daughter 
near it, evidently watching with looks of 

anxiety 



THE DISCARDED SON. 205 

anxiety and terror for the appearance of 
the person who had demanded admissioD-. 
The most joyful surprise appeared in the 
countenance of both at seeing him. 

'' Good Heavens ! Mr. Munro," delight- 
edly exclaimed Mrs. Raymond^ eagerly ap- 
proaching him as she spoke^, and present- 
ins her hand with the familrar and affec- 
tionate air of an old friend^ '' is it you I 
behold? How did you discover where we 
were ?'* 

'â€¢' By chance/*' replied Osmond, eagerly 
taking her profiered hand and pressing his 
lips to it, his eyes, however, a little wan- 
dering from her towards her lovely daugh- 
ter; "but a chance which 1 shall for evei' 
bless, since it affords me an opportunity 
of quieting, in some degree, the appre- 
hensions you must be under, by inform- 
ing you that I think there is a hope of our 
being able to effect our escape.'' 

He then, in a lower voice, and as briefly 
as possible, gave her the particulars of his 
recent conversation with his servant, and 

ended. 



20G THE DISCARDED SON. 

ended by solemnly assuring her, except 
their deliverance could be effected as well 
as his, nothing should induce him to quit 
the place. 

Mrs. Raymond listened to him with pro- 
found attention, and was evidently on the 
point of replying to this assurance, when 
Mr. Raymond prevented her, by exclaim- 
ing, in the most ungracious accent, from 
the lovr'cr end of the room, which was 
long, and had once been magnificent, and 
at which he stood by an open lattice, with 
bis back towards the door â€” '' Sir, your in- 
terference relative to us is not necessary : 
we have the means of effecting our deli- 
verance in our own hands/' 

Astonished and confused by this speech> 
Osmond for a minute could only gaze at 
the ungr^xious person from whom it pro- 
ceeded, and Mrs. Raym.ond, as if to ask the 
occasion of it. He was then on the point 
of exculpating himself from the charge of 
cfficiousiiess, of which he conceived it in- 
flirectly accused him, when Mrs. Raymond 

prevented! 



THE DISCARDED SOX. g07 

prevented what he would have said by 
eagerly exclaiming â€” '' My â€” Mr. Raymond^ 
I mean/* hesitating a little^ and colouring 
as if confused^ by having been on the point 
of saying something she should not, '' has 
merely said what he did^ to prevent your 
having any unnecessary trouble on our ac- 
count. Vve" â€” 

''^ Ah^ Madam/' involuntarily interrupted 
Osmond, " I could never consider as a 
trouble any thing I did for you or yours. 
Great, hov/ever, as is the happiness I should 
h.ave derived from having had the pow'er 
of rendering you a service, I sincerely re- 
joice, from the conviction it affords me of 
your safety, that in the present instance 
none is required from me.'' 

Mrs. Raymond bowed her thanks. â€” 
'' About two hours ago," cried she, '' the 
Captain of the banditti entered this apart- 
ment, to inform us that we should be re- 
stored to liberty, and conducted in safety 
to the place we wish to go to, provided, in 
addition to what he has already received 

fronv 



208 THE DISCARDED SON. 

from us, he obtained the further sum of a 
thousand pounds. Mr. Raymond eagerly 
embraced this proposal, and has given him 
a draft on a banker in Naples, to whom 
the letter of credit he brought with him 
from England has been transmitted. With 
this draft a man was immediat-ely dis- 
patched ; and as soon as he returns, we 
are to be liberated. Heaven grant that the 
same moment may see us all beyond these 
walls ; for should you remain behind, my 
joy at our restoration to liberty will be not 
a little damped, especially as I rather ap- 
prehend, from the .Captain having laid us 
under no injunction of secrecy with re- 
spect to his haunt, that there is but little 
likelihood of our being able to describe it 
to those who could effect your deliverance 
from it.'^ 

" For your generous anxiety for that, 
accept my acknowledgments. Madam,'' 
cried Osmond; " I trust I shall be success- 
ful in the efforts I shall myself make for 
it;^ but should I be disappointed, trust n^ 

I shall. 



THE DISCARDED SON. 209 

I shall Still derive the greatest consolation 
from the idea of your safety/' 

'' So I am convinced/' replied Mrs. Ray- 
mond ; '' for the liberal heart can never 
be solely engrossed by selfish anxiety." 

" Psha, psha, have done with this sen- 
timental stuff!" exclaimed Mr. Raymond^ 
still with his back turned towards Osmond^ 
and in the same tone in which he had be- 
fore spoken ; *' and kt that gentleman re- 
tire ; for should he be surprised here, dis- 
agreeable consequences may ensue froiu. 
the circumstance."

nation, 'â€¢' I am to blame for not having

gentle pressure, resigning the hand of Mrs. 
Raymond, " farewell,. Madam/' he added ; 
^' should we never meet again"

idea," eagerlv interrupting him, and turn- 
ing pale; "remember that to doubt the

goodness of Providence is to merit not 
experiencing it/' 

Osmond bowed. â€” ^' Be assured. Madam/' 
fie said, '' I do not despair:" then, repeat- 
ing his adieu, and casting a lingering look 
at Miss Raymond, who, evidently in a state 
of the greatest agitation, he saw moving 
towards a seat, he retreated. 

Scarcely had he regained the rotunda, 
when a man, with a drawn sword, rushed 
out upon him, from one of the passages^ 
and fiercely demanded what had brought 
him there ? 

Osmond, but stepping back a few paces, 
replied, in repairing to the hall he had 
mistaken his way. 

^' Mistaken your way V* echoed the 
other; '' hav'nt you eyes?" 

'^ Certainly," with calmness, returned 
Osmond ; " but the possession of our 
senses does not always keep us from 
error." 

''V7ell, I'll put you right this once; but 
beware how you go astray again ; for in 

this

this house we don't like people to he 
poking their noses into all the holes and 
corners." 

He accordingly ]ed him through several 
intricate avenues to the hall, at the en- 
trance of which he lei^t him. Here Os- 
mond found two ill-looking fellows, em- 
ployed in trimming the lamps and light- 
ing them, one of whom pointed out a table 
to him spread with refreshments, of which, 
however, the anxiety and perturbation he 
was in at the moment scarcely permitted 
him to partake. 

The moment his slight repast was over^ 
he expressed a wish, agreeably to the in^ 
structions of Macialla, to go into the air ; 
to which no opposition being made, he 
quitted the hall, but with an injunction to 
beware, as the night was coming on, of the 
ruinous parts of the building ; and by a 
noble flight of marble steps, covered with 
a spacious portico, and adorned on either 
side with antique statues of colossal size, 
he descended into the court. 

Had 



THE. DISCARDED SO N. 213 

Had he been in a happier frame of mind, 
he would have derived inexpressible plea- 
sure from the soft and shadowy scene that 
prevailed witliout. The moon, already 
risen, held her way 

** Through skies where he could count each little star ;*' 

and nought but the rustling of the trees in 
the breeze of night, and the vvailings of 
the birds that lodged in the grass-grown 
and mouldering battlements of the build- 
ing, was to be heard. 

As it was, he felt himself somewhat re- 
vived, and^ owing to the better hopes with 
which his recent interview with Mactalla 
had inspired him, and the dismission of his 
apprehensions concerning the Raymonds^ 
tranquillized by it. 

He readily found the place to which he 
had been directed; the arch led into a 
court, open at the further end to the cliffs^ 
and bounded on one side by a noble terrace, 
and the other by a decayed building, 

through 



214 THE DISCARDED SON. 

through the centre of which extended the 
narrow-vaulted, and now obscure passage, 
in which Mactalla had appointed to meet 
him. 

Here, as he awaited his joining him, he 
involuntarily, and with a degree of asto- 
nishment, revolved the variety of strange 
events he had met with since his departure 
from his native country â€” the various agi- 
tating changes his feelings had undergone, 
from despondence to hope, hope to ap- 
}3rehension. Had he foreseen all that had 
since befallen him, he could not avoid 
thinking he should have shrunk from the 
perspective ; and this idea made him more 
than ever admire and glorify the wisdom 
and goodness of the Creator, in keeping 
from his creatures a knowledge of the fu- 
ture, and thus preventing the strength and 
spirits requisite to support them beneath 
the pressure of misery from being ex- 
hausted by anticipations of it â€” anticipa- 
tions of what is ever almost more terrific 
in imagination than reality : for, as an 

elegant 



THE DISCARDED SON. ?I5 

elegant author observes, '' As there is no 
prosperous state of life without its cala- 
mities, so there is no adversity without its 
benefits. Ask the great and powerful if 
they do not feel the pangs of envy and 
ambition ? Enquire of the poor and needy 
if they have not tasted the sweets of quiet 
and contentment ? Even under the pains 
of body, the infidelity of friends, or the 
misconstructions put upon our laudable 
actions^ our minds (when for some time 
accustomed to these pressures) are sensible 
of secret flo wings of comfort, the present 
reward of a pious resignation. The evils 
of this life appear like rocks and preci- 
pices, rugged and barren at a distance ; 
but, at our nearer approach, we find little 
fruitful spots and refreshing springs, mixed 
with the harshness and deformities of na- 
ture.'* 

While Osmond mused in this manner, a 
ray of light suddenly gleamed across the 
passage; and hastily turning his head, he 

beheld. 



216 THE DISCARDED SON. 

beheld, through a chink in the wall against 
which he was leaning, a human counte- 
nance earnestly regarding him. 

Startled at this incident, lest his having 
been discovered in such a place should 
give birth to dangerous suspicions, he in- 
stantly determined onquittingit, and watch- 
ing near it if he could find a spot to secrete 
himself, for the approach of Mactalla. 

He accordingly hurried from it, and, at 
some distance, shrunk into a dusky recess 
he espied in the wall. Here he had not 
been many minutes, when he plainly dis- 
tinguished approaching steps, and as plain- 
ly those of more than one person â€” a cir- 
cumstance which induced him to believe 
he was sought after, in consequence of 
having been discovered in the passage, 
especially when he heard, in a minute 
after, a strange voice exclaiming â€” " Yes, 
yes, I am positive I saw him ;" â€” to which 
another, but in a much lower key, replied â€” 
*' No such thing, I am certain ; your eyes 

doubtless 



THE DISCARDED SOX. 217 

doubtless deceived 5^011.'* In consequence 
of which assertion^ the other immediately 
cried â€” '' Then curse me if I sleep till I 
have convinced you to the contrary. 
There's not a hole or crevice which I will 
not search for him ; and when I have dis- 
covered him, I think I shall be able to 
make him speak the truth." 

This declaration induced Osmond to con- 
tract himself into as small a space as pos- 
sible. His efforts to conceal himself were 
however unavailing. The men advanced, 
darted their eyes into the recess, and in- 
stantly stopt â€” he whom Osmond had first 
heard speak exclaiming as they did soâ€” 
'' He is here, he is here!'* 

Osmond, finding himself discovered, im- 
mediately came forward to meet, with con- 
rai^e whatever mii^ht ensue. Instead, how/- 
ever, of meeting with any thing disagree- 
able, as he rather expected would be the 
case, he was most agreeably surprised at 
perceiving the other man was Mactalla, as, 
from this circumstance, he at once con^

eluded the former to be his friend ; in 
which conclusion he quickly found he was 
Bot mistaken." 

" This, Signor/' cried' Mactalla, after he 
had expressed the satisfaction his not fail- 
ing in his appointment gave him, which, 
from his not finding him where they had set- 
tled to meet, he was rather apprehensive 
of his doing, notwithstanding the positive 
assurances of his companion, who was sta- 
tioned to watch for him, of having seen 
him there, â€” "is Felisco, the young man of 
whom" 

'' Hold, hold, Mactalla," interrupted his 
friend, '' recollect this is no place to con- 
verse in.*' 

" True,'* cried the other, nodding, *' I 
foro^ot that. Conduct us to one where w^e 
shall run no risk of being o\'erheard." 

Felisco obeyed by conducting them to 
a small room in the remotest and most 
intricate part of the deserted wing they 
were then near. 

'' Blessed St. Benedict !** exclaimed Mac- 

talla. 



THE DISCARDED SON, 219 

talkj with an air of satisfaction, as soon as 
they entered, '' but this is a snug place to 
settle a plot in â€” Guy Fawkes himself could 
not have had a better*â€” and by the bye, 
now that I have mentioned him, it would 
be a good thing to lay such a one as he 
did, and send, in the mo-,t expeditious 
manner possible, this old castle, and some 
forty or fifty of its inhabitants, to the de- 
vil." 

'^ Mactalla, you forget that time is pre- 
cious,'' said his master. 

'' True, Signor, true ; pray pardon me. 
Joy at the thoughts of being able to make 
our escape has put me nearly beside my- 
self; but to lose no more time â€” You re- 
collect, I dare say, the story I told you, as 
we travelled along, of the village of Tcs- 
sino?" 

*' Perfectly," replied Osmond. 

'*' Well, Signor, this is he, the identical 
person," laying, as he spoke, his hand upon 
the shoulder of his companion, '' who in- 
nocently occasioned the destruction of its

inhabitants, my old acquaintance and good 
friend Felisco, as he has proved himself^ 
by promising to deliver us^ if possible, 
from this infernal place/' 

'^ Time does not permit me to explain/* 
said Felisco, on Mactalla's pausing and 
motioning him to speak, "" the circum- 
stances which caused me to become an in- 
mate here. Suffice it to say, Signor, they 
were such as, if known to you, (which, at 
some future period, if agreeable to you, 
they shall) would, I trust, in some degree, 
excuse my having done so, and prevent 
your feeling any unwillingness to trusting 
yourself to my guidance. Previous to 
vour beino: brouoht hither, I was medi- 
tating my a^yn escape, having long since 
sincerely repented my ever having asso- 
ciated with such w^retches. To-morrow 
night will, I think, furnish a favourable 
opportunity for effecting this, and of 
course yours; as the whole of the gang, 
except such as ^re required to keep watch, 
and myself, owing to my pretending to

have a sore ]eg, will be out, in consequence 
of information received from their scouts^ 
of rich travellers being expected on the 
road. The care of the stables chiefly de- 
volves on me ; and as the lawn is enclosed, 
I frequently turn out the horses not im- 
mediately required, and let them remain 
there all night : so that as I shall do this 
to-morrow, we shall find no difficulty in 
procuring them. Our principal one will 
arise from the centinels, of whom there 
are never less than seven, three to go the 
rounds of the castle on the inside, two on 
the outside, and two to keep watch at the 
portal at the outer court.'' 

'' No matter, no matter,*' eagerly ex- 
claimed Osmond ; '' for the prize in view 
there is no hazard too great to run ; but 
tell meâ€” tell me, my friend, do you think 
the other prisoners will be liberated by that 
time ?" 

^' Liberated V* repeated Felis'co, in ac- 
cents indicative of surprise; ^' I understand

you not. Signer. What put it in your 
head that they were to be liberated ?" 

Osmond hastily informed him. 

''^Alas! Signer/' in reply, said Felisco, 
*' they are grossly imposed upon : beyond 
those walls there is not the remotest hope 
of their ever getting/' 

'' How !" cried Osmond, almost aghast 
With horror, '' imposed upon, say you ?" 

" Yes, most grossly, I repeat : but com- 
pose yourself. Sign or, and I'll briefly ex- 
plain what I mean. Know, then, that the 
tajiditti of this^place, instead of immedi- 
ately putting to death those who are so 
unfortunate as to fall into their hands, as 
most pf the fraternity ^o, generally bring 
them hither prisoners, for the purpose of 
adding to their spoils, by extorting money 
from them as a ransom. Their mode is to 
prcc;;rÂ£ a draft from them on some agent, 
relative, or banker, for as Im'ge a sura as

distant town, and accompanied by a letter^, 
calculated to prevent any suspicion of its 
being unfairly obtained. The moment in- 
formation of this being honoured is ob- 
tained, the unhappy dupe from whom it 
was procured, under a positive assurance 
of its obtaining him his liberty, is sacrificed 
to the safety of the gang. You, Signor,, 
ere this, would have been troubled for 
something of the kind, but that owing to 
my being more than commonly interested 
about you, in consequence of your con- 
nection with my friend Mactalla. here, 
whom I recollected the instant I saw -nin 
in the wood, I told the Captain, from a 
conversation I overheard between you and 
your servant, I was well convinced, if he ma- 
naged matters properly, he might prevail 
on you to join his troop." 

'' The execrable villain !'* cried Osmond ; 

'' no wonder indeed he did not lay the 

unhappy family under any injunction of 

secresy as to his retreat, knowing, as he 

L 4 did. 



224 THE DISCARDED SON. 

did, that it was his intention never to let 
them escape from it. But, my friend/' 
eagerly grasping the arm of Felisco, 
'' cannot you devise some scheme to ena- 
ble them to accompany us? Except you 
save them â€” except you contrive that they 
should be the companions of our flight, 
you need make no effort for my deliver- 
ance/' 

^' By his'Holiness's great toe, you know 
not v>hat you require, Signor/' somewhat 
impatiently returned Felisco; ""one might 
almost as well attempt to run away with 
the Vatican as attempt to liberate those 
prisoners. Exactly at sun-set, a m.an goes 
up to see that the entrance to their apart- 
ments is secured in such a way as to put it 
out of the power of anv one to give them 
egress from them, lest, if they obtained 
this, they should take it into their heads to 
ramble about the courts, and thus occasion 
the trouble of a search.'* 

The despair into which (his statement 

threw 



THE DISCARDED SON. 225 

threw him^ now completely overcame Os- 
mond. A film overspread his eyes^ his ears 
rung with hollow murmurs, he staggered^ 
and would have fallen, but for the quick- 
ness of Mactalla in catching him. 

" The damps of this infernal place have 
made him ill/' said Mactalla, ^Ts he sup- 
ported him; ^^ be quick, Felisco, in finish- 
ing what further you have to say, that he 
may leave it." 

'^ No, no,'* cried Osmond, coming a little 
to himself, and raisinor his head from the 
shoulder of Mactalla, â€” '' no, no," wiping 
away the cold dew of sickness aiul dismny 
from his forehead, '' 'tis horror at the situ- 
ation of the devoted prisoners. Tell me," 
again addressing Felisco, '' is iiere no 
other entrance but the one which I dis- 
covered, to their apartments?" 

Felisco looked earnestly at him, but he- 
sitated to reply. 

'^ Oh, for Heaven's sake !" supplicated 
Osmond in agony, " do not keep me in 
suspense." 

** Well; Signer, I acknowledge there rs ;

not for a long while been opened/' 

" No matter, no 'r>ai:ter/' cried Gs.^Tond, 
*â– ' furnish :ne br.t v> -rh the n^eans of enter- 
ing them, and I shall lor ever bless you/' 

" Well, Signor, ^you siiall be granfied. 
As soon as the return of the Captain to- 
morrow permits me to enter tue room 
where all the keys not immediately wanted 
are deposited, I'll search tor the ones you 
require^ and bring them to you. Heaven 
grant you may succeed in your generous 
undertaking; but I miich Tear you will

'* Well, well, no matter," replied Os- 
mond, '' it must be of sinoular construe- 
tion indeed, if it escape the diligent search 
I shall make for it/' 

*' At all events there's no use in playing 
the part of a raven, Fclisco/'' obser\ed 

Mactalla, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 227 

Mactalla^, fearful of the effect which being 
again plunged into despair might have 
upon his master. 

'' Nay/' interrupted Osmond, fearful Fe- 
lisco might be piqued by this observation, 
'' 'tis natural for him to speak his appre- 
hensions/' 

" I gave utterance to them out of a good 
motive^ I assure you, Signor â€” to prevent 
your disappointment being too greats 
should you be unfortunate enough to 
meet with one; if successful, depend 
upon it I'll do every things in my power 
to facilitate the accomplishment of your 
wishes/' 

'' Ten thousand thanks for your kind- 
ness," said Osmond; '' completely would 
it have lightened my heart, but for the 
unhappy beings in question. I will not, 
however, give v/ay to despair about them. 
I have seen too many proofs of the good- 
ness of Providence to permit me "to doubt 
it in the present instance; if it be its will

tbey shcr-iy escape the iaipending danger, 
I know they will, though walls of brass, 
and hosts of armed men, encompassed 
them/* 

" No doubt/' cried Felisco ; '' if we did 
not indeed place confidence in the good- 
ness of Heaven, we should be ill able to 
bear manv things that happeri in life/' â€” 
Then, after a transient pause, he added, 
as they had not any thing further of mo- 
ment to converse on at present, they had 
better separate, lest a suspicion of their 
being together should be excited, and thus 
perhaps give rise to others that might be 
dangerous. 

To the propriety of this measure, Os- 
mond laimediately assented; but at the 
same time enquired whether there was a 
necessity for his returning yet awhile to 
the house ? 

*' By no means," Felisco replied, ^' as in 
the first place the night was here literally 
turned into day, and in the second, the 

light 



THE DiscATir^ED so^^ 229 

Ilffht in which he had rcDresented him (o 
the gang, left him at fiill liberty to pursue 
his inclination/' 

" He should then remain some time 
longer out/' Osmond said^ ^' as he v;as at 
present in too perturbed a state of mind 
to allow of his remaining quietly in one 
place/' 

'' Very well, Signor, as you please/' an- 
swered Felisco, taking, as he spoke, the 
arm of Mactalla, to make him accompany 
him to the hall, not conceiving it prudent 
to let him rem.ain with his master. 

'' But that's true/' said Osmond, sud- 
denly recollecting the circumstance, and 
detaining Felisco a few minutes longer, in 
order to have it explained to him, '' I 
nearly forgot to mention the alarm which 
some part of Mactalla 's conduct in my 
chamber gave me/' 

He then related what this was ; and in 
reply learnt, that, like Macbeth, he had 
seen but an ideal dagger ; the instrument 
which he took for one in the hand of Mac- 
talla

talla being but a kev, entrusted to him by 
Feliseo, for tlie purpose of admitting him- 
self into a remote part of the building, in 
which he had appointed to meet him^ after 
his interview with his master, and which, 
for the better securing, Mactalla had drawn 
from his bosom on approaching the bed, 
and accidentally held in his hand, while 
groping about it. 

On emerging from the building, Os- 
mond happening to cast his eyes on the 
opposite terrace, upon which the moon 
shone full at the moment, was not a little 
startled at beholding the wall of it com- 
pletely covered with armed men, whose 
Vv'eapons all appeared levelled against him- 
self and his party. 

*'^ Good Heavens!'* he involuntarily ex- 
claimed, '^ are we then betraved ? Yet if 
we are, what an extraordinary opinion 
must they have forn\ed of us, to think it 
requisite to send such a number after us I'' 

'' What do yoii mean, Signor?'* asked 
FelisGO, somewhat surprised. 

" Mean!'"^ 



THE DISCABDFD SON. 23^1 

*^ Mean '*' repeated Osinon:^ pointing 
across tlie court. 

''^ What! you are speaVino- of the gen- 
tlemen yonder ?" pursuing tae direction 
of his eye. '^ Ah, Signo*," with a ]oud 
laugh^ '' believe me vou never set eyes on 
a more harmless set. In a word, Signor_, 
they are made of what one has often rca~ 
son to believe the human heart made of â€” 
stone, as a clearer light would at once 
have permitted you to see.'' 

Osn.ond could not help joining for a 
moment in the laugh, which both Mactalla 
and his friend enjoyed at his expence. 
They then^ separated. 

Osmond, as soon as he was left to him- 
self, proceeded to take the range of the 
solitarv courts: but neither their stillness, 
nor yet the soft and shadowy light which 
prevailed throughout them, could impart 
a charm to soothe the anguish, to allay the 
agitation he experienced on account of 
the Raymonds. He continued wandering 
about like a troubled spirit^, literally taking

no rest or note of time, until the grey 
dawn of the eastern. cIcikIs gradually be- 
gan to redden : soon af^er which the 
tramplino: of horses announcing the ap- 
proach of the banditti, induced him to 
seek out a remote spot to secrete himself in 
from their observation. As soon as he was 
convinced they had entered the hall, and 
that of course he need fear no interruption 
from them, he ventured from his hiding- 
place, and as he did, was struck with min- 
gled astonishment and awe at the splendid 
scene, rendered still more so by the rising 
sun striking full upon it, which the great 
body of the inner castle, s-urrounded with 
fair semicircular towers, proudly swelling 
to the eye, and magnificently adorned with 
pinnacles, statues, and battlements, pre- 
sented to his view. 

But with the admiration it inspired was 
mingled that feeling of regret and sadness, 
which a mind of taste and sensibility invo- 
luntarily experiences at beholding any su- 
perb monument of art sinking into decay, 

such 



THE DISCARDED SON. 233 

such as it v/as evident this noble edifice 
was hastening to. The ravages of time 
were every where discernible on it â€” long 
grass overtopped its battlements, dusky- 
weeds crept round its arches, and heaps of 
rubbish strewed its courts. 

*' Yes/' said Osmond, under the influ- 
ence of the feeling just alluded to^ 

*' Tears to mortulityare not ccnfmcd, 
The fate of things affect the human mind." 

" But to this decay and desolation/' he 
continued, '' all the works of man, sooner 
or later, come; yet a little while, and the 
pile sinks into the dust, after the hand that 
raised it ; the monurnentj which pride hoped 
would perpetuate its name for ever, drops 
into oblivion, like the name it was intended 
to record.*' 

From the contemplation of i\^e build- 
ing he strolled away to the magnificent 
woods that rose above it. 

Fitter 



Â§34 THE DISCARDED SON, 

Fitter haunts for meditation than were 
these, he could not possibly conceive â€” 
so impervious were their shades, so pro- 
found their solitude ; a death-like stillness 
seemed to prevail throughout them ; nor 
stroke of sturdy axe^ nor woodman's cheer- 
ful carol, here met the listening ear ; nor 
bleat of 

â– ' â–  â–  â– 'â–  " Folded flocks penn'd in their wattled cot ^ 
Or sound of past'ral reed with oaten stops j 
Or whistle from the lodge j ox village cock." 

Here again the admiration of Osmond 
was excited, not only by the luxuriance of 
the trees, but the romantic bowers of fra- 
grant and beautiful shrubs, which he found 
scattered amongst them, and the fine views 
they, through partial openings, admitted 
of the castle, which, notwithstanding its 
crumbling turrets, still, in every direc- 
tion, '' wore a warlike mien,'' an air of sul- 
len grandeur, highly impressive. 

" As, 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2S5 

I 

" As, midst the snow of age, a boastful air 
.Still on the war-worn vet'ran's brow attends; 

Still his big bones his youthful prime declare. 
The' trembling o'er the feeble crutch he bends," 

Anxious to ascertain whether, if they 
failed effecting their escape one way,, there 
was any chance of accomplishing it ano- 
ther^ Osmond made his way, though not 
without the greatest difficulty^ to the sum- 
mit of one of these cliffs, whence a glance 
at the opposite side convinced him there 
"was not the smallest, by discovering to his 
view an extensive lake. 

At length he returned to the hall. The 
first object he beheld on entering it^ was 
Felisco, who, hastily approaching him, 
said aloud â€” '' You have had a long, and I 
hope pleasant, ramble. Signer;" then, in a 
lower tone, '' I have got the keys â€” follow* 
me.

CHAP. IX. 

*' He staled, and loU'd bis haggard eyes around/* 

'SMOND joyfully obeyed. On getting 
some distance from the hall, Felisco stopf, 
and having looked about to see there \s'as 
no one at hand to overhear them â€” '' I will 
myself attend you to the apartments/' cried 
he, 'â€¢' as I find I shall not be wanted for 
some time." 

Osmond thanked him for his complai- 
sance ; and Felisco leading the way, they 
proceeded through several intricate pas- 
sages to an immense folding-door, which 
throwing open, Osmond found himself in 
the rotunda they had previously visited: 

hence 



THE DISCARDED SOX. 23/ 

hence tliey ascended the fan staircase to 
another door, which Felisco unlocking, 
discovered to the view of Osmond a mag- 
nificent apartment:, which he styled the 
saloon, designed in the most elegant style 
of gothic architecture, and looking upon 
what had formerly been not only a spa- 
cious but delightful garden, and which still 
exhibited a beauty and richness highly at- 
tractive to the eye, and rendered still more 
so by the smiling contrast it formed to the 
dusky walls and battlements, begirt with 
ivy and long-streaming grass, which frown- 
ed above it. 

From this apartment they entered a spa- 
cious drawing-room, which Felisco also had 
to unlock, and which they hastily passed 
through to a dining-room, the door of 
which, like those of the other apartmeuts, 
w^as also secured. 

Here, however, Felisco paused, and with 
something of the air of a master of the 
ceremonies â€” '' Signor," said he, " if an ad- 
mirer of ancient grandeur, I advise you to 

look 



23S THE DISCARDED SON. 

look about youj as we proceed, since finer 
specimens of the kind than what this build- 
ing aflbrds can scarcely any vvhere^ I fancy, 
be met with/* 

'' True/' replied Osmond^ '' it is indeed 
altogether a noble pile. Pray can you in- 
form me to whom it belonged, or the cause 
of its abandonment to its present posses- 
sors?" 

" Not exactly. Signer; all I can inform 
you is, that it originally belonged to one 
of the first families in Italy â€” that its last 
legal possessors deserted it in consequence 
* of some dreadful catastrophe that took 
place in it â€” and that some years after, 
during which it remained without an inha- 
bitant, owing to the terror and disgust 
this catastrophe caused it to be regarded 
with, its then proprietor w?:s command- 
ed by government to destroy it, since 
he did not choose to make it his abode, 
lest otherwise its neighbourhood should 
be rendered dangerous, owing to the re- 
fuge it was calculated to afTord to ban- 
ditti^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 239 

ditti, from the loneliness and security of 
its situation. Instead^ however, of obey- 
ing this command, he thought proper to 
dispose of the place to a man of a suspi- 
cions character; and with the purchase- 
money quitted the kingdom, lest accident 
should discover what he had done. But 
please Heaven, if I make my escape from 
it, I shall soon make known its being still 
in existence.'' 

'' What a useful lesson,'* involuntarily 
thought Osmond, '' might this splendid 
ruin, and its approaching fate, afford to 
those who are too much attached to the 
parade of grandeur, and fix their principal 
happiness in the evanescent baubles of this 
life, since in it they would behold the 
inevitable end of all sublunary things, the 
vanity of ambition! Ah, little, in all pro- 
bability, did the founder of this still stately 
fabric imagine, that the period would ever 
arrive in which its only inhabitants would 
be the wailing birds of night, and the sa- 
vage destroyer of his own species." 

But 



540 TflE DISCARDED SON. 

But with the melancholy reflections it 
inspired, ^vould have been intermingled a 
high degree of pleasure, but for the anxiety 
with which Osmond was at present tor- 
mented, and which, but that he saw he 
should have disappointed his conductor by 
such conduct, would have caused him to 
hurry on without attending to any thing 
he saw. 

" This apartment," rejoined Felisco, " is 
large enough to contain a troop of horse. 
What a hospitable spirit do these great 
rooms prove the people of former times 
possessed !" 

Osmond could not avoid acknowledoins: 
it was one of the finest apartments he had 
ever seen^ of the purest gothic, with niches 
and other ornaments, which rendered it a 
noble model of a great baron's hall. Its 
present air of desolation, however, was 
chiilino' to the feelino'S. The furniture 
that still remained within it retained but 
faint vestiges of former splendor. The 
few pictures that yet hung upon its dusky 

walls^ 



THE DISCARDED SON. ^41 

walls, were, dropping from their massy 
frames, and so defaced by time and ne- 
glect, that the subjects they represented 
could hardly be guessed at; and of sha- 
dows, with truth it might be said, but sha- 
dows remained. 

To this succeeded several other apart- 
ments, equally worthy of observation, and 
ending in a spacious gallery, which they 
descended to a broad passage, lighted by a 
rovv of narrow pointed casements at each 
side, and terniinated by a flight of black 
marble steps leading to the chapel. 

This Felisco, from some pious scruples, 
declining to enter, he presented two keys 
to Osmond. â€” " The largest, Signor," said 
he, '' will give you adniission to the cha- 
pel ; the other belongs to a door you'll 
discover on your right hand, immediately 
behind a stately monument, surrounded by 
a brass ballustrading, and which opens to a 
flight of stairs, that lead directly to the 
apartment in which the private entrance 
is, which Heaven grant you may succeed

in finding. Should you be so fortunate 
as to do sOj desire your friends to hold 
themselves in readiness to join us at nine 
o'clock to-night; and take -care, to leave 
all the doors but the last adjoining the 
fan staircase, which secures the suit, un- 
locked." 

Osmond promised to observe his instruc- 
tions, and Felisco having premised that 
they might not meet again till the hour of 
escape, they parted. 

Osmond found some difficulty in gain- 
ing admission to the chapel. At length its 
massy doors yielded to his efforts, and 
swinging back on their rusty hinges, dis- 
closed to his view a scene of solemn gran- 
deur, well calculated to inspire a religious 
dread, still every warring passion into 
peace, and dissipate all the gay images of 
an alluring w^orld â€” thick trees encompassed 
it, thrusting their waving branches through 
its broken windows; moth-eaten banners 
hung suspended from many of its dusty 
pillars, proclaiming the tombs of w^arriors 

beneath. 



THE DISCARDED SON. S4S 

beneathj '' now dreaming of wars no 
more;'' and further on^, amidst its long 
drawn aisles, several rent up flags present- 
ed yawning chasms to the view â€” upon 
which Osmond scarcely cast his eyes^ ere 
he shrunk back in horror and disgust^ at 
the idea that flashed upon his mind of these 
being the places to which the robbers com- 
mitted the remains of their murdered vic- 
tims â€” of m.any an innocent^ here m.ingling 
its ashes with those of its fell destroyer. 

He readily found the door opening to 
the stairs, and unlocking it^ ascended to a 
large apartment, not less desolate in its 
appearance than the others he had passed 
through. Round this he now eagerly went^ 
in quest of the entrance he was so anxious 
to obtain ; but though nothing could ex- 
ceed the diligence of his search, nothing 
of the kind met his view. At length, after 
pausing a few minutes in absolute despair, 
he cast his eyes upon a large statue in a 
corner of it. It instantly occurred to him 
this might conceal the object of his search; 
M 2 he 



244 THE DISCARDED SON. 

he accordingly approached it, and, though 
not without some difficulty, pushing it 
aside, discovered, to his unutterable tran- 
sport, a large aperture, but, to his equal 
surprise, occupied at the moment by Mr. 
Raymond, muffled up exactly as he had 
seen him in the hall, and who instantly, as 
if struck by an invisible hand, fell pros- 
trate to the floor, with something like an 
exclamation of terror. 

" For Heaven's sake. Sir,'* cried Os- 
mond, shocked as well as alarmed, and 
stooping, as he spoke, to raise him, '' what 
is the matter ? are you ill ?" 

'' 111 V groaned the other, in a voice 
scarce articulate, and resisting the effort 
Osmond made to assist him : '' Oh that it 
was but illness I had to complain of! For 
what â€” what are the pangs of the body, 
coi"n pared to those of the mind ? Gracious 
Heaven!" he continued, with encreasing 
vehemence, '^ is then the dreaded hour of 
retribution arrived r and, to asrsravate, to 
render complete its horrors^ is he â€” he,

now beside me, the instriiinent thou hast 
fixed on to avenge thee ? Oh, is there no 
shelter for this head ? no hope to cling 
to?^' 

''â–  I entreat, I conjure you. Sir," said 
Osmond, cruelly alarmed at the idea of all 
his benevolent intentions respecting the 
unfortunate man and his familv beings de- 
feated bv the desertion of his reason, for 
\o this â€” to sudden madness, he imputed 
the speech he had just uttered â€” '^ to com- 
pose yourself" 

''What!" in a tone of the most malig- 
nant bitterness, but without raising his 
head from the ground, ''' to give you an 
opportunity of gratifying your revenge, 
by the renewal of my tortures?" 

" Revenge !" repeated Osmond. '' Pray 
try to recollect yourself, Sir. What re- 
venge, stranger as you are to me, can you 
possibly have given rise to in my bosom. ? 
But perhaps you mistake me for soine 
other â€” for one of the wretches into whose 
power you have so unfortunately fallen :

the honour of mentioning me to you ; for 
it was in their power to have informed you 
who I was/' 

" They did not omit doing so ; but ne- 
vertheless I cannot help having "' 

'^ Some doubts to my prejudice/' hastily 
and with involuntary haughtiness, inter- 
rupted Osmond. 

*' I believe so : but swear to me, on 
your W'Ord^ your honour, your immortal 
soub you do not belong to the banditti, 
^nd perhaps I may give credit to your 
assertions.*' 

'' In any other situation than the pre- 
sent, be assured. Sir, your doubting them 
would have prevented their being re- 
peated ; but nov/ pity and humanity pre- 
dominate over ofTended pride. I there- 
fore protest to you, by my hopes of hap- 
piness here and hereafter, I am in the samc- 
predicament here that you are yourself. 
But actions are the best proofs of a man's 
sincerity : know then, therefore. Sir, that 

I made 



THE DISCARDED SON. 247 

I made my way to this forlorn apartment 
solely for the purpose of endeavouring to 
gain access to yours, and thus rescue you 
from the dreadful fate impending over 
you/' 

'' What ! is your hand then not armed 
with a dagger to pierce my heart ? Are 
you reallv then not deputed to take ven- 
geance on me ? â€” on me, i\\Q -'* 

'*â–  You shock me beyond expression. 
Sir/' cried Osmond, '' by continuinor to 
speak in such a manner. Again I implore 
you (in the most energetic, the most vehe- 
ment manner, as if it was for his very life 
he was pleading, he proceeded) to try and 
compose yourself. If you have any re- 
gard for yourself, your family, endeavour 
to collect your thoughts. The present 
moments are infinitely too precious to be 
wasted in useless arguments or idle excla- 
mations, since they are the only ones that 
promise to afford an opportunity of im- 
parting circumstances to you absolutely 
essential to your safety to know." 

m4 ^^ Indeed'/' 



548 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'' Indeed !" exclaimed the other, in a 
somewhat more collected tone; and imme- 
dic:tely rising, but with his face covered 
with hit> handkerchief^ he turned towards 
the wainscot, and leaning against it, mo- 
tioned Osmond to proceed. 

Osmond obeyed â€” briefly acquainting 
him with the deception practised on him, 
and the method adopted for his deliver- 
ance. 

'' What a monster!'' cried Mr. Ray- 
mond, after listening to him with the most 
profound attention, but without once turn- 
ing his face tov^^ards him ; " but how ridi- 
culous to rail at a villain^ for proving him- 
self a villain !" Then, in a calmer tone^ 
"but still with his face averted â€” " And is 
it possible you can be anxious for my

"Good Heavens!" impatiently exclaim- 
ed Osmond ; " after what I have done^, 
what a question ! Excuse me. Sir, for tell- 
ing you^ you must instantly, if you wish

'' Pardon me/' said .Mr. Raymond, in an 
altered tone ; " the question was occa- 
sioned by astonishment at your being sa 
interested about me â€” me, of whom you 
have had so much reason to â€” to â€” of whom 
you have no knowledge^ I mean/' added" 
he, as if confused. 

'' True, Sir," replied Osmond, '' I have 
no knowledo'e of you, at least that I am 
conscious of; but he miUst have a narrow 
heart indeed, who can on'y feel interested 
for those he knows. God forbid the cha- 
rity of mine was so circumscribed ! You 
are a stranger to me, 'tis true ; but you are 
my fellow-being, and that is quite suffi- 
cient to give you a claim upon my best 
exertions." 

" Which I accept with gratitude. At 
nine o'clock, you say, I may expect a 
summons from you." 

'^ Exactly, if nothing unexpected oc- 
curs, which Heaven forbid. At all events^.

rely on it, no risque shall deter me from 
trying to serve you/' 

He then entreated him to gloss over, as 
much as possible, to the ladies, the un- 
pleasant circumstances he had unfolded to 
him, and to be cautious about speaking 
loud. 

" My dear young friend,'^ returned Mr. 
Kaymond, in quite a dilTerent voice to- 
what he had before spoken in, one which 
proved his being now quite collected, '' be 
assured there is but little occasion to give 
a man a caution when his own safety is 
concerned." 

He then acknowledged, but still without 
looking at Osmond, to the great surprise 
of the latter, that a suspicion of foul play 
had induced him to seek for a way of quit- 
ting his apartment, in hopes, if he disco- 
vered such, it would enable him to effect 
his deliverance. 

All matters being now arranged between 
him and Osmond, he retreated to his pri- 
son ; and Osmond, after he had, for fear of 

accidents. 



THE DISCAHDED SON. 25 1 

accidents^ replaced the statue^ retraced his 
way to the fan staii'case. As he slowly pur- 
sued this, his eyes involuntarily wandering 
about^ he accidentally espied a light closet 
off of one of the apartments. Curiosity 
induced him to enter it, and he found it 
strewed over with written papers : as he 
glanced over these, he discovered a small 
roll of manuscript : he took it up, and, 
unrolling a little of it, found it v/ritten in 
Italian. He ran over a few lines, and had 
his curiosity so strongly excited by these, 
as to be induced to deposit rt in his 
pocket. 

From the rotunda he iminediatcly re- 
paired to his chamber, there to remain till 
evening. The nearer it approached, spite 
of all his elTorts to the contrary, the more 
agitated he became. 

But not to fears for himself, but for the 
Raymonds, was owing the violent pertur- 
bation of his spirits. All his efforts to 
save them might be ineffectual, he re- 
M 6 fleeted; 



252 THE DISCARDED SON. 

fleeted ; and his soul sickened at the bare 
surmise. 

'' Gracious Heaven !'* he exclaimed, as 
he involiinrarily thought on the fair Cor- 
delia, " can human form enshrine a heart 
capable of nicditating her destruction ! 
But whatever be her fate in this mansion, 
I will share it/' 

To the impression she had made upon 
him^ may perhaps be imputed the deep 
interest he took in her fate, and that of 
her parents. But no â€” to ascribe it solely 
to such a cause, would be to do him injus- 
tice, since it diginated in the tenderness 
and compassion of his nature, and would 
have been the, same though he had not seen 
her, from the concern his disposition ever 
induced him to take in the troubles and 
disasters of his fellow- creatures, especially 
such as were really brought on by misfor- 
tune, to be charged upon no fault or in- 
discretion of the sufferer. In calamities of 
this description, there always appeared 

something 



THE DISCARDED SON. S^oS 

something so interesting to him, that at 
the first glance i^.e generally made them 
his own, and that not altogether from a 
reflection of their beino; such as he mio^ht 
have ex]}erienced, or still experience, but 
chiefiv iVom a certain generosity and sen- 
sibility of soul, which disposed him to 
compassion, abstracted from all considera- 
tions of self In a word, when any thing 
of the kind came within his knowledge, 
his mind became captive at once, and sur- 
rendered itself to all the tender emotions 
of pity and regret. 

Heavily wore away the hours he was 
destined to pass by himself. At length 
the sinking of the sun behind the tall trees 
of th^^ forest announced the one at hand 
in which he expected Felisco. Ke was 
punctual to his appointment, and came ac- 
companied by Mactalla. 

" Well, Signor," he softly exclaimed, as 
soon as the door was closed, '' the canp^ 
set off at the time I expected.'* 

^' And 



254 THE DISCARDED SON. 

**" And ever since/' cried Mactalla^ " vre 
have been busied in overcoming some of 
our difilcLilties^ by making the guards at 
the outer portal , drunk. Praise be to St. 
Benedict, we did not find it a very trouble- 
some undertaking; and now they lie, 
bound hand and foot, as cosy as possible^, 
in a dungeon of one of the towers, where 
they may roar long enough before any 
one in this part of the building can hear 
them : but lest the devil should drive some 
one towards them, we had better, as every 
thing is now ready for our escape, not 
defer it." 

'â€¢' Assuredly/' returned Osmond ; '' and 
now let me inform you that I was suc- 
cessful in discovering the private entrance 
I went in search of this morning, and that 
our fellow-prisoners are prepared to join 
us the moment we call upon them/' 

'' Signor," said Felisco, in a grave voice^ 
and with a clouded countenance, '' I am, I 
assure you^ extremely anxious for their 

deliverance ; 



THE DISCARDED SON. 255 

deliverance ; but notwithstanding, can- 
not help thinking, from certain reflections 
that have occurred since we parted this 
morning, that it is adviseable for us to 
leave them behind/' 

'' Leave them behind V repeated Os- 
mond, in an accent of horror. 

" Yes, Signor, owing to the danger that 
will attend their accompanying us in our 
flight/' 

'' Danger V said Osmond, again echoing 
his words^ and with a keenly-enquiring 
glance. 

'' Yes, Signor, danger. In a few mi- 
nutes a man will repair to their apartmerrf: 
with supper ; and should he find any diffi- 
culty in obtaining admission, or not per- 
ceive them in it at the first glance, mea- 
sures will immediately be taken, that in all 
probabiliiy will prevent our escape/' 

*^ Why are we not armed?" demanded 
Osmond. 

'^ Because^ Signor, *tis not in our power 
5 lo 



256 THE DISCARDED SON. 

to procure arms, the Captain having the 
key ofthearmorv in his own possession^. 
All things, therefore, taken into considera- 
tion, I really think, Signor, you had better 
leave those unhappy strangers to their fate." 
''â–  No, by Heaven !" exclaimed Osmond, 
in the most impassioned tone, and with 
uplifted hands and eyes, as if calling upon 
Heaven to attest his vow, '' No ! though I 
even was not as much interested about them 
as, from knowing them, I am, since to aban- 
don them, after the hopes I have inspired, 
the dangers I have unfolded, would make me 
look upon myself as a greater wretch than 
any one of the monsters who have impri- 
soned them. *But think not," he added, per- 
ceiving Felisco look alarmed, '' that it is my 
intention to involve you in any granger 
on their account. I will myself take their 
place in the tower; and by answering the 
centinel, in a feigned voice, trust I shall 
prevent any of the consecjuences you ap- 
prehend. For fear of the woi-st, however, 

delay 



THE DISCARDED SON. 257 

delay not a moment making your escape, 
after they have joined you ; and as soon 
as I think you are beyond these dangerous 
%valls, I will endeavour to accomplish mine: 
but remember, I positively interdict your 
waitins: longer for me than fifteen mi- 
nutes; if by the expiration of that time, 
I am not with you,, depend on it some- 
thing unforeseen has occurred^ and act 
accordinolv." 

'' Ohj my dear master!" cried Mactalla, 
sobbing, " I cannot think of leaving you 
â€” cannot think of your running the risk 
of your life, for people who are, as one 
may say, perfect strangers to you/' 

" I am determined," said Osmond ; '' and 
equally determined that, in the present in- 
stance, no one shall run any risk but my- 
self. Do not despond, however, my good 
fellow," added he, looking gratefully at 
Mactalla; '' I ever have, and ever shall, 
believe that an especial Providence watches 
over the safety of those who incur danger

through iTiOtives of benevolence: but 
come, these precious minutes are fleeting 
fast/' taking up the lamp, which Felisco 
had set on the table, as he spoke, and de- 
siring him to lead on to the fan staircase. 

" Here," cried he, as soon as the door 
opening into the suite of apartments this 
led to was unlocked, '' wait for me, my 
friends. I'll take care you shall not be 
detained long." 

He accordingly hurried forward, and 
was pleased to find Mr. Raymond and his 
family anxiously waiting his approach 
in the chamber communicating with the 
tower. He briefly explained the way they 
were to go, and bade them be as expedi- 
tious as possible. 

Mr. Raymond, on receiving his instruc- 
tions, kissed his hand to him, with an air 
of the greatest impatience ; and taking the 
lamp from him with one hand, and that o^ 
his daughter with the other, moved on â€” 



but Mrs. Raymond lingered.

THE DISCARDED SON. 259 

^' Are yoii not coming with us?" asked 
she, in an anxious tone^ and with a corre- 
sponding look. 

'*" I will follow yoUj Madam/^ replied 
Osmond, somewhat evasively. 

" Nay, I would much rather not pro- 
ceed without you. I " 

*^ Mrs. Raymond, I am astonished how 
you can be so ridiculous,'' in an angry 
voice, exclaimed Mr. Raymond, and paus- 
ing for an instant. 

" Go on, go on. Madam, 1 conjure you/* 
cried Osmond ; '' trust me, in a few mi- 
nutes I hope we shall be mutually con- 
gratulating one another on our fortunate 
escape from this den of thieves.'' 

Mrs. Raymond, but with evident reluc- 
tance, obeyed ; and the moment she w^as 
out of sight, Osmond, stepping through 
the aperture, took possession of the apart- 
ment she had vacated. ' 

Scarcely had he done so, when he heard 
several violent efforts made to open the 
door, which he hud bolted on the inside, 

and

and directly after a hoarse voice vociferat- 
ing â€” '' What ho ! Signor, ^vhat the devil 
have you done to the door^ that I can't 
open it ?'' 

" I have bolted it/* replied Osmond^ 
imitating, as nearly as he could recollect, 
the tones of Mr. Raymond, '' as the ladies, 
being fatigued, are undressing to lay 
down/' 

" Well, I shall wait quietly a few mi- 
nutes longer, and then I shall hope youil 
admit me, as I am in a d â€” mnd hurry to 
go to my supper." 

^' Oh, why/' involuntarily thought Os- 
mond, with a heart swelling with indigna- 
tion, '' why does the known justice of the 
Supreme Being permit him to \ti such 
wretches as these exist ? W^hy sleeps the 
thunder idle in His hand, when it could so 
easily blast them ?" â€” He started, he recol- 
lected himself- â€” '' forgive," he cried, " O 
forgive ! Thou, whose ways experience 
and observation never fail of justifying,

Hfilnd. This life would not be the state of 
discipline it is â€” such as^ for the improve- 
ment of our nature, 'tis requisite for us all 
to pass through â€” but for the mixture of 
bad men with good in society. The crimes 
of the former bring forward the virtues of 
the latter â€” all those suffering virtues^ which 
otherwise would have no field for action ; 
and bv the exercise of which the humau 
character is not only tried and purified,, 
but acquires some of its chief honours. 
Were there no bad men in the world to 
harass and distress the good, the good 
might appear in the light of harmless in- 
nocents, but could have no opportunity 
of displaying fidelity^ magnanimity, pa- 
tience, and fortitude; one half of virtue^ 
and that not the least important half^ 
would be lost to the world, since, in our 
present imperfect state, any virtue that is 
not exercised, is in danger jof becoming 
extinct. If goodness constantly proceed- 
ed in a smooth and flowery path â€” if, meet-

ing with no adversity to oppose it â€” if it 
was surrounded on every side with accla- 
mation and praiseâ€” would there be no 
ground to dread its being corrupted by 
vanity, or sinking into indolence?" 

Here his reflections were interrupted by 
the ruffian at the door exclaiming still more 
impatiently than before â€” '' Why, Signor, 
I say, an't the ladies undressed yet? If I 
am kept much longer here^ the capon I 
have brought for their supper will be quite 
cold, and, what is worse, the fellow of it^ 
which I have prepared for my own. Come, 
come, Signor (thundering at the door), 
admit me, I say/' 

'^ Have patience for a few minutes 
longer, I beg,'* said Osmond. Then, pur- 
suing the thread of his reflections â€” '' Yes,'* 
cried he, mentally, '' 'tis necessary this 
dangerous calm should be disturbed; the 
waters must be troubled, lest they should 
stagnate and putrify." 

*' Why, Signor, hollc I again, I say,'* 

cried 



THE DISCARDED SON. 265 

cried the ruffian^ " are the ladies ill, that 
they are so silent ? I have not heard them 
speak since I have been here/' 

" They are not always disposed for con- 
versation/'' returned Osmond. 

" For women, that's a wonder I am sure/* 
returned the other, with a loud laugh. 
Then, in a more brutal tone â€” '^ Let them 
be disposed for what they may, I shall wait 
here no longer: so, Signor, if you do not 
immediately unbolt the door, I shall make 
free to burst it open/' 

'' Patience another minute, I implore 
you," said Osmond. 

'^ Patience to the devil," returned he, 
and Osmond heard him apply his foot to 
the door. 

To defer, therefore, another minute 
making his escape, was not to be thought 
of; and besides, by this time, he flattered 
himself his friends had effected theirs. Ac- 
cordinglv, he hurried from the apartment, 
and hastily traversing the others he had to 

cross. 



^Qi THE DISCARDED SON. 

cross, carefully locked the door which en- 
closed the suite, and, passing the fan stair- 
case, descended by another to the hall. 

To his inexpressible joy he found it un- 
occupied. He darted forward, and gaining 
the door, made an eager effort to open it; 
but how impossible to paint his anguish^ 
his emotion, at finding it resist this effort 
â€” at finding it locked, and the key taken 
out. 

For an instant he was overpowered by 
the greatness of the shock this untoward 
circumstance gave him. Then recollecting 
himself â€” recollecting that fortitude and 
coolness might do something, despair and 
agitation nothing, he looked around him to 
try whether he could perceive any other 
outlet by which to escape, but without being 
able to discover any thing of the kind, the 
windows being all too high to admit a 
hope of effecting it that wa}-, and the 
doors leading into passages, of the intri- 
cacies of which he was too well apprized 

to 



THE DISCAHDED SOlf. 265 

to be able to suppose he could make his 
way through them. 

While considering what he should do, 
a small door, at no great distance from 
the principal one, and which he had not 
before noticed, owing to its being made 
to resemble a pannel^ flew open, and a man 
rushing in from the court, slapt it to, and 
set his back against it. 

Osmond involuntarily started, and was 
retreating towards the nearest passage, as 
the only means of avoiding^ he con- 
ceived, immediate destruction, when his 
steps were arrested by the ruffian exclaim- 
ing â€” " Ho, w^hat is that you, Ossuna ? 
Curse me if I can well see, I have got such 
a confounded giddiness in my head: would 
you believe it (hiccoughing violently), the 
hall seems dancing round me." 

The fainting spirits of Osmond revived ; 
he perceived the ruffian was in a state of 
complete intoxication^ and flattered him- 
self, from this circumstance, he should one

^66 THE DISCARDED SON. 

way or other be able to render him sub- 
servient to his escape. 

Accordingly, collecting himself, and 
retiring behind one of the pillars â€” " And 
prythee to what may that giddiness be 
owino;?'* asked he. imitating; the jrruff 
tone of Ossuna, which he perfectly recol- 
lected. 

'^ You comical dog/* cried the other, 
half laughing, half hiccoughing, '' to as 
natural a cause as any in the world â€” to 
that jolly rogue Felisco, and his friend 
Mactalla, our new com.rade, having pre- 
vailed on me to assist them in emptying 
too many flasks of Burgundy. I tell you 
what, Ossuna, I can see clearly we shall 
have rare doings here in future, from the 
companions we have lately got. By the 
Lord, if there be not a good vintage next 
year, we shall be in a bad way, for our cel- 
lars will soon be low, I'm certain; and no 
wonder â€” since such wine as they contain 
would make even a Mussulman drink â€” but

up against that dusty pillar ?'* 

'' I may as well ask what you are doing 
at that door ? Take my advice, and as your 
head is giddy, sit doAvn/' 

'^ Ah, you dog, ask me to leave my post ! 
But no, I shan't leave it." 

'' What ! not to assist in emptying ano- 
ther flask?'' 

*^^ Ah, you unconscionable dog!" hic- 
coughed the other. 

" No, I deny being unconscionable," 
returned Osmond ; '^ cc-nsider I w^as not of 
your party with Felisco." 

'' True, true, that's very true, comrade, 
and therefore I retract my words. Yes, 
yes, I see you are not unconscionable;

of the rascals from above to take my post 
here, I am your man."

" Ah, true, true ; but pray, comrade,

*' Yes, yes, I'll tell you all about that.

on the outside ; but how the devil it came 
there, is more than I can inform you, or 
puzzle my head to guess, but so it was. 
Ha, ha ! said I, as soon as I saw it, this does 
not look right ; so I whipt it out, and put

a tremendous key. 

'' YeSj so I perceive ; but had you not 
better return it to the door ? for it must 
be cumbersome^ and besides may other- 
wise be mislaid.'* 

'' No, comrade, no/' provokingly thrust- 
ing it again into his pocket, " I shall keep 
it till the Captain c6mes back, to convince 
him that though I Cio now and then do 
what he accuses me of â€” take a cheerful 
glass or so, I never inundate my brains suf- 
ficiently to prevent my knowing what I am 
about/' 

To the consternation of Osmond, the 
alarm-bell now rang out. 

'' Hey-day, why what the devil's the 
matter," exclaimed the other, after listen- 
ing a minute, with a vacant stare ; '' sure- 
ly the rascals in the north tower, and their 
prisoners, can't be scuffling; but if so, 
one should think they might do without 
ringing for assistance." 

'' But I suppose they can't," said Os-. 

mond ; 



THE DISCARDED SON. 271 

mond ; '' you had better^ therefore, hasten 
to them/' 

'' Hasten ! hasten ! to quit my post ! 
d â€” mn me, Ossuna^ if you desire me to 
do so again^ but 1 shall suspect you of 
some foul design/' 

Voices now sounded at no great dis- 
tance. 

'' Nay then/' said Osmond to himself, 
'' nothing but a desperate eflort remains 
for me/* 

He accordingly rushed upon the ruffian, 
and seizing him by the collar, dragged him 
from the door, but was prevented retreat- 
ing through it by his, in his turn, also 
seizing him. A violent struggle now took 
place betvveen them, the villain being 
uncommonly athletic, and besides not so 
stupidly drunk as not to guess the inten- 
tions of Osmond, on finding himself col- 
lared by him, and perceiving that he was 
not the person he supposed. 

Desperation, however, nerving the arm 

of Osmond, he at length succeeded in get- 

N 4 ting 



272 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ting him to the ground ; but at the same 
instant had the mortification of having one 
of his legs seized by him. The eyes of 
Osmond kindled^ his breathing became 
nearly suspended^ he stooped, and pulling 
from the girdle of the wretch one of the 
pistols with which it was stuck, held it in 
a threatening attitude to his head. 

This action had the desired effect â€” he 
was immediately released ; and hastenino- 
to the door, passed out, and turned the 
key. 

He speedily gained the vaulted passage 
in the outer court; but scarcely had he 
done so, ere he paused in consternation at 
perceiving two shadows at the entrance, 
which gradually retiring as he advanced, 
led him to imagine he was in danger of 
being waylaid within it. This horrible sur- 
mise made him stand for a minute in sus- 
pense before it. An exulting- shout, and the 
steps of pursuit behind him, then again 
urged him forward. As he proceeded, a 
heap of rubbish obstructed the path, and 

caused 



THE DISCARDED SON; 

caused him to stumble : 
himself, he distinguished the panting of 
his pursuers. Stilly however^ he pressed 
forward^ though now almost hopeless of 
reaching the wished-for goal. At length 
it appeared in sight; but at the same in- 
stant two men darted to it from a recess 
in the wall. He now gave himself up for 
lost, and, pausing, felt the skirt of his coat 
instantly seized behind. The effort, how- 
ever, that was made to drag him back was 
rendered abortive by the still more violent 
one that, at the same moment, was made 
by these two men to drag him forward. 
They succeeded in theirs; and, hastily 
clapping to the portal against the ruffians, 
who were rushing after them, locked it, 
and flung away the key. 

"â–  Now we are^afe, we are safe," shouted 
Mactalla, in a transport of jov, and who, 
together with his friend Felisco, had thus 
ventured to the assistance of Osmond, his 
delay in joining them having excited dread- 
V 5 ful 



274 THE DISCARDED SON. 

ful apprehensions for his safety ; '' blessed 
be St. Benedict for your deliverance \" 

" I trust I never shall forget the grati- 
tude I owe to Heaven for it/' said Osmond ; 
and hurrying over the drawbridge^ he founds, 
in a little sequestered glade among the 
treesj at the opposite side of the lawn, the 
Raymonds, together with the little French 
boy, whom Felisto had also contrived to 
get from the castle, and horses prepared 
for the whole party. 

'' Thank Heaven,'' in the most animated 
tone, exclaimed Mrs. Raymond, hastily 
advancing from beneath the deep shadow 
of the trees to meet ^smond the moment 
he appeared, " we see you again in safety: 
had you fallen a victim to your too great 
generosity (for the risk you ran on our 
account has been explained to us), never, 
never would the liberty purchased at so 
dear a rate have afforded me happiness." 

Osmond bowed â€” to speak at the mo- 
ment vv^as not in his power, so deeply was 

he 



THE DISCARDED SON. 975 

he affected by this grateful acknowledg- 
mentj the recollection of all he had lately 
gone through^ of all he had been instru- 
mental in preventing. 

'' Stuff! stuff!" exclaimed Mr. Ray- 
mond^ following her steps with his daugh- 
ter, and in a tone indicative of high displea- 
sure; ^' this is no time for compliments." 

'' We certainly should not linger here/' 
said Felisco ; " for there is no knowing 
the moment wiien some of the banditti 
may return/' 

'' And again I say/' cried Mr. Raymond^ 
thereby implying they had been arguing 
the point before, '' the direct road to Na- 
ples is the one we must take/" 

'' My God, Sir/' said Felisco, in the most 
impatient accent, '' have I not already ex- 
plained to you tae reasons w'hich should 
deter us from taking that â€” explained to 
you, that to a certainty that is the one in 
which we shall be pursued by the banditti,

that they'll never dream of our having 
chosen it ?'* 

'' And pray/' in the haughtiest voice 
imaginable, ^^ do you think I troubled my-

Again I say, the straight road to Maples is 
the only one I will take.'' 

" Then, by all the saints in the calendar, 
you must find your way to it yourself; for 
curse me," cried Felisco, not a little exas- 
perated by the supercilious manner in 
which he had been treated by him, "^ if I 
hazard my life, to gratify your whim in 
conducting you to it." 

" Pray, pray," supplicated his lady, ^' be 
persuaded to give up a determination so 
inimical to our safety. I shall die with 
terror if you persist in it, after the danger 
I have heard of its being likely to expose 
us to." 

'' Do, my dear father, do," entreated his 
lovely daughter, but in a trembling voice^ 
and attempting, as she spoke, to clasp his 

arm.

arm, which, however, she was prevented 
doing, by his rudely, or rather brutally, 
pushing her from him. 

Osmond, recovering from the emotion 
which had for an instant impeded his ut- 
terance, could no longer refrain from in- 
terfering. 

'' Pardon me. Sir/' said he, addressing 
himself to Mr. Raymond, but in a tone ex- 
pressive of the indignation his obstinacy, 
insolence, and inhumanity had excited^ 
*' for acknowledging myself amazed at 
your conductâ€” amazed that, at a moment 
like the present, you. can yield to any other 
feelings than those of benevolence." 

'' And pray. Sir,'' haughtily inquired (he 
other, " what is there in m.y conduct so 
amazing ? Is it my notattending to idle ar- 
guments on ene hand, and silly fears on the 
other, that occasions you such surprise ?" 

" It is your not regarding just arguments 
and natural fears. Sir," replied Osmond, in 
a tone not less haughty than his own^ 

'' which 



278 THE DISCARDED SON. 

'^ which so astonishes and disgusts me^ and 
now induces me to tell you, in a more pe- 
remptory manner than I could have w^ished 
to have done, that the road w^hich our de- 
liverer here (pointing to Felisco) wishes 
us to pursue, is the only one that shall be 
taken/' 

'' Shall \" repeated the other, drawing 
back, and evidently swelling with rage and 
resentment; ''permit me. Sir, to inform 
you, this is a kind of language I have not 
been accustomied to hear/* 

'' Nor I to use. Sir,'' cried OsmiOnd; 
'^ but never, when convinced, as in the 
present case, that I am right, shall my lan- 
guage be less decisive." 

'' Oh drop, for Heaven's sake, this alter- 
cation," said Airs. Raymond, drawing nearer 
to him ; '' while arguing in this manner, we 
may be surprised: and how, hov/ then would 
you have to reproach yourself," she added> 
looking earnestly at him, '' since to you 
alone v/ould our being so be owing?" 

'' Prepare 



THE DISCARDED SON. 279.^ 

" Prepare the horses^ Felisco/' said 0.s-. 
mond ; " another minute must not be 
wasted/' 

The horses were immedi-ately brought 
forward; and Miss. Raymond being nearer 
to him at the moment than her mother, he 
first offered her his hand to assist her ii^ 
mounting. Her accepting it, however, was 
prevented by her father rudely interposing 
between them. He seized her hand him- 
self â€” ^*' And we have ah'eady occasioned, 
you so much trouble. Sir/' cried he, Os- 
mond could not help thinking in a sneer- 
ing tone, '' that any services my daughr 
ter may require, I shall render her my- 
self." 

Osmond, with a slight inclination of his 
head, immediately drew back, so piqued^ 
so irritated, as to resolve from that mo- 
ment to hold no further converse with this 
ungrateful man and his family. 

" 'Tis by means of such characters as 
his,'* said he, m.entally, as w^ith a heart 
-welling with offended pride and just in- 
dignation 



280 THE DISCARDED SON. 

dignation he turned from him, '' that the 
mind by degrees is rendered callous to the 
pleadings of humanity, and men acquire a 
misanthropical turn. I will, therefore, 
shun, diligently shun, such,- whenever they 
come across my path, in order to avoid 
the perversion of my feelings, the destruc- 
tion of all the social charities of my na- 
tiire, from the exercise of which man de- 
rives his highest enjoyment." 

As he stood adjusting the bridle of his- 
horse, he felt his arm gently pressed be- 
hind ; and turning round, beheld Mrs. Ray- 
mond at his elbow, 

" You are offended," said she, ^^ I see 
you are offended ; if you continue so, I 
shall be quite unhappy. Oh, if you could 
look into my heart, you w^ould there (she 
added, in the most energetic tone) dis- 
cover sentiments w^hich would, I make no 
doubt, appease your, I acknowledge, just 
resentmentâ€” you v/ouid then find, that 
ingratitude is not the vice of all. Yet let 
me not say ingratitude â€” no, no, 'tis from 

pettishness 



THE DISCARDED SON. 281 

pcttishness the expressions dropt which 
offended you." 

Osmond, who knew not what it was in 
his own bosom to involve the innocent 
with the guilty^ perpetuate the memory 
of injuries, or keep alive the fiame of 
resentment, warmly, though respectfully^ 
pressed her hand between his, and con- 
jured her (the cloud of passion vanisliing 
from his brow, and his fine countenance 
regaining all its wonted openness) to think 
no more of what had passed, assuring her 
he should give it no place in his remem- 
brance. 

*' A thousand, thousand thanks," cried 
she, in the most grateful accent, '' for this 
assurance." 

Then permitting him to lead her to her 
horse, he assisted her on it ; and the party 
set off, Felisco leading the way, and Os- 
mond and Mactalla bringing up the rear. 

The intricacies and difliculties of the 
way they deemed it expedient to pursue, 
the expedition they were anxious to make, 

and 



''^S^ THE DISCARDi-D SON. 

and the agitation they were naturally in, 
precluded all further conversation for some 
tinie. At length, after a long silence^ 
Mactalla motioned to his master to slacken 
his speed a little, and upon his obeying â€” 
'' By vSt. Benedict/' cried he, in a low 
voice, '^ but you risked your life, Signor, 
for a bad man," pointing, as he spoke, to 
Mr. I^.aymond, who rode close to his 
daughter, and apparently regardless of all 
but her and himself. '' Would you believe 
it? â€” that ungrateful villain (for he de- 
serves no other appellation) wanted Fe- 
lisco and me not to wait for you, saying 
he was certain you could not escape, and 
at all events, whether you did or not, it 
was not fair that so many persons should 
endanger their lives for the sake of one.'* 

'' Gracious Heaven !" exclaimed Os- 
mond, in a tone of horror, '' is it pos- 
sible?" 

" Why, Signer, I wouldn't try to make 
the devil himself appear blacker than he 
really is; but 1 don't wonder at your al- 
most 



THE DISCARDED SON. 283 

most doubting what I have told you^ since 
to be sure it seems almost incredible that 
any man should be vile enough to disre- 
gard the safety of the person who was risk- 
ing it on their account ; and by the Powers 
I made no bones of telling him so : if ever 
he got a good dressing, he got it from Fe- 
lisco and me/' 

'' And the ladies/' anxiously demanded 
Osmond, " were they equally uninterested 
about me ?" 

'' They ! Oh, blessings on them, not at 
all. If you had been the nearest and 
dearest friend they had in the v^orld, they 
couldn't have felt more for you than they 
seemed to do. Ilis lady, though I am sure 
she is afraid of him, and no wonder^ for I 
am certain he is a tyrant in liis heart, made 
no scruple of reproaching him for his cru- 
elty and ingratitude, in thinking of serving 
you in such a manner ; and as to his daugh- 
ter, her pretty eyes never shed so many 
tears before, I dare say ; for at first, both- 



284 THE DrSCARDED SON. 

she and her mother appeared apprehen- 
sive of our acting as he wished/' 

" Well^ for the honour of human na- 
ture^ I am glad to hear they do not re- 
semble him/' said Osmond ; '' I will hope 
and believe, in order to prevent my being 
disgusted with it^ that but few could be 
found who do." 

â€¢^ And moreover, Signer/' rejoined Mac- 
talla, '' it was he to a certainty that turned 
the key in the hall door; but whether 
owing to accident or design, I cannot pre- 
tend to say." 

" Oh, most assuredly to accident/' re- 
turned Osmond, with quickness; '' for what 
motive could he possibly have for wishing 
my destruction ?" 

'' Why, that's true. Signer; that's a 
question I have asked myself; and as I 
cannot answer it in a satisfactory manner, 
I am inclined to think as you do in this 
instance. Heaven knows it was bad enough 
his thinking so little of you, without 

doin2[ 



THE DISCARDED SON. 2S5 

doing any thing he thought could injure 
you/* 

To this observation Osmond only re- 
plied by shaking his head ; and again they 
rode on in silence. 

Previous to this information^ Osmond 
iiad been endeavouring to reason himself 
out of the prejudice he had conceived 
against Mr. Raymond^ in consequence of 
his haughty and obstinate deportment, by 
reflecting, that the best of men had fre- 
quently contradictory qualities in their dis- 
positions, and at times acted in so strange 
and unaccountable a manner, as complete- 
ly to shadow all their virtues ; and besides 
that, great allowances should be made for 
a person situated as he understood him to 
be â€” not only compelled to quit his native 
country, but in all probability tortured by 
remorse for the act which had obliged him 
to do so. But now any longer to combat 
against this, he found to be impossible; 
and so strong, so decided did it become, 

that. 



286 THE DISCARDED SON. 

that, but for the consideration of his ami- 
able companions, he would have had no 
hesitation in resolving from this moment 
to keep entirely apart from him. 

From any ostentatious display of grati- 
tude for the service he had rendered him^ 
the risk he had run on his account, he 
would have shrunk embarrassed and dis- 
tressed ; but some faint appearance of it 
would have been gratifying to his feelings, 
from the proof it would have afforded of 
his generosity not having been exercised 
for an unworthy characfer. 

Though his resentment against Mr. Ray- 
mond could not be subdued, it was much 
allayed when he reflected on the pain his 
conduct towards him evidently gave his 
wife and daughter; and on their account, 
as much as possible, he resolved on con- 
cealing his feelings: on the latter by de- 
grees his thoughts solely turned; and with 
a transport impossible to be described, he 
dwelt on the idea of the deliverance he 

had 



THE DISCARDED SON. 287 

had aiTordecl her^ or rather on the idea of 
tlie sentiiivents it had perhaps excited in 
her bosom for him. 

Quick! \% however^ did the delicious sen- 
sations inspired by the idea of these yield 
to the recollection of the obstacles which 
want of fortune threw in the way of a 
union with her ; and again he accused him- 
self of selfishness^ for wishing to inspire 
her^ or deriving pleasure from the thoughts 
of having done so^ v>'ith sentiments of a 
tender nature for him â€” again resolved to 
punish himself for so doing, by having no 
further communication with her than was 
absolutely necessary.

UST as day began to dawn, the party 
emerged from the confines of the forest, 
and crossing a plain, thinly dotted with 
trees, entered upon a valley of consider- 
able extent, bounded by and winding away 
something like a meandering river, amongst 
mountains of various size and form ; some, 
from their frightful chasms and gloomy ca- 
verns, shagged with thorn, and shaded with 
the darkest foliage, appeared only fit haunts 

for 



THE DISCARDED SON. 289 

for the prowling wolf^ or midnight sons of 
plunder â€” others^ with gentler aspect^ rose 
from the vale; here^ clad with stately- 
forests^ there^ sw^elling into grassy hil- 
locks, or sinking into dells, o'ertopt by 
towering and projecting rocks, the grey 
tints of which were beautifully contrasted 
by the bright verdure of the pines that 
waved over them, and the silvery rills that 
trickled down their sides, as if to nourish 
the moss and wild plants with which they 
were tufted. Here mountain torrents were 
seen rushing down stupendous precipices, 
now disappearing amidst tangled thickets, 
then again bursting on the view, in a sheet 
of foam, as if eager to gain the tranquil 
mazes of the vale beneath, where aromatic 
shrubs and flowers intermingled their beau- 
ties, and gave new sweetness to the breath 
of morning. 

As the rising sun gradually unfolded this 
scenery to the view of the travellers, the 
heart of Osmond swelled with gratitude to 
Him who had given him again to hail the 

VOL. iH. o glories 



290 THE DISCARDED SON. 

glories of the opening day in safety, and 
gaze again, without fear or molestation, on 
the extensive landscape. 

Revived by the balmy freshness of the 
air, cheered by the matin hymns of un- 
numbered birds, and at every step con- 
trasting his present with his recent situa- 
tion, Osmond felt as if he had recovered 
all his wonted cheerfulness; till a glance 
at the fair Cordelia dissolved the enchant- 
ment which had soothed him into tran- 
quillity, by reviving reflections of a pain- 
ful and agitating nature. 

They travelled without pausing till the 
morning was far advanced. Rest being 
then absolutely necessary for themselves 
and horses^ and a convenient spot for the 
enjoyment of this presenting itself to the 
view, they alighted^, and sought refuge in 
a luxuriant wood, on the brow of a hill, 
from the sultry heat of noon. It rose 
near the entrance of a far-extended plain, 
dotted with delicious groves of poplars, 
plants, and mulberries, and commanding 

a prospect 



THE DISCARDED SON, 291 

a prosj^ect boundless as human wishes. To 
the right a distant river rolled its navi- 
gable waters, enlivened by the fluttering 
sails of small vessels^ and surmounted by- 
successive ridges of intertwisted moun- 
tains, gradually fading into the clouds they 
seemed emulous to reach : to the left ex- 
tended a vast tract of country, diversified 
in the most romantic manner, with hill and 
dale, fountain and fresh shade; and in front 
were detached woods, gradually sloping 
out of sight, and opening in various di- 
rections to richly-glowing landscapes. 

Felisco, preceding the party, soon dis- 
covered an embowered retreat for the 
ladies, â€” 

- â–  - " That, like Pomona's arbour, smll'd. 
With flow'rets deck'd, and fragrant smells. The roof 
Of thickest covert, was in woven shade. 
Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew, 
Of firm and fragrant leaf. On either srde 
Acanthus, and each od'rous bushy shrub, 
Fenc'd up the verdant wail : each beauteous flow'r, 
Iris, all hues, roses, and jessamin, 

o 2 Rear'd 



292 TffE DISCARDED so^^ 

Rear'd high their flourished heads between, and wrought 

Mosaic ; under foot the violet, 

Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay, 

Broider'd the ground ; more colour'd than with store 

Of costHest emblem. In shady bower. 

More sacred or sequester'd, though but feign'd, 

Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor nymph 

Nor Faunus haunted." 

A murmuring brook ran near it, diffus- 
ing all around a grateful freshness; and the 
deep dark verdure of the trees was en- 
livened by the glowing beauties of the 
orange and the lemon, and the white blos- 
soms of the almond and the myrtle. 

On stopping, Osmond happening to be 
nearer to Miss Raymond than to any other 
of the party, he approached for the pur- 
pose of helping her to alight, but was again 
prevented rendering her any assistance, by 
her father, as he had before done, rushing 
between them. 

All his angry feelings revived by this 
conduct. The moment he had handed 
Mrs. Raymond into this delightful retreat, 

he 



THE DISCARDED SON. 293 

he was retiring, "when she prevented him, 
by catching his arm, and inviting him to 
take a seat beside her on a bank of ver- 
dant turf thev found within it. 

Numerous flocks, with their attendant 
shepherds, were scattered over the plain ; 
and to these Mactalla and the French boy 
now repaired, to procure milk and fruit, 
while Felisco was employed in unpack- 
ing a basket of provisions he had taken care 
to bring with him from the castle. 

Whilst thus busied, Mr. Raymond en- 
quired, with an appearance of great anx- 
iety, whether there was no village or ha- 
bitation near, at which they could procure 
a carnage for the remainder of the jour- 
ney, or at least a few additional attend- 
ants } 

'' No,** Felisco replied ; '^ Venosa was 
the nearest place at which they could pro- 
cure either, the present tract being solely 
inhabited by shepherds, too much occu- 
pied by their flocks to be prevailed on to 
o 3 quit 



294 THE DISCARDED SON. 

quit them:, though sufficiently generous, 
he knew from experience, to lend their 
assistance to any one immediately at hand/' 

Mr. Raymond then asked, how soon he 
thought they might reach Venosa ? To 
which he answered, by night-fall, provided 
the horses were sufficiently refreshed to 
permit of their renewing their journey at 
sunset. 

Mactalla and his companion presently 
returned with the refreshments tljey had 
gone for, which laying by the viands Fe- 
iisco had already produced, they retired 
with him to a little distance from the arbour. 

Mrs. Raymond now repeated her ac- 
knowledgments to Osmond for the gene- 
rosity of his recent conduct; and by the 
obliging attentions she paid him, seemed 
anxious to manifest her gratitude. 

Osmond, now at leisure to view her at- 
tentively, beheld in her countenance traces 
of the most perfect beauty ; but, like the 
Marchesa Morati, though unpossessed of 

these. 



THE DISCARDED SON. S95 

these, she would still have been attractive, 
so prepossessing were her manners^ so dig- 
nified her air and deportment. 

Convinced, from the assurances of Fe- 
lisco, that they were in perfect safety in 
their present situation, she entered into a 
cheerful conversation with Osmond, indica- 
tive at once of a liberal and accomplished 
mind, but in which neither her husband 
nor daughter participated; both sat be- 
hind her, and at some distance ; and to the 
astonishment of Osmond, as he could not 
suppose he was under any apprehension 
of unpleasant consequences ensuing from 
his now being seen, the former still con- 
tinued muffled up in such a manner^ that 
not a feature was visible. 

That his silence was premeditated, he 
made no doubt ; but that the fair Corde- 
lia's proceeded from aught but her dread 
of him, he could not imagine, owing to 
a glance or two, which, spite of the inter- 
position of her father, he caught. 

At the request of Mrs. Raymond, he 
o 4 gave 



S96 THE DISCARDED SON. 

gave not only a succinct account of the 
manner in which he had fallen into the 
hands of the banditti^, but of the circum- 
stances to which his visiting Naples were 
owing. On his concluding â€” *' Your nar- 
rative may with truth/' said she^ '' be styled 
one of most disastrous chances â€” one too 
which has the singular effect of at once soft- 
ening and strengthening the mind^ since, 
while it affects the feelings, it inspires for- 
titude, by proving that there is no danger, 
no difficulty almost, which resolution and 
patience may not overcome/' 

She then, in her turn, informed him, that 
at the skirts of the wood in which he and 
his attendants had taken refuge from the 
storm, they had been surprised by the ban- 
ditti, she could not help thinking owing 
to the treachery of their servants, as, 
though armed and numerous^ they made 
not an effort to defend them, nor had one 
of them been seized by the troop. 

At length Osmond arose and withdrew, 
in order to afford Mrs. Raymond and her 

fair 



^ THE DISCARDED SON. 297 

fair daughter an opportunity of enjoying 
a little repose. 

Lost in thought, he strolled further into 
the wood, without reflecting on the ne- 
cessity there was for his endeavouring to 
obtain some himself His dislike to Mr. 
Raymond strengthened, he almost believed, 
beyond the possibility of being subdued, 
owing to the unaltered coldness, or rather 
fastidiousness of his manner, and which he 
was again tempted to ascribe solely to an 
ungracious temper, too callous to feel gra- 
titude, and too proud to acknowledge an 
obligation. But with the indignation and 
resentment he felt against him for his con- 
duct was mingled something like pity ; for 
of how many exquisite enjoyments must 
his yielding to such" a temper debar him, 
he thoughtâ€” domestic pleasure, the conso- 
lations of friendship, the silent satisfaction 
resulting from the consciousness of being- 
esteemed â€” yes, the man w^ho harboured 
such a one could not fail (he inwardly ex- 
claimed) of being an enemy to his own. 
happiness. 

o5 At 



298 THE DISCARDED SON. 

At last, completely overpowered by fa- 
tigue^ he threw himself at the root of an 
old tree, which dipt its trembling and far- 
extended boughs into a brook that bab- 
bled by, and gradually sunk into a tran- 
sient slumber, lulled by the soft rustling 
of the foliage, and the ceaseless hum of 
swarming insects, not undelightful 

** To him who muses through the wfcods at noon j 
Or drowsy shepherd, as he lies reclin'd. 
With half-shut eyes, beneath the floating shade 
Of willows grey, close crowding o'er the brook." 

From this he awoke refreshed, and re- 
tracing his way to the bower, stopt within 
some yards of it, in consequence of seeing 
Miss Raymond seated near the brow of the 
hill, beneath the shade of some tall and 
clustering trees : her back was towards him, 
and she appeared buried in thought. 

What would he not have given at the 
moment to have been able to have looked 
into her heart, as Ariel was into that of 
Belinda's ? 

A fear 



THE DISCARDED SON. 299 

A fear of appearing intrusiveâ€” that mo- 
desty which is generally reckoned the com- 
panion of genuine love, and certainly al- 
ways of sensibility â€” withheld him from 
approaching her : but though he was able 
to resist the impulse which would have led 
him to her side, he was not able to prevail 
on himself to quit a spot where, without 
incurring the imputation of impertinence^ 
he could indulge himself in gazing on her 
â€” but the pleasure he derived from this 
was not unalloyed, as he silently observed 
her, and involuntarily reflected on the hap- 
piness the man must enjoy, who should 
call such a treasure his. He also reflected^, 
his thoughts recurring to the apparent 
sternness of her father, on the probability 
there was of her not experiencing herself 
the felicity she was so capable of bestow- 
ing, and deserving of possessing^ â€” he sighed 
at the idea â€” sighed to think she might be' 
forced into the arms of a^e and uHiness 
â€” doomed to become the partner of some 
sordid wretch, intent only on his own gra- 
tification, 

^ ^ Ah,: 



SOO THE DISCARDED SOK. 

An accidental movement of her head dis- 
covering him to her, interrupted his reflec- 
tions; he directly approached her, and, with 
a glow upon his cheek, not less bright at 
the moment than that which suffused hers, 
expressed his apprehension of having star- 
tled her, as, upon seeing him, she had 
hastily risen. 

^' No,*' she replied, only surprised her, 
as she did not expect to see him at the 
moment. Then added, that unable to rest, 
owing to the impression recent incidents 
had made upon her mind, she had quitted 
the shady covert in which he had left her, 
in order to indulge herself with the con- 
templation of the surrounding scenery â€” 
'' In which, I fancy," continued she, "" you 
were quite absorbed at the moment I dis- 
covered you/' 

*' I was indeed,'* said Osmond, raising 
involuntarily his eyes to hers, '' absorbed 
at that moment in the contemplation of 
one of the loveliest objects in creation/* 

^'Indeed'/* she replied, with a deeper 

blush, and a lurking smile, which implied

her better understanding the import of his 
words than she appeared willing to let him 
imagine; *^^ where there are so many^ as in 
the present instance^ I should think it ra- 
ther a difficult matter to select a particular 
one.'* 

^' By no means/' said Osmond ; '^ the 
one I allude to is so superlatively lovely^, 
that I think it next to impossible any one 
could hesitate in giving it a decided pre- 
ference.*' 

*' Well^ perhaps so/' she returned, with 
carelessness, but a carelessness which Os- 
mond could not help thinking more feign- 
ed than felt. 

The conversation now turned upon the 
enchanting prospects stretched around 
them, which brought to his mind, Osmond 
said, the delightful shades of Acerenza. 

" Ah ! delightful shades indeed," echoed 
Miss Raymond, with a sigh. 

" Yes, by me they will ever be regarded 
as such," said Osmond ; ^' since it was 



amongst them I first beheld â€” 



He

He paused^ suddenly recollected himself, 
and looked confused. 

Miss Raymond appeared not less so; and 
from this circumstance Osmond was con-^ 
vinced she perfectly comprehended what 
he had been on the point of saying. 

After a moment of evidently painful em- 
barrassment on both sidc-s, she mationed* 
to return to the recess^ but was prevented' 
by the unexpected approach of her mo- 
ther. 

'' My dear girl/' she exclaimed, in hur- 
ried accents, '^ you have caused me inex- 
pressible terror, by quitting my side." 

Miss Raymond expressed the greatest 
regret for having done so, since the occa- 
sion of alarm to her; accounting to her, 
as she had previously done to Osmond, for 
havings quitted their shady covert. 

"I cannot wonder indeed," replied Mi*s. 
Raymond, '* at the impression made upon- 
your imagination by recent scenes. I trust 
now,'' smiling a little archly, '' you have 
had quite enough of the terrific. â€” Yoit

must know, Mr. Munro/* turning and ad- 
dressing herself to him^ '' this young lady 
took it into her head, owing to the perusal 
of romances, to wish to find herself the 
inhabitant of some dilapidated mansion, 
where she would be likely to lose herself 
in old corridors, marble halls, and subter^ 
raneous passages â€” in short, have the su- 
blime sensation- of terror every instant 
awakened in her mind ; and no one will 
deny, I believe, that this wish has. been ac- 
complished." 

" Yes, but my dear mother,'' returned 
Miss Raymond, blushing and half-smiling, 
^^ to have rendered our adventures truly; 
horrific and romantic, we should have seen 
a spectre, and met with a mutilated manu- 
script." 

'' Well, Madam," said Osmond, '' though 
I cannot complete them in one WÂ£\y, by 
raising a spectre, I can in another, by pro-

'^ Really?'* said Miss Raymond, with 
quickness; '' and pray what are its con-

'' That, Madam, I cannot say, as I have 
not yet had time to look over it.'* 

Mrs. Raymond enquired how he had 
met with it, and on being informed â€” 
" Well/' said she, " I acknowledge my cu- 
riosity is so awakened, that, as we are 
here in perfect safety, and will not, you 
knoWj recommence our journey for some 
hours, I should like, if not disagreeable to 
you, to hear it." 

Osmond, bowing, assured her he was 
happy beyond expression at having an op- 
portunity of obliging her. 

They seated themselves or the spot Miss 
Raymond had just before occupied, and 
which was exactly such a one as the poet 
has described, â€¢

nothing in it improper for their ear, and 
having satisfied himself there was not, and 
prepared them for numerous breaks in the 
narrative, occasioned by that cormorant

TO LAURA MARTINELLJ, 

-tIT the moment in which we were bid- 
ding each other adieu, you "charged me, 
my dear Laura^ to write to you^ and give 
you an account of the stately, though so- 
litary, edifice, in which my ruined for- 
tunes have occasioned me to take refuge, 
in order to avoid the manifold injuries 
and indignities which persons of low pride 
and illiberal minds are but too apt to heap 
upon those who have unexpectedly fallen 
from a height that once provoked their 
envy â€” above all, you charged me to give 
you the particulars of the event of which 

you 



THE DISCARDED SON. 307 

you say you have hitherto only been able 
to glean imperfect information^ to which 
its desertion to a few domestics is owing; 
not doubting my being able to collect 
these for you, in consequence of being on 
the spot where that event happened. 

" Your commands must ever meet wfth 
obedience from me ; and in conformity to 
them I now take up my pen. 

'' The castle of Clarizio^ whose solemn 
echoes^ after long slumbering, the sighs 
of my grief have again awakened, is at 
this period just such a retreat as despair 
would wish to make choice of â€” a proud 
record of the taste of former times, a me- 
lancholy monument of the antiquity and 
greatness of the family to which it be- 
longs. 

It stands upon the banks of a rapid 
river, which produces a melancholy noise, 
owing to rocks that in many places cause 
it to fret and murmu'i* in its course. On 
every side aspiring shades surround it,

amidst whose deep recesses, ravens, and 
other ill-omened birds, lodo^e securelv. 
Kuin and desolation every where encom- 
pass it: its stately tov/ers are decayed, its 
battlements are broken ; ivy enwreaths its 
windows, and the long grass waves where 
once the conquering banner hung: in the 
furniture, or once gorgeous ornaments, 
scarce a vestige of former magnificence 
remains; and the few aged domestics who 
inhabit it, seem, like the building itself, 
bending beneath the influence of that de- 
stroying power which conquers all. From 
them I have gathered the particulars yo^ 
desire to be acquainted with. 

'' The Marchese Montana was an only 
child. He was naturally of a haughty and 
vindictive spirit ; and the evil propensities 
which, by proper attention, might have 
been subdued, were encreased and finally 
confirmed by false indulgence and perni- 
cious flattery. 

He was just emerging into manhood, 

when 



THE DISCATIDSD SON. S09 

\vhen a contagious disorder carried off both 
his parents^ and thus left him uncontrolled 
master of his own actions. Ardent in his 
passions, he hesitated not to avail himself, 
to its fullest extent^ of the liberty he had 
thus prematurely acquiredâ€” immediately 
entering upon a course of dissipation, which 
he persevered in for years, to the great de- 
triment of his morals, health, and charac- 
ter. At length satiety began to prevail: 
he grew disgusted with all that had for- 
merly delighted him, and in consequence 
resolved on marrying, and withdrawing 
from the scenes that had so long v/itnessed 
his excesses. 

About the period he formed this reso- 
lution, fame began to blazon forth the 
charms and accomplishments of the Count 
Clarizio's heiress, the young and lovely 
Isabella ; but at the court of Naples, 
where they were thus extolled, she had 
never yet made her appearance: to a few 
accidental visitors at the remote castle of 
her father^ she was indebted." 



310 TilE DISCARDED SON. 

'' One of the breaks/' said Osmond, 
'' which I prepared you for/* 

'' The description given by these acci- 
dental visitors of her charms, so impressed 
itself upon the imagination of Montana, 
that he would immediately have made over- 
tures for her hand, but for an apprehen- 
sion of their being exaggerated. The idea, 
however, of losing so lovely a creature, 
as he was sensible Isabella must be, if at 
all according with the portrait drawn of 
her, rendered him miserable, and at length 
induced him to determine on sending some 
one in whom he could confide to the 
castle of Clarizio, for the purpose of as- 
certaining exactly w^hat she was, and thus 
having his suspense and indecision respect- 
ing her terminated. 

The person whom, after some delibera- 
tion, he thought proper to employ, was a 
youth of the name of Carlo Baronimi, the 
descendant of a noble but unfortunate 
house, in the fate of which some particular 

circum- 



THE DISCARDED SON. 31.1 

iclrcumstanceSj not necessary to narrate, 
h^id so strongly interested Montana, who 
was not altogether destitute of those qua- 
lities which constitute the nobility of the 
heart, that, on its final downfal, he took 
this its sole surviving branch under his 
protection, and educated him with a care 
and tenderness that caused it to be report- 
ed, and generally believed, that he meant 
to make him his heir. 

The heart of the youthful Carlo di- 
lated with transport at the confidence re- 
posed in him by his benefactor. He ex- 
ulted to think he had an opportunity of 
obliging him, feeling, whenever such a one 
occurred, the debt of gratitude he owed 
him less oppressive. 

Attended by one chosen domestic, he 
set out for the castle of Clarizio, where 
he purposed introducing himself, under 
the pretext of haviftg lost his way. 

He travelled with such expedition, 
that towards the close of day, just as the 
yellow radiance that had long trembled

over it was fading away^ he entered the 
forest of Clarizio, The tale he had fabri- 
cated for the purpose of gaining admission 
to the stately mansion it embowered^ suc- 
ceeded as he wished. On giving in his 
name at the portal^ he was invited to enter^ 
and conducted through a numerous train 
of domestics to the banquetting-room, 
where the Count and Countess sat at sup- 
per. Nothing could be more gracious 
than their reception of him. As soon as 
the ceremonies of introduction were over, 
and he had taken a seat beside his noble 
hostess, he looked for Isabella. Three 
young ladies occupied places at the table, 
but idl so equally and so exquisitely lovely, 
that, struck with surprise and admiration, 
he could scarce forbear exclaiming â€” '' Are 
there then three Isabellas ?'* 

He soon found, however, that not one 
of these answered to that name, that they 
were merely visitors at the castle, and that 
Isabella herself was then confined by a 
slight indisposition to her apartment. Im- 
patience 



THE DISCARDED SON. 3l3 

patience to behold her made him forsake 
his conch at an early hour the ensuing 
morning : he found the Count and Coun- 
tess in a magnificent saloon, opening to a 
garden, yet glittering with the dews of 
early day, and exhibiting at once all the 
verdure of spring and luxuriance of sum- 
mer. 

But from inanimate objects his atten-^ 
tion was speedily diverted by a young fe- 
male advancing down a vista towards the 
saloon : on her his eyes instantly became 
rivetted â€” for never had so lovely an object 
before met their gaze. 

''Oh! if this be Isabella (he inwardly 
exclaimed), blest indeed will Montana be, 
should he gain her hand. Oh ! if this be 
her, I must hence without delay, or en- 
danger my fidelity to him/* 

vShe entered, and was presented to him 
as the daughter of his host. He perceived 
the danger of tarrying anothd' hour at 
Clarizio ; yet still he lingered ; and by 
consciously exposing himself to tcmpta-

tion, became overpowered by it : the se- 
ductive softness of Isabella's manners com- 
pleted the conquest of her eyes, and he 
became a traitor to honour, gratitude, and 
Montana â€” not scrupling to let the Count 
and Countess imagine, as a means of in- 
ducing them to favour his addresses to 
their daughter, that it was indeed the in- 
tention of the rvlarchese Montana to make 
him his heir; neither to write to this un- 
suspicious friend that she by no means jus- 
tified the report given of her charms; not- 
withstanding which, how^ever, it was his 
intention, if his patron objected not to the 
measure, to endeavour to recommend him- 
self to her favour, his situation in life ren- 
dering birth and fortune of more estima- 
tion in his eyes than personal accomplish- 
ments. 

As he expected, Montana readily and 
joyfully accorded him the permission he had 
thus artfully solicited, to pay his addresses 
to the Lady Isabella, accompanied with 
his best wishes for the success of his suit. 

These 



THE DISCARDED SON. 3 1 5 

These wishes were speedily accom- 
plished. Carloj yet scarcely in the bloom 
of life;, and possessed of all that heaven or 
earth could bestow to render him amiable 
â€” the finest symmetry of form, the most 
seducing manners, eyes eloquently expres- 
sive of the movements of his soul, the 
rarest and the most dazzling accomplish- 
ments â€” soon succeeded in inspiring Isabella 
with wishes responsive to his own. 

Her happiness was too precious to her 
parents to permit them to control her in- 
clination in the present instance, although 
an immediate, instead of expected, acquisi- 
tion of fortune, would have been a very 
agreeable circumstance to them; their 
own, through various circumstances, being 
so much impaired, that, at this period, 
they found it nearly inadequate to the 
maintenance of that splendor hereditary 
pride made them anxious to keep up. 

The nuptials of their daughter agreed 
on, and to which Carlo contrived a plau- 
sible pretext both to him and them for 
not inviting Montana, the most magnifi-

cent fetes took place at the castle in ho- 
nour of them. Amongst the other enter- 
tainments given on this occasion at Cla- 
riziO;, was a grand tournament in the Spa- 
nish style^ arranged by Carlo^ and con- 
trived by him, in order to obtain a better 
opportunity of displaying his fine figure 
and accomplishments to his mistress tiian 
he had yet obtained. 

This entertainment was held in the 
great lawn before the castle, and at either 
side of which elevated balconies were 
erected for the ladies. 

A troop of Christian knights fii-st en- 
tered the field;, headed by Carlo, and ha- 
bited alike in coats of purple and yellow 
silk, with shining helmets, adorned with 
waving plumes of white feathers^ gold- 
cased scy meters suspended from their left 
sides by a 'chain of the same metal^ and on 
their left arms polished steel targets â€” the 
device, two hands united, in gold inlaidâ€”

Next followed a troop of Moorish 
knights^, habited in coats of scarlet, richly 
embroidered with white^ and flowers of 
gold^ gorgeous scymeters falling from 
their sides^ and their shields of ozicr â€” the

To these succeeded the Saracen chiefs,

stones, their targets studded with emeralds

of the day ; and the air was rent with ac- 
clamations, on his again approaching it, to 
receive from her fair hand the prize allot- 
ted to the victor. 

To this day of pleasure succeeded a night 
of pain, or rather torture, to Carlo. His 
native honour and generosity, revived by 
the chivalrous exercises in which he had 
been engaged^ he reviewed with horror 
and detestation the treachery of his con- 
duct towards Montana; and in the parox- 
ism of repentance and- remorse it excited, 
resolved on surrendering Isabella. 

" Oh, Montana/' he wildly exclaimed, 
as he formed this soul-harrowing resolu- 
tion, *â– ' to what a cruel alternative have you 
reduced me ! Could you not, should you 
not have foreseen, that if the beauty of 
Isabella accorded with the portrait drawn 
of it, the ardent eye of youth could scarce- 
ly gaze on her with impunity } Too in- 
considerate friend, you have undone me, 
since, if I give her up, I die â€” if I perse- 
vere in making her mine, I relinquish that 
without which life will be hateful. Endâ€” â€¢

THE DISCARDED SON. 319 

end, oh Heaven ! in mercy end this dread- 
ful struggle between passion and virtue^ 
by taking me to thyself!" 

To regain the height, however, from 
which impetuous love had hurried him, 
was beyond the resolution of Carlo to at- 
tempt; and in order to try and reconcile 
himself to his conduct, he had recourse to 
sophistry, persuading, or rather trying to 
persuade, himself (for neither reason nor 
conscience are as easily silenced as we but too 
frequently wish them to be) that he should 
act still more basely, more unjustifiably 
now, if, after winning the heart of Isabella, 
he gave her up, than he lv\d previously 
done towards his friend. In a word, love 
triumphed over every other con deration ; 
and he became the husband of Isabella, flat- 
tering himself that in her arms he should 
quickly lose all tormenting remembrances. 
But he soon found that he had indeed but 
flattered himself, when he indulged such a 
hope â€” found that while mem^ory held its 
place, he must be m.iserable â€” soon found, 

that

that o-uiit never vet laid a foundation for 
happiness. 

The anguish inflicted by his continual 
self-reproaches vv^as aggravated by the con- 
stant dread he was in of his treachery being- 
discovered by Montana^ and of consequence 
his being held up to public scorn ; for well 
he knew Montana was not a man to be of- 
fended with impunity â€” so well indeed^ that 
but for the restraints he fancied a high 
sense of honour imposed upon him,, he 
would not^ from his knowledge of his warm 
and vindictive temper^ have been without 
an apprehension of becoming his victim in 
every sense of the word, should his perfidy 
be ever betrayed to him,"

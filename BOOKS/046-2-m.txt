LfcONTiNi could with difficulty"support the varied thoughts and apprehensions that chased each other, in quick succes¬ sion, across his mind. 'Carraccio would. never, after the attestations of his honor, betray him, and leave him to the execra¬ ble power'of Paoli. No! he dared'not think that he was in treacherous bands,· but looked with anxious eye for the ap- VOL. ii. в
proach of the Neapolitan. The night was waning fast ; the dark and chilly region in which he was bound, and the thick «air, that seemed to hustle near him, required a desperate fortitude to with¬ stand its paralyzing effects. He moved round the dungeon with a heavy but hurried step, his bosom poignant with the state of its sufferings. .The cell was spacious ; its vaulted roof and dark pro¬ jecting walls, rudely shaped from its immense rocky basis, fully pourtrayed the strength, as likewise the horror of its situation. To be immured in an abode of almost superhuman contrivance, and probably under the momentary threat of death, was a contemplation that heigh¬ tened his mind and feelings to a sense nearly of madness. He staggered, weakr ened by sickening emotion, along the

to the sacrifice of Golfieri?'' meditated Leontini. His ideal suggestions were impeded from further dissertation by the known voice of Golfieri, who, in atone of partly suppressed inquiry, cried,— " This step, Rosalviva, will unhinge you ;—I regret that it has gone so far." " Peace, Conte Paoli, or you will teach me to consider you fearless. How can the attainment of an act like this be con¬ formable to fear? Rather that of gra¬ tification and triumph. Stromboli, un¬ bolt the door, and to the fulfilment of thy present mission !" " Stay," interrupted Paoli, " first be assured of the attendance of Carraccio and his follower. Stromboli, see who waits at the grating near the lake;—
yonder passage," pointing to a narrow extremity of the avenue, *' breaks itself into the subterranean vault. This key opeus the grating. On the swelling surface of the waters floats the barque of Carraccio." The confidant, lighting a torch from the small lamp carried by Paoli, pro¬ ceeded along the route marked by the Conte, and was momentarily lost from discernment. Rosalviva concealed the lamp vvhich the ruffian had left.—The Conte care¬ fully removed a small pannel of the door, and whispering to Rosalviva, exclaimed, " Unobserved we may here behold the last moments of the object of our mu¬ tual abhorrence."

in „eagerness, mixed „with excessive tre¬ mor, hurried from the.dungeoii. The echo .heightened the .explosion Of thei pistol, and „its /peal vibrated inces¬ santly throughout the surrounding vaults. Leontini stood aghast with the terror of the moment. Carraccio was beside him ; he perceived the sensations of his mind; he essayed to soothe rather than pro¬ voke their irritation, and, in affiance to his fidelity, his hand was extended as the pledge. "Signore Leontini! these incidents amount to mystery. -To the Conte Paoli I have done all that his thirsting ven¬ geance designed, and still have preserved the bond of faith* to you.

and the wind of Sicily must waft you from its shores for ever. Follow, Sig¬ nore !" \ The voice of Carraccio was audible and impressive; it was not the tone of fellowship, but that of command; and without one word uttered in reply, Le¬ ontini yielded to its authority. They left the dungeon by way of a cavity ingeniously contrived in the wall, which opened to a passage of narrow and low interior, it was with much diffi¬ culty considered passable, but Carraccio seemed familiar with its intricacy, and repeating his directions to Leontini, they vvere speedily in the midst of a path more ' capacious and lofty. The current of air that seemed to rush near him, 5 indicated'that their approach was towards the'exterior ot' the building;

The dark wave upon 1 the bay was roiling swiftly, and he could perceive, with trifling endeavour, the spray of the water whicb appeared to dash against the outside of the cavern. Carraccio applied a key to a circular grating, and yielding to its power, the almost starless sky and the serpentine'track ofthe lake vvere at once before his gaze, in the distance was floating a small boat, in wnich two men seenied in waiting to the summons of the Neapolitali. , They advanced, Carraccio entered it, Leontini followed I and 'amidst' the nearly total silence of the scene, the boatmen rowed /f ' r ■ · i from the pallazzi. . ţ ; The night had become completely tranquila v and the little vessel glided,' в 5

Visconti had caught the arni ofMiis companion,. and „hurrying through an «arched; portico, knocked loudly «at* .the' entrance«*of. v a small isolated, buildings which the/light of a lamp affixed to its exterior/render-i ed just discernible. i>
The demand f' of 'admission was scarcely repeated, when the grating was withdrawn, and the visage of an old attendant, upon Whose browtthe silvery hair of age and·debility was'scattered, protruded itself.' -ι fi Now, Melfi, the door!" impatiently commanded Carraccio, as the old man was attentively surveying-the'-appear¬ ance of his visitors. ' ь -г " ľfaith, by the holy San Pietro, 'tis the Signor'Visconti !"tpleasantly spake the dependant of the Neapolitan ; and lighting up his furrowed features with a smile, he unbarred the door. - Leontini and his guide were conducted into a spacious »hall, from whence a half- dismantled 1 stair-case 'gave ascent to a circular corridor, leading to a number of apartments, which formed a gallery,
or roŕonda,, around which the 'Neapolitan throwing! his eye,! r ehquired if; the apart¬ ments ,had been prepared? ¡, ■ ν!' Aye¿ right welcomeIy,ì Signor; j and saving your worshipful presence, ľll be¬ stir me to give ye admission." м . · t Thei attendant was preceding the Neapolitan and Leontini, when the former, detaining his arm, cried, 'f Save thine old limbs the toil, and retire." « " E'en as« your «worship wishes it," re¬ plied the tottering Melfi; "the*,samt& commend уои, as I aiwaySi importune:" and facetiously bowing to -Visconti ami the Signor Leontini, hé descended from the hall. ■ l· r> й Ь *n tv ?

"And this building!" ejaculated Leon¬ tini, under an impression of evident sur¬ prise and dismay. ¡ f " Is their abode!' Jt adjoiits the rocky dormitory, sacred to. St. Rosalia;· ano! the staff) the crucifix, and the pilgrim's exterior is uo,less familiar to the achieve¬ ment of Carraccio, than is the full flagon and trusty carbine of his comrades. JHi- ther, Signor^ you may on the latter score judge for yourself." Carraccio took a lamp, and conduct- iug the Signor through an antichamber, they descended an almost perpendicular flight of steps, intoja/ region thatseemed i Ml J4 the receptacle of death and misery. He was prevented from .contemplation, by
the clamorous shout of laughter that burst from the τ extremity of the vault, and he followed, in, silence,*to /whence the boisterous mirth seemed to proceed. The Neapolitan paused, and, extin¬ guishing his light, he placed Leontini near a small cavity, where the nocturnal group were in the same glance before him; it was an interior cavern, capa* cious,and lighted with various suspended lamps from the arched and canopied roof. A number of individuata in ap¬ pearance and character something be¬ yond: the common description of men, were collectively seated round a massive table, profusely spread with viands, an unusual description of wines, and other refreshments in the utmost abundance. A smaller table was placed at the further corner of the vaulted apartment, and
about half a dosen coarse figures, whose cöäntenäncesvaud* manne* told their in¬ feriority,* were closely engaged'in ia spe¬ cies of-gaming in which theysôetoéd to participate with general delight. "·" The curse of Siciily-follow the winner's joy," savagely exclaimed one ofthe party, as he threw down a ducat and a few florins, the amount of his ill success.·■ * · I "< Paltry fool," replied another of the party, and he rose from the table in an articulation of frightful malice—" тоау I be broke upon the wheel and hanged in chains till eternity* if I avenge not this insult." iiss i ί - "■ Peace, Ghoto,'' vociferated a voice seemingly in'comtøand, *íí,how ofťis the community' to beûdisturbédtwith /your cowardly broils ; by* the cross of St;» Ja-

The mind and sensations « of Leontini were dis¬ turbed »and agitated; he feared to antici¬ pate where the scene of his present cir¬ cumstances would *end. , " Let* them, re vel in theirmirth," spoke Carraccio, " time will not admit of our presence among them ; you perceive, Sig¬ nore, thé strength of my arm, or aş I should mfev¿-that which it. can com¬ mand ; butító our apartment, I have one request to secure and which is dependent only vvith you." ■ He pointed to the directed course in apparent caution, 'and preceding'the Sig¬ nore Leontini they gained- the<fgallery, chamber^
" 1 hasten, Signore, to put you in pos¬ session of a few incidents whereby you may collect the circumstances of him who пай some claim as your friend—· you, Signore, can forward his views, and promote in some degree his peace ; listen : Under au early passion and prospects ofa brilliant fortune, I became enamoured with the charms and person ofthe offspring ofa Sicilian noble. We were united, but I did not then know that 1 conducted to the marriage vows, one whose ideas were more of eternity and loneliness, than of the bright inspiration and joys ofa young and handsome bride. Time, and the constaut succession of every variety, failed in its efforts for the procuration of her happi- nesíD, and iu less than two months I scarcely knew the sacred tie of matri-· m ony beyond its name. ït was obvious

Of her endeavours and attain¬ ment aí happiness, I might speak some few words, since she essayed to deserve it ; l?ut- tbe caqkerworm of disease and malady was fastened upon her çopsiitu- tipn, and she was l?prţ\e along the wçajin spme stream of life by its siov^ and pain¬ ful iiBjpulse.

" She is dead?" interrupted Leontini. " Not so, Signore, she lives, but in po¬ verty, for our fortune and family alike deserted us." The Neapolitan brushed away a tear that, was approaching, and assum¬ ing his self-composure, added, " You will not refuse me what I b.ave to ask, but î will detail the sequel. The cţişpo-

gradations 1 arrived at honour, and subì sequently, what í had industriously laboured for, the confidence and friend¬ ship of Ruggieri. I possess it, and must hope to use it witli advantage; a select band of partisans in the cause of liberty and independence, are ready to die for its rights ; to be brief, Signore, it is the voice of these, my friends, that rouses me to the dukedom of Palermo. Zestrozzi, a Sicilian captive, and the descendant of a noble race, of Greek independence, is' the enthusiast of our party; and the dor¬ mant spirit of his ancestry will, in the eventful and coming day, again burst 'forth with all its vigour. To this hour thfey look with ardour and devotion. The Conte Golfieri has been deemed the barrier to all our hopes, but «this act directed, Signore, to you, removes him VOL. II. с
from Palermo, or death will release its demand. " As I have been the willing instru¬ ment to your preservation from a death unjustly merited ; as I have renewed an existence which ere this is considered annihilated, you will not, for a period at least, refuse to hold it in secresy and honour. Signore, I can almost project your reply, but await my conclusion. There will come a time when your in» juries may find atonement; might I deign to, advise, I could picture such torments and such horrors, to pursue the every step of thy betrayer, that all the collective miseries inflicted on the heart and feelings of man should be parallel· in his. Continue true, Signore, to my counsels, and you will never cease to rçsrret them."
«I will, I wiirdo all you may impose on me ; and am thy debtor for ever.'· " Enough ; now, 'Signore, for the per¬ formance of that dutý ï would have devolve upon you." The Neapolitan took from his bosom a letter carefully sealed; and delivering it to Leontini, added,' "This, Signore, I entrust to your 'charge, to be given to the hands'of my wife; the abode a\id scene of her misery is some leagues from hence, but it will not. discourage you, Signore?" The tone of the Neapolitan at this moment was sb pathetic and so earnest, that had the request been made to one ofkless obligation than Leontini, it must have dot passed unsuccessful ; he took his hand, and pressing it,'further pro¬ ceeded, " You will be the spectator of a
cheerless portrait* a valueless relic from the hand,of Nature ; butat was not^y means that made it thus; my wife was destined to another sphere-r-it was that which pointed to heaven;—but 1 digress. In a remote and humble part of the province of Reggio, upon the coast of Naples, is the abode of Signore del Capucio ; he is the foster brother of my maternal parent, and to his protec¬ tion is committed the wife of your nar¬ rator; this letter contains an order upon the Viceroy's Court, for the payment of one hundred pistoles. On your fide¬ lity, 1 cheerfully rely, You will avoid Palermo, till the communication of Yisconti hails your return ; in the mean time, the flame which lights up my ambition brightens also the prospect of your's."

" I have nought to ask, but in loving thee to receive its full reward," warmly replied the Comptessa* and her full bril¬ liant eye spoke at once all the internal gratifications of her soul. A splendid banquet was served up in the principal suite of apartments of the Romagno Castelli, in all the mag¬ nificence and showy splendour which the Comptessa was capable of affording. The evening was passed amidst every enjoyment human appetite could desire, or the fancy create. Rosalviva and the Conte were its sole participators, and in each other's fervent caresses they received the supremacy of earthly bliss. The night elapsed before Golfieri reached the ducal pallazzi of Ruggieri. An attendaut signified that the Duca had
m .earnest inquiry desired the presence of the Conte. Paoli retired to" his own apartment, and, with the earliest beam of day, awaited the command of Ruggieri. He had traversed the chamber some mi¬ nutes prior to the appearance of the venerable Duca, whose cold salutation upon his entrance called forth a mingled degree of surprise and apprehension. "The request of my uncle and pro¬ tector Γ have with pleasure obeyed," interjected 'Golfieri, anxious to break the susperise his mind had encountered. " Paoli," answered the Duca, " the period' is arrived that opens a new and interesting page in the volume of your exstence." ' " What means your Highness ?" em-

information he, had become possessor of the, means for such insinuations which had .been« made, and from whom r he could have gleaned facts which, amidst his ovvn disquietude, he could but ac¬ knowledge as plausible; and the more he contemplated, the more agitated were his thoughts. The power and charms of Rosalviva were too firmly fixed on his mind to cause a moment's thought contrary to her pleasure ; and, however fatal the consequences, his soul was resolved to forfeit every hope—every prospect, rather than the hand and af¬ fection of the Comptessa. " Yes," he pronounced, in the delirium of his ima¬ gination,^'thou art mine only, and no human interference, divine Rosalviva, can or shall f part us." • "Cursediand obdurate boy,unworthy
the claim οι relative! 5 DärVíťó ; disre¬ gard my injunctions, aulí',my resentment 1 ' shall« ìiglit upon your * desolate arid blighted hopes for ever !" ""'"* '."Tt must then—it musi!" solemnly ejaculated Golfieri, and" he stood'ab¬ sorbed in the wreck of his feelings. "Away, then, mistaken and relentless fool ! 'Hide "thyself and' thy name 'from my reóóllebtion for ever; let no hope of pardon wanton' in thy breast,' nor suffer the calamities which must inevitably overtake you, to plead thy future atone¬ ment. No, the feelings which my old and care-worn heart so long Has che¬ rished, will, by this act, be 'vanquished ; and with felicity will I erase from memo¬ ry my paternal care for Paoli Golfieri. Awäy ! away to the arms of your para¬ mour, and revel in thy course of infamy,"
The social-sentiments of Leontini were overwhelmed;, he scarcely knew how to reply; Conscience, and the «recurrence to the untimely death of Beo Cardoni, impelled his silence; he already felt the stain upon him,, that proclaimed him assassin; he thought he perused its mockery and reproach, in the stern brow of the Duca; he dreaded lest still more of his pursuits were known by him, and that the fate of laeontini was alike of their number. Was Carraccio sincere with him ? Had he not whispered to „Ruggieri every transaction linked with the ill-fated correspondence and des- struction of his friend ? Might he not provoke the wrath of Ruggieri to yield him to. public justice and punishment, and what was then his; doom?—the scaffold! He paused. No, Carraccio
'could not have betrayed him, and in its confidence' he .enjoyed a momentary î re¬ léase from the wildness of his rumina¬ tions. During the chain of reflections which 'had ào'Wireathed itself Jaround the mind -of Golfieri, the Duca had retired,'and the •Conte 4 was for some minutes insensible to his absence. " Now, Rosalviva," he cried, on the recognition of his situ¬ ation, " j s the period when the proof of thy attachment will be given, * Golfieri iipan outcast! Wilt thou shelter him? He stands alone in the vast World, un¬ friended ; will thy arms be open to him ? will thy embrace testify »that he still is your's?--*-Oh, -be it so! and his life, his death, öre wholly thine;''thou art his future world!" These were the touchfes of imagery
. i - i-t his fancy traced, and he hastened to effect its colouring; every "soft ånd en¬ dearing' 'moment he'häď received with Rosalviva, every art that he had con¬ trived to ascertain her regard for him, and every' sacrifice he'had 'known her to bë 'capable of 'submitting to, came forci¬ bly to his recollection, and he felt too strongly persuaded that his appeal, and his willing deprivation from splendor, rank, and riches, that his sudden change from thence to poverty, would not be reviewed' by her in ' vain, and he rested assured that he still should be retained within'her heart, with every earnest and willing pressure. Hé 'found the object of his adoration, in r anxibus thought? awaiting his approach. Her eyes and heart hailed him with a lover's joy, and another moment marked
* ,i {, «■* X J i' * .-i i' herrapturpus embrace. ir He,waş silenţ; —it was an unusual ¡quietness: Rosal- viya could not fail to notice its apathy, and questioned its influence. She kissed, in repeated fervour, the .cheek; she pe¬ rused there the lines of care and anxiety : and she, solicited with persuasive elo¬ quence, its derivation. " Speak, Gol¬ fieri, thou must not know concealment with Rosalviva." " 1 would not, dearest girl ; and 'tis thus I meet the idol of this wretched heart, to speak our last farewell." t c ,The Comptessa was abstracted in silence ; he pressed her hand, within his, and fixing his eye «full .upon heij cjţianged features, uttered,·—" Rosalviva, 1 lose, not your firmness ! I have shown mine, and if, I can suffer your loss, it will be only
in the satisfaction, 'that-l· have repelled the cause of your unhappiness)" The voice of the Comptessa faltered, tnd with excessive emotion she almost ■naudibly asked, " Wherefore,,Golfierb this sacrifice ? ίο what am I doomed ?" " Happiness, dearest Rosalviva, must bé your's ; but I—1 am not so lost to the feelings of'humauity to seek its des¬ truction, nor will I. In less words, the wretched Paoli is a beggar,- he kneels to you, humbled, friend less, and destitute. You, Rosalviva, are too valuable to be ipaaVthe partner of such a desolation of iny* Hopes, and, whatever, may be the conflict, V resign yòù with the prayer for your real and everlasting felicity.'* An' in ward -' pang' of terror coiled round 1 the* heart of the Comptessa ; she
conjured Paoli no Jonger, to^torture s her. in the darkness of a horror, vvhich his 'intimations conveyed,.and , assuming.;an apparent calmness, cried,—" Speak, I will be obedient to all thou canst de¬ mand !" " I know it, Rosalviva; I am con¬ vinced of it," he kissed her lips with ardour, and detailed, during the collection of his spirits, the narrative of the Duca's confession and treatment. " And to the utmost extent," added he, " ofthe Duca's malediction will I cheerfully subscribe, rather than bring down one afflicting hour upon Rosalviva. This night proves the fortitude I can command, ano! we separate for ever." ■ ^ , " The ,God which created us, prohibits such an act !" in emotion oi\ courageous and energetic feeling, exclaimed the

" Signora Rosalviva," spake'Vivaldi in a voice of much impression^ " I come, probably for the last time, for a confer¬ ence with you alone." ΐ He Monk paused, and the chilling silence which his introduction created, seemeciio' render the terror of her mental faculties more predominant ; his glance was fixed upon her; the filmy hue of dissolution she fancied to reveal itself in iťs'hdllow ligliţ 'aiid she averted the gaze with tremulous impatience. " Sig¬ nora," resumed'the Monk, "Iwill beg,
for the present instance* to throw aside the, terms upon vvhich we have hitherto been,, known. I, approach you in a character more indulgent, more appeal¬ ing,—that of a parent." t Rosalviva started; she turned to the visage of the Padre, its features were mois¬ tened by a tear ; it afforded her a strength of mind she bad not calculated on, and in щоге collected thought and po«sitive emphasis, she requested him to proceed. t{ Tell me then, Rosalviva, the fate of Leontini, my son·" " Thy son!" instantly interjected the Comptessa. " Leoutini, the offspring of the Padre Vivaldi ? Mysterious соп- fession. Ob, thou indefinable Creator, to, what strange discoveries thy might and power leads us !" ¡ I · The Confessor piously crossed his
breast; and awaited the reply of Rosal¬ viva. ν She shuddered-j'and «the untimely destruction of Leontini rushed across her mind, withJthe accusation bf'mur¬ deress ; she felt almost paralyzed* with the variety of sensations her ì sensibility encountered. - u , . " Speak, Rosalviva 1" urged* thé radre, " the" anxiety of a father demands it ; tell me what authority secrets him from my presence, arid if my hopes Of paternal joy should depart so soon? I ask in mercy, Signora ; the language of a father's breaking heart is not a common appeal." ■ . · ■ " Padre Vivaldi," replied the Comp¬ tessa, her self-possession bating over¬ come-her painful ruminations, tť I am not answerable for the singular vicissi¬ tudes attendant upon mortality."
The Confessor was silent ;^RosaİYİvâ beheld with gratification the- distress,his niind seemed'to partake of, and, amidst its contest, she triumphantly assumed all her accustomed spirit'and greatness. " Speak, my daughter, if there be ought you can communicate, in' justice to what I ask, and believe me, the act of kindness shall not go unrewarded." " In what instance can 1 look for requital at the hands of the Padre Vi¬ valdi? The Signore Leontini's conduct has warranted the authority öf my re¬ sentment ; but, setting aside my disposi¬ tion of parleying at this unusual hour, I answer, that the Signore Leontini has received the punishment due to meanness and cowardice; -actuated·, by -¡motives known only to his own breast-, he sought to practise them, by fictitious garb, and

"ÄJy soil desíi'oyed !" and the couri- tenance' of tlie^ Padre underwent a totál change ; liis black aiid sunken eyes were '' raised in lixed excl am ation to " h is Creator, 'and the pallid and trembling lip, the 3 flushed and damp cheek,
severally told the internal, .pang,, the horror of such an enunciation cost r him. "Inhuman woman,, and w,as it, at thy \' ' > "i'' ι I.i ^ *« v decree he suffered ?" ,frightfully..pro¬ nounced the Confessor, and an almost preternatural strength of voice and action seemed to inspire him. í' Great God ! do I stand here unappalled in the confessions pf a murderess ! dp not the heavens listen to thy crimes? doth its lightnings fly, and not sear you ?" " Peace, wayward old man, or thou wilt repent this ! Know, that had not his temerity carried him beyond his discretion, he might have ¡still existed, the deluded offspring of the pious Vi¬ valdi. But no, he needs tnust seek in quarrel those who would have willingly held forth the hand of.peace; the strength of his sword haplessly failed, D 5
and his presuming aud wicked intent was crushed with others, for ever." The Padre sunk .upon his knees, his features were hidden within his extended hands r and during, some moments a solemn ejaculationpassed his utterance, and which the entrance of Golfieri in¬ terrupted. " Now, babbling and officious Monk!" cried he, " what has thy resolution framed ? Look up and see the antagonist of the fierce and avengeful Leontini; see in me the man who, drawn by this heated Signore to open combat, has decided his doom ; and see in me the avowed protector of the Comptessa Rosalviva.— t Yes, look at me well, Paoli Golfieri !" The Padre fixed a look of keen anguish upon thè erect and haughty
figure ofthe Cobte V the liiŕingled sen¬ sations of horror,'grief, and"revenge, all lighted up his bosom with*the most poignant feeling, to the'being'who' stood in bitter and cruel· menace before hit«. His existence bad been changed"with him ; he saw in him the destroyer of his hopes and his offspring ; his "withered sinews seemed strung with tenfold vigour, and he fastened upon the throat of Paoli, writhing in acute torture. The Conte with facility dashed the Padre from his hold, and darting a look upon him of the most vindictive wrath, cried, " Frantic priest ! what presump¬ tion blindly leads you lo this attack? Wretched old man, bút i pardon-It, since it moves my pity, rather than my resentment."

He drank deeply of the beverage before him, intoxication soon followed, and he sunk into a' heavy but unsettled slumber. The mind 'and soul of Rosalviva were moulded from more stern and impene¬ trable materials than those of Golfieri ; left to herself, she felt no shame, no ter- • ■ ¿. tl ' r' « . , ror, no remorse ; " she paused not to ■« i.j think on wháť condition her iniquitous and"daring- acts rested; her soul was wrapt up in one sp'ellonly, and toits4n- fluence she was irrevocably bound ; she
cared not to be drawn from its illusion ; she felt that with «Paoli her life was wholly hinged ; it t was, so indissolubly chained, that even should «destruction follow the unity, she would rather look forward to its triumph than shrink from one t moment's loss in Golfieri's love. With Leontini she remembered to have breathed,.totally an opposite passion; it wiiS the gleaming of a first and uncertain love; her own bosom knew not its legi¬ timate feelings; under its then false and delusive sensibility she had encouraged the addresses of one whose esteem ' ' > J!« ¡strengthened as it journeyed onwards. In the artificial warmth of her bosom she had proffered the repose and happi¬ ness of a heart devoted t to her controul ; she suffered it to remain there until a 'J' '** '■· new object envied its felicity, and for * * iľ\ l

An affair of import¬ ance, it is supposed, urged iiim to visit this castelli at the cessation of his pious labours ; this intimation was made by him to the members of the order who attended him, and whose evidence upon the salvation ofthe cross has been given to ihe Superior, They further state, that

" Vivaldi!" " Me culpable!"severally interjected Paoli and the ; Comptessa, Mid their mutimi attempt at consterna¬ tion and ignorance was exceeded only by the dismay and agitating tremor which their manner evidently betrayed. A strange and unmeaning look of won¬ der was observable upon each of the domestics, whose innocence the exces¬ sive vacuity of mind and conduct ren¬ dered colourable. 'J'he official visitors were retiring, Ro¬ salviva caught the arm of the principal
speaker, and assuming a confidence of tone and courage, which excess of fear had made desperate, criedi^ " How, in¬ solent intruder, därest thou, in the pre¬ sence of my household,· thus rudely pro¬ claim insinuations which, for motives unknown, the name and character of the heiress of Romagno suffers under?

To the announcement 1 cf a domestic of the Conte Golfieri's visit, he directed that an engagement of a limited interval had taken him from the pallazzi, and his return would be one hour previous to the evening vesper.' Paoli was disturbed lesť the counsel of Visconti should be precluded from him, and anxious that he should be in possession, upon the earliest "moment of his arrival, of the tenor of his' vìsié,' he sat down in 'an ante-chamber, and ad¬ dressed to him the following sketch :—

"To .speak of it in terms of í reflection," remarked the Conte, " were folly ; the mischief is done, and to remedy the evil arising therefrom, isour present study ; say -then, Visconti, —how it is to be accomplished." ·'*< Fear nothing, my Lord ; an acknow¬ ledgment í of a thousand pistoles, with your .signature, puts the affair to rest; thisV and-further marks of „respect pro¬ mised to í the rank of those to whose official authority the investigation is

Paoli flew to the embrace of the Comptessa ; his countenance pourtrayed the joy his heart bad received, and he threw himself in the embrace of Rosal¬ viva with peculiar warmth and ecstacy of feeling ; smiles of mutual gratifica¬ tion played upon the cheeks of the lovers, as the account of Carraccio'» zeal was stated by Golfieri. The few hours flew with agreeable celerity, till tlie vesper bell of the St. Ľsprit Convent told the coming time for their departure.

little longer, till when my measure of vengeance be filled." The Neapolitan in hasty step crossed the piazza of the building, and was speedily in the ducal pallazzi. It was at the close of a perilous con¬ test between the Greek and Saracen camp and the protectors of Sicily's rights, that registered the debt of grati¬ tude made by the Conte Golfieri to the Neapolitan Carraccio. The Sicilian troops,worn by fatigue, and overpowered by increasing aid from bands of Greek and other ^renegades, whose strength was still, receiving additional supply, when a detached brigade, commanded by one of the Ruggieri, and in whose lists the Conte Golfieri was second in command,, were securing a retreat to an opposite shore, that in the most guarded
and well defended ambush was secreted 1 /'** V я powerful body of Greek soldiers— Carraccio wás their leader—-hundreds of Sicily's bravest men fell at the first attack—to continue further resistance was madness. Already had the Rug- gl'eri commander bled and expired in the struggle; Golfieri was singled out as the representative of princely power «md usurpation, and the swords of a ferocious horde crowded to drink their oppressor's blood. The sword of Car¬ iacelo was foremost; the young Conte ¡sunk upon his knees—" Hold, Neapoli¬ tan,'' he exclaimed, " this is but feeble conquest for one of thy race ; yield mea t 1 life so humbly won, und Palermo's high¬ est dignity is your's for ever," The band were silenced, and Carrac¬ cio, sheathing his weapon, replied,—
"Take it, young prince, and be the pledge «exchanged.' 1 * * Few survived to tell the slaughter of thatday; such as were of the victorious shared the spoils ofthe field. Visconti, aud a party of their most distinguished leaders, were proffered reward and pro¬ tection by the Conte Golfieri ; and, vvith the residue of his followers, they em¬ barked ou board a vessel, which, after a few days' uninterrupted sail, anchored in the mole of Palermo. The pride of conquest had swelled the bosom of Paoli, and he thirsted with pride and joy, fatal as had terminated the enter¬ prise, to be the hero of that eventful pe¬ riod, r To .the Neapolitan his desires were communicated ; they were sanctioned, and the friends of Carraccio echoed his exclamations, which announced Golfieri
as their conqueror ;- half* the wealth and half the dignities of Palermo's dukedom was the award ; honour decreed the pledge ; in »obedience to such a dictate, Carraccio and his partisans held them¬ selves as * dependant Upon the (bounty and protection of the -Sicilian, and with the same'feeling he undertook to realize their most prominent wishes. The Conte' Golfieri's escape from death and slavery was hailed with en¬ thusiasm by'the old Dùca; it-lived for a time inthe bosom of his countrymen; but few there were who had noti suffered too much in the loss of their kindred to acknowledge the festivity of such a day. Upon Carraccio »and -hiš ^'partners in toil;" as the courageous refugees to'the Sicilian standard,-various 'honors'-were allotted; and to a certain degree,-and'for
a time, they severally enjoyed the sove¬ reign's munificence. Seven years had elapsed since the memorable era, since then the patronage of royalty had di¬ minished. Carraccio only had been fortunate enough to secure its greater portion ; the repining of his fellow refu¬ gees was construed into rebellion, and for the crime had suffered condemnation to the gallies ; their act of mercy was forgotten ; they were held in contempt ; on the dependance only of the Neapo¬ litan had they endured an existence ; a wretched abode in a remote part of the Province sheltered the remnant of once noble conquest; in bitter contumely they lamented the tie that bound them to Sicilian treachery; but-there was a spirit lurking still beneath the ashes of their faded glory, that warmed the heart
amidst despair, and buoyed them up with hopes of wealth and liberty, A binali secluded cloister was the scene • * wheie their woes and captivity were alike deplored: they had assembled earlier than usual, a communication from Carraccio had thrown fire" into their bo¬ soms, and they looked for his approach. The dark wave of the Mediterranean was attaining its brighter hue; the blue streak of morning gradually proclaimed Us empyreal sway along the vast space of atmosphere, and the almost unruffled breeze told in murmuring accents the softness of the hour. Thrice had the refugee, Zestrozzi, ascended a projecting pier to watch the rippling of the current on which was expected the barque of Visconti. —" îîe comes not/'exclaimed he, while his full eye seemed fixed upon
the distant^ sliorei -V My· i country,* for thrice * three' ι burning, summers h , have behekbthihe heights rising from the deep ocean -which* Surrounds» thee,v oh,-what are these' eyes doomed' to^be' seared withr—Curse upon- this-yielding heart, for thathour that marked myiread upon Sicily's margin; realms s of pride and scorn,-when will the spiritof my country subdue s íhy haughty tyranny ^ Visconti, thou bastato answer itu.

" Wealth and honour," shouted the Neapolitan, " the wretched remem- ■: · ■ brance of your years of toil and capti- İr vity must now be repaid ; yes, the pledge must be redeemed." " True," replied Kaled, " in the hour of danger his life was granted on such condition, but how have we borne it, Carraccio? in torture and horror—the chains of the galley slave—the bleeding lash of its oppressor ; and from whence can spring the slightest chance of blessed liberty .under the yoke of tyranny like Golfieri's?

"Seated in uninterrupted enjoyment during the midnight mirth of some since departed hours, the subject was dis¬ cussed ; * Francesca must be removed,' vauntingly spake the Conte, his brain and senses half stupified with the wine he had swallowed, and turning to his devoted Carraccio, as he facetiously termed me, added, * This can only be successful but under prudence discreet as thine ; say then, Visconti, next to sovereignty, can Palermo's proudest title and rank be worth thy keeping?'

Too securely in the chains of vice ond crime was the soul of Golfieri iiu ked, to start from those ties which had marked him the creature of infamy and destruc¬ tion. He hadpursued the maddened career of his passions, void of reflection, and when he now hesitated to pause upon it, felicity left him no hope, and hè rushed still further inLo the dark void of the future, to hurry from the scenes
which' hastily * had crowded before him. The nuptials with* Francesca di Branci¬ forte had become the every-day conver¬ sation throughout the province ; intended fetes, public rejoicings, were already in " fancy's eye," for the commemoration of such an event. His mind sickened at the delusion. Thefe was but* little left him to resolve upon, and *its result thereby required instant conclusion. To the guidance of« Carraccio he held himself wholly subservient; the alliance, then, vvith' Francesca was his „first ob¬ jects Visconti, too, had urged it; by him was pointed out the success atten¬ dant, 'and ' under such an authority he determined finally to act; yet when he considered upon the resolution of inti¬ mating to Rosalviva his intentions,] and the prospect of his plans, his heatt en-

immediate union with' Francesca. He felt determined that nb obstacle should hazárd its completimi. The arrangements designed upon foratile subsequent' re- • mbval of Francesca, by the Greek Zes¬ trozzi and his companions, emulated his hopes : and he looked forward to the ceremony that pronounced him at once Duca of Palermo, and Francesca's lord. The time 'hourly approached, and the funeral'torch that"lighted Ruggieri to the grave' was 1 scarcely extinguished, as the acclamation'b'f'Paoli's nuptials were wrung 'in every bar 4 that hoped for its happiness. The Marquis di Branciforte was distantly related by marriage to the family of Ruggieri ; interests aiid amity had strongly cemented their uiiitý'; and in the senate, as well as the còufidence of the Duca, di BraUciforte had long

pation and wildness of character were ultimately not unknown to her, but her soul was too resolutely fixed upon the object of its adoration, to admit of the smallest reproof to deteriorate in the opinion of his value. For months she " pined in secret," keeping her sorrows confined to her own bosom ; she little thought how deeply her heart had been bcerated in the struggle. She little sup¬ posed that on Golfieri her affections were idly lavished ; she did not utterly despair ; there was a triumph still in her heart when she caught his smile, and when the effort of opportunity produced even a temporary meeting; her felicity then was too great not to banish the recollection of the wretchedness which his follies (she knew not a term more appropriate, or of a more harsh descrip-
tion, for his (failings), and his indifference had repeatedly inflicted. To a mind gifted with less acuteness of feeling, the various occurrences of life, society, and its pleasures, may effect a kind of renovation ; but to a soul be¬ yond the ordinary sphere, there is an attainment of sensibility at once fatal. To this species of sensibility is linked a perpetual chain of miseries aud misfor¬ tunes; ambition has no lure for its reco- t. very ; joy has no charm to wean it from its pent up, and blighted disappointnrv" and hope; its pang and its desola^jn yields to an apathy and an indulgence where it lingers a victim, a dreadful vic¬ tim to every sensation of sadness and severity. The sunken eye, the emaciated cheek, and the colourless lip, each pro- chûms its destiny, and points out the

With Golfieri she had treasured up every fairest -hope; in its loss, there" was nought·else left to desire. * This was her situation when her approaching alliance with Paoli became the public* theme ; its sudden transition <" was wondrous— her ?-passions were rekindled, ^ the eye brightened./ and the heart throbbed with new-ardour-î-the impression up^on her spirits was/ powerful-·*-its effect t ajmost produced delirium··*^ medicai aid re¬ stored her, aud with its trøuo^illity she welcomed tbe arrival of that hour, which
joined her hand with .Golfieri. Paoli, during the interval , which intervened before the performance of the,ceremony, had, felt how essential it was to his fu¬ ture prospects, and therefore not only treated her with peculiar respect, but had signified 'how.-unmindful he. had been of the happiness which Fate, and the blessing of Providence, had at length conferred upon him. "Beloved Fran¬ cesca," he exclaimed, at an interview in which she seemed to participate with rapturous acknowledgment, " what an age h ave I not lost in being neglectful tp one so kind, so amiable, as yourself; one so devotedly formed to make existence cheerful and happy ?" Her heart beat in tumultuous gladness at the confession, and. her bright eye turned to his with an expression of sweetest feeling. He kissed
her lips with an apparent fondness, and, whi-e he held her to his bosom, rejoined, — " This heart, Francesca, has been shattered indeed, butit is not so thronged with human frailties to be exempt from every claim worth keeping—oh, no !— there is a portion still lefl deserving the attention and warmth of my Francesca." The bosom of Francesca was too full to allow a freedom to her happiness.— Tears relieved it from anguish, and she clung more closely to the kind embrace of Paoli. He led her to the altar, an intended sacrifice ; to her nuptial couch, without an interfering throb, without a relenting pang. At the period intended for the funeral rites of Ruggieri, the Comptessa Rosal¬ viva had determined upon alimited visit to a distant part of the country ; it was h 5

'It was the first moment, during sohiefew recent years, that he had stayed to reflect,' or question the innate wanderings of his heart. A kind of re- leasemeut from the constant society of Rosalviva, and a portion of indulgence in solitude,' up to* a certain point, during her absence, had seasoned him, as it were, to a kind of reflection, which, as

Ón retiring through an obscure piazzi of the palace, the dark figure of the captive Zestrozzi arrested his attention, and he halted some few moments unperceived, to mark its progress. The known features of Kaled were soon after recognized. The refugees bailed each other in stern and unceremonious compliment. The dim light of the lamps just ren¬ dered their motions perceptible, and the Conte awaited the result in suspi¬ cious anxiety. '.'* Hush!" murmured: the voice of

To pausé upon the incidents of thé moment was d aiigèrous ; the heated enthusiasm and revenge of the refugees was : kindling into' a flame, that spread itself with contagion and destruction. Paoli's figure was hot wholly distinguish¬ able ''by' them ';■ the darkness of the spot, and thè appearance òf his habit, would
render ii less so ; but then it required a nerveless effort to eftect what his ideas were suggesting ;—however, he deter¬ mined to hazard it. Hastily following the direction they had taken, he had not lost many moments when, in a colonade mostopportunely obscure, hepronounced the name of Zestrozzi. ft Speak, stranger, the name of him who seems to hold acquaintance with one so dishonoured," harshly spake the refugee, as he turned to the figure of Golfieri. " 'Tis needless, captive ; but from the Neapolitan Carraccio, I ------ " ,*-.'· " Hold, Signore, thou art his,friend,"< interrupted Kaled. >·; - " Or would not have borne this mis·- ~ sion," unhesitatingly,, and with r steady* , calmness replied the changed voice of t Paoli.
" True ; and its purport ?" angrily muttered Zestrozzi, " Is to give thee instant revenge." . " Revenge'"shouted the captives, and even through the almost total· darkness their large bright eyes flashed with unspeakable fury. " On whom ?" ques¬ tioned tliey. 'i* Ask not thus'idly," remarked Paoli t " it falls upon him who has done the greatest injury ; but, come, the orders of Carraccio must, not admit of delay: beneath the portico nearest the palazzi terrace* the Neapolitan expects you.

However, this shall be our last." ť< It· shall be thy last ! 3> mentally suggested Golfieri, and he enjoyed a kind of triumph that he had so far secured the perfidy of the deluded captives.

< -The husband of Francesca was in¬ dulging in her caresses, when the unex¬ pected reply of Rosalviva was presented to him. His eye but for a moment glanced upon the superscription, and tremblingly he hurried to his closet. He perused its contents ; his bosom was torn with the severity its sentiments conveyed;- he endeavoured to restrain the burst of passion that blazed within him, and in a paroxysm of rage and despair uttered,—" No—she will not hate me !" 'I' . " Hate thee !" murmured Francesca, who had, at the moment of Paoli's agi- tation and mysterious departure from her presence, pursued his steps, desirous to learn its cause. " Hate thee !" and her soft and delicate hand pressed that of Golfieri, " who could hate thee?" The
artíessness of her manner, and the divine countenance that was bent "upon his, softened for a moment his bewildered ejaculations. *' Peace, Francesca !— í am not unused to these touches of frenzy; forgive me," and the visage of Paoli became fixed in mental and gloomy abstraction. The tender Francesca endeavoured, by every affectionate and ' gentle means, to soothe the discomfited feelings of her husband ;—" Nay, 'tis cruel,"'she added, " to withhold from me * the cause of this unhappiness ; tell it me, and 1 will bear thy suffering with patience and resignation, be it but contributable to your comfort." " Oh, thou art worthy a better heart!" inwardly rejoined Paoli, and his sor- i'5
rowing eye^was;-fixed ; Om her^smiling : and cheering countenance.

racked with its weight of anguish, 'and the blood rolled heavily across his heart in painful and contending throbs. He rushed from the'pallazzi to Rosalviva. He threw himself at her feet, and, press¬ ing'her hand with- m uch ardour, while tears escaped from his swollen' eyes, pronounced, "' Rosalviva ! how* have you wronged me;" how йатзп - are? l thy resolves to him"Who· CareS A, not for life were it-not in your keeping;'indeed, T am not deserving of these charges." · ' " Hush !

( t " -Never, Rosalviva; 'no power сап part us." ' ( -у " Insensible being! thy conduct has done it, and thy vaunting is but folly and insanity." « ; ? ! " Oh, no ; at your feet, Rosalviva, in the sight of heaven, I renounce it ; I am your's; death only can prohibit our eternal amity ; how have I not sworn ?" " And how hast thou not annihilated its» allegiance? What canst thou offer now to one like Rosalviva? Thinkest thou her- caresses could be mingled with the feminine blandishments of the object that is termed thy wife? Could Rosal- viva's>íkisses waft away the sweetness imprinted by those of Francesca ? Never would she* stoop to hold affection on such pitiable terms.—Rise, Duca Paulis
nor all thy newly acquired spleďdour, nor all thy honours, can give a charm to a heart like Rosalviva's.—Retire, therì, and give me\ cause to,-forget the name of One so worthless; hence,"perfidious fool I"« -■ The «voice and countenance of the Comptessa attained an< almost appalling emotion.- * The Duca interrupted her, at the same time feigning a kind of com¬ mand and courage, in the which he had hopes to profit, and, ,under· its mingled feelings, he clasped· with vigour the arm of Rosalviva—a look of resentment aided his efforts, he added, " Beware how you also wound the sentiments of a man who has known-"what* it is* to« distract¬ edly love you." - « ,.*■.„' , " . · if '' " Wouldst thou threaten me ?" scorn¬ fully -replied thé Comptessa·; Λ ho w dost thou think that ( the menace of'a being
capable of forfeiting the ties of honour and affection, can be in' théieasť dread¬ ed ?—Miserable supposition ! 'Tis thou who s hast most to dread ; £, tis4hou who-, although now vainly dressed with bridal happiness, may, by the morrow's eve, be wrapt in thy winding sheet." " The will of heaven can extendthè same interposition towards yourself, Rosalviva, was it so ordained, and to all of earth's creatures ; therefore seek' not to sound alarm in such'seeming phan¬ tasies." ι î " ï indulge not in» phantasies ; what voice can speak of the murder ofVLeon- tini h what tongue can \ relate Vivaldi's death? would not this public detail·rob the bride, 'Francesca',' of her Weceutly enjoyed í festivity ¡*· would-not'thisi be 'the summons to thy 'gra ve ?"^
" It would, indeed!"" mentally ex¬ claimed the disconsolate Paoli,' and*the remembrance or ihose" events,- the re¬ membrance, too, of' the deed which brought'Cardoni 5 to the tomb, hurried across"his mind, and %r some few moments it was overwhelmed in ab¬ straction and horror. His heart seemed to-sicken within him when he looked at the power of Rosalviva's* nialignity.' His eyes seemed to'swim in'terror and em¬ barrassment;-they turned from her gaze, and while her impressive and* avengeful menace rang in his ear, it was in vain that he tried 'to dispel the throbs of anguish ' that thronged 'tumultrfóusly upon his swollen heart ; his soul percepti- bly'acknowledged its subservience, and his only refuge 1 was to seek conciliation, rather than opposé it. In* a tranéport
of agony and enthusiasm he threvv him¬ self upon her bosom ; the tone of his ť * voice faltered, his spirits seemed wholly broken, he plaintively uttered, ·' Rosal¬ viva, that the hour should be known in which a meeting like the present should be our's. Oh God ! can it indeed,be possible ?*" *' It is possible," replied the Comp¬ tessa, " but you have been its accom- plisher, Golfieri," her resentment some¬ what lessened as she already witnessed the tears fast rolling down the cheek of Paoli. " Indeed you wrong him, Rosalviva, in this cruel fouspicion of his fidelity." " Psha ! does it not speak its own tale ? needs there further conviction thaii vvhat r has hitherto unfortunately been deduced ?„What can thy alliance with
the Signora Francesca «otherwise pro¬ nounce ! .all that can be done by a man of honour has been done ; sufficient proof of sincerity towards the woman he reveres! Of what avail can it be to Rosalviva, to boas« that the heart you have pledged to her cannot be redeemed ? Insensibility of human weakness ! how doth it affect me, when I pause tc think on such duplicity." " Duplicity was never 'intended to¬ wards thee, Rosalviva. A proof of my sacred and still unbiassed affection for you may be easily recorded ; name but one act which thy will can desire, and if the ability of man can render it effectual, such an act, Rosalviva, is your own Paoli ready to undertak-:." A pulsation of secret joy animated the bosom of the Comptessa, as she, heard
the sentiments of Golfieri.' Feelings which she had-distantly cherished, and which* only wanted some perfect colour¬ ing for their existence, now dawned, upon her imagination with á sensibility she had hitherto but feebly- experienced. Passions that pictured j the extent of her anticipations were now before her in the shape-oiv'reality. The rank of Palermo's Duchessa was a gratification her pride would have en¬ dured any penalty, any suffering to ob¬ tain ; j it had constantly been· the·utmost of her hopes. Amidst all· her hours of pleasure and dalliance with/ Paoli, there was) ever« earnestly kindling within'her bosom f sparks* of sambition^that 1 would eventually be lighted'up, and' als·« the Duchessa^ofrPaolishe'had looked with strengthened 'Confidence.- The v terms
which ''Ruggieri 1 had drawn for Paoli's security of it were at bnce "the annihila¬ tion'of RosalvivaV prospects; this· she heteded not; Paoli loved herland 'every other attainment' was a mere trifling consideration. But vvhát was hér asto¬ nishment on'receivings the'intelligence, and'from Paoli' too, that Francesca shared his nuptial'couch.' The feelings of an insulted and neglected woman are "of but one kindj and such feelings were cherished by Rosalviva to their utmost inspiration.* The flush of enterprise'ex¬ hilarated her niind and spirits with un¬ usual joy, and'in her dark brilhanťeyes shone all the fire and enthusiasm* of 'her вой!. The present moment was a tri¬ umphant one. She had feared that since Paoli had evinced'strength of resolution to 1 seek:unity with'the hand·of another;
he would also cease to acknowledge the power which, up to such a period, had cemented them. Her wishes seemed to be approaching towards their attain¬ ment, and she hesitated not to turn them to the best advantage. " There is but one condition," she pronounced, detain¬ ing with a slight pressure the hand of Golfieri, <ς on which our future intimacy is dependant." , " Speak it, Rosalviva, and it is done !" " Stay, Paoli, this exclamation implies too much of wildness, and I may add weakness, to be admitted as the invio¬ lable sentiments of your heart." " Nay, believe me, Rosalviva, it is indeed sincerity ; hasten to put it to the trial." " I will," exclaimed the Comptessa, and a smile of the most expressive
meaning seemed to give her beautiful ь features an additional lustre. She bent her eyes attentively on those of Paoli, and, in accents of firmness, she uttered, ·— « and Golfieri will not repent of his promise ?" " He cannot, if Rosalviva still will love him." " Enough—in few words, Paoli, your wife Francesca must yield her rank to the claim of Rosalviva------ha! you he¬ sitate. I imagined how readily thy proofs would be given," tauntingly con¬ cluded the Comptessa. < " And how," apostrophised Paoli, heedless of the scornful remark. " is m *■' Francesca to be removed ?" " Canst thou propose no plan that *■ î , , will decidedly realise it?" insinuated the Comptessa. j
..A pause of spme,,.moments ensued, and she surveyed his varying change of countenance, .during its.sijence, with,per- fect calmpess. "¡Speak, I^aoli, ; does it require so, much, deliberation ?" , " Indeed 1 am ignorant of .,sqch power that can, for the present, „secure our hopes," expressed Golfieri, his heart encountering with, various acute,sensa¬ tions,, as to the purport of, Rosalviva'« designs. ; · '* What ! and c has thq angel form, of thy Francesca, so" warmed thy heart, that it ceases to pulsate,, unless jn, сошшо· nion/with her's?, Thou, Golfieri, of all mankind, tothe^.ignorant of the,„means which could reader, happiness lasting.

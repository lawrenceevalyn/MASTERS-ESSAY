In truth, I take no pams to study the agi emcns , but for respect to Ihe unfortunate lelalion- ship which subsists, I should scruple none in telling him his society is scarcely to be tolcialed, for of all the cross grained beings in the creation, 1 never met with one half so touchy, so tenacious, or so hard to please. Poor Madelma says little ; but I am sure she thinks a great deil God help her ' ahe has paid dearly for being a countess, not the dignity of a prin¬ cess could compensate the simlice.

Had Madehna been present, she too had heaid how she had been duped—how Glenmorris had been belied; but happily her feelings were spared for a season. She reached not the Manor till the power of disclosure was past— till the half bnathed reproach could form no combination Sir Owen died, mil I buried the secret in my oun bosom, but heivy wis the stilimle to issume even the outwird show of inteiest to lord Опшпдюп. I looi ed upon hım is in ìnteiloper, as ι deblroj er ol hippnuss, as in iinjiriiiii- pled hjpoinle sicrilieiiu all to sell ind (.eeking ¿rililieition m the annihil ttion ot
of all which ought lo have been sacred ¡ for I knew not that gold had corrupted the fidelity of dame Morris, and vested in his hands the written testimonies of undying faith Madelim, alarmed by persevenng sdenre, had been gradually brought to credit the plausible tale of Glenmorns's tieachery, until blinded by false appearances, her pride awakened, and her judgment misled, she sealed the fiat of irrevocable separation Unable to preserve the necessary curb of restraint, before our removal from the Manor, in the library of my buried fa¬ ther, I betrayed more than strict policy authorized The earl, little daunted, laughed at my reproaches and exulting in the success of his scheme, drew forth oneof the withheld letters Never shall I folget the agony of the moment, he seemed, as a fiend, ready to rend the heart ofher he had vowed to honour " You cinnot you dare not betriy me ' hc exclaimed, " Madelma s peace is
ıs my security Rosamond, if you hare humanity, withhold the explanation , it must produce misery, but it cannot recall the past ' Sobs checked all efiort to reply, the safety of my beloved sister was alone re¬ membered, and when I saw her enter the library—when I saw the letter hurled into the flames—when I saw her fly to recover the fatal confirmation of her misery, I could only throw myself be¬ fore her, cot Id only snatch away the burning fragments, and then I sank in¬ sensible to fear and to exertion. Well, notwithstanding all this agita¬ tion, my esteemed fnend, the real story was concealed, poor Madelma was cheat¬ ed into peace, ind my evident dejection and inquietude attributed to our recent loss We removed to Ormington Puk, and tliere I struggled with my ow ι feelings to cheer the pensi e spirits of my sister, and to palliate the increasing inattention of

may trace the genuine current of philan¬ thropy , that suavit) that gentleness of heart, which nature s original stimp de¬ signed for womin She wis veiy uneasy yesterday because I wis caught in a heivy shower of rain, and actuali) sent her two sons to seek me, ond to hasten my retuin, and when I reached my lntle parlour, I found the fire rekindled, and a change of clothes hung in prepiiation It seems my sorrows have interested" thisexcellent being, and ihough happv herself, she would alleviate and chear In what opposite moulds are female hearts cast ' Madelma's, ambitious, cruel, un¬ grateful, birbarous, Madehna s — her heart, which I so fondly pnzed, which I so dearly loved, on which I doted even to infatuation—her heart has no room for pity The world uould sneer at my pas¬ sion, they would st)le it romantic; they would cill me a mere visionary ; they would say 1 had studied the page of fiction
fiction until my own brain had become distempered. But Heaven can witness the faith, the purity, the fervour of that passion—Heaven, to which, in the an¬ guish ofmy feelings, I so often appeal— Heaven can vouch that all which consti¬ tutes grace, all which constitutes attrac¬ tion, all which ever lured the heart of man, combined, "ssayed, could not hav e effaced her image. I have wooed it—I have chenshed it with a reverence bor¬ denng on idolatry, with a fervour, which, sapping every sensation of my nature, has incorporated love with the vitality of my being I would have guarded hei from every ill—I would hive chenshed Iııı as the darling ofmy bosom, the trea¬ sure of my life , with her I would have smiled at the waywardness ol fortune, nor envied a prince the splendour of his lot Eden would hive dawned о л a mud-built hovel, and eveiy wish been concentialed in home. This is the picture—this was the pic¬ ture
lure which once fanned on to exertion, which lightened the pressure of despnr, which gave wings to hope. Could 1 have foreseen my doom, could I hive read the black colour of my destiny, Trance had been my prison and my gnve — Sometimes I think I will see her—some¬ times I think to upbraid her treachery would be to relieve mj own wretched¬ ness, jet if I should find her weary of the cursed bait, splendour —if I should find her drooping, sick at heart, my fool¬ ish fondness will redouble, .md—alas' my friend, do not spurn me formy weak¬ ness—if I should find her contented, hap¬ py, dazzled wilh elevation, attached to -the being who has decoyed her from me, I cannot answer for the maddening in¬ citements of despair Is it in nature to behold an envied, hated, happy rival, with calmness—even with endurance ? Is it m nature to breathe the same air with one who has desolated every prospect of happiness, who b-s poisoned

sophistry, to despise its false pernicious counsels, to dive beneath the shallow mask of its pretended friendships. Rosamond calls me a philosopher: I smile at her conception of things, even when my heart pines at the weighty pur¬ chase of its experience. To those vvho arc pleased with the study of the human character, who derive amusement from the versatility of men, this place is pecu¬ liarly adapted. Huddled together in one promiscuous throng, we.behold the gay, the youthful, ihe maimed, the halt, the hypneondriac, the valetudinarian, all seeking from the same salutary fount the same grand specific—health : we trace all the blandishments of beauty, and all the scientific skill of art, severally prac¬ tised ; vice triumphing o'er the guard of lionour, profligacy defying the dull rou¬ tine of custom, and luxury striding o'er moderation. The voice of Reason is drowned in the general clamour; birth claims precedence; merit yields to the trifling,
trifling, dissipated idiot of titled fime, and women devoid of shame, men devoid of honour, contend for the sway of fa¬ shion. How can we slart aghast at the corrup¬ tion of tte times ? how can we moralize on the depravity of the world, when to the high born sons of affluence we trace thepernicious defalcation—to Ihose who, like a beacon, ire set above the multi¬ tude, who oui»ht to strengthen by pre¬ cept, and correct by example > Oh, how I pine to return once more to my own peculnravocations, to Incepeace from its own pure souice—innocence and moderation, tody the witchery ofmodern refinement, to escape the dingers of modern scepticism ' Would to Heaven I could inspire themind ofOrmington wuh the same doubts, with the same scruples ' -—would to Heiven I could draw hini from a circle, who, watching each mo ment of indecision, twine round their sinking, their unresisting victims, to ruin —to
—to engulf them '— would to Heaven I eould regain that influence once so de¬ structive to his own principles, that un¬ bidden charm which drew him from the rank pursuits of licentiousness, which blinded my poor father to his native bent of character ' I would strive to while away the dull sameness of soli¬ tude ; I would woo the cheerful smile of gaiety , and though, as the author of the Sicilian Lover paihetically expresses it— Diy after diy, the cink nng «vorm reflect on, Feeds on the w iti ring fibres of ll e í eaw, «lıııl pais ι all its hopes ' Yet would I studiously court that sell- command, that beguiling calm which de¬ fies the search of scrutiny, which cheats e'en the piercing glance of affection Yes, lady Elizabeth, I would be conlent if Ormington derived his pleasures from home—I would loie the father of my cherub—
cherub —I would anticipate a calm close to my existence We have not yet rode to Clifton though strengthened by the strong m centivé of visning the Annendiles, my movements depend on others, unless sa¬ tisfied with the escort of my husband s assocntes, ind you know my estimition of fashionable friendships The duke of Albíny has oflered hisservices but he of all others is the being I would shun I dare not hint my motives, yet I bnve the im¬ putation of caprice, to escape the insi¬ nuating whispers of his passion Per¬ haps curiosity miy befriend me The earl, who has never yet visited Clifton, may find some leisure morning to gra¬ tify my wishes and Ins oxvn Adieu, my inestimable friend ' when í have seen Miss Annendale, and heard a true state¬ ment of poor Ellen, I will trouble you with a new proof of my penminship Madelina Ormington LETTER

In life, feeling is my bane, my curse, my torment ; day succeeds day, and the sting loses not its edge . I awake to reflection—I brood o'er my woes, and I am lost. For what can I live, but to deplore the prospects which treachery has faded into sadness—but to endure the pang of disappointed hope s I have no sweet incentive to wed mc to esist¬ ente, no quickening ray to calm the throbbmgs of my aching bosom—no watchful, sjmpathetic eve to cool my lev ensh

The blow of separation cannot be re¬ acted, the annihilation of hope cannot be refelt I shall remain here for a few days, and then my heait points to the scene, of my youth But I knov not whethei I dare tiust myself with the inatilgence ; I feel as a minderer on the earth, without one settled home, without one spot to rest on. Yet, Chester, I would fain visit the grave of my mother ; I would kneel on the lone marble before I agim become an alien from my native land It will be the last gratification, the last mournful adieu : I feel that assurance within, that prophetic inspiration, which whispers misfortune and sorrow will ere long com¬ plete their work. England may recede, but will never again gladden my expec¬ tant ejes Write to me, Chester suirounded by strangers, remember I wait but the arri¬ val of your letter. Let me hear that Madehna— О

that man, born to be our support, ought ever to be looked up to with respect and security. " If man is indeed born io be our sup- port," I observed, " he often most sadly perverts the ordination." " Certainly," sud Madehna ; " man sii ays from the straight track of right, and wanders in the crooked, the thorn-en- c.-..sted paths of evil. Sometimes a be- tía) er, he perverts the principles of edu¬ cation, and turns the weakness of credu¬ lity to his own puipose." " How, then," I eagerly questioned, *' can we look up to hun with respect and security ?" Midelma breathed a heai y sigh. " It is ι irtue," she ι eplied, " winch alone de¬ mands that tribute—vntue which ensures tne homage of lhe heart, and awards ever the just claim of commendaiion."

is much ehanged ; even I, who see her hourly, perceive the alteration ; so thin, and so pale, yet not one complaint es¬ capes. Sure never did human being la¬ bour so hard to appear happy ; she would fain screen her heavy load of care from the whole world, and mock the narrow watchful eye of affection with the sem¬ blance of cheerfulness. Hers is a gloomy pilgrimage, a long, long storm, without one ray of sunshine. I often think Hea¬ ven must chasten those it loves ; for vir¬ tue like hers is not of earthly mould.

I cannot counterfeit a regret I do not feel—I cannot grieve for the loss of the earl : the mode of his death I lament ; but even under the pressure of real af¬ fliction, we are told that the indulgence of inordinate grief is an offence against Heaven, that the natural effusions of our feelings must be tempered and restrained. I would pray for the forgiveness of all his misdeeds—1 have wept at the untime¬ ly close of his existence ; how then can »ere humanity be further taxed ?

To paint grief at the decease of the earl of Ormington, to swell my volume by lamentation and woe, to insert letters of resignation and acquiescence, or to vio¬ late nature by the mock heroics of pre¬ tended despair would at once be entail¬ ing the charge of affectation on mv I e- roine, and heaping inconsistencv on the produce of mv own pen Be it then suf¬ ficient to observe, that the countess of Ormington, accompanied by her child, and attended by her sister, shi unk from the

Duty no longer proscnbed the thoughts, no longer froze the wishes The papers of the day teemed with the heroes of Spam, and imagination oft re¬ in 4 called

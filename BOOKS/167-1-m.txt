ZASTROZZI, A ROMANCE,
CHAPTER I. T-ORN 1 from the society of all he held dear on earth, the, victim of secret ene* mies, and exiled from happiness, was the wretched Verezzi! AH was quiet; a pitchy darkness in volved the face of things, when* urircd by fiercest revenge, Zastrozzi placed himself at the door of the inn where, undisturbed, Verezzi slept. Loudly fe<f'cafled the landlord. The Iandlord/to>R4n, the bare »*tne of Za«- itiWimBiii gii i mV ii h g ii i ii fl titTh^^ ...... «—*

" Let Ugo and Bernardo follow you to his apartment j I will be with you to prevent mischief/ 1 Cautiously they ascended—success¬ fully they executed their revengeful pur¬ pose, and bore the sleeping Verezzi to rhe place, where a chariot waited to convey the vindictive 2astrozzi's prey to the place of its destination. Ugo and Bernardo lifted the still sleep* ing Verezzi into the chariot. Rapidly they travelled onwards fur several hours. Verezzi was still wrapped in deep sleep, from which all the movements he had
him, Zastro&zi and Ugo were masked, as was Bernardo^ wito acted as postilion. It was still dark* when they stopped at a small inn, on a remote and desolate heath,; and waiting but to change horse% again advanced. At last day appeared —still the slumbers of Verezzi remained unbroken, .Ugo fearfully questioned JZastrozzi.as to the cause of his extraordinary sleep, Zastrozzij who ? however, was well ac¬ quainted with it, gloomily answered, ** I know not' 1 Swiftly they travelled during the whole of the day, over which nature seemed to have drawn her most gloomy curtain* —They stopped occasionally at inns to change horses and obtain refreshments, B 2
Night came on~they forsook the beaten tracks and, entering an immense forest, made their way slowly through the rugged underwood At last they stopped—they lifted their victim from the chariot, and bore him to a cavern, which yawned in a dell close by» Not long did the hapless victim of un* merited persecution, enjoy an oblivion which deprived him of a knowledge of Ids horrible situation. He awoke—and overcome by excess of terror, started vio¬ lently from the ruffians' arms* Th^y had now entered the cavern - Verezzi supported himself against a frag¬ ment of rock which jutted out. 44 Resistance is useless," exclaimed Zastrozzi; " following us in submissive silence can alone procure the slightest mitigation of your punishment."
Verezzi followed as fast a$ his frame, weakened by unnatural sleep, and en- foebled hy recent illurss, would permit; ycc, scarcely believing that he was awake, and not thoroughly convinced of the reality of the hcene before him, he viewed every thing with that kind of in* explicable horror, which a terrible dream h wont to excite. After winding down the rugged de¬ scent for some time, they arrived at an iron door, which at first sight appeared to be part of the rock itself Every thing had till now been obscured by total dark* ness i and Verezzi, for the first time, saw the masked faces of his persecutors* which a torch brought by Bernardo ren¬ dered visible* The massy door flew open* The torches from without rendered the darkness which reigned within still more horrible; aud Verezzi beheld the interior
never again about to emerge—-an his grave* Again he struggled with his per¬ secutors, but his enfeebled frame was in¬ sufficient to support a conflict with the strong*nerved Ugo, and, subdued, he sank fainting Into his arms. llh triumphant persecutor bore him into the damp cell^ and chahied him to the wall. An iron chain encircled his waist 5 his limbs, which not even a little straw kept from the rock, were fixed by immense staples to the flinty floor * and but one of his hands wis left at liberty, to lake tbe scanty pittance of bread and water which wm daily allowed him. Every thing was denied him but thought> which, by comparing the pre¬ sent with the past, was his greatest tor* ment. Ugo entered the cell every morning and evening, to bring coarse bread, and
a pitcher of water, seldom, yet sometimes, accompanied by Zastrozzh In vain did he implore mercy, pity, md even death : useless were all his a»- quiries concerning the cause of hh bar¬ barous imprisonment—a stem silence was maintained by his relentless gaoler. Languishing in painful captivity, Vo* rezzi passed days and nights seemingly countless, in the same monotonous uni¬ formity of horror and despair, He scarcelv now shuddered when the show lizard crossed his naked and motionless limbs. The large earth-worms, which twined themselves in his long and matted hair, almost ceased to excite sensations of horror. Days ana nights were undistinguishable from each other; and the period which he had passed there, though in reality but a few weeks, wm lengthened bv his perturbed imagination into many years.
Sometimes he scarcely supposed that his torments were earthly, but that Ugo* whose countenance bespoke him a de¬ mon, was the fury who blasted his re¬ viving hopes His mysterious removal from tlie inn near Munich also confused his ideas, and he never could bring his thoughts to any conclusion on the sub¬ ject which occupied them* One evening, overcome by long watch¬ ing, he sank to sleep, for almost the first time since his confinement, when he was aroused by a loud crash, which seemed to burst over the ravern. Attentively he listened—he even hoped, tnougii hope was almost dead within his breast, Again he listened—again the same noise was repeated—it was but a violent thunder¬ storm which shook the elements above. Convinced of the folly of hope, he ad¬ dressed a prayer to his Creator—to Him who hears a suppliant from the bowels of the earth* His thoughts were elevated
above terrestrial enjoyments—his suffer* ings sank into nothing on the compari¬ son. Whilst his thoughts were thus em¬ ployed, a more violent crash shook the cavern. A scintillating flame darted from the cieling to the floor. Almost at the same mstant the roof fell in. A large fragment of the rock was laid athwart the cavern; one end being grooved into the solid wall, the other having almost forced open the massy iron door. Verezzi was chained to a piece of rock which remained immoveable. The vio¬ lence of the storm was past, but the hail descended rapidly, each stone of which wounded his naked limbs. Every flash of lightning, although now distant, daz¬ zled his eyes, unaccustomed as they had been to the least ray of light B 5
The storm at last ceased, the pealing thunders died away in indistinct murmurs, aud the lightning was too faint to lie vi* sible. Day appeared—no one had yet been to the eavenoH-Vereazi concluded that they either intended him to perish with hunger, or that some misfortune, by wliich they themselves had suffered, had occurred* In the most solemn man¬ ner, therefore, he now prepared himself far dealfa, which he was fully convinced within himself was rapidly approach¬ ing. His pitcher of water was broken by the falling fragments, and a small crust of bread was all that now remained of his scanty allowance of provisions* A burning fever raged through hh veins s and, delirious with despairing ill* ne$$, he cast from him the crust which done could now retard the rapid ad¬ vances of death*
forts of disease and suffering make on the manly and handsome figure of Verezzi-! His bones had almost started though his skin 5 his eyes were sunken and hollow ^ and his hair, matted with the damps, hung in strings upon his faded cheek. The day passed as had the morning- death was every instant before his ey«s— a lingering death by famine—he felt its approaches: night came, but with it brought.no change* He was aroused by a noise against the iron door: it was the time when Ugo usually brought fresh pro¬ visions. The noise lessened, at last it to¬ tally ceased—with it ceased all hope of life in Verezzi's bosom. A cold tremor pervaded hb limbs—his eyes but faintly presented to his imagination the ruined cavern—he sank, as far as the chain which encircled his waist would permit him, upon the flinty pavement; and, in the crisis of the fever which then oc¬ curred, his youth and good constitution prevailed.
CHAPTER II In the meantime Ugo,who had received orders from Zastro^i not to allow Ve- rezzi to die, came at the accustomed hour to bring provisions, but finding that, in the last night f s storm, the rock had been struck by lightning, concluded that Ve~ rezsi had lost his life amid the ruins, and he went with this news to Zastrozzi.— 55astro£2i, who, for inexplicable reasons, wished not Verezzi's death, sent Ugo md Bernardo to search for him. After a long scrutiny, they discovered their hapless victim* He w r as chained *o the rock where they had left him, but in that exhausted condition, which want of food, and a violent fever, had reduced him to.
They unchained him, %ind lifting htm into a chariot, after four honrs rapid tra¬ velling, brought the insensible Veirazt to a cottage, inhabited bv an old woman alone. The cottage stc^d on an immense heath, lonely, desolate, and remote from other human habitation. Zastrozzi awaited their arrival with impatience: eagerly he flew to meet them, and, with a demoniac smile, sur¬ veyed the agonised features of hk prey, who lay insensible and stretched on the shoulders of Ugo* 44 His life must not be lost," exclaimed Zastrozzi % 44 I have need of it Tell Bianca, therefore, to prepare a bed/* Ugo obeyed* and Bernardo followed, bearing the emaciated Verezzi. A phy¬ sician was sent for, who declared, that the crisis of the fever which had attacked him being past, proper care might rein* state him: but that the disorder having
was absolutely necessary for his reco~ very, Zastro&ssi, to whom the life, though not the happiness of Vere^i was requi¬ site, saw that hk too eager desire for revenge had carried him beyond his point. He saw that some deception was requisite * he accordingly instructed the old woman to inform htm, when he re¬ covered, that he was placed in this situa¬ tion, because the physicians had asserted that tbe air of this country wa& necessary for a recovery from a brain fever which had attacked him, It wm long before Vere^i recovered —long did he languish in torpid insensi¬ bility, during which his soul seemed to have winged its way to happier regions. At last, however, he recovered, and the first use he made of hk genaes was to inquire where he was*
The old woman told him the story, which she had been instructed iu by Z»s* Uozzu 44 Who ordered me then to be chained In that desolate and dark cavern/ in¬ quired Verejaati, 44 where I have been for many years, and suffered most insupport* able torments ?" 44 Lord bless me !" said the old woman: " why, baron, how strangely you talk! I begin to fear you will again lose your senses, at the very time when you ought to be thanking God for suflering them to return to you. What can you mean by being chained in a cavern ? I declare I am frightened at the very thought: pray do compose yourself** Verezzi was much perplexed by the oH woman's assertions. That Julia should send him to a mean cottage, and desert him, was impossible*
The old woman's relation seemed so well connected, and told with such an air of characteristic simplicity, that he could not disbelieve her* But to doubt Uio.evidence of his own , senses, and the strong proofs of his im- prkonment, which the deep marks of the chains had left till now, was impossible. ; Had not those marks still remained, he would have conceived the horrible events v^hi^h had led him thither to have been but the dreams of his perturbed imagina¬ tion^ ^ He, however, thought it better to yield, since, as Ugo and Bernardo at¬ tended him m the short walks he was able to take, an escape was impossible, and its attempt would but make his situ¬ ation more unpleasant, He often expressed a wish to write to Julia* but the old woman said she had orders neither to permit him to write nor
tating his mind; and to avoid the conse« quences of despair, knives were denied him. As Vereezi recovered, and his mind obtained that firm tone which it was wont to possess, he psrcoivcd Umt U was but a device of his enemies that detained him at the cottage, and his whole thoughts were now bent upon the means for effect¬ ing his escape, It was late one evening, when, tempted by the peculiar beauty of the weather, Verezzi wandered beyond the usual li¬ mits, attended by Ugo and Bernardo, who narrowly watched his every move* ment Immersed in thought, he wan¬ dered onwards, till he came to a woody eminence, whose beauty tempted him to rest a little, in a seat carved in the side of an ancient oak. Forgetful of his un* happy and dependent situation, he sat
it was time to return. In their absence, Zastrozzi had arrived at the cottage. He had impatiently en- qwwtM for Verea&i, ** 11 is ine b»i vn'o owstom tn ^ralfe every «vwiBg, w said Bfenca 5 44 1 soon expect him to-*etitm«* /Vereaai at last arrived.

with an e^presaion too manifest to be misunderstood % and with an air in wlich he struggled to dteguise the natural male¬ volence of his heart, he said, that he hoped Vere&#i*s health had not suffered from the evening &u, Enraged beyond measure at this hypo* erisy, from a man whom he now no longer doubted to be the cause of all his misfor* tunes, he could not forbear inquiring for what purpose he had conveyed him hither, and told him instantly to refeate him, Zastronft eheeka turned pale with passion, his lips quivered, his eyes darted revengeful glances, as thus he spoke:— 44 Retire to your chamber, young fool, which is the fittest place for you to re* fleet on, and repent of, the insolence, shown to one so much your superior,**

CHAPTER HI. ZvsTRGZZf and Ugo proceeded along the heath, on the skirts of which stood the cottage. VereH£i leaned against the casement, when a low voice, which floated in indistinct murmurs on the si* lence of the evening, reached his ear.— He listened attentively. He looked into the darkness, and saw the towering form of Zastrozzi, and Ugo, whose awkward, ruffian-like gait, could never be nJ«* taken* He could not hear their discourse, except a few detached wonts which reached his ears* They seemed to be denunciations of anger; alow tone af¬ terwards succeeded, and it appeared as if a dispute, which had arisen between them, was settled: their voices at last died away in distance.
Bernnnlo now left the room; Bixnca eutcred; but Vere^i plainly heard Ber* nardo lingering at the door. The old woman continued statin? in silence at a remote comer of the cham¬ ber. It was Verezzl's hour for supper: *—he desired Biaoca to bring it. She obeyed, and brought some dried raisins in a plate* He was surprised to $ee a knife was likewise brought; an induh geuce he imputed to the inadvertency of the old woman.-—A thought started across hk mind—it was now time to escape* He seized the knife—he looked expres¬ sively at the old woman—she trembled. He advanced from the casement to the door: he called for Bernardo—Bernardo entered, and Vereaszi, lifting his arm high, aimed the knife at the villain's heart.— Bernardo started aside, and the knife was fixed firmly in the doorcase, Verexzt attempted by one effort to extricate it.
her tottering limbs could carry her, hast¬ ened through the opposite door, calling loudly for Zastro^^i. Verezzi attempted to rush through the open door, but Bernardo opposed him¬ self to it. A long and violent contest en¬ sued, and Bernardo^ superior strength was on the point of overcoming Vere&&i, when tiie latter, by a dexterous blow, precipitated him down the steep and nar¬ row staircase. Not waiting to see the event of his victory, he rushed through the opposite door, and meeting with no opposition, ran swiftly across the heath* The moon, in tranquil majesty, hung high in air, and showed the immense ex¬ tent of the plain before him. He con¬ tinued rapidly advancing, and the cot* tage was soon out of sight, He thought
that he heard Zastro^i*$ voice in eveiy gale. Turning round, he thought Zas- tro^i's eye glanced over his shoulder, —But even had Bianca taken the right road, and found Za&trogzi, Yerezzi\ speed would have mocked pursuit. He ran several miles, still the dreary extent of the heath was before him: no cottage yet appeared where he might take shelter* He cast himself, for an in¬ stant, on the bank of a rivulet, which stole slowly across the heath. The moon¬ beam played upon its surface—he started at his own reflected image—he thought that voices were wafted on the western gale, and, nerved anew, pursued his course across the plain. The moon had gained thfe zenith be¬ fore Verex2i rested again. Two pine trees, of extraordinary stee, stood on a small eminence: he climbed one, and found a convenient seat in its itrmensi* branches,
Fatigued, he sank to sleep. Two hours he lay hushed in oblivion, when he was awakened bv a noise* It is but the hooting of the Bight-raven, thought he. Day had not yet appeared, but faint streaks in the east presaged the coming mora. Verezzi heard the clattering of hoofs—What was his horror to see that Zastrozzi, Bernardo, and Ugo, were the horsemen! Overcome by terror, he clone to the rugged branch* His persecutors advanced to the spot—they stopped un* der the tree wherein he was, " Eternal curses, 11 exclaimed Zas¬ trozzi, " upon Verezzi!- I swear never to rest until I find him, and then I will accomplish the purpose of my soul— But come, Ugo, Bernardo, let us pro¬ ceed*** %t Signor,*' said Ugo, «let us the rather
c
stop here to refresh ourselves and our horses. You, perhaps, will not make tliis pine your couch, but I will get up, for I tliink I spy an excellent bed above there,'* 44 No, no, 1 ' answered Zastro&£i $ iS did not I resolve never to rest until I had tbund Vereawsi ? Mount, villain, or die*" Ugo sullenly obeyed. They galloped oft^ and were quickly out of sight* Vere&sri returned thanks to Heaven for his escape; for he thought that Ugo's eye, as the villain pointed to tlie branch where he reposed, met his. It was now morning. Verezzi sur¬ veyed the heath, and thought he saw buildings at a-distance. Could he gain a town or city, he might defy Zastrozzt's power* He descended the pine-tree, and ad-
vanced m quickly as he could towards the distant buildings* He proceeded across the heath for half an hour, and perceived that* at last, he had arrived ai its termination* The country assumed a new aspect, nnd the number of cottages and villas showed him that he wm in the neigh- bourbood of some city. A large road which he now entered confirmed his opi¬ nion. He saw two peasants, and asked them where the road led.—" To Passau/' was the answer* It was yet very early in the morning, when he walked through the principal street of Passau, He felt very faint with his recent and unusual exertions; and, overcome by languor, sank on some lofty stone steps* which led to a magnificent mansion, and resting his head on his arm, soon fell asleep, He had been there* nearly an hour, c s
when he was awakened by an old %vo- man* She had a basket on her arm, in which were flowers, which it was her custom to bring to Passau every market- day, Hardly knowing where he was, he answered the old woman's inquiries in a vague and unsatisfactory manner* By degrees, however, they became better ac¬ quainted ; and as Verezzi had uo money, nor any means of procuring it, he ac* cepted of an oiler which Claudine {for that was the old woman's name) made him, to work for her, and share her cottage, which, together witha little garden, nasall she could call her own, Claudine quickly disposed of her flowers, and accoinpauicd by Verezzi, soon arrived at a little cot¬ tage near Passau. It was situated ou a pleasant and cultivated spot; at the foot of a small eminence, on which it was si tuated," flowed the majestic Danube, and on,the opposite side was a forest belong- iu<* to the Baron of Schwepper, whose vassal Claudine was,
Her little cottage was kept extremely neat; and, hy the charity of thc Baron, wanted none of those little comforts which old age requires, Verezzi thought that, in so retired a spot, he might at least pass his time tran¬ quilly, and elude Zastrozzi* " What induced you," said he to Clan* dine, as in the evening they sat before the cottage-door, " what induced you to make that offer this morning to me?" 44 Ah V* said the old woman, ** it was but last week that I lost my dear son, who was every thing to me: he died by a fever which he caught by his too great exertions in obtaining a livelihood for me i and I came to the market yesterday, for the first time since my son's death, hoping to find some peasant who would fill his place, when chance threw you ia my way.
H 1 had hoped that he would have out¬ lived me, as 1 am quickly hastening to the grave, to which 1 look forward as to the coming of a friend, who would relieve me from those cares which, alas I but in¬ crease with iny years/* Verezai*s heart was touched with com* passion for the forlorn situation of Qau* dine. He tenderly told her that he would not forsake her j but if any opportunity occurred for ameliorating her situation, $he should no longer continue in poverty;
CHAPTER IV. BUT let us return to 5£a$tro&&h~He had walked with Ugo on the heath, and had returned late, He was surprised to sea no light in the cottage. He advanced to the dooi^—he rapped violently— no one answered* *« Very strange 1" exclaimed Zastroa&i, as he burst open the door with his foot. He entered the cottage—no one was there: he searched it, and at last saw Bernardo lying, seemingly lifeless, at the foot of the staircase. Zastro22i advanced to him, and lifted him from the ground: he had been but in a trance, and immediately recovered. As soon as his astonishment was dissi*
pened. 44 What r exclaimed Zastro^^i„, inter¬ rupting him, **Verezat escaped! Hell and furies! Villain^ you deserve instant death % hut thy life is at present neces* sary to nw. Arise, go instantly to Ho* senheim* and bring three of my horses from the inn there—make haste! he- gene P Bernardo trembling arose* and obey¬ ing Z®$tmzm*B commands, crossed the heath, quickly towards Rosenheim, a vil¬ lage %b&®t half a league distant on the north* Whilst he was gone, Zastroaf&i, agi¬ tated by contending passions, knew scarcely what to do* With hurried strides he paced the cottage. He sometimes gpoke lowly to himself The feelings of his somI flashed from his eyes—his frown Aim* terrible*
my dagger, Signor T said Ugo. €i Kill him when you catch him, which you soon will, I am sure/* " Ugo/ J said Zastrozzi, 44 yon are my friend; you advise me well.—But, no! he must not die.~~Ah! hy what horrible fetters am I chained—fool that I waa— Ugo 1 he shall die—die by the most hell* ish torments* I give myself up to fates —I will taste revenge j for revenge is sweeter than life: and even were I to die with him, and, as the punishment of my crime, be instantly plunged into eternal torments, I should taste superior joy in recollecting the sweet moment of his de¬ struction* O! would that destruction could be eternal V* The clattering of hoofs was heard, and Zastrozzi was now interrupted by the ar~ rival of Bernardo—they instantly mount¬ ed, and the high-spirited steeds bom them swiftly across the heath*
Kapidly, for somt* time, were Zas« trazzi and his companions borne across the plain, They took the same road as Verezzi had. They pawd the pines where he reposed, They hurried on. The fainting horses were scarce able to hear iimk guilty burthens. No one had $pokm since th$y had left the eius* tared pi«s« Bernardo's horse, overcome by exces¬ sive fatigue, sank on the ground £ that of ^SJastro&zi scarce appeared in better con* dition.~They stopped. ** What!" exclaimed Zaatrozjsi, ^musfc we give up the search 1 Ah I I am afraid we mmi;. our horses can proceed no far¬ ther—curse on fhe horses. ■ u But let us proceed on foot—Vemm shiili not escape me—nothing shedi now retaed the completion of my jml revenge/'
As he thus spoke* ZfaAttoi&ih eye gleamed with impatient revenge; and ? with rapid *teps» he advanced towards the south of the heath. Day4ight at length appeared; still were the villain's- efforts to find Verezzi inefficient. Hunger, thirst, ttd fatigue* conspired to make them relinquish the pursuit—they lay at intervals upon the stony soil, " This is but an uncomfortable couch, •Signor," muttered Ugo. Za^tro^U whose whole thoughts were centred in revenge^ heeded him not* hut nerved anew by impatient vengeance* he started from the bosom of the earth, and muttering curses tipon the innocent object of his hatred, proceeded onwards.

The sun began to decline ^ at last it sank beneath the western mountain, and the forest-tops were tinged by its depart¬ ing ray. The shades of night rapidly thickened* Zastrozzi sat awhile upon the decayed trunk of a scathed oak. The sky was serene $ the blue ether was spangled with countless myriads of stars: the tops of the lofty ferost4ree$ waved mournfully in the evening wind 5 and the moon-beam penetrating at inter* vals, as they mov€d, through the matted branches, threw dubious shades upon the dark underwood beneath.

Her bosom was scorched by an ardent .and unquenchable fire $ and while she t|iapght of him, she even shuddered at the infcenseness of her own sensations* 44 M& shall love me~he shall be mine —mine for ever," mentally ejaculated Ma¬ tilda*
The streets of Passau echoed to La Contessa di Laurentinrs equipage, be¬ fore, roused from her reverie, she found herself at the place of destination $ and she was seated in her hotel in that city, before she had well arranged her unsettled ideas. She summoned Ferdinand, a trusty servant, to whom she confided every thing,— 4 * Ferdinand," said she, c * yon have many claims on my gratitude: I have never had cause to reproach you with infidelity in executing my purposes —add another debt to that which I al* ready owe yon: find Ii Conte Verezzi within three days, and you are my best friend." Ferdinand bowed, and prepared to execute her commands, Two days passed, during which Matilda failed not to make every personal inquiry, even in the suburbs of Passau. Alternately depressed by fear, and re* vived by hope, for three days was Ma- tilda*s mind in a state of disturbance and
%, of the day on which Ferdinand wm to reinrn, arrived. Matilda's mind, wound up to the extreme of impatience, was the scene of conflicting passions,—She paced A servant entered, and announced supper* 44 Is Ferdinand relumed F* hastily in* quired Matilda* The domestic answered in the nega* live*-—She sighed deeply, and struck her forehead* Footsteps wev^ heard in the anticham-* ber without, 4i There is Ferdinand 1" exclaimed Ma¬ tilda, exultingly, as he entered—" Well, well! have you found Verezzi? Ah! speak quickly ! ease me of this iiorrible btt$pens&"
%l^
44 Signora ("said Ferdinand,« it grieves me much to be obliged to declare, that all my endeavours have been inefficient to find II Conte Verezzi—." * 4 Oh,madness ! madness!" exclaimed Matilda ; 4< is it for this that I have plunged into the dark abyss of crime ?~— is it for this thai I have despised the deli¬ cacy of my sex* and, braving consequent ces, have offered my love to one who de¬ spises me—who shuns me, as does the bar¬ barous Verezzi ? But if he is in Passau —if he is in the environs of the city, I will find him." Thus saying, despising the remon¬ strances of her domestics, casting off all sense of decorum, she rushed into the streets of Passau. A gloomy silence reigned through the streets of the city; it was past midnight, and every inhabitant seemed to be sunk in sleep—sleep which Matilda was almost a stranger to. Her white robes floated on the night air—her
shadowy and dishevelled hair flew over Ikr form, which, m she passed the bridge, meme4 to strike the boatmen below with the idea of some supernatural and ethereal form* She hastily crossed the bridge^—she en¬ tered ihe fields on the right—the Da- nuke*? whose ptfceut strati was scarcely agitated by the wind, reflected her sym- metrieati form> a*, sefreeiy knowing what direction Ae pursued, Matilda hastened $kmg its banks* Sudden horror, resist* fess despair, seized her bra4a, maddened as it was by hopeless love* 44 Whm hme I to <"o in this world, itey Mmm prospect ^ghted, my fondest hope rendered futile r exclaimed the fran« tic HfatHdfe* as, wound up to the highest piieh of desperatbi^, she attempted to jriitfKge hei^etf into the river- hut life led; for Matilda, caught by
desperate act Overcome by horror, she fainted* Some time did she lie in a state ©f tor¬ pid insensibility, till the stranger, filling his cap with water from the river, and sprinkling her pallid countenance with it, recalled to life the miserable Matilda. What was her surprise, what was ter mingled emotion of rapture and doubt, when the raoon~beam disclosed to her view the countenance of Veres&i, as in anxious solicitude he bent over her ele- gantly^proportioned form! " By what chance,** exclaimed the sur* prised VereK&i, " da I see here La Con* tessadi Laurcntini? did not I leave yon at your Italian castella ? I had hoped you would have ceased to persecute me, when 1 told you that I was irrevocably an- other's/ 1 I) 5
44 Oh, Verezzi P exclaimed Matilda, easting herself at his feet, ** 1 adore you to madness—I love you to distraction* If you have one spark of compassion, let me not sue in vain—reject not one who feels it impossible to overcome the fatal, resistless passion which consumes her/* 44 Rise, Signora, H returned Verezzi— * c rise j tliis discourse is improper—it is not suiting the dignity of your rank, or the delicacy of your sex: but suffer me to conduct you to yon cottage, where, perhaps* you may deign to refresh your¬ self, or pass the night*" The moon-beams played upon the tranquil waters of the Danube, as Verezzi silently conducted the beautiful Matilda to the humble dwelling where he re¬ sided. Claudme waited at the door, and had begun to fear that some mischance had befallen Verezzi, as, when he arrived at
the cottage-door, it was long past his usual hour of return. It was his custom, during those hours when the twilight of evening cools the air, to wander through the adjacent rich scenery, though he seldom prolonged his walks till midnight, Ho supported the fainting form of Ma¬ tilda as he advanced towards Cltodtne. The old woman's eyes had lately u*iled her, from extreme agej and it was not until Verezzi called to her that she saw him, accompanied by La Contessa di Laurentini, 44 Claudine, 1 * said Vere^i, *' I have another claim upon your kindness: this lady, who has wandered beyond her knowledge, will honour our cottage so far as to pass the night here. If you would prepare the pallet which I usually oc¬ cupy for her, I will repose this evening on the turf, and will now get supper ready.
Signora,** continued he, addressing Ma* tilda, <* some wine would, I think, refresh your spirits 5 permit me to fill you a glass of wine/* Matilda silently accepted his offer— thfeir eyes met—those of Matilda were sparkling and full of meaning* ** Verezgii" exclaimed Matilda, «* I arrived but four days since at Passau— I have eagerly inquired for you—oh ! how eagerly!—Will you accompany me to-morrow to Passau ?" " Yes," said Verezzi, hesitatingly, Claudine soon joined them. Matilda exulted in the success of her schemes, and Claudine being present, the conver¬ sation took a general turn. The lateness of the hour, at last, warned them to se¬ parate* Vere»i, Mt to solitude and his own
reflectiom, threw him^lf oa the turf, which extended to the Danube beiowv— Ideas of the most gloomy nature took possession of his soul i and> in the event of the evening, he saw the foundation of the most bitter misfortunes* He could not love Matilda; and though he never had seen her but in the most amiable light, he found it impossible to feel uny sentiment towards her, save cold esteem. Never had he beheld those dark shades in her character, which, if deve~ loped, could excite nothing but horror and detestation: he regarded her as a woman of strong passions, who, having re¬ sisted them to the utmost of her power, was at last borne away in the current— whose brilliant virtues one fault had ob¬ scured—as such lie pitied her : but still could he not help observing a compari¬ son between her and Julia, whose femi¬ nine delicacy shrunk from the Mightest suspicion, even of indecorum. Her fra¬ gile form, her mild heavenly counte-
nance, was contrasted with all the par* tialifcy of love, to the scintillating eye, the commanding countenance, the bold ex¬ pressive gasse* of Matilda* He must accompany her on the mor¬ row to Passau.™During their walk, he determined to observe a strict silence; or, at all events, not to hazard one equivocal expression, which might be construed into what it was not meant for* The night p&s$ed away—morning came > and the tops of the far-seen mountains were gilded by the rising mn. Exulting in the success of her schemes, and scarcely able to disguise the vivid feehngs of her heart, the wily Matilda, as early she descended to the narrow par¬ lour, where Claudine had prepared a $im- pie breakfast, affected a gloom she was far from feeling. An unequivocal expression of innocent
and mild tenderness marked her manner towards Verezzi; her eyes were cast on the ground, aud her every movement spoke meekness and sensibility. At last, breakfast being finished, the time arrived when Matilda* accompanied by Vere&gi, pursued the course of the river, to retrace her footsteps to Passau, A gloomy silence for some time prevailed —at last Matilda spoke, ** Unkind Vere&$i! is it thus that you will ever slight me? is it for this that I have laid aside the delicacy of n>y sex, and owned to yon a passion which was but too violent to be concealed ?—Ahi at least pity rne! I love yon: oh ! I adore you to madness ! M She paused—the peculiar expression which beamed in her dark eye, told the tumultuous wishes of her bosom. *' Distress not yourself and me, Si-
gnom, s> said Vere^rf, <* by thes^ unavail« ing protestations* 1$ it for you—is it for Matilda," continued he, his countenance assuming a smile of bitterest scorn, «* to talk of love to the lover of Julia ?" Rapid tears coursed down Matilda's cheek* She sighed~the $igh seemed to rood her inmost bosom. So unexpected a reply conquered Ve- re^^i. He had been prepared for re¬ proaches, but his feelings could not with¬ stand Matilda's tears, '* Ah! forgive me, Signora," exclaimed Verezai, 4i if my brain, craved hy disap¬ pointments, dictated words which my heart intended not/* 44 Oh V f replied Matilda, « it is I who am wrong: led on by the violence of my passion, I have uttered words, the bare recollection of which fills me with horror* Oh! forgive, forgive an unhappy wo-
man, whose only fault is loving you too well." As thus she spoke, they entered the crowded streets of Passau, aud, proceed- ing rapidly ouwards, soon arrived at La Contessa di Laurentini s hotel
CHAPTER VI THE character of Matilda has been al* ready so fer revealed, as to render it mi- necessary to expatiate upon it farther* Suffice it to say, that her syren illusions, and welbtimed blandishments, obtained so great a power over the imagination of Verezzi, that his resolution to return to Cl&udine's cottage be/ore sun-set became cverv instant fainter and fainter* u And will you thus leave me ? M ex* claimed Matilda, in accents of the bit* terest anguish, as Verezzi prepared to de* part—** will you thus leave unnoticed, her who, for your sake alone, casting aside the pride of high birth, has wan¬ dered, unknown, through foreign climes i
Oh! if I have (led away hy love for you) outstepped the bounds of modesty, let me not, oh! Jet me not be injured by others with impunity* Stay, I entreat thee, Verezzi, if yet one spark of compassion lingers in your breast—stay and defend me from those who vainly seek one who is irrevocably thine/ 5 With words such as these did the wily Matilda work upon the generous passions of Verezzi. Emotions of pity, of com¬ passion, for one whose only fault he sup¬ posed to be iove for him, conquered Ve* rezzi's softened soul. w Oh! Matilda/' said he, '* though I cannot love thee—though my soul is irre¬ vocably another's—yet, believe me, I esteem, I admire thee j and it grieves me that a heart, fraught with so many and so brilliant virtues, has fixed itself on one who is incapable of appreciating its value.

The most select parties in Piassan> fiit* ted in varied movenjents to exquisite harmony, when Matilda perceived Ve- re^i*s spirits to be ruffled hy recollee* tion* When he seemed to prefer solitude, a moonlight walk hy the Danube was pro¬ posed by Matilda^ or, with skilful fingers, she drew from her harp sounds of the most heart-touching, most enchanting melody. Her behaviour towards him was soft, tender, and quiet, and might rather have characterised the mild, serene love of a friend or shier^ than the ardent, un* quenchable fire, which burnt, though concealed, within Matilda's bosom, It was one calm evening that Matilda and Verezzi sat in a back saloon, which overlooked the gliding Danube, Verem
was listening, with ah the enthusiasm of silent rapture, to a favourite soft air which Matilda sang, when a loud rap at the hall door startled them, A domestic entered, and told Matilda that a stranger, on par* ticnlar business, waited to speak with ner* 44 Oh!" exclaimed Matilda, « I can¬ not attend to him now * bid him wait/* The stranger was impatient, and would not be denied. 44 Desire him to come in, then," said Matilda. The domestic hastened to obey her commands. Verezzi had arisen to leave the room, -" No," cried Matilda, 4f sit still | I shall mm dismiss th^ fellow j besides, I have no secrets from you." Verezzi took his
The wide folding-doors which led into *he passage were open, Verezzi observed Matilda* as she gazed fixedly through them, to grow pale. He could not see the cause, as he was seated on a sofa at the other end of the saloon. Suddenly she started from her leat¬ her whole frame seemed convulsed by agitation, as she rushed through the door, Verezzi heard an agitated voice ex¬ claim, « Go! go ! to-morrow morning !* Matilda returned—she seated herself again at the harp which she had quitted, and essayed to compose herself; but it was in vain—she was too much agitated, Her voice, as she again attempted to sing 9 refused to perform its oflire 5 and
swings of the harp, violently trembled, * Matilda" mM Vere^i, in a tympa* thising $®m$ « what lias agitated you I Make me a repository of your sorrows: 1 wonld* if possible, alleviate them/* ** Oh no/* said Matilda, affecting un* concern $ " nothing—nothing has hap* pened.

A long chain of intro¬ spection ensued—he could not forget the happy hours which- he had passed with Julia % her interesting softness, herethe- real form, pressed on his aching sense. Still did he feel his soul irresistibly soft* ened towards Matilda—her lo\ ? e for him flattered his vanity ^ pud though he could not feel reciprocal affection towards her, yet her kindness in rescuing him from his E

Matilda. Again overpowered hy the acuteness of his sensations, he sank on the floor, and, in violent convulsions^ tie remained bereft of sense. Matilda Again raised him—again laid bi& throbbing head upon her bosom.— Again, m recovering,!.the,wretched Ve¬ rezzi p^roeived s his situation-*-overccme hy agonfeing reflection, he relapsed into iusenBibihty* % Ohe fit rapidly followed another, and at l&st, in a state of the wildest delirium, he wad conveyed t$ bdd, Matilda fouhd, that a too eager impa* tience had carried her too far. She had prepared herself for. violent, grief, but not for the paroxysms of madness which now seemed really to have seized the brain of the devoted Verezzi.
She sent for a physician—he arrived, and his opinion of Verezzi $ danger aU most drove the wretched Matilda to de- speration. Exhausted by contending passions, she threw herself on a sofa: she thought of the deeds which she had perpetrated to gain Veres's love; she considered that, should her purpose be defeated, at the very instant which her heated imagina¬ tion had portrayed as the commence¬ ment of her triumph $ should all the wickedness, all the crimes, into which she had plunged herself, be of no avail— this idea, more than remorse for her enor* mities, affected her* She sat for a time absorbed in a confu¬ sion of contending thought: her mind was the scene of anarchy and horror: at last, exhausted by their own violence, a deep, a desperate calm took possession of her feculties. . She started from the sofa,
and, ijiaddened by the idea of Veres's dangar, sought his apartment. On a bed lay Vere^h A tlmk film ovei^read his eye^ and he seemed sunk in insensibility, Matilda approached hiiB-*Hshe pressed her burning lips to his—she took his hand ~4t was cold, and at internals slightly agi«ed by convnisions, A deep sigh, at this instant, burst from his Jtps-*-a momentary hectic flushed his cheek, as tbe miserable Vereaai at¬ tempted to rise* Matilda* though &hnwt too much agi¬ tated to eo«iand her emotions, threw herself into a chair behind the curtain? and prepared to watch his movements, " Juliat Julia!" e&ctaimed he, ^tart*

In a delirium of terror, she wildly called for help* Unconscious of every thing around her, she feared Veregni had de»
stroyed himself. She clasped him to her bosom^ and called on his name, in an ee~ stey of terror. The domestic^ alarmed by her excla¬ mations, rushed in, Once again they lifted the insensible Verezzi into the bed ♦•♦-every spark of life seemed now to have bfceu extkiguishe<l 5 for the transport of horror which had torn his soul was al¬ most too much to be sustained. A phy- sic&m was again mnt for—Matilda, mad¬ dened by desperation, in accents -almost inarticulate from terror, demanded hope or despair from the physician. He, who was a man of sense, declared hfe opinion, that Verezzi would speedily recover, though he knew not the event winch might take place in the crisis of the di&order, which now rapidly ap¬ proached. The remonstrances of those around her
ware unavailing, to draw Matilda from tho bed-side of Verezzi. She sat there, a prey to disappointed passion, silent, and watching every turn of the hapless Verezzi's countenance, as, bereft of sense, he hy extended on the bed before her. The animation which was wont to il¬ lumine his sparkling eye was fled; the roseate colour which had tinged his cheek had given way to an ashy paleness—he was insensible to all around him. Ma¬ tilda sat there the whole day, and silent* ly administered medicines to the uncon¬ scious Verezzi, as occasion required. Towards night, the physician again came. Matilda's head thoughtfully leant upon her arm ns he entered the apart¬ ment* K Ah, what hope ? what hope T vtldly she exclaimed.

The physician raised her^ and goon sue* ceeded in recalling her fleeted faculties Overcome by its own violence^ Ma- tild&% despair became softened, tnd the words of the physician operated a§ a balm upon her soul, and bid her feel hope.

Zastrozzi gazed upon him with an in¬ definable expression of insatiated venge¬ ance—indefinable to Matilda, as she gazed upon the expressive countenance of her coadjutor in crime, " Matilda!

The clock struck eleven. His lips unclosed—Matilda turned pale with terror; yetmute* and absorbed by eicpecMtion, remained rooted to her seat* She raised her eyes, and hope again re¬ turned, as she beheld the countenance of . the humane physician lighted up with a beam of pleasure* She could no longer contain herself, but, in an ecstasy of pleasure, as excess* ive as her grief and horror before had been violent, in rapid and hurried accents questioned the physician. The physi* cian, with an expressive smite* pressed his Anger on his lip* She understood the movement; and, though her heart was di~ lated with sudden and excessive delight, she smothered her joy, as she had before her grief, and gazed with rapturous emo¬ tion on the countenance of Verezzi, as, to her expectant eyes, a blush of anima¬ tion tinged his befcre-palfid countenance*
Matilda took .his hand-^the pulses yet beat with feverish violence, She gazed upon 1 his countenance—the film, which before had overspread his eye, disap* peared; returning expression pervaded its orbit, but it was the expression of deep, of rooted grief. The physician made a sign to Matilda to withdraw. She drew the curtain before her, and* in anxious expectation, awaited the event* A d?cp, a long-drawn sigh, at last burst from Verezzi's bosom* He raised him- self-rbist eyes seemed to follow some form, which imagination had portrayed in the remote obscurity of th$ apartment, for Ithe shades of night were but partially dissipated by a lamp, which burnt on a t$h!# lj$biml Hp raised hk almost qerve- less ar% fa<i pas§^djt t across his eyes, - r$if to convince himself* that what he %%w % w^iiptw lUtMiovt qfihe imagination*

And then, more collect* edly, he added, in a mournful tone, 4i Ah no ! you are dead $ lost, lost for ever F* He turned round, and saw the physi¬ cian, but Matilda was still concealed. 41 Where am I ? iJ inquired Verezzi, ad¬ dressing the physician. *' Safe, safe," answered he: " compose yourself j all will be will* 44 Ah, but Julia ?" inquired Verezzi, with a tone so expressive of despair, as threatened returning delirium. 44 Oh f compose yourself,'* said the hu¬ mane physician: "you have been wry v

She stood near the door, listening,— Her heart palpitated with tremulous vio¬ lence, as she listened to VerezzPs breath¬ ing—every sound from within alarmed her. At last she slowly opened the door, and, though adhering to the physician's, directions in not suffering Verezzi to see her, she could not deny herself the pleasure of watching him, and busying herself in little offices about his apart* ment She could hear Vereazi question the attendant collectedly, yet as a person who was ignorant where he was, and knew not the events which had immedi¬ ately preceded his present state.

In proportion as her belief of an Om* nipotent Power, and consequently her iiopes of eternal salvation declined* her ardent and unquenchable passion for Veressat increased, and a delirium of guilty Jove, filled her soul. — ** ShVd I then call him mine for ever ?" mentally inquired Matilda; " will the passion which now consumes me, possess*

Jhe violent grief of Verezzi had sub¬ sided into a deep and settled melancholy; he could now talk of his Julia, indeed it was his constant tbeipe 5 he spoke of her virtues, her celestial form, hcrsen&ibiHty,, and by his nrdent professions of eternal fidelity to iier memory, unconsciously ^almost drove Matilda, to desperation.— Ouce*he ahked Matilda how she died, for on tlie day when the intelligence fmt turned his brain, he waited not to hear »the particulars, the bare feet drove him to instant madpeas*
ret ready invention supplied the place of a premeditated story* *' Oh i my friend," said she tenderly, ** unwillingly do I tell yon, that for you she died; disappointed love, like a worm in the bud, destroyed the unhappy Julia j fruitless were all her endeavours to find you, till at lust concluding that you were lost to her for ever, a deep melancholy by degrees consumed her, and gently led to the grave- she sank into the arms of death without a groan/' 44 And there shall 1 soon follow her," exclaimed Verezxi, as a severer pang of anguish and regret darted through hh soul, * c 1 caused hee death, whose life was far, far dearer to me than my owu. But now it is all over, my hopes of hup- ph&ess in this world are blasted, blasted for ever/' As iio said this, a convulsive sirfi
homed his breast, and the tears silently rolled down his dseeks; for some tink* in vain were Matilda's endeavours to calm him, till at last, mellowed by time, and overcome by reflection* his violent and fierce sorrow was softened into a fixed melancholy. Unremittingly Matilda attended him, atxi gr^iiied his every wish; she, con* jecturiag that solitude might be detri¬ mental to him, often entertained parties, and endeavoured by gaiety to drive away his dejection, but if Vereamis spirits were elevated by company and merri¬ ment, in solitude again they sank, mid a deeper melancholy, a severer regret possessed his bosom, for having allowed himself to be momentarily interested by any thing but the reniet, sbrance of his Julia; for he felt a soft, a tender and ec¬ static emotion of regret, when retrospec¬ tion portrayed the blissful time long since gone by, while happy in ihe society of her whom he idolised, he thought he
J^^^g the sweet, the serene delights of association with a congenial mind, he often now amused himself in retracing with his pencil, from memory, scenes which, though in his Julia's society he had beheld unnoticed, yet were now hal¬ lowed hy the remembrance of her: for he always associated the idea of Julia with the remembrance of those scenes which she had so often admired, aud where, accompanied by her, he had ho often wandered. Matilda, meanwhile, firm in the pur¬ pose of her soul, unremittingly perse¬ vered ; she calmed her mind, and though, at intervals, shook by almost super-hu¬ man emotions, before Verezzi a fixed se¬ renity, a wclhfeigned sensibility, and a downcast tenderness, marked her manner. Grief, melancholy, a fixed, a quiet de* pression of spirits, seemed to have calmed mevy fiercer feeling, when she talked with Verezzi of his lost Julia: but, though
subdued for the preseat, revenge, bate, and the fervour of disappointed low, tarsed lief soot. Often, when she had retired from Ve- rezgi, when he had talked with tender¬ ness, as he was wont, of Julia, and sworn everlasting fidelity to her memory, urould Matilda's soul be tortured by fiercest des¬ peration. v One day, when convening with him of Julia, she ventured to hint, though re¬ motely, at her own faithful and ardent attachment. « Think yon," replied Verezzi, " that because my Julia's spirit is no longer en¬ shrined in its earthly form, that 1 am the less devotedly, the l*» irrevocably hers —No I no! I was hers, 1 am hers, and to aU eternity shall be hers: and when my soul, divested of mortality, departs into another world, even amid tho uni¬ versal wreck of nature, attracted by con-
geniality of sentiment, it will seek the unspotted spirit of my idolised J^Iia. Oh, Matilda! thy attention, thy kind¬ ness, calls for my warmest gratitude—thy virtue demands my Queerest esteem $ but, devoted to the memory of Julia, I can lm?e none but her/' Matilda's whole frame trembled with unconquerable emotion, as thus deter¬ minedly he rejected her; but, calming the more violent passions, a flood of tears rushed from her eyes $ and, an she leant over the back of a sofa on which she re* elined, her sobs were audible. Verczzi's soul was softened towards her—he raised the humbled Matilda, and bid her be comforted, for he wm eon- scions that her tenderness towards hint deserved not an unkind return* w Oh! forgive, forgive me! n exclaimed Matilda, with well4eigned humility j « I O 2
knew not what I said."—She then ab¬ ruptly left the saloon. Beaching ber own apartment, Matilda threw herself on the floor, in an agony of mind too great to be described, Those infuriate passions, restrained as they had been in the presence of Verezzi, now agitated her soul with inconceivable terror. Shook by sudden and irresistible emotions, she gave vent to her despair. « Where, then, is the boasted mercy of God," exclaimed the frantic Matilda, «if he suffer his creatures to endure sW such as this? or where his wisdom, if he implant in the heart passions fu- rieus-nncontroilable-as mine, doomed to destroy their happiness V Outraged pride, disappointed love, and infuriate revenge, revelled through her bosom. Revenge, which called for inno¬ cent Wood-the blood of the hapless Julia.
Her passions were now wound up to the highest pitch of desperation* In in¬ describable agony of mind, she dashed her head against the floor—she impre* cated a thousand curses upon Julia, and swore eternal revenge. At last, exhausted by their own vio- lence, the warring passions subsided—a calm took possession of her soul—she thought again upon Za$troz#i*$ advice-*- Was she now cool? was she now col¬ lected? She was now immersed In a chain of thought^ unaccountable, even to herself, was the serenity which had succeeded.

Verezzi's illness at last assumed so dan*
alarmed, sent for a physician. The humane man, who had attended Vere&gi before, was from home, but one, skilful in his profession, arrived, who de¬ clared that a warmer climate could alone restore Vereses health* Matilda proposed to him to remove to a retired and picturesque spot which she possessed in the Venetian terri¬ tory, Vereazi, expecting speedy dis* solution, and conceiving it to be imma¬ terial where he died, consented $ and in¬ deed he was unwilling to pain one so kind as Matilda by a refusal. The following morning was fixed for the journey* The morning arrived, and Verezzi was lifted into the chariot, being yet extremely weak and emaciated.
Matilda, during the journey, by every care, every kind and sympathising atten* tion, tried to drive away Verezzi*s me¬ lancholy; sensible that, could the weight which pressed upon his spirits be re* moved, he would speedily regain health. But, uo! it was impossible* Though he was grateful for Matilda*s attention, a stiU deeper shade of melancholy over¬ spread his features j a more heart-felt in¬ anity and languor sapped his life. He was sensible of a total distaste of former objects—objects which, perhaps, had formerly forcibly interested him. The terrific grandeur of the Alps, the dash* ing cataract, as it foamed beneath their - feet, ceased to exoite those feelings of awe which formerly they were wont to inspire* The lefty pine-groves inspired no addi¬ tional melancholy, nor did the bloom¬ ing valleys of Piedmont, or the odori¬ ferous orangeries wlpeh scented the air, gladden his deadened soul. They travelled on—they soon entered
the Venetian territory, where, in a gloomy and remote spot, stood the Castella di LaurentinL It was situated in a dark forest—lofty mountains around lifted their aspiring and craggy summits to the skies. The mountains were clothed half up by ancient pines and plane-trees, whose immense branches stretched farj and above, bare granite rocks* on which might be seen, occasionally, a scathed larch, lifted their gigantic and mishapen forms. In the centre of an amphitheatre* formed by these mountains, surrounded by wood, stood the Castella di Lauren- tini, whose grey turrets, and time-wom battlements, overtopped the giants of the forest* Into this gloomy mansion was Ve- rezai conducted by Matilda* The only OS
■Mi}gati^t.'.of.,his .exigence, . As he ad* vanced, supported by Matilda and a domestic, into the castella, Matilda's . : seul*!.engrossed-' by one-idea, confused by to awn unquenchaWe passions, felt not that ecstatic, that calm and serene delight* only experienced by the innocent, and ■"■ whichil excited by a-return to the place ■ where we have spent our dayg of infancy; :A Kb—she felt not this; the o»ly jjlea* s^rable emotion which her return to this remote eait^lla afforded, was the hope that, disengaged from the tumult of, and proximity to the world, she might be the lem interrupted in the prosecution of her ; madly-pla$med- schemes. Though Verezzfs melancholy seemed rather increased than diminished hy the journey, yet his health was visibly im* proved by the progressive change of air iiiid^V»tti»^s€enery s . which must, at thiM^;moiMrttril^. aUeviate the. mmt
deep-rooted grief; yet, again in a fixed gpot—again left to solitude and his own torturing reflections, Verezzi's mind re¬ turned to his lost, his still adored Julia* He thought of her ever j unconsciously he spoke of her; and, by his rapturous exclamations, sometimes almost drove Matilda to desperation* Several days tfhus passed away. Ma* tiida's passion, which, mellowed by time, and diverted by the variety of objects, and the hurry of the journey, had relaxed its violence, now, like a stream pent up* burst all bounds* But one evening, maddened by the tender protestations of eternal fidelity to Julia's memory which Verezzi uttered* her brain was almost turned. Her tumultuous soul, agitated by con¬ tending emotions, flashed from her eyes* Unable to disguise the extreme violence of her sensations, in an ecstasy of despair*
ing love, she rushed from the apartment, where she had left Vere^i, and 5 nnao- cotapanied, wandered iuto the forest, to culm her emotions, and concert some better plana of revenge; for, in VerezjgFs presence, $he scarcely dared to think. Her infuriated soul burned with fiercest revengt?: she wandered into the trackless forest, and, conscious that she was un¬ observed, g&ve vent to her feelings in wild exctemations* ** Oh ! Julia! hated Julia! words are not able to express my detestation of thee. Thou hast destroyed Verejm— thy cursed image, revelling in his heart, h^s blasted my happiness for everi but, ere I die, i will taste revenge—oh! exqui¬ site revenge t-* She paused—-she thought of the passion which consumed her— €S Perhaps one no less violent has induced Julia to rival me, 1 * said she. Again the idea of Verezai's illness—perhaps his cte&th—inftfiated her souU Pity, chased
away by vengeance and disappointed passion, fled.—" Did I say that I pitied thee ? Detested Jutia, much di i my words belie the feelings of my soul. No —no—thou shalt not escape me,—Pity thee!" Again immersed in corroding thought, she heeded not the hour, till looking up, she saw the shades of night were gaining fast upon the earth. The evening wm calm and serene: gently agitated by the evening zephyr, the lofty pines sighed mournfully. Far to the west appeared the evening star, which faintly glittered in the twilight. The scene was solemnly calm, but not in unison with Matilda's soul Softest, most melancholy music, seemed to float upon the southern gale. Matilda listened—it was the nuns at a convent, chanting the requiem for the soui of a departed sisten " Perhaps gone to heaven!" exclaimed Matilda, as, aifected by the contrast,
her guilty soul trembled, A chain of horrible racking thoughts pressed upon ber mn\ ; md* unable to hear the acute* nmn of her sensations, she hastily re¬ turned to the castella, Thus, marked only hy the varying pa* roxysvtts of the passions which consumed her, Matilda passed the time : her brain was confused, her mind agitated by the ill success of her schemes, and her spirits, once so light and buoyant, were now de* pressed hy disappointed hope. What shall I next concert? was the mental inquiry of Matilda* Ah! I know not* She suddenly started—she thought of Zastrozzi, ** Oh! that I should have tiB now foi* gotten Zastrozzi," f^ciaimed Matilda, as a new ray of hope darted through her &hA. ** Bui te is now at Naples, and
$ome time must necessarily elapse beforo I can me him. 44 Oh, Z&$tToz%h Zagtro&gi! w*ould that you were here ! n No sooner had she well arranged her resolutions, which before had been con¬ fused by eagerness, than she summoned Ferdinand, on whose fidelity she dared to depend, and bid him speed to Naples, and hear a letter, with which he wm intrusted,, to Za$tro;au Meanwhile Yere&gi*s health, as the physician had predicted, was so much improved by the warm climate and pwre air of the Castella di Laurentini, that, though yet extremely weak and emaci¬ ated, he was able, as the weather was line, and the summer evenings tranquil, to wander, accompanied by Matilda, through the surrounding scenery* In this gloomy solitude, where, except
the occasional and infrequent visits of a father confessor, nothing occurred to dis¬ turb the uniform tenour of their life, Ve« re^zi-was every thing to Matilda—she thought of him ever; at night, in dreams, his ioiage was present to ber enraptured imagination. She wa& uneasy, except in his presence $ and her soul, shook by contending paroxysms of the passion which consumed her, was transported by unutterable ecstasies of delirious and mad¬ dening love* Her taste for music was exquisite; her voice of celestial sweetness £ and her skill, m she drew sounds of souI*touching me¬ lody from the harp, enraptured the mind to melancholy pleasure. The affecting expression of her voice, mellowed as it was by the tenderness which at times stole over her soul, soft¬ ened Verezzi's listening ear to ecstasy* Yet, again recovering from the tern-
porary delight which her sednciivc blen* dkhments had excited, he thought of Julia, As he remembered her ethereal form^ her retiring modesty, and unaffected sweet* ness, a more violent, a deeper pang of regret and sorrow assailed his bosom, for ] having suffered himself to he even momentarily interested by Matilda, r Hours, days, passed lingering away. They walked in the evenj/igs around the environs of the castella— woods, dark and gloomy, stretched far— cloud-capt moun¬ tains reared their gigantic summits high i and, dashing aihid^t the jutting rocks, foaming cataracts, with sudden and im* petuous course, nought the valley below* Amid this scenery the wily Matilda usually led her victim, One evening when the moon, rising over the gigantic outline of the moun¬ tain^ silvered the far-seen cataract, Ma-* tilda and Verezzi sought the forest,
For a time neither spokes the silence was uninterrupted, save by Matilda's sighs* which declared that violent and repressed emotions tortured the bosom within* They silently advanced into the forest. The azure sky wm spangled with stars —not a wind agitated the unruffled air —not a cloud obscured the brilliant eon- carity of heaven. They ascended an eminence, clothed with towering wood; the tmm around fonaed an amphitheatre* Baneaih, by a gentle wceat* an opening showed an immense rodent of forest, dimly seen hy the moon, which overhung the opposite mountain, The craggy heights beyond might distinctly be seen, ?dg^d by the beams of the silver moon* Verezzi threw himself on the turf **Whata beautiful scene, Matilda t" he exclaimed*
'« Beautiful indeed," returned Matilda. «* I have admired it ever, ami brought you here this evening on purpose to dis¬ cover whether you thought of the works of nature as I do/' <* Oh! fervently do I admire this,** exclaimed Verezzi, as, engrossed hy tlie scene before him, he gazed enraptured. *« Suffer me to retire for a few minutes/* said Matilda. Without waiting for Verezzi's answer* she hastily entered a small tuft of trees, Verez&i gazed surprised 9 and soon sounds of such ravishing melody stole upon the evening breeze, that Veregzt thought some spirit of tbe solitude had made audible to mortal ears ethereal music* He still listened—it seemed todie away —and again a louder* a more rapturous swell, succeeded.
The music was in unison wUh the scene—it was in unison with Verezzi's souh and the success of Matildas arti¬ fice, in this respect, exceeded her r^osi sanguine expectation* He still listened—the music ceased— and Matilda's symmetrical form emerg¬ ing from the wood, roused Verezzi from his vision. ' » Hega2t*d on her—her loveliness and grace struck forcibly upon his senses: her sensibility, her admiration of objects which enchanted him, flattered him $ and her judicious arrangement of the music, Idl no doubt in his mind but tbat, ex. perienchig the tame sensations herself, the feelings of his soul were not unknown to ber, * Thus far every thing went on as Ma¬ tilda desired. To touch his feelings had been her constant aimi could she find
any thing which interested him; any thing to divert h's melancholy ; or could she succeed in effacing another from his mind, she had no doubt but that he would quickly and voluntarily clasp her to his bosom. By affecting to coincide with him in every thing—by feigning to possess th&t congeniality of sentiment and union of idea, which he thought so nee^&ary to the existence of love ? she doubted not soon to accomplish her purpose. But sympathy and congeniality of sen¬ timent, however necessary to that love which calms every fierce emotion^ fills the soul with a melting tenderness, and, without disturbing it, continually pos* se*&es the soul, was by no means conso¬ nant to the ferocious emotions*, the un¬ conquerable and ardent passion which revelled through Matilda's every vein* When enjoying the society of him she

CHAPTER XI. AT last the day arrived when Matilda expected Ferdinand's return. Punctual to his time Ferdinand returned, and told Matilda that Zastro^i had, for the pre- sentj taken up his abode at a cottage, not far, from thence, and that he there awaited her arrival. Matilda was much surprised that Zas¬ trozzi preferred a cottage to her castella j but, dismissing that from her mind* ha¬ stily prepared to attend him, She soon arrived at the cottage, Zas- trozai met her—he quickened his pace towards her.
'* Well,Zastrozzi,"exclaimed Matilda, inquiringly. u Oh !** said Zastro&si, '* our schemes have all, as y^% been unsuccessful. Julia yet live% and, surrounded by wealth and power, yet defies our vengeance, I was planning her destruction, when, obedient to your commands, I came here/* " Alas r exclaimed Matilda, " 1 fear it must be ever thus: but, Zastrozzi, much I need your advice—your assist* ance. Long have I languished in hope¬ less io\ ? e: often have I expected, and as often have my eager expectations been blighted by disappointment." A deep sigh of impatience burst from Matilda's bosom, as a unable to utter more, she ceased. ** 'Tis but the image of that accursed Julia," replied Zastrozzi, ** revelling in his breast, which prevents him from be-
efface that!* 5 ** I would I could elface it," said Ma¬ tilda : i4 the friendship which now exists between m? would quickly ripen into love, and I should be for ever happy* How, Zastro^i, can that be done ? But, before we think of happiness, we must have a care to our safety: we must de¬ stroy Julia, who yet endeavours, by every means, to know the event of Verezsi's destiny, But, surrounded by wealth and power as she is, how can that he done? No bravo in Naples dare attempt her life; no rewards, however great, could tempt the most abandoned of men to brave in* stant destruction, in destroying her; and should we attempt it, the most horrible tortures of the Inquisition, a disgraceful death, and that without the completion of our desire, would be the consequence/* '* Think not so, Matilda/* answered

Still hurmug love, unrepressed, unconquerable panion, revelled through every vein: her senses, rendered delirious by guilty desire, were whirled around in an ine&pre&sihle ec« stasy of anticipated ddight— delight, not unmixed by confused ^^^heimons. She stood thus with hm acms* folded,
at if contemplating the spangled conca¬ vity of heaven. It was late—later than the usual hour of return, and Ve»&i h&& gone out to rn#t Matilda. ** What 1 d^ep iu thought, Matilda?*' «^efoimed V«fe»t 9 playfully* Matilda's cheek, as he thus spoke, wag tinged with a momentary blush y it how- erer qutekl^ passed mwny j and she re¬ plied, « I was ettjoying the serenity of the evening* the beauty of the setting mm, aid then the congenial twilight induced ' me to wander farther than wtal/" The unsuspicious Verezzi observed ndthing peculiar in the manner of Ma« tildai but, observing that the night air wm ohHI, conducted her back to the catfeUa* No art was left untried, no btandmhti&e&t omitted, on the part of Ma-

But all her art could not draw Julia from his memory: he was much softened towards Matilda % he felt esteem, ten¬ derest esteem—but he yet loved not.

Start¬ ing forward, he fell to the earth, and the ruffian instantly dashed into the thick forest* Matilda's snowy arm wm tinged with purple gore: the wound was painful, but m expression of triumph flashed from her eyes, and exces&ive pleasure dilated her bosom: the Mood streamed fast from her ami, and tinged the rock whereon they stood with a purple stain. Verezzi st&rted from tlie ground, and
seeing ihe Wood which itreamed down Matilda*$ gamienU» in aeeeatg of terror demanded where she was wounded, 44 Oh 1 think not upon that/* sh# es> cla'tmed, " but tell me—ah! tell me," sa;d rite, to a voice of well-feigned alarm, 44 are yon wounded mortally ? Oh! what sensations of terror shook me, when 1 thought that the daggers point, after having pierced my arm* had drunk your life-blood." « Oh 1" answered Verezzi, " i am not wounded; but let us haste to the cas- tella" He then tore part of his vest, and with ii bound Matilda** wea. Slowly they proceeded towards the castella. <« What villain, VeNMH," said Matilda, « envious of my happiness, attempted his life, for whom I would ten thousand
times sacrifice my own? Oh! Verezzi, how I thank God, who averted 'the kim dagger from thy heart P* Verezzi answered not; but his heart his feelimp, were irresistibly touched by Matildas behaviour, Such noble con* tempt of danger, so ardent a passion, m to risk her life to preserve his, filled his breast with a tenderness towards her; and ho felt that he could now deav her nothing, nut even the sacri6ce of the poor remains of his happiness, should she demand it. Matilds's breast meanwhile swelled with sedations of unutterable delight; her soul, borne on the pinions of antici¬ pated happiness, flashed in triumphant glances from her fiery ayes. She could scarcely forbear clasping Verezzi in her arms, aad claiming him as her own; but prudence, and a fear of in what manner a prwiatuwe decoration of love might be received, prevented her.
.geon imm the neighbouring convent was sent for by Verezfin. The sdrgeon, soon arrived, eKamined Matilda's ar«ft, and declared that no un¬ pleasant consequences could ensue*—Re* tired to her own apartment, those trans* ports, which before had been allayed by Verezzi's presence, now* unrestrained by reason, involved Matilda's senses in an ecstasy of pleasure. She threw herself on the bed, and, in all the exaggerated colours of imagina¬ tion, portrayed the transports whicli Zastro^i*s artifice had opened to her view. Visions of unreal bless floated during the whole night in her disordered fancy: her senses were whirled around in alter¬ nate ecstasies of happiness aud despair, m almost palpable dreams pressed upon her disturbed brain.
At one time she imagined that Ve* re#&h consenting to their union, presented her his hand; that at her touch the flesh crumbled from it, and, a shrieking spectre, he fled from her view: again, li¬ very clouds floated across her sight, and unconnected, disturbed visions occupied her imagination till the morning, Verezzi's manner, as he met Matilda the following morning, was unusually soft and tender; and in a voice of solicitude, he inquired concerning her health* The roseate flush of animation which tinged her cheek, the triumphant glance of animation which danced in her scintil¬ lating eye, seemed to render the inquiry unnecessary* A dewy moisture filled her eyes, as she gazed with an expression of tumultuous, yet repressed rapture, upon the hapless Verez&i.

Imi triumph more certain, to protract the hour of victory 5 tod, leaving her victim, wandered into the forest to seek Zas* traarzL k When-she arrived at the cottage* ahe learnt that he had walked forth*—She soon met him* " Oh I Zastrozzi—my best Zastrozzi H exclaimed Matilda, 4€ what a source of delight have yon opened to me ! Verezzi is mine—oh ! transporting thought! will be mine for even That distant manner which he usually affected towards me, is changed to a sweet, an ecstatic expression of tenderness. Oh ! Zastrozzi, receive my best, my most fervent thanks/' 44 Julia need not die then," muttered Zastrozzi; " when once you possess Ve¬ rezzi, her deduction is of little eonse- * ft qnence* * The most horrible scheme of revenge af
at this instant glanced across Zasttozzi's mmci. " Oh I Julia must die," said Matilda, " or I shall never be safe j such an influ¬ ence does her image possess over Ve- rezzi's mi Bd) tbat j am convince<J} were he to know that she lived, an estrange¬ ment from me would be the consequence. On! qu ,ckly let me hear that she is dead. I can never enjoy uninterrupted happiness until her dissolution."
What you have just pronounced j, Julias death-warrant," said Zastrozzi, as he disappeared among the thick trees. Matilda returned to the castella. Verezzi, at her return, expressed a ten¬ der apprehension, lest, thus wounded she should have hurt herself by walking/but Matdda quieted his fears, and engaged feim m interesting conversation, which seemed not to have for its object the se -
duction of his affection $ though the ideas conveyed by her expressions were so art¬ fully connected with it, and addressed themselves soforcibiy to Vereazi's feelings, that he wm convinced he ought to love Matilda, though he felt that within him* s0f, which, in spite of reason—in spite of reflection—told him that it was impos¬ sible,
CHAPTER XIII. The enticing smite, toe niotlei;i«8€emi»g eye^ Beneath whose beauteous beams* belying heaven, Lurk eeurchlesa cunning, cruelty, aud deatli THOWSQ2T. Still did Matilda*s blandishments—her unremitting attention—inspire Verezzi with a softened tenderness towards her, —He regarded her as one who a at the risk of her own life, had saved his 5 who loved him with an ardent affection, aud whose affection was likely to be last¬ ing : and though he could not regard her with that enthusiastic tenderness with which he even yet adored the memory of his Julia, yet he might esteem her— faithfully esteem her—and felt not that
horror at uniting himself with her as for¬ merly. But a conversation which he had with Julia recurred to his mind ; he re¬ membered well, tbat when they had talked of their speedy marriage, she had expressed an idea, that a union in this life might endure to all eternity 5 and that the chosen of his heart on earth, might, by congeniality of sentimcut, be united in heaven* The idea was hallowed by the remem¬ brance of his Julia; but chasing it, as au unreal vision, from his mind, again his high sentiments of gratitude prevailed. Lost in these ideas* involved.in a train of thought, and unconscious where his footsteps led him, he quitted the castella. His reverie was interrupted by low mur¬ murs, which seemed to float on the si¬ lence of the forest: it was scarcely au¬ dible, yet Verezzi felt an undefinable wish to know what it was. He advanced to¬ wards it—-it was Matilda's voice.
Verezzi approached nearer, and from within heard her voice in complaints*— He eagerly listened.—Her sobs rendered the words, which iu passionate exclama¬ tions burst from Matilda's lips, almost inaudible. He still listened—a pause in the tempest of grief which shook Ma¬ tilda's soul seemed to have taken place* "Ohl Vcrczid—cruel, unfeeling Ve* rezgil" exclaimed Matilua, as a fierce paroxysm of passion seized her brain-*- 44 will you thus suffer one who adores you, to linger in hopeless love, and wit* ness the excruciating agony of one who idolises you, as I do, to madness ?" As she spoke thus, a long-drawn sigh closed the sentence. Verezzi's mind was agitated by various emotions as he stood s but rushing in at last, raised Matilda in his arms, and ten¬ derly ^attempted to comfort her*
She started as he entered—she heeded not his words | hut, seemingly overcome by shame, cast herself at his feet, and hid her face in his robe. He tenderly raised her, and his ex* pressions convinced her, that the reward of alt her anxiety was now about to he reaped. The most triumphant anticipation of transports to come filled her bosom; yet, knowing it to be necessary io dissemble— knowing th&t a shameless claim on hU affections would hut disgust Verezzi, sh$ said*— «* Oh! Verezzi, forgive me; supposing myself to be alone—supposing no one overheard the avowal of the secret of my soul, with which, believe me, I never more intended to have importuned you, what shameless sentiments—shameless even in solitude—have I not given vent
to. I can no longer conceal, that the pa$sion with which I adore you is uncon¬ querable, irresistible: but, I conjure you* think not upon what yon have this nm* ment heard to my disadvantage j nor de¬ spise a weak unhappy creature, who feels it impossible to overcome the fatal passion which consumes her, 44 Never more will I give vent, even in solitude, to my love—never more shall the importunities of the hapless Matilda reach your ears. To conquer a passion fer¬ vent, tender as mine, is impossible." As she thus spoke, Matilda, sremingly overcome by shame, sank upon the turf. A sentiment stronger than gratitude, more ardent than esteem, and more tender than admiration, softened Verezzi s heart as he raised Matilda* Her symmetrical form shone with tenfold loveliness to his heated fancy: inspired with sudden fond¬ ness, he cast himself at her feet i 5
A Lethean torpor crept **pon his mmm > and, as te lay prostrate before Matilda, a total forgetfulness of every former event of his life swam in fei$ iimy brain. In passionate exclamations he avowed m* hounded love. *' Oh, Matilda 1 dearest, angelic Ma¬ tilda! 0 exclaimed Vereaaa, I am even now unconscious what blinded me— what kept me from acknowledging my adoration of thee I—adoration never to be changed by circumstances^-never effaced by time* 5 * * The fire of voluptuous, of maddening love, scorched his veins, as he caught the transported Matilda in his arms, and, in accents almost inarticulate with passion, swore eternal fidelity* « And accept my oath of everlasting allegiance to thee, adored Verezzi/' ex¬ claimed Matilda: « accept my vows of eternal, indissoluble love/'
unwonted and mimii emotions M^ called Matilda his wife—in the delirium of sudden fondness he clasped her to Ms bosom—** and though love like ours/ exclaimed the infatuated Vere&zi, " wants not the vain ties of human laws, yet, that our love may want not any sanction which could possibly be given to it, let immediate orders be given for the cele¬ bration of our union** 1 Matilda exultingly consented; never had she experienced sensations of delight like these: the feehngs of her soul flushed in exulting glances from her fiery eyes. Fierce, transporting triumph filled her soul as she gazed on her victim, whose mildly-beaming eyes were now charac¬ terised by a voluptuous expression. Her heart beat high with transport; and, as they entered the castella, the swelling emotions of her bosom were too tuniul** tuous for utterance.
tofe^r.l^atingbr^aati and, overcome by « ecstasy of delirious passion, her^nses were whirled around in confused and in- Wf»»9sible delight* A mw and fierce pwon raged likewise in VeteaszVa breast; he returned her embrace \vith ardour, and ctoped her in fierce transports. But ihe adoration with which he now regarded Matilda, was a different senti* ment from that chaste and mild emotion which lui characterised his love for JttU.%: tir&t passion, which he had fondly supposed would eod but with bis exist¬ ence, wm effaced by the mm of another. H$w was Matilda's purpose attained— the next day would behold her his hrido —the next day would behold her fondest purpose accomplished,, With the most eager impatience, the fiercest anticipation of transport, did she wait for its arrival
Slowly passed the day, and slowly did the clock toll each lingering hour as it rolled away* The following mornine: at last arrived: Matilda arose from a sleep^s couch-- fierce, transporting triumph, flashed from her eyes as she embraced her victim. He returned it—he called her hfa dear and ever-beloved spouse; and, in ail the trans¬ ports of maddening love* declared his im¬ patience for the arrival of the monk who wm to unite them. Every blandishment —every thing which might dispel reflec¬ tion, was this day put in practice by Ma* tilda. The monk at last arrived: the fatal ce¬ remony—fatal to the peace of Verezzi— was performed* A magnificent feast had been previ¬ ously arranged; every luxurious viand, ewy expensive wine, which might con-
was present in .prpfiision* Matilda's joy, her soul-felt triumph, wm too great for utteranae-^too great for comceatoeM* The exultation of her in¬ most 1 soul, flashed in expressive glances from her scintillating eyes, expressive of joy intend—unutterable. Animated irith excesrive delight, she started from the table, and, seizing Vc- rezzi*s band, in a transport of inconceiv¬ able bli$s, dragged him in wild sport and varied movements, to the sound of swell¬ ing and soul-touching melody. 44 Come, my Matilda,*' at last ex* claimed Verezzi, " come, I am weary of transport—-sick with excess of unutterable pleasure: let us retire, and retrace in dreams the pleasures of the day." little did Verezzi think that this day
wm the basis of his future misery; little did he think that, amid the roses of suc¬ cessful and licensed voluptuousness, re¬ gret, horror, and despair would arise, to Mast the prospects which, Julia being forgot, appeared so fair, so ecstatic* The morning came.^—Inconceivable emotions—inconceivable to those who have never felt them—dilated Matilda's soul with an ecstasy of inexpressible bliss: every barrier to her passion was thrown down—every opposition conquered * 9 ^till was her bosom the scene of fierce and contending passions. Though in possession of every thing wl*ch her fancy had portrayed with such excessive delight, she was far from feeling that innocent and calm pleasure which soothes the souh and, calming? each violent emotion, fills it with a se¬ rene happiness. Ho—her brain was whirled around in transports; fierce, con* fused transports of visionary and unreal
nem, panted with the delight of gratified and^pectant desire $ ^till was she not happy i she enjoyed not that tranquillity whioh k nec^sary to the existence of happiness, " In this temper of mind* for a short pe¬ riod she left Vere^zt, as she had ap* pointed a meeting with her coadjutor in wickedness. She soon met him. 44 I need not ask/* exclaimed Zas* trozgij u for well do I see, in those tri¬ umphant glances^ that Vere^^i is thine; that tbe plan which we concerted when last we met, has put you in possession of that which your soul panted for." *« Oh! Zastrozzit u said }fatilda»—- kind, excellent Z&stmzm: what words can express the gratitude which I feel to¬ wards you—what words can express the
yonr advice; fet still, amid the ro^es of snccessfnl love*-^imid the ecstasies of transporting voluptuonsness—fear,hlight- ing chilly fear, damps my hopes of hap* piness. Julia, the hated, accursed Julians image ? is the phantom which scares my otherwise certain confidence of eternal delight: uould she but be hurled to de¬ struction—could some other artifice of my friend sweep her from the number of the living—" * € Tis enough, Matilda/' interrupted Za9tro#£i; 44 'tis enough: in six days hence meet me here; meanwhile, let not any corroding anticipations destroy your present happiness: fear not; hut, on the arrival of your faithfel Zastro^i, expect the earnest of the happiness which you wish to enjoy for ever/* Thus saying, Zastro^i departed, and Matilda retraced her steps to her cas- tella.
Amid the delight, the %c$imy* for which her soul had so }ong panted—amiA tbe enih^ace^ of him whom she had fondly supposed alone to constitute all terrestrial happiness, racking^ corroding thoughts poss$$«ed Matildas bosom* Deeply musing on schemes of £ntnre delight—delight established hy the grati* fication of most diabolical revenge, her &ym fised upon the ground, heedless what path she pursued, Matilda advanced along the forest, A voice aroused her from her reverie— it was VerezziW*the well-known* the tenderly^adored tone, struck upon hei" senses forcibly j she started, and, taster ing towards him, soon allayed those feara which her absence had excited iu the fond heart of her spouse, and on which account he had anxiously quitted tha castella to pearch for her. Joy, ra^ptur^>u% ecstatic b&ppiness^nn*
reined for mx days in Matilda's bosom* Five days passed away, the skth ar¬ rived, and, when the evening came, Ma* tilda, with eager and impatient steps* sought the forest. The evening was gloomy, dense va¬ pours overspread the air$ the wind, low and hollow, sighed mournfully in the gi¬ gantic pine trees, and whispered in low hissings among the withered shrubs which grew on tiie rocky prominences* Matilda watted impatiently for the ar¬ rival of Zmimzzu At last his towering form emerged from an interstice in the rocivs« He advanced towards her* 44 Success!

wrmpted Matilda t ** not to Venice—we must mt go to Venice*** Vereaari was slightly surprised, hut im¬ puting her manner to indisposition, it passed off* Unmarked by events of importance* a month passed away. Matilda's passion, nnaliayed hy satiety, unconquered by time, still raged with its former fierce* f!g0&-"$£ilt was every earthly delight cen¬ tred in VereKKi^ and, in the &ir<\t&wn visions of her imagination, she portrayed to herself that this happiness would last ftr ever. It Was one evening that Vereazi and Matilda sat, happy in thc society of each other, that a servant entering, presented the tetter with a sealed paper. The contents were: ** Matilda Contessa di laurcntini is summoned to appear be¬ fore the holy in^ubition~to appear be-
fore its tribunal, immediately on the re¬ ceipt of this summons,** Matilda's chee^, 'as she read it, was blanched with terror. The summons— the fatal, irresistible summons, struck her with chilly awe. Slie attempted to thrust it into her bosom; but, unable to conceal her terror, she essayed to rush from the apartment—but it was in vain: her trem¬ bling limbs refused to support her, and she sank fainting on the iloor. Verezzi raised her—he restored her fleeting senses; he cast himself at her feet, and in the tenderest, most pathetic accents, demanded the reason of her alarm* ** And if,** said he, " it is any thing of which 1 have unconsciously been guilty—if it is any thing in my conduct which has offended you, oh! how soon> how truly would I repent. Dearest Ma¬ tilda, I adore you to madness: tell me then quickly**—confide in one who ioveg you as I do." :
u E»$e^ Vepek2i«*' e^claim^ Matilda, in a tone expressive M ^rene horror t « and since the truth can no longer be concealed, peruse that letter." Shf presented him the fatal summons* He.eagerly snatched it: breathless with impatience, he opened it* But what words can express the consternation of the affrighted Verezzi, as the summons, mysterious and inexplicable to him, press¬ ed upon his straining eye-bali For an instant he stood fixed in mute and ago¬ nising thought At last, in the forced serenity of despair, he demanded what w&s to he done. # Matilda answered not; for her soul, * borne on tbe pinions of anticipation, at that instant portrayed to itself ignomi¬ nious and agonising dissolution* t ««What is to be done?" again, in a deeper tone of despair, demanded Ve- rezzi.

At last, one evening Verezzi, tired even with monotony of ecstasy, proposed to Matilda to take the gondola, and go to a festival which was to be celebrated at St, Mark's Place.

CHAPTER XIV, The evening was serene.—Fleecy clouds floated on the horizon—the moons full orb, in cloudless majesty, hung high in air, "and was reflected in silver brilliancy by every wave of the Adriatic, as, gently agitated by the evening breeze, they dashed against innumerable gondolas which crowded the L&guna, Exquisite harmony, borne on the pi» nions of the tranquil air, floated in vary¬ ing murmurs: it sometimes died away, and then again swelling louder, in melo¬ dious undulations softened to pleasure mxny listening ear,
scene beamed with pleasure3 unrepressed gaiety filled every heart hut JuliaV, as with a vacant stare, unmoved by feelings of pleasure, unagifcftted by the gaiety which filled every other soul, she con¬ templated thc varied scene. A magnifi¬ cent gondola carried tlie Marchesa di Strobazzo; and the innumerable flam¬ beaux which blazed around her rivalled the meridian sun. It was the pensive, melancholy Julia, who, immersed in thonght> sat unco i- scious of every external object, whom the fierce glance of Matilda measured with a haughty expression of surprise and re¬ venge* The dark fire which flashed from her eye, more than told the feelings of her soul, as she fixed it on her rival 5 and had it possessed the power of the basi¬ lisk's, Julia would have expired on the spot, It was the ethereal form of the now for-
gotten Julia which fir&t caught Vere^zi^ -eye* For an instant he ga&ed with sur* pri$e upon her symmetrical figure, and was about to point her out to Matilda, when, in the downcast countenance of the enchanting female he recognised his Iong4ost Julia. To paint the feelings of Vere&jri—as Julia raised her head from the attitude in which it was fixed, and disclosed to his view that countenance which he had for* marly ga^ed on in ecstasy, ihe index of that sou! to which he had sworn everlast¬ ing iidelity—4s impossible. The Lethean torpor, m it were, which before had benumbed him; the charm, which had united him to Matilda, was dissolved* All tbe air-built virions of delight, which had but a moment before floated in gay variety iu his enraptured imagina* tion* faded away, and, in place of these,
regret, horror, and despairing repent¬ ance, reared their heads amid the rose^ of momentary voluptuousness. He still gazed entranced, but Julia^ gondola, indistinct frora distance, mocked his straining eyeb&lh For a time neither spoke: the gondote rapidly passed onwards, but, immersed in thought, Matilda and Verezzi heeded not its rapidity. They had arrived at St Mark's Place, and the gondolier's voice, as he an¬ nounced it, was the first interruption ©f the silence. They started*—Verezzi now, for the first time, moused from his reverie of horror, saw that tte scene before him was real; and that the oaths of fidelity which he had so often and so fervently sworn to Julia were broken.
The extreme of horror geteed his brain ~a ffigorific torpidity of despair chilled every sense* and his eyes, fixedly, gaged on vacancy* . w Oh ! return—instantly return I" im* patiently replied Matilda to the question of the gondolier. The gondolier, surprised, obeyed her, and they returned. The spacious canal was crowded with gondolas 5 merriment and splendour reign¬ ed around^ enchanting harmony stole over the scene y but, listless of the music, heeding not the splendour, Matilda sat lost in a ma^e of thought. ' Fiercest vengeance revelled through her bosom^ and, in her own mind, she resolved a horrible purpose. Meanwhile, the how was late, the
her beams vertically on the unruffled Adriatic^ when the gondola stopped be¬ fore /Matilda's mansion, A sumptuous supper had been pref pared for their returriv Silently Matilda entered—silently Vere^i followed. Without speaking, Matilda seated her^ self at the supper table; Verezzi,'with an air of listlessness, threw himself into, a chair beside hen For a time neither spoke. *« You are not well to-night," at last stammered out Verezai:. $s what has dis¬ turbed you? ,? ..,..-.... "Disturbed me!".repeated Matilda: <f why do. you suppose, that any thing has disturbed me ?" A more violent paroxysm of horror
seemed now to seize Vererfs brain, He pressed hi* hand to his burning forehead —the agony of hu mind was too great to be concealed—Julia's form, m he had last seen her ? floated in his fancy, and, over- powered by the r^sistteasiy horrible ideas which pressed upon them, his senses failed him: he faintly uttered Julia's name—he sank forward, and his throb¬ bing temples reclined on the table* ' ** Artec! awake! prostrate, perjured Verezzi, awake!" exclaimed the infu¬ riate Matilda, in a tone of gloomy horror* Verezzi started up, and gazed with surprise upon the countenance of Ma¬ tilda, which, convulsed by passion, flash* ed desperation and revenge* m Tk plain/* said Matilda, gloomily, «* \w plain, be loves me not/* A confusion of contending emotions battled in Verezzft bosoms his marriage
?ow—lii* faith plighted to Matildas-con¬ vulsed Itis soul with indescribable agony* Still did she possess a great empira over his soul—still was her frown terrible—^and still did the hapless Verezzi tremble at the tones of her voice, as, in a phrensy of desperate passion, she b&de him quit her for ever t 4t And," added she, 4t go, dis* close the retreat of the outcast Matilda to her enemies j deliver me to the inquisi¬ tion, that a union with her you detest may fetter yon no longer." Exhausted by breathless agitation, M&* tilda ceased : the passions of her soul flashed from her eyes ^ ten thousand con¬ flicting emotions battled in Verezzi's bosom ; he knew scarce what to do 5 but, yielding to the impulse of the moment, he cast himself at Matilda's feet, and groaned deeply. At last the words, u I am ever yowts^ I ever shall be yours/* escaped his lips,
For ^'timo Matilda .stood immoveable. At last she looked ou Verezzi 5 she ga^ed downwards upon his majestic and youth¬ ful figure j she looked upon lm souhillu- mm&A countenance, and tenfold love as¬ sailed her softened souh She mised him -—in an oblivious delirium of sudden fond¬ ness she clapped him to her bosom, and, hrwiid and hurried expressions,* asserted her right to his iove* - Iier breast palpitated with fiercest emotions 5 she pressed her burning lips to his 1 inosA fervent, most voluptuous sensation? of ecstasy revelled through her bosom* Verezzi caught the infection; in an instant of oblivion, every oath of fidelity which he had sworn to another, like a baseless ^lond* dissolved away > a Lethean torpor crept over hfe senses; he forgot Julia, or remembered her only as an un¬ certain vision, which floated before his fancy mo:v§- »s an Meal being of another
there, than as an enchanting and conge* nial female, to whom his o&ths of eternal fidelity had been given, Overcome by unutterable transports of returning bliss, she started from his em* brace—she seized his hand—her face was overspread with a heightened colour as she pressed it to her lips* '* And are you then mine—mine for ever ?" rapturously exclaimed Matilda, *' Oh ! I am thine—thine to all eter¬ nity," returned the infatuated Verez&i; " no earthly power shall sever us; joined by congeniality of soul, united by a bond to which God himself bore witness." He ago in clasped her to his bosom— —-again, as an earnest of fidelity, im¬ printed a fervent kiss on htr glowing cheek*, and, overcome by the violent and resistless amotions of the moment, swore,
that nor heaven nor hell should cancel the union which he here solemnly and unequivocally renewed. Verezzi filled an overflowing goblet. «* Do yon love me } n inquired Matilda, ** May the lightning of heavtn con¬ sume me, if I adore thee not to distrac¬ tion ! m^y I be plunged in endless tor¬ ments, if my love for thee, celestiat Ma¬ tilda* endures not for ever !** Matilda's eyes flashed fiercest triumph $ tbe exultingly delightful feelings of her ftottl were too much for utterance—she gpoke mot* but gaged fixedly on VerezzTs countenance.

Maddened by this death-blow to al! anticipation of happiness, Matilda's fa¬ culties, as she stood, whirled in wild con¬ fusion: she scarce knew where slie was, At la«*t a portentous, a frightful calm, spread itself over her soul Kevenge* direst re\enge, swallowed up every other feeling* Her eyes scintillated with a ftegd-Hke expc^tsion* She advanced to the lifele^ cor^j o^Verem~she plucked

She fell on the floor, but suddenly start™ ing up, attempted to escape her blood* thirsty persecutor. Nerved anew by this futile attempt to escape her vengeance, the ferocious Ma¬ tilda seized Julia's floating hair, and holding her back with fiend-like strength, stabbed her in a. thousand places^ and, with exulting pleasure, again and again buried the dagger to the hilt in her body,

Tney searched every apartment; at last they entered that in which Matilda, motionless with despair, remained. Even the niem officials, hardy, unfeel¬ ing as they were, started back with mo¬ mentary horror as they beheld the fair countenance of tin murdered Julian fair even in death, and her body disfigured v. ith numberless ghastly wounds t 44 Tliis cannot be suicide," muttered one, who, by his superior manner, seemed. to be their chief, as be raised the fragile form of Julia from the ground, anrt $#^ blood, scarcely yet cold, trickled from her vestments, " Put your orders in execution," added he.

md> Confined in a damp and narmw <rell, Matilda saw that rfl her hopes of fetnro delight would end in speedy and ignomi¬ nious dissolution. Slow p&ssed the time—slow did the dock at St. Mark's toll the revolving hours as languidly they passed away* Might came on, and the hour of mid¬ night struck upon Matilda^ soul as her death knelh A noise was heard in the passage which led to the prison. Matilda raised her head frdm the #all against which it was reclined, and eagerly listened, as if in expectation of an event which wotild seal her future fate. She still ga^ed, when the chains of th& En¬ trance wer#* unlocked. The doot, as It opened, grated harshly on its hinges, afid two officials entered*
** Follow me/' wm the keonic i^june* tion which greeted her terror-struck ear, Trembling, Matilda arose: her limbs* stiffened by confinement almost refused to support her 5 but collecting fortitude from desperation* $he followed the relent-' less officials in silence. One of th^ffl bore a lamp, whose rays darting in uncertain columns, showed, by strong contrasts of light and shade, thq cxtremo masmtocsft of the parage**. r The Gothic frieze above was worked with art£ and the corbels, in various and grotesque forms* jutted from the tops of duit^red,pUftstei9* They $topped at a door* Voices were heard (mm within: their hollow tones filled Matilda^ soul with tmcopquerable tremours.. ]fct,$fae ^l^^oned all her re¬ solution—she resolved to be collected
to death, to meet her fate with fortitude, that the populace, as they gazed, might ' not exclaim— M The poor Laurentini dared not to die. s ' These thoughts were passing in her mind during the delay which was occa¬ sioned by the officials conversing with another whom they met there. At last they ceased—an uninterrupted silence reigned; the immense folding doors were thrown open, and disclosed to Matilda's view a vast and lofty apart¬ ment. In the centre was a table, which a lamp, suspended from thc centre, over¬ hung, and where two stern-looking men, habited in black vestments, were seated. Scattered papers covered the tabie, with which the two men in black seemed busily employed.

CHAPTER XVI. Fear, for their scourge, mean villams have j Thou »rt the torturer of ths brave. One of the inquisitors raised his eye& j he put hack the papers which he was ««* amining, and in a solemn tone asked her name. ** My name is Matilda; my title La Contessa di Laurentini/ 1 haughtily she answered $ 4i nor do 1 know the motive for that inquiry, except it were to exult over my miseries, which yon are, I sup* pose, no stranger to/* «* Waste not your time/* exclaimed the
jectures upon our conduct $ but do you know for what you are summoned here ?" " No/' replied Matilda, * f Swear that yon know not for what crime you are here imprisoned/'said the inquisitor- Matilda took the oath required. As she spoke, a dewy sweat burst from her broiv, and her limbs were convulsed by the extreme of horror, yet thc expression of her countenance was changed not, *' What crime have you committed which might subject you to the notice of this tribunal r' ? demanded he, in a deter* mined tone of voice, Matilda gave no answer, save a smile of exulting scorn, She fixed her regards upon the inquisitor: her dark eyes flashed fiercely, but she spoke not.
cc Answer me/ exclaimed he, " what to confess might save both of us needless trouble*" Matilda answered not, but gazed in silence upon the inquisitor's counte¬ nance. He stamped thrice—four officials rush¬ ed in, and stood at some distance irom Matilda. " I am unwilling," said the inquisitor, " to treat a female of high birth with in¬ dignity; but if yon confess not instantly, my duty will not permit me to withhold the question. 51 A deeper expression of contempt shad¬ ed Matilda's beautiful countenance: she frowned, but answered not. " You will persist in this foolish obsti¬ nacy ? M exclaimed the inquisitor.—" Of¬ ficials, do your duty-"
Instantly the four, who till now had ^to>d in the back-ground^ rushed for¬ wards r they seized Matilda, and bore her Into the obscurity of the apartment* Her dishevelled ringfets floated i&ne* gligent luxuriance over her alabaster bo* Horn; her eyes, the contemptuous glance of which bad now given way to a eon* filled exprestion of alatoi, were- almost closed | and her symmetrical form, as borne away by the four officials, looked intofe&tingly lotely* The other inquisitor, who, till now* ibttsied by the papers which lay before him, had heeded not Matilda's examina¬ tion, raised his eyes, and beholding the fora* of a female, with a commanding tone of voice, called to the officiate t® stop* Submissively they obeyed his order*— Matilda, released from the Ceil faas&fa of these relentless ministers of justice, ad¬ vanced to the table.
Her extreme beauty softened the in¬ quisitor who had spoken last. He little thought that, under a form so celestial, so interesting, lurked a heart depraved, vicious as a demon s» He therefore mildly addressed her; ancl telling her that, on some futum day, her examination would be renewed, commit¬ ted her to the care of the officials, with orders to conduct her to an apartment better suited to her rank. The chamber to which she followed the officials was spacious and well fur* nished, but large iron bars secured the windows^ which were high, and impos¬ sible to be forced. Left again to solitude* again to her own gloomy thoughts-—her retrospection hut horror and despair—her hopes of futurity none—her fears many and horrible—M&« tilda's situation is better conceived than described.
Floating m wild confusion, the ideas which presented themselves to her ima¬ gination wem too horrible for endurance. Deprived, as she was, of all earthly happiness, fierce as had been her passion for Vereozi, the disappointment of which iublimed her brain to the most infuriate delirium of resistless horror, the wretched Matilda stilt shrunk at death—-she shrunk at the punishment of those crimes, in whose perpetration no remorse had touch¬ ed her soul, for which, even now* she re¬ pented not, but as they had deprived her of terrestrial enjoyments* She thought upon the future state- she thought upon the arguments of Zas~ troz&i against the existence of a Deity : her inmost soul now acknowledged their falsehood, and she shuddered as she re* fleeted that her condition was irretriev¬ able* Resistless horror revelled through her
she rapidly paced the apartment i i\t last* overpowered, she sank upon a sofa. At last the tumultuous passions, ex¬ hausted by their own violence, subsided t the storm, which so lately had agitated Matilda's soul, ceased; a serene calm succeeded, and sleep quickly overcame her faculties. Confused visions flitted in Matilda's imagination whilst under the influence of sleep j at last they assumed a settled shape. Strangely brilliant and silvery clouds seemed to flit before her sight: celestial music, enchanting as the harmony of the spheres, serened Matilda's soul, and, for an instant, her situation forgotten, she lay entranced, On a sudden the music ceased ^ the
anmemnewily of heaven seemed to opett at the zenith, and ( a being, whose coun¬ tenance beamed with unutterable benefit een^e, descended. It seemed to be clothed in a trans¬ parent tohe of Mowing silver: its eye scintillated with Buper-tminan brilliancy, whilst her dream, imitating reality al* most to exactness, caused the entranced Matilda to yujposc that it addressed her in thaw words *— *« Poor sinning Matilda I mpent, it is not yot too late,—God's mercy is nn* bouuded.~~Repettt! and thou mayest yet fee saved/* ** Thescwords yet tinfled in Matilda's ears 5 yet were her eyes lifted to heaven, as if following the visionary phantom who had addressed her in her dre&m, when, much confused, she arose from thc sofa*
A dream so like reality made a istfOBg impression upon Matilda's soul- The ferocious passions, which so lately had battled fiercely in her bosom, were calmed: she lifted her eyes to heaven: they beamed with an expression of sin- cercst penitence; for sincerest penitence, at this moment, agonised whilst it calmed Matilda's soul. ** God of mercy! God of heaven l" ex¬ claimed Matilda j * f my sins are many and horrible, but I repent," Matilda knew not how to pray j but God, who from the height of heaven pe« netrates the inmost tfeo«ghts of terrestrial hearts, heard the outcast sinner, as in tears of true and agonising repentance she knelt before him, She despaired no longer—Sh<? confided hi the beneficence of her Creator 5 and, in
the bour of adversity* when the firmest heart Must tremble at his power, no longer a hardened sinner, demanded mercy* And mercy, by the All-benevo¬ lent of heaven, is never refused to those who humbly, yet trusting in his good- ness, ask it Matilda's soul was filled with a celes¬ tial tranquillity* She remained upon her knees in mute and fervent thought: she prayed { nnd, with trembling, asked for* gtvenet» of her Creator* No longer did that agony of despair torture ber bosom* True, she wag ill at ease 5 remorse for her crimes deeply af¬ fected her | and though her hopes of sal* vation were great, her belief in God and a future state firm, the heavy sighs which burst from her bosom s showed that the arrows of repentance had penetrated deeply. Several days passed away, during
ti!da*s soul, conquered by penitence, were mellowed into a fixed and quiet depression*

At last the day arrived, when, exposed to a public trial, Matilda was conducted to the tribunal of il consiglio di dieci* The inquisitors were not, as before, at a table in the middle of the apartment; but a port of throne was raised at one end, on which astern-looking man, whom she had never seen before, sat: a great num¬ ber of Venetians were assembled, and lined all sides of the apartment. Many, in black vestments, were ar¬ ranged behind the superior's throne;
who had before examined her« Conducted by two officiate, with a fal¬ tering step, a pallid cheek, and downcast eye, Matilda advanced to that part of the chamber where sat the superior. The dishevelled ringlets of her hair floated unconfmed over her shoulders t her symmetrical and elegant form was enveloped in a thin white robe. The expression of her sparkling eyes was downcast and hupblej yet, seem* iugjy unmoved by the seme before her, she remained in silence at the tribunal, The curiosity and pity of every one, as they ga^ed on the loveliness of the beautiful culprit, was strongly excited. <c Who is she ? who is she ?" ran in in¬ quiring whispers round the apartmast*—• No one could tell

Again he was about—again, with a look of detestation and horror, he had fixed his penetrating eye upon the trembling Matilda, and had unclosed his mouth to utter the fatal sentence, when his atten- tion was arrested by a man who rushed from the crowd, and exclaimed, in a hurried tone™ " La Contessa di Laurentini k mm- cent/*
44 Who are you, who dare assert that V* exclaimed the superior, with an air of doubt. 44 I am,* s answered he, ** Ferfinand Zeilmt£, a German, the ^rvant of la Contessa di Laurentini, and I dare assert that she is innocent. 11 " Your proof," exclaimed the superior, with a severe frown. *' It was late," answered Ferdinand, " when I entered the apartment, and then I beheld two bleeding bodies, and La Contessa di Laurentini, who lay be* reft of sense on the sofa.* 1 44 Stop!" exclaimed the superior, Ferdinand obeyed. The superior whispered to one in Mack vestments, and soon four officials enter* M

All present uttered a cry of terror—all $tarted s shocked aud aiua&ed, from the horrible sight; yet some, recovering them- $eive$£ ga^ed at the celestial loveliness of the poor victim to reveuge, which, un- subdued by death, still rfioue from her placid features* A deep-drawn sigh heaved Matilda's bosom; tears, spite of all her firmness, rushed into her eyes; and she had nearly fainted with dbzy horror; but* overcom¬ ing it, and collecting all her fortitude, riiq advanced towards the corse of her
rival, and, in the numerous wounds which covered it, saw the fiat of her future des¬ tiny* She still gazed on it—a deep silence reigned—not one of the spectators, so in¬ terested were they, uttered a single word —not a whisper was heard through the spacious apartment. " Stand off! guilt-stained, relentless woman," at last exclaimed the superior fiercely: 4€ is it not enough that yon have persecuted, through life, the wretched female who lies before you—murdered by you ? Cease, therefore, to gaze on her with looks as if your vengeance was yet insatiated* But retire, wretch: officials, take her into your custody j meanwhile, bring the other prisoner/' Two officials rushed forward, and led Matilda to some distance from the tri¬ bunal; four others entered, leading a

44 Matilda/* replied Zastrozzi* whilst a smile of contemptuous atuci&rti pmyea over his features—** Matilda, fear not: fate wills m to die; and I intend to meet desth, to encounter annihilation, with tranquillity. Am I not convinced of the non-existence of a Deity? am I not con¬ vinced that death will but render this soui more free, more unfettered ? Why need I then shudder at death ? why need any one, whose mind has risen above the shackles of prejudice^ the errors of a false and injurious superstition/* Here the superior interposed, and de~ clared he could allow private conversation no longer. Quitting Matilda, therefore, Zastroj^i, unappalled by the awful scene before him, unshaken by the near approach of agonising death, which he now fully be¬ lieved he was about to suffer, advanced towards the superior's throne.

44 Think you, that whilst I perpetmted the deed I feared thc punishment? or whilst 1 revenged a parent's cause, that the futile torments which I am doomed to suffer here, had any weight in my de¬ termination ? No—no. If the vile de¬ ceiver, who brought my spotle&s mother to a tomb of misery, fell beneath the dagger of one who swore to revenge her - —if I sent him to another world, who destroyed the peace of one I loved more than myself in this, anf I to be blamed ?" Zastrozzi ceased, and, with an expres¬ sion of scornful triumph, folded his arms. 44 Go on V f exclaimed the superior. " Go on ! go on 1" echoed from every part of the immense apartment. He looked around him. His manner awed the tumultuous multitude; and, in uninterrupted silence, the spectators
ga^ed upon the unappalled Zastrozzi, who, towering as a demi-god, stood in ite midst '" Am I then called upon," said he, ** to disclote things which bring painful remembrancer to my mind? Ah! how P&lnftt!f But no matter; you shall know the name of htm who fell beneath this arm: yon shall know him, whose me- XBoiy, even now, I detest more than I can express, I care not who knows my actions, convinced as I am, and con¬ vinced to all eternity as I shall be, of their rectitude,~Know, then, that Olivia Zastrozzi was my mother j a woman in whom every virtue, every amiable and excellent quality, I firmly believe to have been centred* «* The father of him who by my arts committed suicide but six days ago in La Conte^a di Laurentini mansion, t$ok advantage of & moment of weak-

Four officials rushed in, and placed Zmtroz&i on the rack.

WlIEN Archdale arrived in Dublin, he lost all tiaces of the fugitives. He cuised lus piecipitatefligiit fıoııı the ruin, winch he could only account for as the sudden effect of despair, depriving him tul. in. a of

Archdale saw himself, in idea, shunned equ illy by the good and by the bad, he theiefoie deteimined to wnte to none of his former acijuaintame, till he could pioduce a clear proof of his innocence Γοι this purpose, he omitted no endeavours to pursue the fugitives Гог neu a fortnight bis eveiy euquiry was ν am, at length, passing by an obscure stieet, be heaid а man siy to anothei, while he was cloning а hoise— " Γοι my pait, 1 believe all is very safe, and the young folk luve got cledr off.

Archdale eagerly enquired whether hc would conduct him to the same place ; for this description left hiin no doubt as to thc identity of the objects of his pursuit. Thc man hesitated. He said lie wished to return to England ; but that if it were made worth his while, he would defer his voyage. Archdale offered a sum his cupidity could not resist. The man hired a couple of horses ; and after three days*, they arrived safe at Inniskilling. Archdale put up at a miserable inn, fearing to be discovered befoie the time.

so tliat the aiimids wcie exhausted, and scircely able to ciawl Archdale had got about six miles on his jouiney, when his sleed, which had long disregarded the application of the whip (spurs he had none), now went only on a slow foot-pace.

Archdale, icvived by the liquor which bad rendeied his companion speechless jud senseless, now deteunined upon gra¬ tifying Ins callosity. He cast an anxious look about the cabin.

He piepared himself for а sight of horror He seized the ci rtam—it tieinbled m his hand. At lengtii he drew it aside, while Ins heart beat as'though it vvould have buist its tenement.

" You know my pieddection for the stage My personating Archer* (however unqualified for the charactei) is no small proof of it I frequently joined mprwate theatricals ; and Mrs. Westerville, de¬ lighted at the applause I received, was the first to encourage my vanity. " Mrs Agnew s house was the receptacle of the best company in London Her fortune was immense, but bei character was such as only to be tolci ited bv the splendour ot het Jetes, and the brilliancy of her connections All the town flocked to her parties, and I was weak and blind enough to allow my wife to join the circle " The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet was announced as the third private theati icai Sir Lionel Glenham was the Borneo, and Miss Ormsby the Juliet, and ƒ was to personate Mercutio " About three weeks before the repre¬ sentation, Miss Ormsby was seized with
the
the small pox Mrs Agnew, who was more concerned at the failure of her thea¬ tricals than the young lady s illness, com¬ plained bitterly that no substitute could be found " I had frequently desired Mrs Wester¬ ville to hear me repeat my part, and the sweetness of tone with which she pro¬ nounced the speeches ot Romeo, induced me to promise, in an evil hour, that she should supply the place of Miss Ormsby " 1 hastened to Bedfoid Square, and informed Mrs Westeiville of my plan She at fiist believed me in jest, but ou my assuring her I was senous she ear¬ nestly entieated me to diop all thoughts of it, alledging her total mcxpeuence and incapacity " I could notbear the idea of postponing the amusement 1 had ıeceıved applause in the character of Mei cutio, and I vehe¬ mently implored hei to consent " Her ıeply was still the same She χ 5 said

" Al' the performers attended, and we wore our theatrical dresses. " Attei the rehearsal, I lianded Mrs. Agnew to an apartment, where a cold supper was provided. I had changed my diess, as the part of Mercutm is but short ; and I waited with some degree of impa¬ tience to behold my wite. " She appeared not I imagined she bad some pait ot her diess to change, and sat chatting with heedless vivacity, till summoned to take my seat at the supper table " I enquned for Mrs, Westerville.

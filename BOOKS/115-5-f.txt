Morningthorpe, slipping a five-pound note into his hand, obseivtd, the less was said respetting the matter the better, giving some additional oiders respecting supper The man was perfectly satished, and re¬ solved to stick to his original assertion, should any more inquines be stt on foot respecting the fugitive, w hile the friends, for suth each ftlt they were, joined the earl, who deckued himself extremely in¬ debted to them foi having nd him of such я fool, who muht h tve ptoved a serious torment to him but for then Ъаа inter¬ ference, giving so ludici ous an account of their first meeting, and of her anxiety to be mamed, that he succeeded to hi» wish m making the fnends laugh veiy heartily, as no man could render himself more amus¬ ing nor better company, when he chose to exert his talents for conversation He next reverted to sn Ношу ь recent purchase, speaking highly ш piaise of both house and grounds, declaring, if it had not been to oblige the countes-, he should not have sold the es ate, adding—" I tame to town piuposely to put the muslime, stioke

" And set my scars and weathor-benten phiz against his dingy complexion. I only hope, if she doe» so kindly overlook my want of beauty« that I shall prove more grateful than tlie Moor, and les« jealoujs df fairer men." " Why, you would not wish to make us believe, colonel," rejoined tlie earl, " that you fancy your scare have disfigured you : if you.nre studying for compliments, I-shah iWfjjr .tvou tt> your glass, or, if you. lUse iţ better, <o Miss Jfttømanrice."

AVe can meet at Mr Selby s cham¬ bers, oı wherever else you may choos to appoint The earl left the appointment to then pint fnend, the young lawver, remai king he was a trustee of lady W alhngford sand as such entitled to Ins particuLf consideia- tion " Positiv ely, he proceeded but foi these dinners, and these fetes, and draw mg- rooms.at vv Inch I must shew myself, I w ould
return to Clifton to morrow, since I airead? regret having left the countess behind me " " Had she accompanied your lordship to town, Margaretta might have been spared some fatigue, and you some expence ' " Very good, sir Henry I can take а joke, there may come a tune when I may retaliate." The com ersation next turned upon the late war, Ыс till Selby, not wishing to keep his servon ts up, retired, and sir Henry, pleading fatigue, immediately wished his lordslup a good repose The earl would not, how ever, suffei him to leave him till he had promised to break¬ fast with him at ten, as he should move his quarteis immediately after, again de diring himself much obliged to chance, lite, or destiny, for having led him into tl e Adelpln, and to his having trespassed upon his, sir Hem j s, apartments, since, but for their unexpected meeting, he should certtmly have been engaged in a duel w ith captain, if not with Mr Norns, had he been so unfortunate,he should merely have regretted the publicity such a method of
settling the'f disputes would have given to the business, though, if he had been rightly informed, captain Nome was considered as too peaceably inclined for his profession, Morningthorpe thd not affect to under¬ stand his allusion, agam reiterating his « ishes fot his lordship's repose, and having summoned the only servant who had ac¬ companied him to England, he took pos¬ session of a large excellent quiet bedroom which run over the drawing room he had 711st quitted As Harry (his servant's name) did not, m the remotest way, allude to the sort of bustle which had succeeded the eail s arrival, he hoped the waiter hod re¬ mained silent, and having verj' soon dis missed him, with oiders to call lum at nine, our soldier devoted some tune to reflec¬ tion eie he sought his couch, till feehng inclined to sleep, he recommended him¬ self to «Ef un who had so often presei ved hım 111 the houi of danger, and to whom he had early been taught to open Ins heart ■¡titen he was in trouble, and to retuin his thanks for the numerous benefit 4 he daily received at his hands This dut)
pèrfbrmed, he soon sunk into a prc-fuuiid repose, determined to leave the future to that Providence «vhich bad hitherto always proved his' safeguard! and increased his trust and Mh in Hihi to whom he looked up for every fiatine comfort The earl of WaUingford equally devot¬ ed some time to reflection, but his thoughts wete confined to this vrorld—indeedthey had never as yut soared to a better. He wished Margaretta raight succeed ín dup¬ ing her family, and formed some other plans which, were we to disclose, our readers would not consider him in the road to reformation ; it may therefore be as prudent to suffer them to remain in the dark. At the appointed hour our soldier made his appearance in his lordship's drawing- room, rather rejoicing at his intended re¬ moval, as he did not enjoy their being such immediate neighbours—The earl said he should send his valet to secure him otherapartinents, more in the vicinity of his friends, hinting he meant to visit soine of the great men in power that morning, to
tvliom he should give his rçal opinion of his guest who requited he ivrouid not take that trouble-; he merely wished his services to speak in his behalf', but not to owe any favour to even the most powerful recommendation. He should go first to the war-office, and then into Norfolk-street, hinting his wish that the earl would nei¬ ther give ear or publicity to the whispers he had mentioned the evening before, as he was .at preseht merely inclined to con¬ sider Miss Tntzmaurice as the daughter of one of his earliest and most respected friends, and she might consider him with even less favourable eyes. The earl spoke very judiciously and very seriously upon the subject of matri¬ mony ; and when sir Henry rose to take his leave, he made him promise to return to his hotel, if only for five minutes, be¬ fore he proceeded into Norfolk-street. Our soldier made no difficulty of qom- -plying with his wishes, setting out oa loot for tho war-office. Perhaps in no country in Europe tat ialents of any description better appseciat-
cd than in England Sir Henry's real ment had long been noticed by the ruling powers, his reception among these military men was therefore most flattering, his name was to be included in the first crea¬ tion of baronets, and he was, as the earl had foretold, required, nav pressed, to make his appearance at the city fete he should receiv e a proper card m due time and a gentleman lugli in office, to w hom he had bought a letter from lus idolized general, promised to call foi him at n pi oper hour He could be at no loss for costume, as re gimentaU would be the order of the day, therefore he was not permitted to put a negative upon the wishes of men who all declared themselves lusfrietulsand patrons In confoı mitv to his jiromise to the eail, he called at his hotel, where he found a note from hmi, expressing his hope of meet ing him at Guildhall as he understood ne would be properly invited and introduced, which had prevented him from seeking his own gratification, by requesting to convey him thither he had now taken up his abode in Albemajle street, where, for
an extra pnce, he was very well accom¬ modated, and vidiere he hoped to see sir II°nry whenever he could make it conve¬ nient This was all very w ell, thought our sol¬ dier, who having given hu servant, of whose superior intelligence he had long had convincing proofs, several necessary oiders respecting his appropriate costume for this fete, &c he proceeded into Nor¬ folk street, as he was very anxious to see colonel Titzmaunce, and not the less im¬ patient to be intioduced to his daughter, from the hints the earl had thrown out purposely to flatter Ins vanity
CHAPTER III
NrvER had Morningthorpe felt more agi¬ tated than when knocking at the door of his long-esteemed fnend —'Is colonel Fitz¬ maunce at home' he inquired, and strange to say, did not feel very mudi disappointed
when answered m the negative He left his card and address, and proceeded to Selby's chambers, w ho was really gneved the colonel should happen to bc from home, and who made -him promise to dine with lum the next day, he should merely ask the colonel and his family to give him the meeting, in addition to his father and mo¬ ther Our soldier readily agreed to his propo¬ sal, observing he toundhe must be presented toToynltv, having already been introduced at the French court, and he was a'ready ίη¬ ι ited to the much talked of evening fete, relating how the earl and he had parted, and hoping Alargarett ι had made good her enti с, as slie did not appear deficient in tunning, if she was in sense As Selby wished to read over the deeds of the Abbey estates.and many other papers of consequence, it was late ere sir Hemy returned to his hotel to dress for this grand dinner, when, to his great joy, he found colonel Fitzmaunce waiting his leturn m the front drawing room Having welcomed hnn as he would

cannot again 'lose sight of him for any length of time. Though his gallantry to¬ wards Margaretta had never got wind, he found himself but coolly received by those acquaintance whose esteem he coveted, who all expressed their surprise at his ha¬ ving left the countess at Clifton. Her being in bad health was not gene¬ rally believed, and he soon understood that she was pitied, and he was blamed, since rumour had pronounced her to be a most elegant accomplished woman, who had proved a most exemplary wife to a man much older than herself, but who had now unfortunately united herself to a decided libertine, who had evidently only married her, as he did his first countess, for her mo¬ ney, and who did not even keep up ap¬ pearances three months after marriage, and whom she would probably have to nurse in a few years more, when he would exhib't eveiy s 'r5 T1 °f a premature old age, and piove a peevish tyrannical husband. While in the heyday of youth, his fol¬ lies, or rather vices, had been either toler¬ ated or overlooked; his rank, profession,
and his marriage not having been one of inclination, were all alleged in excuse for his errors, but at five and fifty the world were no longer so lenient, and he found he must reform—at least in appearance, if he did not wish to be generally shunned Most thankful, therefore, did he feel that he had got nd of Margaretta, »hough he dreaded her ignorance rendenng his folly public, should chance ever throw her agam m his way, this he must endeavour to avoid, by never again visiting Charing Sir Henry Morningthorpe did not ap¬ pear inclined to court his intimaey, there¬ fore it was not likely they should ever be upon more than distant terms of civility— of course he should have no temptation to v ısıt the Abbey He must, however, pre- vail upon the countess to accompany him to London m the winter, or he should be shunned by all the moral part of the fa¬ shionable world she would do him credit —and could he induce her to do the ho¬ nours of his house, he should re establish himself in the general good opinion, and D 2
though, as a young man, he had but too often set the world and its censures at de¬ fiance, he did not feel so bold at his pre¬ sent age indeed he could not blind him¬ self to what must prove the consequence, were it 6uspectcd that he was lavishing the pioperty he had received from his wife upon mistresses of any denomination Al¬ ready, thanks to the malice of lord Dan vers, various inuendoes had appeared in the papers, all tending to lower him in the public estimation, he must there¬ fore make a merit of necessity, and has¬ ten the countess s promised visit mto Dor¬ setshire, where he resolved, by the most delicate and continued attention to her comforts, to induce hei to overtook Ins past slights, and to continue his minate V\ Ink they vvere upon good terms, the woild would not scrutinize his conduct, and he should dw lys have it m his power to punish loid D invers, by banishing lum his piesence and when he died, he woul ' take caie he should merely inherit the tit anil muntiti itt est ites thereunto annexed Sudi were his piudent, it not paternal
resolutions during the many homs he was doomed to spend alone, though I oudon was such а continued scene of bustle but he could not be always m public and lie sonn tired of following the royal visitors about, merely as a satellite m their suite Sn Henry had only left his end once m Albemarle street, as he was as much sought after as our peer ftlt himself nrg leetcd, who sometimes regretted he had not pursued tlie same mad to famt as lie knew the young harenet wis as much re spected for ins private virtues as fdr his military renow n and he w s no soldier ol fortune—he had long had it m his power to gratify ill his prnpen itiis therefore he was guided bv pi incipit not necessity But feeling sati ited with fetes and shews, and tned of appeanng in pul he on the same day our hero set out for Charing he lelt town for Dorsetshire resolved fo prepare every thing for the reception of the countess who he hoped would, in consequence of Ins constant entertaining letters, accompany him either to Brighton, AA cymouth, or any other watenng place
she might prefer, having resolved to be wholly guided by her wishes, and to en deavour, at least for a time, to find plea sure in her society And certainly his let ter to the countess, announcing his de parture from London, was exactly calcu lated to reinstate him in her good graces She hailed this shadow of reformation as hkely to be productive of much ultimate good—since were the earl merely to ap pear n moral man it would prove a very sufficient excuse foi her accepting of his hand He merely went one stage the first even ing and the next day being Sunday, he did not hurry himself, therefore did not reach Anmore House till nearly dusk in the evening As the resident household had merely been apprized of his coming by that morn ing's post they had been m no small bus tie to prepare for his reception, and he gave them to understand this was a mere flying visit, as he should not remain there any tune till he brought home the countess
the improvements that he hud thought it necessaiy to make vvere nearly com¬ pleted , and he hoped, when he walked over the house and grounds the next morning, th it all would be m readiness in arother month for his lady's reception Before we detail the excellent résolu tıons the earl continued to make, we must take а few retrograde steps, which we tear will make our readers doubt the stability of his reformation AVhen he secluded himself in Doiset shire, as a pıepaıatoıy step to either de¬ ceiving the late sir Herbei t into α belief that he was a reformed man, 01 to securing the hind of his widow, he had, while dtcency lestiained hnn from pushing Ins fortune with the latter, pour passer le temps, foimed a tender intimacy with a veiy fine young woman, which he fancied he had can led on so secretly, that till he read loid Danvers s kind letter to the countess, he flattered himseli no one ev en suspected the c« anexión , and vv e must ac know ledge, that the ν «count had merely heaid it nimoured, but never confai med —
he required no more to assert it as a known fact The gul in question was the daughtei of one of his tenants, whose beouty was not like Maigaretta s her sole merit as she was clever shrewd, and had received a de cent education She had long been in the habit ot frequently visitmg her aunt the wife о the he id g irdener and Ins lord ship had met hci while r imbhng about the plantations whci с she often strolled with two young children, particularly when her aunt was from home or was gone to Blundford market, when Mary generally came to keep house, and take care of the children lhe earl soon sought her acquimtance He was a widow er and great men have married faimers daugliteis therefore she did not repulse his advances indeed she soon displayed great talents for intrigue The children were too young to tell tales, and they soon contrived to correspond not only by letters, but by signals a certain bush, and a cei tam window, could have
told tales not much to the credit of either party Mary did not wnte a bad letter—the earl was amused by her very natural re¬ maiks, w hich to him had novelty to re¬ commend tìiem , and they soon either managed, or so contrived, that Mrs Min¬ ster seldom suffered two days to elapse without visiting Biandford, till rumour, " V\ Inch is r, j ipo, Bio π by sur ι ses je lousics, conjectures, ' became busy with Mary's name The farmer took the alarm, and resolved to watch his daughter, and certainly did sec the earl leaving Mr Minsters rural abode, which vvas delightfully situated just without the park—" What of that?' he mentally exclaimed, that was no proof of his daughtei ь levity, and the world was so censorious, it was hard judging any body, and were he to take any notice of such mere gossips' tales, he might be warn¬ ed out of а good, easy-rented fai in, and he had a Large family, therefore why shoukl D3
they suffer, admitting Mary had been im¬ prudent? Thus reasoned the good man, and in consequence kept his own council but w hen Mrs Minster sent as usual for Ma¬ ry to take care of the children m her ab¬ sence, he sent her younger sister in her stead, finding full employment for Mary at home The earl took the alarm, and for some time they contented themselves with breathing their sighs and fears upon papei —till, hoping they had lulled the old Ar¬ gus to sleep, they made other and more prudent arrangements When chance led Mary's elder brother а road where he caught sight of her hastening towards a private dooi, leading into the park, more than a mile from the great house, or his aunts cottage, as she let herself in, and the door g tve way the moment she un¬ locked it, John was convinced that she had a key in her possession, that the door had been previously unbolted with side, and that she was certainly an expected vi¬ sitor He therefoie remained peidnc, till
he saw her come out again, m out half an hour relock the gate, and set tifas hard as she could run towards home John who hoped to succeed his father m the farm, w as no inore inclined to make mischief, merely endeavouring, by indirect means, to discover wlnthei they supposed, at home, his sister had been gone, when he learnt that she had been sent in lhe exact opposite direction, which was a con vincing proof that all was not right He had also heard a few whispers and if she had s lover »t the great house, he con ceived he had best be silent at least till he could burg the matter home to her, since to make a stir before he was at any cer¬ tainty, would only render the earl his ene my, if nothing worse befell him still he resolved to keep a strict watch over Miss, as he had no wish to see her his lordship s mistress, and he could not suppose she would ever be his wife A few mornings afterwards he remarked that she was unusually smart, which ied hım to ask whether she v« as going out '
Yes, she was going to Biandford for her mother Hather doubting her assertion, he hur¬ ried off, and took his station where he could see whether she crossed the park for the neai est, though it was, in fact, a mile about, and, as he expected, he saw her enter by the same door Hcndered more tunous than ever, he made shift to get over the wall, at no great distance from where she went m, and found himself in a shrubbery, or plantation, in the midst of which was a rustic building, winch had probably been devoted to pur¬ poses of contemplation by the earl s father, as it was very retired, and almost conceal¬ ed by the embowering shrubs among which it stood He found no difficulty id concealing him- self, and soon saw the earl and his sistei m deep discourse, slowly advancing to wards this same retreat, where they re- mamed some time, when they retraced their steps to the pnvate door, which the earl unlotked, going forward to recon¬ noitre , when, presuming all was safe, lh<
j oung lady took her leave, setting off up on the full run towards Biandford John being thus fully enlightened, if not satisfied, returned as he came and vv cnt to his work, resolving Mary should not long go untold of the discovery he had made he therefore seized the first oppor tuiuty to tell her his mind, pointing out to her what would indubitably be the conse quenct, if she repeated her visits to the hermitage At first she endeavoured to persuade him his eyes had deceived him, and final¬ ly, she assured him he had mistaken my hids valet for my lord lumself, acknow lodging that Mr Л 7 апе was anxious to mairy her, and merely withheld by pru dentnl motives from making his intentions known to her father—telling a sufficient plausible tale to induce her brother (who thought it v ery possible the intrigue might end m her marrying Vane) to promise to keep her secret, on condition she never went a courting again, if she did, he should thmk himself at hbertv to put а spoke in her w heel
Hoping he had put her upon her guard, he ceased to watch her motions, well con¬ vinced, that if she was bent npon going wrong, nothing would prevent her, w hen, to his great joy, the earl left Dorset¬ shire, and finally married lady Chai leville, which must, he conduded, put an absolute conclusion to the connexion, though, if he had not had ocular proof of his sister s im¬ prudence before, her looks and remarks, when she learnt the earfs mainage, would have convinced him uho it was she was m the habit of meeting at the hermitage, as she grew melancholy, pale, and sad, ap¬ pearing not at all prepared for this open de¬ fection of her titled lover Her father could only grieve for her fol¬ ly , but not supposing his son had made any discovenes to her disadvantage, he kept his suspicions to himself, telling his wife, when she was lamenting Mary's vv ant of spints and appetite, that if she did not soon get better, he would send her from home, for change of air, while John be¬ gan seriously to apprehend some very unpleasant consequences would ensue from
her visits to the hermitage, but as he was really very fond of the imprudent girl, he resolved to come to a proper explanation with her, that they might concert mea¬ sures to preserve her reputation The earl would, of course, not be sparing of hush money, now he was marned, though he could haidly bear the idea of applying, upon such an occasion, to this very unprincipled man, for whom he now felt a degree of hatred, often wishing he knew how to revenge the affront he had put upon his family, since he was a sort of general lover, as more than one hand¬ some girl had, it was suspected, reason to rue his seclusion in Dorsetshire—one in particular was known to have a living proof of her folly, in having listened to a libertine But as John was rather puzzled how to broach so distressing a subject to his sister, to his great joy she recovered both her spirits and appetite, and he hoped, as did his father, thut he had taken ahum prematurely, and that all would end in mere smoke, when, to his no great joj , he heard, on the Sunday, that the earl was
expected that evening, and that he was coming alone, to prepare for the reception of the countess, of whom repoi t had spoken so very fav ourably, that all the neighbour¬ hood looked forward with hope and expec¬ tation to her arrival, as she vv as known to be very rich, was said to be very charitable, and they made no doubt of lier doing а great deal of good, which never entered the earl's head, as he had no money to dis¬ tribute in mere chanty, and never sought popularity by such old-fashioned, exploded means His expected arnval was mentioned at the farmer s as a matter of mere indiffer¬ ence, the neighbour who broached the subject merely observing—" When he bnngs the countess, I may, out of respect to her, give them the meeting, but as foi lum, I would not step over my threshold to do him a pleasure, except I could, by so doing, serve myself' " He is our landlord,' rejoined farmer Weatherby, " and, as times go, not a bad one, and, in my opinion, the less we say about such great men the better We shall
not induce him to mend, and we may make bun our enemy ' " A r cry true, neighbour, let every tub stand upon its own bottom—ev cry one lor themselv es, and God for us all, so let ns di ink the countess's health m a mug of cidtr " This was done—John never losing sight of Mary, who seemed so httle surprised, and so much upon her guard, that he fe ir cd she had been apprized, though how he could not fathom, of the carl's being ex¬ pected in Dorsetshire Bc tint as it might, he resolved to keep а stricter look out than ever, since, were she now to renew her connexion with his loidsiup, he should deem her more guilty, and much more in excusabk, thm while he remained avvi dow er
CHAPTER VI
On the Monday Mary appeared to her ob servant brother unusually restless, she olten consulted the clock, ate little or no dinner, and gave evident proof of being very ill at ease John was purposely at work in the homcstall, and kept a good look out foi the earl, who, he made no doubt, would call in the course of the afternoon and os he supposed he would come on foot, he mode no doubt of his taking the road thiough the private door, since th it p ith was both pleasant and pnvate The farmer, who also had his suspicions, told his family he should not go fumi home, m case the earl called, as lie gene rally did aftei any absence besides, he wished to speak to him respecting tht к pairs of the gieat bain Mary made no remarks, but did not
seem to approve of his intention, and John, who had placed himself w here he com mended a view of the house, saw her fre¬ quently at one or other of the windows, and evidently upon the watch Between two and three, as the least hke ly hour to meet either the farmer or his sons at home, John caught sight of the carl, w ho was slow ly approaching the house T he old man had dropped asleep ui his elbow chair, but Mary, who had dressed sooner than usual, and had taken more than usuil pains, was m readiness to receive him John, to appearance by accident, gave the call the meeting in the garden leadrng to the front door His lordship addressed hnn with kind familiarity, mquning after tlie family, who having heard then land loid s voice came out to welcome his ie t in The dame having woke her husband, and called Maiy and Susan to come and speak to my lord, who w ıs, as usual, re quested to walk in, and rest himself, to which he made no objection, agreeing it
w as very warm and readily accepting the dame s offer of n j,fass of cider, who sent Mary for the grateful beverage, as being more handy than Susan Alary s confusion was very visible when she returned with the liquor her h nd shook and she looked everywhere but at her perjured lover who rather encouraged by these proofs of her love made some po lite allusions to her beauty declaring as he returned the ¡,1 iss th it cider w as his favourite hey enge and ne did not know how Mrs W citherby managed but hers was always better than any he met with elsew here lhe dame who hke the renowned Mrs Trmirose m Goldsmith s A r icar of \\ ake field was ev er ready to m i,rnify the merits of hei daughters dedal ed Marj was her riLjht hand she always sujiciintendcd the making of the udei yes though she said it that should not say it her dau Ji ters would make excellent managers and excellent wives The earl followed up the suh|ccl with so many indirect praises of Alary, and un
plied wishes that he had been permitted to thoose such a wile, the farmer thought it necessary to put both hnn and the love sick girl upon thtir guard, by in quirmg wlien they were to have the pleisuie ot seeing the countess at Anmore House' During the autumn, I hope, my good ' fuend she is a most excellent woman | Oui s w as not a lov e match bhe had long known me, is I was the direct hen to her late husband who she thou 0 ht, had ι ot done mc justice thcictoi с she ¡,ολ e me to 1 under- and no m ittei how, you 1 now, that I η i 0 ht if I chose still slicceid to his estates I was advised to take advantage of her \ repossession hut I was very can did w ith liti —hypoci isy nev cr vv is iniong mj failings but 1 make no doubt we shall bc aven comfoitable couple, though wc vv ere neither of us actuated by lov с 1 lic countess ıs now at Clifton—I cime dire« t from town and very j^lad I vv ıs t > get out of the bustle Indeed, 1 ain v « iy much .it tached to Dorsetshire I was boni in this county, and it has always, in my eyes, had
many attractions particularly of late To oblige me, the countess has disposed of a finer seat m Hampshire, since, with my own good will, I would spend my days at Anmore," glancing towards Mary Then approaching a window—" The prospects are very fine hereabouts, and I particular¬ ly enjoy a ramble by moonlight, which will be still more gratifying, from my having been cooped up in London at this season " The farmer assented to the remark, sending Mary to look for his tobacco box, which he thought he had left in the or chard When she was gone, the earl paid the good woman some very judicious compii ments upon her children, her management, dairy knowledge, ice. which so opened her heart, that just as he was rising to take his leave, Mary returned, to assure her father she had hunted everywhere in vain for his box " Well, never mind, girl, it an't brittle perhaps I dropped it in the field " Hie lordship loitered a few minutes, and
atlastrehlcmntlyd*partedj biithdťberore I he had contrived to convey a billet tò the 1 imprudent Mary, unperceived by her watchful father, in which he requested her to steal out, 1 when the family were retired, and give him the meeting at a stile he mentioned, from whence they might pro¬ ceed to the hermitage, as he had much to say to her, and many plans to arrange. Mary was no fool ; but she had already gone such lengths, that it was necessary she should have a private conference with her seducer. She had heard he was expected at Anmore from an inferior servant, which had put her upon her guard ; and she at¬ tributed his coming into Dorsetshire solely to his wish to see her, vanity having taught her to believe he had not married for love; at all events, she was so situated, she could not refuse to give him the meeting, therefore laid her plans accordingly. Now John, cautious as the earl lmd been, thought he had seen him slide a paper into a lavender bush, near which Mary was standing ; and he was so situated, having gone forward to open the gate, that he
could not return till she had doubtless se¬ cured the prize, and as he liad heard his lordship mention his moonlight rambles, he suspected that Mary would steal out to join him, she slept alone, and she could easily get out of the house Well, if she was so abandoned, he was resolved to fol¬ low her, but he could not suppose she would be so imprudent It was a standing rule for every light in tlie house to be extinguished when the dock m the hall stiuek ten therefore John knew he should not bc long kept in suspense, he therefore placed himself at his chamber window, from whence he could see any one who cither left the house, or proceeded along the path leading towards the park His second biother, who was his bedfel¬ low, asked what he sat there for He would tell him, if his suspicions were veri¬ fied, he rephed, desiring lum to hold his tongue, as it was of the utmost conse¬ quence their remaining sdent William did pot repeat his question, but
continued watching him, till John, start¬ ing from his seat, exclaimed—'* The wan¬ ton jade ' I must have seen lier to have believed it" " What do you mean ?" " If you will swear never to reveal our shame, I will let you into the secret" " I am ready to swear I will never di¬ vulge join- secret' No, as God is my judge, I wUl never repeat what you may tell mc, though I do not understand what you mean by our shame John bnefly related when and how he had discovered that Mary intrigued with the earl, entering mto various details, con¬ cluding by telling hun, that as he had ful¬ ly suspected, she was now gone, supposing them all а bed and asleep, to meet him, as he had seen her t ike the path leading to the park AVilham, who was extremely passionate and very hasty, and had neither the )udg- ment nor prudence of John, swore he should not mind shooting the titled rogue who had ruined then· sister—nay, for a får- VOL v E
thmg, he would do his business—a sculk- mg rascal " And so put 5 our own life in jeopardy, because Mary has acted like a fool? She is as much, nay more to blame than the earl, forgiving him the meeting, therefoie I should like to frighten her, and to give my lord a sound thrashing—that he deserves, so, if you have а mind to join me, w e w ill disguise omselves, and give them a surfeit of these nocturnal meetings ' Starting out of bed, William began to dress himself, swearing he would make the gentleman repent having such freaks at his age, and just married, he must be a rogue in gram towards both the countess and his silly sister however, as he was a dab at singlestick, he made no doubt of giving ¡nm a bellyful " I have no objection to your doing that," replied the brother, who, with innate British courage, swore, bad as he w as, he should not like to take any unfair advan¬ tage of the earl He would take two cud¬ gels, one of which he would give lum,
that he might defend himself—then, were he even to knock him on the head, he could not be deemed his murderer " No, no, that would only be man¬ slaughter and, our provocation consider cd, I think we should have nothing to lear, so, if jou get the worst of it, I will take him in hand for, rat me if I will not gıy e hım enough ' Hav ing thus decided, the brothers stole dow n stairs, whert they disguised them selves m then waggoneis frocks, after blacking their hands and laces with grease and soot when wrapping haybands round thur hats, thej seized their cudgels, and set out in pursuit of their imprudent sister, w ho eould hav e written instead of meeting her deceitful lover So much time had elapsed since her de¬ parture from home, that Mary had reach¬ ed the park, nay the hermitage, before they came to the pnvate door which stood ajar —of course she had either gone forward to the house or had stopped short at the re treat in the wood and it was reasonable E 3
to suppose she meant to return by the same road. They listened forsorne time, and at last silently and cautiously entered the park, -and took the path leading to the hermit- age, having previously agreed never to open their mouths, let what would befall them, as Mary would certainly know their voices ; softly, therefore, did they steal to¬ wards the back of the hermitage, where they again paused to listep, hearing voices from within ; and soon they distinctly heard the earl say—" Take one more glass, my love, it will do you good, the night air is raw." John required no further proof; he there¬ fore made a signal to retreat, as the moon shone so full upon the front of the build- - ing, he thought they ran too great α risk of being recognized, and as the private door had been left open, there could be no doubt of their returning by that road; they therefore fixed upon a gloomy spot, just within the park, where the shrubs be¬ ing thick and lofty, a thousand people might have passed without seeing them.
There was a sort of opening adjoining their hiding place, through which, by dart¬ ing forward, they could instantly gam the pith AVilham brandished his cudgel, whis¬ pering, he could not have made use of a longer weapon to advantage among the trees and boughs, whith nearly dosed over the road He was to begin the attack, John resolv¬ ing to remain quiet, uid merely to como fnivvard in case of his being ovcipoweied, not supposing that could prov e the case, even admitting my lord was nmed, except indeed he should luv с pistols about lum Midnight it ΙαΛ struck upon the clock over the s«pbles belonging to the great house, and soon alter tliej heaid steps ad vanemg 'lhe eail and Maiy weie convcising in а low ν oice, and 1 iv in„ plans ioi anolhci ín- teiview, when, nt the moment they éress¬ ed the opening William darted foi wai d, in such haste, that his foot having sti иск ugunst the stump of a tree, he in a man¬ ner felt headlong mto the path, and be-

sequence of their having sought such a mode ot revenge, John hastily pulled the door after him, telling William—" We must if possible, reach home first, though we must not take the direct road, инее, if Mary arnves before us, she will fasten the house door," which they had found upon the latch when they left home, " and should it be known, or even suspected we have been out, we shall meet with no mer¬ cy from his lordship " William agreed to the truth of all he said , while ι mining forwards, each every now and then pulling up α handful of grass, with which they endeavoured to wipe the grease and soot from their hands and face Quite out of breath, and unable to utter a word, they had the good fortune to pre¬ cede then- wretched sister home, and to icach their own room without disturbing any one And w ell it was they had made such haste, as John, who remained upon the watch, had scarcely taken his station, ere he discerned Marj tiying to shade herself from the vv uidows, as she hurried up the
path, dreading what might have befallen her lover, ,ince she felt assured it was no common robber who had attacked him at snch a time of nicht, and in such a place, it must have been some one w ho had been upon tht watch for him, and who could that be but samoli-unti of hers? 'lhccul had certainly sud something when he struck AVillnm, but she had hien too fnghtened either to undci stand him or to take any notice of either the figure or «hess of the disturber of their tite à téle , still she could not help suspecting it must have been John, and she w ould h i\ e given no trifle to hav с been at a certainty yet she dared not frame my excuse for entering Ins room at such an houi. w hich must eflfectu-- aUy proclaim hei own imprudence, should the affair ever become public She could not, however, forbear listening is she ρ iss- ed her bı othtı s ıoonı dooi, m her way to hei own John had guessed upon whom hei sus¬ picions would lall, therefore had, as well as William, got mto bed, that, in the event of her coming in, she might be so f ir mis-

any questions nor to betray any knowledge of tho circumstance, v hen, as must prove the case, his lordship's accident was made public John felt the least satisfied of the two and, now it was too late, sincerely wished he had kept William in the dark, not that he did not think the earl deserving of chas tisement, but he was afraid it had far ex¬ ceeded his offence They met the family as usual at break¬ fast, gave in their report respecting what they had done, and did not affect to notice Mary's heavy eyes, which she attributed to a headache—her father to a heartache—the brothers to her fears for her lover, indeed, self preservation enabled them to play their parts so well, even Mary became their dupe, and was moie than ever at а loss to guess who could have way-laid the earl some secret enemy, of course, who might have the same reasons for seeking revenge her brothers might hive alleged m excuse, had they been concerned m tli p business
CHAPTER VH Thf brothers were separated during the forenoon, but met ogam at dinner, each wondering their nocturnal adventure had not transpired, which led them to hope the earl must have recovered his senses, and gone home, they therefore trusted the bu¬ siness would blow over, as he would pro¬ bably keep his own counsel, and Mary dared not revert to the scene This John was telling William, as they were returning towards the fields in the af¬ ternoon, when a surgeon of Biandford, w ho attended the family, rode past thein, lem- mg in his hoise, he mquired after the far¬ mer and his dame, and Mary ш particular, rejoicing she was so well recovered John made a suitable reply—asking whether any one was ill in the village 3 " Old Parkinson has had a bad fall, and I am going to examine his hurts I sup

senting an injury, and though I never en¬ tertained any regard for his lordship, I «hall be seriously grieved should the blow prove fatal I onlj hope the wretdi who gave it will pay the full penalty of his wiokcd intention ' " I fully join m that wish, ' rephed the baronet, secretly resolving to spare neither pains nor expence to discover whether the Nomses were at all concerned m the busi¬ ness though he could not inention his in¬ tentions to the colonel, w lio soon took his leave, desiring our soldier would not make it late who was no sooner left alone, than summoning Harry, he desired hnn to en¬ deavour to learn whether Mr Norns was at home, and whether he had been lately absent, giving him а plausible reason for his cunosity, and recommending secrecy He then sat down to answer Sclby s letter, to whom he openly avowed similar suspi¬ cions to those he entertained, declaring, that he should not mind expending ,i thou sand pounds, to bring either the father or son to justice, if they were concerned in the busuiess.
Harry, who had he lived with the earl, might have proved a very able auxiliary m his waked plans, was as zealous m the cause of vii tue in the service of sir Henry, whose slightest wishes he considered as laws therefore when he appeared to assist hini to dress he assured bun that Mr Nor¬ ns h id been confined to the house for the last week with a spi lined nicle, and that he seldom or ever received anj leiters, nnd still less companv as no one seemed to considei hnn in the village Sn Henry Iclt more satisfied, as he now reverted to the approaching introduction which nullit decide his lutine 1 ite w с shall not dwell upon his resolutions, doubts, and feais since the no less agitated Anna «Iemands our attention She had been shocked by the earl s supp «sod danger, and peifectly of opinion that his misfortune 01 filiated in some pnvate quancloi pn vate pique and had ladv A« alhngfoid ex pressed а wish to see her, anxious as sht filt to see and com eise with su Henry Alonungthorpe, she would have answered vol ν ι
her letter in person, but the countess was too pmdent to invite her to meet lord Danvers, and not so selfish as to vv ish her to visit Dorsetshire at such a penod Anna vv as not v ain , she knew she was handsome, and she certainly spent more time at her toilet this morning tlian usual, and j et left it less satisfied than she was in general Eh¿a declared she had resolved to eclipse her, which was very cruel, considenng her avowed opinion of the expected hero, pro¬ posing a w alk m the shrubbery, that they might not appear to lie sitting in foim to ıeceıve this great man " AATio will, I dare say, overlook us both,' replied the laughing Anna, " since I consider his visit as paid to my father, and to have no reference to either of us, the fi icndship vv hich united them may not, on the part of sir Hem j, extend to me ' " Still less to me, but I dare say he is cunous to see what sort of beings we are, though 1 am afraid my uncle has not ex¬ tolled our beauty, dwelt upon oui siu- prising talents, or set us at all off to ad

Ann ι had never before felt either aw к w aril or at a loss, but when she laised hei cy es to look at this renowned hero, she le¬ gai ded hım with peculiar earnestness till lier colour all forsook her cheeks, and as suddenly returned, owing to the effort she nnde to recover her self possession, upon perceiving that sir Hemy partici patcd in hei feelings Hei gipsey hat ia ther prcv ented her father from remarking her agitation, winch she instantly attnbut ed to liei having ev er connected the idea of sir Henry with her father s danger, which he (the colonel) had so accui ately described, that at the moment of meeting the bai onet she had seen hım m imagination wounded ind lyuig at his horse s feet " A on may therefore suppose, sir Hen¬ rj, how much I consider myself your debtor, since but foi you I must have been an oiphati, and probably should have con tinued a dependent upon my beloved lady Walhngford Ром have heaid how I w is rescued from want and misery, and by whom, and much as I revere the memory
of my youthful benefactor, I consider mv¬ self as still more obliged to j ou " Morningthorpe made a very suitable re¬ ply, and each appeared to have recovered irom the momentary embat rassment they had expenenced when presented to each other The colonel attributed then emotion to Anna's knowing, and the buonct's having guessed his wishes, he therefoie led to more indifferent subjects, but Anna reverted to the elegant pı esen ts sir Hemy had sent liei, declanng that she had been extreme¬ ly mortified liei illness had prevented her fiom displajmg them at the fetes in Lon¬ don Eliza obs« ved liei hhts had excited ge¬ neial iidmiiation at the opera, asking sir Henry many questions respecting France and Spain, wishing to give him time to tally his spirits, as she felt convinced that hei cousin and he hid met befoie, when 01 where she could not conceive, since she had always appeared to considei the baio net as a total sti anger, nnd as she seemed
to wish to treat him is such, she followed her lead Charing, its cm n om and sotietv vvere next discussed, Anna bearing her part in the conversation w ith her usual gaiety and spirit The dinner displav etl the hospita hty of the colonel, and the elegance of his daughters taste, who did the honoms with infinite grice and pleasantry, and when the ladies weie withdiann, sir Henry spoke of Miss Fitzmaunce in such flattei ing terms, the colonel was quite delighted, dwelling upon her grateful regard for lady Walhngford, and adding—" Your having pieserved my life lias been a great passport to her favour, she respects you as my fnend, and considers you as having laid her under a very great obligation Sir Henrys reply was very gratifying to our veteran s feelings, since it bespoke his esteem for his daughter, and he would not have approved of love at first sight on either side 'f hey soon joined the ladies m the h brary, whither they had adjou ned, as the cooler room Sir Henry admired the ar
rangement of the books and the disposal of the musical instruments " My house is a mere box when com pared to the Abbey, but it is as large as I could wish, and I have rendered it а very comfortable abode, replied the colonel, while Anna du ceted the baronets notice towards the bciutiful prints annexed to the quarto edition of Lalla Rookh, which 1 iy upon a reading table, and while he was turning them over, and Eh/a was looking over some new muşu, she placed another book under his hand, while she turned towards her father, who was look ing in а portfolio for an Indian print Hei imperceptible sign had been noticed by our soldier, who in conspquence opened the volume she had placed before him it contained several plays, the first of which w os The Wonder, or a Woman keeps a Se eret He closed the book, perfectly satis bed, and much pleased by her ingenuity, at the moment the colonel called him to admire the view he had been seeking Music concluded the evening and never lind our soldier been more gratified They
separated at a late hour, but not before the colonel had agreed to bring the young la¬ dies to take their tea at the Abbey the fol¬ lowing evening AVhen the cousins were retired for the night, and had dismissed their attendants, Eh/a asked Anna whcthi r sn Henry h id answered her expectations ' had her de¬ scription of hnn Riveli her any idea of his person ' " I can hardly tell, since, to be veiy candid with you, he reminded me of α person long since dead, which gave mo such a shock, I w as never more at a loss to conceal my feelings, and as he certainly saw my surprise, I am sure I acquitted myself most awkwardly " " By no means I perceived your con¬ fusion, which jou hav e now perfectly ac¬ counted for but is not he η very fine fel low? does not he look the vci y heiohe has pioved himself 0 ' " His appearance is veiy much in his favoui How old should you suppose him tobe'' " About five and thirty, which is past
the age to look for admiration but he is exactly formed to captivate, his eyes are alone sufficient to give animation to any countenance, and 1 never saw finer teeth The Indian and Spanish climates, and his late campaign, have thrown an interesting shade over his features, which is to me singularly prepossessing ' " How much he would be flattered w ere he acquainted with your predilection m his favour ' " Not he, beheve me—he wíl' look much higher when he marnes , and were I in love with him, I should not give such free loose to my tongue, so good mght, and pleasant dreams " Anna returned the compliment, and Lliza soon fell into a profound sleep Hei companion now gave a free loose to her imagination, and we shall not foi the present enter mto any explanation le¬ specting hei feelings, wh ch were indeed of so contradictory a nature, she would, had she been so requued, have been heiself puzzled to define then f3
CHAPTER IX Thi papers of the next day merely con¬ tained α lew allusions to the earl s accident, respecting the cause of which the same mystery prevailed, but Anna received a rather longer letter fiom the countess,who merely recapitulated what my lord chose to tell her, and ν Ίο did not seem to sup¬ pose him m any present danger, request¬ ing Anna would write by evei y post, as she felt particuiai ly anxious to hear her opinion of sir Henry Alorningthorpe, of whom the earl now spoke in the highest terms Our heroine ente ~d mto various details in reply, and did ample piştice to the ba¬ ronet, of whom she spoke as of a beloved brother, acknowledging that she had heard so much of him, and considered herself as so greatly obliged to him, she had never felt more awkward than when introducid
to him, owing to her fears of not appear ing sufficiently grateful for the many fa¬ vours he had conferred upon her she shewed both the countess s letter and her answer to the colonel, who hoped, as the carl had been able to frank his hdy s let ter, he was not so great a sufferer as re jort had made him out llus he told the baronet when he ac compp ied his daughter and niece to the Ahoey, who were received as his best fnends by its owner who consulted the young ladies respecting some of his pro posed improvements and was happy to find that their opinions in general com cided with his own Anna presided at the tea table, and his ν ilet who made eveiy thing light to his fellow servants by his zeal to sen e his mas ter, and ot whom it mij,ht with truth be said— Ha jvrasrcnlj eelccnldl s η« ^ i hou e l I с с II I lino 1 sr Hr, j с ne waited at tea with a dextenty all his own λ\ hen he had removed the things Anna

med me over m that capacity, and who had belonged to my predecessor, I had been obliged to disiharge for idleness and insolence Hairv was now my fac-totum, vet did not relinquish his post as a soldier, hav ing a real will to distinguish himself, therefore he has alwaj s fought by my side, since he was superstitious enough to fancy that if he was but near mc, no d inger could befall me, or nt least that he should be iccessarv in wauling it off Manj a 1 mgh have I hod with iny brother-offtccis respecting this warm hearted fellow, who is considerably my junior, but really а model of prudence I would have pro¬ moted him to a halbert, but he declined the offer, I therefore promised, w henev er there was a peace, to procure his discharge, and continue him about my person I have kept my word, and now, with ins own good will, he would do halt the work ol the house ' " I can only say vou have been very fortunate m having secured such a pnze," replied the colonel, " since he is no com-
mon character, I wonder how he came to enlist " " I am of opinion there is a sort of mys¬ tery attached to his birth and connexions," rejoined the baronet " I once, by chance, asked him in what county he was bom he seemed confused, and declared he hard¬ ly knew I did not persist in the mquny, and I have never again led to the subject, as he may have cogent reasons for Ins si¬ lence " " Undoubtedly," said Anna, " 1 hope I should have been «?qnally guarded had I been m your place, sir Henry, since it would have been cruel to have extorted his confidence , indeed, w hat right can any one hive to oblige another to reveal what they wish should iernam secret, the Inqui¬ sition alone ought to a «sume that pow er ' " And as he escaped falling into their hands,' gaily resumed sn Henry, " his se¬ ciet (if any there is) remains in his own keeping, though he might have 1 1 usted to my honour " " I can believe you, sir Henry,' rejoin¬ ed Anna, in the same tone, " since, to re-
veal a secret that either choice, chance, or opportunity has placed m our keeping is base indeed Colonel Pitzmaunce was lather surpns ed at the tuin the conveisation had taken, and could not help f incying though he blamed himself the next minute for enter taming such an idea, that the b ironet and his daughter meant more by their speeches than met his ear, since to w hat could they either of them allude, oi how could such comparative strangeis undeistand each other? Sir Henry had been educated, nay, born in bngland therefore there was a possibility he nullit have seen Anna dur mg heı residence at Kingston but she was then too much of a child for anj inti macj to have subsisted between them but as he had heard that as а youth sir Henry had been rather wild, thuc was a possıbı litj she might have been acquainted w itn some of his boyish pianks, which might not redound to his honour, and which she had thus tacitly engaged never to mention This was the most likely conjecture he could fonn, though upon mature consi¬ deration he could not suppose they it
tached any meaning to the speeches which had awakened his attention Music suc¬ ceeded tea, and the evening passed away so rapidly, the party vvere astonished when supper was brought in Dunng the meal the conversation was very general As the table was cleanng, the discourse turned upon lobbenes, which were generally more frequent after а war the servants had all withdrawn except Han j, who was pi icing the wine, ilte upon the table, when Anna reverted to the attempt which had been formerly made to rob the Abbey, bestow ing the greatest encomiums upon Han i/ Peiiibi ohe, whose courage and presence of mmd had effectu¬ ally prevented the depredators fiom suc¬ ceeding " What time of the year was the at¬ tempt made ? ' asked the colonel " Sometime in the spring, su —I cannot recollect the exact day, I was m London with sir Herbert mid lady Charleville " " It was on the tenth of May, madam, the first evening of the Southampton fair," said Harry
I very eye was turned upon the speaker, and eveiy coimtennice was expressive of surpnsc At last Anna, sjieuking to the now dreadfully confused Hai rv , said— ' I believe jou are peiiectly correct but how nine vou to he acquainted with the tır iiimstance' You must havebem a mere child at the time " I tertamly was, madam but no one Ins more reason to remembi r that night My poor mother often used to siy tliat ι fool s bolt was soon shot, and I have ven fled her saj ing she h ıs often turned such silly people » folly to her advantage, though she was in tht mam a very good woman hut as I have extitcd j ours and my master s curiosity, madam, I am resolved to make in open confession, since, though I maj bc ikspised foi mv ont,m, it will afford me the pleasure of expressing mv gratitude to wards jou both appealing unable to re sfl un his teais, a« the past rushed to his recollection ' laketimetoiccovervoiuself Harry, said his kind mastil ' Miss riUmaunce will excuse join entering upon your (I

i-urt : need I add that I am the boy whom sir Herbert Charleville then took under his protection ? He sent me to school, and pro¬ vided for me much above my station, since my father, as you know, madam, was only a travelling gipsey tinker, and my good mother a fortuneteller of the samo tribe ; yet you, madam, did not despise their wretched offspring, since I, as well as my deceased sister, have received many a pre¬ sent fioin your hands." "Good Heavens! can you be the Harry Hawkins to whom sir Herbert had taken such a liking? You have often heard me relate the misfortunes ot' his parents,- my dear father. His mother I always consi¬ dered as i.iueh more to be pitied than blamed.. But, Harry, how came you to render all your benefactor's plans abortive, hy running away from school just as he was going to bind you to a trade? As you knew the late Mr. Pembroke, sir Henry, you may have heard him mention some of the circumstances connected with Harry's parents, as he proved himself а sincere friend of the poor woman's."
Sır Henry bowed assent to hor sııppos tion, desiring Harry would inform hb early benefactress how he came to enlist " Why, shame, madam, in the first in ¡.tnnce, and a wish to conceal the bast nes» of my ongin Had my parents merely betn poor, I should h ive gloried in work¬ ing for them while thev required my aid, but to acknovv ledge mvsell the son of а know n housobre iker, w ho had come to his death through his own desperation, and ol n mother who hid been transported lor a similar crime—I lould not do it, suite I could not suppose that any honest person would place anj confidence m the child of such paicnts, as л erv lew people, like Mi Pembioke, и hose memory I am bound to ieveie,and sn Heibul Chai 1ем11е, to whom I am still more indebted, would make allow¬ ances for my pooi inothei's temptation and situation when she did violate the laws ol her country My sistei died, as I need not tell you, madam, and just as I had íe- sol\ed to seek my fortune, and to conceal my bnth, a reciuiting paity, belonging to the regiment now commanded b) my ho-

Such was the situation of affairs at An¬ more House and the environs when sir Henry and Mr Selby arrived The earl had appeared veiy impatient and very anxious as the time drew near, when, ac cording to his calculations, he expected at least to see the latter, he was therefore the first to exclaim, when he heard the approach of the carnage—·' Surely that is Selby ? he ought to have been here hours ago, except he has brought sir Henry ' The countess went to a window, and was happy to inform hnn the baronet was sighting with his friend " Then let me see them immediately, I have much to say to both, particularly to sir Henry You must leave us together, and give orders that we may not be inter rupted ' Her ladyship, though surprised at his earnestness, and at his acknowledging he had so much to say to the baronet, made no remarks, but left the room in search of the visitors who had been received very stiffly by lord Danvers, he really could not sa-
tisfy them respecting the earls situation, as he was forbidden to enter his loom hdy AVallmglord took a great deal upon herself—but he did not mean to com plain as Ins father was most to blame The appeal ance of the countess prevented his pioceediiig, or the fnends from replying to his impei tmciit remarks ShegreetedSel by with liei usual coi dnhty, and thanked hun foi the h^stc he h id made then turn mg to the soldier, to whom she had been introduced, she welcomed him to Anmore, but vv ith a degree of formality not very flittering to his feehngs, and which, to Sclby perfectly accounted for the emb ıı rassment he fancied sir Henry display ed, who might unitine tint the more wel come he was to tlie carl, the less likely he vi as to be so to the countess, who ceri un ly ftlt the less cordial towards linn fiom the eail s great anxiety to see and consult \v ith lum " АД ill you take bre ikfust, gentlemen * or shall I accompany you to the earl, who is particularly impatient to see yov, sir

key, after inquiring whether the countess and Mi Selby had withdrawn Sir Henry did as he desired, and then requested his lordship would lie down— any degree of agitation must prove hurt¬ ful to lum, assuring him that he might command his services in any and every honourable way, though he hoped he had taken alarm prematurely " No, my kind friend, I feel I ain a dy¬ ing man,' he replied in a solemn tone, putting his hand to his head, " these sen- sations do not deceive me My medical attendants are not more sanguine, they dale not open my head, nor would I con¬ sent to such an operation, at least till I have settled all my worldly affairs, if then, since I am in momentary dread of being depnved of my senses ' Hav e y ou no suspicions, my lord ------' " Admitting I may have any, sir Henry," interrupted the peer, ' I give you my ho¬ nour I can adduce no proof m suppoit of them, and were I to acknowledge upon whom my suspicions have fallen, the woild would only say I had met with my deserts, nor do I believe that the person I do suspect

CHAPTER XII The countess had retired to her dressing loom, when our soldier, having taken α short turn to compose his feelings and re¬ tail his usual cool presence of mmd, entei eel the breakfast parlour, where he found Mrs Cummmgs presiding at the tea t ible, lord Danv eis, and Selby The two former eagerly inquired how he had left the earl ? " Perfectly sensible, and,' he hoped, " ш no immediate danger ' Mrs Cummings appeared gratified while lord Danvers, after requesting sir Henry would take some refreshment, since he wished him to consider himself perfect ly at home at Anmore, though he was not the master, conduded by expressing his
Tears that the earl s present exemption from pam was no priof of his amendment ' I did not understand that his lordship was fiee from pain but I never saw a per. son in such a situation more collected or moie able to transact business, and I have seen in mv people suffering under some thing simiiai contusions," rephed the ba ι onet w ho drank a bason of tea, but plead ed, in excuse to Mrs Cummingss well meant entreaties that he w ould take some¬ thing more solid, that sitting up all night vv as not f ívom ible to the ippetite She was satisfied, as was the viscount, w hile the moie observant and more feehng law v ci attnbuted sir Henry s disinclination to eat to his spirits being evidently op pressed by the euri s confidential communi с ations he therefore kept the v iscount in chat, who was vehemently declaiming against the siqiposed assassin, when they heard the medical gentlemen descending the stairs Lord Danv ers hastened to meet them, as did the new comers, and Mrs Cummings In answer to the viscount, they said
they had not given up all hope of the eail s recovery, they had been proposing a sm- gical operation, but Ins loidsiup had put α decided negative upon such a mode of treatment, still they trusted much to na¬ ture, taking their leave till evening The viscount affected to lament his fa¬ thei s obstinacy, but as su Henry express¬ ed a wish to change Ins dress, and Selby was summoned to attend the eail, the pai¬ ty separated, lord Danv eis taking upon himself to shew the baronet to the apiit- ment prepared foi him, hoping he w ould remam at Anmoie forsorne dajs at least Never had om soldiei ftlt more relieved than when left to himself, as he imme¬ diately dismissed Hanj, telling him he had letteis to wnte, and would ring when he wished to dress During the ensuing houi, he paced the laige «ipartraent, where he was suffered to indulge m meditation , w hen, having set¬ tled his pi m respecting Maiy AVeatherbv, and made some more important resolu¬ tions, he wiote a few lines to the colonel, nnd as nnny more to his bnikei in town,
to whom lie transmitted the draft he had receiv ed from the earl He then summon¬ ed Hany, and having changed his dress, desired him to proceed to Biandford with his letters, if it was too far to walk, he must procuie a horse—nt all events, he must not entrust the letters to any other peison Hany premised not to suffer them to go out of his bauds, till he deposited them in the lcttei box, and as Mi Selby w as busily employed in adding a codicil to the earls will, by which the countess would be rendered even nchci, in point of in¬ come, than she was left bj su Hei bert, the biroiiet took a tuin in the home grounds, wheie he was joined by ош law yer, who spokt in verj fivourablo teims of the earl s present dispositions, declaring he wished, though he could not hope, he might recover Ht hid promised the countess to remam in Dorsetshire for a lew dajs " And I hav e made the same promise to the earl, rejoined the baronet " though VOL v H

CHAPTER XIII The baronet had told Selby where he was going, and the head-gai dener had pointed out the road to Ashford Farm, having first shewn him where the earl was found after his accident, and then let hnn out through the private door. He followed the path, as directed, resolving to be guided by cir¬ cumstances at all events, he meant to urge Mary s confiding in her mother, with whom she could much better plan how to con¬ ceal hei folly, than with him, a young man, and a total stranger, he must put otlier people in the secret, therefore ten to one whether it was kept, and whether the very precautions he might suggest n3
might not lend to suspicions more m|it- lious to her charactei than even were her inti igne w ith 'he call to be made public As he approached the house, he saw scvcrtl people leaving the farm-jaid by the opposite gate, v-if going а -w ceiling, among whom ho nther sujiposed was the ow nu of the hoise, which might pro' о an advantage, since it might enable hnn to renew his visits No one appealing, and the house door standing open, he entered the hall at the very moment Mis AVea- therbj r , in her morning-dress and w orking- apron, was descending the stans from the cheese-room The sight of a strnger, who certainly had the appearance of a gentleman, rathei startled her, she curtsied, not being fa¬ shionable enough to know that such salu¬ tations were exploded, and requested to know what he pleased to want, apologiz¬ ing for her dishabille Curb ironct immediately explained his cn mrl, nicrdy telling her he had deiivcd his liiloirration from the call's head groom, and as his stay would probably be very

CHAPTER XV
Sir Henry devoted his sohtarv journey to medit ition upon the past, and resolutions for the future, he had much to say, and much to leve al to the colonel—and jet he could not be peifectly candid with hnn, but he would cxjil un himself as far as de hcacy for the feelings ot others permitted He passed H irry and Jack, w hom he vv as leading on tlie road ; the lattei bore his jouiney extremely well, and vvas m as lugli spirits and as playful as ever Olir soldiei desìi ed he might not be burned, us he wished him to appeal to advantage when shewn to his future mistress Hariy promised to bnng him in quite fresh, and the baronet pursued his jouiney.
To his great joy, the colonel was in readiness to greet his return—" As I knew when to expect jou, I resolved to give jou the meeting, sir Henry My house is full ol relations, or I should have wajlaid you, and made you dine with me, but my brother, whom you saw m town, Ins wife, and son, are come m seaıch of Elizabeth, so I left Anna to en¬ tertain them, while I came to dine unin¬ vited I agree w ith j ou -----" " You tould not have done me a greater favour, colonel, as 1 have much, and ol se¬ rious import, to talk over vv ith you Hut let us dine, and then I will open my bud¬ get How is Miss 1 itzmaunce?

" She is very kind—but they will keep Does Selby propose to remain any time in Dorsetshire ? ' ' I did not understand so, he stands en¬ gaged to visit me as he returns to town but will you suffer me to make myself ra¬ ther decent, while you peruse the countess's letter? ' " Only make haste, as I nm very hun¬ gry," was the reply, and in less than a quarter of an hour our soldier i etui ned to his friend, with whom he immediately sat down to an excellent dinner " Where is Harry?" the colonel in¬ quired, not seeing him as usual behmd his master's chair " He is upon the road, but I do not suppose he will arrive ere morning, as he is bnngmg home a horse I have pui chased, and which is not used to travelling " The colonel said no more, and when the servants had withdrawn, and they had drank a few glasses of wme, our sokliei, turning to his guest—" Did not it appeal rather strange to you, colonel, that your daugliter and I should be old acquaint-
anees, as you must have íemarked her surprise and my embarrassment when we met (as I wished to have had it supposed) as strangers ? ' " As you have so frankly reverted to what certainly has rather puzzled me, I must confess I did suppose you had met before, since you often seemed to under¬ stand each other, when I was at a loss to guess to what your conversation alluded 1 never asked any explanation of my daughter, because I felt assured, that if there was any mystery attached to your speeches or conduct, she dul not feel her self at liberty to elucidate it, to gratify my cunosity ' " She has displayed the greatest discre¬ tion, and no less presence of mind, for which I sh ill ever consider myself as great¬ ly her debtoi, since it would have been sin¬ gularly galling to my ieehngs, had she (and, strange to say, of all my former fnends, she is the only one who has recognized me) proci umed me to be the Harry Pembroke who had the good fortune to become hei protector, at a time when 1 myself was
equally dependent upon the amiable couple who txtendid their kindness towards her ' Harry Pembioke' You the presei vtr of my life ' nho the piotector of my then orphan child ' How tan I ever make л ou amends oı ei шее mj gi atitude for your kindness towaids a deserted baby, whose misery iv ts hei onl) claim upon jour cha¬ nty ?

become acquainted with, and let me do him the justice to say, that he not only pro cured mc the appointment of a cadet, but provided for all my wants in the most li¬ beral manner, without making himself known, as he did all under the name of my father s friend, when, h wing recommend ed me to the particular care of captain Alolesworth, the commander of the Asia, he left me to seek my fortune, having ex¬ acted my promise not to make my desti¬ nation known to the friends of rny mf mey and vouth " I cannot defend what you may deem ungrateful, since I cannot enter into many particulars, which I might plead in excuse for consenting to his wishes and I only wish you to remember that I vv as not even at this moment acknowledged by eithei of my parents, nor did it appear likely I ever should, as they vvere both v,arrted, but not to each otlier " I often reproached myself, when it was too late, for not at least putting my early friend, George Selby, mto my confidence (by the way, he has not proved himself so
quick-sighted as the lovely child, whose image has never been effaced from my mind during such a lapse of years), but having sailed, I had put it out of my powei to benefit by his cooler head and judiciou« advice " I was enrolled under my real name— at least the one I was christened by, Hen¬ ry Pemberton, which my mother, either to preserve her secret, or to deceive my fa¬ ther, had changed to Pembroke, and I need not tell y ou that general Morning¬ thorpe, my much more than father, and his wild nephew, Harry Perciv al, sailed in the same ship which vv afted me from the Bri¬ tish shoies ' Here our hero recapitulated the com¬ mencement and progress of his acquaint ance with the general, dwelling upon the follies of Peicival, which fimily led to the catastrophe which proved so fatil to the officers, sailors, and passengers, on board the Asm, and thus proceeded—" I exert¬ ed myself to the utmost to nurse this mad- brained youth, very contrary to the w ishes of his excellent uncle, and was in conse-
quence soon confined to mv cot and, but for the unremitting care of the gcneuil, who was my constant attend mt, I must have paid the debt of nature j outh, and an excellent constitution unimpaired by any excess, enabled me to sti ug„li tin ough the disorder but I was so weak, so help less, and my faculties were so dormant, when the ship came to an anelici , that I was а mere machine m the general s h nids and, so long as I did but see hnn, and hen his voice, I felt satisfied How or w here I was landed I hardly knew, but I soon felt the comfort of being upon terra firma , and as my strength increased, my memory returned, and I became sensible that I w as no longer on board ship, and th it ev ery comfort and luxury w as provided for me, hkelj to recruit mv exhausted frame " Except my beloved benefactor, w hom I alwaj s welcomed with tears ot gratitude, I saw no one but his faithful Indian valet, and a native woman lather advanced m years, by whom I could merely make mv "df understood by signs " At the expiraţiei! of ι fortnight I was
able to question my benefactor, who with due precaution told me his ntphew was no more, and that captain Moleswoith had also fillen a victim to this direful distase, but not btfoie he had strongly recommended me to the general, and told him, in strict confidence, that I had heen committed to his care by my fathei , whose name, rank in life, &e he also revealed to my protec¬ tor and thus I first discovered how gross¬ ly he had deceived me, and began to lear he had equally deluded me lespecting my mother " I opened my mind to my now only friend, who strengthened my suspicions, seeming to fear my father had had some very sinister end m view, when he decoy¬ ed mp from my Charmg friends, assuring me 1 could not be too much upon ray guaid against a man of such a disposition, who, having the pow er, might, if it «uited his purpose, mar ail my prospects of rising m the service, and render me an absolute dependent on his will and pleasure ' I have now, he continued, ' told you what my fears have suggested, ltt me now

CHAPTER XVI Anna had not retired when her father re turned, who, unwilling to I ep her up, de¬ sired her to meet him at seven the next morning, m his study She Was punctual to the appointment, and listened with an interest bordenng on enthusiasm to Harry Pembroke s tale, and did not affect, when told of his proposals to deny her regard ft» him, candidly ac knowledgmg, that young as he was when he left Charing, he had made an indelible impression upon her heart, assunng her fa ther that it was with the utmost difficulty she had concealed her joy upon so unex¬ pectedly recogm/ing hei young protector in the heroic and popular Morningthorpe Neither the colonel nor she w ould suf¬ fer themselves to foim, or rather to give utterance to a conjecture respecting Ins pa vol v к
rents : she only observed, that she knew lady AVallingford had grieved very sincere¬ ly ,when he left Charing, and she owned she was amazed she 1ш4 not also recog¬ nized him ; perhaps, as he had hinted, she might not have chosen to do so—at all events, she acknowledged tq her delighted father that she considered herself the hap. piest of women, and appeared in such spi¬ rits at breakfast, Eliza declared she enyie4 her good-humour, and not much relishing the Winchester excursion; and scarcely were they gone ere our hero drove his, cur¬ ricle to the Grange; and need we add, that ere colonel Fitzmaurice sunumm,ed the lovers to dinner (though there is np вдсЬ thing as perpetual happipess but at Qan, goridißn, where one cannot go without griffins, or at lildorado, where ong eannpt go at all), our hero and heroine thought they approached as neat the verge, of' ex¬ treme felicity as any pah' ever did, in our reßl world. Anna, her aunt not having dined bplow, left the gentlemen over their wine,, to pay her a short visit, when it was resolved to
set Selby to work upon the settlements as soon as he reached the Abbey. Colonel Hertford's and sir Herbert Charleville's bequest» had rendered Am» a rich heiress ; but lier hundred thousand pounds was a mere drop of water compared to sir Henry's immense fortune. The colonel declared his proposals were much too generous : should hia daughtei (which God in his mercy forbid ') be left a widow, she miglit, as he had recently seen an example, barter her happiness for a co¬ ronet. " Then she cat* only blame herselÇ" was the reply, " as I am resolved not to place her under any restrKtiunsi should I die without heirs" The colonel therefore gave up the poinfe promising to bring Anna to breakfest at the Abbey the next morning, to see a great euriosilry. Never had an evening passed more ra¬ pidly« at least in the eyfes of two of the company; andlthe-next moimmgjaek (who was rather Ihe better for his jouiney, and к a
almost as fond of Harry as of his late own ers) was shewn to his future mistress, who fed him with bread, and declared she never saw such a beautiful creature. Harry was to break him in, under the supenntendence of sir Hemy, who was professionally a most superior horseman, and as the Winchester party did not pro pose returning till evening, the father and daughter, by the desire of the invalid, Mrs Fitzmaunce, spent the day at the Abbey, the love я talking and walking over the scenes of their early joys, and the colonel anticipating the time when he should see his grandchildren sporting in the extensive park surrounding the Abbey Selby vvas to remain in ignorance of our heros being his early friend, who now learnt from Anna every event of import ance which had taken place at Charing since his departure from thence The Medhcotts still resided there, the Hoskinses he had seen and remarked, ob serving that poverty did not seem to have improved their manners He had also seen Mrs Nelson, who appeared the same
excellent, active, benevolent creature, as when she received him, upon his return Irom the gipseys' tents Mrs and Miss Alargram and Mrs Courtney, he had also seen the old lady was merely altered by time the younger ones had turned out all he had ever expected, good sort of young women, who were likely to prove excel lent wiv es, as times went After tea, sir Henry returned with his guests to the Grange, where the Winches ter party soon arrived, and music con eluded the evening The next day Selby reached the Abbey, and declared he had never undertaken any task with so much pleasure, as drawing the proposed settlements, giving the baro¬ net great credit for bis generosity, and hoping he would now take a town house He proposed doing so the next winter, but while they were, the one giving, the other receiving the necessary instructions, the colonel was imparting his daughters brilliant prospects to his brother, leaving her to inform her cousin, who requested to be bridemaid
The rector was happy he should thus claim α relationship to so neh a man, think¬ ing it a good thing to be connected with monied people His son wished he had previously de dared himself, as a hundred thousand pounds was money, and he had come into Hampshire to feel his way Sn Charles was also apprized m form, and his congratulations were returned m due form Nor did Anna lose a moment in wntmg to her beloved protectress, only wishing she dared tell her who her beloved sir Hen¬ ry really was, being convinced that the in¬ telligence would be very gratifying to her feelings as it was, she conld merely dwell upon the praises of the acknowledged hero, ond hope that their union wonld meet her approbation The countess returned her answer ex press, declaring herself ddighted with her daughter's prospects, as she entei tamed the highest opinion of sir Henry Morning- thorpe's disposition and pnnciples, the late eail and Mr Selby having avowed the
highest esteem for him, and concluded by assurnig her favourite that she would sen- onsly hurt her feelings if she reftised her the pleasure öf providing her with her bri¬ dal finery, she had sent Mrs Cummings to town, to give her orders to the dress maker and milliner they had always both employed, since it was a mother s privilege, and of which she would not be depnved, writing also to congratulate the colonel, who evinced his regard for her by suffenng her to furnish his daughter's wardrobe The ensuing six weeks were spent in a round of gaiety, both at the Abbey and the Grange Sir Henry and the colonel each gave a tete to the poor, m honour of the peace, and several splendid entertain¬ ments to their richer neighbours, the mili¬ tary quartered at Southampton and Win¬ chester, and all the nobility and gentiy in the enviions Sir Charles Fitzmaunce agam brouglit his family to Southampton, in hopes his daughters might be ás fortunate as their Cousin Mrs Nelson had never been so fullyvnor
so gratefully employed, as the bridegroom- elect had resolved to portion six village girls of her selection, who were to be mar ned on the same day, but the week after he had received the hand of his beloved Anna, and on the day selected for the village weddings, the tenants, as well as all the poorer classes, were to be regaled, since he wished every inhabitant of Channg to participate m his felicity Nor was the colonel less anxious to dis¬ play his benevolence—he formed some equally charitable plans, therefore never were more sincere wishes expressed for the happiness of any two people, situated as were our hero and heroine AVe shall not detail the bnde s wardrobe, nor dwell upon the beauty and quantity of her jewels, though, so profuse had been the gifts of her father, adopted mother, and lover, " that she might," said her favourite cousin, " have been deemed the queen- of diamonds" Nor was either she or the colonel less generous towaids Fhza Fitzmaunce, to whom Anna presented, in her fathers
name, five thousand pounds, and a set of jewels It had been settled that the marriage should take place at an early hour, after which the colonel was to give the bridal party a breakfast, previous to the bride and bridegroom's departure for a tour of three weeks or a month We shall not detail the rejoicings which took place, nor comment upon the new- married couple's looks and behaviour, who set out, as it had been arranged, from the Grange, and bent their steps towards the lakes of Cumberland, leaving the colonel surrounded by his family, and the hap¬ piest of men The village weddings were duly cele¬ brated, and he wrote the new-marned couple a full account of the jubilee which ensued, assunng them that Mrs Nelson declared there was not a discontented per¬ son in Channg, save and except the Hos- kmses, who were too proud to mix with the poorer classes, and too much despised by the better sort of inhabitants to be m- K 3
vited to atsociate with them ; and, though living upon the late sir Herbert's charity, tbey as usual fancied themselves neglected and overlooked, and were as miserable as those who most disliked them could wish.
CHAPTER XVH. Ат the expiration of a month, the new- married couple returned to the Abbey; and never were rqoicings more sincere than those displayed by the inhabitants in ge¬ neral. The colonel was in waiting to rëoeive them, and declared he had thrown off ten years of his age, how his mind was so- com¬ pletely at ease, and every wish he could form gratified. íhey found a very kind letter from the countess of Walhngford, who requested they would come and enliven her solitude as soon as they had paid and received their bridal visits ; she should invite no one but
the colonel to meet them, therefore hoped Anna's next letter would inform her when she might expect them. Sil· Henry agreed tbey could not refuse het invitation ·, he only feared that, as far as he win» concerned, it was a mere compli¬ ment to her favourite's feelings and choice. Anna defended her patroness ; she was sore she would be as happy to see tile one as the trther ; and finally it was settled that they should pi-oceed to Anmore at the end of a month, »hich they must devote to etiquette, and the usual visits. Our hero had beard through Selby that Mary Weatherby was at Chelsea, and that every precaution was taken to preserve her secret and her reputation; he therefore hoped that he had honourably fulfilled the trust reposed in him b)· the deeeased earl, though he resolved to watch over this de¬ luded girl, and to see her child properly brought up, and duly provided for. On the Sunday after tlieir return to Charing, the new-married ширю made their appestane« at church, and were ai.
mired, or criticized, according to the dispo¬ sition of those present Mrs Hoskins little supposed she should have seen a girl, who came into the village a mere beggar, appear so grand as a bride, sir Henry Morningthorpe was easily satis fied, or he would have made more parti¬ cular inquiries respecting her ongin , old Bncklonds death had been all in her fa vour, or ten to one he would, in a drunken fit, have retracted all he had said She was, however, so severely cut up by every one who were indebted to either the bnde or bridegrooms benevolence, that she was perforce obliged to keep her ill- natured remarks to herself, as Mrs Nelson reminded her of her nephew s pranks, de¬ clanng she had ruined her husband by her ill natured tongue Though anxious to conform to every usage of society, our happy pair longed tb be left to enjoy the conveisation of each other Jack, who turned out a most complete lady s horse, seemed proud of carrying hi« fair mistress, with whom he was soon as
familiar as he had been with the Wca- therbys; and as no one broke in upon their tête-à-tête rides, she grew fonder than ever of the exercise ; when, the month being expired, they wrote the countess when to expect them, the co¬ lonel agreeing to follow them to Anmore, as soon as sir Charles, who was now his guest, took his departure, which he talked of doing in a couple of days. They travelled with their own horses ; nor was Jack left behind, as Anna wished to explore the country round Anmore, nn¬ der her husband's guidance ; and they tra¬ velled frequently on horseback, often de¬ viating from the direct road, till the third morning, when they reached the magnifi¬ cent seat belonging to the Walhngford family. ι Anna gave the decided preference to Melksham Abbey, when they drove into the park : Anmore House might be larger, hut it did not appear to the same advan¬ tage from the drive, nor were the home grounds so judiciously laid out Such were her remarks, in which sir Henry con-
cttrrcvl, when the stopping of 'the carriage gavé a turn to her ideasi Mrs. Cummings received theni in thte hall, end offered her congratulations ifi weil-droseli terms, and with great sinceri« ty, άπΆ then led the way into an elegant irlOiTiing-rtìoni, tvilere they found the obian- tesS, whb gave thein ft most cordial recep¬ tion, appearing to consider Annii as a be¬ loved daughter, and observing that they hid fièVef beten solang asunder since tHeir Ŕrit: meétihg. Thé Usual Compliments heilig paid, and thtt party seated, she gaily nűlied Aime npbn her spirit oif romance, which had in¬ duced hér to rémain single till hetjiahtir't Hero had returned to England ; agreeing that she had wished to see thein muted, after having seen and conversed with sit Henry Morrtirigthorpe, who, under üre¬ tence of seeing how Jack had bornei hü jonrney, soon left the ladies to themselves, as he fancied he perceived that he was «μ ther a check upon the countess, who, aftet the first welcome and eongnitnhrtions,
teemed not to feel quite et ber ease in his presence. " Does she, or does she not recollect me ?" he mentally exclaimed, while pro¬ ceeding to the stables ; " or does she sup¬ pose I am acquainted witli her secret ? At all events, she will find I have not even put my wife entirely in my confidence." Jack had never looked better ; and, the late earl's groom, who continued in the countess's seitviee, was in extacies over him —he must call upon John Weatherby, to tell him how much he was unproved. Sir Henry was amused by his remarks, and loitered away the time till he went I» dress. Anne, who though always most elegant in her appearance, was never long at her toilet, was alone in the saloon when he en¬ tered it. She asked after her favourite, And then reverted to the countess. " Do you know I am, half inclined to suspect she recollects you, Henry, and yet is afraid to avow the idea? I dared not lead to the subject, though she asked une severalquestions, whichmight have brought
it on ; and yet even to me she seems averse to mentioning the name of Pembroke, though admitting she, as is most likely, supposes you the nephew of general Mor¬ ningthorpe, she must know you sailed from England with Harry Pembroke, and that the general transmitted the account which led her tp believe sir Herbert Charleville's ward was no more." " I dare say she is aware of the circum¬ stance you allude to, my love; but we must leave her to the workings of her own mind : if she questions me, or affords me a favourable opportunity, I give you my honour I will be very candid with her ; but she must lead to the subject, and in such a way as may induce me to acknow¬ ledge why I suffered her to suppose me no more." " I leave every thing to your better judgment, Harry ; so, to change the sub¬ ject—I have walked over the house with Mrs. Cummings, who is, by the way,-a worthy pleasant woman ; and, if I mistake not, you were once her particular favour-
ite, yet I am sure she has not the slight est recollection of you " You alone, my Anna, instantly recog mzed me, and thus convmctd mc that you had always borne me in mind The entrance of the countess and Mrs Cummings interrupted then discourse, which, dunng dinner, turned upon the co¬ lonel, who, according to his arrangements when they left Charmg, they hoped would leach Anmore in the evening Mis Cummings, the countess told them, was going to London the next day, having received α letter which rendered her pre¬ sence necessary there, and she could the better spore her, as she now enjoyed the company of Iter daughtei lhe news of Channg was next discuss¬ ed, Anna telling her fnend that Mrs Nel¬ son had requested she would send some money she had given her to a sister of her late husbands, who resided at Bland ford—" But these are commissions,' she proceeded, " which I do not Uke to dele- gate to others, so I shall drive to Bland- ford in the morning, and endeavour to see
the poor soul, as Mrs. Nelson gave me a very pai ticular direction where to find her." The countess thought her very right, readily supposing she meant to make an addition to Mrs. Nelson's bounty. The dinner was such as became the rank of the countess, and she did the honours with such cordiality, that even sir Henry could not but suppose he was a welcome He rose when fhe countess difl, gaily observing that he could not remain alone over the bottles, therefore, at the risk of being a restraint upon thdr conversation, he mast accompany the ladies into the sa¬ loon. Her ladyship made a polite reply, re¬ gretting the Colonel had not accompanied him to Anmore. The next day she hoped he would assist her to do the honours of her house. Tlie evening closed m, but no colonel made his appearance, which sir Henry, Who hâd taken a stroll after tea, afceouftted for by supposing sir Charles had prolonged his stay, tìiakìng no donbt they should
either hear from thetr fhthei, as he styled him, or вее hım the next day Anna was of the same opinion, since he had not absolutely fixed the time of his departure and as the countess was no card player, she exerted her musical talents to the great gratification of the party as¬ sembled, who did not separate till rather a late hour Sir Henry was rather surprised at the colonels delay, though he did not tommu- nicate his thoughts to his wife, who con¬ sidered it as very satisfactorily accounted for When they met at breakfast, it was set¬ tled that lady Morningthorpe should take Mrs Cummmgs with her to Biandford, as she had taken a place in a toach which went through that town about one o'clock, and before sir Henry could mention what his intentions were, the countess said— " I will endeavour to amuse the baronet during your absence, my dear Anna " Of course he could make no objections to her plan, though he did not much en¬ joy being kft Ute-it -Ше with her, yet, if
she had any thing to say to him, any ques¬ tions to put, or acknowledgments to make, she had certainly better do it when they were alone.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Ouït hero having handed his Anna and Mrs. Cummings into the chaise, returned into the house, and joined the countess in the library, to which no one could approach without giving timely notice to those in the room, a precaution or contrivance of the late earl's, which he had often found very useful. " I shall not apologize, sir Henry, for having sought this conference; indeed you must have accused me of having treated you with too much reserve during your late visit here ; but I was so situated at that time, and you were so avowedly in the earl's confidence, that I felt unwilling (not being so perfectly acquainted with
your prmciples and disposition as 1 am at present) to put many queries to you, which I was very anxious to have solved—Do not interrupt me—I read my forgiveness lor past slights m your countenance—You must have known and must remember a youth of the name of Pemberton, who sailed in the same ship in whicli your un¬ cle and yourself took your passage to In¬ dia? " I both knew and perfectly remember the person you allude to " " As you were nearly of an age, though he must have been your junior, perhaps you became intimate during the voyage ' " We were sworn friends ' " Then you must have known that Pemberton kept a journal, which might, m fact, be deemed a transenpt of his feel tngs, and which fully explained why he had left England, who were his parents, and many other particulars perhaps you have read the papers I inention, aa general Morningthorpe sent them to England, m obedience to his last wishes' ' " Admitting, my dear madam, that ei-
ther general Morningthorpe or myself were in Pemberton's confidence, you cannot suppose that either of us would betray what must have been entrusted to us under the seal of secrecy'" " You have fully answered my question, sir Henry, as I now feel assuied that you are as well acquainted with the contents of that journal as I am, you must there¬ fore have been perfectly able to account for my reserve, and for the confusion and embarrassment I must frequently have evinced m your presence perhaps the late eart ------" " I do not think his lordship was aware that I was so fully acquainted with the circumstances to which j ou have reverted as you are he mentioned his natural son more than once, with regret, and supposed he was not unknown to me, but he enter¬ ed into no particulars, and I give you my honoui, I gave him no reason to suppose I was so wise as I acknowledge I am " " You have given, me the most gratify¬ ing pi oofs of your discretion, but I own, when the earl expressed such anxiety to
see you iţi lib dying aiioments, I attri- l>ltcd his impfitieritje tp his having recom¬ mended his natural son, tluwigb, some private, medi««!,, t«^ your late urţţile's no¬ tice, inid I,sn;pposed he wished to request у/щ, «4)en,CR towards me; yet hß k»evv I vvas ifl, prjţsstssiiojjj ,of Perţiberton'sjqtirnal: İPj short, I was, so puzzled ajid perplexed, that I repeatedly resplycii tp nsk you tlie very qjiestiojis you hfjvp ( powj sa politely resolved; but whene,vşr any qpjiprtunity cţffered, I shrunk from tlie exploitation, and sitffcred you to leave Amjioije and me as much in the dafk; as before.

secret now rests between our two selves— and I here pledge my honour to carrj it with me to the grave You have merely fulfilled my expecta¬ tions, sir Henry but I have resolved to confide this secret as you very properly term it to my adopted daughter and her excellent father, tat с it may acquit me, in their eyes, of having imprudently bestow ed my hand upon the late earl A wish to keep them in ignorance of my early credulity, and of my 1 aving had a son, combined with ч latent attachment for the carls person (I conld not be enamoured with his character), led to mv forming the connexion His lordship assailed me on my vulnerable side, and I became a second time his dupe As I wish to be perfectly candid I shall enter into a few details re specting my first acquaintance with the carl Sir Henry was politely attentive—nay often appeared to participate in her feel ings while she recapitulated many events with which our readers are already fully acquainted dwelhng very forcibly upon
her reasons for resolving, to leave the earl, as he desired, to the stings of a guilty con¬ science, since she could not bear the idea of making what she considered her shams public; still she declared she was more ao tuated by a wish to keep her darling diild in ignorance of the stigina attached to his birth, than by any absolute selfish motives. Chance had enabled her, through the means of Mrs. Meredith, to cany her ro- mantie plan into execution, and she had resolved, by the most careful economy, to render him peifectly independent She next related the rise and progress of her acquaintance witli sir Herbert Charleville, their subsequent union, and tlie engage¬ ments he had entered into to provide for this idolized child—" Since, strange to say," she proceeded, " he seemed to become the dearer to me for the very mystery I had thrown over his fate. How often have I longed to take hiin to my arms, and ac¬ knowledge myself' to be his mother ! but this indulgence respect for the feelings of sir Herbert. Charleville forbade;—I could not VOLí,V. n . , I.
declare his wife to be the mother of an tl legitimate child ' ' He had, how ever, so anxious was he to pratify any wish I could form, resolved to entrust my son with the secret of his birth, when he had attained an age hkely to render him sensible of the importance of the trust but while we were planning how to spare his feelings, and how to bring him forward in the way most consonant to his own wishes, the earl was undermining the peace and happiness of both mother and son Well, piace to his manes' he died, I hope and beheve, a sincere penitent ' Had my son lived, you would never have been master of Melksham Abbey, sir Henry as sir Herbert Charleville would certainly have nade hım his heir indeed he was almost as fond of the dear vouth as I was myself, and was even more anxious to shield him fiom the contempt of the world He never forgave h mself, he told me upon his deathbed, for having once, under a false impression, spoken to hnn very harsWy, an J havmg accused him of «. sorting a falsehood, which he ought to
have known he would trave scorned to do, as he attributed his immediate departure to his mistaken ill judged reproofs, as we never saw him again, though his innocence respecting the charge brought against him was soon made manifest but I am indul¬ ging my own garrulity at the expence of your patiente, str Henry yet I feel a re¬ liefin thus opening mj he irt; and explain¬ ing my motives for having suffered my son to remam m ignorance of our relation- slup " Your motives, feelings, and conduct, vvere all highly praiseworthy, lady Wal¬ hngford Perhaps you suffered your son, out of motives of delicacy to remain tod long in suspense respecting his family and connexions which certainly laid him open to the deception which led to Ins leaving England, since, had he been as well ac quainted with your real reasons for keep mg hım m the dark as you have made me, 1 am certain he would never hav e with¬ drawn himself from youi prelection—he hardly forgave himself for having done so, ι 2

Could he forgive his unnatural father, and lus weak, mvsterious mother, whose romantic flights had duven him to seek the protec¬ tion of a man who could have misled a much more able judge of human nature ?" The countess s anxiety and contrition weie so legibly depicted upon her counte¬ nance, that our hero was unable to conceal his emotion I perceive you were indeed sincerely ttachfd to my unfoi tunate son.

spare your feelings and my own, by drop¬ ping the subject : our tears cannot recall the past, and I feel comparatively happy in the reflection that my son must be reap¬ ing the fruit of his early virtues." " Not exactly m the sense you mean-, my dear madam : as I dare no longer keep you in suspense—Your son did not die on board the Asia, as you were led to sup¬ pose ; but'I trust you will forgive the very innocent deception, when-«-«—" " Is he still living?" she faintly inqui¬ red, while the colour all forsook her cheeks. Fortunately a gush of tears came to her relief, and enabled her to bear up against the pleasurable emotions which assailed her, when our hero, wifh due precaution, made himself known to her. For a few minutes she was lost in amaze, when she exclaimed—" Then well might your features seem familiar to me, my beloved Henry !" minutely examining his forehead, which still bore evidence of the blow he had received from the gipsey. " Do you doubt my assertion, my dear mother ?"
" I should much sooner doubt the evi¬ dence of my own eyes. How could I have been so blind ? That scar, and the way in which you wear your hair, have both com¬ bined to mislead me, particularly as I made no doubt of your having paid the debt of nature; so hasten to inform me why I have been thus kept in the dark ?" Our hero instantly and briefly related every thing that had occurred since his departure from Charing; acknowledging that be was fearful she would not have ap¬ proved of his making himself known to her, she appeared to have taken such pains to conceal their affinity; he had therefore remained silent from principle, and should, as he had told her, have car¬ ried the secret to his grave, if she had not, by convincing him that the knowledge would add to her happiness, induced him to break through his settled resolutions. He then told her that Anna Fitzmaurice was the only person who had instanta¬ neously recognized him, since Selby, with whom he was upon the most friendly terms, did not appear to entertain an idea
of his being his early friend He then de¬ tailed how fiir he had discovered himself to the colonel and lady Morningthorpe, leaving it entirely to her to make their relationship known to them oi not, as her wishes should be his law at all events, he wislicd the world should continue to suppose him the nephew of general Mor¬ ningthorpe—indeed he had promised tliat worthy man never to resign the title of relative, whicli he had bestowed upon him " To the world you shall continue to ap¬ pear what you really are, one of our most popular heroes, and the nephew of an equal¬ ly brave man, but with the colonel and our beloved Anna we will have no seorets« They are already acquainted with the «Iler gitunacy of jour butli, and they shall know me as your mother The huebarid of my adopted daughter must allow me to style htm my son, and no one will be sur¬ pi ised at your wife s becoming my heir A. ou need be under no apprehension of my indiscretion betraying your secret—it I was able to conceal oui relationship dunng
your childhood, I thmk you will believe I shall be able to keep as stnet a guard over my feelings now, so, as the first proof of my self-denuil, leave me to compose my agitated spirits, and to return my thanks to Him who raised you friends in your hour of need Go and meet your wife, I shall leave you to inform her of our rela¬ tionship , but prepare her to expect further instances of my self-denial, and assur« 1 her that I shall never m public appear at all more interested in your concerns than in Aeri " Our hero took an affectionate leave of her; and having ordered his horse, rode Out to join his Anna, whom he met so dear the park, that he proposed then a- lighting, as the day was cool, and walking home She made no objection , and he imme¬ diately entered upon his mothers story, which lie brought down to his leaving her ih the study Anna acknowledged she was not much surmised by the communication, as she was fully aware how bitterly she liad de-
plored his departure from Charing, and how sincerely she had mourned his death, feeling assured that, however pleasurable her feelings might be, the countess would always have them under strict control As they vvere entering the hall, she ask¬ ed our hero whether he had heard from her father? He declared that he had never inquired whether there weie any letters for either of them Upon putting the question to a servant, two weie brought him, aud one was given to lady Morningthorpe " From our father, ' he cried, breaking the seal as they entered the saloon, " very short and very sweet, he will bc here to¬ night, when he will inform us what pre¬ vented our seeing lum j esterday " My letter is from Fhza," replied Anna " And this other is fiom Selby, replied hei husband At this moment the countess s head w o- man came with hei lady's compliments, anda request to see lidy Morni.it,thoipc ι 3
in her dressing room, who instantly obey¬ ed the summons, leaving sir Henry to read his fnends letter, who, having entered into a few details respecting Mary Wea¬ therby, and some other commissions, wrote —that he had just learnt the Walton es tate, whicli he had once expressed a wish to pinchase, was to be sold outtnf Chan¬ cery, requesting he would transmit him his ordeis, if he still wished to buy it, which our hero instantly resolved to do, as the house, when put in repair, would form a very eligible residence for bis mo ther, who must ere long vacate Anmore The grounds round Walton were very beautiful, and the village was endeared to him, from having once been the residence of his Anna, and the scene of their first meeting.
СИАРТЕП XIX SiR Henry did not see his mother and wife again till they met m the saloon pre¬ vious to their being summoned to dinner, when, though the countess appeared in un¬ usual good spmts, she nevei reverted to the mommgs éclaircissement in direct terms, and before the servants she treated sir Hem j merely as a favoured guest which his bemg the husband of the chdd of her adoption perfectly accounted for and when they were agam left alone after dinner, she told the happy pair that her felicity was too great to vent itself in woids, and that she should never hence¬ forth address oui hero as her son, except m reference to his having married her daughter, as she should be more than ever afiaid of making bun blush for his ongin Sır Hemy s ıeply may be supposed, and
to change the subject, he mentioned Sel¬ by's letter " Desire him to purchase Walton for me," the countess instantly exclaimed, " I shall leave you, sir Henry, and the colonel to prepare it for my reception, it could not have presented itself to my recollection more apropos, he must not mmd money, as I am resolved to be your neighbour, and Mrs Cummings will approve of my removing into the vicinity of Channg' Our hero promised to wnte Selby her orders the next day, and they were talking over Harrys good qualities, whose artless tale she had already heard, when the colo¬ nel was ushered in by the groom of the chambers, who declared himself rejoiced to see the countess looking so w ell, he then shook hands with his son, and saluted his daughter, who rallied lum upon his laconic epistle, askmg what had delayed his jour¬ ney? 4 Let me have my tea, and then I will explain ' His request was complied with, when
the servants having withdrawn, he began as follows " I meant to have started yesterday morning at eight o'clock, and had, having to my great relief got rid of my titled re¬ lative and his family, the evening befoie given my oiders m consequence—not that I dislike titles, when thej are acquired as yours has been, str Heniij , then they en¬ noble the possessor, and may have a good effect upon postei ity but I am digress ing -----' " To compliment me, ' gaily observed om hero " so, piay proceed " Why then, iry plans were all deran¬ ged by Williamson s rousing me out of a sound sleep soon after six, with the agree¬ able intelligence that my house had been broken open dunng the night, and that he and the rest ot my household were m need of my advice how to proceed in consequence of this mistortune I soon understood it was a simpip burglary, and th it no one had been even al irmed, much less murdered, and, upon pioceediiig to the scene of action, I found the iron
bais, which secured the window of tlie butlers panti j, Ii id been forted by means of an iron tiow.and α laige pair of pmter«, with which the nails had been drawn, both of vv Inch the thief had left behind, having compii tely cfleeted his purpose My next inquiry was respecting what was missing, and I fi und it was merely some loose plate whicli is in common use, though an attempt had been made to break open one of the plate chests, which stand in the same room, which not having given waj so easily as the bars, the rogue had prudently made off with his booty, to the amount, as near as I could calculate, of about sixty pounds and even this loss was owing to Jarvis s laziness and carelessness, since hacı he locked it up as he ought to have done, it would have remained in the chest 1 merely hinted that I trusted this would piove a wai mug to him, while he and all the seivants were hoping I would endeavour to bnng the rogues to justice I did not see any pio- babihty ot so doing, when your old gime- keepcr, Henrj who was ruling his ıouııds, perceiving fiom the road that something
was amiss, by om having assembled so early upon the back lawn, rode towaids me to inquire what had occurred? I told him in a very few words, pointing out where the man or men had broken in He instantly alighted, and began examinmgtlie footsteps, which were very visible owing to the ram which had fallen the day before, till he discovered which way the thief had made his approaches he then took an ex¬ act measuic of the shoe, and pronounced it is his decided opinion thut there was but one person concerned in the robbeiy and from the path the villain had pursued, he made no doubt ot his having taken the ι oad to London Tins suggestion made all my fellow s eager to set out in pi rsmt of the wretch, but the old man desn cd them to have a little patience, else, in thtir violent haste, they might oveirun their game He then, with ι knowing look, having ex¬ amined the iron crow and the pincers, said, with my leave he would take them to Charmg, as it appeared to him they had been either borrowed or stolen from a smith s shop I gave him carh blanche
recollecting how veiy dextrous he hid often proved m detecting poatheis, there¬ fore thought it very probable he myht trace the thief He returned in about half an hour, and requested а private audience, when he acknowledged having Obtained a clue, and entreated that two or three of my men, upon whose courage I tould most depend, might be placed under In» direc tion, refusing to tell me upon whom his suspicions rested, as he might be mistaken, therefore, about the time I proposed de¬ parting for Anmore, he set out with his companions he had a couple of dogs with him, which I proposed his leaving at the Grange By no means, he replied, if the villam was concealed in a wood 01 a- ditch, his dogs were Very likely to scent him out, he had always encouraged them- in such manoeuvres —You now know what prevented my departure, so it only re¬ mains to tell you the result of Hattons plan —About five о clock in the aftei neon the party returned, bringing with them ч sailor looking fellow, whose hands were tied, and who was mounted behind one of
the men, and guarded by two others, who rode on either side, Hatton ridmg fiist, as cinefili command I could haidly forbear laughing as the cavalcade approached, par¬ ticularly when Hatton tnumphantly ex¬ claimed—' We have securedmygentleman, colonel, and hav e recovered all your plate, so now I wul deliver lum into your custody, to do as y ou think ht I only wish he could he immediately tned by α court-martial, and shot out of hand, however, as he will doubtless be banged, I must have patience, since, besides our having found the plate upon him, he has wounded John while endeavouring to secure him, so he need not hope foi mercy—indeed he is an old offender, and he has been an audacious lascai from his very childhood, therefore he will now fulfil the general prediction that he would come to the gallow s " Do you know bun ?

colonel, were you to suffer such a daring rogue to escape," rephed the countess, who, wishing to be fully restored to her respect¬ ed friend's esteem, immediately desired sir Henry to inform his father why she had bestowed her hand upon the earl of AVal- lmgfoid, retinng with Anna to afford him the opportunity Wc shall not recapitulate the communi¬ cation that followed, merely observing that the colonel learnt with surpnse who were our hero's parents, since, though he sup¬ posed lady AVallingford was in the secret of his birth, he did not suspect they were related, but declared he found his happi¬ ness admitted of increase, since he fully participated m the countess s satisfaction Our Mysterious Mothei now standing fully confessed, httle remains to be said, as we would fain leave the family party com¬ pletely happy But as madame de Cot- tin has justly observed, " temporal felicity can never be ol long duration, * still, foi a time, our hero and herome enjoyed as large a share of felicity as generally falls to the lot of mortals.

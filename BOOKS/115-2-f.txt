CHAPTER I. -,»«„™i- X HE benevolence of her ladyship wns soon known in Charing, and excited very different sensations in the minds of its in¬ habitants. Miss Graham was loud in her praise of so charitable an action—still judg¬ ing of the Charlevilles after her own heart,"' she could not help suspecting they had some latent motive for adopting this friend¬ less child, which she was scarcely less anx. ious to discover, than sir Herbert Was to learn from whom Anna was really de¬ scended, feeling convinced she Was not of vulgar origin. Our village spinster there¬ fore thought chance had befriended her, VOL. II. n
when it led her to the first hnendropers in Southampton, while the master was m the act of making up a large parcel for lady Chaileville, who, with the youthful Anna, was seated in the adjoining pirlour Miss Graham eagerly sei/ed the opportu nity to p i) her court and her compliments at the same time As she was eloquent in praise of Anna's beauty, and hei benefac¬ tress's generosity, her ladyship stopped her toi rent of words, by asking whether she would return with them to Channg' " I deem myself most unfortunate in not being able to avail myself of your lady - slup s very polite offer, but I am engaged to dme with Mrs and the Miss Margrams, at Mr Playfoids ' Lidy Chaileville secretly rejoiced she was thus freed freni the mere common¬ place conversation of our spmstei, though she gave hei credit for many more good qualités than she possessed, and was by no means aware of her insatiable curiosity, or of hei gossiping propensities but hav¬ ing finished her business, she drove off, and the master of the shop havuig made
his last bow, returned to inquire the com« mands of Miss Graham " My friend, lady Charley ille, seems to have been un excellent customer, Mr Wilkms'" " I only wish I had a few more of the same stamp, madam since, though I should scorn to ask her а farthing more than I do the poorest person who frequent« my shop, there is such a pleasure m serv. mg her The first time I had that advan. tage, she told me she alway s paid ready money, and that she should dial with me (who had been lecommended to her by Mrs Margram) as long as she felt con¬ vinced that I did her justice, I should therefore be greatly my own enemy, w ere I to endeavour to impose upon her She hag just paid me ten pounds, within a few shillings, which she has expended upon the little gnl you were admiring, Whom I understand she has taken under her pro¬ tection " " I only hope she will not set the child above herself I have heard a strange story D 2

CHAPTER II LiTTLr of moment occurred during the ensuing winter Oui hero continued Ins studies with his usual aidour—those con¬ nected with Ins future piofession, as w ell as those he pursued under Dr M irgram s auspices, generally spending Satin day ^ven nig and Sunday at the Abbey, vv liti t Anna Farnham w as become a gener il fav ountc, and who giatefully remembered that to him she was indebted for her introduction to lady Chorleville Mrs Bnckland had not been able to make any useful discoveries Henry ge¬ nerally made α point of seeing liei once a- week, by way of reuundiiig her ot her pHOmjse but she could only tell him Bnck¬ land drank more than ever, and was pro¬ portionably more savage still he always evaded entenng upon the subject of Anu ι, always cutting his wife short, if she men
tioned liti name, with an oath and a thanks¬ giving that they had washed 4ieir hands ot the little crocodile, who had fallen up¬ on her feet Sir Herbert, therefore, almost despaired of ever discovering whether she had any ι dations living, or was, as he some¬ times suspected, the natural child of some people of rank and property, who had placed her under Mrs Smith's care, pro bably with a sum of money to provide for her piesent and future wants, which mo¬ ney Bnckland had appropriated to his own use, and had, in conseemente, destroyed c\ ery ел idence of her birth I ady Charleville was inclined to believe his conjectures weie not л er> wide of the ti uth, but then, she observed, the child s patents must be no more no people who would have thought it necessary to make any provision for her maintenance, would hav e left her in the hands of the Brick- lands after Mrs Smith's death So thought Henrv, but months rolled on, and they continued as much in ignorance of Anna's family as they were when she became on minate of the Abbey
As the spring advanced, sir Herbert, whose health and persomi appearance were greatly improved smce Ins residence m Hampshire, cither ovving to the an, tho quiet hfe he led, or, as he was most in¬ clined to thmk, to lady Charleville s good nursing—be that as it may, he declared Ins intention of spending a couple of months m London, as he had some busi ness which required his presence there, and thought change of stene would be ot service even to her ladyship He therefore wrote to о friend to take lum a furnished houst m ι quiet situation which being done pait of the household were sent foi waid to prepare foi their reception and withm the week the baronet, hdy Chaile¬ ville, and Anna, attended by the domes¬ tics more immediately m their suite, left Hampshire, after taking a most aflection- ite leav e of our hero, whom they did not think proper to remove fiom under Di Margrams core, nor to sudi a distance from bis mihtary insti uctor and as their reasons f tie vtry conclusivi, he ielt no disappointment at not bemg mtluded m
the party, particularly as they assured him he should accompany them to town the next spring, by wlnth time sir Herbert thought he might venture to entrast hım with a pair of colours, though he did not wish he should be caliti! into attuai service till he had acquired rather moie expenence He my ftlt rather more impatience to enter upon his unlit iry caıeeı, but gave up to the nj er judgment of Ins guardian, nor did he teel it all jealom of their hav¬ ing made Anna the companion of then: journey—mdeed lit felt giatified at her not having been left in the care of servants, and at her thus having ti opportunity of continuing her musical and othei studies under lady Choileville's eyes nther hop¬ ing that she might remain a fixture m the family, as she already contributed to the amusement and comfort of sir Heibert, and as he advanced in years he would re¬ quire more attention, and be, perhaps, moie difficult to please Three men servants, and as mnv fe¬ males, constituted the estabhshin nt that were lelt in thaige ot the Abbev, under
the immediate superintendence of the head gardener, who lived in a neat house ad- joi nng tho kitchen-garden, and the gene¬ ral inspection of Mr Andrews Henry had been desired by sir Heibert to pay frequent visits, and had been left particularly m charge of the library, h ıv¬ mg been entrusted w ith the keys ot those bookcases which contained the most valu¬ able part of the selection, and he was to see that the room and the adjoining study were daily aired and ventilated he there¬ fore made it a rule to walk over every morning, as he generally mounted Ins horse there, and rode to Southampton, on tliose days he attended his riding and fencing master, and took a turn m the environs when more at leisure to pursue his own desires At those tunes Selby was often his companion, as he had sir Herbert's per¬ mission to provide lnm with a hoise Fiequently they took the road to Wal¬ ton, the dilapidated park and ruinous Go¬ thic mansion being among om hero's fa¬ vourite haunts Stlby supposed the house and estate w ould finally be sold to pay the
costs of *he Chancery sui;; at present, he understood, some of the claimants vvcre mere children, therefore probably а dozen years must elapse before the cause could be decided, adding, he should not like to plead in i tourt of equity, tliere was so httle room for eloquence Henry agreed to the justice of his re¬ maik, but presumed he would not dislike presiding m a tourt of equity " I am of opinion you will be a general before I slnll be ev en master of the rolls, though I shall enter upon my law career before you set out m search of glory, as I am, my fathei wntfs me, to be articled eaily m the ensuing year to counsellor -------- I am afiaid I shall find Coke and Lyttleton, Hales and Blackstone, very dry woik at first, but as I am resolved to per¬ severe, I hope you wdl give me a brief, should you ever have a lawsuit ' Henry gaily promised to encourage him, since, like Dr Mirgram, he felt assured his fnend would, like Ins father, proy e an ho¬ nour and an ornament to his profession About a month after sir Herbert had
left Hampshire, the annual fair lield in May at Southampton took place The doctor always permitted his pupils to visit it in the morning, but expressly forbade their even strolling thai way m the even¬ ing—there were so many sailors and sol¬ diers in the town, who when in liquor de¬ lighted m creating a not, which was sci dom quelled without bloodshed The young men were not indtned to infringe his orders therefore went over m the morning, and purchased fainngs for the Miss Margrams, Mrs Nelson and her daughters, and their other favourites, among whom our hero ranked Anna, Mrs Wal¬ lis, and Pennell, who, though in London, he had not forgotten nor was Santho over¬ looked, for whom he bought some ginger bread, which he divided between him and Frisk, a beautiful httle spaniel belonging to lady Charleville, wluth he had taken under his care, and had removed to Elm Grove, for the convenience of having him always undei his e) e Ο ι tins ev ening, the weather being rc markably hne, Henry and his friend ie-
solved to tokea strollm the Abbey grounds, not intending to go to the house, for fear the servants in charge might think they wero come as spies, to see whether they wera at home, or were enterttuning their friends, and our hero could not: bear the idea of appeal ing m so degrading a hght, or of breaking in upon the» amusements tbat they were trust-worthy he made no doubt, and, as Selby «aid, it was better not to seek to find them m fault. They therefoie, accompanied by Fnsk, entered by a pnvate gate, and proceeded among the shi ubbenes, till insensibly they came in sight of the back fiont ot the house As we have contrary to our intention, ι ambled this way, said Selby, " let us take tins read home, by way of а change '* I hove no objection, was the reply, when Trisk, perceiving one of the lower doors open, ran mto the house —" That wild little dog will oblige me to go in search of lum, and thus defeat my inten¬ tion of retreating unobserved " Well, never mind—oh ' here he comes ' Henry whistled him, and he ran to him,
barking as he advanced W ıs voice brought a female to the door who, seeing only the fnends, courtried and retreated, perceiving they were walking forward, Fnsk gambol¬ ing round them For the neirest tliey struck mto a shrubbery, whith belted an extensi» e lawn, broken heje and tliere by fine old oaks-, which were grouped to form a fine effect, and which looked particularly beautiful at this season and fust as the sun was sinking bejow tb» horizon they w ere adminng the scene when Frisk, who hod igain bounded off, in obedience to his masters wlnstlt, came ι mining towards them, when, making asudden stop he gav e two or three slurp barks, and then flew off m another áirettioii Henry who had kept his eye upon lum, fancied tliere must be some cause for the sort of signal ht hod given, and upon look ing veiy attentively, he perceived some¬ thing slime from within the shrubs He did not mention his discoveiy to Selby, sır Htrbert having often told lum that ι lence and presence of mind vvere the safe guards of а soldiei in the hour of dangei
he therefore saimteied forward, continuing Ins conversation with his friend, and was it last able to discern the feet of two men, who were extended all their length among the shiubs the nails on whose shoes had first caught his attention, by what he could see, concealed as they were, they had the appearance of sailors Instantly making up his mmd, he af¬ fected to be admiring the effect of the seti ting sun upon α Gothic temple, and thus unaffectedly turned his head from them as he passed, calling Frisk, and declaring he ou B ht to be corrected for frightening the gime Having proceeded thus slowly for a hundred yards or more, he whispered Sel¬ by — Let us mend our pace—I have my re isons They did so, Selby asking no explana¬ tion, while our hero, recollecting what he had suffered from the gipsey, kept a sharp look out, that he mijit not be taken by surprise At last tliey reached the door by which they meant to leave the pork, where Frisk
joined them, and no sooner had he locked tho door, than Henry told his friend whit he had seen, observing, the men could not hav e concealed themselves in such a place, and at such an hour, with any good inten tions, it was not the season, or he should have euBpeeted thoy were poachers, look¬ ing after game —" So now, counselloi, he continued, " let me hear what your supe nor wisdom will enable jou to suggest " I would venture to affirm they are suspicious people Shall we ıeturn to the Abbey, and put the servants upon their guard ' ' " Suppose w e first co ısıılt w ith Di Margram' rejoined oui hero " This being fair night at Southimpton, I should not wonder if the men-sen ants were gone thither we might therefore alaim the girls, vv ithout doing them or sir Heibert any material sei vice These fellows may be only part of ι gang, who may have it m contemplation to rob the house, if not murder the servants, so we ought not to act upon our own judgment, the doctor will point out the best method of defeating
the wretches purpose, and of bringing them to punishment Selby declared lie reasoned like an oracle and as they felt assured the wall which was now between them and the park must pre vent the men (admitting they roade the attempt) from seeing which way they went, they took to their heels, and ran all the way home, winch they leached just at dusk. The doctor was just come m from his evening walk, and tiaturally inquired why they had walked so fast, at the risk of over¬ heating their blood ? Henry instantly related where they had been whet they had seen, and how they had acted, requestmg the doctors advice as to then future proceedings. ' Unfortunately Mr Andrews is from home he went to Winchester yesterday, and d res not return till Monday the gar- dcnei is ten to one, at the fnr and so, I daresay, aie the other men this ought to be ascei tained, as at all events tliose at home ought to be put upon their guard voi n t
Briickenbiiry nnd Nesbitt, vrbo were present instantly volunteered their sei¬ vices to retum with Henry and Selby to the Abbey No proposal could have been more agree¬ able to om hem, who thought thcy ought to go armed The doctor put a decided negative upon this request, adding, m a gay tone— " Though Mr Brackcnbury may be deem¬ ed a young man, I shall no more trust him than you younger gentlemen with any deadly weapons, since I do not see the netessity of your attacking these fel¬ low s, and y ou may, With the best inten¬ tions m the world, do some serious mis¬ chief as yet, admitting tliem to be a gang, thoy cannot be assembled, still, that you may be prepared to act upon the de fcnsiv e, I vv ould advise your each provid¬ ing yourselves with a good stick as you will bo two to one, I shall not b° undtr mv ipprclitnsiom for your safety, besides, if lb y see you proteeding towards the house, and at this season the twilight may enable tlicm to do so, and no doubt they
are upon the watch, I think thcy will make good their retreat, and as the ser¬ vants will now be more than ever upon their guard, they will never have another opportunity of attempting the house But to give you my real opinion, I think you havo taken premature alarm, Pembroke, and that, after all, the men will cither tum out to be di unken sailors, who having sought shelter m the park, have fallen asleep, or sweetheai ts of some of the maids, who are waiting the signal of admittance ' Henry felt rathei piqued by the doctor s conclusion, therefore declared he would be satisfied before he returned " Do not be rash—proceed с uiliously, and do not strike a panic mto the sei v ants ' Having given these cautions, the doc¬ tor suffered the juvenile party to leave home, really thinking Henry had been de¬ ceived by some false appeuiances, or that the men he might have seen had no other ev il intention than to sedi cc oi cajole the maids, not being aware of the innate cou¬ rage of our hero, and his real strength, as c2
well as presence of mmd In his veracity he placed implicit forth, but still he fancied that his hvely imagination had, in the pre¬ sent instance, induced him to magnify the danger Mrs Mtaigram, who thought the y oung men should not have been suffered to go alone, was satisfied by his reasoning, and agreed that they ought not to be treated like children Meanwhile our youthful heroes gady pursued their way, having appointed the soldtei, as they styled Henry, commander- ln dnef, who chose to display his general¬ ship by entenng the park in the very op¬ posite direction to where he had seen the men lying he then cautiously led his band under the shade of the trees and shrubberies, till they reached a very con¬ venient spot for lying peidue withm ι hundred yards of the grand entrance, and yet commanding a very good view of the offices whicli were on that side Having assigned each one his place, Henry chose to reconnoitre with a night- glass he had brought from the dottor s,
dioosmg to deviate fiom the onginal plan ot proceeding unmtdiately to the house, lathei wishing the regnts (if such they were) might afford l un an opportunity ol displav ing his prov ess There w as a light m the hoiistkceptrsroom, where he pre¬ sumed the small household were assem¬ bled this he told Ins companions and ns the light remuned stationary, tliere evi¬ dently h id been no bustle, noi had any alaim been given, he therefore became anxious to ascertain whether any one was luvking vvrthoutside the house In less than fiv e minutes he plainly dis cerned some one creeping undei the win dow from whence the stream of light pro¬ teeded, this he toinmunicnted m а wins per to his companions, giving tht glass to belby, who pronounced the pirson to be а sailor, by lus driss—so said Brackenbury, upon taking the gliss Nesbitt next took .1 peep, ond he peiceived a second sulor advancing, w ho soon took his st ition near the first At this very moment the clouds having broke, they could all discern the men with the naked eye.

As it was probable the rogue might have done himself л mischief in his leap or fall, which had never occurred to our young men before, lantbarns were ordered, as the night was dark, that they might proceed to reconnoitre, and to see whether he was only stunned, unable to rise; or no more. As they were sallying forth from a glass door in the library, leading to the back lawn, one of the men recollected that α large stone roller had been left near the place where the man must have Allien. "Did not you mistake that fbr the thief?" asked Susan. Tbe men retorted, that they had not lost the use of their eyes ; and upon reaching the spot, the servants who carried tlie lan- thonis made α sudden pause, the groom ex¬ claiming, in a faltering voice—" There he lies." Henry pushed forward, and certainly there lay the man and the roller. His
fnends advanced, upon the groom declar¬ ing the man was as dead as a door nail, and almost stiff Upon a nearer examina¬ tion, it appeared evident, that in leaping down he had missed his hold, and fallen upon this immense stone roller, which must have killed him on the spot, as he lay within a yard of it What was now to be done? " The man seems to have saved us both a great deal of trouble and expence," said Selby, " by having so rashly ventured his neck Had he merely broken a limb, he must have been brought to tnal, and we must all have appeared as witnesses against him—no veiy pleasant business, when our evidence is sure to bnng a fellow-creature to the gallows but I now advise some¬ thing being thrown over him, and that these three men, who have not hitherto had much trouble, should watch by the body till daylight, and should his tompá¬ mon come m search of him, they must se¬ cure lum, till he can be properly commit¬ ted to jail " VOL II D

plause and as matters have turned out, the wretch was his own executioner ' " He has certainly saved the hangman trouble," rejoined Selby " Pembroke has proved himself a hero under his auspices I felt a wish to signalize myself, but I am now perfectly convinced ' that fighting is not my trade ' "Come, come, you did w onders, Selby, and so did my other fnends, and I own I feel more satisfied, since the rogue certain ly owes his death to the desperate leap he must have taken I know I disabled him, and here is his bludgeon, with whicli he would not have scrupled to have knocked me on the head ' "Not he,' resumed the doctor, "and had he struck you with this weapon, I thmk you would have been more than stunned Had any of the servants any idea who he is ·> ' " They did not appear to know lnm I hope he is one of those vagabonds who live by plunder, and are alwavs upon the look-out for opportunities to rob, if not D 2

the road to Wmchestei in another hour, when the doctor sent Henry to bed, not choosing to retire himself, as he proceeded at а very early hour to the Abbey, where he had appointed to meet Mr Andrews, who iode up to tlie house within а few minutes after his arrival, and agreed with the rector, that it had proved most fortu nate Henry had so properly taken the alarm, both bestowing the greatest eneo miums upon Ins conduct, as they learnt ν inous details from the inmds, which pro ved that to hnn alone all honour wos due The gardeners had early learnt the oc currences of the evening, and tlicy badali examined the corpse, but never remem¬ bered having seen the wretched man be¬ fore, nor liad Mr Andrews or Ins men any knowledge of hnn therefore having heard every necessary order given, the doc¬ tor returned home promising his pupils should be ready to attend the coroner as soon as he arrived

Henry did not feel satisfied Why had he never before heard that Ins father had been in the aimy, since he had evidently been a brave man ?—where had he served and where had he died' were questions he was very anxious to havt resolved, but he peiteived that sir Herbert shrunk Irom the subject, as weeks elapsed without any opportunity offenng to renew it 'lo optn his mind upon so dehcate a matter, even to Selby, he did not approve, since to ac knowledge the humiliating doubts he en¬ tertained would be a very severe shock to his feelings, and, after all, why should he seek to dive mto his family secrets' The open protection of sn Herbert Charleville would have due weight with the multi¬ tude, and many illegitimate children had risen to the greatest honours thus urged reason and prudence—but curiosity, and a sort of indefinite dread that he had no rea¬ son to boast of his descent, rendered him very anxious to be better acquainted with his parents While he was thus perplexing himself with doubts no one seemed inclined to re
solve, lady Charleville received an anony¬ mous letter, which, had it fallen into the hands of some wives, would have occa¬ sioned not only a violent quarrel, but per¬ haps a separation between them and their husbands The baronet was gone to Win¬ chester preparatory to the assizes, having been nominated one ot the grand jury Henry had accompanied hnn, as tlit y pro¬ posed taking a commodious lodging for the time, Selbys father being expected down to plead in a very important cause, and they meant that his son should be their inmate and on the very morning they left home, meaning to return in the evening, the letter already mentioned was left at the house by a stranger, with orders to deliver it to lady Clnrlevdle Not having many correspondents, her ladyship was rathei surpnsed, when it came across her, while breaking the seal, it might be wntten by some fnend of Anna Farnham's, as she had for some time expected, if any person felt themselves in¬ terested in her welfare, they would ad¬ dress her for information, as the more she
knew and saw of the child, the less in¬ clined she felt to think her of mean ex¬ traction She was unacquainted with the wnting, and was more amazed at the con¬ tents " MADAM, " A fnend to virtue and to you thinks it necessary to open your eyes, if, as he suspects, you are not aware of haV4 ing been the dupe of sir Herbert Charle¬ ville and his youthful Machiavehan ward, who has entered mto all his plans, and se¬ conded all his meisuies to deceive you suffice it to say, Anna Farnham is the na¬ tural child of the baronet, who sent her home at an early age, to be educated in England, and by the Mrs Smith lately deceased Had she lived, probably she would at some future period have been imposed upon you as a second ward, but her death (rave birth to the scheme which placed her under your protection Bnek land knew nothing, therefore could not ïeveal any thing his wife played her part to admiration—so did Mr Pembroke, who

She therefore finally decided to lock up the letter, and never to revert to the con tents, but to be more kind than ever to her now favounte protegee Time might enable her to discover the writer, who would learn from her conduct what little faith she placed in his assertions, never theless, so prone is human nature to doubt, thot she could not help that very afternoon questioning Anna respecting her first meet¬ ing y/ith Pembroke
The Childs answers were so satisfactory, and it was so evident that she had spent upwards of fourteen months with the Bncklands, her ladyship felt perfectly sa¬ tisfied , since, had she been even known to the baronet, or had Mrs Smith been ac quainted with him, she would have com. mitted her to his core when she died be sides, the hints respecting Henry Pern. broke vv ere convincing proofs that her cor¬ respondent did not pay much regard to tiuth, she therefore resolved to preserve his letter, and should hc again address her, to place the correspondence before sir Her¬ bert, feeling a hamcd at having cv en for a moment supposed he had ey er meant to deceive, since, had Anna really been his child, she was bound in honoui and grati tude to cherish her as her ow n That he should therefore hav e had recom se to suli- terfuge to mduce hei to receiv e her, was too absurd to deseive a thought, particularly is Henry Pembroke, who vv os open to а fault, vv as accused of being hiš occomphce Still she felt hurt it the certainty thot vol it г
there was some peison onxious to render her unhopp), as they might attack hei m a more vulnerable part, since their pro¬ fessed regard savoured much more of deadly enmity, she therefore resolved to be stnctly upon her guard, hoping she might in tune discover this concealed enemy, vvho dared not openly traduce sir Herbert, therefore had recourse to such base means to lower him in her esteem
CHAPPLR V At the appointed time sir Herbert, our hero, and Selby, proceeded to Wmchestei Sergeant Selby had preceded tlicm thither, but had very little time to devote to their society, being obhged to associate with the other members of the bar, and having muth to discuss with the solicitor m the cause he was come to support, still he paid due respect to sir Herbert, and was kmdly attentive to Henry, whom he very
cordially invited to spend a month with George in London We shall not dwell upon the usual rou¬ tine of business attendant upon the assizes, since mirth seems the order of the day among the spectators and occasional visi- tors, while terror, anxiety, and misery, are the portion of the wretched pnsoners The judges made their entrée in the usual form __the sheriff displayed his taste and elegance^—the grand jury soon performed their duty—and the following day ser¬ geant Selby astonished the court, tlie mul¬ titude, and the petty jury, by lus very su¬ penor eloquence and perfect knowledge of the law, and he had the satisfaction of fully establishing a will which vested a very large property in a very worthy fa¬ mily Never liad sır Herbert felt more inte- rested, nor more satisfied than when the jury pronounced their verdict in favour of the sergeant s client George only hoped he should one day equal his father—to sur paes livra he conceived impossible while ί Ζ
Henry declared, that, like Tangent, he was h ilf inclined to give up the army foi the law Sir Herbert, whose health would not yet allow him to dedicate his evenings to convivial parties, was extremely amused by their remarks hoping that Geoige an ticipated the honours of the woolsatk The sergeant was obliged to proceed with all possible expedition to Busto], wher» he had also a cause he therefore took a po¬ lite leave of the baronet and Henry, and a vei y affectionate one of his son, who was, at the expiration oí the long ν acation to be plated with the gentleman who was to ground him in the theory of the law I he following day our young gentlemen agam attended the tourt, whert the more criminal causes wire now bung tned, w hen a woman was put to the bar, accused of ha\ mg robbed a gentleman s house m the immediate vicinity of а large quantity of plate dunng the preceding wetk It appeared Irom the tvidence, that the worn m a sort of stiolhng gipsev, hid in dated two female servants, by having told
their fortunes, to repair to a certain stile in the dusk of the evening, where they were to meet n young mnn, whom she minutely described, who was destined to in trry one ol them—the stai s did not allow her to say wluth, nor to be more c\phtit. 'ihe family being Irom home, she thus availed heiself ot the cieduhty of two simpletons,yv ho waited at the stile till thur patitine bemg quite exhausted, the) ic t irned, woefully disappointed, and to ılıtır great dismav discov ertd the house had been plundered, dunng then absence, ot' the plate and valuables mentioned in the indictment The house must have been entered by a picklock 01 skeleton key, as thcy swore positively to having fastened all the windows and locked all the doois, »nd on their ıeturn thcy found the fiont dooi a jar Hav пц uninediately giv en the alırın, the gai de ncr and some neighbouis set out m pursuit of the thieves, their sus¬ picions hiving immediately fallen upon the fortunetellu and her gang So little time had elapsed belore the hue and crv went forth, that the woman was taken ш
less than two hours, with all the propeity \ipon her. The evidence against her being closed, she was asked what she bad to say in her own defence? Henry, who had been so situated as not to have a perfect view of the prisoner, was, at this very critical moment, enabled to take a front seat, from the person who had previously occupied it being called out of court. The mention of a strolling gipsey and fortuneteller had rather ex- cited his curiosity, and he now fixed his eyes upon the poor agitated wretch, whose tears prevented her from replying to the judge, who, in milder accents, conceiving she was a real penitent, repeated his ques¬ tion. The moment she raised her eyes, she chanced to fix them upon our hero. Ut¬ tering a scream of eitlier joy or terror, she fell upon her knees, exclaiming—" Oh sir! for God's sake have pity upon me!— Vtay try to save iny life—pray tell my lord and the gentlemen of the jury----- "
Her voice failed, and she sunk down in 1 sw ООП 'lhe eyes of the whole court were now tinned upon our hero, who stood ti ms fixed, haidly knowing what to btluvt or vvlnt the woman me mt, while eveiy pio per mcins weie resorted to, Io Iustin hei iceovciy lhe fudge sked the amazed Ilcnry whether he had any knowledge or lecol- ltction of the unfortunate pnsouei ' " I am positively at a loss to answer your loidship, replied Henry, regaining his self possession " bei having so unex¬ pectedly recognized me has induced me to suspect vve have met before, under equally stringe tireumstancts Having heard what passed, though un able to speak, the prisonei made α motion with her hand Geneial silence ensued for tialf α minute or more w hen bemg rused by those who had been assisting her, she ogam fixed her eyes upon Pembroke, and pointing to the scar or maikon his temple—" You must be the youth whose

were unable to bnng m any ether verdict than guilty, but strongly recommended her to the clemency of the crown, as did the prosecutor, who declared, that had he been aware she was such an extraordinary com pound of vice and virtue, he would not have appeared against her The judge promised to attend to their recommendation, she was therefore led out of court, with every hope of her sen¬ tence bemg commuted to transportation hn Herbert and Henry followed her, the former assunng her he would influente the grand juiy to join in the petition for mercy—the latter, desiring her to keep up her spirits, offering her money for her im¬ mediate support She declined his kindness with many thanks, and was still more gratified by his promising to see her the next day, as she called down blessings upon them when tliey parted, and in bitterness of spirit cursed the hand that had so nearly de¬ pnved our hero of existence The baronet felt assuied the wretched woman s life would be spared, dec'armg
he felt happy at their thus having it in their powei to convince her tliat a good action never lemains unrewaided, and as every person who had heard of the cir¬ cumstance were ready to join in the peti¬ tion to the throne, Henry thought it might in the end prove a fortunate event for the poor creature, since her vile husband would not follow her to Botany Bay
CHAFľĽR VI The next mornmg he proceeded to the jail, the baronet thinking the woman would be more unreserved if he went alone, and his humanity rendered him anxious to learn what had become ofthe children she had with her at the time Henry was hei inmite His having spoken so openly and so kindly in her favour wis so generally known, Pembroke was immediately con ducted to her cell The moment she saw lnm, she fell at his feet, seizing one ot his

THE VEILED PROTECTRESS. wretched woman was, as Ъе hod before thought; the strangest compound of vice and folly, combined with a strong sense of feeling, as sbe appeared to abhor the very crime she had committed : What a differ¬ ent character bhe might have proved, had she had the.edrly benefit of good example and a decent education! Most sincerely did he pity her, and most truly did he grieve that it had fallen to his lot to tell her when and where her wretched husband had breathed his Last. " Cannot you guess," he at last said, " that the row the man in Dover Castle alluded to did not terminate favourably for your husband ? Nothing, as you very justly observe, was to be a warn¬ ing to lnm. But not to keep you in so painful a state of suspense, I will be brief," recapitulating, m a very few words, what the reader is already acquainted with, add¬ ing—" and to this moment no one knows who or what he was ; I only wonder his accomplice did not come forward to claim the offered reward." The wietched wife, who was shaking in F 3
every limb, fell apon hen knees; exclaim¬ ing—" It did indeed coma home to him ! Providence ordain ed-he should Stilar victim· to his despair.

" Most certainty," rejoined our hero; "and ytra ca» e*ily grieve at his not having time allowed Ыш för repentance-; so com¬ pose yourself, and tell me where your chil¬ dren now- are?

" I trust your prayers will be heard. So where ore your children? I repeat " " Somewhere in the neighbourhood, I make no doubt, as my companion has doubtless waited the event of my trial, and she may now mean to set off to some dis¬ tant part of the kingdom, for fear ot being taken up as an accomplice—her dread of that will prevent her coming to see me. She has no children, so she will probably call herself the mother of mme, indeed she has often sworn she would, should any thing befall me I dare say she left them at a distance y es tei day, while she was m court she knows as well as I do how to disguise herself As I was found guilty, and the sentence will be pronounced to day, I should not wonder if she is there again " " Endeavour to descnbe her person, mid give me some message or token to deliver, as from yourself She must know me for your fnend, and I feel assured, that if you will dolm your children, I can become an¬ swerable foi then being brought up m the

CHAPTER VII.
Henry foimd no difficulty in discovering the gipsey's frţend, to whom he made him¬ self known, as had been concerted', and as he also told her that he was tlie youth whose life the prisojier had formerly pre¬ served, displaying his scar, she made no difficulty p) promising to bring the chil¬ dren tlie pe-xt morning to a spot she point¬ ed out in the vicinity ofthe pi ison, where he might receive and condvţct them, ta their niothpr. Sir Herbert, who hod beep told all that had past during our hero's interview with his former nurse, highly applauded the prorniscs he had made her, which he would
undertake should be punctually felnlleí, as he hid resolved, when informed of Ihe father's death, to provide for his family, promising to see the gipsey the next morn·· ing, to tell her so. Sentence was passed u port all the prisoner» that afternoon, when she was of course cast for death, but reprieved during pleaeure- before the judge left the town, who as¬ sured sir Herbert that he should so sirénu* ously support his endeavours, he made no> doubt of her merely being transported foe seven years ; and as that would only prove imprisonment on board the hulks, she might, by her penitence and good beha¬ viour, shorten the term of her prdbation. Henry, whose humanity had never beer» more strongly engaged, waited upon her, accoiding to promise, with the gratifying intelligence. The poor creature faintcrl fiom excess of joy, well aware that she hatt been, thanks to him and his friends, most wonderfully favoured; she was scarcely less rejoiced at the idea of again seeing heť childien, who w ould thus be truly snatched P-8 · -
from perdition Nor was Henry, who could not help fancying he had hastened her husbands death, and thus driven her to despair, lqss gratified Sir Herbert would not admit that he had been any other than an agent of Pro vidence in the occui ι enees at the Abbey, he might as well, in future, fancy himself guilty of murder if he struck dow n lus foes in battle Selby thought it was, upon the whole, a very fortunate circumstance the savage wretch had terminated his existence, since his wife would now forsake hei formei evil couises, ind the children might f m out useful members of society He accompa med the baronet to the pnson the next morning, while Hemy give the othu wo¬ man the meeting, who readily suflered hnn to leid away the chil'ren, asking where she should wait for them ' " Λ ou neid not troubli ) ourself any far¬ ther,' wasthereplv, ' as su Herbert Char¬ leville will henceforth take charge of these poor infants ' She seemed very much disappointed, but
dared not remonstrate, and as he gave her a trifle, she prudently departed in peace, while he proceeded to the jail with his young companions , Sir Herbert had arranged with the jailor, that they should, for the present, remain with their mother, when she left Win¬ chester, he meant to send them to different and distant cheap schools, yvhere they might b» taught all that it was necessary for t v ein to know, and where they might f л -get then origin and eaily modes of life This he told the mother, who fell at hia feet, and gratitude rendenng her eloquent,. she surprised the bironet by her choice ot w ords , should she live to see them earning their bread honestly, she should fancy she had a foretaste of Heaven- When Pembroke entered with the chil¬ dren, she seemed to forget there were any witnesses of hei transports, till turning to the worthy baronet, she said, while em¬ bracing her son—" Oh, sir, this is a child after my own heart, he will do every thmg he is desired, he has a feeling heart, and would not hurt α worm, he has frequent-
ly wept upon seeing a donkey beat, he may be led to do any thing and every thing, but hş will not be driven I thmk it my duty to give you an insight into his natural disposition ' The child she thus recommended was not so brown as the generality of those be¬ longing to these vagrants, while his dark eyes beamed with intelligence Sir Her¬ bert asked him several questions, his an¬ swers were modest, respectful, and much to the purpose The girl seemed of a less amiable disposition, but as she was sturdy and stout of her age, the baronet thought she would make a good useful servant as si'«; grew older but having made every necessary arrangement for the poor wo¬ man s tomfort, and for providing the chil¬ dren with some decent clothes, he left the pnson with his companions, followed by the prayers and blessings of both mother and children Itwas soon known atChanng wh it had oc* curred dunng the assizes, and many people thought it almost miraculous that the man who had so neaily killed our hero, should
in the end expiate his crime in so strange a manner, nor was it less surprising that Henry should have been able, in his turn, to save the life of his wretched wife Mrs. Hoskms merely observed, that one good turn deserves another—though had Pem¬ broke been killed, and the woman been hanged, no one would have felt the miss of them And when it was afterwards reported that the baronet had promised to place the gipsey children in some of the public chanties to which he was a subscri¬ ber, she was only surpnsed he did not found an establishment for such sort of riff¬ raff—he had better receive them at once at the Abbey, и here the other bttle bastard was becoming a fine lady—in time he might recruit his household with such sort of casualties The Frogmores and she could not compare notes, their last quarrel having been too serious, but they were not а whit moie charitable m their conjectures or dis. course Miss Graham happened to have her mind diverted from the baronet s philanthropy by a rather unexpected visit from a formée
suitor, with whom she had been upon the very point of marriage some twenty years before He was the son ofa coal merchant at Southampton, and report affirmed that even the wedding day had been fixed—at all events, the bndal pai iplieinaha was nearly read), when unfortunate!), ow ing to Mr Cummings having a very high opi¬ nion of himself, and Mi's Gı ahım hivmg long hid a w ill of her own, they quai relied about putting up a thimneypiete m a house that was fitting up for then ìecep¬ tion, whicli belonged to the hdv s lather, and w luth, w ith the surrounding fai ni he intended to bestow upon his daughter in marnage Mr Cummings ventured to diffei from both Mr Graham and his hnde- elett—the former did not thoose to be dic- tited to bv a boy, and the lady went so far as to declare that she would пел er spe tk to hım agam, except he made proper apo¬ logies '1 lie lover did not leel inclined to humble, he theiefore departed for London the next morning, without even taking leave, or letting any one know и hen lie meant to return
Whether Miss Graham made any rash vow in consequence of his defection, we shall not venture to affirm but it is al ready known that she still remained a spin ster at the age of fort) seven, and was re ported to be in receipt of between hv e and six hundred pounds per annum, uising from landed propert) m and neai Charing Mr CuminuiLS was, soon after their breach, taken into partnership by a friend of his fither s in London who was in the same line, ahd vv hose daughter lit ıfteı woids married She was reported to have had an independent fortune oi twelve thou sand pounds lit that us it may he brought her down а bride to Southampton, wheie she displa) ed heiself and her finery, greatly to the mortification of our villige belle Hei father did not long survive her mar¬ nage, and report now magnified tht hus¬ band s foitune into tens of thousands Of course no inttrtourse had taken place between lum and his former mistress, and she would have told any one who had ask¬ ed hei the question, that no one was far¬ ther from her thoughts than Cummings
the coal merchant, till during the spring of this very year she read the death of his wife in a London paper, and she was soon after told by a Southampton friend, who was in the habit of visiting this great mer¬ chant, that she was generally uppermost In his thoughts, and often the theme of his discourse—nay, he had repeatedly heard him severely blome himself for not having humbled himself before her superior judg¬ ment Miss Graham condescended to acknow¬ ledge they had both been to blame, utter¬ ing several more indirect avowals of her constancy Whother Mr Cummings thought she liad gamed m wisdom what she had lost in beauty, we cannot say—suffice, that he came down to Southampton dunng the assize week, and was again admitted to visit his former mistress, who thought he was wonderfully improved m pointof man ners, as he never ventured to eontradiet her, and appeared only to exist in her company 'lho fair lady was therefoie very httle interested m the borenets elitu
rit-iblc actions, though she felt very anxi¬ ous to exhibit her beau to all hei Charmg fnends, yet she felt inchned to look down upon the Hoskmses, and had entirely cut with the Trogmores, who, she under. stood, Ind turned her into ridicule behind her bick, as an amorous old fool, with some hints very derogatory to her lover s sincerity, since it w as soon generally ып- îmsed tint Mr Cummings had renewed l.is addresses Dottor Margram thought, if she did intend to marry, she tould not do bet¬ ter '1 he Medhcotts saw no objection to the match—it was nothing uncommon for either a inan 01 a woman to retui n to their c-uly choice bir Heibert and hdy Charleville, when told ot the repoit« by Mrs Margiam, wished her happy, though the biionet doubted w hether she would either increase her fthtity or her propeity, but agietcl that in such cases every one ought to please thcinsch es The Hoskinscs weie not so indulgent, and tjiey pronounced t iimnungs a deep one, и ho wished to finger her money, and wha

to the satisfaction of Pembroke, who fre¬ quently, w hile lamenting to sir Herbert the impossibility there appeared of fathoming the my stery attached to her birth, threw out hints respecting his own ignorance oflus family, butali in vain—the baronet either did not, or w ould not, understand his mean¬ ing, though eath succeeding day our heio became more anxious to induce Imn to enter mto some more satisfactory explana tion respecting his parents than he had hitherto done At Michaelmas Geoige Selby was to leav e Llm Grove Henry stood engaged to pay lnm a visit m the spring, in rtturn for tht many favours sir Herbert and lady С hiirleville had conferred upon him since they had resided in the Abbey, whither lie daily bent his s'cps with his fnend, when the weathei pcimiUid One morn¬ ing, when they paid thur usual visit, they wire told the baionet and his lady wire walking in the grounds ' And where isAnn ť inquired Henry ' In htr work room, I behtve, sir " 'I hen I will ask her how she does, and
give her this book I promised her, lead¬ ing the way to the apartment m question The door was а -jar, they softly ap¬ proached, and saw ber in a glass nearly opposite practising vanous Scotch steps, as she threw а «kipping rope gracefully over her head " She is a most elegant little creature, ' he whispered Stlby , " but we will not dis¬ turb her,' slowly retreating, fearful of alarming her, if, as he supposed, she was dancing by ste ilth They met sir Htrbert and his 1 idy re¬ turning to the house, who asked if they liad setn Auna I Henry explained why he h id not dis¬ turbed her " Yon were very considerate, ' replied her ladyship " I wish her to practise dancing, and throw ing a skipping rope improves the figure A governess ought to be very giaceful though the more I see and know of her, the less I feel inclined to pait with her therefore I think she vv ill continue my companion " She ceitainly is a most wonderful
child," said the baronet " how many of her nge, and treated as she has been, w ould have foigotten all they had ltanit m four¬ teen months? but she never failed to prac- tise her Scotch and Irish steps whenever she hod an opportunity, and she generally committed to memory every scrap ot print¬ ed pnpei that fell m lier way" " She Often amuses me by repeating what she thus leanit, ' rejoined her lady¬ ship, " and she now leads remarkably well foi her age—indeed, she has so good an ear and so sweet a voice, that I flatter my¬ self she will prove an excellent musician " Sir Herbert was no less lavish in her praise, and Henry, far fiom being jealous of her growing favour, was delighted to find she was likely to prove such a source of amusement to them both
CHAPTER VIII MicHAPni is at last arrived, and early in October George Selby left Elm Grove The fnends agreed to correspond, and nei ther the baronet nor lady Charleville were surprised at Henry's apparent want of spi¬ nte , but a month having elapsed yv ithout his regaining his usual vivacity, since each succeeding day appeared to render him more thoughtful, though not less attentiv e to his studies or military exercises, the baronet thought it necessary to reason with lnm upon thus suffenng his separation from his fnend to prey upon his mmd, ob¬ serving that fortitude made part of a sol¬ dier's creed had Selby been sent abroad, there might have been the shadow of an excuse for his soirow, but to grieve thus because they were destined not to inhabit the same house, was displaying a degree of weakness he (sir Herbert) hod not expected
he would have evinced Had he altered his mmd respecting his future profession ' should he prefer studying for the law ? Henry acknowledged he regretted Selby, but would not allow that his spirits vvere at all depressed and m reply to the baro nets last question, assured lum he had no wish to exchange a red coat for a gown ind w ig Su Herbert was more satisfied, as for a time Pembroke resumed his accustomed vivacity, still he came less frequently to the Abbey, and did not apptar so fond of ndmg is foimeily again sir Herbert took the alarm, and now thought it necessaiy to question Dr Margram '1 lie lettor w is particularly attathed to his pupil, therefore had made the same ι emarks and now told the baronet, m con fidtnce, he thought the young man did not feel quite satisfied respecting his fa¬ mily—he often threw out hints to that effect " Could I have spoken in praise of his father, doctoi, I should have entered more into details. He will never be acknow-
ledged by hts paternal relatives—he has none living on his mother's side. But surely these are recent doubts, which seem to have unhinged him. I had hoped he felt satisfied, as I cannot, without violat¬ ing a saerea promise, set his mind at case. This I feel it right to say—he was born in Wedlock, and his mother was a most ex¬ emplary woman." The doctor had had his doubts, like his pupil, nor were they entirely removed; but sir Herbert had shut his mouth ·, he therefore merely said—" I may repeat to him, should an opportunity offer, what you have now told me, I presume? I think it will raise his spirits." " I trust implicitly to your better judg¬ ment, doctor : were it possible, I should fancy some Incendiary had been at work, and who has infused into his mind the doubts you think he entertains, for some sinister purpose." " He has neither friends nor acquaint¬ ance out of Charing," resumed the doctor; " he merely goes to Southampton to pur- site his military exercises."
" Has he made an acquaintance with any of the officers m that regiment of dra¬ goons?' " Not that I have heard him mention, noi does he make any stay to induce me to suppose he bas formed an intimacy— shall I put the question to him? ' " Perliaps you had better not, and per¬ haps the less we appear to notice the de¬ pression of his spmts, the sooner he will shake it off Should it arise from his ig¬ norance respecting his family, your com¬ munications may remove it—should it ori¬ ginate in any imprudence of his own, let him acknowledge his errors, and we will extend the olive brandi I do not expect peifeition m youth Ihus the lector indins patron parted— the 1 itter resolving to treat Henry with ippaicnt mdvfteience, though he felt ex ticmely anxious to leain what had so stiangely altei cd his disposition, having (which he did not choose to acknowledge, cither to the rector or lady Charleville) re¬ ceived two verv short anonymous letters, voi и a

unknow n correspondent, who, he now sus¬ pected, merely meant to make mischief The following day Henry came to the Abbey, and met with an unusual kind re¬ ception The baronet reproached him for not giving his hoise more exercise, he agreed that in cold weather he preferred walking, but mounted him now to oblige sir Herbert, to whom he again paid his respects w hen he brought the horse home, relating where le had been, and what he had seen 'lhe duv s wire so short, that he excused himself fiom staying dmnei, Dr Maigram having a part) m the even¬ ing, w luth he w as expected to join " 1Л ell, do as you like, said the baro¬ net, "but suppose you walk over again in the moining' The hounds are expected to be in this neighbourhood, and I should enjoy seeing, it not joining the hunt, so I shall expect you at eleven Our lino promised to attend him, and having soon dispatched his mornmg stu¬ dies, walked ovei at the time appointed, having come to ι ι esolution which he a 2
thought would m a great measure deude lus future fate The baronet wis alone m his study, and, contrary to his expectations, still m his slippers, though the weather was very fa vourable for the season and for hunting Henry paid his respects as usual, inquired after lady Charleville nnd Anna, and then, looking at the baronets slippers, said— " \ on seem, sir, to have given up the idea of ndmg this morning " I have, but th it need not prevent your pirtaking ot tbe diversion I was told, not five minutes since, that the hounds were running through Walton You may take iny horse, as your own is unfit for use There was a degree of coldness and of displeasure in the baronet s manners and speeth, that completely roused our hero out of his general apathy—" What had befallen his horse' he wondered but not choosing to ask, he merely said—" I must request I may not depnve you of your hoise, sir Herbert, mine was in excellent heart and condition yesterday
" I dare say he might,' coolly replied the baronet, " but as you must know he either fell, or you threw him down and broke Ins knees, I cannot suppose it would be cither safe or decent to nde him a hunt¬ ing to-day, and it is whot I shall not suffer )ou to do Why did not you mention the encumstance last night, when I pro¬ posed ndmg out with you ' But this ill tuned reserve is of a piece with your late conduct, your gaiety has fled with your innocence, I am now indined to believe, and your former Irankness of heart hns also deserted you I am no longer to be deceived, young man, and I accuse y ou of having formed some improper tonnexion, which you are ashamed to acknowledge, therefore be candľd, if you wish to retain my favour—I may yet be inchned to over¬ look your errors, if they are instantly ac¬ knowledged , but beware of trifling with me ' Ntver had our hero been more surprised To be thus unexpectedly aiciised almost of enmes—smce deception, falsehood, and .having kept bad company, certainly came

inquired when and how the animal had met with the misfortune, when the men assured me they did not even know he had been down, till a few minutes before I saw them examining lnm the horse had not been out since you brought him home, it was therefoie veiy evident with whom the blame rested The man who cleaned him had not made the discovery overnight, though he lecollected his hav¬ ing winced while he was rubbing lnm down with а wisp of straw So, in the first place, please to tell me when, where, and how you threw hnn down, wewill then proceed to elucidate the oţhei- parts of your conduct, which I have taken the liberty to condemn " Henry, who now stood armed with con¬ scious innocence, felt unusually bold ; he thought himself ill treated and grossly wronged, he therefore merely said—" Thé horse was perfectly sound, sir Herbert,when I delivered hnn up last night to the groom, and were I intimed to tuin the tables up¬ on you, instead of answering your other questions, I should put some m my turn,
which you would be more puzzled to an- swer, to mine or your own satisfaction when you feel convinced that you have wronged me in the fust instance, vou will be m a happier frame of mind to listen to or to enter upon any explanations, there fore I shall, for the present take niy leave merely hinting that should I have been guilty of an) deception, I can plead ex¬ ample in excuse, leav mg the room, and the baronet standing aghast with surprise, and more inclined to blame himself than lus petulant ward He had eagerly seized what he thought а most excellent opportunity of coming to an explanation with hnn, but had totallv failed in the attempt, having even made bad worse tliere were some very unplea sant truths conveyed m Henry s retorts some vile incendiary must have poisoned his mmd—his anonymous correspondent as likely as any one—such wretches gene rally played a double game He had cer¬ tainly believed Henry had thrown the horse down, which might have been very accidental lie had begun too violenti) , as
he now could not suppose he was aware of the circumstance—Dr Margram had the highest opinion of his veracity, and he had never known him guilty of a falsehood Then agam, if the horse had not fallen with lnm, who else could have been ndmg lum ? Had the ammal slipped dow n in coming out or going into the stable, he could not have been so senously injured, he must have fallen among some v ery sharp stones—nay, there was gravel remaining m the cuts He sent for the coachman and grooms, they all declared no one had mounted the hors- since Mr Pembroke had brought him home the day befoie He did not know what to believe, nor how to act, when lady Charleville, who had like lum anticipated the happiest re¬ sults from his interview with Ins ward, joined him Hoping the best, the baronet did not choose to tell her all that had past, contenting himself with saying Henry stoutly denied having injured the horse, and had felt offended by his accusations Possibly her ladyship might think too G 3
much stress had been laid upon what sur Herbert would not even have noticed a month before, but she now merely observ¬ ed, the truth must soon be known, ac¬ knowledging she felt mthned to acquit Pembroke, since he ivas humane almost to a fault, and could not have dieaded a repnmand, had he told the men what had occurred when he came home, she feaied they had been too hasty " I am convinced I have been so,' re¬ plied the generous baronet, ever ıeady to acknowledge his errors, " I could not hav e supposed I should have had so little tom¬ mand of my temper, I suffered prejudice to warp my judgment, and my defeat was the ıesult but I vow I will have tht mat¬ tei cleared up—I would give a hundred guineas to any one vv ho could remove my doubts ' " Dont let us be too hasty,* resumed hei ladyship, " а shoit time may vindicate poor Henry, who was, I can suppose, deep¬ ly hurt by youi suspicions, if he was not to blame—if hc is, let him pay the full penalty of his falsehood "
" I feel assured he spoke the truth, Llien, and I shall not feel easy till we are reconciled " No notice was taken before Anna, who nevertheless hearf from Penndl that she was sure Mr Pembroke had not thrown down the horse—the grooms deserved to be punished for saying so and no one felt more convinced of his innocence than this grateful and now happy orphan

Гнь ev ening closed in witboi t an) thmg having transi ired respecting the injured horse Iwice had sir Herbert wished to have sent Ibi Henrj, but lady Charleville thought he had better be more au fait of the business before he made excuses, agree¬ ing that the moie she reflected, the moie she felt inclined to exonerate Henry rhe horse was become a minoi consideration with the baronet, so anxious did he feel to
havs Ins ward's implied reproaches ex¬ plained, as he began to fear his domestic happiness was menaced from the only quar¬ ter likely to disturb Ins peace When he retired for the night, he told his valet, who had been many years attach¬ ed to his person, that he was very anxious to be at the bottom of what he now deem¬ ed a mysterious occurrence—namely, the horse having been throw n down, desinng him to devise some mide to discover the real truth, as if for his own satisfaction, since he now recollected that Mi Pem¬ broke had returned the day before to the Abbey before daik, therefore how came the grooms not to have perceived vvhat had happened ? If the stable peo¡ 'e wtre in a le igue to deceive lum, he would shew them no mercy Turner thought it very unlikely Mr Pembroke was to blame, as he felt assured he would not have concealed the circum¬ stance , the horse was his own, theiefore he would be the loser In short, he rea¬ soned, thought tbe baronet, mnth more to the purp ise than he had done—nay, but
for the anonymous letters, he felt he should have proceeded very differently Never did he pass a more sleepless night, nor did lady Charleville, though she was ignorant of many of the causes of bis un easiness, sleep much better, it was there¬ fore late when they sat down to breakfast Anna was waiting their coming down, but her pale cheeks and red eyes shewed that she was not in а much happier frame of mind Lady Chaileville pressed her to her bosom, but made no ıemarks sır Her¬ bert read the papers therefore little past, till, upon looking ιφ, lady Charlevdlt saw Dr Margram s colili driving round the sweep—" Here comes Mrs Margram,' she exclaimed " She never was more welcome," replied sir Herbert 1 he visitor was shewn m, and having paid the mormng compliments, cast her e)es round the room, as if m search of some other person The baronet felt his heart sink an inde¬ finable dread came across him, which pre¬ vinted him from speaking, while the more

lloceiving ho answer, slie proceeded— " He left home yesterday morning, about half past ten, telling the doctor he was go¬ mg a hunting watli you, sir Herbert, and desiring tıs not to expect him till v, e saw him, we therefore concluded he had slept here, but were rather surpnsed he did not, as he invariably had done, return to break¬ fast In shoit, the dottor, not feeling quite easy, dispatched tne m quest of in¬ telligence 1 " " I alone am to blame for all that has occurred," said the baronet " He is a high-spirited youth, and I am afraid I have accused him wrongfully ' Afilli explanatun now took place, lady Charleville appeanng to have recovei ed the shock the fiist intelligence of Penibioke being missing had given her, yet neither of the three, Anna having been dismissed, either knew what to advise, or how to pio¬ ceed Mrs Margram gave it as her de¬ cided opinion, that something preyed upon his mmd, he had of late been moie stu¬ dious than ever, very averse to society, and not even a punctual correspondent to
Selby Dr Margram had continually urged hım to devote more time to recrea tion but he seemed to have lost all relish for pleasure and was become subject to fits of abstraction which reallv alanned her for Ins intellects but the doctor lough ed at those fears aflirmmg that they vv ere perfectly sane as was his mind, w hich was merely disturbed The baronet hod neVer before supposed Hurry had been so much altered in v un he sought α clue tothisincreosingmysteiy— the more he reflected the more perplexed he becalm ΑΛ ishing to profit bv the doc tor s t lv к e though he did not choose to mi part all his suspicions to hun he resolvtd to return with Mrs Margram whose eirand to the Abbey was soon surmised among the household anditbemgalsoknownthathi^h words had arisen between sir Herbert and Henry about the horse the servants were in general inclined to exonerate our heio Turner had openly declared when he learnt from the doctors servants our hero had not returned home, that he was confi dent Mr Pembroke did not even know of

neas advanced, telling Turner he would with pleasure give lnm, or any other per¬ son, as many hundreds, if they could dis¬ cover where Mr Pembroke was, and bnng him to the Abbey before sunset As for the rascal who had m grossly abused his trust, he was only sorry he could not com¬ mit lum to prison, as it was, he desired he might never liave -the misfortune to see him again, ordering 1 him to be instantly discharged, and without α ichoracter, such wretches could not be too severely punished Turner having left the room, the boro- net declared he never had been more at a loss, eithei what to advise or what steps to take, in consequence of Henry's disap¬ pearance At last it was settled, that he should proceed to Southampton from the ndmg or fencing-master he hoped to gain some clue, he had besides private reasons for choosing to begin his inquiries there. ι Lady Charleville returned with Mis Margram, wishing to take the advice of tlie doctor, while the seivants, under the directions, of Turner, took different roads.
each being eager to come up with the fti gitive, whom tliey were to request would return, and were to tell him who had in jured the horse, and what had been the consequence to himself No one to whom sir Herbert applied could afford lum any information, but no one except himself seemed to consider Henrys absence in а senous hght, all seeming to take it for granted he would soon return —" Where eould a youth of his age,' said the fencing-master, " find either fnends or an asylum ? Had he been of age, and in possession of independence, the case would have been very different but unprovided with either money or dothes, he was sure he would not go to any distance " The riding-master was of the same opi mon Had he ever expressed a w ish to be en rolled m their regiment? asked the baronet He had merely given the preference to the cavalry Was their colonel, lord W ilhngford, at Southampton? inquired sn!

He had not been there lately he sel¬ dom paid them more than a flying visit he was now at Winchester, as he had wnt¬ ten from thence the day before Sir Herbert said no more, but returned, no wiser than he left home nor could Dr Margram assist them with any advice like¬ ly to lead to a discovery of the fugitive He spent the evening at the Abbey, but the only cheering hope he gave was, that Henry s absence was certainly unpremedi¬ tated, as he had made no preparations, nor had any of his clothes been removed, all his books, mathematical instruments, &c were in their places, lus watth he had, of course, with lnm, and a few pounds m mone), but no change of linen it was therefore but natural to conclude he meant to retnm As to his ha\ ing come to an untimely end, that did not appear hkely, though not so gay as formerly, he had never displayed any symptoms of despon¬ dency, there were no gipsies in the neighbourhood—nor had there been any robbenes lately He (the doctor) would write to Selby the next day
" You have indeed throwh a light upon the subject," hastily exclaimed sir Herbert, " he is gone to town, to sergeant Selb) 's we shall soon hear from George " " We may icasonably hope he has taken refuge theie," said lady Omi leville " they wero such fnends, I dare say they were in all each other s secrets The impatient baronet w ished to hav e dispatched an express that very moment, but he was oienuled by the doctor and lad) Charleville Geoige Selby would not keep them ш suspense, the next day wou'd set then minds at ease, so aigued Mis Nelson, who had hurried to the Abbey upon the fitst sinmişe ot our heros absence, and who returned tnither in the evening, to inquire how the family did, and to participate m their uneasiness, she had been admitted mto tlie saloon, atid so eageily seized the hmt the doctor had diopped, that she ren¬ dered the baronet arid Ins lady as sanguine .is herself, and quite comfoi ted the almost broken-hearted Anna by her ehecimg prognostics

eye, he turned it over, examined the seal, and reverted to the post mark—it was franked by the sergeant, and dated the preceding day Hastily running over his own, he ordered his horse, and leaving Mr Stapylton with his pupils, rode to the Abbey, where he had been eagerly ex. pected for the last hour " What news, dear doctor' Have you heard fiom Selby?" cned the baronet, hail¬ ing him as he entered the house " I have had no letters concerning Mr. Pembroke, but here is one addressed to lnm, franked by sergeant Selby, which might relieve our anxiety Dare we break the seal ? ' " He cannot yet have reached London," resumed the baionet, " but let us join lady Charleville " They did so, sir Herbert repeating what the doctor had said " I positively think we are authonzed to read Mr Selby's letter," rephed lady Charleville, " the intimacy subsisting be¬ tween hnn and Pembroke may assist our vol it и

" That he was sir Heibert's natural son, I thmk veiy probable, or some such ab¬ surdity," replied the doctor, perceiving the agitation of his auditors, " the fellow deals m improbabilities—he is hardly ever sober, and feels very much offended at having never been asked to the Abbey, therefore depend upon it he out luroded Hci od in his scand il, but ht ıs beneath our notice, oi I should hav e long since put lnm into the ecclesiastical court but suppose I vv ι ite, as vve agreed, to Selby ' of course I shall not mention hav mg read Ins Iettei, if Pem¬ bioke ıs m London,he will find lnm out ' Sır Heıbeıt felt assured he would soon send them intelligence of him, nor was hdy Chulevil'e, though less sanguine, in¬ clined to despair, but Selby s ansvvei ef fectually damped all their fondly chenshed hopes he had neither seen noi lieard from his fnend, and seemed little less uneisy than themselves, requesting tliey would open and read his letter addressed to Hen ry, as it would prove tint some serious un- eosiness preyed upon his mmd atknow- ledgmg that he feaied Pembroke had not

CHAPTER X Wl hope our kmd readers have not for¬ gotten the opening of our story to w hieb we must return, since the father of our hero, who so unceiemoniouslv, in our hist chapter, acknowledged Ins having so shame fully deceived his unsuspicious mother, and the earl of Walhngford, who was the co¬ lonel of the regiment of dragoons which had been for some time stationed at u outh ampton, were one and the samt person This nobleman s father had very uijexpect-
edly come to the title and possession of the estate, and personals thereunto annexed, by the death of sir Herbert Choileville's maternal grandfather, who instead, as might hav e been expttted, of enriching his grand» sons, or even soliciting that his title might descend to them, chase to suffer that and the estate to fall to the share of so distant .1 relation, that though his claim must have been allowed in law, and perhaps in equity, he was, in fict, a stranger to the late earl Lieutenant-colonel Danvers had, by dint of the severest economy, been enabled to make the appearance of a gentleman, he had mained a woman of some family and some fortune, who had greatly assisted his vv ishes she had brought hnn two sons, the eldei of whom vv as a lieutenant m his fa¬ ther j regiment when he came to the title, and loid Danvcis soon made himself ample amends for the pnvations he had endured in early life Soon after he became of age, he married the only daughter of a very wealthy merchant, who had been struck with Ins figure, and captivated by his ele¬ gant manneis
The young couple began the w orld in high style, and foi a time were the envy of their cotemporanes bnt incessant dis sıpatıon, and an increasing family, did not agree with lady Danvers, who was ordered by her physicians to lcive 1 ondon, and recommended to try the puicr an of Devonshire ľluthei she removed, with her father and childien lord Danvers re mamıng m town, where be wns detained by his duty is ι senator, but much more by his ovvn choice, not hivmg any talents as а nurse, he told his boon companions The death of Mr A'derson, his father in law, gave him still greiter liberty though he deeply regretted not hivnij, ie companied his ivi e to D iwhsh, when he found that Mr Aldcison had settled all his fortune upon her and her did hen 11ns was very tinpleasint as it would oblige him to rem un upon teims with a woman of whom he v as tned, and would render his children independent of his tontrol I ord V/ ilhnpfi rd aid not long surviv <.

companion, and for near four years he mamtamed his assumed character, till his regiment being ordered abroad, snd he be¬ ginning to lire of his mtngue, broke witli his innocent victim, as we hai e related, convinced, tliat ovving to the précautions he had taken, she would never discovei tliat the earl of Wşllmgford and Hemy Pemberton were the same person It has already been related how M ss Barhaven proceeded when made acqu tinted with lus iniquity, and her resolution to bring up her son in ignorance of their affi nity her aunt, friend, and companion, Mrs Western, assumed the name of Wíl son, and removed with the child, while ι Miss Barhaven proceeded to Ireland, and, atded by Mrs Meredith, whom site onte personated, to visit her son at Wellsdown House, she contrived to keep pur hero m the dark respecting her profession and their relationship Lord Walhngford returned to England at the expiration of three years, and of course contrived to make sotne indirect m quines respecting Miss Barhaven, who w as

Had she, as he li id expected she would have done, boi ne an indifferent character-, he would have been tempted to obhge her to refund, but she stood so very high in the esteem ofthe woild, that he dared not have recourse to this unmanly expedient besides, he eould only attatk lier ııı law
under lus own name, and that he dared not do, as he had measures to keep with lady Walhngford but he was so often en¬ gaged in expensive mtngues, and had been obliged to pay suth heavy damages in a enm con business, that he was very much out at elbows when sn Herbert Charleville arnved in England The world are generally very bountiful to nabobs, and the baronet s riches were proportionably magnified Aware of the sort of relationship subsisting between them, lord Wallmgford, by dint of ponng over his family papers, and resorting to his genealogy, discovered that he was the ba rönets undoubted heirat-law, admitting he died intestate He had endeavoured to make acquaintance with the late Mi Melmoth , but his heart was impenetrable, and he was inaccessible with sir Herbert be hoped to be more fortunate he was a man of the world—he should better know how to manage him, he therefore seized an early opportunity to pay his respects to lum, and as our worthy baronet was not inclined to quarrel with him because his

his medical attendant , " she bos been very unfortunate in her selection of α husband, Since his lordship is notorious for his m- tngues, and though he paid five thousand pounds damages to an liipired husband very Intely, he is now suspected of being upon such intimate terms with another dashing ladv, as must end in damages on his side, and a dn orce on hers, I only w on. der lady Walhngford does not oblige hint to sign articles of sep nation, as she seldom sees him but when she receives her divi¬ dends, which he seizes, and dev otes to Ins gallantries ' The phv sıcıan's tale tallied with the re¬ marks sir Herbert had made, and α second aetion being brought against the earl by ι grossly injured husband, he chose to be denied to bim whenever he called, and when urged to a farther explanation, wrote Ins lordship so severe a letter, all inter¬ course between them ceased Su Heibert married within the twelvemonth, and had never since lieard the name of lord Wal¬ hngford mentioned, except by chance, or m

to Ireland, of which kingdom his mother was a native, and where, owing to а law¬ suit, he was detained upwards of eighteen months His regiment had been part of the time in Scotland, but was now retum sã to Winchester, a company only being this time stationed it Southampton thl ther he histened upon his return to Eng¬ land, and found our hero was studying the equestnan art under the nding master •attached to the regiment and fentmg, &e under other non commissioned officei s y he had therefore frequent opportunities of seei- mg him, w ithout making himself know n He now strongly remmded him of his once beloved Miss Barliaven—my, he even fancied, after a while, that he bore some resemblance to himself He easily con tnved, without being introduced to him, to draw our open hearted hero into comer sation, appeanng to rejoice at his being des¬ tined to be enrolled among the defenders of his country, questioning hun respecting lus mihtary studies, and seeming to hike the most lively mteiest in Ins advancement Thus some months elapsed, dunng which
ho frequenti v visited Southampton He had often indirettly alluded to Henry's family, but there he was always foiled, as our hero, having told hnn he was лп or plum, could give lum no furthei informa tion, and he w is inclined to believe the youth was, is he repi esented, a Waid ofsir He, beits, since how could his son be un¬ dci the baronet s с ire?

prevail upon lnm to give up the appoint¬ ment, he could easily provide for our hero, and at every risk and any expence lie was now determined to send him from Charing Could he remove him by his own consent, it would save him a wonderful deal of tiouble, and he did not dtspair of accom¬ plishing Ins purpose, as he appeared to hay с a very high sense of honour, and was, he had discovered, very tenacious of the world s opinion Hc must not be too eager, the longer he allowed lum to digest his previous hints, the more hkely they wtre to take loot, he therefore left Southamp¬ ton the following day fin Windsoi, and immediately waited upon the gentleman whose son w-as going to India, who wus very ready to obhge a man who he knew had great interest, as to his lordship's pn vate charactei as a family man, tbat did not concei n lnm—he was to be pitledi for having a vapounsh wife, which rendered his erreurs du -moment very excusable, he was a man of hi« word in all matteis of business, and ho did not choose to throw the first stone The earl besides
oflered veiy fair—a coinetcy ш his own regiment, and his future mteiest, in ex¬ change foi the cadetslnp, the matter was thereloie soon settled, with this proviso— should the friends ol the youth whom his lordship wished to send out object tlo Ι.ω leaving England, the agreement must be consideied as null and void, but he should make use of such uigent reasons to induce them to dose with the ofiir, he could hard¬ ly doubt their ai ailing themselves of the oppoitunity
CHAPTER ХГ
Having thus paved the way for the suc¬ cess of his machinations, the earl of \V al¬ lusioni returned to Winchester, and soon had occasion to visit Southampton Our heio was happy to see htm, and more pleased at his putting a note into his hands to this effect —
" ИГ DE VR YOUNG FRIFND, " 1 have so much to say, and it is so essential to your future welfare that om present intimacy should not be sus¬ pected, that I must request, should the weather be at all favourable, that you will giv e me the meeting on Monday, in the now deserted pork of Walton House I shall proceed thither unattended, and on foot, from --------, to avoid notice, you will do vvell to follow my example You may depend upon finding me within sight of tht root house, from twelve till one and there vve may umnteirupted hold a confidential council I shall return to Winchester to day, where you may write me, should any previous engagement prevent our meeting only bear in mmd that the most intimite friend of your fa ther feels no less interested in the fate of his son Secrecy continues necessary, or I would not repeat my injunctions " Yours, affectionately, " WAbLINGlORD * Such a letter, particularly the concluding
acknowledgment, was more than sufli· uent to render our hero both thoughtful, ( unous, and, above all, tircumspect The mere general character he had heard of the earl was highly favourable he was report. ed to be a brave and skilful officer—rather a Martuiet in point of discipline, but ge¬ nerally liked m the regiment, then he was a marned mm—the f ither of sons older than himself, of course Henry was both gratified and flattered by the avowed mte¬ iest he took m his concerns " The friend of my father ' he mentally exclaimed, " then I shall at last know who and what he was, and possibly why I have hitherto been so strangely and so wilfully, it should «eim, kept in the daik ' His mmd btny thus occupied, he ap¬ peared grave, absti itted, and indifferent to all present enjoy ments , and as the earl had favoured su Heibert with the two anonymous cautions already noticed the baronet treated lum very coolly, under the false impressions tliose scrawls had created Thursday pioved very favourable for the vol π ι
seoson, ond our hero hardly felt the ground, while hastening to Walton, the park pal nig vv as in so ruinous а state, he soon en ,, tered thiough a brtath near the root-house, and in another second the toweling figure of the earl emerged from among the leaf¬ less plant itions Ins mannei s wei e perhaps more captivating than evei—Ins voice, when modulated to kindness, was particu¬ larly impressive—and his fine doik eyes, which were the counterpart of his sons, were now lighted up by expectation and as, upon miture rellcction Ins lordship fancied he should be doing lus son a kind¬ ness by removing hnn liom Channg, and bv placing him at le ist in the ioni to fame and inhis, his conscience acquitted lnm of nittntioiial evil anil he resolved, as α peace offenng to tint same invv aid moni¬ tor, whom he had scotched not hilled, to previde for all the youths future wauls, suite inv oluntnnl ν he felt proud of hnn, and most devoutly did he ν ıslı hc could have exehinged him for his eldest or his second legitimate son, since, hod either of thun been in Ileniy s piesent situation,

might fetl at Inving left Channg, pro nusing to shew lnm several letters of his mother to Ins father, which had been put into his hands for that puipose, and her receipt for the two thousand pounds, and entering into mmy details tending to rn mmate her, and to exonerate his father, assuring him that she would be complete ly unm isked ere long if sir Herbert chose to continue the connexion it would be with his eyes open theiefore, ere they reiched town, Henry felt truly thankful that he had escaped from the web of im quity in which his mother s deception had involved hnn The father end son slept in a two-bedded room, and were roused soon after eight by the groom, who wished to let his lord know he was arnved lhis had been a settled plan between master and man, though his lordship now declared he vv as very offiuous—be should lib» to have lam an hour longer, and so he supposed w ould lus y oung fnend but as they wore aw ake they might as well rise К 2
Henry said it w ould be shameful in lum to complain of fatigue, since his lordship had undergone so much more, the earl having only left London for Winchester the evening before While they were dressing, the earl told tho well tutored James that he must ac- compony Mr Pemberton, which he had assured our hero, and with truth, was his real name, to the different warehouses to make such purchases as vv ould be necessary for Ins immediate use, is he (fold Walhng¬ ford) w as ob ged to go upon business of importance'another way Henry, w ho understood the eoil wished to see his fither, was peifectly satisfied, particulaily as his lordship gave lnm a handful of bank notes to expend as he chose, merely desiring James to see he was not imposed upon therefore, having breakfasted together, they separated—the earl promping to dine with our hero at six о clock, observing it was not worth while to remove their quarters tdl matters were finally settled Henry was, as usual, igreeable to every
proposal, and was thus left m tiust with the wily lames while the carl hastened to Windsor, wheie he soon settled every thing respecting the cadetslnp with his friend who promised to giv e hım the meet ing m town the following moimng, when he would take his loidship s protege to the India House, and have Ins name emolled among the cadets then soıııg out This business being thus conJuded, lus lordship hastened h ick to town having of course, presei ved the strictest incog not having chosen to call upon the countess who supposed him at Winchester, whither he wis very ansious to return is he paiti culaily dieaded exciting any suspicion of being concerned m the disappearance of om hero, to whom he knew sir Herbert С hailev die was most affectionately ittach td, and whose regaid for his lady would induce lnm to move heaven and earth to discovei the fugitive

In the pit we shall escape notice, and I w ish you to see as much as the shortness of the time will admit Henry, who merely feared his lordship would over fatigue himself, could make no objection, and as the earl hoped, the performance for the time completely ba¬ nished Channg from oui hero s mmd, since, though he w as completely the peei s dupe, and firmly believed all he said, there were moments when he w ished he had tome to some explanation with sir Herbert yet he

conditionally agreed with the captain to take out a pi otegé of his to India, whom he meant to have enrolled among the ca¬ dets, but as he wished him to enjoy every convenience, he should pay for Ins passage, und should request he ν ould place hnn under the care of some fnend when he reiched Calcutta He now told the cop tun, in strict confidence, that the youth he meant to place under his core was ш f ict his natur d son whom it was Income tl olutely necessaiy to send abroad, since his mothei, after expending five thousand pounds vv ludi he had appropriated to the adv alitement of the boy, had placed her self under the protettion of an old fool, though a veiy rich man, and now threat¬ ened to expose him to lady Walhngford, if he did not relieve her fiom the tharge of hti son tins he had been very eager to do from the moment sht hid given lnm a sutctssor he had thtrefore sought an mtimicy with Ins son, of whom he was really proud, and as the fnend of hts father he had opened his eyes respecting his jade of a mother, and the youth had, by bis

mediate use in India, with liberty to draw upon the earl foi tw о hundred pounds a- year, till the youth rose in the service, and was thus enabled to live upon his pay " Nothing could be moie fair nor moie honourable,' the toptanı declaied, who readily agreed to dine with the earl and Mr Pemherton, and to take immediate tharge of the latter, for w hose ho ird, p ıs sage, &c his lordship made the most liber il auangements, merely с uitiomng the cap tain not to suffer his piolege to look at an) papers, and never to suffer him out of his sight till thcy sailed, as Ins mother might spirit up her present keeper to offer such rewards for the rei ov ery of her son, as might mduce the youth to mai his for¬ tune by returning home Should he be so foolish, he should wash his hands of lnm, at eveiy nsk, he was now miking great petunia! у sacrifices to bring bun forward in the vvorld with credit to himself, but it he stood m his own light, he must take the consequente lhe taptaın was thus i endered com¬ pletei) subservient to his wishts, and the)

'Ihe eail hiving driven fiom the door, с iptam Molesworth told our hero they had better immediately take a coach and drive to the Bi îcklay er s Arms, where the) should have every chance of meeting with some tonveyance to Gravesend, from whente it was merel) a few minutes walk to Milton Teirace, where he resided, and as Mrs Molesworth w ould expect them, and they should be much more comfortable at hu
house than where they were, they could but take a postchaise if all the stages were gone Henry, who hud taken a real liking to his present companion, of course made no objection and the few purchases he had made being tied up in two handkeicluefs, they proceeded as speedily as possible to the house already mentioned, from the dooi of v, hich the hst Kentish stage was dm ing as they drew up and in three minutes more they took their seats witlunside, md fortunatelv, is thcy thought li id the co ich to themselv es since thcy h id mudi to s iv and thev vvere so well pleased with с tell other, tint thev hardly knew how time wore, vvlien they stopped at Gravesend soon aftei tw elve, w here each t iking one of the handkerchiefs confcuning our İıeıo s small stock of clothes, they pioceeded to Milton lenacc 1 he moment they came withm sight of his house, the captain exclaimed—" I knew Mrs Molesworth would expect us, and I am suie she is not gone to bed, as there is a light m the kitchen

" Never better and I never was mare delighted with а piospect, he replied, as he followed bis host down stairs, and found Ins hostess decked in smiles, and her break- fist table set out with ever) comfort, and even luxury, winch embellishes an English morning meal The room commanded the same view of the river, and captain Molesworth, with a glass, pointed out to him the Asia, which was lying rather higher up the Thames, telhng him he w ould take him on board the next day, to shew lnm the excellent accommodations of an Indiaman , thev must go to town that moining, to give the necessary orders for clothes, linen, &c Mrs Molesw orth had made out one list, and he had been making out another, she wished to accompany them to London they should dine at her fathers, a tity met chant, and return in the evening Thus our heio htd vtiy little time al-
low ed him for reflection indeed the Moles worths were only anxious to render him comfortable for the present, and to fit Inm out as became the son of а nobleman the captam h ıvmg under the seal of secrecy told his wife what h id passed between him and lord Walhngford She had lieard that that nobleman w ıs renowned for his in tugues still if all he had related w as truth he had acted very handsomely by this boy but she could not help fancying there was ι wheel withm a wheel at all events, she requested captain Molesw orth w ould be a father to the unaeknow lodged youth, whose countenance w ıs a sufficient security for the goodness of his heart, and the excel lence of Ins principles lbe ciptam had also discovered that the cidet h id re« iv ed α most excellent edu с ition both classical and military and al most wondered the eirl had not placed such a promising youth m Ins own rey ment —at ill events he felt sure that 1 e ν ould make his way m the 1 ast ani ! с vv ıs ıc lvcd to bc as Ins wile dtsued ι

of Pembroke s age, as if he h id been kid¬ napped or trepanned aw ay His lordship having thus turned the business into ridicule was nevertheless very glad to find Hemy had not been ad- vertised, though the su vants from the Ab¬ bey had certainly promised a reward to any one who could relieve their anxiety Wishing to hear what was said or thought respecting his son s disappearance at Cha nng, the earl rode thither, followed by James, who considered his fortune as made, since from being in this secret, he should always be able to make his own terms with his master he was now to make those in¬ quines whith his lord could not, with outleadmg to suspicion and at present he contnved to second all his schemes, sincehe was aware thathe should not have him completely in his power till his son had sailed At the very entrance ofthe village Mr Cummings (who was now a daily visitor there, under pretence of shooting or cours ing, which enabled hun to make frequent visits to his former flame) and a Southamp
ton gentleman, with whom lus lordship yvas slightly acquainted, met lum almost face to face They were on foot, had their guns m their hands and were attended by three dogs, and were so eager to commu¬ nicate what thty deemed a most wonder¬ ful discovery, that Mr Playford hailed the earl, exclaiming—" Your lordship must have heard of Mr Pembroke s strange dis¬ appearance ? Such a question, and tbe apparent breath¬ less anxiety of the speaker, completely alarmed our peer —" What do you mean?" he inquired, rather impatiently " Why, my lord, Mr Pembroke has been missing since Tuesday—he was a ward ofsir Herbert Charleville s, and a pupil of Dr Margrams ' And what then? ' Oh, my lord, we have made suth a dis covery ' I declare my blood runs cold, while I am relating the melancholy event The unfortunate youth was to come to an un¬ timely end some years ago he was all but murdered by a gipsey, and last spnng he was very near losing his hfe by a robber,

CHAPTER XVII Ihe earl of Walhngford had hoped to have effected his great aim by his last bold anonymous epistle, he was therefore ex¬ ceedingly disappointed when he under
stood the baronet and his lady vvere gone to Bath, and had token then newly adopted protegee with them Had he taken suth pains, and been at suth expente to remov e lus son, meiely to make vvay foi this doubt¬ less base-boin beggar' he mciitilly asked himself Better Henry should have been the old fools heir, than this drab of α gnl, whom he began to believe was, .is he had wntten hdy Charleville, α Jmstard of sn- Herbert s if so, he hod beçn doing hiin a veiy senous semce A Vell, lie had still anothei mme to spring, w Inch must succeed, and a month h ıy mg elapsed sinte lus sons departure, os bewas not obliged to remam with his regiment, he followed the baionet and his lad) to Bath '1 hey were residing in a v ery hand¬ some house, but led almost as lecluse a life as at Channg the elder Miss Margiam, now ш hei fourteenth ye u, liad joined their party, and hei he had olten met, w alkuig with Anna, attended by Mis Pennell bir Heıbeıt s piotegee, dressed with tie gant sııııphtıtv, now attiacttd geneial no tue, sinu, witl out bung a regular beautv t
she had a most animated, engaging coun¬ tenance Her peison was very much im¬ proved since her residence at the Abbey, indeed she gave every promise that her matunty would be beauty, formed by the graces she was now the chief object m whom the baronet's and his lady's affection centered, and the never-falling source of their amusement " That is no plebeian child, ' thought om wily earl To whom could she belong' The more he saw of her, the more he was puzzled to decide Lady Charleville had been confined with α cold, and a sort of nervous fever her son s desertion sat heavy at her heart, and if he hod been spinted away by his worth less father, that was no consolation Sir Herbert entered into all her feehngs, and with him and her juvenile companions, she took doily airings, ond frequent excursions to Bristol, Wells, Frome, &c which had been of great service to her, indeed she was all but restored to her accustomed health, when sir Herbert read the nome of lord Wilhngford among the recent ai rivals
As lady Charleville never went out on foot, and they saw no company, he hoped she would escape what would, he knew, be a most unpleasant rencounter, though he flattered himself that the earl would not wish to throw himself in her way, if, as he suspected, he was the mditer of the ano¬ nymous cautions and advice they had both received, he must know that Miss Bar¬ haven was lady Charleville, if he had wronged him by this supposition, he did not wish he should be rendered so wise; be therefore resolved to leave Bath at the expiration of the month, and to take a tour before he returned home. Having thus arranged his plans, he pro¬ ceeded, as usual, alone to the pump-room, where he met the earl almost face to face, who bowed respectfully, and appeared eager to seize the opportunity to address him, but sir Herbert's very cool salute ef¬ fectually prevented him from following up his advantage, and the next day he lieard the baronet had left Bath for Chiton. Provoked at bemg thus thrown off by the man to whose estates he fancied himself
entitled he determined to strike at once at the root ol his happiness He must know that Hemy was hdy Charlevilles son—of «unse that she hod been momed before but then, what story had she told to induce hnn to bring the youth up in ignoiance of his relationship to his mothei I 1 here must have been some concealments, and these he would disclose—real facts, a little heightened, would answer eveiy purpose he might be confronted with lady Ch «le¬ ville, therefore hc must not advance any thing which he could not piove, smie muth depended upon that Having there fore written several letters before hc could please himsilf, he at list produced w hat he considered as a chef d celivi с, wluch iau as follows — " SIR, " Having in vam endeav oui ed to discover how, w hy, or by what means, I have been so unfortunate as to excite y onr displeasure, chance Ins at last enabled me to solve the m)sterv Were I less tena tious ofyoui regard, piobably it might be

who and when I marned, you have seen lady Walhngford, and may, hke me, have drawn comparisons suffice it to say, that I saw Miss Barhaven, when crowded houses declared her estimation with the public Her melting voice and excellent singing rendered me her slave, and certainly her dupe I forgot I was a husband and a fa ther and being introduced to her by a particular friend, under an assumed name (I chose to drop my title), we soon under stood each other, and hved very happily together for some years—that is, I spent most of my leisure hours with her She bore me a son, of whom I was extremely fond, but ere he had attained his fourth year, her levity became so intolerable, I thought it due to myself to cut the con nexion, but not without providing libe rally for the child, that ıs, I placed a sum sufficient for his present and futuie wants at his mothers disposal " Not long after our separation, I was told by one of her confidential friends, the chdd was no more I could not gneve that he was spared the misery of blushing
for his wietched mother, of course I no longer felt interested in her concerns I heard that she had quitted the stage, and was gone abroad, and from that time, till within these few days, I did not know where she resided 1 saw hei alighting from your carriage last Wednesday, at a milliner's door, though certainly rather altered, I instantly recollected her, and I hav e every reason to suppose that the re¬ cognition was mutual, and to her vei ν un¬ pleasant—at least such are my conclusions, which your hasty dep irture from Bath ap¬ pears to warrant Had she not appeared to know me, I might possibly have spared you the trouble of reading this letter, but I should have fancied myself her accom phce, had I connived at the deceptions she must have been guilty of to have induced you even to allow hci the sanction of your name, and the command of your house and establishment " Should you wish for any farther or more minute information, I shall remam another week at Bath I subjoin my ad¬ dress, and must hope that you will neither

A summons to coffee (he never drank tea) broke m upon his reflections The girls were going to see a mechanical exhi¬ bition at the Wells House, with Mrs Pen¬ nell he therefore listened, with his accus¬ tomed good-humour, to their gay anticipo tions, and to Anna's promises to bring him an exact account of the show, appeanng to participate in their pleasurable emo¬ tions, while his mmd was very differently occupied, as he was reflecting how he could best mention the recent letter to lady Char¬ leville, for whom he daily, nay almost hourly, felt his regard increase, and cer¬ tainly her fine person and elegant manneis were exactly calculated to conciliate and to retain affection, as fine sense, sweetness of temper, perfect ingenuousness, and the most benevolent desire of plensing, all com bined to engage his love, and even respect, and to constitute the happiness of his de¬ clining life, while his intelligent mind, ge¬ nerous hospitable temper, and manly open¬ ness of heart and manners, well deserved the constant attention she paid him
CIIAPTTR XVIII BiroRF we proceed to relate how and when the baronet communicated lord Wal- hngford's letter to his lady, it may be as vvell to enter into some details respecting their first acquaintance We have already sketched lus family history, and mentioned lord Walhngford's vain attempt to rank among Ins Iriends bir Herbert was in lodgings at Rich¬ mond when the earl so anxiously courted his intimaey, but wishing to be nearer his medical ittendants, and thinking he should hay e m tny resources m London to drive off ennui, which he could not meet with m the country, he requested his physician to seek limi a quiet, pi ivate, airy lodging, cither in or very near London The doctoi expiessed Ins approbation of his plan, telling hmi that hehad lately had a gentleman under his care, who lodged

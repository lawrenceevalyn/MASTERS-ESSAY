she found she íeilb hid α much gıeateı regard for the b ironet th in she h id sus pected She immcdi itely с lined her let ters to Mis Charlton, antl desired her ad¬ vice and ıssıstaıice on the subject "You nsk my advice, my dear,' said Mrs Charlton "but I muth suspect itis, as many otheis do, after you hai e determin ed how to act However that may be, rt is impossrble for me to aduse, in a case which must after ill, dept nil on) our own feehngs and id"as "ï on know my opinion of marmeçe m general to ivhith you seem to have lc mod at the s ime time, I must own I think both your own cliaracter and sir Montabile s aie such as to pro nise α far greater sh ire of happiness than ıs usu il¬ ly founl rn tliat state Λ ou ire neithei of) ou romantic—)ou will hue a hr rt t shaie of ivoildlv ¡,ifts and nodunj, to fear from that tiemendous ι oik poıeıt) ninth wrecks so manv л outhful adventurers At the same time, some ot ) our notions on this subject are peculiar, and ι ou are not of a tempeı

sufficiently disposed to nehmt its tiuth fiom his lips, she did not swerve fiom her icsolution of taking moie time toi ıeflcc¬ tıon The idea ot Vavasour had nevci been piesented to her unconnected with that of Miss Orfoid, till the period which biought him us alover to herself, and she therefore could not feel heiself perfectly qualified to decide on n question so verj un¬ expectedly put That she thought of Inni most highlj. is certain, but it was from the report of others, and tliough those who spoke thus well of lnm had known him long, and might be well able to judge ol hnn, she knew that there were many ciiciimstuiices, winch, though trifling m themselves, were of infinite unpoitince in wedded hie to all, and paiticularly to one so fistichoiio ns herself She had no wish to muni , she hid no honoi at being stv led an old maul and she had been so much accustomed to look at marriage with a veiy doubtful ej e as to its superior comforts, that she was the moie hi inly resoli cd,
resolved, as she more gravel/ reflected, not to marry unless she found her happi ness would be increased by it Slany advantages offered in the con¬ nexion proposed to her with sir Montague Vavasour His cliaracter was exemplary, his family ancient and of consequence, and his fortune such as to preserve her from every evil attendant on poverty, or even pecuniaiy embarrassment, whicli she believed uns the cause ot Phdipsons strange chnnge of conduct it w ns, too suth as would enable her to remov e many ot Itts difficulties, and thus restore him to Ins foimer manners and habits, and remove Isabellas great source of unhappmess And this last argument was the one of most weight in Vnvusour s favour Althea httle suspected tht total thange whieh had taken place in Phihpson s tondutt nor how entirely he was undei tht niflu enee of an artful womUn and an uiipnn tipled man, whose pecuniary favours had given bun a degree of power wluch lie vol in d to ik
took pare to exert, restrained by no feel¬ ing of delicacy Mrs Tei mor, however, was obliged to be very circumspect in her behaviour before Mr Molyneux, for though she liked Phihpson better, she knew he could not support her if she left the other, and it was more conjecture than any possibility of certainty, which induced the reports, wluch at length reach¬ ed the unhappy Isabella, and which un¬ fortunately her own observation and Phi¬ hpson s carelessness hut too surely confirm¬ ed Certainly the change in his manners and behaviour, though not known or sus¬ pected in their utmost extent, influenced Altheas decision towaids sir Montague Vavasour, who, after much waste ot tender rhetoric, found he could gain по farther advantage, than that if she did not marry him, she never would marry at all, and that nothing should induce her to enter into that state, the time she was so wretthed about her favourite sister "It," said she, finally, "at the end of six
six months I find Isabella happier, and can bring myself to think of the married state in a more favourable light than I do at present, I will be yours—if I feel a conviction that celibacy will make me happier, I expect you will not accuse me of coquetry, if I dedde upon remaining single. So highly do I think of you, that if I cannot promise myself happiness with you, I shall never expect to find it with any other man, and I will be yours or— my own." AVith this the baronet was at last obli¬ ged to be contented ; and as, at any rate, Althea assured him of her warmest friend¬ ship, he prepared to attend her and Mrs. Charlton to England. The will of the late Mr. Orford had been so positively worded, that Vavasour found himself absolutely incapacitated fiom returning any part of Miss Orford's forfeited property. She did not, however, refuse his earnest request, made with the truest sincerity, that she would consent to D S retain
retain the whole till he really was married, since it was at least an uncertainty ; and situated as he was with Althea, he could hnrdly cnll himself even an engaged man; nor could any one pronounce him rejected by Miss Orford, but those who loved her too well to mention tiieir information upon the subject. The few days Althea passed in Ireland after this affair were spent by Miss Orford at Mrs. Charlton's house ; and so entirely did she become attached to Althea, now that unlimited confidence in each other discarded all constraint, that she found it too painful to part She therefore ac¬ cepted Mrs. Charlton's invitation to accom¬ pany them to England; and the good peopleof Ireland who interested themselves in her affairs, were effectually deceived into a belief that her engagements with lir Montague still subsisted.

Сен-шопу ' slıeıv me but thy wort!.. Mrs. Chnrlton had promised Althea, when they went to Ireland) to stop a few days at lord Randolph's on their return, pro¬ vided they were acceptable guests at the castle. They accordingly ordered their horses for that pince, without any grent expectation, however, of' a plensniit visit, or any temptation, even from Harriet her¬ self, to exceed their original plan of re¬ maining three days. Althea antidpnted a great deal of annoying magnificence, very httle comfort, and no real happiness ; and this she expected as much from the D 3 countess's
countess s own letters as from any tlung else The dnve through the park was strik¬ ingly beautiful, now diversified by the changing hues of just-commencmg au¬ tumn, and Althea thought she could be well content never to go beyond its boun¬ daries, if she might stray withm them alone and at hberty, or select her com¬ panions , that, she knew, was not Hamet s case, and she began to dread whether the stately old earl and punctdious lady Lucretia Falkland might not be rather ofiended than pleased by this abrupt entrée without leave or notice But Va- vasour answered for their politeness, though he would not vouch for their sin- çenty , and the castle was soon before them A train of highly-powdered ser¬ vants, in blue velvet hveries, ntbly em¬ broidered with gold, appeared on the steps at the sound of the carnages, and the names of Mrs Charlton and Miss Vernon, su Montague Vavasour and Miss Orford, rang
rang from one to the other, und soon reached the grand saloon, where the earl and countess, lady Lucretia Falkland, his sister, t id the ladies Drusilla and Clorinda, his aunts, sat in as much state as if they were expecting half the peerage Hor¬ nets heart was not one of those which fly out to meet a long-absent fnend re¬ gardless of cold ceremony, she advanced to meet her sister and Mrs Charlton with all the dignity of a countess, and was equally polite, graceful, and indifferent to them as to sir Montague and Miss Orford Lord Randolph received his guests with great urbanity, and every wish to appear amiable, and the tedious formality of in traductions and low courtesies having been happily accomplished, they all seated them¬ selv es in uncomfortable state, and a few general topics were coldly discussed, for the old ladies would have reckoned it very ill bred to have introduced any particular discourse relative to lady Randolph's own family affairs, as that could only be an in¬ ri 4 teresting
teresting subject to those whom it con cerned, and of this Mrs Charlton and Al thea were aware "You remam with us a few lays, of course, said Harnet, in a tone not much like invitation, to her sister Althea looked at Mrs Charlton, who re plied, that one day was all they were able to afford, particular busmess requiring their presence at home Harriet bowed and seem ed satished to have it so A dinner, magni ficently grand, silent, heavy, and tiresome, was announced and Althea saw, with more dismay than satisfaction, a fine full dressed man, with an immense bouquet in his button hole behind every chair, whilst three more presided at a sideboard groaning under the weight of gilt plate, off whicli sumptuous metal she saw they were all to eat There had been no time for any change in consequence of company going in, and she therefore concluded this was the usual mode of living and she pitied Hamet for being condemned to the slaven
slavery of so much grandeur which to judge by her manner and countenance did not appear muth connected ivith hap piness Our trai eileis wtre not epicures antl had made their dinner long enough before the rest to feel tncd and disgusted with the continuance ot the scene Althéa in deed httle accustomed to such gloomy state never made а worse meal for she liated Trench dishes vvhich chiefly com posed the cookery before her and felt halt ifraitt to isk the supercilious gentleman behmd the chau for arry thmg she wanted Harrret seemed fir from comfortable— she tasted of every thny but eat nothing— hardly spoke a woid and Althéa observ ed that Gei ild who stood at his loids di in in a plam suit of black with a white луаюеаЫ and а brilliant biotch and ring watched her during the whole of the dinner particularly if she address¬ ed herself to Vavasour D 5 Xotwith
Notwithstanding the earl s attempts at being sociable and pleasant, and no man had it more in his power when he pleased the evening passed away very heavily for Haniet appealed afraid to talk lest the two old aunts should find something to turn to a wrong sense and having but little communication with any of her fa mily, could hardly answer the questions Althea ventured to put, after the rest of thc party had seated themselves at cards and chess The evening was uncommonly lovely, and Althea asked her sister to walk on the lawn The old ladies ex changed a glance and Hainet looking half alirmed it such α request Ь«л mg been made said she пел cr walked Miss Or ford had enough to do to observe ti e otiti figures dresses and m mners of these old women who sin passed any thing she h tel ever seen on the stage and she longed for а tête и tete ivith Airs Ch uiton to laugh them over, for she plainly saiv, fi-om the increasing
increasing gravity of Althea s features, that nothing hke mirth or laughter would suit there The ladies Drusilla and Clorinda Falk land were twins, and ahout fifteen years older than the r nephew, the earl They seemed formed in exaetly the same mould, both as to face and form—the same httle long eyes, with eyebrows arched to the top of the forehead, like a piece of black thread plastered, on and no eyelashes— the same prim button-mouth—tbe same- tumed up nose, and complex«™ as yel¬ low as the old point lace lappets they wore at the back of their flat heads 1 heir figuie was tall, and the waist the same sue from the hip to the shoulder, nothing appioachmg to a ¿Worn being visible 'Ihey wore large hoops—treble ruffles— rich brocades, made in the fashion of the sixteenth century, with embroidered sto¬ machers and diamond stay hooks Ihey wore their grey hair, which shone as if rubbed with plate-powder, and looked d 6 very
very like a mass of silver, tightly stretched over α very high cushion and at the sum mitof the pyramid laid a very flatcap of yel low İnce, with long lnppets nnd a profusion of old fashioned diamond pms were stuck through the hair the same valuable gems were lavishly spread over the rest of then persons Lady Lucretia, who was only about sixty two, consideied heiself quite а chicken, compared with her aunts, nnd se cietly regretted that a very distorted shape prevented her dressing more fashionably But the old fashioned negligee was too faiourable to an unlucky protuberance behind to be exch mged for a more mo dem dress nnd the old Indies readily took as a compliment to themselv es that mode of adornment, which nas m reahty, adopted to hide defects Her mmd u as as crooked as her body and she n atched the countes with а jealous assiduity, and reported whatever she disliked to the earl, with a malignant dlnnture which mnde Harriet more unhappy than she would allow
allow His lordship nas naturally ot å suspicious temper and aware how ill his yeais mntchcd with heis, was always watching for some appearance of levity or unbecoming gaiety of whicli he might complain Lady Randolph, however, was soon aw are of this, and adapted her behaviour to his ideas of right rather than her own She h id not mamed for happiness, but for grandeur she was therefore not disap pointed at finding herself uncomfortable from hrs temper, and could frequently find a solace in magnificente for the absence of comfort But Haniet did not look merely at the present she calculated her own age and her lords, und she sometimes fell the consider atron of wrdowhood necessary to support her under her present provoca tions By confoimmg now to his whims and fancies, she believed she wns providing muth good for futunty, and anticipated ι rich amends for her present compliances, ш
m a splendid addition to her large jointure The old aunts, and lady Lucretia also, would probably go off the stage about the snme tune, and she would thus be at once wholly emancipated The loss of the anx¬ iously desired herr had greatly vexed her as well as the rest, for she believed a son would give her much present and future consequence and poiver She was, how¬ ever, again in the family way, and the na¬ tural indolence of her temper and habits reconcded her to spending three pnrts of her days on a sofa, her last disappointment having been traced by the indefatigable spinsters to a sudden turn of her ancle in walking on a gravel walk AU this she set forth to Althea in an interview they hnd by themselves befoie the prying aunts descended in the morning and she enden voured to persuade her of the utility of her plan, and the pleasure of hei prospects " I almost shudder, said Althen, with α feehng of disgust she could not check, • nt

ciently generous, nor her sister prudent enough, to assist Phihpson farther than by cancelling the debt of two hundred pounds, and making it a gift Harnet's allowance was large, but her desire of change and variety in her clothes and or¬ naments, even in that secluded place, was as great as if she lived in the guy world, and kept her nlways pooi Some acts of munificence she was obliged to perforin ns countess ot llandolph, from whom some¬ thing was expected amongst the villagers nnd mdrgent tenants and ostentatron, if no better motive, prompted some httle ex ertions in the charitable way, amongst pa tnotic subscriptions, and such public bene fictions as recorded the name of the giver Characters so totally unlike ns hers and Althea s could not even be comfortable to¬ getller, and hei lately expiessed sentiments had given so much disgust, and indeed of fence to the pure and well principled mmd ot Althea, that she hailed with pleasure the second inoi nnig of their visit, u Inch was to cairi
carry her away from scenes of such glcomy magnificence and unsatisfactory splendour. The sisters parted even less affection¬ ately than they had met, and Althéa's for¬ mer feelings' of compassion at Harriet's want of comfort were lost in contempt.

But full of guile Tuosisoh. " Upon my word," said Miss Orford, when they stopped at a comfortable inn to dine, and Althea had left the room, " upon my »■ord, Mrs. Charlton, I am quite delighted to find myself out of the precincts of that horrid castle, and at a distance fiom the Abomelique of it. The very air breathed of gloom and insuppoi table grandeur. How
How her ladyship can exist there, I cannot make out, with that hideous crew " " Surely you will allow the placéis beau¬ tiful and very superb,' rephed Mrs Charl¬ ton " Oh, very much so' and the old ladies are very superb, and may have been beau¬ tiful too, but they are not to my taste, nor the place either Then those dreadful vel¬ vet beds, with their canopied tops and waving plumes of feathers—I always ex¬ pected to see all the avenues closed, and a set of horses caparisoned appropriately, and find myself drawn off as if m my hearse, and laid in a snug grave before morning I looked at yours, which bemg crimson, was rather less terrific, but mine ol dark green, and Altheas of black, really looked truly funereal I wish those old women would cut them up into robes, instead of those rustling silks, which always annoyed me with the idea of a violent rain Oh Heavens ' give me fifty pounds a-yeor, and the hberty of spending it how and where I like.
I like, and of moving or sitting still as I please, rather than such vast riches unen- joyed, and without the power of луаиЧищ or riding but as I am ordered or permitted'. lhat countess is an odious woman, and I had rather the bashaw should plague her than any one else." The entrance of Althea changed the* conversation, and they then settled their plans for the rest of the journey. It was agreed that Vavasour was to go to Charle» ville, and that the three ladies should go to Westhaven for a day or. two, as it was not much out of their w ay, and Althea did not expect soon to leave Isabella, lvhose si¬ tuation she apprehended was very uncom¬ fortable. Mrs. Vernon was then in toivn on business, and unable to go immediately to the vicarage. Sir Montague parted very unwillingly from Althea, to whom every day rendered him still more attached, as it shewed him some new excellence in her character. Nor did he lose in her estimation by being more
more known Circumstanced as she fear¬ ed she should find the Phdipsons, she dared not accede to his wish of being allowed to л ısıt her there, at least at present but she permitted lnm to write occasionally, if he hnd any thing to say particularly interest¬ ing, and she promised to write in return, if his letters required answering " A lover has always something to say which ought to be interesting," said he, significantly " But you are not yet invested with that title, noi do lovers always say much to the purpose," she rephed " If you do write, I prohibit love as the topic." " Yes, the only topic perhaps, or the pre¬ vailing one, but I must touch upon it a little ' " The less the better," said she "I am going from scenes and to scenes, which will but httle assist your cause, I fear ' The visit to Mrs Arlmgham was not marked hy any thing particular, either good or bad There was no appearance of
ofany happiness, nor were there, as hereto¬ fore, any violent disputes. Each seemed to do as he or she wished, independently of the Other, and they seemed to have arrived at the very highest pitch of indifference. Ar¬ lingham was a great deal more from home than he Used to he, and Elizabeth dozed on a sofa, or read novels half the day- spent a great deal of time at her toilet— and, Mrs. Charlton feared, from what she gathered from the indignant old house¬ keeper, flirted more than was decorous,ivith a handsome young man, who луав just come to a large estate in the neighbour¬ hood, and had nothing else to do. Mr. Gemmine, not expecting visitors, was sitting with her in great apparent in¬ timacy, when Althea ran before the servant to announce herself on their first arrival ; but she was herself too circumspect to sus¬ pect Mrs. Arlingham of errors ofthat kind, and therefore did not observe the confu¬ sion of both parties on her entrance ; but Mrs. Charlton, more conversant witli the world,
world, did She too thought that Arling¬ ham looked very coldly at Mr Germame, and observed that he very seldom spoke to tlie young man, or seconded Elizabeth's invitation for the next day, which ahe ne¬ ver faded to give him at parting in the evtning Miss Orford agreed with Mrs. Charlton m thinking something was wrong, and that Lhzabeth was in great danger of fall- mg into a fatal error, both through her own vanity, indolence, and want of thought, and her luisinani s neglect The bubject was almost too delicate to be men tioned to Mrs Arlingham by any ope out of her они family, and Mrs Charlton fear ctl to alarm Althea, or add to the many distressing thoughts she already had for her sisters But she could not, she believed, consistently with her duty, leave Elizabeth unwarned of her danger, and she spoke to lier on the subject, as the privileged friend ot her mother and herself Of such jinvi- leges, however, Elizabeth had no proper idea,
idea, and m very indignant language avow ed her perfect innocence of any improper behaviour, either to or from Mr Germame She flatly told Mrs Charlton she assumed an authonty she had no nght to exercise over her, and that she should never recol¬ lect her conduct without resentment—" In fact," she added, " even if I were blam¬ able in the way yoar friendship suggests, Mr Arlingham has set me the example by his own infidelities He has renewed the affair with Kitty Summers, which he pro¬ mised me to give up, and I am neglected and despised for that vulgar, painted, dress- ed-up minx Mr Germame is a sensible, elegant, pleasant young man, introduced here by Arhngham himself, and I shall not refuse the pleasure of an agreeable com¬ panion, to humour the fancies of my own mother even, or of any fastidious, disap pointed old maid in Chnstendom " To this vulgar personality Mrs Charl¬ ton deigned no reply, and Mrs Arlingham withdrew to blush for it herself, when pas sion
sion had gn cn way to reason Sirs Charl¬ ton had opened her eyes to the growing preference she w as soon conscious of feel¬ ing for the insidious Gei maine, and she eirdeai oured to keep him more at a dis- tmce But she had given hım too much hberty to find that easy, and was obliged to content herself with being more on her guaid m hei own treatment ofhim, at least ivhilst hci visitors were Λνιιΐι her Althea did not hke the man, but she tould not foramomentsuspett that her sis¬ ter did but too well She avoided, as much a, she could, all domestic discussions, parti cuhily as she found Elizabeth disposed to be very bitter agamst her husband, of whose revived intrigue she η as soon in formed, with every angry comment ındıg· nation tould supply, her own provoking conduct being carefully suppressed Al¬ thea had never found expostulation or ad¬ vice of any avail, and finding the ill match¬ ed pair at least more peaceable, she left her, m the hope that those violent altercations ^ol πι E wluch
which had formeily disgraced them both, were sunk in the quieter, if not more fe¬ licitous, system of complete indiffeience She found nothing at Westhaven certainly to advance sir Montague's hopes, for ma¬ trimony appeared in a very unfavourable garb there, even when divested of storms, its clouds of .sullen indifference were al¬ most equally appalling Elizabeth was at this tune, too, in rather better temper than common, for Germaine flattered her vamty, and Arlingham had consented to her going with him to Ran¬ dolph Castle in October—a scheme which she contemplated with great dehght Al¬ théa's account of what she called solemn and fatiguing gran leur, seemed the height of every thing desirable to the ambitious Elizabeth, who appeared to have adopted, by intuition, the same sentiments respect mg üie future as Harriet, and to think the liberty and happiness of neh and youthful widowhood cheaply purchased hy a year or two of imprisonment in such a magni¬ ficent
ficelit solitude. As to the possibility of the earl outliving his young wife, <>r the probability of his continuing so long as to spoil her claims to youthful widowhood, that she would not think of, but antici¬ pated for Harriet all the charms of inde¬ pendence, wealth, and rank. Althea did not attempt to controvert these opmions, well aware that in minds of such a kindred stamp as these two sisters, the answer would be much the same, and they would equally despise and deride her absurd notions. Elizabeth, for tlie first time, saw Althea depart without a wish to retain her longer, for she had no particular point to carry with Arlingham in which her influence might he useful, and she felt that she ra¬ ther shrunk from her observation on Mr. Germame. They parted without any great degree of warmth, and the traveUen proceeded to Mrs. Charlton's house together, where they were to leav« Miss Orford, and then Mrs. E S Charlton
Charlton was to conduct Althea to Mrs. Phihpson's. At Torrington they found Mrs. Amy Finch, as gay, and pleasant, and liappy as ever. She and Miss Orford were soon great friends, and they called them¬ selves the quartette of old maids. Miss Orford declared that Althea did not be¬ long to them, and that in spite of all her assertions, sir Montague Vavasour would yet carry off his prize. Satisfied with leaving Miss Orford in such good hands. Mrs. Charlton desired the ladies to make themselves happy, nnd she and Althea stepped into her carriage, a day or two earlier than they would have done had they left Constantia alone, and a rtipid journey brought them, in afew hours, in sight df the vieaiage.

Even Mrs. Charlton's being there no longer in¬ duced him to exert himself, but, alike gloomy to all, he appealed to paralyze all their faculties by his own ill-humour and seYámple, and then complained of the dull¬ ness he liirtfself merned, 'and made it an «Sense for'being ţo little at home.

A veiy few weeks, passed in the same way, served to convince Mrs Chailton that he was incoriigible to all common repre¬ sentation of his conduct, and felt her last and only hope, and that a forlorn one, rest- ed on Althea and sir Montague Vavasour She thought it just possible that he might α J be

Of her ever attaining such а state, the probabilities were so much against her, that Althe ι ceased to hope and anticipated nothing but sorrow Such, in fact, was liei extreme despondency, that Mrs Charl¬ ton would still have piolonged her stay at 1 eltham for her sake notwithstanding she had seen for some time that her presence there was quite unwished for by Phihpson, but Mrs Sedley had, α few days before, wntten in a style of pressing entreaty for her to go immediately to town, and medi nte between her and her husband whose conduct h id at length completely overcome her long tried patience and worn out her lingei ing affection Even for her ehildi en s sake for whom she had borne so much she could endiu с no longer, and a separation ар peared inevitable and almost equally de sired by both ρ irties Mrs Sedley had no friend to whom she could apply in such an exigency, except Mrs Charlton ¡nd she had too little reliance on her husband s jus tice οι generosity to trust the arrange c t mints

Under these circumstances, Al¬ thea could not request Mrs. Charlton's continuance at Feltham, where she alone could now reap any particular benefit from her presence, since every thing which could be done for Isabella was already settled. She therefore bade adieu with a very heavy heart to this inestimable friend, who seem¬ ed tilted to be always suffering for the vices of others, herself almost wholly ex¬ empted even from errors. Isabella, gratefullj' sensible of all she owed tb her exertions, and scarcely believ¬ ing she should live to see her again, took a most melancholy farewell, too much overpowered to utter those fervent expres¬ sions of respect and thankfulness of which her heart was so full. Mrs. Charlton was sufficiently mistress of her feelings, warm and ardent as they were, not to betray them on this occasion. Her
Her equal cheeifulness and soothing fore¬ bodings checked the sadness of Isabella s , and though she could not impose on Al¬ tlıca, she succeeded in comforting her sis¬ ter, and rchev mg her oppressed spirits, at least for that time She told Althéa she 'hould most probably see Vavasour, and that she would, now circumstances seemed moie m his favour, and the accommoda¬ tions at Tcltl am such as the sisters could be comfortable to offer him, take off the embargo vvhich had been formerly laid on his appearance there, and send him over We mention but seldom this our real heio, because Althéa having prohibited all scenes ot courtship and romance, he would hai illy muke a very advantageous figure in the geneial opinion, for who would feel much interested for a lovei so completely ratinimi? But thoagh rational, he was neither cold nor inattentive, as Althéa's collection of elegant and sensible letters, continually received fiom him, could elo¬ quently prove He was not the kind of g S man
man to lose weeks and months in sighing at the side of his mistress, nnd lavishing those absurd attentions before marriage which only serve to murk the totul nbsence of any after. Satisfied thut he and Althen perfectly understood each other, and that в woman of her character would not allow him to correspond with her, or otherwise encourage his attentions, unless she consi¬ dered herself as under engagements of a sacred nature, he ivas contented to follow the useful occupations which a man of for¬ tune and consequence may always find; embellish his estate for her whom he fully believed would eventually share it, and make all around him comfortable, by his attention to their wants. He respected thc motives which had hitherto kept Al- theafromirrevocablyengaging herself, and felt that when once decidedly accepted, it would be in the persuasion that their cha¬ racters, after diligent investigation, assimi¬ lated, and that she believed herself capable of receiving ahd bestowing happiness. He had
had no idea of that encroaching passion, which, fixed wholly on one person, over¬ whelms every other affection, and renders the lover the only object in creation He did not wish to be himself thus bhndly se- letted from all the world, at the expence of every natural tic, and felt that he loved Althea the better for her not suffering hnn to absorb every sentiment of love and es¬ teem All that he heard and saw of her Iieightened his affection, and added to the eagerness with which he anticipated the hour which would give him such a wife, and conscious that she would learn nothmg of bim that could lessen the esteem and regard for him which he was assuied he possessed, he did look forward to the arri¬ val of such a time with as much certainty as the fluctuation of human events allows. Her letters had of late assumed a tone of greater regard, and she had consulted with lum confidentially on the subject of Phi¬ hpson s conduct and Isabella's distress, to all which he had rephed in such terms as 116 convinced
convinced her he would most readily come forward to their mutual assistance, uhen- ever his repeated oficis of doing so should be accepted The tune when such would be thc case was now come Althea had decidedly consented to become his w ife n rtlrout far ther hesitation, nor hnd she conceded from him that the arguments of Mis Charlton, to whom she referred him, had gn en ad ditrbnal weight to his own influence ovei her heart He immediately wrote to thank her for her compliance, and to fix the day on whith he purposed being at Feltham, in order to arrange every thing for then marriage His lettei, though evidently written under the impression of perfect hnppiness, nnd expressive of the most ar¬ dent nffection, Wns yet collected, r itional, nnd free from high flown oı rom mtıe 1 in gunge Many gnls would have thought it deficient in wnrmth, Isabelin herself, though so fatally com meed of the empli neus of such mere sound, uns not quite phased

George could not refrain from such animadversions upon the character of his brother-in-law, as, though but too just, were painful to Altlıca to hear; and they parted as coldly as they had met, Althéa having the mortification of knowing that their situation was thc topic of every tongue within many miles of them in eve¬ ry direction. In the afternoon Altlıca began to be upon the watch for the only friend who seemed likely to bring her comfort. Every horseman who appeared along the distant road she hoped to discover was Vavasour, and every moment she passed out of her sister's apartment was spent in watching at the window of her own. It was late in October, and the everrirrg was cold and boisterous, and as dreary as her own feel¬ ings. At length she heard footsteps on the gravel-walk beneatii her window, and im¬ mediately afterthe voice of'herlover sound¬ ed sweetly in her ears. He spoke low, and she
she fancied s idly, and she became assured, from his accents, that he had nothing to leain respecting the late event This was really thc case As he drew nearer Feltham, he heaid the disgraceful tale from a vnnety of per¬ sons, nnd in eieiy mncd form which ex¬ aggeration couldgneit Uirder thesecir- cumstances, he thought it betteı to go as ipuclly as he could to the house, and there¬ fore dismissing his seivant with the hoises u hen he came within halt a mile ot the ncarage, and ordenrig hrm to secure ac¬ commodations at the village inn, whither he intended himself to repair at night, he walked foi ward to the house of mourning, and gave to pooi Althea, by his sympa¬ thy nnd .affection, the only comfort she could now receive Her pallid looks and ngitated spirits alaimed hnn on thur fust meeting, but his soothing attentions, lus excellent advice, and his liberal offers of sci vice and assistante to this unhappy family, at length succeeded in allaying the

He would have taken Althea, but she always suffered jvery much from the sea, and was besides apprehensive of meeting Philipson, ivlio, «he had every reason to believe, was in that -country. It was therefore decided that she should remain at the castle till the baronet's return, and then go back to Charleville. She fancied Elizabeth had no intention of returning home at present, for she and Harriet seemed pleased at being together ; and the dullness of the castle was relieved to lady llandolph by having her favourite sister there, whilst to Mrs.

Mrs. Fermer was hanging on Philip- son's arm, and was fhe first to observe sir Montague's approach. A meeting was inevitable; and Philipson dismissing his companion, advanced with evident reluc¬ tance. Coldness equally marked the man¬ ners of each ; but sir Montague was dig¬ nified and at ease, whilst the other evi¬ dently felt the painful inferiority of vice, " Ί hnve taken some pains to see you, Mr. Philipson," said the baronet, after a few moments of mutual silence, "in order to give you that information respecting your family, which I must suppose you ave not yet wholly uninterested to hear.

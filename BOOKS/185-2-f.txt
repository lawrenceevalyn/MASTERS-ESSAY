" Come, véu и, в bestir
bestir yourself, lady," she exclaimed, drawing aside the curtain, and admitting the broad, bright stream of radiance within the chamber ; " the road is long znd lonesome, for many a wearv league Ises 'twixt us and St. Honorée. Holv Mary ! 1 have heard such stories of ban* ditti, that I shall certainly die 'u we reach it not before twilight." " Well/' said Corisande, faìntìv smi¬ ling» " St.Honorée will afford you Chris¬ tian burial, and I will put up a mass for vour soul." " Tis past joke," replied Micheline, thoughtfully ; " all night long have í been dreaming of mountains, and forests and shrieks, and groans; ah! and since da\ light have I been numbering m v beads in my lady marchioness's oratoiy, and praying for the protection of the saints. Heaven fore fend usd .the road isso wild, and so dismal, I query »whether we see the trace of a human bekig in the whole journey/* " * " Then
" Then we shall certainly not be mur¬ dered," observed Corisande. " Sweet saints of mercy forbid !" eja¬ culated Micheline. " Why, lady, voir speak as coldly as though you were going on a party of pleasure. Alack î we shall know pleasure but by name whilst we π re moped at St. Honorées' " Do ^ou class discontent and misery ss inseparable to a monastic life?" asked Corisande. " In truth, lady, 1 do think/* said Mi- encline, " the life of a nun must be dis¬ mal!) si tìpici ; I do think their death's- heads, and their hour-glasses, their night- watching, and their d ay· fast ing, must frighten mirth ; besides, reason tells us we were not created to be useless, and of what use under heaven is a nun ?" Corisande started ; idie gnzed in dis* may on the flushed cheek of the animat¬ ed gni, then seriously observed, " 'Tis web', Micheline, you are not at St. Ho¬ norée ; buch sentiments, there expressed, £ ~ would
would justly condemn you to a cell of penance." " Forgive me, my kind mistress," im¬ plored the self-convicted Micheline, con¬ scious that the flippancy of her tongue bad outstretched all discretionary limits; ° my head is weak, and my spirits are high—and—and------" " May Heaven forgive you !" said Co¬ risande; " it is against Heaven's servants you have offended/"' Micheline crossed her bosom ; Miche¬ line, with a contrite heart, resought ХЫ oratory. It was long after the carriage had dri¬ ven from the chateau gate, ere Corisande could attend to the counsels of her con¬ ductor, father St. Pierre, ere she could acknowledge the attentions of her at¬ tendant Micheline ; hysteric sobs swelled her bosom, and tears of regret and an¬ guish filled her eyes. The adieu of her father was cold, but the last kiss of her mother still glowed upon her lips—the last
last pressure of her parting embrace still thrilled upon her feeling«. Alas ! how uncongenial were the frigid reasonings of age!—How wearying that hacknied precept, submission ! Father St. Pierre dwelt upon the parental and filial ties ; upon the authority of the one, and upon the obedience of the other; he pictured resistance as a rebellion against nature, and augured the anathema of misery and regret to the wilful apostate to order, Corisande spoke not ; her reason %as unconvinced, yet she dared not brave the torrent of argHinent ; she admitted the duty of obedience, but not that passive obedience which sacrifices happiness to caprice, not that blind, that indiscrimi¬ nate submission, which martyrs every hopeoQ the giant shrine of ambition· imperceptibly did the wild beauties of creation rivet the attention and lure the mind of Corisande from her own hoard of cares ; on every side she beheld tbe exuberance of nature; long and varied вЗ perspectives
perspectives; mocking the pencil to per¬ petuate; sometimes the road winding amongsteeps; sometimes edging the very brink of precipices; now delving to the mountahťs base; now sweeping midst delightful vallies, picturesquely watered, and teeming in the varied array of profu¬ sion. It was in the heart of one of these val¬ lies that the travellers paused forrest and refreshment; and whilst the jaded mules browsed on the rich herbage, and quail¬ ed at the crystal stream, Corisande and Micheline, leaving father St. Pierre and the attendants reposing beneath the shade, wandered in search of fruits and wild flowers amidst the surrounding thickets. Heedless of danger, lured on from shrub to shrub, and blossom to blossom, they soon lost sight of their escort, nor till a low and murmuring accent caught their ear, did they dream of imprudence; then with trembling earnestness they listened; and then with features bleached with fear d
fear, did thev cling to the arm of each other. * % Tis you who can save my soul/* exclaimed a voice; ťť 'tis you, and only you, who can wipe away the stains of blood ; 'tis you who can soften mr, even as wax is moulded to impression; 'Ш you who can expunge the past record of murder, or hurl me still deeper into the gulf of perdition. 5 * Corisande's cheeks grew paler ; Μι¬ ί heitne shuddered, and murmured a pra) er. " No, not me/' was the reply, in ac¬ cents of feminine softness; * f 'tis re¬ pentance, 'tis atonement which alone can aid you, «Betray not the trust im¬ posed ; conduct me to the parent your specious artifice has deceived, and if í cannot esteem, 1 will at least strive to be grateful/' u And will you forget the past ? if re* sumed the former voice. "Tel! me, lovely в i censor,
censor, will you forgive ? — wïü yva pity ?—will you—" The accents sunk to a whisper. "1 will be grateful/' repeated his companion ; " beyond that I will not promise. Now bear me to my mother, and when under her protection, I will thank you ; nay, conscience will register the benefit, for what is half so soothing as its approval ľ' Corisande and Micheline shrunk deeper into the thicket, for the wind, wafting aside the foliage, disclosed the speakers^—disclosed a girl of angel beau¬ ty, attended by a man whose ferocious aspect baiïled the assumed smile of conci¬ liation. His dress was the dress of har¬ dihood ; a leather thong girded his waist, from which impended a cutlass, whilst across his shoulder was slung the death-aiming arquebuse. " Cruel and unkind one!" he murmured, moving slowly by the side of the Hebe-like girl» " tù
" to spurn a love so profound, a heart so devoted. Name but the proof you require—name but the purchase of a smile ? Have î noi steeped my sword in the blood of him who dared to gaze even with an eye of freedom on your beautv ?—Have I not-~~~~ pt " Remember your promise," inter¬ rupted the shuddering stranger ; " your vow, as mine, must be fulfilled. Sum¬ mons your party, and let us quit this val* ley ; you tell me I iule, wherefore then am I here, when already my wishes are on the wing ?" The stranger sunk upon his knee be¬ fore her; he snatched her struggling hand to his iips, then springing up, he took the arquebuse fram his shoulder^ and discharged its contents in £he air. The report was echoed by many, and quick as thought were they surrounded by a host as armed and as ruffian-like aa himself. Ágain Micheline breathed ал ave-ma· в 5 тЪ,
ria, and again the heart s*blood of Con¬ sande seemed to freeze in her bobom. The lovely stranger shrunk not at their approach ; no start, betraying alarm, chased the vivid bloom from her cheek ; a calm diomitv marked her actions; and when one of the men announced the mules to be on the opposite side of the mountain, rejecting the о fie red arm of him who appeared to be the chief, she proceeded undaunted towards the ascent. Steep and craggy, it was long ere the party attained the summit of the moun¬ tain ; sometimes pausing to recoser breath, they appeared to look into the valley; then again toiling onwards, they seemed to totter in mid-air,as though sus¬ tained but by the clustering shrubs which dotted the precipice. Corisande and Micheline stole not from their hiding-place until they had entirely lost sight of the party, and even then with a step so light did they retrace their path,, that scarcely did the downy head

cavern, in every deepening shade, thek minds pictured the form of the marauder, and their hearts sunk in anticipating dread ; every sound reverberated by sul¬ len echoes, was as the knell of death, every whispering zephyr as the stealing prelude to murder. The purple bosom of the west glowed with the last tint of radiance as the par¬ ty emerged from the defile, and the wide« expanding prospect, snatching a thou¬ sand variegations, seemed touched with the fairy finger of enchantment. Rich and picturesque was the outline, nature and cultivation alike striving for pre¬ eminence; streams meandering amidst vineyards and olive-grounds; plains crowned with smiling verdure, and bound by long chains of Alpine scenery, fring¬ ed with lofty pines, and in part wrapped by the grey ether of rising mists. Fear vanished from the mind of Cori¬ sande, and quick did awe give place to admiration; her eye encompassing the contrast
cofttmt tapast barrenness, wandered from sportive nature to exuberant art, mea¬ sured peaks towering to the horizon's limits, and delved midst plains enriched by the toils of man ; here resting on an obelisk, towering in derision of subduing time ; and there encompassing the tot¬ tering ruins of past magnificence; now shapeless, roofless, mantled with close clustering ivy, and threatening destruc¬ tion to the browsing herds at their base. She no longer dreamt of banditti, she no longer shrunk in dismay ; entranced by the objects before her, even her own little sorrows were forgotten ; poetic fancy glowed with the rich scenes of ra¬ diance ; her tablets were in her hand, her pencil already in motion, and in a few short minutes her thoughts were mo¬ delled in the following line*» :—.

The grev mist of twilight was *> rad uai - ly deepcnînır, into the ebon shrj . ! of night, when the travellers ha!led the aw- fully-wild approach to Sr. Ib)::-:ivC — wh( 4 ;i thev beheld the huge rojk k ,po:i which the convent bulged—wbc.i thc ,r heard the incessant roar of the caîa^acï, whielì precipitating itself f:om îî^e а/»- ¡oining steeps, formed a perturbed *ru:r at its entrance. The rough bridge, sweeping athwart the shelving b*d of the stream, was hollowed by the chisel ornature: towering o'er the de: ıh *)Ги- found, it seemed as though it had mock¬ ed the wreck of worlds—as though it had
braved the mighty throe which had cleft the rock asunder. Gloomy groves of pine and cypress dotted the cliffs above, waving as a canopy over the grey turrets of St. Honorée, and deepening the som¬ bre shade of its approach Father St. Pierre and his companions quitted the carriage at the base of the steep, and whilst the weary mules toiled up the ascent, they struck into a winding path leading immediately to the gate of the convent. Awe-impressive was the scene, as Corisande paused upon the rocky arch, as fearfully she gazed upon the yawning abyss o'er which it totter¬ ed, and traced the swollen torrent, clash¬ ing in noise and foam down its precipi¬ tous and shelving channel. Save the gi¬ gantic steeps, spreading in wild fantastic imagery, the rapid strides of night soon veiled every object; and the travellers passed within the outer gate of St. Ho- norée^ grateful for the promised shelter ©f repose» CHAP.

His letters be- spoke
spoke the colour of his feelings; ηα tlıî'ili of raptı., e maiknd the announce¬ ment oí hisbpeedv rctmu into Provence, Λ meeting with hi; mother, his sister, his family, imparted a momentary glow; but the hea\\ trance of peace, the si ιυν bering b y ank of miction, was inimic d to hb ini ıı tary piowess. The dini, the almost ra) less eyes cf D'A\İ7noîi,bCi*ra\ evl also an uneasinc .s : t heart, a listless inquietude, a prc\ing d.c · jection, ^hidi baíľled even the pc'se\ei * ing pi obe of friendship. Lnveiejcd . the cold cloud of reserve, he spo ,e * * t of his future prospects, he hintti/not ι possibility of what the morrow m -gut produce; he evaded e\ery inquny oi self, und íirmly resisted the p reading ta· treaties of Mortaigne to attend him la the chateau. " You nifbt ассошилпу me, mv fiiend/* said «the count % ;ou muat re¬ ceive the grate tu i «им , of my kin¬ dred; already .do (Ley know you by re-
port ; thev too must love vou for vour virtues." "'Impossible !" said D'Avignon, mourn- full v ; " not inclination, but f:\te } pe is to α different direction." " Tell me α tie more impressive than friendship?" questioned Mortaigne, " an interest superior—-" " Honour/' interrupted D'Avignon, with а shudder almost palsied. Mortaigne beheld him with amaze¬ ment ; he pitied, yet he knew not how to resolve the struggle which preved so evidently on his feelings. Could it be pride which scorned the seeming weight of obligation ? or could it be some se¬ cret snare of t lie heart, which militated against the calls of worldly interest? He longed to spring the mine of buried uneasiness, yet knew not how, for he feared to wound where most he wished to serve. It was the evening previous to the count'-s intended return into Provence, that
that he pursued the footsteps of D'Avig¬ non, that he traced him amid the romantic passes of the adjoining mountains, and delved in pursuit the sombre gloom of an almost impervious defile. D'Avignon, regardless of the stealing advance upon his solitude, courted a nar¬ row path,, o'er which the giant rocks, al¬ most meeting overhead, scowled in fu¬ nereal shadow. Dwarf-birch and prick* ly-holly thinly dotted their flinty bo¬ soms, whilst here and there, as though to mock the seeming threat of barrenness, vegetation glowed in promiscuous tufts of golden saffron, pansies, violets, and wild lavender. Though the receding form was dark¬ ened, almost obscured, yet did Mortaigne advance, nor did he pause until he caught the low accents of his friend, until he saw him rest beneath a chiselled arch of nature. ' Ct ire!y, if breathless listening attention was ever admissible, it was in the interested feelings of the count; it was
was in one who pined to glean the pent- up hoard of sorrow, to sympathize, to al¬ leviate. Base as the mind in which it springs are the mean instigations of cu¬ riosity ; grovelling, degenerate the heart which probes but through the incite¬ ments of self: not so the philanthropist» who, purloining the tale of woe, admi¬ nisters the he*ling balsam, echoes the full sigh, and staunches the scalding tea-, Mortaigne shrunk within the excavatio-n of the rock ; he stood almost at the side of his friend, and yet the close incluster- ing brushwood, the far-spreading bram« bib, and luxuriant thistle, uniting in one common mass of deep,, of indistinct fo¬ liage, veiled him from the glance of ob¬ servation. " To-morrow/' faltered D'Avignon, and Mortaigne scarcely breathed, " to¬ morrow, when thy beams, oh sun ! shall gild these rocks with parting radiance, when this solitude, as now, shall glow beneath thy last trembling and refulgent ray,
ray, then — then------" He paused; he struck his hanii against his forche id-— ** then," he continued, with а bitter^igh, " the effort will be pas!, the expiation offered ; then honour will urge no fur¬ ther sacrifice, then memorv will reco. d no heavier pang." <4 D'Avignon/' ad Morîa'gnc, y leid¬ ing to the tide of in nuĽve feeling, ui.d breaking at oiilc ίιοαι h\ c(*\cn sane- îuarv, ''reveal that ¡ лпц, reveal /ut ч~ 'Tİticc. 1 bave folloACu ven, not lo stea' upon your eonii 'ere, not to pulloin vour secret gnefc, but to imp/ore vou hv our bond of fellowship, by the s cud behest of sworn friendship, to eru >h t и"; swell of romantic sci.tiinent, to forswear ihis imperious ude of mbtaĽm honour T he v ou*h «-wted ; his cheek ík s! ^ I crimson; his cv*- i s beamed the kit d v¿ tire of enthusiasm.

The sun had burst forth in radiant glo¬ ry, h h saftron ray«; had mellowed the far- spreading prospect, had dissipated the murky vapours of night, had given a ri¬ pened lustre to every luxuriant object. ere the count shook off the numbing torpor of slumber, ere equipped for his journey, he waited but the presence of his friend. " Go hasten the chevalier/* he exclaimed, as, impatient of delay, he threw open the window; " teìì him all nature chides his tardiness ; that hill and dale resound with the matin hymn of praise." " The chevalier^ my lord, is nowhere to be found," said Gamaliel, returning. " Not in his chamber?" eagerly ques¬ tioned Mortaigne. " No. my lord, neither has he tenant¬ ed his chamber this night," replied Ga* malie!, " for the conch is unruffled, and the pillow impressed." Amazed, perplexed, Mortaigne sought himself a solution of the mvsterv ; the с 4 words,
words, the agitation of D'Avignon re* curred to memory ; he mused o'er the last night's dialogue, and recalled again the fervent pressure of his adieu.— " Strange, strange/* he thought, as mournfully he glanced round the apart¬ ment; "some secret motive, some hid¬ den cause, waylays his peace, instigate, his actions. Poor D'Avignon !" and then he sprung forward, for in the same moment his eyes descried and his hand grasped a paper,sealed and directed to him¬ self. Eagerly he tore it open, eagerly he perused the contents ; but, alas ! no light dawned upon the subject, no clue to unra¬ vel the web of fate. " I go whither friend¬ ship cannot trace me," he wrote; " I sro with a heart heavv and a mind op- pressed. Tax not my gratitude—tn\ not my affection ; my crime is presumption, ray punishment regret, I have dared to soar with the mighty eagle, but I return to my own littleness; I have dared for a moment to forget the colour of my destiny,

Mortaigne read aud re-read the letter : disappointment, regret, anger, pit), al¬ ternately succeeded, alternated rjged, One moment his eyes glistened with soft¬ ened feeling, the next his checks glowed with the burst of reprehension ; now the actions of D'Avignon were ascribed to honour, now prideseemed to lurk beneath ih e

Can it bc wendcrcd, that as the day de¬ clined,
clined, Mortaigne found himself bewil¬ dered in the maze of incertitude, and un¬ able even to retrace his own wander¬ ings? Not a human shelter presented itself to his searching eye, not a symbol of cultivation doited the extensive w:;>,t* before him ; rock, in wild order, tow¬ ered over rock, mountain rose above mountain; deep precipices scowled amidst blackened thickets of pine and chesnut; and the loud and monotonous roar of cataracts, bursting through the flintv bosom of the cliffs, deadened every lesser sound. Still, with unwearied toii, did Mortaigne advance, not in ihe hope of overtaking the fugitive, but simply to seek shelter for the night. He cross¬ ed the long plain which formed the summit of the steep he had ascended ; he paused upon the opposite descent, as the rich colouring of the setting sun, reflecting on the adjacent peaks, tinged, varied them into new forms of sublimi¬ ty* Every feeling of his nature was ele- \}.U:d ;
crouched at its haî;e, upon the meander¬ ing river which glided peacefully within lis borders not swollen, not breaking down the barrers of restraint, not spread¬ ing the wild track of desolation, not rocked bv the tempers of the world, not agitated with the gu^is of passion ; no; nature holds forth a lesson to the heart, and man sinks in the comparison; man, who, a^St. Augurine, in the tenth book of his Confessions, beautifully expreses» S{ соеч far co observe the sum mi is of r.ioiïntaïns, the waters of the sea, the be- *7¡nnin<2s and the courses of rivers, the immensity of the ocean; but he neglecis himself." The heart of the count was full ; it was softened even to feminine weakness; a tear glistened in his eye ; a sigh swell¬ ed his bosom. 'Tis true, he had never bou ed to the vi\id, the ethereal flame of love ; but his perceptions were strong, and his feelings were alive to enthusiasm. In
Jn the sun's fast-fading tints he could trace the emblem of man's mortality ; he could read the epitome of hie in the ga¬ thering shadows, which, like decay, crowding the once-brilliant promises of meridian splendor, threatened to in¬ volve all alike in one unvarying blank, " God of nature!" he apostrophized, " even with the ephemera of the day mav man weiidi the balance of his strength ; for a little season he sports upon the ocean of life, and as the air-bal¬ loon bubble, vanishes at the light com¬ pression of a straw ľ 1

Так shrill tinkling of the matin b°il broke the deep dumber of ('oriaintle; she staited, she gazed dojbtfuih round the chamber ; every οίκοι was itran/e. every idea confused, Micheli ° answer¬ ed not her call, nor even did the light tt ead
tread of the sisters passing down the cor¬ ridor recaí the conviction of where she was. She had dreamed of her mother , she had felt the warm pressure of her em¬ brace ; perturbed images crowded upon fancy ; and not till the opening door disclosed the tall figure of a nun, was ber banishment to St. Honorée remembered ; then a sigh swelled her bosom, then a tear trembled in her eye. " Why so sad ?" asked sister Mathilde, attentively marking her emotion. "Praise is due for the past hours of tranquil re¬ pose, not sorrow at the birth of a new day." " True, sister/* replied Corisande ; " but will not the heart cling to absent friends ?—Will not------" " All are friends at St. Honorée," in¬ terrupted the nun ; " no animosity, no disunion festers the peace of St. Ilono- ree's inmates." " As yet, I can lay no claim to friend¬ ship/' meekly observed Corisande ; " a few.
few, a very few hour**: back, and my ex¬ istence was unknown." " Still are vou in error/* resumed the nun, forcing a lnnomid smile. " Three days back did a messenger from the mar« quis de Koussillon announce the ap¬ proach of his daughter ; berides, 'tis but to expunge the flight of time, and the lady Hortense, the once-gentle inmate of this very chamber, stands before me." "My mother!" eagerly exclaimed Corisande, starting from her pillow, and anx-ouslv gazing in the face of the ¿ister; " did you know my mother ?" " Yes, 1 knew her, and I loved her," rejoined the nun. " Nature has given a model of her person ; may the heart be alike excellent ! Adieu, mv «hild ! I leave }\ηι for other duties: praise is the spontaneous spring of gì atitude, and gra¬ titude is the best incense the soul can offer/' " True/' thought Corisande, quitting herlow pallet and hurrying on her clothes, "gratitude
" gratitude is lhe best inceme the soni cent offer, for 'tis the lesson whicli man gleans İn the never-failing matin of awakening creation." Corisande attentively examined her littic chamber ; each separate article of furniture became an object of interest— her mother had stood upon thesame spot *—her mother had reposed upon the same bed ; the same chair had supported her, and the same table had administered to her comforts. The gloomy walls of St. Honorée became familiarized; she felt no longer a stranger ; and when mount¬ ed upon the chair, she threw open her narrow casement, and gazed through the .bon grating; when the morning breeze played upon her features, and her eyes measured the pine-clad summits οΐ the adjacent cliffs, her bosom heaved with the sensations of mingled awe and thanks- giving. The prospect, though less wild, was no less picturesque than on the opposite side
mìe the monastery ; detached patches of cultivation adorned the cliff-;, whilst vt the base, as far as the eve cviűd reach, cvtfpnď'd ' i ^o*' fr a t t*n p b mì of luxuriant beauty. The stream, les p >rturbed, still played from r^ck to r о с к, t umi)! ing, at irregular distances, in wild cascades, and lightening with iti white and feathery spray its dark and idimv bed ; now frin¬ ged with aqueous plants, it broke midst obstructing rocks ; and now, delving its subterranean channel, it seemed to dis¬ appear but to concéntrete its force, but to burst forth with rcxloublcd power. The plain was interspersed with its me¬ andering ; alike adorning and enriching, it lolled midst teeming olive-çrounds, midst vineyards and smilir.·? corn-tieldc, Forests of mulberry and chesnut lined the sloping sides of the adjacent moun¬ tains; while above, in shapeless irregula¬ rity, mingling almost with the clouds, which appeared to hang like misty ла - pours on their summits, towered a long гапце
range of cliffs, now blackened with pine, now barren and desolate, save where pur¬ ple clusters of sun-scorched heath, <a\d vagrant tufts of golden-blossoming saff¬ ron, contrasted the grey tints of their flinty surface. "Poor bird!" exclaimed Micheline, entering unobserved, "well may yon mount and look through the gratings of your cage. Holy saints! in what a chamler to lodge the lady Corisande de Roussi lion i" " It was once the chamber of my mo¬ ther/' said Corisande. " Ah 1 then 'tib no wonder my lady marchioness wept and mourned so sor¬ rowfully at your departure. She re¬ membered the years of past penance, and trembled at the misery of y our lot.'* " Misery !" echoed Corisande; " í see no misery, save what a d û&u tidied minú inri iets." Micheline gazed in anazement on the placid features of her youthful mistress; zhe
ъЪе heard no murmur of complaint, she traced no tear of inquietude. r Jem Maria!" she exclaimed, "what arts, what spells, what machinations have thev already used to produce such a change î Holy martyrs ϊ 'tis but to send a young maiden to St. Honorée, and she is halfa nun in the first twelve hours. Why, I suppose, if my lord marquis was to choose for you a gay, tall, handsome voung bridegroom, with eves like sloes, teeth like ivory, and cheeks like roses, you would drop him a humble curtse^, and say, ŕ No, thank you, my lord, I'd rather be a nun." " And perhaps, Micheline/* said Co¬ risande, smiling, " of two evils it would be choosing that of the least magnitude. It would, however, be avoiding those myriads of ills with which we are told the world teems ; it would be ensuring an unalloyed existence here, and reap¬ ing a rich harvest of bliss hereafter." " Query whither an unalloyed existeriez wouldn't
wouldn't cloy though/' archly observed Micheline ; " like sweets to the palate, we should soon pine for the alterative oí a few acids," " In this world we are never satisfied," rejoined Corisande ; *' in this world man is prone fo covet what is withheld, to re¬ ject what is offered/* " Then," said Micheline, "I own my¬ self a true daughter of this world ; for already do I most anxiously covet liber¬ ty ; nay, I would give the universe to be once beyond that frightful bridge, once out of the sight of these drearv mountains. I am sure the inside of St. Honorée is like a sepulchre, and the ret¬ side a spot deserted by every thing so¬ cial. As for that moving piece of pre¬ cision, sister Mathilde, she looks just 3ike one of the marble-——" " Sister Mathilde was the early friend of my mother," interrupted Corisande. " Well/' remarked Micheline, " had lister Mathilde been like m ν lady mar- ? chionchs,
chîoness, a wife and a mother, jvho know s but she too------ ** " Sister Mathilde has filled the voca¬ tion Heaven assigned her/' agar* inter¬ rupted Corisande. "If sorrow, or if mis¬ fortune drove her to this retirement, агя- ply has the sacrifice been compensated, for she appears iich in that unecpialled blessing, a contented mind/* i% Methinks," pursued the loquacious girl, " it requires more than one glance to decipher the human mind." ' y Certainly, hypocrisy may veil the mind/' replied Corisande; " but where no aim is to be achieved, the calm of in¬ ternal peace cft extends itself to the fea¬ tures. Sister Mathilde, though pale and almost shadowy, wears neither the stamp of mortified passion or remorse of soul ; she looks rather like a saint gradually waning from the coil of flesh, anxious for the promised bourne of rest, yet pa¬ tient under the destined hours of trial/* " And a precious store oť patience İt vol. п. я must
must need," exclaimed Micheline, " ία wear one's knees out at prayers, and eyes out at watching ! Mother of God î ina little week, ϊ suppose, you will think no more of hiding vour beanti ful locks un*- dev a novice \ eil, than sister Mathilde docs in uttering an Ave-Maria." " Remember," gravely observed Co» risande, " sister Mathilde was the friend of my mother ; as such, she must neither be spoken or thought of with disrespect." " Disrespect ľ' repeated Micheline, devoutly crosoing herself; "Heaven fore* fend 1 should ever treat with disrespect a sacı ed member of the church ! Trul·*, I have a profound reverence for the mo¬ ther superior, down to the very portress at the irate; but yet I could wish, my r w eet \oung mistress, neither you ori should swell the list of mart) rs. Poor Arnaud would bc broken-hearted ; and as lor the boat-house poet------ s> Corisande started ; Corisande's tell¬ tale cheek flushed crimson. Micheline
Micheline smiled, and significantly folding her arms, continued, v * ¡ΐ you were a nun, dear lady, pray how many penitentiaries would it requiic to ex¬ punge this transgression r'* is I am noia nun/* faitcred Corisande. ** >":>, no, neiíher must you become a цип,** r.rcidv rejoined Micheliae, "lest Heaven should be jealous of this boat- Juiiie purt." Again corisande's eyes sought the '•round, and aiïain the full tide of her ieeîing*» pjovved iu every lineament of her e\ pvc-:'/ ve features. ît was too true; ¡he 'iccrct hemage of her heart forbade the >лс: ilice ; Micheline had touched the ι hord, г. ml the vibration produced nought but misery ; the imagined calm of re- «ignation vanished ; the boundary of her 11 1 tie chamber, though once occupeid by lier revered mother, no, nor the heavy wails of St. Honorée itself, circumscrib¬ ed her wishes: thought wandered in wild, ;:ì rimost shapeless latitude ; the world d 2 seemed
•seemed strewed with the never-fadin » flowers of bliss, and melancholy, and la¬ mentation, and woe, in an instant jaun¬ diced the late promised prospect of con¬ tent. Every feeling of her heart rebel¬ led against the coercion of restraint ; parental authority seemed swollen into n rannic usurpation, and hope seemed to expire even on the altar of this once so eagerly solicited alternative. Such often is the inconsistency of hu man wishes; such the blindness of hu¬ man foresight: vse crave with aviditv ; we sow supinely ; we reap ungratefully. Amonit the numerous inmates of Sr. Honorées cloister, the sister Mathilde alone attained that influence over the mind of the new boarder, which beguiles even the tediousness of confinement : she was a being far excelling the com¬ mon order; a being whom to know and to reverence were one. Superior to almost everv imperfection of human nature, living in the constant practice of self-denial,
self-denial, devoting every moment she could steal from the sacred duties of her vocation, to the frre exercise of benevo¬ lence, sh< could yef palliate tîıe enors of others—^he could listen to the murmur oí contrition—she could wipe away the tear of penitent guilt. Peculiar circum¬ stances had banished her the busy haunts of society. Not caprice, not thegloom of misanthropy, not the overthrow of vaunt¬ ing ambition, had fated her the inmate of а reh'îîious cel! ; ¡t was meek and leciti- roate devotion, engendered b v mistur- fune, awakened bv the blighted hopes of love, nurtured iu the heart bv reflec- tion, by conviction, by mature delibera¬ tion. She had seen, she had deplored ihe wreck of devastating passion ; she had traced the triumphs of Treacher]/; she had beheld love anil early confidence deeding beneath the stroke of its perni¬ cious wiles, Tlying from man, she hut ¿ought communion with God; mourning r 3 for
for the woes ofa friend and brother, she had bent her knee in prayer alike for her welfare, for his restoration to tranquillity. The lady abbess too was pious, but her piety was tinctured with fanaticism ; her zeal was to swell the list ot saints; her arguments to steal the unfixed mind, to magnify the a I ready- w eight y catalogue of worldly ills, Imbibing ihc too-frequent gloom of misanthropy, living in the hourly practice of superstitious faiths, peace seemed enchrined within her little community, and care, and sin, and dan¬ ger, to reign without its walls. She w\ts contracted, but not ignorant ; she wai prejudiced, but not unjust ; she fancied the veil of profession an expunger of all terrestrial ills; she fancied a life of ил- mingled devotion au absolver of past transgressions; yet did she not denoum с those whom dut\' whom circumstance7 or whom inclination condemned to min¬ gle with the world ; nay, she would pa* tiently
tiently listen to dissenting argument, and when she could not convince, she would pray for conversion. As in every situation ín life, various disposition«?, habits, znd practices, mark various characters, sometimes stamping the wellbeing, sometimes marring the harmony of social converse, one common chain appeared alike to bind the liberty and the interests of the sisters of St. Ho¬ norée, for few were the exceptions to the general svstcm of unanimity. The calm monotony of a religious life admits but of little comment; the matin service, and the vesper hymn,, alike opening, alike closing each day ; and the diurnal as¬ semblage in the refectory, and the mo* derate excursions in the extensive and romantic gardens of the monastery, be¬ ing the only cessations from habitual commune, " What a power of ages- has yon mo¬ nastery stood !" exclaimed Micheline, as Corisande, resting at the extremity of в 4 the
the garden, turned to behold the brigb! reflections of the setting sun illumining its storied panes; "how many storms, how many tempests have shaken its foun¬ dation ! and yet it was oncea wilderness, svith scarce one stone lavine upon ano- ther." " Cities have sprung from one solitary foundation-stone," observed Corisande, " and events of the greatest magnitude may frequently be traced to the most trivial causes." " True," said Micheline, thoughtfully î " but the interposition of Heaven is ηα trivial cause ; and signs, and wonders, and miracles, can be t' ceci but to one band. The saints forbid there should be any more miracles while we sojourn at St. Honorée ! for I vcrilv believe, if I were to meet a marble statue stalking among the cloisters, though it descended from heaven itself, I should expire at the sight, ϊ am no coward, and yet I vou Id not at midnight venture alone in the
the sacristy of the chapel to purchase а regalia." г* " Coward/ 1 repeated Corisande, arch¬ ly smiling, ( ' no, no, my good giri, yo:i have the courage ofa heroine, Buí ccm;, tell me what stranile* tale has been со.гь- cd for your annoyance У " In truth, I suspect not the coinage of any tale/' resumed Micheline, half piqued at the seeming reflection on her credulity ; " it is a tradition, as old as the hills, and as authentic as the sacred tenets of our worship/' " Let me hear this tradition/' said Co risande, seating herself upon a projecting point oí rock. " The evening is serene, the mnrmurinsr of the water soothing, and mv soiri ts attuned to miracles.— Gome, begin, Micheline; did St. Hono¬ rée sorini; uo in one night? ov mav we trace its heavy walls to the slow produce of worldly architects ?" 4i Oh no !" exclaimed Micheline, eager to recite the tale of wonder, " St. Ho- n 5 noree,
noráe, Heaven rest her canonized bones! in this very desert, nay, upon this very spot, was tempted bv the devil, in the form of a fine handsome young man ; and the chaste virgin, in commemoration of her spiritual victory—for she loved the young man with mortal pas*ion- built this abbey, endowed it, and poured all her wealth, and all h^ r rich stores, into its sacristy. Who knows," she continu¬ ed, lowering her voice io a whisper, "but an abbey may yet spring upon the ruins of the boat-house." " Pshaw !" said Coridalide, half sigh¬ ing at the digression, ť< wc live not in an age for miracles: proceed, good Mi¬ cheline, with your story." " Poor sister Ursule, the old lame por¬ tress at the gate, declares when she first came to St. Honorée, that not an eve oí All Saints passed v, if hout the great bell ín the belfry tolling fora full hour; and that, though the nuns all watched, not a living soul could be seen; and that the withered
withered hand of St. Honorée, which is preserved asa precious reliek in t hesa ris- Tv, was alwav missino w hi Kt the be' i \sas tolling. And s'ster Ursi/e sa}s ------" <f But what has that »odo with the tra¬ dition ?'* interrupted C\>n3ande, kf ît has much to do with the tradition,'* replied Micheline, «rwclv ; * for the toiling of the bell,and the disappearance ol the withcíed h m L i , a> \ ou sh dl hear, a \ earl ν expiation of tians;iw*Ion.

Well, she was very pious, and very de- \out, and dreamt of nothing but hea^en, and mait\is, and holy raptures; she ne- \er missed a confession, 1,01 c\er thought or nun ed without a patcniostet 4 : nas
she numbered her beads in her sleep, and never failed to turn over the leaves of her missal before she wooed her pil¬ low. The world was but a state of pro¬ bation, and the world's allurements, ard the world's joys, were despised. The fair Honoree rejected every advance ίο mar¬ riage ; she combattecl the arguments of her father, and destined herself the spouse of heaven. " But mark the futility of human re¬ solves ; mark the inconsistency of hu¬ rjan judgment ; enthusiasm changed its colour, and poor Honorée became the zealot of a new credence. The subtle poison of love mingled with her being, and everv nightly dream teemed with the image of her heart's enslaver. In a pil¬ grim's garb, the youth had knelt at the same altar; he had echoed the aspira¬ tion of piety ; he had shadowed the foot¬ steps of her daily haunts; and now, in si¬ lent devotion, did he too bow to а dif¬ ferent saint. The eyes of Honorée stole his
his from heaven—the smile of Honorée rivetted the charms of eternal bondage-— Honorée no longer pined to be a saint? тш longer pined for a life of self-restric¬ tion ; thit» world held forth the prom be of bliss, and the visionary projects of religion gradually became weaker. But alas, poor maid ! she little dreamt the snare she hugged—she little guessed the subtle artifice of the deceiver ! Like the serpent coiling around the heart of the confiding Eve, he lured her from her duty ; he entangled her feet in the thorns and briars οΐ incertitude, for daily did she meet him in the solitude of the cha- peb hourly did he gain ground upon her feelings. tk it was lone: π fter darkness had veiled the glory of the heavens that, wrapped in the trance of repose, Hono¬ rée found herself transported to the bowers of Elysium. All that was exqui¬ sitely rare, all that was seductively charm¬ ini» met her eve; flowers of the most vivid
vivid hues perfumed the air: fruiu of the mo4 tempting aspect hung pendant from the branches: tiie groves were wa¬ tered by meandering Mreamlets; and birds, whoi>e plumage cla/.zled like gems in the ыт, carrolled in sweete&t me¬ lody. The favoured pilgrim u as at her side; his arm supported her fooMeus; his words were as the honey of Ilvbla to her senses; she hung upon his accents; she inhaled delicious poison from his lips. He led lier to a variegated bower ; he reclined on the mossv í arpet .\t her Îcct ; he dwelt on the joys of this» w οι lá ; he painted them superior to the jon , of heaven. Honorée started; her princi¬ ples rallied; she struggled in the Uvl : w i tii artful derign, the pretended р/цгпч vielded but to becotne the victor ; fake tcjvá trembled in his ev. s; tieachcrous bjghs swelled his bosom.

" Not t ilKhe reached the centre of thi< solitude, not till riie recognised the wild of her dream, did the voice of conscience breathe more than in whispers; tiie n every dormant principle revived ; then compunction, horror, and remorse, gnawed like vultures in her bosom.— ' Heaven guide me !* she exclaimed, rais- ing her clasped hands and eves; " Пел- ven restore me to the bounden track of my

" Honorée shrunk not in terror or dh- may ; she breathed an Ave-Maria, and a f e\erv bead which fell, her courage and her fortitude revived. She saw the veil of deception vanish; she saw the baseless fabric of sophistry crumble beneath the broad bright ravs of truth. The li£»ht- ning flashed around ; tlie thunder roared in deafening peals; and the hea\ing earth, rocked by nature's vast convulsion, pawned in a frightful chasm at her feef. Honorée Îelt the arch upon which she stood—and the same which now and ever since has spanned the torrent—tremble beneath her feet; sure destruction threat¬ ened; yet did she reject the offered pro¬ tection of the pilgrim ; л et did she call with frantic vehemence on Heaven, on the genius of her destiny, on the saint of her

That moment withered it to the wrist—that moment perpetuated a memento of woman's weakness. Ho¬ norée snatched it away in horror; almost fainting, she sunk upon her knees, she pressed the cross, which hung upon her bosom, to her heart, to her lips.

Deep was the gloom which enwmppee. the valley, profound the etili calm wĽíh reïgned within its bosom : nature, in par¬ tial sleep, had silenced the warbling uÎıhy feathered choir, and man's daring foot ap¬ peared not to profane the solitude. Iu vain the count de Mortaigne paused upon ihe sloping declivity ; in vain his eager eye pierced each opposite corner: no cm·
Mem of cultivation varied the outline, no curling smoke, uo promiscuous dwelling, lured on to shelter. Kork continued to crowd upon rock, mountain to tower upon mountain ; the wild goat browsed on the surface ; the eagle built in the crags. Undaunted, he pressed forward ; he descended the almost perpendicular steep, now ыг taming himself by thick clustering bru-.hwood, now clinging to the exuberant branches of o'crsha- dowing chesnuts. Ent even when he pierced the defile, even when he attained the wished-for valley, no shelter cheered his toil, no reward crowned his labour; the same deathlike stillness prevailed, the same gloomy stamp of desolation. The sun had long set, the last burnish of the sky had faded, the clamp vapours of night roiled o'er the hills, and the hasty strides οΐ darkness threatened to envelop alt in one nncheckered blank. Mortaigne paused for α moment; it v.as but for a moment ; the distant bark of
of a watch-dog gave spurs to exertion, and again he pursued his route. A narrow path branched oil* from the left—it wound up the steep—it wa* lost in the thickening gloom of hanging- woods. A path could not be the pro¬ miscuous sport of nature, a path spoke the hauras of т?л, a path beckoned on Ю shelter. Brave, even to the extreme of rashness, Mortaigne sprang forward, The dog again barked ; the sound was nearer ; it came from the samedirection; it was almost at hand. A light too twink¬ led in distance: a few at eps further and be traced the mouldering turret in whicli that beacon glittered. A far- e \ tend i г. g i.:ngeof blackened time-worn w„dlssprcul themselves before him, walls encrusted with mantling ivv, walls lonelv and v.'.Id as the desert amid which thev towered. He paused not for contemplation ; he mused not o'er the lapse of ages ; the light in the solitary tower promised shel¬ ter, and springing o'er the scattered frag¬ ments.
i ments, thoughîî^s öf banditti, hailing nought but the tenement of labour, he knocked at the low portal opening at its base. He listened ; a step sounded from within ; a light flashed through the cre¬ vice; he repeated the knock, and instantly a voice demanded, " Amand, is it you ?" " No, not Amand," eagerly replied the count, " but a friend/' No answer was returned, and the next instant a casement was carefully opened, Mortaigne smiled at the caution of the cottager. " Fear not," he exclaimed; " no host assails you ; a benighted tra¬ veller alone craves shelter." The gate was presently unbarred, and a robust form stood at the opening. Mortaigne started. The garb alone was feminine; the height gigantic ; the features un harmo¬ nious; the salutation too betook of cold restraint more than cordial welcome ; yet he followed into the tower, and took his station by the blazing hearth. wl. и, г The
The wpman eyed him with a scowling brow ; she started at each sound, and thrice approached the casement ; thrice she returned dissatisfied, and muttered something like displeasure. In vain Mortaigne essayed the common topics of discourse ; ín vain he spoke of lone, of dreary solitude, dwelt on his wandering, and asked how long she'd been a tenant of these wilds ? Laconic were her an¬ swers—inclination was the cause of ba¬ nishment, life was the span of residence. " Life !" echoed the count ; " can ha¬ bit so surmount the claims of social in¬ tercourse ?" The woman stared. " Do you not pine," he resumed, pi¬ tying at once the imagined source of re¬ serve, " to tread the busy haunts of men —to hear the hum of human voices?'* " If J did/' muttered the ungracious being, " where is the obstacle to with¬ hold me ?" Mortaigne was silent; it was evident nature^
nature, as well as habit, savoured her ir¬ ritability of temper, and in his heart he almost wished he had wooed repose be¬ neath the mountain's brow· Whilst yet he sat irresolute whether to depart, or whether to partake the ill-proffered hos¬ pitality, a voice from an inner chamber called " Mother !" " Fool !" muttered the dame, yet sh« arose to attend the summons. " Strange/' thought the count, gaz¬ ing attentiveîv around. He listened» for he heard the buzz of voices, but the л ords were unconnected, save ever and .tuon, u hen the angry exclamations of ?be dame broke forth in reproach. 4 * You are a simpleton, Gabrielle— pi epare the chamber—your brother's re¬ turn—! tell you, girl, the bed------" Here the voice lowered to a whisper, and ere Mortaigne could give form to his sdcas, a low rap at the outer door pro¬ claimed an arrival. e 2 ή h
*' h ît Amand ?" demanded the count, placing his hand upon the bolt. "Yes, and Barnardin, and Jaques also/* was responded. He hesitateű how to act ; for an in¬ stant suspicion flashed athwart his brain, and the credited league of guilt seemed to threaten destruction. Though armeds nought but caution remained for him : short would be the triumph of valour opposed to numbers; and feeling as though already'in the toil, he was about to withdraw the bolt, when the woman returned. The count turned quickly round. "Whither are you hastening ?" she demanded. ** The same shelter remains, why would you fiy it ?" Mortaigne hesitated, The knock was repeated^ and the dame pointed to the tire. " Amand, is it you ?" she again questioned. An affirmative was returned, and as she opened
opened the door, she held up her hand m token of silence. " Why so wary, old dame ?" but see¬ ing the count, he paused, then lightening his load from his shoulders, " Come, be¬ stir, good mother; Barnardin and Jaques will be here in a twinkling, like myself, sharp set for supper/* " Marry, you are always craving/* muttered the dame : then pointing to the observant Mortaigne, " here is one to share our dainties." '* Aye and welcome," rejoined Amand; " prepare you the feast, and hunger be the savour." In a few moments Barnardin and Jaques swelled the circle, and the tacitur¬ nity of the dame was quickly exchanged for loud loquacious revelry ; jest follow¬ ed jest, and laughter echoed laughter. The doubts of the count subsided ; he traced nought but harmless mirth, he heard nought but guileless simplicity. e 3 Amand
Amand was a lover ; and Barnardin and Jaques shot the random arrows of native wit. The sloe-black eves, the rosy cheeks. the pouting lips of the damsel were de¬ scribed ; Arnaud % s visits to ,e neigh¬ bouring hamlet ; Amand's fever of hope, and Amand s ague of disappointment, " Happy, happy rustics ! ' thought ]Møvtaigne, ,( thy minds tranquil, thy hearts innocent; the intercourse of the world poisons not thy quiet,the restraints of custom war not against thy peace." " Boys/* said the dame, " know yon that to-morrow's sun must see 'von on ni the road to Barcelonette ? Coinè, be¬ take you to your pillows ; exercise is the best doctor, s!eep*the best nurse." 41 Have you a pillow for our guest ?'* asked Jaques. " Aye, and a welcome too, 4 ' exclaim¬ ed Barnardin ; " a rough exterior ofl covers a soft heart ;*' and then he smiled ¡L-gnificmtly at the dame ; " but where is bttie Gabrielle ?" The
The woman frowned, and the nam« was no more repeated. "Yours is a lonely, cheerless dwell¬ ing/' observed Mortaigne, as he found himself alone with Amand. " Lonely, but not cheerless," was the reply ; " we toil hard, but we reap a sure harvest." " For what do you toil?*' asked the count. " For a livelihood," replied Amand ; " we glean in the wilderness—we sell in the city/ 1 " Then 'tis to seek a market for your produce that you journey to Barcelo* nette?" " Surely," replied Amand, " and we return hither laden with supplies of com¬ fort. No, no, master, we are not cheer¬ less/' " Query," thought Mortaigne, " whi¬ ther vou are not happier than those who Jive upon the toils of others: the real e 4 wants
wants of human nature are lew, her su¬ perfluous cravings numerous. Perhaps )ou were born in this dwelling? perhaps you tread in a father's footsteps?" pur¬ sued the count. " The selfsame/' answered Amand. fi Our father lived------ " and then he paus¬ ed, for the dame re-entered. "Come, boy, come, Amand, to bed, to bed," and she stood as though to light Mortaigne io his chamber. The count ascended a narrow staircase; he took the light ; he bid the dame gooď night; he examined the interior of the room ; and as he pushed to the door, as he sought in vain fora fastening, a low voice articulated, " Sleep not/* He start¬ ed; he looked eagerly around; he saw eo form« he heard no footstep ; he at¬ tributed all to the coinage of fancy, and smiling at h'm own weakness, was pre¬ paring for rest, when, " Sleep not/ 1 was repeated, imd a shuddering sigh closed vith, " Your 'bed is the bier of death/* " Who
" Who warns ?" softly asked Mor¬ taigne. " One "iVÌio knows the danger/ 9 was the response: and the next moment it again whispered, "Be resolute, or the sun rises upon your corse/' idortaigne grasped the hilt of his sword. " Caution, net defiance, be i/our trust/' resumed the voice. " Stranger, depart f tarry till midnight, and murder ------" Again a shuddering half sob succeeded, and again it breathed, "ö /г, sleep not f sleep not /" " Fear not," said Mortaigne, t( thus forewarned, sleep cannot steal upon my îsenseSj cannot for a moment efface the dreadful present. Point out the path, and I will fly ; bid me brave the danger, and I will tarry." The count paused ; no answer was re¬ turned ; he listened ; unbroken stillness prevailed ; the tardy flight of moments succeeded, and then a ligbi footstep в 5 seemed
seemed to rest at the verv door of the chamber. Again he grasped his sword, and again he stood in a posture of defi¬ ance. The door opened ; apprehension, doubt, dismay, all vanished, all yielded to amazement, to admiration, for the light \isions of fancy could scarce con¬ jure a face so fair, a form so faul ι less, The count started ; he would have spo¬ ken, had not a ñngvr, white as snow, in indication of silence,· pressed upon the rosy lip of the lovely peasant girl. The short petticoat, the tight- buttoned vest, disphned о cry grace οΐ person ; whilst her golden hair, in wild exuberance о J flowing o'er her polished shoulders, swept almost to the ground. Mortaigne could scarcely breathe ; not the gay scenes of Paris could boast a gem so rare as nature here had planted ; not the bright circles ofa court produce so sweet a flower as blossomed in this wilder- IB ess. 44 Fear not/' she whispered, as swiftly stealing
stealing within the chamber she closed the door. " Fear !" echoed the count, "oh no ! saviour! ansiei í woman!" and snatch· ing her hand, he would have pressed it to his lips, had she not withdrawn it. Instantly the expression of her coun¬ tenance changed ; hope faded from her eyes; firmness, dignity, affliction, spoke in the action ; and whilst the timid blush of apprehension mantled on her cheek x "Stranger," she sai 1, "I would save you— I wouldsavemvself; yet ere I fly the present evil," and her glance bespoke doubts öf the future, " remember the heart of Gabrielle craves some surety for safety." Mortaigne bent his knee before her— " Name that surety," he implored, " and by the sacred bond of true honour, Jife shall not be half so precious Í" " Swear," said Gabrielle, drawing an ebon cross from her bosom, " swear on this emblem of my faith never to sift my actions^ never to question my motives/* к 6 "I do/ 1
*' Ido," solemnly rejoined Mortaigne. " Swear also," pursued the mysterious peasant, " in safety to conduct me to some religious sanctuary, where adversity can no more pursue, where affliction can no more oppress me/* " All, all, I swear/* pronounced Mor¬ taigne, "and may Heaven punish the de¬ falcation !" Gabrielle's eyes again emitted the ra¬ diant fire of fresh dawning hope—again a cherub smile played upon her lip- again a vivid bloom mantled on her cheek. She too bent her knee in si<j;ht of Mor- taígne ; but hers was the pious obeisance, the meek supplication for mercy and succour—hers was a petition to the Throne of grace, not for the favour of man, but for the favour of Omnipotence. She arose all soul, all energy, dignity tempered with softness, confidence blended with submission. Mortaigne could only gaze ; scarcely çoulá he believe himself awake, scarcely credit
credit the evidence of his senses ; never, even in a dream, had fancy pictured a being so resplendent", never imaged a form like Gabrielle's: while she, uncon- sciousof the admiration she excited* alive only to the project which nlleå every impulse of her nature, mused in silence. Suddenly starting, "Time presses !" she exclaimed, " Tarry here whilst I seek the key of the low portal." " Where—how can you obtain it ?*' asked the count. " Heed not," whispered Gabrielle; " stratagem be mv reliance," The maid fled the chamber, and Mor*· taigne numbered the leadened moments of delay. Again she came, her hand grasped the key, success-triumphed in her features. Doubtful he beheld her; she smiled through her disguise ; she whis- - peredsafety; then taking thelongermined mantle which enveloped her agile form, she threw it across her shoulders ; and the deep thick veil, shrouding her treèses* soon
soon flowed around her head. She beck¬ oned through the passage, and down the stairs. Mortaigne hesitated not to fol¬ low, nor when the door was opened, did the darkness of night deier him. He grasped the hand of Gabrielle, he darted forward ; the gate was reclosed, and the silence unbroken. No ray cheered their path, no star twinkled in heaven's vast concave; the wind moaned sullenly midst the ruins, the trees bent to the pressure. They descended the path ; they hastened through the hanging-wood. Gabrielle possessed a hero's courûge ; no feminine fears, no start of weakness augured inde¬ cision : she yielded to the wish of Mor¬ taigne ; she re-assumed the veil and man¬ tle; and as she enveloped herself within its dark folds, she felt as though she dared each threatened danger. Mortaigne sup¬ ported her step&as fearless they advanced, yet he knew not whether to mount the rocky steep, or whether to retrace thş valley; distance had closed upon thq dreaded
dreaded tower, and two hours toil had in part relaxed the terrors of pursuit. The grev eve of morning, piercing midst rocks and cliffs, disclosed a wild and barren track—a track imcheckered by hu¬ man habitation—a track overhung by scowling c b fis, now blackened with pine, now thinly mantled with sunseorehed heath. Not the courage, but the strength of Gabrielle faltered ; the lily chased the rose from her cheeks, and her e}es, dim and ray less, were bent in languor to the earth. Mortaigne watched her with more than friendly solicitude—watched each momentary flush of spirit contending for the mastery of weakness. Gabrielle was a heroine, but Gabrielle was hinnan na¬ ture; and at length, yielding toThe.plead¬ ing voice of her companion, she paused, while he explored a friendly excavation in the rock. " Fear not," he exclaim- eú ? as he returned artel led heu.forWard; " this
"this solitude affords a resting-place* within this cavern innocence and fatigue may woo а repose which monarchs well might envy/* Gabrielle smiled, but it was the smile of confidence ; she felt secure in the guardian she had chosen ; and shielding her head with the dark folds of her veil, and closely enveloping herself in the er- mined mantle,she stretched her wearied limbs upon the hard cold surface of the cavern, and with no softer pillow than a stone, soon lost sight of every external object. Not so the count de Mortaigne : his mind was the prey of perplexing fanta¬ sies; a thousand novel sensations crowd» ed to his heart ; a thousand fears, a thou¬ sand hopes, alternately fluttered in his bosom. He thought of the disappear¬ ance of his friend, of his own delivery from the toil of banditti : his eyes sought the angel form of his deliverer; and as the broad glare of day, gradually ex¬ panding.
paáding, pierced the interior of the ca¬ vern, they rested on features as beauteous as Venus e'er received at the burnished pencil ofa young and glowing artist. Her hand, white as ivory, supported her downy cheek: the veil had fallen aside, and her golden ringlets, negli¬ gently flowing upon her bosom, seemed parted by the lingers of Love himself. Mortaigne moved not, breathed not; he gazed on the lovely vision ; he trem¬ bled lest it should dissolve into air. The bleak and desolate cavern became trans¬ formed, and his every pulsation throbbed with new hopes, with new feelings : gra¬ titude was the foundation-stone of pre¬ possession ; beauty the roseate fetter of fascination. Gabrielle sighed, and Mor¬ taigne started as though he had trodden on an asp ; ^ nameless, an almost inde¬ scribable dread crept through his heart, saddened his spirits; it was a jealous dread, a dread which would have purcha¬ sed
sed with a diadem the solution t>f that sigh. Her sojournment at the tower, her apparent affinity to the dame, her myste¬ rious injunction, her doubts, her seru* ples, alternately succeeded, alternately awakened wonder, not to say suspicion : yet when he beheld her calmly sleeping, when he traced the stamp of virtue upon her features, he execrated the rising doubt—he would have staked existence upon her innocence. Anxious for her safety and her com¬ fort, pining to obtain the shelter of a hu¬ man dwelling, with noiseless step he stole from the cavern, he ascended the rock at whose base it scowled. Rich and reful¬ gent was the scene; every blade of grass glittered with the dew of morning, every clustering blossom seemed to exhale a new perfume. In every direction did his ex¬ cursive eye wander o'er the prospect, not with the glowing homage of admira¬ tion, but with an aching scrutiny, with a solicitude
Söïïcitude which would have exchanged nature's finest imagery for the shelter of a mud-built hovel. Turning from the alternate sketches of barrenness and profusion, from flinty rocksand wild exuberance, he proceeded higher up the ascent, nor again rested until he attained the summit : then were his toils repaid ; for then, on a softly swelling eminence in the vale beneath, did he descry a rough-hewn cross, point¬ ing out the solitary home of Heaven's devoted servant. With the elasticity of thought he reached the valley, Gabrielle in his heart, entreaty on his lip: he hounded o'er the flower-bespangled sod ; he pushed through the little wicket open¬ ing to the garden, nor paused until his eyes encountered the meagre form of the devotee. Then respect and reve¬ rence checked articulation, for then the man of God was bending at the altar of his devotion, his shorn crown uncovered, and
and his withered hands clasped in meek supplication. " Thrice welcome, my son !" exclaim¬ ed the hermit, as he listened to the reci¬ tal of the count; "my cell can boast no lure to tempt the brigands of the mountains: tarry then in peace, secure alike ofa refuge and a resting-place." Mortaigne would have expressed his thanks, but the hermit interposed. " While you linger," he continued, " 'tis probable your companion awakens, and trembles with the dread of desertion/* Mortaigne sprung forward: it was in¬ deed probable Gabrielle might now be weeping-— Gabrielle might now be accu¬ sing him of ingratitude. A pang before unknown shot through his heart, an ap¬ prehension, an interest, which defied a moment's delay. He heeded not the voice of the hermit, he dreamt not the possibility of an easier, ofa shorter track ; he ßew across the vale, he bounded up the
the roet ; and when breathless he reach¬ ed the base, with amazement he beheld the hermit stationed at the entrance of îne cavern. tc How often," observed the religieus:, faintly smiling, Kt does impetuous youth retard the aim it covets!—how often—" But Mortaigne heard not, attended not ; he rushed into the cavern, he stop¬ ped in joy, in gratitude, for he beheld Gabrielle, as he had left her, calmly sleep¬ ing on her flinty bed. The sun had pierced the interior, and sparkled like gems upon the crystalized roof; brilliant was the blaze of splen¬ dor, yet short was the tribute of admira¬ tion, transient the glow which heightened on his cheek. He started at the hurried exclamation of the hermit ; he turned, he beheld him agitated, almost convulsed, his hands clasped, his eyes fixed on the unconscious Gabrielle, whilst grief, hor¬ ror, amazement, alternately flushed, ak iernately faded his sunken cheek. fi God of
of omnipotence У' he apostrophized, t( can the grave give back its victim ?— can the lapse of years be recalled ?— can man, can nature———" He paused, he gasped for breath ; he struck his hand against his forehead : his staff fell to the earth: the sound awoke the sleeper; Gabrielle arose—the hermit darted for¬ wards—Ue snatched away the veil—he gazed wildly, madly on her features— " The same image !" he exclaimed, " en¬ veloped too by the same dark shroud« Saints and angels ! how are the struggles for self subjection defeated !—how, by one glance, is patience, is resignation o^^erthrown ! Tell me," he continued* still gazing on the astonished girl, " } our name—your family ? Tell me whence you came, and whithei you are going ?— Ah ! and above all/' shuddering, almost sobbing, " tell me where and how you obtained this well-known mantle ? Dear, UUfnted Antoinette!" he continued, pressing the hem to his lips, to his he^ri, " ne-:
* 4 not an eternity of time can efface tha moment, when this veil¿ when this man¬ tle hid thy blushing beauty from my eyes —when at the altar's foot------" He paused in seeming recollection ; he bent his knee before Gabrielle ; he fixed his eyes upon her expressive features— " Daughter/' he implored, " if your heart e'er felt compassion, e*er mourned another^ woe, unfold the mystery !" " 'Tis I who should kneel," said Gabri¬ elle, as she threw herself by his side— " Father, 'tis I who should supplicate your prayers and your blessing." The hermit listened in mute, in wild amazement ; his heart beat high, his looks belied the boast of exterminated feeling. *' Come you from the grave ?" he at length articulated. "' Angel î Antoi¬ nette î sweet object of my heart's un¬ ceasing homage! wife! mistress! friend!" He sobbed aloud ; he buried his face in his hands; whilst Gabrielle, actuated by the
the impulsive thrill of sympathy, wept with him. г Mortaigne, wrapt în the trance of won¬ der, gá^ed alternately on the faultless fea¬ tures öf Gabrielle, on the almost-palsied form of the hermit; a thousand shapeless fancies fluttered in his brain ; fears, anti* cipations, su eeded each other; nor for a moment could he attribute to chance the Workings of such ungovernable emo* tion-— nay,tfhen composure was restored, when, preceded by the hermit, Gabrielle, supported byhis arm, quitted the cavern, in each pause for rest, he anticipated some new wonder, he gazed in expecta¬ tion of some unguessed-at discovery.

His answer* were vague, at best disjointed; he appeared to struggle with the rising; emotions of his heart, to baffle with thoughts which warred against his quiet» Olt did the tear tremble in his eye-—oft 4ţm t
did the sigh swell his bosom—oft did he start almost in madness, as he listened to her soft accents, as he gazed on the va¬ rying expression of her countenance : 'and when she threw aside her mantle, when, unveiled, her fairy form met his view, he fled bom the chamber—he shut himself within the chapel, as though, in solitude and self-communion, he would allay the turbulence of his secret feelings. "Strange," said Mortaigne, "that the same being should produce effects so dif¬ ferent ! That smile, which to me would be a sovereign balm to woe, racks, almost frenzies, the mind of our host." Gabrielle blushed. " Perhaps/' pursued the count, gazing intently on her features, " some imagin¬ ed similarity arouses the sting of memory ; perhaps a look, a word, may have recall¬ ed the trials of his youth, may------" " The veil—the mantle !" interrupted Gabrielle : she hesitated, in seeming W thought,
thought, then shuddering concluded, " Holy Heaven ! who can resolve the fate of hs unhappy owner ?" "You knew her then ?" said Mortaigne, " No, never/ 1 replied Gab ; elle. "How then/' demanded die count, " can you deem her unfortunate ?" Gabrielle replied not for a moment, then timidly observed, " Suspicion some¬ times fills up doubt, sometimes forestalls reality," " Is it only suspicion?" asked Mor¬ taigne, and again the deep scrutiny of his eye painted her cheek with'glowing crimson. " Her very name is a stranger to me," said Gabrielle, evadin-g the question of the count, " yet methinks the situation —the—the------" She trembled, sac he-* sita ted. True," said Mortaigne, entering at once into her feelings, (i a veil, a mantle, discovered midst the haunts of merciless f } banditti,
banditti, proclaims too sure the destiny of the owner/' Gabrielle shuddered ; her heart sick¬ ened; the roses of her cheeks faded, a> images of past horror swam before her еусз, " Yet surely," resumed the count» "* the hands of demons could not deface a form so gentle, could not doom inno* cence like thine------" He paused, for the start of Gabrielle was almost palsied ; she rose, she tottered to the door r she gasped for breath. Mor¬ taigne sprung towards her; his arm en¬ circled her waist, while her head, power¬ less and faint, drooped upon his shoul¬ der. " What have I said !" he exclaim¬ ed, as be gazed upon the sickly hue of her complexion, as he mark^ the deep struggles of her bosom. " Forgive me* sweetest Gabrielle, my error is in igno¬ rance." ** Gabrielle forced a smile—"It was memory
memory—only memory," she faltered, • f The past should be forgotten; 'tis İ alone who should sue for pardon/* "The past!" repeated the count; "why should the past be forgotten ì surely the past- -----" " Respect your vow," solemnly inter¬ rupted Gabrielle ; and then taking the ebon cross from her bosom, and holding it towards him, "be the sworn bond re¬ called," she continued. " Last night, in the den of murder—last night, when danger threatened, when darkness enve¬ loped the earth, you promised never to sift my actions — never to question my mo~ tives. u u True/' said Mortaigne, sighing hea¬ vily ; "but interest, fiendship——" " Neither, neither/* eagerly inter¬ rupted Gabrielle, " must infringe our bond. I admit myself the child of mys¬ tery—born, reared under peculiar cir¬ cumstances ; I admit much is left to guess at—my actions, my very thoughts: but f 4 my
ray heart," and piously she raised her eyes to heaven, " will bear searching ; yes, without fear, without danger, dare it brave the strictest scrutiny, dare it be un¬ folded to the world." Mortaigne longed to question further, bţît he felt he could not ; to doubt was almost profanation, yet without doubt, where does love exist ? and Mortaigne, in a few short hours, had passed the gra*- dations from admiration to interest, from interest to fascination. Never had he pictured a being so peerless as Gabrielle; never, in ţh# wildest sports of fancy, had he anticipated a pre possessio 1 η so despo¬ tic. The flight of D'Avignon was Îor~ §фШпт—'Пау„ pride, duty, were subdued, were overthrown— Gabrielle, unprotect¬ ed^ ^efeupekßs — Gabrielle^ his saviour, bis rescuer, now hij timid, tender compa¬ nion-, рееш pied every thought, coloured ev#py anticipa tien. The auf Wore away, anc} the parting Ще olbbe ЦЩ giWe4 the west, when fa¬ ther
ther Augustin and his guests quitted the hermitage, when they crossed the valley, and pursued the lone path leading to the forest. A more than usual sadness cloud¬ ed the features of the hermit ; his head was bent towards the earth, and every va¬ rv ing change of hts sunken features gave indication of a war within. Once he grasped the arm of Gabrielle; once he clung e\en to her for support: a wild expression flashed from his eye, an hys¬ teric sob died upon his lip. He pointed to the last tint of the setting sun, to the golden iay which burnished the heavens, " Such is life," he exclaimed ; " calm, serene, cheating, till the storm auses — till nature becomes wrecked in its own security. Poor girl ! poor fluttering in¬ sect ! poor shadow of a day ! rely on Hea¬ ven and be safe—rely on the promises of bliss,and the mine is sprung beneath your feet. All-seeing God ! thou who readest the agony of my heart, teach me, instruct me how to warn this girl of her danger!" v 5 Gabrielle's
Gabrielle's hand trembled in his—«- fearfully she gazed upon him— timidly she repeated, " Danger !" f4 Yes, danger the mo-st fatal/' resum¬ ed father Augustin ; " danger which wa% lavs, which destroys, which nips every hope, which blasts every reliance." ** What danger?" implored Gabrielle: " unschooled, untutored, how can I avoid the snare ? " 4 ' Confidence/' said the hermit, in a voice of solemn, of impressive fervor. Mortaigne started—he felt it like a dagger's peint at his heart. t( Be wary, be diligent/' pursued the recluse; "trust not to appearances, rely not on proférions; shrink from the seeming friend, and sift each cause for action/* " Is not dhtrust an insult to true ho¬ nour ?" asked Mortaigne. "Father, does not suspicion reflect back upon the breast which gives it harbour?'* w 'Tis the best shield for innocence/* replied
replied the hermit : " armed in self-pro¬ bity, the mind of worth defies suspicion ; but lie who wears the blackening hue of perfidy, in suspicion finds his projects foiled. Oh ! had I but felt suspicion— had 1 but have guessed the fiend, the ser¬ vent coiling round my heart------but he sleeps·—he-—he ------1 have prayed—I do prav for his soul," with struggling dignity, " and mav Heaven exnun¡re the record !" The pause was solemn : the hermit leant uocn his staff; he hid his face on his arm ; but his deep sobs broke the stiline -s. No sound was stirring ; scarce a breeze waved the o'erhanging foliage; the distant outline of mountain scenery, wrapped in eve's dark vapours, each mo¬ ment became less distinct, for the varie¬ gated tints of gold and purple had nearly- died away, had nearly faded into one long' line of dusky irrey. Nature seemed re- posing, all save the melancholy owl, hoot¬ ing " sounds discordant." " The nestling essays its power before F G it
it sallies from the parent wing/' at length obsen ed father Augustin, raisi nor his head, and gazing intently on Gabrielle : ,ť Ob ! distrust your own strength ; be as the dove, innocent, as the serpent, wary." Ile ¡ed forward—-he pierced the verge of the forent— -he pursued the well beaten¬ ed track, nor rested till he reached a mo¬ numental tablet, closely shadowed by s u r r o u ь din g c v p i*ess . Gabrielle shuddered ; a cold damp chill crept o'er her; she wrapped the mantle closely o'er her bosom. Again the hermit grasped her arm, and hurrying her ίο its base, "Kneel, knee!/' he excuimed, is for though she sleeps not here, s'iil at this spot do í imoke her — Antoinette ! saint ! angel !" He pla* ceci his spread hand upon the head of Gabrielle. " Swear to reveal all vou know/' he continued. " Sift well your heart, and tell me how gained you this veil-—this mantle ?—Nay, il" you have mercy, pause not ; for&he who once hid herself
herself beneath its folds, was dearer to my peace than air is to existence/' Gabrielle hesitated—her lip trembled —her features wem convulsed ; agoni¬ zing were the sensations of her heart, complex the ru^h of feeling. " Speak, speak Î" implored the hermit; " despair and madness is in this silence, Knew you the being whom, next to Hea¬ ven, was all my soul e*er dwelt on ?" " No," said Gabrielle, mournfully; '* J will speak—I will allay the pang of dire suspense. Never, but from your lips, did I hear the name of Antoinette." " ¡kit the mantle?" importuned fa¬ ther Augustin. ŕ< If memory e'er survi- \cd the lapbC of y ears, this manile was my gift—this veil was embroidered by the hand of Antoinette. See you the rose ? J tis Lo\e's own emblem, for the thorn lurks beneath the blossom/' Gabrielle sighed, and then a momenta¬ ry blush varied the pallid hue of her cheek,
cheek, for she encountered the eyes of Mortaigne steadfastly fixed upon her. " Tell me/' pursued the recluse, "how came these relicks of my Antoinette in your possession ?" " To chance, and chance alone, be ¡t ascribed," replied Gabrielle. " Explain that chance/' eagerly re¬ joined father Augustin. " If the rived heart e'er claimed compassion, leave not a doubt fo torture/* " To sav*e the life of slumbering reli¬ ance, I sought," said the shuddering girl, "with more than natal courage, I drew this veil, this mantle, from a chest, which contained the spoils—of—of------ ■" " Banditti!" concluded Mortaigne, springing to her side,and pressing her pas¬ sive hand to his lips. " Father, this an¬ gel, in a human form, preserved my life: caged in the assassin's den, she snatched me from the stroke of murder/' The hermit crossed his bosom—he breathed
breathed a fearful groan. (< Antoinette —murdered Antoinette!" he articulated; then suddenly starting, " Mysterious girl/' he continued, *' how, and by what strange sport of chance, could you attain an entrance there?—How—how, in inno¬ cence, herd with a band who war a 0 ainst h u man it ν ?" Mortaigne listened—Mortaigne could sea reel ν breathe. " That is my secret/* faltered Gabri¬ elle ; iť that concerns not Antoinette/' i( Secrets are smres to the soul," so- lemnlv observed the hermit; "innocence should be open as dav — oh, abjure them! 'tisgnilt alone which flics to subterfuge? ,J " Guilt !" repeated Gabrielle, and her eves flashed the fire of outraged virtue. " Father, if you could read my heart- but it avails nought—Heaven pierceth its inward folds ; Heaven know« its mo¬ tives, and its trials/' She bowed her head in meek submis¬ sion ;
sion ; she rose not, till the hermit softly whispered, (( Pardon and peace to all !" The moon had ar' , from above the distant mountains as they emerged from the forest, and now u Peering in silv'ry panoply of %ht ? And scatťríng round her imitative &лу," did she spread her softening veil o'er na¬ ture's emerald features. Eve hung her liquid gems upon each blossom, and each pendant spray varied the fantastic sha¬ dows. Gabrielle clung to the arm of Mor¬ taigne, for oñen did she start, often did she shudder, as the rising breeze swept o'er the long grass. For the first time did the dread of pursuit assail her, did an unknown horror depress her spirits: in every copse she pictured an ambushed foe, in every waving shrub some herald of approaching danger. Grateful îoï the shelter of the little hermitage, she partook
partook of the frugal repast, and yielding to the solicitations of father Augustin, at length Wooed the promised repose of his humble mat t rass. The ebon wand of night had tranced the world in forge t ful n ess, yet did the hermit and his young guest delay the parting benison, yet did they converse upon the joys and ills of life. Father Augustin had quaffed the bitter cup of affliction even to the dregs—he then couid expound the true estimate of sub¬ lunary reliance—he could expatiate upon the deceptive shadow of sublunary bliss —he could patiently listen to the enthu¬ siasm of youthful fancy, and check the exuberant flights of a too-sanguine ex¬ pectation. Mortaigne attended, but Mortaigne was unconvinced : the misfortunes, the calamities of one life, threatened not the lives of all : he attributed the arguments of his host to the jaundice of misanthro¬ py; he basked in the cherished possibi¬ lity 4
lity that man may enjoy the sunshine and escape the shower. In the experience of his own short life he had realized the dream, for never had his heart formed a wish which the hoar frost of disappoint¬ ment had blighted. He had breathed the light zephyr of prosperity—he had known scarce one deviation from enjoyment. Impatient for the security and comfort of his fair companion, as soon as the blue mists on the mountains bespoke the return of day, directed by father Augus¬ tin, the count, quitting the hermitage, set forward for the nearest hamlet. He pined to conduct Gabrielle beyond the possibility of danger—to place her in' some shelter, where no eye, save his own, could gaze on the lovely flower he had transplanted. Love, fearful of innova¬ tion, forbade his taking her to the cha¬ teau; he knew his· mother, his sister, would kindly hail the stranger^ but he trembled for the caprices of his father. Gabrielle had beauty sufficient to awa* ken
îcen suspicion, and his feelings already shrunk from the scrutiny. Besides, he had bound himself, by a sacred promise, to convey her to some religious sanctua¬ ry ; and all that his most sanguine hopes dare picture was, that that sanctuary might be within the reach of his oc¬ casional visits. Thus buoyant, conjuring visions which Fancy herself could scarcely shape, he bounded o'er the unfrequent¬ ed pastures, in the sole pursuit of ob¬ taining mules, and a guide for the safe conveyance of his still-slumbering charge. In the mean time, Gabrielle had arisen with the sun, had poured forth the offer¬ ings of thanksgiving to the Throne of Grace ; for she had snatched, on the hard couch of privation, a slumber more salutary than the cygnet down of kings oft yields. She had bowed to the bene· diction of the hermit ; but though her lips spoke not, her eyes, in every direction, sought the partner of her flight. Even the agitated gaze of father Augustin fix¬ ed not her attention ; it was wavering, it was
was disturbed; and when she passed through the flower-bedecked garden of the hermitage, when she pursued the path of their last night's ramble, and pierced the shadowy gloom of the pine- forest, it was with the local, the scarce- acknowledged wish, to resolve the seem¬ ing doubt of absence. Brushing the ori¬ ent dew from the half-opening blossoms, Gabrielle, with the elastic spring of a hamadryade, pursued her path, nor rested till she reached the lone spot marked for the solitary musings of the religieux'. Then even Mortaigne vanished from me¬ mory, and every thought, save sympathe¬ tic sadness; for then, by the broad glare ofday, did she more distinctly discern the monumental tablet, did she peruse the name of Antoinette engraven on its base. She knew not the fate of Antoinette, yet did tears steal from her eyes, as she mark* ed the careful caution which had despoil¬ ed the growth of every weed, which had planted in their stead the evergreen lau¬ rel, rosemary, and rue. "Pourmourner!" she
sbe articulated ; " poor helpless victim of unceasing woe!" and bending her Icnee, she rested her clasped hands upon the marble. "Lamented Antoinette/* she continued, " though in distance thou art doomed to moulder, thy sainted spirit, hovering o'er this tomb, perchance may note the grief-fraught sigh—may mark the anguished tear of heart stricken sufferance —* may smile acceptance— m ay ------** She paused, she started; for the frenzied gaze of the hermit was fix¬ ed upon her. He had stolen unheeded to her side ; h? had sunk on his knees by the marble; he had—he still grasped her hand, with a cold, a pabiecl pressure. " M\sterious I!ea\en !" he ejaculated, "can Antoi¬ nette kneel at the torn!) of Antoinette ?■— can years be expunged ?—can death y ield back the sweets he has ravaged ?—can-—" He shuddered, he pressed his hand upon his forehead. " God of nature," he as¬ pirated, " snatch from my view a pic¬ ture
ture so beguiling, expound the fancied delusion, lure not my thoughts from thee ! Cruel, mysterious girl !" he conti¬ nued, still retaining her hand ? still gaz¬ ing intently on her, " rich in a sem¬ blance which rives my heart, why must concealment cloud your destinv ?—why must your birth, your parentage, be im- rev caled ?—why must I know you but the captive of a ruffian crew ?'' Gabrielle caught the affection of al¬ most-fainting agitation ; her features be¬ came colourless as the marble against which she à ested, her frame almost con¬ vulsed. " Tell me/' emphatically urged the hermit, "who are you? The secret shall rest in my breast—-the secret sh^li descend with me to my grave." The pause was solemn — Gabrielle laised her clapped hands to heaven. "The duld of misfortune/* she at length fal¬ tered, " of—of------'' her voice sunk to ζ whisper, she buried her face in her bo¬ som«
ынл, as almost inarticulately she con¬ cluded " shame !" " Droop not, my daughter," said fa¬ ther Augustin, as he marked her inward struggles; " shame may tinge the cheek ef innocence, but guilt descends not from the parent—oh no ! armed with the impervious shield of rectitude, shame may imbitter, but guilt cannot corrode." " Yes, father, I am innocent," sobbed Gabrielle, timidly raiding her eyes to his face ; " Heaven can bear me witness, no secret crime preys on my quiet, no dread of reprehension chains my tongue.— Pione to imperfection, a thousand errors may be filed against me, but not one blot of vice blackens the catalogue. I might—I did pine for the charm of so- с iety— í did paint the world in all the exaggerated tints of fane v ; but it was not presumption which lured me within its labyrinths/* ** How then did you imprudently quit the sheiter of \our in'ancv r ,r demanded the
the devotee; "how, without a guide, brave the snares and dangers of a sin- fraught world ?'' (( I had a guide," said Gabrielle : " hy¬ pocrisy, scowling under the mask of duty, beguiled my inexperience, and forced me to crave protection even from a stranger's arm." "'fwas you who saved his life," ob¬ served the hermit, earnestly regarding her; " 'twas you who warded off------*" He hesitated, for the shudder of Gabrielle was terri f j ing; а cold damp bedewed her fore¬ head—a frenzied horrorglared in hereves. " Spare me, spare me," she imp! ír¬ ed, her pale « Ьеск resting on the таг - bie ; <w î would tell you all, but tîıe bare remembrance harrows m ν brain. Holy Virgin ! can time e'er familiari/*-» the contemplation ?—can it e'er mellow io composure the fearful pas' ?" 4 Yes, it C3ÌI do more/' rejoined fa¬ ther Augustin ; " time and resignation can •blunt ihe I ren^t pangs, can subvert e\eu
even the maddened paroxysms of despair. You are young, you are entering on the !:fe lam quitting; be patience the rock of vour strength, be religion vour uass- nort to felicity. All else is deceptive, ^ain; all else the mere ignis fatuus which bewilders to destroy. Bliss, hope, joy, what are ye ? futile as the phantom ofa dream, which mocks the trance of slum¬ ber, and is seen no more. But though the veil of oblivion be drawn o'er the past/' putsued the man ofGod, " the like nat exists not towards the future. Tell me then, my daughter, whither bend ye \ our footsteps, and when bid ye adieu o vour \outhful guide?" G|bnelj3 ich a cold chill pervade her >,οητ —a chili which bespoke approach- ,.g separation painful, " My goal is the belter of some religious community/' •-he replied, i4 some retirement in which he past storms may be lulled to peace, ί which hie may glide unmarked by any • ■ '· с: < e And
"And at the gate of a community/* asked the hermit, attentively marking her features, "you bid adieu to your guide for ever?" Gabrielle hesitated ; the paleness of death was succeeded by the flush of crim¬ son, asfalteringly she pronounced, "Yes, father, the gate of such a community clo¬ ses me from the world and the world's members." "And will your thoughts detach them- selves from every pleading incitement ?" demanded the religieux; "will they cheerfully conform to the worship of (hod, nor sicken at the sameness of devo¬ tion ?—Will they ne'er wander beyond the limitation of duty ?—Will they ne'er conjure an image dangerous to peace?" Gabrielle trembled ; her heart beat hiiih—her eves sought the ground ; she buried her burning face in her bosom, as inwardly she whispered, tr I will endea¬ vour to curb them-—! will pray for strength," "May
" May your prayers be heard !" re¬ joined the hermit ; " may your strength exceed your trials I—may the unclouded calm of innocence be your portion î and if debarred the joys of life, mav you es- cape the snares !" The sun had attained its meridian height, ere Mortaigne entered the garden of the hermitage, ere he stole upon the solitary reflections of Gabrielle, and tra¬ ced with delight the soft suffusion which marked his entrance. Gabrielle extend¬ ed her hand, but it was with timidity : Mortaigne could not question, for bis own caught the tremulous affection ; he ioulu only announce the success of 1/s evpcdition, and then urge an i hi media f e departure. " i would henry you into Provence," he exclaimed; "1 would place you beyond the reach of danger— nay, even of alarm ; but I would place %ou, my sweet preserver, within the reach of my own grateful homage : í would steal occasional! v to the shrine of my
life's guardian, and convince her that the obligation never can be expunged !" Gabrielle smiled ; it was the smile of rapture, for her heart acquiesced in the arrangement. The convent of S Hone k ее was the destined bourne ; and enriched with th'* blessing of their benevolent host, they bid adieu fo his humble dwelling, and journeyed with their guide o'er tht* mountains.

Wt -гкч wore away ? and the dull routine of devotional exercise was unbroken ; Co¬ ri 1 · a n de hailed no cessation from captivi¬ ty, for the decision of the marquis was immutable. The letters of the marchioness teemed with aíľertion, but they teemed also with despondency and woe : she spoke of the return of the count de Mortaigne ; but e\en the presence ofa darling son com¬ pensated not for the loss of a darling daughter« She mourned her companion, с 3 her
her familiar friend ; yet not once did sue seek to recai that companion, that friend, by the sacrifice of her tranquillity ; no, she did not once recommend a blind ac¬ quiescence to authority ; she rather hint¬ ed the necessitv for firmness, and dwelt on a compulsarory union as the grave of peace. She petitioned the kind offices of the sister Mathilde, enumerated tîıe years she herself had passed at St. Hono¬ iee, and closed her epistle by piously en¬ joining resignation, and supplicating Heaven for mercy and pity. " Poor Hortense !" sighed sister Ma¬ thilde, as she perused the document of maternal interest, " well may she en¬ join firmness, well may she warn against the trials of her own mortal pilgrimage» * Poor forlorn one î her heart has been the scat of many sorrows: buffet t ed by the storms of the world, she would ex¬ plain the snare, yet would she veil thé desîrover." ' " What snare ? — what destroyer ?** questioned
questioned Corisande. " Oft have I traced tîıe tear of unavailing miserv, vet never have I shared the rich harvest of confidence." "Oh no!" resumed the nun; "cir¬ cumstances barred confidence. It was not fear, it was not distrust; it was that upright principle which dreads to im¬ peach duty ; it was that sensitive refine¬ ment of feeling, which scorns to excite compassion by another's fall/' " You speak İn riddles," said Cori¬ sande ; " explain, risler, for long has my heart bled at the buriea woes of my mo¬ ther?" The nun mused in silence; her head rested upon her hand, her eyes upon the cross impending from her girdle.

bitter sorrow streamed from her eyes, " must I pray for the crimes, nöt for the peace of my father?" Her thoughts were completed; wild and shapeless images floated on imagination ; a thousand, thousand instances of han-b unbending power recurred—a thousand proofs of ungentle, persevering rigour : yet even though the oft-heaved sigh of a mother seemed to echo in her ear, did duty strug¬ gle against the presumptuous arraignment ofa father's actions; even when convk> tion spurned each palliating effort, did nature war against the lapse of filial sub* mission. In vain the light prattle of Micheline essayed to steal corroding care ; Cori¬ sande had scarce a smile for her pleasan* tries, and each succeeding anecdote was heard, but not enjoy* d. Not all the signs and wonders of credulous faith obtained one comment, and Micheline might have ransacked all the mysteries of all the saints in the calendar without obtaining g ô the

" Detraction !" echoed the half-oŕľend- ed Micheline ; ' f I am sure sister Ursule meant no h.irvt, but mystery λίΗ awaken curioMtv, and curiosity will excite at- -*■ « tention." " Be curiosité amenable to good na¬ ture/' said Corisande; " fornever should the fiend-like tongue of slander gain en¬ trance beneath the lowly roof of reli¬ gion," " Ah I but man doffs not his nature at the gate," archly rejoined Michel í ne ; " and when little is said, much will be guessed at. No doubt, their love is now all spiritual, all pure and holv : but may not, as sister Ursule says, the hopes of their vouth have been blasted ?—May not the wishes of their hearts have been thwarted by adverse destiny ?—May they not have been driven for shelter to the selfsame port ? Sister Ursule says, the poor nun has never once smiled during his illness; she says, also, the nights of his
his danger have been passed by her in pra ν er and tears." (i Perhaps so," .said Corisande ; " yet Hea\en, which sifts the heart, knows the motive. " The dav wore awav, and Corisande watched the bilirin" hours with restless impatience; she marked the slow decline of tîıe sun ; she noted the last trembling r.iv, as mounted at her casement, she tra¬ ced its glowing refulgence on the pine- cbu! sumo/it***· of the mountains; she saw ihe mi f" \ n j;í)iir succeed ; she saw it hang like a bb' kening volume o'er creation, now enveloping the highest peaks, now sweepirg o'er the burnished purple of the heavens, P \ e r y í o cal i d e a v a n i s îi c d ; suspense yielded to reflection; and though a tear trembled in her esc, vet caíra und unrufïîed were her feelings. The leaves of her tablet were open ; the pen¬ cil was in her hand ; she smiled at the light elľurions of her own fancy, yet soon were
were those effusions shaped in the lowing lines;— о Weictmie, soft eve ! like pilgrim grej, I see thee chmb the rocky su ev, J bte th) shroud envelop day, Xli)' vapours hlue bestrew tlie way, TJiycrjtoiai dewk like шсенье ueep.

li was nearly dark, yet Corisande lin¬ gered in the cloister; and though the nuns had retired, no sensation of íe¿r 4ole upon her quiet: she remembered the promise of sibter Mathilde, and she tarried in anxious expectation for her ap¬ proach. Cased in the shield of innocence, she shrunk not fiom the shadowy gloom by which she was surrounded; norwhen ahea- v> footfall echoed along the pavement, d id her eves close against the object thev en- countered. It was not sisicr Mathilde ; it was the thin, the annosi spectre features of а monk, which met her &crutinv. She saw the maddened start of fervour; she saw the faded cheek fiush crimson, yet she lied not in dismay ; she saw him, almost Linting, cling to his staff for support; and when she would have called for suc¬ cour, he waved his hand in token of si¬ lence. i( Saints of mercy !" he articulated, fixing hi.-» sunken eves on the pallid fea* tures
tures of the distressed girl, " well, well might tender, might apprehensive friend¬ ship warn me." He bent forward—he grasped her hand—he raised it to his lip^ with reverential awe. Suddenly he drop¬ ped it. " Daughter/* he exclaimed, in accents scarcely audible, " the burning fever of disease still ravages my brain — still tortures—still subdues me—still riots o J er the slender remnant of resolution, and btamps me weaker than lisping infancy." "Poor father Eustache!" murmured Corisande. " Who, save Mathilde, could have breathed the name of Eustache ?" eagerly questioned the monk ; " who—-" *' Every pious member of St. Hono¬ rée/* interrupted Corisande, " has, like sister Mathilde, petitioned Heaven for the ¡restoration of father Eustache." The confessor raised his clasped hands ia thanksgiving ; a swollen tear trickled down his cheek. " You have prayed for a being you never saw," he at length articulated;
articulated ; " you have knelt at the throne of grace for one whose sufferings were his only claim." '* I knelt for the confessor of our or¬ der," said Corisande ; " for one whose active virtues stamp him dear to the heart of every member of this communi* π/' " Alike in mind as in form," faltered father Eustache, and then shuddering, and turning from her, he moved slowly down the cloister. Corisande saw him depart with feelings of saddened interest; she marked the dark outline of his figure as he Л owl v re- ceded, and when again he paused, when he turned, when he cast a lingering look towards her, unconscious of the impulse, she fled towards him. "What crave you, daughter?" he faintly demanded, Corisande blushed; she bent her head upon her bosom, yet she spoke not. " These darkened aisles are dreary/* pursued
pursued the confessor ; t£ they court iw the step of youth : why do you tarn ?— why do you shun the refectory ίυτ a spo; so uncongenial ?'* íf ϊ have no fear/ 1 said Corisande ; i: no ¿ecret crime presses upon memory, no guilty fantasy peoples the midnight hiHir." " Crime !" repeated the monk ; tf oh no î thy image is the image of innocence ' -—thy features------- f * lie hesitated in deep thought, then mournfully added, (( 'Tis fit the heart should be rived— f ti; ilt the reliances of this world should be deceptive, else would man forget his in¬ significance, else would he forget the te¬ nure of his trust. Go, go, my daughter ; your features awaken what i have sworn to abjure; they rise 'twixt me and Hea¬ ven ; they——" lie pressed his hand upon his forehead, then shudderingly concluded, " they open the past page of my destiny. Go., child, go, and \ will kneel for mercy and forgiveness," Corisande
Corisande gazed in wonder; she saw* him almost palsied, his breast heaving, his features convulsed ; she tried to take hi i hand, but he shrunk from the touch. " Go, go," he implored ; " а little time, а little reflection------" He dashed away the tear which fell from his eye ; he turned from her—" Go, leave me, îe r t I forget humanity—lest I curse the au* г hor of my woes." Corisande awaited not a seco η 1 bid¬ ding; though anxious, though rcuwtanr, she quitted the cloister, nor did she pause u a til лЬе gained the cell uf sister Mathilde, 1'ut the nun answered not her call ; i л ni n she repeated the knock for admis¬ sion ; all wab solitary stillness : she gent- 4 raited the latch, she pushed open the door; the little dormitory was deserted, and disappointed, she retraced the gallery. Doubtless some new duty had detained the sister, doubtless the tale of a motheris sufferance must be deferred» Corisande righed, yet she murmured not at the fint > she
she even approached her own little cham¬ ber, content to woo the calm oblivion of repose, when she traced the well-known form of the nun at the extremity οι the corridor. " ϊ tarried for you in the cloister," said Corisande, taking lier of¬ fered hand; -'shall we return thither"
ťt Not to-night/' interrupted the sis* ter; ťť it is late, and the hour for con- % erse is passed. Summoned by tìic mo¬ ther superior, I attended her from the chapei, and now docs nature cra\e the pallet of rest." "Would that father F.usta.he were auke indulgent fo her wants!** said Co¬ risande; "would that he were alike mindful of her weakness !" " Father Eustache is indulgent to the weaknesses of all sa\e himself," mourn¬ fully observed sister Mathilde. *' Lut whence arises that wish, my child ?—* whence springs the interest for father Eus¬ tache s comfort ?"
kl h sprints from the pure impulse of humanity," replied Corisande, " from that Christian principle which encom¬ passes the weiiare of every fc!low~being.

THEA ΠΙ TRY, Ion, on a spot which might challenge UiC boated rivalry of Italv. It was the close of day, and the sun's «lying splendor still painted the purple bosom of the clouds, still criided the hea- vens, still reflected a burnished glow upon creation. The rocks, the woods, the Rhone itself had caught the saffron suffusion ; not a breath was stirring, not a sound broke upon the calm of heaven. The eyes of Mortaigne and his fair companion rested alike on a picturesque dwelling which rose unri\ ailed midst the solitude, on the verdant slope, ruh in the culture of olives, pomegranates, lines, oranges, and prunes, sweeping to the water shrink. tl We will journey no further," said the count, assisting Gabri¬ elle to alight: "for one nicht at least CÌ О we will ta\ the hospitality ofa stranger." Gabrielle acquiesced, for her spirits drooped, and her limbs were weary. Ί he hour of adieu was almost at hand, for e very- league towards St. Honoiee was a heavy draft
draft upon her quiet. Foor Gabrielle ! she hadiistened to the accents of insinua¬ tion until her peace had become the for¬ feit; she had experienced the attentions, tîıe solicitude of Mortaigne, until her heart shrunk at the privation. The door of the cottage dew open at their approach, and the smile of genuine welcome hailed them at the threshold: neatness reigned within, and content sea« boned the lack of luxuries. The mules were turned to pasture, and the evening wore awav in mutual converse, and mu- tuaKonrtesy. The easv polish of refine¬ ment spoke in every action of the hos¬ ten ; and though age had dimmed the lustre of her eye, and Ĺided the roses of her cheek, neither disease or languor had numbed the thrill of native urbanity. Mortaigne listened to every sentiment she uttered, amazed that, almost within the shelter of their domain, a gem so rare should have been hid from the know¬ ledge of his family. She spoke as though a 2 the
the world, and the worlds habib, had once been familiarized; as though incli¬ nation, not fate, had doomed her the in¬ mate of a spot so remote. But even here Gabrielle became the object of eager interest; every tuun of her countenance was watched by the dame ; every accent Aie uttered was listened to with almost familiar attention. " You remind me of one most dear/' she exclaimed, as she conducted her to her chamber: and when Gabrielle echoed i£ good¬ night," she started, and affectionately pressing her hand, declared, with a hea\y sigh, she could almost fancy it the voice of her absent Louis. "Who is Louis?" questioned Gabri¬ elle. The dame forced a smile—" Could ought but a mother speak thus partial ?" she demanded; then again impressing the necessity for repose, she repeated "good· night," and departed. Alortaigne, sanguine in hope, quick İn decision,
decision, beheld in this cottage a retreat for Gabrielle — а secure, а delightful home, hee from the restrictions of con¬ ventual austerity-—a home opened to his approach, glowing in all the charms, rich in all the promises of deceptive love. He forgot the mystcrv by which she was en- veloped ; he fo'got the ambition by which the marquis his father was actuated ; he forgot all but his own wishes, and those wishes pointed to the society of his too- lovely charge. Kat if such were the gay \ irions which fluttered round his pillow, dif- feient, far different, were the rumina¬ tions of Gabrielle; she sighed without knowing why ; she wept in the fulness oí a saddened heart ; she thought not of the слепиш of her hostes* ; she thought not of the peculiarity of her own de- iny ; ..he thought not of the past ; she thought but of the hour of teparation, and trem bled even as she breathed the гклье of M. Jíoeoíéc The ¡глет of Mortaigne 1 > ťte í-íí f/ led
filled every waking fane), obtruded ue- twcen the altar of profession, coloured the life's stream of her worldly hopes. The more she reflected, the more was she con founded, for cverv internal feeling bespoke her heart no longer in her own posscsbion. Grie\ed, humiliated, shock¬ ed, she felt, as it were, alone in the world : ^he felt degraded in her own estimation, unk even beneath the standard of self- acquit tab The unreserved pleasure, the artless delight which had hitherto marked their intemews, faded into sadness; yet though prudence whispered she should ti) his presence, she should never sec him more, not one moment passed İn which die did not pine to see him. Such too often is the inconsistency of our nature ; we woo the poison in des¬ pite of judgment, we court the bane to peace, even though reason war against us. The morning arose, and Gabrielle left her sleepless pillow; she started at tlie imnse İver 2lass reflected, for her cheeks * were
were colourless, ^nd her eye5 red and swollen. " I must w ľ* she exclaimed, resting her hcaw head upon her hand; " I must tarry no longer. The d\e of my fate is fixed ; why» why should î struggle to a\crt it? I mav parfake of peace, if not of bliss—I may be content, if not happy—Yes/' breathing a heavy siigli, " I must remove to St. Honorer." ¡hit the day wore awav, mid Gabrielle was st/t an inmate of the cotînge ; another and another succeeded, and sriii she \ İeld td to the solicitations of her hostess Mortaigne too urged, with :iu.\ious, with unanswerable fervour. The situation was delightful ; every thing combined to charm : Gabrielles objections grew weaker ; they sank, they died away ; Gabrielle forgot all the reso- Uiíions slie had formed ; Gabrielle y ¡eld¬ ed to the guidance of her ov. n heart. Ne¬ ver had the davs been half so í,hort, ne\cr had her mind been half so tranquil : a thousand resources beguiled the hours, a κ -1 thousand

" My heart is attuned to sadness," Said Gabrielle ; " mav I not be intrusted with the story ?" " Yes, you shall hear all," said the dame e " It is the hour for meditation ; the evening declines ; we will first walk to the grave, and then------" She paus¬ ed, for the well-known knock of Mor¬ taigne called the truant blush into the cheeks of Gabrielle. He entered, he poured forth the rap¬ ture of his feelings ; his heart was elated ; his mind was the seat of joy : the marquis was gone for a whole fortnight from the chateau, and love triumphed in the pro¬ mise of liberty. But the sadness of Ga- brielle was as a death-blow to his hopes; a thousand fears assailed him, fears known only to the heart of anxious solicitude. In vain Gabrielle rallied ; in vain she for¬ ced the smile of gaiety ; she was a wretch¬ ed counterfeit, and Mortaigne pictured more than another's woe. Doubt gave birth to distrust, distrust to jealousy; and when
when he .quitted the cottage, he felt in that frame of mind which, clinging to every straw, magnifies suspense into tor¬ ture. Gabrielle, little dreaming the fears her too-apparent dejection had awakened, recurred to the theme of interest; but it was now too late to visit the grave, and besides, the very name of Louis ex¬ cited the tears of the dame : she could only weep when she recalled his absence, and his silence svas, to spirits already de¬ pressed, a sure indication of harm. Gabrielle, though retired to her cham¬ ber, retired not to rest; she toowasbusy in self-torture ; she forgot the dame and her sorrows; she forgot the mysterious grave and the absent Louis ; she thought of Üıc adieu of Mortaigne, and her timid heart pictured coldness, in vain she recalled every action of her own ; in vain she es¬ sayed to resolve the enigma ; her feel¬ ings spurned the tax of caprice, but ca¬ price was the only probable solution ; n G she

Yes, ίο -morrow I will revive the subject of m v departure—-to morrow I will do more than talk of my removal to St. Honorée." Buí even under the prewiie of resent¬ ment and mortified hope, Gabrielle was alive to the bitter panir of misery ; her heart drooped at the bare anticipation ; mui though she would fain believe the cottage, and the cottage comforts, the at¬ traction, Mortaigne lingered in the back¬ ground. She threw open her casement —she inhaled the balmy air : a fairy light tinged every object ; the moon rode un¬ clouded in the heavens ; and though eve¬ ry feature of the landscape was touched Witti

A deep sigh swelîcvl her bosom, a scalding tear trickled down her check The path was lost ш the distant woods, yet did ib lone and cheary solitude supersede even the proud broad wa'en of the Rho-nc. The one was connected with the peculiar co¬ lour of her thoughts, the other claimed but the tribute of admiration. Poor Ga¬ brielle ! soon did the path, soon did the tvce4 t soon did cscry object become con · ccntrated in one, for she traced a tall fi¬ gure crossing the verdant lawn—she raw *****> Ώ him pass through the low wicket opening to the garden. It was the count. She pressed her hand upon her beating heart —she scarcely breathed, for he paused be¬ neath the casement, lie pronounced he* 4 name. " Who calls on Gabrielle?" she demanded. " A wandering, a restless, a perturbed spirit/'
spirit," exclaimed Mortaigne ; f£ one whose feelings banish repose, whose ap¬ prehensions baffle composure/* "What apprehensions?" questioned the trembling girl; " what feelings can war against your quiet?" fci Oh, Gabrielle ! is it you who ask ? M rejoined the count; <ť isit you, replete with mystery, who alone resolve not the meaning of my doubts?" Gabrielle was silent. ťí Descend, I implore you," pursued Mortaigne; " I would relieve my pent* up bosom. Gabrielle, the burthen can no longer bc borne ; the weight on my heart must crush it— Gabrielle, descend ; oiiîv for five moments descend, and let me on mv knees supplicate some portion of your confidence.

" To-mor¬ row I will claim the blessed privilege, and till to-morrow, may rest and all pood angels tend you Í" He waved his hand in adieu, and quitted the garden. But Gabrielle retained her station even when her eyes could no longer discern his figure; fancy pierced the distance, fancy restored him to her view ; hope ag.un fluttered in her bosom; sweet ex¬ pectation
pectation redawned ; the tax of сг.рг'н г. the suspected charge of coldness, was for¬ gotten ; and when she sougnt her pil¬ low, it was with a mind so light, with feelings so buoyant, that she slept to dream of all her heart e'er formed οΐ hap¬ piness.

CHAP. VII. Aud aJ<!r· U> (hi с misfor tuno. Ким · , Tap. st if oly turrets of the chateau de Rous¬ sillou, as I have before observed, tower¬ ed scarce a league from the little dwelling in which Gabrielle had become an in¬ mate. The road was picturesque ; how then could the count de Mortaigne suf¬ let* one single day to decline without thither bending his footsteps ? Perhaps it was gratitude ; perhaps the common courtesy of good breeding ; perhaps·— but why should we pursue that perhaps? Mortaigne wa$ human nature, and Gabri¬ elle was fair as the houri of Mahomet; idic was gentle, artless, captivating ; her mind unsophisticated; pure, untainted by
by the poisonous refinements of the world, she knew not how to guise the quick fiowings of the heart ; she had never practised the lure of coquetry, she had never borrowed the smile of conciliation ; how then could the mantling blush be misconstrued — how the half-breathed sigh of new-awakened passion l· Gabri¬ elle was too artless, Morraigne too quick- sighted to be deceived ; a thousand glow¬ ing testimonies spoke conviction ; and f\en when he revisited the home of hts infancy, when he returned the affection¬ ate embrace of his beloved mother, and listened to the congratulations of his fa* <**> ther, his heart exulted in a thousand tacit proofs of prepossession, rioted in the bliss-fraught certainty of favour. Yet not once did the name of Gabrielle escape his lips ; he knew the disposition of the marquis, and a thousand fears checked the half-rising acknowledge¬ ment. To confide in the marchioness waj a possible means, in any abrupt dis¬ closure,
closure^ of exposing her to the displea¬ sure of the marquis; and Mortaigne was too generous to risk such an occurrence : besides, his mother was drooping be¬ neath the loss of Corisande, and humani¬ ty forbade his imposing a new tax upon her spirits. This banishment of his sister to the cold and joyless solitude ofa cloister, for no other crime than repugnance to a po¬ litical union, evinced an authority so de¬ termined, as shook the very foundation- stone of his own fabric of felicity ; how could he harbour a hope of acquiescence, when his own reason told him the very actions of Gabrielle were mysterious? Madness was in the thought of her so¬ journment within the haunts of banditti; yet when he saw her smile, when he bra¬ ced the Circean spell of her charms, sus¬ picion sank to sleep, intoxicating delu¬ sion rioted over all. Often had he par¬ ried her wish of monastic seclusion—often had he baffled her arguments, and weak¬ ened
ened her resolves. He would be het friend, her brother ; but how restrict his wishes?—how confine his heart within the calm current ofa brother's feelings? Mortaigne had deceived himself: unwill¬ ing ίο fetter inclination, he had yielded ro its dictates, until the image of Gabri¬ elle had mingled with his life's stream— until he owned her a dearer part of him¬ self— until she had become necessary as air to his existence. Plunged in this new labyrinth of diffi¬ culty, his whole mind became absorbed ; he was lost, abstracted, frequently absent¬ ing himself from the social board, and, under the plea of field sports, bartering peace for the indulgence of feeling. But though the marquis suspected not the change, though the marchioness dreamt not the infatuation, the eyes of father St. Pierre were not to be blinded ; he had marked the vacant look, he had heard the half-suppressed sigh, and curiosity, not to bay interest, became busy. Father
Tather vSt. Pierre had long been the spiritual confessor of the marquis de Rous- sillon ; he had known him in the early years of life—he had aided him in more than counsel. Alive to the ambitious speculations of his friend, he had watched the wanderings of the unsuspecting count, he had traced those wanderings to the picturesque retreat of love ; but though he had transiently beheld the beauteous magnet, though he had marked the Hebe graces of her s\lph-like form, though he had seen the glowing tide of genuine mo¬ desty heighten the carmine of nature, not for a moment did he credit ought bave gallantry ; and smiling at the seem- in^ artiiicc of \outh, he confined the se- eret of his disc overy to his own keeping. Such was the state of things when **Mor~ taigne, pining for the assurance of re- quit d love, quitted his restless couch in bcartu of confirmation. 'Tis true, Gabri¬ elle had shrunk from the mere shadow of appointment; but Mortaigne could not sleep ;
sleep ; his pillow was strewed with thorns ; and to watch even beneath her casement promised some cessation from inquie¬ tude. He gazed from the window; the sun had scarcely risen ; the distant pcako of the mountains were still shrouded in vapour ; the tears of night hung pendent from each balmy spray; yet did the heart of love spurn rest—yet did İt shrink from the promise of quiet. He stole through the anttchamber ; he gently closed the door ; he paused to listen ; no sound was stirring: he proceeded swiftly down the gallery, with step so light, as scarce to have bent the harebell. As he reached the outward postern, as his hand was rais¬ ed to remove the fastening, a transient blush dyed his cheek, for his heart whis¬ pered his purpose was surreptitious, his object sinister ; but passion urged, and the matchless form of Gabrielle beckon¬ ed to exertion. He withdrew the bolt— the door yielded to his strength ; he fled like one escaped from bondage. Pant- i n ^
ing, he reached the well-known defile which terminated in the dell where stood the cottage. It was lonely ; the path was oVrrun with dank weeds, for pending cltös shut out the vivifying breath of morning. " Whither am I hastening ?" abked Mortaigne, as the desolate prospect of his sister recurred to memory, " Hap¬ less Corisande ! thou art doomed the sad inmate of a solitary cell, because thou hast merely spurned the fetters of con¬ trol; whilst I------" He shuddered— "Alas! alas!" he mournfully continued, '· what means my labouring heart-—my quickened pulse ?—what means this ener- ^ ating tremor which pervades my frame —which renders waste every faculty of my reason ? God of nature ! if it indeed be love, wisdom may well blush when it sinks the victim/' He leant against the projecting rock; he stood with arms folded, with eyes upraised to heaven— 4i Whither am I hastening ?" he again re¬ peated ;
peated : e< to plunge a fellow-being in¬ to misery; to enthral a guileless heart; to subvert the hopes, to blight the rosy dawn of promise; to lure like the insi¬ dious serpent; perhaps to break the heart — perhaps——" The lapse was momentary the smile of rapture evanes¬ cent. ť * Perish the blackening lure ίο sin i'* he exclaimed ; " perish the vain delusive d rea in of fevered fane\ î Infer¬ nal Pio\icience, blast thou the wretch who would transplant so fair, so beauté ous a blossom, within the bed of я ice ' No, no, Gabrielle; sanctioned by hoiv rites, Г will take thee to mv boson; though in secret thou art doomed to v>Ì- ther/' Glowing with this new-formed project, panting to realize the hopes of treache¬ rous love, coveting but the smile of ap¬ probation, every obstacle died away—- e\ erv giant danger vanished. He hastened through the defile—-he bounded o'er the WÌe:77"
.. wicker-gate—he hurled a rose at the win¬ dow—he waited in almost breathless anx¬ iety her approach. Gabrielle too had been wakeful ; Ga¬ brielle, though shrinking from the very shadow of appointment, had long since forsaken her pillow. Srľe started at the light signal ; and when she timidly had¬ ed the form of her lover, the deepened tint of her cheeks rivalled his sweet har¬ binger. " You have forgotten my in¬ junction/* she said, in answer to his pe¬ tition for her to descend ; " go, my lord : when my friend has arisen, when------" " I must see you—I must speak to you this very moment/* interrupted the count: "drive me not hence, Gabri¬ elle, you know not what you do : one re¬ quest, only one request, and I am gone." "One request!" faintly repeated the wavering Gabrielle. Mortaigne again urged ; her scruples became weaker; they died away; she quitted her chamber; she descended to vol. η. ι the
the garden. The voice of entreaty is be¬ guiling : her heart was not formed for denial ; she suffered him to draw her be¬ yond the garden ; she wandered with him to the picturesque borders of the Rhone; but the beauties of nature were lost, or rather, all was mantled by the light ether of fascination. Mortaigne supported her steps—Mortaigne drank the honied poi¬ son of enchantment. " Oh, Gabrielle !" he exclaimed, as he traced the rise and progress of passion—as he hailed the soft sigh of bashful acknowledgment, tŕ í now feel—I now admit the madness of my belief. I deposited you in yon dwell- 4ng—I barred vour flight to St. Hono- lee —I thought I could steal one look, and retire when I would ; but I am ri¬ vetted, spell-bound—-I hear you sigh, and every earthly consideration vanishes." " Those sighs arc not for self," falter¬ ed Gabrielle, and then she blushed and trembled, as though she had said too much· Mortatene
Mortaigne poured forth his raptures ; but when he recalled the past, when he spoke of their meeting beneath the ruin¬ ed haunt of banditti, the glow of pleasure vanished, tears streamed from the eyes of Gabrielle, and inward corroding anguish chased the life's blood from her cheeks. ïn vain he questioned; in vain he implor¬ ed : Gabrielle, with almost convulsive notation, held the ebon cross to view î Mortaigne was not to be silenced; he snatched it to his heart—to his lips, but he repeated the prayer for explanation. " Why, why would you drive me to de¬ spair ?" sobbed Gabrielle ; " why, why encroach upon a secret which'to unfold ь to forfeit—— " She paused—she be¬ held the frenzied start of her lover, then mournfully articulated, "I must go to Si. Honorée* —1 must hide myself and my sorrows in the deep solitude of a clois¬ ter." ■* Go/' said Mortaigne, relinquishing í 'i her
her deaths-cold hand. "Thither may the whispers of remorse ne'er intrude—may the pang of betrayed confidence ne'er rankle V* "Betrayed i'* repeated Gabrielle; "oh, no, no; misery, but not remorse, can there tind entrance !" Mortaigne gazed in irresolution ; his heart acquitted even when his judgment condemned ; fascinated by her charms confounded by convicting circumstances, he knew not which to credit. " Cruel, inexplicable girl!*' he exclaimed, "does not tender devoted interest merit confi¬ dence ?—must this accursed secret be pre¬ served, even at the expence of peace and hope?" " Is there no secret but guilt ?" re¬ proachfully questioned Gabrielle. " You know not my heart—you know not the being you arraign. No crime weighs hea* vy on my comcience—no action of my life would I seek to conceal." - Be
u Be explicit then/' implored the count ; " tell me the tie which held you in willing: bondages" " Can that bondage be willing, rt ask¬ ed Gabrielle, " which pines for the ma- ment of emancipation—which waifs but the dawn of opportunity to break, to fly the yoke ? Did I not steal in terror from the lone shelter of guilt ?—Did I not con¬ fide in the promises of a stranger, with no other security than gratitude ?—Nay, interrupt me not," checking his effort to '-peak ; "innocence spurns suspicion, ubarne alone shrinks from scrutiny. I am ihe child of misfortune—I admit myself the slave of error; for 'tis pride, pride alone which seals my lips. I would re¬ tain your friendship — I would depart without incurring your contempt/' i( Contempt !" echoed the count; "oh, i labi ielle ! w hy would you speak İn dag* rers?" tť Heaven knows, my-Jwft heart bleeds .4 ε ihe inuiction/' mou.nfully resumed * 'Л die
the agitated girl; " yet the moment for exertion approaches, and fortitude, not weakness, must be mine." " What mean you?" fearfully inter¬ rogateti Mortaigne. a l mean/* rejoined Gabrielle, t{ that the convent of St. Honorée is my best, my only security ; that in its calm and undisturbed repose, I may hope for that peace which time and reflection can alone restore/' Again her voice faltered, again her bosom heaved, " You go to St. Honorée !" exclaimed the impetuous Mortaigne : " oh no î with my life will I bar your passage î ne¬ ver, never, Gabrielle, until fate shall have sealed my destiny/' lie took her passive hand—he gazed with ardent tenderness upon her. Her golden ringlets half sha¬ ded her fair face ; her eyes were sur¬ charged with tears: every expressive fea¬ ture was touched with softness; the lily had supersede t«e rose upon her cheek, and her light form bent with the languor oi
of sorrow. Not in the meridian height of beauty could she boast half such at¬ traction ; for is not sensibility, is not ten¬ derness, the sovereign charm which con¬ stitutes woman dear to man. " Forgive the doubts," implored the count, "which dared to rise against perfection : restore me to your favour, and never again shall my promised forbearance be violated— never, never shall the murmur of com¬ plaint be heard." Gabrielle bowed her head in acquies¬ cence, but her heart was too full for ut¬ terance ; she moved slowly towards the cottage, nor did she pause until she had marked the little nook which cradled the grass*grown bed of the stranger. It was a spot for contemplation-—a spot to woo dejection even to melancholy : she had ne'er heard the tale, yet with involuntary awe had she plucked away the encroach¬ ing weed, had she trained the tender riioots of the violet. " Leave me, leave me!" implored Gabrielle, bending o'er 1 4 the
the grave, and clasping her bands in pi¬ ous fervour. " Who sleeps beneath this sod ì" de- manded Mortaigne. " Tell me, Gabri¬ elle, what link in the chain of destiny calls forth your interest ?" " Calamity/' faltered the weeping girl ; " the chain is long, the link is gall¬ ing. Goj go, my lord. The being who slumbers here, was, as I am, isolated, un· known ; one to whom fate denied a name." She buried her face in her hands —she wept in the bitterness of her feel¬ ings. In vain Mortaigne breathed the whispers of condolence—in vain he of¬ fered comfort—in vain he pronounced a thousand extravagancies of love, Gabri¬ elle could only wave him from her ; and when, in compliance with urgent entrea¬ ty, he slowly departed, it was with a mind stung even to torture in having for one instant harboured a doubt of her purity. He had passed the boundary of the park, he had gained the solitude of the shrubbery,,
shrubbery, ere the deep sobs of Gabrielle had ceased to sound upon his ear, ere the necessity for policy was remembered ; then he started, for then, like an evil ge¬ nius, did father St. Pierre cross his path. " How seldom/' observed the confes¬ sor, attentiveîv noting his features, "does the balmy breath of morning boast such attractions ! You are early, my lord. Is it the habit ofa camp, or is ц a restless pillow, which drives you in search of—" he paused for a moment, then with a half smile, and an emphasis not to be miscon¬ strued, concluded " health ? " " What else should í seek ?" demand¬ ed Mortaigne, in accents of ill-assumed indifference. " Nay, 'tis hard for me to resolve," re¬ plied the confessor: "youth owns a thousand pursuits, unknown to the frigid temperament of age." "Not always," said Mortaigne, ironi¬ cally ; " your pardon, father, but man seldom outlives the age of folly." î 3 " True.
" True, my son/' remarked father St. Pierre ; " every age has its follies, but credulity is incident to youth. *Tis in youth that the heart is most often sedu¬ ced, that the judgment is most open to imposition ; dazzled by a false glare, we believe all we wish, and sink, too fatally sink, the dupe of our own reliance." "What would he infer?" thought Mortaigne, as he moved silently by his side. " Knows he aught of the history of Gabrielle ?—would he warn me against a passion which reason cannot tempo¬ rize ?" "Has your ramble been confined?" asked the monk, " or did you mount yon height, to catch the first beam of the ri¬ sing sun ?" Mortaigne's cheek glowed, for the con¬ fessor pointed to the direction of the cot¬ tage. "The first beams of the sun, fa¬ ther, might have found me in my cham¬ ber/ 1 replied Mortaigne, *'ln truth," with a forced laugh, " my homage has been
been to the Rhone, not the sun, for I have lingered upon its borders/' " It isa broad, smooth mirror/ 9 signifi¬ cantly observed the confessor, " and re¬ flects animate as well as inanimate beau¬ ty/' Mortaigne started ; again his colour heightened, and again the demand for ex¬ planation rose almost to his lips. Father St. Pierre smiled, but he ques tioned no further; he spoke of the ca¬ sual occurrences of life; and when they parted in the hall, the count sought the breakfast-room, with a mind too full οΐ the seeming sorrows of Gabrielle to war rant any new inquietude.

Suaklspeark, "Bestir thee, sweet lady/* said Micheline, as carefuify she closed the door of the cell, and took her station by the side of the still-sleeping Corisande : " come, ba- »ish
nish this poppy-headed god, and do listen to my tale of wonder/' " Simpleton !" murmured Corisande; but Micheline was not to be silenced. " Oh, such a contrast to the father con¬ fessor !" she continued ; " such a form ϊ -—such features !—teeth like the snowy summit of the Alps, and eyes of Ethio¬ pian blackness ! By the mass ! if he would assume the cowl and scapular—if he would share the cell of father Eustache —if he would grace the confessional chair—I too would become a nun." " You are a strange, wild girl," said Corisande. " Not so strange cither," pursued Mi¬ cheline, " to prefer youth to age, and bloom to wrinkles. I warrant there's not a member of St. Honorée but would rather be shrived by father Louis than fa¬ ther Eustache/' " Father Louis!" echoed Corisande. " Yes, father Louis, or brother Louis, or
or the handsome Louis, if you will," pur¬ sued the laughing Micheline, " for he is the hero of my story. Mother of God ! if the duke de Brtançon was but half as comely, we should not be caged in this prison." *' Pshaw ! what has that to do with your story ?" asked Corisande. " hi truth not much," replied Miche» line; " but surprise makes one loquaci¬ ous ; besides, this said Louis is but a pea¬ sant youth, and who knows but St. Ho¬ norée may reward me with a husband." " Alas, poor Arnaud !" said Corisande, " Arnaud merits neither faith or thought," rejoined Micheline; "Arnaud used to swear he would walk barefooted upon flint stones only to see me ; and now weeks and months have passed, and he has not once found his way to the con¬ vent grate— Arnaud is treacherous and ungrateful, like the rest of his sex. I warrant he has forgotten all his promises; but
but it ib no matter; he is not half so handsome as Louis; and if Louis will but be submissive, and gentle, and------" " You will not be cruel/' interrupted Corisande, laughing. ? "On my life, no one could be cruel t& such a pleader. Do, my dear lady, do but see him." " How—where can I see him ?" ask¬ ed Corisande, elated at the prospect of any thing like novelty. 41 1 warrant he'll soon be here again," replied Micheline, " for he started when he saw me at the grate, and timidly asked me how long I had been an inmate of Sr. Honorée? and whether I was here alone? and when I told him that you, dear lady^ were alike caged, and that both, the saints guard us ! were, for aught I knew, destined to become nuns, the beautiful bloom upon his cheek faded, his lip qui*· vered, and he looked for all the world as though some ghost had crossed him/* " Methinks
" Methinks you were very communi¬ cative/' said Corisande. " How could I help it, my lady," re¬ plied Micheline, " when he asked to pi- teously whether it was our own free will, or whether arbitrary and unjust power withheld us?" " And what did you tell him ?" ques¬ tioned Corisande. "The truth/' answered Micheline. "I told him that will had nothing to do with our captivity; that, just or unjust, my lord marquis had banished usto St. Honorée, because you would not take a husband of his choosing. I told him besides------" "You were very indiscreet," inter¬ rupted Corisande, "and improperly free with the marquis my father's name." " You would not say so/' observed Micheline, " if you knew the sympathy he felt in all that concerned us ; for ne¬ ver did bashful virgin's face vary more frequent from red to white." " Doubtless
" Doubtless he may be very amiable/ 5 said Corisande, with a sigh, " but being a perfect stranger------" " Louis is no stranger/' eagerly inter¬ rupted Micheline, " for I had his whole story from sister Ursule, and sister Ursule had it from father Eustache : but though he were a stranger, if the human face is to be read, he is to be trusted. He said he would fly upon the winds to serve us, and sacrifice his life only to give us plea¬ sure. I am sure I meant no harm, when I told him it would give us much more pleasure for him to preserve his life ; for I would not have the life of a fellow- creature upon my conscience to be so¬ vereign of the universe." " Fear not," said Corisande, smiling; " your courage is not likely to be so taxed." " St» Marv forbid !" resumed Miche- •s line ; " for though poor Louis seems very thoughtful and very unhappy,still there- flection would be a sore burthen—a bur¬ then
then which all the penitentiaries^ and all tîıe homilies of the church could not lighten." " How do you know he is unhappy r" as t d Corisande. " Because he sighs so deep, and looks so ->ad ; sighing is no proof of happiness; I nev er sighed till î came to St. Honorée, ar, i now I do nothing but sigh to get out." <ť Perhaps/ 1 said Corisande, " the soinee of Louis's care is, like your own, imaginary/* Micheline shook her head — " The source of Louis's care," she replied, " or much my penetration deceives me, is lose. Mother of God! 'tis an endless mine—a mine surcharged with perplex¬ ity and doubt : why, you yourself, dear lady, never knew sorrow until you reap¬ ed it in the boat-hoiioe." " Fshaw î what has that to do with Louis?" asked the blushing Corisande. " Nought save a precedent to my con¬ clusion/
ilusión/' archly replied Michelino.— " 'i he heart of the king, and the heart of the peasant are alike subject to the same infirmity, for nature admits no distinc¬ tion." '* But Louis," urged Corisande, strug¬ gling with her feelings, '* how came Louis at the gate of St. Honorée ?" if Louis came to visit father Eustache/' -aid Micheline, í4 for the monk loves him ^ though he were his own son—nay, some people insinuate/' hesitating and lowering her voice to a whisper, "some people say------" she paused, then with a ithnson Hush continued, u 'tis no mat¬ ter. The blessed Virgin for« ive us all О Ci our sins 1 for though monks are not saints, and Louis is very young, no one should hint what they cannot substan» líate/* ťŕ True," said Corisande ; u allusions are hateful ; like the poisonous adder, stealing in ambush, they wound when least expected. But proceed : barring suggestions
suggestions, I would fain hear all which relates to this young stranger." " Before father Jerome, the late con¬ fessor of Si. Honorée, died," said Miche¬ line, "father Eustache inhabited a little cell many leagues distant from the con- \ent. Sister Ursule knows not whether he assumed the cowl from a disgust of the world, or from blighted attachment ; but he was always a philanthropist, and al¬ ways held out a ready hand to the distress¬ ed : he——" " Yet does the breath of detraction dare arraign his motive," interrupted Co¬ risande. " Censure is always busy," rejoined Micheline, " and assails true merit from envy ; for often, too often, does the hu¬ man heart, deformed by jealousy, hurl the random arrow. Put to proceed with my story: father Eustache had long been the inhabitant οΐ his little cell—nay, he had almost forgotten the charm of social converse, when one evening, attracted b\ í! с
the calm beauty of the surrounding scene, he passed the barrier of his own garden, and wandered along the flowery banks of the Rhone. Wrapt in self-communion — perhaps recalling the hopes of early promise, perhaps mourning the futility of earthly reliance, he perceived not the light approach of heedless youth, nor till a piercing shriek reached his ear, did he guess his affinity to any human being. Then he started ; then, with an elastic bound, did he advance, for he beheld, a few yards below, a boy struggling against the current. Humanity, that instinctive thrill which ever spurs to action, braced with Herculean power the long-enfeebled nerves of the confessor; he sprung from the bank—he snatched the al most-sink¬ ing pleader : with one arm he combat- ted the torrent—with the other he bore him to the shore. Such was the earlv fie •J of gratitude which bound the heart of Louis, for it was this selfsame Louis whom father Eustache saved from death. " In
" In despite of caution, Louis had wan¬ dered from his mother's dwelling, and but for timelv succour. Louis had return* ed to that dwelling no more, The baby, for he was scarcely five years οΐ age, wept upon the neck of his deliverer; and the monk, carefully warming hint in hi- bo^om, was aroused from the novel пьЬ of his feeling, onlv to sink once more subdued bv the wild the almost iruf-hc- rent thanks of α grateful mother. From this period Louis never failed in theg'-fti •of love ; /idly dia he visit the lone her¬ mitage of father Lustachc—for him were the earliest produce of the garden culled — to him weie the richest clusters ol the \infage presented.

God help me ! but for sister Ur¬ sule I should have lost the use of my tongue." Corisande smiled—" But how know you that Louis has quitted St Honoiee?" she inquired, after a pause of thought. " Because," replied Micheline, " Loins has been many months absent, and if »la¬ titude points to the convent, nature ¡ела* to his own cottage." " Happy, happy Louis !" sighed Cori¬ sande,
n.inde, and a tear trembled in her eye, " you return to the bosom of your mo¬ ther—you return to ihe scenes of your m fancy !" The day wore away; the brilliant beams of the sun still lingered; but Οα¬ ι isande was szd ; she saw the rich burnish of the heavens; к he saw the storied panes of St. Honorée reflect each trem¬ bling ray; yet could not the gilded beau¬ ties of the extensive garden restrict her vagrant thoughts. She paced the broad and beatened terrace ; she listened to the hum of creation ; she heard the wild rush of waters, but their source was hid by the envious bar to freedom. Never did the walls appear so high, never did the shades appear so gloomy: hope felt to die within her; every soothing promise; sank; and when she recalled the taie of the morning, when she pictured Louis hailing the blest abode of peace, her bo¬ som heaved with a sensation bordering almost amounting to euvv. "Why. VOL. П. К V S)/"
why," she exckimed, in the anguish of her feelings, "am I condemned to a lot so cheerless—am I doomed to oblivion and slavery—am I expelled the endear¬ ing claims of nature—am I exiled to the blank coldgra\e of hope and bliss ? Oh, my mother ! why am I banished thy fostering care ?—whvam I torn from thy soothing converse ? Cruel father!------" She paused—she shuddered—then with a lengthened sigh continued, " but for thee I had ne'er envied this happy pea¬ sant; but ior thee——" She crossed her bosom-—she raised her clasped hands in prayer. " Pardon a murmuring spi¬ rit," she articulated, " and teach—oh, teach my rebeli ious heart submission to a parent's will !" The inward appeal, the soul's scarcely· whispered aspiration, yielded to the start of amazement. Corisande clung to the o'erhanging cypress ; she hardly breath¬ ed, for strains of the softest, sweetest har - шопу, stole upon the breeze* It was nof the
the coinage of sickly fancy—it was not the creative magic of an entranced mind —it was that dying, that tremulous touch, which swelling into pathos, rivets the wrapt ear, and claims the senses captive. The symphony was short, the pause im¬ pressive, the words distinct : the voice— a voice eternally registered ; it was the voice which had beguiled her of her peace—it was the voice of the boat- house poet. She pressed her hands against her bosom, as though to allay the throb- bings of her heart;, she was alone, yet f.he blushed at the warmth of her feelings; lor as Petrarch justly observes, " ίο the reflecting mind, no witness is requisite to excite die emotions of shame/' She list¬ ened—she caught the passing accents ; her memory transcribed—her heart re* corded them :*— "No more, vain Hope,like n<eteor bright* Ifcguiijug oft the U'av'lu's way, Deluding by thy tre&ch'rou& hght— Λ υ muru I'll woo thy gt-mroy ray,

The strides of evening shrouded the last tints of splendor; the gloom
gloom deepened ; the grey turrets of St, ííonorée blackened to the sight ; yet did she linger, yet did shelbten, eager to catch the softest, slightest vibration ; but no sound was stirring : the voice of harmo¬ ny spoke no more, neither did the light¬ est footfall proclaim the contiguity of any l H ing being. Thoughtful, abstracted, still did she lin¬ ger on the terrace, still did she indulge the wild flights of never-slumbering fan¬ cy. Again and again did her eyes mea¬ sure the envious wall ; again and again did she sigh at the goading chain of cap¬ tivity. Love conjured the faultless form of the mountain-hunter; the magic binile, the fascinating address, mocked, subverted every floating incitement to ïhc veiľs assumption; misery seemed to lurk beneath the once-determined vow of .elf-immolation, and death the only pass» port to rest and peace. The once-sup¬ portable solitude ofa religious cell filled h-rr with despondence and horror; love к 3 tyrannized
tyrannized o'er her bosom ; a stranger, whose very name was unknown, mingled with the vitality of her being. " Alas !" mused Corisande, " t who was once so happy—I who once pressed my pillow but to sleep, rose but for enjoyment Fa¬ tal fascination ! fatal snare r How is it that my foolish heart madly clings to the charm which desolates my life, which ren¬ ders the present dreary, the future a fear¬ ful void ?—How is it that this unknown being intervenes between me and my God ?—How is it that he snatches my thoughts from Heaven, that he gilds the very dreams of slumbering nature ?— How is it that trembling hopes, that o*er- whelming despondence, that boundless wishes, that nameless anxieties, now unite, and rend my inward soul ?" Sighing, shuddciing at her own weak* ness, she perceived not the approach of the sister Mathilde ; nor till the anxious voice of inquiry met her ear, did she ac¬ knowledge within her prison one being interested
interested in her destiny : then did her heart glow to the magic thrill of friend¬ ship; and then did she gratefully press the offered hand of the nun. i4 Why, at an hour so late, do I find you in a spot so lonely ?'* ask^d the sister. " Tell me, my young friend, why do you thus exchange the charm of society for the melancholy indulgence of thought ŕ" " Sometimes, sister," timidly replied Corisande, u self is a salutary study/* " Was it self which led you to this ter¬ race?" asked the nun. " Is it the secret com ¡minion of your own heart which renders you insensible to the night's cold damps ?" ,f True," said Corisande, deeply blush¬ ing ; "the evening is indeed far advanced. I watched the gay splendor of the part¬ ing sun, nor marked the quick succeed¬ ing strides of darkness. Come, sister, let us return to St. Honorée." But her action seconded not her words; root- bound, she clung to the arm of the nun, u 4 for
for scarce had thev reached the centre of the terrace, when the same magic strain Moie upon the stillness. The nun paused in wonder, while her companion bent eagerly forward, dread¬ ing to lose t^e slightest vibration. " Strange/' whispered the sister, as the sounds ceasing, restored the native calm of the night; "who can thus seek to woo the lonely inmates of a spot so drear?" " Tis the hand—'tis the voice who weds me to solitude," faintly articulated Corisande. " Oh, sister," with an ener¬ gy all her own, " 'tis the unknown, the mysterious being, who poisons the pro¬ mises of life—who gives all my days to mourning." The mm shuddered ; she grasped the hand of the agitated girl ; it was cold, it was almost palsied; she gazed intently on her features, and spite of the fast-ga¬ thering gloom of night, traced the swol¬ len tears trickling down her cheeks. " Is it
it an ignoble, a nameless lover, who thus desolates your peace ?" she fearfully in¬ quired, " who resolves at once the seem¬ ing harshness of the marquis your father —«who dares, with tacit, with un licenced perseverance, profane an as\lum like this?" ** Oh, no, 'tis no lover !" exclaimed the enthusiastic Corisande ; " 'tis a be¬ ing whom I have seen once—who I must see eternally—a being whom my own weak, whom my own treacherous heart pictures but too perfect/' Ci A bein« to whom >ou have gi\en your whole heart," observed the nun— "a being whom you madly, vainly love?" " Love i" echoed Consande ; " oh, no, si ¡ster ; you mistake my feelings! I cannot love, for I do not even know him." The nun shook her head—" Fatal se¬ curity !" she murmured, il fatal trance of reason and of judgment î Oh, Cori¬ sande ! deluded giri ! what is it but Io\e u j v*/ch
which steeps your couch in tears— which alienates your youth from joy's gay dream—which clnthes the wishes of your father in the harsh colouring of tyranny? What is it but love which lends a ready ear to these destructive strains ? What but love which produces this palpable, this terrifying agitation?" Corisande grasped the hand of sister Mathilde, but she could not speak ; she felt herself hurried from the terrace with¬ out the power of opposition. " Foor girl ! poor victim of the heart's too treacherous fondness!" pursued the mm, as Corisande, gasping for breath, turned to catch the gathering breeze. The night was, like her feelings, dark and rayless ; no enlivening star sparkled in the vast expanse ; a sable shroud man¬ tled the melancholy moon ; and not one vestige could be traced ofa brilliant sun's decline. Corisande's eyes rested on the west» "is it thus with life?" she articulated, throwing
throwing her arms around the neck of her companion. " Tell me, sister, are the gay visions of hope thus transient r — is the dull blank of reality thus obscure ?" " Not when hope submits to the gui¬ dance of reason/' replied sister Mathilde; " not when it soars within the pale of probability." Corisande shuddered «—" Let us pro¬ ceed," she implored ; " the night-breeze chills my bosom, the damp pierces to my heart; let us proceed, sister," and again she clung to the arm of the nun. They fled through the cypress walk; thev crossed the garden : thev tarried not until they had reached the shelter of the cloister: then the nun paused, and then, releasing her arm from the almost-nerve¬ less grasp of her companion, " The skil¬ ful hand probes ere it heals/* she ex¬ claimed; " the heart must be laid bare, the secrets of the soul must be unveiled, ere tlie dart can be extracteil. Corisande «—daughter—worshipped child of an un¬ it b ^ а РРУз
happy, suffering mother! often have these stone-carved aisles echoed back the sighs of that mother—often, shrinking from the scrutiny of observation, within this cloister has she murmured her com¬ plaints !

"Alas!" murmured Corisande, "would you warn me against nature—would you shield me against the guidance of my own heart ?" " Yes, my child/' quickly rejoined the nun, ** I would indeed warn you against a control so fatal. The heart—a heart like yours,» is armed for our undoing ; nude
made up ofsoftness, sensitive as the fibre which closes to the touch, it knows not suspicion—it knows not even the caution of command." (i Oh yes, it does know, it has prac- tised'command !" exclaimed the energetic girl ; " it has practised even dissimula¬ tion ; for often has it wooed the smile of seeming pleasure, to hide the gangrene festering on its hopes; often-------" t( There lurks the danger/' interrupted bister Mathilde; "there the canker, which, pre) ing on the bud, prevents the rose from blossoming. Buried care is the can¬ ker of the sou!; corroding, gnawing, poi- boning the sweet current of health, turn¬ ing all to mourning. Tears flowing in secret, murmurs suppressed, stolen sighs, mingling with midnight watchings, be¬ come as daggeis to the wounded mind : for alas ! how can conciliating friendship touch the sorrow we daienot reveal ?" t( Dare not!" repeated Corisande, *' Will not," resumed the nun, faint Ι ν smiling ;
smiling; 'tis but changing the term, 'tis but softening the error of fallacious judgment. You picture it virtue to treasure the misered hoard, you picture it magnanimity to smother the spring of woe; alas! you forget that suspense to the feeling mind is as the aggregate of every sublunary ill, is as the microscope to the eye, magnifying into a giant what the naked vision could scarcely dis¬ tinguish/* " Tis true, I once strove to hide the rise of imagined care/' said Corisande; " I once strove to cheat my mother info peace, to smile when my spirit drooped, to smother an inquietude for which I could not account/' " Did von succeed?" asked the sister: " a novice in the practice of disguise, did the semblance pass for reality ?** " Oh no !" mournfully rejoined Cori¬ sande, " the keen, the piercing glance of affection uncloaked the artifice.

" Heaven knows, I love my mother!" eagerly exclaimed Corisande ; " Heaven knows, there is no earthly being my soul so justly honours !" * " And yet you have wrung the tear of anguish from her eve," said the nun ; " you have strewed her midnight couch with the wakeful thorns of anxiety." Corisande sobbed. ,J Poor inri ! vou have fallen into the labyrinth which wrecked her peace; you have held up the mirror of her own youth, in the rifled secret of smothered love ; you have awakened the pungent pang of memory." " It was in ignorance/' said Corisande. " The saints can bear me witness, to spare my mother's feelings, joyfully would í have taxed my own/' " xet
" Yet was the blow as deeply felt, as deeply deplored," rejoined sister Ma¬ thilde ; " for as a mother, she coveted that peace which, as a wife, was with¬ held. Poor Hortense !

" Then why," eagerly questioned the nun, " in this asylum, to which parental care has consigned yoibdo you hold secret and stolen commune with a stranger ?~— %shy, spurning all intercourse with the sisterhood, do you weaken the impulses of duty, by listening to unhallowed, to forbidden strains ?" " J hold secret and stolen commune zvith a stranger*—! listen to uahallomd, to for- bidelen

" My heart would fain acquit you," said the nun,thoughtfully, "but my rea¬ son, my judgment cannot." Oorisande replied not; conscious in¬ nocence scorned to convict by argument; she quickened her pace—she hastened through the cloibters, whilst but for the darkness of the night, the port of digni¬ fy, the glow of wounded pride had be¬ ti ay ed her feelings. The nun shadowed her footsteps ; she followed her even to her own little cham¬ ber ; she closed the door ; she trimmed the taper, whose flame burned dimly in the socket, and then taking her hand, and gazing with mournful interest on her va- r}ing features, " I have wounded where I would have healed/' she said ; " 1 have о /Tended where I would have conciliated: but though friendship may be thought intrusive, may be termed officious, the heart,
heart, conscious of its own intentions, acquits of premeditated offence." " Spare me, sister," implored Cori¬ sande; " pardon a petulance which ought not to have existed even in imagination/' " Yes, I do pardon ; I do more, I pi¬ ty," replied sister Mathilde, affection¬ ately pressing the hand she held, " for I trace the struggle within. You are young, you are inexperienced; you are hurried away by the guidance of a first passion; you are surrounded by those whom you fear to trust, because you think the frost of misanthropy has dead¬ ened compassion ; you think nature sur¬ vives not the extermination of worldly hope ; you think the veil of profession contracts the heart, and shrouds alike the feelings and the actions. Oh, no, no; your conclusions are erroneous, your judgment false; I can recai the giddy hours of youth—I can revise the dazzling dreams of infant enthralment— I can weigh the heart by the standard of con, scioin

" This is no hour for disguise, no season for subterfuge : sister, in the sight of men and of angels I declare 1 neither know his name or his occupation/' " Poor girl !" said the nun, " like thy mother, the slave of romantic sentiment; like thy mother, the victim ofa too-cre¬ dulous heart.

I would warn vou against her sorrows-*-! would arm you against her endurance/' Corisande wept ; she buried her burn¬ ing face in the bosom of the sr ter ; she recounted the mysteriesof the boat-house.

The being in whom we alike confided, the being in whom we were -alike deceived, was—is—-your father/' " My father !" echoed the shuddering ;drl, and momentarily did the flush of 'limson fade to the spectre livery of death. Deep was the pause : the nun counted her beads ; she raised her eyes to heaven ; ihe seemed to commune with herself; then turning suddenly to her scarcely-breath¬ ing auditor, "Nevertheless, I am grateful to him," Ľne continued, " for he has gi¬ ven me this," pointing to her veil, "and through this have 1 learnt resignation and charity.

" My mother?" said Corisande. " Yes, your mother was, as myself, a boarder in St. Honoiée's cloister," re¬ plied sister Mathilde. "The same age, thesame hopes, the same minds united us, but not the same expectations: your mo¬ ther possessed more than the witchery of beauty ; she was the only child, ihe only hope, of the rich, the powerful mar¬ quis de Hautenville ; she too, by d^eath, had been bereaved of a mother's care ; bhe
she too had been leñ to the guidance of a father's affection; she too -bad been consigned to the guardianship of the su¬ perior οΐ St. Honorée. How often doe* my mind recai the peaceful calm of fir^t friendship, the bahn of mutual love, of mutual interest, when endearing and en¬ deared, we breathed the hopes of inexpe¬ rience, and established a rule for our fu¬ ture lives! AlbseeingGod! how swiftly tied îhobe years of innocence and hope! those happy years, in which the deep re¬ pose of our souls, like the unruffled sur¬ face ofa lake, reflected naught but hea¬ ven—years in which no alloy crept upon * enjoyment— ν cars in which no ifuile, no deceptive lure, shioudtd the sunshine oí content !

"Hortense had but newly numbered her sixteenth anniversary, when she was sum¬ moned from the shelter of St. Honorée— when, in adieu, she wept on my boaom ; and fair as an opening lily, with innocence in her heart, and expectation in her eye, ¿be burst on the theatre of action. How blank, in one moment, became the haunt of past peace Í— how listless the tenor of my life ! Every object was changed, every feeling torpid ; the spring of cheer- fuJAiçss was fled : í wandered in moody care among the cloisters—nay, e\en at matin service, at evening vespers, did my tearful eyes turn ever to the vacant spot so lately pressed by the pious knees of my friend. fi Three months bad slowly elapsed, when the day dawned upo?i my own en¬ franchisement, when I too was summoned io

(t Behold it here, surviving years, surviving accidents, treasured as the transcript of happiness and affection/' Corisande took the paper, and as her trembling hands unfolded, her eyes к cognized the well known characters of her mother. "How often,my beloved friend," wrote the then vonthful Hortense, "have I—do I pine for your presence—do I crave your participation to constitute my felicity ! Evtry thing is new, every tiling is charming î Indeed, indeed we have never done the world justice ; it is so different to what'we e'er pictured at St, Honorée: every object is fascinating, every thing delightful : no wails to in¬ tercept the prospect ; no laws to curtail society : every one is my friend ; everv 1,3 OL«?

The marquis smiles at his little novice; he returns my caresses, but he tells me that the time will come when I myself shall transfer them. Oh no, no; my nature is incapable of such ingrati¬ tude ; my father fills my whole hearr, and never vet have 1 beheld a bein»: for whom i would forego his society î lie studies my looks; he watches all my movements ; he tells me í am the image of his own Corisande, that in me my mo¬ ther stands before him.

To me the chamber is a spot of attraction ; morn- iiio and evening do I seek it, do I make it the tabernacle of my devotion ; the chapei itself is not half so sacred: in the chapel 1 pray with the household; but by the bed whir h sustained the dead form of my mother, I commune with my own feelings. Would that you could ramble with me about this fairy spot—that toge¬ ther, as we had wont to do, we could watch the sun's decline—we could see, as at this moment, the forest trees catching the «olden hue which a brightly-glowing hemisphere reflects—instead öfihe inoun*- tarn tor-ent which rolls an awful bulwark to bt.

Here professions greet гае -on ever) side; here interest extols my every action: your love is without profession, your interest without display : the world judges me without faults; you see my faults, and stu¬ dy to correct them.

Corisande folded the letter; without speaking,
speaking, she restored it to the nun, who, with a deen drawn sigh, resumed the tíi* cad of her narration. " The count D'Arancourt, my father, received me with the tenderest affection: with transport he noted the improvement of my mind and person ; he forgot his habitual ploom ; he even smiled on mv attentions.

' One evening, during mj sojournment at Venice, I wandered alone into trie church cf 11 Sepolcro.

Oh, my sister ! had you seen her knee bend upon the mar¬ ble step, had you seen her ruby lip press the sacred ensignia of our worship, had you seen her eyes rivetted on the angel supportei s of the altar, you, like myself, had been transfixed—you, like myself, had scarcely dared to breathe, /earful lest the vision should vanish from before \ou. You smile at the picture/ continued Kve¬ rard; * Mathilde, it is not the heated fan¬ tasy of a bewildered brain : it lhes here/ placing his spread hand upon his heait ; i it will live here eternally/ ' You sure! v followed her from the church—you surely noted the place of Ler abode V I exclaimed.

departure, ϊ know not whether the sigh which involuntarii ν burst from my heart betrayed my station, but suddenly start¬ ing, she cast a fearful glance around. Her eyes met míne: she drew her veil over her face, and precipitately fled thrpugh the aisle. A lady, whom till then I had not observed, emerged from one of the darkened corners of ihe church. They spoke to each other in a low whisper, and immediately after departed. 1 gazed af¬ ter them— í marked her li 'ht form as it c* receded. What majesty, what grace ap¬ peared in every movement ! I too sprung forward ; panting for a new indulgence, i rea t hed the entrance in time to catch the .shadow of her robe as it floated on ihe air ; in time to see her, attended by sir van is in iich li vérié», enter a gon¬ dola/ ' And you beheld her no more?' 1 in- q vii red. 'Alas no!' resumed Kverard. 'From th:\t moment she lived in m v brain—from 0 ι tbCi!
that moment she eluded all my researches. in vain I frequented every place of pub¬ lic resort; the vision of light beamed no- mere up"n this vale of darkness. Scarce an evening elapsed without my repeating my visits to the church of 11 Sepolcro; but devotion lured her not from her hi¬ ding-place, or possibly she had censed to become an inhabitant of Venice.' * Poor Everard!' I exclaimed, 'and has this pas- ing phantom murdered peace ? —has the casual impression sunk so deep¬ ly Г ' Vei', it can never be effaced/ replied m v biother.

Remember the frame of mind in which vou leheld her ; soff- éned
éned by melancholy reflection, she stole upon your solitude, armed in all which is dangerous, in all which is seductive : a display of captivating piety—a form, fea¬ tures tinged with the favourable illumi¬ nations of a setting sun. No, no, my brother, you are intoxicated with an image which fancy has bedecked------* * An image which fills my whole heart/ rejoined Everard ; ' an image which fans my nightly dreams, my daily wishes.' " Poor Kverard hugged this image," puisutd sister Mathilde, " nor did he, midst every lure of gaiety, for one single instant resign it : can you then wonder, my dearest «ir!, that when in mv friend, Hortense dc Hauíenvilie, he recognised ihe original of his romantic passion, he should love her with an almost idolatrous fervour?

" Mv own fate was far more smiling. Then did the marquis de Roussillou pour the poison of adulation in my car. Young, and unlettered in the deceptions of men, 1 believed every word he uttejed; for whilst I wept at the clouded prospe î. of my brother, the sunshine of my own destiny appeared resplendent.

choly ruminations midst the cloisters, The roaring of the cataract, the moanings of the wind, were as food to despondence; she would recai the image of absent lo\c, and then weep at opposing destiny. If, in the years of childhood, a similarity of taste attached us to each other, this sym¬ pathy 'm grief, this coincidence in afflic¬ tion, rivetted the chain of early impres¬ sion. Not a thought transpired but found a resting-place in the bosom of the other, not a wish which friendship did not register, ct Your mother, Corisande, loved my brother with all the ardour of her nature; my brother loved her—holy saints ί — loved--loved is too cold a term—adored, worshipped, doted on her even to mad¬ ness, ílu every hope of peace centred in her acceptance—his every visionary dream glowed with her image. Weeks dawned and closed in the monotonous round of conventual dullness ; Hortense treasured the absent Eveiard; í dwelt on
on the treacherous promisesof his friend de lioussillon. ik It was ai the close of the vesper ser¬ vice, when each tenant had retired to her little cell, that I started at the raising of the latch, and turning, beheld Dnisilie, the portress of the convent-gate. Her linger was placed upon her lips, in to¬ ken of silence. She advanced a few steps, drew a packet from lier bosom, deposited it into my keeping, and vanished. Ama¬ zed, I gazed upon the superscription: it was the handwriting of my brother. I tore u open. A few lines in the enve¬ lope disclosed the whole proceeding. It was penned in the wildest thrill offrati- tude —it panegyrized the virtues, the no¬ ble, the disinterested actions of the fricad —of de Koussillon — who had heroic- all ν embarked in the cause of su fierin^r love, it announced that Drusillc had ac¬ cepted the bribe of service, tint she had faithfully promised to convey and re- convey letters, and that de Koussillon, that
that Everard, were themselves the dis¬ guised inhabitants ofa lone dwelling, not far distant from St. Honorée. Judge of the feelings of my heart—judge of the rapturous contrast to past despondence. My tears flowed, but they flowed in glad¬ ness ; my bosom heaved, but it heaved in joy. The threat of danger» of diffi¬ culty, was unheeded ; sanguine hope pictured the reward of bliss ; and when f tore open the few quick-penned lines of de lîous.sillon, I sunk unsuspecting into the deep-laid snare of seeming policy, I was to forward the removal of Hortense —-I was to silence the little oppositions of delicacy—I was to aid in baffling the schemes of ambition—I was to give my friend and my brother to happiness, * Ånd then/ concluded the insidious designer, * 1зггу in peace, my beloved Mathilde, un¬ til the power to separate is passed—until the altar has sanctified the firm cement oi affection—until, enlarged from the service of friendship, impatient love flies to
to claim you, the reward of every past— the solace of every future evil.* " I have burnt the lines/' said the nun, as pride and disappointed hope, combat- ted in her bosom, 'but I cannot expunge them : feeling İs too sensitive ; memory too faithful. The second enclosed letter was——" A voice in the passage, calling Ma¬ thilde, broke the thread of the story. The nun aro^e—she threw open the door. v Who seeks me?" she inquired ; " who caPs on Mathilde ?" 44 îî ь I, sister," replied Ursule, paus¬ ing at the entrance. " By order of the mother superior, 1 would summon you to the ceil of father Kustat he.'* "Alas! what new affliction threatens ?'* demanded the sister, " Ko new affliction/' replied Ursule ; " the gradual decline of strength, and the raging paroxysms of delirium, are no new afflictions. The confessor calls upon your name; and our holy mother, ever alhc
ali ve to coiti passion, summons vou to bis pallet." , У ister Mail/ilde spoke no more ; dut* and inclination pointed to the cell of sufterancc; and though her whole feel¬ ings werx; in arms, she struggled against the rising sob, and hurried from the cham¬ ber.

more effectually to rouse the interest of her young companion, she reverted to the tale of the stranger. if It was during the first months of my widowhood," she continued, " soon after I became an in¬ mate of this dwelling, as I sat in this very chamber, weeping a new affliction in the death of—of——" she hesitated, then, 3s though recollecting herself, pursued, " mourning the heavy pressure of my woes, that I was aroused by a deep moan in the garden, followed by a loud knock¬ ing, andan eager petition for admittance. Too depressed in mind and spirits to con¬ jure ought of danger, I withdrew the bolt, and opening the door, beheld a being I can never forget—a form—features like your own ; the same azure eyes, the same golden locks shadowing her fore¬ head ; but so pale, so spectral, not the marble trance of death can stamp a tinge more livid. She was supported by the arm of a monk, who, shrouded in his cowl, appeared to shrink deeper within its
fis folds, as the light glared upon his fi¬ gure. " The ladv spoke not. Tortured by the excruciating throes ot labouring na¬ ture, she could only look in supplication, and then again her deep and heart-rend¬ ing moans bespoke the return of agony· We conveyed her to the chamber you now occupy, and there, in the absence of the monk, she became a mother—she be¬ came a corse." Gabrielle shuddered—" Did she not speak i'* she inquired ; " did she not explain the mystery V* " Yes, she spoke often/' was the re» ply, " but her words were wild and in¬ coherent; her manner too was almost frenzied ; sometimes she would shriek» and sometimes she would supplicate for mercy, till Annette and myself were softened even to weeping ; and then she would doubtfully gaze upon us; and then, calling υροη the name of St, Sauverne^ m 3 she
she would beseech us not to murder her babe." " During all these bitter struggles,, where was her guardian confessor ?" de¬ manded the sympathizing Gabrielle. " Under some trifling pretence he had long since quitted the cottage, nor did he return till the sun had arisen. But you interrupt me. The clock was on the stroke of three, when the faint cry of in¬ fancy for a moment excited the smile of rapture: it was but for a moment; for when a second cry filled the chamber, the ray of sanity was gone. To the last she called on St. Sauverne. Poor suf¬ ferer I it was a name which lay near at her heart, for И was the last name which ho¬ vered on her lips, I stood alone at the bed's foot, watching her parting strug¬ gle/* pursued the dame, wiping away the tears of sad remembrance, " for An¬ nette had charge of the—of my own lit¬ tle Louts, and the orphan girl, It was a scene
scene never to be obliterated. The dy¬ ing mother was past the power of articu¬ lation ; her eyes were fixed ; her cheek re¬ clined upon one hand, the other grasped a ruby heart, which, with a small fold of papers, I had removed from her bosom. The silence which succeeded the last struggling breath was awful. In vain I listened for teturning sound ; the spirit had winged its* flight—the inanimate clay alone remained. I withdrew the heart from the nerveless grasp/' she continued, opening a small cabinet, " and together with this written fragment, as the relic of a saint have I nresened them." Gabrielle would have taken the paper, but the dame withheld it. ·· Ыиу till I have told you alî," the ¿aid, " and then you shall peruse the ex¬ isting testament of her injuries. I know not wh\," pursued the narrator, " but as I watched alone b\ the cold clay of the stran дег, a presentiment of evil op¬ pressed my spirit- interest, compassion, m 5 horror,
horror, were alike excited : in the pang of parturition, I had witnessed the death ofafellow-beinsr— аЬеиш rich in extreme youth, in exquisite beauty ; and when I recalled the circumstance of her intro¬ duction to the cottage, distrust succeed¬ ed. Her dress, her appearance, bespoke her far above the common stamp ; and í had mixed enough in the world to esti¬ mate the value of the rare gem, which, to the latest moment of existence, she ¡i,h\ so carefully treasured. I knew not what to think; e\ery new surmise per¬ plexed me, every improbable stretch of I r.agination ltd me still deeper into the ги/е. Not ftir a moment could 1 con- dc"tn the dead obiect before me : oh no! innocence was expressed in each stiíľen- td ft ature, and the mouth, fixed ina se- i.iph smile, spoke gratitude for a release iiom >\uc. I smuggled to surmount the has*y strides of prejudice, yet did I con¬ sti ue indifference, not ίο say apathy, ia the alienee of the monk ; yet didi feel distrust
distrust, spite of his holy vocation. A strange wild project possessed my brain ; and when the monk slowly opened the garden wicket, myresolution wasformed. " Quickly descending, I admitted him tí) the house, and if suspicion had before slumbered, once single glance must have revived its empire. As the night before, he still carefully screened himself with hi* cowl ; but there was an expression in the only eye visible, for his left was hid beneath a black bandage, which impeach¬ ed at once his humanity. He neither betrayed regret, or started in horror, when he heard of the death of the stran¬ ger. He questioned closely as to all that had passed : and when I declared that her words and actions were alike incongru- ous, he observed, ( that during the months uf her pregnancy she had laboured under mental derangement ; that betrayed by the sensibility οι the heart, she had been ли unfortunate alien to honour ; and that if
ifi valued the feelings and reputation of a noble house, I should bury the whole circumstance in my own bosom/ He told me too that a disclosure would be dange¬ rous to my safety, that my actions would V V Ir be watched, and that the prosperity of myself and child depended on my discre¬ tion, for that the power to punish was accompanied also with the power to re¬ ward. Aîasî what could I do э — -how could I act ? Unprotected, unsupport¬ ed, incompetent to judge, incapable to arrange, I buried my ou n doubts,anil sub¬ mitted to the politic arrangements of the monk; but care full v did I conceal mv possession of the written paper, also of the ruby heart, which I intended as a fu¬ ture memento for her offspring. He took the infant girl from my arms ; he ^azed upon her with more curiosity than feel¬ ing ; and when I petitioned the charge οΐ the orphan, he returned her to me, ob¬ ser"* ing mv \sl\h was sufficient. Poor Jit- /c
tie soul ! I pictured her my own—I pic¬ tured years of future peace in the com¬ forts Heaven had sent me. " A system of the greatest caution was continued: under the shelter of night the necessary preparations were made, and the monk himself entered not the cottage by daylight. " The grave was dug in yon defile, and the hour of interment arrived· I know not what plausible tale the monk propa¬ gated, but no questions were asked, no suspicions whispered. The necessary at¬ tendants came and returned in silence ; and with feelings alive but to compas* sion, I beheld the sad remains of perish¬ able beauty consigned to its earthly bed. " The stillness of the hour, the glare of the torch-light, the measured tread of the procession, the sonorous chanting of the monk, all conspired to impress, to ele¬ vate the mind to heaven, I saw ihe col¬ li η lowered—I saw the earth closed over it-·! felt not the chilling blast—I felt nought
nought but the solemn awe of devotion r my lips murmured no sound, my eyes shed no tear; but my heart imbibed ? sensation, registered a decision, never to be effaced. The life's dire price of the hapless stranger remained a sacred be¬ quest to my care, and the bb ied office of a mother, duty, feeling, humanity, alike taught me to fulfil·. " I returned to the cottage accompa¬ nied by the monk ; he was closely enve¬ loped in a serge cloak, his cowl still care¬ fully shrouding his features. He spokč seldom, but when he did, it was to en* force the necessity of silence, and to point out the dire forfeiture ofa breach of trust. Again and again I heard that the dishonoured family of the unfortu¬ nate lady were powerful, and that punish¬ ment or reward awaited the breach or the observance of my promise. " A whole week wore away, and the little nurseling became dear as the infant Louis to my heart. Often have I depo¬ sited
sited them in the same cradle, and watch« ed over them with an interest which stole my thoughts from my own peculiar cares, " The west glowed with the last bur¬ nish of day when I beheld the monk en¬ ter the garden ; I opened the door at his approach ; and when he asked to see the infant, I flew to seek her, without har¬ bouring the faintest shadow of suspicion. He took the baby in his arms; he mut¬ tered something of its mother, but his words were low and indistinct; and even when he told me that he must bear her to the presence qf a surviving parent, î dreamt not of design, I petitioned for the return of morning, but the monk was firm. He told me that very instant he must convey her to the grave of her mo¬ ther, for there did an impatient friend await to behold and bless her. " In vain I urged the fear of cold ; in vain I offered the accommodation of my dwelling, the monk was peremptory; he had
had hid the little sleeper beneath the folds of his cloak, and departed with the promise of a speedy return. Alas! that promise was vain and deceptive as himself; it served to beguile me of an hour's care, but beyond that hour my anxiety became painful. " Dreading a thousand ills, I watched at the window—I watched at the garden- gate— î listened to every passing breath. pantmg to catch the glad sound of his footsteps. " I will not linger over the suspense and misery of that long, long night, nei¬ ther will I enumerate the succeeding days which alike rose and declined upon the absence of the monk. It was not the monk, it was the dear baby for whom my anxious heart bled—her, whom spite of weeks, of months of absence, it could— ¡t would have recognised." " Oh no ! " interrupted Gabrielle, " aí- fection may be quick-sighted, but time changes
changes the infant countenance beyond the possibility of recognition." " Admitted," said the dame. cs Fea¬ tures mav be liable to change, but Na¬ ture's sportive hand sometimes deals im¬ pressions which not even time can weaken or expunge.

" Upon the heart Nature had stamped the private signal of cognizance," repli¬ ed the narrator. íť Sweet cherub I upon her left ^ide, below her breast, immedi¬ ately upon her heart, glowed two ruby spots, deeper than the rose blush." Gabrielle started — her bfe's-blood seemed to recede—her lips, her cheeks became livid—her breath laboured, her action wild : she tore off the covering of her bosom—she threw herself upon her knees before the dame, " Behold ! behold 1" she exclaimed, as she pointed to the mark of Nature's planting.

The dame shrieked in wild amazement; for a moment she gazed in silence ; and then, convinced, believing, she clasped the half-fainting girl to her heart.

Ernestus Berchtold: or, The modern œdipus: a tale
ERNESTÜS BERCHTOLD.
PART FIRST.
Upo» the left side ofthe lake of Thun lies the small village of Beatenberg, which, untler the caie ofa simple pastor contains no individual above the rank of α peasant, it w as in this village that I was born. Misfortune seemed to be anxious at my very bnth to stamp me for its own. — Just at the termination of the short war between Austria and Prussia, of the yeai I778, mymotherarnvedatthisvillage in company with a gentleman severely wounded, as he said, m the slight skir- B
misbes, which had alone formed the mı Iıtary display of this campaign There was a mysteiy about them, which they seemed to wish should not be unravelled The worthy pastoi, therefore, whom I have since called father, did not make any inquine« of his guests, though it ap- peered to him very singular, that the most difficult and steep roads should hav e been preferred for the route of an invalid towards his home The tendei caie of гду mother towards this gentleman was exemplary, it seemed as if tint courage and firmness, which was wanting in hi» breast, had taken refuge m her's They were not Swiss, for the language they spoke was unknown to Beiehtold the parish priest They apparently under stood German antl French, but they said so very little, and that with such evident embarrassment, that nothing could be learpt from their conveisation Tliere bemg no mn at the sohtaiy Beaterberg, the pastor, with his usuai kirduess, on
hearing of the arrival of strangers at the close of the evening, had immediately waited on them to offer his services and house. They were to have been his guests, only for the night ; but the fa¬ tigue of the journey again forced open the wound in the gentleman's side; determined, however, to proceed, he attempted to walk to the litter prepared for him ; the exertion proved too great, he fell into my mother's arms, and almost instantly expired. My mother was distracted ; already far advanced in pregnancy, she fell upon the body, no longer capable of that firmness and resolution, which she had shown, when her companion's safety depended upon it. She listened to no one ; but fran¬ tic, she sat by the dead body, alternately shedding tears, and bursting into a loud laugh. Berchtold urged those soothing doctrines of whicli he was minister, but in vain ; he spoke in vain of another world, of future hope ; none could Ufctí в 2
him, soothe the pillow of the dy ing pea¬ sant, but here were miseries no hope could assuage. She at last fell exhausted upon the ground, she was conveyed to bed, and m a few hours I and a sister saw the light. But this did not allay her grief, she sunk into a silence that no¬ thing could induce her to break, her eyes were fixed, and she at last died with¬ out a struggle, bhe was biuifcd b) him, whom Berchtold imagined, in spite ot the disparity of his years, to have been her husband, and over their grave were placed those simple crosses, .ihich you must have seen in the neighbouiing church-yards fhe pastor could not place any inscnption upon their tomb, for he had been so engaged in attendance upon my mother, that he had not noticed the departure of her only seivant, who took with him every thing of value be¬ longing to his *brmer mistress He knew not what to do, there ν as no clue in his hands by which he could restore us to
our family, for theie was nothing to be found, except some linen and a locket, η iti my mother's portrait Berchtold was a man whose humble en¬ deavours had alvvayb been engaged in the attempt to fulfill those duties his profession imposed upon him. In these mountainous districts, the office of a parish priest is extremely arduous, he is often called up m the middle ofthe night, whde tht snow is falling, to go many miles over the fro¬ zen glaciers, to administer to the dying peasant the sacraments of the church. Berchtold never allowed the most distant hamlet to vant leligious comfort; hewas old, ) et often has he crossed to tbe foot of the Holgaut, meiely to help the unfor¬ tunate m then attempt at îesignation, undei domestic cihmity. He was not, therefore, likely to cast us from him, bv immediately liad us conveyed to the cot¬ tage of a mained sister, and caused us to be brought up as luxuriously as an Alpinei ι illage allowed в S
I remember little of my early years, it seem«, that I have vague visions of in age, when were spent whole days in gathering flowers, to adorn my sister's head and breast, rom the precipitous bank that descends to the lake, when, at mght, I was lulled half trembling, to sleep by the tales ot my foster mother concern ing ogres and spints from the dead Bat all this is indistinct When about six years of ige, I was removed to the house ot Berchtold He called me son, and if the tenderest care and the greatest sacrifices could entitle him to the name rffathei, which I g?ve hnn, it was not Wiongfully bestowed One of the first eircumstances which I can remembei, is that one day, while sitting will mm upon é bank, neartl e church yaid, gazing on •flie scene aiound, and witching the white soils which gleamed upon the lake be itaatli our feet, I thiew myaimsaround Ins neck, and asked him, " Why thev eilled me orphan v ' He tob me that irv
father and mother were dead. Reti eating from bun, 1 started, and trembhng, asked inm if he were then dead ' He did not at first understand me ; but upon my call¬ ing him by tbe name of father, he re¬ membered that I had never heard the his¬ tory of my birth. He took me to his breast, and weeping, told me, that I was indeed an orphan, th&t I was not his child. He then took me to the church-yard, and pointing totheraisedsod.hetoldmemyparentswere there. I did not clearly understand him. I had then no idea of death ; my mother, foi so I called his sister, had told me tales ot the dead, but these terrified without being understood. All the graves, save those of my parents, were adorned with flowers, upon my remarking this to him, he told me tliat they having died strangers theie none weie bound to love them I was hurt to see those flower?, which tl ough faded, shewed the atfen» tion of some living being, refused to my mother's tomb, it sunk deeply on my в 4
mind. And ŕor years after, I felt Я \ague pleasure in strewing their graves w th the fresh flowers that formerly weie emplojed in adorning my sister's head. Often haie I laid mjself down looking upon then grassy covering, as if I ex¬ pected that some of those tales of my rr othei would be realised with regard to myself, and thit I should see them rising from their grave. M) sısteı soon joined me in these medıtıtıons, and almost the first infantile communications which passed between us, ι ested upon another world. She would sit by me, and often the worthy pastoi surpnsed us, after the sun had set calling to our memoiy those tales we had heard vhen with our fostei mother. We did not mingle with the otner children of the village, for we dehgh'ed too much in each other's company ; we spent hours togethei in talking about what had in э most unaccountable man¬ ner taken possession of our mmds, or
else we gamboled round Berchtold He, debarred by his religion fiom the enjoy¬ ment of a domestic circle of his own children, had foimed so strong an at¬ tachment to us, that his greatest delight wis, when not engaged in his parochial duties, to join us in our games and ïn- fintile occupitions With all the sim¬ plicity of old age, he would he down and illow us to phv with his white locks, 01 tell us stoi ies и h ch, though of a different nature from those of his sister, did not interest us the less He was ι good c' issical scholai, ind ivas well versed m the history of his own country From these sources he drew his tales, and at in eaily ige be inspired me with an irdent lov e foi independence and liberty, it the same time that he mstdled into my hent, a binning thnst for the means of issertmg ι superiority over my equals. The inecdotes of 1 hemistoeies, Alci¬ bíades ind others, upon whom the fates of their country had depended, rested в 5
on my mind Beiehtold descnbed to me thefallen glories of fíome, of tint nition which once held sway over the known tvorld In short there wis ι materni defect in my education, which is not uncommon, my imagination was stimu lated, while my judgment wis not called forth, and I wis taught to admire public instead of private virtues I rested upon those situations which one in the million attains, and in which the pass ons of others are to be guided, whiie I w ıs not shown how to conduct myself, when mv own inclinations and fephngs might at¬ tempt to lead me astray in the connnm occurrences of life With a stiongly susceptible mind I imbibed deeply these fiist impressions, md throughout life this defect in my educitnn has followed ¿re As I advanced in age, I gndually became acquainted with the Latm and Greek historians Berchtold rashly, though innocently, took advantage of my th.rst for relations of bittles and deed«
of ìenown, to induce me to learn. I consequently had Plutarch and Livy in my hands, long before I read any book tending to give man the power of regu¬ lating his passions I joined the villagers only m those militai y exercises, which aie constantly performed aftei the day's labour in every hamlet Sometimes I would go with the chamois hunters, antl leaching the higher ridges of the Alps, whose snowy summits were visible from the lake, I forced myself to follow him in his venturous pursuit But it foi a long time required a strong exertion of my mind to induce me to venture itmdst the \ ast solitudes of eternal snows I always felt an in- waid bhuddeung and awe at the sight of my native wildnesses Even now I can¬ not bear to listen to those, who, amongst our magnificent scenes, which man has not yet oveicome, and which mock his powei, can talk of pleasure, and dwell upon the beauty of the scenery I cannot в 6
feel this. I seem always to crouch beneath some invisible being whose power is infinite, and which I am con¬ scious I cannot resist It seems that 1 hear him laughing a„dibly at our vain attempts to encroach upon his dominion. it appears to me as if the avaltmche were but the weapon of his impatience, while he insidiously steals upon those habita¬ tions he has covered vvith his snows, by the silent, gradual approach of' the gla¬ ciers. Let mankind labour for ages upon these ribs of the world, and their work shall not be seen. The pyramids might rise unnoticed upon the rocks before my v.ev, undistinguished from the fragment that falls unperceived with the passing torrent. I cannot bear tliat human strength should be unable to stamp its hand upon these toweling memorials of conv ulsions we could not influence, could not ßope to controul. This morbid feeling may have been excited by my foster mother constantly
pointing to the Jungfrau, vviiose white peak foi ms so prominent α featui e m the view from her nouse while she related the peasant's tale of those mischievous spirits who dance upon its glittering icy coat, decked bv the moon's raj I gained, howevei, health and vigour from these escuision ..lid I became at last one of the most noted for activ it/ m all the canton Irapidh aimed at my twentieth year M} kmd f lend the pastor could not be induced to pait with m» I was the only piop of his old age, I latter]), always accompanied mm in his visits amongst the mountains often joined him m his piajei over the dying, and frequently have I suppoited him at the bunk ofthat giave over which he was calling down the nifi cv of God, and which was soon to be his own refuge My sister in¬ creased in beauty, and each day added »ome new charm to lier person, and some additional accomplishment to her mind.
I often represented to my fathei that 1 Was of an age when I should begin to do something, and attempt to take the bui then of tnjself and my si«tei off his hands. He would agiee with me in my aiguments, but when the moment came, he was always so oveipoweied with soi¬ row, that I could not induce myself to leave him foi the few remaining days he had to live. I seldom visited Thun m Inteilaken, I did not feci pleasure in the society of men. I theie ound them engaged in all the petty mteiests, which pervade human bie a sts in the nanow spheie of a miserable provincial town. I founu they could not sympathise with one whom they looked upon as a wild romantic mountaineer. About this time the 11 ench revolution began to exalt my imagination even more than the history of nations gone by, and I burnt with the desire of viewing neai er those actions, which in our sohtary village, echoing only a
softened sound of their horrors, seemed to wear a certain air of grandeur and glory. I ai dently wished to join those soldiers who had tluven back the foreign invaders fiom their native plains. I little thought then how soon I was to be engaged in ïesistmg these very men, amidst my own native mountains. When the discu=aior-s between Berne and the Fiench concerning tiie Pays de Vand ariested the attention of ali, anxious tobe amongst men in action, and tned of my total want of employment, í again begged my fnend to let me depart to the capital; but still, at his piayer, I remained with him. I laid myself down upon the snow, shining as it then was m the first lays of spring, and abandoned myself to visions of battle and lenown. My spints gradually left me, there was a craving for exertion about me, which I found it impossible to overcome. I seized my grm, and going amidst the· eternal glaciers and rocks, I sought by
foWing myself to exert my body, to lose this feeling of vacuity. But I often ¡est sight bf the chamois, engaged iu the thought of my country, and bounded from rock to rock, no longer occupied With what I imagined was before me. My sister vvould endeavour to sooth me by her caresses, btold her of my visions with regard to my country's cause, and at moments excited even in her breast the sparks of enthusiasm. But she gene¬ rally echoed Berchtold's sentiments vvith regard to the indecision and incapacity of the government. Tired one evening of listening to Berchtold, who attempted to repress my •ardour, by representing to me that the country was betrayed, and that, in con¬ sequence of the tardiness and imbecility of the rulers of Switzerland, in spite of' the courage and daring of its peasantry, ît' was doomed to become an easy prey tÔ-France, I left him determined agam -tó Seek Tef 'age in the chase. 1 according- 7
ly set out the next morning, intending to remain seveial days amongst the moun¬ tains, but I grew listless and at the close of the second day, 1 still found my¬ self upon the Wengern Alp I issued forth from the chalet wheie I had taken some refreshment, and soon lost myself m reflection I now looked with pleasure upon the Jungfiau's white head, glisten¬ ing on the blur· canopy of heaven All the horrors of the Grindewald at my feet, the high summit of the Schrechorn, with the láclioing thunders of tiie nume¬ rous ayalarche», no longer appalled me It seeťŕied as if they now put on their terrors against a piesumptuous foe, in defence of then childien There was no cloud upon the dark blue sk), — there was no mist upon the rocks, and though the snow still covered the whole surface ot the mountains aiound, still there was α genial warmth and splendour m the sun's reflected lay, that vivified and strengthened There was no sound, save
that of the distant cataract, and falling avalanche I stood a long time leaning uppn my musket, to look upon this scene. How could avance hope to find a resting p)ape in the minds of tnose nursed amidst such objects ? How could slaveiy expect to find its votaiies resident amidst such foi tresses? The tyiant could not dare to add these horrors of nature to those aheady revelling in his bieast. A slave who shrinks before the frown of a despot, could not stand piect amidst these awful monuments of a powei that mocks at human prowess, upon this occasion, it seemed as if the sun threw its proudest lav upnn these îotks, they had seen, might hope to see, men wor¬ thy of gizing upon that natine which, lifting unappalled its head amidst the thundeung clouds, had snatched then weapon fiom then giasp, and had thiown it nt its feet, while, with its snowy head, it stiuck щ defiance the ai clung canppy of heaven. 1 was thus engaged in thought,
which but served to ıncıease my indigna tion at the conduct of men, who sacri¬ ficed to personal interest »he safetv oí then country, when I wis suddenly struck with the sound of a voice, which Γ shall never, never forget In unison With my feelings at that moment, the notes sometimes broke out into the wildest tones of defiance, at others, suddenly sinking, tliey seemed uncertain and soothing I dared rot look around; I felt as if entranced, and I imagined I heard the voice of these mountains, mockmg the invaders, then sinking into despondence Gn bully the voice ap¬ proached, — I could distinguish woids — I heaid footsteps I suddenly tinned round, and belipld a figure, I cannot describe it to you Airiyed in α dress foreign to these mountaiis, her white diapery, breathed on by the wanton breeze, now betiayed the delicate form of hei limbs, — now hid them from iriy sight Hei dark ej e seemed exultmgťy to
gaze upon my native rocks, while the wild notes of defiance played upon her lips. She suddenly saw me, and was si- Jent. She looked around, ¡is if' for some one ; antl I then perceived, at a little dis¬ tance, a man worn down more by grief' than by age. I approached, and re-as¬ sured her. She blushed, and in that lan¬ guage which, in its very sound, breathes love, told me that she did not understand me. I could not answer; but, gazing on her, I seemed to be fascinated by her words. The old man approached, and we soon entered into conveisation. I spoke Italian fluently ; her suipri/e and pleasure cannot be painted, when she heard me address her father in her native language. I walked by her side, and I was often so lost in thought, that I was obliged to answei', by an unmeaning yes or no, the questions of the old man. Our conveisation at last turned upon Switzerland; he seemed to be perfectly conversant with its situation. She entered
with enthusiasm into its cause, and asked me, why I was idling amidst these valleys, when my country called me to the post of danger. These simple words from her ¡ips caused an emotion in my breast that drew the blood to my cheeks, She thought of me. I at once promised to join my countrymen to-morrow. She then told me, that orders had arrived at the neighbouring towns for an instant levy to join the army of D'Eilach, which it was expected would be immediately brought into action. I was yet walking by her side, when »e arrived at Lauter-brunnen. At the gate of а small cottage, after having asketl me to take some refreshment, which I declined, they bade me faiewell. There was а carriage waiting at the door. The thought lushed upon my mind that I might never see her again. I know not by what impulse, but, ignorant of the forms of the world, I summoned courage,, at the moment of parting, to asit of Iter
a ribbond with whicb she was playing, that, as I said, 1 might wear it in le- membrance of her who had made me de¬ cide upon joining the patriots. Blushing, she looked at her father, who smiled con¬ sent, and she bound round my arm the scarf which she had worn during the morning. I have often heard that song agam; I have often seen that form ; and many are the years I have worn that scarf: — tliey have been years of misery and gnef. Memory has no moment to look back to between the present and that happy day. Yet, for such another moment of enthusiasm I would undeigo all my miseries afresh. I revert to it as the Arab, in the midst of the rising sands, turns to his visions of the green speck upon the desert's sand) ocean, anudst dangers, that is his hope, in an¬ guish, that is his refuge. That moment seemed to bestow upon me the happiness which my fancy had so long pictured m the future. But every moment since has
only served to weave closer round me the meshes of that net, which has shut me out from joy I then, however, felt as if time no longer weighed upon mb, and I was gueved, when arriving at my father's door, I found th -Ч the joys of hours had passed as those ofa minute I found my sister in tears, Berchtold, with his grey locks hiding the hands co¬ vering his face Hearing my footsteps, my aged father rose, and taking me m lus arms, with tears in his eyes, he told me, that he could no longer take upon himself to hinder me from joining my countrymen in the sacred cause of inde¬ pendence He bade me take leave of my sister, and, while my courage remained, to surmount the pangof bidding her farewell He told me, that he hid caused my sister to prepare every thing for a parting, which he feired wis to be our last He embriced me, and lushed out of the house My sister's eyes, wet with tears, now turned upon me, anxious to show
the same resolution as my father had dis¬ played, she hastened my departure. She gave me my gun and powder flask, — bound round my waist more than halt the savings of Berchtold, and kissing me, bade me farewell. Bewildeied by the ra¬ pidity of my different emotions, I burned to the side of the lake, looked once more up the steep mountain, on the ascent of which Beatenbeıg ıaısed its white cot¬ tages, and, turning the point of land which encroached upon the lake, I was soon wafted, in company with many others, towards the town of Thun 1 did not heed the white sails huirying along the blue npplmg waves. 1 could not gaze upon the neh cultivated scenery of the lake. My mind was straying midst those wdd glacieis, that once had been my horror, — which to day had shewn me tlie unknown Why does fate cause the ap¬ proaches of misery to be decked with all the show of promised happiness? From this moment begins my eventful
histoiy , till now I had only been m the hands of the foul fiends that have tor mented me, as plastic clay, which they foimed in that mannei best fitted to cpn tain the misenes they were preparing to pour upon it You may think I fiaye rested too much upon my eaily years, which passed without action, but those years saw deposited in my bieast the seeds which have biought me to the state of apathy and miseiy you witness Tnat vision has pioved to me the harbinger of moie woes than it piomised pleasuies, an I that scai f, which y ou see ıs yet bound iound my hent, has felt it beat moicviolentlyChiough anguish, thin it did even thiough hope, it themomentitfirst encucled my aim My bfe till now had passed in dreams I had not known the iude blast of wcrldlv ınteıests, I had been unconscious of the activity of the bad passions, and had onlv viewed man m the shape of my foster fathei, breaking by his presence the shackles of vol ι с
grief that resti amei? the energies of his children, as the sun destroys the icy bonds that bind the vital powers of the spring. In the cause of chanty and % ir¬ tue, I haa seen employed those powers and that activity which, exerted in α les> degree, have often excited the admir¬ ation of the multitude, and concealed follies, nay, cumes, from even the philo¬ sopher in that halo of fame they bring around them The earliest impressions, I received, were those from my foster- mothei's tales, and they lave not left me even at present, how much less, when but enteimg on manhood I had so often gazed upon ni) mothei's picttue, „hicli my sister woie iound her neck tiom hei earliest infancj that, while sittm¿ by her tomb, it seemed ts if Uet image had haunted me in nn sleep, foi I fiequently found nivself α „inng as if I had liad actual pi oof of the existence of beings superior to ouiselves The e\ enmg hat closed before I ai nv ed

We weie ordered immediately upon our arrival to leinforce the army at Frt- uenbrunnen, and were joined upon oui departure by othei militns, and by the venerable Steiguei, who had just tin on n up the insignia of cıvıl office m the detei - mination of dying for his country. We arrived at a critical moment, the Fiench ha\ ing an advantage in cavalry and aı til- lery, which the Swfas could not resist, were upon the point of suiroundmg the small aimy, the only impediment m their road to Berne. Steiguei ımmedıatel) per¬ ceived the danger , ordering us to foliou , he rushed forwards, and attacked tlic troops which, having ilreaelv passed the light flank of Geneial d'Filach, weis. upon the point of g-umng the roul on his rear. The combat was obstinate, our chief attack was upon the aitillerj, with. which the enemy was tttemptmg to ci oss the road. Oui women did not shnnk, they rushed forward, threw themselves upon the wheels of tili, guns, nnd allow dl

Vie found ourselves surrounded and en¬ gaged amidst the very carriages of our enemy's guns, which we had taken. By gi eat exei tions at last we foimed ourselves again into a compact body, and suddenly, as if by one impulse, falling upon ourknees, weofferedapiayei totheGodorbattle.The enemy thinking we wei e about to throw tlow n oui ai ms, checked themselves for a moment, we arose, the officeis placed themselves at the head of the column, which set up α loud shout, ¡an upontliefoe, and beai irgall opposition down,soon ι each- edUiteien, wheie we made а momentaiy stand, and then ìeaclied Grauholtz. The tioops weie immediately em¬ ployed in nising an abbatis in front. While the men weie thus engaged, Ei lach and Steiguei met, at the instiga¬ tion of the latter, the general tame с 6

I was particulai 1) noticed by them, and ıeceıved fiom the iged gener.il a medal he woie round his neck, is a token of his countiy's giatitude.

Wiih him was his wife, who had accompanied him ш his flight, and a young officer, whom I had remai ked earnestly engaged m looking at my scarf, at the moment I was lereiving the gene¬ ral's thanks at Grauholtz. I remonstrated with the soldieis, but in vam. 1 gradu¬ ally, howevei, contrived to appioach the general, and, when I thought myself suf¬ ficiently near to shield Inm, di awing my sword, I called upon the Bealenbeigeis to assist me, and instantly attacked them The young officei, possessing himself m the struggle of a swoui, was soon by my side.

I laughed 't what I deemed hei folly ; but I soon perceived that theie was something moie on hci mind than she was willing to confess. In vain I be¬ sought her to disclose it to me, she told me she durst not, and asked me as a favoni not to speak to her any more on this subject. Alarmed, I knew not why, I looked at hei with earnest attention. She could no longei beai it, but tlnovv- mg heibelf into my arms, infoi med ine that while 1 vvas awiy she had seen our mothei, who had applied to bei, .11- ìayetl in mourning, announcing, that 1 was in the gieatest dangei, and that she must guaiti ine, but that unless she wished to shaie my peul, she must con¬ ceal it fiom me " Lrnestus, ' my sistei said, " I cannot obey, let youi fate be

I was moved, I sat down by hei side ; bound m each other's arms, we gazed upon the gieen sod m silence, un¬ willing to disturb those thoughts which we know must be the sime in the breasts of both. Anxious to leain some tidings concein¬ mg the fate of my native counti), I went esery day to Thun. M) indignation yvas excited b) the îecitalof the ciuelties and extortions of the Fi ench, and, when they daied to attempt disaiinmg the inhabitants, deteimmed not to submit to so base an insult, I wis piosciibed, and sought lefuge amongst those mountains which had been the scenes of my piowess in the chase. I went and sit whole days by the locks in the Wengein Alp, where I fiist saw tliat form which has since engrossed the л hole of my thoughts. I made enquiries at Lauterbrunnen con¬ ceinmg the two strangers, but meftec-
tinily, they had merely been there as other travelleis, to view the sublime scenery of the mountains, and had not been heaid of since I remained a whole month amidst these rocks, only going to Beatenberg at night, when Berchtold and my sister would receive me, and supply¬ ing me with piovisions for the ensuing days, tell me of all the insults that added to the shame of Switzeiland But at last they showed me the proclamntion of Schwarenberg against the six eastein cantons I immediately announced my detei mination to join them Berchtold said nothing, my sısteı followed me out of the house, and begged to be permitted to accoinr any me I lefused, and upon hei leminding me of heidieam, told hei, that, as it promised she should share my peril, it would piove impossible for me to go mto any real danger without her, that therefoie she need not follow me, 01, it the fates decreed it, we should meet it that noment without any endeavouis on
our part to assist their fiat I painted to her the horrors of the exterminating war fare tint was earned on, and asserted thit it was most likely not the peril of the sword m which she w as to pirtake In short, I forced her to promise me not to follow, by reoiesenting to her the misery Berchtold would undergo, if at once deprived of both of his adopted children I led her back to the door, md left her m his arms It is useless for me to give vou an iccount of this campaign It is recoided m history with even all the unsuccessful struggles for liberty, as one of those gleimings of that noble spirit in men, which, though genei illy hidden under the piessure of vice and corruption, it times bursts forth like the volcano's fire I was taken prisoner, and could find no meai s of escaping, till the French, tow ards the end of June, after the lestoi ation of Rapinat, became more lenient m their treatment of then pnsoners, and less caie-
tul in then watch ovei them I once more joined the Ltu'eiwalders, and was agam witiies·, to the defeat of my countiy- men. I met the young ofhcei I had saved f ioni -daughter at Musingen His name was Olivieri Vi e had no time for inteicoiirse, alwajs m action 01 on the march, vie only saw one anothei in the field, wheie we of ten joined and ti led to ме with each othei in acts of dai ing and courage We became at last noted m the aimy, and though only lolimteers, we each soon found oiusehes at the head of about ninety men, vho always wer" íeady to obey our comaiands In tlie midst of our struggles in the Underwald, intelligence leached us of an insuriection having taken plice m thfa, upper Valais , it was deemed mcessary by the leadei » of om army to aeiid them assistiucp, and thus cause а duel sion in our галош llıey pioposed that one hundred men should be given to eacn of us, and that with this foice we should be
sent to aid the Vahsians m their attempt It was a hazardous undert »king, we had to cross upon the flanks of the enemy, and should be obliged, it was supposed, to pass through the Gnmsel, which was in the possession of the Fiench When it was proposed, no one was found to volunteei, no Undeiwalder would leave his home in the hour of dangei I had however ie marked a number of Schweitzeis, who had joined us singly, having left then dwellings, though not countenanced by their countrymen who weie ranged on the other side, to partake in the dangeis of the patnotic Undei waldeis To these men we applied, and m -ν shoit time, two hundred men were selected We kept almost upon the summit of the high ridge that joins the Furca from the Lake of Lucerne, and crossing the glaciers by rocks, that even in the chase of the chamois would have startled me, we ar¬ rived at Realp, and soon crossed into the Valais At Obergesteln we learnt that
some French troops had that very mght crossed fiom the Gnmsel, while the whole body of peasants were engaged in the lovvei pait of the valley, amidst the fastnesses ittemptmg to stop that force which was advancing by the bridge of Hochfiue. They had committed great outrages, and had caused those, who were able, to fly behind the glacieis of the Rhone. Our undertaking now seemed despe¬ rate llie numbei of the Fiench in the rear of oui allies was gieatei than ours, and the end of the Valus thiough which we were to advance was flat and open, without any sheltei, sun ounded by steep mountains. Obvien wis however befoie me, we hail each one hundred chosen men, antl he seined íesolved on advancing Not know in,, how to pio- cure intelligence ot the «nemy, I imme¬ diately offered to advance by myself and leconnoitie. As I well knew every pait ofthis valley, I was ceitainly the fittest
person in our body for such an undei taking; but my companion would not hear of ceding the post of danger to me , we were obliged to draw lots, and it fell upon him, and he depaited. In the mean tune the women, heanng of oui arrival, came fiom then fastnesse», and joined us. Ihey seized upon evei) thing which offered the semblance of a weapon, and resolved to follow us As my companion did not retuin as soon as I expected, fearful of а surpi ise, I de¬ termined to adi ance, and, if possible, gam some of the passes befoie the enemy knew of our arrival, I, howevei, previ¬ ously sent foiwaid a young woman, to see if she could obtain any intelligence of Olivieri. I then ordered the men to fol¬ low in silence, and marching all the even- mg, we at last, towards night, reached the village of Bhzingen, where the vallev straightens, and becomes more inclosed and rocky. The nver here runs throt gh a deeply-cut channel, more resembhng
α lavine, than a common bed. As I knew theie wis but one pith, and that veiy steep md dingeious, I oideiediny men to rest upon then aims, while I went along the nvei's chmnel to learn some¬ thing conceimng the enemy, who I thought eould not hive advanced much faithei Atlast, being in ived opposite the vill ige of \ letscli, I hend ι great noise, md s iw m iny lights, making no doubt but thit these pioceeded fiom the point vv liei e the enemy w is st itioned, I re- tui ned I found my inen asleep, arousing them 1 iscended it then head the steep sides of the mount un, md making them march p u illel w ith the path, but much highci, I biought them above the village, and hid them in а wood of pines that stretches along the steep. I now no longei feaied the supenoi numbeis of the enemy, the iscentvvis so piecipitous that w e could not be attacked, except to gi eat disadvantage, while we could eithei join D
the Vahsians, or fall upon the foe with every piospect of vıctoıy. I detei mined once more to go antl dis¬ cover then etaet position, giving the woul that if I thought it α ht moment loi an attack, I vvould hie my gun, and then sound my hunting hoin, so th it no mis¬ take could occui fiom the filing of mv di unken soldiei» 01 guaid W ι «pt up in my mantle I descended ftoni the wood, and found the men lying seem ely asleep m the io.ad betwten the houses Ihey weiecei tainly ill theie , .anxious to know something concerning my tompinion, I lCbolved, in spite of the nsk, to awaken some stıaggleı, anıl İtanı fiom him if any pnsoner was amongst them. I accord¬ ingly appioaihcdone who, »tietelud along the edge oí apieeip.ee ovei the uvei, was sunk in а sleep that seemed that of the in¬ nocent. Putting my pistol to hi» bieast, I awokelnm. Alaimed, he was upon the point of calling out, when I thicatencd him with instant deith. To my inquiries
he answeied, that a person had been sui- puzed by some stiagglersinthe couise of the diy, and he added that he was then lying bound m a cottage in the veiy cen¬ tié of the village, destined to be in the morning а but foi then muskets. It did not appeal that his having been found pi med had excited suspicion, as he was tiken foi α common peasant. Deter¬ mined to sive Ohy ıeı ι, I knew not what ю do with this sleeper, to shoot hnn would alai in the enemy, they might immediate¬ ly dispttch ni) fnend, antl yet Icould not leave this mm to ıaıse his comiades. 1 pushed lum tlovvn the pıecıpı e, and dnectly enteied the village. Al 1 were asleep, I found the cottage, theie was a hgnt in the window. I stole close to it, wrapping nivself up in my mantle. I looked in , yoa may imagine my ulaim when I saw two sol liei s awake m conver¬ sation, while my fnend, upon his back, was bound to a bench fastened to the flooi Thei e weie several soldieis at my d 2
feet, with then arms by then side», ι sudden thought struck me, I seized one of then guns and firing it, I instantly it- treated to the othei side of the cottage, where I had lemaiked a window close to the fatal bench. As I expected, the two soldiers went out to inquire about the i с port which they had heard, I took advan¬ tage of the few moments, leapt into the room by the window, loused Oliviei i, who gazed upon me expecting death, I made а sign for silence, cut his bonds, and was again out of the cottage w ith my com¬ panion, when I heaid the dooi open to ad¬ mit the two soldiers. We hastened up the ascent, and when, amidst the locks I hied my own fow ling piece, and blew a national air upon my hoi η Befoie the tnemy, alarmed by the two soldiers, who missed their pusonei, could foim, we were amongst them, and morn had haidly dawned beioie we had cut to pieces the whole of this detachment. I could have indue ed the men to give quaitei, but the

The buds ol piey weie not distuihed by oui piesence, they continued feeding on the dead. While walking amidst these nuns, I at last heaid the sound ol a voice, it w as the tiy of soi ι он. A mothei had found woids to call on heaven foi stiength to beai hei individual gnef, heedless of hei d i
countiy's death. I saw hei imidst thesi ruins, her hands weie teanng up the soil to give the last lefuge hei countiy could aftoid to hei child,—a giave. She did not at first peiceive me, when she did, hei hand woiked doubly quick, while, with hei eyes fixed upon the corpse, hei hun ied lips utteied, "hold youi hand, hold youi hand foi a moment, I shall soon be íeady to follow." I dug hei son's giave, and left her stnking the sod as if she ι epented of having resigned the body to the earth. We assembled oui few lemainmg com¬ panions, Obvien and myself addiessed them, we advised them to sepaiate and seek singly a refuge m their homes. While yet speaking one of them biought befoie us a man, who seemed to h ive usen fioin the grave. His giey locks, thinly scattered on his head, w<,ie entmg- led, his eyes were sunk so deep withm then sockets, that then lustie seemed the last glimmering of life beioie it sinks.
He hid sought death fiom the foes, and they, in inoclei), hid bide lum live They had f istened hım to а tibie in the open an with seveni diys' pıovısıon withm his ι eich, and hid placed before his sitjit the coipses of his aged wife, his childien md grmdchildien, all maik¬ ed with the vv mton infliction of then bai- birous cruelty, not even excelled b) the voracit) ol the vultuie oi beists of prey Tins w ι etched being told us that the Schweitzeis hid tioops pi iced the whole length of the othei side of the like, to hinder the fugitives fiom this valley csciping Upon this intelligence our men became dejected, the thoughts of dying iiigionojsly by the hinds of then tieacheious countrymen, weiLjie- 1 upon then mind fhey spoke some time imongst themselves, ind then begged of us not to desert thein, assui ing us that if we enabled them to leich the upper pirt ot Schweitz unbroken, they then could disperse to their fimihes without danger

Knowing the country well, and being acquainted with eveiy pass, I found no difficulty in leaching the neighbourhood of Beatenberg, and I was soon locked in my sister's ai ms. Beiehtold and Julia's anxiety about me had been great, they had heaid by ïeport of my being m

gett of me to relate the dangeis I hadun- deigone, I gave liei a minute account ol tbe whole. Amongst othei things which she men¬ tioned to me, was the ainval of а stianger, who had taken up his abode at Interlaken, anıl who excited the wonder of his neigh- boms by the account his sei vants gave of his uclies, and by their intimation of his having communication with an evil spirit. The som ce of his liehe» was unknown. Many weie the tales ι elated concerning him, and if but half weie true, she said, he must ceitan.ly be possessed of a won¬ derful powei. He was old and appaiently wietehetl. His only daughtei accompa¬ nied huu, bei beauty was as much the subject of couvei »ation, as the nche» of her fathei. These weie the only lumouis my sısteı had htaid, loi they hid only arrived α few days btfoie. I wish tliat I had never known moie I did not laugh at the idea of the supernattu.il pai t of the lepoit.

I cannot explain it, but I wished even fiom Julia's dieams to aid the repiesentation 1 had foimed fiom her poi¬ tiait of а being, who seemed even after life, to feel an mteiest in my fate. In the locket, there was ι melancholy look about hei daik blue eyes, that was len¬ dered heavenly, by the soft smile playing upon her open hp. I hid gazed upon it so often, that I had her image before mc, even when fai fiom home, but it was only distinct m the face, which r- ¿eaied to be gizing on heav en, with the consciousness of having obtained a prayei for me Since my sister's dieams, it seemed as if I knew ι mothei's care, and I often sighed, to thmk, that though thus thoughtful of me even in heaven, she did not think mc woi¬ thy of enjoying hei smile One morning I left iny sister, and îe- tned to the wild bouleis of the Bnentz lake.

Theie is а point which juts into the lake, and on it aie the ι inns of an old chinch , I did not feel inclined to exert myself to letch a moie distant spot, hut I laid myself down by an .itching gateway, iound which the ivy clusteied, as if by its tenacious giasp, it w onici hold togethei themoininientsof anothei ige, upon winch the bieath of time was acting with α de¬ structive powei, unheeded by man. í seemed to feel this bieath of time acting upon me as upon these woiks of mm, the wild joys of j outh seemed stink into the melanchol) uiiifoim feeling attendant upon age, when all jov is passed, all hope extinguished by the consciousness ot the presence of death.

other side of the lake, if I thought myself safer there. Unconscious of what I was doing, I entered hei boat, and taking the oars, tried by л ïolent exertions to louse myself, we did not speak, when upon the othei side, I landed Farewell fell fiom hei lips, and it seemed as if the echoes mocking me, ıepeated farewell I stood still, witching hei as entering the cunent of the An, she was giaduilly boine down tow uds Interlaken, even when she hid passed the budge, I gazed, and seem¬ ed to see ι white speck, that I imagined «as hei I tinn"d "«"¿, anu towaids evening loi nd myself upon the same spot on which I oad fiist seen hei Again, she had ap¬ peared At fii st, she had guided me into the path of honour, this day she ensuied my safety Was she then a vision ?

wheie my protectoi had appeared, was se¬ cure, I laid me down beneath the lock, that had witnessed hei presence, and of¬ fering up a piayei to heaven, I gave way to all the usions my imagination offeied She had recognised me, she knew ray name, my iánk, and still felt an interest in my s iftty If you have evei known, what it is to be in love, you miy judge what my feelings were, if not, mj woids aie useless, I haidlv slept the whole night Next diy Ι ι oamed ι estless ovei the Alpine heights 11 ound, I did not heed the horrors 01 the beauties of these solitudes The cataiact fell by my side, and yet I heard it not, wherever the valley wound, thither I followed , bnt as evening thiew its s b Uness ovei natui e, ere the light cano py of heaven was daikened, I found mj self upon the coveied bridge of Interla¬ ken, I had forgotten my dangei The open spaces between the beams support mg the roof, enabled me to see the dif

lt then tell upon her father, if I had only felt its cheering influence without that burning passion it has excitru m this breast, but I must not anticipate my nar¬ ration The sun sunk behind the moun¬ tains, she carefully shielded her sire from the damp I watched her retiring steps, heard the dooi close aftei her, and at last turned away Intending to depart again to some ıetlred spot, I was advancing, when I perceived that there was some one at the end of the bridge apparently watcb ng me, and then retiring as if to look up the road Alarmed, I seized my hunting knife and approached him seeing me advance, he came towards me, it was the seivant of Berchtold He had seen ine from a neighbouiing height, and an* xious, as he said, for my safety, had im¬ mediately followed me, and finding me on the budge, had several times spoken to me without my paying the least attention, perceiving at last how I was engaged ·
contemplating the beautiful object before ine, he had contented himself witli guard¬ ing the entrance to the bridge I en¬ quired about the French soldiers, he turned pale, but at that moment I haidly noticed it, he told me tint they had been watching Beichtold's house dunng the whole of the mght, appaiently awaie of my being in the habit of going there every evening He informed me that there were only two lemainmg, whom he had supplied so abundantly with wine, that if I chose to ventine towaids the cottage, he would inform Beiehtold and my sısteı where they could meet ine, while he engaged the attention of my pursueis How easilv I was deceived, I have since known the value of men's professions, then I was young and confi¬ dent in v u tue Berchtold and my sister met me, but there were other soldiers in the neighbouihood, those the seivant led to a piss by which 1 must descend on my return It was but anothei nista.nce
of that venal boasted honour which во much stains the Swiss patriotic history In the mean time I learnt from Berch¬ told that he hid walked to Berne, hoping to cause my sentence of outlawry to be cancelled, that the French employers had lulled him with hope until ne had been lash enough to acknowledge my being in this neighbourhood, when they would listen to him no longer, but sent the sol. diers I have mentioned Even Ochs, who had formerly beep his school fellow, had laughed when he reproached him for so vde a breach of confidence I spoke with my sister apart, and infoimed hei of my discovery, she was sui prised, and seemed downcast, but Berchtold, who had gone to listen, and lepoited all silent, joining us, we could not proceed in oui conversa¬ tion I embraced them, and had begun to descend the steep, when I heard myself challenged, having my gun with me, I finca, and the challenger fell, but one leapt upon my back, it was my own ser-
vant, and I was surrounded. I struck upon every side, but it was in vam de¬ termined, however, to be revenged, I threw myself upon the ground with the traitor ; as we turned, I succeeded m getting him undeimost, and plunged my hunting-knife up to the hilt in his chest. He groaned and died. I surrendered. I was hurried to Interlaken, put mto a boat, and before the dawn of day, was locked in the pnsons of Thun I ex¬ pected to be immediately taken out and shot. I was not, howevei, disturbed till night, when I was awakened from a sound sleep, and, guai ded by a company of sold.ers, was ordeied to be conveyed to the castle of Chillón, upon the lake or Geneva Entering into conversation with the soldiei who maiched by my side, I heard from him that Berchtold and my sister had in vain applied for admis¬ sion to my dungeon, upon hearing of my misfortune, that the íeason I was re¬ moved at this late hour arose from the
magistrate's fearing a rescue by the peo¬ ple, who once or twice in the day had seemed, bj their tumultuous meeting, incbned to force the prison of him whom they called their only lemaipmg patnot. From him I first learnt that my name was in eveiy mouth , that there were romantic tales printed about me, and spread over all the country m spite of the police which endeavoured so suppress them. I did not feel any vam exultation at this, I was too near death, but I certainly expeuenced some satisfaction in the thought, that for Louisa,—that—that was hei name Гог years locked up within my breast, it has not passed my lips I have not daied to utter tli it name, not even whisper it to my own eai, but it has been deeply en¬ graven here It is now a spell that con¬ jures up hoi rid thoughts, once it did not. But 1 must command myself. I had not visited this pait of Switzeiland yet, though beautiful, and pei haps richer than any I had seeD, it passed unobserved
before my eyes. The simple villagers, hearing my name, came round the inns at which we stopped, and looked upon me in silence. Mothers brought their chil¬ dren to me to kiss; as if my kiss could call down a blessing* or inspire heroism. I crossed the Dent de Jamanu, and soon saw the castle once the prison of Bonni- va, now destined to be my own. The draw-bridge was up, and the sen¬ tinels were parading as if they esteemed the castle of importance. Upon my name being mentioned the bridge was lowered, and I soon heard the clash of the chains employed in raising it after me. It seemed to be accompanied by a voice that bade hope to leave me. The rude stare of the soldiers, and the bustling scene of the officers, running to and fro, did not tend to relieve the sorrow that weighed upon me. I had dared dan¬ ger in the chase upon the Alps j death in battle ; yet. here the i joughts of leav¬ ing all, oppressed me. I did not think of B 3
the pam of paitmg with existence , but Berchtold, шу sister, the vision of the Wengern Alp, all seemed to press upon iny imagination with eyes, that, by their look, seemed to denote a breaking heart. My head fell upon my breast, yvhde, with folded arms, I walked along the vaulted passage. I was seaiched, all wis taken from me, my knife, the little money I had. Ihe iude jailor already had his hand upon the scarf, retainnnng it with a firm grasp, I looked at him, and see¬ ing his daughtei close by his side, — " if that child, I said, should be fai — fai from thee, and thou couldst not hope to see hei but in heaven, couldst thou part with the only ielle of her memory '" He looked upon his child, and let go his hold. I was taken into a loom wheie seveial officeis were deliberating concerning me. I had stood before them sometime, when one asked me my name. " Ernestus Berch¬ told" was my answer. "Itisthetiaitor,"
fell fiom the lips of one. I looked upon him ; he could not stand my glance, but sunk into silence. They weie consider» ing whether they should lead me to in¬ stant execution, or whethei I should be confined till the pleasure of the govern- ment at Beine should be known, as it was thought that they might wish to make a more public exhibition of the punish¬ ment of him they so giatuitously called л tiaitoi. I was respited by one voice, and was instantly ordered to my dungeon To descend into th»> puson, which is below the level of the water, it is neces¬ saiy to go down а nai low cu cular stau¬ case. While descending it, we were stop¬ ped by that child upon whom I had rest¬ ed my appeal to the jailoi, to pass her we weie obliged to go singly, when I came close to hei, I felt something piess¬ ed into my hand, while at the same tune she made ι sign with hei finger foi silence. I put her piesent into my bieast and fol¬ lowed her fithei, who was befoie me, E 4
while the others were at my back, i entered a long vault, its flooi was the solid rock, and its high roof was suppoit¬ ed by seven thick massy pillars. The waves of the lake dashed sullenly igainst the walls above my head, and the feeble light that pierced the high windows only showed me the damp black sides of this puson. there were the steps of α pnso¬ ner marked during a long impiisonment upon the veiy lock, 1 still heaid the noise of bolts, but did not heed it, till I arrived at a nanow cell, partitioned oft from the greatei dungeon, which I had not peiceived in the geneial obscuiity. Into this narrow space I was foiced to entei. It vv as not sufficiently long foi me to he down at full length, ant' the baned giating, which, far above my íeach, was intended m mockciy to îepiesent a win¬ dow, ıeceıved ııo reflected light from the dark floor of Bomm a's pnson. I heard the doois fastened one after anothei Beneath the slowly sounding wave I
was cut oft fiom humanity, the mono- tonous dashing against the castle's base »lonebioke the diead silence , it seemed like the loud note of the moments in nature's last hour My spints fled, and I leant against the stone» to which I was chimed, with hinds clasped ind my eyes ρ unf ully stiain ng, as if they sought at le ist to see the real horrors of my dwellm 0 JTitigued by my long jouiney ovei the stup Junaili, 1 sought to sit and sleep but tht damp flooi foi a long time kept my lacking mind awake to all the toi ments of thought, w hile it hoped for a momentai ) oblivion of woe At last I sunk into i epose, and it was not until lite the next moining that I awoke, but I aw oke refreshed, I had seen the constant ittendant upon my dreams, and I soon lost mvself m thought upon her vanous appearances The waves above me seemed silenced to а calm, and the sun's poweiful mendian riy leflected upon the various sides of. E 5
tlie greater vault, penetiated, though in a feeble glimmer, my sohtaiy cell. Gra¬ dually stealing upon my eai, I heard a distant voice, winch m melancholy notes seemed to sympathize w ith my sorrows. I listened, it appioached, the mea¬ sured stiokes of an oai inteiiupted the heavenly stiain , suddenly bieakmg into bveher notes it sung of hope , the voice was, they were Itilian woids, it was my vision's voice It giadually sunk away into indistinct sounds I seemed anothei being, hope bieathed upon mj heait, and Louisa woie the semblance of that enchantei, oh that I had died, that she had left me to m) self to die ' it was not the will of heaven. Again I heaid the splashing sound of the oar, and again that voice sounded on my ear, it was no lon¬ ger the thrilling notes of an an, but in slow recitative it bade me hope, it told me that a boat should be stationed at two or three stone throws distance from the castle, íeady at all times to receive me if
1 could manage to get out, and that in the mean tune endeavouis were making at Berne, to gam a ι epeal of the sentence passed upon me. Again the song of hope sounded m m) cell, losing itself gradually in the distance, it at last left me with no¬ thing human within hearing. 1 now lemembered the child's piesent, feeling m my bieast, it proved to'be a file and a knife, I instantly began to work at the wall, dividing me fiom the gieat dungeon , while thus busily employed I heaid the bolts of the vault withdrawn ; my jailoi entered, he spoke not, but threw me my pittance of bread, and laid down my pitcher of watei. Haidly Was he gone, when I resumed my Woik, the dampness of my cell aided me. The moitai was soft, and the wall built of small stones, when theiefore I had scrap¬ ed the moitar away fiom the cievices, I did not find any difficulty in foicmg them out. One by one I toi e away many, and I had aheady almost pierced the wall,
when, fearful of penetrating entuely thiough, lest the jailoi might next day detect my attempt, I managed to replace most of the rubbish m its situation, and to push the lest mto a cornei I now be¬ gan with my file to cut the chain that sur- l ounded my waist. Thejadoi came next moinmg, and told me, that at the dawn of the ensuing day I was to be conveyed to Beine. Tins gave me additional strength, the hopes of liberty, of seeing Louisa, spuned me on, and in a few moments I was free fiom my chains. With what impatience 1 waited for the night. It came, I forced a passage through the wall, and I found myself in the gieat vault without a manacle. The moon's lay seemed with a smile to seek the giound on which 1 tiod, foi its cold beams pierced the grated apertures above, and dlummed some dieaiy spots. I yvas not yet free, the window was high above my íeach ; but I did not despair, taking the whole length of the dungeon to give me
power, I leapt, and caught with my hands at one of the bai s 11 aised myself, and resting my knee upon the shelving sill, I iininedi itely began to employ my file, and the nisty bai s soon gave vv iy to my aim. I paused a moment, the tool iiesh an of the night, no longei poisontd by the noxious vapoutsof the subteiitneui dun¬ geon, pi vyid imidst my Inn , I »eemed to inhale hie The moon's ι ay decked with one glutei mg streik of light the whole bieaihh of the wide I d e , it seemed the path of hopt Not fu dist ıııt was а buge, in thittoi loin houis my muidei- ers would be tt my pnson door The giound wis coveied with snow even to the w uu's edge , I leapt into the lake, and beuif, α good swmimei I reached the boat numbed by the cold, I had haidly the stiength to ι aise myself into it Theie was no one to be found, there weie some coaise piovisions, a peasant's habit, and а lettéi , it had no direction, " if safe," it said, " proceed to Milan, you wdl hear

was bloken by the sound of voices chaunt¬ ing, whicli, stealing down the mountain, sunk upon the wave. Aht med I knew not why, I lushed up the path, befoie the chuich poich, aiound the gieat cioss that stood upon the green swaid, knelt Beich- told's pausluoneis aira) cd in white. Thougn the red glaie of tlie pmc toich fell upon then faces, it did not allow me to distinguish anj one Bieathless I stood incapable of motion The chaunt ended, the mimstei of peace ai-ose, it was not Beiehtold, he's dead, I cued, and rushed foiward, alaimed, the peasants rose, they lecogni/edmc and weie silent, my sısteı took my hand anil baile me piay foi him who had died. Inc .pable of any longer beating the anxiety attendant upon my f ite, I knew not what 1 did, I knelt, I heaid the solemn chaunt sing Beichtold's requiem, and could not join it. The earth closed ovei him, and tlie mimstei led me to my foimei home. I was inconsolable, they talked to me 9
of ensuring my safety, I was deaf to theiï remonstrances, and only listened to gnef; my sister was ¡eft alone with me. She wept with me, and ere it was daw n, had peisuaded me to depait She told me that Louisa hid been with hei, had made liei pi omise to join liei, in case of Beich¬ told's death, so that I need not be undei any anxiety on hei iccount. Shemfoimed me tint Louisi had walked with hei ovei my haunts, hid enquiietl altei eveiy mi¬ nutest en cumstance about me. My sısteı said, she thought she loved me. I could listen to no more, embracing hei, I issued forth, visited my mothei's and Berchtold's grave, and soon lost sight of Beatenberg. Louisa loved me ' it was too ti ue, if that love had fallen upon any one else it would have proved a blessing. On me ; you see my withered lineaments, my sun¬ ken eye, my feeble step, think you, a com¬ mon cui se could thus blast the bloom of life? Beiehtold was but the first victim to my love. My love has left me, a scat-
tei ed pine amidst this desolate scene, but first it has destioyed all who weie bound to me, my love has pioved,—but I must presei ve my stiength,— I have hoi rors to ıelate, —going thiough the S mplon, then a road only passable by mules 01 on foot, I soon arnved at Milan. I was m safety, the city was in posses¬ sion of the Austnaiis. I had haidly rest¬ ed at the inn, at whicli I took up my abode and was making enquiries, in hopes ot discoveung the Doms, when Obvien en¬ teied We flew into one anothei's aims, he answei cd none of my enqiuues, but leading me to lus caniage, we ainved tinougli the coiso at a palace close to the т -ates. Wo got out, I knew not whithei he was leiding ine, the doois of the saloon wei e thrown open, and I found myself in the piescnce of his fathei, his sısteı. The old man advanced, and takmg my hand, which hung by my side, he thanked me foi having twice saved the life of his son. I knew not what to say ; conscious I owed
my life to Louisa's interference, I could not find woids to thank her The father at last led me tow irds his diughtei, and bade hei ittempt to thank me Hei eyes turned upon me, suffused with blushes she had some words upon her lips, when I forced niy self to stop her " Do not mock me, what do I owe to you ? my life is no¬ thing, when compaied to that thiistof honour,) ou inspired in my bi eist " \gain, she blushed and was silent At that mo¬ ment, anothei carnage ai nved, it was my sister attended by two futhful domestics of my fnend , locked m my arms, she was at last taken thence to be clasped in those of my preservei Aftei taking some refreshment, the fa ther led me into another 100m, he there told me that Beichtold's last request was, that he should supply his phce and take my sısteı md myself to him, as his clu! dren As he spoke, he showed me it the same time, the last lines which my foster fathei had written a few moments befoie-
he died. They contained our histoiy as far as he was acquainted with it, in them he bade me trust always in God, and re¬ commended me to bow undei that dispen¬ sation, w Inch had made me an outcast on my native soil, and not to munnui at the will of him, who had depnved me of the feeble support a Swiss pastoi could afford against the pressme of events, since he had ι aised me up а piotector, so much moie poweiful in the father of him whose life I had saved. Doni took me by the hand, and perceiving the tear tiembhng in my eye, he begged of me to let him supply the place of Berchtold. He called me son, Louisa's father could not call me so in vam, I fell upon his neck, but could not speak.
PART SECOND.
You have visited our alpine scenes and have undoubtedly been witness to the appioath of one of those dieadful visi¬ tations of angry nature, w Inch sometimes occui in the pent up valleys. Ihe black speck gathers upon the mountain's blow ; amidst the silence and dead stillness of the an, it seems as if all were ìesting, in hopes of gaining strength to lesist the desolating fury of the powei s let loose against them. Only the lowingof thecattle, which, with its hollow lengthened sound, seems to give unheeded notice of the
diead stoim's appioach, echoes upon the air, awed by the very stillness. Yet the sun slimes brilliantly on the scene, doubled in the unnppled suiface of the lake that seems proudly to beai the beauteous image, as if it were conscious how soon that smiling scene would be changed. — So passed the years, in which day suc¬ ceeded diy m unperceived succession, in which I lived under the same roof, partook innocently of the same joys and sonows as Louisa. There was yet a weight upon my heait I could not ex¬ plain , my dieams always terminated un¬ happily, and sleep, that lefuge common to all miseiy, was to me like the waking houis of otheis. Immediately after our arnval, my sısteı was visited with a threat¬ ening appeal fiom our mothei, who bade her depait with me once more to our native wilds, and never return We could not understand thedeciees of fate, lulled by the peace and appaient happiness aiound us, we weie unconscious of what
was in future,—we remained,—and Ι αιη what you see — a spectre amongst the living. Encouraged by Louisa, lagam returned to my studies All the morning engaged in the hbnry of my benefactor, I followed them under his direction, chiefly reading the modern poets and histonans, with whom I had little acquaintance Louisa woidd often come, and, sitting by my side, read the same passages, and discuss the merits of a particulai image, often directing my taste, and pointing out many beauties I had not before perceived, even in my favonte authoi s. You see those volumes, they are those we read toge¬ ther , they now form my whole librai y, but you cannot know the pleasuie theie is contained in a single one of those pages. I read them, and eveiy woid agam sounds upon my ear, as if sbe spoke it. I turn ι ound and am undeceived, Louisa is'not by my side, though her voice seems speaking as when we were innocent.
In the evening we assembled in the saloon of the palace Dom was distin¬ guished fiom his counti ymen by a state of affluence, which was apparently bound¬ less, butwhich was the moie extraoidinary m this respect, that it did not excite the envy of his neighbouis His nches in¬ deed seemed less for his own use than for that of his fnends He was of a noble family, but being the offspring of а youn¬ ger brarch, he had been eaily innured to hauls ups Disdaining the mean idle life he was obliged to lead, in subservi¬ ence to the will of a pi oud relation, he had left Milan at an early age, and had tiavelled into the Last He never, how¬ ever, spoke of his journey, and always seemed anxious to direct the conversa¬ tion into another channel, whenever it turned upon subjects in any manner con¬ nected with it He had ıetuıned rich, no one knew whence, but theie weie whis¬ perings abioad, that he had not gained his riches by commerce, though no one could
trace whei e his riches lay, yet as lus gold was poured forth with so liberal ι hand, his wealth was deemed almost infinite He had been strikingly handsome, and was extremely intelligent, but grief had weighed down his eneigies, and soirow had broken his faculties After his re turn he had mained Beauty was the mere casket, the riches were within, his wife was described as hav ing possessed a mind, that without lay nig aside all that appealing delicacy and weakness, which binds woman to man, had all those powers and accomplishments, winch un¬ fortunately in her sex have geneially been the panders to vice, but which, with her, were the handmaids to viitue Her presence was commanding, but hei v nice was peisuasive , its tones struck thr heait and produced those emotions, which all lemember, none can express, the feeling, as if we had been always virtuous, and were worthy of listening to the voice of a being supenoi to ouiselves The pooi
followed her steps, not with their usual boi«terous cry for charity, but in silence, they seemed to watch the glance of her eye, as if the sympathy which shone there, had made them even forget their ragged miseries Louisa was her coun¬ terpart, when I heard any one describing what her mother had been, it seemed that I could read the whole upon her daughter's face, and methought I could often perceive the speaker reading on the same page Doni had loved her, nay more, had adored hei, but she had married lum by the pei suasion of her parents, while her heart was engaged to another far away, he had returned, they saw one another, and fled together, Dom pursued them, fired at the carriage which was escaping and blood fell upon the road, —they did not stop Doni then entirely ost all command of himself, he fell in the road, calling for mercy and relief from that curse, which had already begun to blast him He had never recovered F
the shock, had retired from all those gaieties m which he had been once en¬ gaged, and devoted himself to the edu¬ cation of his children For their sake he had, however, again entered into so¬ ciety, but in a very different style from his formei magnificence These are the circumstances which I heard of his his¬ tory, from those fnends with whom I spoke in the course of the two first years of my stay at Milan, besides this, I also found the íeports of his supei natural pow rs to be believed and whenever I enquned concerning thein, the speaker always looked round the room, befoie he ventured to speak, and would then only answer in whispeis I have mentioned our evening assembly jn the saloon of the palace, thither alf dis¬ tinguished by rank 01 science came—.all visitors were alike welcome There, no ceremony, which is but the vain pointing of selfishness to its sacrifices, incommoded those, who, invited by the society they
found there, chose to take a chair m this circle Louisa's father always held the reins of conversation m his own hands, and instead of letting it fall upon the common place subjects of fashion, he turned the minds of his company to dis¬ quisitions that gave to each an opportu¬ nity of showing his information 01 judge¬ ment At times, the existence and pow¬ ers of the Deity were canvassed, — at times, the reality of beings intermediate between God and man, their qualities, and the facts related conceinmg them, came undei consideration Other evenings heard discussions upon the nature of vir¬ tue, whether it íeally were definite and felt, as is beauty, in every breast, or whether it weie not merely an object of policy and self convenience The father and son generally took opposite sides, and under one or theother, each individual of the company enlisted himself, accord¬ ingly as it happened that he were either in a humour to be pleased with the ge- F 2
aerai dispensation of providence thiough- out the day to himself, or was smaitmg under what he conceived to be an unde served infliction of the evil spirit Olivieri madeit a pomtrobewilder every one He was a little oidei than myself, his head, though not perfect, had much beauty, a fine foiehead, black hair, a dark, though small ey e, united to a Gre ciancontoui, formed, if not a pleasi g, a striking physiognomy I soon found that he had rpad much His body also had been exeicised , though not giacetul, he was active, and hardly any excelletl him m а tertam quickness of ad ipfation, both of mmd and body to any thing i e quired Hi» opinions weie pai idoMcal and singular In religion he outwardly professed С itliolici=m, and stiongly op posed those scnbbling philosopheis, who by satcasm, attempt to oieiturn the reli gion of ages, though at the same tune he allowed the absuidit) and falsehood of the prevailing doctrines This did not appear
to ause f' om а spuit of ojiposition, but, if the uiotives he gave weie tine, fiom а chain of thought that did honoui to his heait, not heul He assei ted that Ca¬ tholicism was the only religion affording to the pooi md to the sick of heart, a balm foi their evils Calvinism, deism and atheism, weie by him called the profes¬ sions of the noitl.ein nations, cold as then native locks. Piolessions to which .enthusiasm, and the feehng of a ceitain lefuge, so hent soothing m Catholicism, viete unknown. He mnntained that it was not foi individuals, who had the ad. vantage of education and imagination, to slteltei them fiom the ovei Whelming foice of mental nusenes, and unlooked foi mifoitunes, to attempt under a leal, though vam pietence of the love of tiuth, to depnve the pooi and uneducated mil¬ lions forming the mass of mankind, of the consolation always offeied by this reh. gion, which instead of shunning the poor, gladly seeks theu miseiable hovel, in the г 3
hope of admmistenng present comfort and futui e hope Indeed he was inconsistent in his pnnciples He had not mingled much in gereni life, but while at Padua, wheie he had been sent to study, he had sought the icquamtance of all Fiom the knowledge of mar he had there ac¬ quired, whether it were that he had con¬ stantly met with mean and weak compa¬ nions, 01 that conscious of his own bad qualities, he had thence estimated the va¬ lue of man's professions, he always seem¬ ed to ι lew the human chai acter in a darker hue than ν as warranted by truth, and to have formed his mind into ι general con¬ tempt foi mankindas a mass, andadetermi- natıon,ıf evei an occasion offered, of using at their expence, consideung them but as tools to work with His manners were at first always engaging, and rather pleas¬ ing, but this seemed irksome to him, and he gave way to an imperious, assuming air in conversation, which soon disgusted his fnends. His ideas "£ a hfe after death
seemed stiangely childish, he did not be¬ lieve in an iramoitality, yet he had „o strong a love of fame, that theie was no reputation be did not covet He sometimes formed visions of α thionc raised upon the blood of his countrymen spilt m cıvıl war ; at times, of the fame of a benefactor to debtors and galley slives He sought at the same time foi the applause ofthe philoso¬ phers and the drunkard, the divine, and thelıbeıtıne. Things, of which, evenatthe moment of action he was ashamed, were often done by hnn in the view of proving himself capable of excelling even m vice. It was hard to say, whether he owed a certam frankness and easiness of attach¬ ment, to his weakness, qi to seeds sown in his bieast by nature. But whether it were fiom hisincapabihty of constantly ictmgup to his system, or to the overpowei ing foi ce of nature, it was strange to heai him ex¬ press himself a followei ofa doctune that has proved the leech of human blood, and at the same time refuse to tread upon a ι 4
worm. The evil was, his riches induced the young to pander for him, the old to flatter him, on account of his specious talents and handsome appearance He was a študent, a gambler, and a libeitme. This man became my companion, his father ofttn pointed me out to him, as the model foi hi» conduct, and when he had to reproach lum foi the losses at the Ri¬ dotto, or when Obvien sought an excuse in the plea of youth, for the ruin his libertinism had brought on many fa¬ milies, he would speak of me as an example of strength, resisting all the temptations of vice. I was a ι eed when the storm came, Olivieri had watched me at the meetings in the saloon, 1 was gene¬ rally a mere listener, but my curiosity was ahve, though silent, my mmd had an in¬ satiable thirst for knowledge I was a catholic, Berchtold had educated me in doctnnes, without teaching me the foun¬ dation upon which they weie built, he thought it impiety to question them.
The conversation to which I was now pre¬ sent, seemed to re¡>t upon the «mtire con¬ viction, that all 1 believed was false Yet this was not satisfactory I heard argu¬ ments idduced in suppoit of one assertion which seemed inesistible , but whit was my suipnse, on anothei evening to hear the sime peısoıı adduce moie than plau¬ sibilities in favouı of the eontiary hypo¬ thesis I at last was Lewildcied, I was unwilling to believe the human mmd in¬ capable of truth, the moie I examined, the moie difficulty I found in the a tavn- ment of it I heai d the deist and theatheist contend , following but one of the chains of aıguınent I was com inced, looking at them together, I saw the lustie of tiuth equally on both, I knew pot which to choose I was a sceptic in fact, not in name Night after night upon my sleep¬ less couch, I cahed upon the God, whose existence I doubted, to visit me, as if God heeded the belief of an individual, as if the happiness of an infinite being like P î
him depended on a man's faith m his existence Obvien perceived the state of my mind, I asked his assistance, he laugh¬ ed at my attempt it knowledge, ind be wildei ed me still moi e , I wis ι estless, md seemed at length to be depi ived of ill mo tive foi iction Ν ι supei ιοί being to smile upon oui eftorts, to whom we may show ou gntitude, ind whose app obation we may obtain, no virtue, but artificial tiam- mels set up under its name, to lure the unwaiy into the toils of *he wittiest knav с I wished I had nevei left those mountains, amidst which, I had thought, I felt the breath ofa supenor being, though he was clothed by my imagination in tei rors Nothmg above man, and that man the sport of chance, of his ow η caprice. Yet withm my breast it seemed as if aspirings dwelt which seemed to have been born with me Were they but a mockery ? I grew melancholy, whole days con* - d to my room, I meditated till my bram became a wilderness of vanous thoughts so er-
tangled I knew not how to extricate myself My sister, fearing I v/as ill, would often sit by me, would bring Louisa, and they would togethei listen to my doubts Julia seemed to be as mueh affected by them as myself, she listened with avidity, and echoed my own ideas Not so Louisa, she talked of ïevelation, of ι beneficent Deity, who had for a while left man in ignorance, to pi ove to lum lu» ov, ι weakness, but had at last levelled himself, and announced ι better state Ή hile she spoke, she seem ed like the fiist vision of the Wengein Alp destined again to save me, and set me fiee from these bevvildeiings, the fiist step to waids vice She soothed my mind, hci lips quelled loubt into the peaceful cei tainty attendant upon Christianity I no more paid any attention to the conversa tion of tlie evening, but set myself down by Louisa, md listened to her, while she was engaged in some woik, which, though it employs the hands, leaves the roind at г б
liberty I sat by her, ask.ng for some en and, some office, in doing which I might do hei bidding, she was evidently giatified by my attentions, she would blush at my approach and smile, she would make room foi me by her side O' teiinmes I gazed in silence upon hei, and often our eyes met Hei bi eath at mo¬ ments played upon my cheek, and some times hei hand by accident touched mine. She would bid me read poetry to her, and often love was the subject of the poet's lay, my voice trembled, I dared rot look upon her, for fear she should peiceive the emotion upon my face I loved hei, but it was not a common love I did not rest upon the hope of gaining her, she appeal¬ ed a being supenoi to myself, of whom I was unworthy, yet it seemed, as if her smde were necessary to induce me to exert myself, and was a reward sufficient for the greatest deeds She would sing to me, she would waïk with me m the gar¬ den, but you must imagine, I cannot
pamt the charm, the magic, m her con¬ versation. 1 have not described her per¬ son, for I could not, her mind was more heavenly than her eye, its expressions move delicately varying than the bloom on hei cheek , there wis meekness atten¬ dant upon power, softness upon stiength. If she had not left me for а moment, I might have been spaied much guilt; but the sickness of а neai relation was a call she could not resist. I had often followed hei, when masked, she attended upon the sick m the hospitals. It is an Italian custom often have I, disguised in the covenng gown ot the Misencoulia, stood by hei, whom it was impossible not to re¬ cognize. The dying called foi hei, though they knew her not ; they soon distin¬ guished her poweiful tones which pierced thiough the bond of grief aiound the most withered heart, and poured upon it those precious consolations afforded by hei religion. Her manner, her voice, her gestures, seemed at such moments to be
those ofa being who vvas conscious of the tiuth of what it announced, not from the testimony of man, but from hiving wit¬ nessed the presence of the veiy Deity. The loud gioan, the stilled sigh, were siknced in her piesence, pain seemed to have no powei , conscience no sting She left me to visit her íelation For some days I felt lost, I knew not to whom to apply, my s-ster seemed al¬ ways occupied, she spoke with me, but I was sorry to find she had imbibed those doctrines so easily eiadicated, as I thought, from my own mind. I observed Obvien paid hei particular attention, and often conversed with her. He at last perceived hovv restless I was, he seized the oppoitumty, determined to gam an object, which I did not thmk lum capable of attempting During my stay at Milan, I had hardly ever been out in the even- ing, foi, as it is not customaiy foi unmar¬ ried females to go into society, I should have lost the pleasuie of sitting by Louisa Now I had no inducement to
ι emain at home. Oliviei ι pei suaded me to accompany him to the theatie of La Scala. I was induced by the splendoui of the sce¬ nery, the beautiful danceis, the exquisite singing, to return. I was led into the boxes of oui fnentls, and behind the scenes. I found my companion wasevery wherewell ıeceıved. The danceis and actiesses ciovvded aiound him : then conveisation was lively and various. Giadually, the fieedom in their discouise, which had at fiist disgusted me, giew indifferent, then pleasing by the wit sometimes shown even upon such subjects. One of these women, to whom Olivieri introduced me, wasamis- tre«s in her ait, and well undeistood the aitifices by which the young and unwary aie misled: she was beautiful, and though hei eye was nevei free from a ceitam look of confidence, the chaiacter- ıstıc of this class, she could soften its exprission, and cause it, in the presence of him she intended to inveigle, to send forth such glances as it was impossible to
ıesıst By Ohvien's desne she ittached herself to me, and I gi ulually took pie ι suie in hei comp iny, I saw hei neglect the attentions of the fiist nobles in Mil in to gain mine, in the midst of the ı iptu rous applause of the whole the itic, she would turn hei eye upon me to see if I appioved , she seemed to siciihcc heiself forme When the opei i w is ovci, she would take my aim and ltul me to the saloon of the theatre, where all were en gaged in gambling Sitting at a window, she diew me into conveisation, gt ulually she approached the table, we at fust stood meiely as spectators, at last she tempted me to tiy my foitune I con sented, laid down my stake, it was soon increised to an enormous amount, for I was successful I thiew it into her lap, and we pal ted For seveial nights I was equally foi tunate, but at length I lost I was so piofusely supplied with money by the kind friend who called me son, that I did not at first heed my losses
I h id given ill I guned to the syien, who still ııı ged me on I lost every banc I hid She then supplied me, I was ishimed to take it of hci, though it was wlnt I myself hid guned, but I hoped my luck would change, I lost the whole. She then begin to exert her more baneful poweis, she led me fiom folly to vice, in seaich of what she issured me wis an an¬ tidote to memory, I joined the hbeitine and the desperate I was ashamed of letting Doni know th it he, whom he had pointed out as я model of vutue to his son, had sunk into the lowest debauchery Louisa s imiğe often — often was before me, but how dai e I name hei m con¬ junction with my vices She had ^hiice been ι ministeung angel, guiding my steps but then I was innocent I daied not now iest upon the thought, and often I thiew myself deepei into the sinks of vice, in hopes that such reflections would not puısue me thithei The syien, instigited by Olivieri, led
me into every excess, while he plied me igam with insinuations against chgion and sneers upon my ciedulous conscience that pictui ed a future state I wis now glad to seek lefuge m uibelief, and 1 stiove to lose myself in those thoughts which I had before fled, and from which I had been saved by my piotecting ingel He also excited me to gamble, lent me money himself when I had none, md gathered round me every incentive to vice He had been mortified at his father's holding me up as a pattéin of strength against temptation, he was re¬ venged, he exposed my weakness I had haidly iesisted the hist approaches of vice, and had, in а shoit time, sunk below the lowest frequenteis of its haunts One night I was despeiate, eveiythmg of value that I had was gone Olivieri himself had been unsuccessful, ind I knew not where to seek for the money I wanted to satisfy ray créditais I rushed out fiom the house, and found myself m
the Piazzi del Duomo. My biain was hot, my lun disi e\ elled, 1 1 »shed along, nol knot' ing wlnt I wa» about. I knew no wheie to applj. To destioy at one Dom's opinion of my vutue by tellir^ him my situation, seemed woi se than my piesent feeling. I stood still holding my head with my hand, I lifted my eyes fiom the giound on which they had been fixed. It was night, there was no light save fiom the glimmering stars and the newly risen moon, upon the dark canopy of heaven. The white façade of the Duomo raised its huge mass in contrast with the night, shining even upon its dark veil, it seemed to awe the mind by its indistinct miss, which, weighing on the eai th, foi ced itself upon the eye when all else was lost in the shading darkness. AU was still and sunk to rest, I alone seemed waking midst sleep , in anguish, midst repose. I stood, 1 know not why, for some time gazing upon the maible statues and forms which gained a certain
chai m from the moon's silvei mg light. The mats, spread lik,, a cin tain before the doors, being ι aised by the d)ing bieeze, stiuck with a measured impulse the wall. unconsciously I entered S tve wheie the light of the moon fell upon the heavy columns, lestingthem withthefimthues of the colouied glass that adornen the windows, it was all daikness that seemed sensible to the touch. I walked towaids the high altar. Thei e is a subterranean cha¬ pel dedicated to St. Bonomeo, which re¬ ceiv es its light thiough the flooring of the dome. The silv er lamps, hung over the shnne, sent up a column of light to the very roof. I descended the stairs, and found myself withm the chapel. Ihe lamps wei e almost failing, and the »llvei walls daikened by the toich of the devotees absoıbed the little light they emitted. I appioached the shnne , the dııed coipse of the saint, anayed in his pontificals, seemed, by its repose, to invite me to seek peace where he possessed it. His eyt,
which once might also have known anguish, vv as now sunk in the socket, and presented but a mass of blackened mould m the coi net of its foimei throne I gazed upon it until I thouglit I saw it move, methought theie was a smile upon its lips, as if it mocked my thoughts of peace 1 1 epose with him, a benefactor to the pooi, a saint' A1 lugh was almost play¬ ing upon my lips, when the woids, half stifled with emotion, " intercede my pa tron, intei cede f or Bei chtold," sounded on my eai —I tuined, a female figuie, I had not obseived, was kneeling neai the vvallineainestpiayer lappioached, "who pra) s foi Berchtold ? y oui player ıs mock¬ ed ' Alai med, she ı aised her head, it was —you know whom I would say — it was Louisa She looked upon my face con vulsed with the violence of my emotions, upon my dishevelled hair — " Is it you ? Einestus," she said, using, " are you come to pray, heaven has then heard even me, and has not left you Break not my heait " I could not utter moie
She took my arm, we passed thiough the long nave, I dared not look around, methought some other form would burst upon my eyes in spite of the ending darkness, and blast me. A cai nage was waiting at a little distance, she had left the gay dance to priy foi me I had handed her into her carnage, and was going, "Berchtold, shesaid, will you leave me?" She wished me, the wietch, to be still near hei. I jumped into the can ìage, and blessed the darkness that hid my face; we spoke no more. Eveiy one had retired at Dom's. She took my hand w hen leaving me, and pressing it in her's, whilst she gazed upon my face , she bade me think — she would have said more, a tear fell f ι om her unwilling ey e, and she hastily turned away. I returned to my loom, I had not en¬ tered it for many days. Louisa knew my guilt, sleep would not refresh me, my thoughts revelled in a maddening breast. Whither could I turn foriefuge from theu
power ? Religion I had cast from me, as a foul fiend's mock , Louisa ' rest upon punty, Idarednot, then my native moun¬ tains rushed upon my sight, I seemed boundingalongthe ci ags, Berchtold smiled upon my innocence, I laughed aloud—in¬ nocence ? it was but the want of tempta¬ tion I threw myself upon my bed, and though not asleep, Ibecame so stupified by the veiy excess of pain, that even the phantoms of conscience no longei passed with distinctness before me. The night seemed to hang suspended over my head, as if in pity it would hide me fiom the day, so slow was its piogress, moinmg at last returned, but with it were the same thoughts as had visited me duung the night It was hardly day before I heard some one at my dooi, I opened it, it was Doni. I turned away my head ashamed to look upon him, he did not reproach me, telling me that he knew my present way of life needed a more abundant supply of money,
than he had given ще, he bade me to ap¬ ply to him for any sum I wanted I could not speak, I had expected he would have attempted to show me my vices in all their native hori οι , he piessed Ins offei upon me, ashamed to tell him the whole amount of m) folly, I at last named α sum not half sufficient to sitisfy my creditors, but I thought it would stop the mouths of the most clamorous, and that m tlie mean time, by economizing my allow¬ ance, I might cleai the rest He asked me repeatedly, if it was the entire sum I owed, I answeied yes, he left me, and in a few minutes returned, with gold to the amountrequired, "takeit" he said, ' it is no loss to me, but y our wonted happiness I see is fled, that gi leves me Believe one who is older than youiself, Vice is not the path of happiness " I was silent I intended immediately to pay my debts as far as I could, and at once to free my self from the life of а gambler, and a libertine.
My sısteı came to see me m my room, for I was ashamed of appearing at the bieakfast table. I observed that the colour in hei cheeks was gone, that she no longer was the open-heaited girl I remembered , attributing this however to the effect of ray own folhei upon her mmd, I said nothing. She remained with m e som e time, but I no longei felt that pleasuie 1 had always known in her com¬ pany upon formei occasions. We seemed both afiaid of touching upon any thing relating to ourselves, and both evidently with mmds deeply occupied about othei important objects, talked of the most trivial circumstances. When night came, I issued forth, de¬ teimmed to pay my debts, as far as was m my power, I enteied the saloon of the theatre, there were only the banker andthe punters arrived, they had arranged every thing for the faro table, and imme¬ diately they saw me, they began talking of the various successes of the last night. о
They told me how Olivieri had regained every thing at the veiy close of the eve¬ ning. One or two gradually stepped in ; amongst them was my friend, he was in high spints, Itcok him aside, and toldhim that I was weaiy ofthis kind of life, and was determined to pay eveiy one as fai as I had itin my powei. He would not let me finish, he laughed at my intentions, and told me, that as our good luck was now retuined, it would be a folly to throw it away, that as I acknowledged myself inca¬ pable of paying the whole, it would be as well to owe a greater as a lessei sum. His companions soon perceived the sub¬ ject of oui conversation, and joined us. They all udiculed my intention, and J was persuaded to venture once more. I at first lost, but suddenly the rouleaus pouted upon me, one more stake, and I had regained even all my enormous losses, it was soon too late to retire, I almost lost all I had that morning re¬ ceived from Dom. It was now quite use-
íess to think of retreating I fell again into my former life, with moie than double eneigy I was at times surpnsed to find that great sums were paid to several of my creditois, I could not leain by whom; I imagined it was by Ohvien's father, this did not stop me. My vicissitudes were great, but I could never entirely extncate myself, so that I wasalways either lured by hope or urged by despair I need not describe to yon the progress of my other vices, debauched women, men of whom one is ashamed, and wine, are ge¬ nerally the attendants upon gambling. I could not seek the house of Doni, noi of virtue, I threw myself into every haunt of desperate characters hke myself, and learnt to boast alike of the smile of the prostitute, or of the tear of the debauch¬ ed virgin, when losing, í stupified my mind with wine, and was glad to fall from ray chair, provided memory failed with my senses Notçd cheats, and men proscri¬ bed from society for their low dissolute· о %
ness, often seized upon шу arm on the Corso,as if I were oneof their equals, andi d- =d not repel their familiarity, for I was in uieir power Once Louisa saw me in this situation, she never again rode out on the Corso , I had the maddened im¬ pudence to bow to her I at last became mad, and once, was induced to aid in de¬ priving ayoung novice of all his wealth, by means of false dice I could not howevei stand by and see his horrible despau, he bad beggared a wife and two lovely bibes I had just then been lucky, I confessed my participation to him, and gave him the whole amount of his loss, it became known, and I wis laughed at, but foi once I could withstand ridicule At the Dom palace in the mean time, the same outward appearance was pre¬ served , there weie still the same evening assemblies, but they weie less frequented, for Olivieri was almost always with me He was apparentlyafraid I should escape him, he was constantlystiflmg all thoughts 5
that irose m my breast tending towaids ι return to virtue He never left me but when I was deeply engaged in play 01 debauch, then he constantly went I know iot whither I have since found it out md that discoveiy has not been the least of those pangs my guilt has brought upon me 1 entei ed so little into society, that I heard nothing of what w »-s passrag theie I was however, one da) standing on the Coi so with 01 мен, speaking to some ladies who had diawn up then car rnge close to а shop, when the conver sation turning upon the number of fo ìeigtiers, who were moving about m con sequence of the peace which had just been concluded, a lady turning, asked me if I had seen the stiangei who excited so much the cuııosıty of allendes Upon my saymg I h id not, she began expati it mg upon Ins singular rliai ictei itsted upon his poweis of fascinition an 1 told me thit all the ladies weie in love with him I did not pay much attention to G S
this, thinking lt but the foolish prattle of a young girl. She however continued, she wondered that I had not seen him, as he was a constant attendant upon Louisa, she having engrossed the whole ot his at¬ tention, much to the mortification of all Milan. Now I was loused I let go Ohvien's arm, and wandered about alone. I dared not hope that louisa could resist one whom all seemed to admire. The whole weight of my guilt fell heavily upon my lecollection, and one after another all my vices presented themselves, arrayed against me. I did not return that day to any of my usual haunts To¬ wards evening, I found myself, fatigued with wandering, at the gate of the Dom palace. I know not what inspired me, it seemed де if I wished to gain the cer- tainty of my fate. My steps, which till how had been slow and measured, sud¬ denly quickened. I found myself at the entrance of the saloon; all was silent;
the red pui pie glaie of sunset pierced the windows. I stood foi α moment still ; asigh buist upon my ear — I entered—Louisa was sitting looking upon the setting sun. It was hei sigh. She did not turn : " Is it you, my fathei ?" I did not speak, she tuined her head, her face was pale, but я blush mantled her cheek at the sight of me ; her eyes were sunk and dim, but they bnghtened at my presence. She spoke my name, she rose, and with faul- tenng steps attempted to reach a dooi leading to her apartments. I murmured audibly, but with a stifled voice : " She flies me, she flies, she hates me '" She tuined. " Oh no: I donot, Einestus, do not believe it " She fell upon the floor; I approached, knelt by her side, but dared not touch hei. I attempted it, mý hand íetreated, theie seemed to be pollution in my touch, I dared not. The cool an played upon her face, and the chill of the marble floor gradually re¬ covered hei ; she opened her eyes ; I o i
was now near her, 1 could see the marks of a suffenng mind upon hei face, her cheek now had no colour, save th it re fleeted from the red light of the illumined west Her ti esses were disoideied ind neglected, her eyp a sunk deep in their socket, how changed from the vision of the Wengein Alp' Hei subdued voice could hardly articulate, when she again assured me with earnestness that she did not hate me, thit she foi gave me Teais flowed down my cheeks, and I did not tiy to stop them She looked upon me " lt is too late," she sud, smiling with the smile of a broken heirt, " it is too late, Berchtold, I wish that I could weep, but my eyes are dried up " The sounds of appi caching footsteps weie heard, she rose with difficulty, trembling, I offered my arm, she took it I thought she would have spumed it I could hardly support my own weight I saw her to her door, ind threw myself upon the staucase near it, but 1 soon heard
strange voices in the saloon, the thought of its being his voice, who, I had heard, was my m al, at once made me start I rose, retired for a moment to my room, and then entered The apartment was now lit up The company were in greatei numbers than I had ever seen befoie My rival, I said to my self, is then so attı active No one observed my entry, they all seemed en¬ gaged around one man It was my rival, I nevei saw so singular a figuie His bust and head were handsome, and bore the signs of strength His black hair was in ringlets, his face was pale with a blueish tint that diminished even the colour of a naturally pale eye His hands were joined with their palms turned towards the ground, his eyelids al¬ most covered his eyes, which turned upon the floor, while his head erect bore in ite geneial expression the marks of contempt He was speaking with ele¬ gance upon the fallen glories of some
sunken nation, when he had ended, and the conversation had became more gene¬ ral, he raised his eyes, and affecting surprize he seemed ashamed of having attracted so much notice, though he did not blush, for the hue of his features seemed invariable He retreated to a corner of the room, left vacant by the pressure ot the company towaids the spot he had just occupied He there bent down his head, as if abstracted m thought, but looking undei b s eye brows, he was evidently engaged m remarking the effect he had made upon the company He agam gradually got ■? circle iound him, and again was apparently carried away by the great powers of his mmd and held forth upon some subject, and then once more retreated I was tired of w-tching such acting, and looked round for my sister She was at that moment entei mg , she immediately addressed Doni, who seemed alarmed, and went out I ap¬ proached—Louisa was ill and could not appear Julia looked upon me as if she
knew ıt had been my presence which had thus affected her friend, 1 could not beai that look " Do not reproach me, I feel all the shame of my crimes " " I ıeproach you '" she answered, " You mock me, I ' it is not for one hke me to do it " She turned away, I did not under stand her, I asked her why she rested upon one like her " Oh ' do not ask me, my shame must not be spoken." The noble stranger approached, and broke off our conversation by asking after Louisa I could not stand by him, but joined some of my formei acquaintances, for though my heart was breaking, I dared not leave the loom, determined to watch minutely every action of him I fancied my rival I entered into conveisation, and forced myself to enquire about this stianger, who thus engaged the attention of all. There was a certain affectation of mys¬ tery about him, which induced all to seek hım, m hopes of penetrating the veil he α 6
threw round his actions I met with one who had known him intimately in his own country From whom I learnt several traits of his character, it appeared that this German was much distinguished amongst 1ns countrymen for his talents, —that he was generally esteemed a hater of all the vanities of the world, but that he passed many hours at his toilette, that he was deemed broken hearted from hav¬ ing been ciossed m love, but that he was incapable of feeling that passion, being wiapt in selfishness, that made him sacrifice eveiy thing around him to the whim of the moment that he was deemed irresistible, and that no woman upon whom he fixed his eye could with¬ stand the fascination of his tongue, but that he had never dared to tempt any woman, who was not of the most aban¬ doned character, that even they were nevei addiessed with boldness, but were always made to compromise themselves by some folly with him in pubhc, before he would give them the least marked sign
of attention; that in fine he was a con¬ firmed coward with women. In society he was playing oft a stiange coquetiy with the whole world, affecting to be modest and diffident, whilst hepiotruded himself into notice. He was, howevei, rich, handsome, and noble by birth, Iwa» an oiphan dependant upon chanty. He was every where received with great at¬ tention, no where with greater than in Dom's palace. Perceiving that Louisa's father did not return, I became alarmed, and anxi¬ ous to gain some information, I sought for him. He was walking with hasty steps before her door. Upon seeing me, he was turning away, but moved by my broken voice, he stopped, looked upon me, and addiessed me, "You saved my son, Berchtold, but my daughtei, my beloved daughter dies , it is,howevei,use¬ less to speak to you, leave me, go to your room, Louisa's better." Every thing seemed confused to me, I could not be¬ lieve that I was the cause of Louisa's ill-
ness, I could not believe that she could love sucS an outcast as myself. I was several times m the course of the night by her door, listening for some sound that should assure me of her existence. I fell asleep at last upon the sofa in my room, and 1 saw her in my dieam as when she first appeared befoie me, glow ing in health, buoyant with spirits, sud¬ denly I thought she ran towards me, but ere she reached me, she faded like a flower, and fell to the ground 1 awoke, all was still, but my heart beat violently. It seemed as if this were the fulfilment of my formei dreams, my vices were the evils, the warning voice of my mother commanded my sister to fly, foi they were doomed to be the death of all I loved. Morning came, my first enquiries were concerning Louisa , she was very ill, and in a state of great weakness. Dom was not yet usen, and was appa¬ rently quite overcome During the whole day, I was not one moment at iest, I
wandered from one room to another, and sent every instant to enquire con¬ cerning my protector's daughter. I stood by the door watching all who came from hei room, and begged them to tell me every change they observed. Towards evening а packet was put into my hands, it contained receipts from every one of my creditors. There was no explanatory paper. Imagining it to be the gift of Doni, I determined to thank him , I went to his room, I found him lying upon his couch very much fatigued and exhausted, he was courting repose, but it was in vain , anxiety was painted upon his face, and gnef seemed to stamp him with its chilling furrows. My first question was concerning his daughter. I then show ed him the packet, and had begun to thank him, when he interrupt¬ ed me. " Young man, thank not one, who wished that you should first have paid the price of your vices before he freed you fiom your embarrassments. I
had resisted my daughter's entreaties, till last night, she offered to give up bei al lowance, every thing, to free you, I refused, but I could not long do so, to a child I thought dying " I was thunder struck, the packet fell from my hand, 1 thought I should have fallen through shame, but he spoke again, " Would that your apparent shame wei e the least security agamst your folhe«, but I believe you to be incurable " He motioned me away, 1 fell at his feet, and called Heaven to witness that I would never again par¬ take of vicious pleasures He raised me from the ground, pressed me to his bosom, and with a blessing told me, that if I kept this promise, iie might yet be happy , he bade me leave him to his hopes, again embraced me, and I left him For the first time during the last пишу weary months, I felt something hke repose m my mmd It seemed as if the vow I had made to heaven might be relied on» and as if I again might know
the consolation of a conscience at rest. That night I slept quietly and soundly, for Louisa was announced to be much bettei, and my heait felt a little repose. It was but to give me stiength tj bear worse than I had yet endui ed Next morning Louisa saw me, she was upon the bed of sickness, but she had pirtly recovered the shock my abrupt entiy had caused hei. I shall never for¬ get the moment I enteied. I had ex¬ pected she would have ıeceıved me with maiks of horn οι , she smiled, oh, no! she did not hate me. 1 sate b) her, she allowed me to take hei thin cold hand within my own , it chilled my heart with its touch. Theie was a cleai whitenes that oveispread her face, where it was not tinged by the hectic flush, her eye shone with a glassy brilliancy that seem ed not mortal, tt was the glance of death mocking iny senses through a beauteous vizor, for there were the seeds of death sown deep in her broken heait. She
spoke but little, what she did titter, how¬ ever, were words of' kindness, and they were all her weakness allowed her to say. She often turned her brilliant eyes upon me, and the soft smile upon her lip, I thought was excited by the gentle whis¬ perings of hope, that I was snatched for ever from vice. The latter part of the morning was passed near her in a silence that was not mute, for there is a lan¬ guage which, though not addressed to the ear, still speaks the thought within. Her physician came and advised me to retire. I bade her farewell ; an anxions look accompanied the words, where are you going? but when I intimated my determination of staying at home, I can¬ not describe to you the joy expressed upon her face as she repeated my fare¬ well. I had been so little at home, that I knew nothmg of what had lately hap¬ pened. I was, therefore, much surprised, when, upon desiring a servant, towards
night, to see if Dom was in his apart ment, he lefused, saying he had not courage Upon making enquiries, I found that their mastei 's supein linai powei s had been much talkedof I itcly amongst the sei vants, for dunng the lattei days, unusual noises had been heard m his loom, and every moinmg, all his things had been found m a st mge confusion while he was apparently so ex¬ hausted, that it was evident he had had no rest during the night T! inking all this very explicable from the state of anx lety in which he had been kept, I tried to convince the servant, but lit appealed firm in his belief, and refused to cany my message Louisa seemed rapidly to recover strength As we were in the very middle of s immer it was thought pro¬ per by her physicians that she should be removed to a cooler situation than the neighbourhood of a great city We accordingly retu ed to the banks of
the Lago Maggiore The paliet close to the lake was ìefieshed by the cool¬ ing breeze that pissed over the vv iter's y ist expanse, and the pliylul foun- t uns thit spotted with their noisy showers m the ipntments towards the land, promised to shield the invalid fiom the noxio is effects of an Italian sun, while the magnificent jceneiy of the vnymg basm befoie oui view, seem¬ ed to promise lehxation to thf mind We irrived late at night, and mmedi- ately retired to our beds I aiose be¬ times, and issuing forth ascended the numerous tenaces, which, one above anothei, seemed like the woik of some enchanter When viewed fiom the wa¬ ter's edge, garden seemed to be lung nig above girdea, as if mm had ас - quii ed the powerof piling ni m e's gifts even into the air I did not heed this, for my nitive mount uns weie 11 sight, 1 did not gaze upon the neh isimdi., which seemed like fairy dwellings spi ing
mg from the lake, I gazed upon Monte Rosa,which, high above the neighbouring hills, asserted the glory of its alpine birth. Though all around seemed burnt by the sun's ray, it mocked his power and bore its unvaiying white vest, in de¬ fiance of his frown, upon its aged limbs. While yet engaged looking upon its high summit, with all the crowded images of infancy offered by my memory, my sısteı passed me. She seemed lately to have lost all her spints, she did not ap¬ peal to be ìttracted by the beautiful scene neai us, oi the sublimity of the alpine ridge beyond. She was gazing upon the ground, Ijomed hei,she started, and with а tiembhng voice asked me, "Why I was come?" I answered her, at that moment 1 saw Ohuen tuin the corner of the alley and approach, but immediately he saw me he retired, and I at the same time perceived that my sister was violently agitated. I looked at her,
and begged of her to tell me what I was to imagine, she hastily replied, "Nothing, nothing," and her colour, which had de¬ serted her at the sight of Obvien, returned with greatei lapidity than it had fled the moment before I insisted upon an ex¬ planation , she said she was unwell, weak, and made othei excuses of the same nature. I now ι emembered her agitation a few evenings before, when we were m- ínterrupted by the Count Wilhelm. I threatened, if she would not satisfy me, to seek an explanation from Olivieri She fell upon her knees before me, begged me not, assured me that it concerned a third person. I was moved, I had the weakness to promise that I would seek no farther. I had not seen my friend till this moment, since the payment of my debts, he had never been home, and 1 had not sought him. He had rot accompanied ue, and I had not been iware that he was
expected. I re entered the house, hoping to find lum, but no one had seen him, and he did not appear at breakfast. Louisa made her appearance at that meal. You may imagine my pleasure at agam seeing hei out of hei sick chamber. She made room foi me by hei side. I accompanied hei into the oi ange- walk ηι αϊ the house, and I sat near her foi two houis while she enjoyed the beauty of the scene. She looked at the Alps, then at me, it seemed as if the recollec¬ tion of oui first meeting passed through the minds of both. Invol.mtauly I open¬ ed the bosom of my vest and showed hei the scaif, which I had constantly worn since that day. She smiled. " I did not thmk of this at that time," she said, " I did not know your name, but when the fame of Berchtold, Ernestus Berchtold, was echoed by the wild rocks to the voice of every peasant, I sighed and wished he might be the chamois huntei of the Wengein Alps. It was I sent the
saviou·· of my biothei 's life to battle I sent the hero to aid m the rescue of his country, it was in vain, yet I was con¬ scious of a feeling of pude whenever 1 thought of it " She spoke of my former hfe, and passed m silence over that part, when eveiy moment had been spent in shame I cannot describe my sensations to you 1 he feeling of how little I de served such p aise, mingling with the pleasure of hearing it from Louisa's lips, embittered what else would have been the proudest moment of my life Her father joined us, and seemed pleased at seeing us together, he seated himself upon the othei side of his daughter, and we spent the whole morning together in conveisation, till the sun becoming too powerful, Louisa was obliged to letire for shelter and repose, and we separated Day passed after day, and Louisa's health seemed rapidly to recover, but my sısteı eudently became more and more restless She generally avoided.
and very seldom sought our society. I knew not what tounderstand, determined however to foice hei to an explanation, I one evening, finding her alone, induced her to walk out with me. We wandered, without perceiving it, into the garden. She seemed determined upon silence. Wiapt in thought, the sun's red disk fast sinking in the west, the birds' evening carol, the vaued light of the heavens re¬ flected from the soft silky clouds over the purpling surface of the lake, the cool¬ ing bi eeze which played upon her feverish cheek, we-a all unnoticed. Yet she was wont, in ail-that feeling of nature's charms whicli accompanies youth, to gaze upon that oib, and figuring it as the image of that Piovidence she adored, thmk the birds sang hymns of thanks to him for all he give But now she passed, and all was unheeded. Theie was a seat upon the liver's side, which, shaded by the plants that crept entangled round the blanches of α noble chesnut, formed a
bower, whence all the beauties of the rich nature round could be viewed I attempted in vam to entei upon the subject of what was causing this apparent misery in her breast, she was abstracted, and answered meiely by monosyllables I at last ceased to piess her, and we both sunk into silence The spreading clematis of the bowei hid us completely fiom the path neai us, whde its open leaves allowed us to see dis tmctly all that passed m the avenue Theie was a wall of cypress which ian along one side of ť с gravel walk fully exposed at this moment to the sun's ι ays I saw at last approaching fi om the bottom, the Count oui protectoi, he seemed m earnest conveisation with some one, but I could perceive no one neai him, yet his lips and hands certainly moved as if he spoke As he gi adually approached, 1 could even distinguish sounds I motioned Julia to observe lum, she did so and soon pointed to the 1
hedge. I could not at fiist see to what she directed my attention, but at last I perceived the outline ofa figuie, through the shape of whose body the very leaves were visible, something in the man¬ net tint I have seen in the summei, a cunent of heited air, iccuiately defined by tne wivenng outline of the things between which and om sight it stands, only that this was even more sensible to ν ision I could not distinguish its voice, but I it last caught some of tbe words of Doni I had haidly time to make these obsei y ations, when the Count seemed to stut, and the figured vapour went AVe did not move, we for some time seemed looted to oui seats, at last Doni disippeaied amidst the trees, and we looked at each othei It was then true what we heaid it the lake of Thun, our piotector had communication with a spirit My sısteı seized the subject of conveisation with avidity. We ι elated to one anothei seveial slight circurn- H J
stances, which had come to oui know¬ ledge, many incidents which we could not explain. The reluctance of the sei- vants to approach the chambers of the Count all piessed upon our mmds. The immense wealth, which seemed inexhaust¬ ible, must, it appeared to us, be connected with this untenanting spirit. We re¬ solved not to mention the circumstance we had just witnessed to any one. But it wasnot effaced from oui own memory. We returned to the house and saw our pro¬ tector there as usual, but his face was, 01 I imagined it to be, pale, his eyes wan¬ dered, and then seemed to fix then angry glance at times upon us, but whether this were imagination or ïeality, I could not decide. I went to bed, but not to sleep, the thoughts of having seen an unembodied being, the tales of my fostei-mother, of power, of wealth, arising from the coni mumeation with beings of another woild, arose before me. Obtaining such a power, it seemed as if I might ^arn the things
hidden in the earth's deepest recesses, the ocean's depth, 1 even thought, that by such a power, I might tear away the veil which the first Cause has thrown over itself. Nor did these visions disappear with the morning's light, they were as distinct in the sun's brightness, as in the night's obscurity I arose deteimined to speak on the subject with the Count. He met me with an affectionate embrace, I took his hand, had the woi ds upon my lips, when, meeting his eye, I saw ex¬ pressed therein such anxious fear, such meaning, that the words fell into lnarticu- 1 ate sounds, instantly his eye was as usual, nothing but brilliancy was there. We went together to fetch Louisa from her apartment, and descended to the breakfast table Louisa seemed to take a great pleasure in my society, and sought in every way to bring me near her, she seemed afraid of trusting me to myself in my first steps towards retracing the paths of virtue. h S
She agam resumed the subject which had formed the topic of colivei sation, •before hei fai il departuie to visit her sick relation She painted to me the chaims of a religion, which taught us to look up to the infinite powei above us, not as to an object of teiroi and fear, but of love and hope. Hei mind, ,, ithout losing the least of that delicacy which is the magic charm that spreads its influence iound the footsteps of woman, was energetic and clear. Hei simplicity was not mis¬ led by the winding, intuente sophisms of the deist and unbeliever, her belief was built upon pei suasion, winch, though it had at first depended upon f uth, h id not bcorned the bulwarks ol íeason The earnestness with which sh^ spoke, did not make hei appe u bold 01 picsunimg , for the mild look of hei daik eye seemed looking to heaven to beg foi inspitation from him, whose cause hei lips weie pleadmg. She wouldoften leadme towaids the chapel, and without affectation, would
kneel down by my sídé motioning me to imitate hei, and bending devoutly before hei maker, would pray for me I did not think of myself, but gazing upon that veiled eye, which dia not seem to think itself worthy of looking towaids the throne of God, while petitioning for stiength against mortal weakness, a piayei vvould uivoluntanly rise from my heait foi hei I die 1 not feel the time long when neai hei, though it was even spent in priyei , to have communication with the Almighty in union with hei, seemed to be an additional bond amongst those numbeiless ties which bound me to hei Fiom the fust moment that I had „een her, she seemed to visit this earth as my protecting angel, now it appeared as if such a being had led me to the throne of him of whose commands she was the bearer I did not notice the lapse of months, md autumn had already vested the scene around with its checquered hues, ere tins happiness was interrupt- h 4
ed , I had even forgotten all my imagina¬ tions concerning the being attendant upon Dom It seemed as if misfortune could no longer visit me, such is human foiesight I have already mentioned to you the singularity of my sister's conduct, it grew more and more remarkable She never came down m the morning, but, confined to her room, she spent the hours m solitude when she did appeal, it was but to retire to α corner, where, enveloping herself in her shawl, she ap parently brooded ovei seme thoughts that destroyed her peace Her appeaiance was completely changed, hei aubui η hair, which onee floated in nnglets ot soft varying light upon hei shoulders, was now entangled and neglected, her cheeks, on which was wont to play α hue more delicate than that of the white rose, were pale and sickly , her eyes no longe shone with spai kling lustre, they were novv heavy and inflamed from the want of
sleep I often saw the silent tears fall from her ey e , but it was in vain to ques¬ tion het , she wept bitterly at eveiy en· quiry I made, and seemed agitated to the most violent excess whenever Ohvien's name was mentioned. I was bewildered by the enquiries of Dom and Louisa, w ho constantly expressed their anxiety con· cernmg her. We were assembled together at the bieakfast table as usual one morning, and weie eonveising about Julia, who had made her appearance the evening before at the supper table, which she had not done for a long time, when a seivant came to tell us that her maid had applied several times in the course of the last horn for admission to her room, but that she could obtain no answer. Louisa offered to see if she could obtain admis¬ sion ; in vam, we went together; all, all was silent. We burst open the door, there was no one, every thing seemed m h S
disorder, the bed had not been slept m the last night, upon the flooi tliere were many pieces of papei torn into frag ments , and upon the table theie wis a note addressed to myself I took itti em blmg, I was afraid she had committed some desperate act I could not open it, but gave it into Dom's hand , he read it " My shame can be no longer hidden , I fly then to hide myself, curse not your sısteı, my own feelings are sufficiently bıtttı to satisfy even the injured honour of Beiehtold —Your degiaded Julia " I sunk upon the bed, Obvien immedi ately piesented himself to my mind as the seducei of my sister ' could not speak, and my fnends were silent, they looked upon me with pity I dai ed not inform them of my suspicions, they would bring the old man's giey hairs to then giave, and would cut oft the feeble thread of life m Louisa She bore up against the shock, and while the teai trembled in hei
eye, she sat down by me, and stiove to sooth, not console me, foi that she knew was impossible Servants were sent in eveiy direction. I seaiched all the neighbourhood. I de- termined instantly to go to Milan, and make enquiries dnectly fiora Obvien, concerning the fate of my sısteı. I made a plausible excuse for my departure, and soon reached the Coi so, Doni's palace. The servants had not seen him foi some time. I forced myself to seek hım m the places which had been my formei íesort. My late compamons hailed my appioach, but I turned fi om them in disgust Obviei ι had no where been heard of lately. Dis¬ ti acted by my suspicions, which now seemed to wear the semblance of cei- tamty, after several days spent in the vain search, I returned to the Lake. We soon fixed ourselves agam at Milan. It was now impossible to keep his son's absence » secret from Doni. He learnt it, but did not seem to imagine h 6
any connection between the flight of my sister and his son's conduct. Perceiving this, I did not intimate to him my horri¬ ble doubts, but left him in entire igno¬ rance In the mean time I made the most minute enquiries concerning both, but could learn nothing. Louisa's health in the mean time giadu- allyrecovered, but she never lost the hec¬ tic flush upon her cheek, she gained strength, but the seeds of death were hid¬ den, not destroyed During hei gradual recovery, I was always with her, and if you can picture the happy hours of one sitting by a being he loves — adores, at the sime time, that his imagination paints her to bim as a spirit of heaven, you may ima¬ gine my happiness, when sittingby Louisa, whose smile, whose glance told me she loved. Shehadgainedmefame, hadsaved my life, my honour, had restored to me the hopes of a future state, the belief m a kind God. I know not your belief, your pnnciples, you may sneer at the feehng
which dictates my ranking the two last with the formei , but, young man ' believe one who has experienced the whole of fate's wanton inflictions,—he whocan still rest upon futurity, confident in the good¬ ness of his maker, may find a refuge in the greatest misery, he who cannot, may indeed despair, he has but the pie¬ sent, and that may indeed be dreadful. Louisa's image was always with me. I loved her, but so did every one, I could not for that reason hope to gam her. I was an orphan, how often has the thought of that sunk my buoyant hope, which still yvould revive I had no rank. Count Wilhelm had again renewed his addresses. It seemed dishonourable in me to conti¬ nue any longer near her, endeavouring to gam her affections, it seemed as if the debt of giatitude I owed to Doni forbade my attempting to gain his daughter. The count had rank and wealth. I could not hopethatherfathersliouldpreferme,degra- dedby vice, my birth perhaps tainted with
dishonoui, lo one whose name was a spell upon all Europe. I had determined to leave Milan, and to plead the necessity of fuithei enquiries for my sister Doni ap. proved of my intentions, and in a few days I was to set off I had been piepar- uigfor my depaituie, and had been talk- ing to the seivant about the tnfles neces saiy for a solitary journey, it was not yet the houi foi the company to assemble, and lost in sorrow I was slowly approich- nig the saloon when those notes which had sung hope to me in prison, sounded on the an Ihey weie falling upon the breeze broken, and in a ι lelancholy tone, though the air was lively, it SLemed as if Louisa sought to sing of hope, while her heart could not echo back the stiain I had not heaid the song since I sunk into vice. The sound was silenced, I enter¬ ed , Louisa was leaning upon her harp, her head was fallen upon her hand There was no light, and the lowering clouds tad the little daylight that might
have been afforded by the setting sun. I could just distinguish her foim, almost lost m the obscurity, suddenly she moved, struck her hai p in wild notes, and sung the words of a broken heait I could not heii more, Louisa's name fell from my lips, " Sing not so, Louisa, if you have not happiness, who shall possess it ? ' She sunk upon a chair, and I ap pioachetl " You leave ne to monow," she said, " I slnll no longer have my one to cheei me, any one, whom I can" — She stopped and hesitated I stood breathless by her side " I shall, I will retuin" "You will find me a corpse, I feel no power of life within me, it seems as if iny soul still clung to life that it might conveise with you, when you ire gone " I took hei hand , I bade her, if she loved me, not to speak in words that pierced my heart " Love jou," she answered, " you cannot know what I feel toward» you, I am myself ashamed that any can divide my heart with God, but you — *'
I fell upon my knees. " I will not go, 1 cannot, Louisa has confessed her love, she loves the orphan Berchtold, if that words could express the least part of what I feel, I would speak. I love you, let my silence speak the rest." I felt hei feeble hand press mme, she had fainted, hei weak health had not given her strength to listen. We had not heai d the storm which had bm st over our heads, I had not seen the flashes of heaven's anger, which had unobserved spread itä lund light around ns. I lifted her m my arms, can ied hei to her chamber, and delivered her to her maid. She recovered. I was alone , the thunders echoed still m the distance, and the horizon was lit by the forked lightning. But in my breast the convulsions were not subsiding. At the first moment it seemed as if hap¬ piness indeed were mine, but Dom's image came quickly across my mind, and all I owed him seemed to be imaged as so many reproaches for my having stolen
the affections of my benefactor's daugh¬ ter. The company assembled, but I could not join them. The tumult in my breast was too powerful to allow me to participate in the light frivolity of a draw¬ ing room. I retired to my chamber, and was soon lost m meditation upon that fa¬ tality, which made the very circumstance on which I had rested as the bouine of all my hopes, а cause of anguish and re¬ proach. I determined to see the Count immediately after the company had retired. No malefactor, who is listening ш expectation of hearing the lengthened toll, warning him of the executioner's approach, ever counted the moments with greater anxiety than mine. The clock struck, and each brazen sound seemed to vibrate thiough my body, as if it bore grief upon its sound. At last the carnages began to depart, and I entered the apartment of my friend. 1 had nevei dai ed to call him father, it seemed to my
mind too sacred a title to be profaned by me ; he was Louisa's father. I had been some time in his apartment before he entered. He came, his face was full of anxiety. " My daughter," he said, " I fear is gomg to relapse, some¬ thing has agitated hei stiongly, and she will not tell even her father what it is. Beiehtold," he continued, "you have never before seen a father m the agony that I enduie, my daughtei's life sinks visibly before me, and I cannot discovei the cause. You have therefore no con¬ ception of the pam it bungs." I knew not what to say. " Onvieu too is I know not wheie, pei chance in the haunt of the lowest vice, perhaps acting again the hero, aswhenwithyou. Youarenotmycluld,yet you now form my only comfort, my only hope." Icould not heai more,—he praise me ' vv ho had, like the snake stinging the child enchanted by the beauty of its scales, lobbed hun of his treasure, insidi¬ ously won his daughtei's love, 1 inter-
rupted hım. " I am a wretch, not worthy of your affection, your daughter loves me, I have dared to tell her she wis my only hope ; spurn me from you, I expect it, but do not blame her." I fell upon my knees, " Do not blame her for loving such a wretch as me, she pitied me and my da¬ ring devotion changed pity intolove " My head was hid within my hands, I expect¬ ed to be cui sed by hım I looked up to as a fathei He raised me from the giound. " Ernestus, this is nobly spoken, I will not reproach you with youi foimer vices, Louisa sliall be security to me, that you will always prove what you now show yourself" I was amazed, I embiaced hnn, but could not speak. Louisa was to be mine,—my guide, my wife. At that moment happiness seemed to be descend¬ ing fiom heaven to be oui handmaid, while m fact despau and honor weie pre¬ paring then flight from the lowest abyss to wait upon out nuptials. Next moinmg I was admitted to
Louisa's chamber, I told her that her fa- thei had consented to our union. A gleam of joy crossed her pale face, she said she was happy, but those words were m a broken and weak voice. I heeded it not, so great was my joy, I sat with her, she listened to my plans of happiness, and smiled, it seemedas if she were conscious of there being but to be imagined I was at last called away by my own seivant, who putting a letter m my Viand, told me that he had found it thiown in at the door. lt was my sister's hand wilting, feaiful of agitating Louisa, I hastily put it into my bosom, and making an excuse left her. When in my chambei, I opened the note. The lines were few " A mother appeals for her child to your charity, she has buta short time to live, but her child has not a broken heart Julia," Berchtold had been written, but a tear had effaced the characters 1 heie was the name of an obscure street in the most retired part ot Milan.
I immediately repaired thither, and soon found myself in an abode of miseiy I cannot describe. It was upon the high¬ est stoiy, the roof in several parts let in the hot ray of the sun, and the window was not glazed, but stuffed with dirty rags. It could not be called a shelter, for the flooi bore on its black soft texture the marks of every cloud that had passed over it. In one corner theie was a bed¬ stead, over which was spread a blanket, that seemed not to have been removed for many years, it was so black and thick with dirt. A broken dish and rags, which I but too well recognized as the ïemnants of my sister's dress, weie the only things upon the ñoor. I heard a difficult breathing, which proceeded fiom the bed. I approached, and found my sister. She was pale and squalid, her hair, entangled and loose, covered her face and bosom, and her clasped hands bung from the bed. She was apparently asleep, and her child was grasping lier
breast with its little hand, trying in vain to obtain sustenance from its fevered mother I stood for some time gazing upon her, finding she slept soundly, I descended the creaking stairs, and send ing some person of the house for clothes and food, I waited till they returned ind carried them up with me The noise I made awakened her, she shi link from me, "I did not call you for m) self, but this child's ciy pieiced my heai ŕ, — do, do not theiefore cuise me, if I have even brought you to witness youi sistei's infamy I could not die and leave my child sinking uniided upon my putrid corpse ' 1 spoke kindly to hei, she look ed upon me, aud said, " Ernestus," with an inciedulous voice, and burst into tears I soothed hei, spoke to her of her child, induced hei to take a little nouushment, and saw hei feed hei little babe She looked at its eagei eye and face while feeding, at moments hugged it to her bo soin, while а stifled laugh escaped her,
she did not seem to notice me, and I spoke not. At list she fell exhausted upon the bed I gave her the clothes I had biought, she did not heed me. I hastened to Doni, related what I had seen, he oidered every thing to be got ready at the palace, and procuring a httei he accompanied me to the abode of my wretched Julia. At sight of him, she hid her face, and vvould not speak I had her conveyed to the httei with hei child, and we ainved at the palace The physician ot the family being sent foi, announced to us, that fiom the stite of exhaustion, into which she had fallen, theie weie but a few houis lemauung of her life. I watch¬ ed by hei all night, she did not speak, I took Louisa foi my model, and spoke to her of those hopes which had seemed on her f ips to have the pow er of soothing sickness, in t ι > st I the fe u s ut death. She was moved by what 1 said, foi her cold hand pressed mine I put questions to her with regaid to her seducer, she was silent;
but a convulsive motion seemed to seize her whole featuies I urged her no moie She seemed to revive a little in the morn¬ ing, augurmgwell fromit, I began to speak to hei of hei child, talked to her of its health^faid it should be named Ernestus, and promised that I would be its fathei She raised her fallen head, and looking with tears in her eyes, blessed me, but hardly had the words fallen fiom her lips, when shuddering, she said, "my blessing ' that, that's a curse " I took her to my breast, she shiunk from me, "you know not whom j ou embrace " It is my sis ter, whom I hold in my arms," I ci ied she burst into loud sobs, and fell again upon her pillow " You shall hear, she replied,what a sister '" She prepared to ie late to me the whole of her late history, I advised her to repose awhile first " Well, weD, 1 shall hive the less time to feel the blush of shame, and to hear your repioach es, 'tıs better so " She fell asleep aftei ut tering these words, but she was restless,
her face was convulsed, and the twitchingf of hei arms began- to give>the signs of ther· lopid approach of death. I seized tins moment of apparent rest to enquue for Louisa She was nruűhi bettei, wc had kept oui discovery of Julia a seciet, fearful of agitating her too much , I determined therefore to see her, lest, making some enquiry concermng me, she might hear how I was engaged I entered hei loom, and staid with hei for some time, she spoke of hei love, md iddcd, that all tint she thought want ing was the piesence of her biothei and Inha I could not answei, but rose, ind igain went to my unconscious sısteı She was distuihed m hei sleep, and was callinţr upon Louiia's nime, she seemed toie proach hei foi not seeing her, but then she appeaiedtomeditate and said , "tine, tuie, I im an outcist " She awoke, looked vv lldly ai ound, met my eye. She was lost оше tiinein thought, and then addressed me, "I know what you aie waiting for
but ere I unfold the whole of my shame, give me your solemn promise that you will grant your sister her last dying re¬ quest." Igavevther "You will then nevei mention to either of my former fnends what I narrate, and you will let me die, certain that you will nevei injure lum that ruined me, for still, still I love him " I as¬ sured hei, that I would leave it to heaven to punish him, foi I was conscious it was Obvien, Louisa's brother. It was him, the account that I had given of his bravery in the Swiss wai, the description I had made of his daung feats had gained an entire possession of her imagination When, therefore, she met him at Milan, his beauty, his specious manner and ap¬ parent knowledge had completed her f as¬ ematien I myself, when bewildered by doubts, had sapped the foundation of her leligious principles, and Obvien, who was not bhnd to her partiality, had fanned tbe spark ot scepticism, tül he had destroyed all bebef in virtue and a future state. I
lost myself at the gambling table, and my conduct was but an additional proof m her mmd, that the present was all that belong¬ ed to man. Before we left Milan, the se- ducei accomplished his criminal purpose. Though however, shehad become a convert to his theories, she could not divest hei¬ self of all feeling of shame, much less could she entirely drive fiom her heart those doctrines which Beiehtold had in¬ stilled at that age when the fil st impres¬ sions become pait of our very natuie, they hung around hei, and haunted hei day and night, she had sought for courage to apply to Louisa or myself in hei diffi¬ culties, but had not daied. Her mind being in this state, she de¬ scnbed the effect upon it, at sight ofthat being almost lost amidst the ambient au m coveisation w ith Dom, as wonderful Her mind had unineďately recoveied its elas¬ ticity, foi she hoped, if she could obtain communication with such a being, to be able to find some certainty amidst the hoi- iS
rid doubts that revelled m hei mmd, and to pioeure tbe means of hiding hei shame, or daring to face the day, by means of its power. Deteimined to learn, the spell which could raise a t> ans- parent, all - pervading being, she íe¬ solved to watch, without remission, the conduct ofthe Count, she learnt nothing for some tune He apparently differed in no habit from the otheis aiound But the impression in her mmd was not effaced at last it ajipoared to hei that upon cei¬ tam days, the Count nevei touched mi- mal food, and she found by obsei ν ation that this h ippened on eveiy combin шоп of seven in the days of the month Upon enquny amongst the servants, she found that upon the morning of those days, the room of Dom was always in the gi eitest confusion, and she herself lemarked, that upon the evening preceding, he seemed always moie anxious, and the day after more fatigued than usual Juliaresolved to watch theCountupon the 4,
next seventh night, she found that it was possible to look mto his room, through the wam»eot of a closet for wood that open¬ ed into the passage leading to his apart¬ ment The mght came, meat had been avoided, all were gone to their rooms, only the footsteps ol tlie domestics arranging eveiy thing for rest, sounded on hei ear, she described beiseli, as having listen¬ ed appalently foi houis, though only mi¬ nutes elapsed, while these sounds con¬ tinued Atlast, all was silent, she said, that not even the vine leaves overspread» ing hei casement were heard to ι ustle, fór eveiy bieeze was hushed, all was so quiet, that the eai seemed to feel as it were the silence She was awed, hei heart beat quick, she held her breath, at that momeut she thought a slow step sounded along the corridor, alarmed she knew not Why, she seized hei lamp, and was upon the point of rushing out, when the door slo*> ly opened, and a figure clad id a white robe entered, its dark bktefe eye was firatt , i S
its grey locks seemed as if no bieath of air could move their weight ; no sign of life, save the moving feet belonged to it, for the face was pale, the lips blueish It approached with an unvarying step, it was Dom ι its hand took her's within its cold grasp, its ey« shone, as if a tear had passed over it, its lips quivered as if it wished to speak, or tr-ought it spoke She stood still, motionless, while it appioach ed, it seemed as if she had strength for any thing, but when it turned to go, the lamp fell from her hand, and she fell upon the floor It wasjnorn, ere hei wildeied senses returned, it was too late Doni never noticed in any way the event of that night She was bewildered, she knew not what to thmk, it seemed from his un changed conduct towards her, that he was unconscious of the event Yet she as serted that she could not have mistaken the features of him «ho had visited hei м- that awful manner, her imagination laboured, her judgment laid down the ba
lance and became as dead. Her phanta sy painted to her mmd pictures of splen¬ dour and of power, more bnlliant than those of the Arab tale-teller, or God crea¬ ting Bramin But more than all, it repre- presented to hpr the means of ensunng Ohvien's love, which she could no longer flatter herself she possessed , he had not seen her, but for a moment, since she had left Milan dishonoured, and then it was but to laugh at her fears, which she was but too conscious were not in vain. Dav followed day towards the seventh. At times she caught Dom's eye fixed upon her, as if it sought to read her mmd , but she thought this might be imagination, yet it seemed to her as if her intentions were divined, and that from some cause or other, they could not be opposed, else why this silence? The fatal night came. Julia, determin¬ ed to brave every thing, went down that evening, which she had not lately done, to supper Her agitation was great, ι 4
but she forced herself to conceal it. She was conscious the Count's eyes were fixed uponhers.yet she dat oil not to lookup and meet his She rose to depait, he came to her to say good night, lus voice tailed lum, his hand shook. She retired lo her room, she deteimmed, frightened by the awful silence of her pioteetoi, to give up her intention. She tluew herself upon hei bed, but sleep abandoned hei, 01 if it for a moment came, it presented such brilliant visions to her eye, that nothing mortal was to be compared to it. She seemed to have spirits instead of pages to attend hei, genu instead of servants. It ■»eemed as if at then bidding the very earth would heave and show within its entrails, all its nchest treasuies. Olivieri appeared joined with hei m tins state of power. She roused herself, fhe clock ■ith its solemn peal seemed tiem- Wmg to intiude upon the solemn night. One might have thought natui e were deed, ror not even the owl shrieked, and
the daikness and nocturnal sleep that weighed on the eaith, seemed no longei the type of the eternal rest ot the world, but its fulfilment, all appealed sunk into such undistuibed repose Julia alone seemed living, she looked tn the creation I 11 the Ai ib in the sandy plam, animate amidst inanimation, organized amidst un- organized mattéi Even she must have appealed as if she weie some spirit of anotliei moie ìestless spheie foi her liuiiying ghnce the feaiful leso'ution bieathing in hei face must have made liei beai the stamp of something more than moitahty She seized hei lamp, stai ted, then advanced, and laughelwith that la igh w luch pl tys upon the lips when the heait ceases to beat thiough violence of feeling At last she reached the gallery of her protector s loom, she opened w ith a trem¬ bling h vnd, the door of the adjoining closet, and entered The dread silence still continued, it was only broken by the ι 5
loud bı eathing of her heaving bosom She sat down upon the pile of wood in the roi ner of the closet. She could not find couiage to pursue her undertaking; at last a deep groan made her start, terrified she leant against the wall ; as she gradu¬ ally recovered heiself, she raised her eyes, and looked through a crevice that opened to hei sight the Count's loom. 1 could not leain what she saw, she how¬ ever infoi med me that she diseoveied the means of ìaising a supenoi being, but that startled at his appearance, she had sunk to the ground. She found herself, when recovered, upon her bed, but no one was neai hei. She determined to put hei powei into effect the ensuing night. She would not join the family at breakfast, but lemamed m hei room aH day. She did attempt to raise a spirit, but what was hei horror, when the walls of liei apartment echoed but scoffs and rnockmgs, they seemed to say that she »eeded not a gieatei puce than the giati-
fication of herpassions, and that they would not give her more, that she was theirs al¬ ready, and that to command them could only be obtained by one not already damned Unappalled she repeated her call, but it was in vain, all sunk to quiet. Desperate, for hei shame could no longer be hidden, she formed at once the reso¬ lution of leaving the house and seeking her seducer She got out, and entering a boat, managed by skulking along the banks of the lake throughout the day, to arrive in the night at Sesto Calende , she thence easily obtained a conveyance, and reached Mil»n She had sought refuge at a small inn, ind sending to Olivieri, he came to her, but it was only to make fully known to her the horroi s of her situation. It ap¬ pears he tieated her with brutality, though she did not say so He staid with her but a few minutes, and left hei foi ever He offered her no assist¬ ance, seemed even to have implied that ι 6
if unwilling to return to her biothei, âhe might hve by e'posmg her shame to «11, and boldly seeking whom she might inveigle He left ber with only the small .»um remaining from what she had taken with hei, and immediately left Milan to go she knew not where She had thence re- tured to the room where I had found liei, and had there managed to support life, and was dehveied of her child Hei money howevei failed her, and, at last, her poor neighbours, tired of assisting her who could no longer pay them, having re fused to aid liei any more, she had sti uggled with the pains of hungei for two days m solitude, hoping for lehef from death But liei milk har* failed, and her child's voice had pierced its mother's heart, she could not ıesıst sueh an appeal, she arose, wrote the few lines to me, and staggering, in the morning while all were at iest, to the gate ofthe palace, had thrown them under the gate From thence she had haidly found strength suf-
ficient to reach hei miserable couch, when fatigued, she sunk into a kmd of stupor from which my approach had ι oused her. This is the substance of what my sis¬ ter told me Het narration wns broken, andm?ny weie the pauses she was forced to make to recover strength. Her feeble bieath haidly »eemed sufficient to «How her to end bei tale. Night came, and she was delirious. She scieamtd for Obvien, called on him to come and see her die. She held my hands, and looking on me asked me iny name, denied it could be me, foi I could not be moie kind than Obvien , but why rest upon such α scene 3 She died in the morning without a letuin of reason, but still calling, in the last moment, upon hei lovei My sister was dead. Hei tale had unfolded to me the causes whence hei misconduct aiose 1 was tlie souice of all, my colounng of Ohvien's good quali¬ ties, my exposing to hei the souices of doubt in thosedocfnnes oursainted foster- Uthei had taught us, my example in the
career of vice were the causes of hei fault—her death. It was yet but the second victim to my fate , there were two others wanting, I sat by the dead body reflecting upon the hornble fatality that had caused my virtues and my vices to piove alike moital to the two beings who foi man) years had been the only compamons I possessed in natui e, the only sympathizers in my joys and sorrows. If the pangs of conscience could be depicted, I would, for your sake, young man, paint in its truest colouis, the hoiroi I then felt, the pangs I now feel , but the attempt would be vain. I had loved my sister with all that affection two isolated bemgs natu¬ rally feel towards each other. She had been to me as the weaker part of myself, which always needed protection and de¬ fence. To me she had been the holder of all my secrets, the paitakei of all my sor¬ rows , when an outcast, she had ıeceıved me, when a wietcb, she had not spurned me·
No one was with me when she died The seivant of Louisa found me many hours after her decease, extended upon her corpse She came from her misfness to seek me I iole , I knew not hovv to conceal the anguish of my mind Louisa soon diseoveied it, and obtained from me the knowledge of my sister's illness and death She did not enquire furthei, she perceived I was not willing she should know the rest, and was silent I was astonished to see how firmly she boi e the shock she exeited heiself to find some means of allaying my grief, but she did not know that it was conscience that worked withm I left hei, and her pre tended stiength was gone She had forced herself to assume an apparent calm to assuage my gnef, but could not com mand her own My sister was intened pnvately Doni and myself, were the only mourners, and a tablet, wich meiely the name of Julia Berchtold, maiked the spot where m„

PART THIRD.
1 had already undergone more than falls to the lot of most men in tins valley of mibeues, but 1 was not allowed lepóse; fiom this moment my heart was torn piece-meal, by fiends each more hoirible than tlie other. Not many days had elapsed since Juha'sdeath,when Ohvieu's fathei ıeceıved an anonymom wu mug to prépaie himself foi the worst news. Pile lettéi was dated btiasbuigh. Next day lie lead ш anotliei lettéi, that his son, undei an assumed name, had been taken with several otheis of а band of lobbert
who had for a long time infested the banks of the Rhine Dom had now become aged and infirm, he was not capible of undergoing the f itigues of a long join ney, yet it « as lı irdly possible to hinder hun fiom setting off, to attempt saving his only son He blessed me when I insisted upon pei foiming that ofiice " You have twice sived his hfe in the field of honour, may you be is sue cessful in snatching him from the death of infamy " He gave me unlimited power and rushed irto his daughter's apirtment to seek there for the comfort all else seemed to deny him I departed, travelled night and diy, I saw Switzerland again, but did not even notice it, my mmd was anxious, was alarmed, it seemed as if heaven wished by repeated inflictions of its bitterest curses, to humble to the dust the family circle of my protector I was so lash, that tor ι moment I dared to question Pi ovidence So w едк ıs all mortal know
ledge; miseiy ıs but the fi uit of vice, vutue never feels the woild's infamy, there is a heavenly beam of certainty in the meiciful justice of then God that enables the just to look upon all the in¬ flictions of this life, but as the most lenient atonement due to α tendei, though oflended fathei, foi those weaknesses belonging even to our nature. I arnved at Strasburgh, its fretted spire, rising high above the houses, upon the fai extended plain, for α long time maiked the bourne to which I was tend¬ ing, while the winding road that forms the appioach, seemed to mock my en¬ deavours to ıeach it. Justice had been summaiy, there had not even been a ι egular tual, but α court mai tial had been summoned, and instantly had condemned the prisoneis to death. A ìespite had however been granted foi a few days, ш consequence of the hopes entei tamed of inducing some individual to betiay the seciet letreats of then comi .ides I nn-
mediately pioceeded to the pnson and isked tdmission Application being made to the goveinoi, and it being evi¬ dent that I was not one of the gang, I obtained it. I enteied, bolt aftei bolt slovl) sountkd as they were foiced fiom their lusty clasps, md I found myself in я low galleiy, the damp was slowly falling m measmed diops fiom the arched vault above, and the coldness of tlie chilly an made me sliiv ei. The jailor boi e a torch befoie me, its red light at last rested upon the strong fastenings to a nanow dooi. I gave lum money, and seizing the torch, enteied. Upon a little stiaw, covering a few loose stonesm a coiner, lay a foim, which seemed reckless of all. The light of the toich did not cause it to move, its hands weie upon its face, clenched, its whole postule was strained, as if by the convulsive stiffening of its limbs it would harden itself against the inflictions of the mmd I could not speak, thrice I strove
to uttei the name of Oliviei ι, and thrice it stuck in my tin oat " Speak, I can listen tomy fate," Obviei ι at lastsaidin a hurried voice, " Death they say silences all voices, if it can silence that which echoes through the chambers of my bieast, scaring obli¬ vion and i epose, I shall be content to die, though on the wheel, waiting, when all my limbs aie cuished, foi that repose the non bat may give " He did not move, but seemed to mutter this, addressing himself is much as me. "Obvien," at last fell tieinblmg fiom my lips He with one exertion stood elect, his eyeballs straining in then sockets, seemed to seek the hornd cei tainty they knew would blast them. Beiehtold appealed befoie him. He tlu ew himself upon the sti iw, and with a hind clenching with funous grasp nis long black hau, he seemed to foice his head upon the giound, fearing his eyes should again tuin upon ine. I sate upon the stones at his side, laid my hind upon him, bade him be comforted. He
shrunk as if my touch froze hım I tottt hıra of my liti] es of obtaining his ι elease, of the wealth I could employ in bribing his Judges He looked up," You talk to me of rneicv, Julia was seduced by me." "I know it," I replied, "it is youi fathei, who acts by me, I am but my benefactor's agent Foi him I am to attempt to save his son." " His son?" he echoed m a faultéi mg voice, "true, I was his son " I in vain asked him for information on which to proceed, he would give me none. I left him. I apphed to the couıt which had passed his sentence. I saw the membeis who had composed it m pnvate. They gave me an account of the desperate gang to which he had belonged, and ρ unted m hoi rid colours the devastations they had committed m the French territory. It ap¬ peared (¡hat Olivien had put himself at the head of these outlaws, and had with the most daring rashness and carelessness of life, always eluded the numbers that
often seemed to suriound hım. I made tliose who appeared favourable to my pleading great presents, under the pre tence of enabling them to aid the furthei· nice of my objects. Amongst the otliers, the goveinoi seemed to have the most influence I gave lum immense sums, which he piomised to expend foi the pi isonei 's advantage. I he next day was appointed for the execution. I had not seen Oliviei ι again, I was anxious not to encoui age too much his hopes of hfe, while all seemed uncertain. I called early in the morning, upon the go¬ vernor, I saw him He raised my expec¬ tations veiy high, he said, that if Icould but find the slightest pretence foi a res¬ pite, th it it was determined to grant it. "If I were to judge by youi riches, he and youiself must be of higher rank than yon pietend " Ihadconcealedbothournames. " Now, if you can but show that some one of influence is interested m his fate, we will admit of an appeal." Rashly I
was induced to uttei the names of Obvien Doni, and Einestus Beiehtold. I was surpnsed at seeing the roan befoie me turn of a most deadly pale. His limbs scemi tl to fid lum, but he in an instant ìcccLied himself, his voice alone be¬ tiayed an emotion I couldnot undeistand He isMiictl mc that he would instantly occupy limiseli about it, and I lelt him. h lıuııı liteiwuils I ıeceıved α note fiom him si,ing, that I should piepaie a ι cinii_ and post boises upon the bııdLP, ıı d is the t lock stiuck the nist hom ol the morning, that 1 should pie¬ sent myself at the prison dooi, wheie I should meet my fntnd Unt this had been t.ie.it¿ht the best means of allowing his escapt Passpoit» weie enclosed, whicli would alio v us to pass the budge, md we should then be m silety 1 im¬ mediately piepaied eveiy thing, anx jus lor the auival of the moment when I was igain to sa\ о the brothei of Louisa. lowaids evening, ìestless, I issued out.
I wandeied up and down that part ofthe main stieet, which covered by arcades, brought to my recollection the towns of my native country Memory was ïapidly uowded with the images of infancy, while the evening tints, and the stillness of natuie soon enabled me to abstract myself entirely fiom the surrounding ob iccts I at last found myself in the ca thedral There was no one theie, even deiotion seemed foi a while to have laid aside its pomp о enjoy the balmy fiesh ness of an Apul evening I had at last idvanced into the most obscure part of the aisle, when turning iound, a hght fi guie diessed in the smgulai vestment of the neighbouiing peasantry, caught ny ey e Her step w as hurned, and her head inovei anxiously as if seeming to shun observit, on Thinking that my presence might be painful, I was retiring, when she beckoned to me 1 stood still, and she wis immediately by my side She hastily addiessed me " You are a к

He once professed love tçi me, he has probably done so to many more,' who are now like me ashamed of' thpir -.tame ; but even if I told it you, it would be useless. Hoping to be of' service, and anxious to hear of' him wţio still possesses my affection, though he has broken the peace of her, vvho loves him ; but I deserve it, for I am guilty, he cannot love guilt; I am so lowered, that I was not ashamed to gain my object, by seeking one ofthe pri¬ son guard. I have just left him intoxi¬ cated. From him I learnt, while he was blabbing all, that he was called upon to perform a service this night in the course of his duty, that he disliked. I gained froţn him that he was to belong to a party, who were to lurk in one of' the streets and seize my lover and yourself, at the moment you thought yourselves secuie of fieedom, fbr that tho police

ϊ got her to lead me to the neighbour¬ hood of the prison, and show me all the turnings and secret cuts through the dif¬ ferent streets. I soon gained a perfect îojea of the plan of this part of the town, and I began to hope in consequence of the intricacy and number of turnings in this neighbourhood that I might elude the ambush, if I could at any point break through the guards. I did not en¬ tirely open my plan to my guide, but asked her if'she knew of'any certain place of lefuge, whither I could retreat in case of need. She led me and showed me hei apartment, it was miserable, but theie Was an air of neatness about it that seemed, in contradiction with the poveity, visible in every article, " If'you can ai- lîiye heie without being observed, you are safe." To avoid suspicion, I immediately left b.ei and returned to my hotel, which was «tose to the river. The houi approached, 1 armed myself with a sabie and a pan of'
pistols, and hiding under my large Italian cloak another sword and pair of fire arms, I sauntered negligently out of the inn door, and calling my servant, I told him in a loud voice to take care the horses were ready, as I intended to set off the moment I had fixed on. This I did tp blind anyone, who might be watching my motions. Then turning down some of the most abrupt windings, I first went whither I had learnt the different parties were to be placed. By means of keeping close to a shaded part of'the walls of the streets, which being lit by a single reverberating lamp suspended in the middle between the houses, were rather dark, I could ap¬ proach very near them without being perceived. I discovered one point whieh I thought weaker than the rest, for the number of the men seemed smaller, the silence being greater. I then returned, entered the main street leading to the prison, and soon found myself at its gate, without meeting any one. The к 3
high narrow windowed walls, were sud¬ denly illuminated by the moon bursting in all its splendour from behind a cloud, and.high above my reach I perceived .some one watching me, he íetreated and I heard the gates open. I could not perceive who was there, for the hollow opening was in the dark shadow thrown over it by a salient buttress. My heart beat violently. It might not be Olivieri, a person was pushed out, I heard the words, " I am free," spoken in a voice that denoted the despair within. I ap¬ proached, it was Olivieri. Throwing off my mantle, I stood before him; he did not notice me, though the moon's ray was full upon us. 1 roused him, thrust the sword and pistols into his hand, and bade him follow me. " We are ttot safe, we must baffle the traitors .. yet," said I, " be firm, we have escaped greater perils than these, follow me." аШз broken voice, merely answered, " To dţMthi"'.
1 hastened towaids the point I thought the weakest A shrill whistle soundeu it our back, and we found ourselves sur¬ rounded The fiist who approached, weie dead at our feet They retreated before us, we had bioken then circle and were already free towaids the street down which it was necessiry to turn " Now to the nght," I cued to my companion A shot stiuck lum and he fell, I lushed to the spot hoping that he might use I struck on every side deteimmed not to leave him in their hands, their numbers increased, but at the same time I heard a trampling of feet at my back , desperate, I rushed forward, a female shriek struck my ear, and at the same time I found my self joined by about twenty men Their blows told, we caused the town guaid to ıetreat I could not again find Ohvien's body I rushed along the streets, and was soon at the young woman's door I heard voices, alarmed, I listened, they were evi¬ dently from their conversation trying to к 4
console some,one. I knocked, a female voice, immediately exclaimed, '* 'Tis he," and tl)o ; door was opened. I entered, Olivieri was extended upon a couch, at¬ tempting to write a few lines ; he had juşţ finished., Around him were many roen, in, a strange uncouth garb. They were his former companions, who having received, the same intelligence from the girl as myself, had resolved to attempt α i escue.and had stolen singlyinto the town. Olivieri gave me what he had written, it was to his father ; his pale f ace was turned towards me, his feeble arm could hardly support its own weight. " Berchtold, I have not deserved the risking yourself' for me ;,can, can you forgive me dying." " Ido," nyas my answer, and 1 held his ext,ende4<h,and. He threw himself upon his Ijed, and in a stifled voice, " There is another, whose forgiveness I do not ask, but tell, oh,! tell her, it was her shame that, has damned me, that made me des¬ perate, damped me." " »he's dead, she
too would have forgiven 'you ; she" died speaking of you, but not cursing you." His limbs were instantly relaxed, and moved no more, ι ' ' We were now aroused by the entry of another robber, the soldiers were apJ proaching, I begged of' them not to leave the body of my Louisa's brother to tlieir insults ; they lifted it fiom the couch, and placed it in a recess so artfully contrived, that it bid defiance to the most accurate search, and they promised me they would return and bury it. We took the young woman vvith us, and separating, we singly hastened to a spot by the rivei's side, where we hoped to find boats. Ten only reached it, we entered a small wherry. The town was in such confusion that the necessary orders had not been sent to the different boundaries. We let the 'boat float down the stream, and soon'found ourselves beyond the fbrtificatioiis.- We landedon the German side, and presently leached one of the dwellings of the free- it 5
Iţooters. I sow leaint rhat it was tli is samş girl, who had written the anony- mous letter to ,her lover's father. .1 of¬ fered, her a considerable Sum of money, again ,offered to secure her an independ¬ ence, she refused it all, and insisted upon jemaining wit! ι those men amongst whom she had first known Olivieri. I remained with them a considerable time, anxious to see the body of' my former friend se¬ cure against any insult, and befoi e I left them, aided by the daring of' these men, who managed to enter the town and take the body from its seciet hiding place, I had the satisfaction of' consigning him to the earth. I gave them all the loose money remaining with me, secure up¬ pn my letters of credit of' having more than enough, to, convey me whither I diked. , ι ■ I reached Inspruck, not deeming my- ■rself safe in any part of the French terri- tøry, I determined to remain bere, and I wrote to Doniimerely mentionmg that I
had been unsuccessful, and telling him' where I had stopped. I thought «beet not to tell him more fbr fear of m'ylètter being intercepted, and hoping that'when I saw him 1 should be able tb break the fatal news to him. My last hope was vain, for all the papers and public prints con¬ tained β full account of'the daring attempt I had made to save a robber from the ig¬ nominious sentence of the law. Our real names were also mentioned, and at the same time that many rested upon the cou¬ rage, they pretended had been shown in this attempt, many took advantage of the connection of' our names with a gang of robbers to throw discredit upon our for¬ mer conduct in the cause of Switzerland. It was soon known tlirough my banker, 1 at Iuspruck, that I was the notorious Ernes- tus Berchtold, and I was surrounded by people, who were glad to seek some re¬ fuge from tlieir ennui, in gazing upon one, whose name seemed to háve some¬ thing like romance attached to it. к b'
Count Doni arrived, Louisa too, though weak and feeble, still in better health than when I had last seen her, accompanied him. She had been foiced to,exert herself to support her father un¬ der his anxiety for his son, and theu un·- der the severe blow of seeing his own name in all the prints, known to all as the father of' Olivieri, < a captain of ban¬ ditti.' The spring had given her the re¬ quisite stiength, and I was glad, after so long an absence, to see her once more sitting by my side with renovated life. I could not take my eyes from hei, and I rested upon her face so long, that I gradually forced myself to hope that her hectic flush was but her natural colour. We were constantly together, and tried in, leach other's presence to forget the griefs lhat weighed upon us both. I had given ţhellast lines of' my former friend tOrJlis father, ι He had read them m his owjj, j¡pem, and though, when we next met I remarked that his eye turned upon me
wet with tears, as he evidently did not in¬ timate the 'east inclination to expose to me what his son had written, I did Hot seek to learn the substance of Olivieri's note ; though I was anxious to léarti whether he had disclosed his conduct to¬ wards Julia. We never after mentioned his name, and we tried to keep the thoughts of' his melancholy fate out of our minds, by resting upon our hopes of Louisa's welfare. Count Wilhelm, whom I have before mentioned, found us on his way to his native country ; hearing of' our being at the same hotel, he sent in his name to iny friend. Day after day he remained at Inspruck. The whole of the evening was spent with us in our apartment, and he seemed to seek more and more the means of showing attentions td Louisa. At first I was not disturbed by them, but at last I became fretful and irritable, fbr it appeared as if Louisa took' a pleasure in his conversation. I had heard so much
ofhis power of attaching women, that rt seemed impossible for hei to resist him Every thing he did, though the most simple action, was perverted in my mind, to a. covert sneer at my poveity and in¬ significance I often answered him ab¬ ruptly, and even insulted him. Louisa's meek eye turned upon me, but it seemed to have lost its influence I one night found him by liei side, he seemed to be earnestly pleading, he had hold of her hand, and she smiled Stung to the quick by so slight a cucumstance, I turned furiously away and retieated to my chamber Had Berchtold taught me to command my passions, had he but shown me as models for my conduct, men, in the pnvacy of life, 1 might have escaped much. It is vain to rest upon it. I had thought that Louisa's influence over my mmd, would have hindered me ever agam losmg myself, hurried away by any passion. But heie Louisa's foim aiose m aH the hideousness of jealousy's
distorting mirror! I Was mad. My clenched fist struck the table, I could not command myself. I remained some time in this state, when turning my eyes to¬ wards my bureau, I perceived an alma¬ nack ; I seized it in mockery ; I counted up the days since she had told me she loved me. I was suddenly struck, it was the 28th day of the month, it was a combination of seven. It seemed as if by one exertion I migli free myself'fiom doubt, and be at once lost in the horrible certainty, or be fbr ever blest in the knowledge of Louisa's heart. I did not reflect ; the hour struck ; I seized my lamp, and rushing out was al¬ ready close to the apaitment of' Doni, when wavering on the wick the flame suddenly sunk and expired. Yet nothipg around was dark, it seemed as if I was surrounded by a mist formed by a dazz¬ ling light, too dazzling to allow me to view the qbjects round. I was a moment starfted, but. undismayed I strove to rush
forward, my ftet were boundtto the floor. I strove butira væn to move Gradually the'light cleared, and giadually the fea¬ tures, of that face, which I had so often gazed upon ra mv imagination, my mo¬ ther's, appeared distinctly before me. Her form was majestic, but m hei eye there was a softness, which was not even dertm) ed by the severity of hci feehng " Einestus," weie her words, "heaven hasdtcieed at my prayer, that this crime shall ι be spared to you, you shall not aet ungratefully " — She seemed to va¬ nish with an expression of soi row upon he»face, as if she were not allowed to céMimie, and felt the hoi ror that bmst up*n me in consequence of the igno¬ rance 1 in which I was left My senses foïséófc'nie, and the dawn of day had al¬ ready pierced the thick clouds before I recovered. I did not return to my room, I went' ntw the open air, my thoughts were humeri, baffled, I was not subdaeoH jea-
lousy still was mot banished, "Γ did not rest upon · my mother's apparition, 'во strongly had the idea of Louisa's infide¬ lity taken hold of me. While walking amidst the intricate windings of a public garden, I heard voices near me. One was count Wilhelm, I heard him boasting ofthe fkvouisofsome lady, whom another thought loved him, and he suddenly presented himself before me ; I grossly insulted him. He took a pleasure in tor¬ turing me with his pretended concern at my inistt'ess's kindness to another. I struck him, we fought and he fell severe¬ ly wounded. I stood by him and he was amply revenged. He told me that he had seen me entering tlie preceding evening, that being at that moment, engaged in speaking about me, and Lotusa haying, expressed her wish that I might,,b& ( re» ceived into the Austrian servios, Ije. was offering his.intøres); to forwaţd my yjews, and ,tbat knqwdng how easily I.was, unta¬ teti, he,hadjpurposely taken Jier (wnd.
He advised me to fly, I was obliged to do so for I was no longer safe where I was. Louisa was then innocent. I cursed tliat-iate which seemed to hang about me, always shielding me from death. I had fought in battle, but never yet had re- iceivedthe slightest wound: I had escaped from prison while the axe was falling. My rashness seemed to be incapable of' ' hurting me; fbr there was a shield around me, that snatched me from peril. I was preserved from worse than death. Even this last act could not divide me from Louisa. She loved me indeed. Alarmed rať seeing my antagonist brought in ι wounded, she did not shriek ; she did not .give herself up to loud and weak lamen¬ tations ; but conscious, that probably my .life depended upon the event of' his wound, she sacrificed herself entirely to • the care of the invalid. With unremit- ,ting attention Bhe watched by his bed- -side. But when he was declared free from danger, then the cold hand oi
strengthened disease made itself felt. She was obliged again to return to her sick chamber* But first she begged her father to inform me of the favourable result. I returned. Doni met me on the stairs,—embraced me; but no joy was visible on his face. He announced to me the dangerous state in which Louisa lay, but did not reproach me ; she had forbidden it. I was introduced into her room. Consumption was ruining her system ; she was faint and weak ; her continued cough and the marked colour on her cheek, but too well denoted the power it had acquired. I couldnot even ask her how she felt ; but the tears fell down my cheek on the moist hand that held mine. She allowed me tb stay With her. Talked to me of' that power, whose ■pleasure it was to strengthen the' weak and console the wretched, she said that he had soothed the agony of' death's vi- siblei approach, and until she saw me, that ¡she htad found reliefin the thought
of the shoı t time we should be separated. But now she saw my grief, she was soiry I should be left alone, even for those few moments, without a being, to whom I was attached, that she again wished for life, if amidst all its miseries shecould buthope loi the powei of consoling me through these inflictions In line, she did not speak of heiself, but of me—ot the wretch wlio had gradually broken the weak threads which bound her pure soul to life. Count Wilhelm perfectly recovered, left us I had seen him, and as the only atonement in iny powei, had acknow¬ ledged my folly, and had begged he would pardon it, though it had been so severely felt by lum He ıetuıned а vague answer, and I saw hnn no moie. Dom's ınteıest was great, his wealth ınsuıed him fnends, active in bunging back to then neighbourhood one whose riches fell m beneficent showei s upon all. By their influence, lie soon obtained a paidon for my lemstance to the cıvıl au-
thorities in'behalf of Olivieri, and 1 was granted permission to return to any part of the French territory. As the cold Alpine air seemed to hasten the rapid steps of his daughter's decline, he deter- mined'upon having her conveyed again to the borders of the Lago Maggiore, which had seemed last year to have pos¬ sessed such renovating powers. We de¬ parted, and soon found ourselves fixed in our abode. Nature wore the same aspect as the year before. Palanza, with its white walls and glittering columns shone as brilliantly in the sun's ray ; the smile of heaven seemed to play upon the fairy islets of' the Boroméi, and the rich woods of' Belgirato reflected in the blue surface of the water, seemed to put the beauty of this in competition with the sub¬ limity ot' the wild rocks of the upper part ofthis long lake. But Louisa's health had faded. She could hardly hope, if the dis¬ ease continued its hasty steps to see these scenes again. But still that fairy enohan-
tei, hope, icted upon me, and as e ich day she gained some slight addition to her strength, I pictuied to myself years of happiness united w ith her I hid long so ardently loved She would not un deceive me, but left me the illusion She was again able to enjoy the fiesh ness of the an, and to walk out, itmdst the varying sceneiy around I suppoited her, and felt the light piessuie of hei feeble foim testing upon my um She would stop, and draw some reflections xm the bounty of God even while m pam, from the vinous pictures befoie liei , alwijs attempting to tum im mind towaids tliose thoughts, which she well knew could alone give mc consolation and a resting place m this vale of mtsenes But still she seemed to recovei strength Ientieited hei to hope and not to give way to such desponding thoughts Her fathei, who was deceived as well as myself, begged of hei to console herself, talked to hei when aloni, of me,
and spoke of his hopes of seeing us united, of hei forming the only prop to his old age, and that I, how could he say it 3 wis alone worthy in his estimation of receiving from a father's hand so great a treasure Unwilling to grieve her father, she yielded to my importunities, promised to be mine, if upon a ceitain day her ac quired stiength had not given signs of decay You may imagine with what anxiety, with what hopes I watched each intervening moment Every cold breeze made me shuddei, every cloud that veiled the sun s lay caused me pain I counted hei bieitlungs whenever she moved watched the hi mness of her step fhe day arrived She was not weaker, but had seemed to find lenewed energy in the thought of being mine She was mine I cannot pamt to you the deliri¬ ous stite of mmd, in which the next months passed over my head I had a right to protect I was something to that

Louisa was ni),—but I must ıe¬ late the whole Her heilth, as the winter approached declined again, anil we returned to Milin We lived with her fathei. To engage my wife's attention, I íe¬ solved upon fitting up a pai t of the pilice anew foi oui privite use. Evei) thing was oidered, when it occuned to hei th it the best oinament we could add woultl be the portiait of liei father I had le¬ covered fiom my sister oui mothei's locket, and shewing it to Louisi, we de teimined upon having it copied and hung opposite the Count's To give Doni, as as we thought an agreeable surprize, w t deteimined upon haying thein puvatel) executed, and placed in their situ ition
without lus cognizance. I sought for a pamtet, and spent ivhole mornings with lum at his eazel, dnecting him how to pamt my mother I described to him, as well as I could, her appeaiance to me at Inspruck, and pietendmg that I had seen her in a dieam, I insisted upon his lepiesentmg her m such a situation. He executed it, and by the magic effect of his pencil, excited a most extraordinary impi ession of awe in my breast, wheneverl tuined my eyes upon the picture She seemed stirting from the canvass, the outline ofher figuie was lost in the blaze of light, and her face, meek amidst splen¬ doui, severe, though with features natu- l ally mild, seemed speaking those woids I hadheaid. I took Louisa to see it, she felt the same awe as myself, though she could not assign a íeason for it, but she conti¬ nued gazing, till I perceived her eyes wet with tears. The pictuies weiepuvately intıoduced into the house. We had succeeded in
keeping them secret fiom Doni. In ,ι few days was Louisa's bnth day, we íe¬ solved theiefoie to make him oui guest upon that occasion in oui new apai tment. We invited seveial of oui most intimate friends. Eveiy thing passed m gaiety. At last, all the company wei e gone, and w e t e- mained alone. We then, taking him eich by one hand, led hnn into whit we in¬ tended should be oui pnvate sitting loom, telling him he should then see oui best fi lends, the one in heaven, the othei on eaith. The dooi was opened, di- lectly before limi was his own poitiait, he seemed stupiized and pleised, lit» tuined iound, I had haidly announced to him that the one he then saw vv is my mothei's, when he fell. Alai med wei,used him. "Лош mothei ' did you sij, youi mothei ■'" He threw hunself upon tlu flooi, and called upon God to fiee him fiom the consciousness of honoi like to hi». We knelt by him close togethei, he saw us, ıaısed his aged lunds, and
with v fluttering voice bade us, if we dieaded heaven's most dreadful curse, to sepaiate But again he fell to the giound, ciying, " It is too late, too 1 ite, the enmeis consummated " We ìauetl him, he tinned hastily iwaj, foi he was oppo¬ site the poi tint md besought us to tike hnn thence We led him to his chamba , he motioned us to leave hun Wt ι etu ed in silente, we knew not what to undeistand, wis it meiely the ţintii eiltet of Ihıl poi tt ait's powei which hul been excitid ovei us We could not hope it, we weie lost in con- lectuiis Louisa's health was so much biolven that I wis alaimed foi the effects it nn,lit have upon hei, and, theiefoie, tiove o tuin hei mind fiom the subject, but m v un She did not leep the whole night the tnxiety contei mug hci lithei woultl not allow hei to seek foigetfillness tven foi a moment lhe effect may be imagined upon so weak α constitution H.ei fathei lefused to see us íji sevei il

in silence ; he seemed absorbed in osee thought, and to that he could not give utterance. He took little, too little, noa. rishment ; but always occupied in writ*· ing ; he seemed but to find strength for that ; when we saw him, he was hardly capable of motion. His task was at last finished. We had been with him as usual, when we were suddenly recalled. He was dying; he bade us kneel down by his side, he blessed us. He took the tiaoers from his table, and putting them into my hands, ne m,n t .»„ „ 9|] tlKm when he was in the grave, and know the horrois that awaited me; he com¬ manded us to trust in God's mercy, and he sunk, blessing us, upon his couch, breathed no more.

I saw the Count laid in the vault of' his ancestors, and then returned to my wife's chamber, whence I never issued till I had no longer a wife. I L 3
was evident that all art was unavailing It was the undermining of а constiti! tion, not by а common bodily disease, but by the griefs of a heart that had never lately found a moment's respite from the most bitter inflictions Yet, even at this moment, she seemed to folget herself, m her attempts to con sole me She alone broke the silence around, I sat m mute despau , I saw Louisa before me, and I was to be left isolated, scathed by divine angei, without consolation «>- i»u .,.y nand, spoke to me of another world, for a moment her words would even subdue my grief, and let me feel as if that hope were enough At last, seeing the silent sor¬ row that was preying confined withm my breast, she sought to louse me, bade me ıead those papeis , I aid in а luckless moment, only hinted at the hoi nble mystery unfolded there, and saw the last convulsive throe I was destined to witness in any bound to me by love I cannot tell you moie , read that damning
tale, and then you may know what I daie, niy, daie not lest upon. My his¬ tory is quickly ended. I was diagged fiom the now lifeless Louisa, but I stole fiom my guaids in the night, gained an entiance mto the loom, where death showed, as if boasting his beauteous victim, dressed m pomp. The wax tapeis seemed to bum dimly, as if m unison with the solemn scene, the black walls, the felted giound, the corpse sti etched out, anayed in white, the still¬ ness visible upon that beauteous face, stilled even the tumult in my breast. She did not seem dead but asleep, I had held her in my aims, upon my bieast, looking as she then looked, I gazed upon hei foi moments, it seemed as if I believed the still appearance wronged my senses 1 was about to press her to my heart, my lips weie appioachmg hers, but I started, theie were two flies already revelling on those lips, and she could not chase them. I hurried away, I could not remain any L 4
longer there. I followed her bier also, pnel I saw my dearest, my last bond to this earth deposited theie, where peace seemed to invite me too. Religion, Louisa's words, however, had not lost att influence, I resisted that yvill, which vvOjiiliJ have led me to immolate myself a victim to the manes of those my love had sbjin. The hopes of a futuiity, of Louisa in heaven, upheld me. I retired first to Beatenberg, there in the former house of Berchtold, I spent some time : it was too near the first scenes of' rnemorj. I ^ e ft them and came hitfier ; here, amidst these rocks, bound to me by no memory ofthe past, I spend the ifew houis allotted me by heaven, in pe- nauce ; Here each day, my prayer is offered up, that in mereiy I might be taken to Louisa· My life has been a life of' an¬ guish, of' vice, of' ciime ; but still amidst these there have been moments, theie bas been a being, which, if life could be renewed, would cause me to dare all
agam, once more to go through those few moments Often in my dreame I see that form, but now, if when in this mort il life her beauty could not be de» scubed, how can I now, that her form, her face, are decked with the smile of him, who glories in the glory of his clul. dren When she now appears in my dreams, theie is no longei that hideous chasm opening between us , she is always decked as if for another bridal day, and I avvike confident in that day's approach without guilt But leave me, depart to morrow upon your intended journey, if that you stay, who knows but the curse which has attended me thiough life may yet be acting, and may fall upon you as well as all otheis whom I havı loved fliese papeis will explain to уед what I have withheld, the life of Dom ff that you ıeturn this way, you may find me dead Drop not a teai ovei my gı ive, I shall be with Louisa Farewell, but depart L 5
knowing that there exists a consolation, which man cannot take from you, which misfortune cannot destioy, the belief in a future state, in the mercy of a ledeemmg God. It is there I find ïef uge THE ΕΙΓΕ ОГ C0UN1 FILIBERTO DONI. The family to whicli I belong is one of the most noble in Lombardy , but I, being the son of the joungei bianeh, did not enjoy many of those advantiges which belong to high lank I wassent.it ι veiy early age to a college of Jesuits, ant! soon distinguished myself so mueh, that all the alluieinents the society was in the habit of holding out to )oung men of promise, were employed to attach me to this community. I had, howevei, been educattd amongst the mountains, and having been mused by an old letamer of the family, I had conceived »o high an idea of the importance and consequence
ittiched to nobility, that I could not ïesolve upon putting on a dress, which bound me to forego all those advantages mil pleasures the eaily associations excited by my nurse, had taught me to believe belonged to the entiy of a noble man into that veiy woild, my veneiable imstei endeavouied, in vain, to peisuade me, wis eveiy thing hornble In the mountains, ι son of even the lateral de¬ scend mts fiom the Loid, ¡»always looked up to with so much respect and veneiation by the pooi mhibitants of these distucts, th it it is no wondei if I was deceived When the leligious began to flattei and distinguish me above my companions, is I wis not conscious of any exeition in the acquisition of that mental supenoi ity ibout which they tilked, I ittnbuted llieu attentions to the respect they felt for one of such exalted ι ank, as I ima¬ gined myself bonito, hiving been left also foi the whole of the time with the inen, without having paid a single visit L 6
to my íamúy, the distant memoiiy oí what I had seen at home, appealed to me W contrast with the plain life of my su¬ periors, as something magnificent and passing compauson My parents, hearing of the talents of then son, weie anxious for· his entiy into an order, whose in¬ fluence they well knew tould be piofitable in the greatest degree, not only to the in dividual, but to the whole of his family When, therefore, they found that their son was determined not to bind himself by any bond which should hindei lum from enjoying, what his imagination had pictured, they thouglit the best plan in such a case was to allow me to view near¬ er, that misery which attends nobility devoui of riches I wa3 accordingly sent for home. I arnved— I was astonished at not being led to one oí those numerous pa¬ laces I met on my way to my father's, in the streets of Milan. My guide and myself came at last mto the Coiso , I be-
gan to íeconede myself, seeing the end of the city befoie me nothing but palaces on both sides, when suddenly, we tin ned down a naarrow stieet, and I came to the gate of an obscuie house I did not speak, but iny (teiings were hint I as ceuded a nanow staucase, and I found myself m the pi esence of my mothei She was lying on а couch coveied with leathci, dressed in all the dirty tawdiy of one who glories in the past, she was playing with a dog with one hand, while the other was stretched over an eai then- ware biazier A dirty servant, slip shod, with hair which had appaiently never been touched by a comb, led me into the room, and announced me My mother did not even move, she was too busily engaged by her puppy to notice me At last, tired of seeing only the same jumps, turning round m the act of stretching her weary hmbs, she saw iny figure, imagining it to be that or her son, she addressed her- self to me " Ah, Filiberto, so you are
really come home to loid youi parents with youi expences, when you might have become a jesuit with every pros pect of powei Well, we slnll see how your fathei will be u it Foi my pirt 1 will not sacnfice any moie first ìepie sentations foi youi follies I hio. iheidy engaged a box at the Scili, with the money I h id spaied from oui veiy food, when youi fathei, lieinngof it went mc! sold the tickets because you weie ex pected' These weie the hist woids, I îeniembei, my mothei sjioke to me 1 cannot descube to you the vanous feel mgs they excited in my breast I could not believe this to be my mother I did not answer her , but engiged in thought, I sat down, md soon lost sight of the white cold wills and buck flooi, in the bitterness of my imaginations My fathei entered, throwing oft his huge greit coat, which, placed upon his shoulders, coveied both his body and the clay vessel contain
ing the heated chai coil, he embraced me, and seemed really pleased to see me. I spent α miseiable day, foi it was the very one on whicli а new opeia was to be, brought out, and all the usual companions of my mother, having, by nitngue and whal not, seemed places, she was left alone without ev en hei cavalier set vente, in the company of hei husband and son : 'this was insupportable, and she did no¬ thing the whole evening but vent her bad tempei upon me, sneering at my foolish ideas of iánk. My fathei, who seemed accustomed to these scenes, quietly took his seat in a ıetlred pait of the room, and with his gieat coat confining the wai m au αϊ ising fiom lus icaldino around his body, soon fell asleep. The seivant came in aftei the Caffé, and spinning at my mothei's side, foi atune div erted liei at¬ tention fiom me, by joining with the com¬ plete appeaiance of an equil in ail that mean cuticism of then neighbouis, which is esteemed the moie witty ac-
cording to its ill-nature. I was at last glad to go to bed. Yon may imagine «tat was the bed '¡ют oť the son, when thereceiving room of the Padrona was such as I have described. As I passed by a door upon the stair* case, I saw two heads put out to look at me ; they were my sisters ; I cannot de¬ scribe to you the sensation I felt, when I found no one had thought it necessary to bring them to see their brother, or evert to mention them to him. I found them dressed in the most coarse clothes, and I had hardly been there a few minutes, be¬ fore they began recounting to me the hardships and privations they had lately undergone in consequence of' the anxiety of my mother to secure a box at the opetó fbr this night, it is useless to paint more· scenes of this nature; my mother was vain·, and spent even what should ' have been given to feeding her chüdretvin the most distant imitaţia» of the richi to whom she' had the honour of
being allied, and who condescended to laugh at her foi hei pains. My father lov ed quiet above all things, his income was small, very inoompetent to supply the foolish vanity of my mothei, he was theiefoie always m debt, and even oblig¬ ed to be α mean hangéi on upon the eldei biauch of the family. Next day I went with my fathei to visit the head of oui family, and I thpre saw wliatmyimagmationhadrepiesentedtome. The numeious sei vants seemed bustling about, as if then wills weie too rapid foi their limbs. The rich livenes, which were almost leflected m the burnished floors of maible and piecious woods, the porphyry columns, the fresco painfmgs, and the silken covenngstoeven the foot¬ stools astonished me. I followed щ sı- lence the officious seivant, who seemed amazed at my astonishment at that splen¬ dour, in whicli he had always bustled, though but the son of a cowheid. We weie conducted into the boudoir of
our relation. He was at his toilette, eveiy thing bieathed effeminacy, ill was luxtiiious, tin delicately colouied cui¬ taras let iu the enfeebled light of the noon diy When I enteied I could hardly distinguish the objects aiound, foi coming fiom iooms illuminated by allthe povveis of the sun, my eyes could not feel the weiket impiessmns of this veiled obscuuty. My ι elation struck with the astonishment I dis¬ played at such magnificence, amused himself with calling forth signs of wonder fiom me. I was invited to stay with lum, and I accoidmgly went from my mothei's, who was glad to get nd of the inconve¬ nience ai ising from the addition I caused to be made to the daily e\pences, at the same time that she was pioud of having to talk about the notice I had excited at the Palazzo Doni My relation conduct¬ ed rae every wheie I was intıoduced by hım to the casino of the nobles, and was always in Ins box at the theatie of La
Seal ι. He advised me to attach myself to an old countess, whose cavalier ser¬ íente w is just dead I did so, and soon had the honoui of canying her shawl, and whispeung m hei eai even to the exclu¬ sion of hei supeiannuated husband, at all the places of public lesoit I w as now initiated mto all the magic enjoyments of wealth and splendour. Without any nches 01 ment of my own, Ienjoyed all theluxunes νιΙι«κ»»οο»ι _ ι ..i^ netgntened by the visits I paid my fathei's house, wheie I saw poverty in its most appalling state, accompanied by pietentions to rank. I was intoxicated. The Countess had seveial daughteis, these I seldom saw, though they weie ipproaching upidly to womanhood It howevei happened, tlut soon aftei I had obtained a footing in hen house, that a birth-day of hei eldest chikl occuued. She íesolved upon cclebiatmg it by a httle ball, chiefly composed of the im¬ mediate connections of the family. I was
admitted by virtue of my office I had never before been in a ball-ioom. The splendid chandeliers, the gay diesses, and the beautiful women, sui rounding me on every side, ıaısed a scene before me, which even my most vivid fancy had nevei imagined I could not dance, I wis therefoie a mere spectatoi, but I was not idle, I had never been accustomed to see unmirned temates, n» u.,-, _,„ „„t admitted into the society to which I belonged. There appealed a chai m about them I could not define, they fixed my attention, ind as each moved in the light dance, with all the agility and grace attendant upon yo ith, while their retieitmg looks seemed to denote a fear that the) excited obser vation , I attempted in vain to discover what fascinated me. My heart beit violently, it seemed as if I had never befoie witnessed beauty Towards the end of the evening, a party of foreigners entered, they had come to reside in
Milan , with them was a young lady. She entered into the dances She had not the light any step of her companions, she had not the sain bnlhancy of eye, but theie was something so powerful in hei meek glance, in hei measiued giace- ful step, that enchained the senses. Fiom that moment I could gaze upon no one else. She alone seemed to be moving, she alone seemed to be the object worthy of attention. I was yet gating upon her, when the Countess called me to join her party at tie sette. I accompanied her, but it was in vain foi me to attempt fixing my mmd upon the caids befoie me. I saw nothing but that figuie which had been that moment before my sight. I made blundeis that called forth impatient exclamations fiom my partners, and I was at last allowed to rise upon the plea of a head-ache I instantly entered the othei room, but she was gone. She had however left her image in my breast* For several days I did not see- 4
hei again, but at last she began to appeal ш public, for being a foreigner, her pa¬ tents did not confine her as is customary amongst Italians. I often left the Countess in the Theatre, and placing myself in the pit, neai the box in which she was, watchetl hei slightest motion. Theie was а melancholy look about her that seemed to indicate ail acquaintance with g iet, that vvas extiaordinaiy in so young α peısoıı Hei daik blue eye was seldom unveiled, hei long modest eye¬ lashes geneially hid then splendoui, and hei silence, and hei unintei ested glance, added a chai m to hei figure I cannot desci ibe Her goodness and chai ity wei e spoken of by all, hei beauty was not envied 01 denied by her own, yvlule her gentle manners and winning smile, seemed to gain the heart of all the othei sex. I accompanied the Countess to bei house I sat by hei, but could not speak with hei. It seemed as if the emotion in my breast, stifled the words I was
ibout to uttei. She however noticed me, and hei pirents in repeating their compliments to the lady I pccompanied, included me m a geneial invitition to the house As it was not the custom foi hdies of lank to use until a late houi, I had a great pirt of the day upon my own hands. I used geneially to lounge about, and sometimes go to the Ambiosian Libiaiy, in quest of something to engage my at¬ tention One morning I was theie as usual, uul 1 found the Ernachs there. Matilda was with them, they w eie just then occupied in viewing the nianuscupt of Viigd, with Petiaich's annotations. When the Cieeione pointed out the last note of this lattei poet, in which he speaks of ins love to Lain a, I could not help ìemaiking, a momentaiy emotion which passed acioss the face of Matilda Hei mothei also observed it, ind imme¬ diately taking her ai m, accompanied hei into the room containing pictuies of
seveial of the greatest masters I followed them, and entered into conversation by pointing out the heads of the Milanese Raphael, which one cannot examine without feeling ι stillness come ovei oui senses foreign to oui natuie Ihere is so much beauty and heavenly quiet about them, that they indeed resemble îepie- sentations of a poet's dream Before we pai ted, I was accepted as the guide to the curiosities, which they had not yet seen, and my office was to begin the next day It is useless to describe to you the gradual steps of love I at last neglected the attentions due to the Countess, while sitting by the side of Matilda At last, no longer capable of endunng the feel¬ ings within my bosom, I confessed my love to the object I adored She was not angiy, nor did she seemed suipnsed, but in a voice that betrayed inward agitation, she begged of me to lay aside all hopes of gaining her hand, and conjured me not
to mention it to her father I was con fused and abashed I ıetlred and re¬ turned to the palace, wheie I confined myself to my chambei Not having ap¬ pealed foi se\eral days m society, md enqiuues being mide conceimng me, I wis soon sought foi by my kind relation lie seemed so anxious about the ill health, which he imigined was the cause ot my absence fiom those gueties in which I alw tys seemed to delight, that 1 w ıs induced to 1 ty open to him the w hole 11 mj heait He tned to idmintstei consol ition, but could not succeed, mj unity wis moitihed, and reflecting upon ny po.cit), I hid imagined that I wis despised loi some nchei uvil He seemed to know vlatiltl ι bettei, told me he could not believe it, but I dwelt so much upon the subject, tlut he siw it nas useless to oppose my opinión any longei He attempted to induce me to tecompany him into society, but I ie M
fused, and for some days remained alone m my chamber Sick with all the splendour around, which seemed to mock me, I deter¬ mined m spite ofthe expected reproaches ot my mother, to return to my father'» house, wheie by long confinement I fell ill. My kind relation hearing of this came to me, and tned to îepresent to me the folly of my conduct, but disap¬ pointed love and moi tified vanity, did not allow me to listen Seeing me thus haunted by the idea of riches, he gene¬ rously offered to advance me a consider¬ able sum, and to give me letters to a fnend at Alexandna, where I might he thought employ my capital to the gi eatest advantage m commeicial speculations. I thanked him, and accepted his kind ofiei. I soon left Milan, determined never to retuin till those nches were mine, which should enable me to assert a rank equal to any in my native city. I ainved at
Alexandria, and was soon engaged n meicantile speculations, with an eagei ness that caused all my tiansactioHS to appeal more like the ventures of a des peíate gamblei than tlie secuie project« of a merchant I found seveial Emo peans established in this city, chiefly eng iged in the commeice of gi nn Amongst the iest, theie was one who eemed to form α particular attachment to me , he was several yeais older than myself and was noted amongst us foi a ceitain avoidance of pleasuie which did not appear nituial to his yeais He was ilwiys engaged, when not occupied in Ins business, eithei in leiding 01 ш a so lit ny lamble through the buint neigh bouihood of tini mined town I was the only pei son he sought, he seemed to plice his confidence m me and made many enqun юь itfii st ν aguely, concei inng those I hid known it Milan Happen¬ ing to name the Li nichs, his face imme diately bec une mxioiis, ind his questions m 2
evidently boie a stamp of interest they had not before shown. This excited my attention and caused me to make moie paiticulai enquiñes concerning hnn. Little was known, he was a Gei man, and it was thought he had been disappointed in love. He peiceived the attention I be¬ gan to show him, and one evening when we weie alone, he told me tint he had at fiist been induced to seek mysociet), from a lettéi he had ι eceived fiora Matilda. " You must have perceived the ınteıest, with which I listened to youi account of the family of the Einachs, know that I love Matilda, that I have íeason to be¬ lieve my aflection ıs ıetuıned, but that owing to my poverty, I have never dared to confess even to hei the feelings of love I beai within iny breast. We weie togethei from eaihest infancy, all our pleasuies were in common, and though,when I giew to manhood, I no longer dared to use the famiuauty of my eai her yeais with hei, who began to vest the chaims of woman, fi
M ill wc partook m the pleasuies of each othei 's occupations Many things we studied togethei. I read the lighter au¬ thors of liteiature to hei while she was" engaged in those occupations attendant, in our country, upon every female member of a family. I at last opened Petraich, and read those sonnets m which love 1» s» delicately pourtiaytd. You cannot tonceive my emotions, when I perceived that she felt them as I did m)self, and that she often ι aised her modest eyes, while a blush mantled hei cheek, to gaze upon me, while my trembling voice seemttl not to be reading the sentiments ol anothei, but speaking the feelings oí m) own bı east. We seemed, indeed, not to want to comment upon what we weie both sensible c\piesstd only those tiuths which echoed in the bi easts of both When, howevei, I îetiied, I always up- biaided m)self foi thus exposing, though niduettly, tnat love, of which I had no íeason to thmk hei paients would ap¬ ai j

Hovv shall I convey to you an idea of what pissed in my mind' Before me tood the unconscious cause of my being ι ejected by Matilda He had told me, he loved hei, that she loved him I was silent when he ended, I could not rouse myself to speak to him , he, thinking that his nan ation had tired me, made an apo¬ logy, to which I could only inswei by monosyllables, he ıetlred and left me to my own thoughts It was evident Matilda piefeired another My feelings may be imigined,—cannot be descnbed. It seemed as if some demon actuated me, I fell upon my knees, and dared even to ,,ιΐΐ God to witness my vow of obtaining the object of my affections, in spite of all obstacles It seemed as if I felt moie at peace aftei hivmg thus íesolved upon not yielding even to him she loved, the j ossession I imbitioned 1 sought Huldebiand, for so was my rival called, deteimined to woi m into ins confidence md gam the whole of I is ы 4<
seciet. I told him not to impute my .ılıştı action on the foimei evening to any thing but my mind bemg engaged m thought upon a cucumstance, which I noticed at Milan, and whith was now fully explained. I then mentioned to him the emotion I had notited in Matilda's countenance, while listening to the me- moiial of Petraich with ıegaıd to the diuation of his love. This immediately seemed his attention, and I soon learnt many circumstances with ıegard to their eaily years, and I became convinced, that there was really no engagement between them. In the mean time my speculations, which had been begun rashly, had for the gì eatei part turned out badly, and I found myself with а capital considei ably dimi¬ nished Huldebrand who could not it mam ignorant ot my losse» proposed to me, as I seemed ignorant of the best means of securing a piofitable commeice, to join him. I did so, but gi owing tired of lhe sluw advantages to be obtained by
the regular channels, I at last induced him to join me in a speculation that seemed to promise a cei tam and at the same time immense piofit. We ventuied, and lost ill we usked. My loss did not gueve me much, foi it had ι educed my Matilda's favouied lover to the same want as myself. He wis not howevei dismayed, nor did he ıeproach me, but lmmedntely exerting himself to recover all that icmained of om pioperty, he pro¬ posed, that we should join some Aımenı- ans, who weie about to leave Alexandria and penetrate into the mteııoı of Asia, in hopes of finding some opportunity of betteungoui small fournies Iconsented, mid yve accompanied them We enteied Pensia, and tiavelled even .nto Indu. We soon found oui capitals ıapıdly mcieasing, foi, imitating the Ar¬ menians, we bought upon seveial occa¬ sions piecious stones, which yve lesold almost immediately greatly to our advan¬ tage. It is, in no vvay necessaiy foi me to M 5
give an account ot these counti ies, to¬ wards the undei standing the fatality that attended my life. I travelled through thein caieless about the scenery or inha¬ bitants ; the whole of my attention waa engaged in my endeavouis to acquile wealth. Matilda stood constantly befoie me as the bride of Huldebrand, and my father's house always appealed m con- tiast with the palace of the head of our family. I soon entered into the spirit of the traffic 1 was engaged m, and restrained as I was by Huldebrand's steadiness, we rapidly indeed accumulated an immense sum, which we carried always vvith us in piecious stones. 1 had been pai ticularly struck by the venerable appearance of one of our com¬ panions, he was aged, his head was white with the numbered yeais that had passetl sincehisbiith. This was the moie ìemaik- able from the contiast it offeied with the jet black ban and beards of his coun¬ trymen. He was never engaged m
their occupations, he nevei seemed to be conceined in any mercantile tian¡>- action, yet he seemed to be tn eless of his money, which he gave piofusely to all. He seemed to delight in the society ol stiangeis, and theiefoie sought ours, but Huldebiand not speak¬ ing his language did not gun the same hold of Ins iffettions as myself, he indeed treated me completely as his son, and often duected me in the conduct of oui concerns, his idvice wis always advantageous This strangei seemed to look upon me as his pupil, and he giidually tuined my mind to the objects nound me But he did not improve my hent by the open¬ ing of my mind He was himself ex¬ tremely uch, when theiefoie he held foith upon the happiness of contented poverty, I thought he wis but a meie visionai y, imagining the Arabian delights of a sandy desert, while shaded by the «.anopymg foliage of a giove, and sui- l ounded by all the riches of a cultivated n 6
countiy I looked aiound, and I saw the genius and the itleot both equally subsei - vient to the will of the wealthy. I saw urtateti odden undei foot, and vice, that monster in lags in the cottage, adored as a goddess in the temples of the gaudy palace. Wheievei I went, it seemed as if gold, iu the bustling of the w hole ol life, had the sime effect as a few aspeis thiown amidst the obstieperous ciowd that immediately leaves off its hideous j ell in haste to sciamble for the miserable gain. Riches weie a thirst upon me 1 could not believe that Matildi or Ei nach, her father, could lesist the splendoui of wealth But Huldebnnd was with me, half oui common piopeity was his He loved —was beloved Whenevei I looked upon him, шу heait did not beat quickci, it seemed foi л moment to pause, as if his »ıglıt blisted its vitil action, but it beat again with îedoubled violence, when Matilda's image lose upon my mind, and my foimer vow was again ι epeated.

bound that fell fi om his lips, seemed the mnouncement of his bequest, but he was silent on that subject. Five days elapsed, at last the sixth was passing, and his stiength was evidently ïapidly failing, his bieath became hur¬ ried, and his eyes began to lake that lustre, whicli seems to be the last exertion of the depaiting soul, he then spoke, " I wished," he said, " that my life had been spared but a shoit time longer, I could then have bestowed wealth upon you, without thecondiţions that mijjnowstartle you. Know, but how dare I tell it ? you may look upon me with honoi, and while I am wishing to bless you, may tui n away f ι om me I have a pow er that is supposed to bnng the cuise of the Almighty upon it, I can, — I luve the power of raising л spuit from the last abyss, and make him lay at my feet, the infinite wealth endo. sed within the eaith's íecesses But if you would listen to one aged, who has home tins blasting power from early youth, you
would refuse the dangei ous gif t. Foi thei e ıs a condition necessarily bound to that power, which will undoubtedly quell your ardent longing even foi nches." It was in vim that he addiessed me thus, Matilda and wealth connected lose to my imagi¬ nation. I pressed him to explain himself. He did. He told me that either I could only call for a certam sum at а time, and thatat each time, some human domestic in¬ fliction, worse than the preceding, would fall upon me, or that, I at once, could gain unlimited power, and constant do¬ mestic prosperity, on the condition of giving myself up foi ever to the will of a malignant being. He had chosen the first, had called but once for the exertion of the demon's power, but his happiness had been withered by that once. I did not hesitate, I laughed in my own mind at domestic happiness, I had lived only m Italy, and m the East, I begged of lum to disclose his seciet, he did. I bound my¬ self to the fiist condition.
1 impatiently rose, I left the old man upon his dying couch, and retreated to my own tent. I raised the spuit, his hideous form might have appalled a stiongei heait than mine, I trembled, but his mocking laugh subdued my feais, and bending my knee, I acknowledged him as my supene thiough life. 1 cannot descube the scene, Icould not without recording some pait of the spells by which I raised this monster, and he has but too fully proved bis powei lor me to be willing to put the least clue into the hands of any one which might bring the curse I have felt upon him. Beside» riches, I gained other powers, but these are not connected with ) ours and my Louisa's fate, I shall not speak of thein. I letuined to the sick man's tent, I'm Aimeman was dead. I did not feel soiry, how tould I at that moment ; I was exult¬ ant, my wealth was so enoi mous, I did not »ее a possibility of spending it. The next diy the lobbers buned my benefaetoi m
the burning sands. I proposed a ransom fbr myselflo the Arab, he insisted upon my accepting my freedom. I did, and we eat together ; no longer fearing trea¬ chery, Imadehim a presenttoan enormous -.'mount. He was sui prized, but did not make even the smallest enqtiiiy. I roamed about the encampment, fbr 1 was desiraus of' seeing these robbers in their native barren plain. While wander¬ ing about their black tents, I heard a vpice of' pain issuing from one of' the most miserable. It was Huldebrand, he was calling, in the delirium of a fever, fbr a drop of' water to allay »his thirst. The well was close to me. The tent was open, no one was near, he was extended upon the sandy floor, vvith hardly any clothes to defend him from its hot touch. I, even I, could not resist this appeal, I seized a vesse) lymg by his side, and drew it from the well full. 1 was turning towai ds hmi 5 when suddenly his tones altered, he seem¬ ed to press liis breast, while in the softest
woi ils he addressed some one. I ap¬ proached, he was imagining Matilda stood by him. The words sounded on my ear, -τ-" I know, Matilda, that you love me." The pitcher fell upon the sand, and'the water was drank up by the burning dust, and I turned away with a raging heart, fiom the dying Huldebraud. I instantly determined upon leavingthe spot. The noble Arab escorted me to the utmost boundary ofthe desert, and I was safe from danger. I hired camels and horses, and proceeded to Aleppo, spreading every where that I was a mer¬ chant, who had been very successful in my speculations. This was easy to me, for I could refer to people with whom I had had transactions, and my name was known. I hustened to Italy, and soon leached Milan, I entered with all the pomp of riches ; I will not describe my entry, it was foolishly splendid, nor will I attempt to paint to you the daily display I made of some new folly ; they were pro.
duced by the intoxication of a madman Matilda, for she held no less a powerful influence over me than my avarice, was the object of the whole I found liei health much decayed, she had not heard or Huldebrand foi more than two years Yet theie was peihaps a greater chai m in that pale cheek and 1 íťiguid eye, than I had found m the delicate colounngof the one, 01 the splendour of the othei If I could gam her lov e now, it would, indeed, be an ample compensation for her formei rejection. I began byspieadmg the íepoit of her lover's death, though I was not certam of the fact, yet I thought, at any iate, that he could not ie appeal so soon as not to allow rne time to accomplish my end. I then went to bei father's, and ма the course of the conversation an¬ nounced it. Matilda was inconsolable, but she took pleasure in my society, for I could talk tb her of Huldebiand, I related mdifter ent particulars concerning him, the eager-
ness with whioh she listened leached my heart, I determined, howevei, to endure even these pangs, lather than lose the opportunities afioided me of sitting by her side. As in the couise of naira- tion, I intıoduced the relation of actions m which I bad been his benefactor, she blessed me foi it. I felt like a baffled demon. I gradually began to talk of myself. I sounded the father and mo¬ ther with regard to a mauiage ; obtained their full consent and appıobatıon They giadually bioke it to then daughtei. She wondered at my seeking for a widowed heait ; insisted upon my tak¬ ing some months to considei of it, while she herself fulfilled the term of mourning she thought due to her lovei's memory. I was anxious, and fearful of Huldebrand's appearance. I piessed my suit with earnestness, my ıelations, her father, her mother, used all the arts of persuasion to induce her to anticipate the day. She did, and we weie married.
,, It now seemed as if' 1 could dare the world. I had Matilda, had wealth, the onlyobjects mymjndhad ever rested upon were mine. I had two children, Louisa and Olivieri. You cannot imagine the splendour in which I lived. Where could the mortal be found who had greater supposed sources of' happiness than mine? yel I was miserable ; Matilda was mine, my wife, but her affections still rested upon the image of' my rival. I tloated upon her ; it seemed as if' the price of guilt I had paid bound her the moie to me, as if she were to form the only hap¬ piness I was to know, and she did not love me. She differed entirely from my countrywomen ; she enjoyed her domestic circle, she was modest; and while she stood amongst the abandoned wantons, who formed the only society around her, she stood erect, as if' she were sent by Heaven to show deluded men the beau¬ ties of the virtues they despised. , I had not enjoyed the society of' my
wife more than three yeais, when my momentaiy happiness was blisted Ma¬ tilda came home one day, as I imagined, fiom the Coiso, fluined and violently agitated She thiew herself upon the sofa, and lost m thought, she did not per¬ ceive that I was near her She diew fiom her breast ι note I could see o\er 1 er shouldei , it struck me that it was Huldebrml's hand wilting She seemed to look upon it as if she could not believe hei eyes She л lewed it, hei hands fell, and the mov ement of the eyelids ov er the fixed eyes seemed to denote the beUef m ι deceit of the senses Hei bieath was still, her cheek pale, she did not move 1 unavoidably discov ered myself, she lui ned, looked it me, and the tear, bin sting fiom hei eyes, ι oiled down hei theeks, as she lushed out of the room I dai ed not follow her Huldebrand might be stalking in my veiy house, might be close to me, his woids of reproach nu s ht be ılıeady in the an, prepared N
to damn me with their sound I should Ъе proved in the world's face, a liar, a wretch without a spark of geneiosity, of gratitude, in Matilda's face — I hid my. self in my chamber, foi the conscious ness of my guilt caused me at first to wish for concealment But the thouglit of my rival roused me, wa» it not pos sible to remove him ? I rushed out of my room, and was upon the point of going through the great gate, when I perceived a figure descending the staircase, wiapt closely in a large mantle It was α woman —it was Matilda Her hui ι ied step and anxious glances thrown around caused me to watch hei She went out into the stieet, I followed her, there was an obstacle near the theatre, she cleared it, but I lost her in the crowd of canin^es In vain I tried every opening leading to the theatre I could not recover a trtcp of hei At last I was obliged to lean exhausted against the wall, and Ernacb, her father, coming from the
theatie, discovered me. Perceiving my agitation at sight of him, he insisted upon escorting me home. He attempted to lead me to explain to him the cause of my trembling limbs, which weighed upon his arm. He did not know that ha sought to know my shame, I insisted upon his leaving me, and I at last fell ex¬ hausted upon a chair m my saloon. I know not how long I had remained in this situation by myself, I at last heard Matilda's light step ascending the staucase I did not move, my eyes re¬ mained still gazing on the giound when she enteied. At sight of ine she started, but she commanded heiself— appioached me with a faultéi ing step. I attempted to clasp hei to my bosom, as if— I know not what passed in my mind She re¬ tieated. "You have a ught to know wheie I have been in this clandestine mannei." I hid my face with my hands, I was conscious she had been to see Huldebiand. She had been with bim,
she would say no more. I threw iny self at her feet, she turned away. " I can no longer even esteem you," were the last words she said, when she left me. She went out several times in the course of next day ; once I attempted to follow her. She perceived me at the door : " Filiberto," she said, " seek not to pursue my steps, I am but active in the Cause of' virtue. Retire and leave me. You must be aware of what hangs over your head. Would that heaven may grant I could avert it from my husband, my children's father." I was left in a state of mind that bordered upon phrenzy. I rushed out ofthe house, and turning my steps another way, I did not return to¬ wards niy home till night. When I did re¬ turn, I found every thing in the greatest confusion. There was a carriagewith post- horses at the gate. The moment I ap¬ proached, my valet came to me to tell mê of ray shame. Matilda had been seen leaving Milan, with a gentleman in
hei company. I jumped into the car¬ nage, and followed upon the road they were lepoited to have taken. I did not speak dunng the whole time, I did not listen, though my servant, hav¬ ing enteied with me, was telling me more of the circumstances. Night and day I tiavelled in pursuit. I seemed to be gaining on them. I at last ovei took them just as I was entering a village μι Savoy. They were upon the point ď leaving it, I sprung out of my carnage, and with the speed of a demoniac I ran after them. In my furious haste, I fell. I did not attempt to rise, but instantly fired, my wife's shriek was heard they, however, drove on When my carnage with fiesh hoi ses overtook me, my servant tried to raise me, I had dislocated iny ancle. Blood, my servant told me, could be traced upon the road, as if it had fallen from my wife's carriage. I could but look upon myself as Matiltla's murderei, the shrjek was her's. My n d
emotions and feelings were so violent and Various it would be impossible to por¬ tray them. The demon's power was upon 'míe, and his curse proved a bitter one. I was conveyed home, where I was for a long time delirious ; I became calm but nbt less miserable. My attendants then gave me a letter, which had been found upon my wffc'o dressing table, after my departure in chase ofher. ."he was inno¬ cent, she had not fled with huldebrand, but with her father. Huldebrand had upon that condition agreed to conceal my crime, my shame. She had left her home, her children ; had sacrificed her own to shield my name from infamy. I did not at this intelligence relapse into the violent ravings I had undergone. I sunk into a state of apathy, whence nothing could rouse me. I refused even to see my idhildren, and hardly ever leaving my chamber, I spent the night and day with iähdrt intervals to self-reproach in combat-
ing inflictions of the mind more dreadful than any corporeal penance of the holy anchorite Many years had thus passed, I had, not once seen my childien, not even heard of them, foi I would speak with no one. I al last saw them by accident. You know Ohvien's violent chaiacter. He had con¬ stantly enquired aftei me, always baffled by the sei vants in his wish nf sewing me, he at last seized his opportunity, but Louisa had watched lum, and they both appeared in my sight struggling with one another, for she was trying to hindei his disturbing me. If Matilda heiself had stood before me she could not have affect¬ ed me moie , for Louisa, though her fea¬ tures are different, her eye dark, has the expression that gave such powei to her mothei's looks, playing upon her face She at last, no longer capable of ïesistmg her brother, threw herself at my feet, and earnestly begged me not to be offended with her dear Olivieri I took her to my N 4
■ırmş From that moment I was aiousetl I could not leave m) daughtei, but gave ар аЦ my time to the education of my children, but I brought mothei cuiae upon niy head, foi I neglected Olivieri , except m his hteiaiy studies I did not assist him, Ins mmd was allowed to be biassed by any one who chose to tiouble themselves with acting upon him. Louisa on the contrary was my constant com¬ panion, she rewaided my care You know her, if ever a wretch like me might have hope, it must be m the prayers such a bemg can offer up for me to the throne of heaven. After some time I pioposed journeying through the different countries of Eu¬ rope, to show my children the different peculiarities of nations. We had already entered Switzerland when my son left me I had been accustomed to his often quitting me for days together, and hard¬ ly noticed his departuie. Louisa and myself proceeded to the different spots
ieniin kable foi then beauty or sublimity. On -the Wengein Alp we saw you. We soon aftei hen d daily of the feats of Finestus Beiehtold and Obvien. I don't know why, but the thought of the cha- mois hunter we had seen being this Ei¬ nestus, hist stiuck my daughter, and I soon joined in the belief. A lettéi from Olivieri appointed Ir tei taken as the place of meeting, we .vent there Events in which you weie concerned biought us agam to Milan. The unniPusP riches I had obtained fiom the spuitiindermy command, though much diminished, were y et more than suf¬ ficient to maintain us in sufficient splen¬ doui, not to feai any thing like a compe¬ tition. But Olivieri and youiself were gamblei s Louisa foiced me again to risk an infliction equally seveie as the last, foi your sake. I could not resist her piayers for you. I agam called the spuit fiom his immortal haunts, and Ohvien's infamy was the consequence. Your debts had
pfOved so enoimous, that m my attempt at saving lum fiom an ignominious death, }. was again obhged, though I knew the horrible powers of the demon, to call upon bim. I did so. He announced to me that I had exhausted my spells, and that aftei this infliction, as nothing round me would remain, on winch be could breathe his pestilential breath, he would no longer obey my summons. I called upon him to take back his gold, he laughed and left me. I had no suspicion of Oh¬ vien's seiluction of your sısteı , when therefore his letter was put into my hands, you may imagine how your noble conduct affected me I did not speak of it, for what could a father say 5 Must I even acknowledge it to you, I sometimes rested upon it with a feeling of consola¬ tion, for I hoped, that cume of my son's might be the infliction upon his fither, meant by the demon as passing all others. Louisa I thought might then be spaied, and you two might at least be happy.
But you mained, I dreamt of happi¬ ness, on Louisa's birth-day accompanied you to your room, and the demon's thieat I found had indeed been fulfilled. Youi mothei's portiait was Matilda's. Obvien had seduced, you minted a daughter of Matilda, of Matilda's husband, and I was the műidéi"! of hei father.

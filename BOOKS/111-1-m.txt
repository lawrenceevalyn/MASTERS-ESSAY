WILD IRISH BOY.
To Miss E . St. Clair, Dommick Sireet, Dubba. MY DEAR CHILD. When an old maiden aunt puts on her spectacles, and takes up her pen. it is said there is no getting her to lay them down. I should be sorry to lay them down without having employed them to some purpose ; for the effort has been suf¬ ficiently painful to me. 1 really do begin to feel the latitude of old age and seclu¬ sion stealing over every part of me, ex¬ cept my aflcctions. These, my dear, are, I think, as strong towards you espe¬ cially as they have ever been, from the moment that my first tears fell on your orphan face. You were the child of pa¬ vor* 1 υ
rents very deir to me—>ou are verv dear tome yourself—too dear perh-tps. My afľeítioi.s should begin to loosen in their hold and interest in carthîv thing*. But of all earthly thing*, ^щ and \our pre¬ sent situation are the mobt interesting. You ha\e just approached the entrance into life—or, what is called life, that ь, a sudden immersion i.to its worst parts, A few years pa^ed iu a convent in France, followedb\ a few more in aretired part of the country with your uncle and me, í a clergyman and his sister ) and those altogether so fcic, (you are only sixteen) have funned a contrast rather than a pre¬ paration to the life )OU are entering on — the gaieties of a city in its gay season. My dear, do not construe this into a childish solicitude about inferior objects ; I am not going to gne you a lecture about, earl v hours and flannel petticoats. Ohi my dear child, my hopes and fears about you have never been satisfied
with the objects of this life : Could I be so, I should have little to dread When I look at you, I see youth, feeling, genius, and—no, not beauty—but some¬ thing ten thousand times better t ha® beauty in the eyes of men—and woraeo too. But then there is a balance—a fatal balance to all this—a modern uesigner would make it the brightest tint in the piece—in mv eves it U the only shade. You have a terrible portion of what is called, I believe, sensibility, by people whose business is to teach us to - commit the oldest sins tbe newest kind of vvavs' — di fièrent writers will give òjìVrent defi¬ nitions of this quality. An old maiden aunt I fear would call it—an habitual misapplication of the good and evil of life—a reject ion oí the good, till the good has '/ep./r/e7/™and a contempt of the evil, tiii the evil ha« arrived I am not speaking of this qua¬ lity exercised on the trivial parts of life— в 2

who has indulged this fatal state of feel¬ ing, discovers a certain defection in his own powers of living beyond human life, a certain sensibility of common evils, and a subjection to common accidents, to ill-health and misfortune, and indigence, that " sickles o'er" the rich colour¬ ings of passion, with the pale ca j -t of humanity. The consequences are dreadful, a total and hopeless dejection overshadows the mi id : it is not as in other cases, where a discovery of deception is a security against future evil : no, all discovery is too late, it cannot renew a broken frame of mind, as it cannot repair tbe ruined fabric of life and happiness, over whose fragments it is yet more delight ful to ihe suíľerer to linger and wail, thxn to erect an humbler and safer structure of materials, such as common life supplies, and such asaObrd conferí and bhcUer to
those who expect no more from any "earthly habitation/' Comfort is yet perhaps in their power, but comfort they have always despised, and those that sought 'd, and their con- tempt is now aggravated by that natural pride of disappointment, that scorns to divide or palliate evil. Rapture or de¬ spair was their choice of life, and their choice seldom leaves them more than the latter alternative. The rest of life is wasted in fretful repinings, or solitary gloom, iu unpitied complaints of evils of which they will not see the cause, in a black and splenetic deprecation of life in which they will see no good, be¬ cause it did not afford tliem that i*ood 4. which it cannot afford to man. But example is sai i to be umre pow¬ erful than precept: 1 will give you an example the mes! m niv memory and con¬ viction— I mea u my ov\ :*.. At an age vv hen I had at least the Hi a * v of vouih ( fifty b4
years ago) I received my first proposal ; it was from a gentleman who wooed me like a man and a Christian. He talked of life as having many foils and trials, lie said he wished to have a companion in the one, and a support under the other ; that his temper had many infirmities, nor did he believe mine to be without them, all human tempers had them; that he ex¬ pected no supernatural heart and cha¬ racter from the influence of passion, no transformation of life into a (f primrose path of dalliance" by the magic of fan¬ tasy. But, he said, he expected a gra¬ dual and benignant amelioration of life, from mutual instances of sacrificed sel¬ fishness ; from the progress of confidence, from the memory of kindness, and the habits of affection; above all, from the influence of religion, which he described us having power like the prophet's wand to heal the waters of bitterness with \yhìc)ì life over/lows.. I acknowledge I
heard him with disgust—perhaps, be¬ cause my sense of hearing and all my other senses had been perverted by a young man, who had at least enough to please the eye and the ear, that loved to listen to romanee —I cannot exactly remember the style in whicli it was usual for men to talk to women sixty years ago, but I knovv it was not in that cold anatomical way of love-making which seems the fashion of this philosophic age. My favoured lover had no forlun»*, but he snoke to eloquently of the stimulus, and the sup¬ port that passion gives to industry, of ihe chearfulucss of his toils, of the delight of success, or the consolation of ùìs- appointment, that I hardly thought I had any merit iu sacrificing the promise of life to the invitations of a pas-ion ъо pure and lofty ; so much what I had taught myself to expect, and I::.d been told I could inspire.

wane oflife, without the possibility from external as well as internal causes, to form another connection, to «v moldou another stay for n.v deceived and tot¬ tering st'*ps. I had hut one motive to live, it was to atone to the author of life, for the criminal abu^e of ils best part, for theprcversion of gifts, which, had í learnt the usesof them from religion, would have engaged his approbation, and recured my own felicity. The power that taught me this, taught me also the value of what remained. About this time мшг u.iclc, who was my favourite brother, vvrs promoted to a deru«rv in ire- land, and invited me to that country with him. I did not despise the happiness that was vet within mv reach ; i sought it İn tranquillity and retirement, iii the scrutiny of my conscience, and the purification of my heart.

I was compelled to break off—my feel¬ ings have been elevated, but not above humanity ; yet you are perhaps at this part of my letter, demanding why I ha¬ rass \our feelings and my own, by an exhibition of distress which you neither fear nor deserve; you are asking what reason can there be for apprehensions which nothing» relai ine; to vou nas vet suggested. Ah ! my dear, every thing relating to vou suggests an apprehension tome—your frame and habits of mind. your studies, your early solitude, and sudden Ľansitiou to a <cene of ^lute and gaiety, vour being of the Romi/d reli¬ gion (a religion w ho h İ fear allows (no much of the language of passion ť> its professo/*) —but we are never to Kuk to the prominent features of bfe for the causes of the events tlu*i occ r in it.

fess I dread more than all I have mention¬ ed your orphan state, and the mystery that hangs over your birth, a mystery so congenial to a romantic mind, which loves to believe that life, from its com¬ mencement, has been marked with select and uncommon features in their behalf. I ever dread the romantic name your mo¬ ther gave you, which though I suppose common in France, no one in this country can hear without believing herself more than half the heroine of a tale. I am full of this subject, but I will try rather to say what ought to be said, than can be said. Whatever tempts you to act in the greater emergencies of life, from im¬ pulse rather than deliberation, mnd he wrong, I must here insert a passage from vour uncle's last sermon. He was speaking of the modern philoso¬ phy—" The distribution it makes of tbe different powers of the u/md, appears eminently injudicious— it murts tlie
places both of feeling and reason— reason appears assigned to man tø be ex¬ ercised at leisure, to assist him iua de¬ liberate comparison of things, and enable him to determine bis preference or rejec¬ tion of them. While feeling appears al¬ lowed him, to interfere in those cases where to consult reason is impossible from haste or from emotion, and suggest, with a promptitude and energy which the occasion demands, that conclusion which a balance of opposite probabilities would suggest, were there time for such a ba¬ lance. Life abounds w ith such case 0 ; no man has time for debate amid the rage of a volcano, or the horror of a siege—on such au occasion, to act from the impulse of the moment, under its most sudden and arbitrary suggestions is to act justifi¬ ably and rationally.

JANE ST, CLAIR. P. S. Don't answer me, my dear, 1 did not write to be answered—but let no¬ thing interrupt your correspondence with your cousin Martha Gore; she is one for whom I have the greatest regard ; she is the daughter of the man whoso ad- dresses my folly rejeeted, who afterwards married my younger sifter, with whom she lived many years of rational happiness
and progressive esteem. There is about your cousin Martha, a facility, a placid and pliant spirit, that eminently qualifie« her for a confidant and correspondent. I am an old woman, weak and irritable, and querulous; but she is all concession and gentleness, though her concessions never are extended to her principles, and her gentleness never debilitates her under¬ standing, Deaiiry, November IS.

I
have conceived a character that I wish had never existed—a young, a very young person, almost a boy, with the form of a girl, and tbc feelings of a man; uo, not of a man, with more modesty, more freshness, more retirement and timidity, and youthfulness of mind, than men, men in the world, can have. How fair, Oh ! how fair, beyond the promises of humanity, are the promises of such a life ; and, at its \ery entrance, ardent in untried sensibility, and profuse of af¬ fections that seem given in excess, to meet with the usual events and charac¬ ters, the common train of temptation and vice, the weak and the worthless and the debasing society, but which tempts the young wanderer with the Circe-cup of riot and transformation ; one to whom the call to pleasure sounds like the call of friendship, who follows the invitation of vice, because he loves tbe friendliness of its tone ; who is betrayed by the very
affections that promi 1 him happiness, because he trusted without suspicion, and loved without defect ; and such a one, so soft, so warm, so touching from contrasted virtues, and ill-suited circum¬ stances ; trusting with such bclplesMie*«, and vet feeling with such force and fire ; submitting to vice, yet aspiring after virtue; unwillingly uudonc, and bearing tbe melancholv splendor of his original I f? brightness through chwid and mUt. And he might have been so happy, and thev mbht have had other vidinis. There arc so many eouunon-plaee heads and hearts, who would noer have be¬ trayed the struggle of grace and pavdon, never would have been disfigured with the wreck of worth, and the spoils of a lovely natine. Is it possible to think of such a one w ithout .... I че ill noi see his ruin ; no, iìnd Ì am reso 1\ cd on, 1 could not witness his utter ruin. I will hide mvseif ia ьоте convent, some convent

He is much older, and has the hold, broad front of unredeemed dep. avity. I heard of the groupe when I first came. I wish 1 had never s*en him.

I can bear to meet his eye, were it half withdrawn, or shaded by the eye-lid ; 1 could gaze on it for ever ; hut the touch must he felt but once in life—Could he have felt mc tremble !—He turned, that was too much.

One in the Morning· I am just returned from the theatre ; induLon'c make> us bold. L joined the ^ l' family «o *ïl\ there, because ï thought·—- 1 will ot *t«l vou what 1 thought. Y\ by is t her «· dlwav·, about a theatre, a kind of dai 'ng lev, ť v, of allowed and familiar looseness, more t ban about any other as¬ sembly? The men go back« Л forward« in
the dress of the morning, and appear em¬ ployed iu any thing but the employment of the place. I know not why, but ï always feel myself less timid, le*s cold, le>s a female in this place than in any odier. The glare, aud the beat, and f he noise, harden the senses, perhaps infiame them, perhaps-—no matter for the philosophy of a theatre. From tbe moment I entered, I felt an ехрсСча/оГ* which I knew would be realized Th» intelligences of love are unerring. He entered about the third act. like oue who had ripeti from a lale iik-ome dinner ; his cheek w аз dark, aud Lis eve restless. I io )ked at him with fondaci and agony. in a ft w moments in quitted the oppo¬ site side of the home, and came into the very box where I was fitting. He knew «ome one on the row behind me, and shr* took care that her knowledge of him *hould beobserved. Ih i* a thing to m :l*e m woman vain, Ibnv t^uld 'he sp^ak ^
at brr ease, while I could hardly breathe from the moment I felt his presence—felt —for I dared not see him. I could nei¬ ther turn nor look. I was as one watching the sleep of ciHtanfmcnt which a motion would break. There is no pleasure in having him so vry near; it is a state too breathless, and fearful· arid exquisite, Butto watch for the tones which broke upo« ¿h¿-;4!¿ noise uboüt inc. from time to time, like the song of the water- spirit amid the bubble of ihe brook; to watch lor iht^e indistinct sounds from which ì tried to srucss bis motions, a:;d think whether wc leant r.gainst the same o:»rt itiön— this, and a thousand devicts ei' joy and pain I practised, till the '.n'!v ^»i'vid, as women will talk, some- • king t-f iove. His voice changed in a it:o»:ic»il. his words were few and broken, ,i::d hardly articulafe, and I dared not look at hi n then ; but though I did not vv, I knew that his eyes were depressed und hb houd bevind.
lì was a strange moment ; İ know* not- wh» tiur it W.1- jny or niisin to meto IVel th aí —nerhiips he lo^ed. It wa* but a inume.it. 'iluu odioib Oeloraiue came inti» the bow and ^pok«? to him iu a certain tone, w huh he -cemed co erteli directly—yet still I tcu á to thiuk iclutiautly. I tried to think its loudness and laugh were forced, Delorainc drew him into another box amoiur; a number of vounr men ; and í was happier for then шьееа I could see sometimes the motion of his arm as he leant against the pillar ; ouee I beheld the undulation of his rich red lip, as he spoke to some (-ne ; some one who heard iiim, perhaps., as he would have listened to the wind. Thev never lo>ed who wished to be ι/ near what the) lo\ed. Wetter talks of dancing with charlotte, of holding; her in Ms arm»; what feelings men ha\e ! Such a tiu e is with me, a tiuie of fear and blindas, i love to be c o far iiom
him, that it is requisite for me to watch and devise how I may catch a glance or a tone from him. I would not be nearer if I might ; a glance, a tone is enough, is too much for me. " A touch is/' as Alonzo says, ft to be bought with life." Why will he speak in those soft tones, and yet speak nothing but lightness ? why will he mingle with those beings, and be still so unlike them ? I wish he would be either angel or human, and I might then have peace. But this mix¬ ture of loveliness and depravity, this beauty and brightness of a fallen ange!, so rends my feelings, so confounds my mmd—what principles I have left, are so shaken and shattered, that I wish I w ere dead, to be shut out from pain. Odious Deloraine would not let him rest long; he whispered himagain, and they left the box together, yet I thought he went unwillingly, I thought I heard him sigh, He went; aud I coirid not rush and
recall him, 1 could not .«peak, I could not interpose even a look—a look might have done it; heis so young, mì timid in vice, of so sweet and auspicious a na¬ ture—surely the saints will pardon him. Twice they told me it was all over, it had been all over with шс before. A» we went out, he was lounging near the lobby tire, in an attitude of studied bold- ness; I am sure it was studied. It w as a form to make libertinism lovely, there- fore I tried to hurry away from him ; but to be from him is impossible. I am now alone, with the images of the night before my eyes, and tbe restlessness of dissipation in my head. If he loves— but why do I rave ? lie ought to love, love purifies the heart it is said ; but what purifies the heart of man, may break that of woman. ELM AID E ST. CLAIR,

To Mrs. G— re. Dľar Martha, no more such leiters, you need write no more to me^ but 1 must write to you. I only ask from you silence and secrecy, I do not ask com¬ pas ion, 1 feel 1 do not deserve it. But í musl write to you ; if I am denied this means of soothing røy mind, I feel it will be more than I can bear : do not drive me to eviremitiev. The indulgencies I allow myself can¬ not be criminal, they cannot be danger* cus; íhey areso visionary, so infrequent, so inluvupted by restraint and suffering. B'-side«, it i* ali i can ever know of in¬ dulgence, and misery is jealoin of its respite. Would vou rob an hermit of the picture be bovs s to in his cold cell ? It caoiint be a crime 'o graze on so fair a sight, and distantly and rarely as İ gazeou kim ; the. -e .ire colours and fornii in naturo
so lovely, that they seem made fbt love. If it be no crime to look on the red rose- leaf, on the a bher foliage of autumn so lovely and luxuriant ;.it can be no crime lo look on his cheek so like the red rose- leaf, or his hair so like the lovely foliage of autumn ; nay even to think of them as I do, when I wish myself a breeze to breathe on them and die. This is all, and is this so much ? and the balance for misery so keen and cease¬ less ? Think that I have a task to do, a pilgrimage to go, so long, and sad, and sombrons, a life of hopeless love ; and to live out a long-, long waste of years, which may be protracted from time to time by the sight of him, (a cordial of cruel sweetness ! ) and never to have a i;!eam of hope from his eye, or a sound fiorn his lip, no more than if I wooed a Mar from Heaven î and when I die of a broken heart, to know that he may walk over my grave, and never know that the 3
heart wfiich moulders there was broken for his love, that tbc hovering spirit would be absolved by bis sigh—all thk- must be, and it is my pride that all this must be ; for world» I would not that he knew I loved* If I were unworthy of him, I could have no consolation ; if I were so lost, I could not pray for bis soul. If I am guilty, my punishment will Hot be long deferred. They say he is a gamester now, that he is engaged in a desperate bet with some of the most desperate of the set at D~~ly*s, about facing or gaming ; I could not hear the particulars. This must be odious De¬ bordine 's doing. ELMAIDE ST. CLAIR. Martha, I do kneel and pray ; I do struggle with my heart, and weep that ihe struggle is so vaia. There is aa
boïlowucss and duplicity in my feelings which detract me to discover. But of what avail would tbe firmest resolution be to mc ? the power that enslaves me is not within me ; I cannot make it сеач?, if I wished. But to feel all my good resolutions and wishes, the whole pile of determined amendment, that the tears and prayers of a penitential night seem to have raised, the calm of mii^l that is sometimes produced by weariness of woe, to feel all this overthrown and scattered by a single glimpse of his form, by the very dream of his shadow when I close my eyes, and see darkness filled with flitting forms, to think that the very depths of my heart arc unable to shelter me from his eye, even if I sought shelter, to fee! iu the very moment and spirit of supplication, while my lips are pouring out the most solemn sounds—I am " confessed w ithin the slave of love and man ,f —to feel this, is to feci myself so
lost, so hopeless, that despair almost becomes a refuge, that I am «lad to sink, under the waters, to lose the noise of their roar. It is a drecdful state of mind, when real objects become visionary, and vi¬ sionary ones, realities. All life appears to me a dream—I move like a shadow amour those whom I see, ajid they «re as shadows to me. lint his presence seems always real; his thought seems the purpose of life. But it is to no purpose that I think of him. Why do they talk to mc of his dissolute courses—hs is more innocent than any that speak of him. He mnot be what they say of him, or if he be, he cannot err f:s others would err; the heart and the motive are what they cannot penetrate, cr they would know that his have nothing to do with the vices forced on him: yet lei them talk of him stilb for tlľ*v mention his name to mc ; and that

love; heloves, ï knew he loved; frøtr* the moment I firet beheld his melancholy *ye, first heard his suppressed fones, like sweet, broken music; first saw his form, which the very spirii of love seems to have touched with a kind of luxuriant sadness, to have poureda mild and mellow ftght around, an halo of melancholy brightness; í knew he tøved; such a : being was only formed for íove. He is undone, bis ruin could not be more certainly sealed than by such a passion. And во young, and so innocent; u oh the pity of it/' But how was it possible forhinvto escape ? You must have heard of Lady Montrevor, the modern Ninon, " who has filled the throne of fashion," and fashionable folly and vice, without an equal or rivat, till her reign was extended over subjects of a second generation, whose beauty has triumphed over nature, and whose wit is unimpaired by tune, whose som have entered iute
public life, whose daughters have mar¬ ried, whose grand children form & numerous family already, and whose beauty is still as distant from decline a« from competition. Always living in the blaze of courts, and in the centre of splendid admiration, her form and manners present the reflec* tion of all that is attractive in grace, or resistless in power, all the art of beauty, and all the array of fascination. And in the miaste her triumph and her power, in the luxuriance of magnificence, and the pomp of loveliness, when her family had extended their alliances through the first houses in Great Britain, a«ìd her influence was solicited by courtiers and Fenators·, the discovery of the legitimate heir to the title and fortunes of the earldom of Westhampton, which had been usurped by her lord for thirty years, suddenly dashed them into indigence and infamy. They retired with all that re-
røained to them, the title of Montrevor, and an impoverished income, to their estates in Ireland, where they hid, with their pride and their shame, the remains of their family and the ruin of their fortune. The circumstances that trass- spired on an examination of this dark business before a committee of the house öf lords, were so atrocious, that Lord, Mentrcvor is said to have owed his re¬ tirement to the influence of his lady, whose magnanimity, in shelťľriag^ aud* sustaining iu his disgrace an husband whom in prosperity she had despised and neglected, and it is said injured, shed a gleam of dignity over the close of а Ше of levity and vice, a magnanimity the more gratuitous, as it appeared she was utterly ignorant of the iniquity by which lier distinction had been acquired, and that Lord Westhampfon, convinced of her innocence, had made her the most liberal oilers by way of compensation fot;.
the losses she sustained by the recognition of his title. But whether she Felt the decline of her attractions, or her thirst of power, or spirit of pleasure, she rejected every exclusive provision, and accompanied her husband and the children who were yet unsettled, to the wilds of Ireland, where he employs himself in dreams of re** covered rank and influence, and she in deriding them ; for though she follow« him with tenacious fidelity, "he still reserves to herself the right of ridicule and reproach, which she exercises without mercy—such is the new spaper account of this extraordinary woman. He has seen her. The castle of De Lacy is near the seat of the M- ntrevor family. He saw her, and it is but ne¬ cessary to see her, that all other objects may become indifferent ; it is easy to fell the effect of an interview between a wild Irish boy and a veteran woman of fa*-
»hion, so interesting in the softness of retirement, and the dignity of solitary beauty. He is undone, yes, I repeat it, he is undone. Nothing is so fatal to tlic mind as the despair of early passion aggra¬ vated by the consciousness of guilt, and the constraint of disappointment. I feel it by myself From the first moment I be¬ held him. I knew he loved, tbat his love was hopeless, and that is was guilty. His face tells it all, but oh ! tells it with an expression which divests despair of gloom; and guilt of criminality. Heis undone, but who can wonder at him, or at her, fevered with dissipation, and wearied with the insipid forms of fashion, what he must have appeared to her, so fresh a form, so young a mind, a single star of young mamiiig brightness in the dark waste that surrounds hor now. They say she is still beautiful as ever. She must be resistless; aud alone, all around her so rude and savage, and solitary, a Ca-
hpso on a desert shore— A e must be f eaistless ! and to sec her in the melan¬ choly of departed grandeur, and the majesty of voluntary retirement, her misfortunes^ and her seclusion veiling the glare of her manners, and softening the loud tones of her wit and vanity, to the docile and piano of conference, to a whispered spell of languishment and se¬ duction, a shadowy splendour like moon¬ light hanging over the rich and faded colours of her beauty—ye.% yes, I can imagine it alb she must be resistless. Cruel woman! in the sport of her ca¬ nity, iu the spleen of her solitude, she will trifle with what a fonder heart is breaking for; she will treat him asa boy 3 be will love her like a man. When he finds he is abused, in the conflict of pride and love, he \л ill rush into dis- astuteness* or sink into dejection. His heart will be depraved or broken^ his noble gentle heart—but mine \л ill be
cold first. Cruel woman! she might have been content with the wreaths of con¬ quest she had gathered in all the courts of Europe, without coming to the w ild* of Ireland, to tear my wild-briar-rose from me-*-from me, now wild. 1 am not fit to be the handmaid of her he loves I am no high-born beauty, splendid and fascinating, with melody in my voice. and magic in my smile ; but if my cheek is pale, I would he knew it is for love of him—again myself; it is a wild and wayward thought, like a thought of love ; yet I cannot but sometimes dream, that I would not have been so far from hope, if he had never seen that splendid ladv.

Martha, my mind is hurt I fear—I went to the window to cool my burning forehead; he was walking below ; it was evening, and the street was lonely ; his step was slow and irregular—what was he thinking of ? possibly of some new device of extravagance, or some means of supplying it—it is impossible ; no, if
í could coin my blood iuto drachmas for him, it would be in vain. A mistress, two or three mistresses I believe, perpe¬ tual engagements, and perpetual losses on the turf and the hazard table; an establishment equal to that of a young nobleman, but frequented by no noble¬ men, by none but those to whom his vices are a sport or a subsistence. Yet still his depravity is not the vice of the heart, it is hardly the vice of man, it is the lapse of a spirit, whose plumage is rent and ruffled by the rude airs of earth. Ah ! no, no—this is all language—dare I say it, I would say if," I love him bet¬ ter for his dejection and his excesses. Whatever makes him human, makes him dear. The contrast between his weak¬ ness, his wildness, his dissoluteness, and his youth, and his form, and his soft¬ ness when he speaks to women ; the con¬ trast between the blaze of his riot, and the gloom of his dejection; yet still pre- Dä
serving his sensibility amid dissipation, and lib gentleness in sorrow—it is too much for me. This cannot confinile long; his health has yielded at last to his excesses, or his sensibility. He is ill, and confined to the care of Delorainc; never did the Worm riot on so rich a rose. There is much interest felt for h ini, and in¬ quiry made e^en by strangers for him. ï have more certain information^ I could hardly have borne this term but for it. The Mife of his valet is among our ser¬ vants; she talks of him constantly, and I listen to her, pale and silent. Her husband, who adores his master, attends him day and nighf. He is some¬ times delirious; when he is calm, he bids them conceal his indisposition from his uucle, whose name he often repeats with some epithet of affection. Yesterday lie started from his sleep, to desire that his old pensioner* should not suffer from his iline·"*.
It was the first time he had ever mem finned them, weak as he was, he gave his servant the most minute direction* for finding and relieving them. His vices were better known than his virtae·«. . . . .

those who have loved to death like me can only know, because thev dare. Something dreadful has happened ; I can make no comment on it, you cannot expect it from me. The wife of his servant has been weeping beside me all night; all night I have kept her beside $ne to —weep, for she can hardly speak. Oh! Martha, this is a moment when I would not sec for worlds vou or any one that knows, that thinks of me. I am wild, you would not know me. Con¬ straint, and pawon, and grief, and fear, are too much for me; there is no wo¬ man 'ь heart, no human heart can bear the assaults I have borne so long. He is gone, gone in the agony of feeling; and I cannot cast myself in his way, and 1 cannot die under his steps, no, for that would be happiness. His servant, the faithful servant, had left him for a few moments. During this time he observed some confusion in
the hotel where his master lodges; he was accustomed, I believe, to the cla¬ mour of creditors; but wearied and dis¬ tressed, he did not perceive that Mr, Debraine^ servaut had got admittance into his room with a packet of letters from the country. He soon heard the consequences. A burst of rage, and grief, and execration, brought him to his master's room. He had sprung from bed. He was dressing; himself w ithout assistance. The man approached, and attempted to inquire. He would listen to nothing; he would utter nothing· <( My uncle, Oh! my poor uncle/* bur-f from him invohmtarilv every moment. He rung the bell with лЫспсе, the. waiters rushed into the room, he ordered his curricle, a carriage, his horses, any thing, every thing, a wind to waft him to the west; it was nm-hL the weathei was dreary. He staggered from debility while he n t
spoke. His servant, in the impulse of the moment, threw himself at his feet. He adjured him to pause, to reflect, if he was indeed wild enough to dream of travelling at that hour, and in that state. He promised himself, with the ardent Adelity of an Irishman, to travel on foot to the Chieftain's castle in the west, to procure him case or health, if either re¬ quired it. He reminded him of his long services, and implored to be his friend. Breaking from him, he fiercely cursed all friends for traitors, aud all servants for plunderers. JS о force could hold him. The attendants retreated from his fury. Ás be rushed from the room, he stag- gcral from feebleness. His servant, who had still followed him, scarce saved him from failing; (he was but just raised from the bed of fever and deli- riunì.) He turned his darkened and swimming eyes on the faithful man. if li

of which I could not speak in the first person. I must now assume it, to make the narrative distinct. On my arrival in the country, the journey undertaken, in the rage of a fever, and among the snows of winter, had its natural effect. I was suspended between life and death for months; and the lingerings of a nervous fever pursued me through the summer. After r ' suffering many things of manv physicians/* I had vet résolu- tion enough to tear me from the spot, which fed my disease. I returned to Dublin, hid myself in a cottage on the sea-shore, breathed its keen air, and plunged into its waves every day ; and struggled as' manfully for life, as if life for me had any worth. A few letters, which I wrote to Debraine about this tim·*, will describe my situation more particularly. They are merely the let¬ ters of a ley of eighteen, the victim of involuntary vice, and too voluntary sen-
sîbÎlity. They are the language of a broken constitution and a world-weary spirit, mixed with remorse and concealed love. T& J, E. Delorainc, Esq. Black Rock, October 0. I thank you—I believe I am somewhat better, at least, I am in the habit of sav¬ ing so, to those who inquire about me, without caring how their inquiries are answered ; and you may say so to any one who asks for me with the same feel¬ ing, or absence of feeling; but between ourselves, I believe, dear J. I am very near being what I wish to be. Do not be an^rv with mc for dismissing Dr. P. I neither suspect his capacity nor at¬ tention ; I would not even breathe a tri¬ vial professional jest about him ; this is no time for me to speak lightly of any man's character ; I acquit him and his υ t>
brethren. I firmly believe all ha* been done for me that they could do ; but the complaint of their impofency in certain cases, is as old as the time of Macbeth, or as much obler as the operation of the passions of mau on his frame. 1 believe I have read one exception to this general imbecility of art ; did not a physician discover the passion of Antiochus for Stratonice? Were such a man now iu the world, I would fiv to its extremi- ties from him. I attend to Dr. P/s directions, and plunge into the sea every morning with as much tenacity, as if------· But I am afraid if I neglected it, they would say I neglected my health» This place is quite deserted, and I am, thank Heaven, quite alone in it. It has a strange sound, but if any thing can be of service, it will be this deep loneliness, this remission of all im¬ portunity and noise, these walks, by tbe rough dashing of the waters, imder a
irrcy, autumnal skv. I could not walk in broad .dav -light, I would not walk where there were numbers, especially numbers of such as frequent a watering place. At present I walk almost inces¬ santi ν ; 1 cannot bear riding, one cannot stoop, or pause, or loiter; and one is confined to the high road, and all its ho*t; and there is а к imi of jolting thoughtlessness about it, I cannot, away with------1 love the windings of the shore, with the цтоу ch uds swecpiiur over the cliffs, aud the waves beating at mv feet. I love eveu the shriek of the sea-gull, and the dipping of the oars at a distante; one cannot go ten steps with¬ out meeting one of the little fishing- boats, doubling the crags andjuttings of the rocks; but I pass them hastily, and thev hardly see me. When the tide is out, I wander along the strand; any one that saw me would believe me to be a fossilist, or marine botanist, if they ob-
served with what intentness I unfold the clusters of sea-weed, and pick up the shells I meet. They are all for my landlord's children—children, I am not impatieirt of, except those whom I see peeping at me from the cliffs, while I walk on the strands below. I cannot wonder at them, my figure must be sin¬ gular to them ; my incessant wanderings, my solitariness, the strange contrast of early youth and melancholy, deep and substantial melancholv, I cannot wonder at them. But lest thev should wonder too much at me, I often walk miles into the country, to Bray, &c. I have even walked into the county Wicklow. There are rocks and solitudes without interruption. The people with whom I live, tell me, I must be very courageous to venture into places so wild, and dis¬ turbed so lately; and I smile with the feelings of a man who is praised for a virtue the furthest from his thoughts or
practice. I am sometimes dreadfully tired; but still it prevents me from thinking always, and it procures me that deep sleep whicli medicine has not been able to procure for me since my fever. I thank vou for vour recollection about my books. There arc few books I can read now ; but send me a Werter, and send n:e my Elzevir Virgil, I want to read over the fourth book, and some part of the sixth; that fourth book is a won¬ derful production, the ancients knew so little of what wc call passion. Apropos, don't you think an History of Suicides would be a striking thing ? I am told there is some such thing compiling now; but it is by a barrister. I will never read it; written by him I mean. He will make it a cause in the court of Common Pleas. He will tell us of the lawfulness, or unlawfulness ; the expe¬ diency, or inexpediency; the stupid, legal pour ci contre of an action, of

"very tragical mirth truly/' Write to me plainly, earnestly, soothingly, as we write to those whom we believe to be not far from death. I did not intend to say so much ; but Γ believe I have said no more than the truth. Do not menace me with a visit from Sandys, Morris, Hoare, and the rest, I could not bear them, or tlicy pro¬ bably me ; I have had too much of San- dys, "Morris, Hoare, and the rest. You and they have almost destroyed me. The first word of that sentence escaped me ; you know I never reproached you. I ne¬ ver will reproach yon. But my dear D~ vour cruel indulgence, your thoughtless and importunate pursuit of my gratifica¬ tion, or of what you imagined would gratify me, has been in its ellects to me, as the most bitter enmity. Your solici¬ tude overcame your very sense, your knowledge of my character. You knew me at. least inoffensive and uncoatami-
nated, with some sensibility, with more h/ * diffidence, with melancholy more than either; a blushing boy, who retreated aud blushed alike at the superiority of man, and the softness of woman. You knew me averse from dissipation, and loathing depravity. Yet you, Oh, Delo¬ rame ! I looked up to you as an elder brother, I leaned on you whh full and perfect confidence, I looked in your face almost for momentary direction. Why would you lead one, who trusted you so helplessly, into vice? yes, into vice; whatever you and Hoare may call it, sobtude has whispered its right name to me. \ ou made me game wiíjiout skill, you made me drink without head or taste for wine, you drove me (yes, diove me by ridicule, the most powerfyI of all conductors,) to tices, from which habi¬ tual diffidence and boyish youth ¿render¬ ed me even more abhorent, and foir w hieb intoxication was even a necessary pre-
parative—when you laughed at the sick¬ liness of male modesty; oh! that you had known the sickness and the fear t stifled tojóin the laugh ; you kept noisy crowds about me for ever, you hurried me from tavern to tavern, you kept me in a state of artificial madness : oh ! that you had left me to myáeif : I implored, I besought you to do so, I told you 1 was too yuunir for those things. I begged von to have mercy ou my yom h ; 1 entreated for a book and the soc;rtv of the few worthy men who \ct condescend to no¬ tice me. You know Ï told you 1 was but sixteen the first place you dragged meto. "While I write thi^ I feel my forehead and cheeks, paie as they have long* been, covered with burning spots* 1 could not write thus, were a creature in the room with me. And now that 1 have written, I re¬ proach myself for it ; it was your kind¬ ness for me I know ; you discovered»
that is, thought you had discovered, that I was unhappy, and drove me into dis¬ sipation to forget it. If I was unhappy, it was an unhappiness which dissipation could not remove, you с oul 1 neither know its cause nor its remedy. But my dear I), should ray health be irrepa¬ rably injured, should your fatal kind¬ ness plunge me into an early grave, re¬ member it, I implore л on for vour own use and mcnition, and never lead one who trusts vou as i did with the open¬ ness of youth and affection, into tbe courses von have led me. The time makes plain language a kind of duty to me. Should you ever meet with one like me, ignorant, and willing to continue so, do not force him to learn what I have learned so reluctantly, perhaps so fatally; do not feel that my sensations are less painful· because my errors were (you know) involuntary : perhaps they arc
more so. I have a jealousy, a restless¬ ness, a shame of myself ; which is always the symptom of early, unhabitual vice. Yet still I have a recurrence of thoughts 4ich as I ought to banish, at least ought not to suffer to please me as they do : and which, when 1 resist them, return in my dreams. Oh ! I have such dreams —is there guilt in dreams ? Dear D. write me no more such letters. I don't want to know about the low curricles and the Hessian boots. I will have neither I will not run in debt ; whether my thoughts will betray me or not, I have a power over my actions. I do not wish to part with my horses, because my groom is a well-priucipled lad, and supports his widowed mother on his wages. If J------ s insists on being paid before I receive my next remittance, dispose of my watch for what you can get for it, and satisfy him. I have no
wish to distress him, and I cannot bear a tradesman's clamours* But I will strip myself to my last shilling, I will go without a meal and without a coat, I will deal with Jews, with the devil, before I will apply to my poor uncle for a shilling beyond my allowance. Don't mention it again Ü. don't hint at it, do'nt think of it. I have been compelled to give him a blow already which he will never recover, or I either ; I will at least never repeat it : my only consolation is, I was compelled, my extravagance was involuntary ; 1 never will be stabbed again by his anger and his forgiveness. D. you know me to possess some resolution, should my uncle through your, or any other means, bear of or suffer from my lapses again, ï will plunge myself into the sea that is heaving in my sight this moment. o.

To J. L, Delorame, Esq. October II. I can conceal nothing from you, it has been the habit of my mind to pour out all it knows or feels with childish pro¬ fusion on you ; if I have met no acquaint¬ ance, I have met un avanture. I found the other day in a recess among the rocks, (where I often go, when the tide is out, for shells) a letter tied with a bunch of sea-weed, as if some nereid had floated on a wave with it there ; it was addressed to me, I opened it, and have every day since found one in the same place. The style of them is as singular as the cir¬ cumstances ; thev are written in a female hand, and are evidently the production of a female mind, and that mind strongly tinged with romance and the Romish religion.
They are full of a pure and mystic morality, they present tbe picture of a melancholy and impassioned mind, feed¬ ing itself with the visions of religion, of a life and feelings chequered with gleam» of devotion, which pours over it a light, sombrous, and fitful and fantastic, a» the colours which fall from the <ζ storied window*' of a cloister, on the ghostly cheek of its inmate, who gazes on it in the moonlight. These letters contain many monitions (which seem to imply a knowledge of the events of my life) and exhortations and promises» but the very promises are tinged with melan¬ choly, and there is a pining and compul¬ sory tone where they speak ot the worth- lessness of this world and its enjoyments, which seems the tone of a mind not con¬ vinced by its own reasoning, and more willing to condemn than to relinquish them.
в '2
All this is extraordinary, but what is still more so, my invisible correspondent has insisted on a relation of my life, and I have complied. I deposit my papers every day in the same place where I find the letters, and they are re-placed the following day. It would be impossible to copy them in the interval, and ifit were possible, there could be no danger, no one can make a bad use of the confessions of a penitent of eighteen. ORMSBY BETHEL. P. S. Not a line from Hammond or my sister. * φ * * -* * The narrative which I wrote for my nameless correspondent I here insert for you. It contains an account of the early parts of my life, such as every one loves to recall : it is marked by oue peculiarity.
The secret which it was the business of my life to watch, and in the concealment of which life had been almost destroyed, is told here without reserve** It is hardly possible to explain the feeling that prompted me to this dis¬ closure. But the wildness of solitude and romantic dejection,the mysteriousness of my correspondent, and the high and peculiar tone of the letters I received, altogether left an impression on my mind, as if I had to do with some superior being, whom to deceive was impossible, and with whom duplicity would be as much a folly as a crime : the narrative contains more of opinions than events, I know not whether that will be a defect or a recommendation to vou, I have none of the common motives of biographers for writing my own liTe. I have neither ambition of praise, nor desire of vindication, I have no wish to revile or panegyrise, to accuse or to defend. Б 3
For me life has no further employment, or hope, or charm. I was born at Ailly au Clochers iu France, about the beginning of the year 17— ; it would be difficult to discover in what month, for in an ebullition of revolutionary philatithrophy, in Septem¬ ber 1)2, they burnt the prior of the bene¬ dictine convent there, an old, helpless, harmless priest, and lit the pyre with the registers of his church, in which my name I have heard was inserted. In my childhood 1 was hurried about from place to place, I knew not by whom, or for what purpose : I was never taught to call any one parent or relative, but if not, no early feeling was excited in me* but that of distinction. Le petit Milor Anglois, le bel Enfant, and other ñamas of praise and deference, taught me even in infancy to recognize that passion, which has been the distinction and the scourge of my existence, taught me to
look on myself as a being marked by superiority from the beginning, very early, so early that I forgot my informer. I heard <hat my parents were Irish. At about seven years old, I remember being struck bv the difference between the glad and sunny skies of Languedoc, and the dark, heavy air I then began to breathe in London, and still more strongly by the obsequiousness and pliancy of my late attendants, contrasted with the rough looks and language of the English. I remember being placed with a person and his wife, who occupied a small house in Totteuham-Court-road, and whose modes of life were so still and monotonous, that they sobered and fixed my childish attention; objects recurring so unfail¬ ingly made an impression on my mind, which they could never have owed to their importance. I exercised a degree of observation on the habits of this man and e 4
his wife, such as now appears marvellous to me, what I recollect of them I shall yet relate, for the mind pleases itself with its early acquisitions. They had been in business, and for many years were content with the silent accumulation of moderate profits; at length they fancied themselves weary of the drudgery of trade, they called in their debts, examined their capital, reminded each other that they had no children, and no expectation of fhem, and that it was foolish, with the means of ease, to exhaust life in un¬ necessary toil. When they had made this discovery, their joy w r as great; they wondered what demon had prevented them from making it before; and that they might lose no time in taking advantage of it, sunk their property for an annuity, and took a small house in Tottenham- Court-road. In a few weeks the bustle of removal was over, there was nothing more to propose or to do. They sat down
in their easy chairs, looked in each others faces for happiness, and met only discon¬ tent and weariness : shame, however, pre¬ vented their communicating a mutual wish that they were back again in Botolph-lane, and from those who visited them in curiosity or in idleness, they ex¬ torted perpetual praises of a stagnant pool in the middle of their garden, in the weeds of which they had entangled an artificial duck, and of the rural murmurs of an hogfeeder*s styes next door, by whom (in the triumph of her heart) Mrs. Simpson assured her visitors her mornings' rest had been broken ever since her removal to the country. They had resided twelve years in this place, when I became their inmate, and with every year had their dis content, disappointment, and weariness increased. By that time all struggles had ceased; they had subsided into torpid dejection. ж5
I can recollect no one day that difiered from another. They rose late witl^ wonder at each other's sluggishness, and a resolution to commence an habit of early rising the following Monday. The morning was passed by Mr. Simp¬ son in examining books of obsolete accounts, whicli he had brought with him from the city (ζ against a rainy day/* as h» said in totting up sums, whose numbers he could by that time tell blindfold, and when he had found the amount, yawning and beginning again ; sometimes he strolled about the house, examined locks that did not want re¬ pairing, shook his head at the weather glass, and projected a removal of the clock from behind the parlour door, where its ticking made him melancholy after dinner. His wife retired to her room, examined the contents of old drawers, discovered that things grew yellow by lying by, and resolved to 4
expose them to the sun some day iu the following week ; at a certain hour she visited the kitchen, watched the intrusion of strange cats, and detected the turnspit in his many contrivances to escape from duty, by which she boasted, dinner was prevented from being five minutes later than the time. They dined early without appetite, and retired early without drow¬ siness, sometimes a walk was proposed, on the appearance of a fine morning, but then the weather-glass was examined, fill the time for walking had passed away ; and looking wistfully at each other, they sunk into their easv chairs, and counted how many minutes till dinner. Sunday indeed presented some variation of habits; they had much of that atten then ess and decency in matters of religion which the middling orders of the English are dis¬ tinguished by ; solitude had driven them to meditation, and of a long evening they sometimes looked into the Bible iu self- ^6
defence ; not however without some compunction for the unfitness of the study on any evening but that of the Sabbath. That day of employment threw a beam of cheerfulness even on Saturday; it reminded them to compare the distance of the nearest churches, to lay plans for possessing themselves of the seats adjacent to the reading desk, and not suffer, by a foolish forbearance, the church-warden's wife to deprive them of the largest cushions. The day itself saw them punctually attend sccvice thrice, and laboriously fill up the intervals with what they believed to be appropriate reading. They never read the scriptures, habitually I mean, the lessons of revelation could hardly have been reconciled with a life of squalid indolence, and hopeless de- pre$şion; but every religious work, whose tone was not lofty or peculiar, perused in the intervals of public service with a rueful tenacity, u a sad civility,
that yielded neither to difficulty nor weariness/* Sermons, treatises, exhortations, were all alike devoured; as they proceeded their faculties grew more cloudy from per¬ plexity, and their tempers more sour from restraint ; yet still they read on, without any discrimination between the spirit and the forms of religion, to believe that what they did was right, though ready to gnaw their own flesh with wearinsss and vexation. Such was their superstitious adherence to hours, that I have seen them checked in the midst of a bitter conten¬ tion, which the characteristic peevishness of the day had excited, by recollecting it was time to read prayers, and renewing it again the moment the volume of peace was closed. I have heard Mr. Simpson complain bitterly of a preacher, whose sermon had dismissed him (from hie slumber) a few minutes earlier than usual, which he observed, r * v»äs ¿l verv
unfair thing of a Sunday, when a man has nothing at home, but—bis wife. They were seldom disturbed by visitors : some city cousins had called of them during the first months of their retirement ; but their curiosity was soon satisfied, and they had no other motive for their visits, for it was known that the Simpsons had sunk their property for an annuity. Besides, Mr. and Mrs. S. had discovered (what elderly retired people are \ery apt to discover) that it was to preserve the neatness of an house open to the intrusion of strangers, and that of the three visitors who had disturbed them during the last month, one had neglected to clean his feet on the scraper, another had placed the hearth-brush on the wrong side of the fire-place, and a third had stirrtd the fire, though the price of coals had been hinted in bis hearing, and his remark on the coldness of the weather had been contradicted. In the misery ia which 1
found them (the misery of ease unpur¬ chased by labor, and indulgence unpre- ceded by restraint, of solitude without any of the resources which solitude re¬ quires, and of mental disquietude which could not be charged on external objects) they had not submitted without strugglei of resistance, without much wonder at their own waywardness, and repeated ac¬ cusations of the state of the weather. Ai length in despair they advertised for a lodger, and endeavoured to persuade each oilier they would find a pleasure in society vet untried. " At all events," said Mr. S. f,f we shall not lose by it." The persons to whom I was committed, under¬ stood that they were sober and credit¬ able, and accordingly I was placed with them as the son of a gentleman abroad ; masters attended me at their house, and as my allowauce was ample, I was treated with as much distinction as narrow minds could bestow. But solitude was no
scene for me. In a few months the lassitude I witnessed, invaded me, I lost my appetite and my complexion; I began to loath myself, and every thing around roe, nothing could inspirit me to diligence, or invite me to play. The images of sleepy depression I beheld, benumbed me; it is indeed impossible to imagine a life of more weariness,debility, and degradation. Yet this is adopted by thousands, and at some part of life, its outline is sketched by almost all, as the repose of labour, and the indulgence of age. Its effect on me has been to make me abhor the idea of tranquillity, to shrink from retirement, as from ignominy and misery, and to regard such objects and proposals with a mind of instinctive and incurable dread, which my reason is perpetually disclaim¬ ing. When they found my health was injured by the solitary dejection of home, they sent me to school. * * * * *
There is nothing I dislike more than an abstract delineation of passion and cha¬ racter. Man is not to be represented by description, but by action. I recollect but few circumstances of my own child¬ hood, but all I recollect is characteristic. When I say characteristic, I do not mean it of the fugitive and venial propensities of childhood, but of those qualities which adhere to and compose the character of the man—such alone are worth relating. Mr. Simpson, who thought be had some degree of knowledge of religious matters, one night took it into his head to examine my proficiency in them, I was not ignorant of the ele¬ mentary topics he spoke on ; at length having warmed himself with their con· templation, he began rather to declaim than to examine. He spoke of the day of judgment. It was impossible even for him to speak on such a subject.
without communicating some awe to a young mind. I listened while he de¬ scribed the reward of the just ; I asked eagerly, " would their reward be so public?*" ff Yes, in the sight of men and angels, in the sight of their enemies/* the tears gushed into my eyes - of the remainder of the lecture I have no re¬ collection, ****** I had been some time at school, when I obsei 1 one day a little m ish apen urchin assaulting with all the virulence of teeth and nails, a boy who neither made resistance, nor shewed resentment ; my blood boiled, I ran up to them. " How can you suffer yourself to be mauled by that little reptile/' * r Do you not see/* said the boy, " that he is weak and a cripple/'—" That is a lye," said the cripple, redoubling his blows. <f Can you bear/' said I cf that he should give you
the lye, you are afraid of him, 'tis your cowardice that makes you so patient." The boy made no reply, but when the little wasp had wearied himself, darting his fangs, he approached me quietly. tf You are of my own age," said he, £f and as strong as I am ; I shall readily prove to you that I am no coward "— We fought, and I got a complete beating : sore as I wa3 with my defeat, I admired the boy's patie&ce and courage, and as soon as I was able to speak, I held out my hand to him, and desired we might be friends. "No," said he, repelling my hand, tc we can never agree, you are too light-minded for m#, you change your opinions, and love and hate too suddenly for me, we should never agree." I re- mainedj gnawing my lip. Some time after the dwarf whose name I have forgot, who endeavoured to make himself dreaded for mischief if not for strength, fastened on
me as a butt for his gibing knaveries. In imitation of Morton's steadiness, I hore bis persecutions without wincing, though I would rather have borne the bastinado; ridicule was to me, always, worse than " firebrands, arrows, and death/* At length I discovered that the dwarf had stolen some of my books; there was something romantic in the resolution I adopted. Nothing was easier than to point out the delinquent, but when the books were enquired for, I suffered their loss to be ascribed to my negligence, and was punished without a murmur. On that day Hammond came up to me. " Why did you let your little enemy escape?"— 4< Because he was my enemy/' Hammond looked at me incredulously, " Had I exposed him/' said I " you would have believed it done in revenge/*— <x And was it on my account, you submitted to
be punished when you did not deserve it ?'* I was silent, he extended his hand to me, then I seized it eagerly. People who read this may smile at the eternal friendships of boys of 10 and 12, yet our friendship has been indissoluble.
CHAP. IL After this, I will not conceal my own fastidious levity. A number of us strolled into the fields; it was evening, my companions pursued different sports. I sat down upon a bank, and gazed on the setting sun, and on the colours with which his departing had filled the west, till a tear, of which I knew not the source, came to my eye. No being, from the hour of infancv, ever s;azed on nature with a more enthusiastic mind than I did, Hammond came up to me, (i Why don't you come and play with the rest of the lads?" I pointed to the glorious west¬ ern clouds, and motioned him to bit down by mc silently. 4: Come away/' said he, pulling me roughly by the arm.
a come along, and *<***i us, the lads will all laugh at you. I do not mind their laughter/* said I, with a look that was designed to speak volumes of indig¬ nant sensibility. tc But I do," said he, and was bounding lightly away, when I caught him by the arm. He had shocked and disconcerted me ; my whole soul was in a state of revolt and hostility to him. {( Hammond," said I, <r here let our ill- concerted friendship end; we have no sympathy of minds, we have nothing in common, here let. us part. 1 *— <f No, Bethel," said the manly-minded boy, " him to whom I have promised my regards, I cannot leave so lightly; you embrace a friend, and renounce him ; I embrace him, and adhere to him for ever, I have not precisely your feelings, but ihere are many offices in friendship, he- side sitting down with you to weep at the beams of the setting sun." Such w *»s Hammond ; if from these ^ketches,
the ardour, the ambition, the sanguine levity of my character cannot be suffi¬ ciently collected, there will be a stronger exemplification in the events of my life. Amid the rough encounters of a school, the peculiarities of my character might perhaps have been worn away, had «ot the state of rav health at this juncture made a removal from London necessary. The cause was singular : no being could live in more contented ignorance of their parentage and connexions than I had done for thirteen years; I know not to what to ascribe it, perhaps to my being too much wrapt in the operation« of my own mind I was one day standing at Mr. S/s window, his servant was in the room, whom I had never observed as remarkably communicative; an equipage suddenly passed the door, i{ There is your father/' said the servant vacantly, I started—my father— eyevy nerve in my body quivered; I neither ate nor «poke
for the remainder of the day. Ια the night I recollect something of an ob¬ scure struggle, and even in sleep a kind of feverish and blind resistance to some force I could not distinguish; I was at length awakened, and discerned severa! persons about my bed, with fear in their faces. I learned from their conversation, that I had been found in my sleep at¬ tempting to make my escape in the direc¬ tion of the road through which mv father had been pointed to me as passing in the morning. From that period mj health gradually declined ; and mo per¬ sons who (by what order I knew not,) occasionally visited me, becanm si alarm¬ ed at my haggard and listless aspect, that thev removed me from Mr. S.'s; aud holievmg that a change of air was all the relief 1 required, scut meto the wilds of Cumberland. The change did indeed relieve me, but H was by operating on sources of my vor. í r
complaint utterly beyond their compre¬ hension: when I stood no longer at the window where I seemed for ever to hear the sounds, 4f there is your father," and from which, while it was day-light, there was no forcing me; while I no longer fixed my straining eyes on the spot where his carriage had disappeared for ever; when in sleep I no longer seem¬ ed to hang upon its wheels, aud call upon him till the sound died in my lips; when all this ceased, with change of place, my health recovered gradually, I lived with a clergyman, who was both my host and tutor. His house, or rather cot¬ tage, stood amid the most wild and ærial scenery of the lakes. I have no inten¬ tion of making the reader scan the heights of Helvellyn, or fol U w the wind¬ ings of Dovedale. But the effect of this scenery on my character was power¬ ful, and almost с ι eat i ve. All the wandering rays of feeling or
imagination I possessed, were concen¬ tred and conducted by the glorious ob¬ jects with which I became familiar. My heart wasted its energies on rock and wood, and water. When I first arrived there, I loved to hear child ren talk of their parents ; and í often gazed earnest¬ ly in the faces of those who ï thought might satisfy the yearnings of my soul, if thev would ; but the name of father never passed my lips When his idea came to my mind, I would гшЬ out with the swiftness of a stag, and try, by climbing and running, to lose myself in the violence of motion. By this means my health grew robust imperceptibly; and to pass my days and evenings amid mountain-breeze^, and the healthful strife of exercise was changed from an impulse into an habit. What dreams were mine for three years! In my wanderings, my mind did not wa^fe itself in marking the shapes of p a
clouds, or counting the circles made by a pebble in the water ; it was stored with precious and pregnant imagery. Mv tutor was at least an excellent scho- lar ; I read with him more of the an¬ cients than bojs often read in schools or colleges. He was too indolent to make my education a task ; and we read with intervals and interruptions that facilitated the progress of a mind irre¬ gular and restless like mine. In his study, if it deserved the name, were some books which he had brought with him from Oxford, and never opened since; they were odd volumes of Dry- den, Lee, and the dramatists of Charles the Second's time, Milton, Shakespeare, The Arabian Nights Entertainments, Hey wood's Hierarchy of the Blessed Angcb, Grose's popular Superstitions, Glanvilles History of Witchcraft, Ma- cria Adámico, a work verv old and cearce, of which the author purports to be Rav-
mondLully, and Percy's and Evan's col¬ lections of old English ballads. What a library for a boy of fifteen, w ho tra¬ versed the solitude of lakes and moun¬ tains in the day, and paused to read them amid the evening murmur of winds, and dashing of waterfalls! I became an in¬ curable visionary. The ancient authors I read, instead of correcting, confirmed this habitude. It is a xevy different thing to read an author at the narrow desk, and in the gross-heated atmosphere of a school ; and amid objects which form a comment on the text of the poet, where the mountain air is waving among the pages, and the light that falls on them is chequered by the leaves of a gigantic oak. During three years, my life was a species of romantic intoxica¬ tion. The reading of Ossian completed my infatuation. But there was one exercise of mind to which I was so м rong! v iu- r S
clined, that at length all my meditations tended to, and were lost in it. Amid the ?pots of quiet clouds that lay scattered over the evening sky, like islands on the great deep; I have imagined some fortu-* nate spot, some abode peopled by fair forms, human in their affections, their habits, in every thing but vice and weak¬ ness; to these I have imagined myself giving laws, and becoming their sove¬ reign and their benefactor. The idea was sufficiently chimerical, for in a state of innocence there was по occasion for restraint ; and in the equali¬ ty produced by universal excellence, there was no room for sovereign or supe·* rior. I was therefore compelled to ad¬ mit some shades into tbe character of my imaginary community; but I resolved they should be such as held a latent affinity with virtue, or could be easily reconciled to it by legislative discipline and cultivation. I therefore imagined
thera possessed of the most shining qualities tbat can enter into the human character, glowing with untaught af¬ fections, and luxuriant with uncultivated virtue; but proud, irritable, impetuous, indolent, and superstitious; conscious of claims they knew not how to support, burnmg with excellencies, which, be¬ cause they wanted regulation, wanted both dignity and utility; and disgraced by crimes which the moment after their commission they lamented, as a man la¬ ments the involuntary outrages of drunk¬ enness. I imagined a people tbat seemed to stretch out its helpless hands, like the infant Moses from the ark, and promise its preserver to bless and dignify the spe* cies. When I had conceived this character, such was its consistency, its гтаг$ет~ Ыапсе, that I immediately concluded it to be real. I was satisfied there existed such a people—with the hesitation of one f 4
who fears bis purpose is suspected, 1 mentioned the character I had conceived to my tutor, and asked if be thought it possible that any people were distin¬ guished by such features. He answered immediately, that I had accurately de¬ scribed the Irish nation. From that moment a firm and habitual purpose took possession of my soul. It was my mornings meditation, it was the vision of my night. To be the reformer and legislator of a country I had never seen> nor with one native of which I was acquainted, may perhaps excite a smile of the most piteous contempt ; yet, from the effects of this suggestion on my own mind, I am convinced, it is to such mu¬ sings that we are to trace the source of those lonely, remote events, which have agitated the world, and changed the most settled aspect of things.
CIIAr III. It was in the spring of the year that my tutor was somewhat surprized at re cei ving the following letter. London, April ]0. DEAR SIR, (< 1 should have written before to thank you for the pains you have be- stowed on my son's health and education; but these cursed easterly winds------ in short, every circumstance in this infernal country compels me to execrate my own existence. At (his moment, the venders of the vilest commodities are vociferating below my window, mv verv window. in Paris, (while it wîïs Paris) the hotels were enclosed in spacious areas, and the
intrusions of the canaille effectually pre¬ vented. But to return to my son, I am sensible I have not paid him all the atten¬ tion I ought. Possibly it was fortunate for him, as it was the means of placing him, sir, under vour tuition. From such a mode of education, I should indeed have recoiled in my earlier days. But what signifies educating men for polished enjoyments now? there is no polish, no enjoyment; the world has lost all capa¬ city of giving pleasure, or perhaps I have lost all capacity for admitting it. So much the better, the fine champaign of life is all drawn ofi', and only the vapid tecs are left. I remember the time ; but #omen are no longer women, wiue is no longer wine, I believe I am no longer myself. I remember the time when------ yet, curse me, if I have so much pleasure in remembering those times either. But 1 have no business to tcazc you with my
morbid petulance. I understand, my very good sir, your pupil has grown tail and awkward, and headstrong; you see 1 give him credit for all the accomplish¬ ments a youth educated in England can be supposed to possess. I have felt the disadvantage of not residing in the coun¬ try where my property lies. I mean, therefore, that Ormsby shall graduate in the University of Dublin, and reside finally in Ireland, The disadvantage of his birth will be overlooked there, or considered rather as a compliment to the country. I iutend that his education shall be rigidly regular. By Heave»., I will empty the whole magazine of die«* с ipline on him. Since there are no com* forts in vice, I will prove that there are some rigours in virtue too. He shall not have the advantage of me both ia pleasure and in praise. I understand my agent has settled with you annually for his board, &c. Be pleased tø accept $f ν tí
the enclosed as a mark of my gratitude for your attention to your pupil. I remain, &c. &c. &c. LIONEL M. BETHEL." My tutor was much disturbed at the necessity of answering his correspondent, , whom 1 now understood to be a man of large fortune, and splendid connexions. Whether he suspected me of a degree of refinement, he did not possess himself, I cannot tell ; but he requested me to re¬ vise his answer, which was as follows. SIR, ζ{ 1 received yours of the 10th instant, which came safe to hand ; but for a small accident it met by falling into my shav¬ ing-pot, which however did not signify a rush, your hand being tolerably legi¬ ble, considering how much you have lived in outlandish parts. As to the east- 4iilv winds, they have been vuy rife \ix
our parts; but how they could obstruct your letter, I cannot conceive, unless it was to come partly by water. You speak also of certain venders and vile commo¬ dities under your window. I am asto¬ nished how the police of London can suf¬ fer such things ; my maid remove* ţhem here everv morning:. ' ŕ * As to your champaign all being drawn off, I am sorry for it ; but cannot say I ever took much to foreign wines, never having tasted any but once at a fellow-commoner's treat, when being overtaken in liquor, 1 was found in the quadrangle, and reprimanded by the dean. As to your son, he is a very good young man; but a little flighty or so, which perhaps runs in the family, where¬ by he is not to blame. 1 saw some lines in a poem at a friends, which exactly describe his character. ( I have not the poem myself, because it was written by a Scotsman;) the lines run thus :
*« Tn sooth,-he was arrange and wayward wight, «· Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene." And the like, which I have forgot, ** In truth, it grieves my heart to part with the boy; but I thank you, sir, for the ffteft. In truth, I would give as much money again to keep him with me. The country to which you are sending him is a very wild place. I pray Hea¬ ven they may not turn him Papist or wild Irishman among them. I should have sent you his last exercise ; but supposing you do not understand Latin, Remain your's, &c. J. ADAMS." The letter quenched at least half my desire to see my father. The allusion, so abruptly u ade, to my illegitimacy, shocked and incensed me against one w ho could insult the misfortune he had occa¬ sioned. Yet with all my resentment, a
secret sentiment of pleasure mingled it¬ self with the discovery. There is per¬ haps in every mind an habit of consider¬ ing persons in my circumstances as pecu¬ liarly marked out for the great and ex¬ traordinary events of life. This conclu¬ sion, with whatever justice, I drew at once in my own case ; it accorded with the habitual object of my mind, and it reconciled me to imaginary degradation. I quitted England without seeing my father, and arrived in smother country with no more knowledge of my destina¬ tion, than that which I carried within my own breast. I was placed in the house of a strict Dissenter, and entered the University of Dublin. Perhaps it is expected that I should here speak a few words of that institution. Too much ridicule has been heaped upon it. It has been upbraided with a stupidity, an in¬ dolence, a lameness of proficiency, which have been in a great measure the result 4
of circumstances unavoidable, aud how unalterable, in the frame of the institu¬ tion. In the first place, the fellows, in¬ stead of being the lean, secluded stu¬ dents of a cloister, whom it would be as difficult to solicit from its walls, as to make the effigy of its founder descend from his monument, are the inmates of a populous and dissipated city, husbands, fathers of families, men on fire in the pursuit of various distinctions, as church¬ men, as preachers, as agreeable and con¬ vivial men, formed to embellish mixed society, and allured to it by every tie that has power over the most w orldly and tumultuous faculties of the mind. By their obligations as tutors, they are com¬ pelled to devote the most numerous hours of the early and vigorous part of life to the tuition of youth. On the number of these their profits principally depend ; and a number, of these they therefore endeavour to secure, by adopting tbc
manners, and frequenting the assemblies of the world. When this period is passed, their capacity for business has passed away along with it; they are elderly men, saturated with the iiksome routine of collegiate duties, and anxious* by accepting some college living, to es-* cape from tumultuous to pacific indo¬ lence» Are these men who can be ex¬ pected to illuminate the world with those laborious lucubrations, which can only be produced by the union of unbroken solitude, unambitious competence, con¬ genial stillness, and habitual application ? Another defect in the constitution of the Dublin University I shall notice, without inquiring whether it is original or vo¬ luntary : I mean the total neglect of the most valuable part of literature, modern and native literature, the study of the English language, its writers, its powers, aud its productions, the extent of its re¬ sources, the laws of its composition, and
the graces of its delivery. Instead of this, the quarterly examinations (a noble exercise of tbe youthful mmd and pas¬ sions, if rightly applied, ) are exhausted in a strife of scholastic quatntness, and hereditary subtleties, which, without en¬ larging the mind, or unfolding the prin-» ciples of science, excites a temporary tension, a petulant precocity, an ambi¬ tious and straining spirit of conjecture in the mind, more worthy of a Jesuiti¬ cal seminary, or an examination in the metaphysical grammary of Thomas Aquinas. The consequence is, that men educated in the College of Dublin, without an immediate view to collegiate distinctions, are in seneral eminenti ν destitute of col* legiate improvement; the flimsy furni¬ ture requisite for this temporary strug¬ gle is soon thrown aside; and when thrown aside, forgotten for ever : while the substantial panoply that qualifies for
à literary encounter, that cleaves to us even when the period for its use is over— the net of the retiarius, can only be em¬ ployed in the combat; but the arras of the soldier give a fr form and pressure/* and military mould, to the limbs, which dignifies the veteran even in the hour of repose. The students in the University of Dublin are not educated with any con¬ sideration for the peculiar faculties of distinct minds; all are alike compelled to read the same portion of the classics and the sciences; there are few encou·* ragements to voluntary application, few outlets for the natural propensities of the genius : yet it is perhaps to such acci¬ dental remissions of the rigour of uni¬ formity, such allowed digressions from the path of discipline, that we owe its most felicitous and luxuriant expansions. This, however, may be considered as the necessary evil of every academic institu-
tion ; but there is another of much greater magnitude and mischief. I mean the total absence of a final view and refer¬ ence to the u -ι s of life, and the ornament of profession, и the collegiate education. The superiors of it seem to undergo the same defcet in mental vision, that the vulgar do in actual, when they refer the stars of heaven to the concave in which they appear to be placed, without consi¬ dering them as belonging to a peculiar sphere, and pouring light on space as yet unmeasured and unseen. The use of the principles of logic in every part of life can only be disputed by those who are destitute of its advantages ; but I am far from seeing the use of that puzzling and abstract examination in its subtleties, which only excites the vanity of prema¬ ture and unprofitable acuteness, I shall be thought perhaps to rebel against all collegiate authority, when I decry the other parts of science ; yet might it not
he asked of what probable or general use can the Elements of Euclid, the ascent of fluids in capillary tubes, or the revolu¬ tions of the cycloid be to the divine, the lawyer, or the physician ? I am much mistaken if one student in an hundred carries home with him a taste for, or even recollection of those topics which were only cultivated as supplying the tempo¬ rary triumphs of the hall. It cannot be urged that it is the duty of a learned boy to cultivate the more abtrusc parts of science, as its rewards are promised tö those who are distinguished by scientific attainments. The number of fellows is ivventy-two, that of the students may amount to some hundreds ; according to this answer therefore, the object of thk single fountain of national education, is (probably) to make fwenty-two"podanK and some hundred« of dunces. If it be indeed necessary for the superiors of this institution to be po*se c i?cd of certain
cabbala of science^ incommunicable, and useless in general society, on which they themselves seldom write, and never con¬ verse; yet surely men, whose destination is for the world and its busiest scenes, may be exempted from an obligation to study what it h almost a duty to forget when in the world. Would not the study of English lite¬ rature, including (possibly the bent pro¬ ductions in) history, the more proximate parts of na ural philosophy, civil, rheto¬ rical, critical, and poetical researches, together with the elements of theology, and (most important of all) a summary, but comprehensive view of the evidences of revealed religion, be of more conse* quence to them, as men and citizens, than what Milton, in his tractate of education, calls the "Intellective Ab¬ stractions" of science, in which they only acquire acuteness without penetra- tHHb an habit of combination without
comparison, a desire of discovery with* out investigation ? I know the subjects which I consider as most important to the student are not entirely overlooked by the University of Dublin ; but they are taught superficially and incidentally, rewards for them are not so frequent, nor is distinction in them ( considered as ) so honorable. The spirit of these studies is not kept alive by frequent subjects of composition being assigned, by large pre¬ mi urns, and by public competition, while diligence is eicouraged, and emulation inflamed at the quarterly examinations, by praise and profit, and celebrity, and a general spirit of exhilarated stimula¬ tion, and almost dramatic display, by every thing that can rouse the ambition of talent, and the ardour of youth. What I have said unfavourable of this institution, 1 have said with sincerity and regret, not as ^censure of faults I have laboured to detects but as an apology for
failings which my zeal to discover ex¬ cellence may perhaps have magnified. Should the time ever arrive, when edu¬ cation shall be conducted in subserviency to the purposes of life, and colleges shall be considered as vestibules to the great temple of active knowledge, the univer¬ sity shall see the curse and the reproach of her barrenness removed, and her off¬ spring, like Hannah's, more favoured than that of her reproachful rival. Con¬ sidering merely their native powers of intelligence and application, I know no men more calculated to give to learning the graces of facility, the value of u*e, and the dignity of virtue, than the fel¬ lows and students of the University of Dublim Such has been the result of my obsei- vation on this institution ; my proficient* ν in it was moderate, for my mind was oc¬ cupied by other meditations. On my first arrival in (he countrv, I flattered
myself that I was studying the national character and tracing the germs of pa¬ triotism and courage in the face of a peasant, till I found myself gazing on a public building, or an equipage whose whirl stunned me as it passed. There is, perhaps, no discovery so morí if) ing as this to a Paoli or a Kosciusko of sixteen. At length I suffered mvseif to sink into the stream of things, sent out every sense in quest of objects of novelty, and in every interval of solitude stamped and writhed under the burden of vacancy, and compared myself to Telemachus ш the Isle of Calypso. But I was soon occupied by other objects, objects which made even my political enthusiasm disappear like a morning's dream ; and earth with all its varieties disappear with it. There are in the Uiiiven/ty of Dublin, as in every other, a number of students devoted to what are called evangelical principles, vol. i. о
that is, with very few exceptions, to strict Calvinism. They exist in a state of secrecy which U is their delight and their employment to maintain ; for narrow minds are fond of petty policy. This concealment is however necessary, for the superiors of the college are with rea¬ son judged to he averse to Calviuistic principles, whose direction commonly leads their professors to enter into the dissenting ministry. The society is kept together by frequent assemblings, pray¬ ers, and discourses, wailings over the degeneracy of the Established Church, and denunciations .ι« ainst those who keep the key of know led, e from the world, 4£ who arc destroyed by its lack/' If ¡s impossible, without heieg a mem¬ ber of such an instituí ion» te ie- igine its eifecls on ihe mind» of young nun whose religion was the religion of passion, and who were ):ut too ил\ b ílaítered by such a relig ; '.m. Ihe svstem of Cah iu is
amazingly splendid and awful. A youth*· ful mind in its first pursuit of religion» neither inquires for evidence, nor wishes conviction ; it demands something that may fill to the utmost its capacity of the marvellous ; something under which its faculties may succumb in mute acquies¬ cence ; something that requires not the labour of ascent ; but the passiveness of prostration. To such demands the Cal· viuistic system is abundant! ν adequate. I am not about to discuss the faite- hood or the truth of the system, but merely to state its effects on mv own ima¬ gination and feelings. W hen I «peak of Calcinimi, í speak of it not as it exists in the writings of that veft rmcr, but in the w (irks of the Presbv ferian writers, particularly the silenced ministers of Charles the Second's time, together with the more modem ones of the American divines, Edwards, Flavel, &c. ; and the still more modern, Hervey, Romaine, g 2
Doddridge, &c. These men, whatever may be said of the truth or conformity to scripture in their opinions, had the power of recommending them most for¬ cibly to the imagination. The great evil to be dreaded in a reli¬ gious system, is that debility and dejec¬ tion which a mind, unnaturally divided from the world and its ordinary exercises, is but too apt to resign itself h>—that burden and heat of the day, under which the most vigorous labourer has sunk, when the freshness of novelty has ceased, and the temptation of reward is still distant, This they have endeavoured to exclude, by keeping the mind in a tumult of trembling solicitude or raptur¬ ous elevation, by dividing the long path of duty into strongly-marked stages ; as¬ signing to each its peculiar hopes and fears, and stí ggles and triumphs, dimi¬ nishing weariness by perpetual variety, abridging di* ance by the intervention of
new objects, alarming tbe secure by the fears of declension, and stimulating the urgent by shouts of promise the most sanguine and inspiring. They represent the state of the religionist, under the strongest images that the most vivid and awakening representations of the Jewish h ist or ν can afford. He who is about to commence a religious course, is described as a Lot, fleeing from the devoted cities of the plain ; as a murderer, whom the avenger of blood has pursued to the very gates of refuge ; sometimes in the milder metaphors of the New Testament, as one who sits with listening watchfulness at the door of hope, as one who waits for the passing sound of blessed steps, and extorts by loud and restless importunity the gift of spiritual light. Those who are supposed to have attained the divine favour, are described as in a state of endless warfare: men, devils, and the world, are in an uproar of hostility G ·>
against them ; persons who regard them with perfect tranquillity, are represented as leagued for their eternal ruin ; their persecutions are more mischievous, be¬ cause thev are not %iolent ; adder's poison is under their lips when they smile, and their kiss ь ihe kiss of Judas. The spi¬ ritual mail must not be unlocked, nor the arm relaxed for a moment : all the universe is in arms against the repose of a garret, which is not perhaps visited but îv the foot of its inmate; and amid these menaces of danger, and clamours of encouragement, the initiated walk on enchanted ground, and see Satan fall, like lightening from Heaven, at his progress. 'W !*eiher this be a just statement of the positions of Revelation 1 do not propose to examine, but its effects on me were all that could be expected from the union of fancy and passion, with a system of religion tua t flattered both. These num of whom I spoke, had
marked my pensive and solitary habits, my d iindence, my absence, and pei haps a certain consciousness of something above tbe common meditations of youth ; they immediately marked me down as a con¬ vert, and to make a convert of me was not difiit ult. Tbe change was fiattering to other than religious feelings. Every man naturally feels a degne of envy, mixed with latent dislike, to characters eminent for learning or piHy. 'Tis a na¬ tural jealousy of a superiority which is deiermined by no intrinsic piiuciple. but elfeded by aen -hut or by balut. 'Tis common I belie» e to all minds, but it is inseparable from minds of grasp and am¬ bition. U was peculiarly the failing of mine. But to see myself in one moment, bv an instantaneous a id vohmtarv change of opinions, enabled to look down with that contemptuous pity which lurking habed loves to indulge, on those whose Cï4
proficiency in the paths of excellence seemed hitherto to have left me at an in¬ vidious distance, to sit shaking an head of angry despondency, under sermons that edified a numerous and enlightened congregation; and to pray with splenetic zeal for mercy on the sleeping watchmen, w ho were at the very moment defending their post with the vigour of talent, and the zeal of talent ;— to do this, was but too gratifying to the jealous and petu¬ lant pride of young men, over whom the authority they decryed, held an imme¬ diate and biting controul, whose recol¬ lection aggravated their bitterness. But there was employment sometimes for bet¬ ter feelings in our assemblies ; the studi¬ ous perusal of the Scriptures, the effusion of youthful eloquence, the contagion of mutual exhortation, and the ardour of general devotion, communicated to us sensations that 1 jet remember with plea¬ sure, though not convinced that their
source was either iti reason or devotion. The spirit of our institution was concen¬ tred and kept alive, by an habit which is inseparable from such a system—the habit of compassing sea and land to make a proselyte. Our method was very simple and summary; the heir of a feudal house in Scotland was compelled to empty an horn that contained a gallon, in proof of his having attained the age to claim the honors of his ancestors : we compelled our convert to swallow a long and gall¬ ing draught from the fountaiu of Calvin, as a test of his proficiency. We de¬ lighted to make the stammerer pronounce the kibboleth of a language, of which he yet knew not the elements nor the articu¬ lation. I shall give a short specimen of our mode of conversion—it was an un¬ successful attempt of my own ; I dis¬ played before my catechumen the whole armory of Calviuistic warfare. о 5
1 concluded with placing before him the rubicon of predestination, which if once passed, I hoped forbad all retreat. He was a lad of plain intellects ; he was shocked and alarmed. Ci You must believe predestination/' said I. <£ 'Tis impossible," said he. ' ( Tis impossible that you should hope for safety else/' said 1. i( I can never belies e it," said he. fi You will be damned if you do not/' said I. Ci Why then damn me if I do/ said he. I never saw him more,-------J only mention these circumstances, be¬ cause in describing my character,! would deseribe the causes which contributed to its peculiarities, because í would have some calculation of the force, and some indulgence for the еч^еьчсч of an enthu¬ siasm, which was at once the enthusiasm of nature, politics, and religion. But my enthusiasm was not long to be the dream of solitud**. Before 1 had
been a year in I) abi in, I received a letter from my father, informing me, he and bis family were on their way to Ireland ; that he had a seat in the west, to which he proposed retiring, and taking me with him, that I might acquire the habits of a country resident, and conciliate the favor of my uncle, on whom much depended. This letter left enough open to solicitude ; it neither informed me of the number, nor relations of the family, with whom I was to domesticate, nor anv thing relating to this important uncle. But my nih.d ex¬ panded at a change of situation, and 1 felt at the approach of new relatives, the hope and fear of aifectiou. From the person with whom I lived, I could learn nothiu^: my father, though a native of Ireland, had not resided iu it ¡since his youth, so 1 was compelled to pacify myself by w Mies, and calculations, and incessant perusals of the letter, in which no diligerne could discover ailec- o 0
tion. The vessel in which they embarked for Dublin, from some part of the coast of Lancaster, was so beset by unfavorable winds, that they were at length compelled to land in an obscure port in the north of Ireland; and my father, exhausted by fatigue and illness, determined to travel by slow stages across the country to his western villa:—alikeaverse from the dis¬ tresses of navigation, or the tumults of Dublin. He sent his Frenchman in his chariot to acquaint me with this arrange¬ ment, and to desire me to join him in Connaught as soon as possible. I obeyed him directly. My fellow-traveller appeared likely to gratify the feelings with which my heart was swelling. He was my father's con¬ fidential servant, he had lived with him many years, and be had all the communi¬ cativeness of his nation. But with the true officious politeness of a Frenchman,, he would speak nothing
but English, though I wished to converse with him in his native tongue, which I spoke with sufficient fluency, and in com¬ pliment to me he persisted in talking bad English with a French accent and idiom, iu preference to a medium of language common to us both. With the com¬ municativeness, he united much of the superficial kuowledge of a Frenchman, he had been intimate with many parts of life. He was a vehement aristocrat, and execrated the modern regime. He began by repeating some fragments of the classics which he had learned while a porter at one of the foreign colleges, and expatiated on the beneficial effects of a system in those seminaries, which compelled the students to get a great part of the classics off by heart, as an exercise of memory. I observed that the University of Dublin paid more attention to the cultivation of sciences than of languages.
He replied, i( It was then a pity that the University of Dublin did not adopt the Marchioness du Chateleťs comment on Newton's philosophy/'— ff Is it not still better, monsieur, that we study Newton in his own text ?"— ff Ah nou, monsieur, Newton was a very weak writer, he said some good things, but depend on it he never would have been noticed but for the Marchioness du Chatelet/* fi I understood," said I cc Newton was sufficiently popular, before he had tiie honor of being noticed by the marchio¬ ness/ 5 "lean assure you, monsieur," said he, (C that he would never have been known in France, but for that fortunate елелй." 1 now found that France and the world weie synonimous in the language of a Frenchman. After this national defeat, I attempted to lead up another column of literature, and observed that the English
had improved so much in polite letters since the institution of their colleges, that it was to be lamented part of the col¬ legiate studies did not include the classical compositions in their own lan¬ guage. M. Masseau admitted that our polite literature must have undergone some improvement since the reign of Queen Anne, tf For/'said he ( ' about that time you might have learned to compose tragedies, as one of your authors was prompted by the good genius of your nation to translate Racine's Andro- maque. Another, I believe, attempted to communicate to you tbe beauties of Oorueille'b Cid, and before that/' said he, " I believe Mr. Dry den attempted to Translate Dn Fresuoy s Art of Painting/* Ju vaiu 1 endeavoured to undeceive him with regard to these productions, and assure him that many English tragedie* »- ~ ч were held in higher value than thefrans- laiious he mentioned. To strike me
dumb, he reminded me that the Cid had been translated by (Cibher) the laureat, as a resistless argument of the dignity of the undertaking, for in the imagination of this homme de vielle cour, whatever was connected with royalty must be great, and a work translated by the poet laureat must have been a work to which the nation looked up for delight and illumi¬ nation. To prove that we were not wholly unacquainted with the tone of poetry before the date he mentioned, I at length ventured to pronounce the names of Shakespeare and Milton. He started with evident displeasure, but recovering himself, observed that Milton might have polished his native barbarism, as he understood he had passed some time at Paris during his tour: " mais, mon¬ sieur/' added he, " what poetry could be expected from a man who hated kings, and wore latchcts in his shoes > >y I ob¬ served that the manners of a court ( par-
ticularly that of Charles the 2d) had little conciliating in them to the purity of Milton's mind." " It was the only civilized court England ever saw," replied M. Masseau, (t the manners were perfectly French." . This was unanswerable, Of Shake¬ speare he spoke as indignantly as ever Voltaire did. t( That author," said he, tc has not more than a scene or two in rhime in any one of his plays/' I ventured to ask was it not possible that poetry could speak any language but that of rhime ; he stared at me as if I wanted to new-mode! his creed, ar*d thes answered, (i When did you hear, monsieur, of the French tragedians, having used any other ?" Weary of his dogmatising, I turned the discourse to my family. He said, it consisted of my father, mademoiselle his daughter, and her governess. I asked with a burning cheek, if my father had been married,
if Non, monsieur, he was un Ь.чпте d($ bonnes fortunes, he had many arrange¬ ments, and would never have known the number of his children, had not un malheur triste compelled bun to inquire into how many chances of comfort were left him." i( What malheur was so fortunate for his family ľ' said Ï. — ίζ He had a soiij monsieur, ihe finest youth in the world, whom he had with him írom the иг*!, and whom he was fond of à la folie. They lived in France, and lived like brothers; they had their separate arrangements ; they neither envied nor censibeu each other ; it was a spectacle of improvem*"»:' for the whole world. At length,, the horrid revolution drove them from France; thev came to England, aud imagined they still might liv« 1 , as iu Fiane; .

' ( Momieur was at first overcome by the shock, he threw himself on the corse, and in his despair used some expressions, altogether unworthy the greatness of his soul ; he accused himself as the murderer of his child, and bewailed tbe example, whose influence had led him to end a life of vice by an untimely death. As for me, I wept, I lamented, I made myself unhappy a thousand ways, but still I remembered that the young Monsieur B. had perished, as every homme galant would wish, After this, vour father's spirits and health declined rapidly ; I did every thing ï could, I prepared les peliti soupers, aud Us petits fillette* i\* usual.
But he had lost all relish for either ! in fact he soon conceived the idea of col¬ lecting the remains of his family, and retiring with them to Ireland. I ex¬ pressed a sensible regret at this resolution, which he mistook for an unwillingness to accompany him. He therefore offered me a splendid douceur, and a thousand thanks for my services. But a Frenchman knows not how to leave a master who values a Frenchman. Penetrated with the most lively despair at the thoughts of deserting him, I threw myself at his feet, and declared my resolution to follow him, even to Ireland. I by no means despair of passing a tolerable life even here; every where there are means of pleasure to a Frenchman, and to make perpetual plea¬ sures for myself, fait tø ut ma philosophie. *' When I looked at the little shrivelled figure, which, in all the deformity of old age, aggravated by the extreme of anti¬ quated fashion, promised itself " per-
pctual pleasures," I could hardly suppress a smile. He observed it, and supposing it excited by his vivacity, began to give proofs of it, I could have dispensed with; he sung chansons d amour in a voice that drowned the rattle of the wheels, and when we stopped for the ñrst night, re¬ quested to have the honor of discovering for me some peti έ demoiselle, pour passer к temps/' I declined his services, and the colour which I could not prevent mounting to my very forehead, filled him with a sur¬ prise which was very visibly mingled with contempt. On the evening of the second day, we passed through Ban.igl er, a town at the extremity of Leinster, at whose foot flows the Shannoib dividing that province from Connaught. Wc crossed a bridge of some antiquity, and were in the west of Ireland. For some way, the road,followingthe windings
of the Shannon, and varied by the eminences on its shores, was beautiful Delighted with the contrast between these green and winding roads, and the joyless bogs of the King's County, I gazed about me, till Masseau pointing out to me on the bank of the river a cluster of ash and poplar, among which rose the roof of a villa, informed me that was mv father's residence, lie had called it Lemon-grove from a sickly imitation of the luxuriant verdure of France, which he had endeavoured to introduce into tbe plantations. 1 sprung from the carriage with au heart that longed to love. I saw none but servants : after some inquirv, Masseau learned that my father bad re¬ tired to his room, that this was a signal for universal silence, that Madame la Gouvernante had therefore gone И her study where she usually* passed her evenings, and my sister io her apartment, which neither of them quitted till tbe
first signs of life were given from the invalid's chamber next morning. I threw myself on a sopha dispirited; tbe servants approached to inquire if I wanted any thing, I answered myself, i( A father :'* willing however to con¬ ciliate him by an early obedience to his modes of life, I desired to be shewn to my room ; it was twilight, ami while the servant went for (and les, I heard a light step approaching the room, I raised my head, a female figure stood tremblingly at the door. sr If you are my brother," said a soft voice, " tell me so, for 1 have risked much to see you io-night." I rose, and approached her, we had never met be¬ fore ; but the co.íííde.'ue of nature was in our hearts; we embraced, and ev- piv^d our delight at meeting, and when ц e had done so, repeated it again: for mutual irmmu'ce piecluded communica¬ tion, vse nad nothing to ask or relate but our iov
Lights were now brought in ; I drew my sister to the seat from which I had riser*, and gazed on her; her age appeared about my own, her figure slight, her face pale, her manners timid and dejected. She had no beauty but of expression, and no graces but those of simplicity and affection. " My father/'said she, rf is a wretched invalid. He passes the day in pain, and the night in sleeplessness; of what rest he can get, he is therefore very covetous, and we retire early that it may not be disturbed, but I am sure when he sees you he will love you ; only enter his room quietly, and take care not to praise the climate. As to Miss Percival, you will find it not so easy to conciliate, or father to conquer her, for %jc is a great disputant, and the most terrible scholar breathing; she gives no quarter, and death or victory must be your motto, if you engage with her. But she is a woman of great talents no doubt, as my constant 4
head-aches can testify. Dear, dear Orrasby, how I have longed for a brother, or any thing to love in this place: thne is so much reasoning, and no conviction, and so much indisposition, without any tenderness, that I think I scarce have had an happy moment till this." This happi¬ ness however we were afraid to prolong ; we again whispered our joy and aficction. and separated,

CHAPTER IV. I waited in the morning, like a school¬ boy who expects to be called to a task. I was at length summoned to breakfast, at which I found my sister presiding, and Miss Percival reading. The latter pos¬ sessed traces of distinguished beauty still diffused over a form no longer young, and evidently impaired by ill-health. She addressed me with more emotion than I expected, which however she instantly suppressed. " I don't know to what hours you are accustomed, Ormsby/* said Sybilla, attempting domestic conversation, " but I conjectured that as a traveller you would not like to he summoned too early/* " How often have I told you," said Miss P. u to consider the division of time is voluntary and artificial, one of the numerous abuses of the present system
How absurd to conceive an union be¬ tween the calls of appetite or any other of the animal functions, and the motions of a clock." (( I only apprehended my brother might be fatigued," said Sybilla. (< There is no such thing as fatigue," said Miss P. fi Fatigue is only an acknowledge¬ ment that matter predominates over mind; an acknowledgement, extorted not from truth, but from weakness: were the mind sufficiently abstracted hi itspeculiar opera¬ tions, 'tis highly possible that a man might be running full speed all his life, without being conscious of it, and go round the world for the same purpose that others sit down to study." I alfected to admire this improvement mi the Peripatetic philoso¬ phy, but the lady disclaimed any resem¬ blance, she spoke of the ancients with contempt; ίζ What," said she, (e could be the result of efforts made by beings, of whom many believed in a God, and some even held the utility of religion ? It w*. η 3
reserved for this age to be blest by the instructions of sages, who first unfolded the omnipotence of mind, the perfecti¬ bility of man, the mortality of the soul, and the non-existence of an intelligent cause. But alas!" she continued, ťf what has been the reward of their zeal, and the result of their labours! some of them have been pumped, some put in the pillory, many hissed and pelted from the tribunes, whence they were about to dispense illumination, and many driven to the «rcai western wilderness, to sow the seeds of intel le» tual regeneration, amid the unso¬ phisticated sons of nature, whom wc term the savages of North and South America/* Sybilia threw up her eyes in painful resignation; at this moment my father's heil rung, and Masseau came in to inform me, he would see me, a summons I ex- peefedwith impatience still. As I hesitated ¡hi his door, I would have given a world fer positive instruction«, how to approach
hím, and please hira by my approach, but when it was opened, I yielded to the impulse that thrilled through mc, and rushing forward, I knelt by his knee, and called him, " Father/' if Vastly well, vastly well indeed, ' said he in a weak, querulous tone, i£ you have been instructed to do all this, and you do honor to your instructions/* r î hope I do," said I rising, and recovering myself {e for my instructor was my ovvi* heart/' i( Are you so anxious to display that you are six feet high," said he sharply, 'that you cannot bear the posture of aficction for one moment ?" iC Oh tell me only what posture to assume, what Ian· guage to speak, tell me but what will please you, and"------ *' You have asked a most painful question, 1 ktiovv not what can please me, I wish I could discover it myself; perhaps with your assistance—but no—no—it м- 3
would be cursed meanness in me to be pleased with what I can enjoy, nowv when I have lost all that is worth enjoy¬ ing/* <( And I have just found all I would wish to enjoy/' « What h that ?" ' f A parent," ( ' True, and in most de¬ lectable circumstances, just where every tall, florid, forward boy of sixteen would wish to find a parent, feeble, and sickly, and dispirited, that he may insult him with hk youth and spirit ; tell me now plainly, a*nt you proud of the contrast between us ?" "1 am, for l feeî proud of the powers that may be employed for your amusement, for your recovery/' He looked at me earnestly, the flush of speaking was over, my face was on fire with tears and blushes. " I have half a mind to punish you by taking you at your w ord, and making you give me my drops this moment/* I turned round eagerly to Masseau for the drops ; the good-na¬ tured Frenchman gave them to me as eagerly, my father swallowed them from
my hand. (( A Ganymede," said he; f< but curse me if you can convert ether and laudanum iuto nectar. But go away, child, ( for remember a child you must beto please me) go away, for you are too like your brother Everard in every motion, except that he never offered to give mc my drops." The family did not assemble till dinner, then the conflict commenced, to which Sybilla had alluded ; the per¬ petual conflict of jarring opinions, and feelings, and habits. \ et I was still so unacquainted with them, that I attended more to their persons than their conver¬ sation. My father was a diminutive figure, whose motions, when not distorted by pain, possessed exquisite grace, and whose manners, when not discoloured by the gloom of ill-health and spleen, dis¬ played the most dazzling polish of arti¬ ficial suavity. A slight observation con¬ firmed the character his letters iudicated*. и 4
He was an enervated libertine, who had lost the pleasures of sense, and had no others to supply their place ; yet he wab sufficiently intellectual to feci the abuse of early advantages, and had sensibility enough to feel that he might have ac¬ quired virtue and happiness: but the con¬ viction came too late to bring any thing but pain to a mind vitiated by indulgence, and embittered by disease. His pride and his habits alike forbad him to believe that there were pleasures w hieb he had not en¬ joyed ; he loathed the idea of moderate enjoyment, or domestic peace; he -brunk from the names of sensibility, aifectiou, or worth, because he hated to reproach himself with their past neglect, and feared to he reminded of their future respon¬ sibility. He treated all pretensions to qualities which he had not possessed or valued as affectation and imposture; and gave every o^e credit for the vices he had practised
w hcther guilty of them or not. i( Every man/ 1 he often said, (C would be lux¬ urious, if like him he could afford lux¬ uries ; every man would'.-like him bea libertine, if he had the same exquisite perceptions of pleasure/' Of what re¬ mained to hini, he appeared sufiicientiy jealous; lie dressed himself with the most expensive elegance, and covered his table with such delicacies as 1 had never before beheld^ and of which in the intervals of pain he pariook with a voracity that often renewed it in the very act : this, however. instead of checking him only suggested curses against his cook or his wiue-mei chant, to whose defects and adultéraient he charged Ы1 he suffered, and ihoì hastened to prepare himself by medicine for auoihtrr repetition of indulgence and pain. But p ai n w us not the only im¬ pediment to his indulgences: Miss' P never lost an opportunity of admonitkm and reproof, which these seasons afto-det!
her; and though she performed every little office about him with a minuteness of attention, which surprised me a* much as the freedom she was allowed in her severity, yet she indemnified herself for the trouble by incessant declamation against the mischief of luxury, and the meanness of appetite. All dinner-time was passed in alter¬ cation, to which Sybilla listened si¬ lently from fear, aud I from amazement. The scene too was sufficiently strange; my Other seated iu his velvet chair, enveloped in his pelisse, and surrounded by French servants, who had scarce tim« to carry back and forwards the variety of things he tasted and dismissed; and to answer with shrugs the (C diable'* and " peste" with which they were greeted at every step. Ьп tbe other side, Miss P. in an attir tude that could neither be called sitting nor leaning; her plate the furthest thing
from her at the table, reading intently» and every morsel she swallowed, lament¬ ing the suspension of intellectual opera¬ tion. (e If you can cut that chicken pie/' said my father, (f send me some of it. I would have it brought to me; but this étourdi bete would derange all the liqueur/* ťf If the human mind were in the ex¬ ercise of its full powers, your wish would bring the pie to you, as easily as it would brina: the chicken to your mouih, were it on your plate. But how long shall we be condemned to regret the pro- dominance of matter over mind?"— c< We have no reason to regret the pre¬ dominance of matter in your discourses. But what the devil are you using the handle of the fork for instead of the prongs?"—" Why/' said Miss P. Ci do the Chinese use neither knife nor fork ? Why do the Abyssinians use a knife with their lingers? Why**— if Ohi curves. u 6
and confusion/* said my father, Ci ' now for an hour of declamation, and the pie will be cold; who but you ever thought of reasoning at a dinner-table; is reason necessary to handle a knife and fork, or to move the jaws ?'* ťť Undoubtedly it is,*' replied the lady, ' it is our privilege to reason on every part of life. Does not reason assist me to refute your complaints, does not rea¬ son dictate my replies?"— iC No, upon my soul, it does not/' said my father, relieving his pain by a sneer. " It is im¬ possible, 0 he continued, filling his mouth, '* this cando me good, while, like Pistol in the play, I am compelled to ( eat and swear' at every mouthful."— (( Anger/' said Miss P. rs as it contributes to fer¬ ment the animal juices, may probably contribute to trituration and digestion/* —* f By Heaven, you talk of man as if he were a machine/'— <( 'Tis you who rather wish to consider woman as a ma-
chine."— <r So I do/' said my father with bitterness, (C a machine o£ fonane," ~— i( We have always differed in our sen- rations of pain, because we differ in our ideas of it. But if I am allowed to de¬ fine" ------ <c Excuse me, I beg; if lam spared the definition of pain, I shall pro¬ bably escape the sensation.'* (i It is impossible to reason with you. The woman who could communicate with your ideas, must be utterly destitute of any herself; she must be a domestic drudge, broken by the slavery of com¬ mon life, and the misfortune of a reli¬ gious education/'— " Religious educa* tion," said my father, arguing from his own ideas, (( is no misfortune on earth to a woman. Some of the finest women ï ever knew in France were immensely religious, and were just as punctual at mass as at their assignations/' Here the arrival of the second course presenting a pair of ducks a la гошш, engaged his
whole attention ; and Miss P. read andT reasoned seule fór the remainder of the meal, which the dessert, and a variety of liqueurs and wines, protracted for nearly three hours. When this business was at length con¬ cluded, my father would willingly have tried to sleep ; but it was necessary for him then to attempt to take some exer¬ cise. He had been desired to qualify the indulgences of the table, by taking a fbw turns in the garden after it. This was a terrible moment to him; he looked wistfully around, drained his last glass; sighed heavily, and rose from hi^ chair; The garden, which sloped to the brink of the river, sheltered aid shaoeò by the houghs of every light and water-loving tree, was a spot to tempt the wanderings of a voluptuary; but my father had now no sense but that of taste; the pure air chilled him, and the*rich, soft colourings of the sky and earth were tinged by ti*e
complexion of his mind. His feelings were very peculiar. The strength of youth and spirit was necessary to support his existence; yet youth and spirit of¬ fended him, for he was still jealous of his personal advantages, which had once been eminent ; and he believed youth and animation were only displayed to insult him. I had hastened forward to offer him my arm, (when he attempted to walk) but he rejected it after an angry comparison between his nature and mine. He then leaned on* Masseau for a few moments ; but finding my steps firmer than those of his old domestic, returned to me again; hut told me there was no occasion that I should stoop to him in that invidious manner, I wished to suspend his uneasiness and my own, and poured out my praise on the objects that were around us, delight¬ ful as they were to the eye of novelty, and the mind of youth, with all the
lavislmess of natural pleasure; He checked me with impatience. fi I can¬ not endure to hear you. If it were so, why does it not strike my feelings as it does yours ? Γ will not believe that others can feel pleasure where I feel only weariness and disgust* 'Tis the language of a schoolboy, a language you must unlearn, as you have learned it. I talked it once myself as fluently as you ; but even when I talked, I did not believe it. These things are purely me¬ chanical ; as long as the senses minister to tbe mind, the mind must depend on their ministry. iC Eschylus got drunk to compose his tragedies. The Venus of Apelles was said to have fed upon roses. Another worthy of antiquity was said to be ' ebrius nectare/ I try to talk the language of a schoolboy on your ac¬ count; but I will now talk the language of ζ moralist, To evcfcy шап whose ap~
petite is good, and rest undisturbed ; whose enjoyment of life is never dimi¬ nished by sleeplessness or indigestion, the sky is for ever tinged with blue, and the whole system of things is unexception¬ able. This is the true Claude Lorraine- lint of life. Burgundy gives its own blush to every object you see through it. The great secret of happiness is the combination of youth and pleasure with health ; and when the former and latter have departed, (as they must) try stilt to retain the middle one. Our very vir¬ tues are only another name for the effects of a good meal on a good frame of health, under the influence of an exhila¬ rating atmosphere. * Vf his is the whole of it ; it sickens me to hear of sensibility and affection, natu¬ ral or artificial, &c. &c.—Who ever was benevolent amid the rage of hunger? Try if you could listen to the most af¬ fecting tale of calamities under the ri-
gours of a polar night. Ask· a man ш the paroxysms of gout to shed a tear for any one's distresses but his own. Ask a benighted traveller to pause over the sad¬ ness of a sentiment amid the rage of a storm. All our sensibility is the bastard offspring of pride and indolence. Re¬ posing on our couches to satiety^ we wish to diversify our sensations by arti¬ ficial uneasiness, and therefore pretend to feel for visionary sufferings, ' ς Bitt real pain soon cures ns of our affectation ; and real pleasure ( if we could know what it 'û } ) would perhaps cure us of pretensions to imaginary ones. You pretended a few minutes ago to dislike the wine I pressed you to take : and now you pretend to luxuriate iu what you call c the rich and weeping softness of a watery landscape/ This is all nonsense and self-imposture. Champagne (when it is good, I mean) has always the same power of stimulating the spirits, though.
trees and water have not, for they have lost their power of stimulating mine long ago. And it is to be hoped when you come to my years, that is, I mean to my ------pshaw !'—experience—you will look upon nature with the same disgust that I do," This was spoken at intervals; but with an emphasis and deliberation that shocked and distressed me. Γ tried to soothe him, however, for I hoped his words had been extorted by the acrimony of pain. I admitted that much indul¬ gence must be allowed to one who suf¬ fered so much, and that the spirits of an invalid required the resources of even artificial enjoyment. i( I have none others left me/ 1 said he with violence, and panting with the burden of intem¬ perance ; r( if all the pleasures of man were those of temperance and exercise, what would become of me ? (e I hardly keep on the level of exist** ence with all the aids that indulgence can.
give me. The best cook I could procure for enormous wages to come with ma tor this cursed country, can hardly excite my appetite. Along with my coffee I regularly drink the most potent liqueurs I can swallow ; yet my digestion and sleep are still disturbed. What would become of me if I were to be temperate? I who have an imposthume in my hcad^ an obstructed respiration, an abscess iu my side, and—hell in my heart." I listened with horror and compassion. I was softened or terrified even to tears. île observed it, but observed it only with scorn. 4f You may abate your consterna¬ tion/' said he; i( you mean by that word, something, that the nurse and the priest have taught; I mean only some¬ thing that my sufierings in this world have taught me, and which 1 shall pro¬ bably forget as soon as I q n it it. I have long been assured there was no other heaven than a quiet rest after a good
dinner; and no other hell than the priva¬ tion of enjoyment, without the privation of desire." Ï was now shocked to a de¬ gree that impelled me to change the sub¬ ject; and I spoke eagerly of my uncle and of the neighbourhood, of which however I knew nothing. (£ I wanted to talk to you of your uncle/' said he, vf and you compelled me to speak of my own feelings, <ς Your uncle is my elder brother, though not of the same name ; for I changed mine for the property of a ma¬ ternal uncle which ï inherit. Your un¬ cle is a Milesian, and like all Milesians, proud and dull ; hut unlike most Mile¬ sians, amazingly rich. u He has no children, he is old, much older than I am. I!e has a nephew who resides with him; but he is our sisters son, and thanks to vour uncle's Milesian prejudice in favor of male descent, he will probably prefer you, as his bro-
«flier's child, to any other competitor for bis favor. Observe me, Örmsby ; were you independent, I would consider him and his favor as an object for you to quiz and ridicule; but you have nothing. Let not the appearance I make deceive you. I have sunk the whole of my pro¬ perty for an annuity; the house in which I ìive will, and every inch of ground about it, be alienated at my death. My age—not my age, I mean, but my infirmities, require much indulgence; I considered that, and considered I had the best right to indulgence from myself. I can hardly afford myself Burgundy as it is; tliis cursed war with France has deranged the whole business of life. I could drink Champaigne ten years ago for the price I give for vin de grave now. You see therefore it is necessary I should make some sacrifice. Expect nothing from me; hut if you manage well, expect every thing from your uncle/'
I was trying to comprehend his mean¬ ing; I was trying to Gönceivé ihat a parent could nurse ^a child in luxury, whom he meant to expose to indigence, when a tumult of voices, in which Sybilla's was predominant, recalled us to the dining-room, whose windows descending to the ground, communi¬ cated with tbe garden. Sybilla was contending with Miss Percival with a vehemence of which I hardly thought her capable. ic This is a species of op¬ pression to which I will not submit, ma¬ dam/* said she ; (t I insist upon having at least an hour to myself in the evening, and that hour I will devote to the study of the Scriptures. At the school where I have lived happily many years, it was the habit of my life,* it has now, from an habit, become a duty ; but neither as an habit nor duty shall it be suspended. You may deride me ; but insensibility to unjust censure, is one of the first les- 3
sons of that book you would take from me/' — <e If you had been satisfied with calling the study of that work an habit, and reasoned for its propriety from the force of habit merely, I could not op¬ pose you. We all admit the force of habit. One of our first and greatest writers* maintains, that habit may hold so strong an influence over an old woman living with a band of robbers, and ac¬ customed to their atrocities, that any attempt to shake her conviction of the rectitude of her mode of life, would be as ineffectual as to eradicate the belief of revelation from a mind hardened in its belief by age and habit. He intimates, indeed, that the errors of both are equal¬ ly absurd; and the habits of mind in both merely mechanical." lr Nar willl,'* said-Sybilla, more in- teat on her own vexations, than Miss
P /s reasoning; f ' nor will I,° said she, pushing away her drawing dedí, íh be made to study those odious nude figures you bring me; nakedness is what I never wished to contemplate in шу own person, or any one else's." "You show a most alarming impurity of mind,"" said Miss P~-----; ζί our shame of naked¬ ness is merely a shame of our own ideas; drapery is only an apology for that want of modesty, wbich the mind in its present bUtc, while clothes are permuted, must ever want; wore the soul in a pure and perfect state of abstraction, it would be utteily unconscious, not oni ν of naked- ne>v, but of the existence of a hod> aí all,—The more we approach to th-s state, the fuiihcr we remove from shame : read the writings of the modern philosophers and you will be convinced they have ле\у iitíie either of shame or fear," ς ïf vo ä wi'l permit her," said my father, n ho never lost an oppoitunity of sneer x OL. 1. X
ing at the Bible,, χζ to study that old Jewish Fabulist she is so fond of, she will be reconciled by the discovery her first parents were naked and not asham¬ ed." " God bless me/* said Sybilla in serious distress—she collected herself and addressed my father almost with dignity. * r Believe me, sir, if you respect your own authority, you will not weaken its only permanent support. The books that Miss P. and you sanction, are such as would justify me in rejecting a controul from which I derive little beside pain, were I not withheld by the authority of that book, which allow ing no compromise for disobedience, commands children to obey their parents in all things, which draws no sanction from the mutable mo¬ tives of the human will ; but tells us, it is good and acceptable in the eyes of the Lord.** My father rung for his drops— I had been silent, but 1 could be so no longer,
I took Sybilla's band—" If you, sir, can see this with indifference, I cannot ; I have been taught to respect modesty, and to reverence religion. Pardon me if I say, I see little temptation to re¬ linquish my opinions, from the exam¬ ples of those who oppose them ; I claim impunity for my sister and myself while we live with you. The alterna¬ tive would be much easier to me than to hear the Being whom I worship— defied ; and the sex whom I honor, and the only being of that sex whom I love, insulted or contaminated." ín the flush of speaking, I drew Sybilla from the room—we found ourselves in the garden before we knew we had quitted it, This burst of passion must be forgiven me. í was eminently ignorant of life, and of the mode of palliating the passions of others or my own.

while uttering it. Miss P., however, was too philosophic, to retain the me¬ mory of what had passed the night be¬ fore, and my father was soothed into good-humour by a night of tranquillity* My uncle and his castle deserve a chap¬ ter to themselves.
CHAPTER V. In the morning Capt. Delorainc (the other nephew of whom my father spoke) came from the Castle to wait on me be¬ fore my appearance there ; this attention from a man so much my senior, for D· was seven or eight and twenty, flattered my boyish vanity. It was not without some degree of confusion, I met a man whom I had been instructed to supplant; but the sight of Dt lor aine was enough to banish all confusion. There was a bold and chearful openness, a candour both natural and professional about him, which won all eyes and minds that encoun¬ tered. His person and air were military, his face was that of a man, who thought more than D. seemed to think ; but I re- i 4
signed my pretensions to physiognomy, sooner than admit any defect in the cha¬ racter I had imagined of him. My fa¬ ther set out for the Castle in the chariot, accompanied bySvbilla; Delorainc and í rode; Miss P. declined ¿»oing. ï was delighted with my companion; his infor¬ mation was trivial, but he communicated it with a vivacity that enchanted a boy. Cí T hoc great houses vou see to the left," said he, <c have every reason to look desolate, thev are the property of absentees. Lord Westh amp tou and Lord Roschamp draw large revenues from their Irish estates, which the former never visits, and the latter only to rack his overracked tenants to their uttermost fari hing. île is a famous fellow how¬ ever, and gives amazing good dinners and keeps the whole country in an no¬ tour while he stays. M v uncle does not visit him, as he has unluckily discovered that his lordship's great uncle was mar-

hood has its spectres, living or dead : perhaps, if you could see the inmate of that maüsioH, you would hardly know which to pronounce him. He is a man who lives alone, some say, in consequence of his crimes ; some say, in consequence of his misfortunes : as for me, I know so little of solitude, it is impossible for me to pronounce what could determine any man to chuse it. I believe I have bored you enough in my office of Diable Boi" Veux ; but we are now witbin sight of the castle, and I cannot lay it down with¬ out one caution. Your uncle has all the peculiarities of a Milesian, and one that no Milesian but himself ever had. He f cannot bear assent. To be · obligingly fiat/ is to disoblige him fov ever. He loves to hear English manners and mo¬ dern habits defended, that he may have the pleasure of refuting them. He is only to be pleased by contradiction; but, remember, if you assign me as the au-

I had seen nothing yet of the peculiar and national features of the Irish, I soon dis¬ covered the reason. The Irish are easily repelled by strangers. About my other's house, the fame of whose French house¬ hold had travelled round tiu country, not an Irish face was to Ъг seen; every thing about the Chieftain's cashe bore the aspect I looked for. The people were as sallow, and meagre, and ill-dad, as any where else ; but then e was aj expres¬ sion of animated cordiality, a warmth of heart that ill umiliate I the face of the iti

Wc ascended the great stairs ; at the upper-end of a dark, spacious, ill-fur¬ nished room, the Chieftain was seated iu an huge chair of wicker, from w hieb no man who wished for a picture of anti¬ quity would have bid him rise; my fa¬ ther, who was there alreadv, introduced me. ' f You are welcome/' said he, and his voice made mc feet ï was. 1 never beheld hoary grandeur more aw ful ; I feel some reluctance in attempting to de- 4'ii^e tins noble old ruin : the Irish cha¬ racter h а л been much exaggerated. They who ^p".ik of a Milesian chief, describe him a being, obsolete as Brien il lirs., or l· intrai ; a< a. beinsr. w ho talks the hiugna^c of О -sian, aiui wear^ the robes of a bard, 1 cannot overste]) the mode.-ty of nature iu my de-cription, for 1 havo ЧЧЧ1 and known the man 4 »hum 1 dcHľi';j. He was a man, whose
strong and characteristic peculiarities were partly softened by age, and partly shaded by tbe influence of the manners of the day; an influence which he would never acknowledge. He was seventy-six years of age, but he was as upright as the towers of his own castle, and his intellects were as vigorous as his frame ; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated ; his hair, whicli flowed loose and wild, was as white as fnow ; his dress was tbe English habit of fifty years ago ; but he always wore a cloak of the brightest scarlet, whose folds he grasped and waved, when he spoke with animation. His demeanour was marked with dignity, but it was a wild and original dignity ; that of a chief of a warlike country, lofty with unborrowed grandeur and habitual com¬ mand ; amid the polished forms of mo¬ dern life, he looked t lie oak, amid the poplar and the willow. 2
At dinner, my admiration was with¬ drawn from his person to his conversa¬ tion. It appeared, he had passed much of his youth abroad ; he spoke French, Italian, Spanish ; he was acquainted with their literature and their politics; he spoke of them with toleration, but of Ireland with enthusiasm. Such a man gives to a listener the same pleasure, that a traveller would receive from visiting a building, whose sombrous antiquity pro¬ mised nothing but gloom and decay ; but who, on entering it, would find all splen¬ did with illumination, and luxurious with elegance ; yet, all modulated by the gracious melancholy, and tinged with the hoary complexion of the original structure. Without a wish to excite him by opposition, when the dessert appeared, I could not avoid wondering, that a man who had drank of the rich fruitage of France, could accustom himself to the cold productions of his own climate.

Tbe dinner, though as ;»;*md as Ш у fa- the** could wish, луря marled by circum¬ stances e^ciťmtly characteristic. When the turfbas'.et, which always stands on the hear!!;, required to be filled, a bare¬ footed boy rame inf о the room, who did not np| ear from bis embarrassment, < ( to have never befores^i.-l in such a presence.'* The whole of dinner-time, the Chief¬ tain was accosted by persons who en¬ tered and departed abruptly; and who by their action (for the ccr.versation was in lri -Ф) appeared to speak of business, and v, b'mi he answered, as if the inter¬ ruption was a common one ; almost as soon as dinner was over, the Chieftain
beckoned to his confessor, a venerable and decent priest, whose paie face was tinged with something more than reli¬ gious melancholv, and they withdrew together, evidently for the purposes of devotion, the Chieftain making a slight apology for his absence, at which my father was not angry, as Delorainc was appointed to supply his place, imd my father loved to be pressed to drink. As my uncle and the priest quitted the room, I thought they appeared to paibc before tlie picture of a young and beautiful female, which was over the chimney- piece ; 1 thought I s^w my uncle's eve alibten with something more than grief — the prie»! crossed himself, and lus hps moved—neither of them spoke a word ; when thev were cone, Τ learnt a irreat part of the Chieftain's historv from my father's biteers, and Heloraiue's coni- in e ι »Is. lie w a« a sou of a younger branch of
the old Milesian farnih of De Lacy; his father was indigent, and his prospect of succession was as remote as an host of intermediate heirs could make it ; under these circumstances he determined to enter into forcirn service—it was the custom of the day. During his preparations for this step, his maternal uncle, a man of large property old and childless, offered him his estate on condition of his assuming the name of Bethel ; the Milesian rejected the wealth and the condition with contempt ; the offer was successively made to his three younger brothers, all but the youngest (my fathci) rejected it. The Chkftaia went abroad with his brothers, to earn wealth* and distinction bv their swords ; my father plunged Into sudden af¬ fluence became the most luxurious and dissipated man o* the age. The brothers met abroad., buí the De Lacys would not own their relationship, and my father's pleasures were such as did not require
the auxiliaries of domestic affection. When my uncle had seen his brothers perish in the service, in which he had wasted his youth and his blood without reward, he began to think that poverty would be more tolerable in a country he loved, than abroad. He determined to spend tbe remainder of his life under the shadow of the wails of his kindred's castle, which he was always accustomed to call, the house of his fathers, Perhaps his resolution received force from a cause of all others most likely to give force to habits of strenuous melan* choly. He was said lobe desperately ab tached to a French lady of distinguished rank and beauty, who loved him, and had owned her love, but felt his poverty was an hopeless obstruction to their happi¬ ness. He found consolation in the society of a young benedictine, an Irishman, whose superior was confessor in the lady's family ; this young man avowed to tuo
ferred till they were forgotten. He was said sometimes to sooth his grief by speaking to his confessor of the object of their disastrous love, but this could only be conjectured, for her name was never heard to pass his lips. He was often reproached with neg¬ lecting the great advantages by which he was distinguished, and perhaps he some¬ times reproached himself for it ; but we are accustomed to contrive some pal¬ liation for habitual failings, and the Chieftain compounded between the shame of his indolence and his respect for the habits of his ancestors. Whatever was noticed in the circumstances around bim as defective, or requiring alteration, his frequent answer was, <f It is the custom of my r fathers/' I extorted thisnarrative by repeated ques¬ tions ; those who informed me wondered at theemotion lexpressed. I knownot whether those who read it will feel with me or them.
4s it was concluded, the Chieftain and his confessor r**:urned. r i heir face- \ J a glow su 0 h as human benevolence οι t t ι- ?ure uever vet gav* : the С lue f4 *Ф'р v ^s fumer, and his v ?ce, without bei ? elevated, had a rich « v d solemn depth t { ' sound, ae if he had ju * descended from high conference. He had reen in prayer ; the prayer of a broken and nitrite heart, and a portion of its soft and Чети spirit rested on him still. 1 looked ui this dis* tinguished old man with inci^ased love and awe every moment ; I could not for my soul practise Deloraine's plan of contradiction. There w r as enough without anv effort írom me: my father, pi o v ok' d at being summoned to coffee too 0O0 ь peevishly dwelt on every subject of provocation. He talked of the dilapidated state of the castle. fr It will last ionii' « »·οιΐί> h to shelter the last of the De Laevs," said the * Chieftain ; (i it may crumble over my

My fathei spoke of the neglected appearance о Г the grounds about the castle, and the impolicy of indulging the tenants among whom he lived with such tow rents ; <f a practice,*' said he, " of which the mis¬ chief h obvious ; for those who «utve little to pav, find the temptatie ι to indolence so strong, that they neglect ťm\v farms and lb ir landlords eqiuUv, while your te», ints iu the south, who hold much wor^ ground at an hL her rent, pay that rent punctually, beeaibc the> are eveitť'J to diligence b\ the pressure." **' Let mv ».ucce^N'T raise hi- rents," said the Chief¬ tain.

declamation that silenced the " puny bifile," of his assailant in a moment. It was full of strong and peculiar phrases, many of them harsh to an ЕчцН^Ь ear, ami foreign to the idiom of the language ; he was evidently thinking iu Irish, though lie spoke in English. He concluded by saving, i£ Is if for those who have de¬ solated the country, and razed every mark of power or of resis! anco from the fave of it, to demand where is tJm proof of power, or of resistance, aud afi er healing down with tlui savageness of conquerors·, die monuments of our strength and great¬ ness, to ask with the insolerne of con¬ querors, what monuments of strength and greatness are left to us ?" fi How is it then," said my father, when he recovered his breath, ťí that the Romans can still shew monuments of tonner greatness, surviving amid a coun¬ try that was desolated by Goths/" r Because the monuments of recent vol. i. к
greatness are more easily preserved than those of remote; the stiucturesof Irish greatness were perhaps falling into ruh>$ before those of Roman were erected. The great спешу to the existence of our ancient monuments ivas Christianity; St. Patrick and his followers demolished the heathen temples, and—----but 1 beg your pardon Lionel (for he never would call him Bethel) ï speak only to Irish- *ДК'1\ I de-ire to mnkc no conv cits.

We condole with the fashionable world, en the total eclipse of its most brilliant luminary/* &c. &c. There was a vast deal more which my father in his joy had not patience to read* " Thank heaven/ 1 said he, C( I shall have some society iu this savage place. Lord Wcsthamptoib or whatever he is now, gives the best dinners in the world. I knew him and Lady W. intimately abroad. They are the most charming people in the world. But they are cursedly mistaken if they imagine Lady \Y. will bury herself in J rehuid , unless she has lost her beauty, and then she could not do a better thing, evcept shoot¬ ing herself But she is too exquisite a mistres of the art of beauty to lose it by »«•е. She was the finest creature Д ever о beheld, Um> and t w ent) years ago, when wc met aí Naples. The design was English, but the colouring and manner, Hìid finish, perfectly foreign.
' r The worst of Lad y W. was an incessant and unmitigated blaze of attractions that gave no mercy or respite, She was fof rver on the full stretch, and kept all her listeners and beholders so. She would beat every one on their own ground. In Paris she was the first coquet ; in Italy the first cognoscenti ; in London the first politician in the female world. She was always in opposition, and gave a devilish deal of trouble to the ministry, till she succeeded in marrying one of her daugh¬ ters to the premier Lord Castle Wyconib, and then she was satisfied. But with all her wit and beauty and grandeur, (and I am t ohi they are improving every year since I knew her) she always appeared to me to be unhappy. There was always a kind of force and feverish irritation in her display of talents and attractions. Her manners bad alwavs something idarine and artificial like her rouge and fard. What the devil could make her unhappy,
I never could imagine, for she had more vanity aud admiration, than three-fourths ¡j ·* of her sex beside/* Tbe character struck mc, carelessly and coarsely as it was sketched ; there was something in it, at which my imagination kindled. cc Perhaps," said Í, (f she might have desired something more than the pleasures of vanity and admiration; per* haps she was. not happy in her family/' i( I imagine/' said he, ic she was a? happy as a woman of rank could expect. She had an immense family, about w hoi» she managed so well, that the sons are all in very brilliant lines, and the daughters got off so young, that there could be no compot it ion between them. ÎSIone oí th< nr, that I heard of, indeed could coa¬ tend with her; they were mere fashion¬ able expletives; but she continued to find places for them famously, As to Lord W. he never could have given her the least disturbance. 1 don't think I
'ver saw them together for three years I was abroad with them. If they travel to the family mansion in the family coach, it will probably be the first hour they have passed together since their mar¬ riage." 1 was looking over ihe paragraphs while he was speaking; they occu¬ pied a whole column with conjectures whether the furniture was io be sold or removed to Ireland, and whether the lady's diamond? were to pav the ùi~ mily debts, or the gaming debi* ; and whether the jointure was to be given up, er the eldest son's splendid allowance di¬ minished: and whether his lordship's magnificent set of plate, with the herald's coat and family crest and supporters, and foliage, &e. &c. was to be sent back to Ihe jewellers; or her ladyship's last new barouche, elegantly finished, in the first style, by the first artist—the painting and varnish by —, the mouldings by — ; tho к 4
border picked in with the livery «о1оиг5. and the harness embellished after a new Parisian pattern, was to be sent to the coach-makers in place of his bill, &c. &c. &e. All this, with a thousand com¬ ments and conjectures, and regrets and flourish's, and hints at the iniquitous share Lord W. had taken in a late trans¬ action, and compassion for the lady whom the public voice universally ac¬ quitted ; all this proved, that few sub¬ jects had so much occupied the fash ion- able world, nay. even the public feelings and curiosity, as this extraordinary af¬ fair. 1 observed to my father, that the papers were sufficiently liberal of their censures on Lord W. for his usurpation of the hofiOrs that had been wrested from him. They appeared to hint too, that his treatment of the person whom he has contrived to exclude from his possessions so long, had been eminently cruel and treacherous. He was silent.
I ventured to add, that the society of a man of such principles could hardly be regarded as an acquisition. i£ Princi¬ ples/* said my father, "what the devil have I to do with the principles of a man who gives such dinaer* as Lord W.? I wish half tbe nobility had such princi¬ ples—of taste—Hut what day is this? 1 ' said he, looking at the date of his pa¬ pers. (C Morbleu, Sunday—»Masseau* give me double my dose of laudanum.

church— the church was iu ruins; but one oi lhe servants said he believed that service was performed in the hall of Lord Roschamp's house, during his lordship's absence, as the housekeeper happened to be a Protestant. I rode there. Delo¬ rainc had shewed me the direction in which the house lay. A servant followed me with a request from my father, (who had awoke) to bring home to dinner any one I coukl meet with. I have no desire to represent myself as— ťť righteous over much/' and a youth of sixteen, going on a pilgrim¬ age in quest of a church, may savour too much of spiritual errantry. But I had a strong sense of religion. My beiief in revelation was firm, it has always been firm; and revelation points cut the necessity of combining habits with feeling; and the expedieuey of pub¬ lic and prescriptive exercises of devotion too strongly to be mistaken, except by thvsc who w idi tu mistake it f
I will not denv that the force of these h/ iVelings was increased by the force of opposition; and that my piety was never so prompt, when İt svas the habit of the family with whom I lived to frequent church three times a day. At a little distance from Roschamp- House, I saw a young man riding eager- lv in the same direction; it was Ham« mond, the friend of my child 1 '>od, the man whom, even in childhood, I had lived on as the friend of mature life. Our joy at meeting was equal; it was not dimmi/ned by the occasion of it. We were both going to the same place. We were the only members of our fami¬ lies who went there. Hammond was altered in nothing but his appearance. He was the same steady, sedate charac¬ ter, of inflexible мои!, and strenuous virtue. His character was so exactly the reverse of my own, that he was the very man of ten thousand who should & 6
have been my friend, He went to church early, that he might request the clergy¬ man to attend a sick servant at Ham- mondVGrove. (t She is surrounded,'* said he, (< by Catholics, who are tor¬ menting her to send tor a priest ; and if I did not execute this commission myself, I know no one iu the house to whom it could be entrusted/' We entered the hall, which was filled with all the Protestant population in the neighbourhood, about forty persons, I knew how service was usually performed in country churches; the reci or of the parish was absent, and I expected from the curate, what may he expected from a man who amid obscurity and indigence has sullied and lost whatever he possessed in early life of the habits of a e-entkman and a scholar. The service wae per¬ formed by a man who gave me new ideas of religion and its ministers for ever. Let me indulge in speaking a few words 3
of this man, whose agency in my narra¬ tive may justify the digression. His name was Corbett. He had been a corate six and forty years. He sought not to be any thing else. The religion he possessed bad taught him, iC having food ¡md raiment, to be therewith content/' and the same influence extending to his habits, had enabled him by temperance and prudence, to obtain all he thought necessary in life. He was married, and had a son whom he him.self had edu¬ cated ; aud who, like himself, was in the n.inistry. When I speak of the eíľeels of his mode of prayers and preaching, I speak of the effects ï witnessed 'm the course of a constant attendance ou him. He never read prayers; he prayed, and with such deep and fervent feeling, with emphasis so obviously suggested, not by the art, but by the nature of supplica¬ tion; with pauses «o strongly marked by solemnity of recollection, and a sus¬ pension of he act, without a suspension
of the feeling, that his congregation almost unconsciously joined in tbe re¬ sponses, which were originally intended for their utterance, and felt the force of habit and of indolence yield to the holy energy with which he poured out his petitions. I never heard man preach as he did. He was a scholar, to whom few I have- ever met were superior. He was a man delighting in conversation, in which, if light, he could amuse, and if argumen¬ tative, he coukl instruct, more than any man í ever listend to. But in the pul¬ pit, he laid aside the wisdom of words and the weapons of fleshly warfare alto¬ gether. That he was a scholar you felt not; vou felt not thr-t he was a man of rich imagination, or of strong reasoning powers; you felt not that he or his dis¬ course could be referred to any class of mind or composition that could assist you to judge of them in a temporal ьепье. But you felt irresistibly that Ъм
vur; a believer, pleading with the power ι»Γ ctnnictiou; that he was a religionist, speaking from experience, commending a life he ii\ed, and a felicity he felt; that he spoke and acted on principles which, though bevond the range of existence, vere lud bevond the range of reality; principles which he made present and \i\id, anu substantial alike by the force oi' eloquence, and the force of example. lie was а speaker, who, of aH others I cm % heard, succeeded mo^t in a\ erting unu" attention from himself to his sub¬ ject. İt was long after his sermons had concluded, that uni eouîd thiiìk of the preacher, like the priesl in the Jewish hiërarch) —he disappeared in the cloud of incense hiiibelť solí up. The Christianit) heprrached, wasbuch яч a man would preteli, who, abstract¬ ed from the influem e of pre, udite and habit and self-wisdom, had sought his ejbtcm iu re\elation alone, aud ίοαηά and
formed it there. It was reither a frame of doctrinal niceties, curiouslv construct ed, and totally iwft for n ,e ; nor a for¬ mulary of habitual observances, at which the constant attendance of the body may excuse the aVem с of the mind. It wa·· a system, of which tbe principle* were operative, iu which op^inion held iti due relation to practice; Christianity was described аъ a dispensation exhibiting certain facts to tbo belief; and the be¬ lief, if subdued bv these fact*, siunrcst- ing the шо -t important and active conse¬ quences to our mintU and our lives, it mav be thought there was something' in this mode of reproe nfa'ion too argu¬ mentative and consequent ia İ for the com¬ prehension of a ru-iic audience—it was not ч>. Though hi·» po^vfions were Pionii «L У А Л aud important, thev were ebi hed io a language, whose peculiar a*id providen¬ tial felicity is, that it is tbe uuivcn.i! language^ the fh&t language that rc.iglou.
talks to the car of infancy, the language that genius reverences, and ignorance un¬ derstands, the language of the poet and of the saint, the language of divinity and of the heart, the language of the Scrip- fure*. He spoke as a father pleading with a wayward child; he spoke as a judge with a criminal, to confess and be forgiven; as a guide with a wanderer, to return and to rest. When he finished his sermon, it was not with Covvpers ť ' well-bred whisper/' lie appeared for some time engaged iu prayer ; au еИичоп of mind so solcum and dtcp, tbat most of the audience in¬ voluntarily joined in it; those who did not, were awed and silent. When be rame down, and walked among us though ihe thunder of Ьь eloquence was htudıed, hib countenance spoke still, lie had de¬ scended from the mount; but his vi- buge returned the brightness of that high
place. If I write of this man, I shah write volumes. When I could approach him, I introduced myself to him, solicit¬ ed his acquaintance, and praised his dis™ course in those broken and tremulou« sentences, which are all that wonder and reverence leave us breath for. He put by my praises with a courteou« humility, that declined the common traf¬ fic of commendation for vanity. I know not whether it will not sound like an in¬ terruption of this ir celestial colloquy/' that Mr. Corbett promised to dine st Lemon-Grove, and that I compelled him to accept mv horse, as he acknowledged the distance was remote for a iv.vä of his age on foot. I walked slow !y homewards, sui'* fried to believe it was to revolve Mr Corbett's sermon ; buí every though« presented Lady Mouti'evor—her situa tion so romantic, her beauty s-> re· pier* dent, buried in a wild country, and
so 'icar me. I calcuhded the very way her carriage would come, and gazed as if 1 expected to see it there. That she would com°, I "was determined to believe, in spite of my father's bneers ; for, hrr beauty and her errors, her splendour and her melancholy, the mixed and cloudy brightness of her character was hut too delightful to an imagination like mine. 1 was delighted at meeting almovt every moment cars and waggons, ?nd every implement for carrying furniture, and a train of splashed and weary servanti cursing tbe bog-roads in French and English; all indications of the progress of the great family, on (be road to Mon* írev or-í louse. I loitered looking at them till it was late, and the heavy cî'uids o î woning were deepened by a Morni. ï looked about me, I had mista¬ ken the road ; I saw no one near to direct n** 1 , but a dark figure that was mining rapidly at a distance. I hastened to him;
his appearance made me almost repent my haste. He was wrapt in a dark cloak ; he had a cap on his head of a strong and ancient fashion; his face was as pale as that of a corse, and two dark cyes 3 which though fixed on me, did not seem to see me, gave an expression to his face, that was almost supernatural. 1 addressed him in English, and inquired my way to Lemon-Grove. He was silent. I repeated my question in French, for there was something foreign in his air. He pointed to the lefty and hastily pursued another direction. Before I had proceeded far, the violence of the rain made me look round for shelter. I saw nothing near mehut the building which Delorainc had pointed out to me, as the haunted hoibo ; it was a single solitary tower at the extremity of a bridge I was crowing. AV ith some uiili- cultv I obtained admission, for the inhabi- taut was an old woman w ho oidy spoke
ïiish; its appearance within was as melan- ^ holy as without ; it seemed to have been uninhabited for many years, and then imperfectly repaired for the admission of ihe inhabitant. As I looked about mc, not svithout some mixture of uneasiness, I >aw the dark figure approaching, he catered, He started on seeing me, but did not speak, and darting up a winding flight of stone steps in an angle of the lower disappeared. I conceived at once this was the person whom Delorainc had described—the strange inhabitant of this strange mansion. The old woman went out for some turf to replenish the wretched fire. I was not easy in my situation, yet í was unwilling to go, for my curiosity was stronfici v excited. The feeling was not unmingled with fear, as a strange sound, low, but distinct, issued from the direction in which the stranger had disappeared, I listened intently ; it was a groan, deep and pro-
longed, it was scarce louder than respi¬ ration, it was no ciatneur of cominou grief, it was the inward cry of a wounded spirit. My breath grew short as I listened, it continued without intermission, but while I still wondered,, my wonder was changed into horror : my hands and neck were stained with drops of blood, fresh and warm, that fell slowly on them through the broken roof. I coukl remain no longer, I rushed out. There was no attempt made to detain me. When í reached my father's, the sight of a large and cheerful c i re le (for when my father wished to excite cheerfulness, none could resist him) almost banished the visionary com¬ plexion of my thoughts : bat I men¬ tioned the circumstances that had de¬ tained me. Mr. Corbett said that he believed the person I had met to be indeed a mysterious character, but it was a mystery whicli had nothing to alarm, ii
#nîy referred to himself; he was of the Catholic persuasion, he lived iu utter M>litude t he kue/.- no one, and no one even knew his name: but he was eminently (haritable, and in their mutual visits to the poor, they had often met, but never exchanged a syllable. Of a mau whose r. unís were so exemplary, he would not willingly believe the guilt, but he believed h i in ίο have been unfortuuatc, perhaps to the partial derangement of his reason. I iud almost trembled for the reception Mr. C. might meet at Lemon-grove, but I found my father disarmed by the sim- piìc h y of his maimers, that neither sought to declaim nor to dictate, and amused by the variety and intelligence of his conver¬ sation. Hammond too appeared more than amused by Sybilla, and I was suffered to think of Lady M. without interruption. In the morning there came an old gar¬ dener from Montrevor House in despair. When he could understand the direction!»
£'iven b ν the new servants who wcr¿ coming down in scores, for arranging the furniture, &c, &c, &e. he found that the hall and staircase, and gallery, were to be tilled with flowers, '** which the Blessed Virgin help me/' said the old man, (( J thought were to grow in gardens ; so 1 had packed them all with flowers as tight as a kish of turf, and the whole house looked as green as the top of my cabbin, when behold you, an unlucky gossoon gì a boy knocked a great orange tree, that stood up by the great staircase window, as tall and as straight as vour younn CD v' 4/ v master, and murdered it all to pieces, and murdered me too, for as my soul shall go to glory, I have not the fellow of it in the world, and there is the companion of it standing upon the other side as serious and as dismal as any Christian creature vou ever saw in your life that had lost iU friend and its gossip, and I moaning over them both, till I am almost killed/' My
father, who heard his moaning, determined to send one of his finest orange trees im¬ mediately to Montrevor House, and de¬ sired that the family should be ac¬ quainted on their arrival with the name of the donor, as he wished to renew his acquaintance with them under friendly auspices. The orange tree, in full produce, placed in a superb tub, was accordingly committed to the care of a servant, who en suite committed it to a carman to convey to Montrevor House. In a couple of hours the driver returned with visible marks of distress and confusions. The abridgment of his adventure w a?, that about a mile from Montrevor House, he had been overtaken by two persons on horseback, whom from their dress he touecived ш be grooms, but who turned out to be gentlemen from the bets they made, and the oath-» they swore. As thev x\une up with him on a full canter, ' Damme, Jack," said the iir»t, " I'll vol. I. i.
engage I'll nick the top orange of that tree with my whip as I pass it ; without pulling in." <( Done, damme, that you wont for five guineas." The foremost then rode up, but only nicked the leaves. He then offered to double the bet, and do it if the car was stationary ; this was accepted, and the cannai ordered to stop. He refused, a scuffle followed, till at length the gentleman, provoked at the fellow 'ь mistaking him for a servant of Lord Montre\or*s, and threatening to teli his nubier of him, offered to box the пьеаК for the car and orange tree and all. Tbe man, confident of his strength, readily agreed, and a very spirited set-to took place in the road, in which the carman had a decided advantage, till unluckily Steini» his hoi^e, who was tired of the frav, turning back with bis load to Lemon- grove, and quitting the engagement to ovei/ake him, he was judged by the gen¬ tlemen to have broken the rules, and for-
ieited the prize, which they compelled him to lead to Ro«champ House in iri¬ lim ph, where he learnt with some con¬ fusion that his assailants were Lord Rofechamp, and a sporting companion of bis. Sir John Ο ι berry, who were come down to keep up adust for about a week, among the savages of the west. Μ ν father was outrageous at this insult, of which the lev itv did not at all atone for the impertinence. 1 immediately sprung on horseback, and desiring a man to follow me to Roschamp House, with a car, í hurried there with resentment. Hi í le inferior to his. 1 was there in a lew minutes, I inquired for Loi d Roschamp, he was abroad, í hesitated a moment about the propriety of entering an house, in the absence of the master, till recol¬ let t İne; that be could easily find me at home, if he wished, 1 walked deliberately imo the bail, and desiring the man who was with me to take the orange tree, and L 2
replace it on his car, I waited till I saw him perform my directions without dis¬ turbance. As í was going out. a slight figure in a riding dress entered the hall; bis appearance was mean and diminutive, The man hesitated, I desired him to pro¬ ceed, <c Where are you going with that, mv fme fellow ?" said the figure. ŕŕ I am going to my master's, or wherever my ma-ter pleases to bid me," said the man, emboldened by his muster's presence Л ery fine, damme, very famous upon mv soul," said the baronet walking oif. That is Sir John/' said the man. Ile showed no w i¿h ίο speak to or detain mc, and as I did not desire to assume the ap¬ pearance of braving a man gratuitously. 1 walked out as deliberately as I had catered, and escorted the orange tree back to my fathers, for it was now too late to ¿end it to its fir*>t destination. W e were todine that day at Hammond > for шу father had drowned his horror« oí
Irish neighbourhood in their claret: but the dav that he passed at Hammond's, be did not recover for a week; it was a castle-rack- rent, an house of disorder and riot, where a bad dinner, vilely dressed, and attended by careless servants, was washed down by floods of wine, that were swallowed with the precipitation of men who were in haste to forget themselves. I lis miske s kd at the table,* some of his illegitimate children by his servants attended at it: the company were some vulgar and worth less wretches, who were permitted iu live there to excite laughter, and to swallow wine. The conversation was suru î<- noi even young Hammond coniti i'.i.ť a colouring of decency to, and ihe je->ts such as huifoons, or '.chüoibov- would substitute for wil, When my father drew out his handkerchief, he found a. lighted turf had been introduced into hi* socket, and when he bur4 away from UU
%3
tormentors, he was presented with his pelisse in the lining of which a Kve mouse was inserted, and an hat on which a dog had enjoyed very good repose and diges¬ tion. I was seriously incensed afe this buffoonery practised on a nvam delicate from habit, and irritable from Jill-health. I made him put on my coatj and heaping those of the servants about h ini to secure him from cold, I found l badi excluded myself from any room in the carriage ; I took an horse from one of the servants, and rode beside it. it was night, and as wc îspproacbed Montrevor Home, a vast M umber of mav ing lights, and a tumult of car¬ riages arum u need the arrival of the family. As we drew nearer, ï Joliid dis- tin^uUh two carriages and a <c(uiriot by the lamps before them, and eight out¬ riders. I thought of what orm of those carriages iniaht contain, and ¡stop t my borse at a little distance from the gates,
that I could see by torclblight were thrown open for their reception. The two fir^t carriages had entered, and the coachman was manœuvering tin* four horses to follow with the third, when a *ound, "but i could compare to nothing huma.\ suddenly an>«e from the other чсЬ of the road, and a number of person«, apparently intoxicated or frantic, sur¬ rounded the carriage with cries ae.il gestures of madness. Tlie spirited horses ihat drew it, reared andplueged with the utmost violence, scattering t!i j crowd iu all direeiion^. flìo coachman v. ¿s unable to manage then) ; the people who had terrified them, appeared terrified them-* selves, the carriage rollini?; backwards across the road, with ib wheels on the very verge of an hill. The ^creams t,f females from within were audible: at t!:i<" moment í sprung from my borse, and grasping the reins of the foremost hor^e, gave him a hudi with my wlu'p aerojá the L ±
nnck, that impelled him to make a forcible spring forward, and saved them from their perilous situation. But by this time the confusion was general. One of the outriders who was armed, gal lopped up, and seeing me hold therein?, presented a pistol at me; I called out to him to hold, but İt was too late. I felt the bullet as 1 -thought shatter m ν arm, 1 continued to grtsp the reins, and call to the coachman that all was safe as long as 1 was able ; but in a moment, from the effusion of blood, and the vehemence of my exertion, my strength failed, 1 fell and was carried ¡ns. usible to my father's carriage which ba'l turned back on the tumult. 1 was carried home, tiv. wound which was examined by tbe surgeon of a regi- meut, quai tered in Banaghcr, was merely a flesh-one; the ball had only grazed my arm, but the loss of blood was great, and my fever was hieb the next dav. Fait aiy pain was soothed by the most courtly
messages fro m Montrevor House, which were brought three times a day, during my confinement; accompanied the first by a note from his lordship full of regret, for my disaster, and praises of my courage.. åe. &c, to which the Miss Montolieu*, and their gouvernante, w ho were in tin* last carriage, probably owed their life, Ac. &(\ How the disaster happened, I could not imagine till one of the principal causes of it came to Lemon-grove, to pour out his lamentations over me ; it was the old gardener, i( and to be sure, honey/'said he, if if I had thought it was you tint were to be killed in this manner, I would have killed myself with my own banda ten times over first. But as we were ail tenants to this great new lord, and old followers to the family, though they never lived among us, why we ail loved him as we did our eyes, though we never set them upon his face till last night, So we thought it would be but right to ι 5
go out and give him a shout of joy, when he was coming to his own hous?, that he never was in before ; "and we all set out, and we were early enough to sec him, for the devil a bit of him was there, and so says I to them, there's no good at all in waiting to see а шап in the dark, and we are perished standing here in the bog, with nothing to warm us but. the rain and wind ; and so let. us step info Paddy Donnei Ian'is, that is within a step of the* gate, and take a drop of whiskey, and when we hear the carriage wheel, we'll all come out as fresh as daisies, and give him an Irish cry that he never heard from them English spalp ens in his life ; so we all went to Paddy DoımcUan's, and by my soul when we walked out, there was not one of us able to stand, so we all tumbled into the ditch, and began murdering each other, and Paddy fell upon me, and knocked my life out, which was very unkind of you Paddy, says I, when you
ånovT that your aunt was my nother's gossip, and when I took you out of the hands of your two brothers that were after murdering you hid Hi. Michael's dav at Bauagher-fair. So while we were all scrambling in the ditch for the honor and glory of lhe Moatrcvois, up ennie the carnages, and we all rolled out a^ bad as we could, and when we all began to shout, hell to ihe soul of us that could open our mouths, and my lord's servants knocked down borne of us, and the rest of us knocked down ourselves, and 1 ran aloni»· bv mv lord's carriage to the gate, and the coachman killing me all the way with the whip, and I begging pardon, and nobodv to hear me, ami still 1 ran on, and ixot пЫ to the house, to look in my¬ lord aud my !а:!уЧ faces, f> see if they were amrrv ; ami the first tlî4it came oní i took fir a young officer, for it was all in scarlet, but this was my lady ; the servant took her out iu his arms and ^he look- d L О
very pale all in the flambeau light, and I told her all about the whiskey and Paddy Dounellau, and begged her ladyship's pardon, and the blessed Virgaťs, for it was her night, and then the servants pushed us away ; and at las»f there came out a gentleman whom 1 took to be my lord, and he gave ns a power of money in her ladyidiip's own sweet name, and Uien we gave her a shout in earnest, that would have brought her from the other world, if we had murdered her. But may I never die in siu> if when I heard of you, and of that blundering rogue thai put a bullet Into your arm, ď Ì did not determine to go drown myself in the bog, and never come out of it again till 1 heard you were alive and well." The first day î was permitted, I rede to Montrevor-House, to return thanks for their inquiries, and to place the orange-tree, which was brought with me, ou the stair* caie. I thought I had sc*
cured myself against disappointment by not going till two o'clock, but at that hour not one of the family had quitted their apartments, but Ladv M/s femme. Onhearing my name, shedesiredthcgrooni of the chambers to remove the orange- tree to her lady's dressing room, as her kd>ship (who heard of it) desired it might be placed there. I care not who laughs at me, for acknowledging that their notice elated me beyond measure. A fortnight was now passed in visiting ; M the gentry of the neighbourhood erovvded the avenues to Monfrevor- House with their carriages, as it was universally understood, that Lord M. had retired merelv to concert plans for his return at leisure ; that one of these was to make himself of consequence, by getting his second son, Col. Montolieu, returned for the county; and for this purpose, he had determined to live in the iiiObt splendid hospitajity, that he might
ensure a good reception for his son, who was then abroad with an expedition. The countrv was full of reports, or rather conjecture^, about the family ; not one of the témales had ever been visible since their arrival, and his lorďdiip had been seen but rarely; but he was pro¬ nounced the most charming man in the world: all that a peer, and a courtier. and a senator coukl be, by those who had bad the good fortune to exchange a bon-jour with him. I was glad that Lady M. had vet been seen by none ; I would not w ill high have listened to such a description, as they who talked of her would have given. í should have heard of the pattiin of her travelling costume, or the lace of her morning d re·- s : ï did not wish the dreams whhh í 'ndulged of her, to be disturbed bv vulgar de* cap¬ tion. Among other visitors, mv fai her went, and we had the satisfaction of hearing that our equipage uua Hike 3
were less laughed at by his lordship4 servants, than any that had yet approach¬ ed Ыъ gates, Tbe visit was soon follow¬ ed by an invitation from Lord M„ iu which we understand bai ť tbe country was included. My father, who was a И riet observer of etiquette, was at first displeased that the invitation should first come from the stranger, but he pacified himself by reflecting, that his lordship's superior rank justified him in conferring ihe first com pl i ment, and he resolved togo, I v ill not interrupt this narrative with any reflexions on myself; I will not talk of the precipice on which f was tread¬ ing; I will merely describe what I saw, and leave what I felt to be imagined. I know not whether tbe derail of these things be interesting, yei if anv one can till his imagination with the idea of a magnificent family struck from their sphere, and rushing like a comet into remoteness and obscurity, but attended
by a train of splendour that marks theiï progress, and dignifies their departure : if he can fill his imagination with this, he will not wonder at the tumultuous and romantic admiration of a boy, to whom every thing was as delightful from its novelty as its splendour. We arrived at 3M—- House at a late hour ; it presented in every room the appearance of an house deserted for years, and then hastily filled with every thing that luxury could accumulate, without tiir.e to arrange. The hall was filled with shrubs and flowers, of which some in default of their china vases which had been broke on the way, were obliged to take up with the tun-tubs^ which were all the Irish ser¬ vants had to oifer for their accommoda¬ tion. On the staircase, colossal bronze figures extended their hands for lamps which they did uot hold, and a splendid tripod was placed in the window for w aut
of a chain, though a compartment in the cieiing had been opened for its reception. The rich carpeting intended for other stairs, was eked out on the corridor by an hearth-rug of the same pattern ; the rooms themselves di vested of their an¬ cient damask hangings, presented a chil¬ ling nakedness of wall, in spite of the splendid specimens of Egyptian costume that were spread on an uncovered couch in the drawing-room for inspection. Can¬ delabra without stands, and stands with¬ out candelabra ; gold fish in a vase over which my father was near falling at his entrance, as their station was occupied by a new-arrived cabinet of Egyptian antiquities in granite ; and a range of erotics blowing in water placed in the window-seats, as the vesseh that held them were too large fo/ th» irish chim- iKiy piece ; shades of \ л inted muslin in imitation of yothie e, e 0.41t?, placed be side windows whic¿ wi~ ίου large; and
couches and curíains divesied of their* canopies, whose gorgeous and gilded cornices were some feet higher than the eielmgj but which were displayed in a kind of regular and ostentatious confusion: s-uch was the costume of M — House. The room was full of company, who* looked around them and on each other with sufficient surprize, there was no¬ thing else to occupy them. Neither Lord nor Lady M. had appeared. At the up¬ per end of the room, almost hid among the clusters of Persian roses, sat t\so female figures ; one of them w 'is evidently a French woman, and as I judged (rightly) the gouvernante; tlie other! judged, from a certain air of distinction, to be Miss Montolieu. Her form was of the most delicate and fairy texture, her complexion was almost as white as her draper\, it was the pale¬ ness of that peculiar state of health, w bĺch seems affected by the irritation of
the mind : there was something fantastic almost to excess in her gestu.es, yet they were irresistibly graceful She appeared hardly fifteen; yet the expression, that sometimes wandered over her features spoke a mind and feelings that had out¬ gone the progrcssj of her frame, as a mind of eaily, and exquisite, and dan¬ gerous maturity : her white neck and arms were entirely uncovered ; her fair hair, entirely withdrawn from her face, was twisted in a tuft on the crown of the head ; a book was in her hand, which she laid down everv moment to rccon- uoitre the groupes that entered through her glass, and whisper the gouvernante in French, whose glaring dregs and offi¬ cious loudness, contrasted most forcibly tbe simple dress, and .reserve, and lan¬ guid articulation of her companion. I suppose I gazed intently on Miss Mon¬ tolieu ; perhaps, too, the glow of admira¬ tion had lit up my face, for Madame la UouYcrnante pointing to a passage in her
book, (Belinda) Oir she too was readiua\ о said audibly, ll II y'a infiniment l'air d'îin heros de Roman."' 1 híushed, vet i did not wish to appear ignorant oí French, or of the allusion, and turning to my father, Ì .said, ( Ido not remember with what truth) f * Apparemment с 'e -Л un grand orage/" Miss M. withdrew her eyes, but Madame- laughed with genuine French facilite, A splmáÍá lime-piece, which had once sparkled on a mantle-piece in the Louvre, had pointed its enamel led hand to seven» when ť lie profuse bows of ewer v one near the door announced the en¬ trance of Lord Montrevor. lie paused at the door to receive his handkerchief from his Frenchman, who was drench ing it with aíť:»r of гон\ and thru drawing up bis cravat, and drawing down his shut-«dee\cá hv their diamond button?, to intimili v» the liaste lie made to accommodate his Irish friends; he ad\axiced into the Сичкч dispersing
timidity by bows, of which nothing could exCi-ed the grariou > humility ; and con- riliafiiig iuri»:i.-ns by an address, of which nothing could re*\d LÍie allurement, He made the .omuletc tour, raying: the fame nothings to every one, yet contriving to make them appear different and conse¬ quential to each ; and bowed with the same grace a»id gravity to his daughter and her governess, as to any stranger pre¬ sent. Of my fattier, whom he recollected, or affected to recollect, he took the most flattering notice ; and of me, in conse¬ quence of Ыч introduction. There was no boy of seve .icen ardent and inexpe¬ rienced as I was, but must have been subdued by his address ; I thought him the most polished man in the world ; and ï was convinced in a moment, he had been grer.tly misrepresented in the cir¬ cumstances that were related of him. The ρ room of the chambers had twice been desired to summon his lady in vain :
dinner was at length announced, and we paraded into the immense salle á manger, where every thing announced the strug¬ gle between sudden magnificence and long neglect and desolation. The im¬ mense sideboard, of which the mahogany block legs might have supported the arches of a bridge, antl the brass might have ι loathed the cannon of a battery, could be brought no further than the hall from the narrowness of the doors ; there therefore it rested in surly state like a deposed monarch, and a display of plate, which for its magnitude might have ac¬ companied the sacrifice of an hetacomb, was displayed on a series of small fables aí one extremity of the room, the other was occupied by a large family piece, repre¬ senting Lady M. and some of her daugh¬ ters in the costume of nymphs, sacrificing to the garden god from a drawing of Angelica Kauflmaun's. This painting it was proposed by a new artist of cos-
turnes to surround with drapery instead of a frame, iu order to make the pyra» midal principle iu the groupe more ob¬ vious : at present, however, destitute of either frame or drapery, it served to stand before one of the chimney pieces, wis ich not being like the other of verde antique, his lordship's pure eyes could not bear to behold ; while the company commended his taste with chattering teeth, as one fixe in a room of vast di¬ mensions paved with marble, reconciled them very imperfectly to the virtu that had f comfort at one entrance quite shut out/ No light was tolerated but what was dispensed by lamps or tripods ; the dinner table therefore was placed under antique vases, which, suspended from the centre of the cieiing, nearly two feet distant from the summit of the epergne, shed over the table no light but ' darkness visi¬ ble/ and added to the confusion with which the company beheld an heap of
dishes of form and composition utterly unknown io them, whose names the French servants repeated with seriousness and surprise, that made a jest of famine and perplexity. Here, however, my father was perfectly at home. The arrangement of the fable was somewhat singular : his lordship sat at the head of the table, near him a scat was reserved apparently for his lady. Miss Montolieu took place of the nume¬ rous female visitor^ who were present, and his lordship's agent (to the no small displeasure of the company) was seated at the foot, his lordship declaring that he would entrust the carving of the fish which was placed there after the soup? ; to no one but Mr. Griffin, who was obliged to request one of the footmen to supply him with a temporary light from the side-tables, whenever he was called 01* in his carving capacitv. Dinner was to me more a matter of curiosity than indul·
gence, Hooked more at Lord Montrevor, than at his plate or his table. His figure was the most noble and majestic I ever beheld, had he not degraded it by the levity of dress hi the extreme of modern fashion. The glossy curls that shaded his face steamed with edence , his com¬ plexion was evidently heightened b ν art, and every part of his dress, to which an ornament could be appended, blazed with diamonds. His manner was irre¬ sistible, blending the extremes of state- liness and suavity ; he made every one feel his superiority, yet acquiesce in it, and enjoy his condescension though it marked the excess of his pride. Almost the whole of his conv ersation was addressed in French to the servant behind his chair, till finding, or conceiving, that an unknown language could impress his hearers with but confused notions of his grandeur, he condescended to speak Kulibb, but this was only that he VOL. 1. M
might repeat the h alf- English, half-clas- -ical, half-foreign names of the dishes, and wine 5 !, and furniture: the amphoree, and va«os, and urns, that were always specified as being on that marble table, or that bronze pedestal, of which tbe multitude and antique forms combining wiih the darkness, made us resemble a croupe dining amid the ruins of an Her¬ en laucan theatre. The fir -t course bad disappeared. ami the enormous plateau of silver that covered the centre of the table, w a· removed to и ake room for the lighter *Mubelli.diments of tiie second, when the doorwasthrownmiHsnally wide, and а к ind of bilent tumult among the menants an¬ nounced the entrance of Lady IM outre vor. The company ro v e with a common ex¬ presión of wonder, independent of tin* e\ample of bis lordship and Mbs Mon¬ tiglieli. I knownot how to speak at thi» moment: 1 wish 1 could borrow the coni
won hmtnnge of description, and tell as i would of any woman of tashion on her first appearance, how she glided along the room with a motion that appeared intended for air not earth, one hand gra^pioi>' her drapery, ihe other extended hi an attitude that made the command it conveyed ' k not to rise," impossible to obey. ír he approached the head of the fable, which every one wished at a di- 1 - tance, tbat they might sec her move io it again ; she wab then nearly opposite to mo, I had a full, fatal view of her, Whether in sport, or in negligence, she was in a morning dress, whose long slee ν е.* covered her hands, and whose collar ro*e to her ears, a traiu of a length which oidv *die could manage, flowed behind her almost to the door, and an enormous lace veil ahn·. .<*t shutting out her profile : vet from iťs fineness, permitting the light curN oo the t heek to be «een through it, fell equally from her lu^d, If v >
and extended to the ground. Her form was that of a Grecian priestess, or of the deity, at whose shrine a Grecian priestess might stand. She looked round her, something like a smile of triumph or of sportiveness was on her features ; our awkward wonder, our audible murmur, must have amused her. She was deter¬ mined to allow us no respite. (( No stir¬ ring—I beg, I intreat, or whatever else I ought to do/' The first tones of her voice, were like music to the first ears that heard it. She turned round, " What—a chair reserved for me—this is quite the ban¬ quet scene in Macbeth. If I sit in that chair, I shall absolutely imagine myself the ghost of Banquo, or his wife; who is probably a ghost also by this time/* The servant attempted to remove the chair, ({ No, it will do if you remove that enor¬ mous woolsack cushion ; there is too much sensual accommodation in it, pour
un habitant spirituelle." ÍC Shall I have the pleasure of helping you to some pheasant, Lady Montrevor?" is Was it you, my Lord, that made my empty chair be placed near you, to reconcile yourself to its contemplation?" (i La Jeunesse, apportez les fricaudeaux, il me semble que Madame" " La Jeunesse, make haste and gel me some soup, if the noble lord on the woolsack has finished his speech." Lord Montrevor had just called for the discarded cushion, or rather mattrass of morocco leather ; it was impossible for man to speak with more stately courtesy than his lordship, or for woman to answer w itli more airy contempt than his lady, How I heard these few words I cannot imagine. I remember them only because they were her's, for I wished to be all eye. I was all eve ; and the partial and shaded glimpse of features which gleam¬ ed through the folds of her veil, like the moon through a silken, summer-evening
cloud, fed me with thoughts of ima¬ ginable beauty. I can speak of her at no time, for every time I saw her she was different ; it is difficult to speak of her mode of beauty, it is more difficult to speak of her a^e. She was so matchless a mistress of the art of beauty, and dress, and cosmetics, that she delighted to mo¬ dify the costume of her face and form, and time, which is more stubborn than either. I have seen her when with a few arbutus berries or convolvoli twisted among lier flaxen ringlets, with scarce a trace of rouge on her cheeks, but her red halfopen lip warm with a tinge, like a melted ruby; her robe scarce touching the s round, and no ornament on her white bosom but one curl ; she appeared hardly eighteen, if age could be attached to the stvle of nymph-like and acriel beauty sin* had choi en —and 1 have seen her when amid a blaze of rouge and dia-
monds, the folds of her dark and shining hair, surmounted by a sparkling fiai ^ and her train strewing the floor with ro>es, she appeared the sultaness of the seraglio, the queen of fairy-laud, the presiding genius of splendour and volup¬ tuousness, high and sparkling as a star, and o'er-informmg her sphere with light and lustre; such as she was that dav, her beauty was that of a Madona, and her age seemed hardly that w hiel; i s usually ascribed to the character. Her rouge had given place to pcail-powder, and her proud »mile and haught^ coii- n-icusness which she usually p. hì reti oa .-í rangers, were exchanged for a reiiriii,^ grace, a soft suppression of сЬагпь, j partial and uno» nressi ve plance of оЬм*г- vation, w hi «di ï could vs ish to havo con¬ tinued for ever ; 1 could at lea^í lune been content toga/e on them for ever, but I was doomed to be the beroof the dav. ť'ome one mentioned my name------ m i
Lady M. immediately applied her glass, and inquired was I the gentleman to whom Miss M. owed her safety ? she was answered in the affirmative, and I was assailed with a torrent of inquiries, and condolences, and commendations; which I would have silenced at any price, to have caught the sound of the only praise my ear thirsted for, but which the ge¬ neral clamour effectually drowned. This was not all; after the first tumult, Lady M. said to the servant in French, (i I hope, La Jeunesse, you asked Sir. B/s pardon for your unfortunate mistake/' La Jeunesse, with ¿ill the glaring manner of a Frem hman, immediately advanced, and throw big himself on his knees, supplicat¬ ed mv pardon with the mott pompous humility. 1 would rather a thousand times have sto >d a second shot f/oni him; í felt the blood literally mounting to the roots of my hair. Lady M. saw or felt it, she called off La Jeunesse, but before
he had finished his speech, a new scene relieved me from observation. With the same tumult, and tbe same dress with which they would enter astable, Lord Roschamp and his friend plunged into the room, and rushing up to Lord and Lady Μ , accosted them in tones that made the roof echo. (: Why what the devil—what hours are those you keep ? the fellows in the hall tell me you have been an hour at it, and it is scarce half past eight o'clock." ť * I always dine at the hour mentioned in m v card ; had not your lordship a card ?"

In my con¬ fusion I dropt it ; and in my confusion would have died, had not the charming animal sprung from his master, seized it at the very moment she was stooping for it, and tore the Rees 's reputation to atoms in a moment. Sir John and the peer remembered the whole story in a moment. <f Damme, it was a most famous hoax ; and how con¬ foundedly blank the Rees looked, when you told her you were just going to re¬ turn it, and lamented the etour der ies of Cæsar/* The dog was loaded with praises; and after being crowned with flowers taken from the dessert, and tearing Lady M/s veil in resistance of his new bönors, was led out of the room.

The ladies retired. The conversation became more general. Lord Roschamp and his frier.d observed me with a kind of contemptuous jealousy. 1 ft>It »ni- fated, and proud, and watchful, like a bov first animated by female excellence, and conscious or desirous of something c^ua) to it in himself. Lord Montrevor spoke exclusively of himself, his plans, and his circum¬ stances. He alluded, with the ut¬ most nonchalance, to the petite em¬ barras tiuit had made a retreat to Ireland for a short time expedient ; but he spoke of his splendid and exclusive connexions, of his eldest son, the envoy at a northern court, and his son-in-law, the first politi¬ cal character in Great Britain, and of the numerous arrangements already made for his return, and that he hesitated be¬ tween accepting an appointment as am¬ bassador at------—, or a place at court, with a pension on the Irish establishment; but that he had always been in the habit
of sacrificing bis own feelings, and ob¬ jects í о those of his family, whom he wished to indulge with an excursion to liebmd; and I can scarcely,*' be con¬ tinued. <f regret any circumstances that have placed me in the circle by whom I feel myself so happily surrounded at present—hi Jeunesse, more Burgundy/* This speech, the latter part of H parti- eularlv, uttered with agrace, wbich not .-eon, cannot be described, was irresistible tn the audience. 1 retired amid the con- fu-ion of compliments and toasts; my whole soni was in the drawing-room; caid-tables were laid, and co flee distri¬ buted. Lady -Montrevor, rcclinipg on a canopied couch, was endeavouring to describe to a few stragglers the eíľecís of the Turkish costume, in a boudoir, which she purposed ihiishiug from some sketches, by Miss Montolieu, that lav on a table before her. ° The draperies are to be alternately suspended by silver eres-
cents and heron-plumes. What ăo you 1 think, Miss Montolieu, of the Paradise plume for the centre?" I approached the table. cc Mr. Bethel, is it possible ? how could you leave my lord or his Bur¬ gundy so soon? I thank you in the name of the ladies and the tea-urn. Like an ancient conqueror, I perceive you prefer being crowned with the leaf, to being crowned with the fruit. I must sketch anew costume for tea-urns; and instead of this unmeaning tripod, your figure shall he placed above or below it, to in- t "mate the support you lend it " Lady M . was merciless inhadinage. I be¬ lieve I was ten minutes in replying : C( That they who could retire to her drawing- room, had little merit in the preferi lcc/' — - ťť That's vastly well ; but if you want to make speeches, I beg it may be to the ladies, to whom I have been talking in my sleep for the last half hour, in order to persuade them I was awake. Nothing
is more dreadful than to see a number of unhappy females saying things to each other in that case made and provided. If you will venture on the duty, I am perfectly ready to resign in your favor. Remember to yawn lustily and with a good courage; I believe I shall give you for a watchword, La stupidite " I laugh¬ ed, and promised to obey orders. I was contented to bear all her wit, to be per¬ mitted to look at the lips that uttered it. (i In France," said she, i( as Sterne says, they order these matters better; they have a thousand ways of making a man useful or ornamental. Genlis tells a story of an officer who, as Mr. Bethel saySj obeyed orders too well; and his fe¬ male friends ripped all the gold-lace oft* his regimentals, pour partiler, and got the only bright thing from him the poor man had to giye. If you have got any gold-lace on your coat or on your lining, Mr. В., don't put us to the trouble ot*
ripping it oif/' I collected courage to observe, that her ladyship's wit was м> much more brilliant, that it must ellipse everv other effort. l( Tinsel, mere tinsel/' said she, almost with a sigh ; Ci but it does as weil for fommon use. The value of wit, as ¿he jewellers say of plates, depends more on the fashion than the weight; and this light currency saves credit, and gains time, two great points in preventing a bankruptcy of—conversation." One of the company now ventured on an observation which she had treasured since Lady M/s first sally, viz. that gentlemen by the rules of fashion were rendered per¬ fectly useless to the ladies. (i Pardon me," said Lady M. fť we wereld v mis taken formeriv with regard to then en pacity ; it was an error of our grandmo¬ thers tbat men could be made con verü¬ ble; this we have long abjured, ii i.v melancholy iadeed to think bow many
unfortunate men were persecuted to death in consequence of it ; but since ochave found out they are not rational animals, but merely animals of burthen, we have treated them according to their capacity, and given them our ridicules, and parasols, and trains to carry, and it succeeds vastly well. You would hardly believe what progress Lord Roschamp, as bad as he appears, made in learning to carry my train in Kensington-Gardens on his arm." The ladies laughed at what they coukl hardly venture to believe; and one of them observed, that such merit in men did not require ímich judgment, at least, in determining. ki Oh, an immensity of judgment—judgment in persons i uicuii, The Rees, last summer, when she was at Brighton, made poor Sir John beur her ridicule about every day, nuú esvry one thought the weight of it would drag him into the Steine/' Utterly ignorant *>f the female, world, I observed., like a
wild Irishman as I was, that her ridicule was the least supportable burthen a lady could impose, (< Do you think so," said Lady M. laughing ; " I shall punish you for your contumacy, by throwing the whole weight of mine on you for the evening/' As she spoke, she took up a small silk bag that lay on the sopha, aud flung it sportingly on my arm. She would not have done it, had she known the danger that was in her touch. Had a mountain been heaped upon me, I could have borne it better. She must have seen it, she took it off my arm. I purposely entangled the strings that I might see her beautiful hands near me longer. (e You appear to find the ridicule intolerable/* said she; " actually, u vou were m v Lord Loveľs ч/ Т J %) ghost, who has got his own head to carry- under bis arm, you could not be more out of countenance/ 4 A number of gentlemen now came up; she was instantly surEOUiided» by
Lord Roschamp and Sir John Orberry, and others, and instantly she assumed the trifler. I retired to where Miss M., like a faint star in the neigh¬ bourhood of a full bright moon, sat reading at the extremity of the sopha. She had never opened her lips, or remit¬ ted her studies since I saw her. There was something in her silence, her reserve and her apparent alienation from her mo¬ ther that interested me. I had only heard her speak once the whole evening ; as the ladies left the dining-room, I heard her say in a low voice to Lady Montrevor, " I hope you are well, I be¬ lieve I have not seen your ladyship since we arrived in Ireland/* I knew not how to approach her ; Lady M/s inces¬ sant and ambitious blaze of wit, though it repelled all answer, invited approach. But how could a reader be interrupted? As she read, I observed she marked some pages with leaves which she pulled from
a rose in her bosom. It was the only »object about her, except her eyes and hair that was not of ihe purest white. The contrast struck the eye softly, but forcibly. As the door opened, one of the rose-leaves was wafted from the book, and fell at my feet, I took it up, bhe received it with the ease of one who was accustomed to attention; and ap¬ pearing to feel that this w as some demand on her attention, said in a low voice,, 4< The impressions this charming author leaves on the mind, are not so fugitive as the marks I endeavoured to fix them by." She held out her book. í looked into it; it was Rousseau's Heloïse. I saw it with dread and disgust. The whole of our library at home con¬ sisted of the works of the modern philoso¬ phers, and the French writers, who a few years before the revolution, had excited the thirst of outrage and innovation, which could afterwards be only queiwh-
κ1 by blood, When I wished for solid reading, I was presented wiih Godwin's t Political Justice, Mrs. Wolstonccrofi's Rights of Woman, Rousseau's Contrat Saciai, or Voltaire's Dictionnaire Philo¬ sophique. If I wished for lighter rcad- ir.ir, I had only Voltaire's or the King of Prussia's bad verses against the Im¬ mortality of tbe Soul, or the insipid and infamous novels of Rousseau, Crcbillon, or Diderot. The effect of this perse¬ cution on my mind was "most revolting and salutary I could not bear the names of these men ; their superficial knowledge, their petulant scepticism, their sickly and anatomical sentimen¬ tality, their flimsy and inconsequential reasoning, their eternal philosophising on trifles, and treating as trifles all that is important or excellent, or precious to man, either as a rational or social ageuf, had filled me with an abhorrence which familiarity only increased, and which ih/ir popularity never tempted me to
conceal.' I do not know that my resist¬ ance to their mischiefs would have been resolute or effectual, hut for my ac¬ quaintance with Mr. Corbett. He sup¬ plied me with books which refuted them; he furnished me with conversation which refuted them ; he exhibited to me a life which refuted them. Politenessprevented me expressing what I felt at discovering; Miss M.'s studies. "My library has not yet arrived, "said she; (i but in Rousseau I feel every defect supplied.'*— iSr I make no doubt of it/' said I. <<r I am, however, expecting the rest every day/' said Miss Montolieu. I breathed a mental wish that they might never arrive. iC They are every one of them French/' said the gouvernante ad¬ vancing; i{ for I am uncommonly select in the choice of Mademoiselle's studies.** í praised her selection as well as I could, " î never wish to read works in any other language," said Miss Montolieu. i( Cesi la ¡angue d'amour " said nia- 3

"No Frenchwoman can hear a Compliment without believing it in¬ tended for herself. Heaven knows [ was perfectly innocent of the appli¬ cation. .Miss Montoiteiťs graceful о declension of merited adulation, her silence, her simplicity, though all ap¬ peared ihe studied effect of a vitiatcil btate of feeling, touched me nnwt forci¬ bly more forcibly contrasted with the rouge, and loquacity, and gku in<;* ma¬ niere of her companion. 1 was astonish- «•d' that a woman hitrj.lv-bred as Ladv -Montrevor, could be seduced b v fashion, into permitting such a female to altend her daughter. But Lady Montrevor ι ol. i. N
seemed to forget her daughter and every oue ebe in a whispered conference with Lord Roschamp. lie was leaning fear¬ lessly on the lion-fronted arm of her couch. Sometimes he whispered, and sometimes she smiled, as if the objects around them were fu ruishing the subject of their mirth. At length, after a most violent yawn, (C What upon earth/' said the peei, t: coukl have driven you to this horrid place ?" — tr i protest I can't ima- gin'*/' said lier ladyship ; cc for you see it neither secures against intrusions nor inquiries. W- c You cant conceive," said Lord Roschamp, after another violent vawn, (C what au amazing splash it made. í never heard any thing tell so famously in my Hf 1 ; and happening just at that time of the year to—damme it gave all Løndon something to talk and think of too the v» hole season/'— ŕ To think of ? ,J repeated Lady M.; " Oh î you are toi» fiatici ii:g.

It was most amazingly famous ber îa^t explosion: d'ye remember Or¬ berry ?"— ťt Oh ! upon my soul, 1 always patronized the dowager, that is, tolerated her and her suppers, 1 mean. 1 taught her how to part with a few lacks of her superfluous rupees, though, damme, it was as much as I could do to sit opposite

Damme, if *-he van not exactly like that bronze >pbin\ on the tripod there, with her fixed eve.*, and her burnished skin— quite bronze upon my soul/ 1 — cc Quite bronze," re¬ peated Lady Montrevor; ( ' but vou dil not discover that till you lrd taken off all her gilding." The incorrigibles laughed Sir John· strolled off to hedge in a het agaim.í my father, whom he conceived to be the fìat, in a game of picquet he had just com¬ menced with Lord Montrevor. in ihl·, however, he was mistaken; my ibi her. who played with the judgment of a veteran, won considerably ; and İt was diverting to see the rueful surprise with which he parted with his money, con¬ trasted with the courtly bows and com¬ mendations with which Lord Moaùcvor,
who always possessed himself, greeted his antagonist's skill and success. Lord Roschamp was in the mean time importuning Lady M. to touch her harp ; she trifled with his importunity, but when I faulteringly joined in the request, she ordered the harp to be brought. (( My harp has hung so long on the willows in this land of banishment/' said she, <f that I believe it has forgot itself to silence/' I w r ill not describe the attitude she assumed, placing herself at it, nor the wayward and capricious graces with which she waved her arms, while aflecting to be impatient at the delay in tuning it. She was one whom ct every thing became:" to be proud, fastidious, fantastic, seemed in her only the excess of feeling, the frolic of luxuriance. I cannot describe her attitudes for in a short time, I wished to have no sense but that of hearing. The effect of perhaps the
first singer of the age, on an ear which had yet possessed a sensibility of plea¬ sure it had never experienced, may easily be left to imagination. Here were not the whispered tones and imitative manner of a private performer ; the influence of her character extended to her musical faste. Careless of pleasing, she was secure of admiration, and content to be ad¬ mired, and the liquid chirrup and bird- like execution of her voice in high and rapid passages, was quite the super¬ natural of the art. Her powers had been acquired or formed during a long residence in Italy. Music was the only thing «die ever would acknowledge she had studied. She never sung any music but Italian, of English mu-dc she spoke with ludicrous contempt, and of Irish, till she heard it. Pleased with my ardent and unhackneyed admiration, she called on Miss M. to accompany her in some duets. They who have ever listened to music .
from the half-open, quivering lip of beauty may guess my feelings. She was an enchantress formed for delight and destruction. The cards were now uni¬ versally forsaken; those who had musical feeling, were richly recompensed, and those who had not listened that they might be able to tell others that they had heard Ladv M. sing. In the midst of a note \f 4.* whicli she was permitting to die away, tijl the car seemed to lose its power iu the pleasure of following it, she suddenly stopped, declaring that it was always- better к) stop when she was tired herself» than to wait till others were tired, and no persuasions could induce her to renew her song. The card-players retired in some confusion, Lady M. expressing lier regret for the disturbance, and her hope that they had all committed the state of the game to writing, before they had left their tables, as they would find it more profitable, than t( marking the mušiek/' as Lorenzo says. " You cant
conceive how much time and admiration you have been throwing away,** said Lady M.— tf Music is quite passe now as ! found it to my loss after purchasing that superb-harp, just as all the world allowed 1 was equal or superior to Gabrielli, in caprice at least, The deity of caprice iu the form of a certain Duchess, voted dancing tobe quite the fashionable thing, and instantly e\eiy one with or without ears or legs began dancing. I would not yield to this táraní ula-fit. 1 announced a concert for everv ball of the enemy. The coûtent was terrible. All the morning papers amused themselves, and the town, conjecturing whether the Duchess would be compelled to withdraw her steps, or Lady \> e-thau'pton to change her notes. \ am hure the paragraph·» were furnished by my furone de chambre, they are ex¬ actly the quaintuesves of Bennet. At la^t, a kind of hollow Amiens treaty of peace was pate bed up by some common friends : wc met on a kind of mutual
ground. She told the guarantees she would sit out my concerts, and I told them I would walkthrough her halls, and so we danced for a couple of winters, like the sun and moon in the rehearsal, to eclipse each other, till my "total eclipse/' which has left room for any other body to interpose that possesses sufficient mag¬ nitude or attraction.'*'' <c Upon my soul I was at the most famous thing given in London since you left it, aí the Duche-Vs about three weeks ago ; quite an amazing thing, the most knowing sfyle, all tlu> rooms by tbe first artists, done all with· lamps and flowers and paintings Thev toldmc all about ii, for there was a kind of Ciceroni that was ίο tell every body when they went from the LJjsiau Field* to ihe Deserts of Arabia/* I dare say the information was quite uru ssary/' said Lady Montrevor, tf But w hat struck mc most was the Turkish liaram and her Grace as the fair Fatima." ŕt Are you positive/' iíúd Lady Montrevor, (( that U

VEILED PROTECTREStS.
СНАРТЕП Г. ANNA Fitnnaimce se seldom left the Abbey since the increasing debility of sir Herbert had seriously alarmed lady Cliarle- ville, that the colonel was not sorry when bis niece, the reverend Mr. Fitzmaurice's daughter, came to Southampton with an officer and lus lady, in consequence of part of the tatter's regiment being stationed there, as be feared such strict, nay almost ffieiandholy confinement, would injure both hér health and spirits, and'it now became necessary that she should often d· the bö- noitts of theGrange to her cousin and her friends, and sometimes visit them at South- VOL. iv. в
ampton. Eliza Fitzmaurice soon became а favourite with bor. vnele, and made her¬ self an interest in the regard of her cousin; she was an elegant, well-informed young wWmn, Md 'ftlt a TstipYodw áffèotionfor this -newly-discovered relative, who. she agreed could not be too attentive to her early protectors ; she therefore considered every hour she devoted to her or her friends as real proofs of herregard. When curiosity to see this now-rich cousin brought her elder brother (who had, as we have related, overlooked the charms Of sir Charles's fashionable daugh¬ ters) to Southampton, in his way to а friend's sn the New Forest, Eliza wrote ι her linde a very gay note upon his arrival, requesting be would allow her to intro¬ duce him to him and Anna that afternoon at fbe Grange, as be talked of starting early the next morning, and y et felt anx- ■ ious to «ее such nearielations-, they would merelystake their tea with them, as ber brother Was engaged to sup with a party at her host's, therefore they should not trespass much upon Anna's time.
The colonel, who was rather anxious to see this future representative of his family, who had never chanced to be at home when he visited his father, and who he understood was very independent in his notions, whicli had kept him from intru¬ ding uninvited at the Grange, sent a very ttind answer to his niece's note, desiring she and her brother would dine witli liim; he should send his carriage for tliem at three o'clock, and Anna should give them the meeting, sotting out for the Abbey as soon as be, the messenger, had departed. Sir Herbert was very happy when any tiling occurred to enliven tlie tedium of Anna's confinement, acknowledging that he daily clung more and more to her so¬ ciety, at her musical talents constituted his chief amusement Tbe colonel promised she should be at borne before be retired for the night: this the baronet negatived; he would not tie his favourite down to aa houi?—if he met her at breakfast the next day, he should think himself much favour¬ ed. The colonel therefore took ber home, to в 3
give, as he said, the finishing stroke to his preparations, though he merely uimed at elegance in his entertainments, never at shew Mr Titzmaunce and his sister amved at the appointed time, and though he saw much to admire m Anna, she saw nothing striking in either his person or manners, both w ere far from disagreeable, but she considered him as one of those every day characters who require some fortuitous cır cumstance to bring them into notice llie day went off very pleasantly, and the colonel politely regretted his nephew s pre engagement, when he ordered his cu ruge to convey lnm and Ins sister to Southampton, telling lum, now he had visited his farm, he should exjiect to sec lnm agam he feared tliere w ould soon be a termination of Annas confinement whether or not, he should always be glad to see lum Mr Titzmaunce was no less polite in return, and when he was gone the colonel told Ins daughter he wished he had select ed either of Ins other cousins, since sir
Charles was anxious they should not change their name, for his uwn part, lie never did, nor never could opprove of mamages between relations Anna spoke as she thought of tbe young man the sound of wheels dnvmg round the sweep led her to suppose the carnage was returned, and w as coming to the door to convey her to the Abbey, when а ser vant came in saying— ' Here ıs a post¬ chaise, madam, sent by Mrs Nelson to conduct you to her house, she lias been taken very ill, and wishes to see jou nu mediately, as she has something of great importance to communicate 1 efore slit dies " Before she dies ' exclaimed the se nously al ırmed Anna, vvho was extremely attached to this worthy woman "why, this must have Ыег a veiy sudden attack— she was very well yesterday Let us see the postillion, my dear sir, accompanying htr father into the hall The 1 id had dismounted, and w as stand¬ ing at his horses heads he repeated what the seivant had said, adding—" She was
taken ill this afternoon, madam Dr ----- w as immediately sent for from Southamp ton, and I have just brought lnm over for the second time I come from the Dol plini, as you may perceive, pointing to the name on the chaise " I dare say you know me, madam I am a Charing bd, and can remember you when you lived at Walton lhave lived six jears with my piesent master Di — mtans to ie main with the worthy woman, who has often sav cd me « good hiding, till mid night, he told ine and it was hewhosent me off for you I can either bring j on back here or take you to the Abbey as I don t mean to put my horses up they Want a little exercise—we have been very slack of late Anna bad put on her bonnet and man¬ tle, which a servant had brought her while the lad was running on anil then telhng her fatlier that she should either spend the night with Mrs Nelson who had often Watched over her, or proceed to the Ab bey, she bade Him farewell, declaring she w as all impatience to see the poor soul
The colonel handed her mto tlie thiuse —" Had I thought j ou would have re¬ ceived suth α summons, Hunter should not have gone with the carnage to South« ampton, now I don't know who to send with you, except one of the grooms. ' " I shall require no attendant, my dear sir, the driver is not а strangei, tnd 'tis sui'i a step, I do not entertain the slight¬ est fear of meeting with any accident " " I will forfeit my life, colonel, if any harm befals Miss," cried the postboj, springing into his saddle, and dm mg off at а pietty quick rate The colonel returned into the bouse, half blaming himself, now it was too late, for not 1 aung accompanied his daughter, and feeling half inclined to follow hpr on foot to Chnung, when he recollected that the house would probably be full of the good woman's relatives and neighbours, and that he should only be in the w ay, not doubting but Anna w ould contnve to let him know if she spent the night with her, and how she found her. Miss Fitzmaunce was so much occupied
with Mrs Nelsons danger, that she scarcely heeded the road she went till she came to the Albey park wall, whete the high trees cast such a shade, that though the moon was at the full the dnvei slack¬ ened his pace, appealing to be veiy caie ful, when to her great surprise he tinned out of the direct road to Channg, and struck into a cross road lending to Win ehester —" What can tin silly lad be thinking of?" she exclaimed, letting down the front glass, and calling. " You are going wrong—you should have gone straight forward " Don t be alarmed, madam I know what I am about, and as tlie road is rough, I will dnve the slower * This unsatisfactory reply gave her а de¬ gree of alarm, though she could hardly de- hne her own feelings she did not recollect either the postboy s face or voice when he turned to addrtss her, nay, she fancied lie spoke differently to what he had done at her father's door yet he was dressed in the sort of livery generally worn by the Dol¬ phin postboys, and if he was a native oi
Chai mg, what could she have to appre¬ hend ? Letting down the side glasses, she endeavoured by the hght of the moon to read the writing upon the doors, but her scrutiny only increased hır indefinable dread, as, though the landlord's name was certainly to be seen, she perceived it was painted upon canvas, and stuck upon the carriage, which now struck her as bemg mueh better fitted up, and much hand¬ somer than hack-chaises were in general Rousing hei courage, and recalling her scattered ideas, she calmly desired the lad to stop, feeling assured that the more pre¬ sence of mmd she displayed, the li ss she should bav e to dread, telling him he was not in the road to Channg, ai d tliat, even if the one he was puisuing led tliere, it was very dangerous for a carriage. The driver seemed to be aware of the truth of her assertion, and ajypearsd rather at a loss what course to pursue, till she agam, man юге imperative tone, command¬ ed lum to stop He did so, and then dis¬ mounting,, advanced to the cluuse-dotsr, 13
which he opened, and having let down a carpeted folding step, he bent one knee upon it, declaring himself to be, not a postchaise driver, but the most ardent of lovers, who had braved every danger and the resentment of h s own and her family, to insure his future happiness by making her his wife, nnd while he had life, he would never resign her, not even to colonel ritz¬ maunce *' Surely," thought our heroine, " I am m tbe power of а maniac—yet he spoke reasonably at the Grange " Hardly know¬ ing what to say, and still more perplexed what to do, as she could not cope with α fine stout young man, who seemed deter mined to detain her, she requested to know who he was? where they had met before? and what could have induced him to adopt so strange a method to prove his regard? " My father is an earl, loveliest of your sex, and you must have seen me frequent¬ ly at Soutlian pton within the last month, eince I have been your shadow ' "Arejou lord Dundee? Then indeed
I can suppo»e you may have found it ne¬ tessary to have recourse to stratagem, if you are as much in love as you profess, since I am sure your father would never forgive your selecting the daughter of a commoner, after having entered into an engagement with the daughter of a duke ' " You have exactly explained my situa¬ tion , and till I saw you, I could hav e obey - ed my father's wishes—now it is impos sible, and I could almost swear never to rise from this humble posture till y ou have consented to render me the tnvy of the world " I certainly do and ought to feel highly flattered at having inspired such a passion, which, I fear, almost borders upon msa nity, y ou have pursued so str inge a mode of couitslnp, but as I am a planı country girl, and always endeavoui to shun noto¬ riety, you will greatly oblige me if j ou will return to the Grange, or, if you had lather, why set me down at Mrs îselsons, who is, of course, not m the dangerous state j ou represented, and T will gloss over this prjof of youi íegard, by ltpoitmg it
to be in consequence of a wagtr—or job shall dictate what I am to say, and I will certainly take your proposals into serious consideration, without even putting my father in my confidence, you can tell me how and where I may addiess you m wnting," feeling inclined to make any concessions short of promising hnn her hand, to bnng him to terms " Can you suppose, my dear Miss Iitz maunce, that I can relinquish my jn esent project for such mere vogue hopes as you hold out' I am not so easily duped j ou are completely in my po> er , m another hour we sball be at Winchester, there I shall take post-horses, and vve will pioceed to London, where I shall be better able to induce you to favour my wishes, since be¬ fore twelve o'clock to-morrow I hope to call you mine, a special licence is in lea¬ diness, we are both more than of age, and I am resolved to carry my point Your money shall be secured to youiself—But I am wasting time in discussing what you aball settle as you please, and defeinng
the happiness I have mn such usks to in¬ sure That is all that surprises me lejouicd the certainly pu turned Anna but affut ing а calmness she was viry far fiom fetl mg sinte wh j nted jou have run iway with me before jou ki tw my mind' I am not devoid of ambition and your ofitrs are very liberal therifoie do sufftr mc to have a voice m the business—you do not do yourself justtte by åtting so very pie cipitately I tannot return to Channg I have made up my mind as to consequences therefore 01 lj compose yourstlf since I un resolved to proceed though I never drove postillion before I can manage four in hand thcrefoi e you have nothing to fear launching out into such a rhapsody that tl heroine of his romanee felt more tlian ever tonvmccd he must be deranged, since lus langu ige was tl at of an Oroon dates, mingled with such threats as even highwaymen seldom hold out to defence less females While she was lost m wonder and amaze, and unable to suppose he really
knew what be was about, he closed the door, mounted his horse, and drove for¬ ward Rallying her spirits, after а few mi¬ nutes given to re flection, and to η fervent supplication to the Giver of all good, she conceived that if she were obligee! to pro¬ ceed to Winchester, he could not force her to continue her journey mdeed she w as fiimly resolved he should not, if she awoke every soul m the town, as at the rate he was nowdiiving, m consequence of the increasing badness of the road, she much doubted their ben g there before midnight But they bad not proceeded more than а quarter of a mile, when ber gentleman postillion found himself in a v ci у avv kw ard predicament a cart loaded with dung hav ing broken down in the evening, rem uned where the accident had liappened, the road being so httle of a thoroughfare, the far¬ mer's men had merely taken off the horses, meanmg to return in the morning with further assistance Our gentleman did manage to get out of the deep ruts, but he was doubtful whether there was sufh-
tient room on either side to admit of bis passing; it was however necessary to make the attempt, and he conceived he could do it best on the offside, where the road sloped considerably from the middle till it -vas bounded by a rising bank — " No danger," he called out—" there is not the slightest risk, bı t the next moment the carriage would evidently hove been quite over, if it had not fallen against the said bank Anna, who was perfectly aware of her danger, had prudently let down all the glasses, and fortunate it vv is for her she had so much forethought, as the chaise being a landaulette, flew open with tbe sboik, and she ftll completely ovu the bank, while the crash having frightened the horses, they were rearing and plun ging, and but for the impediment m their road, would have dragged the recumbent carnage forward She instantly recovered her feet, and unconscious of having re ceived any hurt, as instantly took to her heels, hardly knowing whether Ьет postil¬ lion saw her or not, but hoping, as was tht fact, the bank concealed her from his view,
nor did she venture to look behind till she leached some very lofty trees, at least a hundred yards from where the accident had happened, and though the moon shone л ту bright, she could not distinguish even the cart, which of course remained station¬ ary, owing to a bind in the road but hardly stopping to take breath she run forwards, knowing she was barely a mile fiom the park w ill, and from α gate whitti slie ftlt sure of being able to climb, tbough she knew it was always kept locked Having taken suc h an advance she ven¬ tured to make for this spot, and fear al¬ most giving her wings, she mouuted the gate in an instant and felt quite secme when she struck into a thick shrubbeiy, where she slackened her pace to a walk, certain that if hei mad lover had even seen lu r leap the gate, up would be perfectly at a loss which way to turn within the paik, she therefore paused to listen, but no rvoiind of footsteps met her ear, which induced her to proceed very deliberately towards the bouse, choosing to make liei entrée through the offices to ringing at
the portal bell, so fearful was she of alarm¬ ing sir Herbert, w bo, as it was near eleven, she supposed hud reared The seivants presumed she had been set down at tbc lodge Her maid having come foi w ard, she desired her to attend her to bei ditssing-iooni, telling another ser¬ vant to let ludy Charleville, who was pre¬ paring to sit down to supper, know she vv as returned, and would join her in a few minutes Being in mourning for colonel Hertford, her dress was not much disor¬ dered by her hasty walk, but having reached her apartment, she wrote three hnes to her father, which ran as follows
" MY DEAR FATHER, " May I request to see you as earlyns possible to-morrow moining? Mrs Nelson is in no danger, make no inquiries respecting her till we have met, and be lieve me to be," &c This she desired her maid to give her own groom to conv'ëy to Channg, who
need not wait for an answer. She then joined lady Charleville, more inclined to laugh than to grieve at her late romantic adventure.
CHAPTER II. As no servants ever waited at supper, and the baronet had retired, our heroine, briefly and with her father's drollery, re¬ lated the strange occurrences of the last hour-and-half, adding—" If I did not wish to consign the very silly business to obli¬ vion, I should like to know how, or whe¬ ther my wild enamórate has extricated himself from the difficulty I left him in." " 1 never beard of so strange an attempt, or so wild a scheme," replied the really astonished lady Charleville : " but before I ask another question, we will send Tur¬ ner, on whose discretion vve may rely, and to whom we need not enter into any ex¬ planations, to see whether this mad fool
remains entangled with the cart, as lie may have paid dearly foi his folly— noy, have been kilitti by s u sin violent horses, nngmg for tins confidential servant, who readily undeistood what her ladyship wished him todo, aud instintly departed, assuring the ladies they should see him agam in α very short tune During his absence Anna agam repeat¬ ed all that had occurred from tile moment Of her be »ig summoned to attend the dy¬ ing Mrs Nelson " Had yon any recollection of this strange mortal 5 " None at all he may be, as he gave me to understand, lord Dundee, but he did not remind me ofthat nobleman, as he appeared taller and stouter, perhaps owing to his disguise but surely the viscount could not have acted so absuid a part, as report says he is upon the eve of marnage, if it were him, I have no scruple m pio nouneing hım insane, and I do not envy him Ins present feelings if he is sufficient¬ ly m lus senses to be aware of his folly, whioh, except my father differs Very much
from my opinion, I shall never publish, since I do not feel at all proud at having been made the heroine of such an adv en ture, ogam laughing at the ludicrous dc duration ol this daring lover " Like you, my love, I think he must be deranged, and as you have escaped without having been obliged to make Ins folly public, I hope he has not been suffi ciaitly hurt to prevent his pursuing his journey, he certainly must have had some servants hovering about, if not withm call" The return of Turner set their mmds at ease respecting his safety, as he told them be had merely been able to perceive that a Carriage bad been overturned, one of the lamps having been left in the rood, and two slips of canvas, which seemed to indi¬ cate it belonged to Mr -----of the Dol¬ phin , yet the lamp had not the appear¬ ance of belonging to a hack chaise "Leave it with me," said lady Chaile¬ ville, giving lum a pound note for his trouble, and desiring he would not men- tion tlie circumstance among the seivants
Nor did the groom who went to the Grange learn any thing likely to excite bis curiosity, since he did not dismount ; and the servant vvho took the note from him was not the one who told Miss Fitz¬ maurice of the arrival of the postchaise; therefore her short journey had as yet ex¬ cited no comments. " Well, I am very glad the silly fellow has departed in peace," cried Anna; " should he have lost a little of his mad blood, it may prove an eventual benefit, and help to restore him to his sober senses. You must assist me, my dear lady Charle¬ ville, in persuading my father not to no¬ tice his ridiculous exploit, since I cannot bear the'idea of becoming an object of no¬ toriety through the mad freak of such a fool." " But how shall we account for your having left the Grange in a hack chaise to visit the supposed-dying Mrs. Nelson, since your father's servants must very soon learn she has never been ill ?" " I think we must attribute my journey to a freak of my cousin's, who wished me
to sup with thui) at Southampton, and who tutored а ι,ιιιΐΐΐ'ΐηαη todraw me from home under pi ett nee of taking me to dia¬ ling, but, upon mv discovering the in¬ tended deception, lit left me at the park lodge 1 ¡us story may pass current, though some tew may doubt its bemg gospel, but as no one can fed either concerned or in¬ terested m the business, I thmk uns will prevent many idle rumours, and many il¬ liberal sui mises— I hope my father wdl be of my way of thinking ' Lady Charleville felt assured the colo¬ nel would be guided by her wishes, and would feel no moie inclined to make the matter public, and as it would mciely agitate the baronet, and induce him to conjure up a thousand fears for his favou¬ nte s futuie safetv, thej agreed not to mention tlie circumstance before him, and soon after separated for tlie night, when Anna returned her devout thanks where they weie most due, for having escaped the journey to Winchester, whieli must have given publicity to her sort of elope¬ ment.
The colonel, who was too good himself to suspect others of evil, saw no mystery in liis daughter's note, merely rejoicing Mrs. Nelson was spared; and tlie mo¬ ment be was up, in compliance with his darling Annn'S'wishes, he rode to the Ab¬ bey, »nd found lady Charleville and his daughter, who had been still morc dili- gent, anxiously expecting him. The ba¬ ronet liad of late always breakfasted in bed ; therefore tlie moment the serrants were dismissed, Anna briefly, and with many ludicrous comments, related tlie oc¬ currences of the evening, giving great point to the postillion's flaming declara¬ tions, and winding up her tale with a burlesque description of the overturn, and her subsequent escape from her titled swain. " I never heard of so absurd a scheme," cried the angry colonel. " Mad I the fel¬ low seems more rogue than fool—but he shall pay pretty dearly for his freak; and I think I shall discover who he ist not lord Dundee, I feel convinced—he does not seem to have either life or spirit enough
to conceive such a wild plan; and whoever it was, they could not have either hoped or expected to threaten you into marriage ; therefore what the wretch had in view Heaven knows. But I will fathom bis meaning ere I am many days older, and hold him up to the contempt hedeserves." Having suffered him to exhale his first very natural burst of rege, lady Charleville calmly reminded him that this impassion¬ ed lover had certainly paid very dearly for his folly, and must have been proportion- ably disappointed; as to what he could have had in view, save matrimony, she could not divhie—that seemed to be the goal of all his wiehesi and perliaps he would be more punished were he suffered to escape unnoticed, than were his absurdities to be made public; hinting Anna's wish, and giving additional strength to her reasons for wishing no notice might be taken of his jejune attempt at personating α knight- errant of former days, or rather one of those wicked magicians who hoped to ob¬ tain the love of beautiful damsels by car-
rying them off in fiery cars, or mounting tliem behind them upon serpents' Anna warmly seconded her patroness, declanng she could not bear the idea of having her name coupled w ith that of such a romantic fool, who had evidently hoped she was as weak as himself, and that slie would be dazzled by а coronet, which she now really believed he had to offer, as tliere was a coronet engraved upon the limp Turner had picked up. In short, she reasoned so ttell, and so ablj, and had, as the colonel agreed so much tlie best of the argument, that after some objections, which the ladies overruled, lie agreed to be guided by their superior judgment and to till Ins servants that Ins daughter bad been drawn from home bj a fieakof liercousins Having thus acceded to their wishes he trusted tliey would not objict to lus pnvately endeavouring to discovci who his would oe son in law was 1 ho lamp vv as certainly presumptive proof of lus being a man of conocquence if be w as lord Dundee, lie should advise his fa- voi iv с
ther to place hım in a state of coeicion, since engaged as he was, he could not re¬ ti act vv ith honour He was going to Lon¬ don to see Selby, respecte ι g the sale of Moniingthorpe s northern estate, andhe hoped, by dint of α little bribery, he should at least be able to learn whether lord Dun¬ dee had acted so absurdly as to making any inquiries at the Dolphin, which had once come across lum, that would be use less since, had the master been in the lovers confidence, there could have been no need of the pointed canvas but he might contuve to leain whether any sus¬ picions respecting the overturn bad got abroad He must also put 1 lua Tit/mau- nce rather into their confidence, as the prank was to be saddled upon her brother, perfectly agreeing with lady Chaileville and his daughter m keeping sir Herbert in ignorance of the strange occurrence, and as he w as all impatience to ltarn whe¬ ther anything had transpired at South¬ ampton, he soon departed, promising un¬ asked as he said to dme at the Abbey He first returned home, wlure be meie-
ly told lus ovvn man that his daughter had betn inveigled from home under a false pretence, u hopes she would Înv e joined a very gay party going to Winchester but having discovered the echeme, she had refused to proceed, riot choosing to leav t the Abbey whde sir Herbert was so un well The valet made no doubt of his master relating facts, therefore merely observed, lie was very glad tliere was no trutii m the report of Mrs Nelson's illness, but made no further remarks To Eliza Fitzmauricc her uncle stated the real frutti She never heard of so ex¬ traordinary an adventure like Anna, slie conceived the man was deranged pro mising never to mention the circumstance without Ins or her cousins permission, md readily agreeing to second his wish to discov er who this half madman vas, vvlnth might transpire w hen least expected and detlaung her untie had done very nght m making use of her brothers name, w hich ».lie should not scruple to do, if required, с a
but as the less was said the better, she as¬ suied the colonel she would never agam revert to the subject, hoping she should soon see her cousin, as she longed to hear her account of this modern Quixote From his niece s, the colonel went to the house where lord Dundee had lodged, who vv as if he might believe the landlord, in London, having merely come down to shew himself to the regiment, being upon the point of maniage Our colonel next w ent to the most fre¬ quented pi ices of fashionable resort, where he was known, and where he met most of the officers at Southampton, but not a hint dropped to le id lum to supjiose the kmd of elopement was ev en suspected Lord Dundee s being in London was confirmed by several of bis brother officers, one of whom had heard from him that very morn¬ ing, and he supposed his next letter would announce his marriage, as every prepara¬ tion w as made, mentioning wliere the bride and bridegroom were to spend the honey¬ moon, and entering into so many minute particulars, that the colonel was convinced
the viscount bad not assumed the disguise of a postillion, nor could he learn that any other young nobleman, at all likely to have been the hero of the romance, was m he neighbourhood, no joung men of any degiee were reported missing, m short, whoevci w as the pi incipal actor in the farce, he did not, as he told ladv Charleville and his diughter, appear to hav e put any one in lus confidence Again asking hci, having seized an op poitumty to diaw her onone side, whether she was sure be ıeally was а joung man' —·" So he appeared, sir, and jou must havt remarked he was veiy active, but he was so disguised, that were I required, I am sure I could not sweai to bis peison " No more could I," rejoined the colo¬ nel " that he was perfectly acquainted with your story, he gave us proofs by men¬ tioning Walton, and he seemed to know Mrs Nelson, yet it should appear he dropped from tbe moon—altogether it is passing strange " This was Saturday, and on the Monday

acquaintance, and none with whom he was not equally intimite, therefore he could not suspect nny one whom he had ever seen at the Abbey, nor even did he believe that any of those he had ever heard mentioned there could be at all concerned in so strange a plot j et among the baro nets connexions (for thev were bncly rel ited) he feared the pi in had origin iteti though what benefit flic e ul of Vv ailing ford (as upon him Ins suspicions rested) could hope to denve from cither of lus sons marrying Ins daughter, if such was to have been the ciinnittion of the 10 mantie exploit he could not loniuve ex cept he supposed she would uilient the Abbey I rim the vdets account, md what he b id fintini gleuied from ¡iidgt Selby and colonel Hertloid, lie vvas mueh moie au fait of the eail s ch meter than lie chose to appear to the Clini lev dies and he hi mly believed that where w omen or his ovvn giatihcatum weie at ill concei ned, lie was never dttened by fear of conse quencos from mj puisuit lie might, as he truly guessed, think his tl m 0 htera dan-

his brother, who hud sought a retreat with tlie earl m Dorse'shne, who he ftlt ton¬ vmccd had been the pinne mover of the scheme This he told Selby when tbey met, who did not exactly coincide vv itli hım, ns he assured hım, if riport was to be believed, the earl was far from being upon good tei ms with either of Ins sons, neitlnr of whom were now in Dorsetshire as he knew lord Danvers was in Ireland, and be hud learnt by mere ci ance tint the reve¬ rend Mr 1) mv ers had officiated for а friend at Windsor on the preceding bun- day " Then this viulcnt lover of my daugh- tu s must have been Л umber Nip or Ins Wi adlı, since I am convinced the postil¬ lion was not the eail himself, and after vv bat you have advanced, I am inclined to think I was wrong in my suspicions—nt least thcic is as much to be said on one side as on the other, so we will leave the matter at rest till chance furnishes me with some better clue than I have hitherto stum bled upon "
Tliey next discussed Momingtlrorpe's affairs, the colonel rejoicing to hear his est ite li id sold remarkably well and as the funds wore vcrj low, he had made a considerable addition to his income Selhynext reverted to Ins approaching mumngp, requesting the coloriti would dine vvitli Ins fither the next tlav, vv ben he would introduce him to his bndt elect, acknowledging she и as not so handsome ns Miss riUmannee, still she was a fine young woman and he felt conv ineod that she would render him v erv happj The colonel was leisonmg very judi¬ ciously upon matrmionv, declaring that good temper was the most necessary quali fication to constitute feluitv, when Sel by's clerk rushed m —' (»rest news from Spain, sir' here is tht 1 xtnordmarv Ga¬ zette—the news has not been in town three hours " Both gentlemen were equally eager to peruse the gratifying intelligence, while the clerk (who, like every Ь nghsliman, shared m their joj) was talking of illumi¬ nations, and dtclinng tlut the people

We spare our readers all minute details respecting general or even partial actions, suffice it to say, that besides havmg so ma¬ terially contributed to the general success in the first instance, he no less distin¬ guished himself dunng the succeeding en¬ gagement, and had also, when in pursuit of the enemy, rescued a Spanish grmdee and Ins daughters fiom the hands of the French, who had, in defiance ofthe gene¬ ral rules of war, made them pnsoneis, not withstanding they were provided with propei passports, and were merely trav el¬ ling upon 1 muly business, unconnected with the politics of their countiy Colonel Fitzmaunce was at once drawn from all thoughts of self, he congratulated Selby, who he deci ned should sup with him, that they might drink the brave Wellington, and their minor hero, as he styled Mormngthorpe, in bumpers Selby, who really participated in his feelings, made no objection, and as Lon¬ don was equally intoxicated with joy, and the populace evinced their loyalty by pa¬ rading the streets, they did not sepaiate
till morning bud long taken the place of night and the cotoiul had h irdly break fustcd, when Sclbv s cluk stopped in a coath at the door of the hotel, and soon entered his apartment, with a box and α packet from Moiningtliorpe, which had been consigned to the caie of his master, and had betn brought to Lngland by the cornier who bad immediately lotion cd the officer who bid brought the commander in chiefs dispatches Having made the derk a suitable and very acceptable acknowledgment for his trouble, and promised, m answer to his message from Ins muster, to be in ı cadiness when he called to take lnm to the judges, he hastily broke the seal of Ins friends lettel, and read as follows — " vi\ nr ar sut, " Our heroic commander has so fullj detailtd our recent successes, that I shall refer you to his dispatches for every paıtıculaı and, as the Gazette will have iiifoiined jou, I have escaped with а mere contusion from а spent ball, so tnfling that

Never had colonel ritzmaunce been so much gratified to have had Mormng¬ thorpe merely illude to his daughter w ould have been very phasing, but to hear her thus distinguished by the man of all others w hom he wished her to marry, far exceeded Ins most sanguine hopes He hastily opened the box the floraers so slightly mentioned were two diamond sprigs of great value, the one a very good imitatie ι of a branch of heart'sease, ot for¬ get me not, in apjïropnate coloured jewels, the othei a branch of the pomegranate
flower, so peculiar to Spain, in rubies of tlie finest water, the leaves, as in the other, emeralds, to whicli Mormngthorpe had added some very thoice productions of the Spanish loom, which the colonel resolved to present to lady Chaileville Sitting down, w hue his heart overflow ed with gratitude, to address his son, as he now openly styled his hero, and after offer¬ ing his congratulations upon Ins recent successes and fortunate escape, he assured lum that Anna should add a postscript to lus next lettel he then dttailtd her ic ceut adventure, vvlutli he assuied lnm was a proof that he tonsiller«! him as his son, acknowledging whcie his suspicions had pointed, and concluding by wishing lie might live to see the olive entwined with the laurels of the Bntisli To Selby he proudly displayed lus daughter s presents, who agreed they were most elegant, gady adding—" '1 be colonel seems indeed to aspire to the title of youi son " V/hy, to be very candid with you, fvclby, could I select a husband for my
Anna, be would be the man but these jewels are mere proofs of his regard for me, since Mornuigthorpe lias none of tlie romance of love in his disposition—his pre¬ sent mistress is glory should peace be once more restored to the world, he may think of mairymg but ere then Anna may have made another choice ' Selby did not pursue the subject, or he could have told Fitzmaunce that Morn¬ ingthoi pe hud appe ired very cunous re¬ specting his daughter, dunng the few hours he bad spent in bis company, Inv mg often revei ted to her with a degree ot ap purent inteiest, which, considering how fully his mind was engrossed, had lather surpiised the young lawyer 'lhejudee received colonel ritzmaunce as a much valued fritnd, and he thought the lady whom be had been invited to meet very pleasmg, very elegart, and very unaffected Selby was giatified by lus judicious eulogiums, and as Fitzmau¬ rice was very anxious to return into Hamp slure, he soon dispatched lus own business, which was merely relative to his daugh-
ter's late succession, as she bad request¬ ed he would manage all her money mat¬ ters; be therefore reached the Abbey at thejr usual dinner.bour, on the fifth day after he had left home. Sir Herbert was much tbe same, but very happy to see him, as was lady Charle¬ ville; wbile Anna, whose tearful eyes be¬ spoke ber sincere regard for him, declared he was better than good, as she had not expected him so soon by α week. As sir Herbert was to be kept in ¡gno- ranee of bis daughter's little romance, he did not touch upon that theme; but diiring dinner he gave them his opinion of Selby's choice, and when they adjourned to the saloon, he produced Morningthorpe's let¬ ter and presents. Sir Herbert was mueh pleased by the unaffected language of the young colonel, whom he pronounced to be a real hero, and perfectly unconscious of bis own superlative merit, to make use of a word о' his own. Lady Charleville thought him quite a pieux chevalier, and told Anna, she made no doubt that were tournaments in fashion,
be would declare himself her knight, and wear her colours, the jewels she thought beautiful, observing, they were very sig¬ nificant, if properly understood, since tbe one was а request to be allowed а place in her recollection—" forget me not," the other was a proof of his devotion to her charms " Winch he has never seen,' rejoined the laughing Anna " Now I conceive the Spanish ladies meant to convey their sen¬ timents to lnm by these presents, there¬ fore, much as I feel obliged by the trans¬ fer, does it not rather impeach his gallan¬ try' According to the laws of romance and of knight errantly, he ought to have fallen desperately in love with one of these fair Iberians—the other might have been lealous of her sister—the hidalgo might have refused his consent -----' " A very pretty romance you are spin¬ ning, Miss Saucebox" interrupted the amused colonel " but my hero is an Eng¬ lishman, and you ought to be very grate¬ ful for hio notice " voi rv η ,
" I assure jou I am, mydear sn, since to j ou I am solely indebted foi it, und I almost partiupate in your impatience to see your hero The silks and handkerchiefs were no less admired, and both ladj Chaileville and Miss I ltzmaunce readily agreed to ■suite thur thinks to the donor When alone with the ladies, Fitzinaunie told them he had made no discoveries respect¬ ing cither carnage or lover, but he still hoped chance vv ould unravel the strange mystery
CHAPTER IV
During the ensuing month, Miss Mar¬ gram was united to Mr Courtney, upon whom sir Herbert bestowed the living of Channg, os a wedding gift, though while tbe doctor lived be was to continue the nominal rector, but as his complaint was pronounced to be water on Ins chest, his
dissolution was hourly expected, which prevented any festivities from taking place in consequence of his daughter s marnage, nor did he survive that event more than a month, when he sunk into eternity with- out a struggle Sclby, though hardly out of tlie honej moon himself, came down tlie moment he received Mis Margram s summons, as he was one ofthe doctors executors, and it was immediately agreed that the vv idow and her unmained daughter should re¬ move into the villa, once Mr Hoskuiss great boast, and that Elm Grove should be either sold or let, which it was almost immediately, to a London gentleman, a widower, with one son and daughter, who gave the neighbouihood to understand that he meant to live quite retired The son vv as abroad with the army, the daugh¬ ter and her governess (vvho it was soon whispered merely bore that title as a blind to her real situation in the family) only ac compamed him down, and as he took all the forniture at a fair valuation, he was in- DS
stalled in his new residence very early in the spi mg 'lhe rumours m circulation would bave prevented the ladies from being received at the Abbey, had sir Herbert been better able to do the honours, nor did they seem anxious to make any ac¬ quaintance, which the colonel thought very w ise, as it might spare them many morti¬ fications Selby never came to Channg without visiting the Abbey he had made sir Her¬ bert s will, and had also been appointed one of his executors and every legal means had been taken to prevent the eail ot ι Wallingford from making any claims To the young lawyer, the baronet some times permitted himself to ι egret that he had not selected his favourite Anna, add ing—" She will prove a treasuie to any man of sense, and of α domestic tuin of mind her warm hearted father wishes her to marry his favourite Momrngthorpe, who may, nay certainly is, a very brave offner but a camp is a bad school for mo¬ rals, and a man accustomed to command, and to implicit obedience, does not always
muke either a good or a kind husband Anna ıs hke о sensitive plant, she w ill shrink from all notoriety, therefore I could have wished she had married sofe less public character, nnd that I had lived to see her settled in life " Selby spoke very highly of Morning- thorpe's general eharaetei, whose humanity and feeling weie fully equal to bis brav ery, observing, that it was more than pro¬ bable he would select afwife abroad, and to lum he had never-lncntioned Miss Fit¿- mauuee but as tbe daughter of his fnend, and as he had nev er seen her, he thought there was very little chance of their ever being united—wishing to set the baro¬ net's mind at ease, who had resolved to render his favounte a match for the first men in the kingdom Having some papers and deeds to look over with Mr Andrews, and some leases to prepare, Selby slept one night at the Abbey ishing, as he said, to expedite matters The colonel came to breakfast, at which Mr Andrews joined them, and after the usual inquiries, he thus proceeded
—" I am very glad you are here, Mr Sel¬ by, as j ou сап advise me how to proceed in a very unjileasant affair, whith I donot like to mention to sir Herbert, except yon think it necessary, her ladyship and the colonel art fully competent to judge ofthe business I should suppose The fact is, the manor has of late been very mueh infested with poother«. Sir Heibert is not so strict respecting lus pieserves as some gentle¬ men, but th it is no excuse for these tress¬ passers upon his property Hitherto the gamekeeper has been unable to discover who were the depredators last night lie was, as usual, upon the look oat, when he perceived tv»o men adv ancing tow ards a cover, where he knew tliere was game, but as they were armed with heav у bludgeons, and might have fire arms concealed, he re- mnned pet due till they had proceeded to some distance, when not choosmg to pursue them unarmed and alone, he nn to my house, w Inch was at no great distance, and called up several of my men, 11 ith whom he cautiously follow ed the supposed poachers footsteps, having, like his com
rainons, armed himself with a good cud gel, and as they were now two to one, thej agieed itwould be hard it thcv did not secure them, admitting they fell in with them nul m the vuj copse towaids which lit hid seen them making thcv dis¬ covei ed them, through the meal s of ι sm ill 1 milioni, of w hieb thev now and then caught a glimpse as thtj wucbcit nig among the bushes and having eviry reason to sujipose they had met with n pnze, the gimekecpcr gave the signal, and thty all insiliti upon thtm A ftw blows vv ere exelunged but the culputs stnlking rase ils as they are were soon ovcrpovv tied when who should thcv jnovetobe but Mi Cummings and litutcnuit Irogmore disguised in waggonci s fioeks' Ihcy bail acoujileof lines in а bag, which had been snared, and а sm dl di agnet for birds \\ hen taken, they pleaded b u d for meicy, requesting to be liber ittd, promising gieat bribes, though they had no money about them 'lhe gamekeepei turned a deaf ear to thur petitions, ltadmg them to my house, when I was called up to assist lum
with my advice I desired the gentlemen, though they are α disgrace to the name, might be detained m custodv till morning, when I would let sir Herbert know what had occurred, and leave it to him to prose- tute or to liberate them ' Poor vv retches r cned her ladyship, ' povcrtj must have led to thur thus committing themsilvcs but as sn Herbert entertains а very b id opinion of both of them, I think he ought to decide w hethe the law is to take its course he will lean to mercy, I feel assured As the cotonel and Selby agreed with her, the baronet wasmadeacquaintedvvith the encumstance, which rather amused than vexed him, declaring the misguided wretches were already sufficiently punish¬ ed Cummings he considered as a rogue in gram, and perhaps he ought not to let him escape, but, upon tlie verge of the grave, he could not consent to prosecute The lieutenant was the most to blame, as he had a sort of character to lose, and bore the king's commission, which he must for¬ feit, were he to proceed to extremities.
Unfortunately for them, their depredations would be pretty generally known, there¬ fore he thought they were and would be sufficiently punished—appealing to the party present " Perhaps were justice to be stnctly at¬ tended to, they ought to be held up us a public example, said the colonel " but I can never make my feelings keep pace with my duty towards the community; so let us hope your mercy may work a re¬ form m their morals. Tins Selby much doubted, but he agreed the publicity of their disgrace would an¬ svv er all the ends of a prosecution So thought Andrews, who wished they might be spared any farther punishment, unce if tliey had any shame they must re¬ move their quarters, taking his leave, with orders to amply reward the game¬ keeper and his assistants, and to return the latter sir Herbert and lady Charleville s thanks for Ins diligence the pnsoners he was to liberate ' Only advise them to take timely wam» 1)3

less husband Was taken in the very act of destroying sir Herbert's game last night " " I am sorry to say you have only heard the truth, but it may afford you some consolation to know, that out of respect to you, sir Herbert does not mean to prose¬ cute " " '1 hen more is the pity, my lady, though I feel very grateful for sir Herbert s for¬ bearance, but I really was in hopes both the rogues would have been transported, since then I might have kept out of a workhouse, as it is, nun stares me in the face, since by telling me the most abomi¬ nable lies, and by deceiving me m the grossest m inner, he has wheedled me out of almost every thing which had been se¬ cured to me when we married. Forty pounds α -year, which is а mere annuity tor life, but that he cannot touch, is all that remains of my once ample fortune " " I can say nothing in his defence, pro¬ bably he will leave the country, and then I may be able to advise you how to pro¬ ceed, be assured you shall never want, and you must oblige me by accepting this trifle
for present use," giving her a twentyf- pound note Airs Cummings sobbed tier thanks, de daring she would be legally separated from the wretch, inquiring when and how he had been taken ? Lady Charlev ille satisfied her, and she in return told her ladj ship, that for the last two months they had frequently lived upon game, which Cummings told ber hud been given him by sir Herbert s game¬ keeper, to whom he had made himself useful, and that lieutenant l· rogmore was then· general guest, whom she had felt con vinced had entered mto some profitable but illicit traffic with her husband, who had more than once d — d her for a vain old fool, when she had questioned hun upon the subject, theiefoie she should not be at all surprised to hear the friends went on from bad to worse, till they came to the gallows Lady Charleville hoped sir Herberts lenity would work a salutary reform in their conduct, feeling rather relieved when Mrs Cummings departed, to relate
Jier misfortunes to Mrs Nelson, not choos¬ ing to aflord the Hoskuises the triumph of hearing how nearly she was reduced to their level The worthy woman to whom she lamented hci hard fate had too much genuine feeling to rev trt to her folly, merely advising her to consult vv ith Mr. Silbj, or some othei law j er, how best to retain possession ot hu house m Chai mg, and her small minuit v, sinte a husband hid great power, nnd she could not shut her doors against Mr Cummings, except a legal sepaiatmn took place Not fetling inclined to return home, she readily accepted Mrs Nelson's imitation to dinner, and when she did depart, she commissioned her to consult with Mr An¬ drew s, as she felt very much at a loss how to proceed When she leached hi r ovvn house, she leaint from htr now only ser¬ vant, a pansh gnl, that Mr Cummings had come home soon aftei she went out, when having hastily packed up two trunks, he had departed in a chaise with lieutenant Frogmore, who had called for bun, leaving

I inclose you a two- pound note, as you will not receive yonr annuity these six weeks, and remain yours, " John Cummings." Mrs. Ctimmings's rage may be conceived, but cannot be described, and probably she would have fretted herself ill, had not Mr. Andrews, in sir Herbert's name, repur¬ chased part of her furniture, vvith which he fitted up the cottage farm which Ken- net had just vacated, and which the baro¬ net bad bought, and thither she retired with her girl, and a man who was to ma¬ nage her land, wliich would enable her to enjoy a few comforts; and that Cummings
might be unable to distress her, she was merely favoured with the loan of the fur¬ niture and farming stoclf, and allowed to live rent-free for the present The Hoskinses grumbled at the favour shewn her tliey had been placed m а com¬ parative almshouse, and yet he had nev er robbed the baronet, but as most people thought Mrs Cummings had paid veiy dearly for her follv. sir Herbert ind 1 idy Charleville were much applauded for their chanty towards her Colonel Momrngthorpe wrote by eveiy opportunitj —that is,vvhcncverlus militai j duties illow ed hım the leisure, to his adopted father, he bad received lady Charleville s and Annas letters, and had answered them in the stile of a pieux che- Valıcı '1 he ladies only regretted be ap¬ peared to write so fast, his epistles were scarcely legible, as they were very amus¬ ing He infoimed Anns, that, thanks to the gratitude of his Spanish fuend, he had been honoured by one of the first orders of knighthood w Inch could be bestowed upon a foreigner, therefore be might now

seeds of discord between her and sir Her¬ bert, and whom she conceived she could inveì forgive having removed his son, theiefore, as such α man who ceitainly was ' the legal heir to the estates, might go any ltngtlis to invalid ite ber tlauns, she was resolved to be wholly guided by Selby s ltg il knowledge Colonel Fit/maunce was happy she had sent foi Ins young fnend—tliere might be forms and ceremomts to be observed, of w huh he w as not so well aw are he there¬ fore contented himself bj expressing his sincere regiet for the loss of his best ind eailnst fuend to Momrngthorpe, de¬ tlaung th it he only could replace him in bis regard, as he had been to lnm what he himself had been to the late sir Herbert, bis early pioiige only the baronet never derived equal honour and gratification from the connexion descanting with great feelmg upon lady Charleville s exemplary conduct, and declaring that he much doubted being himself more sincerely la¬ mented by Anna While he was thus givuigvent to his

of Ins having some one m pnj in the neigh¬ bourhood, else he could not have with¬ draw n her son She bad never beard of the Southampton widow, Fit/inaunce never having mentioned her connexion with the earl, having always been fearful of lovvei mg lum in sir Herbert's esteem, or ot having his reports misinterpreted into a wish to benefit by lus folhes still various circumstances had induced lady Charleville to suppose that lord Wallingford bad his spies, utber in oi near the Abbej , his anonymous letters were proof suflicient, tliough she Ind not ev en suspet ted he wa conçu ned in Annas strange adventure, wlucli continui d as much clouded in mjs- tcry as berett fore Selbj ansvv ercd her ladj ship s express in peison, much to her satisfaction, and was immediately ushered into her bondou, where he instantly quieted 1 и atoned fears, by assuring her that the mere legal claims of the earl could never lead him to the extremities she appeared to dicad | Had the baronet died abroad, unmarried j and supposed intestate, he might have felt
authorized to have asserted his very vague daims, which all rested upon there being no will, therefore,as there was such a deed, duly executed, and which he defied the ablest lawyer in Gieat Butam to set aside, she could have nothing to fear Indeed, independent of his being а sort of general lover, he bad ncvei heard bis character im¬ peached report, upon which no depend¬ ence ought to be placed, said he liad not been а good husband, and he believed his children did not consider lum as a very af¬ fectionate falhei , but perhaps all these do¬ mestic feuds arose from the countess s for¬ tune hav ing been setured to herself and children, so he had heard Ins lordship de¬ fended, who was certainly a very brave officer, and, he had always heard, very ho¬ nourable in lus dealings, though perhaps rather imprudent, and be might have wished to have been sir Herbert's heir, but be would be answerable for his pot committing himself, or displaying his dis¬ appointment by any act of impradeiice like those she dreaded, he might feel mor-
titled, but be would not make any attempt to set aside the will Feeling reassured, her ladyship made no objection to hearing it read m presence of the colonel and his daughter, to whom she desired Selby not to mention her silly fiars Our lawyer promised obedience, and then proceeded to business and we shall merely give the heads of the will His linded property, including the Abbey, furnished as it stood, &С.&С. the baronet bequeathed, without any restriction, to lady Charleville, and Mr Andrews told her ladyship that the rent-roll exceeded lourteen thousand a year he also left her, equ illy at her own disposal, funded pro¬ perty to the amount of six thousand a- vcar To colonel Fitzmaunce, he left fifty thousand pounds India stock—a si¬ milar sum to Ins daughter, to whom he expressed himself greatly indebted, and whom he considered os his adopted child, ten thousand pounds to support the va nous tliantable institutions which he had voj iv ρ
founded, and half the sum to George Sel by, as a token of his esteem all the old servants were very liberally provided foi, and Selby was constituted residuary lega tee, and joint trustee with colonel Fitzmnu nee, to the funds for chantable purposes '1 he widow was at full liberty to dispose of the house and estates, indeed sir Hei bert had hinted to her before he died, that he w ished her to be wholly guided by her own convenience, and her own feehngs, conceiving she would find the Abbey a very dull residence and he also thought by selling it, she would effectually prevent my disputes at her demise none could anse at present his will was so well and so cautiously worded No mention was made of lord Wallingford, except to negative his tlauns, as the law prescribed, and every partitular was drawn up with a legal skill and prensión, that while it denoted the masterly hand of judge Selby, also evinced the distrust and resentment the baronet lelt towards his heir at-law Lady Charleville could only regret hei son had not been spared to benefit by sir
Herbert's noble bequest hod he lived, the barontt had promised her to make him his heir, his generosity towards herself there- fere renewed her gnef for his early death, and made her fancy she hated lord Wal¬ lingford But as these were her pnvate re. flections, the colonel felt happy she was so amply provided for, and very grateful for tlie munificence displayed towards his daughter and himself, though he could have wished, he told Selby, when they vv ere ltft tùie à tête, the baronet had not sufftred his dishke of lord Wallmgford to appeal m Ins will, since alter all he could not discover that he had evei injured lum, md indeed, how should he ever have liad it in Ins pow ei ? ' That sir Heibeit moie than disliked the earl, 1 bav e long know n, ' replied Sel¬ bj, " and I leally believe he suspected it was him who worked upon the feelings of my eaily and lamented friend, and induced lum to undertake the v oyage w Inch proved fatal to him, he never came directly to the point even to iny father, but I know Ľ 2
he has thrown out bints to both him and Dr Margram, to that effect" " Then indeed his great precautions aie fully accounted for if he was right m tus conjectures, the earl must have been ac¬ tuated by jealousy towards Pembroke, of whom Anna still speaks with rapture, and if he did remove him, I cannot belp think¬ ing he meant to be equally kind .to my daughter, he certainly was at the bottom of that very mystenous business " " Surely, colonel, you will not adopt the baronet's prejudices, since I give you my honour I always considered them as such Had Pembroke been a common eharaetei, the earl might have worked upon his feel¬ ings, perliaps with success, but I feel as¬ sured he was not the dupe of any blan¬ dishments be could exert No, there was a mystery attending his departure which I could never fathom, but I never be¬ lieved lord Wallingford was at all imph cated in the business I rather flunk he acted under the influence of some near re lation, who chose he should leave England But this is merely arguing for argument s
soke, therefore let us revert to the present ;" mentioning some necessary arrangements respecting the funeral, which was suitable to the rank of the deceased, and expressive of the respect his widow paid his memory. Selby returned to town as soon as it was over, having duly performed eveiy port of his trust. Anna continued with the wi¬ dow, and the colonel, as heretofore, was а daily visitor, generally reading them bis letters from Spain, porticularly the one in answer to his announcing sir Herbert's death, as it evinced а degree of feeling and revsrsnee for the memory of the deceased highly gratifying to the trio. Colonel Fitzmaurice liad also the gratificiition of hearing and knowing that his hero was generally respected and esteemed, as he understood bis glorious commander had said, speaking of him, " that be was an honour to his profession ; he had marked him in the field of battle, and had seen his arm lifted against tbe enemies of Britain, when hia dauntless intrepidity had inspired even timidity with emulation:" nor did he display less humanity even towards bis
enemies; therefore our colonel had been heard to affirm, " that had he been a de¬ scendant of Julius Cæsar, neither his pub¬ lic nor his private actions would have dis¬ graced his ancestor."
CHAPTER VI.
During the first three months of her wi¬ dowhood, lady Charleville more than once resolved to make a wiB; but then she re¬ collected that she had rather Anna should marry before she made а »Inal arrangement respecting her property. As every entail had' beeh cut off, she presumed that the earl of Wallingford could make no claim, admitting she died intestate; but tben, in whom would the property centre? Such n mystery bail been made of her family and connexions, that even admitting she had any relations, they would not be able to assert their claims; therefore she ought not to delay her arrangements for the future.
She vvas in her fifty second year, though time bad laid so very gentle а finger upon liei and she had lived so regulara life, tlut she looked ten years younger *than she leally was perhaps the extreme piopnety of her diess aided the deception Бе that as it may, the colonel thought it л ery pos sible she would make а second choice, as he strongly suspected esteem, not love, had united her to sir Heibert Lady Charleville liad no thoughts of a second marriage, merely feeling undecided whether to constitute Anna ritzmaunce or lord Wallingford s children her heirs she therefore resolved not to hurry herself respecting this impoitant business, and to be finally guided by circumstances Lord Wallingford had iiad due notice of the baronet s demise, and hod perused his will as soon as it was proved he had heard the general contents before and felt ν ery happy at such unlimited power being placed in tlie widow s bands, since, had she been fettered with any restrictions, slie would have been a much less desirable pnze As a preliminary step, the earl paid
Selby on early visit, merely, as he said, to inquire, being heir at late, into the parti¬ culars of sir Herbert s will hemighthave gone to the Commons, or have sent his man of business but he conceived it more polite to address himself at once to him (Selby), as his choracter stood so high in the public estimation, he had eagerly sought the opportunity of makmg his ac quaintance Selby, as he hoped and expected, felt flattered by his visit, and charmed by his affability, and entered into every necessary detail respecting the late baronet's affairs Tbe earl declared he could not have made a more equitable disposition of bis large property He w as certainly not in want of such an inheritance, tbough per¬ haps be might have expected it to bave been secured to bu family at the widow's demise but the deceased bad taken a se¬ rious dislike to him, he had early discovered, merely, be believed, in consequence úf their relative situations it w«s a foible inherent in human nature to distrust, if not to dis like, the legal successor, few monarches
felt very cordial towards the heir-apparent, and human nature was the same in every station His (the earls) children were amply provided for, and his own estates amply sufficed for Ins wants, be was therefore merely sorry the baronet had suffei ed his mistaken prejudices to creep into his will asking various questions re spectmg the widow, and appearing grati fied by Selby s replies, desinng he vv ould assure her that he felt much consoled bj being superseded in the baronet s estates by so very near a connexion, as he should have been senously mortified had they fall en to the share of a eompaiative stranger nay, he might n that case have been tempted to dispute the w ill, since, though affection might have dictated the present deed, he should have attributed any other disposal of his effects to capuce, if not to dotage carelessly inquiring whether Miss Tit/maur ее had a declared lover ' Selbj pitdded ignorance, but spoke ofher as she deserved and he w as no less sincere m his praises of the widow, in whicn bu e3
loidship warmly joined, nssunnghim that he both esteemed and respected her, and lequesting tint he would mention his visit when he wrote and assure her that no one felt more interested m her future welfare Selby lost no time in setting her lady ship s mind at ease, greatly assisting the earrs plans in embryo by the praises he bestowed upon him declanng that what ever might be Ins foibles, he appeared to possess in excellent heart, and to be mudi interested in her w ell doing I ady Charleville w as much gratified by this involuntary tribute of ber fonner ft vourite s regard, and even to herself slie endeavoured to extenuate what she could not attribute to any wish to promote her happiness Her piesent solitude was very favourable to his cause as it frequently brought lura to her recollection, such as he was dunng their early acquaintance, and such as she supposed him now to be, a reformed man who wished to make her tvery amends for his past persecutions, which vanity (.though she was hardly aw are
of such a lurking foible) taught her to fancy did not originate in indifference, yet she could not forgive his removal of his son, till she recollected that it would have been a most difficult and very un¬ pleasant task to have secured lum sir Her beits estate, and felt inclined to blame herself for not having brought lum up in greater obscurity, as she found from his journal that he shrunk from the illegiti¬ macy of his ongm with all the pnde of bis father '1 hus did she condemn and acquit the e iri ten times in a day—sometimes tiansfeiring his errois to Ins son, some¬ times to untoward cncumstiinces, and at others, using, like a phœnix, to her former strength of mind, eneivated and blunted by continued prosperity, she felt that she cordially despised him, and fancied that lit had some end in view by bis apparent ci vihty Her absence of mind and frequent si lence were perfectly accounted lor by the colonel and his daughter, who attributad to tender reminiscences of sir Herbert,
what Was, in fact, the same feelings towards a much less deserving object. Time glided on, as six months soon elapsed, and Anna, not choosing to appear particular, left off her mourning. Her cou¬ sin Eliza had accepted lady Charleville's invitation, and was spending six weeks with them, her ladyship having promiseâ to spare Anna for the same term ^uring the autumn, whom she now regretted had not married Selby, since the retired life she bad led ftom her first being received at the Abbey had prevented her from seeing any other young men of a suitable rank in society; she might now be deemed а rieb heiress, and it was time she saw something of the world ; when her mourn¬ ing expired, she would take ber to London for a few months, and the tour of Eng¬ land. As to the colonel's romantic expec¬ tations respecting Moniingthorpe, she saw no probability of their being realized: gratitude appeared to render this said hero very polite towards Anna—but the sending her jewels, for which he could have no use, was not making ber an offer
of his hand he might form other connex¬ ions, or he might, rich as he was, and likely to obtain many honours, look much higher for a wife she therefore never made him the subject of her discourse when talking to Anna—indeed they seldom dis cussed what both conceived w as at present very uncertain, namely, the j oung ladj s future prospects Colonel ritzmaunce wished to paj every attention to the widow, but had, like her, resolved his daughter should see something of the world he thought it by no means improbable lady Charleville w ould marry again as she w as still a very fine woman, w as known to be immensely neh, and w as certainly a most agreeable companion thongh she no longer made a display of her musical talents, she could still enchant her hearers by her perfoi mimce on the piano Sir Herbert had laid her under no nn pleasant restrictions, having even half wished she might, in good truth, become the mothei of his darling Anna, but rr uch as she esteemed and regarded the cobi el
lady Charleville would never have made hmi lus successor since, though acı ustom- ed ro Ins countenance, she would not have liked to have appeared with lnm in public as his wife perhaps she laid too much stress upon face and figure, but she felt she could never unite beiseli to deformity this she had delicately given the colonel to undeistand bv hinting to hl n that Momrngthorpe might lie far from hand some when be returned from Ins campaign, therefore Anna might not fed intimul to consider lnm in any other light tb m th it of his fnend Colonel Fitzmaunce was much ti о sen sible to feel hurt at any allusion to his own misfoi tums often declaring that had Smol lett bun lus cotemporary be should b ive thought he bud lnm in view when be diew Iisma/ago gaily aiknowled 0 ing that а black patch instead of а but eje uıı^ht cloud any fan lady s ımagm ition ind ifitc tually stifle her love Anna, whoidoh/ed her fathti, had long ceased either to observe or to ltmnk his disfigured coiintenanct—she could read his

" I should think not, as he is with the army in Spain, and Ins distinguished him¬ self, I understand but it is very strange, now you revert to that adventure, thai we have never agam seen that noble postil¬ lion, who meant to hav e engrafted himself into our family ' Various tonjectures were tøaiiied by the ladies, who agreed that, whoever lie was, be was certainly feai ful of not apptïar. ing to advantage m his real character.
CHAPTFR VII Lord Wallingford suffered some months to elapse ere he sought to obtain an íntei- aiew with the widow, who frequently read his praises in the papers, and felt some times half angry with her friend the colo¬ nel for laughing at them, as being of his own insertion, but never dared take upon her to defend lnm merely observing, that it wa» generally agreed he was a very brave officer, though not so young as Momrngthorpe, he had, when occasion re quired, appeared no less eager to distin¬ guish himself " No one ever doubted his lordship s personal courage, since he has frequently given proofs of it, equally useless and equally rash,' repl ed the colonel, " but I feel assured that he never was eonsideied by his commanders as a good or an expe¬ rienced soldier, and such was bis rank m

CHAPTER VIII. Having devoted on hour to reflection, and solaced herself vvith the consoling idea that her impetuous lover had shewn himself the most disinterested of men, since, had he sought her estates he would haye gone to law, therefore it was her band he covet¬ ed. Having thus satisfied bee lovwt feel¬ ings, aud giatified her self-love, she order- r S
etl her carnage, and drove as usual to the Grange, determined, without entenng into any details, to mention the earl's visit as one of civility and respect to her situa¬ tion She found the colonel much bettei, and very agreeable to her wish that Anna might return the ensuing week to the Ab¬ bey, which would have been quite л soli¬ tude, she told him, if Mrs Courtney and her sister had not spent a great deal of time with her, adding—" And this morn¬ ing I had a very unexpected visitor, no other than the earl of Wallingford who bemg in the neighbourhood, thought it neiessary to pay me his compliments ' " In hopes, I suppose, of removing the piejudices he may reasonably suppose you have imbibed from sn Herbert, replied the colonel "Is he а pleasant man' Selby tells me he is still а very fine figure " ľ He certainly does not look his age, and 1 must confess his visit has rather re¬ moved my prejudices, indeed, I think he has been more sumed agamst than sinning, as I can make great allowances for cither sex, when married against their
inclination, and it is but justice to believe he is now a reformed man." The colonel was surprised, and not ab¬ solutely pleased with this half-defence of what he deemed inexcusable libertinism ; still, as he had never spoken his real senti¬ ments of the earl to sir Herbert, he was not more inclined to reveal them to her ladyship, who might <\jiia)ly attribute his dislike to interest»:.! motives; he therefore coolly observed, " from her ladyship's ac¬ count, the world had not done his lord¬ ship justice." " He has given it but too much reason to condemn him; but he may have seen his folly. I am for judging charitably." The colonel felt uneasy, he hardly knew why, but readily agreed with her in lean¬ ing to the side of mercy ; still he felt re¬ lieved when she changed the subject, and much gratified by her inviting herself to dine at tbe Grange. Noman waslesssel·· fish than our colonel, and never luid he for a moment supposed that he should succeed his deceased friend ; indeed he could not be said to love lady Charleville but as a
sister, while he respected ber as tbe pro¬ tectress of his child, still he would huve felt setiouslv grieved had he inspected that she was determined to marry the very man his poor fnend had so carefully ex- eluded from all share of his property, and whom he certainly, were he permitted to look down upon lus widow, would not approve of her making his successor As it was, he merelj supposed the earl lud paid a formal visit, and had endeav oui ed, as was natural, torender himself agreeable to hei ladj ship, smte he might liopt she w ould consider Ins sol t of hei editavy citions m the final disposal of her property !.. therefoie etrovc, after her ladyship s depaı¬ ture, to banish the said earl from his mind, whom he could not help suspecting had sci/ed the opportumfv of his daughtei s absence to obtain а sort of footing at the Abbey, but hoping and believing that he would not be encouiuged to repeat Ins in¬ timacy, as no one seemed more inchned to tøay the propei tnbute ot respect to β de ceased husband than lady Charleville, and as the eail had never been received dunng
the'bnronet's lifetime,¡he would not suffer himself to suppose he could be a welcome visitor to the widow. How much he wouldihave been surprisedhad he known that twodays were never suffered to elapse without his addressing lady Charleville in writing; and as noman was Inore' justly renowned for I'cloqiwncc du billet, her ludyship, though she did not answer above one in ten of these tender effusions, felt persuaded that he was-~ifi not the mirror ot' constancy he wished to delineate him¬ self, who had sacrificed— " Dh/j ι litenni s*. htiu.t с imHir's, miriti t! ¡.etice, Niţlltnsţ, »nil lit?elil. luilumil," to loVe for her—tliat be was nevertheless а most passionate lover; and he continually rose to her mind's eye in all the united graces and dignity of, his early manhood, and with politeness ,*liich could boast the first polish— eed she remembered that she had loved,, to all the excess of the senti¬ ment; therefore the sweetness and viva¬ city ot' the impression, though partly ob¬ literated by his vile conduct, was never for-
gotten t his unmanly desertion bad tor¬ tured and rendered her wretched in the extreme; but havmg pride, strength of mind, ι high spirits, and intellectual, re¬ sources, she felt convinced that she was nett bom to be the victim of contemned affec tion ; but these reminiscences only render¬ ed his now avowed and lasting passion the more flattering; and fortunately for the eorl, they were so situated that she could not put anyone into her confidence; therefore when Anna returned to the Abbey, she never mentioned his lordship's Пате, nor ever reverted to his visit ; liis letters were oil franked from his ..eat in Dorsetshire, whither he had returned to brood over his plans, and to arrange how he should vvish to dispose of her property : he could' not hope to obtain it without making some great sacrifices^-immediate possession of the one-half was oil he hoped to Compass, but for the present he never touched|Upon money matters, trusting wholly to the mav gical word love, which he could dwell upon with an ingenuity all his own. She was enjoying what might be termed

A r the appointed time, the eail, adorned for conquest, and looking moie the gentle¬ man, and f u more elt gant than lus fashion¬ able son, was admitted mto lady Cbarle- villc's presence She had mentioned his eNpeeted visit to Anna, in α tone of mdif- fuencc, as one of business, yet had not given oulcrs to be denied hawing so tew inoitimg visitors (the colonii excepted, nnd be was gone to Southampton), she en¬ tert uned no fears of ïntemiption, and did not vv ıslı hei serv ants to suppose the earl was either an expected or α privileged visitor We shall not recapitulate then discouise, the ice having been bioken, and both her love and her fears having been aheadj too successfully attacked, to rendei his lordships complete victory over her
better judgment doubtful Yet he affiti ed to dread what might have been the re suit of her reflections, though Ins first glance assured lum they had been hv om able to his cause he again extenuated what he termed his cnors—again pleaded love as an excuse for the past, and Ircm bled lest he had pl inted distrust where it would have been his pnde and his felicity toentreat a softer feehng—dwelt with ener¬ gy upon the punty of that character which had stood the oideal of a public life—one minute declared himself unworthy bei re gard, and the next affirmed that his hu¬ mility was the offspung of that aident passion which had hitherto embittered his days. In short, as no man could talk more to the purpose, andas las thi eats, peihaps, bad dnven the past entnely from lady Chai leville s recollection, she hailed what she deemed the certain proof of his îefor- mation, and forgot that no woman blessed with real fteling ought to trust her peace to the keeping of a hbertine, since either vanity or love, or both combined, led her
to bt heve that she could now fix bis hitherto unprincipled heart, since love for her had occasioned all his derelictions Yet, let us do her the justice to declare, that had she been less sensitive upon the score of repu¬ tation, she w ould have taken much longer time to deliberate, but as circumstances seemed to render it necessary she should marry the carl, she suffered her reason to be hoodwinked, and her judgment to ho dormant, while she gave the reins to love, fancy, and imagination and no man was more exactly calculated to bend her to his purpose, by adroitly dwelling upon the excellent character she boie, then paint¬ ing in the most dawling colours the plea¬ sures of high hfe, the advantages of rank, and the triumph of reclaiming a man who had made himself conspicuous m the annals of gallantry She was listening to his sophistry with every appearance of satisfaction, when a servant threw open the door, and an¬ nounced lord Danvers The earl started up, transfixed with amaze, and doubting the evidence of his
eyes and ears, while the disconcerted 1 id J Charlev ille instantly guessed the visit wns intended for Miss litzmaiuice llie vis count fully participated in thur stirpine not having an idea of bis fathei s being in Hampshire aud even hud he known he w as m the vicinity, he w ould nev eı hav e expected to luve met hım tete a tete with lady Chaileville, baung ofttn heard liuu mention her as having by her arts rendei¬ ed sir Heibert his enemy, when he sud denly ıecollected tint the same magnet might have drawn lnm to the Abbey Ballvmg his spirits, having made Ins bow, he told ladj Chaileville, insolently eyeing Jus 1 itlit i w luie speaking, that he had inti üdéd upon bei leisme, though his visit was more properly to Miss 1 itzmauntt she was from homi, tilt seivants hud told lnm, theitfoie he had asked foi her lady ship, ш hopes that she would favoui Ins wish to be piopeilv introduced to liei young friend, for whom he now declared the must violent passion, adding—" I think myself fortunate, my loid, in liaving ¿o unixpettedlj met with you, as you can
satisfy her ladyship respecting those par¬ ticolare lier regard for Miss Fitzmaurice mayinduce her to wish to hav e elucidated." The earl bad soon recovered bis usual presence of mind ; still he dared not pro¬ voke his son, therefore did not express any displeasure 1 ,' merely observing—" Had you mentioned your wishes to me, I would have prepared lady Charleville for your visit." " As it is, my lord," she rejoined, " I must refer you to colonel Fitzmaurice; his favour and introduction may have the hap¬ piest effects in your behalf. Miss Fitz¬ maurice is truly deserving your regard, and I shall think you much to be envied should you prove successful." " I called at the Grange, in my way hither, as I know etiquette requires me to address myself to the colonel ; he was from home—may I therefore entreat your lady¬ ship would exert your influence in my be¬ half witb both father and daughter? the latter is indebted to you for all her talents, and I declare I never beheld а more charm¬ ing woman." vol. iv. u
" She deserves general admiration, and is fully aware of her own importance in society, nor does she pride herself upon her superficial acquirements, since her principal happiness appears to consist m the punctual performance of her moral du¬ ties, as she has reached maturity ere any of her early good impressions have been effaced by an intercourse with the world, therefore I repeat, you will be а most for¬ tunate man should you succeed in your application, whicli you will do well tc make through the medium of the colonel ' " Your ladyship has rendered me more eager in the pursuit, mdeed I had re soh cd never to marry a fashionable belle, since were Miss rit¿maurice divested o) half her agi ¿mens, novelty alone woulc give her eclat but I fear, from my father'! looks, that I intrude upon business of mon importance, may I therefore request tha( your ladyship would name my visit to your lovely friend, and that you will favour my pretensions to her hand'' bowing and le- treating, convinted that the eail was pay¬ ing his devoirs to the woman he had so

notoriety, his late mother's pet, whose in¬ tellectual resources were upon a par with her favourite's. " Robert has ever been my favourite," he continued ; " his education fell to my share—lie was brought up to the church, and maybe a bishop; with bim Miss Fitzmaunce might enjoy rational lmppines»- -Mm I would recommend to her notici :, but this silly fellow has made me waste moments which are to me doubly precious," returning to his darling self, till having exhausted the subject, be with¬ drew, having received permission to renew his visits when he chose. Whether be overacted his part, or whe¬ ther the entrance of lord Danvers bad oc¬ casioned a revulsion in her ideas, lady Charleville did not feel so satisfied with tbe carl as .she had hoped; perhaps the certainty that tbe die was cast made her feat! she bad been too precipitate; yet sbe could not retract—iiOvv that it was too late, she wished she had opened lier mind to the colonel; still, how humiliating to Have acknowledged her exact situation vvith his lordship, who must be actuated
by love'—she would not suffer herself to doubt his regard, therefore, by way of di¬ verting her thoughts from her own con¬ cerns, she sought Anna, who was returned from her walk, andgaily congratulated her upon tlie prospect slie bad of being a peeress " Did lord Wallmgford come ainbassa- dor from his son ? " Not exactly, as they met rather unex. pectedly, the colonel being from home, the viscount lcquested me to do the ho¬ nours of his modesty " I dare say be means to do me honour, but surely he cannot suppose that I can feel any sentiment resembling love for a man whom I have merely seen at a ball, whose eharaetei I im unacquainted with, and whose sole ment ıs being a strict votary of fashion " If I did not know you as well as I do, my beloved gnl, I should suspect you had either no heart to give, or that you were very romantic —yet Teleffiachus was not a soldier" " I understand the implication, but deny the inference though İ feel the greatest

and on the other side of thirty, his firat abord wai rather prepossessing with some of hw father's C/iesterfteldism he paid se veral oblique compliments to the colonel s profession and finally avowed himself a candidate for his daughter s favour The colonel though he disliked the earl and had heard that lord Danvers trod in Ins steps felt flattered by the compii ment paid Ins daughter as he knew he ranked high m the fashionable world and in the peeiage, nnd had a handsome fortune m possession and a larger one m rever sion theiefore he made no doubt manj families vv ould be easei foi the connexion, and if Ins daughter approved of Ins ad dresses he should not hold up the dark side of the picture lhe carl s visits to lady Charleville weie now very satisfactorily accounted foi and with his accustomed urbanity he assured the young peer that he believtd lus daughters heart to be in her own posses¬ sion therefore he must win htr and wear her she was more than of age and pel fectly her own mistress as he should

or that his fattier had undermined him in Miss Fitzmaurice's opinion—nay, lutlf-in- dined to believe he was the man she pre¬ ferred ; and as the earl was now publicly at Southampton, and merely а private visitor at tbe widow's, he proceeded to his lodgings when he left the Abbey, and openly taxed bim with having occasioned his failure. Tbe earl was not so easily disconcerted ; he could play upon his son's weakness, who ]e" him persuaded that he bad been anx¬ ious to bring about this very union, mid that lady Charleville, to whom he acknow¬ ledged he had made proposals, had de¬ cidedly rejected hind, which, he told the viscount, perfectly accounted for his cava¬ lier treatment, as she would not wish her protegee to marry into bis family ; hint¬ ing to his duped son that he meant to pu¬ nish both ladies for 'their insolence and want of policy, as he had resolved to dis¬ pute the late baronet's will, which would set aside Miss Fitzmaurice's legacy, and rèduce the widov*to her jointure; adding— ι " The former is, if I understand right, en»-'
gaged to sir Henry Moniingthorpe, who has fought his way to preferment, and will, ten to one, revenge your cause by marrying some Spanish donna, and leaving Anna Fitzmaunce to wear the willow ' Lord Danvers was completely deceived by his more wily father, and generously enjoyed the idea of the projected lawsuit, as nomen who set themselves up in so strange a manner ought to be taught hu mihty and having no pursuit to detain him in Hampshire, he soon left the held open to the earl, who t, ive lady Charleville so little peace, and cnacte d the ardent lover so successfully, that when she changed her mourning, sbe suffered lnm to write her his proposals respecting settlements, and told him that she should now inforni colo¬ nel Titzmaunce and Mr Selby of their in¬ tended marnage The earl applauded her prudence, and readily agreed to her wi h to have eviry arrangement made pnvately and secretly for their nuptials It may be supposed that Anna, vvho was neither blind nor detective ш penetration,
bad for some time suspected that the earl, if not a constant visitor, wis a constant «nd a favoured correspondent ; but respect for lady Charleville had prevented her mentioning her œnjecturee even to the colonel, who was the most incurious and the most unsuspicious of men; yet lord Dsunvers's hints and hie own remarks led bim to fear lord Wallingford had assailed the widow with some degree of success. He was therefore fully prepared for her confidential communications, and did not evinoe any surprise at her avowed deter¬ mination in the earl's favour; merely ob¬ serving, that he trusted she had consulted ber own happiness, and that, as she wae past the age of romenos, that she would not place too much power in tbe hands of bis lordship, though he believed him to be a very honourable man in his money transactions, and if he was not, as report affirmed, в reformed one, ber condescen¬ sion must bave the happiest effect upon his morals. Lady Charleville Was mueh ¿ratified by bis appeHUDşt to approve of lier intttntiona,
as it gave her spirits to consider the future more distinctly ; and fain would she have deceived herself into a belief that she had, by acceding to his lordimip's wishes, se¬ cured her own peace Æf mind; but con¬ science, that imperious monitress, repeat¬ edly whispered that she was sacrificing as much to fear as to love, though she flat¬ tered herself the earl war solely actuated by the latter passion, while she now saw many disagreeables in perspective, that would have escaped the brighter eyes of eighteen : she was happy, contented, and respected as lady Charleville—what more had she to hope or expect from the pro. jected union, save a continuance of the same blessings' But as the timedrew near when she was required to ratify the pro¬ mises she had made his impatient lordship, most bitterly did she repent not having been perfectly confidential with colonel Fitzmaunce, whose manners (though he endeavoured to appear as cordial as ever) were tinctured with reserve, and who ap. peared fearful of addressing her with bis usual familiarity; the fact was, he jo
much felt the necessity of keeping a strict guard over his tongue, that he no longer appeared perfectly at his case m her 1; dy¬ shıp s presence one thing alone consoled him for htr folly, he should enjoy the tom- fort of Ins daughter's society, as be was re^ solved, though she might be a visitor, she should never be an inmate ot the earl s The more the colonel appeared toslmnk from the subject, the more eager did her ladyship fed to remove lus suspected ob- jettions, and to reconcile lnm to her dis. posing of the Abbey and the surrounding estates The first time she mentioned her intention of so doing, he requested she would give Mormngthorpe, to whom he would dispatch an expresa the next day, the refusal he was anxious to make sucb a purchase, and Melksham Abbey seemed the very abode to please him Her ladyship instantly acceded to his wishes, introducing him that very evening to her future lord and master, who certainly did and said every thing in his power to re¬ move the colonel s inherent prejudices, lell¬ uig bim that he had long wished to be bet-
ter acquainted with hun, and nssunnghim, that it be was not obliged to retain bis ow n seat in Dorsetshire, he would dispose of that, in preference to parting with wh it he might equally term an heirloom, since as si ch he considered the Abbey, but lady Chulé v ille, «hose wishes it would always belii pude to meet, had decided to sell the latte r, rather than retain it as her o« n , he therefore proposed that half the pur¬ chase-money should be sunk m an an¬ nuity for her life, which would be fully equivalent to her present rent-roll, and that all her funded property should be ap propnated to her sole and separate use, to remain m the names of trustees of her own appointing, and to be at her own disposal when she died Tliese had been her own arrangements, in preference to having a jointure secured upon his estate, and he hoped that colonel Fitzmaunce would be¬ in ve that he should secure bei all his per- sonai property, m the event of her sur¬ viving lnm Our colonel could merely signify his as¬ sent to these arrangements, though he
agreed they were very liberal on both sides and at the joint request of both par¬ ties, he agreed to be one of her ladyship's trustees, who bad resolved George Selby should be the other—they were joint trns. tees of the chantable fund, and no men could be more proper to act as her friends When he returned home, he requested Anna would ride over and breakfast with hmi, as lie bad many things to wnte and arrange previous to his setting out for London, which heproposed doing at eleven o'clock, as he wished to dispatch his letter to Momrngthorpe from thence, and to see Selby ere he wrote The earl had put a value upon the house end estate, m conjunction with Mi An¬ drews, and sir Henry Momrngthorpe was to take the furniture, tScc at a fair valua¬ tion The colonel made minutes of all that passed, and returned home to wonder that nny woman, situated like his fnend's widow, should barter her peace of mind, futuie happiness, immense fortune, 4tc for а coronet, as he made no doubt of the earl's devoirs b»mg pnncipally paid to ber
estate and ready money, since he was not inclined to believ e that the man who had been unfaithful to a young, rich, and hand¬ some wife, would be reclaimed even by his favourite lady Charleville, at the age of fifty three, and who had lived so long out of the gay world, that he conceived she would find herself exceedingly dis¬ placed in the circles of fashion, and instead of finding her home а scene ot calm com¬ fort and quiet cheerfulness, as heretofore, she would exchange it for midnight revel- ìy, crowded parties, and all the languor and ennui of fashionable mornings and evening dinners however, ns the die was cast, he wished her well, but thought it did not require thé spint of piopheoy ttv predict that her ow n virtues would render her miserable
CHAPTER XI Anva vv as punctual to her appointment, but she wi s more sanguine in her expecta¬ tions of her ρ itroness's happiness than the colonel bhe icntem'ed that tin earl was an elegant mun of fisl ion, who fully ap. preti ited lady Chrr'evillest hnts, and re. vered her virtues, he was polite m hi« at¬ tentions, gay in lus tonvtrsation, and as they wei e nearlv of un ege, she thought him eminently qualified to make her re¬ vered fnend happy, she agreed that he was no favounte of the late sir Herbert's, still she argued that he might now have seen bis early errors, and she would not suffer herself to suppose he did not feel the greatest regard for lady Charlev die The colonel wished she might prove the truer prophet, candidly telling her he should not approve of her continuing her ladyship's inmate after she married, as be
should feel very li.hely at Cliaring, evm admitting Moinuigiiitnpe puiclntscet the Abbey.

The colonel therefore departed, rejoicing in the idea that his beloved daughter had not, like her matron friend, been dazzled by the sight of a coronet. To Selby he spoke his real feelings, and desired him to enter into every necessary detail of busi¬ ness respecting the Abbey: he did not Wish to enforce the purchase, as he might appear to be actuated by selfish, instead of friendly motives; he therefore touched but slightly upon the subject to his favou¬ rite, yet suffered his wish to have him for а neighbour to appear in spite of'his caution, and thus proceeded—" I certainly feel much disappointed in lady Charleville— not, believe me, that I»ever entertained tbe
most remote idea of sticceeding my 1* mented friend ; indeed the respect) and Vt*. neration he bad inspired me with would have rendered me avetse to making pro¬ posals to bis widow, whom I dld'ennsider as very superior to her sex, till she suffered the rank of lord Walhngfoid io blind her to his errors, since I pince no fuith in his supposed reformation > yet I aniso situated that I am obliged to remain < passive, as I was not informed of her ladyship's in- terition till the settlements were ar¬ ranged·—nay, perhaps the Wedding-day fixed, though my friend has not been dead more than sixteen months.

Much more did the colonel write, but «β He was unacquainted with the real rea-

Lord D invers hud been exceedingly pro¬ voked when informed of Ins fathu s maı- nage, as he felt assured he had uo intention
of disputing sn Herbert s will therefore having inherited more than his share of the earls premeditated malice, he wrote colonel Fitzmaunce that he had bte« most egregiously duped by his father, whir had lamented to lum having been rejected by lady Chaileville, whom he now felt in¬ clined to pity, as she would very soon dis¬ cover he had merely wished to secure her estates, as the earl was proud tyrannical, and self interested of these facts no one could be a better judge than himself, since he was frequently the witness of his dis sensions with his mother, in which he was invanably to blame concluding by ad¬ vising him to recall his daughter, since the carl was a general lover, and if disappoint¬ ed in his views, he had been known to whisper away a reputation Colonel ritzmaunce made great allow anees for the every way disappointed son though he despised his malice, still he made no doubt the earl was the character he represented biru, therefore he resolved to withdraw Anna from his vortex as speed¬ ily as possible, seizing the presentoppor·

She had with grief remarked that the eail, though still politely attentive to bis lady, did not ap¬ pear to feel the real regard for her which had always been apparent in the words and actions of sn Herbert Chaileville now, when ladj Wallmgford was particularly addressing lum, the earl appeared listless and inattentive, and sometimes with diffi¬ culty suppressed a yawn, while he left her in public wholly to the care of his son, or to any other gentleman who chanced to be of their party, though he endeavoured to keep up appearances, particularly in her presence, but she was now incbned to be-
lieve that he was а perfect Janu;, .and could, cameleonflike, assume any hue, or any tone most likely to answer his nefa¬ rious .purposes.
CHAPTER xm.
Enlightened by the communications of Manning, our heroine resolved to be very much upon her guard; she should soon leave Bath, and she sincerely hoped and prayed that nothing might occur to hasten bei departure. The eail wislied to appear a reformed mnn, even in the eyes of the world ; from hiin therefore she trusted she had nothing to apprehend, and his son would not find it an easy matter to dupe her again into his power ; indeed slie hoped, if he was, as she suspected, her mysterious lover, that he bad suffered so severely for his folly, he would not be m haste to risk hie safety a second time ; be that as it may, and .should She be abb to
convict him to his face of having acted so absurd, not to say base a part, she resolved not to expose either to the censure or the derision of the world, for the sake of the amiable woman who had so unfortunately connected herself with this, she feared, un¬ principled family. Having thusdecided, she joined the party in the drawing-room ; the day passed much as usual, and the evening was spent at а fashionable party. A week elapsed without any thing oc¬ curring either to remove or strengthen her suspicions. Mr. Danvers continued po¬ litely attentive to both her and the coun¬ tess, to whom she fancied he said more than he ventured to disclose to her, as the countess, vvho endeavoured to appear in her usual spirits, sometimes rallied her upon having certainly disposed of her heart in favour of а man whom she had never seen. Anna, happy to see her gay, ably de¬ fended bei own cause: had sbe dared, she would have expressed tier wonder that after what the countess had known and heard of lord Walhngfoid, she should have
given lum her hand, it was suiely better to revere a man for lus vu tues and heroism, with whom she was not personally ac¬ quainted, than to marry a man whose vir¬ tues were the mere tlinneras of her be¬ loved fnend β imagination, and whose rank in life had blinded her to his defects The eail, whose plans had been much deeper laid than Anna could ev en have suspected, appeared solicitous to afford his son opportunities for piefen mg his suit, and as she thought the sooner he came to the point, the sooner she could dismiss him altogether, she did not shrink from Ins society, though Ins very prominent man¬ ners often tried her patience Lady Wallingford no longer appealed inclined to favour bis pursuit, having, too late for her peace, discovei ed that the eail was as much the libertine in his pursuits as when he led her to be the innocent partner of Ins guilt, still she forcibly felt that the sorrows of a wife weie best in her own keeping, tliere was, besides, something verj humiliating, consideiing their lespee vol iv ι
tive ages, in mentioning her disappoint¬ ment to the child of bei adoption A cold caught at the rooms prevented her ladj ship from attending the breakfast- table Anna, as usual, presided at the meal, which was no sooner over, than the ι ail with affected nnxitty left the room to ν ısıt his lady—" Who ought, he observ¬ ed, though his unmoved countenance be. lied his words, " to have some advice, ' leaving his son and our heroine ťtííe-a- tHc, who suspected Mr Danvers would sci »e the opportunity to push his fortune, she was therefore very agreeably disap¬ pointed by his turning towards a w indovv, and making some cursory rem irks respect¬ ing tbe weather, addressing her more par- tnularly, he inquired whither she had ever sun the duke of-----? Niver, to her knowledge " He generally goes to the pump room muth about this hour, I was told yester- t'lij are you intimed to take а view of tins really gieat man ? ' 1 Chance m ij favour my doing so, but I h d lather not leave home this morning,
as I mean to gom the countess when tl e carl leaves hei Mr Danvers could not object to her considerate intention, therefore lmdly 1 now ing what to say, he launched out in pruse of the countess, for whom hede dared he felt the greatest respect— Be tween ourselves, he continued, I was nthcr surprised when I learnt she had cu pituluted however the call lias been a fortunate man to have obt uned such а wife, one] the possession of vv hat he mi 0 bt considei as having eluded his grasp Anna hardly knew w hat reply to make consistent with her usual smcenty, there fore contented herself by joining in h s piaiscs of the countess v^ho h id been moie than а mother to liei rcvcitmg to their fiist acqu untaiice, and to the great kını! ness she had experienced from her ladv ship while a mere dependent upon hci bounty She Ins prov ed herself an accui ite judge of merit and would I dare sav tjloiy even m the nominal title of join mother Suffer me ----- 1 2
The entrance of the earl checked the studied declaration which he had rallied courage enough to make, and relieved Anna from an unjileasant situation, though, as she fores-w she was doomed to listen to bis hyperboles, she wished the matter was decided In answei to her anxious inqui¬ ries, the earl was happy to inform her the countess was much better, therefore w ould not hear of his sending for medical advice, by his persuasion she had agreed not to rise till near dinner—indeed she seemed inclined to dose when he left her, and he had an nppomtment upon business, which ini t plead his apology for not offering to accompany her during her usual walk, giv ing his disconcerted son a look which he did not interpret as bis fither wished, who had even left the room, and Anna was prepanng to follow lnm, ere he could muster courage to request Miss Titzmnu rice would allow hnn to supply the eail s place was she inclined to walk, to mount hei horse, or should he drive hei in the tails curricle?

the earl, who hoped to be her heir, to as¬ sume the mask most foreign to his feel¬ ings, that of affection to this injured wo¬ man, though he suffered no opportunity to escape him of at least appearing to sigh for our amiable heroine, whose virtuous indignation was at last so completely roused by his impertinent inuendoes, that she half-resolved to write to her father to recall her: prudence, as she grew cooler, forbade that ; she was to leave Hath in a week, as the allied sovereigns were daily expected in London, the colonel wrote her, who had heard from sir Henry Mornuigthorpe since the battle of Thou- louse, during which he had rendered him¬ self conspicuous, and would certainly be created a baronet when he retuined home, which he hoped to do as soon as be could be spared from his military duty. She communicated bis letter to* the countess, who desired she would invite the writer to spend a few days with them, when hé came in search of her. Prudential motives, suggested by Ann»,
induced Mr Danvers to precede her to town, and most ardently did sbe long for her fathers arrival, when left alone with the earl and countess, as she could not al¬ ways avoid his lordships pointed atten¬ tions, which even excited the notice of his neglected wife, and made her resolve never to ask another young woman to become her inmate while she continued to reside with the earl, vvho now began to talk of their removal to town proposing to write to engage а bouse for their residence, when alone with her α few days after bis eons departure, to which she objected, under the plea of indisposition, and a wish to avoid fatigue proposing, when Anna left her to remove to Clifton, whither she should summon a Channg friend to keep lier company while his lordship visited London, requesting he would suffer Anna to suppose she should follow her thither, for fear she should object to kaving ber alone The carl was by no means sorry she chose to remain in comparative privacy, as it »vauid be а great saving, and he should
be much moro nt liberty without her; therefore, though for form s sake he endea¬ voured to overrule ber objection« he final¬ ly made a merit ot allowing her to jilease heiself, telling her that he should seize the opportunity of Ann is being still with her to make a short visit to Channg, where his presence was required to sign soine deeds m Mr Andrews s hands, relative to the Abbey lands he did not mean to be absent moie than two nights Lady Wallmgford scarcely inquired the nature of his business, so indiffeient had she become, in little mort thin three months, to bis pursuits and concerns as she had soon discovered strong ti uts of hypo¬ ci isy among the daikci shades of his cha¬ racter, and much deeper shades of guilt than she had hitherto supposed attached to his follies, his conduct towards herself had been what she deemed nngtnteful in the extreme, sirtce her heart had b"cn en- tirely devoted to his influence when she gave him her hand but he Ind bl isted ill her fond hopes, deadened her ftdiues and established perfect indifference where far
other sentiments would have prevailed had he not thrown ofl the mask of virtue cv en during the honeymoon

which she requested she would invite Mrs Cummings, in her name, to jom her as soon as Miss Titzmaunce left her, as she proposed spending the summer at Clifton, and wished for а companion of her ovvn age Mrs Andrews w aited upon this widowed wife directly, who was in ecstaues at the idea of being thus noticed by a countess, and declared herself ready to set out at a moments notice As she was no fool, though, like her superiors, v anity had ren¬ dered ber imprudent, she promised not to mention vv here she was going, for fear of affording Cummings 1 a clue to trace her( and wrote α very proper letter of thanks to I idy Wallingford, w luth Mrs Andrews inclosed m the one she intrusted to tba euil s care, who had requested to remain perfectly incog during his very short stay, and he was so little known at Charing, ex¬ cept by tin servants at the Abbey, that he entertained no fears of bemg recognized, and to avoid extiting notice, he had walk¬ ed from Southampton to Mr Andrews's, and chose to return thither also on foot, as

СНАРТЕД XV. No man could be more alf in aH tilings fo alt meh than our wily peer ; few people could resist his eloquence ; and when he had any end ih view, his manners were at once fascinating and prepossessing. Gm- scicitci, ör, as he Would have said 1 , instinct, léd him to suspect be was not a particular favourite of colonel Fitzmaurice's; he there¬ fore called all bis powers ol' pleasing to bis insistance when he returned to Bath. To lady Wallingford he was affectionately at¬ tentive, and eager to relaie the cbit-chat, of her once-favourite Cftaring; towards lus male guest he enacted the hospitable friend, complimenting him upon the im¬ provements he had, made in bis own do¬ main, and declaring hts decided approba¬ tion of those which were pianning under bis direction in the Abbey'grounds; к 2
speaking in the highest terms of Mr. An¬ drews ; it was a real luxury to spend a day w ith such a family ; he was a credit to the yeomanry of Great Britain, and his farmhouse liare was preferable to any fo¬ reign dainties ; launching out in praise of the beauties of nature, till the colonel thought him a very reasonable well-in¬ formed, and certainly a very polite man, though he feared he did not sufficiently appreciate the merits of his countess, whose countenance did not pronounce her to be a happy wife; and notwithstanding she was very much upon her guard, she met his advances witb more indifference than the colonel had supposed was in her na¬ ture. Anna was not, it may be supposed, over¬ looked by this adept in modern gallantry, he had seen and admired her favourite birds, which still remained at the Abbey, and was happy to inform her, from tbe authority of Mrs. Andrews, that all her village pensioners were well : to Eliza he had something equally appropriate to say, therefore the colonel could only regret
there were any dark shades in the charac tor of so pleasant a man, who devoted Ins whole time to thtir amusement and eould one moment rejoite with tbe colonel that peace was once more restored to Europe and reason very ably upon causes and ef ftcts, while the next he was trifling with the young ladies, or making them laugh at some ludicrous anecdote in circulation in the gay world Even Anna had never seen him to such advantage, since she no longer wondered at his having captivated her beloved countess, who was pleased with his attention to her fnends, and pro portionably grateful for this: gleam of sun shine As the emperor Alexander and his bro¬ ther sovereign were daily expected, the colonel left Bath, with his daughter and niece, three days after the earls return thither The parting between Anna and her mother, as she deemed the countess, greatly depressed the spints of both, our heroine promised to write her very fte quently, hoping she would very soon fol low them to town
Lady Wnlhngfoid said that must de¬ pend upon cucumstances—at all events, she should let the first bustle subside before she visited tlie metiopohs, and finally, at the moment of stpar ition, she told her fa- v ourite she believed she should remain quiet in the countiy, as, were she to go to tow n, she must bt piesented to her ma- jestv, and attend sp many fetes that she dieaded the necessary fatigue, and she should see eveiy thing worth not.ee m hei mind ь eye, aided by her letters and the daily papeis Anna could only regret she entertained such fears, though they seemed very na¬ tural, consideiing the very retued life she had led. since tliey became acquainted The oolopel thought she proved her wis¬ dom, reminding Anna that they would very eefdqm have níet, even had the toun- tess chosen to mix in the throng which would be assembled to see these gieat wen They were no soonei gone than the eail, what had breakfasted with them, and handed the young ladies into the chaise, caiclessly asked the countess whethei she
had absolutely determined to visit Clifton, in preference to accompanying him to town, as he could not absent himself from court at such α time ? " I neither supposed you could, nor did I wish to detain you from what to me ap¬ pears a duty ; but as I have determined never to be presented at court, nornever to appear in the world of fashion, I shall adhere to my first plan. Do not interrupt me, my lord, because it is necessary we should perfectly understend each other, that we may play our respective parts with proper deference to the opinion ofthe world. I do not mean to recriminate—I sball merely obseive, that I have a second time become yoW'dupe. I placed implidt fiiith m your protestations, while you, I make no doubt, laughed at my credulity, as you must baVe perceived that you had succeeded in reviving my former and long dormant attachments and I would wish yon to ask your own heart, whether you have endeavoured since marriage to im¬ prove your interest in my regard* No need, you might with justice reply, us you
bad gamed your end, and induced me to believ e you the reformed man you chose to ìepresent jourstlf, while you weie mi tiatmg a fresh dupe to gratifv your vices I need not be more explicit I clare saj if I must, this letter from lord Danvers, w ho seems to have inherited your turn for mis¬ chief, will fully explain my meaning He, in revenge for what he styles your dupli¬ city, has favoured me with your avowed opinion of me prev lous to our union, and vvitli many details respecting your Dorset¬ shire fair dupe, of course, you can no longer deceive me, as you now stand con¬ fessed the very unpnncipled libertine you werewben vvefirstmet you have nothing to dread from the discovery, as I shall not blazon your iniquities noi your decep tıons, since, for my own sake, and to spare the few friends I can boast, I wish to con¬ tinue upon speaking terms with you My own income will suffice for my wants, and I shall spend my summerat Clifton, m the autumn I may visit your family seat, and while your inmate, I may appear as mis¬ tress of the bouse but whenever it can be
avoided, I will neither undergo such a pe¬ nance, nor obbge you to enact tbe hypo- cnte We now, I hope, perfectly under¬ stand each other, as I trust my plain deal¬ ing has convinced you that I now regard you with the utmost mdiff rence but there is no need to proclaim our senti¬ ments to the world, therefore let us cor¬ respond when absent, and meet with civi¬ lity , my health may be tbe plea for my caprices, and vou may make а merit of con¬ forming to my wishes The earl was taken by surprise, but, sel¬ dom at а loss for long, he endeavoured to rally the countess out of her plans, vow ing vengeance against lord Damers, and en- deavounng to qualify his assertions, but finding his arguments useless, and that he had lost all power over her mmd, he made а merit of necessity, and came into all her plans, secretly rejoicing that she had not been rendered so wise before marriage therefore feeling it was to his interest to keep her in good-humour, he agreed to all her wishes, with sufficient apparent reluc- E3
tanc«, to make lus oemipbiluce appear a compbment, and rode that tery morning to Clifton, were he secured an excellent nnd mostploasunthalitiition, tq which she removed during the week, having been previously jomedby Mr» Cummings, who fancied herself much happier than when she married her swindling husband, and really proved a very pleasant companion The eorl, who was resolved to do justice to his part, cbose to see the countess com¬ fortably settled in her new abode, and her suite properly appointed, when, regretting the necessity whidi compelled biru to visit the metropolis, be left her to tbe souety of lier gratified companion, and as tbe soveragns were arrived ia London, he bent his steps towards Southampton, for the nearest, peihaps, or curious, he would have said, to discovei whether Miss Norns wished to see these great men Anna had written the countess, (bat they were very comfortably settled- m Norfolk street, m the Strand, and as the reverend Mrs I'ltzmaiince was too lame with the rheumatism, to accompany Llua
and her mto public, lady Fitzmaunce had kindly requested they would place themselves under her care when they needed a chaperon, her elder cousin was also their beau, though not thur in mate, as he had thnmbers in the Temple but she saw with pleasure tint he would do honour to the family title She had seen Selby moie than once md been m traduced to his wife, α ν erj pleasant, un affected, elegant woman, who w ıs verv anxious to contribute to tbeir comfort and amusement and her fathei hoped, as ' Ins occupation tias oa, that they should soon see sir Henry Mornmgtborpe, since he had written to that effect from Pans, and Ind, as usual remembered her, since she had received m mv elegant baubles from this nominal brother among others, a most tlegant bı mıh of pearl lilies, then the pie vailing floweis in France Her ladyship read her epistle to the earl the day previous to his depaitme, who merely observed he did not wonder Ins sons had been ıefuSed, as sn Henry could опете so high
The countess ıeplıed, that Annas heart w as not to be purchased, and she hoped she would m ike α prudent choice, but as Mrs Cummings was present, did not pur¬ sue the subject md, as vve have already s ud, the peer departed for Southampton, and as usual, drove to his widows, not meaning this time, except it became ne cess iry as a blind, to visit Mr Andrew s, else he had an excuse ready, should he be obbgid to call but should he prevail upon this silly girl to leave Charing m Ins company, it might be as well not to set the gossips m the village to mangle his re putation, or afford them an opportunity of wilting their conjectures to Mrs Cum¬ mings, who would doubtless communicate them to the countess, not being muth pre- judıced m favour of the sex, or of husbands in general From Mrs Cummings he had adroitly gleaned all that she knew respecting the Noinses, which simply amounted to his being too intimate with his housekeeper, to his having a silly, romantic, but very handsome daughter, who often rauiblid
about the village of an evening alone, and α son in the armj, w ho had been at Cha¬ nng for a few days just before she left home Respecting the mtenor of the menage, she had merely heard that Mrs Welling was a verj r good manager Mr Ťíorris was supposed to be worth monej', and his daughter had a small independent fortune, which might induct some one to overlook the impiopiitty of her situation The countess had heard nearly the same reports, she observed, declaring she had often grieved a girl so hkelv to be imposed upon by any designing men should be so much exposed to temptation Having thus, like an able general, ob¬ tained every necessary information, our peer laid his plans with eveiy hope of sue¬ cess, being m a manner thrown oft by the countess alîm ding lnm a satisfactory ex¬ cuse The dajs weie at the longest, and as he had started early, he reached the widow's long before dusk, and immediate¬ ly set out for Channg, busting to chance for again meeting with his divinity, whose favounte haunt he had learnt from Mrs.
Cummings, and also the name of a cot- tagep, whose daughter bved dairy maid at the Grove, and who had once lived with Mrs Cummings, and from whom she had denved much of her intelligence respect¬ ing the family liather than fail in his at¬ tempt, he had resolved to have recourse to Hannah Jenkins, through whose medium he might send a billet to this rom mtic girl but ι he s ived hım this tioub'e sinte, guided bj Mrs Cummings s directions, he met her face to fate in a beautiful wood adjoining the Abbey grounds, through vvlutli a road had been tut by the lute sir Herbert Never had oui earl enacted the transported lovtr with more effect, Ins biauteotis heroine rather shrank trom his drdent embr ite, detlaring that he did not treat her with proper respect h id he loved her as he wished to make her bchevi, ho would have called upon her fithci, and have declared who he vv as, and all tliat " My lovely gul, how can you thus wrong me and j ourself ? surely you would not have had me haveengaged yom fathti on my side till 1 vv as cert un you retuined

CHAPTER XV.
Hav ing had full time to arrange his plans during Ins return to Southampton, he ■finally resolved to push on to Winchester, vi hcie he would sleep and breakfast, as he w ished to ste if Margaretta wns fortunate enough to make hei esiape, and w us so far on bei load befoie he proceeded on his jouiney Having therefoie taken the plate, and given tvuy necessary direction,.
he returned tr « >» whom he regretted th' under of setting out immediately iur town, as the law j er required his presence by ten the next morning She said all that was re quisite, and between ten and eleven he drov e up to the first mn m Winchester, and having made a hearty supper, he re tired to rest, since his heart, alwaj s sel fish, had been rendered almost callous by his vicious intercourse with the world therefore, far from thinking what might (to his deluded victim) be the consequence of their joint errois, he was only dreading she would defraud hnn out of the monej he had advanced as the price of all she ought to have held dear hi the woild, he therefore slept as soundly us if he had been planning the most meritorious action, and never woke till roused by Ins valet at eight о clock vv hen dressing himself, he sallied forth to ι econnoitre, and scarcely had be reached the inn where the coach he was looking for changed horses, ere he saw the passengers resuming their seats, having finished their breakfast, and soon dıştın
guished the blooming Margaretta, looking handsomer and more elegant than she had yet appeared to lum , be tnncbed his hat m sign of recognition, and slie smiled her approbation " Surelj I have seen that gentleman be¬ fore ?' said one of the passengers as they drove on, " his regiment is now, perhaps, but certainly was quai tered here some years ago am not I correct, young lady?" " 11 eaily don t know, sir, thegentìeman ıs almost α stranger to me, I merely know his name is Danvers, and that lie has a seat m Doisetslure ' " Then he is not the gentleman I mean, as I am pietty sure be was a peer " Margaretta made no doubt of his being right, and vv as more than ever in love with this thirmmg man, fancying, like Miss Jenny, that she should slime as a peeress, but toi fear of betraying her interest in the subject, she had the sense not to pursue it, though she wondered, as they had evident¬ ly lelt her admirer behind, what she was to do, supposing they reached Fainham before he overtook them Her uneasiness
•was at last removed, as the earl passed her m lus trav elhng chaise (which was quite plain, and bore no marks of bis rank) while the coach was standing at a public-house, and she caught a gl ince of tho well known race the valet was upon the box, and the whole appearance of the equipage w as ex¬ tremely gratifj nig to her vanity, though she w ould have been more pleased had she perceived α coronet upon thepannels,since that would hav e operated like mugic upon hei feelings Nothing of moment passed or occurred till the coach stopped at Farnham " You are not going uny fai thei, ma d mı, ь ud tbe coachman, " j our uncle told my master " No, I am going to a relation s here I cm cany my bundle that little way, giving the man his usual fee, tnd walking foni aid, when having, as duected hy her lover, tumed to the nght, the valet whom she had seen upon the bo\ accosted her hat m hand, requesting she would allow him to take charge ofthe pai eel She made no obje» tion, vv alkmg on in
silence, till another minute brought the man she was most anxious to sec to her view, who hurrying forward, offered her his arm, and they proceeded to the inn where his lordship bad stopped. Having expressed their joy at meeting, the young lady became anxious to proceed to town, as marriage and a licence were now the goal of her hopes. ■ ■' I am fearful wo shall not reach Lon¬ don early enough for office-hours at Doc¬ tor's Commons, as it would be the height of imprudence to think of proceeding im¬ mediately—we must suffer tbe couch you came by to take the lead ; and it will also be necessary to secure sn apartment for your presenti abode, asl should not wish to také you' to my bouse till you can .ap¬ pear in your proper character; my valet shall go forward in the coach you have quitted, to secure an apartment at a re¬ spectable family hotel for this one night— I will sup with 1 you, and breakfast with you in the morning.; 'tis only continuing my nieee till I can address you by a more tender name."
Margaretta felt gratified by her lover's delicacy, who with difficulty concealed his mirth, so much was he diverted by the mixture of prudery, levity, and folly she displayed. The valet, who had previously received bis instructions,, went forward as agreed 1 , being to give tliem tbe meeting at nine o'clock precisely at Hyde-Fark-Corner, by which hour and light the eorl hoped to escape unnoticed, since he wished to be more than ever upon his guard, as he was much more anxious than the countess to preserve appearances, as he knew rumour bad long made free with bis character, and felt assured that his elder son would glory in exposing bis follies ; besides, the; more lenient part of the world had fbund some excuse for his gallantries, not to give them a harsher name, during the life of the first lady Wallingford; but as he was supposed to have married the second from very dif¬ ferent motives, he simuld stand confessed a designing villain, were bis present fol¬ lies to become town-talk ; and during his journey with Margaretta, she proved her-
self such an egiegious fool, and so much more actuated by a wish to be marned, than by any love for his person, that he half regretted hav mg encumbered himself with such an idiot, who might, from her innate obstinacy, which she styled virtue prove more difficult to manage than a more expenenced female whose heart was engaged As to keeping her, that he thought would merely be throwing money away he might amuse himself with her while in town, and then----- But he had not come to any final decision vv hen the carnage stopped at the turnpike and the valet approached There was not even a garret at liberty at the hotel w here he had gone in the first mstinee, but the landlord had recommtnded hun to a rela tion s, who kept a small hotel in the Adel phi, where he had secured him, for th it night only, a very decent apartment, as ill the uppei part of the house vv is engaged for the next day, he undeistood The earl declared himself satisfied they should not rem un at such α house inori voi iv L
than one night, though this was a most respectable family hotel, kept by very re¬ spectable people. Margaretta had often beert in the Adel- phi, and hoped the rooms overlpoked the Thames ; unfortunately this did not prove to be the case ; but aş the house looked handsome and private, as they drove to the door, the earl said, the prospect was of little consequence, as it was too late to en¬ joy it that night, and in the morning they should change their abode. The master and mistiess were from home, the bead waiter who received them nt ths chaise-door informed them, and he had done wrong in engaging the apart¬ ments to his servant, as the gentleman for whom the best part of the house had been taken for the last week, had arrived very unexpectedly about an bour before, but had kindly waved his claim for one night to the rooms in question, in consideration of the lateness of the hour, and tbe town being so very full. The earl declared himself much obliged by bis forbearance, but did not venture to
inquire who he woe, for fear he should be obliged to return his thanks m person as the waiter said lie «as just amved from abroad and to remam unknown was now the summum bonum of Ins lordships wishes who bitterly repented, as they were ascending a handsome stone staircase that he had encumbered himself with this silly girl whose questions, even before the waiter, half disclosed thetr situation, and induced the man to consider them wi'h more attention than he would otherwise have done while shewing them into α spa cious front drawing room, to which was annexed а large doset, which communi cated with а room of а similar size, w hich overlooked the yard 'lhe valet had par ticularly engaged this said closet, m which there was а bed therefore the door lead ing mto the back drawing room had been bolted on this side, w Inch the w alter men tioned retiring to send up coffee as de sired, very much puzzled to decide w be ther the beautiful girl who behaved so strangely was the daughter, wife or mis tress of the new comer
When left to themselves, the earl cau tioned Margaretta against talking of mar nage, &c telling her, for decency s sake, they must pass for man and wife he woull sleep in the closet, and she should occupy the room over head in the morning, as early as consistent with appearances, he would go in search of a licence, cVc " Oh, pray do, as should my father dis¬ cover which road I have taken lie will pursue me and separate us j ou mav take my word " It seems very improbable he shoultl even guess whither you have bent your steps, but when you resolved to personate the heroine, you should have placed an em bargo upon your tongue if yon mention home or Charing or contradict what I may advance, you will lead both yourself and me into strange difficulties you have now passed the Rubicon, and must abide by the consequences Margaretta did not perfectly understand this reasoning, but as her lover seemed very Senous, she thought it most prudent to let him have bis way, since far from ap
ptaring inclined to push his fortune, or to make fine speeches, the earl was pacing the room, considering how he should get nd of this half-witted girl, who promised to give lum more trouble than be thought her conquest worth While he was thus employed, Margaretta, who felt no less disappointment in the fruition of her wishes, was examining the closet, she heard voices m the next room, but as the door was bolted on her side, and locked on the other, she was not afraid of interruption, therefore cunosity and the inertness of her lover tempted her, though 10 strangely situated, to listen to the conversation of these strangers, who were no other than sir Henry Momrngthorpe, for whom the floor had been previously engaged, who had not been, as the waiter had told the earl, more than two hours in London, and w ho, in consequence of his having been preceded by a courier, by whom he had sent a note to Selby, bad been joined by that gentleman just before itfr Dan¬ vers (the earl's travelling name) had ar¬ rived He had brought over dispatches
from the commander in chief, with whom he continued a first-rate favounte, and vvho had seized the first opportunity of sending him officially to England, where he knew bis presence was required when having delivered his packet at the War- Office, where no one of consequence was in waiting, he ordered his chaise to this very hotel, where Selby had by his desire (expressed in his last letter from Pans) secured him the two principal floors he alone knew of his expected return, as he wished to occasion colonel Fitzmaunce, who be supposed would be in London, an agreeable surpnse, and was besides anx¬ ious to have a little pnvate confidential conversation with Selby, before he made his anival generally known Selby, who now entertained the highest opinion of sir Henry s principles, disposi¬ tion, nnd talents for every sort of business, was fortunately at his chambers, though half London were crowding to the opera to see the crowned heads, who were to be there but as his wife was in the family way, and he did not feel inclined to neg-
leet his business, even in favour of royalty, he was mueh more pleased by his surri' mons to attend his client and friend, than had his clerk brought him atı iıîvıtfttiöh to the grand dty dinner of the following day! he therefore reached the Adelphi within five minutes after sir Henry had taken possession of thé back drawlfig-rcwm, little supposing to whom, or for whati purpose he had waved his right to the front apart- inent, or probably be would net have been so complaisant
CHAPTER. XVI Sm Ilemy and our old acquaintance George Selby met, as real friends generally do after a long absence, wi'h mutual Satis¬ faction. Our lawyer thought sir Henry looked rather the better than the worse for bis late severe campaign, observing, he had been very kind in giving up the other apartments for a night-, still he was very
angry with the waiter for having taken the liberty to engage them, when they wtre in a manner already let Moniingthorpe laughed at his displea sure, and while drinking their tea, m quired after colonel Fitzmaunce and his daughter SeİDj told him where they had taken up their abode, he had seen tbe colonel in the morning, and he understood tbe young ladies were going to the opera with lady Fitzmaunce, who had a box, and the co¬ lonel had resolved to accompany them by way 6T"protection, as it was expected the crowd would be immense He then re¬ verted to sir Henry's purchase, telling him that he was in daily expectation of seeing lord Wallingford, to put the final stroke to the business Mormngthorpe presumed the countess would accompany him to town " Miss Fitzmaunce said not, as she has removed from Bath to Clifton since she left her, and seemed to dread the fatigue whicli must attend a visit to the metropo lis at this juncture
" Is it supposed that her second mar¬ riage has greatly contributed to her feli¬ city 3 " Colonel Fitzmaunce shakes his head doubtfully when I have ventured to ask him the some question I can only rejoice her property is so stnctly secured to her ladyship that must prove a check upon the earl, and must insure her pohte treat¬ ment ' Politeness is a poor siiccedaneum for real regard, ' was the reply, when they paused upon heanng Mr and Mrs Dan¬ vers take possession of the front room, and as the earl first, and then Margaretta, tned the door of communication, which bad, as we have already related, been pro¬ perly secured on both sides, they thought it prudent to fall into more general dis¬ course respecting the late war, the restora¬ tion of the French king, each oiving his opinion of Blucher and Platoff, of whose bravery and military skill Mormngthorpe spoke with the enthusiasm of a soldier, while Selby eould onlv dwell upon the impression their figures, costume, and man- i 3
ners bad made upon hım, when their at¬ tention was drawn off by a noise and bus¬ tle on the stairs " I can assure you tbeie is no such per¬ son in the house, you must have been de¬ ceived " And I tell you, fellow, that ypu he, was the retort, m a voice rendered floaise by passion, " surely I can beheve my own eyes' ' Agam the waitei expostulated, and agam he was silenced by another voice sciiicely less stenton in than tht first, and thej found the paity, whoever they were, ascending the staus leading to both rooms " What can all tins mean ?

' Λ sort of scuffle now took place upon the landing —" I tell you this is a house of the first ıespectabılıty, cried the waitei While he was speaking, Moniingthorpe heard the bolt on tlie other side of the
doset-elcor withdrawn, and an effort made to force the lock, which not giving way, two or three gentle taps proclaimed tile person s wish to be admitted —" I smell я iät, cried belbv, more amused than alarm¬ ed, while Mormngthorpe, starting upon his feet, flew to the door—" I would not refuse even an enemy in distress forcing open the loek, when Margaretta, who never had looked moie beautiful, rushed pastlnm, ftintlj articulating—'Oh, save me ' pray save me ' mj father and my bro ther—I shall be muidered ' when, to our soldiers still greater amaze, be perceived this lovely girl was positively forced for¬ ward by the eail of Wallingford, who, had he caught sight of a basilisk, couicf not have appeired more confounded, since he ac- tuallj stept back into the closet upon per ceivmg who bad opened the door for them >io time vv as how evei allowed any of them to expiess their istonisbment, as the waiter having been overpowered, the enraged Mr Non is and his son forced their way into the front room, and ran to the closet call¬ ing—" Where is my daughter ? _" Wheie
is my sister '—She must be m this other room,' continued the brother, pushing the eorl, who stood in the door-way, forward but no lady met their eager glances The fact was, Selby, seeing Margaretta's un¬ feigned terror, had the presence of mind to point to а sofa near which he remained standing, under which she had crept so instantaneously, that when her pursuers expected to pounce upon her, she was nowhere to be seen The earl, who had given up all hopes of averting the discovery, was no less, though much more agreeably, surpnsed by her sudden disappearance Instantly recovering his presence of mmd, he asked the no less astonished waitei— ' What does all this mean ? who are these people in search of' why are my friends and I thus broken in upon ' Captain Norns, who knew the carl both peisonally and by reputation, felt more than ever eonvmctd that he was imph cated in Ins sisters elopement but not daring to accuse bim pomtblank in the presence of а man so highly lespected as sir Henry Momrngthorpe, whom he styled
his friend, he merely rephed—" Neither my name, profession, nor person can be stran¬ gers to your lordship, as I fought in the very battle which would have proved fa¬ tal to you, but for the interferente of sir Henry Mormngthorpe, 'to whom he bowed with the retpeit he thought his due " The fact is, my sister, who resides with my fa¬ ther at Channg, in the house once occu¬ pied by the late Dr Margram, eloped from home early this morning, my father pur sued her, and we had every reason to be¬ bt ve she was with a person answenngyour lordship s description, and that she was set down at this hotel " There can be no doubt of her having been here, cried the more impatient and less polished father " we learnt from the postillion who drove you into town, that you and my daughter, or her ghost, were at this hotel she must have made her escape, while we were coming round, by that door, pointing to the one leading towards the stairs " but I will stdl find her, if she is above ground " No person has left this room by that door, gentlemen, said Selby, anxious, upon
lady Wallmgfòrd's account, to bnng the peer out of this scrape, " since I have been with sir Henry Momrngthorpe, with whom I have spent more thon an horn I would therefore advise your taking a short time for consideration before you proceed m your search, since surely, admitting, as I make no doubt, your statements to be fact«, you are pursuing a strange method if you wish to reclaim the young lady " " She shall bitterly repent having led me this wild-goose chase, cried the angry and imprudent father " Can you α enture to affirm upon oath—you, sir,' tinning to the waiter, " that the earl of Walhngfoid did not bring a young girl here not more them half-ani-hour ago?" ,r The only lady vvho entered these doors to-day, sn, was a Mrs Danvers, I understood, she came with hei husband, as t supposed, or she would not have gamed admittance, and she is gone Had mv master or mistress been at home, they would have sent for thepeace-ofBcus when you forced your way up staus, as this is α house of the first respectability, and this
is tliefirst scene of tbe kind that has taken > place since I have lived here." " I make no doubt of its being so, nty friejsd," reptied the earl; " and if these gentlemen do, not leave the bouse ¡mme·' diately, I shall feel myself authorized to give them in charge ta the nearest consta¬ ble, or to call in the watch or patrol." ■ Norris, who was in liis soul a rank ι coward, was awed into obedience, while the presence of sir Henry, who never meddled ne the discourse, appearing, which was the fact, to considei! them unworthy of his notice, as he had learnt the father's cha¬ iacter from colonel Fitzmaurice, and knew tile souilmd givbn great offence tothe su¬ perior oflitieirs of his regiment, and'was suspected,of having inherited tbe father's cowardice ; the captain therefore thought it most prudent to sound a retreat, par- . ticuhuly ası the waiter, growing bold in proportion as they shrunk from prosecu¬ ting tlieir search, offered to take them into every room in the house, if nothing else would satisfy them. They therefore re¬ tired much more quietly, presuming, they told sir¡ Henry aud Selby/, to whortb alone
they addressed themselves, they must have been purposely deceived, feeling convinced, that had Margaretta been set dow n at this house, she had left it either before or since their entrance, as tliey did not doubt the truth of Selby's assertion. ' The waiter accompanied ' them to the door, resolving not to admit them again, except they returned with reinforcements ; feeling convinced that Mrs. Danvers was still secreted in one or other of the draw¬ ing-rooms, and resolving, should she not speedily take her departure, to insist, as matters had turned out, upon her leaving the house. Meanwhile, the young lady had emerged from her hiding-place, when, sobbing as it' her heart would break, she threw herself upon the sofathat had proved her safeguard, declaring she was ruined and undone, since, having heard the earl's name and title, she knew he was a married man—of course, she felt convinced that she should never become a countess through his means, and had merely risked her reputa¬ tion, present and future happiness, by her elopement with such а stranger, who en-
deavoured to pacifj her, telling her he would make some provision for her, if her father refused to receive her She soon convinced him that her spint ot romance had all evaporated in her fears for dear self, as she called him all the names which her indignation suggested, declaring she would expose ins baseness to the whole world Bewddered, and a prey to the most un- pleasmg sensations, the gallant earl re¬ quested sir Henry, who had continued a mute spectator of the passing events, to grant him a few minutes' audience in the next room, since, aware of his intimacy with colonel Fitzmaunce, and knowing that Selby would be solely guided by his wishes, he was anxious to exonerate him¬ self from having wilfully withdrawn the weak Mai-garetta from Charing, requestmg Selby would endeavour to pacify the weeping girl, and induce her to come to some speedy determination, since the sooner they separated the better « Wretch ' base, ungrateful deceiver '" cried the irritated Margaretia, till Selby lowered her tone by making her recollect
that her silly rage would merely injure her¬ self; while the peer, having closed the door between the rooms, acknowledged that appearances were very much against him, endeavouring to discover Morningthorpe's opinion of' tho recent scene by the turn of his countenance. He felt the expreseion of contempt which beamed in his large, daik, and sparkling eyes, but did not choose to notice it, tliough it confused his idens. —" I never was so strangely situated; I Would not have the countess tjear of thii silly business for ρ we than I am worth, though she has too much sense not td make allowances for the temptation which was thrown in my way. I never saw the idiot in the next room, till she came across my path about a fortnight ago at Charing, where I went to sign some papers ; she was then ready to throw herself into my arms, but 1 escaped her lures, and had for¬ gotten such a, half-witted being was in existence, till the night hefore last, busi- ness having again taken me to Southamp¬ ton, she unexpectedly crossed my path, and all· but asked me to take her under
my protection. I merely laughed at her, till I becarne her dupe, and agreed to take her to London, as she wished to see these great folks, and was, in short, all anxiety to leave а home whicli cannot be very pleasant, äs her fatlier has placed his mis¬ tress at the head of' his household, which must plead her excuse, even to you. All I now wish is, to get rid of her as quietly as possible: if she cottid return home be¬ fore İler father, that would' be her best plan. She will not, you perceive, listen to me-J-she may to your reasoning, and I shall think myself more indebted to you, if you can rid ine of this fool, than for having preserved my life, since the girl's reputation may be patched up, nnd lady Wallingford iiiay remain in ignorance of my folly, which certainly my age, situa¬ tion in life, and the real regard I bear her considered, has been inexcusable. I knmVIneèd noti even ask your secrecy, and I hope Mr. Selby will be equally in¬ clined to conceal my erreui s ttun montent, or rather,' mes egarèiAents du cœur'et de l'esprit." ' "'ïéârf'have nO right to aritígn your
lordship's conduct, and as you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade this certainly weak young woman to return to Charing, since she does not appear to have left her¬ self a choice; though I cannot suppose this escapade will render her home more com¬ fortable." " tihe must take her chance ; she has no one to blame but herself; so pray go and endeavour to make her listen to reason." Moniingthorpe would willingly have avoided interfering in the business, but as there seemed to be no other way of hush¬ ing the matter up, for the deluded girl's sake, and to spare the countess's feelings, he retreated to enter upon his unpleasant task. He found Selby reasoning with her, upon her determination to expose the vile wretch, as she called his lordship.— " Would you feel more happy, or would the world acquit you, fair lady," asked our soldier, in a mild persuasive tone, " admitting you could prove the earl has in some respects deceived you? Were you not rather to blame to listen to such a total stranger, and whose age must have led you to suspect he was a,,married man?
Your youth and beauty will plead power fully in excuse for his deviation from truth " What he has brought you ovti to lus side su, and made you believe I was to blame ' So I was, to place any confidence in such a deceitful villain As for his mo¬ ney, I could throw it at his head I only wish I was again at Channg but then how can I get there? Yet should my father and brother come here agam, that would be vvoi se if the wretch had not promised marriage, I should not have been so easily duped I only wish I had never set eyes on lum ' I dare say he might say the same, as jom beauty appears to have turned his brun but if you will swear to keep your own counsel, and never to expose the earl, lor the sake of his amiable wife, of whom you must have heard, and may have seen, I thmk all may yet be well " " Well, let me hear what you have to propose, sir I have heard of and seen lady W allingford, and I should be blamed, I know, at Charing, if I was, out of revenge, to make her miserable *
" You would be generally despised, and supposed to have been consenting to the eail s plans, tberefore return home imme¬ diately , you will reach Channg long be¬ fore your father and brother will probably think of returning thither, and surely you can frame some excuse for having left home w ithout leave ?" " A postchaise and four will whisk you down in no time,' cried Selby, anxious to second sir Henry s views, " I will have one ready in twenty minutes at farthest, and I will send a very clever youth with you as a guard " " Who shall pay all youi expences," cried Moniingthorpe, "therefore do not hesitate, since your evciy hope of con¬ signing your elopement to oblivion de¬ pends upon your speedy retui n to Cha¬ ring" " Well, sir, as I never wish to see that deceitful lord again, I will do as you desire what tune shall I reach Channg?" " It has just struck ten," repued Selby , " you may be at Channg by five to-mor¬ row morning " " Then I am sure Mary would admit
nie —I could easily stop her mouth, so the sooner I am upon the road the better, my bundle is m the other room But I dare not drive to the door in a postchaise " " Thin stop it where you think pioper the youth I mentioned, who is an articled cleik of raine, shall attend y ou home, only remember, upon your silence depends ours—if уоц ever mention loid \\ ailing ford but as a stiangir, neither sir Iluirj Moimngthoipe, the present owner, you know, of tlic A bbej, not myself, shall think ourselves bound to conceal where vve met jou, tVc' " Ob, I will take my Bible о ith, if you ltqune it, gtntlimcn, never to mention my loid again, though I shall alw ays thmk lnm α dettitful old villain ' "Thoughts ait lree," cntd the smiling Siili) , sci/ing his hat, " in less than half¬ an hom I shall be at the comer of----- court, with the chaise and my cleik but I w ill cotue for you, as I shall leeonnoitic since, if the cu ist ıs not dear, vve must en deavoui to elude the notice of whoever mav be m waiting " The winter, vvho purposely gave him
the meeting, hoped the lady w as going, as it would be his nun were she to remain all night after what had passed, his master was so particular " She is going immediately, so only keep your own counsel, and all will be well,' putting a pound note in his hand 1 he man was satisfied, and fortunately sir Henry and Selby were alone pnvy to the little fracas, as the family who occu¬ pied the ground floor was from home, and the female, who ought to have remained in charge as well as the waiter, had just stepped out, and had not jet found her way home, therefore no one but the waiter (whose fears of the consequences had prevented lum from mentioning the circumstance) knew vvho Mr and Mrs Danvers were, and what had followed their arrival END Or voi IV

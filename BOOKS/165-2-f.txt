VALPERGA.
CHAPTER I. Conference of Castruccio and Galeazzo Viscon¬ ti—of Castruccio and the Bishop of Ferrara. WHEN Castruccio and Euthanasia arrived at Florence, they found the citizens celebrating a festival : the bells were ringing ; the country people were flocking into the town ; and the youths of both sexes, of the higliest rank, and richly dressed, were parading the streets, cover¬ ed with wreaths of flowers, and singing the poems of Dante, or his friend Guido, to the ac¬ companiment of many instruments. Castruccio said : " I must ask you, fair Euthanasia, who are so learned in Florentine customs, to inform me of the meaning of titis gaiety." " Indeed, I am entirely ignorant I know that during peace joyful meetings take place VOL, П. В
every May, among the young nobility ; but this seems a general festivity. Let us ask that grave gentleman in the black capuchin, if he knows tiie reason of a merriment, which at least has not communicated itself to his face." The man, on being asked, replied : " You must be but lately arrived, not to have heard of the cause of our rejoicings ; the Florentines* Madonna, are celebrating the occurrence of a most favourable omen with which God and St. John have blest our city. Yesterday one of the lionesses kept at the expence of the repub¬ lic, brought forth five whelps." " And is this the momentous occasion of so much serious amusement ?" asked Castruccio, laughing· "My lord," said the man, "you are a stranger in this tow» ; »r you would not find cause for laugitter in this event. The Florentines keep a number of lions, as the signs and symbols of their strength ; and God and St. John have plainly manifested on many occasions, that the prosperity of Florence, and the welfare of the lions arc bound together. Three of the finest and largest died on the eve of the fatal battle of Motite Catini."
"So these wise republicans, whom you, dear Euthanasia, so much vaunt, believe in these childish omens. I would wager my best charger, that their records are full of the in¬ fluence of stars, and the appearance of co¬ mets ! " 44 And I do not at all know that you would lose : indeed their noblest citizens have a great faith in astrology and portents. If you speak of a scarcity, they will tell of a meteor ; if you say that the king of France has lost a battle, they will assure you that the whole kingdom has become, by the will of God and St. John, weaker and more miserable, ever since Phi¬ lippe le Bel seized upon the Florentine usurers. We love to find a cause for every event, be¬ lieving that, if we can fit but one link to an¬ other, we are on the high raad for discovering the last secrets of nature. You smile at tlie celebration of the birth of these lion's whelps ; yet I own that it pleases me ; how innocent, yet how active, must the imagination of that peo¬ ple be, who can find cause for universal joy in such an event ! 44 It is this same imagination more usefully В %
and cajmciously employed, that makes them decree the building of lhe most extensive and beautiful building of modern times. The men who have conceived the idea, and contributed their money towards the erection of the Duomo, will never see its completion ; but their poste¬ rity will, and, if they be not degenerate, will glory in the noble spirit of their ancestors. Marry years ago, when the Florentines warred with the Siennese, they took by storm a tower of great strength, vvhich commanded a ^^st important pass. They destroyed the tower ; and, when half demolished, they filled İt up witii earth, and planted there an olive tree, which still flourishes, an emblem of the peace which would follow their conquests." Castruccio staid only a few days at Florence ; . arKİ/*r^Offîmending himself to the constancy atftiiove of Euthanasia; he took an affectionate iea^e of^beiy and hastened on his journey to Kovigo, where he had promised to join Gale¬ azzo Visconti. ' * Galeazzo, havkig now succeeded to his fa¬ ther in the tyranny of Milan, was the most powerful chief of Lombardy. He was about
thirty-five years of age : he had all the charac¬ teristics of an Italian face, arched "brows, black eyes, an aquiline nose, and a figure where there was some strength and little grace. He had a great portion of talent, quickness in the combi* nation of plans, yet not sufficient patience to watch their progress, or perseverance to carry them through. He was crafty, ambitious, and vain ; yet, where his own interests were not concerned, he was good-natured, and on all occasions exceeded even the Italians in the courtesy of his demeanour. He had seen much of the world, and sufiered many misfortunes ; this gave him a pliancy of disposition, as well as of manner, which made him appear more kind-hearted than he really was ; for in truth he never for a moment lost sight of hisown in¬ terest ; and, if he sometimes wandered fmm the path which led to its attainment, want of judge¬ ment, and not of inclination, caused the error. He wished to attach Castruecio to his party and designs. He saw in him the head of the Ghibeline faction in Tuscany, and the tamer of his Florentine enemies. He felt that his own situation was precarious ; but, if he could gain
Castruccio for his ally, lie hoped lo awe jus er^mbs. More than ull, he desired the de¬ struction ef tibe Guelph strong-hold, Florence ; ana Castruccio was to become its destroyer. He heard of his peace witii that city with dis¬ may ; he trusted it could not last ; but the very name of it blasted his hopes. He wished to see the censul, and to win him to the plan vvhich he had conceived would conduct to the full ascendancy of the Ghibelines ; and, cir¬ cumstances leading him to Rovigo, he had in¬ treated Castruccio to visit him there, making the intended restoration of Ferrara to the marquess of Este the pretence of this request. The friends met with every demonstration of regard. Galeasao watched with care every word, by which Castruccio might reveal his intentions, before he would venture to commu¬ nicate his own wishes. Their first topic of conversation was the immediate business be¬ fore them, tiie restoration of the marquess Obizzo to the sovereignty of Ferrara. * This town," said Galeazzo, *' which so long obeyed the Este family, is now in the hands of the Guelphs, and tiie vicar of the Pope, with a
couple of hundred Gascon soldiers for a gar¬ rison, keeps possession of î t. The people, Ikeced by the excellent policy of the Roman court whose first, second, and thud maxim is to fill its own coffers, eagerly desire the restoration of their rightful prince* We have often thought of besieging the town ; but that would be a long and expensive business, and even its suc¬ cess would be doubtful ; for, if the Ghibelines raised tlieir war-cry, all the Guelph foxes would unearth themselves and have at them, and you know that our lands are much overstocked by this vermin· Stratagem is a surer and a far easier mode of warfare, and not half so bloody as the regular way ; we have so many friends within the walls, that 1 doubt not we should succeed, if a proper communication w T ere es¬ tablished between us» The bishop, who, though a churchman, is our sure friend, sent us a message some days ago, which, although mystically woided, seemed to say that he would betray tiie town into our hands, if we would commission one of our chiefs to treat with h¿m ; for he refused to disclose his project to an un-
derľmg. Now, you, my good friend, must un¬ dertake this task ; we are all of us too well known to get admission into the city ; but a slight disguise will take you safely past their guards, and î doubt neither of the bishop Marsilio's power or inclination." Castruccio acceded to his friend's request ; and in the evening he was introduced to the marquess of Este, who received him with de¬ ference and distinction. - The next morning, when he and Galeazzo rode out together, Galeazzo said : u 1 am sure, my dear Castruccio, I can never shew myself sufficiently grateful for your kindness in quit¬ ting Lucca at my request, and wandering away from your government; whicii ï ardently hope Will not sufîèr from your absence. But I feel less remorse, since the truce you have con¬ cluded with Florence must afford you some leisure.** " Not a truce, but a better thing ; I have concluded a peace." " Aye, a truce, or a peace ; it is the same thing ; either will be sufficiently short-lived."
w Are you then so deep-read in the couq^eh of the enemy, that you know how and when this peace will change to war ? " ^ " 1 am deep-read in nothing, my friend, but the |K>iitics and changes of Italy; and I have sufiered by them enough, and mixed with them sufficiently, to foresee their issue a long way off* Fire and water will make as kindly coalition as Guelph and Ghibeline, Bianchi and Neri. Their interests are at war, and theretbre so must they be. But why do I say this to you, who have every prospect of being Imperial Vicar in Tuscany; and think you that peace is the pilot to that haven f " u My dear Galeazzo, let us understand one another; I am a Ghibeline, faithful to my party and the emperor ; and, if í thought there were a fair chance of suppressing the Neri, by the Holy Face of Lucca*, I would make a cru¬ sade against them, such as has not been seen in the world since the days of Saladin. Let the emperor come to Italy, and something may be * A portrait of Christ, said to have been painted by Nieodemus. В 5
done ; but why carry on a petty warfare» whkh destroys Ûm country, and starves the peasant, while it hardly takes a florin from die coffers of the Florentine merchants, or advances us one inch nearer the goal we desire to reach ŕ " **And is tliia the end of the dreams of triumph and dominion with which you entered Lucca three years ago ? And sow that you have the government of that town of oranges and lemons, the mighty aim of your life is ac¬ complished, aad you are ready to sleep upon your acquisition, calling yourself a great man: " "Is truth there is little time or place to sleep at Lucca. Do you tliink that 1 shall be idk, while a dozen rebel castles hold out against me which must be subdued ? Let me conquer them Erst ; let me see no enemy for many miles round ; and then we will talk of Florence." " Nay, my friend, you must leave nothing to the decision of circumstances; a wise man foresees and provides for all. Florence must one day be yours ¿ and you, prince of Tuscany, of Italy, if you will, will give laws to us all* Do not start ; among so many prophecies as we have of Merlin and the rest, I venture to
make ose more ; and, üke most others, let in announcsement contribute to its completion. My dear Castruccio, this is tm child's play ; for men are both our die and our stake : put forth your hand, and you must win» 1« Lom¬ bardy the Ghibelines flourish; but, except Pisa, artd your Lucca, the Guelphs domineer throughout Tuscany. But tiiis must not con¬ tinue ; the Popes are out of Italy, and Rome, become a mere, resort of robbers, is a blank in our account Naples and Florence are our only enemies ; the emperor must conquer our, and you the other. Let all your efïôrts tend to that ; you talk of rebel castles near Lucca,-— aye, subdue those first, that without dread yon may hunt down the Florentines ; let your will lie as a wind to drive all Wore it ; at first, it will pause, collecting its force in the horizon ; and then it breaks forth sweeping every thing along with it: Florence must fall before it—I swear it shall ; but give me your hand, your faith, Castruccio, and swear tiiat you аЫ> will have it so." 44 Nay, by the Virgin ! I will not be back¬ ward in doing my part to tame the cubs of this
wild lioness: if Florence ever can be mine, she shall, and may God's will and your рпь phecy be fulfilled." 44 That is weih— At present you are at peace with them ; but it must be a peace to crush, and not to invigorate them. You are freshly en¬ tered into your lordship, your authority is new, perhaps unstable ; but form your troops, be a prince among your own people, and then fall upon these enemies of all princes. Oh 1 be¬ lieve me, give up this old fashioned name of consul ; it is tainted by the idea of that which I abhor—a commonwealth : make yourself a prince, and then so pure and ardent a hatred of Florence will arise in your mind, that you will not need my spurring to ride them to their destruction. The contagion of liberty ia dan¬ gerous ;—the Ghibelines must fall in Lucca, if the Guelphs be not destroyed in Florence. Think you$ if your people are allowed free in¬ tercourse with this republic, that the plague of liberty will not spread to your state ? For no quarantine will eradicate that spot, if once it, has entered the soul : -plots,· rebellions will be formed against you ; Florence, the watchword,
the rallying point for all. Choose; for that choice alone is kft you, to quell that city, or depart once more to exile." These were the lessons with wliich Gale¬ azzo awakened the latent flame in the soul of C<astruccio ; a flame, covered, but not extin¬ guished, and vvhich now burned more fiercely than ever. He swore the destruction of the Guelphs, and interminable war to Florence; and his blood flowed more freely, his eyes shone brighter, his soul was elevated to joy, when he tliought that one day he might be the master of tiiat proud city. In the mean time the marquess of Este oc¬ cupied their attention ; and Castracelo pre¬ pared for this embassy to the bishop of Fer¬ rara. He took no papers with him that might be dangerous, if discovered ; but, habiting him¬ self like a merchant from Ancona, and taking such documents as might enable him to sup¬ port this character, he left Rovigo for Ferrara, which was about twenty miles distant, and en¬ tering that town at ten o'clock in the morning lie hastened, unquestioned by any, to the epi¬ scopal palace. The bishop was an old man of
the most] benign physiognomy, and a sweet, mild tone of voice ; he was tail, and upright in figure, with an air of dignity and benevolence, that won, yet awed every one; his temples were slightly shaded by his silver locks, and his white beard, reaching to his girdle, increased the dignity of his appearance. Castruccio, who by his intercourse with the world had learned al¬ ways to honour age, approached him with re¬ spect, and disclosed to him his rank and mis¬ sion. The bishop replied ; *' My поЫе lord, the marquess has done that which I have long desired, in sending to me one fe> whom 1 may intrust the important se¬ cret, which I do not doubt will be the means of his re-establishment in his government. This evening my friends will assemble at my palace ; with their counsel all shall be arranged, the means disclosed to you by which I propose to deliver Ferrara into the hands of its rightful prince, and the day fixed for the commence¬ ment of the enterprize/* The bishop and Castruccio continued to- < gethef the whole day, both mutually dehghted with each other; and, as is often the case
w here sympathy of opinion and seeüng exist*, they Ъеешве as intimate in a few hours, as in other circumstances an intercoufse of year? would have dfected. Castruccio Ш « grea« taste for theological knowledge, avid the bishop, as a man of the work!, was delighted with the conversation and remarks of one who bad pass¬ ed tiirough so many scenes, and visited so many nations. Confidence quickly arose between them ; so well did each seem to understand the feelings and character of the other. The bishop was a Ghibeline ; but his motives were pure: his indignation at the corruptions of the Papal court, and his disapprobation of the fee* tion and brawls which appeared to him inse¬ parable from a republic, attached him strongly to the Imperial party, and to those lords who, reigning peacefully over a people who loved them, seemed to him to ensure the quiet of Italy. in the evening the partisans of tiie marquess of Este assembled at the episcopal palace to deliberate on tlieir projects. Castruccio was introduced among them, and received with cordiality and respect by all. The assembly
consisted of nearly the whole nobility of Fer¬ rara, chiefly indeed Ghijjelines, but there were even some Guelphs, disgusted by the introduc¬ tion of foreign troops, and the haughtiness sfuHyratrøy of their governors. The govern¬ ment however was formidable ; they possessed tlie gates, and the fortress ; their armed guard was numerous and faithful ; and the restoration of» Obizzo could be achieved by stratagem alase. * In one corner of the vast apartment in which the assembly sat, were two women. One was old, and dressed in the fashion of an age gone by : she was in black as a widow ; lier vest was close and strait, trimmed with beads, and made of black cbth ; a black veil covered her head, and her capuchin thrown aside discovered. the years and wrinkles of the venerable wearer. It was impossible to judge ofthe age, and hard¬ ly ofthe sex, ofthe figure that sat beside.her; for her capuchin was wrapped closely round her form, and the hood drawn over her face, as she sat silently, turned away from the com¬ pany, İn the darkest part of the room. The bishop at length addressed Castruccio:
44 My lord," said he, " you now possess the details of our plan, and may perceive toe sin¬ cerity of our intention, and the eagerness of our desire to receive again our rightful prince : it alone remains to shew you the secret en¬ trance of which I spoke, and to fix the day for our attempt." The old ladj, who had been hitherto silent, now turned quickly round, and said : u My brother, Beatrice ought to name the fortunate day on which we may undertake this work* Speak, my child, and may the holy Yifgin ia- spire.your wonda l ľ As she spoke, she threw back the hood of her young companion ; and Castruccio gazed on her exquisite and almost divine beauty. Her deep black eyes, half concealed by their heavy lids, her curved lips, aud face,formed in a perfect oval, the rising colour that glowed in her cheeks which, though her complexion was pure and delicate, were tinged by the suns of Italy, formed a picture such aa Guido has since imagined, when he painted a Virgin or an Ariadne, or which he copied from the life when he painted the unfortunate Beatrice
Cenci. Herjet hair fell in waving luxuriance от hør neck and shoulders below hér waist ; and a small silver plate was hound by a white uband on her forehead. CasL uccio could only gase for a moment on tiiis- lovely being ; iSor, turning a supplicating look on her aged friend, she again drew the hood over her face, speaking 'm so low a tone, that he could not distinguish the words she uttered ; the elder lady acted as interpreter, and said : " Beatrice iiifcreats you not to fix the day until to-morrow, and then she hopes, hy the grace of God and the Virgin, to name such a one as will bring your enterprize to an happy issue/' ■ Castruccio turned quickly round to see what effect these words woukl produce upon the iüushop ; ha thought that he saw a slight smile of derision hover en tiie old man's Up; hut he replied t " Be it so ; ray lord Castruccio, you will accompany my sister, Madonna Marche¬ sana, to her palace; she will disclose to you the secret entrance, and acquami you witii the means hy which you may und it, when you return with the marquess Obizzo and his ţrooos.'î
The assembly broke up ; and Castruccio foi* lowed Madonna Marchesana and her beauti¬ ful companion* His horse was brought to the door ; they mounted their white palfreys, and attended by several esquires and pages carry ing torches, arrived at a magnificent palace close to the eastern gate of Ferrara. When they had entered, Madonna Marchesana dismissed her servants, and led Castruccio into a room, hung with tapestry, and furnished with the rich and heavy furniture of the age. She hoed up the hangings ; and, while Castruccio supp ported them, she pushed back a pannel iu the wainscot, and discovered a long, dark gallery ; then, taking up a torch that lay within, and lighting it at & lamp which hung from the ceil¬ ing of the room, she presented it to Beairice, saying : " Do you, my child, light us, and lead us the way, that success may attend our steps." A small snow white hand and taper wrist were put out from beneath the capuchin ; and Beatrice silently took the torch, aad led the way, along the gallery, down several flights of stairs, and then along numerous vaults
and corridors, until they arrived at what ap-
44 You, my lord/' said the lady Marchama, " fôušt. helft me/' She painted to a la*ge stone, which Castruccio rolled away, and discovered behind it a small, low door. The lady drew back the bolts, and bade Beatrice hide the light, which she did, placing it within a kind of recess in the passage that seemed formed for the purpose of receiving it; the lady then opened the door; and Castruccio, creeping out, tmmd himself in an open country, covered with bushes, and surrounded by marshy land, at some distance from the strong fortifications of tlie town. Castruccio smiled :" Ferrara is ours ! " he cried ; and the old lady with a oun- tenance expressive of dm greatest delight, said : Hi intreat you, mv ford, to lay my respectful submission and zealous .fidelity at the feet of the marquess Obizzo ; teil him the joy and triumph that I feel, in being the humble instru¬ ment.of. res toi ing him to his sovereignty and inheritance. , When you mention tiie name of the viscountess* dì- Maivesati he may distrust дну professions; since the viscount, my laté
husband, wai his hitter and determined ene* my* But he is no more: and I have' h#e» brought to a true knowledge of tlie wilt of God by this divine girl, this Amilla 1>ег, as she is truly called, who is sent upon earth for the instruction and example of suffering hu¬ manity." Castruccio listened with astonishment; while the gifted damsel stood, her face coVe^H by her cowl, and her arms crossed over her breast : the eyes of the old lady beamed with joy and pride. " I do not entirely fulfil my commis¬ sion," she continued, " until 1 have taught you how you may again discover this place* Do you see those straggling sallows that skirt that stagnant drain, and which, although they ap¬ pear to be without order, are the clue by which you will be guided thither ì Four miles distant fiora Ferrara, on the right-hand side of the road, you will find a mulberry tree, a poplar, and a cypress, growing close together ; strike from tiie road at that point, and follow the line of sallows, however they may lead, Until you come to that where the line ends. You
must then mark the drains of the marsh, re¬ membering to follow only those which are bordered by dwarf myrtles, and which tit every turn have a cross carved in a low stone on their banks ; tiiat line will lead you hither ; and you will stop at that cross of wood which you see half buried in the tall grass and bul¬ rushes, until this door is opened for yor trance/' The viscountess di Malvezzi repeated her instructions a second time in the same dlstii.et manner; and, finding that Castruccio fully ap¬ prehended them, she led the way back to her subterranean passages ; and with quick steps they regained the tapestried apartment. Bea¬ trice remained a moment behind to extinguish the torch ;*and, when she re-appeared, she had thrown off her capuchin, and shone in the fight of her divine beauty. Her dress was of the finest white woollen; nnd in fashion İt par¬ took of tiie usual dress of the age, and of the drapery of the antient statues : it was confined at her waist by a silken girdle, and fell about ■her figure in thick and rich folds; a golden
cross glittered upon her bosom, on which lay also the glossy ringlets of her hair ; <m the sil¬ ver plate bound to her forehead Castruccio could distinguish the words, Amilla Dei* Her black eyes beamed as with inspiration, and the wide sleeves of her veat discovered her white and veined arm, which she threw up in eager gesticulation as she spoke : " Mother, I promised that tomorrow £ would name the day for my sovereign's enter- prize ; I feel the spirit coming fast u pon me ; let this noble gentleman inform your revered brother, that tomorrow in tlie church of St. Anna I shall speak to my countrymen, and ¡u the midst of the people of Ferrara tell in veiled words the moment of their deliverance*" With a light step Beatrice glided out of the room, and the viscountess, not regarding the surprize of Castruccio, said to him : " Fail not, my lordp to convey the message of my Beatrice to the bishop. God has beeti gra¬ cious to us, in bestowing on us his visible as¬ sistance through this sacred maidea, who by her more than human beauty, the excellence
of her dispositions, and, above all, by herwis¬ dom beyond that of woman, and her prophe¬ cies which have ever been fulfilled, cLmoa- strates, even to the unbeliever and the Gentile, tliat she is inspired by the grace and favour of tlie blessed Virgin."
CHAPTER H. Barentage of Beatrice.-*»· S he is arrested by the Inquisition. Tilus dismissed, Castruccio returned, burning with curiosity and admiration, to the bishop. He delivered the message with which he had been intrusted, and then eagerly asked who this enchanting Beatrice really was, and if it were true that she was an angel descended upon earth for the benefit and salvation or man. The bishop smiled. " My lord," he replied, ц so much have you won my confidence and esteem, that I am will¬ ing to satisfy your curiosity on this subject also. But you must recollect, that neither my frister, nor even the lovely girl herself, knows what I shall now reveal, and that I shalktell it you under the most solemn vow of secrecy." Castruccio readily promised disci etion and silence, and the bishop then related the fol¬ lowing partícula) s. VOL. H. С
" Have you never heard of a heretic and most dangerous impostor, of the name of W il- helmina of Bohemia * i This woman appeared first in Italy in the year 1289 : she took up her íesidence at Milan, with a female compa¬ nion, called Magfreda. Outwardly professing the Catholic religion, and confoiming in the stí iciest manner to its i ules, she secretly formed a sect, founded on the ab&urd and damnable belief, that she wab the Holy Ghost incarnate upon earth for the salvation of the female sex. She gave out that ьЫ was the daughter of Constance, ^ ieen of Bohemia; that, as the angel Gal'iel had descended to announce the divine conception to the blessed Virgin, so the angel Raphael announced to her mother the meat nation of the Holy Spirit in favour of the iemale sex; and that she was bom twelve months after thn> heavenly annunciation. Her tenets w eie intended entirely to supersede tho>e oi our beloved Lord Jesus, and her friend Mag- Ireda wab to be papess, and to succeed to ail tho power and privileges of the Roman pon- * See Muiaturi, Antichrutà llaliaiic t No. 6ü.
tiff. Wilhelmina died in the }car U302 in the odour of sanctit}', and was buried in the church of St. Peter at Milan : she had led so holy a life, and kept her heresy so profound a secret, except from her own sect, that she was follow¬ ed as a fcaint, and even priests and dignitaries wrote homilies in praise of her piety, her abs¬ tinence, and modesty. 44 1 was at Milan two years after, when tlie Dominican inquisitors first discovered this lurking pestilence ; and the terror and abomi¬ nation of the discovery filled the town with horror. Magfreda, and her principal follower, Andrea S a rami ta, were led to prison; the other disciples who threw themselves on the mercy of the priests, being commanded to perform several pilgrimages, and give large alms to the church, were absolved, 1 had just then become a Padie, and filled the contes- hor*s chair : I was young, full of zeal, eloquent in the cause of truth, and tainted by an enthu¬ siastic bigotry against heretics and schisma¬ tics. I preached vvith animation against this new heresy; it appeared to me so impious, ы> absurd, so ten ifically w icked, that I was touched с Я,
-S by an'holy impulse as í declaimed against ib followers. Having thus distinguished myself, the father inquisitors intreated me to use my fervid arguments to persuade the obstinate Magfreda to recant. They had exhausted every reason, and had had recourse even to torture, to convert this woman from her damna¬ ble impieties ; but she with haughty insolence declared that she was in readiness to perish in the flames, but that her last hreath should be spent in the praise of her divine mistress, and an exhortation to her tormentors to repent and believe. " I was filled vvith worldly vanitv, and fen- cied that my learned sentences, my anathemas, and eloquent exorcisms could not fail of their desired effect, and that by the aid of God and truth I should be covered with tlie glory of success <in-this holy warfare. Thus secure, I entered the dungeon of the heretic ; it was a low, damp vault, where she had been confined for several weeks without even straw for her bed. She was kneeling in one corner, praying fervently, and for a moment I stopped to con¬ template a heretic, a monster I had never bc-
fore seen. She was au aged, respectable wo¬ man, in the dress of a nun, and vvith an appear¬ ance of sanctity and modesty that astounded tne. When she perceived mc, she rose, and said vvith a faint smile : * Is my condemnation parsed? or is a new scene of torture pre pared f ' ** * Daughter/ I replied, 4 1 come indeed to torture, not your body, but your mind; to torture it with a knowledge of itself ; to hold a mirror before it, wherein you will contemplate its blots and deformities, of vvhich by thegrare of the Virgin you may repent and be purified/ " ť Father, you are the master, I a slave, and I am willing to listen. But your benevo¬ lent countenance, so difierent from those to which I have been long accustomed, fills me vvith such confidence, that I dare hope for your indulgence, when 1 intreat you to spai e yourself a useless labour, and to leave in peace the labt hours of my life. 1 knovv that I пшЧ die ; and God and She know hew willing 1 am to expire for Her justification, even in pain and burning : but my spirit is worn, my patience, which 1 liase cherished vvith determined /eal,
as the sacred flame of my religion and the life of my heart, now begins to wane; do not bring on my soul the sins of anger and into¬ lerance ;—leave me to prayer, to repentance, and to my hopes of again seeing my beloved mistress, there where there is no sorrow/ " She spoke with dignity and mildness, so that I felt my spirit subdued ; and, although almost angry at the stubbornness of her im¬ piety, I followed her example in speaking with gentleness. Our conversation was long; and the more it continued, the more my animation in the cause of truth, and zeal for the conver¬ sion of the heretic, increased. For her man¬ ner was so sweet and winning, her words so soft yet firm, that it lay like a sin on my heart that I could not save her from eternal condem¬ nation. " ť You did not know Her/ she cried, ' you never saw my Wilhelmina. Ask those who have seen her, even the vulgar, whose eyes are horn, and whose hearts are stone, whether they were not moved to love and charity, when ?he passed like an angel among them. She was more beautiful than aught human could
be ; more gentle, modest and pious than any woman ever was, though she were a saint. Then her words possessed a persuasion that couid not be resisted, and her eyes a fire, that betrayed even to the unknowing ща* the Holy Spirit lived within her. \ " ' Father, you know not what you ask, when you desire me to leave my faith in her Divinity. I have felt my soul prostrate itself before her ; the very blood that vivifies my heart has cried to me, so that, if I had been deaf, I must have heard, that she was more than human. In my dreams I have seen her arrayed in divine light; and even now the sacred radiance that announces her presence fills my dungeon, and bids me for her sake submit with patience to all that ye, her enemies, can inflict.' "I repeat to you the mad words of Mag¬ freda, that you may judge of the excess of in¬ sanity that possessed this unfortunate woman. ï combated with the evil spirit within her for eight hours, but in vain ; at length I was re¬ tiring in despair, when she called me back. I returned vvith a look of hope, and saw that
she via» weeping violently and bitterly. As I approached, she seized my hand, and kissed it, and pressed it to her heart, and continued pouring forth, as it were, a fountain of tears. ï believed that she was now touched by true repentance, and began to thank divine mercy, when she waved her hand impatiently, beck¬ oning me to be silent. By degrees she calm¬ ed her tears ; but she was still agitated by pas¬ sion, as she said ; " Kneel, father, kneel, I in· treat you, and by the cross you wear swear secrecy. Alas ! if I die, another muvst perish -with me, one whom I have vowed to protect, one whom 1 bve far,—far beyond my own life/ She paused, endeavouring to overcome the tears, that, in spite of herself, she shed : I comforted her, and pronounced the desired oath, when she became calmer. ' Father, you are good, benign and charitable ; and í do be¬ lieve that She has manifested Her will in send¬ ing you to me in my distress ; you, who are so unlike the wolves and harpies that have of late beset me. There Ì& a child—Her child :
»
—but, father, before I reveal fuither, promis me, swear to me, that she shall be educated in mv faith and not in yours.* 44 1 was indignant at this proposal, and said angi liy : ' Woman, think you that I will sacri¬ fice the soul of an infant to your monstrous unbelief and vicious obstinacy ľ I am a servant of the Lord Jesus, and, believe me, I will never discredit my holy calling/ " ť Must it be so? * she cried; ť yet grant me a few moments to resolve/ She knelt down, and prayed fervently for a long time ; and then arose with a smiling aspect, saying : ' Father, you wish to convert me ; methinks at this moment I could convert you, if indeed faith did not come from God, and not from the human will. She has re¬ vealed Her will to me, and by Her command I now confide to you the treasure of my soul. 44 4 Two years before the death of Wilhel¬ mina, she had a child. I cannot tell you who was the father of this child ; for, although I be¬ lieved that her conception partook of the divi¬ nity, she never confirmed my faith, or said aught againbt it : but with her heavenly smile С õ
bade me wait until the hour of knowledge should arrive. 1 alone knew of the birth of this infant; and it has ever been under my care ; it was brought up in a cottage five miles hence by a good woman, who knew not to whom it belonged ; and I visited it daily, gazing with wonder on its beauty and intel¬ ligence. " f After its birth Wilhelmina never saw it. She always refused to visit the cottage, or to have it brought to her, but would sit for hours, and listen to my descriptions and praises. I have ever believed that this separation, what¬ ever was its cause, shortened the life of my divine mistress ; for she pined, and wept; and faded like a flower unwatered by the dews of heaven. The last words she uttered, were to recommend her infant to my care. I have ful¬ filled my task, and now, by her command, de¬ liver up my charge to you. " ť A year ago the nurse of the child died ; and I took her secretly to my own home, and tended her, and preserved her as her mother had commanded. No love can equal mine for the divinity, her mother : it İs a burning
afíection, an adoration, which no words can express :—I shall rever see her more, until wc meet in heaven, but I submit with patience to the will of God. " * When 1 heard that Andrea Saramita and our other disciples were taken, I was trans¬ ported with terror for the fate of this infant. I expected every moment to hear the steps of the blood-hounds on the stairs, to seize me, and discover this flower of paradise, which I che· rished thus secretly. W hen suddenly a thought, an inspiration, came over me, and I cried aloud, Better are the wild beast of the forest, and the tempests of heaven, even when they shake us most ; better are plague and famine, than man hunting after prey ! So I took the infant in my arms, a small purse of gold, and a bag of such provisions as I had in the house; and, it being already dark, 1 hastened from Milan to the forest that skirts the road to Como : I walked fast, and in two hours arrived at my goal. I knew that one afflicted with leprosy 1 *
* This disease was then common in Italy. The pt rson affected'with it, was accustomed to retire and dveeìì in
lived in the depth of the forebt, a miserable wretch, who with his wooden spoon and plat¬ tet, collected alms at the road side. Thither 1 went fearlessly ;—mistake me not ; this man i> not my disciple, he had never seen me be¬ fore ; but I knew not whether the blood- hunters weie acquainted with the existence of the divine child, this I knew, that they would bot dare seek her in a leper's dwelling. I dreaded not the contagion ; for is not her mo¬ ther above all the saints in heaven ? " 4 I wandered long among the tangled paths of the wood, ere I could discover his hut; the babe slept, cherished near my heart, vvhich bled vvith anguish. To me in all the world there existed but this little creature, the earth seemed to reel under me ; yet still 1 felt her vv arm breath upon my bosom, and heard the regular heaving of her gentle breast. At length
a pave in a forest, from whence he resorted to the n ad-sidc, arid with beating a wooden spoon upon 4. loiter, demanded alms of travellers, which, when t'.ov were retired to a convenient distance, he came am) took from a stone upon which it was to be depo- ь Ы.
I found the cavern of the leper : it was halt- built in the earth v hilt against vvhicli it rested 3 and half of the boughs of trees plasteied with mud, which was hardened in the sun ; black, dilapidated, and filthy, it was worse than a manger for the reception of my poor innocent. " * The wretched possessor of this sty slept on his miseiable straw as I entered. I roused him, put gold into his hand, and, placing food before him, I said------Protect this child, and God will reward you. Feed it, wash it, and above all keep it from the sight of man : deli¬ ver it not except to one who may come to a^k for it in the name of the Holy Wilhelmina. In one month I hope to return for it, and will re¬ ward you as you have obeyed ray charge.«—I then, with a heart bursting with agony, em¬ braced the daughter of my Wilhelmina for the last time : I blest her, and tore myself aw 7 ay. " ' I have now been five weeks imprisoned, and I dread lest the leper should have thrust her from his abode. Will you not, father, preserve and love this child ? ' "The discourse of Magfreda moved me •strangely. 1 felt a wonder, a pity, an excess
of commiseration, I couid not express : but kissing the cross I wore, I said ; * Listen to me, unhappy woman, while I swear never to de¬ sert this innocent ; and may God so help me, as I keep my faith ! ' " Magfreda poured forth warm and joyful thanks ; then, with a heavy heart, I recom¬ mended her to the mercy of God, and left her dungeon. " As soon as I could tear myself from the questions and childish curiosity of the inquisi¬ tors, I hastened to the place that Magfreda had indicated. In the tumult of my soul, I only thought of the danger of the lovely babe in the hands of this outcast of man and nature. I was possessed with a passionate sense of pify, which I cannot now explain, but for which 1 do not reproach myself; at length, about four miles from the town, I heard the sound of the beggar as he struck his platter with his spooîi in token of his wants, and I turned aside from the road to seek him. At that mometit the spirit of God almost deserted me, and I was overcome by fear ------ the fear of disease, and a nameless horror at the expectation of meeting
one whom all wholesome life had deserted : but I made the sign of the cross, and approach¬ ed. The wretch was seated under a tree eat- ııitç some crusts of bread; miserable, filthy, defouned, his matted hair hung over his eyes and his ragged beard half concealed the lower part of his visage; yet there was to be seen a savage eye, and an appearance of brutal fero¬ city, that almost staggered me. 1 made a sign that he *hou!d not approach, and he dropped on his knees, and began to gabble pater-nosters, чл) that the word that God himself had spoken seemed the jargon of the devil. I stopt at some distance from him : ť Bring me/ I cried, * to the child who was confided to you in the name of Wilhelmina of Bohemia/ " The wretch, who had almost forgotten hu¬ man speech, jumped up, and led the way among the tangled underwood, along savage paths, overgrown with rank herbage, and be¬ strewn with stones, tili wo came to his misera¬ ble hut,—a low, dark, squalid den, which I dared not enter; * Bring me the child,'·—! cried. " Oh ; it was a woful sight, and one wliich
to death f shall remember, to see this child, this morning star of beauty and exceeding brightness, with eyes shilling vvith joy, losy lips melted into the softest smiles, her glossy hair strewn upon her lovely neck, her whole form glowing with the roseate hues of life, led by the leper from his hut ; his body wrapt in a ragged blanket, his grizzly hair stretched stiffly out, and his person and face loathsome beyond words to describe. The lovely angel took her hand from his, and coming up to me, said : ť Take me to mamma ; lead me from this ugly place to mother/ <4 This was Beatrice ; and need I say how much 1 have ever loved this hapless girl, and cherished her, and tried to save her from the fate to which her destiny has hurried her ? " I returned to Milan, and found that in the morning, while I had been absent, Magfreda had been burnt, and her ashes scattered to the winds, so that I had become this poor babe's only guardian. I placed her under the care of a pensioner of the church in the neighbour¬ hood of Milan ; and when I was promoted to the, sec of Ferrara, I brought her with røe, and
intreated my siôter to receive her, and cherish her as her v.vn. The lovely little being won all hearts, and Marchesana soon became at¬ tached to her with maternal fondness. She was educated in the Holy Catholic faith ; and 1 hoped that, untainted by her mother's errors, she would lead an unblamed and peaceful life, unmarked and unknown ; God has ordered it otherwise. 44 Beatrice was always an extraordinary chiid. When only six and seven years of age, she would sit alone for hours, silently contempla¬ ting ; and, when л I asked her of what she thought, she would weep, and passionately de¬ sire me not to ask her. As she grew older, her imagination developed; she would sing extempore hymns with wild, sweet melody, and she seemed to dwell with all her soul on the mysteries of our religion ; she then became communicative, and told me how for hours she meditated upon the works of nature, and tlie goodness of God, till she was filled vvith a .sen¬ timent tlwt overwhelmed and oppressed lur, so that she could only weep and sigh. She intreated me to unfold to her ail í knew, and
to teach her to read in the sacred book of our religion. 44 1 was fearful that her ignorance and en¬ thusiasm might lead her astray, since, in her accounts of her meditations, she often said things of God and the angels that were here¬ tical; and I hoped that a knowledge of the truth would calm her mind, and lead her to a saner devotion. But my labours had a con¬ trary effect ; the more she heard, and the more she read, the more she gave herself up to con¬ templation and solitude, and to what I cannot help considering the wild dreams of her ima¬ gination. It seemed to me as if her mother'* soul had descended into her; but that, regulated by the true faith, she had escaped the dam¬ nable heresies of that unhappy woman. She delighted to read, and pretended to explain the prophecies of the sacred writings, and the mo¬ dern ones of Merlin, the abbot Joachim and Methodius: beside these studies, she grew wonderfully familiar with all vulgar supersti- titions, holy trees and fountains, lucky and un¬ lucky days, and all the silly beliefê that jugglers and impostors encourage for their own profit.
Ai length she began to prophesy ; some of her prophecies were interpreted аз true, and since that time her fame has been spread through Ferrara. Her followers are numerous; and my poor sister is the first of her disciples : Bea¬ trice herself is wrapt up in the belief of her own exalted nature, and really thinks herself the Aneilla Dei, the chosen vessel into wliich God has poured a portion of his spirit : she preaches, she prophesies, she sings extempore hymns, and entirely fulfilling the part of Dorma Estatica # , she passes many hours of each day in solitary meditation, or rather in dreams, to which her active imagination gives a reality and life which confirm her in her mistakes, "Thus, mylord, I have revealed the, birth * These inspired women first appeared in Italy after the twelfth century, and have continued even until our own day*. After giving an account of tlieir pre- t^nsions, Muratori gravely observes, ťí We may pic osly believe that some were distinguished by supernatural gift 4 , and admitted to the secrets of heaven ; but we may justly suspect that the source of many of their revelations, was their Anient imagination, filled with ukas of iciigiou and piety."
of this extraordinary girl, which is unknown to every one ebe. Why 1 have done this í can hardly tell; for £ have done it without preme¬ ditation or foresight. But I am glad that you know tlie truth ; for you seem humane and ge¬ nerous; and I wish to secure another protector for my poor Beatrice, if I were to die, and she fell into any misfortune or disgrace." CasUuccio and the good bishop passed al¬ most the whole night in conversation concern¬ ing this wonderful creature ; and, when the con- bul retired to rest, he could not sleep, while the beauty of Beatrice was present to his eyes, and her strange birth and fortunes to his memory. In .the morning he went to the church of St. Anna : mass was performed, but he looked in vain for the prophetess;—yet, when the ser¬ vice was finished, and the people assembled in lhe porch of tlie church, she appeared among them with her aged piotcctress at her side. She wore her capuchin of light blue silk, but her cow I was thrown back, and her eyes, black as the darkness which succeeds a midnight flash of lightning, full and soft as the shy ante¬ lope's, gleamed with prophetic fire.
She sp^ke ; hei words flow eil with rich and persuasive eloquence, and her energetic but graceful action added force to her expressions. She reproached the people for lukewarm faith, careless selfishness, and a want of fervour in thejust cause, that stamped them as the slaves of foreigners and tyrants. Her discourse was long and continued, with the same flow of words and unabated fervour : her musical voice filled the air; and the deep silence and attention of her numerous auditors added to the solem¬ nity of the scene. Every eye was fixed on her, —every countenance changed as hers changed ; they wept, they smiled, and at last became transported by her promises of the good that was suddenly to arise, and of the joy that would then await the constant of heart;—when, as this enthusiasm was at its height, some Domi¬ nican inquisitors came forward, surrounded lier, and declared her their prisoner. Until that moment Castruccio had observed her only,—her flashing eyes and animated manner; the smiles and then the tears, that, as the stin¬ gine and clouds of an April day, succeeded each other on the heaven of her countenance.
But, when the inquisitors surrounded her, her voice was silent, and the mute deference of the multitude was no more. All became cla¬ mour and confusion ; screams, vociferation, ejaculations and curses burst from every tongue;—they declared that the prophetess, the Aneilla Dei should not be torn from them, —she was no heretic,—of what crime had she been guilty I —The inquisitors had witli them a guard of Gascon soldiers, and this inflamed the multitude still more ; it was plain that her ad¬ herence to the party of the marquess Obizzo, and tlie prophecy of his restoration were her only crimes. The noise of her arrest spread through the town, and all Ferrara flock¬ ed to the church of St. Anna; the crowd, transported with rage, seemed prepared to re¬ scue the prisoner, who, silent and resigned, stood as one unconcerned in the animated scene. The people armed themselves with stimes, sticks, knives, and axes ; the inquisitors sent for a reinforcement of Gascon troops, and every thing appeared to menace violence, and bloodshed, when one of the priests attempted to take the hand of Beatrice as if to lead her
away ; she looked at hit, with a steady glance, and he drew back, while she made a sign as if about to speak, and the multitude hushed themselves to silence, and were as still, as wlien a busy swarm of bees, buzzing and flying about, all at once drop to silence, clinging round their queen, who is the mistress of their motions. She said, " I appeal to the bishop." " Yes, to the bishop,—to the good bishop ; he is just,—take her to Ыш,~~11е shall decide the cause." The inquisitors were prepared to resist this appeal : but tiie will of the people became a torrent not to be stemmed by them, and it hurried them away. They led the prophetess to the episcopal palace, surrounded by the Gascon soldiery, and followed by an immense multitude, which rent the sky with the cries of their auger and despair. Tlie bishop received the appeal with deep sorrow. Beatrice stood before him, her arms crossed on her breast, her eyes cast down ; but on her face, although the gentlest modesty was depicted, there was no trace of fear ; she
looked intrepid, yet as if she relied not on bet own strength, buton that of another. The in¬ quisitors accused her of being an impostor, a misleader of the people, a dangerous and wick¬ ed enthusiast, whom the penitence and solitude of a cloister must cure of her extravagant dreams. They talked long and loud, uninter¬ rupted either by the judge or the prisoner, al¬ though the lady Marchesana who stood near could not always restrain her indignation. At length they were silent; and Beatrice spoke : " You call me an impostor,—prove it ! 1 shrink from no trial, I fear no danger or tor¬ ture,—I appeal to the Judgement of God,— on that I rest the truth or falsehood of my mis¬ sion." She looked around her with her flashing eyes and glowing cheeks ; she was all loveliness, all softness; yet there was a spirit within her, which elevated her above, although it mingled vvith the feminine delicacy of her mind and manners, and wh'xh inspired ail who saw her with reverence and tenderness. But a small part of the multitude had found their way into the hall of the bishop's palace; but these could
no longer contain themselves ; thè Judgement of God was a thing suited to their vulgar ima¬ ginations, as a strange and tremendous my¬ stery, that excited their awe, their pity, and their admiration : they cried, " God can alone judge of this ! let the trial be made ! " and their screams overpowered every other sound. The inquisitors joined in the clamour, whether to consent or dissent it was impossible to distin¬ guish ; at length the scene became calmer, and the bishop interposed fm mild voice, but vain¬ ly,—the inquisitors* repeated the words, im¬ postor ! heretic ! madwoman ! and Beatrice disdainfully refused all composition. It was finally agreed, that she should be confined for that night in the convent of St. Anna, * and on the following morning, under the auspices of the monks of the adjoining monastery, should undergo the Judgement of God, to be pro¬ nounced guilty or innocent as that should de¬ clare. Both the inquisitors and Beatrice retired in security and triumph, followed by the multi¬ tude, who were careless of the dismay but too plainly painted on the faces ofthe prophetess's VOL. II. D
friends. The lady M archesana was in dread¬ ful agitation, fluctuating between her faith in the supernatural powers of Beatrice, and her dread lest the trial should bring ruin upon her : she wept, she laughed, she was in a state ap¬ proaching to madness ; until her brother, bid¬ ding her confide in God, soothed her to resig¬ nation and some degree of confidence. She then retired to pray, leaving the bishop and Castruccio overwhelmed vvith pity, horror, and indignation* Then the old man for the first time gave vent to his sorrow :—" Ill-fated victim h head¬ strong, foolish girl ! what are thy prophecies now? thy inspirations and divine aid? alas! alas ! the hand of God is upon thee, born in an evil day of a guilty and impious mother ! His wrath wraps thee as a cloud, and thou art consumed beneath it;—my love is as bitter ashes,—my hopes are extinct;—oh, that I had died before this day ! " Castruccio was at first too much confounded to offer consolation ; but, when he spoke, and bade his friend not despair, the bishop replied : " My lord, she has won my whole soul, and
all my affections; why this İs, I know not;-— is she not beautiful ? and she is as good as she is beautiful* She calls me father, and loves me with the tenderness of a child ; day and night I have offered up my prayers to God, not to visit on her the sins of her mother ;— for her sake I have fasted and prayed,—but all is vain, and she must perish." 44 IS ot so, father ; say not that so lovely a being shall perish under the fangs of these cruel hell-hounds. Do not, I earnestly intreat you, despair : flight İ flight is her only safety ; fa¬ ther, you have authority, and must save her. í wiil take charge of her, when she has quitted the walls of the convent, ar.d I will place her in safe and honourable guardianship. Let her fl.V»—by the sun in heaven she shall escapé 1 " The bishop remained silent for some time ; the same ardent blood did not warm his veins, which boiled in those of Castruccio : he saw all the difficulties ; he feared for the success of their scheme ; but he resolved to make the at¬ tempt. " You are right," said he ; " flight ь her only safety : yet it will be rather a rape, than a flight ; for willingly she will never con- D ΰ
sent to ilesert the high c ] aracter she has chosen to assume. Did you not mark her triumph, when the Judgement of God w-as agreed upon ч Mad, wild girl !—Let me consider our plan, and weigh our powers. The abbess is a Guelph ; but the abbot of the visiting monas¬ tery is a Ghibeline ; besides the edicts of the church pronounce against these temptations of God's justice. I will exert myself; and she may be saved." When night closed in, these two anxious friends, alone and wrapt up from observation, hastened to the monastery. Castruccio re¬ mained in the parlour ; and the prelate enter¬ ed the interior of the convent. He remained two hours ; while Castruccio, full of anxiety, continued alone in the pai lour, vvhicii looked on an interior court with no object to call off bis attention, in silent and anxious expectation. He thought of the beauty of the prophetess, her animation and numberless graces, until he almost believed in the divinity of her mission : hut he shuddered with horror, when he reflected upon her danger, that her ivory feet should press the burning iron, that, if she fell, she
would fall on the hot metal, and expire in mi¬ sery, while the priests, the accursed, self-con¬ stituted distributors of God's justice/ wouid sing hymns of triumph over her untimely and miserable fate ;—he felt tears gather in hi? e) r es, and he would have devoted himself for her safety. At length the bishop reappeared, and they silently returned to the palace. " Well ! where is she ? " were the first words of Castruccio. " Safe 1 hope, I trust that I shall not be de¬ ceived. I endeavoured to move the abbot to let her escape ; I would have gone to the ab¬ bess, whose consent I must have obtained, and have used all the influence my station would have given me with her ; but the abbot stop¬ ped me ;—he assured me «that he would lake care that no harm befel the devoted victim ; he begged me not to ask an explanation ;—that he and his monks had the charge of the pre¬ paration for the Judgement, and that much was in their power; again and again he assured me that she should receive no inju r v. " I do not like this :—she must be protected by falsehood and perjury, a bing and blasphe-
mous mockery of the name of God. The ab¬ bot, who was a servant of the Popes at Avi¬ gnon, laughs at my scruples; and I,am obliged to vicld. »She will be saved, and God, I hope, will pardon our human weaknesses. Let the sin lie on the souls of those blood-hounds, who would pursue to destruction the loveliest crea¬ ture that breathes upon earth."
CHAPTER III. Judgement of God. — Revolution of Ferrara, The old man was gloomy and depresseti ; lie retired early to prayer. Castruccio had n*»t slept the preceding night, and he felt his eyes weighed down, although in mind he was agi¬ tated and restless ; he slept some hours, start¬ ing from feverish dreams, in which Euthanabia and poor Beatrice, alike in danger, alike weep¬ ing and imploring his aid, filled him vvith ago¬ ny. He was awaked before day-break by the bishop's servant ; he repaired to the bed-cha..'- ber of the prelate, who was sitting on a couch, with haggard looks, and eyes red and inflamed vvith watching. " My dear lord/ cried the bishop, " I pray you pardon me that I disturb your rest ; 1 cannot sleep. In two hours this ceremony— tiiis mockery begins. I shall not bc tliere ; ifc
becomes not my character to be present at such temptations of God's justice : this is my excuse. But í could not go ; I should die if I were to behold Beatrice bound and sufFcring. Yet, do you go, and come quickly back to tell me of her success ;—go, and see, if the abbot keeps his word, and if ever I shall behold my child again." Castruccio endeavoured to console his un¬ happy friend ; but the strong affection and fears of the good man would listen to no com¬ fort. " Let her be saved," he said, " and I am content ; but this doubt, this pause of horrid expectation, is more than I can bear ; I love her more than father ever loved a child, and she was mine by every tie ;—I feel my very life-strings crack, sometimes I am apprehensive I shall die in the agony of doubt ; go, go, my dearest lord, go and return quickly, if you love me ! " The bell of the church now began to toll, and announced that the monks were occupied in the prayers that were to precede the ceremony ; Castruccio hurried to the scene. It was to take place in a large square of Ferrara, under
the walls of the garden of the convent of St. Anna, and before the gates of the monastery to the care of whose monks tlie Judgement was intrusted. As Castruccio approached, he found every avenue choked up by the multitude, and the house-tops covered with people,—even on towers, whence the square could only appear a confused speck, the people crowded in eager expectation. He joined a few nobles who were admitted through the garden of the mo¬ nastery ; a¿ he passed the sacred precincts, he saw the chapel filled vvith the brothers, who were praying, while high mass was performed to sanctify their proceedings, and theeuchaibt was distributed as a pledge of their truth. The square presented a busy, but awful scene ; the houses, the windows of the mona¬ stery, the walls of the convent, were covered by people ; some clinging to the posts, and to the walls; fixing their feet upon small protu¬ berances of stone, they hung there, as if thev stood on air. A large part of the square had been railed ofl' in a semicircle round the door of the monastery, and outside this the people were admitted, while it was guarded on the P 5
inside by Gascon soldiers, tliat witli drawn swords kept in awe the eager spectators, whose fury of hope and fear approached madness : their voices it is true were still, for the solemn toll¬ ing ofthe bell struck them with awe, and hushed them, as the roar of the lion in the forest .si¬ lences the timid herd ; but their bodies and mus¬ cles were in perpetual motion ; some foamed at the mouth, and others gazed vvith outstretched necks, and eyes starting from their sockets. Within this inclosuie one part was assigned for the Dominican brothers, who,in theii black habits and red crosses, at an early hour occu¬ pied tlieir seats, which were raised one above another in the form of a small amphitheatre ; another part was assigned to some of the no¬ bles of both sexes, the spectators of this piteous scene. Within this inclosure was another small one, close to die gate of die monastery; it had two corresponding entrances, near one of whic h a large cioss was erected, and near the othvr a white standard with the words Agmts Dd embroidered on it. This inclosure was attirât empty, except that in one comer a pile of wood was heaped.
Half an hour passed in tremendous expec¬ tation ; Castruccio felt sick vvith dread ; the heavy and monotonous tolling ofthe bell struck on his soul, his head ached, his heart sunk within him. At length the gates of the mo¬ nastery were thrown open, and a number of monks came forward in procession, carrying lights, and chaunting hymns. They saluted the cross, and then ranged themselves round the outside ofthe inner inclosure ; after a pause of few moment?, another party came out with Beatrice in the midst of them ; she was wrapt in her capuchin, the cowl drawn over her face ; the crowd spoke not aa she appeared, but a bound, us of the hollow north-wind among the mighty trees of a sea-like forest, rose from among them ; an awful, deep and nameless breath, a sigh of many hearts ; she was led to the cross, and knelt dovvn silently before it, while the brothers continued to chaunt alter¬ nately the staves of a melancholy hymn. Theo came forth a third party of monks ; they bore ploughshares and torches, mattocks and other instrument!*, tliat again spread a
groan of horror through the multitude. The pyre was lighted ; the shares thrown in among the blazing wood ; while other monks threw up the soil of the inclosure with their mattocks, forming six furrow r s, two feet distant one from the other. At length the bell, which had been silent for a few minutes, began again to toll, in signal for the ceremony to begin. At the com¬ mand ofthe monks Beatrice arose, and threw off her capuchin ; she was drestin a short vest of black stuff, fastened at the waist with a girdle of rope; it was without sleeves, and her fairest arms were crossed on her breast ; her black and silken hair was scattered on her shoulders ; her feet, whiter than monumental marble, were bare. She did not notice the crowd about her, but prayed fervently : her cheek was pale, but her eyes beamed ; and in her face and person there was an indescribable mixture of timidity, with a firm reliance on the aki of a superior power. One of the monks bound her arms, and tied a scarf over her eyes : the shares, white with their excessive heat, were drawn from the fire with large
tongs, and the monks crowded round, and fixed them in the furrows ; the earth seemed to smoke with the heat as they were laid down. Then the barrier of the entrance to the in¬ closure was thrown down ; the monks quitted it at the opposite end, and one of them vvith a loud voice, recommending Beatrice to the jus¬ tice of God, bade her advance. Every heart beat fast; Castruccio overcome by uncontrola¬ ble pity, would have darted forward to save her, but some one held him back; and in a mo¬ ment, before the second beating of his heart, before he again drew breath, horror was con¬ verted to joy and wonder. Beatrice, her eves covered, her arms bound, her feet bare, passed over the burning shares with a quick light step, and reaching the opposite barrier, fell on her knees, uttering an exclamation of thanksgiving to God. These were the first words she had spoken : they were followed by a long and deaf¬ ening shout of triumph from the multitude, which now manifested its joy as wildly, a- before they had painfully restrained their pity and indignation. They were no longer to be contained by the palings of the inclosures ; all
was broken through and destroyed ; the inqui¬ sitors had slunk away ; and the Gascon troops galloped oif from the ground. Immediately on the completion of her task, Beatrice had been unbound, and her capuchin was thrown over her; the noble ladies who were present crowded round her; she was tilent and collected; her colour indeed was heightened by her internal agitation, and her limbs trembled with the exertion of her forti¬ tude ; but she commanded her countenance and spirits, and at least wore the appearance of serenity. She received the congratulations •лпа respectful salutation of her friends with afieetionatecordiality; while the air resounded with tiie triumphant Tt Deum of the monks, and the people pressed around, awed, but joy¬ ful. They endeavoured to touch the garment of the newly declared saint ; mothers brouglvt her tlieir sick children; the unhappy intreated for her players ; and, however bashful and un¬ willing, she was obliged to bestow her blessing on all around. Suddenly a procession of nuns came forth from the garden-gate of the con¬ vent ; covered with their long veils, and sing-
ing their hymns, they surrounded Beatrice, and led her, attended by the other ladies in com¬ pany, to their cloisters, where her maternal friend the viscountess Marchesana waited to clasp her in her arms. Castruccio had already returned to the bishop; yet he came not so quickly, but that the news oi' the success of his Beatrice, passing from mouth to mouth, had reached him. His first emotions were joy, gratitude, and wonder ; but these su bsided ; and the good old man kneel¬ ed humiliated, trembling and penitent, when he considered that G od *& name had been called im in vain, that his consecrated servants were perjured, and that falsehood was firmly esta¬ blished, on foundations where truth alone ought to rest. He listened to the account of Castruc¬ cio with interrupted exclamations and tear« ; and when it was ended he exclaimed, " This is the most miserable—tlie happiest day of my hte!" In the evening the palace ofthe prelate was crowded by his friends, who¿ knowing the in¬ terest he took in Beatrice, came to congratu¬ late him on her victory, and to express their
delight that God had thought their town worthy of this manifestation of his grace. The bishop, joyful, but full of shame, listened in silence to their conjectures, exclarpations, and long rela¬ tions of the morning's scene ; his heart was glad, but he was angry with himself for feeling pleasure at the triumph of falsehood ; and, although a smile played on his lips, a blush spread itself over his aged cheeks. The viscountess Malvezzi, radiant with de¬ light, and the lovely Beatrice blushing under her newly acquired honours, now entered ; the nobles pressed round the prophetess,kissing her hand, and the hem of her garment ; while she, modest, half abashed, yet believing in her right to the reverence of her friends, smiled upon all, Castruccio was not among the last of her wor¬ shippers ; she had never appeared so beauti¬ ful ; her eyes, sparkling with the light of triumph, were yet half hid by their heavy lids, her cheeks glowing, her graceful person, clothed in her modest garb of white woollen, moved with gestures ever new and beautiful.'—she seemed another being from her he had before seen, as inspired, as ethereal, but more lovely.
After the crowd of visitors had retired, a few of the intimate friends who formed the council of the bishop regained ; the lady Marchesana invited them immediately to adopt some plan for the entrance of their prince into the city ^ she continued : " I speak but the words of my child, when I say this; pardon me, saintly Beatrice, that 1 call you thus. It is sweet to me to fancy that you are my daughter, although 1 am much unworthy of such a child, and you are the offspring of heaven alone." Beatrice kissed the hand of her excellent friend with respect and gratitude; the bishop was much troubled at his sister's expression ; the remembrance of her heretic mother, and his prison-scene with Magfreda, was full in his recollection, and he looked up to heaven, as if to ask God to pardon him, and to avert the punishment of deceit from the guileless Bea¬ trice. One of the nobles present asked the sacred maiden, to name the day when the prince should enter the town. She said in a gentle voice; íť My lords, the hour of victory is at hand : the Popes, in despite of their duty, have
deserted their sacred city, have relinquished their lawful rule, and would now estabhhh tyranny among us,—it will not be. Four days hence, on the evening of Monday, we bhall ieceive our sovereign, and on the follow¬ ing morning his banner will be unfurled on tho battlements of this city." "On Monday," cried a noble, "my heart misgives me ; methinks it ь an /Egyptian day ; has uo one a calendar i " " It is an Ægyptian day," exclaimed Bea¬ ti ice, with vivacity; " but the adverse aspect of the stars falls on our adversaries ; for us there is joy and victory/' " Monday is an eaily day," said Castruccio; " but as the holy Beatrice commands, so shall it be. And, my honoured lord, I shall leave you at day-break to-morrow. 1 shall not see you again, divine prophetess, until I come with your prince, to assert his right. I pray you there¬ fore to bless my arms, and cause, that I may be doubly valiant, approved by one whom heaven has sent us." Castruccio kneeled to the beautiful giri ; he looked up at her with his ardent eves, his pas-
siorı-formed lips, and countenance of frank and uoble beauty ; she blushing placed her haud oii his raven hair, and said, " May God bless and prosper thee and thy cause î "——Then, beckoning her aged friend, she silently saluted the company, and withdrew, abashed, con¬ fused, but her heart beating with a new and ¿trange sense of pleasure. The plan for the entrance of the marques» was now arranged. On the night of the fourth of August he was to pass Lago Scuro, and halt with his troops, at the path which led to the secret entrance to the Malvezzi palace. The marquess, Castruccio, and a small party were to enter the house of the viscountess; and Galeazzo to lead the greater part of tlie re¬ mainder to the gates of the town by day-break the following morning ; a part wa» to remain as a corps de reserve, if the small escort of die marquess should prove insufficient to force the opening of tiie gates, and the entrance of G a· leaz/o. In that case this more numerous troop was» to enter the city through the house of the >ucounte*$, and bring the песеььагу succour to tlicir prince.
The assembly then broke up ; and Castruc¬ cio, wearied by the events of the day, fatigued with want of rest, his spirits sinking after their relaxation from the powerful excitements they had sustained, retired early to repose. He took an affectionate leave of the good old pre¬ late, who charged him with many messages of fidelity and attachment to his prince. The dawn of day beheld Castruccio on the road to Rovigo. The wide plain of Lombardy awoke to life under the rising sun. It was a serene morning ; the cloudy mists that settled on the horizon, received the roseate glories of the rising sun, and the soft clouds of gold and pink that awaited his appearance in the east, would have pictured forth to a Grecian eye the chariot of Aurora, or the golden gates which the Hours threw back as Phoebus entered upon his diurnal patii. And does the beauteous prophetess seek her tower to behold the glories of the morn ? Beatrice is on the donjon of the palace ; and it ib tuie that her eyes are directed towards the rising sun ; but there is a casque which flashes under ^s first beams, a horseman who
gallops away from Ferrara, whose form her eyes strain to behold, even when he appears only as a black spot in the distance. She leans her cheek upon her hand, and, lost in medita¬ tion, she, most unfortunate, mistakes for the inspirations of Heaven the wild reveries of youth and love : but still her heart was hidden even from herself by a veil she did not even wish to throw aside. She felt gently agitated, but happy ; a kind of Ely si an happiness, that trembled at change, and wished only for a se¬ cure eternity of what it was. Castruccio was hailed with joy by his friends at Rovigo; and, when the intelligence he brought was heard, every voice was busy in congratulation, every hand in prepái ation. The knights assisted the squires in furbishing their arms, and securing the various joints and fast¬ enings of their heavy armour, in looking that the trusty blade of the sword was welt fixed in the pummel, in selecting the stoutest lances, and in attending to all the other equipments of war ; while the fair hands of the ladies pre¬ pared the scarfs, which, tied over the hearts of their knights, would preserve them from every
wound* No thought of danger and death,—* this was to be rather a tournament, wherein with blunted lances they tilted for a sovereignty; and the idea of the Pope, and of their priest- ridden opponents and their foreign guarda ex¬ cited derision alone. The sun set on the fourth day, and the troops of the marquess obizzo to the number of four hundred were drawn out before the gates of Rovigo. The expedition was ordered аз it had been arranged; and in the depth of night tiie viscountess, opening the low door of her secretentrance, found the marquees, Castruc¬ cio, and tlieir followeis, waiting in silence round the short half-buried cross on the marshy moor. A few whispered words of recognition having been spoken, she led them along her galleries, and up the staircase to the inhabited rooms of the palace, lifting up the tapestry of the first apartment; Castruccio did not again know the old, neglected chamber with its decaying fur¬ niture. It was hung with silk, festooned wit! flowers, and lighted by a hundred wax lights ; a table was spread with wines, and fruits, and sweetmeats, and other more substantial refresh-
ments ; several couches also were placed round the room for the convenience of those who wished to repose. The viscountess with courtly grace welcomed the marquess to her palace. " My lord," she said, " for a few hours you must be imprison¬ ed in this apartment; I have endeavoured to decorate your poor dungeon to the best of my power, and indeed shall ever hold this room honoured, since it affords refuge and protec¬ tion to my sovereign." The old lady received the marquess's heait- felt thanks, and then retired satisfied, to recount to Beatrice the arrival of her guests, and the whispered enquiry of Castruccio concernine; the health of the prophetess. But, although she had gilt their cage, the hours passed hea¬ vily to the imprisoned chiefs; they watched the staj л as they still burned brightly in the sky, nnd almost uttered a cry of joy when they first perceived them, one by one, hiding in the morn- шц light. At length the stepi of men weic beard about the streets; and the horse» which the bishop had provided for the troop came to the door ofthe palace- The trampling ofthe*?
horses as they were led to their destination, attracted a small crowd along with them ; and, when the strange knights mounted them, and advanced in slow procession along the streets, the crowd increased, and the name of the marquess was whispered, while every one gazed in wonder. At length, when the troop had reached the principal street of Ferrara, tiiey put their horses to the gallop, and raising the Ghibeline war-cry, rode through the town calling on the people tojóin them, and invoking downfal to the foreign tyrants : a band of ci¬ tizens, who had been already prepared, obeyed the summons, and they were followed by others, who espoused the party of the prince in their hearts, and joyfully aided his restora¬ tion. The trampling of the steeds, the clash ot arms, as the knights struck their shields with their spears, the war-cry of the troops, and the vivas of the crowd, awoke the papal governor, who called out the Gascon soldiery. But it was too late ; the marquess reached the gate of the town, put the sentinels to flight, and ad¬ mitted Galeazzo into the city: then, joined by
all the nobility of Ferrara, he rode towards the palace of the governor. The Gascons were drawn up ш tue great square oi tue town, but they were unable to withstand the first on¬ set of Obizzo's party ; they fled, and shut them¬ selves up in Castel Tealdo, the fortress of the town, where they were at least safe from sud¬ den attack. The marquess drew his troops around, and threw up his works to prevent their egress ; and, leaving to his principal cap¬ tain the care of the siege, returned to his pa¬ lace to receive the congratulations of his de¬ lighted subjects. Now joy was the order of the day ; the Ita¬ lians, who had been intrusted with the charge of some of the gates of the town, brought the keys to the feet of their sovereign ; the others were broken open; every magistrate brought in his resignation, and man v jf them petitions for mercy ; and lying traitors, who assured him that their faith had never been broken, crowd¬ ed to the presence-chamber. His throne was erected in the great square, covered "dth the richest cloth, and surmounted by a magnificent canopy; the troops were marshalled before VOL. II. E
him, the standards brought and lowered to his feet. A deputation of the noblest counts and knights of Ferrara were sent to convoy the caroccio * to the throne of the prince. They went to the cathedral ; and the monks led it forth, adorned with its splendid trappings and standards, the gold cross and white flag of the Popes waving above all. They yoked to it four beautiful dove coloured oxen, on whom they cast rich trappings of scarlet cloth ; and then, to the sound of trumpets, surrounded by the knights, and followed by a procession of priests singing a Te Deum, it was drawn to the pquare before the throne of Obizzo ; then with a triumphant flourish, the standard of the Pope was lowered, and that of the house of Este raised to its ancient eminence. Festivities
of every kind followed this joyful event, tri¬ umphant festivities, untarnished with blood ; for few of the subjects of the marquess w T ere hostile to his return, and these either went into voluntary exile, or joined the refugees in Cas¬ tel Tealdo.

CHAPTER IV. Fall of Beatrice. Castruccio was no inactive partaker in this busy scene. But, after the combat was finish¬ ed, and he perceived that Obizzo was en¬ gaged in acts of peaceful sovereignty alone, he hastened to the palace of the bishop ; for he was painfully surprised in not seeing him among the nobles who waited on the prince. The old man was ill : he had been dreadfully agi¬ tated by the scenes of the preceding days, and his health for a while sunk under it. Castruc- < m war> introduced into his chamber, where he lay peacefully sleeping on a magnificent couch, his adopted child, the lovely Beatrice, w atching before him, who, when she beheld Castruccio, blushed deeply, while, in spite of every effort, a smile of delight spread itself over her expressive countenance. "He is not very ill," she said in a low voice,
in answer to Castruccio's enquiries ; " the fever has left him entirely ; he is weak, but recover¬ ing. He sleeps sweetly now : look at him^f at his reverend grey hairs strewn oveâ his naked temples; look at his eyes, sunken vvith age, yet, when open, beaming with benevolence and affection : look what a gentle smile there is upon his pale lips ; there he sleeps, afiêe- tion, benevolence, matchless virtue, and ex- ceiling wisdom, all cradled by the baby Sleep ; I have been contemplating him for more than an hour; he draws his breath as regularly as a sleeping infant who has sucked its fill, and his heart heaves slowly, but calmly. It is a heavenly sight to look on the repose of this good old man \ it calms wild passion, and sheds the fresh dew of healthful meditation over the strange reveries of youth." She spoke in a whisper ; but her counte¬ nance was all animation. The old man mov¬ ed ; and, pressing her finger on her lips, bhe paused. " Beatrice, my child," he said, *' i have slept long and soundly, and feel quite well. Who is that stranger? does he bring news from the marquess ï Aye, I remember
this is the day,—-1 am strangely confused; I recollect new that I heard of his success be¬ fore 1 slept." " Father, it is my lord Castruccio, who, after having reinstated our prince in his sovereignty, visits your sick chamber." Castruccio remained several hours convers¬ ing with the bishop; he gave him an account of the action of the morning, and Beatrice list¬ ened with her whole soul in her eyes ; yet, at¬ tentive as she was to the narration, she watch¬ ed with sweet earnestness her sick friend, turn¬ ing her looks from him to the animated face of Castruccio; and я > tK n, as she crept near her adoptive father, .г adjusted some pillow, or performed some little office that marked her earnest observation. " How beautiful she is 1" thought Castruc¬ cio, " and what will become of her ì " he fixed his eyes on the silver plate on her forehead. " Yes, she is the Amilla Dei, a maiden vowed to Go<! and chastity ; yet her eyes seem pene¬ trated with love ; the changeful and blooming colours of her face, her form, which is all that imagination can conceive of perfect, appear
not like those of a cloistered nun. Ah i Bea¬ trice, if you would be sacred to your God, you ought to hide your surpassing loveliness with thick veils, behind treble grates. But she is a prophetess ; something more than human ;— a character unapproachable even in thought/' Thus Castruccio tried to disentangle his perplexed thoughts, still looking on the maiden, who, suddenly raising her eyes, and meeting his which were fixed on her silver plate, blush¬ ed even till the tips of her fingers became a rosy red ; and then, complaining in an hesi¬ tating voice, that the plate hurt her brow, she untied it; while her silken hair, no longer con¬ fined, fell on her neck. Thus many hours passed, and when at length the prophetess retired^ it was to feverish medi¬ tation, and thoughts burning with passion, ren¬ dered still more dangerous from her belief in the divine nature of all that suggested itself to her mind. She prayed to the Virgin to in¬ spire her ; and, again giving herself up to re¬ verie, she wove a subtle web, whose materials she believed heavenly, but which were indeed stolen from the glowing wings of love. Kneel-
ing, her eyes raised to heaven, she felt the same commotion in her soul, which she had felt before, and had recognised as divine inspi¬ ration ; she felt the same uncontrolable trans¬ port and burst of imaginative vr-ion, which she believed to flow immediatt-iy from the in¬ visible ray of heaven-derived prophecy. She fielt her soul, as it were, fade away, and incor¬ porate itself with another and a diviner spirit, which whispered truth and knowledge to her mind, and then slowly receding, left her human nature, agitated, joyful, and exhausted;—— these were her dreams,—alas ! to her they *vere realities. The /oliowing morning she again met Cas¬ truccio in the chamber of the bishop. She now looked upon him fearlessly ; and, if the virgin modtsty of her nature had not withheld her, her words would have been as frank as the innocently beliefd them to be inspired, But, although she was silent, her looks told that she was changed. Her manner tlie day before had been soft, concentrated, and retir¬ ing; now she was unconstrained; her e)es sparkled, and a joyous expression dwelt in
every feature. Her manner towards her guar¬ dian was endearing, nor was the affectionate modulation of her voice difierent when she ad* dressed his guest : Castruccio started to hear it. It reminded him of the accents of Eutha¬ nasia, whom for a while he had forgotten ; and, looking at Beatrice, he thought, " How lovely she is, and yet how unlike î " Several days passed thus ; Beatrice became embarrassed ; it seemed as if she wished to speak to Castruccio, and yet dared not ; when she approached, she blushed, and again drew back, and would again seek him, but agam vainly. She had framed the mode of her ad¬ dress, conned and reconned the words she should say ; but, when an opportunity occur¬ red to utter them, lier voice failed her, the me¬ mory of what she was about to utter deserted her, and it was not until the approach of a third person took from her ť.w possibility of fpeaking, that speech again returned, and the lost occasion was uselessly lamented. At night she sought the counsels of heaven, and gave herself up to her accustomed extasies ; they always told her the same things, until to E 5
her bewildered and untamed mind it seemed as if the spirit that had power over her, repri¬ manded her hesitation, her little trust in the promises of heaven, and her reluctance to fol¬ low the path it pointed out. " Surely, oh ! most certainlv," she thought, " thus 1 am commanded by the Power who has so often revealed his will to me. Can I penetrate his hidden designs r can 1 do more than execute his decrees? did I not feel thus, when with prophetic transport I foretold di¬ stant events that surely came to pass ? when 1 foresaw yet afar off the d< Ί of Lorenzo, that lovely child blooming in health, when every one called me a false prophet ? And yet he died. And now, the marquess's return ? nav, am I not approved by heaven? did I not es¬ cape from the malice of my enemies through its miraculous interposition ? Oh ! I will no longer scan with presumptuous argument, pur¬ poses that are ruled by mightier hands than mine ; I will resign myself to the guidance of what has ever conducted me aright, and which now points out the path to happiness." The next morning, her cheeks flushed, her
eyes weighed down, trembling and abashed, she sought Castruccio. It is impossible that there should not have been much tenderness in his manner towards this lovely girl; her history, her strange and romantic contempla¬ tions and impulses, and the great intimacy which had arisen between them, were suffi¬ cient for this. He regarded her also as a nun ; and this made him feel less restraint in the manner of his address, since he feared not to be misconstrued; while at the same time it gave an elevation and unusual tone to his ideas concerning her, that made him watch her evei y motion with inteiest. She now approached ; and he said playfully ; " Where is thy maik, prophetess ? art thou no longer the Maiden of God? For some days thou hast cast aside the hallowed diadem." u I still have it," she replied; "but 1 have dismissed it from my brow; I will give it you ; come, my lord, this evening at midnight to the secret entrance of the viscountess's palace.' Saying these words, shelled to hide her burn¬ ing blushes in solitude, aud again to feel tho
intoxicating delusions that led her on to de¬ struction. Castruccio came· If it were in human virtue to resist the invitation of this angelic girl, his was not the mind, strictly disciplined to right, self-examining and jealous of its own in¬ tegrity that should thus weigh its actions, and move only as approved by conscience. He was frank and noble in his manner ; his nature was generous ; and, though there lurked in his heart the germ of an evil-bearing tree, it was as yet undeveloped and inani mated ; and, in obeying the summons of Beatrice, he passively gave himself up to the strong excitements of curiosity and wonder. He went again and again. W hen the si¬ lent night was spread over every thing, and the walls cf the town stood black and confused amidst the overshadowing trees, whose waving foliage was diversified by no gleam of light, but all was formless as the undistinguishable air ; or if a star were dimly seen, it just glisten¬ ed on the waters of the marsh, and then swiftly the heavy web of clouds hid both star and wa-
ter; when the watch dogs were mute, un- awakened by the moon, and the wind that blew across the plain alone told to the ear the place of tlie trees ; when the bats and the owls were lulled by the exceeding darkness ; it was on such nights as these, that Castruccio sought the secret entrance of the viscountess's palace, and was received by the beautiful Beatrice, enshrined in an atmosphere of love and joy. She was a strange riddle to him. Without vow, without even that slight shew of distrust which is the child of confidence itself; with¬ out seeking the responsive professions of eter¬ nal love, she surrendered herself to his arms. And, when the first maiden bashfulness had passed away, all was deep tenderness and ar¬ dent love. Yet there was a dignity and л trusting affection in her most unguarded mo¬ ments, that staggered him : a broken expres¬ sion would sometimes fall from her lips, that seemed to say that she believed him indissolu- Ыу hers, which made him start, as if he feared that he had acted with perfidy ; yet he had never solicited, never promised,—what could *he mean ? What was she ? He loved her as
he would have loved any thing that was sur¬ passingly beautiful ; and, when these expres¬ sions, that intimated somewhat of enduring and unchangeable in their intercourse, intruded themselves, they pained and irritated him : he turned to the recollection of Euthanasia, his pure, his high-minded,'and troth-plight bride; -— she seemed as if wronged by such an idea ; and yet he hardly dared think her purer than poor Beatrice, whose soul, though given up to love, was imbued in its very grain and texture with delicate affections and honourable feelings ; all that makes the soul and living spark of virtue. If she had not resisted the impulses of her soul, it was not that she wanted the power; but that, deluded by the web of deceit that had so long wound itself about her, she believed them, not only lawful, but inspired by the special in¬ terposition of heaven. Poor Beatrice ! She had inherited from her mother the most ardent imagination that ever animated a human soul. Its images were as vivid as reality, and were so overpowering, that they appeared to her, when she compared them to the calm sensations of others, as some-
thing superhuman ; and she followed that as a guide, which she ought to have bound with fetters, and to have curbed and crushed by every eilbrt of reason. Unhappy prophetess î the superstitions of her times had obtained credit for, and indeed given birth to her pre¬ tensions, and the compassion and humanity of her fellow creatures had stamped them with the truth-attesting seal of a miracle. There is so much life in love ! Beatrice was hardly seventeen, and she loved for the first time ; and all the exquisite pleasures of that passion were consecrated to her, by a mysteriousness and delusive sanctity that gave them tenfold zest. It is said, that in love we idolize the object ; and, placing him apcrt and selecting him from his fellows, look on him as superior in nature to all others. We do so ; but, even as we idolize the object of our afiections, do we idolize our¬ selves ; if we separate him from his fellow mortals, so do we separate ourselves, and, glo¬ rying in belonging to him alone, feel lifted abov e all other sensations, all other joys and grief«, to one hallowed circle from which all but hi* idea is banished ; we walk as if a mistor some
more potent charm divided us from ail but him ; a sanctified victim which none but the priest set apart for that office could touch and not pollute, enshrined in a cloud of glory, made glorious through beauties not our own. Thus we ail feel during the entrancing dream of love ; and Beatrice, the ardent, affectionate Beatrice, felt this witii multiplied power : and, believing that none had ever felt so before, she thought that heaven itself had interfered to produce so true a paradise. If her childish dreams had been full of fire, how much more vivid and overpowering was the awakening of her soul when she first loved ! It seemed as if some new and wondrous spirit had descended, alive, breathing and panting, into her colder heart, and gave it a new impulse, a new existence, Ever the dupe of her undisciplined thoughts, she cherished her reveries, believing that hea¬ venly and intellectual, which was indebted for its force to earthly mixtures ; and she resigned herself entire to her visionary joys, until she finally awoke to truth, fallen, and for ever lost. In the mean time peace was entirely restored to Ferrara : on the fifteenth of August Caètel
Tealdo surrendered, and the Pope's governor, with his foreign guard, quitted the territories of the marquess of Este. Galeazzo Visconti re¬ turned to Miian, but still Castruccio lingered : he wished to go ; he found himself out of place as a dangling courtier in the train of Obizzo ; but how could he leave Beatrice ? What did she expect or wish ? The passionate tender¬ ness that she evinced, could not be an ephe¬ meral spark of worthless love ; and how often did the lľe f she used in talking of futurity, make him pause when he wished to speak of their separation ! She seemed happy ; her words flowed in rich abundance, and were adorned with various imagery and with delicate thoughts, shewing that her soul, at rest from fear, wandered as it was wont amidst the wilds of her imagination. He found her untaught, undisciplined, but so sincere, so utterly forget¬ ful of self, so trusting, that he dared not speak that, which each day shewed more clearly would be as a dagger to her heart. A thou¬ sand times he cursed himself for having mis¬ taken her, and imagining, inspired as she be¬ lieved herself to be, that her actions and feci-
ings had not been dictated by the loftiest im¬ pulses. But the time arrived, when he was obliged to undeceive her; and the hand, that tore away the ties her trusting heart had bound round itself, at the same time tore away the veil which had for her invested all nature, and shewed her life as it was—naked and appall- ing. ч They sat in her apartment at the Malvezzi palace ; she radiant, beautiful, and happy ; and, twining her lovely arms around Castruc¬ cio, she said : " The moon will set late to¬ morrow-night, and you must not venture here ; and indeed for several nights it will spread too glaring a beam. But tell me, are you become a citizen of Ferrara? They averred that you were the head of a noble city ; but î see they must have been mistaken, or the poor city must totter strangely, so headless as your ab¬ sence must make it. How is this, my only friend ? Are you not Antelminelii ? Are we not to go to Lucca ? " Castruccio could npt stand the questioning of her soft yet earnest eyes ; he withdrew him¬ self from her arms^and taking her handb in his, /
kissed them silently. " How is my noble lord ì " she repeated, " have you had ill news ? are you again banished ? that cannot be, or methinks my heart would have told me the secret. Yet, if you are, be not unhappy:—your own Bea¬ trice, with prophetic words, and signs from heaven that lead the multitude, will conduct you to greater glory and greater power than you before possessed. My gentle love, you have talked less about yourself, and about your hopes and desires, than I should have wished :—Do not think me a foolish woman, tied to an em¬ broidery frame, or that myHieart would not beat high at the news of your success, or that with my whole soul I should not enter into your plans, and tell you how the stars looked upon your intents. In truth my rnind pants for fit¬ ting exertion ; and, in being joined to thee, dearest love, 1 thought that I had found the goal for which heaven had destined me. Nay, look not away from me ; I do not reproach thee ; I know that, in finding thee, in being bound to thy fate, mine is fulfilled ; and I am happy» Now speak—tell me what has disturbed thy thoughts." о " Svveetest Beatrice, I have nothing to tell ;
yet I have for many days wished to speak ; for in truth I must return to Lucca." The quick sensations of Beatrice could not be deceived. The words of Castruccio were too plain ; she looked at him, as if she wouid read the secret in his soul,—she did read it :— his downcast eyes, confused air, and the words he stammered out in explanation, told her every thing. The blood rushed to her face, her neck, her hands ; and then as suddenly re¬ ceding, left even her lips pale. She withdrew her arms from the soft caress she had bestow¬ ed ; playfully she had bound his head with her own hair and the silken strings entangled with his ; she tore her tresses impatiently to disen¬ gage herself from him ; then, trembling, white, and chilled, she sat down, and said not a word. Castruccio looked on with fear ; he attempted consolation. " í shall visit thee again, my own Beatrice ; for a time we must part ;—*the viscountess—- the good bishop—you cannot leave them,— fear not but that we shall meet again." " We shall meet again i " she exclaimed with a passionate voice ; " Never ! " Her tone, full of agitation and grief, sunk
into the soul of Castruccio. He took her hand ; it was lifeless ; he would have kissed her; but she drew back coldly and sadly. His words had not been those of the heart ; he had hesi¬ tated and paused : but now compassion, and the memory of what she had been, awoke his powers, and he said warmly, and witli a voice whose modulations seemed tuned by love: " You mistake me, Beatrice ; indeed you do. I love you ;—who could help loving one 50 true, so gentle, and so trusting ?—we part for a while;—this is necessary. Does not your character require it ? the part you act in the world r every consideration of honour and de¬ licacy?— Do you think that 1 can ev er forget you r does not your own heart tell you, that your love, your caresses, your sweet eyes, and gentle words, have woven a net which must keep me for ever ? You will remain here, and I shall gi) ; but a few suns, a few moons, and we shall meet again, and the joy of that moment will make you forget our transient separation." How cold were these words to the burning heart of the prophetess ; she, who thought that
Heaven had singled out Castruccio to unite him to her, who thought that the Holy Spirit had revealed himself to bless their union, that, by the mingled strength of his manly qualities, and her divine attributes, .some great work might be fulfilled on eardi ; who saw all as Goďs command, and done by his special in¬ terposition ; to find this heavenly tissue swept away, beaten down, and destroyed ! It was to his fortunes, good or bad, that she had bound herself, to share his glory or soothe his griefs ; and not to be the mistress of the passing hour, the distaflfof the spinning Hercules. It was her heart, her whole soul she had given ; her un¬ derstanding, her prophetic powers, all the little universe that with her ardent spirit she grasp¬ ed and possessed, she had surrendered, fully, and without reserve ; búlalas î the most worth¬ less part alone had been accepted, and tlie rest cast as dust upon the winds. How in this mo¬ ment did she long to be a winged soul, that her person heedlessly given, given only as a part of that to the whole of which he had an indefea¬ sible right, and which was now despised, might
meit away from the view of the despiser, and be seen no more! The words of her lover brought despair, not comfort ; she shook her head in silence ; Castruccio spoke again and again ; but many words are dangerous where there is much to conceal, and every syllable he uttered laid bare some new forgery of her ima¬ gination, and shewed her more and more clearly the harsh reality. She was astounded, and drank in his words eagerly, though she an¬ swered not ; she was impatient when he was silent, for she longed to know the worst ; yet she dared not direct the course of his explana¬ tions by a single enquiry : she was as a mother, who reads the death-warrant of her child on tiie physician's brow, yet blindly trusting that she decyphers ill, will not destroy the last hope by a question. Even so she listened to the attirances of Castruccio. each word beinir a íiCbh assurance of her misery, yet not stamping the last damning seal on her despair. At length grey dawn appeared ; «-he wa> si¬ lent, motionless and wan ; she marked it not ; but he did ; and rising hastily he cried, " 1 must ς , or you are lost ; farewel, Beatrice ' ''
Now she awoke, her eyes glared, her lovely features became even distorted by tlie strength oí her agony,—she started up—" Kot yet, not y et— one word more í Do you·—»love another r " Her tone was that of command ;—her flash¬ ing eyes demanded tlie truth, and seemed as if they would by their excessive force strike the falsehood deva, if he dared utter it : he was subdued, impelled to reply :— « I do." 4( Her namer" " Euthanasia." '* Enough, I will remember that name in my prayers. Now, go! seek not to come acain : the entrance will be closed ; do not en- deavour to see me at the house of the bishop ; I shall fly you as a basilisk, and, if I see you, vour eves will kill me. Remember these are my words ; they are as true, as that lam all a lie. It will kill me ; but I swear by all my hopes never to see you more. Oh, never, never !" She again sank down pale and lifeless, press¬ ing her hands upon her eyes, as if the more speedily to fulfil her vow. Castruccio dared
stay no longer, he fled as the dæmon might have fled from the bitter sorrows of. despoiled Paradise ; he left her aghast, overthrown, an¬ nihilated. He quitted Ferrara that day* He was mi¬ serable ; careless of the road, he sought soli tude alone. Before night he was among the wild forests of the Apennines,-—and there he paused ; he was surrounded by the dark pine- forests that sung above him, covered bya night which was cloudy and unquiet, for the swift wind drove the rack along the sky, and moan¬ ed, and howled ; while the lightnings of a di¬ stant storm, faint, but frequent, displayed the savage spot on which he rested. He threw himself from his horse, and abandoned him- ' self to sorrow : it stung him to reflect, that he was the cause of sharpest pain to one who loved him ; and the excuses he fondly leaned upon before his explanation, broke as a reed under the wild force of Beatrice's despair. He had heard her story, he knew her delusions, and ought not to have acted towards her, as tu a fellow-being who walked in the same light as himself, and saw objects dressed in the same vol. n. F
colours ; a false sun made every thing decep¬ tive for her eyes,·—and he knew it. Yet what could he now do? Go again to Beatrice ? Wherefore ? What could he say ? but one word— 44 forget me I " And that was already said. His early vows, his deepest and his lasting hopes, were hound up in Eu¬ thanasia : she depended on him alone ; she had no father, no relation, none to love but him. She had told him that she gave up her soul to him, and had intreated him not to cast aside tiie gift, Beatrice had never demanded his faith, his promise, his full and entire heart ; but she believed that she had them, and the loss sustained by lier was irretrievable. Yet she would soon forget him : thus he reasoned ; hers was one of those minds ever tossed like the ocean by the tempest of pas¬ sion ; yet, like the ocean, let the winds abate, and it subsides, and quickly again becomes smiling. She had many friends ; she was loved, nay, adored, by all who surrounded her : utter hopelessness of ever seeing him again would cause her to forget him ; her old ideas, her old habits would return, and she would be happy.
His interference alone couid harm her; but she, the spoiled child of the world, would weep out her grief on some fond and friendly bosom, and then again laugh and play as she was wont. He spent the following day and night among these forests ; until the tempest of his sou! was calmed, and hia thoughts, before entangled and matted by vanity and error, now flowed loose, bome on by repentance, аз the clinging weeds of a dried-up brook are spread free and distinct by the re-appearance of the clear stream. He no longer felt the withering look of Beatrice haunt even his dreams ; it appear¬ ed to him that he had paid the mulct of re¬ morse and error; the impression of. her en¬ chantments and of her sorrows wore off; and he returned with renewed tenderness to Eu¬ thanasia, whom he had wronged ; and, in tlie knowledge that he had shamed her pure les¬ sons, he felt a true and wholesome sorrow, which was itself virtue. Yet he dared not go back to her ; he dared not meet her clear, calm eye ; and he felt that his cheek wouid burn with shame under her innocent gasse. He sud- Ft
denly remembered his engagement to visit Pepi, the old Ghibeline politician, who, with¬ out honesty or humanity, snuffed up the air of self-conceit, and who, thus inflated, believed himself entitled to cover others with the venom of sarcasm and contempt. " Yes, old fox !" he cried, " I will unearth you, and see if there is aught in your keimel worth the labour. Methinks you would give uut as if gold were under the dirt, or that power and wisdom lurked beneath your sheep¬ skin and wrinkles ; but believe me, my good friend, we Italians, however base our politics may be, are not yet low enough to feed from a troupi with you for the driver/' The recollection of something so low and contemptible as Benedetto of Cremona, re¬ lieved Castruccio from a load of dissatisfaction and remorse. Comparing Pepi vvith himself, bot directly, but by inference of infinite con¬ tempt, he felt that he could again unabash¬ ed raise his eyes. This was not well ; far better was the blush of humiliation which rovereti him in comparing his soiled purposcb and strayed heart to something high and pure,
than the ignoble heavings of self-consequence in matching himself with such a blotted spe¬ cimen of humanity as Pepi. So, as we are wont, when wc return from the solitude of bclf-examination to the company of fellow-sin¬ ners, he twisted up again the disentangled tresses of his frank and sincere thoughts into the million-knotted ties of the world's customs and saintly-looking falsehoods ; and, leaving the woods of the Apennines, something wiser in self-knowledge, and but little improved in ge¬ nerous virtue, and the government of his pas¬ sions, he put spurs to his horse, and turned his steps towards Cremona.
CHAPTER V. Visit to Pepi at Cremona. It was on the evening of the tenth of Septem¬ ber that Castruccio arrived at the bridge which Pepi had indicated. No one was there, ex¬ cept an old woman spinning with a distant who from her age and wrinkles might have served for a model Of the eternal Fates ; for her leathern and dry, brown skin, did not seem formed of the same frail materials as the lily cheek of a high-bred dame. She looked full at Castruccio ; so that he laughing asked her, whether she would tell him Ыз fortune. «Aye," replied the beldame, "though no witch, it is easy for me to tell you what you are about to find. Say the word you were bid repeat here, and I will conduct you where you desire to go/' 44 Lucca."
" Enough ; follow me. He of whom you wot, will be glad that you come alone/' She led him out of the high mad, by nam· berless lanes through which bis horse couid hardly break his way, among the entangled bushes of the hedges. The woman trudged on before, spinning as she went, and scream¬ ing out a few notes of a song, returning to them again and again with a monotonous kind of yell, as loud as it was discordant· At length they arrived at a mean suburb of Cre¬ mona ; and, traversing a nurober of dirty alleys and dark streets, they came to one bounded on one side by the high, black, stone wall of a palace. The old woman knocked at a small, low door in this wall, made Btrong with iron clamps, and which, when cautiously opened, appeared not less in thickness than the wall of the palace itself. It was Pepi's muscular, but withered hand, that turned the massy key, and forced back the bolts of three successive doors that guarded this entrance· After hav¬ ing admitted Castruccio (the old woman being left behind with the horse, to lead him to the front gate of the palace), he closed the doors
with care; and then, it being quite dark within the passage, he rnçovered a small lamp, and led the way through the gallery, up a narrow staircase, which opened by a secret door on the great and dreary hall of the palace. This vast apartment was hardly light, although at the further end a, torch, stuck against the wall, flared with a black and smoky flame. " Welcome again, noble Castruccio, to my palace," said Pepi : " I have waited anxiously for your arrival, for all my hopes appear now to depend upon you. At present, since you appear wet and cold, come to the further hall, where we shall find fire and food : and pardon, I intreat you,- my homely fare, for it is by ceconomy and privation that I have become that which I aiti." The manpers of Pepi were unusually in¬ flated ftUL .aurøphant; and Castruccio won¬ dered what new scene a being, whom he con¬ sidered as half ä buffoon, and half a madman, . intended to, act. A large fire blazed in the middle of the second hall, and a pot hung * over it containing the supper of the family : Pepi took Castruccio's cloak, and spread it
carefully on the high back of a chair; and then he pushed a low bench close to the fire, and the two friends (if so they might be called) sat down. There was no torch or lamp in the room; but the flame of the burning wood cast a broad glare on Benedetto's face, which Castruccio observed with curiosity ; his brows were elevated, his sharp eyes almost emitted sparks of fire, his mouth was drawn down and compressed with a mixed expression of cun¬ ning and pride ; he threw another log on the blazing hearth, and thai began to speak:— " My lord Castruoci", í think it were well that we should instantly enter on our business, since, when we have agreed upon our terms, no time must be lost in our proceeding. My proposition last May, was, as you may remem¬ ber, to restore this town to the Ghibeline 5 , and this is in my power. Cane, the lord of Veiona, is I know about to approach vvith au army to besiege it, and it rests with me whe¬ ther he shall succeed or not. If he do not agree to my terms, he must fail, as I may well say that the keys of this town rest with me. It is true, that when I spoke to you in May, I F 5
did sot know that Can' Grande would attempt the town, and ш that case I should have needed no more aid from you than your mere interposi¬ tion : hut in affairs of importance a mediator's is not ш humble task ; and I hope that you will not disdain to act a friendly part towards uie." Pepi paused with an inquisitive look ; and Castruccio, assuring him of his amicable dis¬ positions, intreated him to continue his expla¬ nation, aud to name what he called his terms. Benedetto continued : " My terms are these, and truly they may easily be fulfilled; of course Cane only wishes to take the town out of the haude of the Guelphs, and to place it in trust with some sure Ghibeline ; now kt him make me lord of Cremona, and I will engage, first to put the town into his hands, and afterwards on receiving the investiture, to aid him with men during war, and pay him a tribute in time of peace. If he agree to this, let bim only lead his troops to the gate of the town, and it ¿hall be his without costing him one drop of blood." Castruccio listened with uncontrolable asto¬ nishment. He looked at die wrinkled and hardly human face of the speaker, his uncouth
gait and manners, end could «carcely restrain his contempt ; he remembered Pepľs want of every principle and his boasted cruelty ; and disgust overcame every otiier feeling ; but, con¬ sidering that it was as well to underatand the whole ofthe man's drift, after a momenťs pause he replied : u And where are tiie keys of the town which you say are in your possession ? " 44 Would you see them ? " cried Pepi, starr¬ ing up with a grin of triumph 5 " follow me, and you shall behold them." He called his old woman, and, taking the lamp from her hand, he bade her prepare the supper; and then with quick steps he conducted Castruccio from tiie apartment : they crossed the court into the second hall, and he opened the door of the secret staircase. After Pepi had again carefully closed it, he opened an¬ other door on the staircase, which Castruccio fiad not before observed, and which was in¬ deed entirely concealed in the dirty plaster of the wall. " Even she," said Pepi, pointing towards tiie hall, " even my old witch, does not know of thi* ο^η^." After closing it, he led the way ihrough a
dark gallery, to another long and narrow flight of stairs, which seemed fed lead to the vaults underneath the castle. Castruccio paused before, he began to descend, so deeply wa» he impressed with the villainy of his companion ; but, remembering that they were man to r«™, and that he was young and strong, and his companion oid and weak, and that he was armed wnth a sword, while Pepi had not even a knife at his girdle, he followed his conductor down the stairs. Flight after flight succeeded, until he thought they would never end; at length they came to another long gallery, win- do wless and damp, which by its close air in¬ dicated that it was below the surface of the ground, and then to various dreary and mil- devved vaults in one of which stood two large chests. " There," cried Pepi, " are the keys of the town/' 44 Where?" asked Castruccio, impatiently, " I see them not/' Pepi turned to him with a grin of joy ; and, taking two keys from his bosom, he knelt down, and exerting his strength, turned them in their
jocks, and thf&w back the, Hds of the, chests, first one, and then the others they were tilled with parchments. "I do not understand this mummery ; how can these musty parchments be the ke¿s of your town ? " Pepi rubbed his hands vvith triumphant glee; he almost capered with delight; unable to stand still, he walked up and down the vault, crying, " They are not musty I they are parch¬ ments of this age! they are signed, they are sealed ;—read them ! read them í " Castruccio took upone> ä and found it to he a »bond obliging the signer to pay the sum ot twenty thousand -crowns on a certain day, in return fur certain mojsie^^itó, or to forfeit the sum of thhty thousand, secured ón the landb of a noble count of Cremona«. , " They are usurious bonds," said Castruc¬ cio, throwing it down angrily. "They are," replied Pepi, picking up the deed, and folding it carefully ; " ^aid 1 not well that I had the keys øfrthe town ? Every noble owes me a part, many the best part, of bis estate. Many bonds are forfeited; and the
mulct hangs over the signer by a single thread. There is count Grimaldi, whose bond was due the very day after his castle was plundered and burned, and his lands iaid waste by the Ger¬ mans; he owes me more than he can ever pay, though his last acre with his patent of nobility went with it, and he after with his brats, to beg at the doors of the Guelphs, his friends. There is the marquess M al voglio who bought the life of his only son, a rank traitor, from the emperor by the sums which I ient him, which have never been repaid. This box is full of the bonds made before the siege of Cremona ; it was concealed above in my tower when you last visited me; and this is full of those made since that time ; you see the harvest the good emperor brought me. When the Germans quitted the town, my halls were £Ued with the beggarly Guelph nobility—— ť Messer Benedetto, my wife has not a garment to cover her ! ' < Messer Benedetto, my palace is in ruins ! ' ' Messer Benedetto, my beds are destroyed, my walls are bare of furniture 1 '— ' Oh \ Messer Benedetto, without your aid my children must starve 1 '
44 * Aye, my friends,* said Ï, * I will help you most willingly ; here are parchments to sign, and gold to spend î —For in the interim I had called in my debts from various otiier towns, and had two chests of gold ready for the gaping hounds ; some read the bonds, and complained of the conditions ; the greater number signed without reading them ; none have been paid ; now they are all mine, body and soul; aye, with these bonds, the devil himself might buy them." " And this is the trade hy which you have become rich, and to support which you have sold your paternal estate ŕ " "Ahl Messer Castruccio," replied Pepi, his countenance falling; " not only have I sold every acre, but I have starved myself, exposed myself by my beggarly garb to the jeers and mocks of every buffoon and idiot, who had been weaned but a year from his mother's milk : a knight in sheep-skin was an irresisti¬ ble subject for ridicule; 1 have been patient and humble, and by my submissive mien hav£ lulled my debtors into security, till the day of payment passed ; then I have come upon them,
received no payment, but got fiesh bonds, and then with renewed hypocrisy, blinded them again till I have drawn their very souls from their bodies ;—and they and theirs are mine. Why, Cane is himself my debtor, here is his bond for ten thousand florins of gold, which I will burn with my own hands, when by his exertions I am made lord of Cremona." Castruccio, who had steadily curbed his contempt, now, overcome by indignation, burst forth like thunder on his host: "Thou vile Jew," he exclaimed, " utter not those words again ! Thou, lord of Cremona ! A usurer, a bloodsucker !—Why all the moisture squeezed from thy miserable carcase would not buy one drop of the noble heart's tide of your debtors. -—And these parchments ! Thinkcst thou men are formed of straw to be bound with paper chains? Have they not arms? have they not swords r Tremble, foolish wretch ! Be what thou art,—a sycophant.— No t thou art not hu¬ man ; but in these filthy vaults thou hast swol¬ len, as a vile toad or rank mushroom ; and then, because thou canst poison men, thou wouklst lord it over them! Now, thou base-minded
fellow, bè advised to cast off these presump¬ tuous thoughts, or with my armed heel I will crush thee in the dust ! " Pepi was pale with rage ; and, with a ma¬ lignant, distorted smile, which his quivering lips could hardly frame, he said, " Fair words, my lord of Lucca ; remember this is my pa¬ lace, these vaults are mine, and of these pas¬ sages I atone have the key, knovv alone of their existence." " Slave î do you threaten r " Castruccio had scarcely uttered these words, when he perceived Pepi gliuing behind him ; with eyes that flashed fire, he darted round, and transfixed by their gaze the wretched trai¬ tor ; as he cast up his arm with the passionate gesture of indignation and command, Pepi grew pale with terror; it seemed to him, аз if he already felt the menaced vengance of his youthful enemy ; his sharp eyes became glazed, his knees trembled, his joints relaxed, and the dagger that he had already drawn from his bo¬ som fell from his nerveless hand. All had passed so silently, that the fall of the weapon »eenied to strike like thunder on the pavement,
and it re-echoed along the vaults. Castruccio smiled with a feeling top lofty even to admit contempt ; it was the smile of power alone.— Pepi fell upon his knees ; when, suddenly per¬ ceiving that Castruccio glanced his eye from the lamp to the parchments, and then to the lamp again, the fear of losing his precious do¬ cuments overcame every other feeling, and he tried, prostrate as he was, to dart past his foe, and blow out the light ; Castruccio waved his hand to keep him off, and the miserable traitor again shrunk back, and fell upon the ground ia an agony of impotent rage and terror, Castruccio now spoke in a restrained and firm tone : " Fear not ţ I came hither аз a friend ; and, though you have broken your faith with me, yet will I not mme with you :«—I pro¬ mised not to betray your secret, and I will not. But remember ; if by these or any other means you attempt to oppress your townsmen, I will raise such a nest of hornets about you, that then, as now, you may intreat my mercy. Now give me the keys of your vaults and passages ; and then up, and «Lew me the way from tiiis infernal den·"
Ch. V.] VÍjbPJ£BGA. 115 Trembling and aghast, his strait hps white with fear, Pepi gathered himself from the pave* ment ; with unwilling hand he gave up the keys of his vault, cast one lingering glance on his treasure, and then, followed by Castruccio, who held the lamp, he quitted liis den with a hesitating and unequal gait ; for his late terror made him halt, and even his coward fear lest Castruccio should yet stab him in the back aa they ascended the stairs. The doors were un¬ locked and thrown open ; for no time was al¬ lowed, as in descending, for the careful draw¬ ing of bolts and turning of locks in their pro· gress. Castruccio was eager to kave the pet» tilentiai air of the place, and to bid farewel to his treacherous and loathsome host· T i^y at length arrived at the head of the stairca зе ; and Pepi wouid have opened the door thüt led to the hall. ^Downjviliainl^criedCastruccia '4etmô go tiie shortest way from yourdevuish abode/' 44 But your cloak ; you laft your cloak in the further hall," 44 It is my legacy to thee, old fox ; —*it will.
serve to wrap your crazed limbs, and to remind you of my promises when you descend again to your tomb." Pepi went down stairs, and opened the se¬ veral doors of his palace ; and Castruccio hast¬ ened past him, feeling new life as he breathed the fresh air of the open street. His enemy, now seeing him on the ojther side of the gates, threw off his ťerrors, and collecting all his ma¬ lice from his h^art to his miserable physiogno¬ my, he said . My lord Castruccio, might I say one word to you ? " 44 No, not one syllable : remember this night, and so farewel/' 44 Yet not farewel without my curse ; and that I will spit after thee, if thou hadst the speed of an eagle." Th? impotent wretch grinned and stamped with rage, when he saw his enemy pass on un¬ heeding, and quickly disappear. Yet anger was not a passion that could long hold possession of the heart of Benedetto ; he remembered that his dear chests were safe; and, although he still shuddered at their imminent peril, yet he
satisfied himself with the deep contempt he felt towards his foe, who had allowed him, while thus in his power, to escape unhurt. As he ascended the stairs he gazed on the lamp, and with a ghastly smile, said : "Thou wert the instrument he purposed to use, and I will tread thee to dust. His time will come, and his heart's blood and his soul's agony shall repay me for my wrongs ; and so will I wind my snares, that he himself shall proclaim me lord of Cremona." In a journey that Castruccio made to Lom¬ bardy some years after, he enquired concerning his old enemy ; and, hearing that he was dead, lie listened with curiosity to the relation of the last scenes of Benedetto's life. r Ten days after their interview (in the September of the year 1317), Cane della Scala approached Cremona to besiege it ; but, after passing ноте weeks - before 4lie walls, the rains, and the ravages vvhich had been effected in the teni tory of hb allies, the M odenese, obliged him to withdraw. Whether Pepi were terrified by the warning of Castruccio, or feared a bimilar reception to his propositions from Can' Grande, cannot be
known : but it is certain that he made no ef¬ fort to enter into a treaty with him at that time. în the month of March of the following year Cane received a visit from the ambitious usurer at his palace in Verona. Pepi had grown wise by experience, and in this interview managed his treaty with great skill. He bought fer the occasion a vest of scarlet silk and boote of Tartarian fur; fastening on his gilt spurs, throwing his gold fringed cloak over his shoul¬ ders, and putting on his head a conical cap of the newest fashion, encircled with a golden band, he mounted a good horse ; and, thus ca¬ parisoned, he appeared, in his own and in his V old woman's eyes, as accomplished and noble a knight as by the stroke of a sword it wer w possible to dub; nor did he, in his conference with Cane, mention what his means were by which he intended to betray the city, but mere¬ ly boasted of his power of admitting the army ofthe lord of Verona, if it should appear before tiie gates, and named, as the condition of this service, his being instituted its lord in vassalage to Cane, if his Ghibeline townsmen should
agree to receive him as their chief. The veteran commander easily acceded to these stipulations; and, the time and other circumstances being agreed upon, Pepi returned to Cremona to pre¬ pare for his future government. His great art consisted in attacking all the nobles for their debts at the same time ; and these were so numerous, and of so considerable an amount, that it created much confusion in a town which had been enfeebled by perpetual wars. The nobles, as Castruccio had predict¬ ed, reflected that they had arms in their hands, and that their debts being all due to one man, they could by his death easily free their shoul¬ ders from a heavy burthen. It was then that Pepi began to disclose to each separately his readiness to destroy their bonds, if through their means he was admitted to be lord of Cremona. The Ghibelines objected the strong opposition they should meet with from the Guelphs; to these he confided the hopes he entertained of aid from Cane della Scala. The Guelphs, now much enfeebled, appeared more tractable, since he endeavoured to persuade them that it would be wholly İn his power to
prevent the Ghibelines from exiling thero ; and he promised to act as a moderator between the parties. He was lbtened to, and many pro» mised him their assistance, each in his heart despibing the usurer, but believing that each by his single vote would be of no service to raise hmi to the sovereignty, and that by fair words they should discharge their heavy debts. Pepi had so managed, that he had got the keys of one of the gates into possession ; he ad¬ mitted the troops of the lord of Verona ; but he found that after all he did not possess the influence he had hoped over the minds of hi» townsmen. When the Ghibeline war-cry was raised, all the Guelphs of the city, distrusting either the promises or the power of their cre¬ ditor, assembled in aims ; and a tumult ensued, vvhich ended in the defeat of the popular pai- ty, and the triumphant entrance of Cane into the town. Pepi fell in that tumult: whether by a chance- blow, or by the resolved dagger of one of hi.s debt- ois, cannot be ascertained. But hi.s dead bod) was discoveied among the .slain ; and, so great was the enmity of his townsmen against him,
that, although Cane and his troops had already entered the city, the whole population rushed in fury towards his palace, and in a few houis the massy walls, the high tower, and all the boasted possessions of Pepi were, as himself, a loathsome and useless ruin. The hidden and unknown vaults were undisturbed ; and the pa¬ per wealth of the usurer lay buried there, to rot in peace among the mildews and damps of those miserable dungeons.

CHAPTER Vi. Galeazzo Visconti ai Florence.-— Castruccio and Euthanasia meet at Valperga : Doubts and Ilesert e . Immediately after the restoration of the marquess of Este to the government of Ferrara, Galeazzo Visconti returned to Milan; and thence, after a short delay, he made a journey to Florence, The apparent motive of this vi- >it was to accompany a younger brother, who had been long betrothed to a Florentine lady ; and the period had now arrived for the celebra¬ tion of their marriage. But he had other beeret 'views : he had heard of the engagement or Castruccio to the countess of Valperga ; and, Ids name being famous as belonging to a Guelph family, he thought that he had now- discovered the cause of the peace concluded b\ Castruccio vvith Florence, and he resolved to ascertain the motives and pians of his friend ;
and if the countess were really the jealous Guelph fame gave her out to be, he determined i-r\ Jt"inrű ITC»|t-|Ať>t* firtlhrO rir*»" t 0 1 Л uh Г\Г~ьА t-ŕ\ ri'» cr f. ι vi ч t,\J Si Un v wvi vi.Ví* tti Hiibl· liv/1 j mJCUWUll IV/UiOliUl U their union. The destined bride of young Azzo Visconti was a near relation of Euthanasia. The fa¬ mily of Adimari to which she belonged, al¬ though originally Guelphs, had been united to the party of the Bianchi, and had been ex¬ pelled with them ; with the exception of that branch whicii adhered to the Neri, of which the father of Euthanasia was the chief. But the children of several of these exiles continued with those of their relations who remained iu Florence; and Fiammetta dei Adimari, al¬ though the daughter of an oxile of the faction of the Bianchi, had continued to' rende in Florence under the protection of an aunt. Her father had made himself famous щ the wars of Lombardy; and it was there that the union between her and Azzo Visconti. hud been pro¬ jected. When the youth came with Galeazzo to ce¬ lebrate the marriage, Fiammetta removed to the palace of Euthanasia, it being from ht r
abode, as the head of the family, that the bride ought to be taken, when her husband should come to demand her. Galeazzo calculated on the frequent occasions of meeting that this circumstance would afford, to commence the plot he had formed on the mind of Euthanasia. These illustrious visitors were received with honours by the magistrates of Florence: a palace was assigned for their abode, and seve¬ ral nobles were commissioned to shew them all ihat was curious in the city. Florence was then one of the finest towns in Italy ; yet cer¬ tainly its beauty must have been far inferior to that vvhich it boasts at present. Its chief orna¬ ments were palaces of massy stone, surmounted by high towers, each able to sustain a siege : some specimens of this architecture, the Pa¬ lazzo Strozzi, and the Palazzo Pitti, now a ducal residence, exist to this day. They aie grand and imposing: but the sombre air which they give to the streets, was better suited to those warlike and manly times, than to the taste of the present age, when the Italian hea¬ ven shines on few who would defend their own horne, though iti strength were that of an im-
pregnable fortress. The Cathedral, or Duomo, afterwards the pride of Florence, was then just commenced, but the extent of its area, and the solidity of its foundations,j usti fied the high tom* of the public decree for its erection, which de¬ clared that it should surpass in beauty eveiy other building then existing in Italy, and be the wonder of the modern world. 1\mong other curiosities, Galeazzo was conducted to the dens of the numerous lions and lionesses kept at the expence of the republic : there were nearly an hundred of these animals, that lived sumptuously, maintained by the super¬ stition of the Florentines, who believed their welfare to be symbolical of that of the state. In their visits to these wonders of Huronee the Visconti were accompanied by many ofthe young nobles of both sexes, and Euthanasia and Fiammetta were among the number. Ga¬ leazzo, from the moment, of his arrival, harl directed his entire attention to the unravelling the character of Euthanasia, and from all that he heard and saw, became convinced that bhe was the cause ofthe fluctuations of Casti ue- eio's mind, and that their union must be pic-
vented; otherwise he would never proceed against the Guelphs with tlie vigorous hosti¬ lity which was necessary to their suppression. At first Galeazzo kept apart from Euthanasia ; he was unwilling to enter into conversation with her, until, finding out the secret chords of her mind, he might play upon them with a masters hand. They visited among the other curiosities of Florence the tomb of the family of the Solda- nieri. This vast receptacle for the dead was built under ground, and received but small light from a grated window which opened into one ofthe cloisters of the church : it was the cus¬ tom of this family to coffin their dead in brazen statues, apparently armed cap-à-pié; and these statues were mounted on brazen figures of horses, so that the population of the cemetery resembled a party of armed knights ready for action. The tomb was viewed by the light of innumerable torches; and there was a grim solemnity in the appearance of this troop of bronze horses, each carrying the brazen statue which imitated the living form and mien of the corpse therein coffined, that might well strike
the spectator with awe ; each voice was hushed as they gazed, and the younger part of the as¬ sembly hastened to quit a place which damped all their hilarity. The lights disappeared vvith them ; and for a while Euthanasia lingered be¬ hind almost in the dark ; for the solitary torch that remained, could hardly do more than make darkness visible ; and the sunbeam which hail strayed from its right path into the abode of the dead, tinged with its light a few of the casques of the knights, who, though their eves and brain were within the case, neither saw nor felt the ray. Such a sight must have im¬ pressed any one with melancholy; all was stili; ------Euthanasia, apparently surrounded by an armed band on horseback, for the twilight gave life to the figures, yet felt about her the silence of death ; her own step, her own breath, were noisy intruders in the cavern :—nor did her mute companions rest in an enchanted sleep— they were dead,—decay was at work among tlieir frames, and the chill of mortality exhaling from the brass, made the vault as cold аь it was silent. She left the tomb vvith slow steps; and, at
the foot of the stairs by which she would mount to daylight, Galeazzo was waiting to conduct her. Her companions were already far distant ; their voices even had died away ; and, as she traversed the cloisters, she appeared little inclined to break tiie silence between her¬ self and her companion. At length Galeazzo spoke ; and, after a few trivial remarks on the î-cene which they had visited, he said : " I have long sought tlie opportunity now afforded me, Madonna Euthanasia, to intro¬ duce myself more particularly to your notice. As the friend of Castruccio, I hope to find myself already recommended to some portion of your kindness and regard." Euthanasia replied with courtesy to this speech ; and Galeazzo continued : " Being at the head of the Ghibelines of Lombardy, it is not wonderful that an intimacy should subsist between Castruccio and myself;—for our in¬ terests are the same ; and, if by his alliance 1 hope to extend my dominion in the north of Italy, I trust that my name as his friend and ally, will aid him in his future designs even on this town itself/*
44 His designs on this town ! " repeated Eu¬ thanasia. 44 Aye ; for in truth he encourages the hope, whether it be wild or practicable I hardly know, of overthrowing this nest of republicans, and making himself prince or imperial vicar of Tuscany. But why should I talk of his plans to you, Madonna, who must know them far better than I ? Besides, it may be dangerous to speak here, even in whispers, of such things ; who knows if some Guelph may not overhear me?" 44 Indeed,my lord," replied Euthanasia, with a faint smile, " you divine like an astrologer ; for truly I overhear you, and I am a Guelph." " A Guelph ! " repeated Galeazzo, with well feigned astonishment;—" Are you notan Adi- mari ? Madonna Euthanasia dei Adimari r " " I am also countess of Valperga ; and that name will perhaps unravel the enigma. Y'es, my lord, I am a Guelph and a Florentine ; it cannot therefore be pleasing to me, to hear that Castruccio has formed such designs upon my native town. Yet I thought that I knew him well ; and, if you had not seen him since ou ι¬
separation, 1 should believe that your informa¬ tion was founded on some mistake. As it is— tell me, if you be not bound to secrecy, what you know of his plans." 44 Madonna, Castruccio honours me with the title of his friend, and secresy and faith are the bonds of friendship. W hen I spoke so un¬ guardedly of his designs, I thought I spoke to one who knew them far better than myself: if I have unawares betrayed the concealed coun¬ sels of Antelminelii, I do most bitterly repent me; and do you graciously remit to me my fault,, by laying no stress on my foolish words." Euthanasia was silent ; her mind was too much disturbed to know immediately what part to take. She had believed in Castruccio's promises of peace ; and the foundations of her very life seemed to give way, when his faith appeared tainted with falsehood. She knew him to be ambitious ; and suddenly the thought struck her, that Galeazzo alluded only to his romantic conception of future union among the Italian states, into which she also had en¬ tered, and whicii might easily be mistaken for schemes of war and conquesti Upon this be-
lief she renewed the conversation, and told her companion that he must have mistaken the meaning of Castruccio ; that it was that chief's wish, as it was of all patriotic Italians, to unite the factions that caused so much bloodshed and misery to their country ; but that war was not the measure he intended to adopt to bring about a pacific termination. It was now Galeazzo's turn to be silent; he looked clown, and answered in monosyllables, and seemed to wish to make Euthanasia be¬ lieve, that she might have divined well the plans of Castruccio, though he could not him¬ self believe they were of so peaceful a rftiture. Euthanasia continued to talk ; for she seemed to gather faith in what she desired from her own words. Galeazzo remained silent, and replied with downcast eyes to her appealing words and looks ;—at length, after a pause, he appeared to make a struggle to throw off the embarassment of his demeanour; and looking up, " Madonna," said he, " let me intreat you to mention this subject no more. If I thought that your conjectures were right, I would frankly say so; but I do not;—-each word
that you utter makes me believe that Antelmi¬ nelii conceals his tiue designs from you ; and, since he has chosen me as the depositary of his secret, I should be a traitor to friendship and honour, if I disclosed it. You will see him soon, and then you can unravel the mys¬ tery ; in the mean time, I pray you rest con¬ tent with my assurance, that Castruccio me¬ ditates nothing unworthy his name and glory." These few words destroyed the peace of Euthanasia. She became sorrowful and dis¬ turbed ; her countenance, betraying the secret of her heatt, no longer displayed that calm and softness which were before its characteristics ; the brightness of her eyes, if it was not quench¬ ed, only shone forth at intervals, and she min¬ gled most unwillingly in the festivities of the nuptial ceremony. Galeazzowatehed her care¬ fully ; he perceived tht? effect his words had had on her ; and he determined to follow them up by a system of conduct, which should leave no doubt in her mind as to the truth of hia assertions. Instead of avoiding Euthanasia, he now sought her society on all occasions, and often talked to her of Castruccio, whom
he always mentioned in a style of excessive praise ; yet with this he contrived to mix words, hints, or looks, which seemed to say that he followed other counsels, and devised other schemes than those ef which she was aware ; meanwhile all this was done in so light a man¬ ner, touched on so cursorily, and then dismiss¬ ed, that, as she listened, the clue of truth slipt from her, and she felt as if lost İn a pathless wilderness. The preparations for the marriage were sumptuous. Every day large parties assem¬ bled at the palace of Euthanasia ; and, when the day declined, song and dance passed away the hours of darkness. The day at length ar¬ rived, when Fiammetta should first be led to church, and thence to tlie palace where her husband resided. Early in the morning she and her noble friends of her own sex prepared for the ceremony, by attiring themselves in the most magnificent manner. Gold and jewels sparkled on their robes, and their dark hair twisted with pearls, hung in tresses on their shoulders ; married ladies only were admitted to the nuptial procession and feasts ; and Eu-
thanasia alone, as an independent chieftainess and sovereign, claimed an exemption from this rule. This day, so gay in appearance, and full of joyous demonstrations, Euthanasia had passed more sadly, than if she had spent it in silence and solitude, where she would not have been obliged to hide the sorrow she felt at her heart. In the evening Galeazzo informed her, that a courier, coming from Ferrara, had brought a letter to him from Castruccio ; and he appear¬ ed with difficulty to yield to her intreaties to shew it to her. It contained merely excuses for his delay at Ferrara, and mentioned his speedy return :—" Yet," added he, " I shall not meet you in the cave of the Lioness *, for you will surely be gone before my return- Were it not for a pearl whicii the wild animal guards for me, I would never enter her den but as her enchaîner. But no more of this ; you know my plans ; and, if the viper and the eagle unite in firm accord, surely both her heel and her head may receive a deadly wound."
The meaning of these words was too plain ; the viper was the crest of the Visconti, the eagle of the Antelminelii, and union between them was to destroy fair Florence, her native city. Euthanasia felt sick at heart ; she gave back the letter in silence, and looked as a lily bent by the wind, which bows itself in patience and suffering to the storm. She remembered her vow not to unite herself to the enemy of Flo¬ rence ; and she resolved to abide by İt. Her residence of these few weeks in her native town had endeared its inhabitants to her ; she had renewed her early friendships ; she was again among them, one of them;—and could she unite herself to a man who would bring havoc upon her best friends? She dreaded the re¬ proachful voice of her conscience ; and, in her well regulated mind, the fear of self-condem¬ nation would have been sufficient to deter her from incurring such a penalty : but all the feel¬ ings of her heart here interposed ; her youth¬ ful friendships ; her daily habits of intercourse and mutual kindness. The favourite companion of lier younger days was now married to the chief of one the citizen-bands of Florence, who
would be exposed foremost to the swords of Castruccio's soldiers ; the dearest friend of her father would lead his troop also against them. Her marriage with him, on condition of being « party in his victories over the Florentines, and rejoicing in the death of those she loved, would be as if she united herself to the rack, and bound herself for life, body and soul, to the ever renewing pangs of some tyrant-invent¬ ed torture. It could not be : her resolution was made ; and the energy of her soul quali¬ fied her to complete the sacrifice. The following day Galeazzo and his brother returned with Fiammetta to Milan, They took a kind leave of Euthanasia ; and the last words of Galeazzo were, " Forget, Madonna, all that I may have said to pain you ; let not Castruccio find that I have done him an ill orice in your favour ; and be assured that my sorrow will be most poignant, if you find that 1 have infused erroneous ideas into your mind as to his plans and wishes." Shortly after their departure, news arrived that Castruccio wouid retum to Florence in two days. Euthanasia heard this with trem-
bling ;—but a short tirne before she had earnest¬ ly desired to see him, that she might clear up all her suspicions, and that certainty of good or evil might decide her fate ;—now* she feared the death that might suddenly come to all her hopes; and she fc ] t as if but to gain aday, or a few hours, of doubt and expectation, were to gain so much of life : to insure this she took the hasty resolution of quitting Florence, and returning to her castle before the arrival of her suitor. Accordingly, attended by her domestics alone, after having taken a sudden leave of her friends, she departed. How difierent was her present journey from that undertaken with Castruccio but a few months before ! She was then happy and con¬ fiding ; but now anxious doubt pervaded her, and fears that would not sleep. She had re¬ solved, if the ambition of Castruccio could not content itself except with the destructioa of the liberties of Florence, that she would never be his; but this resolution gave her no calm; the seal neither of life nor death was placed on her hopes : and she strove to expect good ; while the fear of evil flushed her cheek, and
filled her eyes with unshed tears. The year was on its decline ; the myrtle flowers had fa¬ ded from the mountains, and the chesnut-woods were tinged with brown and yellow ; the pea¬ sants were busy among the vines ; and the trellised arbours they had formed, and the sweet shades of green among wdiich the purple grapes hung, were now pulled down, defaced and trodden upon : the swallows were col¬ lecting for their flight, and the chill mornings and evenings announced the near approach of hoary winter. The sluggish scirocco blotted the sky with clouds, and weighed upon the spi¬ rits, making them dull and heavy as itself. Euthanasia saw all this with the observant eye of grief, which refers all things to itself, and forms omens for its own immortality from combinations more unsubstantial than the Sy- billine leaves. The autumnal rains threatened nigh at hand ; and the year had been much curtailed of those sweet days which follow the hot Italian summer, when the hunter feels his bow injured by the heavy dews of night, but when the noonday sun shines vvith tempered heat, and sets leaving the downcast eyelids ol
night heavy with tears for his departure ; when we feel that summer is gone, and winter is coming, but the fresh=looking evergreens, the stately cypress, the fruit-burthened olive, and the dark ilex, tell us that nature is not merely a fair-weather friend. Our sorrowing tra¬ veller compared the quick advance of winter that she now witnessed, with its long delay of the preceding year, and sighed. She arrived at her castle on the first of Oc¬ tober ; and the moment she had arrived, the storm, vvhich for many days had been collect¬ ing from the south the force of autumnal rains and thunders, broke over her head. The white lightning sped in forked chains around the sky, and without pause or interval, deluged the midnight heaven with light, which shewed to her, as she stood at the window of h«?r apart¬ ment, the colours of the trees, and even of the few flowers which had survived to witness the advent of the storm. The thunder broke in tremendous and continued peals, and the rain awoke in a moment the dried up sources of the mountain torrents ; yet their liquid career was not heard amidst the tumult : for, if the thunder
paused, the echoes prolonged the sound, and all nature seemed labouring with the commo¬ tion. Euthanasia watched the progress of the tempest; and her ear, filled with its almost deafening noise, could not distinguish the sounds, which at other times would have been audible, of horses' hoofs as they ascended the jock of Valperga, or the clang at the castle- gate, or the letting down of the draw-bridge ; the first sound alien to the storm that visited her sense, was her own name pronounced in a well known and soft voice : "Euthanasia!" u Castruccio! you here?" " Yes, it is I,—Castruccio ;—yet I will in¬ stantly depart, if you command. I have fol¬ lowed fast upon your steps ;—but why are you here ? Why did you not remain at Florence î ** For nearly two years Euthanasia had che¬ rished, unblamed by herself, the most fervent love for Castruccio. The union had been delayed ; but the sentiment continued as a deep and clear stream, or rather like a pure lake, which in its calmness reflects more vividly and enduringly the rock that hangs eternally
above it, than does the tempesťshaken water. They had been separated nearly three months ; and, now that she saw and heard him again, her first impulse was, clasped in his arms, to seal with one caress a joyous forgiveness ; but she chocked herself. Confounded by his sud¬ den appearance, and distracted by the many feelings that pressed upon her, she wept:—she wept long and silently ; while her lover stood near her without speaking, looking at her by the glare of the continued lightnings, as they flashed in fast succesion, and made day in the chamber. After a long pause, he spoke with less im¬ petuosity : "Why did you not remain at Flo¬ rence?" She looked up at him, and her voice quiver¬ ed, as she replied : " I cannot tell you now ; I am confused, and words refuse themselves to me : my heart is full, and I am most unhappy, —to-morrow I will explain all." "Now or never;—Euthanasia, you must not trifle with me,—are you mine ì " " If you are your own." " What does this mean f" cried Castruccio,
starting. " Of what then do you accuse me f You speak in riddles: understand, I intreat you, a plain speech, and answer me with frankness. 1 love you ; I have long loved you ; and you alone have so long delayed the union which God knows how much I desire. Now you have brought it to a crisis :—-Will you be mine?" It is difficult to answer the language of pas¬ sion with that of reason : besides Euthanasia was not herself passionless, and there was a feeling in her heart that pleaded more strongly in Castruccio's favour than all his arguments. She felt subdued ; yet she was angry with her¬ self for this, and remained a long time silent, endeavouring to collect heiself. At length she replied : '' Why do you press me to answer you now ? or rather, consult your own heart, and that will answer for me. You have known mine long,—I love you ;—but I have other duties besides those which I owe to you, and those aliali be fulnlled. My father's lessons must not be forgotten, when the first occasion ar¬ rives for putting them in practice ; nor must I
be wanting to that sense of duty, which until now has been the rule of my life. I am a Florentine; Florence is my native country; nor will I be a traitor to it." 44 Well,—and what do you conclude from this?" , 4t Are you not the enemy of Florence ì Are you not contriving war and chains for its hap¬ py and free state ? You turn away impatiently ; to-morrow I will see you again, and you will then have reflected on my words : my fate de¬ pends on your true and frank reply to my question. Now leave me; I am worn out and fatigued, and to-night I cannot support the struggle into which you would lead me. To-morrow I shall see you ; farewel ; the ^torm has now passed, and the rain has quite ceased. Good night ! " 44 You leave me thus ; and thus you reward me for suspense, jeal\ioy and despair. Good night, Euthanasia. You sacrifice me to a bubble, to the shadow of a bubble,—be it so ! Great God ! that you should be influenced by such a chimæra ! Well, you decide ; and I shall expect your award with what patience I may. Again, good night."
He left her to doubt, suspense and grief. Bui her high raind bore her through all ; and, having marked for herself the line of duty which she believed she ought to pursue, the natural enthusiasm of her character aided her to strug¬ gle with the misery whicii her sensibility in¬ flicted upon her. Castruccio himself came to her aid ; and die events which followed fast on the scene of this night, served to strengthen her resolution, and, if they did not make the sacrifice more easy, they renderedits necessity more palpable.
CHAPTER VIL Ccstruccio exiles three hundred Families front Lucca* — Visits at Valperga—His Character further developed. DURING his absence Castruccio had reduced in his own mind his various political plans to a system. He no longer varied either in the end which he desired to attain, or the means by which he resolved to accomplish it. He thought coolly on the obstacles in his way ; and he resolved to remove them. His end was die conquest of Tuscany ; his means, the en¬ slaving of his native town ; and, with the true disposition of a conqueror and an usurper, he began to count heads to be removed, and hands to be used, in the furtherance of his de¬ signs. He had no sooner returned to Flo¬ rence, than messengers brought him intelli¬ gence of a plot, which wouid speedily break out in Lucca to deprive him ef his govcrn- VOL. II. II
ment ; and this information, joined to the de¬ parture of Euthanasia, determined him in¬ stantly to return to the Lucchese territory. , He was no longer the same as when he had quitted it; he returned full of thought,—with' a bent brow, a cruel eye, and a heart not to be moved from its purpose by weakness or hu¬ manity. The change might appear sudden, yet it had been slow ;-—it is the last drop that overflows the brimming cup,—and so with him the ambition, light-heartedness, and pride which he had long been nourishing, now hav¬ ing made for itself a form, " a habitation and a name," first manifested itself in its true co¬ lours to the eyes of man. Ambition, and the fixed desire to rule, smothered in his mind the voice of his better reason ; and the path of ty¬ ranny was smoothed, by his steady resolve to obtain the power, which under one form or other it had been the object of his life to seek. The morning after his return to Lucca he reviewed his troops: they were devoted to him, and by their means he intended to secure his power. He assembled the senate, and surrounded the palace of government with his
soldiers ; he took his seat at its head, 'with the countenance of one who knows, and can pu¬ nish his enemies. He addressed the assem¬ bly in few words, saying, that it was by their power he had been raised to the government, and that it now behoved them to support him in its exercise. " I know/' he cried, " I have many enemies here,—but let any one of them ste^ forth, and say the ill that I have done to the republic ;<—I who have fought its battles, secured its prosperity, and raised it from the being the servant of proud Florence to be its rival. What, will none of you come forward to denounce me, now that I appear, face to face, to answer your accusations ? Randolfo Obizzi, I call upon you, who would despoil me of the power this senate conferred upon me ;—and you, Aldino, who have plotted even ray death ;—can ye whisper аз traitors, and cannot ye speak as men ì Away !—the mo¬ ment of mercy is short :—three hours hence the gates of Lucca will be shut, and whoever among you or your parüzans are found within its walls, will pay the forfeit of his life for his temerity." Η 2
The senate would now have broken up; but, when Castruccio saw that his enemies had all departed, he called on the rest to stay, and aid him on this momentous occasion. The decree for banishing the conspirators was then formally passed, and another for demolishing three hundred towers of so many palaces, which were as strong holds and fortressess within the town. The senate was then dis¬ missed,—the troops paraded the streets, and before night-fail three hundred families, de¬ spoiled of their possessions, and banished their native town, passed through its gates in mourn¬ ful procession. The soldiers w T ere employed in demolishing the towers ; and the ruins were carried to the eastern quarter of the city, to be used in the erection of a new wall. Castruc¬ cio, now master of Lucca, and triumphant over his enemies, felt that he had taken the first step in the accomplishment of his plans. Euthanasia had remained in her castle in anxious expectation of a visit or a message from Castruccio ;—neither came : but late in the afternoon Teresa Obizzi, one of her dear¬ est fñeads, was announced to her.
" Why so mournful, dear Teresa r " asked her friend. "What has happened? Are you also unfortunate?" 44 1 hardly know what has happened, or where I am," replied Teresa. "Methinks the thunder of heaven has fallen among us ; all the Obizzi family is banished Lucca, and not these alone, but the Bernardi, the Filip¬ pini, the Alviani, and many more, are exiled, and their possessions confiscated/' " Why, how is this ? What new change has occurred in Lucca ? " " Nothing new, dear countess. In truth I believe there was a plot against Antelminelii, and that some of the Obbzi were concerned in it. But Castruccio examines nothing ; and, including us all in one general sentence, has wrapt us like a whirlwind, and carries us, God alone knows whither. And my poor lather ! I threw myself at the consul's feet ; yes, I, the wife of the proud Galeotto Obizzi, and prayed that my poor father might be al¬ lowed to remain." " And he refused ? '* " He said, i You have heard the sentence; he
best knows whether he be implicated in it ; I have sworn by God and St. Martin that this nest of Guelphs and Neri shall be rooted out of Lucca, and that the will of the senate shall be obeyed. Let him look to it ; for after three hours the life of a partizan of the Obizzi will be held no dearer than the earth on which I tread/ " " Castruccio said this ? Did he answer you thus, Teresa ? " " He did, dear Euthanasia ; but í must away; I came to bid you farewel,—a long farewel ; my father and my husband wait for me ; pray God to pity us ;—farewel I " "Not so,Teresa. This castie is not his, and may afford an asylum to his victims. Come here; repose here awhile at least. Bring your father, your babes; come and teach me what sorrow is, and learn from me to bear t with fortitude." As the evening advanced, others of her friends arrived, and confirmed all that Eutha¬ nasia had before heard. She was confound¬ ed, and unable to believe that it was indeed Castruccio who had caused these evils.
Whence arose this sudden change in his cha¬ racter i Yet, was it sudden ? or, was there indeed any change ? She remembered words and looks, before forgotten, vvhich told her that what now took place was the offspring of deep thought and a prepared scheme. Yet again, unable to believe the full extent of the evil that she heard, she sent to Lucca to intreat Arrigo Guinigi to hasten to her. Arrigo was vvith Castruccio when the message came. " Go, my dear boy," said the latter ; " her woman's heart trembles perhaps at this day's work. Shew her the necessity of it; and make her think as little unkindly of me as you can. Notwithstanding her coldness and perplexing ideas about duty, I love her, and must not have her be my enemy. If she would be con¬ tent with any thing except the peace vvith Flo. rence for her morgincap, all my power and possessions were at her feet # ."
A и ¡go went to Valperga: Euthanasia saw him alone ; and, pale and almost breathless, she asked w hat had caused this change, and whether he knew what the schemes of Cas¬ truccio were ? " Indeed, Madonna," replied Arrigo, " ï do not ; I believe that he aims only at the security of his own state ; and many of those he has exiled had plotted against his government," 44 It is possible ; tyrants ever have enemies ; but it were as well to raze the city, as to ba¬ nish all her citizens. There cannot be less than a thousand souls included in his edict; women and infants, tom from all the comforts all the necessaries of daily life, cast upon the world to weep and call down curses on him. What does he mean ŕ " " He suspects all whom he has banished, and has strong secret reasons for his conduct ; of that, Euthanasia, you may be sure. When I asked him why he banished so many of his
pcrt;\ Laws were made in some states to rebtrain tiiis excessive generosity, but the custom of the mor~ gincap continued a long time in Florence.
fellow-citizens, he replied laughing, * Because this city is not big enough for them and me.* And then he told me seriously, tliat his life was alone preserved by the vigorous measures of this morning." " Be it so ; I wish I could believe him ; I do indeed trust that there is nothing wanton in his severity ; yet methinks he had better have banished himself, th?.n so many families, who now go as beggars through the world. He also was banished once; they say that princes learn from adversity ; I believe it ; they learn a cunning in cruelty the prosperous can never know." " Nay, dear countess, speak not so hardly of him. Castruccio was born to rule; he is noble-minded, but firm of resolution ; and can you blame him for securing a life on which tlie welfare of Lucca, perhaps of Italy, depends ì " Euthanasia did not reply ; she knew, al¬ though from the gentleness of her nature she had never participated in it, that there was then in Italy a spirit of cruelty, a carelessness for the life and pain ofothers, which rendered it lcbs wonderful that Castruccio should have li 5
adopted a mode of conduct similar to that of most of his contemporaries. It is strange, that man, born to suffering, and often writhing be¬ neath it, should wantonly inflict pain on his fellows ; but however cruel an individual may be, no one is so remorseless as a ruler ; for he 1озез even within himself tiie idea of his own individuality, and fancies that, in pampering hÌ3 inclmations, and revenging his injuries, he is supporting the state ; the state, a fiction, whicii sacrifices that which constitutes it, to the support of its mere name. Euthana¬ sia knew that she ought not to apply the same rule of conduct to a prince, as to a private in¬ dividual; yet that Castruccio should have tainted himself with the common vices of his tribe, was a shock, that unsettled the whole frame of her mind ; it unveiled at once the idol that had dwelt in the shrine of her heart, shewed the falseness of his apotheosis, and forced her to use her faculties to dislodge him from the seat he had usurped. A few days after, Castruccio came himself to the castle of Valperga. He came at a time when many otiier visitors were there, and
among them several whom he knew to be his secret enemies. He took no notice of this ; but, with the frankness of manner for which he was remarkable, he entered into conversa¬ tion with them, and treating them as on a perfect equality with himself, he soon softened the angry mood with which they had at first regarded him. All political discussion was avbided ; and the conversation turned on one of those domestic tragedies which were then too common among the petty courts of Italy, where each little lord possessing supreme power, and unrestrained by principle, was ever ready to wash supposed dishonour from his name in the blood of those who had caused the stigma. The one at present under discus¬ sion was of peculiar hoi ror, and was the more singular, since nature had vindicated her vio¬ lated laws on their infringer, and he who boasted of his morality in indulging his pas¬ sionate revenge, was now pursued by remorse and madness, and the ghosts of his victims hunting him through the world, gave him no rest or hope. One of the company, a Milan¬ ese, said, that it was impossible that remorse
could have caused the madness of Messer Francesco; since ia revenging the injury his wife,had done lam, he only followed the ex* ample set him by. hundred* of his countrymen ; and if he had gose beyond them in cruelty, it merely proved that his love, and his sense of honour transcended theirs." Castruccio replied ; " Far be it from me to plead for those childish notions, which would take the sword out of the band of princes, and make them bind men of iron with chains of straw. But it does surprize me, that any man should dare so to idolize himself, as to sacri¬ fice human victims at the shrine of his pride, jealousy or revenge. Francesco was a mon¬ ster, when he tortured and murdered his wife; he is now a man, and feels the fitting remorse for so foul a deed. Man may force his nature, and commit deeds of horror; but we are all human befogs, all the children of one common mother, who will not suffer that one should agonize the otiier, without suffering in his turn a part of the anguish heJias inflicted*." -.

After a lime the otiier visitors departed ; and Euthanasia was left alone with Castruccio. For a while they were silent; the changeful colours of her cheek might shew, that love had not forgotten its accustomed course, but rushed in a warm flood to her heart, and then ebbed, commanded by a power hardly less strong than that which bids the ocean pause ; the power of virtue in a well formed human heart. Cas« truecio watched her; but, in the returning calmness of her eye, and in her unhesitating voice when she did speak, he read all of fe¬ male softness, but none of female weakness. " Will you pardon me," she said, at length, " if I speak frankly to you ; and not take in ill part the expression of those reflections to which your late words have given rise?" Castruccio smiled, and replied, " Madonna, I know already what you are about to say; but you are mistaken İn your conclusions* 1 said that no man could witli impunity sacri¬ fice the lives of his fellow-creatures to his own

private passions; but you must not torture my meaning ; the head of a state is no longer a private man, and he would act with shame¬ ful imbecility, if he submitted to his enemies because he dared not punish them/' Euthanasia replied to this, and drew a lively picture of the sufferings of the exiles ; but Cas¬ truccio answered laughing, " You speak to one wiser on that subject than yourself. Have not I been an exile ? and do you think that I forget our mournful procession, when we poor Ghi¬ belines left Lucca nearly twenty years ago ? And do you think that the Neri would have reigned, if they had not turned us out; and how should I reign, if I permitted this horde of Guelphs to sit here, and plot in my citadel ? Their very number is an argument against them instead of being one in their favour. But let us leave this discussion, my too compas¬ sionate Euthanasia, and for a moment cast our thoughts on our own situation. There must be some end put to the riddle, some crown to a work, which seems as if it were to have no conclusion* 1 will be frank with you ; I am neither going to turn hermit, and, laying down
my sceptre, to take up with a crucifix : nor like your friends, the holy fathers of the church, am I going to war with money and falsehood, instead of with my sword. I am lord of Lucca, and shall continue so as long as God permits me. I am at the head of the Ghibelines in Tuscany, and my design is that the Ghibelines should put down their old enemies ; and, see¬ ing a fair prospect of success, I shall neither spare words nor blows against those who would oppose me in this undertaking. You are a Guelph; but surely, my dear girl, you will not sacrifice your happiness to a name, or allow party-spirit to get the better of all the more noble feelings of your nature." Euthanasia listened with attention, and an¬ swered in mild sadness ; " It does not appear to me, Castruccio, that I sacrifice any thing noble in my nature, when I refuse to unite my¬ self to the enemy of my country. As a Ghi¬ beline you know that I loved you ; and it is not words aione that cause my change ; fight the Florentines with words only, and I am still yours. But more than I love Florence, or my-
self, or you, Castruccio, do I love peace ; and my heart bleeds to think that the cessation of bloodshed and devastation which our poor dis¬ tracted country now enjoys, is to be of short duration. Have you not lived in a country suffering from war ? Have you not seen the pea¬ sants driven from their happy cottages, their vines torn up, their crops destroyed, often a poor child lost, or haplessly wounded, whose every drop of blood is of more worth than the power of the Cseaars ? And then to behold the tears and despair of these poor creatures, and to find men who would still inflict them,— ană for What ? The bubble is yours, Castruccio,— What wouW you have ? Honour, fame, do¬ minion ? What are these if peace do not pur¬ chase them, but contempt, infamy and despo¬ tism í Öh ! rule your own heart ; enthrone rea¬ son there, make virtue the high priest of your divinity; let the love of your fellow-creatures be your palace to dwell in, and their praises your delicate food and costly raiment ; and, as all sovereigns have dungeons, so do you have them, in which your pride, ambition, and, for-
give the w 7 ord, your cruelty, may he enchained ; and then the purple-clad emperors of Constan¬ tinople may envy your state and power. « Why do you cause this cruel combat ? or, why would you increase the struggle in my heart f As the enemy of Florence I will never be yours; as the deliberate murderer of the playmates of my infancy, of the friends of my youth, of those to whom I am allied by every tie of relationship and hospitality that binds man¬ kind, as such, I will never be yours. Here then is the crown of the work; the sea in which the deep and constant stream of my af¬ fections loses itself,—your ambition. Let these be the last words of contest between us : but if, instead of all that I honour and love in the world, 'you choose a mean desire of power and selfish aggrandizement, still listen to me. Vou are about to enter on a new track, yet one on which the course of thousands of those that have gone before you is to be seen : do not follow these; do not be sanguinary like them ;—the Italians of the present day have all a remcrbdcss cruelty in them, which will stain
the pages of their history with the foulest blots ; let yours be free from these ! 44 Pardon me that I speak to you in this strain. From this moment we are disjoined ; whatever our portions may be, we take them separately. Such is the sentence you pro¬ nounce upon us/* Castruccio was moved by the fervour of Euthanasia ; he tried to alter her determina¬ tion, to argue her from the point of difference between them, but in vain ; he moved her to tears. She wept, but did not reply : her pur¬ pose was fixed, but her heart was weak ; she loved for the first and only time ; and she knew that she sacrificed every hope and joy in life, if she sacrificed Castruccio. But she was firm, and they parted ; a parting that caused every nerve in Euthanasia's frame to thrill with agony. She tried to still these feelings, to forget that she loved; but tears, abundant tears, alone eased the agony of her heart, when she thought, that the soft dreams she had nourished for two years were vain, gossamer tiiat the sun of re-
ality dissipated. Sometimes she schooled her¬ self as being too precise and over-wise, to sa¬ crifice all her hopes to the principles she had set up. But then the remembrance of the grief she had endured during the last war with Flo¬ rence, and the worse struggles she would feel, if she dared unite herself to an enemy, if, by binding her fate to his, she might neither pray for the cause of her husband, nor for that of her beloved country; when to wish well to Castruccio would be to desire the success of tyranny and usurpation ; and to have given her vows to the Florentines in their necessary de¬ fence, was to wish the overthrow of the com¬ panion of her life—the idea of these struggles gave her courage to persevere ; and she hoped, that the approbation of her own heart, and that of her dearest and most valued friends, would in some degree repay her for her suffer¬ ings. She thought of her father and his les¬ sons; and her heart again swelled with the desire ofthe approbation of the good, with the warm and ardent love of right which ever burned within her soul. Hers had been a natural and a lawful passion ; she could not Uve,
believing that she did wrong ; and the high in¬ dependence and graceful pride of her nature wouid never permit her, to,stoop beneath the mark she had assigned as the object of her emulation. Yet when, in the silence of night and of so¬ litude, she consulted her own heart, she found that love had quenched there every other feel¬ ing, and not to love was to her to die. She looked on the quiet earth, where the trees slept in the windless air, and the only sound was the voice of an owl, whose shriek now and then with monotonous and unpleasing sound awoke the silence, and gave a melancholy life to what else were dead; she looked up to the sky where the eternal lamps of heaven were burning ; all was unchanged there ; but for her all was dif¬ ferent. It was on a night, in an Italian au¬ tumn, that she sat under her acacia tree by the basin of the fountain of the rock. To look on the hues of sunset, to see the softened tints of the olive woods, the purple tinge of the distant mountains, whose outline was softly, yet di¬ stinctly marked m the orange sky ; to feel the western breeze steal across her cheek, like
words of love from one most dear; to sec the first star of everøng penetrate from out the glowing western firmament, and whisper the secret of distant worlds to us m our narrow prison ; to behold the heaven-pointing cypress with unbent spire sleep in the stirless air ; these were sights and feelings which softened and exalted her thoughts ; she felt as if she were a part of the great whole; she felt bound in amity to all; doubly, immeasurably loving those dear to her, feeling an humanizing cha¬ rity even to the evil. A sweet scent coming from the lemon-flowers, which mingled with the gummy odour of the cypress trees, added io the enchantment. Suddenly,—list ! what is that ? Music was heard, and sweeter than all other instruments, the human voice in cho¬ rus singing a national song, half hymn, half warlike; Euthanasia wept; like a child she wept,—but there was none near to whom she couid tell the complicated sensations that over¬ powered her: to speak to those we love in Mich moments, exhilarates the spirits; else the deep feeling preys on the heart itself. She became sad, and looked up to the many-starred
sky ; her soul uttered silently the bitter com¬ plaint of its own misery. "Must I then forgetjaiovef 0h! sooner shan4liat-resllëss"ïamp, which walketh up the heavens, and then descendeth, and abideth no where, Oh ! sooner shall that forget its path which it hath ever traced, since God first marked it out, than I forget to love ! The air still surrounds the earth, filling the recesses of the mountains, and even penetrating into their caverns ; the sun shines through the day, and the cloudless heavens of night are starred with the air's fire-bearing children ; and am not I as unchanged and unchangeable as nature's own, everlasting works ? What is it Jţhen that startles every nerve, not as the sound of thun¬ der or of whirlwind, but as the still, small voice, that clings to me, and will not be made silent, telling me that all is changed from that which it once was ? 44 1 loved ! God and my own heart know how truly, how tenderly î How I dwelt on his idea, his image, his virtues, with unblamed af¬ fection : how it was my glory, my silent boast, when in solitude my eyes swam in tears, and
Ch. VII.] VALPEPvGA. 1б7 my cheek glowed, to reflect that I loved him, who transcended his kind in wisdom and ex¬ cellence ï Is this a dream ? Oh ! then all is a dream ; and the earth, and the fabric of the adamantine sky are as the gossamer that may not endure ! Yet, oh, ye stars, ye shine ! And I live. Pulse, and breath, and thought, and ail is changed ; I must no longer love,—so let me suffer the living death of forgetfulness. " Surely my heart is not cold, for I feel deep agony ; and yet I live. I have read of those who have pined and died, when the sweet food of love was denied to them ; were their sen¬ sations quicker, deeper, more all-penetrating than mine ? Their anguish greater ? I know not; nor do I know, if God hath given this frame a greater capacity for endurance than I could desire. Yet, methinks, I still love, and that is why I live. A dark, blank, rayless, motionless night is before me, a heavy, over¬ whelming annihilation is above me, when for a moment I imagine that hope is not for me. But for an instant does that idea live within me, yet does it come oftener and stay longer that it was wont. The knowledge that I have
nought to expect but death, must become a part of my mind. When a dear friend dies, what painful throes does one undergo, be¬ fore we are persuaded to know that he is no more ! So now that hope dies ; it is a lesson hard for my heart to learn ; but it will learn it; and that which is now reality, will be as a dream ; what is now a part of me will be but a recollection, a shadow thrown upon life, from which I at length shall emerge. And what is the state of being that shall follow ? 44 Yet will I arouse all the pride and all the nobility ot my nature ; I will not sink beneath this trial ; the great and good of past ages have left their lessons for me to meditate, and 1 will be no indocile pupil ; the honey of the cup is exhausted, but all is not gall that remains." The winter passed on thus : Euthanasia feared Castruccio as the enemy of Florence ; but she avoided Florence as hk enemy. Dis¬ appointed in her dearest hopes, her very heart destroyed, she hated society, and felt solace in the contemplation of nature alone ; that solace which the mind gathers, in communing with its borrows, and, having lost every uther rc
source, elings as to a friend, to the feelings of woe with which it is penetrated. The winter was chili ; the mountains were covered with snow ; yet, when the sun gleam¬ ed on them, the Serchio, taking life from his smiles, sped down in his course, roaring and howling, as if, pursued by innumerable and overflowing streams, he hurried tô find repose in his home among the waters of the bound¬ less 'ocean. The air was filled with his tur¬ moil ; and winter, asleep among the icy crags of the mountains, feared a sound, wdiich he had not power to silence, and w hich was the dirge that tolled out his passing hour : the cold north¬ ern wind swept along the plain of Lucca, and moaned as a repulsed beggar about the walls of Euthanasia's castle» Within tho<şe walls, late the scene of content and joy, sat the dis¬ consolate mistreţ, a prey to all those sad, and «tometimes wild reveries, vvhich utter hopeless¬ ness had made her companions. Duty, and the associations of her early youth, had breathed in her ear the terrible command to love rm more; but her soul rebelled, and often ?hc thought that, in so mad a world, duty was but VOL. II. I
a watch- word for fools, and that she might un¬ blamed taste of the only happiness she should ever enjoy. But, in one who had so long submitted her very thoughts to the conti ol of conscience, such ideas found brief habitation ; and her ac¬ customed feelings returned to press her into the nairow circle, whence for her all peace was excluded. Duty, patriotism, and high religious morality, were the watch-dogs which drove her scattered thoughts, like wandering sheep, into their fold : alas ! the wolf nestled in the pen itself. If for a moment her will paused, and love, breaking every bank she had carefully built up to regulate her mind's course, burst in at once, and carried away in its un- tameable course reason, conscience, and even memory, Castruccio himself came to repair the breach, and to restrain the current ; some castle burnt, some town taken by assault, some friend or enemy remorselessly banished, filled her vvith shame and anger, that she should love a tyiant ; a slave to his own passions, the aven¬ ger of those of others. Castruccio was ever at war ; peace subsisted between him and Via«
rence; but the siege of Genoa by the Ghibe¬ lines of Lombardy, gave him occasion to turn his arms on that side ; and, his march extending from Lucca to beyond the Magra, he deluged the country in blood, and obtained that which he desired, dominion and fame. It were curious to mark the changes that now operated in his character. Every success made him extend his views to something be¬ yond ; and every obstacle surmounted, made him still more impatient of those that presented themselves in succession, He became all in all to himself; his creed seemed to contain no ar¬ ticle but the end and aim of his ambition ; and that he swore before heaven to attain. Ac¬ customed to see men die in battle for his cause, he became callous to blood, and felt no more whether it flowed for his security on a scaffold, or in the field of honour ; and every new act of cruelty hardened his heart for those tocóme. And yet all good feelings were not dead within him. An increased ardour İn friendship seemed to have taken the place of innocence and general benevolence : virtue, as it were seeking to build hei uest in his heart, and 1 <l
thrust out of her ancient one, taking up with tlie resting-place whose entrance still was free. Bravery and fortitude were to him habitual feelings : but, although he were kind and boun¬ teous to his friends, so that he was loved with ardour, and served with fidelity, there was no magnanimity, and little generosity in his cha¬ racter. His moderate habits, abstemiousness, and contempt of luxury, often gave him the appearance of self-sacrifice ; for he bestowed on others what they greatly valued, but what he himself contemned. But, when it came to the sacrifice of his own inclinations, his bound¬ less ambition, and love of sway, then no ob¬ stacle either of nature or art could stop him ; neither compassion which makes angels of men, nor love which softens the hearts of the gods themselves, had over him the slightest power, —he fixed his whole soul on the point he would attain, and he never either lost sight of it, or paused in his efforts to arrive there. It were difficult to tell what his sensations were with regard to Euthanasia ; he had loved her, tenderly, passionately ; and he considered her refusal of his offers as a caprice to be sur-
mounted. Sometimes lie was deeply grieved, sometimes angry ; yet he ever loved her, and believed that she would relent. Sometimes he thought of poor Beatrice, her form, beaming with beauty, and alive with the spirit of the .sybil ; or again, pale, struck to the heart ae a poor deer in the forest, and sinking beneath the wound :—he then felt that lie would give the world to assuage her sorrows. On return¬ ing through Bologna, he had sent to Ferrara, and heard that she was alive, that no change in her situation had taken place ; and, satisfied with this, he sought no further. Ambition had become the ruling passion of his soul, and all bent beneath its sway, as a field of reeds before the wind : love himself had brief power in his mind; and, although this páston sometimes eaused him pain, and the sickness of disap¬ pointed hope, yet this was short, and yielded to the first impulse that occurred, which hurried him along to new designs and new conquests. Once indeed he had loved, and he had drank life and joy fiom the eyes of Euthanasia, His journey to Lombardy, his connexion with Beatrice, although indeed he loved her little,
yet was sufficient to weaken the bonds that confined him ; and love was with him, ever after, the second feeling in his heart, the servant and thrall of hí* ΐ*™ binon. His military exploits were now bounded to the entire reduction ofthe territory around Luc- , ca ; Sarzana, Pontremoli, Fucecchio, Fosede- novo,—castles even beyond the Magra, Val- dinera, Aquabuona, La Valle, fortified villages among the Apennines, wdiich had hitherto been under the jurisdiction of the lords of Lombardy, now submitted to the Lucchese consul. Du¬ ring the winter he was for sometime confined by the floods to the town of Lucca itself, where he employed himself in establishing a vigorous system of police, in discovering and punishing his enemies, and in the design and foundation of public edifices. He was beloved by the nobles of his own party, and by the common people, whose taxes he lightened, and vvhom he relieved in a great measure from the tyranny of their superiors; he was beloved even by the clergy, for, although an enemy to the temporal usurpations ofthe Popes, he valued the learn¬ ing, and respected the persons of the priests.
íle was hated by all the rich not immediately connected with his person and faction, for they were deprived of power ; despised by his fol¬ lowers, and watched by himself, they could find no asylutmfrom the suspicion and severi Jy of a t}-rant who felt himself insecure on his ¡seat of power.
CHAPTER VIÍL Beatrice disguised as a Pilgrìm, visus Fal¬ per ga. — Castruccio relates her Story* SPUING advanced, and the mountains looked forth from beneath the snow : the chesnuts began to assume their light and fanlike foliage ; the dark ilex and cork trees which crowned the hills, threw off their burthen of snow ; and the olives now in flower starred the mountain paths with their small fallen blossoras; the heath perfumed the air ; the melancholy voice of the cuckoo issued from the depths of the forests ; the swallows returned from their pil¬ grimage ; and in soft moonlight evenings the nightingales answered one another from the copses; the vines with freshcbt green hung over the springing corn ; and various flowers adorn¬ ed the banks oí' each running stream. Eutha¬ nasia beheld the advance of summer with care¬ less eyes : her heart was full of ope thought, of
one image ; and all she saw, whcUier it were tiie snow-clad mountains of winter, or tiie green and flowery fields of spring, was referred by her to one feeling, one only remembrance. She determined to think no more of Castruc¬ cio; but every day, every moment of everyday, was as a broken mirror, a multiplied reflection of his form alone. They had often met during the winter in die palaces ofthe Lucchese nobles, and sometíales at her own castte ; he was ever gentie and de¬ ferential to her, and sometimes endeavoured &> reue w the courtship tiiat had formerly subsist¬ ed between them. Eutiianasia had not strength of purpose sufficient to avoid these meetings; but each of them was as the fife-blood taken from her heart, and left her in a suite of de¬ spair and grief that preyed like fever upon her vitals. To see him, to hear him, and yet not to be his, was as if to make lier food of poison ; it might assuage the pangs of hunger, but it destroyed the principle of life, She became pale, sleepless, the shadow of what she liad been ; her friends perceived the change, and knew the cause ; and they endeavoured to per- I J
suado her to go to Florence, or to take some journey, which might occupy her mind, and break the chain that now bound her to sor¬ row. She felt that she ought to comply witii their suggestions ; but even her spirit, strong and self-sustaining as it had been, sank be¬ neath the influence of love, and she had no power to fly, though to remain were death. Tears and grief were her daily portion ; yet she took it patiently, as that to which she was doomed, and hardly prayed to have the bitter cup removed. - A circumstance that occurred just at this crisis, when she seemed to stand on the sharp edge which divides life from death, saved her from destruction, and led her back to taste for a few more years the food of sorrow and dis¬ appointment which was doled out to her. The summer solstice had passed, and Cas¬ truccio had been absent during several months, carrying his conquests along the shore beyond the Magra, while every day brought the news of some fresh success he had obtained. This was the season of pilgrimages to Monte San Pelegrino, a wild and high A pennine in the
neighbourhood of Valperga. It is said, that a king of Scotland, resigning his crown to his son, and exiling himself from his country, fi¬ nished his days in penitence and prayer on this mountain. In Italy every unknown pil¬ grim was a king or prince : but this was a strange tradition ; and it would seem as if the royal penitent, disdaining the gladsome plains of Italy, sought for the image of his native country on this naked peak among tlie heaped masses ofthe Apennines. His memory was there canonized, and many indulgences were the reward of three succes¬ sive visits to his rocky tomb; every year num¬ berless pilgrims flocked, and still continue to flock thither. Straining up the rugged paths of the mountain, careless of the burning eun, they walk on, shadowed by their broad pil¬ grim's hats, repeating their pater-noüerS) and thus, by the toil of the body, buy indulgence for the soul's idleness. Many on their return visited the castle of Valperga, and partook its hospitality. One party had just withdrawn, as the Ave Maria sounded from the vale below ; and they chauntcd the evening hymn, as they
wound down tiie steep. Euthanasia listened from her tower, and heard the last song of the sleepy cicala among the olive woods, and the buz of the numerous night insects, that tilled the air with tlieir Might but continual uoise. It was tiie evening of a burning day ;jMtd si fe' breeze that slightly waved tiie grass, and bend¬ ed the ripe corn with its quick steps, was as a i^ireshing bath to the animals who panted under the stagnant air of the day. Amid the buzzing of the crickets and dragon flies, tlie agfofo's monotonous and regular cry told of clear skies and sunny weather; the flowers were bending beneath the dew, and her acacia, now in bloom, crowning its fan-like foüage with a roseate crest, sent forth a sweet scent. A few of tiie latest fire-flies daTted here and there, with bright green light ; but it was July, and their season was well nigh past. Towards the sea, ou the horizon, a faint lightning shew¬ ed the over-heated state of the atmosphere, arid kUled by its brightness the last glories of the orange sunset ; tiie mountains were losing their various tints in darkness; and their vast amphitheatre looked like a ponderous unform-
ed wall, closing in Lucca, whose lights glim¬ mered aiàrofl* Euthanasia was awaked from the reverie^ half painful, half pleasing, that engaged her aa she sat at her window ; £or she was too true a child of nature, not to feel her sorrows allevi¬ ated by the sight of what is beautiful in the vi¬ sible world;—she was roused, I say» by her servant who told her that a female pilgrim was at the gate, and desired to see the lady of the castle. *' Receive her,"said Euthanasia» " and let lier be led to the bath, I will see lier when she is refreshed." " She will not enter," replied the servant, "but desires carnesüy, slie says, to see you : she absolutely refuses to enter the castle." Euthanasia descended to the gate; her quick light steps trod the pavement of the hall, her long golden tresses waved upon die wind, and her blue eyes seemed to have drunk in the azure of departed day, they were ia colour so deep, so clear. The pilgrim stood at the door leaning on her staflj a large hat covered her liead, and was pulled down over her brows, and her coarse cloak fell in undistinguishing
folds round her slim form ; but Euthanasia, accustomed to see the peasantry alone resort to this mountain, was struck by the small white hand that held the staff) and the delicate¬ ly moulded and snowy feet which, shod in the rudest sandals, seemed little used to labour or fatigue. " I intreat you," she said, 4< to ccme into the castle to rest yourself; the Ave Maria is passed, and your toils for the day are ended ; you will find a bath, food and rest ; will you not enter ? " Euthanasia held forth her hand. " Lady, I must not, I intreat you only to bestow your alms on a pilgrim going to Rome, but who has turned aside to perform a vow among these mountains." " Most willingly ; but I also have made a vow, which is, not to suffer a tired pilgrim to* pass my gates without rest and food. Where can you go to-night ? Lucca is six long miles off; you are weak and very weary : come ; I ask you for alms ; they are your prayers which must be told on the soft cushions of a pleasant bed amid your dreams this night. Cornein; the heavy dews that fall from the clear sky
after this burning day may hurt you ; thts is a dangerous hour in the plain ; can you not be persuaded f " Euthanasia saw quick drops. fall from the flashing and black eyes of the poor pilgrim : she raised them to heaven, saying, " Thy will be done ! I am now all humbleness." As she threw up her head Euthanasia look¬ ed on her countenance; it was beautiful, but sunburnt and wild ; her finely carved eyes, her lips curved in the line of beauty, her pointed and dimpled chin still beamed loveliness, and her voice was low and silver-toned. She en¬ tered the castle, but would go no further than the outer hall. The eloquence of Euthanasia was wasted ; and she wa3 obliged to order cushions and food to be brought to the hall : they then sat down ; the pilgrim took off her hat, and her black and silken ringlets fell around her face; she parted them with her small fingers, and then sat downcast and silent. Euthanasia placed fruit, sweetmeats and wine before her ; " Eat," she said, " you are greatly fatigued." The poor pilgrim tried ; but her hps refused
(he fitti* she would have tasted· She folt that she should weep ; and, angry at her own weak¬ ness, she drank a little wine, which somewhat revived her; and then,sitting thus, overcome, b«*t and sorrowing, beside the dear loveliness of Euthanasia, these two ladies entered into conversation, soft and consoling on one part, on the odber 'hesitating and interrupted. At Erst the pilgrim gazed for a moment on the golden hair and bluest eyes of Euthanasia, her heavenly smile, ond clear brow ; and then she said : ** You are the lady of this castie ? You are named Euthanasia ? " * Most true : and might I in return ask you who you are, \vdio w^*ader;alone and unhappy ì Believe me I should thmk myself very fortunate, if you would permit me to know your grief, and to undertake the .task of consouag you. If you moum for your faults, does not a moment of real repentance annihilate them all ì Come, I will be your confessor ; and impose on you the light penances of cheerfulness and hope· Do уш mourn your friends I poor girl! weep not; that is a sorrow time alone can cure ; but time can cure it, if with a patient heart you yield

You are silent; you are angry tiiat I speak ; so truly do I prize the soft peace thai was for years tiie inmate of, my own heart, that I would bestow it on others with as earnest a labour, as for .myself I would try lo recai it to the nest from which it has fled." "How ! and are you not happy ì " Theeyea ofthe pilgrim glanced a sudden fire, that was again quenched by her downcast lids. 44 1 have had my share of tranquillity. For fi ve-and-twenty years few sorrows, and those appeaseabk? by naturaland quickly dried tears, visited me ; «ow лгу cares rise thick, whîkţ, trust ше, with eager endeavour, I try to dissi¬ pate thena. But you are young, very young; you have quaffed the gall, and will now come to the honey of your cup. Wherefore are you bound for Rome ľ " 44 it were a long tale to teM, lady*, and one I would not willingly disclose. Yet» шечЫаЦ, you should be happy ; your eyes me utild, and
made for peace. I thought,—I heard,— 4hat a thousand blessed circumstances conduced to render you fortunate beyond all others/' " Circumstances change as fast as the fleet¬ ing clouds of an autumnal sky* If happiness depends upon occasion, how unstable is it ! We can alone call that ours which lives in our own bosoms. Yet those feelings *dso are bound to mutability ; and, as the priests have doubt¬ less long since taught you, there is no joy that endures upon earth." 44 How is this ! He is not dead ! "—he must be^ -----" The pilgrim suddenly stopped, her dieek burning with blushes. 44 Who dead I What do you mean ì " *' Your father, your brother, any one you love. Bu t, lady, I will intrude no longer ; lhe dews are fallen, and i find the air of the castie close and suffocating. I long for the free air." " You will not sleep here ? " 44 1 must not; do not ask me again; you pain me much ; I must pursue my journey 1 " The pilgrim gathered up her raven locks, and put on her hat ; then, leaning on her staff, she held forth her little hand, and said in a smo-
thered voice, so low that the tone hardly struck the air, " Your alms, lady." Euthanasia took out gold ; the pilgrim smiled sadly, saying, u My vow prevents my receiving more than three soldi ; lettiiat sum be tlie limit of your generous aid." Euthanasia found something so inexplicable, reserved, and almost haughty, in the manner of her guest, that she felt checked, and ill disposed to presoj her often rejected services ; she gave the small sum asked, saying, ·' You are penu¬ rious in your courtesies ; this will hardly buy for me one pater-no&ter." 44 It will buy the treasure of my heart in prayers for your welfare ; prayers, which I once thought all powerful, may be as well worth per¬ haps as those of the beggar whom we fee on the road-side. Farewel 1 " The pilgrim spoke earnestly and sweetly; and then drawing her cloak about her, she left the castle, winding slowly down the steep, After she had awhile departed, Euthanasia sent a servant to the nunnery of St. Ursula, which was on the road die pilgrim was to follow, with a loaded basket of fruits, wine and other f*od,
ша a message to the тзт to watch for and receive the unhappy stranger. All passed as she desired. The pilgrim entered the convent ; and, after praying in the chapel, and silently partaking a frugal meal of fruit and bread, she went to rest in her lowly cell. The next morn¬ ing the abbess had intended to question her, end to win her to some comfort ; but, befőne the dawn of day, tiie pilgrim had left the con¬ vent ; and, with slow steps and a sorrowing heart, pursued her way towards Rome. This occurrence had greatly struck Eutha¬ nasia. She felt, that there was something un¬ common in the visit of tiie stranger, «md that, altiiough unknown to her, there must be some liak between tiiem, which she vainly strove to discover. It happened, that, about a fortnight after, she was at the Fondi palace in Lucca, where Castruccio was in company ; and she arelated this incident, dwelhng on the beauty of $he pilgrim, her graceful maimers, and deep «arrow. When she described her form and countenance, Castruccio, struck by some sud¬ den recollection, advanced towards Eudiamsia, end began to -question her earnestly as to tlie
very words« and looks of Űm stranger ; then* checking himself, he dœw back, aad entered into conversation with another person. When however Euthanasia rose to departs he ap¬ proached, and said in a low tone : "I am afraid that I can solve the riddle of this unfor¬ tunate girl ; permit me to see you alone tomor¬ row ; I must know every thing tliat passed/' Euthanasia assented, and waited with impa¬ tience for tlie visit. He came; and at his request she related minutely all that had happened. Castruccio listened earnestly; and, wheu he heard what had been her last words, he cried, " It must be she ! It is the poor Beatrice í " u Beatrice!—Who is Beatrice?" Castruccio endeavoured to evade the ques¬ tion, and afterwards to answer it by the rela¬ tion of a few slight circumstances ; but Eutha¬ nasia, struck by liis manner, questioned him so seriously, that he ended by relating the whole story. Euthanasia was deeply moved ; and ear¬ nest pity succeeded to her first astonishment; astonishment for her powers and strange er¬ rors, and then compassion for her sorrows and
mighty fall. Castruccio, led on by the me¬ mory of her enchantments, spoke with ardour, scarcely knowing to^Khom he spoke; and,when he ended, Euthanasia cried, " She must be fol¬ lowed, brought back, consoled ; her misery is great ; but there is a cure for it/' She then concerted with Castruccio the plan for tracing her steps, and inducing her to re¬ turn. Messengers were sent on the road to Rome, who werfe promised high rewaids if they succeeded in finding her; others were sent to Ferrara to learn if her friends there had any к no wledge of her cou rse. T hese researches occupied several weeks; but they were fruit¬ less: the messengers from Ferrara brought word, that she had left that city early in the preceding spring in a pilgrimage to Rome, and that she had never since been heard of. The lady Marchesana, inconsolable for her depar¬ ture, had since died ; and the good bishop Mar¬ silio, who had not returned from France, where he had been made a cardinal, was at too great a distance to understand the circumstances of her departure, or to act upon them. Nor were the tidings brought from Home mon; sntisfac-
tory; she was traced from Lucca to Pisa, Florence, Arezzo, Perugia, Foligno, Spoletto, and even to Terni ; but there all trace was lost. It appeared certain that she had never arrived in Rome ; none of the priests had heard of her ; every church and convent wab examined ; but no trace of her could be found. Every exertion was vain : it appeared as if she had sunk into the bowels of the earth. During the period occupied by these re¬ searches, a great change had taken place in the mind of Euthanasia. Before, though her atmosphere had been torn by storms, and blackened by the heaviest clouds, her love had ever borne her on towards one point with re¬ sistless force ; and it seemed as if, body and soul, she would in the end be its victim. Now the tide ebbed, and left her, as a poor wretch upon one point of rock, when the rising ocean suddenly subsides, and restores him unexpect¬ edly to life. She had loved Castruccio ; and, as is ever the case with pure and exalted mindt, she had separated the object ot her love ii ^ιλ all oiher beings, and, investing hi in with a gloiy, he was uo longer to her as one a.r^Mg
the common herd, nor ever rør a moment could she confound him and class him with his fellow men. It is this feeling that is the essence and life of love, and that, still subsisting even after esteem and sympathy had been destroyed, had caused the excessive grief in which she had been plunged. She had separated herself from the rest as his chosen one ; she had been se¬ lected from the whole world for him to love, and therefore was there a mighty barrier be¬ tween her and all things else; no sentiment could pass through her mind unmingled with his image, no thought that did not bear his stamp to distinguish it from all other thoughts ; as the moon in heaven shines bright, because the sun illumines her with his rays, so did she proceed on her high path in serene majesty, protected through her love for hua from all meaner cares or joys ; her very person was sacred, since she had dedicated herself to him ; but, the god undeified, the honours of the priestess fell to the dust. The story of Bea¬ trice dissolved the charm ; she looked on him now in the common light of day ; the illusion and exaltation of love was dispelled for ever :
and, although disappointment, and the bitter¬ ness of destroyed hope, robbed her of even sensation of enjoyment, it was no longer that mad despair, that clinging to the very swoid that cut her, which before had tainted her cheek with the hues of death. Her old feel¬ ings of duty, benevolence, and friendship re¬ turned ; all was not now, as before, referred to love alone ; the trees, the streams, the moun¬ tains, and the stars, no longer told one never- varying tale of disappointed passion: befoie, they had oppresbcd her heart by reminding her, thiough every change and every form, of what she had once seen in joy ; and they lay as so heavy and sad a burthen on her soul, that she would exclaim as a modern poet has sincedone : Thou, thrush, that singest loud, and loud, and free, Into yon row of willows flit, Upon that alder sit, Or sing another song, or ihoobc another tree! Koll back, sweet nil, back to tli^v mountain bounds \nd (here for ever bc thy waters uumcü ! ľor thou dost haunt the air with rounds Thit cannot he sustained. * * Л J/t He any thing, sweet nil, but that which thou art now VOL.11. К
But now these feverbh emotions ceased. Sor¬ row sat on her downcast eye, restrained her light step, and slept in the unmoved dimples of her fair cheek ; but the wildness of grief had died, the fountain of selfish tears flowed no more, and she was restored from death to life. Bhe considered Castruccio as bound to Bea¬ trice ; bound by the deep love and anguish of the fallen prophetess, by all her virtues, even bv her faults ; bound by his falsehood to her who was then his betrothed, and whom he carelessly wronged, and thus proved how little capable he was of participating in her own exalted feelings. She believed that he would be far happier in the passionate and unques¬ tioning love of this enthusiast, than with her, who had lived too long to be satisfied alone vvith the affection of him she loved, but re¬ quired in him a conformity of tastes to those she liad herself cultivated, which in Castruccio was entirely wanting. She felt half glad, half чоггу, for the change she was awaic had been ope¬ rated in her heart; for the misery that she be¬ fore endured was not without its momentan inte)vals, which bu«y love filled with dier.m*
and hopes, that caused a wild transport, which, although it destroyed her, was still joy, still delight. But now there was no change ; one 4 steady hopeless blank was before her; the veiy energies of her mind were palsied ; her imad- nation furled its wing 1 *, and the owlet, reason, was the only dweller that found sustenance and a being in her benighted soul.

CHAPTER IX. Corruccio plots tlie Assassination of JRobeit King of Naples- — Made Prince of Lucca. — Declares War against Florence. — F hi for a Revolution in Lucca defeated» — La^ truci io summons Falperga· The ambitious designs of Castruccio wen each day ripening. The whole Ghibelin U "ce in Italy was now turned to the siege о f «enoa, which was defended by Robert, kin, ci Naples at the head ofthe Guelphs. Ca- t uccio had never actually joined the besiegm. a'piv. But he had taken advantage of ti. v*,!, which prevented the Genoese from di- o\ding their castles on the sea-coast, tosui- j , Se many of them, and to spread his ил quests far be) ond the Lucchese tctutoiv. ; nn ι e was ever attentive to the ^lightest incidí ι t¡ nt mi sth t contribute to tlie exaltation of ι
Ghibelines. He aided his Lombard frieiub, by annoying the enemy as much as was in hi.-> power, and did not hesitate in using the mo?t nefarious arts to injure and destroy them. He now fully subscribed to all the articles of Pepi \s political creed, and thought fraud and secret murder fair play, when it thinned the ranks ot the enemy. Robert, king of Naples, was at the head oi the Guelph army at Genoa. The siege ЬаЛ now lasted with various fortune for two yeai s ; and every summer the king visited this city to conduct the enterprizes of the campaign. Cas¬ truccio, urged by Galeazzo Visconti, and tiv his own belief in the expediency ofthe scheme, conspired to destroy the king : a foolish plan m many ways ; for a legitimate king, like a vine, never dies; and when you throw eartu over the old root, a new sprout ever springs up from the parent stock. The king of Naples had fitted out a fleet to go and attack the king of Sicily, who was a protector of the Ghibelines» Castruccio sent two desperate, but faithful fellows, to set tiie to the ship in which the king himsilf sailed.
The men got admittance on board the royal galley, which, swifter than the rest, sped on through the waves, while the rest of the fleet hung like a cloud on the far horizon. At night the smell of fire was perceived in the vessel, and a small flame issued from one of the win¬ dows: the affright and confusion were terrible, when they found that they were burning thus on the desert sea, w hile the other vessels were too distant to afford them aid. All hands were at work to extinguish the flames ; and it was then that the hired incendiaries were perceived, as they tried to fire another part of the ship. It was found that they were provided with floats of cork, by which they hoped to preserve themselves in the water, until by some acci¬ dent they might be rescued. The fire was seen by the galley, in which the eldest son of king Robert was embarked, and which bore down to his relief. The youth¬ ful prince, in an agony of terror, lent his own hand to the oar that they might arrive more speedily. The whole crew was saved; and the criminals were reserved for torture and death.
The news of this detestable plot was spread through all Italy, nor was it much blamed. Jt was then that Euthanasia, the living spirit of goodness and honour, amidst the anguish that the unworthiness of Castruccio occasioned her, felt a just triumph, that she had overcome her inclmations, and was not the bride of a suborner and a murderer. Even now, remem¬ bering that it was known that she once loved Antelminelii, she was penetrated witli shame, and her cheeks burned with blushes when she heard the tale. But, careless of an infamy which he shared vvith many of his countrymen, and sorry only that his design had not succeed¬ ed, Castruccio did not attempt to conceal the part he had taken in the plot, and loudly de¬ clared that all his enemies might expect the same measure as king Robert, while in return he permitted them to try the like arts against him. In the mean time he prosecuted the war vvith redoubled vigour. In the winter of the year 1320, the Ghibelines reinforced their armies before Genoa, and called upon their allies for their utmost assistance ; and Cas-
truccio among the rest was to advance to their aid with all his forces. But the Guelphs were not İdle: ïloience had sent soldiers every cam¬ paign to reinforce the Genoese, and entered wdth spirit into all the enterprizes undertaken against the imperial party ; although a wish to preserve their territory free from the horrors of war, and to repair by a long peace the injury done to their vines and olive woods, had caused them to preserve a shew of peace with Lucca. Castruccio considered all his present suc¬ cesses as preliminaries only to his grand un¬ dertaking; and, having now reduced not only the territory of Lucca, but many castles and strong holds, which before had either been in¬ dependent, or had paid tribute to Genoa, or to the lords of Lombardy, he planned a more vigurous system of warfare for the ensuing campaign. His first step w T as to increase his security and power in Lucca itself. Having grown proud upon his recent suc¬ cesses-, he began to disdain the name of consul, which he had hitherto borne. Ile assembled the senate ; and, at the instance of his friend«, who had been tutored for the purpose, this
assembly bestowed upon him the government of Lucca for life, with the title of prince. He afterwards caused this grant to be confirmed by ш assembly ofthe people; hib warlike atchievements, joined to the moderate expendi¬ ture of his government, had made him a gieat lav omite with the inferior classes of the com¬ munity, and they cordially enteied into the piojects of his ambition. Soon after, thiough the mediation of hit> fnend Galeazzo V isconti, he obtained fiom Frederic, king of the Ro¬ mans, the dignity of Imperial Vicar in Тиэ- ciny. All this passed during the wintei ; and m the spring he assembled hb tioops, intent upon some new design. He had now been at peacv. with Floience for the space of tin ее yeai s, al¬ though, fighting under opposite bannets, th« spini of enmity had always subsisted between hmi and them. Now, without declaring \\'^ 7 οι in any way advising them of their pen!, he Hidden ly made an incursion into their tenitoi ν , burning and wasting their land as far as Em¬ poli, taking several castles, and carrying off an К Õ
immense booty; lie then retreated back to Lucca. This violation of every law of nations filled the Florentines at first with affright, and after¬ wards with indignation. They had sent their best troops to Genoa ; and they found them¬ selves attacked without warning or time for preparation. When the Lucchese retreated, anger and complaint succeeded. Castruccio replied to the reproaches of the Florentines by a declaration of war, and then immediately marched with his forces to join the besieging army before Genoa, When the Florentines found that they could obtain no redress, they turned their thoughts to revenge. They raised what fresh troops they could among the citizens ; and wishing to as¬ sist their small army by other measures which were then rife in the Italian system of warfare, they endeavoured to foment a conspiracy among the Lucchese for the overthrow of their prince'*« government. Castruccio received in one day letters from Giovanni da Castiglione, the ge¬ neral who commanded the few troops which
he had left to guard his own principality, to inform him, that the Florentines had entered the Valdi Nievole, burning and spoiling every thing before them ; and from Vanni Morde¬ castelli, his civil lieutenant at Lucca, with in¬ formation of a plot for the destruction of his power which was brewing in that city. Cas¬ truccio immediately left the Lombard army, and returned with his troops to disconcert these designs. Of the castles which were situated within a circuit of many mites round Lucca, all were subject to Castruccio, except the castle of Valperga and its dependencies. He had often solicited Euthanasia to place her lordship un¬ der the protection of his government ; and she had uniformly refused. The castle of Valperga was situated on a rock, among the mountains that bound the pass through which the Ser- chio flows, and commanded the northera en¬ trance to the Lucchese territory. It was a place of great strength, and in the hands of an enemy might afford an easy entrance for an hostile army into the plain of Lucca itself. The Florentines, trusting to the afTcction which
the countess bore their city, sent ambassadors to her to intreat her to engage in an alliance with them against Castruccio, and to admit a party of Florentine soldiers into her castle ; but she rejected their proposals, and positively refused to enter into any league injurious to the exist¬ ing government of Lucca. The ambassadors had been selected from among her intimate friends ; and her Monualdo, Bondelmonti, was at the head of them : they were not therefore intimidated by one repulse, but reiterated their arguments, founded upon her own interest, and tlie service she would render to her native town, in vain. She felt that the liberty in vvhich ¡die had been permitted to remain, while, one after another, ail the castles around her had been reduced, could only have arisen from the friendship and forbearance of the prince ; antl she judged that it would be a sort of treason in her, to take advantage of his moderation to in¬ troduce devastation into his country; at the fcame time she promised, that no threats or in- treaties should induce her to ally herself with, or submit to, the enemy of Florence. The ambassadors, who had been bred iii
the Italian school of politics of that age, little understood, and by no means approved her scruples ; they found her however invincible to their arguments, and were obliged to give up all expectation of her assistance. But they made the hope of overcoming her objections the pretext for their protracted stay in her cas¬ tle; for they had other designs in view. The vicinity of Valperga to Lucca, and the inter¬ course which took place between it and that town, ga\c them an opportunity of becoming acquainted vvith several of the discontented no¬ bles, the remnants of the faction of the Neri, who had been permitted to remain. Eutha- nasia, being a Guelph, had of course much in¬ tercourse vvith the few ofthat party who were to be found in Lucca; and from the conversa¬ tion of these men the Florentine ambassadors conceived the hope of weaving some plot vvhich would produce the downfal of Casti uc¬ cio. And they believed, that in one of them they had found a successor to his dignity, and a chief who would prove as faithful to the papal party, as Castruccio had been to the imperial. Among those of the faction of the Neri who
had remained in Lucca, was a branch of the family of Guinigi, and one of the youths of this house had married Lauretta dei Adimari^ a cousin of Euthanasia. This connexion had caused great intimacy between the families; and Leodino de' Guinigi, the husband of Lau¬ retta, was a young man of talent, spirit and ambition. Being refused a command in the army of Castruccio, he was however forced to expend his love of action and his desire of di¬ stinction, in hunting, hawking and tournaments. He was a man of large fortune, and greatly re¬ spected and loved in Lucca ; for his manners were courteous, and his disposition generous, so that every one blamed the prince for neg¬ lecting a person of so much merit on account of his party. Every year however added to the discontent of Leodino ; and he used fre¬ quently at the castle of his cousin Euthanasia, to bemoan his fate, and declare how he longed for a change which should draw him from idle¬ ness and obscurity. Lauretta was a beauti¬ ful and amiable girl ; but party feelings ran so high in Lucca, that she was shunned as a Guelph and a Florentine, and therefore she
also entered eagerly into the complaints of her husband ; v\hile the fear of the confiscation of his nrooertv withheld Leodino from serving under some leader of his own party. Eutha¬ nasia esteemed him highly ; his mind was greatly cultivated ; and the similarity of their tastes and pursuits had given rise to a sincere affection and sympathy between them. The Florentine ambassadors saw Leodino and hie wife at the castle of Valperga ; they easily pe¬ netrated his character and wishes ; and Bon¬ delmonti undertook to work on him to co-ope¬ rate with them in their design. Leodino re¬ quired httle instigation, and immediately set to work in Lucca to gain parlizans : every thing promised well. All this had .been care¬ fully concealed from Euthanasia ; who was too sincere of disposition to suspect fraud in others. But their plot was now ripe; and the ambas¬ sador were on the eve of returning to Florence to lead their troops to the attack ; when the conspiracy was betrayed to Mordecastelli, and Castruccio suddenly appeared in Lucca. Bondelmonti and his associates instantlv quitted Valperga; and several of the conspira-
tors, struck with affright, fled from Lucca; but Leodino, ( trusting to the secrecy with which he had enveloped his name, resolved to brave all danger and to remain. This impru¬ dence caused his destruction ; and, the morn¬ ing after the return of Castruccio, he and six more of his intimate associates were arrested, and thrown into prison. Lauretta fled in do¬ spair to the castle of Valperga ; she threw her¬ self into the arms of Euthanasia, confessed the plot that had been carried on with Bondel¬ monti, and intreated her intercession with the prince to save the life of Leodino. Euthana¬ sia felt her indignation rise, on discovering that her hospitality had been abused, and her friend¬ ship employed as the pretence vvhich veiled a conspiracy. But, when the weeping Lauretta urged the danger of Leodino, all her anger was changed into compassion and anxiety ; and she ordered the horses to be brought to the gate, tiiat she might hasten to Lucca. " I am afraid, my poor cousin," said she, " if the prince be not of himself inclined to mercy, that my in- treaties will have little effect : but be assured that I will spare no prayers to gain the life of
Leodino. His life ! indeed that is far too pre cious to be lightly sacrificed ; í feel a confidence within me, which assurée me that he will be saved ; fear nothing, therefore ; I will bring him back with me when I return." She had covered her head with her veil, and folded her capuchin round her ; when an at¬ tendant announced the arrival of Castruccio himself at the castie. This unexpected news made her turn pale ; and again the blood, flow¬ ing from her heart, dyed her cheeks and even her fingers vvith pink ; she hardly knew what caused her agitation ; but she trembled, her eyes filled vvith tears, her voice faul tered ;—- Castruccio entered. He was no longer her lover, scarcely her friend ; no joy sparkled iii the eyes .of either at this meeting after a separation of months ; she had loved him passionately, and still dwelt with tenderness on the memory of what he had been ; but she saw no likeness between the friend of her youth, beaming with love, joy and hope, and the prince who now stood be¬ fore her ; his brow was bent, his curved lips expressed disdain, hib attitude and gesture were
haughty and almost repulsive. Euthanasia was not to be daunted by this shew of superi¬ ority ; she instantly recovered her presence of mind, and advanced towards him with calm dignity, saying, " My lord, I was about bo visit you, when I find that you prevent me by honouring my castle with your presence; I was coming as a suppliant for the life of a dear friend." " Countess, perhaps my errand is of more serious import,—at least to yourself: and, since it may include an answer to your suppli¬ cation, I in treat you to hear me before we enter on any other subject." Euthanasia bowed assent, and Castruccio continued, " Madonna, you may remember that I have often in friendly terms intreated you to place yourself under the protection of my govern¬ ment at Lucca ; you have ever refused me, and I indulgently acceded to your refusal. I have subdued all the castles around, several stronger than this, but I have left you to enjoy the independence you prized. I did this, trusting to your promise, that, although you
were not my ally, you would not become my enemy, and that, in whatever war I might en* gage myself, you would preserve a strict neu¬ tralità. On my return from Genoa, forced to this aasty measure by the intimation of a plot being formed against me, I find that you are at the head of my enemies, and that, in violation of your faith, if you have not declared war, you have acted a more injurious part, in fomenting a conspiracy, and giving traitors those oppor¬ tunities for maturing their plans, which, unless you- had done this, they could never have dreamed of." Euthanasia replied earnestly; "My lord, your mistake would be pardonable, had y©u not known me long enough to be assured that I am incapable of acting the part you attribute to me. But, although you have forgotten that treason and artifice are as foreign to my na¬ ture as darkness to that of the sun, you will at least believe me, when I give you my solemn assurance, that until this morning 1 knew no¬ thing of the conspiracy entered into against you. And now"------■ " But how can this be ? Did not Bondei-
monti and his associates reside in this castie for two months ? " 44 They did ; they came to urge me to enter into the Florentine war against you, which I iciubea, íŕ And was it necessary to hesitate during two months for your answer ? or, did it not rather enter into your plans, that they should remain as spies and plotters for my destruc¬ tion ľ but enough of this"-----■ 44 Enough, and far too much, my lord. Y^ou doubt my faith, and disbelieve my word : these are outrages which I did not expect to receive from you, but to which I must submit. And now permit me to speak to you on the subject of my intended visit." 44 Pardon me, but you may remember that we agreed I should be the first heard ; and I have not yet mentioned why I intrude myself iuto your castle. I am at war with Florence ; you are not ; and you believe yourself permit¬ ted, not only to hold correspondence with my enemies, but also to afford them an opportu¬ nity through your means to carry on plots vvith my traitorous subjects. This may have been
done very innocently on your part ; but I can¬ not permit a repetition of the same mime, or of any other, which, though differing in words, shall be the same in snirit. If vou have not taken advantage of my forbearance, you have at least shewn yourself incapable of sustaining the trust I reposed in you. But, Euthanasia, if you are indeed innocent, 1 am unmannerly in being thus stern with you ; and, since you deny that you entered into this plot, and İ would fain believe you, it is with repugnance that I enter upon the subject of ray visit. You must surrender your castle to me ; prudence no longer permits me to suffer you to enjey independence ; and, however painful the al¬ ternative, you must submit to become my ally." ' : 44 it were of little moment to enter into к treaty vvith me," said Euthanasia, vvith a .bit¬ ter smile : " since, if J am capable of treason, 1 may be more dangerous as an ally than an enemy." " Not so ; for the first article of our alliance must he the razing of this castle ; in exchange vou shall have a site afforded you in the plam
for the erection of a palace, nor shall you in¬ cur any loss in fortune or revenue ; but you must descend to the rank of a private indivi¬ dual, and this castle, and your power in this oountry, must be resigned into my hands." "My lord, I am afraid that we shall not agree on the first article of our intended treaty. I will persevere in the neutrality I promised, and endeavour to be more prudent than I was in tiiis last unfortunate affair. But I cannot surrender my castle, or permit the seat of my ancestors to be razed to the ground. And now allow me to speak of what is nearer to my heart. Leodino de' Guinigi has conspired against you, you have discovered his plot, and hav* thrown him into prison. I know that you consider his life a forfeit to your laws ; but I intreat you to spare him : if neither the generosity of your character, nor the impo¬ tence of your enemy will incline you to mercy, I intreat you by our antient friendship. His wife, Lauretta dei Adimari, is my cousin, and my friend ; Leodino, although your enemy, is a man distinguished by every virtue, brave, generous and wise. If you would obtain a
faitliful and trust-worthy friend, pardon him, confide in him ; and his gratitude will be to you as a guard an hundred strong : if you have not sufficient magnanimity to trust your enemyi banish him; but for my sake spare his life/* Castruccio appeared somewhat moved by her earnestness, but he replied;—"It cannot be ; I am sorry to refuse you, but the exam¬ ple would be too dangerous. Put aside this from your thoughts, and let me intreat you to consider what I have just said. You answer me slightly; but be assured that I have not mentioned this alternative of war or peace be¬ tween us, until my purpose was fixed : reflect seriously on the evils that resistance may bring upon you, and send me your answer tomor¬ row." " Tomorrow, or today, it is the same. But you, Castruccio, reflect upon the misery you cause, if you refuse to spare my unfortunate friend." " Do not torment yourself or me any more on the subject of Leodino; your intercession is fruitless; he is already dead; I gave orders for his immediate execution before I left Lucca.
—But why are you so pale?-*-What agitates you?" Euthanasia couklnot speak ; die hoiror that she felt on hearing the violent death of one she loved announced so coldly by his murderer, overcame her : she straggled vio'entiy not to faint ; but, when Castruccio drew near to sup¬ port her, he found her hand cold and lifeless ; and her trembling limbs alone shewed that she still felt: her lips were pale; she stood as if changed to stone :—· 44 Eutiianasia, speak I " 44 Speak ! What should I say ? Leave me ! You touch me, and your hands are covered 4^ith blood, your garments are dripping with gore; come not near me!—Oh! God, have pity on me, tiiat I should know this misery ! Leave me ; you are not a man ; your heart is stone ; your very features betray the icy blood which fills your veins. Oh, Leodino ! " And then she wept, and her features relaxed from the rigid horror they had expressed into softness and grief» After she had wept awhile, and thus calmed her agitation, she said : " M> lord, this is the last time that we shall evei
meet. You may attack my castle, if you will ; you may tear it down, and leave not a stone tö shew where it stood ; but I will never volun¬ tarily submit to a tyrant and a murderer. My answer is brief ;— Do your worst : it cannot be so bad as that which you have already done ! You have destroyed every hope of my life; you have done worse, far worse, than my words can express ; do not exasperate me, or let me exasperate you, by a longer stay : £ can never forgive the death of Leodino ; fare¬ wel !—we are enemies ; do your worst against me." She left him, unable to retain any longer even the patience to behold him. But she had no leisure afforded her to indulge her grief or indignation. Lauretta had heard of the death of her husband ; and her despair, and the con¬ vulsions it occasioned, entirely engrossed Eu¬ thanasia's attention, so that she forgot her own feelings and situation ; nor did she recur to the threats of Castruccio, until they were recalled to her recollection by other proceedings on bis . part. ι He did not* doubt in his own mind, that, VOL. II. L
whsn pushed to extremity, the countess would surrender lier castle» When he first heard that it had been selected by the conspirators as their rendezvous, he believed that she had had a principal share in the plot; but now, when assured of her innocence (for it was impossible not tx> believ·© her words, so clearly were truth and courageous sincerity painted on her noble countenance^ he did not for that relent in his purpose of depriving her of the independence that she possessed, in the midst of a territory subject to himself. Like many of his prede¬ cessors and successors in usui pation, Castruc¬ cio had a method in his tyranny ; and he never proceeded to any act of violence, without first consulting with his council, and obtaining their sanction to,his measures. On his return from the castle of Valperga, he called together this friendly assembly, and represented to them the ей! he incurred by permitting so violent a Guelph as the eountes» Euthanasia, to pre¬ serve her power, and erect her standard, in tiie very heart of his principality. His council replied to his representations with one voice, that ihe castle must be reduced.
The following morning Castruccio bade Ar¬ rigo di Gu¿.~gi carry a message to Euthanasia. Arrigo had always been a favourite with die countess ; and Castruccio; thought that it would be more delicate and forbearing, to send one so young and unpresuming as the bearer of his most displeasing message* Euthanasia received the youth with kindness ; they talked on va¬ rious subjects ; but she carefully refrained from mentioning Castruccio's name, or alluding to the late transactions at Lucca ; and it was long before Arrigo could summon courage to intro¬ duce the topic himself; at length he said ; " Madonna, I bear a message to you from the prince/' Euthanasia changed colour when he was alluded to ; he, whom she now feared, as for¬ merly she had dwelt on his idea with love. She replied hastily; " What is Anteiminelli's pleasure with me? 4 Speak quickly, that there may soon be an end of a subject, which I cannot even think upon without agitation/* " Yet I must intreat your patience, for my message is neither^mort nor unimportant ; and you must pardon me that I am its bearer: L 4 l
you know by what ties I am bound to Cas¬ truccio ; and if I now obey him, do not, dear¬ est countess, condemn me too harshly. He in treats you to remember what he said when he visited you two days ago; he has since discussed the affair in council ; and it is agreed that you can no longer be permitted to re¬ tain your independence. You know that the prince is all-powerful here ; his army is well disciplined and formidable; his commands every where submitted to unquestioned. Look at every castle and village for miles around ; they acknowledge his law ; you cannot dream therefore of resisting ; and, if you refuse to submit, it is because you believe that he will not proceed to extremities with you. My dear Euthanasia, this is a grievous task for me, and one which no earthly power but Castruccio could have persuaded me to undertake ; pardon me, if I appear unmannerly when I repeat his words. 6i He says, that he does not forget the friend¬ ship that once subsisted between you } md that he deeply regrets that your coldness and vio¬ lence caused a division between you; but this
is a question of state, and not a private alter¬ cation ; and he would be unworthy of the trust reposed in him, if he permitted his individual inclinations to interfere with his duty towards the public. He is commanded by the ruling powers of his country, to compel the sub¬ mission of thè castle and rock of Valperga -, and he is resolved to obey them : he intreats you to spare both yourself and him the unhap¬ piness you will inflict on him, and the blood that must be shed, if you resist. It would be absurd to attempt to defend yourself alone : to give your cause the least chance of success you must call in foreign aid ; and, by bringing the Florentines into the heart of this valley, you not only introduce war and destruction into the abodes of peace, but you act a treasonable part (forgive me if I repeat his word), in taking advantage ofthe power which you hold through his indulgence, to endeavour to bring ruin upon him. But, whatever you determine upon, whe¬ ther to hold out with your own small forces or to call strangers to your assistance, he ι s resolved to spare no exertion, and to be stop¬ ped by no obstacle, until he has reduced into
his own hands Valperga and all its dependen¬ cies ; at the same time that you, so far from being a loser, except in nominal advantages, shall be fully compensated for your present Euthanasia listened attentively, altiiough sometimes dbdain hovered on hef lips, and at times her eyes flashed fire at the words she heard. She paused a moment to collect 'her thoughts, and then she replied: "My dear Arrigo, I pardon most freely all the part you take in these unfortunate circumstances; I would that the prince had not so fár degraded himself, as to veil his tyranny with hypocrisy and falsehood ; bis is the power, and not the senate's ; to him I reply ; and, casting away all the vain pretexts with which he would hide, peruaps to himself, his injustice and lawless ambition, ï reply with plain words to his art¬ ful speech ; and I beg that without any altera¬ tion you faithfully deliver my message to him. " I will never willingly surrender my power hito his hands : I hold it for the good of my people, who are happy under my government, and towards whom I shall ever perform my
duty. I fook upon him as a lawless tyrant, whom every one ought to resist to the utmost of their power ; nor wiil I through cowardice give way to injustice. I may be exasperated beyond prudence ; but right is on my side : I have preserved the articles of my alliance witii him, and I will hold them still ; but, if he at¬ tack me, I shall defend myself, and shall hold myself justified in accepting the assistance of my friends. If I had not that right, if indeed I had pledged myself to submit whenever he should call upon me to resign my birthright, what an absurd mockery is it to talk of his moderation towards me ! I acknowledge tliat he might long ago have attempted, as now he threatens, to reduce this castle to a frightful ruin ; but then I should have resisted as I shall now ; resisted with my own forces, and those of my allies. Valperga stands on a barren rock, and the few villages that own its law are poor and unprotected ; but this castle is as dear to me as ail his dominion is to him ; 1 inherited it from røy ancestors ; and if I wished to despoil myself of power, İt would be to make
my people free, and not to force them to enter the muster-roll of a usurper and a tyrant. " My dear Arrigo, do not endeavour to per¬ suade me to alter røy purpose; for it is fixed. I am not young nor old enough to be scared by threats, nor happy enough to buy life on any terms Castruccio may choose to oifer. I am willing to lose it in a just cause ; and such 1 conceive to be йгг preservation of my inhe¬ ritance." Arrigo was too raw and inexperienced to contend in words witli Euthanasia; Jbe was overcome by her enthusiasm, which, although i-erious and apparently quiet, was as a stream that runs deep and wavelets, but whose course is swifter and stronger than that which wastes its force in foan> and noise.
CHAPTER X. Castruccio reconnoitres for a Surprise. ~~Егп- bassy of Tripalda* ARRIGO returned sorrowfully to Lucca. He found Castruccio playing at chess with Mor¬ decastelli; while a priest, Battista Tripalda, sat observing the game, and spoiling it by his interference. " Nay, Vanni, I shall check-mate you next move," said Castruccio; " think again if you cannot escape, and make better play. Wei), Arrigo, is peace or war the word you bring г ь> " You must choose that, my lord ; the coun¬ tess wishes for peace, but she will not submit." " Not submit ! " cried Tripalda, stalking wuh his tall, upright figure into the middle cr the room. " The woman is mad ! I see that there is something wrong in this, that I тия ,^et right." " Aye," said Mordecastelli ; " as you set L 5
my game right for me, and made me юзе two knights and a castle ľ " I wish he could persuade Euthanasia to lose a castle, and then all would go well. Are there no hopes, Arrigo ? tell me what she said/* Arrigo repeated her message, endeavouring to soften her expressions ; feut Castruccio was too experienced in the management of the human mind, not to draw from the youth the very words she had uttered. " A murderer aad a tyrant ! pretty words applied to- ше, because I put a traitor to deaths who otherwise would have placed my head ob a Florentine pike. To What extremities' am I driven 1 L would give the world not to go to open war about her miserable castle : yet have it I must, and that quickly, before she can send for her Florentine friends. What »spirit she has! I do not blame her; but, by St, Martin, I must tame it'. Vanni, send for Cas¬ tiglione ; I must give him instructions for the conduct of the siege : I will have nothing to do with it personally ; so tomorrow ï shall away to keep the Florentines in check, if not to beat them." ~~
а Му югаУ' ^aidTripatóa,tlm%4ï%1iïmsjdf up before Castruccio with an^ôrof the utmost selt-consequence, " you have often found me of use in occasiona ef thir sort ; asid I intreat you to authorize me to go and expostulate with the countess ; I doubt not tiiat I shaü bring you a favourable answers ^she must liear rea* son, and from no one i» she so likely to hear it as from myself/' " You little know her disposition, friend Tripalda ; but the most hopeless effort is worth making, before 1 declare war, and take her possessions by force. Go therefore to-morrow morning early ; in the mean time I will give Castiglione my instructions ; that, if your per¬ suasions are vain, he may commence the at* tack the following day/' Tripalda then retired to meditate the speech by which he should persuade Euthanasia to yield; 4vhile Castruccio, desperate of any com- I edition, gave his full directions for the con¬ duct of the siege. 44 If I were not in the secret of the place," said he to Castiglione, " I might well believe die castle of Valperga to be impregnable, ex-
cept by famine; and that would be a tedious proceeding ;; but 1 know of other means which will give you entrance before mgbtfaH. Lead a detachment of your most useless soldiers to the pathway which conducts to the main en¬ trance of the castle ; that of course will be well guarded ; and, if the defence is directed with common judgement, the disadvantages under which the assailants must labour would render the attempt almost insane. But, as I said, let your more useless troops be employed diere ; they will 1 гер the beheged in play ; while you will conduct a chosen band to sui e victory. You remember the fountain of the rock, beside which we were feasted, when the countess held her court, and where she sus¬ tained the mockery of a siege ; to be conquer¬ ed in play, as she now will be in earnest. You remember the narrow path tliat leads from the fountain to the poster», a gate, which, though strong, may easily be cut through by active arms and good hatchets. í know a path whicii leads from this valley to the fountain ; it is long, difficult, and almost, impracticable : but I have scaled it, and m may you and yeur followers.
To-night before the moon rises, and it rites late, we will ride to the spot, and when you are in possession of this secret, the castie is at your mercv* 1 ' It was now the beginning of the month of October; the summer, which had been par¬ ticularly sultry, had swiftly declined ; already the gates which attend upon the equinox swept through the woods, and the trees, who know His voice, and suddenïy grow grey vvith fear, And tremble and despoil themselves, had already begun to obey the command oí their ruler : the delicate chesnut woods, which last dare encounter the blasts of spring, whose tender leaves do not expand until they may become a shelter to the swallow, and which first hear the voice of the tyrant Libeccio, as he comes all conquering from the west, had already changed their hues, and shone yellow and red, amidst the sea-green foliage of tlie olives, die darker but light boughs of the cork uees, and tlie deep and heavy masses of ilexes and pines. The evening was hot ; for the Li¬ beccio, altiiough it shuts out the sun with
clouds, yet brings a close and heavy air, tiiat Warnas, while it oppresses.. When evening came, Castruccio and his companion addressed themselves for their ex¬ pedition. ТЪеу mufììed themselves m their capuchins, md, leaving the town of Lucca, crossed the plain, riding swiftly and silently along. Who can descend into the heart of man, and know what the prince felt f as he conducted Castiglione to the secret path, dis¬ covered by his love, now used to injure and subdue her whom he had loved? The white walls of the castie, half concealed by the cork and ilex trees which grew on the platform be¬ fore it, stood quietly and silent ; and she who dwelt within, whose heart now beat fast with fear and wretchedness, was the lovely and be¬ loved Euthanasia, whose sweet and soft eyes, which shone as violets beneath a load of snow, had formerly beamed unutterable love on him, and whose gentle and modulated voice had once pronouuced words of tenderness^ which, though changed, he could never forget,—it was fhe, the beautiful, who had lived on earth as the enshrined statue of a divinity, adorning all
places where «he appeared, end adored by all who saw her ; it was she, whose castie he was about to tafee and raze, it was against her that he now w&rieti with $ fixed resolution to con¬ quer. Castruccio thought on all this ; lie call¬ ed to mind her altered mien, and the coldness which had changed her heart from a fountain of burning love to an idy spring : and this awakened a feeling which he would fain have , believed to be indignation. «'Shall this false girl," he muttered, " enjoy this triumph over me ? Aiid shall the love which she despises, save her from the fate to which her own cold¬ ness and imprudence consign her ? Let her yield ; and she will find the Castruccio whom bhe calumniates, neither a tyrant nor a mon¬ ster; but, if she resist, on her be the burthen of the misery that must follow." Yet still, as officious conscience brought for¬ ward excuses for her, and called on him again and again to beware, he rode along side Casti¬ glione, and entered into conversation. " To¬ morrow at this hour,",he said^ " you and your troop must come along this road, and hide yourselves in the forest which we are about to
enter. When morning is up, do not long de¬ lay to scale tiie mountain, and enter jthe castie, for the sooner you take it, the less blood, will be shed î order the battţe so, tiiat the troops you leave for tiie false attack may be fully engaged with the besieged before you enter ; and then, coming behind the garrison, you can drive them down the mountain among their enemies, so that they may all be taken prisoners, at small expence either of their lives or ours." Tiiey now dismounted ; and, leaving their horses to their servants, began to ascend the acclivity. They moved cautiously along ; and, if tliere had been any to listen to their footsteps, the sound was drowned by 'the singing of the pines, which moaned beneath the wind. Fol¬ lowing the path of a torrent, and holding by the jutting points of rock, or the bare and tan¬ gled roots of die trees that overhung them, they proceeded slowly up the face of the moun¬ tain. Then turning to the right, tiiey pene¬ trated a complete wilderness of forest ground, where the undergrowth of the giant tree?, and tlie fern and brambles, covered every path, su
that Castruccio had need of all his sagacity to distinguish the slight peculiarities of scene that guided him. They awoke the hare from her form ; and the pheasants, looking down from tlie branches of the trees, flew away with a sharp cry, artd the whiz of their heavy wings, as their solitude was disturbed. Their progress was difficult and slow* but, after their toil had continued nearly two hours, Castruccio exclaimed, " Yes, 1 see that 1 am right ! " and he paused a moment beside a spring, near which grew a solitary, but gigantic cypress, that seemed, as you looked up, to at¬ tain to the bright star which shone right above it, and towards which its moveless spire point¬ ed ; "I am right ; İ know this place well ; mark it, Castiglione ; and now our journey is almost ended." It was here, that in their childish days Cas¬ truccio and Euthanasia often played; their names were carved on the rough bark of the cypress, and here, in тепюгу of their infantine friendship, they h' i since met, to-renew the vows they had formerly made, vows now broken, scattered to the winds, more worthless
than the fallen leaves of autumn on which he then trod. The way to the rock which over¬ looked .the fountain was now short, but more difficult thflfl ever ; and both hands and feet were necessary to conquer the ascent. At length they came to a pinnacle, which, higher than the castie, overlooked the whole plain ; and immediately under was the alcove which sheltered Euthanasia's fountain. "J see no path which may lead to the foun¬ tain, my lord," said Castiglione. " There is none," replied the prince, " nor (hú I ever get into the castie tins way ; but I have observed the place, and doubt not of the practicability of my plan." .Castruccio drew from under his cloak a rope, and fastened it to the shattered stump of a lightning-blasted tree; by the help of this rope, and a stick shod with iron which he car¬ ried in his hand, -he contrived with the aid of Castiglione to reach a projecting ledge in the rock ahqut two foeţ wide, which rap round the precipice about ten feet from its base ; the fountain Ôowed fram а crevice in this ledge, and steps wseæ hewn out, of the rock, leading
fpom the source to the basin. €кШйса<> pointed out these circumstances to his compa¬ nion, and rriade it fullyapparertt tfcat¿ with a little boldness and caution, ihéy might arrive fey the*means he had pointed out at the path which led to the postern ofthe eastle. A few questions £ asked by Castiglione, Which thé prince answered with accuracy and minute¬ ness, sufficed to clear all the doubts which the former had entertained, and to explain the whole of his proceeding. As they returned, however, Castiglione said suddenly, ** My lord, you understand this path so much better than I, why will you not under¬ take the attack f " u I thank you," replied Castruccio, with a bitter smile ; " but this business falls to* your share ; 1 must away to keep off the aid the countess expects from the Florentines." They descended slowly ; the-moon had risen, which would have discovered their Ţjath to them, but that she was hid behind «o thick a woof of dark and lighming*heàrmg clouds, that her presence sufficed only to* dispel the pitchy blackness, in which, but for her, they
had been enveloped. Every now and then the growling of distant but heavy thunder shook tiie air, and was answered by the screeching ofthe owl, and tlie screams of the birds whom it awoke from tlieir sleep among the trees. The two adventurers soon reached the valley ; and, mounting their horses, crossed the plain at full gallop; and the strong Libeccio against which they drove, cutting the air with diificul- ty, warmed tiie spirits, and somewhat dissi¬ pated the melancholy, which, in spite of all his efforts, oppressed Castruccio. He arrived much fatigued at his journey's end; and, whatever might be the revolutions in his feel¬ ings, or the remorse which stung him when he reflected on the work for which he pre¬ pared, throwing himself on his couch, deep sleep quickly overcame all ; nor did he awake, until an attendant came to announce to him, that the day was advanced, that the troops had long quitted Lucca, and that his principal offi¬ cers waited only for him to join them in their march towards the Florentine camp/ Cas. truccio then shook off sleep ; and, having ex¬ amined well that his esquire had omitted no
piece of his armour which another horse bore, and having visited his charger which was to be led unbacked to the field, he mounted a black palfrey ; and, merely saying to Castigli¬ one, as he passed him in the palace court, "You understand all,"—-he joined his offi¬ cers, and they rode off on the road to Flo¬ rence. As they quitted the town, they met Tri* palda, who, accosting the prince^ told him, that he was now going to Valperga, and that he did not doubt that his arguments would in¬ duce the countess to surrender. Castruccio shook his head in disbelief, and, hastily wish¬ ing him good-success, put spurs to his horse, apparentiy impatient to quit every thing that reminded him of the odious task he .had left his friends to perform. Battista Trİpalda, the ambassador of Cas¬ truccio on this occasion, was a canon of the cathedral of St. Ambrose at Perugia. By this time the colleges of canons, who liad before lived in common like monks, had been dissol¬ ved, and each member wa« permitted to live privately, receiving his share of the yearly in-
come which was before employed^* a com- mpn stocb But th^cianouš had offices to? per¬ form in the church, which obliged them to re¬ side in ihe. town, Ла which* the, cathedrals to which they belonged was situated ; Tripalda had howefer been long absent from* hia duties) nor did bis bishop ever enquire after him, or require him to return. He had appeared, at Lucca about a y ear before this time, unknown and unrecommended ; but he had intruded himself into the, palaces ofthe nobles, and been well received :, his eccentric marmers made them pardon his opinions, and the subtleties of his mind forced them to forgive his uncouth and arrogant demeanour. Yet, although re¬ ceived by all, he was liked by none, for there was a mystery about him that no one couid di¬ vine ; and we seldom like what we do not com¬ prehend. Be was au unbelieving priest, yet was permitted fo exercise the clerical/unctions ; he was a pan who cried out against the si¬ mony and wickedness .of the Roman religipn, yet be was. tolerated ,by all its „members ; he was equally severe against tyrants and lords, yet he was. received at every CQUit in Italy.
He was an earnest panegyrizer of republics and democracies ; yet he was satisfied with no existing form of government, because none was sufficiently free : he contended that each man ought tó be his own king and judge; y4 he pretended to morality, and to be a strict cen¬ sor of manners and luxury. He had a deep insight into artful and artificial character, and a kind of instinctive prudence in extricating himself from the most embarrassing circum¬ stances ; so tliat his penetration almost gave him the appearance of a tamperer in the for¬ bidden arts, which however he held in su-» preme contempt. He was equally well received by the opposite factions, allying himself with neither, but con¬ demning both. When he first appeared at Lucca, he was humble and mild, pretending tp nothing but uncorrupted and uncorruptible virtue, desiring none of the goods of fortune, except that which she could not withhold from him, namely, the esteem and friendship of all good men. But this was merely the prelude to what was to follow. He* was as those dwarfs we read of in fairy tale?, who at first
appear small and impotent, but who on further ^aqttamtaiieefassirøie tbe forni ofjremendous ^iamt»; so# whm Ы became familiar with hie newt friends» jb&wt off* hia. modest disguise, and-appeared yam» presumptuous aodl insolent, deüveiiaghb opinions as oracles, violent when opposed in argument, contemptuous even when ftgreeé'with,; there was besides something buf- foonfeh i» his manner, which he occasionally endeavoured to pass off for wit and i magi na¬ toon, and at other times, served him as a cloak for deep designs and dangerous opinions. Tiie Guelphs declared that they believed him to be a Ghibeline spy ; the G hibelines, that he was under pay from tiie Pope ; many said, tliat he tampered with both parties, and betrayed both. Worse stories had been whispered concerning hin«, but they were believed by few ; it was áaid that the fiagrant wickedness of his actions had caused him to be banished from Perugia ; hut this w&s 4ifeproved at once, før if so, why was he tmt derived öf Jib emoluments ün the church? *Fh& $Ш ' conjeture concerning * hhn was 4m Ы wat a «pr; btri, hwever £hat raigbt be,
he escaped detection, and contrived to main¬ tain his confidence with the chiefs of tbe op¬ posite factions, and among these was Eutha¬ nasia. She admired his talents* beİieved him to be honest, and refused to listen to tiie accu¬ sations advanced against him, since the man¬ ner in which they were brought forward stamped them with the show of unfounded ca? lunmies. She was sometimes irritated by hb impertinence, and shocked at his want of deli¬ cacy ; but she had heard that early mİsf@rtunes had deranged his understanding, and she pitied and forgave him. Indeed she had icnown him a very short time ; and he had not yet thrown off his mask of humility and virtue, which he ever wore on his first appearance oa a new scene« Euthanasia waited witli impatience to hear the result of her message lo Castruccio* She could not believe that he would put his threats in execution ; but, in case of the worsts she re¬ solved to oppose his pretensions, and to, use every means to preserve her independence» She had sent* the same night of her interview with Arrigo, to intreat the Fbrejatiaegeperal to djis- VOL.

patch a brigade for her defence, and to request tiie assistance of an abb officer in sustaining ti*e siege she might encounter. She called to¬ gether the few militia of her villages. She vi-* sited the works of tiie castie, and gave orders for the immediate demolition of all roads and bridges on the first advance of the enemy ; and then, overcome by the sense of wretchedness which clung to her in spite of the exalted state of her mind, she shrunk to solitude, and tried to seek in the recesses of her own soul for the long-studied lessons of courage and fortitude. She believed herself justified, nay called upon to oppose the encroachments of the prince of Lucca ; she felt roused to resistance by his menaces, andtiic implied accusation of treachery with which he had endeavoured to brand her. Her innocence made her proud, her spirit of independence, bold ; she had e*cr refused to submit to his usurpations ; her cas¬ tle had often been the asylum for his victims, and herself the aider of the persecuted. " I may fall," she thought ; " but í will not stoop. 1 may become his victim ; but I will never be his biave* I rcfubcd to yield to him when I

" This is going too far," said Euthanasia, half angrily ; u you imagine perhaps that 1 am already the slave of your lord, that you no longer preserve the respect wliich even then would be due to me.

Any man but Tri palda might hav e been awed by the dignity of Euthanasia, and the restrain¬ ed indignation, that glistened in her eyes, and flushed her cheek. She rose to bid the priest farewel, and her serious manner made him pause for an instant in his address; but his accustomed impudence quickly overcame the momentan* shame, und he aaid, u I came to

I fear not ! " Tripalda returned to Lucca. Castruccio had left the town; and Castiglione, hearing tlie result of the priest's embassy, instantly prepared for the attack. Heralds were seat in due form to demand the surrendei of the Cas¬ tle ; and, when refused, war was immediately declared* In the mean time the Florentine army liad advanced into the Lucchese territory; but, when they beai d of the march of Castruecio, they fell back to Fucecchio, and pitched their tents on the banks of the mer Guisciana.
Castruccio came up to them with his trooli ; but, being on opposite sides of the river, and not caring to cross it in face of the enemy, both armies remained observing each other's motions, each preparing to attack the other on the first shew of fear or retreat. The Floren* tme general had received the message of Eu¬ thanasia, but he found it difficult to comply with her wishes ; for any troops sent to her aid must pass the Guisciana, and that was tco well guarded to permit of any but a general ,,assage and attack. He communicated her situation to the Florentine government, which <ent her a small troop with Bondelmonti at its head, who, making the circuit of Bologna and the Modenese mountains, arrived on the eve of the attack, having with infinite difficulty surmounted the fortified passages of the moun¬ tains ; so that many of liis followers being macte piiboncr», and othcis left behind, he made his appearance at Valperga with not more than fitty men.
CHAPTER XL Valperga. taken. AFTER the departure of Tripalda, Euthanasia remained long on the battlements of her castle, watching the men who were employed in re¬ pairing and erecting some outworks for its de¬ fence. Every now and then she heard a mur¬ muring near her, a slight noise, and then a v oice which said— 4t Aye, that will do ; this helmet is still too large, I must find some way to cut it round the edges." Looking up t she saw at a small window of one ofthe projecting towers the Albinois, who appeared furbishing and repairing arms* " Are we so straitened for men," she said, " that you are obliged to turn armourer, my poor ДЗшсЫ" " Not #n armourer, but a soldier, lady ; to¬ morrow I gird on my sword for your defence." 44 You, and a sword ! $ay, lhat is дшроь-
bible ; you must not expose yourself to danger, where you can do no good." " Countess, have firm hope; I have learned from the stars, that tomorrow is a fortunate day for us. I have visited the holy fountain ; and, sprinkling its waters three times around, I have called on its saints to aid us : tomorrovv is named as a lucky day for us, and 1 will be among your defenders. n He spoke earnestly ; and so highly wrought were the feeliogs of Euthanasia, that, although at another time she might have smiled, she could now with difficulty repress het tears. " If you would defend me," she replied, 4t wait then near me ; I will not indeed have you risk your life to no encL" " Wh)V Madonna," said Bindo, " should you care more for mylife, than for those of the brave fellows who will tomorrow die for you ? We shall succeed ; but death will be among us ; and tomorrow many a child will lose its rather, aud many a wife her husband, fighting ior this heap of stones which can feel neither defeat nor triumph. I will be among them;, fear not, St. Martin has declared for us."

There was something in the name of Bondelmonti that struck a favourable chord in her heart ; he had bees her fadier's friend ; he was her guardian, and, although she had sometimes run counter to his advice, yet she always felt most happy when his opi¬ nion coincided with hers. His presence thus announced seemed to cancel half her care; she collected all the courage she possessed, and that was a mighty store, and descended, even smiling, to the hall ; her cares and regrets were leashed like dogs by the huntsmen, but they neither bayed nor yefled, but cowered in si¬ lence. Bondelmonti was struck by the sere¬ nity of her aspect; and his countenance changed from the doubt it had before ex¬ pressed, to a frank and gallant address* "Madonna/* said he, "the work we un¬ dei take is difficult; Castruccio keeps our army in check, and guaids the parses; and the ñíty

Eutiianasia thanked him in the warm lan¬ guage ber feeling heart dictated, and he con¬ tinued; *í should have much to say tô you,* much encouragement from your friends and
messages of praise and affection ; but my time is short; believe then in om tvwd, that all your Florentine friends love, approve and ad* mim you; and if you fall, whkh this good sword forbids we shall at least have this con¬ solation, that our long absent. Euthanasia will reappear among us. But now to the. works of war -s í will apply to your seneschal to know what food you have in the castle, and what possibilities there are of increasing your stock ; and your principal officers shall shew me your works of defence, that I may concert with them the plan for to-morrow's combat/ 1 Euthanasia however undertook this task her* self: she was too much agitated, not to find some relief in the shew of composure which she preserved with Bondelmonti, and m the exertion of ex-plaining and pointing out the va¬ rious modes of defence which she had adopted, in addition to those with which nature had furnislied her liabitaţiorb The castle was built, as I haye before said, on the projecting plat¬ form of a precipitous mountain : the wall of the-edificeitself was thick and strong; and but
a small way removed from it was a lower wall, buil t with corner towers and battlements, which at once defended the main building, ami shel¬ tered the besieged, who could shower stones and arrows on the assailants from the port¬ holes, and be in no danger of retaliation. Be¬ fore the gate of the castle was a green plot, about fifteen paces across, planted with a few cork and ilex trees, and surrounded by a bar¬ bican or low wall built on the edge of the pre¬ cipice, which, high, bare, and inaccessible, hung over the plain below. Between the wall and the barbican, a path ran round one side of the caètle, which was terminated by massy gates and a portcullis; and it was tliere that, crossing the chasm which insulated the castle, by lueajis of a drawbridge, you found the path that sondueted to the plain. This path was defended by various works ; palisades, wooden towers to shelter archets, and more by nature herself, for the rock and the trees weie all ;>o many asylums whence the defenders could uninjured prevent ţbe approach of an enemy, 41 Tim is ¿l eAccJJjţmt," e &' ( l Bondelmonti ;
" it is impossible that all the armies of Italy could force this pass, though it were defended only by a handful. But, Madonna, is there no other en trance to your castle? Is there no postern with a path npor down ihe mountain, whose secret your enemies may learn, and thus attack you unawares ŕ " «Kone; the only postern is that which opens on a path conducting to a small foun¬ tain about a hundred paces up the acclivity; but there it stops, and the rock rising precipi¬ tously behind forbids approach." " It is well. 1 will now review your sol¬ diers, appoint their various posts, and see that raine are refreshed ; then, cousin, having tast¬ ed your wine, I will go to rest, that I may awake betimes to-morrow. I am resolved that all shall go well ; Castruccio will be defeated ; and you shall ever be, as you descrv c, the cas¬ tellana of Valperga." Tho tables were spread in the great hall of the castle, and heaped with wine and food. After Euthanasia had seen every want of her guests supplied, she retired to her own room .it the eastern angle of the cattle, one window
of which overlooked tiie whole plain øf Jjucca; acdsiie eat near tbif window, unable torest or sleep, in tivat breathkss and feverish state, in vvhiűh^e««^c4^x^ing, but ипсогЫп danger. ; Theít^il of night was at length withdrawn ; first Euthanasia saw the stars was faint, and then tiißi western sky caught a crimson tinge from the opposing sun. It was longere he climbed the eastern hill; but his rays fell upon the opposite mountains, and the windows of tiiecastie of Valperga shone daringly bright. A remillk was sounded 'm the court below, and roused Urn young countess from her wak- iag dreams, to the reality that yawned as a gulph before her. First, she composed her drassf, ,Ша ^ound the wandering locks of her hai» round her head ; then for a moment ¿he siood^her hands-folded on her bosom, her еуез časť -up to heaven. At first her counte¬ nance expressed pain : hut it changed ; her pale cheek began to glow, her brow became clear frdâiitiiá f eloud that had dimmed it, her tyes f rew^béghtery-and tor whole'form gren¬ eti digutt|^nd ftrmnes». 4t l ою my duty, ,? she tiidught,^an.d in'that dear helief do I place

Bondelmonti kissed bet hand; «Farewel, my friends," she said; "you risk your lives for me, and the sacrifice of mine were a poor recompense ; my Ыдаоиг» my every hope rests upon your swords; they are wielded by those wh© love me, and Ido not-fear the result." Bondelmonti addressedthimself to the, com¬ bat, ordered the men. to their posts, and took his own station on the drawbridge of the cas*- tie. The winding path which led to the foot
of the mountain, Was lined with arehetø and slmgeis, who were hid behind the projecting rocks or trees, or *vitbtn small wooden towers, erected for the purpose. Ä chosen band arm¬ ed with kfag^ »pears was stationed in firm ar¬ ray at the most precipitous part of the path, who, drawn up incluse rank, arid advancing their arms, formed an outwork of iron' spikes-, impossible to be passed or driven back. The foremost in the combat were tho dependents of Euthanasia ; they were foil ofthat loud, but undisciplined courage which anger and fear inspire; Bindo was among them, and he ha¬ rangued them, saying, that every sign in the heavens, and every power of air 5 was propi¬ tious to tlieir mistress ; at other times they had derided his superstition ; but now it acted as another incentive to their indignation, and nip- porter for their courage. In the mean time Euthanasia had retired to the apartment of Lauretta. This unfortu¬ nate lady had Tremained in the castle since the death of her husband ; and such was the agony of grief she endured, that Euthanasia had not communicated to lier the threats of
Castruccio, and tlie approaching siege. The noise of aims, and the sound of many voices alarmed her ; and «he wildly asked the cause. Her. friend related to her the events of the few last days, and endeavoured to calm her ; Lau¬ retta listened in tear ; she had suffered so much by the like contentions, tiiat every thing pre¬ sented itself to her in the gloomiest point of view. Grasping the countess's hand, she in- treated her to submit; " You know not what a siege is," she cried ; " my father's castle was stormed, and therefore I well know. Even if Castruccio were at the head of his troops, he would in vain endeavour to restrain their fury; a triumphant soldier is worse than the buffalo of the forest, rmd no humanity can check his thirst for blood and outrage; they will con¬ quer, and neither God nor man can save us," Euthanabia tried to soothe her ; but in vain. She wept bitterly, and prayed so earnestly that the cotmtess would spare them both the utter misery they would endure, that Euthanasia was for a moment staiftled by her adjurations ; but then, recalling her thoughts, she replied uith gentle firmness, and bade her lay a* ide
het fears wliich were uniouadeë, fm there imâ notMng Id dťead save m ежу imprisonmeat, if they- should be overcome. Aad iter* as they w«*e &Мщ thus, a mes¬ senger caalefrosff Bonéelrøoatii K The gene» cal deires you tø have good heart," he said; 'Hhe t^odps of the enemy advance ţ and, if we may jud^a by their appearance^ they are few, and e^en those few the refuse of the prince's army." Euthanasia listened incredulously ; for she knew that however doubtful the decision of the combat might be, the contention must be fierce. Soon the war-cry arose Irom without the castle, and was echoed from the walls and mountains ; when it ceased, it was answered by the Ghibeline cry from the assailants. But this only proved the truth of Bondel- montľs assertion, that they were few, and of no note ; for the shout was not that exhilaf a* ting sound, that echoes tlie souľa triumph, and, borne along the line, raises responsive ar¬ dour in every breast; it was loud, but soon died away. Wearied by the childish remonstrances of
Lauretta, Euthanasia descended fa the, pl^tt* ÎQxm *?f,the castle, and« leaped over Jtbe ЬрФ*- can ; but she could see aotlùng^ tjaough her gauwere stunned ЬуД1>е cries^ and clash of arms, that rose from the valley* IJeUirning to the inner courts she met some men who were bearing tlie wounded from tlie fields and bring- iug them for succour to the castk ; for a mo¬ ment Ijőj heart ьшж vyithin her, for a moment stie was pierced with grief, as she thought—" " This is iny work I " But she recovered her¬ self—"It must all be endured," said she; "1 have undertaken a part, and will not faint on the threshold. Spirit of my father, aid me!" Beds had been prepared in a large apart¬ ment of the castle, and Euthaaasia mingled vvith the women who ministered to the wound¬ ed; she bound them with her own hands, cheered tliem wklţ her voice, and endeavour¬ ed, by supporting their minds, to ajlcuate the шъ& of bodily pain. The men, who saw her flitting like an angel about tjiem, aiding and ministering to their wants, felt all the love and VOL, lb N
gratitude that such unwonted, but gracious kindness might inspire. "Fear not, lady," they said ; we are even more numerous than those who attack us; already they are tired, and out of breath ; fear not, the day is ours." A messenger also came from Bondelmonti, to say, that the imprudence of an under-officer had caused the few to fall who had fallen, but that her troops were now all sheltered, and, that without the loss of a man they would either destroy all the assailants, or drive them down the steep ; and this assertion appeared confirm¬ ed, since no more wounded were brought in. Thus reassured, Euthanasia left the hall, and ascended to her own apartment ; her spirit was lightened of much of its burthen ; the first bar¬ rier had been passed ; and she feared not, she- would not fear, the rest. As she thought this, a sudden scream echoed through the castle ; for a moment she was transfixed; the scream was repeated, louder and nearer, and she hastened to the window that overlooked the outer court. Thence she saw a party of soldiers in the Lucchese uniform
issue from the gate, and run round the castle towards the drawbridge ; as they came out in file she thought their numbers would never end, and she recognized several of the oSàcers as those of the highest rank in Castruccio^ army ; the last at length disappeared, and she looked around for an explanation. The castle was silent ; she stood alone in the room ; and even the echo of footsteps reached her not : she paused a moment; and then, weary of further doubt, she hastened to the room of Lau¬ retta, and found it full of soldiers,—the enemy's soldiers ; while the poor girl, pale and trem¬ bling, sat bewildered and silent. Euthanasia entered from a small door, leading from a pri¬ vate staircase : her first words were addressed to her friend ; "Fear not," she cried ; u vv«* are betrayed ; but fear not" The soldiers, seeing her appear, had sent foi their chief officer, who came forward, baying, " The castle is oars ; and, Madonna, it were well that you ordered your people to yield, for further resistance would be useless, an t could only cause more bloodshed : we are eom* Ná
îimnded by our general to act with the greatest moderation." 44 It is enough/' replied Euthanasia» quietly ; 44 the commander will judge of the necessity of submissions but see,, you frighten tiiis lady, who is ill find delicate, I beseech you to leave this room awhile; if I find that indeed no further resistance can be made, I shall soon be prepared to obey what orders you may bring." о " Madonna, we withdraw as you desire : but permit me to add, that it is the general's orders that we escort you to Lucca this even¬ ing: until then we shall not intrude upon you. The soldiers quitted the room ; and Eutha¬ nasia, leaving Lauretta with her servant, re¬ tired to her own apartment, Here she found several of her attendants, who told with many teais that there was no longer any hope; that the enemy, entering at the postern, had attack¬ ed her soldiers from behind, and driven them down the mountain, and that the party left in tlie castle having raised the drawbridge, weie
now in undisturbed possession. Euthanasia heard all this with an unaltered mien, and, when the melancholy tale was finished, she bade them leave her, and go to the commanding officer of the troop to receive orders for their further proceeding, but not to return to her, until she should command their attendance.
CHAPTER XII. Euthanasia at Lucca. The castle bell tolled the Ave Maria for the last time, answering the belfries of the various convents in the vale below. "There is my knell ! " cried Euthanasia. At first she thought that it would please her, in quitting for ever the abode of her ancestors, to array herself in mourning garments ; but then the simplicity of her mind made her instinctively shun any thing that had the appearance of afíèctation ; so she covered her head with a white veil, folded her capuchin about her, and returned to the chamber of Lauretta to prepare for her removal. Castiglione sent thither to desire admittance ; when he came, he felt awed by the deport¬ ment of Euthanasia, who received him with that slight tinge of pride mingled with her ac¬ customed dignity, which adversity naturally
bestows on the good. He announced that the escort had arrived to convey them to Lucca ; Euthanasia bowed her head in acquiescence ; and, supporting Lauretta, with an unfaltering step she left for the last time the castle of her ancestors ; she supported her friend with one hand, and with the other folded her veil close to her face, that no rudely curious eye might read in its expression the sorrow that she felt in her heart. " My grief is my own,'* she thought ; " the only treasure that remains to mc; and I will hoard it with more jealousy from the sight and knowledge of others, than a miser does his gold." She walked unhesitating through the hall, long the seat of her purest happiness. Her in¬ fant feet had trodden its pavement in unre-. proved gaiety ; and she thought for a moment that she saw the venerable form of her father seated in his accustomed place. But she proudly shook the softening emotion from her, and looked with a tearless eye upon the hearth, round which the soldiers of her enemy stood, profaning its sacredness by their presence. The inner court of the castle was filled by a
number of women and children, the wives of the peasantry who depended on her, who, as they saw her advance, raised one cry of grief; she started, and said in a smothered voice, " Could I not have been spared this r " " Impossible," replied Castiglione, who o\er~ heard her ; " nothing but the most brutal fo. ce could have prevented them." <v Enough," said Euthanasia ; " I am satis¬ fied." The women clung about her, kissing her hands, her garments, and throwing themselves on their knees with all the violent gesticula- t:on of Italians. They tore their hair, and í ailed on heaven to save and bless theii ir-^- tress, and to avenge her wrong;? ;—" God blets you, good people!" cried their countess; áť may you never be reminded oí my loss by any misfortune that may befal yourselves I '' And, disengaging herself from tlicir gra?p, she walked on, while they followed crying and bewailing. She crossed the di aw bridge, which was guarded at each end by soldier?; ere .-he put her fool on the opposite rock, Euthanasia paused for one moment ; it seemed to her that
all was irretrievably lost, when once she had passed the barrier which this bridge placed between her past and future life ; she glanced back once more at the castle, and looked up to the window of her apartment ; she had ex¬ pected to find it desert and blank ; but it was filled with soldiers, who stood looking from it on her departure ; she sighed deeply, and then with quicker steps hastened down the moun¬ tain. The idea that this path had been the scene of the morning's combat affrighted her; and she dared not look round, fearing that she might see some lifeless victim among the bushes and rocks on the road-side : and so it might easily have been ; for, when Castiglione had ordered the road to be cleared of the dead, many had been cast behind the projections of rock, or under the low wood, in 'heir haste ; and, as they passed, the vulture arose from among the grass, scared from his prey, and told too truly that he feasted upon limbs which that same morning had been endowed with life. The very path on which she trod was slippery with blood ; and she felt as if she walked through
one of the circles öf hell's torments*, until she reached the foot of the rock. Lauretta was placed in a litter ; Euthanasia mounted her horse ; and Üıey prepared to de¬ part : but the women again raising a cry, threw themselves about the horse, seizing the reins, and vowing that she should not leave them. " God bless you ! " cried the poor countess, who, although filled with her own grief, yet sympathized with these good people; "but now go; you may harm yourselves with your new master ; you can do no good to me." The soldiers interfered; and, opening the path before Euthanasia, she gave the reins to her horse, and rode with speed out of the hear* ing of the cry, which her people again sent up, when they saw lhat she had indeed left them. She bad outridden the rest of her party ; and, tinding berself.alone, she drew up her palfrey to wait their arrival· She looked upon the castle, no longer bers; a few quick drops fell; she dried them agaio ; and, seeing, her escort approach, she turned her horse's head, and,
without 2-word, proceeded slowly on her way to Lucca. The city-gates were shut; but, on the word being given by her escort, they were thrown open, and she entered the dark and narrow streets of the town. " My prison !" thought Euthanasia, Here the company divided : Lau¬ retta, at her own request, was conveyed to the house of the mother of Leodino ; and Eutha¬ nasia was led to the palace prepared for her reception. She took no notice of the streets tiirough which she passed, and cared little whether they conducted her to a palace or a prison ; indeed during the latter part of her ride, her strength both of mind and body so much forsook her, that she could hardly keep her seat on her horse, but rode like a veiled statue of despair. Euthanasia was led to her chamber; her attendants'came to her, but she dismissed them all ; and, her mind confused, her spirito and strength quite exhausted by long watching during several of the preceding nights, and by the exciting circumstances of the day, she threw herself dressed as she was on a couch,
and, kindly mature coming to- her aid, sank instantaneously into a heavy and dreamless sleep. JDay was far advanced, hefore she again awoke, and looked -fortir on the light, Âtfıth a sentiment,, as if the slight refreshment of spirit and strength/ she had received, were but a mockery of the sad weight that oppressed her heart. She lifted her heavy head, like a water lily whose cup is filled by a thunder shower: but, presently recalling her scattered faculties, she sat for : some time in deep meditation, en¬ deavouring to philosophize herself out of the unhappiness that she felt. The palace to which she had been conducted, was a large and magnificent one, near the outskirts of the town : it had belonged to one of the victims of Castruccio's despotism, and had the desolate and wpe-begone appearance of a mansion which has lost its master. * From the chamber where she sat, she looked upon the garden ; a square plot of ground surrounded by four high walls,-which, had been planted in the Italian taste, {but which jîovw ran ■ wild ; the small fiower-bedîMYere overgrown with weeds, and
tlie grass, a rude commoner, had thrust itself into the untrod paths; the stone-pedestals for the lemon-pots were green with moss and li¬ chens ; and here and theie the wind-borne'seed of some delicate plant had sown a lovely flower in the midst of the moist, coarse herbage which could.ill claim its fellowship. A*few cypress and box trees, which had been cut into shape, now mocked the gardener's knife with the un- pruned growth of three years ; and ivy darken¬ ed the walls side by side with the orange trees, whose golden apples shone amidst the dark foliage. A few lizardsjiad crept from beneath the stones to bask in the rays of the autumnal sun; and the frogs croaked in a reservoir or cistern, vvhich had once played as a fountain, but vvhich was now choked with weeds and dirt. Such was the desolate scene which ar¬ rested the eyes of Euthanasias as she looked from her window. 'Í The imageof my fortunes ;" she tliought, and turned away, while a tear rlowed down her cheek. Her servant now entered; and, .while she arranged her dress, the woman related the catastrophe of the siege. When the midiers
of Castruccio had appeared behind her de¬ fenders coming down from the castle, they threw themselves first on those who guarded the bridge, and took Bondelmonti and the principal Florentines prisoners: but the de¬ pendents of the countess, transported with fury, and elevated by the promises which Bindo had held out of success, rushed out of their hiding-places, and charging those at the foot of tiie rock, drove them with desperate courage down the mountain path, unmindful of the enemies who pressed upon their rear. The balde was bloody; many fell on each side; the small troop of Valpergans were destroyed almoat to a man, falling voluntary sacrifices for their mistress's preservation. A few were taken prisoners, and among them Bindo, who almost miraculously had escaped u n wounded. But, if he were not wounded İn body, his mind was al¬ most frenzied with rage and disappointment, when he saw the Lucchese flag wave from the donjon of the castle ; he tried to break from those who held him, and, weak as he appeared to be, he exerted such desperate strength, using both hands, feet, and teeth,
that the soldiers found it necessary to bind him.—As they fastened the cords, Castiglione came up : he remembered the Albino» ; and, asking why it was that he was used so roughly, he ordered them to set him free. As soon as liis bonds were loosened, without speaking or looking round, he darted off; and, running across the country as swiftly as a deer from v the hounds, was quickly out of sight. Euthanasia wept when she heard of the blood that had been spilt for her; and self- reproach, who is ever ready to thrust in his sharp sting, if he find that mailed conscience has one weak part, now tormented her that she had not yielded, before one human life had been lost in so unhappy a cause« " Do not evil that good may come," thought she. " Are not those the words of the Teacher ? I have done infinite evil, in spilling that blood whose each precious drop was of more worth than the jewels of a kingly crown ; but my evil has borne its fitting fruit ; its root in death, its pro¬ duce poison." In the course of tiie day, Arrigo Guinigi came to visit her. He came with a message
from Castruccio, who intreated her to remain quietly in the palace provided for her, until he should return to Lucca, which would be in a few days, whea he would learn from her own lips what her wishes were with regard to her future Wfe¿ Arrigo said all this with down¬ cast eyes and a heaving breast, hardly daring to speak, and much less raise his eyes upon the countess ; who replied that she would obey ; that she had much rather not see the prince; but that if he commanded it, she was ready to submit. 4t You see me, my dear Arrigo, a prisoner, despoiled of my possessions, a slave to your lord's will. Vet I hope and trust, that these events would not have created the deep sorrow with which I feel that my soul is filled, did not bitter sentiments of lost afiections, dis¬ appointed expectations, and utter hopelessness, fill up the measure of my infelicity- My good youth, we are born to misery ; so our priests tell us, and there is more sooth in tliat lesson, than m early youth we are willing to believe ; yet fortitude is the virine with which my fa¬ ther endeavoured principally to imbue røe, and I would fain not disgrace liis counsels ; but
fi' indeed a poisoned barb has entered røy heart, and I cannot draw it out." Arrigo endeavoured to comfort her.-*-" Your state is far from.hopeless ; the prinee has pro¬ mised, and intends to keep his promises that your revenues shall not be injured by the loes of your castle. At Florence you will be sur¬ rounded by friends, and every luxury and plea* sure of life; and there you may again be happy." Autumn was now far advanced, and the rains came on. The Florentine and Lucchese armies, which had remained looking at each other from opposi tèi sides of the river, were now further divided by the overflowing of its waters ; so each retreated to their several towns, and the campaign of that year ended. Cas¬ truccio returned to Lucca. His first concern was a long and private conversation vvith Cas¬ tiglione; and immediately after he'dispatched Arrigo to prepare Euthanasia for a conference. Poor girl í her heart beat, and the blood mounted to her before pale cheeks, when she heard that she was to see him whom she had loved, and to whose memory, as* of what had
been, she clung with tenacious affection. It was a cruel task for her to behold his form, grace¬ ful as it had been when she gazed on it in hap¬ pier days, and his countenance, which, but that more pride were mingled in the expres¬ sion, was as gloriously beautiful, as when it beamed love upon her ; and more than all, to hear his voice, whose soft and mellow cadences had wrapt her soul in Elysium, now to be heard as the voice of an alien. But indigna¬ tion mingled itself with these feelings, and enabled her to support the coming trial with greater courage; so, calling up ait of pride with which her delicacy might arm her, and all of fortitude which her philosophy had taught, she awaited with patience the expected moment. She sat on a low soplia ; her dress was dark ; the vest, formed of purple silk, and fastened at her waist by a silken cord, fell in large folds to her feet ; a cloak of sables hung on her shoul¬ der ; and her golden hair, partly clustered on her neck, and partly confined by a ribbon, co« vered with its ringlets her fair brow. When she heard the step of Castruccio approaching,
she became pale ; her very lips lost their co¬ lour; and her serious eyes, shorn of their beams, were as tiie deep azure of midnight, where the stars shine not He entered. W 7 hen he had sec n her last, he had been haughty and imperious ; but now his manner was all soft¬ ness, gentleness and humility ; so that, when he spoke, in spite of the high nobility of her spirit, her eyes were weighed down by the unshed tears, " Countess," he said, " pardon me, if my intrusion upon you appear ungenerous; but persons, that, like myself, are occupied in the afiairs of government, are apt to leave too much to underlings, who never do or say that which it were exactly right to have said or done. Your future peace is too dear to me, to permit me to hear from any but yourself what are your wishes and your expectations." He paused, waiting for an answer, and fixed on her his soft and fail eves, which seemed to read her soul, while a gentle smile of compas¬ sion and love played on his lips. After collect¬ ing her thoughts, she raised her eyes to reply, and met those of her former lover, whose ex-
pression seemed fraught witli all that affection he had once vowed to her. She was unable to speak ; but then, angry at her own weak¬ ness/she rallied her spirits, and replied,—" I have but one favour to intreat, which is your permission to remove instantly to Florence," " Your wishes in this respect, Madonna, are commands; yet I could have desired that you would consent to stay awhile in Lucca, I know the judgement that you have formed of me ; you look on me as a wild beast ravenous for blood, as a lawless monster, despoiled of all the feelings of humanity. I could have de¬ sired that you would stay awhile, to find and to avow your injustice ; I could wish you to stay, until the deep respect, and if you will per¬ mit the word, the love I feel for you, should make such impression on your heart, that you would allow me to assuage tho&e sorrows of wdiich I have unhappily been the cause/' 44 My ford, do not speak thus to me," replied Euthanasia, with a voice which at first ti em- bled, but which gained firmness as she conti¬ nued; " We are divided; there is an eternal barrier between us now, sealed by the blood of
those miserable people who fell for me. I can¬ not, I do not love you ; and, if a most frivo¬ lous and reprehensible weakness could make me listen now, the ghosts of the slain would arise to divide us. My lord, I cannot reason with you, I can hardly speak ; the blood of the slaughtered, the tears of the survivors, the scathed ruins of my castle, are all answers, louder than words, to your present offers. If these have been your acts of courtship, pardon me if I say, that I had rather woo the lion in his den to be my husband, than become the bride of a conqueror. But this is useless ca¬ villing, painful to both of us ; it awakens in me tiie indignation I would fain repress ; and it may kindle resentment in your heart, which is already too apt to be inflamed with that sen¬ timent. You came, you say, to learn my wishes ; you have now heard them ; let us part ; we part in that peace every Christian believer owes to his brother; I forgive you fiom my inmost heart; do not you hate me ; and thus farewel." " You forgive ше, Euthanasia ? Is then your soul so pure ? me, who indeed have grievous-
ly wronged»you; ana* however necessary my actions have been, yet have they been destruc¬ tive to you. But, if indeed you forgive me, and part in Christian amity, allow me once more to take your hand, that I may know that it is not å mere form of words, but that you express a feeling ofthe heart," Euthanasia held out her hand, which he took in both his, and holding it thus, he said : " Hear me, my loved girl ; you whom alone in the world I have ever loved. You despise, repulse, and almost hate me ; and yet, God knows, I still cherish you as tenderly, as when we told each other's love-tale first in yonder unhappy castle. I do not ask you to love me, you cannot ;—but you are still young, very young, Euthanasia ; and fortune yet may have many changes in store for you. Remember, that, through them all, I am your friend ; and if ever in any misery you want a protector, one to save and preserve you, Castruccio, the neg¬ lected, mistaken, but most faithful Castruc¬ cio, will ever be ready to use his arm and his power in your service. Kow, Euthanasia, førewel."
" Oh God I" cried the unhappy girl,moved to her inmost heart, u could you not have spared me this ? leave me ; farewel for ever ! " He kissed her hand, and left her; while she, her delicate frame yielding under the many emotions she experienced, sank almost lifeless oa the couch. She had suffered much, and borne up through all. But this last interview overcame her : her health, which had been weakened by watching, and agitation, and tears, now entirely gave way. A fever fol¬ lowed,—delirium, and utter deprivation of strength. The disease seemed to feed on her very vitals; and death already tainted her cheek with his fingers. But youth, and a con¬ stitution, nourished and strengthened among mountains, and healthful exertions of body and mind, saved her ; and, after a confinement of several months, she again crept forth, to see the sun of spring smile on his children, who laughingly welcomed his genial beams. Where during this time was the prophetess of Ferrara ?

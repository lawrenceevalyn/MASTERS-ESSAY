sooner than enter the roof of hıı foe, when the host recollecting himself, in¬ formed him he might have an apartment, for he had heard the Count say he would pass the night at a kinsman'· of ha, whose castle was .«bout a nule distant, and where hu train, after puting tbe night at the inn, not to incommode hit kinsman, might join him in the morning. The image of his enemy, in a lonely forest, unattended, unprepared, flatbed like lightning on the mind of Montone. I wu beside hun at that moment Нб bid his attendants halt at the inn, and plunged into the forest with blind fury. 1 he storm came on, he saw not who rode behind him m it, he saw not what shape was in the ghastly light that shone round his horse, as 'he heavy sulphur clouds rolled ov er the forest. But I and others were near him—near I—we were above, around, within him. He lurked in a thicket, a duk, matted, briery thicket, n 2 where
where by the glancing of the lightning he saw a cross erected, in memory ot murder recently done theie As he be¬ held it, I heard him groan, and I be¬ lieved my office was rendered void (for a moment), but in the next he heard a voice which made his teeth grind and his flesh shiver, it was the voice of Giróla, desınng his page, who was on foot, and his only attendant, to hold h s torch lower, as the forest track was dark and tangled Montono rushed forwaid, tbe page fled shrieking, and dropt the torch Giróla was afterwards found near the thicket, horribly butchered his skull alone had seven deep wounds in it, as it the hand that struck him was resolved to hunt and extinguish life wherever it might linger Muzio was also found by some messengers from the kinsman s cas¬ tle, and by Giróla s train, bareheaded, leaping, and raving, fot the rage of his revenge had depnved him of rtason , he vi as
was brought back to Naples, tried for the murder, and condemned In prison I was again with him, for human hin- tl ι a n ces are nought to me, he knew me, for his reason returned, and acknow¬ ledged the truth of my intimations.

but one act to be done He felt like one whose fate is already told, and to whom no future discoverv can reveal any object of toil or of solicitude, there was there¬ fore within him a strange passivencss, that yet did not exclude the highest de¬ gree of busy excitement He felt some great event was not to bc wrought, but to be waited for , all the dullness of lin¬ gering expectation was superseded by this great event being as it were placed in contact with his mind, in plate of tumultuous preparation, there was theie fore an earnest awaitment, and amid the moat vigorous mental emotions he pos¬ sessed an entite animal calm When he arose and w ent abroad, and looked around him, those whom he met, and their pur¬ suits, appeared to lini indescribably vague, and trivial, and hollow He men¬ tally wondered how men could be en¬ gaged in pursuits whose attainment was not certam, ot in views whote objects were
were distant and indefinite A million of tunes in that day he said to himself, " How tan these beings exercise sucb alacrity and zeil for they know not what* they cannot see the events of »notbar hour, vet they push on with eagernoi· in their eve and activity in their motion. How dreadfully flat and vacant would such pursuit be to me ' in me the clear and certain view of supernatural disclo¬ sure justifies the utmost energy of mo¬ tion, as well as the utmost patience of expectation ' But when his mind had partly recovered from the glare which this new light had poured on it, and the artificial nearness in which it had placed the objects it disclosed, he began to in¬ qune uhat new light had indeed been pound on his mmd, ot what new object had been diseoicred by Us help * Non E I The intimation of his fate had been con¬ veyed in tue most general terms of doubt¬ ful prediction , something had been re- fealed,
vealed, but without circumstance or c η nection , all that ean prompt niqiurv nr distinguish between our own lonieitiuc intl the information of others, was con¬ cealed But enough had been told to fill the high-minded and romantic Ipjio- hto with dtl.ght while he thought ot it, ín» fate was to be no vulgar one (by the agent emplo}ed to announce it; hc was not to fall with the unknown, nor lie with those that are not lemembcied something great, terrible, oi tragical w as to mark the close of his course Before the day ended he had mentally rehearsed, and compared, and ipplied all the circumstances of high and distin¬ guished endings of life he eould remem¬ ber, calculated what relation the most pro¬ bable of them could bear to the period of his own, and, clothed in tlie агтау of vi¬ sionary heroism, beheld life and death разе before him with indifference Such was his propensity to the romantic and the

Thit I collect fiom his next page, which, though tuffieiently inco¬ herent, informs me he wat engaged to a fete at the villa of tht Countess Verano, near tbe foot of the mountain 'I he villa wat not sufficiently large to contain the numerous company, who intended to ttay for some days, and most ot the ca¬ valiers pasted the night m temporary building· which were scattered through the demeine, furnished with refreshments m the day, and illuminated in the even¬ ing. To one of these Ippohto retired , but the balmy moonlight and air that came mingled like one element through the bowery lattice of his hut, refieshed bun more than sleep, and he arose and feasted silently He had not been long at the window when be thought he saw the figure of a man, whose habit and gesture were ttrange, advancing from the trees, and moving with caution and fear. Whether hu mmd wat fatigued by dissipation,
dissipation οι whether he saw no reaem- blance in this ob|ect to any that might excitt an appiehension, he ol served it and saw it disappear without an inquiry Soon after he retired to bis rustic bed, the lamps had been long extinguished , but the moon shone full through the foliage of the casement, and once accidentally raising his ejes, on thinking that light obstructed, be fancied lie saw the face of a man at the casement, looking in earnestly even this made only a mo¬ mentary impress un on lum, and he was soon asleep W e are utterly the creatures of tune and place, had the day been passed in solitude, bad bis dormitory betn at α distance trom the habitations of others, bad theie been an impression on his minil, like the expectation of some fearful thing, much slighter appear¬ ances would have rouzed him He slept not long, however, he was awakened by a glare of light and a pressure on bis breast,

things, such as crazy superstition, or the howling maniac never dreamed nf ' On Ifpolito's mind, this assemblage of terrible imagery produced no additional effect, he had wound it to a fearful pitch, even to that of all others to our nature the most repugnant, which, lay¬ ing aside all the softnesses and levities of life, prepares to look upon the un¬ clothed and unqualified, and near-brought nakedness of death He said, he felt within him a dark strength, a stubborn and horrid force of mind, as if he were determined to be revenged on any ter¬ rori the discoveries of tbe night miglit prepare for him, by contemning and defying them, for so strong was the impression of the reality and certainty of what was about to be disclosed to him, that he had no more idea of resisting or evading it, than if a voice from hea¬ ven had declared it to him. In this ferocious tullenness, therefore, his mind took
took shelter, and though he endea¬ voured to exchange tt for that resig¬ nation of which he had heard moralists talk, and which lie felt to be the more appropriate feeling of that crisis, yet still the natural resentment of an op¬ pressing force, the native abhorrence of having our liberty abridged, and our path hedged up and carved out for us, (ev en by a superior power, and of the knowledge of whose precise operations our pursuit has been eager and inces¬ sant,) filled him with emotions gloomy, perturbed, and rebellious What were the peculiar rites of this signal night I know not, nor whether the presence of the evil one superseded the attendance of his ministers, who were absent on their goblin devices, but after describing his feelings in lines of which the tremo, ıs yet visible, Ippolito went on to tell me he was left alone and in utter dark ness, in some remote part of this im- 13 mense
mente space, (which he desoñbed ю ft ttrMory unitér ground,) With injunc¬ tions midier to tpeak nor move, hut to see, and to mark what he beheld By wtiat meant he was to see in ntter datt- ne*·, he eoeM »ot conjecture, till at a distance he b-held a small blue flame rise before him, it spread and enlarged gradually, and ascending to a vast height, stood, without any of the flicker- rag or volatile appearance of fire a fixed Had voluminous Curtain of vapour Iti light, though ttrong and distinct, but partially discovered the extent of the vanlt, Ha dusky and ill-defined roof, and thote parts of it whose limits pressed on the edge of the flame, were faintly nsible, into the recesses of deeper •darknesi that spread around lum, Ip¬ polito feh not inclined to bok Mean¬ while, the body of the flame, slowly diminishing and dividing, was sus¬ pended in a luminous arch, within which
which appeared a black reflecting lur¬ face, which filled the whole interval, and which Ippolito compared to a mirror of black marble He gated intently, le¬ verai undefined forms chased each other over the surface, and were loit in the columns that formed it· frame At length, a full distinct form appeared di¬ rectly opposite to him, it wat m a modern garb, the face wat concealed, the get tures indicated diffraction and dismay, Ippolito, as yet unoontciout of the in¬ telligence they were to convey, w»teh- ed its motions fixedly Had tbe figure availed itself of every mode of tpeech and expression, it could not have con¬ veyed more powerfully the idea of a being impelled by a power resistless and invisible, to some deed or object, from which it shrunk, sometimes with humili¬ ty of deprecation, touietunnwitb devices of evaawa, aad аппеснм» with convid¬ amos
tioni of rentrance, still tbe power that acted on it appeared to increase in strength and effect, and its progress towards thit event appeared more rapid ; iti motion· were now most strongly indi¬ cative of fear, irresolution, and reluct¬ ance , like the animals who are said to be within the sphere of fascination, it shi¬ vered, and parleyed, and retreated, every motion a start, and every limb in a struggle of aversion that protracted the misery it endeavoured to shun in vain. At length with a vehement impulse he matched tbe dagger, to which its hand had been often involuntarily directed, and threw it from him with the force of one who wishes to remove from him an object of temptation, and appeared to regard it for some time as a ι espite from internal persecution, but in a short time the influence appeared to operate again, again he appeared 'd make the faint yet desperaţi struggles of one who knows that
that all struggles are bootless With a quivering and yet a straining motion he approached the place where tlie dagger lay, often receding, his feet bore him to the spot, often wincing at the touch, his hand at length grasped it strenu¬ ously, but then all further power or means ot delay seemed to cease llie figure rose severely erect, as if every nerve were forcibly dilated, and the whole man -'retched and wound to a pitch of unnatural eneigy, and then moved away with a motion, which an effort at swiftness, struggling with the waiped and contracted state of the mus¬ cles, rendered frightful Tlie figure and his motions conve} eel one idea so power¬ fully to Ippolito that, on hisdisappearing, he exclaimed aloud, " he is going to mur¬ der some one' Almost as he spake, a cry came to his ear, not like lhe cry of individual agony, but as if all the terrors of a last dying groan were mixed with
with the shriek of thote who look upon •ome direful thibg. Ippolito's hair .Mood ertet at that sound. The figure reappeared, his actions now were the pavingt of detpair, hit garments were •plashed with blood, and he held the dagger with the gesture of one whose horror has rendered him insensible that he holds the witness of his condem¬ nation. A confused sound was then heard, and Several dim figures appeared on the tablet, Ippolito heard the rattling of chaint, mixed With the toll of a bell, and that hunt of preparation which ac¬ companies tome .event of moment, the agoniei of the phantom teemed to re¬ double, and Ippolito instantly compre¬ hended that the puhiMintent of his cr'ntie wat approaching. Γη a short time, figures in the habits of executioners sur¬ rounded fami, in the itrogglei of despair he broke from their gripe, and filling ori hit kneet and itretching out his arms with
with the gesture of oae who addreatci heaven, not to appeal, bui to accuse, the covering fell from hu face, and Mentono darting towards htm beheld hit tan. The figures disappeared, the sheet of blue fire closed over the tablet, and sinking into the floor with a faint his·, expired Ippolito was silent for sonic momenti, from the struggle of feelings that almost suffocated him, at Iengtt rage, and amucment, and horror, found vent in a storm of execration and fury. It is impossible to conceive with what abhorrence his mind, so high-toned, to ambitious, even romantic in virtue, and impracticably rigid in its lystem of ho¬ nour, with what abhorrence it mutt have struggled with the ide« of un¬ dergoing the vilest of punishments for the vilest of crimes. There u a deli¬ cacy too, taught by early luxury, and the indulgences and exemption» of ranlt, that .shrinks from the dtbeuing circum- ъ 3 ilanct*
stances which attend the commission and the punishment of a crime, with as much native antipathy as virtue feels at the crime itself, and which is often a security for the forbearance of evil in minds where the purer principle и absent Ippolito was all outraged, and inflamed, and revolted, and the appear' ance of the stranger, on whose entıance the vault was lit again, only gave his rige an object " Monster," he roared, " was it foi this I was iirawn hither, to be abused by a wizard lie, a damned prediction, which no heavenly power could doom r nor you, nor all your host of fiends, nor Satan himself, could tempt me to realize' Was it foi this 1 watched antl waited, was it for this 1 resigned the peace of my existence, and the wel¬ fare of my soul, that I sought the haunts I .believe of demons, and yielded myself up to you, their leader, thou Archimage, thou Beelzebub, prince of the devils, to

Would I not scardi out and stab with mj sword, my very heart s core, if it could harbour a thought of dipravity ? Had I been represented s'ruggling with an open, armed toe, had I been represented acting in tlie fever of passion, (though even so I could not wound the unprepared,) had it been aught but tins, I would have boiue it, though the perspective was filled with 1 racks
racks and fire But this—what pretext —what device—what excuse'—I have not an enemy on earth , no, by heaven I I am aa void of hatred as I am of fear But why do I linger? Let ine from this cursed den, the very air breathet lies and witchery, I am infected while I stay here, the very consciousness of a crime is steaimg on me, I am tempted to do something vile and guilty, and may all the horrors, the indig¬ nities, tht low sunk eleprav ity I am me¬ naced with, fall on me, if I ever from this night entrr your haunts, or have intercourse of any shape or circum¬ stance, or any pretext or temptation with you or your associates, be they fiends, or impostors, or what they may , nay, if I do not fiom this night re¬ nounce all pursuit or search ot this damned art, that curses alike with sus pente or certainty "—" Go, ' said the stranger, still sternly «aim, "go, and 6 the
the fulfilment of your curie go with you, for from henceforth it ihall tnt seem as if this vault indeed engulplied you, as it your view was bounded by its darkness, and your thoughts filled with its terrors, what you have seen or heard this night shall never leave your mind's eye, wherever you are you shall remember me "—" I will lose my memory first, in drunkenness or madness, I will drink mandragora and opium, I will have a drum beat on my head when tlie thought of you is 'here " — "That is but temporary, you will remeniber me in the hour of your guilt " —" Liar I —" You will remember me in the dungeon "— Ippolito stopt his ears —" You will remember me on the scaffold, and the image of him you have murderedsv.il be scarce more terrible than the image of him you bave belied and spurned.' " The image Cf lum I am to murder I" said
taid Ippolito, who had in vain endea¬ voured to ihut out the deep voice of the stranger, "Where is it' Is it near me''—" It is," replied the unknown, " with myriads of other unclothed embryos of future horror, heie the shapes of things untold are assembled , tpints that tempt, and spirits that pu¬ nish, are here awaiting their task, and bowling for their prey in these tin- travelled 8[»ces You cannot see their form, nor hear their sound as they sweep past you, yet how many are gathered around you now ' For, on this signal night, myriads are assembled to attend their master and mine Ippolito, who was quitting the vault, though he kntw neither passage nor direction, hesitated , hit mind waa in that state when tlic violence of iti agitation is favourable to the most improbable and contradic¬ tory impressions, but m which it always tceks a relief to its distrained and over- v rought
wrought frame in an extreme, and there¬ foie if it deviate from one, ceitainly declines to another At such a moment, the temptation of his habitual curiosity so critically suggested, and tlie near prospect of its gratification, combined with the impression of sincerity, which the stranger s unyielding calmness in¬ voluntarily conveyed to lum, wrought a strange and sudden change in the whole fíame of his ftehngs He re¬ turned slowly, antl faultered out, " Can you indeed shew me the form of him whom I am doomed— ' he could not say to murder " That I know not, ' said the stranger, who during tlıeır con¬ ference had never changed his posture or expression " Unfeeling and un¬ yielding tliat you are, ' said Ippolito, re¬ lapsing into passion, "is this my an¬ swer ' Is this the way you relieve the wretch whom you upbraid for leaving you ' Why should I stay ' You have poured
poured the rato my brain, and poison m my heart, and now when I turn to the oniy resource you have left mc, you mock me with a °old, lingering, doubt¬ ful answer Бу whatever power you terve and fear, I adjure you, adjure you earnestly, terribly, by the convulsions of a broken spirit, by the ruins of a mind which none but you could bow down to weakness, I adjure you, grant me this last, wretched boon, let me grow familiar with the wickedness of my own heart, nor feel these rtvolt- mgi, at if the motions within me were caused by the possession of a demon The stranger ipoke not, moved not, taw not, hit arms were uplifted, Ins head thrown back, tlie whites only of his eyet were visible, and though not a limb moved, the folds of hu garment rote and •pread at if they partook of some inward motion Ippolit ·! o t insensible of what he saw, aad ,4itiessed but by one object,
object, repeated bis importunities with aggravated «vehemence, again and again he grasped the unknown by the arm, and shook his garments, and shrieked his petitton in the agonies of delirious impatience "Away'" groaned a voice, that seemed to come an immeasurable distance, "away 1 lam with my mas¬ ter now, he comes, he comes, where space neither measures nor reaches, through the viewless and the void " Ippolito, inflamed not deterred, only raised his voice, and redoubled his ea¬ gerness , his feelings became frens}, his voltea foar, he supplicated, he menaced, he cursed, he defied with daring pro¬ vocation, the presence of the master¬ spirit, and threatened with extermina¬ tion the stranger, bis ministen, the haunts of their resort, and every agent and instrument of their accursed doings. At this outrage the stranger shivered, and half starting from his trance, looked around
around with a glazed, unawakened eye " Who hath brought h ι in here ' he murmured, " The terror of his pre¬ tence be upon him. ' —" Let them be upon me," raved Ippohto, " let me hav e something to confront and to con¬ tend with , I dare him , lie shrinks from me , let him come , if he be more ter¬ rible than these dens ot liotror have yet tbewn me, if he bc what I can but be¬ hold and die, if he blast my ejes wuh the livid lightning of hell, let him come, I dare him, doet he hear me '' yes, I dare him , let the echoes of his temple bear to him my shout, n>} laugh of de¬ fiance." He burst into - hoind laugh At thete last sounds the stranger shriek¬ ed , hit shriek, so wild and uneaithlike, wa» echoed from a hundred part» of the vault, and all the crowd of s ι ige shapes, and many he had never before beheld, surrounded him in a moment, the cavern rung with their cries, a com¬ motion
motion like an earthquake shook every place and object, self moved lights dai ted through the darkness, a sound like the moans of the dying, borne on the wind of midnight, rose, and increas¬ ing as it spread, filled the vault, till the maddened ear sought in vain the cause ot its torture in the dizzy roar that op¬ pressed it Oh, there is uo telling the terrors of that hour, if a bemg could be supposed to be plunged for a moment into Tophet, aud retain his vital powers and reason, such I believe, would he describe it on his return, if the power of description remained to him I re¬ collect some expressions of Ippolito s which described it with the energy of personal suffering " The very dead forms and characters that were on the walls, at tlus moment came to a horrid state of partial existence, tbey craw led and shuddered with a motion like life, the very reptiles, of size fnd form such as it never
nev« teen in the upper world, seemed endued with a strange contciousnets, aad rote erect some, and some uttered .•Miad, md iome looked and stared with ghaitly lutelhsgence " Amid this кепе what an object must Ip¬ polito have presented, the bold and beau¬ tiful outline of his figure appearing amid the 6m and darkness, and witched shapes of that meeting, his sword drawn, his ha¬ bit thrown back, hue) e and cheek kind¬ ling intofreniy, heightened with the pecu¬ liar wildness of supernatural tenor The itranger awoke from hit trance, he arose, he grasped hit arm, and looking on him with an eye that seemed to see other forms " Come, ' said be, " you Who compel the powers of the night, and ef the nether world, oome with me '— " Swear then, that you will shew me that form, the form of hun who is to make me α villain , if I con but behold him, 1 will tri d«wa sn «attive wretch¬ edness
edness, and resist no more ; «hew me but that form·—" " You shall behold him." —" Lead me then where you will." Again he was led to a space so re¬ mote that it teemed is if the immense extent of this place was suddenly be¬ come doubly immense, yet their mo¬ tion was so quick that the rage and uproar seemed to have ceased at once. No sound was near them, their steps did not seem to emit any, the damp and foggydulness of the coarse medium which could scarce be called air, seemed to ab- ssorb every impression , the single light the stranger bore, did not permit them to penetrate into the thick darkness, more than the arm could extend. They pro¬ ceeded in utter silence, there was a chil¬ ling remoteness from life, within and around them Ippolito liad no consci¬ ousness of any thing, till he found they had stopped and entered a dark chamber, or rather another rude recess m tnese endless
endless passages Some object, dark and muffled, lay m a corner but Ippo- lite s sight had been too long stimulated by glaring and unnatural impressions to regard it " In a few moments said the unknown, " you will be cursed, like the rest of your species, with the fulfil¬ ment of your own wishes, what, in com¬ passion to you, I would have withheld, ï can now withhold no longer The lord of the night, compelled by outrage and defiance, has come, in the fullness of his terrible potency he has come, aud I am forced by that presence to deal with you without the mercy of reserve or delay —"Therefore, said Ippolito with eager weariness, " I pray you be speed} soon let me know what is yet to be done or suffered I tell you I am in the veiy weakness of desperation > Do not there fore speak, for I can no longer hear, my head is hot, and my mind wondrous heavy Let something be done, and quickly
quickly, while I am vet equal to it I could, methinks, grasp at fire, or drink fresh blood, as if I were in the common ways and habits of nature How long this searing of the mind will last I know not, make your tool of me now, I am in your power '—" There is something yet to be done, ' said the stranger draw¬ ing very near him, " to recognize and to propitiate the presence of our master, a deed must be done, a deed without a name, which sounds foully in the ears ot nature Have you not sometime heaid that tlie power with whom we deal re¬ quires the spilling of blood as the tc*t ' —" I have heard of these things be¬ foie, said Ippolito speaking quick and low, and fixing his eyes on a point, ' and the dreams that used to terrify childhood, are they become the acts of the man : those things so dark, so dis¬ tant, are they indeed brought so near to me' Be it so here is my sword, from what
what part are the drops to be drawn that teal this mystery of mtcjuity -' He bared aod held out his arm " Not thac," aaid tlie itranger, " it is »ut that, tlie tacnfice u already prepared, and you are not to be the victim, but tbe one vbo mutt offer it Such victims with us are common , credulity or fear sup¬ plies them every day " As he spoke, he approached that ob¬ scure object, and drew off part of the co¬ vering that concealed it Ippolito beheld a naked human breait, the reit of the bo¬ dy, head, and limbs were concealed in a dark drapery, that fell also over the rude block, on which it appeared extended and fastened as on an altar " Here is the victim prepared, said the stranger, "he cannot fly or resist, he cannot discover or upbraid, the movementa of the dead are not further from the light or know¬ ledge of life than what is done in this vault, here is the weapon,' giving him a small
a small dagger, " strike firm and sure, tlie presence of our master requires this attestiHg act, and all shall then be known."—" Never,'" replied Ippohto, au aking at mire to the keenest and most exalted »ense of feeling and reflexion, " ntvei, idnt futun honors my fate inav prepare for me I know not, nor what dreadful pieparation a goaded mind and a dev Ceil consciousness may steel me with, but while I have sense, andean hold α vu ipon with tin steady hand ot one ubo can aim, in who can forbear, nest, shall such an accursed deed bu done bj nit —" Rash boy 1 ' said the uuLnou n, "you know not what depends on tin, momtnt, you know not whose presenil, makts these insensible walls bui st out in an ominous dew, antl thit pregiai ed taper burn tremulous and blue, jou know not who beholds you now, summoned hither bj the outrage, and uow dismissed with ť capricious ìnfir- \0L in. ι mitv

Whev Annidai still attended by Filip¬ po, arrived at Capua, he learned that his relative resided at Puzzoli, where he had been removed for the enjoyment of a distinguished benefice Disappointed by the delay, and alarmed by the danger of exposure,
exposure, he nevc-theless vvas compelled, by the exigency of lus finances, to pur¬ sue him to Puzzoli with this relative who was his mothers uncle Annibal had from his youth been a fivountc ami what was of greater consequence, his father had long been the reverse in con¬ sequence of some family disagreements both from his fondness and resentment therefore, he hoped for assistance, and, at least, believed himself secure of con fidence and protection He therefore hastened to Puzzoli, and rested on his way at a small town in its neighbourhood, purporting to reich it the following day Slight shocks of the preceding earthquake had been Idt in the country, and a considerable degree of alarm prevailed among the inhabitants, which, as usual, they endeavoured to appease by ceremonies and processions. A tiver, that flowed near the town, had lately undergone such extraordinary changes,
changes, had swoin with sudi sudden violence, and then subsided without any apparent cause, that the people were not only tei r.lied with the expectation ot what these changes indicated, but with the moie obvious dangei it threatened to their lives and h ibitations Annibal, who was shewn ulto a room of the inn which commanded a view of the river, saw not without solicitude and fear the rush of its daık, tui bid waters, sometimes wrought into eddies, and sometimes checked by invisible obstructions, its roar often mingled with other sounds, of which the causes weie unknown, and ita water« flushed with the sullen sanguine hues ot a sun, setting amid the clouds of a gathering storm.

happier for it all their life It is quite a jubilee, I assure you, Signor, only that it occurs somewhat ofteuer, if Provi¬ dence continues to favour us, as it has done of late I expect see scarce a house standing —" You will allow me, however, said Annibal, "to quit yours before so desirable an event occurs, as I should be equally unwilling to prevent or to partake its good fortune Shocked at the man's insensibility, and determined not to augment profits thus iniquitously desired, he quitted the house and wandered towaids the river It wis now nigh' deepened bv the dark ness of a cloudy sky, and Annibal s mind, under the influence of time and place, involuntarily adopted a subject of con gcuial meditation He thought of his strange fate, of events no conjecture could solve and no contemplation could divest ot terror, the precise frame of his mind was critical and dangerous, per- с 3 haps
bap« even more so than his brother's Ippolito wat alwayt accnitomed to act from impui«, Annibal from conviction. But impulse Is more satiable than con¬ viction , and therefore, though Ippolito a emotions were more vehement, his mind WM much more disengaged than his bro¬ ther's. He had no distinct belief of the character of his persecutor, nor any clear impressions of the influence exercised on himself, he had never seriously debated whether it was the production of human or superhuman powers, he resisted it merely because it was painful and atro¬ cious , instead of bending his mind to discover wh'ther he was the victim of imposture or the agent of destiny, he expended his energiei in tallies of rage and convulsions of resistance Into the sdeeper mind of Annibal, one conviction had radically wrought itself, that of his being visited by the inmate ot another world What relief he had enjoyed un¬ der
der this terrible impression was merely local and furtive, produced by chuge of place and vicissitudes of action, vio¬ lent and sudden but the impression re¬ mained slumbering, but not extinct, ready ,o resume its force and character whenever the cause that had produced it should recur Il-nce, while Ippohto was almost in despair, his very violence of nature formed a secunty against the ob¬ ject he dreaded, as poison is often ex¬ pelled by the convulsions it produces ; while Annibal, whose tranquillity seemed almost unimpaired, nourished an unsus¬ pected tendency to the very deed, from whose remote apprehension the frame of his mind flattered lum with a treacherous immunity He walked alone His mental debate, which occupied some hours, might be reduced to the following propositions " I have seen a departed spirit, an inha¬ bitant ot those legions which are invi¬ sible to man, I cannot resist the evi¬ dentes
dences of his appearance and ministry , I draw them as much from the circum¬ stances that preceded and followed as from those that accompanied it There was a regularity of disposition, a subor¬ dination of patts, a progress uf dev elope ment, which indicate the agency of an intelligent being, and if intelligent cer¬ tainly not human He prompts me to a crime, revolting to nature and fatal to my own life, reputation, and perhaps immortal interests I have resisted him, fat it requires no debate to reject evil so positive and heinous, I have resisted him hitherto, but who can tell how long he may resist a being whose powers are the powers of another world ' nay, who can tell how far he is right in resisting him í Distance of place has in a mea sure relieved me from this persecution, but should he pursue me where I am fly¬ ing, 1 teel I have no further resource, no remaining powers of defence, the evi¬ dence

He found, accord- tog to hu hott s account, multitude» •tiembled, and multitudes moie assem¬ bling,

Annibal was drawn along by the crowd, and learned among them that tbe Abbess and her train were to come from a neigh¬ bouring convent, with relics ot peculiar virtue , that they were to be met at the entrance of tbe town by the religion» orders
orders who inhabited it, and that both were to march with united forces to the very brink of the^nver, and pronounce a solemn interdiction-* of its further outrages. Annibal, who was a good Catholic, believed his mind would be refreshed, as well as his senses delighted, by this act of religion, and therefore wil¬ lingly mingled in the crowd, amused even by the preparations for the ceremo- ay, by the murmur and concourse of •o vast к multitude, over whose visages, tinged with vinous shawdowings of con fidenceand fear, the torches by which they were »een, flung an expression wildly animated and pu turesque Through the darkness of the night he could see distinctly the lights that twinkled from the Convent, and often he listened to catch the chaunt of their solemn «ei vice, as the low, intermitted gale breathed past him, but could only hear the roarings of the river, which filled up the hushed murmurs
murmurs of the crowd, with a sound strange and deep, at length a bell from the convent, which was caught and answered by those in the town, gave signal tint the procession had set nut 1 he crowd pressed forward to meet antl join it and Annibal was borne on by the iest It was marked by every circum¬ stance ot fantastic splendour, by which the unhappy inmates of a convent try to diveisify hopeless monotony, and employ the talents which are denied their pro- |ier and social exercise All the wealth ol the convent was displayed, several nuns were a.raved in the habits and (haracters of those whose relics they bore The Abbess herself, assisted by four lay sisters, supported an enormous 1 lece ot tapestry, embroidered with the life of their patroness, St Ursula, whose figuie m wax, larger 'han the lite, and blading with jewels followed in the rear of her own atchievements But the multitude
multitude forgot every other object when the procession closed with a figure, such as their eyes never befoie lud beheld it «as a lay-sisttr habit d is the genius of martyrdom and bluing a relic of more value than the whole wealth of the convent, it was the head of St. Catharine, which by particular providence had found its «av from Alex¬ andria, where it had been stvered from her body, in the reign of the tyrant Maximm, to Italy Ihis »nut had a special antipathy to inundations and earthquakes, which she took care to manifest in so spirited α m inner, that the river had upon all fonner occasions paid the highest defeience to her hy¬ drophobia, by instantly retreating to its natuial current This inestimable relic, set in gold, and placed in a crystal case, never had attı acted the attention ot the faithful so little They hung upon, they blessed, they almost uor- shippcd
shipped tlie beautiful representative of martyrdom She was placed aloft, oa а саг of curious construction, it wa* entirely compoied of rackj, croises, and instruments of deatli and torture, woven with such skilful intricacy at to preserve their distinct forms, and yet form a spa¬ cious vehicle, at due intervals imps of temptation and punishment were peeping at the genius with faces of ugly malig¬ nity, and derisive grimace, bhe ttood in the centre of tbe machine, in tha attitude ot trampling on the terrible apparatus, on winch she cast from time to time looks of contempt, such as the serenity of angelic beauty may spare. A robe ot white floated round her like a cloud, one hand held the head of St. Catharine, the other waved а Ы aneli of aniaunth, her locks were wieuhed with a coronal ot palms, and her eyes were upturned to a resplendent figure, which, bending from the canopy of purple, ex¬ tended
tended to her a crown of gems, and pointed her view to heaven Her form breathed immortality, her vestments seemed to emit light as they moved on a face pale with early confinement ud habitual sorrow, the murmurs of adoration, the awakened consciousness of beauty, and the enthusiasm of re ligious drama, had kindled a radiance that eeemed borrowed from the regions her view was directed to The faithful felt their devotion exalted, and the libertine was converted, as they beheld her By a singular chance her faee was concealed from Annibal as her car passed the spot where he stood He was again borne on by the multitude, who hastened to tbe river, on the bank of which the religious orders were already assembled, the so¬ lemn stound of their chaunting mixing with its roar, and their line of da к forms, so diversified by the shadowy picturi ngs of torch light, here heaped in
ιιι tumultuous darkness, and there flash¬ ing out in abrupt and fantastic light, that the eye sought in vain for a resemblance to known or common objects, and struggled to believe itself in the regions of life After praver and hymn, the various relics were exposed, that of St. Catharine was r served for the last At length the genius descended, and through crowds that prosti ated them¬ selves before her in doubtful devotion, advanced to the brink of the river After a short prayer she exposed the sacred head to the waters, and «a\ I it with a gesture of inspiring command At that moment, the night and the dark surfate of the waters weie swept bv a glare of sudden light, a meteor low hung ind lurid passed ov er the up¬ turned visages of the multitude and disappearing in the darkness, left a train of bluish sparkles behind The crowd, in the joy of confidence, believing it to 7 be
be a signal of divine acceptance, bunt into a shout of triumph, and the genius, flushed with the radiance of inspiration, turned to accend her car, wi'li a step tsbat seemed to discard the earth Her veil floated back with the elevation of her motion, Annibal beheld her fac·?, without a shade or interruption, it was the face of Erminia, the original of the picture cherished by fantastic passion, and preserva without a hope ot dis¬ covery Carried beyond himself, he nished through the crowd, he called on her in a voice the murmur of thousands could not suppress, he addressed ber in alternate rapture and awe, he invoked her as an angel of light, and supplicated her as the beloved of his heart The crowd, incensed and astonished, col¬ lected round him m numbers, which he strove to break through in vain, but still he «ontended, expostulated, and mtreated, and holding out the p'c- 6 ture
ture, bid them behold a resi'Jesswitnessof the truth of his passion, and the identity of its object The crowd still surround¬ ed and repelled, but he still spoke with more vivid tloquence, more animated passion, foi ¡ie could perceive, at this moment, that the object he adJressed, amid the pomp of procession, and the triumph almost of deification, had paus¬ ed, and beheld him with a look in which surprize «as quite unmixed with anger Fmboldtned, he burst from the crowd with sudden strength, and implored lier but to pause, but to listen His story was wild, but true, he had seen her picture where she had perhaps never been He had devoted his heart to the resemblance, and his life to the pursuit of her, he had unexpectedly, miracu¬ lously found her, and again he poured out before her, in tones no woman could hear i.ninove.l, his passion, heightened by visionary feeling, and romantic dis¬ covery But
But at this moment the murmurs of the crowd, and the angry inter ference of the ecclesiastics, were lost in an universal roar of hoiror and ι rush of sudden flight, that, like the torrent it shunned, bore every thing be fore it The river, with no physical cause, but subte. raucous and invisible convulsions, suddenly rose w uh the rage of a tempest, and bearing down bank and mound, poured a waste of watery ruin on every side There is a daikness of distress a helplessness of resisttnce an obscurity of fear, in the d lead of perishing by water, suchas are not found in even more terrible modes ot destruc tion, but here, where safety was ob structed by multitudes, and the hoirors of desolation were aggravated by recent triumph, where the eye dreaded even darkness as danger, and the foot knew not in what element its next step would be plunged, the confusion and terror weic
vi ere beyond all power of descuption, and Annibul telt himself huined into in¬ voluntary safety «hile his ejes were yet strained to discover the situation of her, to pt risii w ith whom was the only thought ot the moment The torrent of flight, however, which he resisted in vain, never ceased till hc «as almost in the cen're of the town, where the bed nd and diseased were at that moment la¬ menting their absence from a ceremony from winch thty never could have escaped vuth life Here the crowd paustd tobe assured of thtn safety, and Annibal taking advantage of the first poner ot voluiuirj motion, hastened hack ti the spot which he feared he would now visit in vain He was often obstructed bv groups of fugitives, who still ian, though they were far from dan¬ gei, but when he came neai the brink of the viatei, which uas now extended to the suburbs of the town, all was vol in и deso-

He arose, he felt lus limbs stiff and drenched, but capable of motion, he felt his way before him, antl his hinds touched walls that were damp anil stony , he called aloud, but his voice w ıs re¬ pressed, as if by low roofs and a con¬ tracted space.

At every place where I resided, I was indeed told of · friend by whose directions my lite was managed, but whom I was never to see this friend I was exhorted to conciliate bv silent reve¬ rence and remote submission I felt lit¬ tle complacency towards an invisible be¬ nefactor, by whom I was supported just above indigence, and hurried about from place to place without any communica¬ tions of affection or confidence At length I was tome years ago placed In this convent, where I was told at my entrance I must prepare to take the tows, and seclude myself from the world for ever. Sohtude and ignorance had left me little power of choice, and little temptation to resistance. At first, there¬ fore, I beard this with little reluctance, but и I grew np, strangt visions floated b-foie
before me, ofthat world which I was to resign without ha/mg known Some¬ times I delighted to imagine the world & region whose gales breathed felicity, and whose soil poured forth roses sponta¬ neously, whose inhabitants melted in bowers of balm, or sparkled in palaces of amethyst, and sometimes it appeared to me as in the daik dreans of that vi- sioned night, every hand armed with the weapon of blood, and every visage flashing the flames of hell' Yet even over this picture of terrors »as shed a light of romantic splendour and wild adventure, which, modified as it was by length of time and weakness of childish perceptions, left on my mind an impres¬ sion nf curiosity, mingled with awe, in- 1 deed, but not remote from desire Whe¬ ther my meditations on the world were just or not, the result was a determina¬ tion not to quit it thus ignorant and in¬ curious I communicated my resolution t·
to my abbess, who heard me with a burst of indignation, which when I had suffered to past over, I found her arguments not «pally forcible. I resisted lui, there¬ fore, respectfully but tenaciouslj When she wu weary of contendi ig with one ahe could neither convince nor punish, the wrote to this person whom she represented u the arbiter of my fate, aad u hate interference she looked on as irrciiitible Her appeal was followed by a haughty command to take the veil, Without opposition, which would only prove the impotence of my contumacy, and the imbecility of my helplessness.

His de¬ spondency increased every moment, and I ilippo, vvho at first pretended to be his (ounsellor, had now little business but to watch his locks silently in the da) r and count his groans sleeplessly all night.

Не paused—all vvas still He repeated it in a ν oice tremulous with disappoint¬ ment, antl a light vibration, (low and brief as a sigh.) of Ildelonsa's well- known maudoline, came to his ear, fill¬ ing him with confidence and joy His récognition of this signal was without doubt or ftai, for he had htaid bis mas¬ ter say, that Ildefonsa was the only inmate within the walls that touched the mandoline He rose jo} fully, and was quitting the chapel without disturbing the old nun, to learn the success of her second conference with St Ursula, when a sound near him arrested his steps He knew not to what direction to refer it, it seemed that of a human voice, vet it issued from under his feetl He listened—" There was no sound, said a voice from beneath the slnme, "it was fancy , the chapel is empty. —" Then let us ascend, ' said a female voice, "ior I am suffocated with these damps Is }Our

In the mean time Filippo hasted to his master, he informed lum of the supposed machinations ¿of the abbess, be did not conceal from lum the presence and agency of Schemoli, he averred it bis belief that the Signora Ildefonsa did exist, though he feared it was determined she should not exist much longer. All personal interference was now fruitless, as he would probably be excluded from the walls of the con¬ vent, but as the following night was assigned-for the celebration of htr lime¬ rai·, at which strangers would of couise be present, he advised Annibal to repair thither with the officer who had brought the Bishop's order, to state the circum¬ stances which had occurred, and of which he (Filippo) would avow himself a witness, cover the abbess with confu¬ sion, and interest the spectators and the ecclesiastics in the restitution of Ilde¬ fonsa. Every thing indeed, that cou¬ rage or ingenuity could propose, was 1 anti·
anticipated in the advice of Filippo, which Annibal prepared to adopt, with a lieart he wu delighted to feel beating with human passions once more Tbe funeral ot a sister ot the Ursuhne convent was always attended with pc- cubai solemnity, from the abbess s wish to impress strangers who were permitted to attend it, with an opinion of the sanctity of her letreat, as well as to spiead over the miuds of the inmates a deeper shade of religious awe and sub¬ mission The office was to be performed in the chapel at midnight two houn before which every avenue was filled by strangen, among whom Annibal and his attendants found no difficulty in mingling His spirits were solemnly touched , tlie idea of Ildefonsa asso, ciated with the persuasion and imagery ot death, (though from death he be¬ lieved her tuffieiently distant,) the gliding steps, the dim light, and the low
low requiem, repelled the tumult of expectation, and stilled and saddened lum While the crowd were examining the devices with which the passages ot the chapel were arrayed, Annibal, from an upper arcade, beheld a group of nuns assembled round the bier, which stood in the centre of the chapel Ihe tapers were not yet lit, but a torch burned dimly at the foot of the bier, shewing the pale e ν an id forms of the sisters, who from time to time breathed the low, lulling tones «hich compose the othe e for the dead, and which were soon to mingle with the chantings of the choir and the rich thunders of the organ Annibal, visionary by nature, and mela ι choly from habit, listened, entranced m sadness, and almost wished himself lapped in the deep rest w Inch was sooth- eel by tlie breathings of such holy har¬ mony Of Ildefonsa, even it he possessed her, he dreaded his possession would not Le

Tlie prior advanced, and informed him is conduct and expressions had been so extraordinary, that he conceived it his duty as a churchman, to take cogni¬ sance of them He then commanded his attendants to secure and guard hnn. On the unhappy prisoner, neither his ad¬ dress, not the consequent movements ap-

Irom time totime he uttered the word», " See where he glides away, ' to tlie great terror of his guard, w hom hc how ever made no attempt to iesist Terror, disastrous passion and di» appointed rcvenpe, had indeed impaired his reason, but his madness via» without violence, for his strength was exhausted The remaining rites of sepulture ueic hastily concluded, the crowd, still mm muring with wonder and doubt, dis peiscd, and the prior recollecting that in the ruined town, tliere was now no place to secure the prisoner, consulted with the abbess, who agreed that he »bpuld remain secured in some »uter apartment of the convent, and watched by the attendants. There was little nied uf security, Annibal remained calm and passive, but from time to time, uttered words, which, had bis hearers been ac quainted
quainted with the late eventi of his life, would have suggested ideas more ter¬ rible than the outrage of a convent; but terrified by the ramblings of de¬ lirium, which some interpreted at pos¬ session, and some as prophecy, hit guards, one by one retired, each al- ledging the departure of the last as a reason for his own, and each dreading as he uw a companion retire, that he would be left alone with the maniac It was solitude, silence, and dullness that recalled Annibal to his reason He was m a deserted room that had once been the sacristy, the pale, taint tight of the moon almost setting, fell through mist and haze, on a narrow window. Annibal for а moment recollected the events ot the night, and then, in the contusion of returning sense, endeavour¬ ed to exclude them by shutting hu eyes ; for the late pnvation of reason had been accompanied with imperfect viiita, and tol ut ι he
he wnhed to retire for shelter to in- stemibihty again It wat impossible, every thing recurred with a force more viva] than reality, and again he started up to prevent the attendants from car¬ rying the Ыег of Ildefonsa to the vault. He found himself in a lone and narrow apartment, the door of which was se¬ cured, but from without he thought he beard whispers u of men in con¬ sultation He now implored release or information respecting the ftrte of II defanı·, by every topic that he thought could operate on companion or fear, and in every tone of passion, from the whis¬ perings of »upplication, to the hoarse, broken, inarticulate roar of rage and nen ace. He procured neither freedom nor an¬ swer, anal at length feeling his brain agata unıettle, ,and dreading the loss of nason at the extinction of his sole mean· øt hope, he retwabtd to a .seat, aad
and hiding hts head in the folds of his mantle, and pressing Ins temples firmly with his hands, he tried to exclude the forms that were every moment enlarging in size, and quickening in motion before him, and to breathe a broken prayer fi.r the prtserv ation of Ins reason He grew calmer, but when he ventured to look; up, he again mistrusted tlie faithful¬ ness of his senses Every object around 'uni scemtd in motion, and the blue and shadowy light quivered so fit¬ fully and wild, that a kind of fan¬ tastic animation seemed to pervade the very walls and cieling Again he closed his eyes, but the motion was palpable, for though" he could no longer see any object, he felt the seat shak ig under hım Before he could rise, he heard the bells of the convent pealing out with that confused and dolorous sound, that the wretched inmates of countries visit¬ ed by earthquakes understand but too L 2 welL
well The thought of perishing without a struggle was horrible Again he rush¬ ed to the door, and implored to be at least allowed a chance for life, which in that hour of horrors is not even denied to the most abandoned cor ict in his dungeon He implored in vain, his cries, eyen to his own ears, were drowned in the increasing tumult and distraction ot the convent. He heard, indeed, many voices, but none that answered lum, he heard steps passing close to his door, and some even tliat faultered as they passed, but they faultered fıom the terror of tlıeır own flight, and though they echoed his с es with mvoluntaiy im¬ pulse, the} yet seemed not to hear them At length a crash was heaid, which seemed like the toppling of the whole structure, and the next moment a mass •f ruinous building falling against the door ef Aanıba) s prison it was shattered to atoms, and through tbe chasm he beheld

He groped on in cautious and breathless fear, till the dread that he was only treading the same dark cir¬ cle, the dread that he was plunged into an abyss, over which was heaped a moun¬ tain of ruin no hand could ever remove , the dread that he must wander in dai k- ness, uttering cries that must never be heard, and imploring aid that never could reach him, till he must suck the dank and flinty ground in the madness of thirst, or gnaw his withering flesh for food,—the dread of this rose like a burn¬ ing tide of agony in his throat; and stnding forth a cry that might make it¬ self ht heard, even amid the uproar of that
that night, he sunk on the ground. He sprung up again, for his crv was plainly * repeated by other sounds than the echoes of the vault ; again it was repeated, and Annibal, to whom even the imaginary tenant of darkness would scarce have been an unwelcome visitant, called aloud and repeatedly, and springing on one foot, listened with every faculty on the stretch Again he heard a voice so dis¬ tinct, so well known, so unhoped for, that, bewildered and laughing with con¬ vulsive joy, he said to himself, ' It is impossible, it is illusion, it is a sleight of the enemy ' Oh ' when will the cool, clear light of the morn come, and all this vanish ?" He was answered in tones he could no longer misunderstand, " It is, it is I, stir not, move not a step, I must approach in daikness , but stir not limb, or (oint, or thought, till you feel my hand in yours ' Again believing his senses failing, he closed his eyes it was foitunate

distant shrine, and strewed with tbe re¬ lics and emblems of the dead, he looked around in vain for relief or for hope Ildefonsa s eyes wandered, and her hps were pale, but she was yet capable of conveying her meaning by gestures, aud now pointing vehemently to the left, Annibal bore her thither, still carrying the torch, and still looking around with¬ out a glimpse of deliverance 1 he direction to which she pointed ap¬ peared only more dark and rugged than that they quitted, but as he advanced (the torch btinungdimly from the damps of the vault) a faint blue light seemed to hover in the distance lit stopped and gazed, Ildefonsa murmured an audible sound of encouragement The light became more distinct it issued through an apeiturc in tht root ot the vault, which here was so low, that Annibal was compelled to bend as he approached it A fragment ot something lesembling a piece of drapery floated

It was a hut rudely built of sods, ce¬ mented by the intertwisted roots and fo¬ liage of the verdure with which they were covered, and roofed with wicker, over which tbe trees that surrounded it liad thed a profuse covering of leaves. They were not surprised to see it yet standing, for they knew that slight structures often survive those shocks which overturn pa¬ laces. " This," said Ildefonsa as they supported her into it, and strewed tluir vests over the bed of moss on which they placed her, " this was the habitation ot' a recluse. His habits were solitary and gloomy ; the peasants believed him a being conscious of some great crime, or engaged in some daik pursuit. They dreaded to approach his hut while In mg , he has been dead some days, and tin ir reluctance to visit it is probably greatei. Hete we are safe, for superstition secures us from every intruder. " Annibal groaned incredulously. The care

The intelli¬ gence of lilippo corresponded with their conjectures. Annibal was supposed to have perished in the fall of the tower which had freed him, no suspicion of his escape exuted Of Ildefonsa he had heard nothing, but the same opinion respecting her prevailed iu the convent, for the monk who was employed to assassinate her, dreading the rage of Schemoli and the abbess, averred that she had perished by the blow he gave her as he fled , and as the convulsions of the eaith had ra viged
vaged even the subterranean apartments of the convent, breaking up vaults and overthrowing shrines, the disappearance of her corse excited neither surprise nor suspicion Seated now amid compara¬ tive abundance, while Annibal saw or hoped he saw the wan cheek of Ildefonsa grow »arm in the ruddy light, and Fi¬ lippo, with characteristic vivacity, laugh¬ ed, shouted, and bounded round his master and the Signora (for no influence could prevail on lum to sit or partake the meal with them), each of them re¬ counted the extraordinary circumstances under which they had again met, after being separated by the rudest shocks of both natural and moral violence '1 hc escape of Annibal has been already rclai"d, that of Ildefoma (who after being preserved from assassination by Ippolito, was afterwards separated from him by the shock of an earthquake; was ow ing to the numerous subterranean pas¬ sages

The evening was passed in congratula¬ tions on their marv ellons escape, m anti¬ cipations ot future security and hajspmess, and by Annibal in regret that his brother had been so near, unseen by him, and had probably perished in the disastrous com¬ motion of the night This regret was in¬ creased by a disappointed wish of meet¬ ing and conferring with Ippolito, between the cause and object of whose persecution and bis own he began to trace a resem¬ blance, pregnant with singular suspi¬ cious lilippo promised, if possible, to procure some intelligence of him in his next excursion , and Annibal then retir¬ ing to the porch of the hut, left Ilde¬ fonsa, with unprompted delicacy, to the sole possession of her humble apartment As Ildefonsa's wound was slight, and her w eakness
weakness local, she recol ered rapidly , and tlie assiduous tenderness of Annibal was aided by the vivacious intelligence of Filippo, who related with strong hu¬ mour the conjectures of the superstitious villagers about Annibal and Ildefonsa, of w host disastrous passion they imagined that the figures seen dimly ou the brink of the liver were a visionary representa¬ tion , and they bod more than the praise of common courage who would vintine at night near llie spot where the shade ot the ill fated v otaress was suppostd to seek the sanctuary of consetrated iest, and that of her tempter to be w afted dovi n the current in a baik into which he wis inviting her ind whose progiess traded the waters w ,η furrows ot flame Ot Ippolito, lilippo faded to procure any intelligence, at he had bwn appie- hended immediately on Ins arrival at Puzzoli by the order of the Inquisition, aod the secrecy vi hich η arks the pio ceedings

Her feelings, delicate, vivid, and evanescent, resembled the Pert of the eastern mythology, whose .subtle essence is subsisted by perfumes, and whom a grotter aliment than the fra- g'ince of flowert would confound and destroy barly in the evening of tbe day previous to their departure, Filippo, who had exerted more than uiual dih- geace, arrived at the hut of the forett, with
with eveiy requinte for their journey He had engaged horses and a guide whom they were to meet in the morning it the ikirls of the wood , and wuh the natural joy of a domestic, who bilicves where there is splendour thete must bc «afety, he described the munificent aftic- tion and superb pal ice ot the prior, w line he expected soon to bihold them blazing m magnificence and fortified by power, .scarce remembering the mischief· of v ul¬ gar malignity at the distance to which they were removed, and dispensing par¬ don or punuhment to tbe wretches from whote dungeons they had recenti} emerg¬ ed themselves. Annibal and Ildefonsa listened to hu sanguine promises with confidence, tempered by remembered sut fenngi, and satisfaction, exalted by the benevolence of mutual passion " And •hall we, taid Ildefonsa, "remember the hut that sheltered us in the forest, and the cluster of pine under which we met Ш

When Annibal's senses returned, he found himself extended on a bed. He looked round, he was in a low, mean apartment, dimly lit; it was night; a lamp burned near him, and as he dis¬ tinguished objects, he thought he saw a dark form moving in the distance. Nothing was plain or palpable either to his
his mind or senses , he felt as if a motion, a breath would dissnlv с the objects around him, and plunge him again into insensi¬ bility, or the darkness and dreadful ima· gery of the foiest But when he recog¬ nized the figuie which advanced on hear¬ ing bun move, and stood fixedly beside him, be dashed down his head, and hid¬ ing it m all the coverings he could catch, exclaimed, " Let me be lost again |v His persecutor, however, would not suf¬ fer lum torelapse into insensibility Cor¬ dials were piepared, and when they failed an irresistible stimulant was apjihed He mentioned the name of ildefonsa, and Annibal instantly started up, quickened to the most keen and vivid perceptions of misery But to awake (ft satisfy in· quines on the subject of Ildefbnea was not the purpose of the tempter, he only mentioned Aei"to introduce the prediction concerning their ill-fated loves (whicli he had uttered in the garden of the Ursu- line

"Yet," said the tempter, " if to .esiit the laws of dettiny be innocent." Their conference contiined »11 night It appeared from several .passages of it, that мисс lut fint viaitt to tbc convent where
where Ildefonsa resided, he had been incessantly haunted by Schemoli in his usual and undisguised form He met him near the convent, he crossed him in hi» evening wandeimgs, he even ap¬ peared in hit chamber at the house where he lived, ever upbraiding him with Ins way« ard and foolish flight from what it was equally impossible to avoid or to destroy, ever maddening hnn with the suggestion of that subject so dark and horrible, which had been the topit ot their conferences in the prison cbambci at Muralto Annibal s dejection (visible both to Ildefonsa and Filippo) had kept pace With his gloomy acquiescence in the belief of an influence exerted over him, with which fo contend was dike impos¬ sible and impious 'Низ dtjettiun he had eminently bet ^ed in his last ton· ference with IMefonsa m the garden of Ae convmt, when he repeited to her a prediction with which his shadowy toi- mentor
mentor had menaced him but an hour before He had also betrayed u when Ildefonsa pressed hnn to wander into the forest, for ra the forest he had beheld his persecutor, and in the forest he had again been tempted to that crime, whose imaginary burden sat so heavy on his soul All the predictions of evil were now verified, and the objects whose pre¬ sence had suspended the powers of his inind from dwelling on the subject per·· petually obtruded on it, were now re¬ moved He had no longer any powers of resistance or disbelief, he saw before lum a bemg who, he had every reaion to believe, had a power and commission not to be disobeyed Poison could not suspend his existence, nor distance of space his agencv His tale, to a super¬ stitious mmd enfeebled by recent cala¬ mity, was irresistibly imposing, and hi* injunctions, horrible as they were to na¬ ture, were justified by his tale. Annibal s 1
Annibal's mind wu indeed naturally ■trong, and sluggish in itt operations, but itt strength wu misapplied It pur¬ sued visionry and falsehood with tbe eonscientiout energy of truth, and when it had found it, embraced and adhered to it with a vigorous tenacity that might have honoured virtue Thus be was be¬ trayed by his very virtues The stern activity of his intellect had only been employed in the acquisition of dangerous principles, and his unbending firmness of heart only insured that the blow he struck would be unerring, whether its impulse «u derived from vice or from virtue Such wu Annibal in his best hours, but now, enfeebled by bodily fuffering, distracted by mental pain, his superstition aggravated by his conscience, and his primitive and intimate bias of mind confirmed by external impressions, such aa the soberest intellects could hardly oppose, he yielded without resist¬ ance
ance of reason, but not without struggles ot passion potent and terrible The last tonvulsions of the human mind, the dis¬ solution ot the moral pi imiple, the utter abdication of the influence of reason, while her power is retained only to abuse it, the frightful misrule of passion, as¬ sumed as a principle and exalted into a virtue, this it cannot be expected to ex¬ hibit, and if expected, it is not possible Those dreadful revolutions of the mental system oftener occur in silence, rarely express themselves by groans or gestures, and if they ever employ words, they are only exclamations and inarticulate cries of passion, such as nothing but reality can faithfully represent, and if really re¬ presented, would be fled from in horror The unhappy young man yielded ! ------- But when he had yielded, he exclaimed in agonv, " If there were but a parallel ııı the history of human nature for mine, if there were but another human being like
like me beset, and lost like me, I would not utter л murmur' —"'l here ıs," said Schemoli. " It is impossible," said his victim. " I will produce him tu you, ' said Schemoli. "It ts impossible," re¬ peated Annibal. " He n your brother," said bcbemob. A long pause succeeded this tremen¬ dous disclosure, during which Anni¬ bal's mind, traversing the distant and connecting the remote, arrived at the conclusion which a meeting with his brother might have long ago supplied. He rose from the bed on which be had been tossing in agony. "Who, then, are you ΐ answer, while I hav e breath to ask you—answer, who are you " '— "I am the stranger »f tht vault ! I am the spirit of tht prison chamber of Muralto ' ' —" And my brother!'—" His course has been parallel with yours, and its ter¬ mination will be tbe tame.' —" Was this the deed to which he was fated "-"— " It was,"— "And has he consented-"—" Let hunself
himself tell you, said Schemoli quitting the apartment Annibal did not seek to employ the intetval ot his absence in recollection, for be was now in a stale of mind in whaob яС tion was ini|iossible and so¬ litude insupportable Had I|ipobto been disclosed to bun in a blaze of light¬ ning, r been dashed at his ftet by a whir' ind, it would scarce have drawn fiom linn an exclam ition In a few moments Scnemob returned, accompa¬ nied by Ippolito It was Ippolito, but what a change ' Annibal, who had be¬ held him but a httle before he set out for Naples, in tbe richest glow of beauty and flush of enjoyment, now beheld him a skeleton, meagie, keen, and fiery, the verv image ot spirit wasting and prejing on the ruins of matter Grsry hairs weie profusely scattered amid his bright locks, and α wild, restless fire wandered in his sunk eje They looked at each other without speaking fot some time, bul Schemoli
Schemoli perceiving the dawn breaking through the narrow windows, hastily closed them, secured the door and trim¬ ming the lamp, retired, after having ex¬ cluded every gleam of day I '"· The two brothers wtre It "Jee, there »ere no starts of passion, no sallies ot tragic violence, they were beyond them now no two men of this world, sitting down to confer on their joint business in the cold terms of life, ever discussed it more dispassionately They now discover¬ ed what might have been discovered long before, lhat under d.ftei-nt forms and trains of suggestion, they had been led by the same hand and to the same point But thu discovery suggested no fear or hopt of deception, the smglt exertion of tuch powei* appeared be /ond the reach of man, united, therefore, it was an evioence that the being who exerted them could not bc human Ippolito repeated to his brother the circum-
circumstances thst had occurred to him since bis quitting Naples " On the daj, saidhe, "that I was visited hy the stranger, as I have called him, in the prison of the Inquisition, in Puzzoli, an earthquake shatteied to atoms the tower in which I was confined, and libe¬ rated me At that time I would have liaped into fire, water, earth, to have esca|ied from him 1 am not so weak now as to believe that mortal elements can piutect me fiom lum I sprung out upon а mole which extended from the island rock, upon whicl the pi ison stood, half the surviving inhabitants of the town were crowded on it, embarking in vessels, barges, any thing that would bear them from the land I leaped on board the first I saw, it was a small trad¬ ing vessel bound to Sicily Tlie steps of a fugitive, and tbe looks of a madman, were no wonder and no disqualification in that hour of distraction I had money, too,
too, u I tince found, for I scattered it lut night among a group ot pilgrims who were going to beg absolution for one of their body who had committed a murder I As I sprung cn the deck, the last words of the stranger rung in my ears. ' Bury yourself under a mountain, and it shall roll back from you ' rush to the tetan, and it shall throw you on the shore again ' plunge into the giave, and the grave shall break up and resign you to your fate ' We stood out to sea, I paced the deck all night, I knew not the omens which the seamen knew I saw them pale and shivering, and asked tbem what they feared, since they had left the enemy behind ? and forgot their answer, if they did answer me As I stood among them, a ball of fire settled en the stern, where it glowed blue, and red, and white, and then gliding down tlie dedu, duappeared without singeing a rope. The tailor· shook their heads, the
the surface of the sea was dark and still. It was now night, but we could distinctly heir the cries of destruction from the shore, they could, they said, and many ι disti at ted soul on board echoed the imaginai у wad of father, and wife, and child I heard but one voice, it was that whith spake to us pist now. The wind fell, we became quite be¬ calmed A luminous sheet spread over the surl.ice ot the sea, whose particles looked solid and distinct, and spai kling like stai s ι rope Ict into the waters was ılı awn up shipping with liquid fire The passengers lientling over the sides said they saw strange things in the deep, wrecks of ships long lost, and shapes of others tliat were to be, and forms that lay like dead men at the bottom, and others that beckoned to them with blue swoln fingers, and called on them in voices hke the roaring of waters. I looked also, and saw nothing but the recenet of the vault, the
the damned flitting of its impy forms and the bloody heaving breast, and the eternal dagger I could look no more. There came a sound upon the waters, not like thunder, for it was more terrible, it seemed as if its force alone rent the mast and sails, for they fluttered aiound us in fragments 1 hi v esst 1 flew before it like a gossamer upon a summer l.ree/t I f stopped , the ocean tossed and lieav cd, and its whole bottom came surging up, with tides of sand, and surf, and vt reck, and bodies that had lain there routed in the bed of ages, things tbat dreamt of rest till dooms day, they rose whn ling above us, mixing with the strife of upper air a chaos ot elementary wrath and ruin, then pouring down, deluged us with titles of solid fire, and melted stones, and boil mg sand, aud sulphurous rain Ί tic vessel half on fire, half buried in the water, staved into a thousand fragments, on thoK fragments the shrieking crew dashing
dashing themselves, tried to reach the shore, which wu not two miles distant I was the only one who reached it alive, fate was careful for none but me, the world was not to lose its spectacle ard its scourge I was thrown on a bare solitary point of shore, about half a mile from Puzzoli The stranger was standing there, lightning hissed around his head, and the ocean bunt at his feet, neither could hurt us I fell, spent and breathless, at lus feet, and he said to me, " rush to the ocean, and it shall throw you back on the shore agam From that hour I became his, he led me to this desert hut, where I have past two days without food, or sleep, or pra} er I drink abundantly, my dreams are terrible, they last all day but real. tv ss ill banish tbem No waking can be so fearful as this sleep, mine eyes are open but my soul is in a trance of heavy restlessness, of conscious suspension, in which it is undisturbed vol ш « by

He was no longer opposed or interrupted In consequence of his plan, it was settled that Ippolito should gt for that day to Naples, and that Annibal should depart to the seat of the transaction. They were to meet at night They were now rising to depart, when Ippplrto, m whote heart the yeainings of nature lingered, lamed and looked on his bfotber. Aamibal extended hts aims, Ippo¬ lito aunk into tbem, and they wept on eaeh otter t necks, aad kitted each other, their laM-frattraak their last human tean fell on
on each other's dry, wastetl cheeks. But they knew their task, and smote away the wai m drops, and set their teeth, and drew their breath hard, and tried to belie God's work and look like villains. They turned for relief to Schemoli, and met amazement. He was on his knees, in agony of piayer; the sweat drops stood on his brow ; his body was wound into the dust! They gazed without comment, for they were deprived now nearly of all power of wonder, or any of further fear. Had they not, the attitude of Sche¬ moli would have inspired evea fear. To see Lucifer surrounded by livid light¬ nings is less shocking to the imagination than to see him in the garb of an angel of light. They separated, and found horses prepared to convey them to Naplei and to the neighbourhood of Muralto!

Believing, therefore, that the event of this conference would scarce have ended in the mitigation of bis penance, he pre· pared to undergo it, mentally resolving, howev er, that if after the experience of some moments he found solitude what he feared, he would summon his attendanti to the antichamber, and at least hear then steps, and see their lights through the crevires of the door while he per- foimed his task He had scarce trme to explore the terrors of solitude The issue of those dark hauutmgs by which the brothers had been beset so long, may already be conjectured The secret ernie, so often suggested to them by vi¬ sionary temptation, thev now proceeded, under the influence of visionary terror, to perpetrate.

They rushed in, there was no outny of inquiry or conjecture, for the pam cides stood, frozen and senseless, still grasping their red dripping weapons. The body wu raised and examined, but when they discovered it was stone dead, their faculties were restored, a wild burst of inarticulate horror rung througb the 4 apartment,

and undisturbed solitude for thirty-six, hours To this the officials, after examining the apartment, and removing fiom it every implement of mischie!, consented. He also demanded that no judicial steps should be taken against tl e prisoners, till a document which he wasprepanug was ready to be submitted to the prin¬ cipal justiciary of Naples Л\ ith regaid to this, he was informed that of a case so mysterious and extiaordinary, no cog¬ nizance would probably be taken till a much more rtmote period, as the process of inquiry and examination which would be instituted could not bc too minute or dehlierate.

She murmured a few broken notes of an air I had often heard her lull her infants to rest with Every •ense might have b»:n feasted by the picture before me, but along with the odoui of the jasmine, came the perfume of those fatal letters I noted this well I remen bered that lovers, in voluptuous gallantry, often perfumed their letters As I gazed on her, a tear glittered in the moonshine, it was followed by another, and another, and the last was accompanied by the mur¬ mured name of ' Verdoni ' I groaned audibly , she started , she replaced the the letters and the taper, and ap¬ proached the bed Are you awake, my Lord?—' I fear I am almost awake ' —' You fear ' —' Oh ' yes, it was so sweet to dream as I have done ' — ' Were your dreams so pleasant ' I thought í heard you groan —' I groaned

I did not dare to think what this might mean My first nnpi lse was to seize it and try it where I suspected it was to be applied I collected myself, and again called Ascanio. ' You have dropt a key ' He sprung forward to seize it with
with the aspect of one who curses ins own carelessness liere I might havı rested, and suf¬ fered him to depart with the shame of defeated villainy but my curiosity, my—the devil within me wasroused —' Does that key guard a treasure, that you snatch it with such eager¬ ness ? —' I do ιοί know, my Lord — ' You do not know what your own key secuies'—'"I Lord, the key is not mine ~' Not yours, whose is it then —' Il belonged to my late master, the Chevalier Verdom He made no use of it himself, he kept it as a rel.c, he said, it was a key belonging to a cabinet he had presented to a lady he loved " I drove him from the room In the confusion of his fear, he again dropt the key' I tened it, I flew to Lrminia s room, the was in the gardens of the cattle with her children and attendants I locked tbe door, to have seen my feverish trembhrgs, any one would have 7 believed
believed I was hastening to tome feast of solitary delight, and at that moment, I would have changed situations with him that was writhing on tue rack One hope remain«!, that the key was not designed for that cabinet, I tried it. Alas, it was only the trembling of my hands that made it seem to resist, it opened A mist overspread my sight, a gentle knock at the door aroused me , it was my eldtst boy —' You cannot come in, mv darling —'Why father-—. ' Because I am busy —' I know from the sound of your voice you are not praying, father, and why may I not come in '—I could not answer —' Tell mc what are you doing —'I do uot know what I am doing,' s J I in agony ' Whatever it be, throw it away, if it prevents you from coming to the gar¬ den, and playing with us ' He tripped lightly away I heard every word , the responses of an oracle had not tunk ю deep into my soul—* throw it away '' The
The fttal papers were yet unopened As I turned them with a shaking hand they fell, I stooped to replace them, and when my eye glanced on tbe first line, I could not withdraw it till I had read to ι he last " When I had done, sense and me¬ mory forsook me. I know not where my spirit went for some time, but though it seemed the very haunt of final woe, it was paradise to its returr to conscious¬ ness All was mist and cloud for some time, such as the soul struggles througn, breathless and fancy-bound, in some hag¬ ridden dream I saw the walls of the apartment, but I knew not where I was, I heard bells, and steps, and voices, but I knew not where I was, I heard the voice of the Countess in the gallery, and then I knew where and what I was " My despair was not easily concealed, even my domestics, I believe, observed it. In a short time, however, I became * invisible
invisible to all but my brother and hu servant them only I admitted, yet their I could not bear to behold " I am convinced I felt at the sight of that dev il Ascanio, what a sorcerer feels m the presence of an imp whose ministry lie employs, but by whom he knows he will be finally plunged in woe his intel¬ ligence and his observation seemed neces¬ sary tu existence, while they consumed it I lived on poison I was like the tn.iiinal travelling in the livid shade of the Upas, who must feed to live, and if lie feeds must die I had no feelmgs tor this man but hatred and malevolence I never saw him but my-throat swelled, and my eyes seemed scalding in their sockets, jet I fastened on him for my moi bid food, and devoured it witb the greediness with which one would swallow tlie pre nises of hope and fortune " I mentioned to my bi other the con¬ fessions of the guilty le t tei 9 I was asto- voL in в nished

I hail relinquished every c'ueumstance and pre¬ tension of rank and eminence. I had be¬ come a private man in habit and exterior; all the vanity of the eaitk was become tasteless and loathsome to me, I sickened at their hollowuess, I spurned theii inca¬ pacity to suspend or alleviate calamity. I execrated the celebi ity that made their possessor's fall only more conspicuous, his misfortunes a moie popular theme of vulgar curiosity, his degradation а more ample feast for the vultures of envy. I felt
felt that to return to what I liad been was impossible, that my outward man must partake of the change of my niwaid man , that I could no longa support the Count Montono s name, when I ю longci possessed the Count Montónos mind I cannot desenbe the piocess or the eftett of this ihange so great and clttctual though I experience its consequences to this hour I was a bold, ambitious, vain man, prrud of my rank, and fond of its pompous appendages what I becami suddenly and finally, ni) nanative will tell I have compaied my progiess to tint of a magnificent caravan, over- whelmed and blasted in the majesty of its march by the burning deluge ot the desert, and fixed a monument of desola tion where it had moved a monument ot pride The result ot my meditations vvas anticipated by a letter fiom Muralto, where my brother still resided as a spy on the culprits. He told me that thtn passum
passion raged witn sucli shameless νιο Icnce that Verdom wis frequently intro¬ duced at the castle, and that he had even fixed on a night to spend there, which the Countess had confessed ind implored him to conceal believing from the frequency of her lovers visits that it was no longti possible to dissemble then object When 1 read this— 1 need not go on nor will I enumerate every link of the ihain that they vvou id round me with the art of demons, every one of burning iron, that scorched with¬ out consuming I unit mention, however, one circumstance, which is bu* toostrong- ly indicative of my character, of that part of it which is derived fiom hereditaiy propensity I think I can recollect the impressions tney intended to produce were unsettled till they introduced a wretch, a mendicant, an astrologer, who talked something about prediction, and horoscopes, and ascendants, and a trinai R 3 aspect

At the close ot tli^t evening I quitted iny habitation, and inet niy brothei in a, iprest that skirted the Campagna, about two

All this I heard, but after the last sentence I heard nothing We quit¬ ted the cottage, we mounted oui horses. ' What do you purpose to do' said my brother I could make no an¬ swer, but showing my drawn stdetto, and pointing towards the castle We rushed into tbe wood , I did not see we were ι lined by Ascanio, till he pointed out \ trdoni at a little distance before us 1 sprung forward, he attempted to defend himself, and believing us fiom our masks and arms to be assassins, im¬ plored us to save his child I dashed the bastard to the ground He drew, but by this time the othei s had come up, and Дзсаша·
Ascanio with a blow lopped off the hand that held the sword. Possibly he saved my life, for I was so blind and impotent with fury he might have oveitome me with a reed. But I had no wish to man¬ gle or butcher, I would not touch a hair ot his head. I seired the reins of his horse, and we galloped towards the cas¬ tle.

tins resolution of resoving to myself the powers and mode of retribution, that a circumstance occurred, whose mystery is most dark and voluminous, and whose mystery can be disclosed only by me I was (while yet a brother in the Franciscan convent,) returning from a pilgrimage to Rome, when a report which was diffused every where, met my ear, that a disco¬ very had been made by some dying man, te a moak in Apulia, relative to the fa¬ mily of Mentono, whose honours, whose very existence, it was said, was involved in its substance. By «horn such a discovery could he made, (of «Inch / believed myself the solitary [losstss r on the face of the earth,) was of less moment to inqune, than ho v to obstruct its disclosure I was resolved '' it neither the Inquisition nor the Vatican, fo powei, secular or spiritual should wrest my victim from me Trie .nonk, it »as reported, vias on his

to Penzoli, paused at a village where circumstances beyond the reach of con¬ jecture detained him The influence I had obtained over the mind of the Count, was mixed and extra¬ ordinary -»-My austerities, my superhu¬ man abstinence and contempt of fatigue, and pain, and watching, had rawed me to the highstst pitch of his estimation as a Anotte. For my interference between his danger and the icqui ilions of Pallermi, he fèlt a kind of visionary gratitude, and títere were other facts of my character, that mingled awe and wonder with th« •••troni I held over bin.

Hence he would at one time employ me as an assassin without remorse, and at another, consult me as a saint, without super. stition , for where the human character it not supposed to exiat, human gniltr vanishes also Believing nie one to whom all things were known, he ceased to have any compuuctious reserve, wd believing me one to whom almost all things werp possible, he called on n e without hesita¬ tion, foi that assistance which he believed oould be conferred by me without a crime Such was tbe influence I had acquired over a man agitated by the fears ofun steady
steady guilt, and the anguish of i.npcifect pen tence, sanguinary from the (bead ot diseoveiy, and superstitious from thi ex¬ perienced erosions of consen nei , anxious to retain what had been a. quii ed bv blood, yet desirous to combine the pardon of guilt with its secunty Such was the influence I was solicitou» to acquire, tbe utmost extent of my vengeance was to the limits of this voi Id Men may smile at these illusions of romantic revenge, but it is certain that while I devoted lum to ffeath, I lid lum α pilgrimage of sa-ntly preparation to it, while no power could wre»t my victim from me, or bu} from me one of his dying groans I pra} ed, I watched, I Wept with him I sentenced the sinner, but I tried to save the penitent " I will now rehearse the more dark and complicated means resorted to with Ippolito I discovered, what in Naples is easily discoverable, a number of those wretches who, under various denomina¬ tions,
tions, proft ss tl) hold converse with ano¬ ther world lo the e I tolti a tale suffi¬ ciently plausible and «hat was more pl.usil.l. I told them out haiidfuls of gold Tht liberality or the suptrstition ot the Count had supplied me abundantly My plan required the aid ot numbers, and it leijinred a diveisitv and costliness of prepái ation, and ot all most dilhiult, it required that my victim should not hè undecened bv the vulgar rapacity of my associates, which I satisftid ilandcotinely nijself My hrst application to Ippolito was in the jargon of his favourite study On this anıt many other occasions, the darkness of my habit, anil the incon¬ ceivable swiftness of my motions, be¬ friended the obsiunty I affcitetl After¬ waids I concealed myself in the confes¬ sional of a chuich, whithtr I had led him, and vv Inch I knew had a private recess, aud left him with the belief that ι had melted into theehineuts Another time I led hnn to a vault, where lay a body
body from whose mortal fate I wished to suggest to him his own " At all times, by n y knowledge of the passages of the palace, I had oppor¬ tunities of leaving lettera m his apart ment, and once of entering it while be was there, whet my shewing a family ring, and telling a mysterious story of its last possessor, contributed nota little to his wonder and perplexity At length when I believed him sufficiently impressed with fantastic notions of my character and agtnc), I led him to a subterranean vault, wliere the disguises of my asso· cwtes, the quaint solemnity of our lan¬ guage, the blue and vaporous light that played on objects not to be described, displayed «very device whose influence could abuse or witch th« senses or the nund But I discovered m both my vic¬ tims that whatever facility they be¬ trayed to the admission of gloomy .and .fantastic impressions, tbey both revolted witli

By the skill of one of onr associates, an exact m xlel of tlie faces of Ippolito and the Count was procurad in wax, they were moulded into masks, and the former was assumed by another, who was nt figure strikingly like Ippolito. This man, placing himself in a recess of the vaalt wliere I led my victim, represented by hu gestures reflected in a shaded mirror, the auguub of a mind impelled to an inr voluntary crime, at the moment tliat Ip» polito, touched by a gloomy sympathy, bent over the mirror, tbe man uncovered lus nask, and Ippolito beheld Ins living kkeneis.

" May he find favour !" energetically pronounced Rosalita. " May justice and power combine to reinstate him in his rights !

chill which lay at his heart, for when he thought upon the scene of the morning— and how could he think of ought else—the fate of his ill-starred brother, cut off m the full bloom of strength and manhood, lay like a death-blast on his spirits It was desolation—desolation to hope and pro¬ mise it needed all the resignation, and faith, and nerve, of Chnstian fortitude, to elicit ought of balm in the chastening He thought of his mother, colourless and statue like such as Adam Jenkins de¬ scnbed her when borne a pnsoner to the Tower he thought of her, and his tears flooded over —he thought of his brother Geoffiy, and those fast-flowing tears were quick dried up by the fire which burnt upon Ins cheek Shame it was, and misery, far, far keener, than the sharpest arrow affliction could have hurled The sound of voices roused him from his dream of torture he looked up the heavens nere rayless not a single star glittered in the dark canopy, and the wind,
wind, sweeping oer the long grass, moan ed amid the branches of the witheys and alders, thick dappling the far spreading morass Here and there a distant light twinkled faint and feeble as the 1 imp of the glow worm for though it tokened the dwellings of men it vv ıs fir too dun to pilot to the lm bour As tlıe voices ad vaneed, De Ια l'ole slunk closei beneath the shadow of the wall ind lit giasped the weapon which hy hid uudei his tloak for it was an houi suited to the night plun derer, and α spot wheie murder might stalk unawed of moitil to_,iuzince A huddled group ol men and women return mg from St Giles s into I ondon pissed almost at his side I hey spoke of the execution of the moniin^ md one above the rest, named sn Geoffiy de li Pole — Arthui wis ill cır To betray ins own km txclumed the voite to ensure hie b) the de ith of his brothei I had rather be that dead brother,

Diamond, was to harboui and succour James Diamond himself " Yes, with life will I aid thee," he mused, as he measured with his eye, the tall and graceful form moving mechani¬ cally beside him " If my home—if my counsel—if my experience can profit thee, I shall not have toiled in vain Scarce aided by the dim and wretched lanterns, so thinly scattered along the nar row streets, and stumbling over the rough and unequal pavement, it was long ere they entered the Miñones, and longer still, ere crossing the dangerous waste, so thickly intersected with pits and ditches, thej reached the obscure farm house, stand ing almost w itlim the shadow of the late convent of St Clare, founded in the j ear 1293, by Blanch, queen of Navan e, and consort to Edmund duke of Lancaster De la Pole started at the heavy sigh which swelled the breast of his companion, as he stood within the door porch of his humble home, yet Diamond gave not woids to feehng

be necessary, some name, some token, of past or present " Again he paused Arthur stood irresolute, every feature working, every pulse throbbing and when he did speak, it was with that va¬ cillation of look and manner, which be¬ trays the war within " What if I seek him myself? ' he said " And why not, so that the enterpnse be not too hazardous ' ' replied Diamond, evidently stung at the seeming want of confidence " It is all hazard,' exclaimed De la Pole " To be seen—to be recognised, is sure death ' " And yet thou dost scorn the means by which to escape the ruin," quick re¬ marked the city constable " Say not scorn, my fnend," and De la Pole stretched forth his hand in amity " On my hfe and honour, 'tis the fear of involving thee which seals my lips '" " Well then I will seek the lord Staf¬ ford myself, ' said Diamond, " and delude the
the lord Stafford hither by some idle tale ot my own ' He moved towards the door as he spokt, then pausing—" I will straight to su Richard Cholmondely," he pursued " and if my lord Stafford be within London city, I will seek him out, though he be in the court of the king's grace But the lord Staffoid was not within London city, neither was ht m tbe court of the despotic Henry, and Diamond re¬ turned from his visit to the Tower, with disappointment in his heart The lord Stafford was at Bruce-Castle, watching beside the sick bed of his drooping part¬ ner , for alas ' the lady Ursula was stricken wellnigh unto death, by the blight which had so roughly fallen on the heads of her illustrious kindred " Poor Ursula '" faltered Arthur, as the tears flooded his cheeks, " this indeed is a season of bitter trial to us all " Then startmg up—" Sure, ' he said, " I can steal away
away to Tottenham, even if I journey in the night.' " And when at Tottenham, what then ? asked Diamond. " Why then will my errand be well¬ nigh accomplished," rejoined De la Pole, " seeing that I shall have gained the ear of lord Stafford " " Belike thou mayest hght upon the members of my lord Stafford's household,' observed Diamond " if so be, seeing that thy cause be secret, thou mayest betray thyself, and mar thy hopes, in the very onset" " The rum will fall singly—the ruin will be my own," said Arthur, feelingly. " I shall die free from the heart-pang of implicating a friend so kind ' " Are there none to mourn thee'— none to bewail the obduracy of thy pnde? asked Diamond, marvelling at his firm¬ ness , " none, i n i 1 * " Say, pnneiple, common humanity, ought, save pnde,' interrupting him ' pride

He ceased Here was kindness, here was native genu¬ ine
ine magnanimity De la Pole's heart was too full for words, the rush of feehng was almost choking, he could only stretch forth his arms, and precipitate himself upon the neck of his wondering host *' Methinks, resumed Diamond, coolly calculating upon time and distance, "we may journey to Tottenham and hie back into London ere night-fall, so that I reach my post, and stand firm to my duty, at the fitting season Peradventure the lord Stafford may keep thee at Bruce Castle " No, no, not so, said Arthur, when voice and power returned " my duty lies here, amid shoals and quicksands, here in London List to me, my friend, for disguise shall cease As he spoke he tore off his muffling cap, and bared his high and polished blow, all fnnged and shadowed with bright and glossy curls— not pride—but true nobility of birth and feehng, beaming in his eye, and glowing on his cheek " Thou hast heard tell of the

" Sure thou art wounded," said Staf¬ ford, spnnging to his side. De la Pole looked up For the first time their eyes met - a start, a glow, pro¬ claimed recognition, yet not a word es¬ caped ; fear checked the impulse of heart —policy placed an ice bar on action A brief space, and Stafford recovered all his self-presence, he spoke apart to Diamond, spoke long and earnestly, and then, with well-assumed indifference, he placed his hand upon the arm of De la Pole, and almost without the seeming, slunk with bim into the thickest of the wood A- lone—shut in—no human eye to see—ah ' what a burst, what a rush of feeling, grappled heart to heart ' one bound, one impulse, and the cares of earth were for¬ gotten , and the penis, the snares, the vicissitudes of time and chance, were lost in the warm embrace ' The bliss was brief, the pang returned, acute and subtle " Mighty God '" ejaculated Stafford, first rallying into speech, and gazing sor¬ rowfully
rowfully in the face of Arthur, " how found ' how changed '" " In fortune, not in heart," feltered De la Pole; and then again, m almost wo¬ man's weakness, he wept upon the neck of Ins friend " This must not be take comfort, I do beseech ye, take comfort," and Staf¬ ford »truggled for firmness, " others may see—others may pierce disguise and mys¬ tery We stind in the midst of many and gieat perils Think — think, my fnend, think-----' " Ay, until thought madden," inter¬ rupted Arthur, then with a fresh burst of heart and feeling—" One word—only one w ord of my sister, and no more ' " Ursula is in you litter," whispered Stafford " but I dare not bear even to her the tale of your return Dearest Ar¬ thur, those who surround us, those who owe us service, may impeach, may be¬ tray ' " I know it well," said De la Pale, and the
the shudder of death seemed to palsy every limb—" I stand here in mortal jeo¬ pardy , a price set upon my head, pro¬ scribed, bunted, wellnigh heart-broken but not guilty, Stafford—not guilty, though said to be so " " Oh no, not guilty ' unfortunate, not guilty," said, or rather felt, lord Stafford, as yielding for a moment to his feehngs, be again precipitated himself upon the neck of Arthur The clasp, the stolen indulgence, the fearful touching pause, yielded to stern necessity De la Pole struggled for free dom, he broke away from the trammel of affection —" I must not involve you,' he said, " I must not involve one dear to us both I must go hence, I----- " Only for a season, ' exclaimed Staf¬ ford ; " only for a brief hour Policy, dearest Arthur, must be our guide Sever yourself from the man who bears you fel¬ lowship, and make your way alone to Tottenham—to the cross planted by king Edward,

That cry— that joyous cry, rang as a death knell in her mental ear ' Guinara was the slave of passion—
passion— Escander was the price of her fealty ! Gulnara was linked to the inte¬ rests of Barbarossa by a chain firmer than steel I Thus hemmed in, and shut away from human succour, all her dependence seemed to turn upon her own faded cheek and wasted form ; and when her eyes fell upon the surrounding mirrors, she exul 'd in the wreck which sorrow had so visibly produced.

Alas ! the pang of death had been light com¬ pared to the pang which smote her. She wooed death—she frantickly invoked death ' death, the oblivious balm for earthly care and
and earthly tnal ' death, the sure rescuer from dishonour and from misery ' for such was the prospect which spread itself be¬ fore her, that death seemed to her scared and harassed mind as her sole fnend She shrunk from Ihe terrors of II tv g nottliedeal illan utics a death wl tl ature ever ade TI о the j o t oi 1 s о fancy falls t d fta s a I ousa d denti , fear g o e Often did she start erect, and glance around, and stnve to stifle down the hor¬ ror of her feehngs but with the convic¬ tion—and how could she shut out the conviction ' — came despair Barbarossa and the shipwrecked manner one ' Bar- darossa, aimed in all his resistless power, hflr captor · her tyrant ' Alas ' like unto the fell fiend, he could mingle wormwood in the gall cup, he could crush, and wi¬ ther, and annihilate every spring of pro mise and every spnng of promise was crushed, and withered, and annihilated already, for rum seemed to pursue and hem
hem her in on every side' Whole hours was it ere composure returned, and then twas the dreadful composure of exhaust¬ ed nature, for she lay, still, and tintless, as the lawn on which her head was pillowed, and thrice did Gulnara call upon her name, ere she opened her eyes to the hght of heaven " Sure, thou art ill—thou art strangely changed, sweet lady' said the slave " Hast thou been visited by bad dreams ' or hast thou yielded rem to thy own sick fancies ? " 1 would they were dreams — only dreams ' ' faltered Rosalita , and then again her head fell back, and her eyes closed Gulnara shrieked aloud she wrang her hands, she yielded to her tenors " Why —why did I arm thee against thyself 5 she cried out " Why did I tell thee ought of the royal Zaphira' Too sure the hke tragedy has befallen us' and again she filled the air with her cries " I have taken nought to harm the body,

Rosalita uttered no sound, but she turned and looked imploringly, searcbingly on the speaker Lady, pursued the slave ' I would pour balm into thy bosom, I would lure back hope Thou didst not see thy father dead is it marvel then that thy fathers wounds should heal—that thy father should live through the strife, though fate and men seemed armed against him ' " Beguile me not with false words— de ceive me not with false hopes said Rosa lita, earnestly ' Alas ' I know not how to adjure thee—how to touch thy stony heart Not by thy mothei s God Gulna¬ ra, for thou art a willing apostate to thy mothers creed and behke the Christian s pangs are as sport and p..sn че to thee yet if ought ot natures feelings be m common twixt Christian and infidel, think of the bowstnng around thy mothers neck- think

" The combining strength of Christen¬ dom, said Guinara, aftei the pause of a moment—" the powers of Europe, lady, led on by the emperor Charles the Fifth Rosahta spoke not, but the lightning of her eye, and the brightening of her cheek, betrayed her inward feelings " My lord the bashaw laughs at the threatened peril, pursued the slave, le- gardless of her emotion " he estimates the strength and bravery of his Algennes be¬ yond ought which man can wage against him Not the vaunted prowess of Charles the Fif b —though the fame of his con quests be borne ο·ι the four winds of heaven—can make his spirit quail " Here—will they land here at Algiers ? asked Rosahta, almost bieathless with the vol n M tide
tide of new hopee which came rushing on each other for somuch, through life, arewe the creatures of circumstances, that in the briefness of an instant, one dazzling possi¬ bility rose paramount to all De la Pole might seek her at San Angelo— De la Pole might there learn of her capture— De la Pole might join the vast armament led on by Charles tbe Fifth, and landing at Algiers, might rescue her from the power of her hated foe Her father too, if in life, might at Ins hands regain liberty for like herself, her father must be doomed to slavery, or how should Barbarossa know that he had survived the deadly contest of that fearful night? Hopes, like these, grew so thick out of the words of Gulnara, that life and youth regained all their sti¬ mulus, and she started from the couth, with new fire in her eye, and fresh roses on her cheek " It is believed so—it is suspected so, replied Gulnara, marvelling at the strange metamorphosis " My lord the ba.havv says
says little, but Escander daily looktv toward the sea, in expectation of the Christian fleet." ■ " Hah I so soon—so very soon !" and joy thrilled in the words, in the heart of Rosalita. " Since the capture of the kingdom of Tunis," resumed Guinara, " the incursions of the cruize» have been so frequent and so outrageous, that it has awakened the slumbering vengeance of Christendom. Escander thought it would be so—Escan¬ der has often said the season of retaliation would arrive—Escander has warned Bar¬ barossa of the possible evil : but it matters little now ; the storm is gathering, and the bolt will fall. Alack! war at best is a horrid thing I Lady, when I recall tbe miseries at Calan, the trials, the priva¬ tions, the dangers of that fearful siege, my spirit faints in the prospects—dies in the coming struggle." " And my spirit rises—glows—rallies into strength and vigour," mused Rosalita, M 2 as
as she stood at the open balcony, and looked towards the distant ocean, and pictured the possible arrival of Chailes and his gallant followers, with an anxious and a throbbing heart " Grant tint I ma) live to see tint day—that glorious day ' she aspirated raising lier e) es to the cloudless heavens " That I may hvt to see the blessed cross towei o er yon heathen temples to see the mosques of M illőmet, despoiled of then vam trap pings, and dedicated to the woi ship of tiie one true God ' Perchance oh jov past telling ' to find my father among the ι esetied —to hear my fathers voice— ti crive ni) fither s blessing ' Teai s flooded her cheeks in the baie anticipation but they were teirs of transport rather lii n of sorrow—for she was a visionary—and as in the brain of all visionaries, hope tn uinphed over every ill blithe, and bright and buoyant, regardless of probability, αϊ most of possibility, hope bounded over ti ose obstacles it failed to conquei ' As

" The countess of Salisbury expects you," said Stafford ; and then they spoke no more until they had reached the base of Beauchamp Tower There they were joined by sir Richard Cholmondely A few brief words passed betwixt him and lord Stafford but De la Pole was deaf and blind to all exteinal things his heart was with his mother—his thoughts in the sad chamber from v hich so very lately the dl-stai red Anna Boleyn had passed to the block—the chamber alternately the scene of her triumph and of her humiliation— for Beauchamp Tower had been her so¬ journ the night preceding her coronation ' From Beauchamp Tower, decked in all the splendour of majesty, she had moved a queen '—from Beauchamp Tower, sub¬ dued and humbled, and laden with con¬ tumely, as though to add gall to the death- pang, she had moved a culprit ' Woful il¬ lustration of the vicissitudes of time, and chance, and royal favour' Melancholy, alas' was the association of thought and feehng '
feeling' In this same tower, beneath the roof which sheltered hion, withm the walls whicli encompassed him, many a royal victim had sunk beneath the sacrificing passions of jealousy, hate, and mad ambi¬ tion his own blood, his own kindred, his own maternal grandfather, George duke of Clarence,—the innocent hapless sons too of king Edward the Fourth ' The dream-like thought brought to his " mind's eye' Tirrel m Ins living sepultbre, and the like hollow grave-like voice seemed to pronounce— Go not to England ' Images of death and horror arose and crowded the pathway the head of his brother spout¬ ing forth blood—the shadowy form of his mother, wan as though wrapt in the mort cloth ' He paused on the first landing- place, and though late so impatient of de lay, snatched, and clung with convulsive tightness to the arm of lord Stafford " Stay—yet a moment stay," he implored, his limbs trembling, his breath labouring, bis hps, his cheeks, colourless as clay " I would
" I would this interview were well over ' said Stafford, pitying the agony he could not soften " Anon—anon, I shall be calm—I shall be better, sobbed out Arthur " Bear with me, dear fnend This meeting, for which I have toiled so long and so ceaselessly, subdues, unmans me My mother—my blessed mother ' ' He turn¬ ed aside his face as he spoke, for tears de luged it " Greatness of soul and inborn worth upholds the countess of Salisbury in every trial, said lord Stafford " She triumphs oer foes and fortune Care may have planted deeper furrows, but her fortitude is unsubdued On my life, Arthur, her example is rare and bright ' " Worthy the kingly race from which she springs ' ' exclaimed De la Pole " Holy Jesu ' that such a mmd should be so taxed, so tortured ' But lead on, my fnend, I pray you, lead on time is too brief to be uselessly squandered ' Stafford
Stafford did lead on, yet when he had mounted to the chamber — when he stretched forth his arm to knock for ad¬ mission, De la Pole impulsively grasped it. " Are you sure, quite sure, my mo¬ ther expects me ?" he again demanded " Ay, expects, impatiently expects you, whispered lord Stafford The next instant the door was thrown open—the in xt, and Arthur lay panting at the feet of his mother—clinging to hei —gazing on her—scarce daring to breathe, lest the seeming shadow should melt and fade away, and leave him lonely and de¬ solate as before Perhaps, amid all the wild struggles and throes of mortal passion, there exists none burning with fiercer rage, than was kindled in the soul of De la Pole, as he gazed upon this unoffending, suffering, venerated mother, bound down, as it were, to the stake, subject to the nod of capricious tyranny, without crime, with¬ out offence, dragged away from home, severed
severed from every social tie of kindred yet so patient under ill, so magnanimous under trial —for what she had lost in freshness, she had gained in dignity —she looked proud and unbending spite of the sickly hue of sorrow which overspread her cheek " This must not be, my son, said the countess, first rallying into exertion and strength " more than lamentation is re quired at our hands ihe cup which our Heavenly Father prepareth for us, shall vve not drink it? Ay, Arthur, and I will drain it even to the dregs, if thou wilt hearken to me, and heed me ' She ceased, but Arthur could not answer he still lay at her feet—hei hands tight clasp¬ ed withm his own—his eyes resting on her placid features, until they grew dizzy, and ached with the mtenseness of the gaze ' Wilt thou not minister consolation to me, my son—my dear son ? gently urged the countess, bowing low hei head, and pressing her hps to his damp cold fore¬ head
head " Wilt thou not disappoint the tyrant who thirsteth for our blood ? Wilt thou not submit thyself to my rule?" " Unto death," gasped out Arthur " Speak on, my mother doubt me not I am here to do thy bidding " " Thou wilt be passive, and calm, and gentle, and dutiful, as I have ever known thee," quick resumed lady Salisbury,— " thou wilt minister balm m this my ut¬ termost need—thou wilt not mar my hopes" '* God forefend '" ejaculated De la Pole, and he kissed the hands he held with pious reverence The countess turned away her face nature triumphed, and her tears flooded over: it was the weakness of a moment —she struggled hard, she resumed all her self-presence, she even tned to smile, as she piously pronounced—" This burden is imposed on us by the hand of our Hea¬ venly Father, this is a sore evil, but God can turn it into good. Take comfort, my beloved
beloved son the cloud may pass away after life may dawn in bnghtness Now sit thee down, and tell me of thy own hopes, that my soul may bless thee," and gently she raised him from the floor, and pointed to the settle beside her There, in heartfelt commune, forgetful of future and present, was every secret of the past revealed his voyage to Sicily— his sojourn on the eve of Santa Agatha in the fishing village crouching at the foot of the mountain of Tindaro—tbe profession of the novice of Santa Maria—his bnef vie« of Rosalita Della Monti —his visits to the con. ent grate—his interview with the count her father—his hopes, his doubts, his fears, ay, and every beamy dream of infant ρ ssion, and every fairy flight of heart and fancy, all was disclosed—all was laid open to her, as to Heaven ' And yet no frown gathered on her brow, no as¬ tounding objection passed her hps, she listened, and she smiled, and she seemed to dream over again the fond dream of her own
own youth—to retrace love's bright dawn in the glowing enthusiasm of her son ' " I would I could see and bless this gentle Rosahta '" said the countess, as De la Pole paused, and bent his eye in anxious appeal upon her " But, alas ' it may not be Fate and fortune war against us a fearful barrier shuts me in from all I love I must be content, dear Arthui, to speed thee back to Sicily—to make thee the bearer of my gratulation and blessing Peradventure it be for our after good," she pursued, staying his effort to speak, " for however adversity be bitter and unpalatable, it cleanseth the heart, and bnngeth the thoughts home, and di¬ vorces us from this world of sense and va nity, and dissipates those charms which grapple to us W tl tind I, strong as flesh and blood Ah, believe me, 'tis a salutary school ' and again she attempted to smile—" how ever the perversejudgment, and perverser heart of man, war against it ' " Such

" Bless me, my mother, bless me ;'' and De la Pole, wrapt and devoted, cast him¬ self before her, and clung in lowly reve¬ rence to her knees. " Art thou content to eke out the bless¬ ing by obedience and perfect submission N 2 to

" Speak on—point out the path, dear, dear mother ' ' and De la Pole listened m almost breathless earnestness " The path lies straight and clear,' re¬ sumed lady Salisbury " I have said a boat awaits to convey thee on shipboard All I lequire at thy hands, my son, is quick leave-taking, and passive conformity to our plans and hopes The ship is bound for Italy when thou shalt have landed, haste thee to Padua—to thy brother Re¬ ginald and when thou shalt have gained his secret ear, say to him, all that love— that mothers love can urge or warrant Say—say—" Her voice faltered, her lips quivered, her cheek faded and flushed by turns tears gathered, for a moment they gushed forth—the next, they were dashed away and gone " Say to him, ' she con¬ tinued, quick regaining all her nauve strength

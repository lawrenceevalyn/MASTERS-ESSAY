solicited hls father to present Leonard with a commission in a regiment, then quartered at Maidstone, that he might appear still further dependant, though, in fact, the generous Willmot had w ıth his own slender allowance, enabled 1 is friend to surmount emhauassmenls, which will occur to ) oung men of the best fortunes, who do not regu¬ late their expences with economy, foi Willmot, though the youngest son of a family, mort honouiable than wealthy had a noble spnit, and a disinterested reait He accepted the commission with gratitude and pleasure, as it enabled him to remain a few months longer near the fn« nd he still thought worthy his esteem The regaids of Willmot were not so slight as to be shaken hy a few failings lie stiove to reason his companion ош of scierai en ore , nor feared any trouble to nnke his efforts successful He was the senior of Alfred by two years, but had five years the advantage of hım in sense and principle While

Lord Strathmore could not but appro! e of
of such a companion for his son, for abandoned indeed must be the mmd which does not respect virtue m another, howei er irregular their own practice Haverfoid esteemed Willmot as much as he could esteem any one, and Lady Jane had not been two hours in his company, belore she determined to make a conquest of the black-eyed hero In this she might hai e succeeded, for she was sprightly, sensible, and rather handsome, but there was а degree of self-sufficiency in her deport¬ ment, which checked the favourable im¬ pression her charms might otherwise have made on the beholder, who might admire, but could haidly love- so diffeient, yet so generally united, are these sentiments To amid the conscious looks of Lady Azelia, who was too much pleased with Leonard to concenl her admiration, he diew Lord Haveiford out all the next morning on a pleasurable excursion, frpm which they but returned in time to tea с 3 Lady
Lady J me accused them of some ıııtı iguc, and rallitu them on their want of gallantry iu not asking her to accompany them , desiring, by way of punishment, that they would hx a day on which they might all ride over to Tunbndge Wells This being decided to her satisfaction, she seated her¬ self at her harp , and, after listening to a few pieces, Willmot stole away having previously secured, from the Earl's library, St Pierre's Studies of Nature, Marmontel s Tales, and Mrs Bryan's Lectures on Astro¬ nomy With these he hastened to meet his lovely pupil, who had not joined the family that evening He found her anxiously expecting him ; and, the evening being very light, they seated themselves W an arbour at the end of the avenue Flutter attended his mistress, and rested at her feet, while Willmot read several passages, to which she listened with in¬ creasing interest He pointed out to her the
the particular passages which required her attention and explained some of the diffi¬ cult terms to her, with the attention ol a fond brother, and with sentiments equally pure During this agreeable occupation, thev wert suddenly interrupted by the appeai¬ ance of Mrs Gingerly, who petulantly chid her young charge for leaving her apart¬ ment , but perceiving Willmot, checked her accustomed volubility, and, dropping an obsequious curtsy, hoped she had not offended his young Lordship Willmot smiled at her simplicity, and, finding she mistook him for Haverford, availed himself of the chance, without descending to a direct falsehood " Make no apology, Mre Gingerly !" said he, " your prudence and discretion are well known to me, and I have some time wished for an opportunity of con¬ versing with you, for though personally unknown to me, I entertained the most favourable opinion of you from report " с 4 Part
Part of this address was certainly more polite than was strictly consistent with veracity The good dame, howevei readily credited all he said, and replied with abundant smiles anil obeisances— " Your Honour is monstrously cıvıl, in troth I am but a poor ignorant woman, but I can honestly say, that I have, to the best of my power, done my duty by this innocent child, who is shamefully neglected by her own kindred I believe my Lord has no reason to be dissatisfied, I keep her close enough, poor thing ' She is apt to be unruly sometimes ------" " That is only when you are too strict, Governess 1 " retorted Lady Azelia " How can I help being unruly, when I see my cousin, who is but a few months older than I am, dancing, playing, dressing, and going every where, while I am moped up with an old woman and a dog, truly 1 But it is all for your good, L.dy Azeha Does not my Lord tell you so, everlastingly ? and, when you are married, you
you will have as much liberty and pleasure as Lady Jane " " And don't I tell yon everlastingly," said Lady Azelia, " that it will break my heart if I am to Save that man for a husband I don't like him now, and what should I do, if I were to be always with hun? I will die first'" She burst into tears as she spoke Willmot then thought it time to inter¬ pose "My dear Lady Azelia, be pacified' No one will have the cruelty to force your inclinations, that would be directly con¬ traiy to your father's last injunction you aie to consult your own feelings entuely m an union of so solemn a natine. But a httle time will serve, I hope, to convince you that your prejudice against your cousin Alfred is unjust " "You have let me knowr what I was. ignorant of," said Lady Azelia, wiping her eyes with an nir of sntisfaction. " Mrs с 5 Governess,
Governess, why did not you tell me I was not to be forced to marry ? ' Mrs Gingerly, alter vindicating herself as well as she could, turned to Willmot, and, with much acrimony in her features, said— "And pray, Sir, who are у on ? I thought, to be sure, it was my young Lord, or I should not have suffered Lady Azelia to haye staid here, I promise you " Willmot, dreading a tedious alteration, and fearing to be discoi ered by some of the family, said—taking at the same time a brilliant pm from his shn t — " That you mistook me for his Lordship, is no fault of mine, Mrs Gingerly I hai с the honour to be his most intimate friend, and have it in my power to do you some servite Accept this, in token of my good wishes, and approbation of your care of this j oung hdy, whose welfare I have much set heart.

of Lady Azclia, whose fair hand he pressed with friendly warmth, and ihen quitted the garden. Mrs. Gingerly conducted her young charge to the house through another door; animadverting, by the way, on the per¬ sonal attractions, of Willmot. " He was certainly a beautiful man—a pretty spoken man—and so generous ! Well, to be sure it was fortunate she was not a young woman; and this pin, no doubl, it is worth a mort of money." Azelia was delighted to hear his praises; and, after subscribing to all her nurse advanced, embraced, and called her " a elenr, denr good o|d woman."

opportunity ol continuing lus instructions He selected fiom the best authois, passages for her to study, and was delighted to obscne the diligence of her application It being then assi/i tune, and the company to which Leonard belonged being sent out ol the town, under the command ol a subaltern, and the rest of the regiment dispersed round the country, he enjoyed a week s leisure , which he gladly availed himself of on Lady Azelia s account, ut whose behalf he ftlt himself daily more and more interested Her childish manner was corrected by imperceptible degrees, leaving only an artless vnacity, agreeable snd amusing , and every one perceived a favourable alteration m hei, whieh they were at a loss to account for Will not felt seciet satisfaction, which he was in perpetual fear of betraying by his looks, and, to disguise the interest he took in whatever concerned Lady Azelia, coquetted incessantiv with her cousin Ijidy Jane scnipled not to think bim in earnest
earnest She thought her own attractions irresistible and began to reckon him fore most m hei list of lovers and though her ambition might have led her to look higher than the son of a mere country gentleman his graceful person and elegant manners, aided by the becoming military dress made her oveılook every other deficiency Skeffingham regarded the young Captam with a suspicious eye He perceived th it he was likely to become the first favourite m the family а prerogative which ahe had for many years held exclusively He w s then past forty , of pleasing appearance and insinuating address He had flattered the foibles of Lady Jane till she was giddy with vanity and imagined he adored her, nor would the disparity of their ages have been with her any matter of objeition, but for the unlucky introduction of Will¬ mot Skeffingham did not love Lady Jane but an union with some branch of the family -would, he knew be highly advantageous
advantageous to hım , not only on account uf present pecuniary benefit, but in the prospect of future preferment He was too keen an observer, not to know that some particular and secret cause kept Willmot ьо frequently from the family panics, and he was not long before he discovered his pnvate haunt, but he de¬ termined to ait with cucumspeition, in an afl ur of so much tonsequence, and keep his disioieiy to himself, till it might be made to tum tö some advantage On the day fixed for tlieir excursion te> Tiinbridge, Lord Haverford requested that Lady Azelia might join the party To this the Earl at first objected, but upon its being enforced by Willmot, Skeffingham, and lady Jane, who could not, she de¬ clared, be the only female, he consented As Lady Azelia was not accustomed to rule on horseback, it was agreed that Alfred should dnve her in the curricle She was too much delighted with the expected pleasure, to make any objection, and Lord Hai erfoid
Haierford soon dashed on at a surprising rate " Where can that mad fellow be i" ci ied the Pari, impatiently "Hc will do the girl some mischief Do, Skcthngham, gallop after them " " Heai en forbid 1 " exclaimed Willmot, piercing his horse's side with the spur, who soon carried him out of sight, while Lady Jane, peevish at being left with Skeffingham, kept murmuring a thousand complaints Willmot, however, touid not get sight of the curricle He had taken a wrong road, and, being in a cross country, could not easily regain the right path At last he heaid the sound of horses, and, thinking it his own party, hastened to join them , it happened, however, to be some gentle¬ men returning from Tunbndge They gave him a propei direction , and, upon his making some inquiries, assiued him that they had met the part) he deseubed— tbat the lady was safe in the curucle, and they

In this pleasing occupation he was ln- senublehow tune glided on, till large drops of rain roused his attention, and he found a heavy storm coming on A neat villa wai m sight, an extensive poi tico over the door gave promise of shelter, and he hastened thither Securing his horse to a ra.l, he alighted, put up his pocket book, and, folding his arms, waited with much philosophic patience the clearing of the tempest Presently the door opened, andasenant civilly presented his mistress's compliments, and requested the gentleman would shelter himself
himself within Much flattered by the compliment, and being a fervent admirer of the fair sex, Leonard followed the foot¬ man into a parlour, where he was recened by a tall handsome woman, in the diess of a quaker She appeared moie than forty , but her rountenance wore a smile of be¬ nevolence, that would have made her look much younger, had not sorrow drawn a few harsh lines across a brow, once white and smooth as polished ivory Leonard began expressing his thanks for her hospitality, apologising for his in¬ trusion, and many other ceremonious introductions to conversation " There is no occasion for thee to talk of trouble or mtrusion, good youth ' A wet coat is no pleasant appendage , and, as thy appearance is respectable, Susanna Bently has no apprehensions m admitting thee a guest albeit, appearances aie not alway to be relied on " " I hope, Madam, you will have no cause lo repent your hospiulity ' Permit me,

had given a note of fifty pounds, to make her first purchases with, m imitation of her cousin, offered him a neat broche of amethyst and pearl and Leonaid, in re¬ turn, would hai e made them complimentary presents, hut Lady Jane ι ery peremptorily insisted that he should not, as she was determined nei er to accept the most trivial present, but from the man who, she had reason to beliei e, would be her husbanel, and she was certain Lady Azelia would follow hei example " Well, ' said Leonard, " I understand you, it is not, in your opinion, likely that I can offer you any thmg w orth acceptance " " Pardon me'" cried Lady Jane, looking 1 at him earnestly, " so much the reverse is it, that 1 could nei er think any thing you offered, unworthy my acceptance " " That I am sure of," said Lady Azelia ; " and I dare say my cousui thinks, with me, that the little drawing you brought us yesterday, is worth a thousand of these trumpery trinkets " There
There was so much artless grateful nf- fection in this obseıvatıon, though perhaps not more sincere than that of Lady Jane, yet which rendered it far more acceptable to Leonard, who began to feel an interest m the fate of this lovely girl, stronger than he had ever felt before, while he was yet at a loss to define whether it could be nghtly denominated love Willmot engaged the hnnd ol Lady Jnne for the evening She was much delighted with the compliment, and m such unusual good spirits, that she extended her kindness to Azclia, and selected a iarıpty of the most becoming ornaments, to adorn her with She gazed on the gay throng with a wistful eye Lord Haverford danced with a Merchant s daughter, and seemed wholly negligent of his fair bnde elect, but Leonard insisted on her attempting to go »p a dance with hmi, assunng her that, with a little attention to the figure, and some degree of confidence, slie would do as well as
as many in the room, whose inattention was far less excusable than ignorance " Your rank said he, ' will pi ocure j on attention from the rest and when you blunder, it will be attributed to carelessness, which is now so much the ton and your ear is natuially too good for you to be much out of time " Thus encouraged, Lady Azelia suffered hereelf to be led up, nnd acquitted herself greatly to the satisfaction of Willmot, while her uncommon loveliness of person ob¬ tained her the admiration of all the gentle¬ men , among whom Sir Lawrence Loiter solicited her hand in the next dance As she thought proper to refuse this, saying it was not her intention to dance any more, he fixed himself bv her side for the evening, and enteitained her with a variety of anecdotes concerning different persons in the company " Observe that couple," said he, pointing to a showy fashionable woman, who walked past,

" Really you have an excellent chance of finding him in London. Why, chiltl, it is a little lvpi-ld." " Aye, but," replied Lady Azelia, " it is Captain Wiilmof, an oflicer in the army." " Of what regiment ?" asked lier com¬ panion, drawing nearer. " Tliat I am ignorant of; hut I dare say I shall line! him. I tliought every body would know him." " Is he a tall handsome man, with dark eyes ?" "Oh,ycs!" cried Azelia, joyfully ; "and such a beautiful set of teeth!" " Well, well," returned her interrogator, " fortunately for you, Miss, 1 know him very ıvetl. He is. indeed, one of niy best customers, and I would do any thing to serve him. To be sure, he is rather back¬ ward in his pay; but then, Lord, he never cares what a thing comes to, and, as I teîls my husband, such people ought for to be encouraged.

" Not very long, Ma'am ; but he is known by my family " " Well, now, this is very huky , to lie suie, how things docs happen If you hadn t met me, you might have hunted long enough , foi going to seek any one in the 'tiopolis, is like looking foi a needle in a bottle of hay, as they say " Azelia thought beiseli a most foi tunate gnl She had no doubt but that Willmot would marry hei directly, and was too lgnoiant of established foims to scruple offeung heiself to him She accordingly, without mentioning paiticulai ririum- stantcs, made hei expectations known to her companion, who expressed perleet raptuie at having α ' (ingei in the pie," as she tei med it " Well," she exclaimed, " tins is funny enough ' fegs, I didn't tlunk Captam Witt- mot a marrying man, but ' needs must, when the denl duves,' 1 suppose You hai e loped to lum, I dare sweai " Azelia blushed. She was unused to n si labi mte
fabricate untruths, but she feared Willmot would be displeased if she told every cu¬ cumstance, as he had often corrected her for speaking without e aution, and shewas partly helped out hy her busy fnend " Well, your parents will be in a fine taking I wanant ' " I hai e no pirents," said Azelia " Ah ' well so much the worse for you, ray dear Ma) I ax your name ?" " Azelia, Ma am " " Azeler' What ruukuni crankum name is that ? I nex« ι heaid nothing like it.

I know a famil) ol that name ' " J hey call mc by this name at home," said Lady Azeha, " it is a Christian name " " No mattei for that, Miss,' said her inquisitor, unwilling to appear ignorant, " they often call children improperly Now, for instance, my name is Marthn, yet they
they always called me Patty, which is as different as chalk from che<se " But that is very wrong ' • It is thild, but it is of little conse¬ quence to you the Captain will soon change youi name—he he ' Mrs Willmot will sound a vast deal prettier—he, he ' Azelia thought so too, and was willing to be tailed any thing till then When they came to the inn, Mrs Nelson ( \zeln s new friend ) insisted on carrying her bundle, observing that her pretty little dog w is a sufficient incumbi ance , adding that as the evening wis far advanced, the Captam might not be at home and she was welcome to a bed at her house till morning when thej would go logethei to his lodgings To this Azelia gladly agreed, drew hei puree from her pocket paid the coachman his demand, and then attended the obliging Mrs Nelson lost in astonishment at the bustle she beheld around hei—theiegulai and bulhant appeaiance of the lamps, and the showy decorations of the shops 4^ u 3 The
The lesidence of Mrs Nelson was in а small street neai Westminster Abbey Mr Nelson was already at home waiting the return of his wife to whom the good woman introduced our heroine as Miss Hazely and Azeln could not help smiling at the contiast which this ι oiiple presented Mi Nelson was barely file feet high in ciicumference about four His fare was tolerably good-looking and of а eheirlul г ist his shaip little grey eyes took an necurate suncy of his guest, while his wife related the particulars of their acquaintance He welcomed Azelia with much civility, and began to be very facetious on the subject of her approaching wedding Two girls, one of them about twelve, the other about sixteen appeared at supper fhey weie apprentices to Mrs Nelson, and, with three thildren who weie in bed, two cats two small buds and a parrot, consti¬ tuted the establishment of Mrs Martha Nelson, Гапсу Dress Maker, Embroideress, He Mis Nelson expatiated with much egot-îa*

should be very happy in your company ; but I was going to say that you must not let Mre. Nelson see you in tears, as it always makes her angry when she thinks people are dissatisfied." " Is she kind to you ?" asked Azelia. Miss Alwyn hesitated ; then said—- " Yes; she is very good, but rather strict." Azelia, not wishing to appear curious, and, in fact, not feeling very much so, ceased to inquire further, got into bed, and her companion soon fell asleep by her side. In the morning Azelia rose enrly, full of expectation and pleasing hope. As soon as they had taken a hasty breakfast, Mrs. Nelson set her girls to work ; then sent for a coach, as the day was wet, and Captain Willmot's lodgings at some distance, and dressed herself to accompany her young guest. By the time all this was arranged, it was eleven o'clock. Less than half an hour's ride brought them to Southampton- street, Bedford-square. Mrs Nelson u 5 inquired.
inquired for the Captain Hc was then ming, and she was asked her business " Oh," cned she smartly, " the Captain need not think I am come upon money business now, it is quite another guess sort of matter Tell him I have brought a voung lady to him, aje and no less α peison than his wife that is to be " " No, no, pray do not sai so ' cried the abashed girl, " only tell С iptim W 7 ıl!mot that Lady Л /cha wishes to speak to hnn, and tliat will bc sufficient ' The sériant, with something like a bow hut more of a titter, left theroom, and Mrs Nelson, half petnfied turned to hci companion, exclaiming— Lady' Mystärs' Is your J ıdıshıp a I adv '" Azcln could not http smiling ' 1 haie been usually called so,' said she, but I did not know it w as any maik of merit " " Will, ' returned Mrs Nelson " 1 never saw а lady with so little pride in my life , and
and I have waited on many in my time. To be sure, theieis I ady Virginia Denmoie, and her lamily, besides a few others, ailable enough, but, Lord, they haie a little family pude too " Just then the door opened, and Captain W ilhnot entered Azeha advanced eagerly to meet him , but no soonci beheld a stianger, lhan she retreated in great con¬ fusion " My senant has brought me a con¬ founded odd message, said the Captain , ' md had it not bei n so soon, 1 should imagine the frllow dumk What is the occasion of tins caily usit lo me, Nelson, and that beautiful quond un Lady attending you ? ' I m sure I don't know, ' said Mis Nel¬ son, quite disconceited, "whether it is a quondam Lady or any other Lady, but she called heiself one, and said she was coming to be mai ned to you " " Taith, I am infinitely obliged to the. y oung Lady," returned he, " and, were I и li inclined
inclined to enter into any such engagement, should baie no objection to treat with her, but I cannot, seriously speaking, flatter mjself that I am the person whom she designed to honour with her fair hand " Lady Azelia now took courage to speak— " I am overwhelmed with contusion, Sir, at this mistake, and hardlv know how to explain it, paiticulars haic been so much exaggeiated by this gentlewoman I did, indeed, expect to find in Captain Willmot a particular and well-known friend I need not say that with you, Sir, I am wholly unacquainted, and I am extremely son y for the trouble my error has occasioned Being a stranger to you, my pretensions to the tlllt I have assumed, can bc of little consequence Perhaps you will hai e the goodness to inform me, if you know of an j other officer of your name ?' Azelia had never spoken with so much dignity, or so much to the purpose before ; and the Captain, convinced bi the natural supenority of her manner that she had been
been accustomed to genteel society,listened to her with great politeness, assured her he did not, but if she made any stay at Mrs Nelson's, he would not ful to let her know, should he hear of such a gentleman Ihev then departed, Mrs Nelson very much dissatisfied with the ill success of her morning négociation , and, when Willmot entered mto the routine of his fashionable engagements, he ceased to thmk of his cmbioidcress, the quondam Lady, or that theie was any other Captam Willmot m the world but himself As they ıetuıned, Mrs Nelson was very inquisirne to know the family antl con¬ nections ol her ι isitor, but Lady Azelia, grown cautious by the adventure of the morning, merely said that it was of little conséquence She wished for no dis¬ tinction m hei family, but if she would sufier lier to remain a few weeks, till she rould settle some plan for her future con¬ duit, she would make everv propei return, J and
and wished still to continue by the name she had borne at first Mis Neison replied that for certain she did not like sham gentlefolks, but as she seemed a well bchaied young lady, she had no objection to hei staying, as she had no othei fi lends in town, till Captain Willmot was fonili! and as her husband was a queei bod/, they ivould only say that a mistake hat! been m tde, and the right С tptain would he in town in a few days Го this ainiigcment »\ieha agieeel, and pci fei t good-humoui vvas restored betn een »hem Lord Haveiforel hail the patience to wait three eiays in town, making eiery mquuy to iio purpose, at the expiration of which period Capt un Willmot ìeturned Alfred, ivilhthe utmost petulance, hastened to the coffee-house where he knew he usually resorted, and returned the cordial salutation of Leonard with— "I have
" I have no time for compliments.

my friend, would not be answered by remonstrances only, but the respect I bear to your family, Lord Haverford, in¬ dependent of personal regard, induces me to act with caution in an affair which you seem to hai e misconceived ; and to request a more methodical explanation of what you would resent " This coolness provoked Alfred beyond bounds " No, Sir, it is for deliberate villany to bc methodical, 1 .am an injured man, and look to you for repaiation, which you would baffle by mean eiasion and cowatdli/ altercation " " Take back your woids, my Lord, or I must no longer forget-that I am a gentle¬ man and a soldier ' " Remembei both then m an hour s time," said Alfred " I will meet you at the Ring, in the Park " " Very well," was Leonard's reply. His mmd was bewildered by the sudden¬ ness of the affair From what Lord Haierford
II nerförd had said, he concluded that Lady Azelia had eloped, and it was suspected with him No protestation of innocente would aiail with the hot-headed young man, and concern for the fate of the poor girl, whose impmdence had caused this misunderstanding powerfully affected him Sir I awrence Willmot had left him sole heir to his last possessions, and Leonard now had the task of making his own will, in case the event of the day should be fatal to him He divided his newly-acquired fortune equally between Lady Azelia and Miss Bently, observing, with a sigh— " Many are the vicissitudes of this life ; Lady Azelia, though an heiress, mav by villany be defrauded of her due, or, .11 temporaiy embarrassment, may, by di¬ minishing her own fortune, find this be¬ quest of value, and the amiable Miss Bently will surely fee! giatitude to the man who has lontributed to her happiness with the objett of her affection '" for he enter- tamed not a doubt that want of fortune was
was the chief obstacle to her union with Sir Lucius Amamore This business hastily airanged, Willmot repaired 'o the place of assignation Alfred was not taidy He fned, and Willmot fell, seierely wounded The sight of his blood shocked Loid Haveıfoıd He remembered his many acts of kindness, md felt he had been too lash Instead of flying, he ap¬ proached his fuend, und assisted the surgeon to bind his wound, while the other second bought his own tairiage through the paik, in which they placed him Willmot entreated the nflnir might be kept as secret as possible, and then, after heanng the particulars from Alfred, which he before refused to explain, assured lum, ¡n the most solemn manner, that he knew not where Lady Azelia was concealed , but would, if he lived, assist him m the most diligent search and advised lnm, mean¬ while, to baie an advei tisement nisei ted in most of the ρ ners This was accoid- Higl) done The ball was safely cxtiacted·. which

CHAP. X, Love at Cross Purposes — an Alarm — an Heiress metamorphosed—and a Party of Pleasure. Transporting our ideas to Bently Lodge, we will imagine we see the. good old ladj and her daughter seated at each side of the fire, with a work-table between them. Mrs. Bently is making some shirts for
for poor widower in the village ; Anastatia netting a purse for Sir Lucius " I wonder,' said Mrs Bently, smiling, " why thou dost keep looking towards the window, child ? It is a gloomy evening, and hath no temptation to wnlk, I never saw thee so idle " " I am not idle, Mnmraa,' returned Anastatia, " nor have I any desire to walk, but I often thmk I henr the sound of horses' feet in the path " "We often fancy what we wish, daughter, perhaps that is thy tase Dost thou expect any one, child ?" " No, Mamma, but I thought it would be pleasant if we had some society, now the eienmgs begin to grow long, to lead to us, or chat, and tell us a little what passes m the world " Perhaps we may be as well without that knowledge, Anastatia, but methinks it is long since we had a visit from Lucius ' " Yes, Mamma I was thinking so too , and Captam Willmot seems to have for¬ gotten us " Mrs
Mrs Bently raised her eyes to her daughter, who dropped her s on liei work " Aye, now the truth is come at last Well, child, thee hast no need to be ashamed of thy sentiments, I know they are pure as innocence, and gratitude is not a senti¬ ment thou shouldst blush for " " Indeed, Mamma, I should have thought as well of Captain Willmot, even if he had not done me that service, for his manners nre so pleasing, his conversation so in¬ teresting and his countenance so open, that I touid not but like him " " I hope thou dost not love him ?" said Mrs Bently, seriously, and the way m which she spoke, mnde it seem a question Anastitia wns much embairassed, and was some time befoie she could speak If gratitude, esteem, and admiration combined, do not compose love, I think I am free, moie I will not nssert " " Thou art my own candid child, still, I find," cried the good mother, embracing her , " but beware, my girl ' check the warmth

" Welcome, worthy friend ' thou wert even now the subject of our com ersation " " I was greatly honoured, Madam," re¬ turned Willmot, bowing on the band she extended to lnm " 1 hope that is but the fashionable phrase foi saying thou art glad We primitive Christians are not used to the teremonious foims of speech ' " May ceremony be ever banished where friendship finds room ' ' replied Leonard, seating himself beside Anastatia, who hnd not yet ventured to speak, and, addressing hei, continued—" I would gne a tufle to know how you have been using me in my absence " Only as a deserter deserved, ' said Anastatia, " striking his name from the list, and putting it in the black book " " Thai is better than being superseded," said Willmot, significantly, " but it is very mortifying to think that I have been in the room ten minutes, and yet you hai e

ΤΤΤΗΓΝ Woodvile so abruptly left Wood- ' * lands, he had, as Dc-Chfiord supposed, been called to Grafton by а letter from Ыь steward, on some ch igrecable emergency of his alïairs It was night before be got there for though b) fits he had rode fast, his horse had often, for miles together, moved a foot¬ pace, without his being aware of it The moon rose before he entereet the vast forest m which ¡us seal is situatei!

It is so rich and gloomy, and contains so much of the gorgeous splendor of more pompous days, and an inci¬ dent or two so interesting passed there, that I am exquisitely delighted with our morning's employment. The vaulted roof oi* carved woodwork, adorned with roses, acorns, and other figures of burnished gold, interspers¬ ed with the arms, crests, badges, and cog¬ nizances of the Cliffords, and their alli- \ anees, shews at once, at whose expence that part of the building was erected. All the windows
133 windows arc, without any breach whatever, adorned with the most beautiful painted glass, many parts of which are principally arms, bul scripture stories are in others intermixed ; and figures, very large, of warriors and women in rich dresses, their surcoats and mantles co¬ vered with all the pompous badges of chivalry, often in the attitude of prayer, beseech you to say a paternoster for thtir souls, it put mo some¬ thing in mind of our old family church at Non> auiiY*; you remember there « The storied windows richly dight Casting a dim religious light." " You remember also the epitaph on my ai> cestor, the old judge f, and the numerous beau¬ tiful altar-tombs, and memorials of our family, with which İt İs adorned.

138 love such nn object ' And what ecstacy pass¬ ing human it must be, to be lov ed bj suc b an ange! as she ıs ' Yet there seems some cause of bitterness mixed with thia cup of bliss, of which I am not at present aware Tbe lovely girl is certainly unhappy I cannot thmk it possible that she receives not a return from such a bemg as Woodvile " Tbe remaining contents of the church I shall not be ^o particular about, for my mmd from this time was so occupied with the in¬ teresting discovery I had made, that X did not continue to tike the same minute notice There is a heavy and expensiv monument of а figure m armour kneeling at a desk, opposite to his wife, under an arch richly ornamented, and supported by Corinthian pillars, for one of the family wbo was a distinguished soldier in the Netherlands and a friend of Sir Philip Syd¬ ney, with some long and tedious verses, but this strange mixture of Grecian and Gothic architecture always displeases me Another of an ancestor, who represented the County m Challes II's days, a recumbent figure, m bis great wig, and formal coat, resting on his side,
139 and supporting lus head on his elbow, (as if m contemplation on a sofa,) is of a style still more disgusting. But this is the fault of the times, not ofthe famdy taste. Asimple black marble recording the affecting case of a Clifford, who fell for Charles I m the cıvıl wars, pleased me infinitely better. The simplicity of one mo¬ dern epitiph delighted me, I will therefore ¡¡end it} oit.

181 knew not herself its seriousness or extent, and though she had sometimes indulged indis tinct hopes of a mutual passion, yet she had never gravely reflected on its tendency, and considered images of the future associated with him rather as momentary dreams of her fancy, than as matters of reality Besides, she had been habituated to consider herself as still httle more than a child She therefore could scarce believe her eyes in reading the certainty and particularity of Woodvile's writ¬ ten declarations, and still when she gravely acknowledged them to be real, new doubts alarmed her, she was perplexed how to act, and knew not whether to answer it, or if she did w hat to say At length the pen, ink and paper that were constantly ready by her (who made so much use of them,) favoured a mo¬ mentary resolution, and she hastily scribbled as if fearful of herself, the following lines " My beloved Woodvile, " Yes, beloved, I have involuntarily writ¬ ten the word, ana I will not be such a prude as to wash it out, even with my tears, for dear indeed

185 she began to recover herself, she grew sick at the thought of the solemn things tint had passed, and almost wished lhe whole undone again However, at last witb a most palpi tatmg heart, e)es that scarce saw, and tegs th it trembled so under her that they seemed hardly able to support her, she descended the stair case, when, on opening the door, the first figure which met ber tyes at the brcdkfast- lable was that of Sk Peter Lumm Thu added to her confusion, she now walked up ihc room without being able to distinguish another object, and sat down m the first chair she could meet with Woodvde happened to be silting nearly behind it, but perceiving her extreme distress, he purposely, for some moments, avoided attracling her notice, till as she accidentally put her hand on some oc¬ casion behind her, be seized it unperceived by the company and pressed it so, that look¬ ing round, her eyes instantly met his, and such an expression rose iti the countenance of both at once, that there seemed an inter change of their very inmost hearts Mrs De- ClilTord, always on the watch, caught their looks, and understood loo much of them Sir Peter Lumm, though jealous of the presence of

201 off his own reflections, towards Woodlands, and about eight in the evening, it being a bright moon-light night, arrived within the ptrrk gate He thence went, not without much trepidation, to the house, and placed himself under the window of Mary's bed¬ room at tbe side of the house, where he saw ii light After listening some moments, be thought he heard a tender voice like hers, as if repeating to herself, and saw something like α figure at the window He gently called (be name ot Mary, but nobody answered He repeated it An affrighted voice asked who calls meî" "Mary 1 " —he repeated, with the bope she would recollect the tone She heard the trample of his feet, and open ing the window, looked out " Mary," he ened fearfully, " it is Woodvile calls you '" —" Good Heavens t" she replied, almost breathless, " how came you here ?

A night of intolerable anguish did he pass at nn mn about four miles of!, while Mary's feelings, though by no means so full of de¬ spair, were, however softened by moments of luxurious reflection, altogether agitated and wretched. About seven o'clock the next morning, bitzherbert was waked by his servant with a letter m his hand, which, on opening, he found to be from Woodvile, stating bis ip pointed meeting with bir Peter Lumm, and icepiestmg from the necessity of the case the favour of his attending him to the held Fitz¬ herbert though m much concern, and for some moments in doubt whether he ought not to h t De-Chíľord into the secret, )et as no time was to be lost, determined on the whole to save him the distress ot sucli a com¬ munication As soon therefore as he was dressed, he set off for the inn, whence Wood- v lie's note was dated, and found Inm there, ex¬ ceedingly calm and dauntless as to his meet- uig with Sir Peter, but evidently distracted al¬ most to madness, whenever the idea of Mary De-CliiTord was brought before his mind.
208 lhey soon arnved at the appointed com¬ mon Sir Peter Lumm and his friend were not behind the countenance of the iormer expressing revenge, though bv no means mixed with fear Woodvde looked calm, jet solemn, fully sensible of lhe awful crisis, yet undaunted, treating his adı ersary with a collected pity, which at once united con tempt and forgiveness The preliminaries settled, the dreadful moment came They both fired together Sir Peter was wounded in the arm but Woodvile --------- alas' the amiable and inspired Woodvile, was shot through the heart, and turning a countenance of inexpressible anguish on Fitzherbert, he half uttered the beloved name of Mary, but could no more—and hu. mighty soul fled toa place, for which it was better fitted I cannot attempt to describe the remainder of this affecting scene To those who feel as I do, the recital would be too terrible to give pleasure I will just add that Fitzherbert, whose agonv was too bitter almost to bear, sent for De Clifford, and that the two fnends together had him conveyed to the neighbour¬ ing mn from whence be came, and thence,

as soon as the dreadful business could be broke to Ins family,) to Grafton, where Ins melancholy corps was placed in repose amongst his ancestors, and surely since the first rise of that illustrious famdy, none more amiable, none who deserved an higher fame, were ever placed m that awful receptacle Thus by this barbarous custom of duelling, whereby the fool and the wise, the guod and the bad are placed pon a looting, was ex¬ tinguished the male line of the truly noble family of Woodvile Grief in six months brought to the grave his excellent mother And I know not that his sweet sister Elinor will ever recover her health Sir Peter Lumm was conveyed to his own house, and after his wound was dressed, fled for the Continent, where he stdl remains an unhappy e\de Bui as to the family at Woodlands, the grief u has caused there is such, аз can afford

Mary meanwhile had al¬ ready suffered too mach in her feeling« and her tender frame, having caught a violent cold from lhe last moonlight interview A slight fever had for some days confined her to her room, which hid enabled tbem to con¬ ceal the fatal event thus long from her Dur mg this time her dreams had been wild and distracted, and tbe musings of the day iull of melancholy presages At last the general noise this event had made over the coutirry, and the lamentations it brought forth ro all tbe public prints, and ali privale conversations (for now that poor Woodvile was gone, even those who envied and hated lnm before, saw his virtues and bis talents, winch " brightened as they took " their
Üli their flight/ )—together with the continual tpiestions that sweet Mary was putting to her brother regaiding him, at u time his own af fhclion was by far too overpowering It en¬ able him, even for her sake, at all tunes to evade Ihem, made it necessary to open the dreidful secret to her Tins aflectmg task fell upon Mrs De-Chiford the did it with all the tenderness, and ail the exertion slie could command but tbey were all vain the narratio? was too much ior the heart of Mary slie tnstuntly fainted, -and thence fell mto fits, which were succeeded by a delirious fever, from whence she never sufficiently recovered to possess her intellects For more than a week her iife was not ex¬ pected from iiour to hour, at length the (ever gradually subsided, and she seemed to grow much better But the rambhngs of her mind were exquisitely dreadful she called on the name of V» oodvile, sht talked to bim, she uttered such divine tenderness regarding him, she wrote such heavenly verses, yet so wild, that no persons who bad the least touch of sensibihlv, could bear to hear her, without hav ing
212 having their hearts almost broken During this time her person, which generally wore the expression of an inspired melancholy, but was »ow and then dressed up with α wild gaiety, was often more beautiful even than before Fitzherbert, whose fancy seemed, (from the horror of having been a party m the tragical event, nnd the grief at Mary's situa tion,) to be also not a httle tleranged, having always admired her as the most perfect ot human beings, now appeared to increase in his adoration, and enjoyed nothing so much as talking and weeping with her But they were not suffered to be much together, for it seemed to make botb worse AU De-Clifford's friends, particularly Hun¬ gerford, Bromley, Taylor, and Berney, who had spent the last autumn at Woodlands, were unusually affected with this horrid mis¬ fortune They all came continuallj to enquire after Mary, but no one of them, though all determined to undergo it, could support lhe shock of an interview It left such unmingled sadness upon their imagination, as their lives probably will not wear out Hei

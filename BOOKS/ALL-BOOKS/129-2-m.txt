J'hus encaged, he nothing regarded the blank aspect of Ercolam, when he came to announce the readiness of din¬ ner, but, with a light step, followed to a handsome apartment, where was ι table delicately covered, to which he seated himself with the Marquis and the Conte Had his wits been less engross cd with the forementioned impertinent concerns, he might have suspected in the complaisant suavity of the latter, some lurking intent, hostile to himself, is it was clear that their antipathy was too extensive for union, even in pohtc-

The dinner invitation, seemingly so in¬ consistent, was, in reality, contrived by the adroit author of all this mischief, w ho knew too well his own ingenuity, to tear the certainty of confirming the Mar¬ ques in hi» ill opinion of the Italian's in¬ tegrity, by straining every look, word, or motion of the latter, to in evil inter¬ pretation.

Villany. And keen were the Italian's pangs when he remembered how nearly they had escaped the toU, but for their ovi n folly w hich entangled them ; and hmv slightly they had attended to the good priest, w hose curiosity concerning Pierre was succeeded by that adventure at the ferry. His own misforiun»s Claudio saw to be derived from his inteifercnce in those of Henri, for their present event had risen in natural progression. He tndiavoured to employ the few hours bifore his execution m meditative ab¬ straction ; but Jus mind was not so gently to be divorced from its w orldly interests. The aerial figure of the lost Camilla swam before him, and all his firmness melted in the warmth of his tenderness; nor was it the least poig¬ nant of his reflections, that the benefi¬ cence and the patronage ot Don Philippe should so profusely have been wasted. Ot the character which would outlive
hım he dared not think, but from wearied grief drawing stupid resigna tion, he resigned himself to hopeless apathy Towards th« deep of midnight, Claudio, prostrate on the floor, hag¬ gard and woeful, was disturbed by the trampling of ι scuffle outside his dungeon , it lasted but an instant, for a mournful groan bespoke its fatal finish in the death of a contender 1 he con¬ queror entering, discovered himself to be of Jul.an'e train, and the Cavalier ex¬ pected to sheath in his breast the bloody dagger which the ruffian clenched Great was his astonishment to hear himself directed to rise and follow ' He obeyed without repugnance, as death was inevitable, 'twas trivial to him where met, so, conducted by the man, he quitted the prison, at the mouth of which he saw the wretched guard, in the livery of the Marquis, wallowing m the fumul mire of his own blood In

dio, who approached with a statdy step and sedate aspect Julian at once saw the difficulty of his project, but the in variableness of his mind, in executing was only to be paralleled by its pre sumption in projecting dozing his tongue with guile, he depictured to the Italian every horror attendant on his situation, without slighting any aggra vatory addition which an exuberant fancy could nvent, or keen penetration derive from the emotions of so circum¬ stanced an auditor, artfully seeking to stifle the upbraidings and execrations his perfidy deserved, with the incite ments of terror and dismay but his drift wis disappointed, for Claudio being unsuspicious of aught but mah cious irony or barbarous exultation in this discourse, refused to gratify either, and, stedfast to his manly pnde, en deavoured to withhold the least token of feeling in those parts, at which the hardiest might naturally have trembled
Perceiving how ineffectual was this opening, Juh in tirtly iddcd,—" What, are you already rctoncilcd to ι vulgir deith and blasted reputation '" In spite ot control Claudio's de¬ meanor becimc disordered with indig¬ li mon, and he replied,—" As much is you d ire be to their intuition ' With 1 sevi re scomfulness, lulnn said,—" lbcn twbuld I с jitnble ti> avert voui ei tence, since me sunng your lepugnu e by mine, it seems ılı t death can nevei meet vou titter ргерт- cd" " Never ' crie 1 Chucho " İh. levcıer mv sufTenngs, the hırlın niv avengement 1 he first insure the I et- ter m your soul s per htton ' luhan was not to be outdone Ín be Id ness ot speech Bhsphcniv md didime long hid rtigncd upon hi tongue whether tl cy hid prtscnt solutes 111 his hem wis indisei vcriblt But tlure ire times when in the most h¡ ci lu il IOI 11 I

self-approral. But this triumph over the foible« of humanity was too un¬ natural to be of long duration. In the moment of exultation nearing to one of the windows, which overlooked a spa. cious court, how chilly turned his blood, when in the midst of it he saw an elevated platform ; and by the moonbeams which glimmered upon their steely points, the detestable ш- .chinery of torture. His limbs antici¬ pated the utmost cruelty or the rack, and his heroism fainted in the anguibh of his inujţination j so that Juliin, whether 01 t he had foreseen the cir- cumllancc, a. uld not have re-entered more opportunely. Advancing close to the Cavalier, he presented some folded papers which he had brought, saying,—" The sole term ef your instant freedom is the delivery of these letters according to their super¬ scriptions."

wMth have effected the disarming them of their formidable qualities, by stigma¬ tizing their minds with so excessive a ti¬ midity, that their apprehensions have ever inclosed them in that prison from which they at length were liberated: but it was particularly and sadly evidenced by the events of young Henri's misfortune. The voyage proceeded without inter¬ ruption for several days, being ordered with a most diligent caution on the part of the men to whom Henri was commit¬ ted. They solicitously avoided any oc cision wherefrom he might seize advan¬ tage to infoke succour and deliverance; but deluding him by their air of rude rnirth into a mean opinion of this vigi¬ lance, they allowed him to amuse his artxicty with a series of plans, which, however plausible when provided for remote casualties, were nevertheless im¬ practicable when brought to the trial. Such successive defeats to his heartiest expectations, of which one so interested
cannot be presumed an impartial judge, had the most arbitrary tffccts on his ju¬ venile disposition Unacquainted till now with the bitter¬ ness of disappointment, his spirits sunk beneath the burden of their increase in proportion as the hopes ot regain¬ ing his former prosperity diminished, he lost the fortitude requisite to sup port the derogatory reverse but being- too proud to expose this gncf to the observau an of the malmous keepers, he concealed it from them beneath a de nieanor of cold reserve, and an affected abstractedness m contemplation lie would sit for hours with his eves intent on the sun beams which floated on the w atcrs, till, dazzled with the glory, they closed in d irkness, and his brain, giddy with warmth of climate and passion, was on the verge of bursting into mad. ness but a pause of consideiation dis closed the futility of anv outrage, and
the ridicule which would follow had no slight tendency to suppress it As all projects, of which force was the foundation, seemed inadequate to the attainment of his wish, his natural and national impetuosity was so greatly humbled by this conviction, as at length to subside his mind, disengaged from its rash influence, pondered on the most probable modes of arriving at its object, and m the end determmed to forego its present haughtmess of carriage, and try the more promising, though less honour abl substitution of art and address A. this resolution may seem strange, m somuch that it misbecame a nobleman and a warrior, it must be considered, that his impatience of restraint was now great ly abated by its continuance, and there fore submitted with a better grace to unwind the intricacies of finesse for the spirit of a lion may be tamed m bonds, and that of the Chevalier partook more of passion than reason Besides, by ezpe
riencing a total disregard to other the pompous importance of his name, on which he had been taught to found pretensions to pre-eminence, or the achievements of his personal prowess, which ever had been reflected with a sy cophantic aggravation, he had gradually fallen m his presumption, till the osten tation of integrity, founded less on pnn ciple than arrogance, relaxed, temponzed with hu condition, and at length ceased any compunctious emotion which might disengage him from the pursuit of so disreputable a scheme But the evil was still more extensive Hitherto Henn had never been engaged in any independent action, therefore his mind was ill provided for contingencies, and now for the first time, being reduced to the resources of its own ingenuity, these, from their never yet having been brought into play, required a long exa¬ mination into their feasibility, so that after su h a discussion to adopt disho-

upon record, but the wider a deviation from rectitude the stronger should be the faculty, for craft, by those of under talents, will infallibly be found to be an instrument most galling to themselves So the unlucky Chevalier experienced, who, consonant withan unmanly maxim of prudential subtilty, stooped before the blast, but, by bending so constantly m one direction, lost his former spring and elasticity with every probability of their recovery But the greater this alteration in his sentiments, the greater his contentment, for his vivicity, which constitutionally was brisk, being kept in continual excr cise, inspired so constant a Sow of good humour, th it time glided by, and retro¬ spection taded on hi» sight With the idea of fulfilling his deceptive part, he voluntarily undertook little orlice» neces sary towards the wafture of the bark, and the diversion he derived trom thss »i

depended entirely upon the chance of their being w orthv for his own goodness. Chance now had turned against him, for during his familiarity with the ruffiani, he heard numerous details of exploits enacted by themselves and brethren. These caught his attention He gave ear with credulity, and as these stories partook of the perfidious and cruel, though enterprising dispositions of the relaters, they did him an essential injury. Overlooking the baseness and despair of the perpetrators, anil admiring only the boldness and hazard of the deeds, his lively imagination drew various pictures ot that man's aggrandisement in valor¬ ous reputation, who could achieve them then ever reverting with presumptuous egotism to his own intrepidity, he mea¬ sured it by that of a bravo, and from often conceiting himself in the situations he heard described, he began to imbibe much of that brutality which prevails among men of so desperate a profession
Thus he was hurned from an honour¬ able and exalted path of life, and by a coincidence of circumstances rendered, every hour, less deserving or able to re- gam and become it. Meintime the voyage was protracted bv frequent cessations at solitary places on the shore, and otherwise was con¬ du ted in so desultory and overcautious a manner, tint many weeks were con¬ sumed before the majority of the crew debirked, and, earrying the Cavalier in their comp my, turned towards the ea tern fromier lhey then performed as wearisome a journey through the country of Savoj Their solicitude for tiie secunty of their charge made them jealous of any neighbourhood that might endanger it, wherefore they pursued the most circuitous tracts for the sake of obscurity and secrecy seldom, but at the setting in of night, did they ad¬ vance into the populous vallies , and then they chose, with much precision

the fear of prevention, an accident which at once would distract lus scheme, by disclosing the artifice qn w Inch it depended, consequently w ould preclude any herealter probibility of an escape. He therefore ucdincd any at¬ tempt when he had a doubt of its suc¬ cess As he had been familiarized to fatigue and weather m his military capacity, he experienced but slight inconvciuency fr. in a long scries of trav elling beneath the inclemency of winter, which over took them on the way, as whole weeks were idled aw iy in places that suitetl, and his briskness being in const int oc cupation.tlved his cheeks with tlic rutl diest glow of vigorous health But now thcy had descended into the ample plains of Lombardy, and hail over passed a large space of the Mil mese It there was manifest, that no shower uf war had swept over, but a cruel hur¬ ricane , for the fields were waited, the

Henri had preconcerted the most pro- bal le meins of executing his intention, and, in providence for an opportunity, had for the list two or three days, affecfed to be much fatigued, and be¬ numbed by the Host, more particularly that morning His complaints com. pletely imposed on the guard, who even conveyed lnm on their shoulders the length of a furlong, and assured of his inability to flee, who scarcely could move a foot, they left him to his re¬ pose, while they withdrew to recruit their stomachs, and indulge in converse with the tenants of the house, by whom they were well known.

in the polishing and w hetting the blades of some stillette« he arose at this in trusión, but understanding its moflen ktveness, and importuned by supplica tions and promises most volully ut tered, he pointed towards a stair case The Chevalier conceived his meaning, and waving all ceremony of thanks га pidly ascended to an upper room, there, breathless and thoughtless, he flung himself along a coarse pallet He heard the voices of men below, and soon he recognized several of them Their tones were rear*y and f>r"iliar, anil, with painful solicitude, he hearkened to inquiries concerning himself A mi nute determined his fate, for before it could run out, he beheld himself agim n captive " Oho exclaimed his keepers, who enttred with a similar irony imprinted on all their faces, " your wishes we find have outrun your abilities or w as all this hurry only made to send j ou

The name of Ricardos strack Henri dttthb with consternation he looked attentivdy on the wretch so nominated, and he thought that he could unravel, in hn dark physiognomy, every linea¬ ment, expressive of the various malig¬ nities, barbarities, and treacheries which Claudio had represented ham to hive practised. The last speaker, seeing that Rirar los had perused the pipei, turned his at¬ tention frem the (hevilier, md asked, What was the news Irom the ( onte Ricardos, who was bee ime of impor¬ tance in the retinue ot Juhin, lephed, "Too serious to be friso usly spo¬ ken ot " " Hi ' saitl the other, " has there been any tubare at Ge¬ noa '" " I know not the particulars," an¬ swered Ricardos, " being dispatched homeward some time before the mme was sprung But as this letter wains mc that the Conte ıs returning, I ap-

' asked Ricardos The ansvvtr begot a discourse, which was conducted tt te a tete, till Ricardo«, af¬ lir having several times ejaculated the word Marquis, turned to the coarter m ho had brought the letter, and or ilered him to precede to the Castle
" Whither," said he to Henri's guards, " you also must go to commit your prisoner, but afterwards you must ac¬ company me to meet the Conte at a village one clay's journey distant, for, in crossing the neighbouring lordships, it becomes him to make a splendid parade ' He then signified his intention to ac company them to the Castle, for the purpose of providing horses and their furniture, and so ended a conversa tion througl sut unheard by Henri, w ho w is stunned by his own waitings As they walked very leisurely, they were about two hours in reaching the Castle At the end of that time they crossed the valley, on which opposite side it stood, mounted the gates, and applied for admission It w ıs granted with much ot that ceremonious cau tion established in fortresses under the apprehensions of a siege.

the passengers, but without shortening his steps, or turning his head, suddenly said, " Where do you lodge ?

profit, Claudio, aware of the deceit, detected his almost imperceptible com¬ merce w ith the travellen, and became assured from hu artt and address, that he was commissioned by some higher power to secure and instruct all of a cer¬ tain faction who entered in that quarter, and he doubted not there were others of similar appointment at every place of admission around the city By this developement of an individual, his cunosity was increased to penetrate into the main springs of so mysterious though extensive an affair, and he waited with a very . oor grace the setting in of night An open house of reception was very ill adaptetl for profound re sea r ches so the Cavaher was without the consolation of a specious surmise tül the close of day 1 he hour of elucidation being nearly come, the Cavaher threw his cloak over his shoulders, and hastened to the as¬ signation Hit ırpatıencc hurried him

They walked nimbly on, till they ar
rived in a part of the city apparently as¬ signed to plcbeiamsm and wretchedness; tor the streets were narrowed into aileyi, of which many were nearly impassable. The night spread a melancholy gloom mer the way, and the Cavalier, com¬ pletely unpractised m its difficulties, ex¬ perienced impediments where his guide trod with assurance and celerity 1 his wearisome track terminated in a vast assemblage of ruins 1 hese Claudio conceived to be the skeleton of a citadel, by which the French had formerly kept the citizens in subjection and awe, for they were surprisingly extensive and intersected by the branches of a half choaked fosse, over which it w ould have been perilous to cross, had not the guide providently brought phospho- lic matches, by which he kindled a lamp and warned Claudio of every local danţer 1 u weak rays of the light were soon reflected by a high and massy wall, wlWh
ran into darkness on either hand It bounded a budding of religious founda¬ tion, which, notwithstanding its attach¬ ment to the citadel,had escaped the wreck of that piece of despotism through the scruples of the Genoese, who would not permit its destruction, though they cleared it of its monachal tenantry Never restored to the holy purpose, it remained a relic of devotional tyranny, and an accusation of republican incon sistency, till recently it had become the haunt hole of faction Claudio and his precursor entered through a small door framed within the great gate, and passed along the dismal doisters The echoes of their footsteps, which floated on the breeze, served to warn those within ot their appi oach , tor a second door, scarcely distinguishable, was opened for their admission Being induded, the Cavalier found himself in total darkness, and every drop of pa¬ triotic blood turned cold within his
veins, when he was drawn forward by one, w.iom he understood was not him he hitherto had followed However, he proceeded a considerable way- without injury, for his leader seemed 'iti-nate with every step Each door the) ap¬ proached, was opened to a private sum¬ mons, but the porters were invisible, as indeed were all things At length they came to one door at the head of a steep ascent of steps, and here particu¬ lar cer mony procured them admission into a sort of anti chamber, dimly light¬ ed From its uncovered walls were sus¬ pended several long pikes and other in· struments of offence, belonging to men who rechned on benches around the room Claudio's guide did not loiter an instant, but went to the further eud of the room and quitted it Instantly he returned accompanied by another of a vulgar carriage whose face was masked When this man came near enough to distinguisi! the features

Meanwhile the Principal revised the let¬ ters, and at those passages whereof Claudio was the subject, an aich glance escaped from his eyes, from which, had the latter been distrustful, he might have augured that no very exalted mention was made of himself Indeed, he was pointed out for a pliant cool that might be made ot use in skilful

Sut the Principal knew tli« pride of 'uban, and its associate con tempt for every quality not congenial with his own, too intimatdy, to be easily prejudiced, and meeting with a manly figure ш the Cavaher, he courteously asked his name Fiction no Longer was neccssay, so he inge nuotisi) gave it Don Claudio tec Den Claudio repeated the mask, w I о had introduced and still stood near him Dm Claudio Hum ' inwardly inur inuring, while the secretaries w rote ľ down at the oud of a secret nomcnela ture.

to the wishes of a faction before the re. suit of then 1 ist interview After a slight desultory discourse, the Pnpcipal informed the Cavaher he had permission to withdraw. " We are acquainted with your lodgings, and it is our request that you will not quit them farewell 1 when next we meet, it is to forge bolls for the downfal ot usurpation Meanwhile beware' Dona has spies numberless as the motes m the sun's beams, and as subtle too in fastening on you Yet let not timid difiidcncc restrain you These, as you deserve, are your foes, or friends, able to revenge, or protect" And to evince his meaning, the visored conscripts arose, each in his place, and unmuffling, showed their bodies to be invested with mail, whde th"y rattled, in tremendous concert, the various figured blades of their destructive dag¬ gers. 1 he distrust and threats of noc- turnai conspiracy gleamed on their
bloodthirsty points, and Claudio with shudderings, departed. The same guide reconducted him to the place whence they sat forward. There they separated, and the Cavaher forthwith returned to the inn, and re¬ tired to his chamber He was not at all disposed to converse with his Squire, whose talkativeness being supplied by a novelty of topic was altogether ungo¬ vernable. As much to his own satis¬ faction as his master's annoyance, he began to expatiate on the disgrace and danger of Chrifcianity, while infidels were allowed to roam along the coasts and burden their gallics with booty. " Ay," continued he, "and to drag thou¬ sands into slavery , thousands of good catholics." A slurp pang wrung the heart of Claudio that heart which being the sanctuary of love, was ten¬ derly susceptible of every thing which could concern its idol Camilla was en¬ slaved. If there could exist a torture
more crud than that thought, eternal hell could alone inflict, the immortal soul alone could bear it. No common moisture glistened in his eyes ; and he buried himselt beneath the dothes on the couch. Ercolani went on uninterrupted, and the Cavalier at last found that his Squire had met with some fellow guests, who, representing themselves to be en¬ gaged to act against the niu.iulmen, h ul instilled into hiin their ow n fanati¬ cal neat. 'J he next morning the Squire renew¬ ed tbc subject, and was so possessed by it, as to be loth to discontinue, even when desired by his master, who had need ot his services. As far as was con¬ sistent with his allegiance to Claudio, he avowed an excessive eagerness to exalt the cross above the crescent. He protested he had dreamt of nothing else during the night but cleaving turbans ; and that he knew dreams came from God, for so Father Jeremy had told vol.. 11. ι
hun, when in one of his visions he made a devotional gift of three fat ew 's to the friar Besides, many affirmed a Mahometan's head to be as sure a pass¬ port to Heaven as the holy Pope's in¬ dulgence, perhaps surer, for the dif ficulty of procuring it enhanced the efficacy, and in Erco'am's esteem there was a much greater pleasure m smiting off the one, than in purchasing the other 'lhe Cavalier would have at¬ tempted to moderate this heat, had he been less engrossed by his own con¬ cerns , but wistful to fathom the inner most recesses of the plot, he prepared to go abroad, with hopes of some en lightening occurrence As he crossed the court to enter the street, he saw the Squire and his new companions earnestly engaged in talk, but much he was surprised to diseci n in the latter, three or four of those travellers w hörn he had remarked the day before, and w ho, he had imagined,
were in masquerade Tins now seem¬ ed very unlikely, and passing them with confused sensations of pity and amusement at the ardour of Ercobm, he began his perambulations. He examined many of those glorious edifices which, in the gral deur of its oriental tr?de, had been constructed to adorn Genoa, but the general misery ot plebeian houses represented a disgust¬ ing contrast between public and private conveniences The course of his pro gress bunging him to avvide estrade, he vus there impeded I ) a v ast con course of people, v.ho hid gathered on tithci side of a noble portico, which led to ι noble ι building, the) also lined the circumjacent streets lie inquued ot 1 b) stinckr the name and import of the place, and the occasion of so nume rous a crow d lhe citizen smiled till he saw the questioner was a stranger, ind then pohtei) rephed, that before them wis II pilazjta della Signoria, in

But bang dose to the angle of two streets, which opened into the squire, its advantages w ere momentary, for whenever any carriage drove by, the guards pressed backw írd upon the po¬ pulace, and wantonly threw them into danger and confusion. This was pi ict ¡sed several times to the diversion and ineensement of both parties. At length the Cavalier receiv cd so rude a shock that he angrily resist¬ ed : the soldier persevered, and he struck him. The brutal fellow threat¬ ened with his pike ; and stepping aside to his Ceimmand«», pointed t< v> ards the Cavalier for a man deserving chastise¬ ment. The latter"Sood firmly, when he felt his arm pressed, and turning hi« head, he pcrcdved close to him the
tame man, who so adnuribly had per- sonatcd the buffoon. " С onfound у our. self » ith the rest," said he, " or you may prove this dilemma a serious one " Claudio followed his advice, and re- treated behind the people, who opened a ready passage tor him with loud ap probation of lus spint " Ihese raw- boned Germans," said lus companion, whose harlequinade w as now the attire of a creditable artisan—" Ihese raw- boned Germani receiv e the pay of the Duke" " To lord it over the republic," add¬ ed a man who overheard.

" Why a single tilt of spears could destroy them," said \c other. " Psha '" continued the first, " ) ou are peculiar in thinking so, or would not a '3

The Cavalier perceived in the ear- cairns which thit man continued to ut¬ ter thé industriou* cnasemrnttion of tur· Went idea», whkk «ere the more fütty dtsphyed u circumstance» aflbrded op¬ portunity. At thb time the senatort began to piss in rapid succession, and the remarks which he made on each, being couched in a drollery of style, greatly amused and fermented the minds of the encircling populace. A kind of tumult forerunning the ap¬ proach of tome distinguished noble, he tald, " Ha! now comet the Duke's nephew. I know him by the uproar. Hark! trumpeta! Tet, he bray ι like an ass to conceal the tiger. See! he dis¬ dains to be outdone by any monarch in Christendom, so is drawn by right hirses. Eight horses! mark that, my friends : 'tis an unconstitutional num¬ ber. The Roman tyrants never drove
with more 'Tıs a badge of sovereignty — tıs an insult to the republic " The gorgeous carriage of Giannctino now rushed furiously along to the perilous discomfiture of the crowd. Ihe consequent bustle disappointed Claudio's attempt to see him, which he w as the more sorry for as he had heard the Dul indulgent nepotism a subject of universal censure But his argus of a neighbour, mindful to his effort, but ignorant of its failure, demaifded what he thought of him. Claudio confessed his inability to answer " Ah, Signor '" cried the other, " Genoa will not have such luck as for your loss to be irre tnevable. You 11 see him when he will return, and a gnm looking gentleman too But he esteems himself a complete Adoni and is not over complaisant in bestowing his caresses on such females as decline them In a word, he is as much a r urk in love as state, and were I a father, which, thanks to Heaven ' I 14
am not, I would calculate to a denari the worth of my daughter's honour, and carry my account to the teeth of the senate, which и the pandar to, while it in the sufferer of Dona's been stoutness." Perceiving that this speech had the expected effect, he cunningly affected to disclaim any senous thought, and laughingly added, " But what a foolish prattler am I to speak so lightly ·# the heir to the republic ' Nay, em¬ itas, do not stare' has «ot he its arms painted on the panncli of his carriage, as the insignia of hi» barthngbt ?

Young men must have their will ¡ and I am content that our laws should be baubles to divert him " Soon after thu conclusion, a cheerful murmuring ran through the crowd, and every body extended its neck as far at convenient for the earlier prospect of
what was coming It was a light open carriage, in which were two gentlemen ш the senatorial garb One of them smiled pleasantly on the shouting popu¬ lace , and the Cavalier tw ice looked belore he could persuade himself, th it he really was not any other than lnm he had seen, the night before, presiding over the committee of a faction " It there be a m 111 in Genoa that I love, cried the false artisan, " it is the Conte di Lavagna * '
'í
" Which is him ?" said Claudio. u He that now waves his hand, Sig· •or P' and be looked Intelligently on the Cavalier, who reflected on the dis· JUBulation which the Principal had in¬ stilled into the subordinate characters of hb plot. " But who is the other beside him ŕ" again questioning the artisan. " Oh, that is a green youth—Jerome Fiesco, his brother." " The Conte seems as wild and in¬ considerate as ever," observed a saga¬ cious looker on. " It is his disposition," cried the arti¬ san, whose modulations of tone, now loud, now soft, were certainly intended to decivé one class as much as to
arouse the other " It may be a faulty, but not a selfish one, for he witbe» to see the whole city as blithe as himself, or would his house be open to all comers, as ♦ will be to-night ? Clap a mask upon your face, and you may feast upon every delicacy All you pay is bughter and good humour, so that whoever has these need not be at any loss for a supper Oh, it's a noble fel¬ low ' I warrant the repubhc a true vote f om hım to day He is a gem in the aristocracy The word king is a thun dcrstroke in his ears And 1 have hcird from very respectable authority, that he strictly has forbad his domestics at all to salute him by his title for he says, my friends, Men only took foreign names when they grew ashamed of their natural ones ' This last information sympathised with the prejudices of the vulgar, and they unanimously began to laud their favourite in terms of familia- 16
rity which endeared him to them the more. Claudio give attention to whatever was dropped, and*fou»d that the same art by which Fiesco had stolen into favour with the people, blinded the statesmen to his machinations. His air of undesigning levity, by msking him the darling of the one without awaken- ing suspicion in the other, had thus be¬ gotten a twofold effect, either of which being wanted he would have remained without support or opportunity. In this man many would have sur¬ mised, that patriotism was not unalloy¬ ed by ambitious sdfishness ; but Clau¬ dio, though morally inimical to de¬ lusion, flattered himself that the object could ennoble the mode. Long before the usual hour of separa¬ tion the senate broke up, and its mem¬ bers thronged forth in a disorder which proved that all had not gone steadily within. A murmuring spread from

daautiotist even CbmcUo was caught by the stream of popular opinion, and as he walked homeward, he reflected, that the centering of the affections of an entuse people in one man, was beyond the powers of chance or human wis¬ dom , and only ascribable to a natural instinct, я hieb turned them towards him for deliverance and avengement With this idea, in which there was enough of catholic superstition to distinguish him an exception from cotemporary reform¬ ation, the Cavaher amused and indirai- led himself until the time of dinner. While he was dispatching this, f.rco- lani, whose long silence might be re¬ garded as ominous, abruptly asked, whether he thought a man at all ex disable m forfeiting bis word " You would not desire any one to call you a liar :" said Claudio " N— о '" replied bis tremulous ser¬ vant.
tt Then you must not make yourtdf one," continued Claudio This was the arbitrament of Ercola¬ ni's fate He burst into tears, and confessed that he had engaged him¬ self to serve in a Genoese galley, that was fitting for a cruise m search of the infidels Unexpected as was this intelligence, Claudio felt less displeasure than regret ) et w hen it occurred to him that his own entcrprizc might conclude in ruin, any circumstance seemed wdcome, w hich could prevent a vv orthy follower from participating in hs master s down- fal Wherefore he entered into a consola¬ tory discourse with Ercolani, during which the latter dried his eyes 1 he evening drawing in, Claudio pro¬ cured a mask and domino with intent to be present at the rout of riesco. Situ¬ ated a· he now wa", it would be highly neglectful to miss any chjuce of examin-
ing the bonds of combinat ют bemre they became indissoluble , and by watch¬ fully observing the Conte, he hoped to penetrate the nature of his designs Sim¬ ple idea' is if fiesco, the conspirant Fiesco, whose splendid wildnesi abke bad diaded the auzeas of Genoa and blinded her magistrates, was now to be scanned and developed by an inexpen enced warrior, whose integrity of heart was the rein to his imagination ' l'he Cavalier found the palace di 1л vagna, as he had heard, open for every one's admission It was an august edi fice, and m every part amply witnessed the wealth and refinement ot the ) outh ful owner » He passed to the grand hall, w Inch was splendidly illumined by variegated lamps pendent from the gilded architrave a band of menials in shining liveries were dispersed up and down, and one ot them, remarlung the gentility of the Cavalier's appearance, showed the way to the suite
of apartments appropriated to the nobler guests, and ushered him into a gorge¬ ous saloon The beauty of the surrounding scene surpassed anything of the kind Claudio had ever known or imagined. It re ahzed the hitherto visionary romance of tairy fabulists, and its enticements were the lcthe to each careful thought like a magK circle it excluded all allay, whirl· ing with continual change of pastime, The company, in grotesque masqu*. rade, were disjointed into characteristic groupes. The holy pdgnm sad the mailed knight, the pastoral Arcadia· and arch Savovard, heathen pnests and priestesses, buttions and magnifico'!, oriental pomp and ЬассЬалаЬап nudity, were laughingly contrasted. Courtship and revelry distinguished the carnival of deified love and wine, «nd those who thought themselves slighted by the first, fled for solace to the second. From the frequent exercise of this resource, Clau-
dio, had he not better known the con. ;ntutions of hit countrywomen, might have imagined them unnaturally crud and austere to thar gallanti; but the plaintive madrigali which now were sung in harmonious concert with the pipe or ctthern, breathed a tenderness of spirit completdv discoverable of the truth. However, the Cavalier being rather an enterrer tkan a partaker in the sports, at ktngth sanded them to be wearily mo- notonoua; and in their defiance the per. tnrbataoti of kb mind returned its habi. tnal tenor. Unpractised in festivities, and irrccoMakable tothe idleness of pro. aaiacmia gallantry, by the indulgence of which he would have nppoaed hit de- voted a tiD ct i o iit to be violated, hewan. dered '.hrough the room* a mournful cxetpjon from the giddy throng. So innen he wat engrossed by the grandeur of hit own designs and expectations, that he contemned every ftivoiout allure-
ment, disengaged himself from thenng of revellers, to whose glee his gravity seemed a reproach, and betook himself to another room. Here he breathed the true air ot sen¬ suality. Blooming wreathes of flowers, in which art was the mockery of nature. intersected the emblematical characters of vividly tmted lights, in the composi¬ tion of which aroma tics had been lavishly mingled Spiral pillan, which slender- nets teemed the inadequate support of, an airy corridor, ranked in uniform co¬ lonade down the tides $ and through im¬ perceptible venti ш these a cloud of frarikincente evaporated.

throng, which opened a wider field for contention, anxious to be witness, yet not to incur itt consequences, while Claudio's protégée, as though she dread cd an implication in his punishment, withdrew her arm and forsook him The Cavaher, »lone composed m this confusion, turned upon his heel after punishing the causer of it, but Gıanne¬ ııno ш a paroxysm of fury reeled to¬ wards him, and by a manoeuvre which might hav e distinguished an ambidex¬ trous pugd, grasped hu hair with one cowardly hand, whde the other dealt a mower of blows upon his chest Had the Cavaher worn his sword, this affray would have come to a bloody issue, but abhorringsoruman hkea style of duel, he determmed not to strike a second blow , accordingly he exerted every musdc to invigorate the first, dashing his elbow into the stomach of his adversary, he in dieted a two-fold stroke by the same ef fort, for his fist, in an impetuous whirl,

Fiesco calmed him on that subject, and asked the name of his Squire, when he heard it, he mused a moment, then taking a scroll from a scrutotre, he shewed such a name to be entered mto the list of the adventurers w ho were en¬ gaged on board hu gallies " Your *er- i ant, said Fiesco, " and two thousand more, men of gallant mien, are mine ; ind, m behalf of you and I and alt shall be emp'oyed Religion then shall оме iui services ' Claudio surveyed hım with joy and admiration, but the Conte pleading bis duty to entertain his guests, warmly re¬ commended obscurity, and retired The VOL· и к
man, w ho had retreated to a respectful distance, now came up to the Cavalier, and offered him a long dark cloak the latter threw aside his festive garb, and followed through the palace, which they quitted, by a secret gate Before mid¬ night Claudio took possession of his new lodgings. It u already explained through what drcutrutances the man, Claudio dis¬ tinguished by the name and epithet of robber Julian, became possessor of the dignities and terntones eh Fiascano. Be¬ fore this fortune he was undistinguished in the world, but, over his associates, he hdd the supremacy, and, while they rioted in fancied licentiousness, no thral¬ dom could be stronger riveted than what Juhan entangled them in lhey were the devoted slaves to his will, his spirit actuated them, and, like the monster Briarcus, he could strike a hundred blows m the same instant.

the towering Alps, the Adige, and the I ake di Garda, raised hım to great im¬ portance among the terrene nobility of Venice, but, as promotion in the state was not to be expected, he the more willingly embraced the proffers of the Conte di Lavagna, whose artful bram had teng revolved the destruction of his country's liberty and governors, in order to accderate his own sove¬ reignty The accession of Julian, who was al¬ most the only one acquainted with his real view s, was gained by brilliant and unlimited promises, given, perhaps, with little integrity at first, but after¬ wards really intended, for Fiesco soon feared to practise deception where it w as so little likely to succeed, and felt besides, a sensation of inferiority and dependance, which forbad him to of¬ fend or lose his new auxiliary But, as their intimacy straitened, this mis¬ trust and envy faded Never were two »■ 3

Indeed, he un¬ derwent a dolcsomc seclusion from the
world, and his avidity to re-enter it caused him moet ardently to desire the maturity of those plans, which were (honourably he fancied) to promote his gratification The late incident was sur¬ prisingly adapted to interest him in the success of 1 plot, of which his dispas¬ sionate investigation might have de¬ tected the real deformities The Gallic intervention was a measure which every unprejudiced Italian should have opposed with abhorrence, for the insatiable am¬ bition of the irench had overrun Italy with shoals ot military foreigners, who, although they were hostile in nativity, language, manners, and service, were unanimous to devour the good of the country a procedure wherein they were fatally instructed by the renegade poli¬ cies of intestine factionancs Besides, Frenchmen for some years had been ob¬ jects of religious horror to all Europe, owing to their impious invitation to the lurk to increase the destructive t nple
wart of those times, by doing which to the desired extent, he might have gained a lordly ascendant throughout Christen dom, and found no check, except over. growth, to an illimitable sultanry For- tunatdy, the aspinng Solyman was en¬ grossed by domestic calamities, so that > ranee had the infamy of supplicating his assistance, without the consolation of denving any advantage from it, but the crime was not abated by its vanity, vet the patriots of Genoa (Fiesco and las confidants cannot be understood in that meaning) gave no retrospective glance, out madly wooed the succour of their lormcr despots, whose inimical banners, in profane conjunction with the crescent of Barbarossa, had repeatedly alarmed their coasts 1 hose of superior understanding, who were too wise to be foolishly wrong, and too honest to be wilfully so, involved themsdves by following the mazy max ims of their compatriot politicians In
these, the meritorious solicitude to pu¬ rify their country from the stigma of external domination, was the principal incentive of thar schemesi but finding the debility of the natives in carrying them into execution, they were neces¬ sitated to introduce aid from abroad, a false step that ruined them, for it alwa) s proved that the one alien having dis- seated the other, established himself in his place thus all their boasted skill tend¬ ed only to a change of masters Expe¬ rience, however, failed to dissuade them from these ineffectual arts spider-like, they industriously w ov e gordı.n webs of subtilty, which alternate swords were fain to cut, because they could not untie The Cavalier likewise might have rea sonably suspected that the kindness wherew ith he w as treated, w as not pure¬ ly friendly and disinterested , for in tw о interviews with the heart of the corspi racy, he was besought with tiresome im portunity to diaw money from Don
Phihppo, a conduct that he ever firmi;· declined his personal energy was then- only accession, and thus one view of Juhan probably was confuted. Claudio's inflexibility did not work in his behalf on the minds of the rebuf¬ fed, and some time elapsed without an invocation to their council. He was beginning to fed much surprise at this neglect, when, one morning, a summons preparatory for night was sent him, and from what he could gather, he judged that important and mature matters were to be agitated. He was lodged in one of the inner¬ most chambers of the structure, lest signs of its being inhabited should escape to the notice ot people without, and arms were hung near at hand, m provi¬ dence for any sinister chance that might obligate their use 1 he day early dosed, for the year was deeply on the wane the Cavaher bound his waist with a girdle, wherein he sheathed several sti-
lettoes, he then muffled himself in a black doak, veiled his t ce with a mask, and hastened to the secret consistory As he paced the long entries, which were uncrossed by other persons, his mind was subdued jy an awe, which the ambiguity of his engagements did not tend to throw off the waleful notes of the hibernal wind murmured pre- sageful in 1 is ear, and disposed htm to that superstitious melancholy, which naturally is the previous humour to fi antic enthusiasm The vicinity of the assembly was dark, forsaken, and silent, save w hen the deep hum from within was released by the door being opened for the entry of those bdong. ing to the faction it seemed that all were consociated for the achievement of some grand enterprise Claudio found an unprecedented num¬ ber, mysteriously habited as hniself, and close to the portal were several of fierce demeanour, who really were se-
leet myrmidons of Fiesco, ready to per petratc wh it oever sanguinary deed his suspicion or ill will could require One of them thwarted the C/iaher's pas¬ sage " Make way '" cried Claudio, somewhat alarmed, for m hım he re. cognized the man by whom he was first introduced. Hie opponent iden¬ tified his person by tlte toi e ot lus voice, and forbore to impede his going on , however, he adhered to his elbow, so that Claudio vainly endeavoured to dude him in the throng So haunted, he jostled through the circle, to disco¬ ver what was performed within Se vcral nobles were engaged in debate curious to hear the subjc t, he ap proached nearer to them, but, how willingly he would have slunk aback, when his first personal glance fell on the Marquis de Souvncour Julian, whose pnvate plans ran pa¬ ralid with his conspirant one, as a po¬ tent step towards the consummauon of
either, had seduced the Marquis to Ge noa, where he alike was deceived him self, and used to deceive others lhe taction esteemed him privately com¬ missioned by the Monarch of France, and greeted his presence with silent exultation , w h le the artful le iders te n dered that hornige which mentally th y disdirne!, but which inducea the Mır quis to b heve, that in him they really reieieneed the regal representative T he poor Marquis, in deep mourning for the supposed death of his son, sate throned on in insignitila it elevation al ove the rest, and close to hnn stood the Conte th buscano He femblıngly listened to the latter's voice, which mu sic и ıs frightful to his ears as the hoot ings of an evil omen'd bird, until he was congealed with terroi, and retained only the power to assent Although all relative to this dread was incompre hcnsiblc to the plotters, its conse¬ quences, nevertheless, wet с favourable
to them, for as thcy respectfully con¬ formed to the Marquis's opinion, they needed it to be previously fashioned ac. cordant to their own, by a confederate. As Claudio recoded from society so undesired, the causer of his removal casually caught his eyes the confused Cavalier instantly presumed himself to be discovered, tor, beholding the na¬ ked face of the Marquis, he forgot that his own was unexposed, and he suf¬ fered the cruellest apprehensions of im¬ peachment forthwith. But when this disordering regard pissed aside, and left him at liberty, he recovered to a satisfaction of the vanity of his ideas, and resumed a proper confidence with regard to the objects before him Ranked next to the Marquis 'at Fi¬ esco, to his right Jerome riesco, and a wide arraignment ot other noblemen, all unmasked. Julian alone was un¬ settled, for he strode to and fro, and to wheresoever discussion required arbi
trament. Expanded on the table lay an accurate plan of the city, its suburbs, harbours, and defences, on which the Conte di Lavagna described with the dupe of his scabbard, the irrangements of an assault In the decision of this, numberless altercations arose twi\t the Conte and Juhin I he audacious va lour of the litter was much displeased by a system, which was so prudent is to leave nothing to hazird lhe ler- fection ot the contrtv ince deprived the execution of ill glory in his opinion, and he 1 ishlv disordered the whole, by undertaking the orlice t f chief import, of w hich he projected to increase the peril, by refusing the allotted force in prejudie to his own band, on whose dauntless intrepidity he affected to rely for surmounting any danger, nor could idmonishment 1 intreaty cause him to forego his presumption At length the procedure was com pletely modelled in other respects, the
leaders being nominated, the troops proportioned, their services appointed, and ev erv movement skilfully and ma nifestly explained The mouth of the Darsena was to be blocked, and the Dorian fleet attacked by Verrina, a Ge noese of great reputation for courage, whose means of offeree were four well appointed gallien, purchased, with his connivance at their destired use, from the Pope, and armed by Fiesco, under the pretext of cruising against the infi dels, a report which had tended to man them with several hundred bold adven turers Joseph Verrina was a confidant of Fiesco, and backed the vUeness of his purposes, hoping, in a revolutionary commotion, to relieve his fortune ot the debts that incumbered it, and, to promote himself to dignified power, by trampling on the corses of ducal Dona and 1 is kinsman, both of whom he en vied ind hated Between two and three thousand soldiers were secreted about
the city, who were to break out at one moment, so admirable being their dis posai a gun from the admiral s galley was to be the signal for the seiaure ot every barrier, and the dispersion of the guards Several assaults on the forts were then to be made, but the citadel was only to b belcagured, as its strength discouraged the idea of a coup demiin Го Juhan was intrusted the securing of the Gate of St I homas, a post of the dearest importance, as it communicated the harbour to the city his slender force was thought made quate to this duty , but he considered an entcrpn/ing briskness to be his pun eipal behoof, and knew Ins band to have the advantage of proximity to the seat of action, as they were concealed in the Dominican convent Ihat thrusands of the citizens, yet unmstructed in the plot, would assume arms in its support, was relied on thus an absolute con-
quest of the city was considered as cer. tain Though the mode of action was de dded on, the season still remained un fixed. Fiesco secretly wished it to be postponed until the I eginmng of Ja nuary, about which time the past year s Doge would abdicate the ducal chair, the dignity, being then unoccupied, might with less difficulty be ascended, neither could such a step incur the ge nera! odium of usurpation But, to the uninformed in his peculiar views, delay had long seemed dangerous and irk some, tearful, therefore, of their alien ation, should it be longer practised, he sacrificed his own circumspection to their impetuosity, and resolved, how ever it were conti ary to true pohc), to ravish those honours there seemed so slight a probability of his acquiring by cratt But the removal of their then possessor, the venerable Andrew Dona,

Ihc circumstances of the evening danced indiscriminately before him, for such an accumulation ot horrors crush¬ ed his nuditatUt' faculties, and sunk him into stupefaction : the hot pollu¬ tion he had swallowed was the bane ot repose, and the next morning his body was infljmed by fe\er. To assuage his distemper u as not kft to the option oí Claudio, for belimi·, he wa*apprised, that no t^usc vf indispo¬ sition could exempt him , and thus he was obliged in ajpeirance to stek tlie destruction ot n.ui, in \\1къе blood he leally was determined not to be ini¬ bi ued. Ihc holiness ot the bcison, ft r it wis near tu Chiistiïlas, ind disposai most people to devotion j and the {.huuli was exceedingly crowded, when Julian, and hisPrivadoes, promiscuously entered. With considerable ditlieulty they pene¬ trated towards the sanctuary, but, not¬ withstanding their endeavours, they
widely were dispersed, and as Claudio was not strenuous to keep them com¬ pany, he completely was separated from them. Still he assiduously sought the altar, and obtained a station near unto the balustrade that excluded its profana¬ tion. Neither of the Dorias was come, and the service soon commenced with¬ out their attendance. The impressive solemnities ot the catholic faith, vvhie li rctusc no art to captivate attention, anil strike the soul tlnough the senses, Muupt Claudio with awe and adora¬ tion, nor did he revert to his abomina. ble thraldom, until some seasonable ceremonies reminded him of the divine incanì ition. 'i hen it wa¿, that the doctrines of a godhead streaming o'er his mind, effaced each stigma ot its de¬ lusion ; and he rejected each tic or sci- vice, that could not bear debate within the house ot God. But when the Gre¬ gorian chant began, and a congregation
of thousands swelled their voices in one harmonious peal, and rent the consecrated dome with loud hosannas, then he scarcely could restrain his red¬ ings i to which it seemed impious to know there vcic men who sung with impure tongues, and \et nut to ini. peach them. This was not the case v ith Juh in, whose constant) to \ke n nlu put to shame the unsteady рпы.1укь ot \ntui.

'Hie people instinc'iNtly had shrunk from Ins portentous gloom ; and he stood like the ŕtll magician ot a circle, solitary amid a crowd. lie oow and then looked eagerly around,

still considered to have fundamental propriety As the present day w'as a festival, he wis obliged to postpone this conduct till the morrow meantime he obtained shelter ind refreshment in a small public house A reflective interval did not abate his resolution, and he arose the next morn¬ ing with alacrity Ί he cravings of his stt mach being allayed, he made no more delay, but h istened, according to direc¬ tion, to the hall ot audience, wherein the Duke was then presiding But no unfortunate did ever experience more obst icles to doing well than did the Ca¬ viller, whose persecutions came from every quirtcr As he walked beneath the pia¿7i, which skirted either side of the portico, a η ıblc, dıstınguıshıngly accompanied, rode by 1 lie cav ılcadc attracted the notice ot Claudio, who, looking up, saw, and was seen by Gun- netino, who ordered that he should be arrested lhe execution of this re-

When Claudio again saw himself in confinement, he ran over the whole ca¬ talogue of his faults, in order to disco- ver, which ot then could be uf a mag¬ nitude to deserve so severe an expia¬ tion. He misjudged them grossly, it they sprung trom aught save error, and Heaven was too clement to punish such.

When descended ind reseated by his melancholy flame, the Cavalier attended to his loquacious Squire for a consider¬ able time, and, from the chearfulness of his tones he augured, that the difficulties of their interview were fastly subsiding. He was not mistaken, for towards the e\ en ot thi ensuing day, Ercolani suddenly cnt red, but they were obliged to suppress their mutual pleasure, lest thcy might cause mistrust in the guard. In this first visit the Squire projected its repetition whenever his military ac. qu unt ince stood sentinel His arrange¬ ments fully gratified his affectionate anxiet), and, at different times, he passed several hours with his master.

A scalding tear, that started from the eye of Claudio, negatived the question "Oh 1 ' exclaimed the furious wretch " your check wears a blush' whether it be of health or shame, I'll turn it into fear ' And he accompanied these w ords by a wringing stroke, which he inflicted full upon the face of Claudio Duty, unsupported by respect or af fection, is far from permanence The Cavalier s patience fled before this igno mmy, and he struggled to loose himself yet his rising efforts vv ere checked by the consid ranee, thit those opponent si new s, w hich he now sought to encrv ite, hid, in then youthful vigour, adminis tered to his being Wherefore, he put not more than half his might, ind, over passing many opportunities o' triumph, wasted his spirits, until he drooped be fore the expert w rcsthng of Ricardos , who dashed him against the wall, and, completed his cruelty by a malicious spurn of the lied, which act he disguised

With an al.cttjd soli¬ citud'· to obt-v Ricardos they distracted the couit with d imour and outrage, shaking the dismayed magistrate in his eminence, scattering hi, books, and be¬ spattering his g irnienti with vary-co- loured ink.

The p'aks ot a wintry vesture pre- scnted a degree of obduracy to the dag¬ ger, that deceived its wretrhed gra >pci into the confidence that he had secured his victim : the immediate downfal ot the Cavalier seemed so unequivocal a confirmation, that he struck no second blow.

ГЬе day wa* yet so new that admis sion into the menial quarter of the fa¬ bric was not to be gamed, nor was the Cavaher in a humour to solicit it, for tear ot Ricardos preponderated every ntlier consideration he therefore strove to w anu himself by walking around the court He was sufEcientlv w eancd by this solitary exercise, when it was broken off by a sentinel upon the ram¬ parts, who loudly interrogated a distant comrade, Whether he did not discern something proport ned like a human carcase, drifted by the waters of the lakei This strange inquiry hastened tht other to the spot, wherefrom the first man looked, and there Claudio joined them What marvcli&usly puzzled the sol¬ diers w as the want ot any similarity to a Î cad, wl ich thcy missed whenever the tempestuous grcenr-ss of the flood »(lorded the n a transient view But Claudio кл no doubt that it was the

Tke »arious auspidons of whot, among them, could be the perpetrator of the murder, ouiekly centred in Claudio, for he dropped senselessly down. The servitors, stricken with horror, conveyed him to the Conte, from whom they petitioned punishment equivalent to the hdnousness oí his crime. When he recovered his senses, he found himself, in an anti-chamber, the object of whispered execrations : from these he was delivered by a sum¬ mons .rom the Conte, to whom he singly entered. Julian conducted him into a private cabinet, and there Claudio sobbed forth bis narrative. Iho Conte displayed strong symptoms of interest in many parts; and when Claudio had condud- cd, he told him to be of good heart ; not to dosppad, but rather to rejoice and deify his good genius for having accorded him revenge without a crime. Seeing the Cavalier's astonishment, be adminbtcrcd t« it by saying, " Ricardos
was not your father." The mighty truth overburdened Claudio, and— Ricardos was not your father—sung in his ears awfully as will the last trump. Julian backed his information with references to facts, by Which he purged Claudio from the mist that had so long blinded hini to an artificial parentage ; and with heartfelt elation he yielded ab¬ solute credit to the intelligence that Ri¬ cardos was not hb father. " But who then .s ?" was a question that Julian declined to answer; and that in a manner which forbad its repe¬ tition. " Ricardos," said the Conte, resum» ing the thread of his discourse, " Ricar> dos, in the heat of the madness, caused by my detection of his villainy, sought to wreak each sting of wrath, shame, and tear, upon you, the unconscious cause. Thanks te manhood; your arms were nerved to his overthrow ; and be it your prayer that h" downfall con¬ cluded not in this life. You ask me oi

he summoned assurance to solicit a dis· mission from the castle, in which he avowed himsdf unable to remain with comfort Julian reluctantly yielded to his re¬ quest " You are to me," said he, " a new found gem, which should be worn about my heart, woe'd not my sorrows dim it but, for so many a day my breast hath been inhospitable to friendship, that it now is a painful intrusion 'Tn for the good of both to part yet let not absence be mine ene¬ my, for I do vow that it sha'n't be thine " He then departed to provide for the equipment of the Cavaher, whom he left deeply affected, for there was a certain tenderness in Julian s ad¬ dress, which drew hotter tears than he hitherto had slied In a short time a page appeared with travelling apparel he expressed to С laudio his master's desire of its accep¬ tation, and then withdrew Claud.o saw the propriety of acquiescence, and

Hardly could the Cavaher pledge his promise, ч hen he felt his body folded by the arms of this extraordinary man, who held him to his breast, and affec¬ tionately cried, " It is thy first kindred embrace " In the next moment Clau¬ dio found himself forsaken An equei ry now advanced to aid him to mount. 1 he horse w as one of the noblest ani- nnls the С onte's stables could boast, and (.hudio tlepirtcd dispatchful for the v ilia of Don I'hilhppo He spuircd indefatigably forward, until he surpassed the interdicted ground In a thick branched wood, ti e birthplace of legend and romance, he drew forth this mysterious paper,

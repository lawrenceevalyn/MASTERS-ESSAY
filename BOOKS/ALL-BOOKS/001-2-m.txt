t»7] Lord and Lady Fitz Alan, Evlin, and Matilda, continued for some length of time to reside at the Castle of Ormond, that of Pitz AÌan being gloomy and much fallen into decay from neglect during the absence of iís rightful Heir. In a short period, Matilda gave birth to a daughter, ????? we shall have occa¬ sion to denominate hereafter by the name òf tásèna. Somé years of peace were perrntttáá sweetly tò glide oveFthe heads of* Matilda and Evlíft, clouded only by the loas of their aged parents ; but alasi ere" Issfena had attained ber jiineteenth summer, her noble Father, returning' from the chase, was inhu¬ manly murdered in a Idbe v^ood, at some distance from the castle. At firsts the grief of Matilda admitted «jo consolation, and retiring toan a- partment in which the body df her mur¬ dered Lord lay in state, she wildly threw
? *88 ] threw herself upon his insensible c rse and franticly kissed its day cold lips, then, gating on the beautiful orphan IsaSeim, who,enveloped in sable rai men í, sat weeping at the foot Qf the bier, "Ah ï røy child' cried she,"how wretched art thou, at that age, when most your in¬ experience needed the protection and advice of a Father, to be severed thus, by the most ruthless and diabolical hands, from one whose esteem was unequalled^ and whose love was boundless." * „ . > . >, * "Be comforted, my mother!'* replied 'j- * * -a Issena with gentleness, "a hand invisi- ble hangs over our forlorn statelo guard it—and the aJJ piercing eye of Omni¬ potence is upon us.

[??] of ?? Alan ; and that of Ormond, berag^frøøa peculiar circumstances, des¬ tined to return again to the raak heirs, within a certain period after her late Father's decease, was no longer in her right. The ©aron Oswold, however, to Whom the Alan estate descended, at the newsxrf Evline death, immediately dispatched a r Courier with the. proffel of its services »to MatiMa, ^who had fre- quently heard her husband mention the ruinous states of this solitary mansion, Ä ba&3whieh she had ^ever visi^d.

Cafe] It was the decline of Autumn, when Matilda and Issena departed wiih tears, from the towers of Ormond, for those of Oswold, late Pitz Alan—The last beams of day were rapidly declining behind the western ocean, as the litter, which slowly conveyed them, approached the venerable fabric ; it wás situated in a mountainouscountry, and elevated at an awful distance from the level of the earth. A broad solemn ???? banner, in memory of the late Lord's decease, still mournfully waved over the battle¬ ments, which presented ah uncouth atød formidable appearance; 1 The building, forming an exact square, and extending to a considerable extent^ contained an immense court within its own centre; four balconies^iof heavy stone work, è- qually arranged on the exterior, pre* sented themselves, as the only visible means of air or light it possessed, save a quantity of narrow dörrk openings ia

ín the form of crosiers, which seemed to ornament,rather than enlighten the^n- fgle turrets. No moat encompased the Ça&ttf , bqt an impenetrabfc barrier of ropk, rendered all attempts of ?? ene, my to invade it fruitless—the only entrance through which, was by a massy barred gate, covered with a portcujlis heavily studded witb iron speais. At tbe arrival of Matilda and Issena, the foldingdoors of the ball were thrown: ppen to receive them, and a number of domestics, attired in the deepest mour¬ ning, n came forth to welcome their pre¬ sence. The funeral appearance of their raiment—the sadness of their features, and the kind concern which they evin¬ ced foç her welfare^ were too much for the exhausted nature of Matilda's spirits, aml^eaaijig on Issena, she requested to be con^ç^^p her chamber^ wherein Wf%^ |$ "any but ber cbild, she P 3 might

[SOO] The remaining part of the evening* was spent in conversationxm the subject of Ulric and the Black Robber, till Ma¬ tilda deemed it her usual hour of repair¬ ing to the Oratory, in order to perform her accustomed devotions, previous to retiring for repose. Turing the lapse of years, the reader will scarcely expect me to recount the variety of adventures which befel Ulric, however he may feel interested in his destiny. Since the death of Kgisard, who fell in an encounter with some travelling merchants, he had been chosen Chieftain of the Banditti r —his Hame and deeds were alike famous, and equally the dreads as admiration of the country :—true it was, he assumed a& many shapes as, Proteus^—entered in disguise the first bouses, and was well acquainted with the secrets" of every fa- Bfily ! yçt he never abandoned th§ re* collection

collection of his Julia, and his general costume, being composed of mourning to her memory, acquired him the title of the Black Robber. He had been at different times, under different disguises to the castle of Regi¬ nalds wherein he had distantly seen Val¬ entine. Ulric longed to clasp the Boy to his heart—he longed to pour into' h is ear an account of his Mother's suffer¬ ings and virtues, but the painful con¬ viction of his own unlawful pursuits, prevented the consummation of his pater¬ nal wish. Much as Ulric lamented that the unhappy circumstances attending his earlier years, should have placed him in a situation wherein his child must blush at his acknowledgement, it was still à matter of consolation to his wound¬ ed peace, to behold that child, fhe re¬ semblance of his Julia, in the path of rectitude and fame, gradually rising un¬ rivaled
[302] rivaled to tbe honours of his ancient and noble house. Ulric was firmly resolved that a dis¬ closure of his own circumstanses and person, should never blast the peace of his dependent Valentine, however dear the trial might cost his feelings—he de¬ termined to die,as he had lived, a forlorn, solitary, and unknown wanderer t-p-it was true he conceived, that the band of duty might close his dying eyes with more tendernes than that of a stranger, and the tear of ¡ filial affection, shed on his secluded grave, be a welcome tribate to his unquiet ghost : bujt be was conjbent to resign every earthly consideration for the weal of hissoa^—Julia's son. * ? ! ye rigid fathers, whose stern ey§ s tum with indignation from my unskil¬ ful story, have ye never been more cri¬ minal even than Ubricî for tbough the transactions
[303] transactions of your past days might be remote from those of a repenting and unhappy Bandit, have ye,never wronged unoffending innocence? have ye never forfeited your claims to Heaven's mercy, by a single act, opposite to the nature of its sacred laws, and yet look for esteem and respect from your unconscious off¬ spring ? if then Ulric broke the solemn resolutions he had formed, lives there no excuse for his offending in your bosoms? in the bosoms of true virtue and benevolence there exist many. Men may sever bonds, contracted between each other, in the dearest hour of friend¬ ship, but tbe genuine unities of nature cannot be disjointed—they are formed with our existence, sealed with our true hearts,and á only to be broken by the fin¬ ger of Death.

'x hough Reginald had received Valen¬ tine into his family, and continued to afford him protection, still there were moments, mfserable ones, to the youth, iii 3 "which the urifééling spirit of the Earl wounded his proud heart with a bííter sem*e of dependence and former obligation. Valentuie being totally ig¬ norant of his parents, was far from supposing the relationship existing be¬ tween himself and St. Julien but deemed himself an unknown and hum¬ ble
C sos] ble victim of icy charity. From his parents, he possessed a high and noble spirit, which, while it procured him esteem, at the same time insured him the respect of all—his heart was a to? tal stranger to vice, and never beat more warmly than when administering consolation to the calamities of others. True it was, at those periods when the stern haughtiness of Reginald descended keenly to his breast, he would retire to some silent solitude and lament, th^t no paternal hand cherished his early years.

The solitary cap¬ tive who weeps on the dank pavement of his murky dungeon,, with no better cbarm to beguile tbe weary hour, than thatjof watching the decreasing nurture of bi%lamp,is more exquisitlely alive ? the celestial,delights of liberty, than tbe wild and lawless, wanderer, who,* uncon¬ trolled by the heavy fetters of tyranny, mves heedlessly from spot to spot, jusen* sible to the actual blessing he enjoys*
t 3β9] But to our narrative.—Gne evening, when Reginald had evinced more than customary marks of unkindness, Valen¬ tiné privately withdrew from the Castle, and repaired to his favorite retirement among the Yarrow Hills. The beauteous wildness of the scene, which had first endeared the spot to his fancy, now passed unheeded ; for his young heart sighed for communion with those it had long since ceased to remember. Re¬ clining on the hoary trunk of a half- fallen beech, the leafy branches of which formed a sylvan bower, impervious almost to the twinkling sunbeams, he hung pensively over the silvery curren t; vvhich murmìired'at hm feet,as the dulcet sound of a Wte, áòiconipanifed by a voice of setápHie sweetness, stole 'gently on his attentive ear ;—it paused :—Valen¬ tine âtutiously arose fronxhis recumbant position, and gliding to the verge ofthe over-hanging cliff, from which the notée
I ?? 2 notes evidently proceeded, Wás vainly gazing around for the songstress, ásr tht witching strains continued the following THE rilgrimïîoy arose at morn— To Almo's Shrine he bent his' way— ' Tbe sandals on his féet Were torne, And. tattered were hm garments grey. ^ Ah ! werefore wend'st thou Pilgrim Boy ? At such an age what woes are thine ? While ruder bosoms beat with joy, Why sadly seek'st tbou Almo's Shrine." "Stranger, 1 may not name the^sause, Since man to män deceitful provés ; And, heedless of compassion's laws, They blast each other's hopesand loves." ?? Now, Pilgrim Boy, by heaven I swear Thy secret in my heart shall rést — Thy griefs shall claim my matin práy'r — Tliy head shall slumber on my breast."

" Stranger didst thou e'er fee! of love? *Tis that alas ! which fires my brain—- Tis thst |vbiçh bids aie wildly rove r O'er lonely hill and desert plain.'* " Hero, a maid of peerless form, The Chief Lunardi's youngest child, Kais'd in my throbbing heart the storm Which blights my peace, which makes me wild." " Since ah ! in spite of sighs and woe, Lunardi scorns our tender tale; And, heedless of the lover's glow, Consigns his daughter to the veil." " Stranger I fly to Almo's shrine, Where Hero bides the while to weep— She breathes at morn her vows divine, When I may sink to endless sleep." ? ít Poor Pilgrim Boy, go not that way, Abide with me I'll soothe thy grief—" " Stranger, I may not, cannot stay, For bruised heart there's no relief." * * * *

Ti» Hero, and that stranger youth Is the poor Pilgrim Boy, and he CaUs, a Hero stay, I claim thy truth— i Thy vows are only due to rae." rí Rash youth, forbear t" the Abbot cries, " Forbear such impious words to speak ;" Still u Hero stay," the Pilgrim sighs, And pale, pale is his youthful cheek. Fast from his side the life streams flow— The red knife in his hand is high, He aims at Hero's breast the blow— Iiock'd in each other's Arms they die. As the ballad concluded, Valentine, who till then had seemed rivitted to the spot, unable to restrain his anxious cu¬ riosity, quickly turned an angle of the rock, and beheld two ladies on the emi¬ nence, contemplating the bewitching scene
[31*] scene ; one of them, who carried on her arm a lute, he supposed to have been the syren, whose enchanting voice had filled him with such ecstatic delight; and, as he continued to gaze, in endeavour¬ ing to pass some abrupt projection, the instrument, with which she had so har¬ moniously accompanied herself, fell from the young lady's hand, into the valley; Valentine instanly snatched it from the ground, and flinging it across his shoulder, in a moment began to ascend the craig. The loose fragments of rock descended in showers to the glen, as, clinging from spray to spray, he had nearly attained his purpose, when the lovely Issena, who bad tremblingly noted his progress,put forth her gentle hand te* assist him—almost breathless, he presented tbe lute. 'P stranger l* said Issena,"I feel still so terrified at the recollection of your ?o¿ if E perilous
[315] perilous situation, that I am totally un¬ able to express my thanks. " " Lady ! " answered Valentine, mo¬ destly /'truly grateful for the interest you take in my safety, I rejoice at the for¬ tunate opportunity, which thus enables me to render you the most trifling ser¬ vice." « 4 Tis well you exist to tell us this " added Matilda, glancing her eyes fear¬ fully across the hazardous track which Valentine had passed. The youth re¬ turned a suitable reply to the mother of Issena —she became charmed with his manners and person. Like his father, Valentine was endowed with those man¬ ly graces,wbich so highly finish the per¬ fection of nature, bis penetrating eyes beaming with ingenuous expression— the clustering wildness of his dark hair, and the florid glow of health on hb
[316] his youthful cheek, added to a form, equally imposing, rendered him truly interesting. Valentine mention ing the Castle of St. Julien as his residence, a sad recollection of past events, rushed to Matilda's breast, and remembering how readily her own heart had been im¬ pressed by the attractions of Evlin,^he trembled for that of her daughter in the presence of the youth, lssena's bosom glowed ever with the most tender sen¬ timents, emanating from a forcible and enlightned mind ;—that she could not love an object undeserving her regard, the fond parent believed ; but at that age when the mildness of angels sits on the souls of mortals, alasi how many miseries* 4 have attended, even mutual loves,because circumstances have event¬ ually transpired to blast thera. Such were the reasonings of Matilda, c - Ah" thought she 'Imply this fatal in- E 2 cident
g 317 1
cident, through trifling in itself, may lead to many others, of a more serious and important nature, which may for years, molest the tranquillity and hap¬ piness of a family. '* "Widely different were the passing sensations in the bosoms of Issena and Valentine, as they slowly wound along the lovely path ofthe mountain ; and of¬ ten did be pause to tender his assistance, or point out some picturesque feature in the landscape. All his proud ideas of independence, which had led him to meditate alone, beneath the bowering beech tree, had escaped from his me¬ mory, and a thousand fantastic images danced before his vivid imagination, equally tending to promote his acquain· tance with the beautiful Issena;— so congenial too were his sentiments to hers, that she seeretly rejoiced iu such an acqusitiou as himself, to share the daily
? ?»] daily rambles which she was accustomed to make with her mother, naturally sup¬ posing his society would prove equally agreeable to Lady Matilda. No though í of Valentine's rank or condition, en- tered the spotless purity of Issena's mind; she was charmed with his conversation, his demeanour, and the benignity of his countenance ; the wild and enthu¬ siastic flow of his language too,as he ex¬ patiated on various subjects, coincided with the warmth of her own artless ideas. ? how bright! how exquisite are the enjoyments of unsuspecting youth, ere the heart becomes callous with the result of years, adversity, g r commu¬ nion with a unfeeling world. One open prospect of sunshine and delight ap¬ pears extended before us, and little think we of the coiled serpents which lurk with envenomed tongues beneath E3 the
í 319 ] the flower that invites our heedless hand, or that the silvery drops which add beau¬ ty and fragrance to the blossom,are tears of regret shed by the children of expe¬ rience and misfortune. Valentine, Matilda, and Issena, had now nearly reached the Castle of Os¬ wold, as Valentine pointed to a minute view of St. Julien's. " I imagine " exclaimed Lady Fitz Alan, t( you are nearly related to the Earl, by the resemblance which I trace. " Valentine sighed, and, for a, moment seemed urn mindful of the observation; Matilda readily perceived tbat she had undesignedly wounded his feelings, and though a stranger, to the cause, deeply regretted her impropriety.— at length he replied, "yes lady, I am in¬ deed allied to the Earl of St, J ulien ? but
[ 320 ] but it is by the bond of gratitude alone ; no parents tender hand adminsierad to my infant years, since recollection, nor know I other benefactor than the Earl" a tear was instantly in Issena's eye, as she cast a tender, but reproachful look at her mother. Valentine's words were uttered with that tone of expression, not to be, mistaken, and by which Lad} Fitz Alan perceived, fro:*i other mo¬ tives, rather than any obscurity of his birth, he was unhappy ; she knew, from painful experience, the nature of Regi¬ nald's disposition, and that his feelings were too apathetic to anticipate the se¬ cret pang which wounds the bosom of sensibility ; what then a state of depen¬ dance on his bounty must be, she could easily imagine, and with the most heart¬ felt pity, deplore the mishap of the un¬ fortunate who needed it. They had now arrived at the Castle, E 4 and
[321] and after partaking some refreshment, Valentine perceiving the queen of night towering behind the long-drawn hills, respectfully arose to depart. Issena watched his footsteps through the glen. as far as the pale moonlight would admit, and as frequently did he turn to gaze towards the Castle : at length, vanishing in distant gloom, Issena silent, and de¬ jected, retired to a gothic couch in the apartment, and abstractedly taking up her lute, played a melancholy mea¬ sure. Matilda beheld her emotions with anguish—she had not requested Valen¬ tine to renew his visit, and tlie gentle heart of Issena she was aware,felt deep¬ ly at this neglect. ft My child " at length sighed Lady Fitz Alan, inter¬ rupting the silence, it is for your sake I liis h this stranger to return no more, and also for big own; remember my Issena
[3S2 3 Issena, his sole dependence is on the bounty of Earl St. Julien, who is by no means attached to the interest of our house; and probably, were be acquain¬ ted with the visits of this youth, to the almost friendless daughter of his rival, it might become a serviceable pretext for abandoning him for ever. " Issena blusbing at the detection of her weakness, imprinted a fond kiss on the cheek of her parent, and acknow¬ ledging the justness of her remarks, continued to share in conversation till a late bour,on the same subject, ere they retired. It was in vain however, that Issena endeavoured to banish the form of Valentine from her mind, or to steep her senses in slumber ; and the rosy beams of morn, as they glided through the silken curtains of her couch, discovered her cheek pale with lassitude—her eyes wet with tears, E 5 On
[ 323 J Ön Valentine's return to St. Julien T s, he found that the Earl had repeatedly en qu ried for h im, an d instantly repairing to his apartment, respectfully awaited his commands. <t How eomes it ! " cri¬ ed Reginald, haughtily, that you pre¬ sume to leave the Castle without my per¬ mission." rt My Lord l" answered VaJentine,mo- destly, ''till this moment I do not remem¬ ber your imposing any charge oft my wanderings/' "Tie for such as thee to anticipate'thfr wishes of those who protect them." re¬ plied the Earl, sternly. The fire of Ulric glowed in Vaïen> tine's cheek, as indignantly he respond¬ ed the words, "such as thee.*' Overhear¬ ing him, St. Julien exclaimed, " dost mock me ingrate ? is this new insolence acquired
[334]
acquired fron your Friends at the Cas¬ tle of Oswold ?" My friends î what friends my Lord ?" "Valentine, this affected ignorance avails not—curious to discover the pur- port of your long and frequent visits to the hills, I commissioned a vassal to ob¬ serve your movements—of your resort, and society to night, I am aware—and from this moment, you are perfectly at liberty to resign the letter, or leave my protection for ever/* f< My lord, I never till this evening. beheld the persons to whom you allude, and even then, by accident-r~ ,r Valen¬ tine would have proceeded, but on Regi¬ nald's proudly waving his hand towards the door, wounded to the soul, he silent¬ ly withdrew to his couch. The lovely image of Issena, for a time dispelled the gloom occasioned in his mind, by the E 6 overbearing
C 3S5 ? overhearing spirit of tbe Earl, " posessed ©f her," sighed Valentine, e 4he mountain cabin were a palace—the shepherd*s life enviable"—lie felt much chagrined how¬ ever, that Lady Fitz Alan had not re¬ quested a renewal of his visit—this, with the fresh recollection of [St. Julien's Â harshness, rendered him restless and un¬ happy, when quitting his pillow, as the turret clock anounced the hour of mid¬ night, hè secretly deserted his chamber^ and forlornly wandered into the woods. During these events, Ulric's fame, as tliat of some being, more than mortal, daily increased;—at tbe name of the Blach Robber, whole groupes would fly to their homes, unmindful ofthe evening dance, or holiday gambol—in different disguises, he had been seen by many, but though large rewards were offered daily for his head, no one had either the courage or ability to secure him. Awed
[326] by tbe extent of his power, the neigh- bouring Barons favoured, and increased the number of their vassals; foi? the sud¬ den attacks of the Banditti, required no small force of arms to repel them. It was the nocturnal hour of peniten¬ tial prayer, and the moon, exalted in her silver chariot- reflected innumerable fan* tastic figures on hill aud forest, as Ulric, resting upon his spear, his breast fired with admiration, stood and contemplated the myriads of revolving worlds suspend¬ ed in the blue æther. At a small dis¬ tance, surrounding the dying embers of a lowly fire, lay part of the Banditti, while flasks, shields, and arms, were scattered in wild disorder over the grass. All around was still, save when the sul¬ len tone of distant Convent chime, rung on the passing gale its measured space ; while the pale beams of night, gliding through the foliage, and sporting with gjoomi
t m } gloom, figured to the watchful eye, the forms of other spheres ; and as Ulric ga- z,ed across the towering cliff, which at¬ tired in giant majesty, rose sublimely above him, he almost imagined that, clad in mist, the grey ghosts of Julia, Agnes, and Bertram, hovered around. * f Peace to their shades" he sighed, "amen"^—a- men ! repeated a gentle echo—Ulric started—the warm blood gusjied to his heart, but suddenly recollecting the cause of his surprise, he returned to his former position and sad meditations ; at length, awaking Gregory, one of the Banditti, "keep watch" said he, "till I wander round this eminence." Gregory started from the ground, re¬ spectfully taking the spear, as Ulric withdrew, and entering an opening of the woods, bad proceeded to a con¬ siderable distance on his ramble, when the resemblance of a dark figure, seated motionless
[ 328 } motionless, at the foot öf a wide sprea¬ ding oak-tree, excited his attention, For a moment Ulric paused to observe the mysterious stranger, when a deep drawn sigh proclaimed the victim of sorrow ; and approaching nearer, he discerned the person of a youth who seemed so deeply lost in rumination, as not to ob¬ serve his intrusion. "Is misfortune so early an attendant on this boy '* said the Chief, internahy; ' # that he seeks these dangerous solitudes at midnight, to sigh, alone ? "hast thou wandered beyond the extent of thy knowledge ?" enquired he, raising his voice and addressing the unknown. At these words the wanderer started, and lifting up his eyes, fiixëd them on the dark figure of Ulric, who observing bis surprise and silence, again enquired if he had lost his path Alas
C 3aø:i
? Alas no*' sighed he " the pothof ?? eutcast is too extensive. >r tf Art thou exiled from thy paternal man- won ?*' <f riave the objects of icy bounty, or the children of unknown parents, man¬ sions?" enquired the stranger. * ** Art thou the offspring of parents unknown, and dependent on the pro¬ tection of others then ? J> faultered Ulric. " Alas ! Stranger, I am ; but my proud heart disdains the dastard's life. ? ! wouldst thou suide me to the field of honour, 1 have an arm shall win me fame and glory—I have a soul to bless thee, though I perish " Thy wildness moves me, tell me noble youth, thy name —thy home? " Home have I truly none, save natures canopy
? ??? ) canopy, or such as pitying heaven the wild deer gives—Earl Reginald,tis true, affords me shelter; yet, ingrate that I am, I bless it not " —my name stranger, my name is------" "Valentine ? " quickly ejaculated Ul¬ ric. There was a peculiarity in the Chief¬ tain's hurried manner and expression, which moved the heart of Valentine, and giving loose to the secret impulse of his emotions " yes ? 'he exclaimed," I am indeed Valentine, " the friendless, unhappy Valentin^' " Come, ? come î to my scathed breast, thou dear remains of the saint¬ ed Julia"—cried Ulric clasping him in his paternal arms. "Ah! who art thou?" said Valentine earnestly and who is Julia?—speak, in mercy
[331 ] mercy speak,why bangs this dreadful si¬ lence on your lips, which even now o- pened to my anxious hopes, worlds of coming bliss ?" Ulric spoke not. "Stranger! Stranger! continued Va¬ lentine, franticly flinging himself at his feet ft who am I—what am I—what art thou ? " ^ "The Black Robber /"cried Ulric,hoarse with agitation, and disappeared. The father's heart glowed with indignation at the visible contempt with which Re¬ ginald treated his son, and the voice of Valentine, as he supplicated a disclosure of his birth, reminded him so forcibly of his long-lost Julia, that he was on the point of confessing the tye which existed between them, as the rashness ofthe design flashed across his niind,and induced
[ 332 2 inducedhim to rush into the forest; he did not however return to the Banditti, till, by the friendly moonlight, he beheld the uubappy youth wandering to St Julieits, Sorrowful, and at a loss what to con¬ jecture, from the singular incident which had transpired, Valentine confined the circumstance to his own breast ; he had heard frequent accounts of the Black Robber's adventures, but none of them impressed him so deeply, as the one which had recently taken place with himself. <e Tis strange " thought he, ςζ this mysterious being,knows evidently the authors of my existence,and yet va¬ nished at tbe natural appeal I made— be called me the remains of the sainted Julia—is then my,mother no more, or did he mock my sorrows ? ah no ! the stifled agony of his voice, the wild throb too of hİ3 heart, pronounced the since¬ rity a»

He therefore embraced the earliest opportunity of hastening to the spot, rendered doubly dear by the tender
I 335 ]. tender recollection of her he loved ; and and how indescribable were his emotions on discovering the object of his affecti¬ on already on the cliff, in quest of som¬ thing which she had evidently lost Deeply blushing at the approach of Va¬ lentine, Issena welcomed him with a smile, "I am vainly looking" she ex¬ claimed, "for a bracelet which I lost here yesterday,in descending this moun¬ tain" Valentine readily united in the search, and at length fortunately disco¬ vered the desired object suspended on a spray of wild briar. iC Will you permit me to accompany you to the castle, anxiously enquired the youth. Issena's heart consented, but duty denied the acquiescence ; at last, longer unable todissemble,she artlessly confess¬ ed an injunction placed on her, by her her Mother, to the contrary, with rea¬ sons assigned for the same·
1336 j Valentine in return, ingenuously rela¬ ted the narrative of his own life, and an account of the singular dislike, which Reginald evinced for the continuation of his visits to the Castle of Oswald. " Have you never learnt the motive of this dislike ?" enquired Issena. " Never " replied he. Issena then unfolded the particulars of her Mother's union with the Earl, and her nocturnal flight from St* Ju- lien's on the Bridal Eve. These things forcibly reminded Val¬ entine of his midnight encounter with the Black Robber ^and he mentioned the particulars of the adventure to Tssena, who suddenly beholding Lady Matilda, from the balcony, anxiously watching for her return, hastily prepared to quit the mountain.
Stay

" Stay yeta moment" cried Valentine, " ? ! say in pity say, that you will meet me here to morrow—remember,to your bosom alone my woes are confided, and cnn you, will you abandon me?" the pi¬ teous expression of his features, as he earnestly solicited Issena's compliance with his request, pierced her to the soul, and involuntary tears gushed to her eyes, "How can I act " she exclaimed, "com¬ manded by a parent on one side, and thus solicited by you, on the other," "Promise to meet me again, beautiful Issena/* replied he, throwing himself at her feet. *' Consider St. Julien's anger " «f Were it replete with unheard of tortures, I could endure all for thee. * " Valentine, ** faultered Issena, "ex¬ pect me to morrow. " Thanks
í 338 2 " Thanks, thanks, fair excellence, an¬ swered he, rising, and tenderly kissing her band,departed ; as Annette,who had wandered to a different part of the mountain, ??11? unconscious of the in¬ terview, made her appearance. From this hour, the meetings of the young lovers, though secret, and of short duration, became frequent. One evening, however, as Issena approach¬ ed, an unusual sadness hung upon her countenance—alarmed, Valentine en¬ quired the cause " alas ! " replied she, our meetings must be relinquished for the present ; my mother has received Jetters from Baron Oswald, with in¬ telligence of his intention to visit the Castle for a short periodjand the horse¬ man bearing the dispatch, preceded his master but a day's journey." " Ah Issena V' sighed the youth, * r then will the unfortunate Valentine be forgotten." F Be
f 339] ζζ Be not thus ungenerous" answered Issena/'my heart is alone your's—doubt not, Chat, with the earliest opportunity, I shall again fly to this dear solitude, indulging the fond hope of once more beholding yon—and, as a pledge of my affection, take this minature/ 'conti¬ nued she, presenting at the same time a valuable likeness of herself, suspended to a chain of brilliants, "it was painted at the request of my father, and may serve to remind you of its original, during our necesrary separation from each other, as my mother, will, on no consideration, allow me to quit her presence, while Baron Oswold tarries at the Castle/* (t Valentine pressed the portrait to his lips, " yes !" said he " I will cherish this resemblance at my heart, till we meet again—and, as I fondly gaze on the faint efforts of the Limner, memory, sweet memory ! shall supply to my em- passioned
? 340 3 passioned eyes, the matchless beauties, which art could not counterfeit." <f But you must promise me Valen- tine,that your eyes alone shall gaze upon the picture, and that your heart alone shall be sensible to my weaknesss. " " By heaven I swear ! by all my hopes hereafter, " exclaimed he with enthu¬ siastic warmth. Their cares—their fears—their hopes now engrossed their conv ersation, and the sun was already sinking behind the distant hills ere they separated in tears, * —as he passed along the valley, his eyes frequently averted to the castle, and once he beheld Issena— she waved her hand to him and disappeared. An unusual sadness preyed upon the spirits of Valentine, which he tried in vain to subdue;—he knew not when foe happy hour of meeting with his be- F% loved
í sen loved Issena would again occur, and frequently did he hang enraptured over her portrait, the constant, cheering com¬ panion of his solitude and regret. One night, as he sat with Reginald in the hall, his mind so bent upon bis own sorrows as to render him ata loss for conver¬ sation, and bis efforts to become inte¬ rested in the apathetic discourse of Re¬ ginald totally fruitless, who venting his usual ill humour upon the occasion, rendered his situation doubly wretched, the shrill blast of a hprn> echoed loudly through the castle, (i What sound was that" exclaimed Reginald, sternly, starting from the couch on which he reclined. " I know not ,T answered Valentîne,ga- zing around, witb considerable emo¬ tions of surprize. With a look of anger and contempt, the
t S4Q J the Earl resumed his situation, when the sound of strange footsteps in an adjoin¬ ing gallery excited their attention—Va¬ lentine partly unsheathed his sword as the folding doors of the apartment slow¬ ly unclosing, discovered a dark figure, in complete armour, with hasty strides, approaching towards Reginald, who pale and aghast, silently awaited the result of its awe infusing movements. With a solemn and majestic dignity, at length, fixing its keen gaze upon the Earl, "St. Julien" it exclaimed, pointing to Valentine, " have you for¬ gotten whose son this is ? " a sullen silence ensued, as Valentine with some degree of astonishment, recollected the voice to be that, of hk nocturnal and mysterious companion in the forest. " Haply " continued the figure to Reginaid lifting up itjs vizor "you will remeber who I am/ 3 F 3 Father
[343] " Father of Heaven ! *' faultered thé Earl, and sank terrified upon the couch. Valentine rushed foward to tender his assistance, when, suddenly turning to gaze on the Black Robber, he per¬ ceived that he had again disappeared; " Whither is he flown" ? cried the Earl, reaminating, as Valentine searched anxiously around—can the grave resign its dead ?—I thought he bad long since slumbered in peace—or why not come for thee? " For me my Lord! for me !" ex¬ claimed Valentine. Recollecting himself, Reginald re¬ turned no answer to the interrogation, he had not a wish the youth should be made sensible of any claim of kindred on himself, but, abruptly rising, struck upon the bell and summoned the atten¬ dants into the hall. " Have you witnessed any unusual circumstance
[344] circumstance to night ?" impatiently enquired the Earl. " Nothing my Lordi" answered the Steward. " Nor heard unusual sounds ? " r * Tis true we imagined-----" " Imagined, what ? '* u That a shrill blast, such as they say accompanies the approach of the Blach Robber, echoed through the nor¬ thern gallery/* St. Julien motioned for the attend¬ ants to withdraw, and, for some time, remained silent, and thoughtful—at length, snatching a lamp from the table, he departed to his own chamber: leaving Valentine at once the victim of surprise and meditation. In all her beauty rose the deweyed Morn;—the sun's fair beams, behind F 4 the
345 }
the eastern hills, broidered with gold¬ en streaksr heaven's azure mantle ; while the joyous lark, towering from her mossy couch, poured forth on high her matin hymn of gratitude, to the great God of Nature. A thousand beauties glistened in the scene, and, as the sight dwelt on the varying hues of the foliage, it conveyed a sensation of delight, which from admiration of earthly objects, exalted the contempla¬ tive mind, to adore that wonder-work¬ ing Artificer who constructed them ; Lady Fitz-Alan, and Issena were wan¬ dering on the ramparts of Oswald Cas¬ tle, and admiring the extensive view it afforded, " did ever scenes more lovely my Issena," exclaimed Matilda, com¬ bine to fascinate the soul?" Ah ! my mother ;" answered the lat¬ ter, " in those verdant woods, how de¬ lightful would it be to rove at liberty, like
[346 J like the wild and merry ehoristers of the air, unconstrained by the self-crea¬ ted cares of an ungrateful world, Hap¬ py, happy, were the days, wh ? each virtuous hand reared its own lowly ca¬ bin, and genuine love, unmolested by the magic of wealth, enjoyed its own hallowed blessings." " Can Issena forget, that in the age she speaks of, a wild and untutored savage, man, mingled his ignoble pursuits with the irrational part of cre¬ ation, and was himself debatd of that refined intellect, which now elevates him so infinitely above the rest of hea¬ ven's creatings? but Issena, why this unsual regret-, are not you free, and happy ?*» " Both, my Mother, " replied Issena, blushing, " I am at present too young, and too simple to be rendered otlierwise P5 by

[360]
On entering the Hall, the Knights, who already awaited their appearance, arose by way of courtesy, and a min¬ gled tone of admiration, at Issena's beauty, ran through the apartment. She was attired in deep mourning for the memory of her murdered father, which served to heighten f her charms and add additional effect to the pen¬ sive sweetness of her expressive coun¬ tenance. Oswald, fixed his eyes upon her, and as he took her trembling hand, felt a sudden warmth gliding to his heart ; he had attended many courts, where princesses had been renowned for beauty, but never had he witnessed such exquisite loveliness till now— Issena felt truly uneasy in his atten¬ tions—bis looks chilled her with un¬ conquerable dread; and aš her eyes averted to two knights called (Leopold i and Wooldenberg) who appeared the confidents of the Baron, a heavy sadness
[? i
isadness weighed upon her heart; for, notwithstanding the rich apparel that attired them, the savage fierceness and bold confidence wiiich they assum¬ ed, alarmed her sensitive mind, and scarcely had the repast concluded, ere, pleading sudden indisposition, accom¬ panied by Matilda, and contrary to the earnest intreaties of Oswald, she with¬ drew. Till grey twilight had veiled the castle, Lady Fitz Alan and Issena amused themselves in conversing on the manners and appearance of their guests ; their sentiments were mutual on the occasion, but the former, fearfuFof ' terrifying her child/concealed tlie dark suspicions which ber bosom harboured, by drawing bappy conclusions to Issena's fertile suggestions; at leiigth, in order to drive away painful reflec¬ tion, Matilda requested her to take the
t 363 ]
the lute, and accompany with its mellow chords the artless ballad of the Pilgrim Boy: but scarcely had her fin¬ ger's wandered oyer the instrument, ere the ioud and tumultuous sound of mirth, echoed from the hail ; terrified Issena clung, to her mother for pro¬ tection, as the voices of two persons, warm in anger, assailed their fearfully, attentive ears, and in an instant after, some one tapped lightly for admission, at the door of the apartment. "Who knocks?" enquired Lady Fitz Allen, struggling with her emo¬ tion. "Annette my Lady/'replied a faint voice. Matilda instantly drew aside the bolt, as Annette made her appearance in the chamber, and hastily closing the door exclaimed in a voice of terror " ? my Lady,we shall surely be murdered!" G Murdered
[?63 ] " Murdered ! " faultered Matilda, and Tssena, in a breath. "Yes my Lady-Mhe Baron has beea disputing with one of the company called Leopold the knight, till at last, they drew their swords and fell despe¬ rately on each other— tis all on your account Lady Issena." "Mine Annette! mine! shuddered Issena. " Yes my Lady,for the Baron saying that you were [uncommonly beautiful, and that he felt half resolved to marry you, Leopold exclaimed/'marry indeed, i pretty resolution for Oswold;—to the daughter of Evlin too.'' At these words the Baron appeared angry, when the former speaking something to him in an under tone, he became furious, and Leopold, deeply wounded, was conveyed to his couch as I left the hall" "Merciful heaven !" cried Issena> bursting
f 364 ? bursting into tears, " what will become of us, friendless, unprotected, as we are. " "Ah! continued Annette,"Donalbaine «ays, this is nothing in comparison, to some of the Baron's, deeds when in an¬ ger, to which he has been a freguent and unwilling witness*" " Help ! help í Annette," exclaimed Lady Matilda, observing Issena fain¬ ting ; and opening the balcony, for the admission of air, how great was her surprise at beholding the Baron and his company on horseback,winding through the valley by -moonlight, in the direct path to St. Julien *s—a thousand wild conjectures now flashed with additional force across Matilda's raind,and the dis¬ tress which Issena evinced, added so materially to her alarm that she was under the necessity of retiring to G2 her
her couch. The anguish of her parent, was ever a formidable opponent to any apprehension which Issena endured only for herself, and speedily forget¬ ting the fears wh ich had recently inva¬ ded her bosom, she hung with the genial tenderness of filial affection over the pillow of her widowed mother—and, - administering cheering restoratives with her own hand, endeavoured at the same period, to inspire her with fortitude and implicit reliance on the benign and in¬ visible aid, which is ever extended in the hour of peril, to preserve the innocent sufferer from the triumphs of guilt. It was the design of Oswold, during his residence at the Castle, to hold a solemn Tournament, and to which, he intended to invite all the neighbouring Barons ; but, as a mark of respect to the venerable house of St Julien, he re¬ solved, accompanied by his friends, to i invite
[5ββ]
invite the Earl in person.—This there¬ fore was alone the object of his present visit to the mansion of Reginald. After some little formality, the Earl irresolutely consented to accept the in¬ vitation of Oswold, on condition that he passed the remainder of the night and following day at St. Julien's, which being readily acceded to, a costly ban¬ quet was prepared, in the course of which, Reginald, having united with his unexpected guests, in numberless pled¬ ges of the mellow goblet, related to Oswald his former adventure with Matilda. Oswald, whose everactive, designing mind, might well serve as a contrast to the cold and insipid turn of Reginald, with latent emotions of contempt,laugh- ed at the recital of Matilda's escape, and drank to the speedy renewal of their G3 acquaintance

The following day ivas passed in the chase and revelry ; till Oswald, at a late hour withdrew from St Julien's, in order to be in readine ? for the guests, expected, early the fol¬ lowing morning, at his Castle,—Shortly after his departure, Reginald informed Valentine of his? design, of being pre¬ sent at the Tournament, "at which/* added he, * c you have now an opportu* nity of signalizing yourself in arms, agreeable to the frequent wish you have professed. Thus, St. Julien, who had but a short period since censured Va¬ lentine for his approach ? the Castle of Oswald, wounded in pride, and by the raillery of a total stranger, descended, in defiance of all former resolves, to the committal of an action, which, while contrary to his inclinations, he bad adeemed highly reprehensible ; such however is the wayward nature of man; an observing spectator only of his kin-
[368] dred, he readily censures the apparent improprieties of others, while blindly unconscious of bis own defects, as alive only to his own feelings, he tamely co- en cides with peculiar circumstances, and enventually plunges into deeper errors than those he condemns. With the earliest streak of dawn, Va¬ lentine left his couch, and hastening to the armoury, selected a suit of blue and silver mail, on the helmet of which ap¬ peared a lamb, bearing the cross, sur· mounted by a rich plume of white fea« thers—bis shield, of azure, studded with bossy fstars, encircling the appropriate but rude motto, in dead gold, mitit aibe tüt (taute Valentine's heart glowed with love and enthusiasm as he equipped himself for tbe encounter— (i Yes" said he, in¬ ternally/! shall again behold rny Issena, and perhaps, Victor in tbe combat, G 4 kneel

His youthful breast pregnant with these emotions, he attended the summons of St Julien, who, since the nocturnal visit of the Black Robber, im/ continued to treat him with less seven.}· it was not, that Reginald either wish¬ ed, or dreaded a meeting with Matilda, for his sluggard thoughts seldom wan¬ dered, voluntarily, beyond the familiar and domestic objects which contributed to his ease or satisfaction, that he thus, in opposition to his natural inclinations, resolved to attend the bidding of Baron Oswold ; but rather, owing to one of those peculiar effects of chance which sometimes lead us/hyuneacountable pre· pensitiesjntocircumirtanceaviuffularand absurd. The

The inner court of Oswald Castle, hung with sumptuous tapestry, wa· already thronged with numberless spec¬ tators, assembled to witness the Tonna- ment ; near the folding doors, of the hall, beneath an extensive awning of embroidered silk, and attended by a concourse of Ladies, Matilda, at the earnest intreaties of the Baron,had con¬ sented to behold the combat; while Issena, on the present-occasion, divested of her sable weeds,and attired in virgin white, on a couch of rose coloured satin, overhung witb a plume, and canopy of spangled drapery, holding on her fair arm a richly jewelled searf, to be bes¬ towed on the Victor ofthe day, sat queen ofthe admiring throng. At the accustomed signal, several Knights, entering, fought with one of unusual bravery and strength, who, in defiance of every effort to the contrary* G o seemed
? ãn ] seemed likely to win the prize, for which, observing his uncommon skill,tew cared to dispute; but,as he still proudly paced the ring, and commanded the Heralds in haughty tones to proclaim again his challenge, Valentine, mounted ona stead of snowy whiteness, whose, ample trappings corresponded with the armour of its rider, made his appearance ; and after a combat of unusual length, suc¬ ceeded in throwing his adversary to the r ground, who retiring in confusion, the challenge was again thrice sounded f but no one answering to the summons, the youth at length, amid the shouts of the multitude, lifting up his beavor, cast himself at Issena's feet, in order to re¬ ceive the scarf; overjoyed at the sight of her beloved Valentine, with trembling hands, she hastily threw over his shoul¬ der the sparkling reward of his valour, find raising him with a smile of jo3',con« giatulated him>not more warmly on his success
[37âJ success than she welcomed hie arrival tt the Castle. Oswold,. who had been a silent ob* server of Issena's countenance, mad with jealousy, now rushed into the lists,"no** cried he/' for the honour of true knight¬ hood, I shall not permit the triumph of a total stranger, but await to dispute the prize/' Valentine, at these words, im¬ printing a respectful kiss on Issena's fair hand, conducted her again to the eanopy, and drawing his sword, rushed towards the Baron, who, exhausted with fury, resigned, as Wooldenberg renew¬ ed the attack,ere Valentine had leisure to recover; the blast of a horn, now eehoed through the Castle gates, and a Knight in gold armour, mounted on a black charger, and accompanied by a long train of warlike attendants, clad in forest green, galloped furiously into the court. G6 At
[ 3X3 ] At the unexpected appearance of this martial band, a mingled tone of won¬ der and applause prevailed through the multitude—as the Knight in gold ar¬ mour resigned his charger to a pag^md "drawing his sword, approached Baron Oswold* " wretch** he exclaimed inan indignant tone, " will not the unoffend¬ ing blood of one süflice, but you must continue to shed that of innocence ?*' at these words, Oswold would fain have re¬ tired among the company, but striking him with his weapon " come" cried the Knight, " thou proud and guilty Baron and dispute this prize with one as well skilled in chivalry as yourself, and who neither fears your ange r,nor revenge!" bursting with passion Oswold now fiercely parried the skilful flows of his assailant, but his furious efforts availed not, and easily discomfitted, disgraced^ and confounded, he abruptly retired, amid the loud derisions and repeated shouts ofthe assembly. Now
Γ 374] " Now then/' said the stranger; gracefuly receiving the scarf from İse- na, which Valentine had resigned, ' f the prize is mine, and I restore it to the person, that I understand, to be ib rightful owner/' and presenting it to the youth, he lightly vaulted to bis sad¬ dle, and waving his hand with dignity, accompanied by his attendants, hasten¬ ed from the Castle. No sooner had iie withdrawn, than aery of alarm prevail¬ ed, and the people forming* «»roups en¬ quired the name of this mysterious war¬ rior, when suddenly,the Black Robber? the Black Robber ? responded from lip to lip, ladies fainted—the guests, in wild contusion, hurried to their homes, and Issena, after taking a tender leave of Valentine, followed Lady Fitz-Alan in¬ stantly to her private apartment. As Reginald did not present himself to Lady Matilda, it never occurred to her
? 375 ] fier mind, that he was present at the Tournament, till looking from the bal¬ cony, during the evening, she beheld him in conversation with Oswold ; a sud¬ den dizziness overcame her senses, and a dreadful conviction of the result of their secret communion pressed fear¬ fully upon her heart—she now medi¬ tated on the strange conduct of Baron Oswold, and the words of the unknown* Knight forcibly returned to her recol¬ lection, "wretch, will not theunojfend¬ ing blood of one süflice but you must continue to shed that of innocence?" miserable apprehension ! had this mys¬ terious in re r roga tion any allusion to her lost Evlin ? if so, dreadful indeed was the storm of inevitable woe and calamity, gathering, with dark and ran¬ corous aspect, over the devoted head* of herself and orphan. Labouring un,der gloomy and dis¬ tracted
? 376] traded thoughts, till a late hour, Matil¬ da retired, but not to rest; the confer* rence of Oswold with the weak minded Reginald, to whom he was almost a stranger, continued wildly to barrase her nervous apprehensions—and sbe wept for the fate of Issena, as the intelli¬ gence of Annette, respecting the occur¬ rence at the banquet table, fluctuated through her mind. Oswald, in company vvith Reginald, had again repaired to St. Julien's, and the clork was proclaiming the solemn period of midnight, as Issena, dejected, and oppressed, with an unusual presen¬ timent of something dreadful, about to occur, still sat despondingly upon her couch, as the calmness of ?? ht- became suddenly Interrupted by the approach of horses in the valley,and supposing it to be the Baron returned, sbe silently oppeaed the lattice; bul the night being unusually
[377 J
trn usually dark, and stormy, it was in vain, she endeavoured to distinguish the surrounding object?, while the wind, howling mournfully through the bat- tlement.% and the Warder's heavy tread, receding along the ramparts, as it died away round some distant angle of the gothic pile, added fresh solemnity to the sullen hour, by leaving an awful silence on the timidly attentive ear. Closing the casement, Issena cast her eyes fearfully across the chamber, as the apparent sound of some one breathing therein, arrested her attention ; horror, struck, for a moment irresolute, and half douting it to be the effect of the night breeze, as it whispered through the adjoining galleries, she took the lamp and examined the tapestry, but dis¬ covering no cause for her fears, be* came composed ; and approaching the crusifix, in order to offer her humble prayers
? 378 3 prayers to heaven, previous to retiring to rest, the lamp suddenly flash¬ ed and expired : however, as the faint, flickering moon-light, fell upon the floor,castingthereon,in grotesque forms, the net work of the lattice, and afford¬ ing sufficient lustre to discover familiar objects, Issena silently sank to devo¬ tion, when the same sound, again struck her terrified imagination, and, gazing around, she observed the door slowly and cautiously unclosed by a mailed hand, in which, a drawn dagger reflec¬ ted the opposite light. Terrified, at a circumstance so singular, Issena, »creamed aloud, as Wooldcnberg rush¬ ed into the apartment, and throwing a heavy mantle over her features, for¬ cibly conveyed her through the gal¬ lery—almost fainting, our heroine soon felt the chill night air keenly on her confined hands, and perceived, by the motion of some carriage, into which her remorseless.

Issena earnestly prayed for the repose of Leopold's soul, when throwing over the corse a cloak, which hung in the apartment, she reti¬ red to a rugged couch in an adjacent recess, and resigned herself to reflec¬ tion. A feeble ray of light only, fell from an iron grating, far above her reach,—■ over which some envious ivy mantling, witheid the more cheering sunbeam, which else bad illumined her desolate so¬ litude :—the walls of the hut, consisting of rugged fragments of stone, wildly heaped together, divested of covering, appeared green with dampness ; while a heavy iron chain,suspended therefrom, H 2 betrayed

[395] "Good heavens Γ' cried she,"my Lord, do you perceive those strangers/' " Yes, " answered Oswold, applying his hunting horn to his lips, "they came from St. Julien's, to escort you to the mansion of Earl Reginald, who Jstill loves you, and, pitying your friendless state, would fain shelter it under his own protection.'* " Ah! wretch f ' exclaimed the frantic JLady, « I am now fully sensible of your perfidy—my child, my poor Issena, she too is in your power,—but, mark me, mark me Oswald ; the curse of God— the Widow's curse is on thee—and as by her you act, the daughter of Evlin, may heaven act with thee, most diabo¬ lical of men ; nor till your dark heart turn from treacherous, impious deeds, shall that all-sufficient Power, which hears my humble voice, cease to op¬ press thee." As Matilda thus spoke Η & assuming
[ 396 ] assuming almost a supernatural form, she raised her eyes and hands to hea- ven,while the bitterness of her anguish mingling with the earnestness of her curse, cast a ray of wild melancholy over her features, which imparted a chilling awe to the atheistical heart of Oswold* For a while, Matilda remained as it were, torpid, till awakened to a full sense of her misery, (by the rude grasp of the ruffians, about to convey ber to St. Julien's, under circumstances still more agonizing, than those, which had formerly attended her to that detested pile) loudly did she shriek for assistance, when Valentine, who lingered near his favorite solitude,rushed to the spot, and, drawing his sword, was driving off the assailants, as Oswold, with the ma¬ lice of a Demon, suddenly seized Ma¬ tilda's arm, and unsheathing his dagger, plunged
Γ 397 3 plnnged it into her bosom—*senseless, she sank from the dizzy verge of the cliff, as snatching the horn, suspended to his girdle, Oswold repeated several shrill blasts in order to summoa his minions to renew the attack, and fol¬ lowing Valentine down the steep, the youth, overpowered by numbers was necessitated to resign his sword and become the Baron's captive, who accu¬ sing him of Lady Fitz Alanos murderand affecting unusual concern, commanded: him, in defiance of threats and resis¬ tance, to be dragged to the Castle, and imprisoned in one of its remotest dun.- geons, Alone, and in total darkness, Valen¬ tine,, perfectly at a loss to comprehend: the meaning of these singular transacti¬ ons, endeavoured,, but in vain,, to diV cover a élue to the designs of Oswold;, his meditations however, like the wan¬ dering*
[398] derings of some benighted traveller, through the inextricable mazes uf a; trackless labyrinth, terminated in un¬ certain conjecture and visionary ideas. was it possible to imagine, that Regi¬ nald, who had protected and cherished his earlier years, should thus seek to de¬ prive him of liberty, or perhaps, exist¬ ence? would he not rather, have pre¬ served the purity of his stainless hand, by forbidding him to return to those towers,the friendly shelter of which had so long fostered him—"Come then 1 * internally cried Valentine " thou early beaming dawn, at which, the benefac¬ tor of years past, shall proudly demand my ransom, and hapty, the mysterious conduct of Oswold, be punished, as it evidently merits" but alas! Valentine was little prepared to avert the dire and malignant storm of adversity hang¬ in«* in dark clouds over his unconsci- ous head, and ready to burst with re¬ lentless fury thereon. Odl

Va¬ lentine now entering the chamber judge of his consternation at beholding it fill¬ ed with strangers; while Reginald and Oswald, exalted on a covered seat, at the upper end, appeared in all the so¬ lemnity of Judges, on a formal trial. Oswold, uttlred in deep mourning, after a pause, addressing himself to the astonished Valentine, exclaimed, "Un¬ happy youth í from what horrible mo¬ tive, at years so tender, you may have been induced to commit an act, at which humanity shudders and human natpre revolts, is best known to the la. tent workings of your own breast, Vain has been our search for the corse of that unfortunate Lady, yesterday preci- pitated, by you, from the cliffs/' Ah

"Ab!" éried Valentíne, "that God, in whose infinite disposal of events 1 confide, will bear witness for my inno¬ cence. «Boy í '' interrupted, Reginald, "how was it, that, contrary to my frequent mandates, you were yesterday wander¬ ing near the Castle of Oswold. " " My Lord ! " continued, Valentine, proudly, "does it become you, thus to coincide with the unheard of guilt of others ; and to the disgrace of the no¬ ble house of St. Julien, condemn the innocent for the guilty? have I ever my Lord, by a single action of my past life, evinced a symptom of thus readily steeping my hands in the blood of a fellow creature ?—the callous heart of the Assassin- and the remorseless grasp of infamy, are not momentarily steeled
? «? j steeled to evil;, how-then', would it have been possible for me, a friendless, out¬ cast boy, at once, to have plunged in¬ to vice, atrocious and unparalleled—-at committal of which, the most daring HuffiaB might have shuddered. " " I &now not," interrupted Oswold, scornfully, " how far this artful equivo¬ cation may conduce to preserve your reputation, but this I know, that it has ever been deemed singular, when a being of such an imaculate nature, as you profess yourself to inherit, is pro¬ tected by noctural and mysterious vi¬ sitants, selected from the vile and heart¬ less Banditti of the forest—can it be imagined by the spectators present, who witnessed, on 4he day of the Tourna¬ ment, with what avidity, at some pri¬ vate signal, the Black Robber, and his lawless train flew to your aid, how one so young, and so outwardly inno¬ cent
? 402] / eent, should be so well acquainted with the designs and motions of such depre¬ dators? has not also a similar occurrence transpired, beneath the walls of your Benefactor, which ought methinks, by gratitude, to have been rendered too facred for the violation of unhallowed guests." (< Alas ?* replied Valentine, sighing at a conviction of the net of suspicion in which OaSwald had but too well entwi¬ ned him, * f how, and from what motive 1 received the interferance ofthe Black Robber, on the occasions you mention, I am yet to learn ; as 1 am, the cause wbicb impels you to persecute me ; unless at the instigation of revenge for ------" ξζ Peace!" interrupted Oswald,abrupt— ly» "were not mine own eyes witness to your baseness, and also those of my long- tried

' "O thou ! who rules! the thunder bolt« of heaven—alhvise, allnoting God! defend me from the machinations of this man and his vile confederates, (i exclai¬ med the youth in an attidude of sup¬ plication—while bis hand,wandering to his beating heart,betrayed the glittering chain ofthe minature, presented to him ?? Issena, at their last interview, among the hills of Yarrow. "What isit I see? " cried Reginald pointing to the brilliant;—?onfused, Valentine hastily snatched his mantle across his breast. "Ha! M articulated Oswold, "let no¬ thing be concealed." " No my Lord; 0 answered Valen¬ tine, baughtly, " nothing shall be conV cealed
[404] eealed ; to save me from disgrace,hap!y, the Lady Issena herself, will acknow¬ ledge the means by which this portrait came¡ into my possession, otherwise, a solemn injunction prevents the disclo¬ sure, from me." r< This artifice'' continued Oswold in a tone of triumph "but too amply con¬ victs thee ; since well thou knovvest, the gentle Lady Issena, is remote from the Castle— Hed, probably under thy pro¬ tection, to share the Bandit's perils. * "Unmanly, designing dastard' cried Valentine, snatching a sword, ** has then my lesena too, fallen into thy fell coil ? but, yes proud Cbwo!d,the injured friendless Valentine, demands her at your hands, or thus in defiance of the world, friends, kindred, foes, wreak on yotal head, a much wronged lover's vengeance—" at the conclusion of this sentence
[405 J sentence, frantic, with despair and an¬ guish, he rushed towards Oswold, who, pale with dismay, was sinking at his feet, as the attendants wrested the weapon from the desperate hand which overhung him. "Assassin! 1 * exclaimed Reginald, sternly bending his eye on the phren¬ zied youth, " a thousand recollections now rush upon my mind, to dishonor thee." Valentine endeavoured to speak, but Oswold in a voice of imperitave thunder, commanded the guards to drag him to the northern dungeon, till his guilt could be amply proved and his fate fully decided upon, when abruptly taking the arm of St. Julien, he suddenly departed from the council chamber.

** Remember ................... , The ways óf heaven are dark and ini ricaie, Puzzled in mazes, and perplex'd in errors ; Our understanding traces th«m in vain« Loit and bewildered in the fruitless search, Nor sees with how much art the windings run, Kor where the regular confusion ends." Addison.
ON recovering from a state of torpor, into which, the bitterness of oppression had thrown hitn, Valentine glanced with wild enquiry across the extent of his murky
[ 407 j murky dungeon ; through which, a fee¬ ble ray of light, shedding, its nig¬ gard influence, increased, rather than diminished the horrors of surrounding gloom. Taking the lamp, he proceed¬ ed more narrowly to examine the limits of his prison, and discovered in its extre¬ mity, that,from the result of many years, an immense body of the cavern, labour¬ ing ander the weight of some part of the Castle which it supported, had fallen in, forming an opening sufficient to ad¬ mit an entrance into the adjoining vault. Filled with hope, he continued to explore the dark celatili it led him in¬ to a sepulchre, immediately under the Chapel, which, for many, many genera¬ tions, had received the ashes of the dead, belonging to the noble house of Fitz Âîan Holding his lamp to the earth, Valentine beheld, vvith emotions of awe, that he stood near the corse of Evlin, the murdered father of his beloved and lost
[ 408 ] lost Issena ; and,as he ruminated on the untimely end of that virtuous being, a sudden flash of conviction rushed across his mind, that Oswold was the assassin. tí And will heaven" sighed he, "permit such impious actions to escupe the re¬ ward they merit? ah no !'*— f( ah no '."re¬ sponded a hollow voice, and Valentine, starting, for a moment, listened to hear if it continued ; but recollecting,in such a place, it could only be the eflect of some echo, he prepared to retire, lest his absence should be discovered ; and scarcely had he reached his dungeon, erethelamp, with a sudden convulsi¬ on, expired. In the mean time, Oswold,vvhose per¬ nicious genius had completely mastered the inanimate nature of St. Julien, and subdued him to a state of perfect subjection, was proudly seated at the gay banquet, surrounded by the base ministe
? 409 ] nisters of his guilty pleasures ; the loud and horrid burst of obscene mirth—the voluptuous strain of the minstrel, and the copious draught of the high-foaming goblet, alternately conspired to erase the remembrance of his crimes :—the clock had already exceeded the mid¬ night hour, ere Reginald, buried in intoxication, was insensibly placed in a covered litter and conveyed by his vassals to St Julien's: thatsun,however, which descended on his early libations, to Bacchus, beamed, with returning lus¬ tre, on his unconscious corse. Thus died, unloved and unlamented, the Brother of Ulric; whose life like the wild and useless weed, filled up, or ra¬ ther usurped, a blank in creation!— could his most glaring offences, subject to,and serving as apathetic instruments of some master spirit, be denomiated voluntary crimes?—or did the apathetic bounty
£410 1 bounty of his hand, though it might be liberal, and tbe indifference of bis heart towards guilt, deserve the appel¬ lation of goodness ? probally Reginald, in a true sense of reflection, bad more cause to lament the mistaken pride ,of his father,than even Ulric; familiar with, and accustomed from his earliest years to the appendagesof luxury—the acute¬ ness of his sensibility grew callous from lack of experience—and the vigour of his intellect became nearly torpid, by the inanity of his station in lifo; —he knew not indeed, the heartriving pang of adversity, but equally strangers to his breast were the exquisite emanations of of self-approving virtue—the warm and deliefous |rj.ow of genuine love^—the wild ■í transportor the soul,as it soars with ad- miripg rapture to the contemplation of heavenly objects, and expands with gra¬ titude, towards the £rreat God of Na- turecas he gems immeasurable sp^ee with I myriacb

Upon thè Church threshold Sír Hildebrand died, His head m the Church and his heels outside ; While his sons stood round and euch other greeted, To think how their Father the Wood Fiend had cheated. Tssena could not avoid smiling at the absurd conclusion of this wretched com¬ position, and., throwing down the book, resorted again to the lattice. The mist which ovehtmg the face of nature had disappeared, but, the place of her con¬ finement, being shrouded in wood, she was prevented from enjoying the beau¬ ties of prospect, the birds were merrily pipingtheir matin songs— Issena sighed as she compared their happy state to her σψη* '**They are free'* she mentally exclaimed,*' they can rejoice with the rising sun, and repose vvith its settting beams;—for me, I can but weep soli- tarily ever the sorrows of life, and la- ment that tbe society of those I love, is denied

denied me; Lost in such sad reflections she continued to lean upon her hand, as the sound of footsteps wandering near, excited her curiosity, and retiring a little, she observed Wooldenberg, with another of Oswold's creatures, ap¬ proaching the spot where she was stan¬ ding. " How say you?'' enquired the for¬ mer, are we to bring back the murdered corse of Leopold ? have we not had sufficient trouble with it already? besides 4m interr'd i'the earth.—" " No matter! " answered the other it must be returned to the Castle, the Ba¬ ron has an immediate use for it ; but you need not alarm yourself about the con¬ veyance, Conrade and myself having brought a litter to bear it hence ; but in case the Baron does not arrive within six days, you ßte to bring the girl back.» What
[432] <ζ What the devil is Oswold at nowí" cried Wooldenburg angrily. * ζ ? ! we have had at rial at the Castle ; young Valentine of St. Juliens, is Os- wold's prisoner ; for you must know,the Baron having consented to place Lady Fitz Alan in Reginald's power,decoyed her, under pretence of looking for Is¬ sena, among the wild cliffs of Yarrow ; but, from some motive or other,Matilda suspecting Oswold's treachery screamed loudly for assistance, when Valentine being near the spot, rushed to her aid, while wc, all the time concealed be¬ neath the underwood, now interposing, turned the sword of the gallant boy upon ourselves, as Oswold, seldom at a loss in cases of extremity, stabbed, and precipitated the fainting Lady into the glen. 0 At this dreadful intelligence a cold dew
[ *3* J •dew hung upon Issena's br#w fc *a sudden dizziness rushed across,, her brain, and» almost fainting, she clung to the corri¬ dor for support " Well, but what is he going to do with Leopold after all ? ,f continued Wooldenberg. tc Why, as Lady Pitz Alan's body in not discoverable, he means to make that of Leopold personate it and thus give plausibility to the murder for which Va¬ ktine is arraigned and condemned—ha! ha! hal" " But what says Reginald?** " OMie says nothfo^*' * "' ' "How?" ^ ' ♦ " Why, by making a sudden exit inte another world, he has nQt only saved himself the trouble of interfering, but Öswold that of planing his death." They now retired forthér foran, the ? balcony
[433 3
balcony which prevented Issena from discovering the nature of their conversa-* tion; still could she hear their horrid bursts of laughter at a distance, and the name of the Black Robber, as it fre¬ quently escaped their lips. Alarmed beyond measure, Issena now sank on the gothic couch—her senses appeared wildly disordered—her whole frame convulsed with anguish and ter¬ ror, till unable to support her sufferings, she fell senseless to the ground. In this situation she was discovered by Barba¬ ra, who imagining that her charge had adopted some unnatural means of depri¬ ving herself of existence, was pre¬ paring to quit the apartment, as a deep sigh from Issena, convinced her that she had only swooned, when raising her from the floor, " St. Lawrence beprai- sed' cried the old woman, * f methought you were dead I*' vol n, ?

*^Alas no l' sighed Issena» faintly, ** the dead are at peace—such anguish as tortures my heart, molests not their repose 4 —than thus survn r e them, me-* thinks, twere better to be what we de¬ plore.

Barbara continued, " true, I cannot with so much learning, express my sen^ timents on such an awful subject, as youríLadyship ; and yet, I must say,that every f one M wbp thinks abou t an here* after, should make peace with God a few years before death.

" " Let every one to heaven his owe way, " muttered Barbara, indignantly ; *' but come, the breakfast is prepared, and the Cavaliers wait for your pre¬ sence to commence it " Issena silently followed Barbara in¬ to another apartment, for although her heart was too full, to partake /of amy refreshment, she was deeply anxious to learn somthing further respecting the proceedings at the Castle ; in this how¬ ever, she was disappointed, for the Ruf¬ fians having taken their meal in «ullen silence, abruptly retired. ? 2 This
[43β] Thus some time elapsed, and Oswold came not; at length Wooldenberg infor- riiediief, that she must prepare imme¬ diately to tettírn to her horn e. " Alas ? 9 sighed Issena, "how are my feelings changed,since those delightful moments when, after a short absence, I antici¬ pated the rapture of once more throw¬ ing myself into the arms of my mother; wha now, dreadful reflection, lies un- buried,—a prey to the gaunt wolf and midnight storm, " Ulric and Valentine were busily con¬ verging in low tones, ?& they heard the footsteps of some persons approaching, and Valentine,who was in the dungeon of the former, had scarcely escaped to his own, ere the door of St, Julien'* place of confinement was slowly un- closed, and Gregory, accompanied by the guard, made his appearance.

Gregory smiled, and the two prisoners,labouring under the weight of their fetters,followed him for some time, in silence, till coming to a vaulted door, which Gregory opened, and producing a dark lanthorn, they continued, to proceed through a subterranean passage till the night air, blowing keenly on their faces, awoke them once again to the charms of liberty. As they emerged from the earth,hor- ses were standing in readiness to convey them rapidly from the spot; and having, by the use of forged keys, taken off their fetters, Gregory, presenting Ulric with a purse of gold, implored him to lose no time in following his guide to a place of safety, already prepared for his recepti- K4 on

At the conclusion of this unskilful, but honest epistle, Ulric received from Phil¬ ip the packet and ring designed for Ro¬ dolpha, with change of raiment for him¬ self and Valentine, which assuming, and rewarding the host, they prepared to continued

It would be useless for u» to repeat each individual circumstanceas it befel them, till ariiving at tbe cabin of a Fisherman, situated on the flowery banks of a romantic stream in Clydes¬ dale wood, Philip abruptly paused, and descending from his horse, knocked loudly at the door, as the host, making bis appearance, received from the dumb boy,his letters,addressed by Gregory ;— after perusing them with some Httle de¬ gree of attention,he took off his bonnet, and appmaching Ulric, respectfully wel- comedhim to bis lowly habitation—offer¬ ing, at sunrise, to convey him up.the Clyde, as far as Illínglairn Castle : bis skiff being already prepared for his re¬ ception.

On the following morning ho#- ever, awakened by tbe tuneful songs of forest birds, the Earl descended from his chamber, and finding every thing in readiness for his departure, immedi¬ ately summoned Valentine to attend ; and taking leave of the Dumb Boy (who was to be accompanied on his journey back, by one of the Fisherman's sons,) enter¬ ed the little bark, which, lightly scud¬ ding before the breeze,rapidiy convey· ed tbem towards the spires of Illín¬ glairn. As they continued to glide along the smooth and transparent surface of the sky-refleetirtg water, a thousand charms of

of luxuriant nature, conspired to thrill * with wild emotion í 4he nervous sóul of Valentiae-*-Hbut a sigh.of anguish would freqnenfly escape liis breast, as he re¬ gretted that Issena, his much loved 1s- sena/^was far remote from the scene of hisiwanderings,andperhaps,ìike a blight¬ ed .flower fíinkin^f beneath the craelty of her iron-hesjrted oppressor, Now meandering neath wood-crown¬ ed, romantic cliffs, which flinging their flow* ry sprays athwart the silver current, seemed to clasp the laughing riplings of the flood, as they eddied from the sleepy dashings of the oar;—and now, driven by the brisk zephyrs through glens covered with brake n -wood, in which the lone cabin, and ha^gjng her¬ mitage, the latter distinguished by its litt|e ^_??<? alternately excjted, their admiration, foe Fisherman suddenly steered hJiferJt Jito a creejs^phich in a few

Ì ..'S The Fisherman: no# pausing 'at a flight of marble stairs, which descended even into the Lake; requested Ulric and Valentine to land j when, fastening his yessel toan adjoining ''tree, he prepared ? conduct them to the Castle. As tllrip passed the gay terraces and shady bowers, rendered by slsilful hands doubly »educing, he could not refrain from i ob¬ serving to Valetttine, that unusual taste appeared to vie with nature in ren¬ dering this lovely spot most exquisitely captivating

At which the Fisherman informed them, that lÆidy Rodolpha, who had passed much of her life in foreign courts, delighted in fashioning her own abode, after the manner of ethers-which she had witnessed abroad. At length, arriving at the magnifi¬ cent portico, which conducted to the in¬ terior of the mansion, Ulric, delivering Gregory's packet with the ring, desired they might instantly be conveyed to the Lady of Illinglairn^—the attendant shortly after returning, and requesting ??? tò follow, he was ushered into the presence of Rodolpha. Never, but once,had Ulric beheld charms like hers.

The Baron gazed with surprise a,** he observed Issena's corse-like features; while, drawing near the couch and ten¬ derly taking her listless hand, he enqui¬ red after her health. At that voice, the absorbed faculties of Issena rushed back to their natural force, and starting from her attitude of woe " monster !'* she ex¬ claimed " unhand me—let not thy mur¬ derous grasp pollute mine arm—unless indeed, thou canst restore my parent, or my v alenline.

Annette trembled violently, but Issena, taking the lamp, proceeded to explore the mysterious opening. "For Heaven's sake forbear/* ex¬ claimed Annette, "weshall be killed." <* Aïs*«.*' ***ii*«««*>*-l T«.«™« r f-ViA« WA nnt **.«.j . w v.-»* »»·_.-* ????^?»!.*, muy wc nui also perish here?—summon up your resolution

The gallery led to a suite of apart¬ ments in the northern wing of the Castle, which had not been inhabited for many many years, because one of the Barons of Fitz Alan, who had put a period to his existence, was said to walk there at midnight: Issena and Annette, now entered a desolate chamber,which open¬ ed to a corridor ; and, noticing that the door,through which they had obtain¬ ed admission, was secreted after the same manner as the one by which they had entered the gallery, Issena observed to Annette, that haply this communica¬ tion between the two chambers, being constructed in olden times, was un¬ known
(467 J known even to Oswold ; and,raîsing thè lamp, " whats that ? " she continued with quickness,pointingto the longfoldli of dark velvet which covered the corri¬ dor. Annette started af the enqui¬ ry and, clinging still nearer to Issena," refused to look around the apartment. "Shall I draw aside this drapery ?"en- quired Issena, te it may conceal some new outlet.

" Issena gazed earnestly fora moments a dreadful thought rushed to her almost distracted imagination —at length, re¬ collecting herself, and dividing the gra¬ pery of surHcient width to admit the mys of the lamp. tf O God ?* she shrieked and rushed towards Annette, her limbs trembling—her lips deadly pale :—what she had witnessed was a sight

Each in fearful silence noted the tar? dy hour, as the sullen echo of the castle clock proclaimed it; at length the rosy beam of dawn began to glimmer in the east¿ —and never, ? never! had they welcomed it so gladly. Shocked be¬ yond measure by the myste/ ious secret of the corridor, and deeply oppressed with fatigue, Issena,now sinking on her couch, requested Annette to enter the Baron's apartment, and plead severe in¬ disposition, as an excuse for her non-ap¬ pearance at the breakfast table. Oswold assuming looks of contrition for.the effects of his late anger, presen- ted Annette with a piece of goldas^ ????? ? ence for the alarm into which he had

With a heavy heart, Annette com¬ municated this intelligence to her lady. "Yes" said Issena, "1 will see him, alone ; if it be the decree of providence that I should fall by his band, my feeble opposition could prove but of little avail—besides, " why may I not demand my liberty—am I cither Oswold's vassal or his prisoner, that he presumes to restrain my inclinations ? " "Ah lady!" sighed Annette "if he should design to slay thee." u E'en let him then," answered Is¬ sena, wiping a tear from her eye ; rf he bas already slain such as were dearer to me

of his people. My mother's mind was inflamed with the greatnefs of my an¬ ceftors, and lhe indefatigably fought to- kindle in my bofom a iimilar flame. It has been a long-eftablilhed cuftom for the barons and feudal vaffals of the kings of France to enter with great perfonal expence into the brilliant and dazzling expeditions of their fove¬ reigns; and my father greatly impaired his fortune in preparations for that very campaign in whicli he terminated his lifo. My mother indmrrioufly ap¬ plied herfelf to the reftoration of my patrimony; and the long period of my minority afforded her fcope for tbat purpofe. It was impoffible for any boy to be treated with more kindnefs and confi¬ dente indulgence, than I was during the period of my adolefcence. My mother loved me to the very utmoft limits perhaps of human affection. I was her

112 TRAVELS Of СИ." By the incident I have mentioned., I was tranfported at once from a fcene of modeft obfeurity, to a fcene of the mod laviih fplendour that the world perhaps ever contemplated. I never remem¬ bered to have feen even Paris itfelf. The prevailing taste of Europe has for fome time led very much to colllinefs in drefs. This tafle, in its prefent pro¬ fufion, I believe took its rife in the field of the Vale of Ardres. The two kings were both in the vigour o f their youth, and were faid to be the hand- fomeft men of tbe age in which they Kved. The beauty of Henry was ftur¬ dy and mufcular; that of Francis more refined and elegant, without f.ibtraft- ing in any confiderable degree from the firmnefs of his make. Henry was four years older than his brother monarch. The firft of them might have been taken as a model to reprefent a youthful Hercules, and the lad an Apollo. The
The fplendour of drefs that waa worn upon this occafion, exceeds al¬ moft all credibilii Every perfon of diftinftion might be faid in a manner to carry an eftate upon his (houlders, nor was the vanety of garments infe¬ rior to the nchnefs Wolfey, a man whofe magnificence of difpofition was- only furpiflld by the pride of his foul/ wis for the moft part the dirertor or the whole He poffeffed the moft ab¬ folute afcendancy over the mind of his mafter, at the fame time that Trancis artfully indulged his caprice, tha·· hev might claim from him in return a finu- lai indulgence m weightier matters The pomp of procédions, and the ceremony of opening this memorable ielhval, went firft, a fort of folemn and hilf moving pageant, which the eye took In at leiture, and took m till it was filled This was fucceeded by everv thing that was rapid, animated and
and ıntereftıng tmfqucs and exhibí tions of all kinds, and which wis (till more to me, and which my foul de voured with mdefcribable ardour, juft ings, tilts and tournaments without end The beauty of the armour, the taparifons of the fteeds, the mettle of the animals themfelves, and the ardour and grace of the combatants, furpaffed every thing that my fancy hid ever painted Thefe feenes were afted m the midft of a vaft amphitheatre of fpeftators, where ill that wa.» noble and eminent of either country was affem bled, the manhnefs of afpirmg youth, and the boundlefb varieties of female attraftion All were in their giycit attire, every eye was lighted up with complacency and joy If Hcrachtus, or any other morofe plulofopher who has expatiated on the umverf il mifery of mankind, had entered the field of Aidres, he muft hive retrafted his affcrtions,

I was prefented to Francis the Firft. He did me the honour to queftion me ïefpefting my ftudies ; and, finding in me fonie knowledge of thofe arts and that Iitei ature, of which he was himfelf fo zealous a favourer, he expreffed to my uncle a great fatisfaftion with my figuie and acquifitions. I might from this time have been taken to court, and made one of the pages to this illuftrious monarch. But the plan of my mother was diffèrent. She did not wifli for the prefent that my eye lliould be fatiated with public feenes, or that the public ihould grow too fa¬ miliarly acquainted with my perfon. She rightly judged that my paffion for the theatre of glory would grow more impetuous, by being withheld for fome time from the gratifications for which it panted. She wiflied that I fiiould prefent myfelf for the fiift tims among the nobility of France an ac- complidicd
comphihad caviller, and not fuffer the difadvantage of having expofed in the eye of the world thofe falfe fteps and frailties, from which the inexperience of youth is never entirely ftee Thefe motives being explained to the king, he was gracioufiy pleafed to fanftion them with his approbation I atcor dmgly returned to finiih the courfe of my education at my paternal chateau upon the banks of the Garonne The ftate of my mind during the three fucceeding years, amply juftified the fagacity of my mother I was more eager for improvement than I had ever yet been I had before formed fome conceptions of the careci of ho nour, from the books I had read, aud from the converfition- of this excellent matron But my revenes w ere impo¬ tent and httle, compired with what I had now feen Like the author of our holy religion, I had fpent my forty dajs

G which

There Was however a confiderable difficulty attendant on this queftion.

My circles became more numerous than thofe of the marquis de Damvillc, and were condufted in a very different ftyle of fplcndour and profufion. I corref- ponded with Marguerite; but I con¬ tinually found fome new pretext for lengthening my flay ; and fhe on her part, though the kindeft and moft in¬ dulgent of women, became feriouily alarmed and unhappy, As

from anticipating that fpecies of guilt, and that fpecies of ruin, which foon after overwhelmed me. My mind did not once recur to the poffibility of any ferious mifchief. I dwelt only, as gamefters perhaps ufually do, upon the alternative between acquifition and no acquifition. I did not take into the account the ungovernablenefs of my own paffions. I alfumed it as unquef- tionable, that I could ftop when I pleafcd. The thoughts that tortured me were, in the firft place, thofe ofa fanguine and unexperienced adventurer in a lottery, whofe mind rolls uot for a moment upon the fum he hat, lifqued, but who, having in fancy the principal prize already in his poffeffion, and hav¬ ing diftributed it to various objefts and puïpofiîs, fometimes fearfully re¬ curs to the poffibility of his difeppoint- .ment, and anticipates with terror what swill be his fituation, if deprived of this

Though I was far from having di- gefted a fpecific plan of enriching mj¬ felf by thefe difcreditable means, yet the very tumult of my thoughts ope¬ rated ílrongly to lead me once more to the gaming table I was in no humour to bufy myfelf with my own thoughts, the calmnefs ot literary difcuffion, and the pohfhed interchange of wit, which had lately fo much delighted me, had now no attraction for my heart, the turbulence of a fcene of high play alone had pow er to diftraft mj atten¬ tion from the ftorm within I won a fécond time I felt tho rapidity and intenfenefs of my contemplations ftill further accelerated I will not over agam detail what they were.

CHAP. VI. İN the evening of the fame day, my beloved Margueiite arrived unexpeft- edly at Paris. In the beginning of our fepaiation, 1 had been to the laft de¬ gree punctual in my letters, I had no pleafure fo great, as retiring to my clofet, and pouring out my foul to the moft adorable of women. By degrees I relaxed in punftuahty. Ordinary occupations, however clofely purfued, have a method in them, that eafily combines with regularity in points of an incidental natuie. But gaming, when purfued with avidity, fubverts all or¬ der, and foices every avocation from the place afligned it. When my infane projeft of fupplying the inadequate- nefs of' my foitune by this expedient began
began to produce an effeft exaftly op polite, I could not but with the ex¬ trémed difficulty, dring my mind to write to the rnidrcfs of my foul I endeavoured not to think, with dif- tinftnefs and attention, of the perfons whofe happinefs was mod nearly ln- /olved with mme I find to myfelf, let another venture muft be tried, fortune diali change the ammofity with which die has lately purfued me, I will repair the breaches that have been fuf¬ tained , and I dull then return with tenfold avidity to fubjefts that at pre¬ fent I dare not fix my mind upon M) letters were accordingly ihort, un- irequent and uniatisfaftory , and thofe of Marguerite difcovered lncreafing mguiih, perluibation and anxiety. AVhit a change in the minds of both had the lapfe of a '<>w months produ¬ ced ' Not that my attachment had fuffered the diminution of a fingle par¬ ticle »
tide , but that attachment, vvhich had lately been the fource of our mutual felicity, was now fraught only with diftrefs My mind was filled with honors, and Margocritecxpefted from me an encouragement and confolation in abfc ce, which, alas, I had it not iri my power to gii e ' I had n w ι ontmued m Pans for a time vaftly gieater thin I had origi¬ nally piopofed After having remnned more than ten days without receiving one word of intelligence, a letter of mine was delivered to Marguerite, more fliort, myftenous and diftreffing to her feehngs, than any that had pre¬ ceded The ten days filence, from me who at firft had never miffed an oppor¬ tunity of pouring out my foul to her, and contributing to her pleafure, was exquifitely painful There is fcarcely any thing that produces fuch a ficknefs eÉ the heart, as the repeated proroga- 2 tion
tion of hope But, when the letter armed that had been fo anxioufly looked for, when the hind writing nt tho fupeifenption was reeogniled, when the letter was treafured up toi the impitiently defired moment ot fo¬ htude, tint ti e fiercd emotions of the heirt might fuffer no interruption, and when it at laft appeared fo cold, fo ominous, fo withering to the buds ot iffeftion, the deteimimtion of Mar¬ guerite was fpeediiy formed The re¬ lations that bound us together were ot too mighty a value, to be difpenfed or to be tufled with She felt them as the very cords of exiftence For ten years flie had known no folace that was diftonnefted from my idea, no care but of our own happinefs and that of our offspring Benevolent ihe was almoft beyond human example, and uittiefted for the welfare of all ihe knew, but thefe weie brief and muta¬ ble

had fighid deeply two or three times While I was collefting this account in my own apartment, the gates ofthe hotel opened, and a number of horfe men entered the court yard, I was fomewhat furprifed, becaufe, though I was accuftomed to fee much com pany, few of my acquaintance vifited me at fo late an hour, except on the evenings appropriated to receive them I crofted the faloon to enquire One of the fervants exclaimed, It is Ber¬ nardin'» voice, it muft be my miftrefs that is come I Nothing could be further from my mind than the thought of her arrival I flew through tbe paffage , I was on the fpot, the moment that the ferv¬ ant prepared to conduft his miftrefs from the litter, I received Marguerite in my arms, and led her into the houfe If I had expefted her arrival, I fliould infallibly have met her at this moment with

changes the dungeon's gloom for the luftre of the morning, and who fills a ccleftial exhilaration of heart, the very memory of which had been mfenfibly wearing away from his treichcrous brain All my fenfes partook of the rapture Marguerite feemed to flıed amhrofial odouis round her, her touch wis thrilling, her lips were neftar, her figure wis thit of a defcended deity · lier pleafure was not lefs than mine It is indeed abfurd, it may be termed profanation, to talk ot folitiry plea fure No fenfation ordinauly diilni guifhed by that epithet, can endure the teft of a moment's infpeftion, when compared with a focial enjoy ment It is then only that a man is truly pleafed, when pulfe replies to pulfe, vvhen tht eyes difcourfe eloquently to each other, when in refponfive tones and words the foul is communicated Altogether, we are confcious of a fober, a chifle and

The tranquillity I feemed to have at¬ tained, was an unnatural ftate of my foul, to which it was neceffary that I ihould refolutely hold myfelf down, and from which my thoughts appeared ever upon the alert to efeape Bitter experience had at length taught me a hard leffon, and that leffon I was de- Vol. I.

Thus cırcumftanced, our tour had its charms for us all, and there are ftiv paffages of my hfe that I have felt more agreeably The lake itfelf is un¬ commonly beautiful, and its environs are fertile and ıntereftıng It is fur¬ rounded with an abundance of towns, villages, country feats and monafttrics, fufficient to adorn and dnerfify tlie view, but not to exclude the fweet nefs of a rural fcencry, or the grind features of nature AVe coafted a con iiderable part ot the lake, that we might judge in fome degree, previouily to our landing, which part of the ihore promifed beft to yield us the objeft we fought The autumn was now com¬ mencing , the air was liquid and fweet, the foliage was rich and ν aried , and the vine covered hills exhibited а warmth and luxuriance of colouring, that no other objeft of nature or art is able to cope with Surrounded wilh N S thefe

No , I flill clung to this final hope, and was refolved to undertake any thing, how¬ ever defperate, rather than part with it Such were my feelings, and, in the new letter »л Inch I now difpatched, I poured out all the anguiih of my foul \ reply to this letter was at length vouchfafed Ί he heir of my proteftor informed me, that he knew nothing of the bufinefs to which I alluded , that he had come into poffeffion of the lands I defcribed, together with the other property of his late uncle, and legarded himfelf as holding them by the fame tenui e , that he found m the accounts of the efiate a fum of money advanced to me, which he might with the dufted juftice regard as a debt, and purfue me for it accordingly He ihould be liberal enough however fo far to gi\ e credit to my dory, and to con¬ fider
fider the fum in queftion as advanced upon a pledge of hnd in that cafe, I might regard m)felf as fufficiently for¬ tunate, m having obtained even thit amount at a time when, but for the hu- minity or weaknefs of his uncle, my eftate would not have fold for a farthing Meanwhile the forbearance vvhich he pioffcied, would, he obferved, depend upon my conduft, and be retrafted, if I afforded him caufe for refentment He added, that he defpifed mj menaces and commands, and that, If I took a fingle ftep againft him, I (hould find it ter¬ minate m my utter rum Nothing could be more profligate than the ftyle of his letter But its impotence was equal to its wickednefs It was abfurd to threaten to inflift ruin, on a man whom rum hnd already oveitaken Before the letter anived, I had diiburfed the whole fum I bţought with me from Switzerland This
This entire annihilation of my re¬ fources feemed to ileal en me unper- ceived Tinding that all reply to my importunity was either refufed, or de¬ terred to an uncertain period, I would willingly at all niks have fought the villam who thus obdurately devoted me and my family to deftruftion, and have endeavoured to obtain juftice in perfon But it was now too late. Before I felt the cafe thus defperate, my finances were fo far reduced, as to make it impracticable for me to leave my wife and children enough to fup¬ port them in my abfence, even if I had determined myfelf to fet out upon this perilous expedition pennylefs I re¬ folved Üiat, if we did penili, we w ould penili together Penury was now advancing upon us with fuch rapid ftndes, tint the loweft and mod fcanty refource t no longer admitted of negleft Had a eafe thus defperate
defperate been encountered with time¬ ly attention, it is not improbable that fome of the various talents I had ac¬ quired in the courfe of my education, would have furniflied me with a means of fubfiftence, not altogether plebeian or incompetent. But, with the un¬ certainty of my fituation, and totally unaccuftomed as I was to regard my perfon cr mind as a machine fitted for productive labour, I had not looked to this queftion, till the urgency of the cafe deprived me of every advantage I might otherwife have feized. I was glad therefore to have recourfe to me¬ nial occupation, and fought employ¬ ment under the gardener of the epif- copal palace, for whofe fervice I was fufficiently qualified by my ten years' retreat in the Bordelois.. That I might better adapt myfelf to the painful ne¬ ceflity of my fituation, I previouily exchanged fome of my own clothes for garments
garments more fuitable to the bufinefs I now foliated It was not till I had arrived w itilin a very few days to the end of my refource«, that even this expedient, by a fort of accident, re¬ curred to my mind Marguerite, though fully aw are of the urgency of the cafe, had, as file afterwards told me, impofed on herfelf a compulfory filence, fearing for the inflamed and irritated frame of my mmd, and aware that the couife of events would ulti¬ mately lead me to ι point, with which the dreaded to intermeddle This was for her a trying moment, my lately recovered infanity obliging her to con¬ template in" filence our growing dif¬ trefs, and to wait the attack of hunger and want that threatened to deftroy us, with an apparent tranquillity and chearfulnefs For me, fo entire a revolution had taken place in my fentiments, that I fpurned
fpurned with contempt, fo far as related to myfelf, that pride of rank and ro¬ mantic gallantry of honour, which had formerly been my idols. I fubm'tted with a fort of gloomy contentment to the fituation upon which my dediny drove me. I regarded it as the natural refult of my former mifconduft ; and derived a fentiment of eafe and relief, from thus expiating, as it were with the fweat of my brow, the temptations to which I had yielded. Had I been myfelf only reduced thus low, or had the .produce of my labour been fuffici¬ ent to purchafe competence for my wife and the means of indruftion for my family, I can fafely affiim that I (hould have found no confequenee fo direft from my own degradation, as the means of filencing the reproaches of confcience and reconciling me to myfelf. But, when I returned in the evening with the earnings of my day's labour, Д
labour, and found it incompetent to the procuring for thofe who depended on me the fimpleft means of fubfid- ence, then indeed my fenfations were dıfleıent My heart died within me I did not return aftei the fatigues of the dav, vvhich, to me who hid not been accuftomed to unremitted labour, and who now began to feel that I was not fo young as I hid been at the fiege of Pıvıa, were extiemely trying—I did not ıeturn, I fay to a night of reoofc I becime a very woman when I looked forward, md endeavoured to pifture to myfelf the futu e fituation of my family I vviteied my pillow with my tears Often whtn I ima gined tha my whole fimtly were ifleep, I „ive vent to my perturbed md dif trafted mmd m groins Marguerite would fometimes overhear me, and, with the gentleft fuggeftions of her admirable mind, would endeavoui to foothe
foothe my thoughts to peace. For the prefent, as I have faid, my earnings were incompetent, and we found it neceffary to fupply the deficiency by the fale of the few garments, not in immediate ufe, that wc ftill poffeffed.

as the brilliant and confolatory prof¬ pefts of life feemed for ever clofed upon me, I at firft regirded my ip proaching diffolution with complacen су, and longed to be releafed from a fenes of woes, in which I had been originally involved by my own folly This frame of mind however was of no great duration, the more nearly I contemplated the idea of feparation from thofe I loved, the fmaller was my refignation I was unwilling to quit thofe dear objefts by which I ftill held to this mortal fcene, I (brunk tvith averfion from that barrier which feparates us from all that is new, myf tenous and drange Another tram of ideas fucceeded this, and I began to defpife myfelf for my impatience and cowardice It was by my vices that my family was involved m a long train of misfortunes, could 1 (hnnk from partaking what I had not feared to create ?

as I recovered, feemed to feel more and more vindij how enviable it was to be the head of a loving and harmo¬ nious family. My recovery however was exceed¬ ingly flow, and it was feveral weeks before I had fo fir recruited my ftrength as to be capable of my ordinary occu¬ pations In the mean time the pecu¬ niary difficulties to which we were expofed, hourly incieafed, and the chearful, but lnfigiuficant labours of Charles, cculd contribute little to the fupport of a family The melancholy nature of our fituation might perhaps have been expefted to pievent the re¬ ftontion of my health At firft how¬ ever it had not that effeft The de¬ bilitated ftate of my animal func¬ tions led me, by a fort of irrefiftible mftmft, to rejeft ideas and reflec¬ tions which I (hould then have been unable to endure I faw the anxiety and affeftion

Before you require me* to Beat the calamities that have overtaken us, let me underftand what thefe cala¬ mities arfe. While We waited for intel¬ ligence from Switzerland, we expended the whole fum that we brought with us, and I was obliged to* hire myfelf tb the' epifcopal gardener for bread ; Was it not fo ? Indeed, Reginald, you are to blame ! Pray, queftion me no further ! Tnis was our condition fome time ago; and now, fora mOrftbpaft, I have 'been

We had flill fome things, you know, that we could contrive to do without, and thofe I have fold. Charles too, our excellent-hearted fon, has lately hired himfelf to the gardener, and has every night brought! us·home a little, though it was but little. Dear boy ! What children, what a wife, have I brought to deftruftion ! Our rent too, furely you have not been able to pay that ? Not entirely. In part I have been obliged to pay it.

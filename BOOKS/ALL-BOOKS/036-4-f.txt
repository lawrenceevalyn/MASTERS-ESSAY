THE LIBERTINE.
CHAPTER XXV The nature of Angelo w as such that his first sensations were ever the most v ïolent The paroxysms of despair ceasing, he shed ton cuts of tears over the breathless form of Gabrielle be w as no longer fi antic, a deep woe oppressed and rendered him incapable of woildly cares, he shuthnn- self ur· m her chamber and w ould suffer no one to ai aw hun thence For hours would he gazeou that pale countenance, calm, beautiful and expressive, even in death, Sometimes ınvoluntaııly would vol iv в
he persuade himself she breathed and touch her cold hand, which bieaking instantly the delusion,be wouldsttrt back with a shudder, and burst into tears Now sitting besideher,exhausted, woi u out with incessant grief, hewould recline back and pursue a tram of melancholy reflection, till he lost himself, then sud¬ denly springing up in alarm, imagine she railed him, as often durmghcr illness she had been wont and, looking within the curtains, behold only the harrowing image of immoveable death " Ah, my God' ' would hétben exclaim, m a voice ot anguish, ' and can it indeed be that my beloved is no more? Hiebest, the loveliest, themostang lie of women Oh'wretch «ud fool that I must huve been to have so little understood her worth, to h-ivc neglected, outraged and forsaken her as I did."—Then, stungby remorse, the force
of imagination would cause him td utteT, "Ahjhercountenanceassumesastetnlook! sho accuses me. Is it not so ? do I d'reain f Oh ! no, n«, she accuses me not ; sweet seraphic, uncomplaining as when Irving' is tliat beauteous face ; sure she even' smiles uponmc !" Now gazing dnher fea¬ tures from various points of view, reason would resume her empire. He saw nei- thet reproach, nor smile, but the freezing; fixedness of death alone, participating uo longer in mortal agitations. " Yet,óh! yet," would he cry, " did I not break her heart ? did not her last breath tell me so ?—Horror!—no, she said not me ; her heart, she said, was broken ; but did not say by me —no, no ; yet, who then ? Madness ' madness, endless remorse must be mine ! yes, it was I who destroyed her, Withered like the lightning'sblasther fair blooming prospects, I blighted her inno¬ cent youth, I made a wretch of her I в 'Ì
should have worshipped,—who for me sacrificed all —yet she never reproached me;—no—and in retuin, I persevered—I broke her heart !" Then falling on his knees by her silent corpsc.he would fling his arms around it, hiding his face upon the covering which overspread liei. /Λ length it became necessary to гоиве the w retched Angelo from the profound indulgence ofa grief unmixed with other thoughts, by harrowing intimations re¬ specting the funeral of her he mourned. At first, on this dreadful subject he could 00,1; listen, and such was the effect it produced on hire, it w as thought impru¬ dent at that juncture to pursue it, but it И (is lequisitc that it should be again rpjriţcd, and, in anguish of heart inex- niessible, was he compelled to give such directions as he could, that the body pf Gabrielle should be copvej'ed to
Loudon, there to bc interred in the fa¬ mily vault, and laid by the side of Ins mother. Sad and mournful is the office to fhe survivor, with his heart still bleeding at the fond and vivid retroipection of hours past ia the society of one beloved, in the animationof life and health—sad and mournful for him is the office to super¬ intend and direct the last cold functions for those who are never to return, toper- form with shuddering soul those melan¬ choly obsequies to their manes whvh uiage requires, and to know that it i indeed the last tribute he can pay to the memory of one, for vn hom his heart vainly pants todomore—oh,how murhmorc'— but who, cold indifferent, sad, is uncon¬ scious eveu of that. From that spot where, vitbout a hope вЗ
for herself, but in patient acquiescence to the desires of others, the gentle Gabrielle had gone for the renewal of health, was she removed a corpse, conveyed again to that which she had quitted, and interred with funeral pomp in the same vault where long had peacefully slept the pa¬ rents of Angelo, and, novr received a daughter to their bosoms, who honoured them even in death. Her funeral was at¬ tended by all those friends of Angelo, but few in number indeed, who had had an opportunity of knowing her—by these was she consequently lamented, as she had been admired ; for it was not in na¬ ture toknow Gabrielle, and bc insensible to her singular perfections Thus, tliough it could not he said that a weeping mul¬ titude followed her to the grave, the few who did, shed over it Hie tear of heart¬ felt sorrow, the fear which mosi lier ho¬ vering spiritprized.
Augelo, forlorn despairing heartsick considering himself a bankrupt in every happiness that life could now afford, re¬ fused, when the cold remains of her he had at length truly loved and appreciat¬ ed f u as his nature was capable, were laid m the euth, refused foi many dajs to be seen of any one, and whtn at length the intrusive ofSciousno«s of friendship Xso termed, but which is ш ïeality only the impatience oi the vain and weak at sorrows, whith, incapable ol alleviating, they consider it а tax to behold) compel¬ led lum fiom his cheushtd solitude, he appeau d for а short time again among them, but with а mcl incholy aud reluc¬ tance that soon rendeied lus society un sought by the many aud unpriced even bj Ihc ftw, for lhe woild can grieve only fo personal nnsfortunt and fly from miseries not their ow u u 4
Solitiidi for atime was the only halm wluell the heart of Augelo did not reject, there he could bring befoie him the fair image of Gabrielle when first in the bloom of youth uul innocence he had hrlield hci, ue\t as n Italy, when in the habit of α joirli she hid hoveled near hun uuknown,his guaidian angel —Now forsaken, dying, he beheld her а desolate wanderer, perishing in the streets of ano¬ ther land, then raising for a while her languid headjbutdroopıngıtsoon, never more to revive, now her wasted form glid¬ ed before him, with accusing air, ana now stretched on the bed of death no more to anse, he beheld the meek devoted victim of his perfidy and crime. Ihus the remorseful Angelo passed his hours, till, as his grief became less powerful, his mind of itself looked eut for consolation he yet sought it not in society, he sought it notili a renew-
al of his former habits, he sought it not in gaiety or amusement, and when again he opened his lattice on the world, the remembrance of past scenes rushed so forcibly on his mind, that he fled it m a paroxysm of renewed griet The house whereGahnelle had resided, it distracted him to enter, the country where she (lied, had inspiied lum with un¬ ceasing horror, thestreetsthroughwhuh her sad remains had passed, wore the air of depopulation, Me felt an oppressive gloom over his soul, if by chance he ap¬ proached them, without her who was departed, all England appeared in his eyes but a frightful wilderness, or thesad mausoleum of her whom it etitombed Unable to rest, he determined on quit¬ ting it al together, and,the last injunctions of Gabrielle being ever present to hit mmd, to bend his course towards Italy, in the faint hope that chance perl ipi в 5
might furnish hım with some tidings of the fate of one, if not both his chil¬ dren, or, at all events, in his present absolute uncertainty, it was a spot as justly calculated as any other to au¬ thorise such a hope, and might claim the preference of being first explored In pursuance of this idea, and deriving a melancholy pleasure from the reflection that he waa now on the pomt of obeying the dearest wishes of his departed wife, and of performing to her sacred memory the promise hc had made, he hastily ar¬ ranged every requisite previous to hıı departure, and taking leave of Fitzarden, and a few oniy whom he esteemed his friends, he embarked for Calais, having so far varied the commencement of his route as to resolve on passing through Paris, previous to visiting Italy ; con¬ ceiving that by so doing, instead of
crossing a barren space of the Mediter¬ ranean, he multiplied his chances of in¬ formation upon a subject now the nearest to his heart. He soon arrived at this hot-bed of fri¬ volity, vice, and unmeaning profligacy, where, as ite had-been before,,and made ahost of acquaintances, he was presently surrounded, and forcibly dragged into a Tortex of dissipation. At first, as here¬ tofore, every thing in the shape of mirth er gaiety was hateful to him, bat by degrees his mind yielded tö the attrac¬ tion, and he further reconciled himself to something like participation in the universal rage for idle amusement, in a country where folly and fashion give the law, in the reflection that by so doing could he alone hope for the remotest in¬ telligence respecting those he sought. Thus he roamed from theatre to theatre,
from one party to another, from town to country, in the environs among the gar¬ dens , yet of those who were ever upper¬ most m his thoughts he decerned not the smallest trace and began to resolve on speedily quitting a place which since it had ceased to inspire lum with hope, inspired bini only with disgust It happened that a gay young noble¬ man, named St Evremond, one with whom he had formerly been in the habits of associating called on him one morn¬ ing (while solitary iu his ehambei he was luminating whether ftom Pans he should go as he first intended to Italy, 01 otheiwise to Switzt iland, in the vam hope that Madame Beitrand might be enabled to give him some intelligence re¬ specting Ins lost daughter), and per¬ ceiving his extreme dejection, proposed to him au engagement foi the evening to
accompany him to a fair Englishwoman, whom he had lately formed acquaint¬ ance with, and whom Angelo, as he considered him more than half an Eng¬ lishman, might probably be pleased to converse with. Having lost the best and loveliest of her sex, Angelo had not at this juncture a thought to throw away on woman ; but the name Englishwoman caused in him au involuntary emotion, for it was ia England that Gabrielle had become his bride, and in England where now her cold remains were laid ; he could not avoid asking ofthe Marquisde St. Evre¬ mond, what he knew concerning the fe¬ male, andhowlong shehad been in Paris. " She has been among us some time," St. Evremond replied, " but I have not known ber long. I was introduced to her
»y ds VninviUe, my ftiend and yours; alt I know of her, is, that she supports a splendid appearance, and is visited by most of our sçavoir vivre, both old and young, and by many of our ladies, whose rank and situations are such as to give them a license for doing what they please, and who o«n venture to set forma) rules at defiance. All are pleased with the society she contrivesto draw to her home, and with the choice entertainment,mirth, and gaiety, that are always to bc met with theie ; yet I believe I may confi¬ dently assert, that no one knows, any »ore than myself, from whence she de¬ rives her sources, or even cares more than I do ; pleasure being the object of life, what matter how it is obtained ? " " True," thought Angelo to himself, " Frenchmen do not care," forgetting at the moment that the observation was not
applicable to Frenchmen only, аш} not long sisee had been most decidedly so tp himself. " Well," cried he aloud, " I will attend you then, for I have a curi¬ osity to see this fair one."—" Ah ! fort bien, au révoir," cried the gay Marquis running out of the room, " I bave a thousand important things to perform, and above all must hasten to the rehear¬ sal at the opera, for I am every thing there ; so adieu." The evening found Angelo prepared for his destined visit ; the Marquis was true to his appointment, and they de¬ parted together. They soon arrived at the elegant residence of this vaunted fair one, and were ushered into an apart¬ ment richly furnished, gaily illuminated, highly perfumed, and filled with a mul¬ titude of those gaudy butterflies, who wander about in search of pleasure, in-
diffcrcnt,asSt. Evremond had aptly said, where or how it might be obtained. " Theťe," cried he to Angelo asheen- tered," theie is the goddess of this terres¬ trial heaven : do you not observe how she is surrounded, absolutely encompassed by acrowd,yettowérá above them all; db but regard, Count—a majestic height 1 " Angelo looked forward, and bebeld the tall 6gure ofa woman fancifully but not tastefully attired, and who, whatever might be the attrai tions of her form, could rank neither delicacy, nor ele¬ gance among them Her face was not towards them, and St. Evremond promi¬ sed his companion that he would pre*- sently make his way and introduce him. But now the female turned, and was mov¬ ing towards them ; St. Evremond called the attention of An^ lo , he had already caught a glimpse of a countenance not
unfamiliar to hım, and Was tuinmg faint She drew neai er , Angelo looked with all his powers of vision Bedaubed with rouge, covered with frippery, bloated and dlsflgtiled, but not completely dis¬ guised, he beheld before him—the gorgon head of Milborough ' and, stag¬ gering with horror, would have fallen to the ground, but that the Marquu caught his arm, and prevented him. The abandoned Milborough had be¬ held him too, and as immediately recog¬ nized him , for the moment she was petrified with alarm, but promptly re¬ covering herself, with her native effron¬ tery and cunning, she drew near, seeming wholly unconcerned " Count D Albini ' exclaimed the Msrquis, · you are not ill I hope—
Allow me to introduce you to our love ly hostess." " Your friend seems overcome, Mar¬ quis," cried Milborough with an as¬ sumed accent, half French half' Eng¬ lish, and determined to affect total ig- noiaooe of Angelo, " Had you not bet- iet múke mth faim· ; a $ew momeóte into ihe next «hamber > —thserje you will find refreshments and—" At this daring insolence, rage took place of «very other sensation in the bosom of Angelo. "Wretch !" he ex¬ claimed, seizing her by th» arm, indif¬ ferent to all around— " dare you af¬ fect not to know ine ¡" " Good Heaven, Marquis," exclaim¬ ed Milborough, disengaging herself from the wild grasp of Angelo. " for
what do you bring a madman to my house ? ' The Marquis slightly bowed, glan¬ ced towards Angelo, and shrugged his shoulders Witb an embarrassed air. " Woman '"resumed the half frantic Angelo, " beware how you tempt me tqo far I command you, instantly in¬ form me, »bat have you done With my son ? " The bronzed cheek of Milborough knew no blush, her unabashed eye wandered round as seemiug to ask in¬ dignant participation in the countc- n mees of those present, for the in suit oflered her , she readonly cunosi¬ ty, lndiflcrcncc 01 а desire to remain neuter , and fearful (lien, let Angelo, as well she knew he coultl, «noukl un
mask her before those with whom she de¬ sired to remain unsuspected, she as¬ sumed an air of anger, blended how¬ ever with some confusion, and turn¬ ing towards him demanded—" Pray, Count, for so I think the Marquis styled you, what do you require of mer" " My son, wretch !" returned An¬ gelo, " and unless you would bt in« stantly exposed for what you are, give me immediate information of him." " Well," cried Milborough,glancing round with a smile of affected indif¬ ference, but which however was not reflected back hy any of her guests; " well, Count, if you bave really any thing of importance to say to me, as you appear so desirous; I will attend
you in another apartment—though really I think such conduct somewhat strange." Then waving her hand to invite Angelo forward, who indignant¬ ly followed her from the crowded apartment, she led the way to a small antichamber at a distance ftom the company. Angelo, instantly shutting the door with violence, in a voice quivering with rage repeated the question of '' Where is my son ? " " How should I know'"returned Milborough ; " do you think I hold lum still in leading strings ?" " Who but you, wretch, can know- aught respecting him ? Was it not you who stole him from beneath my roof,
when you basely robbed me beside of all I possessed?" "Bitter language, my Lord; IwouM advise you to be more sparing of it — Your son left your house with me inr deed, but by his own consent, nay by his wish.—As for the robbery jou speak of, if such it pleases you to call it, he had his share in that too ;—but supposinğ'he had' not, what then ? —I thuTTght you' knew the world better than to suppose a woman of discre¬ tion could think of remaining with you after you were ruined ; or when she quitted you, she would like a fool leave—." " Cease your diabolical jargon, shock not ihy ears with the promul¬ gation of your infamous principles ; be
their baseness your curse ; the crimes they lead you to, your punishment , ï ask you of my son , tell me his pre¬ sent destination—let all elee rest ' " That is more than I can undertake to do," returned Milborough , " the destination of your son is unknown to me, end has been for some time." *' Abominable woman ' this prevari¬ cation shall not avail you if you do not instantly say where you have secreted the youth, I will publicly expose jou, and bring you to punishment " Milborough burst into a loud laugh " Why,what would you gam by that? ' txclaimed she, "no one here would btheve you, and if thej did, still what would you gain ? Besides, how can you diretth piove any thing against mc'
But make the attempt if you will, for the jest's sake,—do, and perhaps you will easily get over the small trifle of my proving fhat your son was not merely an accomplice with me, but my chief agent in all I did." " Monster ! dare you speak of a boy ! a child trepanned by your base arts, as an accomplice ? That shall avail you nought, nor shall any thing, but a. prompt and sincere acknowledgment respecting him." "Though Idespiseyour thrcats,Count, from being aware of their absurdity, in compassion to your seeming anxiety, I will condescend thus far to inform you. The boy left England with me, I grant ; he hated his mother, you know." (Angelo's heart swelled with rage and anguish, but his desire to hear this fe-
male demonto an end kept him silent " Hc came with me to this place, andre- mained with me, even for some time, but being a spirited youth, and much like his father in point of chs acter, that is, fond of novelty, he soon deserted from my banners to those of a French Mar¬ chioness, whom, I presume, he preferred to me, because she paid him more com¬ pliments, and, as he conceived, would be moie indulgent to lum than myself, whom he considered, and ever had in¬ deed, more as mother than his natural parent " She paused, but finding Angelo re¬ mained silent, she resumed " I wm ld spare you a recital of the rest as you ap¬ pear agitated , but a w aiting maid be¬ longing to this said Marchioness, who had paid vour sou great attention, sud¬ denly disappe redwithallthejewelsand vol iv с

PunsüiNe his original intention, he di¬ rected his course to Italy nor till hc breathed the pure air of his father < native countrj did hebegni to revive from the dreadful effects of the blow hr had received, or feci lighter of llie weight of woe that had opprc 0 cd lum Arrived at Naples again lie was at home, escaped as it weie fiom the lang« of demons who toimtnfcd lmn, to be received w ith joj, among friends who loved him His mourning habit hit melancholy an, his evident wretched ness, drew towards Inni the w uni lioails t j
of his Italian fuends, and each sought who should most relieve him from him¬ self, and fiom the contemplation of mis¬ foitunes now irremediable By degrees the unhappiness of An¬ gelo diminished, though a corrodir g an¬ xiety to discover his children still re¬ mained, and actuated bim to use every effort, all however proved unhappily fruitless, every inquiry vain, to a dispiriting degree , and in despair he began to believe that the curse of Heaven w as visited upon hmi and that his offspring unnoticed mil inula med, were doomed in sail dishonour to wander through the eaith At length, after remaining a tonsidcrable tune at Na¬ ples, the pr<i]cct of seeking Madame Beitrand in Switzerland igam occurred to him but when he prcpaied to put his plinin execution, his courage failed,
and the thought that he was about to revisit the soeues where first m the bloom of j outh and innocence, in placid con- lent and peace he had beheld the love¬ ly ill-fated Gabrielle , where too he had fiist blighted the hopes of that jouth, destroyed that innocence, mar¬ red for ever its blissful content, and bc- i orne a villain, though not a deliberate one perhaps, beneath the roof of trust¬ ing hospitality,—the deep conscious¬ ness of the wrongs he had commit¬ ted, was too strong for the heart of Angelo, and his mind was too w cak to indure the içti ospection of them amid scenes aud in shapes so harrowing He had not fortitude to inflict upon himself the lenovated pangs of con¬ science, nor to bow beneath those pangs as just or hail them as cApia tory , to feel tl at he was a wretch was alreadj too much , to have it eonfirnud
to hım m a thousand different damn¬ ing w aj s, would have driven htm to ab¬ solute distraction, or at once have anni¬ hilated bim His friends (some of whom were suf¬ ficiently interested m hım to endeavour to read his mmd and consequently discovered its anguished workings) dis¬ suaded him from the idea altogether, and proposed instead that he should address Madame Bertrand by letter on thesub]ett nearest his heart, and which would answer every purpose to be gani- id equally with a visit To this alter¬ native Angelo appealing convinced of its eligibilii ι yielded with seeiet joy, liappj to have an excuse for sparing himself those temblé pangs, which, on anticipation only had ilready sinken hım lo the very centre In Nıplcı beside he was as much at ease
as tine nature of circumstances and tbe occasional intrusion of sad remem- branceswould permit, every one studied to cheer and amuse him, and none more than those who, having known Gabrielle, appreciated ш a degree the greatness of his loss, and sympathized in hie grief in short, there was no¬ thing which could render his ι esidence in this country otherwise than plea¬ sing The wretched Oriana, whose conti¬ nuance m it would have been to him not only a source of extreme uneasi¬ ness, but a perpetual reproach, no lon¬ ger existed on the face of the earth , she had pa d the debt of her vices and profligacy in a premature death Having met with a lover who proved a second Fiorenza, but to whom she was determined not equally to submit,
the contest, carried on with obstinacy by her, was repaid with violence and equal obstinacy from him, till wearied by her stubborn perseverance, and im¬ patient at her presumptıoHi he one day, during n furious quanel, plunged hu stiletto in hei breast she languished for a time under the wound, and then expired in agony, while the dastard who had inflicted the blow hastily secured the whole of what she posses¬ sed, and fled Such had been the fate of Oriana, who had ended her career of infamy by a miserable death, and whose dissolute life had merited no better catastrophe A letter was dispatched to Madame Berli itnil, or rathei Bofiuet, and Angelo awaited her reply in anxious impatience, it aimed, but contained nothing, alas ' to renovate his hopes In it be had only
the painful and discouraging repetition of having never yet heard the least tid¬ ings of her beloved Agnes, since the hour of her departure , bitter lamenta- tions.that opened afresh his own wounds, for the death of her adored Gabrielle, (which event he had m his letter made known to her ) , horrible apprehensions, vividly pourtrayed, which conjur¬ ed too before the mmd of Angelo, the most appalling images of what might be the probable fate of her dear lost child, and then, with that pardonable egotism ao natural to human nature, did sherevert to her own unfortunate situation, the folly she had been guilty of m marrying, at ber years, a brutal, selfish and pas¬ sionate wretch like Boffuet, and the mented punishment of harsh and cruel treatment which she had in consequence Experienced.
Angelo could read nothing with indif¬ ference that fell from the pen of her who had been the dearest friend of Gabrielle, and tender protectress of his child ; he therefore after aheddmg bitter tears over what more immediately regarded those so dear to him, paid the tribute of a few to the unhappinees of an excellent wo¬ man, in whose unmerited misfortunes he could not but sincerely sympathise. Some short time further having now elapsed, notwithstanding hie agreeable- situation in Italy, and that no other coun¬ try could have for him equal charms, An¬ gelo determined to quit this terrestrial paradise, and to return to England,where if after every possible means through the most public channels should have been resorted to, to develope some trace, or obtain some intelligence of his chil-
doen, he could still obtain not the remo¬ test linformatiou of either, he resolved to traverse all Europe in search of them, and even to penetrate into other quar¬ ters of the globe, if the shadow of a probability oflered that researches so distant might not prove ineffectual. So long as he was inactive,he considered tihathe was not cfbeyiug the injunctions of ithe sainted Gabrielle, and in the midst of ihose little festivities with which bis friends 'sometimes contrived to enter¬ tain him, suddenly he would start up, аш} rush from the gay scene, as consi¬ dering that he was not pursuing her last desires, and secretly accuse himself of a sacrilegious negligence. Such wag the high influence and triumph, though late obtamed, of virtue and excellence, over the wandering and unsteady mind of a libertine.
It was in vain for those who prized the society of Angelo, and desired Ito retain him among them, to represent to him the wildness of his proposed plan, or seek to impress upon his mind, that the ideas of Gabrielle in entreating him to think of his children, and endea¬ vour to trace them, never extended to the kngfhthat he imagined; he persevered in his determination, alledging that he should not religiously fulfil her dying request, 1 or his promise to her, if whilehe hadlife, he desisted from the unremitting search. He fixed then a period for his departure, and while the time rapidly approached, his friends, anxious at least to procrastinate it, imagined an endless variety of entertainment, calculated to have dissipated lesser cares, and have shaken resolutions less firm. One evening walking solitary among
some of the beautiful environs of Naples, he beheld it aslight distance before lum a young female, who though veiled from head to foot, betrayed a figure oí such exquisite symmetiy that involuntarily he was attracted towaids her Angelo was no longer young and tumultuous pas¬ ston foi Uil fair lud long ceased to agi¬ tate his heart, yet still was he not insen¬ sible to their attı actions, and was an enthusiastic admirer of beauty, without being a lover Desirous if possible to behold the fair countenance which he conceived must appertain to a form so divine, he quick? ened bis pace, and had nearly reached the object of an idle curiosity, when by accident she stumbled and fell Angelo, no longer entertaining an idea but that of rendering assistance, flew to raise her from the giound, aud with tlic most de-
licate attention offered his services, the veil of the fair incognita had fallen aside, and discovered acountcnance which exceeded if possible the expectations which her figure had raised Without being absolutely what is termed beau¬ tiful, there was in it an expression which surpassed beauty's self, and conveyed to the mmd an idea of loveliness, such as ate mostienthusiastic imagery could never have iconceived Augelo gazed with an admiration that almost deprived him of the ease and self possession acquired by long intercourse with polished society; while the young female modestly, thank¬ ing him for the assistance he had ren¬ dered her turned in another direction from that in which she had been w alk¬ uig, for the perpose of returning home This movement recovered Angelo, and with that giacefulness of manner peca-
liarly hn own, which no time could di¬ mmish, he offered her his arm, entreat¬ ing that she would deign to lean upon it, till she had in some degree recovered the agitation occasioned by her acci¬ dent " Indeed, Signor," answered she with an enchanting ai veté, and deeply blush¬ ing, " if it would not materially incon¬ venience you, I would accept your kind offer, as in truth I feel so much hurt as to be scarcely capable of walking " The heart of Angelo felt an emotion of pleasure , he presented his arm for her acceptanca with an air of respectful interest, and requested that she would support herself wholly upon it A fe¬ male needed his assistance—this was enough for the highly bred and polish¬ ed Angelo to keep a watchful guard oicr
Ins language, and not to embarrass or op¬ press, evenbj his admiration, one who had honoured him so far as to believe she ran no risk by accepting his protection The fair female consequently found hci selfat ease Theappcarance of Angelo, though strictly elegant, was no longer that of a young man , this circumstance contributed likewise to increase her con¬ fidence he spoke little, but that little with delicacy andreserve, seeming scarce¬ ly to exact a leturn, he confined himself to geneial observations or adveited to such topics as the most lovely and inno cent female might have participated in without a blush At length, at the entiance of a small which had nothing m its extei ior commend it, but a modest simple clt c ance, the fair stranger stopped " This," said she, with an air slightly
emban assed, " ıs my residence. Sig¬ nor ' Angelo bowed, and perceiving her confusion, relieved her inst mtly by say¬ ing, " I will not ask permission to in¬ trude at present, Signora , but if I might to-morrow bc »uffeied to inquire if you have sustained any ill effects from your accident—" " I—I hvecntirely alone, Signor, and— and' —she stopped and deeply blushed Angelo knew women well, by thjs time he had acquired experience, and was well versed m their various artı fices A new lightbroke upon his mind, hc gazed upon the fair creature before him with altered eyes, she appeared in¬ nocent, but it must be delusion he be¬ held in hei no longer а virtuous female,
hut the gay Cleopatra of some Italian noble,rctained according to their custom in a favourite and ïetired villa, as the soft companion of their lighter hr-urs Immediately at this conception, Whether justor unjust, and which had its source in the prejudice of Angelo againstthe sex, from his knowledge ( with a single exception only) of the worscr part, his real respect vanished , the discovery which he considered he had made, ar¬ rested on his lips theavowal of his na~ne, which had hovered on them, and deter¬ mined him not to commi* himself to the fiantic jealousy of an enraged lover, thiough the weakness of a frail female But though his respect had vanished, his politeness, deceptive semblance ' re¬ mained, and while he eould scarcely avoid lamenting that such peculiar beauty should want the intrinsic orna¬ ment of innocence, his admiration did not
subside, and he felt an unconquerable désire once more to behold, and learn further of the lovely stranger. With a gay air therefore, but devoid of levity, he observed, " I trust, Signora, that your being alone forms no obstacle to the favour I have solicited." " Gratitude commands that I should see you again, indeed. Signor; but I know not if It is warranted by a strict propriety." Angelo deeming this a flight of af¬ fectation merely, smiled archly as he answered : " The idea is every thing, Signora; the feeling which would prompt yoU'to admit mc is avirtue; how then, 1 in yieldiag to it, can you be guilty of an impropriety?" vol. iv. n
" Farewell, for the present, Signor, " Æried the j oung fem.vle.graccfully waving lier hand, as she entered llie house. An¬ gelo returned her courtesy with a smile. " bhe will uot «noslie wishes to see me iigain," said hc mentally, " butit is suf¬ ficiently «vident without." Impressed with this idea, and others netnorc favour¬ able to the fair incognita, hc slowly re¬ traced Jus way home. The next morning he failed not to be punctual to his jţelf-invited appointment; lie ¡beheld her walking in the garden be¬ fore her house, and was not displeased to remark that she received him with an air of pleasure ; she invited him into the house with that mixture of frankness and politeness that, while it placed him en¬ tirely at ease, repressed at the same time improper familiarity. Thus, though sur- rounding circumstances encouraged sus·-
picion, her own manners, appearance and conduct, repelled every calumnious idea The interior ofthe dwelling corre spoilded to its exterior itwas simple, tasteful, elegant, an air of ease and com¬ fort reigned throughout, and no second inhabitant was visible save -inane n nt female domestic Still vould ι mcl -sus picion intrude into the mmd of \ngeIo " Why did this lovely creature live m such profound solitude' whv il a re spectable female did she not mix in so ciety, or draw around her a select circii ofappropriatccoinpanions ' why, thb air of mj stery ? why, if her sources of livelihood were such, and her means of indulgence such as need not shinikfiom the broad eye of investigation why young, polished, elegant and cniithd to a high seat in society, still prefer Cat lenst) an equivocal retirement un- o3
noticed, and unsanctioned by the vvorld ?" That her situation was such as he had at first suspected, he still continued to believe, and still therefore was unwilling to acknowledge himself for w ho he w as ; for the present he had evaded rendering his name, by having first recognized the fair stranger in her garden, and having addressed her while there. But desirous as he was to wrap himself in conceal¬ ment, knowing how easily the jealousy of an Italian lover is excited,, he could perceive" no reason for a similar reserve on the part of the fair one, whose divulgement of her name to him must be considered a matter of no import whatever. When theiefore on the point of departing, he took her hand with an air of respect r and said, " So delighted have I been, I have not even asked the
name ofthe fair creature who has yield¬ ed 'me fhe pleasure of her conversation " " My name, Signoi, is Ida," returned the young female, slightly blushing. ï "Ida I" repeated Angelo, w ith an air that seemed to*say, '' and nothing more?" " Ida," she replied ogam to his in¬ quiring glance " Ida onlj', " tliought Angelo ; "more mystery '" "But, Signor," added Ida timidly, " I hope I am not incorrei t m asking whom I have had the lionour of con¬ versing wilh ?" Angelo was wholly unprepared fór »ä
Chis uafuial question, for with the pride incidental io man, be thought it only eight that his ow n curiosity should bc giatificd, while he did not infer the ne¬ cessity of gratifying that of others in return. But Ida, with all her unassu¬ ming naïveté, appeared to expect an an- iwer ; and Angelo, in confusion, seeing no longer the possibility of escape, me¬ chanically sought for his card, and with a. constrained bow presented it to the fair inquirer. She glanced her ej'e slightly over it, aud exclaimed, " Il Marchese di Orbino," at the same time bowing gracefully towards Angelo. Angelo was instantly sensible of the error of Ida, and of his own involuntary mistake, in having given her in hie con¬ fusion the card ofa friend, (which he had accidentalii about him, ) in lieu of
Bis· own With a start of surprit Im was about to explain when the idet suddenly struck lum, that by permitting herta remmiini htr error, lic w ι* hulden beneath an impenetrable veil, while at the same time he promised lumstlf (hit he would neither disgrace the name oflus friend, nor make an improper use of the covert which it lent lum Itwas not that Angelo shrunk from the probability ot a duel, for he wanted neither courage nor bravery, nor that lie dreaded secret as sassmation but hew ishid not it tl ι period to luve hi name involved in ι ridiculous affr iy about α \ om ui or unnecessarily to be poniti d out as 11 iv il when at present hc felt no intimation to become one 1 urfhcr he reconciled Ins mind to the puctice of the deception m the reflection that Id lobsrrvcd mvsttry towards Inm, in having given Inm onlv half her name 1)4
But thus yielding to the temptation to ait with duplicity, was under any circumstances unpardonable, and un- worfliv in Angelo, and brought with it a punishment duly proportional to the dt relu lion fiom honour and pıopııçtjı

CHAPTER XXVII.
Л day now scarcely elapsed that the fair Ida was not visited by Angelo. Un¬ consciously be had abandoned allthougbt of hastening his departure, and felt him¬ self gradually and irresistibly attracted towards this newly discovered magnet. Still, however, the fair'one was only Ida to him, still her manners were the same—frank, and graceful, and deli¬ cately modest; all around her still wore the self same air, and still impenetrable to tbe foot of other man than himself, appeared her fair abode. Inclined to suspect, jet iinabl· о ascertain; invo¬ luntarily admiring, jot afraid to trust, I) J
Angelo revolved in vain in his mind some means of deciding at once the real cha¬ racter of the mysterious recluse; he eould not deny but there shone in all her actions a beautiful simplicity—yet wasit real ? or was it not rather merely as¬ sumed? Having dined one day w ith a party of his gay associates, and enjoying in the unrestrained spirit of conviviality, his wine and ices in the fresco, it occurred to him, as he found his vivacity elevated tn a higher pvtch than it had ever been since the death of Gabrielle, that he had never yet visited his beauteous solitary at a late hour of the evening. As he pondered on this idea, and continued drinking, he determined, exhilirated as he was, that the present would furnish hini with the opportunity he had long •ought of ascertaining her character in
ifs true light: should he, as he expected, be refused admittance, hc should imme¬ diately infer that her lover was with her, and his suspicions would be at овсе con¬ firmed; but should he, on the contiary, be admitted, and find her as heretofore entirely alone, then, by a change of de¬ portment towards her, would he prove if she were really the innocent and vu¬ tuous creature she appeared to be. Thus is it with man—if a female wears tlie semblance of being virtuous, if ei en calumny's self cannot prove her other¬ wise, then do they require some proof stronger even than truth itself; but if being not equally icaJiy as virtuous, if unable to resist or circumvent various temptation and ieaseless manœuvre, at lengtli she fall, then do they despise her for her weakness, triumphantly and cruelly adducing it in confirmation
of their assertion, that " she could never have been virtuous." Flushed with wine, heated in the an¬ ticipation of expçcted victory, Angelo stole silently from his companions, and bent his steps towards the residence of Ida. Instantly hc "was admitted, and found her alone ; he approached her witb an air gayer than usual, and ,was re* ceived with tbe same artless and undis¬ guised pleasure as ever by her.—" Ha ! " thought Angejo, " she is not displeased with my visit at this unusual hour"; slie ; is perhaps the discarded mistress of some fickle Italian—lovely to a degree though, who could forsake her ?" Ha, who ' either did not observe, or was not aware of the situation of An¬ gelo, and who had ever considered the disparity of their years as sufficient
to obviate the idea of impropriety m receiving his visits, attnbuted this un¬ wonted vivacity to an overflow mere¬ ly of jwilmal spiqts, ajid thought not ofan attempt to rqpress them Tlus forheatanqe, white if. strengthened lus suspicions against her, emboldened him in [the pursuit of his mtentipns, hi,» respeotjbegan gradually in appearance to dimmish, his language became moie tender and familiar, and his looks de¬ clared to Ida tbat he entertained sen¬ timents which she had been ipcapablc of suspecting In proportion as he became less re Spectful, she grew more reserved , and when at length she found it necessary to be seriously indignant, Augelo at tributing it all to intolerable affectation, setzet} her suddenly in his iims, and »wore that she appeared if possible
more beautiful in anger than in kind¬ ness. Mortified, indignant not less at his manner than at his action, for she wish¬ ed to regard him as a tender, rationwk and respectful ftiend, rather than a lover, she broke from him, and view¬ ing him wilh eyes flashing scorn and indignation, commanded him instantly to quit the house. " What," cried Angelo, essaying again to clasp her in his arms, " and leave you thus offended?" The delicate Ida struggled violently to escape from his grasp ; while An¬ gelo, ravished at her beauty and un¬ moved by her distress, gazed eagerly upon her. Finding every effort vain' against his superior strength, she made.
a last desperate effort to disengage herself, and in so doing, a portrait which had been concealed in her bo¬ som, escaped from its confinement, and would have falleo to the ground, but that Angelo, catching it from thebroken chain, exclaimed, ·' Ah ' behold the secret of youi seventy to me '—let us see at least the object of your preference ' So saying, he brought the picture near the light, he held it to his eyes, while Ida overcome by shame, horror and exhaustion was unable to offer re¬ sistance—He gazed—gazed wildly '— he gasped for breath Could it be ?— ah ' it was no delusion—the portrait of his father met his view '—of his mother '—those he had given himself to Gabrielle ' —Distracted, overcome

Now he looked eagerly on the crea¬ ture before him ; the heart whiţh had .beat tumultuous with unholy passion, now thrilled with horror ! she could be no other than his daughter whom he beheld, whom he would have de¬ stroyed ! In a faint faltering voice he said, " Sneak, speak ? who gave you this ; -rare you nşt called -^Montmoren¬ cy,?" Id,a, who on j beholding in the coun¬ tenance of Angelo , ţhe sudden change
fn>mlhcbighblushpflÍcentious¿ran9p,prt to. the, pale agony of terror, had reco¬ vered from personal apprehension, and found, hçr feelings attracted, in. a. dif¬ ferent channel. With eager glaţţces, and in an irregular tone, anticipating »ire knew, not, what-, the replied tp the question of Angelo^-r" It, was, a. mother g-a?« it to, laţţr— it m all, sijs. had, to "■ Her name ! ber щт ' " Bţ?P«d -^ιΐτ gelo. " Gabrielle de 3Mion,tpa,9.ţen,(;y !" Angelo flew towaţds. bei. he clasped her to h.iä breast, Tpyhţle IdajS.ţiiltţcmbjling, unknowingv/hat to ţb.ink, endeavored to withdraw from bis strict embrace. " Oh you need not— yøu neeţţ noţ,"
cried Angelo in agony, and almost suf¬ focated by conflicting emotion, horror, confusion, remorse,—"I—I am—your ŕYiťÄer —your namo ii not Ida, but Agnes." Ida shrieked, and nearly fetl to the ground—her father caught her in his arms—she feared no longer, she reposed upon his bosom. With transport, then. how much more pure and delightful, did he press to his heart as a daughter her whom he had viewed with other eyes, and sought for the ignoble pur¬ pose of unhallowed passion. Agnes was the first to recover from their mutual and overpowering lensa- tions; for the fearful lesson *"hich An¬ gelo had received, the awful eheck which had been given to his libertine pursuit, kept him silent, in inward
contemplation and remorseful horror, justly alloying the refined delight he would otherwise have felt in the reco very of a daughter She fixed her eyes upon him and with an air of inquietude and timidity said, " Inform me, mylord, how can you be my father, yet be cal¬ led il Marchese di Orbino '" " Νο,ηο, my beloved child," answered Angelo, near sinking with shame and con¬ fusion," I am not so called,—it was that unwarrantable, that dangerous deception on my side that has kept us eo long m ignorance of each other, that, by permit¬ ting you to remain in an error respecting my name, was near making me curse myself for a wretch steeped in irreme¬ diable sin ' " Ah ' my father, your name is then Angelo D Albim, cried Agnes gazing
on hun with eyes swimming in tears, because of the perfect resemblance she traced between him and his youthful poi trait—then taking it up, sheexamined first onc,thpn'theòther.èxcÌaiming " How little your featuree appear'changed, my father; tbe expression of the countenance is almost thesáíne f'— Then bursting into tears, " how unhappy am I,""she added, never to have beheld my mother, that celestial motìier" of whom Madame Ber¬ trand was continually speaking'to me— Tell me, myfathe'r^ llow's'obn nlay I hope to behold her?"— ' " ""' ' Angelo, who had been gazing on her with tender delight, and listening To her artless effusions, 'now feli his heart-strings * I Ι Γ tit' f t t t ţ. f \ J. , | suddenly contract, and uttering a cry of renewed anguish, he said, " Ah * jou will never behold her ; you—you have no t if t J ι ; j i τ l'I ι· mother!
" No mother '" cried Agnes, in an ac¬ cent of bitter'grief " No, no, my love, she has long since mingled with fier kindred angels—I— I jt was"—the self accusation died on his lips—for where is the father who can bear, to be thoughf guilty by his child ? He coveied his face with his hands, and bursting sobs rent, without relieving his heart Agnes respected the renewed anguish of her father, she did not speak, but laying her ticaú^upon his bosom, mingled her tears with his Angelo pressed her with a sacred fervour to lus lieart, through his eyes, misty with tears, he gazed upon those lovely and noble features, which often he hud fan¬ cied bore a fugitive lcsemlifance to those of the departed Gahuelle, such as when first he had beheld her , now he discerned m them an evident correspon¬ dence with those of that angelic being,
though still the animated expression of her entire countenance more nearly re¬ sembled his own. When the excess of their mutual feel¬ ings had somewhat subsided, Angelo found that he had a thousand inquiries to make, that he was on the rack to know how his beloved child could be thus situated, seemingly alone and un¬ protected, and by what mystery she was enabled to ¿pjifcar thus independent of the world. But the hour was late, and now the father of her he had lately be¬ held with feelings and sentiments so op¬ posite to those of the parent, was trem¬ blingly alive to even the semblance of impropriety inthe conduct of his daugh¬ ter, and punctilious to the slightest trifle that might concern her fame. So, often with the libertine, whose moral feelings are seldom outraged by seeking to de-
slroy the wife, sister, or daughter of anotheı, jet who are ever on the watch to guard their own, and up in arms if the shadow of an insult bc cast upon them. Thus then, Angelo resolved to sacrifice his longing anxiety for an explanation from Agnes, to the interest he neai felt in her reputation, and tore himself away, determined to wait till the following day for its gratification, and the solu¬ tion of every uneasy doubt that ınvolun- iarily preyed upon his mind He scarcely slept during the night яг if he did, momentarily started up, in the thrilling remembrance of having founds daughter, now m the terror that she was being torn away from him, and now m the painful thought that all was but delusion Hei probable situation sometimes presented itself to his mind ,

Now he pondered on liei seeming lovely innocence, and now ' writhed in' anguish, lest it should have been the prey of the seduiicr. So ' passed the hours till morning,' for which he wailed'With intolerable anxiety, and as soon as his sense of decorum, influ¬ enced 'as if was by strong impatience, would' rieïrtiit,' hè hastened to the' áb'Ode ofins daugnťer, álmost yielding to t!io eupeistitious dread that he should no longer find' her there. But the fair " Agries w'as^tlieŕíiôoŕ/eagerly expecting tiim ; yet the delight with Which she're- ceiv'cd Him' was mingled with embarrass¬ ment, and in her fine countenance he read'the traces of uricasy sadness.—He ' looked afncr,"and unknowing' why? his heart misgave him ; he ' took Her hand
with tender seriousness and led her into tbe house The impatience of Angelo to learn the particulars of lier siiuation, was controuled by an invincible yet inexpli¬ cable sensation, that made him shnnk from inquiry,—he longed, yet dreaded to hear, and feared he knew not what The manner of Agnes too was fai from tending toreassuie him, it was hesitating distressed, confused , her eyes filled mo- mentanly will' fcais, and her eheeks weredyed with blushes at every vvoidh* addressed to her w lion theu stt mcd no visible cause ol ι motion At length Angelo could support no longer this dreadful unecrt unti he di ti nnuied fo lead at one« f о (lie suini it so nt ar his heart, and to know the trufii even tliough death or madness musí ensue When then fore ι mutual nnd embai - л ol и ι
íassed pause had ensued, during which he almost fancied he could behold the heart of Agues beat beneath her robe, while his too throbbed with violent and answering emotion, he took her hand, and in a faltering voice said, " But, my dear child has not yet infoimed me, she has not said wherefoie—what has befal¬ len her since her departure from the roof of Madame Bertrand." —He paused.— " My father ' my father '" ıeplıed Agnes m broken accents, " I was then very young—but I—it is my duty to inform you of every thing " " I am most anxious to hear indeed, my love," ıeplıed Angelo, imagining al¬ ready his worst fears verified, yet desi¬ rous to reassure her by his manner, and obtain her confidence " Begin your re¬ lation from the moment of your depar-
lure from llıc ıoof of Madame Berti and, and let nie undeisland likewise why jou called yourseli Ida instead of Ag¬ nes ' The face of Ida was deep crimson,— she trembled and replied, I—I will endeavoui to relate all, my father,—I will commence from the period you men¬ tion,—I will open my heart to you if I can acquire courage,—promise me, promise meonlj/'sheadded,while theteaisfell fast on her bosom, ' that you will he merci ful injudging jour child At ihis appalling preface flic soul of Angelo shook wiflnn lum but he le- niembered tlut he had foi salen his child, that therefoie her faults wei e hi « and that it lie could not be mciciful in his judgment of her what must he ft »i self merit al the bai of eternal justice, ι 'J
hut—perdition ! Fearful to trust his feelings to many words, he only pressed her hand, and murmured, " Proceed." After a few moments more of harrow¬ ing pause, Agnes in faltering accents spoke thus : " I believe I was not more than eleven years of age when I left Madame Ber¬ trand, for so I still continued to call her after her marriage with M. Boffuet. This man tieated me so cruelly, that, child as I was, I wished to die that I might escape from his tyranny. My dear Madame Bertrand used to wecp over me, and that I might not render her more miserable than she was from the conduct of her husband, I always endea¬ voured to disguise from her his treat¬ ment of me in her absence, which was infinitely worse than when she was
present. Не considered me as an in¬ truder in his house, and one whom it was not incumbent on him to support, in consequence of which he scrupled not to seize every opportunity of depriving m* offood." Already lhe heart of Angelo bled at every word uttered by his deserted child, the child whom he, rich in every luxury, possessing ample means to cherish and protect, had abandoned even before she was born, and resigned to the mercy of strangers, who, insensible to the tender¬ ness of parental feelings, could without pity aggrieve and wrong her. Terrible is the thought to a fond parent, that his tender child is left among those who love it not, and to Angelo, though late in¬ flicted, this pang was not to be for ever spared. Perceiving the grief she excited in her father, yet knowing well, keen E 3
as it was, it was the least, alas, which the must cause him to suffer; she hasten¬ ed over this part of her narrative, and proceeded to later events. " It was not however till extreme terror in the apprehension of а threat¬ ened severe chastisement from the un¬ feeling Boffuet, for a trifling fault, that knowing it would be impossible ulti¬ mately to escape his vengeance, which would acquire increased fury only, ftom being delayed, I seized an opportunity of flying secretly from the house, un¬ knowing where to bend my steps, and indifferent if I but escaped the dreaded punishment. I wandered about among the most unfrequented vallies, and mountains 1 had never trod before, till us the shades of evening came on, I sat inj self bya little rivulet behind the pro¬ jecting part of α lock ; alarmed at the
prospect before me, yet still more alarmed at the idea of retui mng and yielding to childish weakness Itouldiiot ìestrain myself fiom weeping bitterly Presentii I heard footsteps approaching the spot, dreading lest it should be Bof¬ fuet in puibuit of me, I started up and with the wildest speed began to ascend the rock, when a gentle female vo ce arrested my flight " Do not be alarmed, my child,—do not fly ' I ventured to turn, and beheld an ele¬ gant female leaning on the arm of a gentleman, whose tender and comp , ίο - nate looks helped to ilisnt 1 mj fears and induced me to stop llie lady diew nigh, and taking my hand, gazed car ncstly m m) countenance, then exclaim¬ ed to her companion, " Steinhaussen —my God—how much like our deai Ida''
" I thought so the instant I beheld her, returned the Baron Sleinhaussen , then addressing me, " who are your pa¬ ient«, my sweet child '" " Alas, Ì know not," answered I bursting into tears— " I never saw them." " How '" exclaimed they both at once, " you are an orphan then i " " No," answeied I, " I have an an¬ gelic mother, of whom I have heard muıh I have a father too, but he never siw mc ' ' 'Icll mc sweet eluld * cried the Baroness lnsfilv " why do wc find jou htn '—if j ou belong f о any one, why do vou not lelumhome'

" I have no home,"I replied, "noneat least that I have a right to claim, and it is better to die here witb hunger, where uo one cares for me, than of ill treatment where I should grieve at least one heart by my death." " But explain tous," said the Baron ; "we may find some means of reconciling you to return home, or of" -------- " My dear Steinhaussen," cried the Baroness, " this poor child seems de¬ termined not to return home ; perhaps ľ 5

If, on the contrary,the reasons she adduces for baving fled, appear to us just and reasonable, we will keep her with us, and she shall be to us instead of our dear depaited Ida, whom she so strongly resembles." "What say you, my child?" cried
the Baton, "are you inclined to go with us ŕ " Oh, yes, yes, ' I eagerly replied, " I should be too happy," and running to the Baioness, I seired her hands, and kissed them, exclaiming, " You are so good, so like Madame Bertrand, whom I have been forced to quit ' " Sweet child," cried she, infinitely affected, " come with us at once, and unless you wuh it you shall quit us no more ' " She took mc by Ihc hand, and I re¬ turned between them to their mn, the kindness of the Baroness, and her en¬ dearing manners induced mc to tell her all I knew of ray histoiy, while upon the ill treatment I had icceived from Bolluet, as it had made the deepest impression upon my mind, I expatiated

of the Baroness, but could not entirely reconcile himself to ibe idea On ob- lerving this, I, who dcstf ed ordenfly to remam with them, for Mudarne Bertrand had always told me that pcihaps I should nevei see my parents, and that fhey had agreed to let me remainwith her, jet inspired with courage, foi the thought of Boffuet was appalling to me, and m remaining with her I must remain with him likewise , this terrible-reflection was enough , I cast mjself on my knees befoie the В irou and reclaimed, " Ah, I intreat you do not leave me—do not force me back—yet if you determine, be assured that I will not long remain, and then what may bc my fate > ' Angelo felt indignant at discovering that Madame Bertrand had concealed from Agnes the repeated solicitations of her parents tohave ber returned to them,

I, shall look upon you as a daugh¬ ter " " Oh, call me whatyou will," answer- edl, "suffer me but to remainwith you " " The Baron and Baroness Steinhaussen were making the tour of Switzerland, they bad penetrated far into its interior, they had visited its most sublime, ro¬ mantic, and unfrequented parts, they were on the eve of departing, when in one of their farewell rambles along the borders of the lake they had encoun¬ tered me I considered myself supreme¬ ly happy in this accidental occurrence, and joyfully accompanied them on the following morning, (the period which had been already fixed for then depar-
ture). One thing alone embittered my happiness, it was the idea ofthe suf¬ ferings of my dear Madame Bertrand, when she should find that I no more returned. I longed to give her some intelligence respecting my situation, but fear lest tbe tyrannical Boffuet, for the purpose of making me endure some horrible punishment, should insist on mybeing restored, was sufflcient to deter me from, and make me shudder at the thought " I shall pass over, my dear father, a period of several ycars,during which time I was treated by my protecting friends in pvery respect as their daughter, and was lîniversallv esteemed as such. They gave nie the name of Ida, which had been that «if an only beloved daughter, Who had died in their arms at nearly the same age as myself, when first I
belarne known to them Thus was I as happy ascircumstanccs would permit,and no inquiries respecting me having from that period reached them, they had no othei idea but that of considering me foi ever as their own, the Baioness fiequently assuring me that she wa« uncertain which she mest loved, be; sea, still absent at Göttingen perfecting hi» education, or myself " But although I was unclaimed by my parents, perhaps even my existence unknown to them, not a day elapsed that tiny were absent from my mind, of my sairited mother I loved to thmk, I re¬ membered and cherished all that Madame Bertrand had told mc concern¬ ing her, and considering her as something above mortality, I even addressed my prayers to her, and in fond enthusiasm
implored her influence to direct my conduct " That beloved portrait wluchMadame Bertrand had infoimed me her dear hands had placed round my neck, when for the last time she saw me, I gazed on eveiy night with the holy fervour of a bigot, kissed and piously worshipped It was all I could call mine, it was al¬ most my only care If accidentally I stumbled, unmindful of the pam or injury I might feel, I examined eager¬ ly my portrait, if that was safe, I was indifferent to every other consideration In sorrow it consoled me, ш sickness it cured mc, if despondent I but gazed on it, hope and pleasing prospects danced in my view I lamented that it was only the gift of my dear mother, and that liei owu fair image was not added to
the group; in default, however, Iwould gaze on that of the Countess D'Albini, and would endeavour to persuade myself that it was hers, or resembled her at least. I had shown it to the Baroness Stein¬ haussen, as a miser shews his gold; scarce¬ ly could I enduré that she «hould touch it. " My dear child," said she to me, .".yöunin lose this valuable ornament, and it is not impossible but that at some future period its possession might be material to you ; give it into my hands, I' will carefully preserve it for you; you run great risk indeed in carry¬ ing it thus about you." " Ah, dear madam", cried I, " by accident I can never lose it, I guard it as it were my life, neither fraud norviolcncc could wrest it from mc, but if that were possible, I should ne\er live to regietits loss ; do not then desire me to resign it
to you, for with no One can it be mote safe than with myself " The Barones» pressed meno further, and my cherished treasuic remarned in my besom." Angolo raised his eyes to Heaven in grateful acknowledgment fer the hap¬ piness he had gained,a>nd for the horrors he had avoid** by its fortönate'pïéser- Vation. Agues proceeded. " I had neveť yet beheld Darlowitz, the son of the Barda Steinhaussen - all I knew of him was from his parents, who spoke of him in terms of rapture ; and I learnt that he was affianced to a beautiful female who frequently visited atthc house,and never failed to make the minutest inquine" respecting his health, pursuits, and when he would return home. At length he returned."—
Agnes paused—" He was elegant and accomplished—deep blushes covered her ingenuous face, and bosom, she cast her tearful eyes upon the ground, the soul of Angelo grew sick within him—he trembled, and his emotion incapacitated him ftom speaking, Agnes continued щ a faltering voice, " He conceived an attachment for me, in preference to her to whom he was be¬ trothed—I—I—oh God ' my father, will you not spare me '" she exclaimed w an agony, and buisting into tears " Oh, wietch ' monstrous, and accus¬ ed wietch · that I am," cried the fallier, starting on his feet with the wild looks of despair—" 4gncs, Agnes, you arethen infamous ' — igncs sobbed aloud, and casting ber¬ li
self at the feet of her father—" Infa¬ mous do you call me, oh, my father ' ' she murmured, " Speak, speak,—are you not ?—oh ' if you are not, say at once, and save my brain from bursting ' " "—I—I—Darlowitz—I loved bim¬ be— " " He made you his wife—say that he did — oh ' say it, Agnes ' "— "\o, no '—cried \gnes, " I cannot say it, but"— " But what '"— " With joy he would have made me so " " Oh, God '— tremendous God '"cried
Angelo in a wild voice, and sinking on hie knees, beside his daughter, " I have deserved all this—yes, yes, I feel that I have Agnes' my girl, my deserted help¬ less girl he added, pressing her in his arms—"I will not—I daie not re¬ proach thee Speak to mc in confidence then,—proceed, and let me know all I will endeavour to heai tllee, and not yield to madness,—and for the anguish I may feel, it is mj merited portion Rise, my beloved—rise, and pioceed. The drooping Agnes tremblingly aiose, leaning on the extended hand of her father,—he pressed her m his arms— re seated her, and she thus continued. ' Though the Baroness loved me as а daughter, no sooner did she discover the seeiet of her son s attachment to me, than she became half frantic, accident h id revealed it to her, and one day when
Darlowitz was m my apartment eon versing to me of his passion, she entered and surprised us " Is it thus, ungrate¬ ful girl ' ' she cried, " that you reward my love > and you, Darlowitz, is it thus you respect the honour of your fa¬ thei '" "I burst into tears, grief, shame, humi¬ liation debarred me of the power of speech, but Darlowitz approaching,took my hand, which on the entrance of his mother he had relinquished, and said— " Weep not, my beloved Ida, for are you not m reality my wife? and have I not sworn nev er to consider as such, other than yourself? Madam, ' proceeded he, addressing the Baroness, " I loved Ida almost from the moment I beheht her, she loved me in return, and she became mine When you speak ofthe honour of my father remember the honour of
your son, and feel that be is bound by every tic to her, moral, human, and di¬ vine. " " Oh ! great God ! Darlowitz," ex¬ claimed the Baroness, " you have be¬ come a wretch, you are the seducer of innocence, of an unfortunate orphan protected beneath the roof of the Baron ; and while you have been guilty of so abominable a crime, you will have the additional one of destroying j'our father." " Ah, my dear mother," cried Darlo¬ witz, " my father possesses a firm mind : if he be offended with his son, he can cast him from his heart; but after what you have yourself said, you arc a power¬ ful advocate in the cause of Ida, since if I have been already the wretch you de¬ scribe, how much more infamous should I become by forsaking her ? What repa- VOL. iv. r
ration can 1 make but swearing to be her'· forever?" " Retire, and leave me with Ida," cried the Baronets 'indignantly to her ion. " I will, madam," Darlowitz re¬ plied; " but first, Ida, hear me," he Cried, falling at my feet ; " beware, my love and my wife, how you are prevailed en to resign me ; remember that I live but for you—by rash and fancied hero¬ ism you may precipitate a fate you may regret, and gain no meditated end." So saying, he left the room; when the Baron¬ ess approaching me, took me in her arms and wept over me : '* My dear and in¬ jured child," sheened, "I can make you mo reproach, you have suffered luffi- eiently ; and I alone, who should have foreseen that no one could behold with¬ out loving you, I alone am to blame.
Miserable am I, that a creature every way so worthy, one whom I tenderly love, can yet never become m reality my daughter. Listen to me with patience, and I will explain to you lome particu¬ lar circumstances of which you are not aware, and which will sufficiently show you,how impossible it is for Darlowitz, consistently with honour and duty, to be¬ come your huiband, or tbe husband of any but Julia Falkenheim, to whom he u affianced " At these words I covered my face with my hands and groaned, for I considered Darlowitz as already rny huiband " Hear me, my child/ pursued the Baroness, endeavouring to subdue her own emotion—" the Baron Steinhaussen is peculiarly situated with the Baron Falkenheim, father of Julia Some years since he lost to him at the gaming table ρ g
nearly the whole of his personal pro¬ perty , he was overwhelmed with de¬ spair, as the payment of the debt must bc his ruin, and pcihaps have exiled him m shame and sorrow to a land where he might live unknown Under these cir¬ cumstances it was that the Baron Га1- kenheim, who courted an alliance with our family,which is more noble than his, proposed to Steinhaussen to wave for ever his claims upon his fortune, upon condition that he would promise his son ш marriage to Julia, adding that if he would accede to this proposition he should consider the lionour that would be done him more than an equivalent for the debt " Though the family of IVlkenheim a not so ancient as ouis, it is highly re¬ spectable, and Steinhaussen after some roimdemtion yielded to the teuns pro-
posed , the debt was in consequence cancelled, and Dailowitz became the betrothed husband of Julia Think, then, my dearest Ida how impossible it is for the Bai on at this 1 ite period, to think of reti acl ing without appear¬ ing at once the most contemptible and dishonourable of mankind Should he discover the attachment of our son to you, and the mutual vows which you have uttered, I am convinced he would die at once with rage, or bo bowed down to the giave with shame and disappointment ' What could I íeply to this > It was evident the Iîaıoness desired me to say the words I ıesıgn уош son and peihaps had I consıdeıed myself alone I should hau jıeldcd to the sacrifice But I rcmembeied the powerful ad¬ juration of Dailowitz, the ^vvild jet ι 3
disordered look with which he had utter¬ ed " Remember, I live but for you ^-by yielding to rash and fancied hero¬ ism, you may precipitale ray fate " My heart was torn with conflicting sensa¬ tions, my brain was shaken by a con¬ fusion of tormenting idea and I could only utter, " For myself I care not— no one cares for me—do with me as you will—but tlimk of your ion " " What hopes the Barones» might gather ftom these expressions of my despair I know not, but she embraced me with an animated tenderness, and blessed me a thousand times Her hopes were however destined to receive a cheek , while she had been convers¬ ing with me, Darlowitz, half frantic had flown to the Baron, acknowledged alt that the Baroness had been so ar-
siout to conceal, and sworn before hım that none but me should be hu wife ' " At this rash communication, which appeared to him not only to threaten the destruction of his best prospects, but to render him a villain m the eyes ofthe world, he raved with wildest passion« and reprobating his son m the se¬ verest terms, swore in bis turn, that if he did not instantly retract his oath, he would consider him no longer as я son But Darlowitz lemamedfirm, and to the alledgcd honour of his father opposed his own Boiling with ter¬ rible ıage, he sought the Baroness, and in broken sentences infoimed her of that which she already knew It was in vain that by her mild representa¬ tions she sought to calm him, and al¬ ledgcd her »anguine hope, that all E 4
would jet be well, she could obtain only in return the most frantic ravings, or the peremptory command, " Bid him then—force your son to ictract at once ' Darlowitz was unchanged by this violence, he vowed, fervently vow¬ ed, that his own death or mine should alone separate us, and reiterating bis rows lo me, dared to oppose thein as a shield to the despair and indignation of his father " The fearful emotion ofthe Baron Steinhaussen, and the shock hu mmd had received, threw him into a raging fever and delirium, and in a few days his physicians announced that his recovery was next to impossible ' Now the time was nearly arrived that the marriage of Darlowitz with Julia was intended to take place The
Baroness Stemhaussen finding the at¬ tempt vain to move her son, directed the whole of her efforts to induce me to resign Inm, while Darlowitz, dis¬ tracted between his conflicting duties, rushed like a maniac, from the apart¬ ment of his father to mine, from mine to his fathei s, knelt in deep remorse by his bedside, wept in agony over me, and appeared no longer guided in his conduct but by an impulse, which m •the confusion of his feelings he could scarcely identify " For mc, I knew not how to act, the life of both father and son were dcarei to me than my own, and I only hesi¬ tated how to decide, from the fear of sacrificing one or the other At length the malady of the Baron Steinhaussen encreased to such a degiee that his end seemed rapidly approaching, he had re- i5
covered his senses, and desired to be¬ hold his son, and that I might accom¬ pany him, at this mandate my heart almost died within me for I felt as though I were going to witness thei last moments of one whom I had pre¬ cipitated to the grave, and conscience already loaded me with reproaches, tar more severe than any I could anti¬ cipate —I attended however, and when, like an arraigned culprit, I entered, I beheld with an acute pang, Darlowitz. and the Baroness kneeling by the bed¬ side of the dying Bai on, each holding a hand "As I drew nigh,the Baron turned on me his mournful eye? of tender re¬ proach, and faltered out my name At this appalling sight, to behold my benefactor dying, and through my means, to feel that but for their bene-
volence to a friendless orphan, they might have lived for ever A happy and united family, whereas from the ingra¬ titude and baseness of the viper they had cherished, it was doomed to prove their curse:— " No, never ' " I exclaimed as these ideas rushed through my mind, " No» uever, never shall the lowly objeet of your bounty prove a wretch so vile I Live,my lord ! live!" 1 pursued, throw¬ ing myself on my knees at tbe foot of the bed, and stretching out my arms towards him, " live yet a thousand years, for be assured that Ida shall not shorten your days." " The Baron endeavoured to raise himself in the bed, but could not, and faintly mutuimeli " What is that I heat ?"
"ThatIda resigns Darlowitz!" I cried with increased animation/'and will never mar the happiness ot her bene¬ factors." A sudden beam of joy illumined the dim eyes of the Baron, and in broken accents he uttered, " Oh, generous Ida, you have saved my life—Darlowitz, Darlowitz, my son !" Darlowitz sprang from bis knees, and with a lolemn air approached me. " Ida," said he, " do you resign me ?" " I do, dear Darlowitz, I am no lon¬ ger your wife, but henceforth your sister only." " It ii enough," cried Darlowitz with a look of despair— " My father," turning towards the Baron, " Ida Willi
U— Hve — for I swear to become the husband of Julia " At these words the Baron uttered a faint cry and sank into a swoon the agitation of sudden joy had overpower¬ ed his weak frame, and threatened to terminate а life that grief had already so much endangered By proper ap¬ plications he revived however, the so¬ vereign balm of hope filled his veins with fresh life, and ïapid as had been hu illness,Ins recovery was almost equal¬ ly so " I had solemnly resigned Darlowitz, and I resolved to behold him no more , not that I dreaded my own weakness, butthe wildness of his despair I there fore immured myself in m_, chamber, and to the intreaties of Darlowitz for
the admission of only a moment, remain¬ ed inexorable " Though I had resolution to debar myself ofthe eight of my lover, I was not equal to the harrowing idea of re- mamingm the house till he should become the wife of another I wrote therefore а few lines to the Baroness, intreating that she would come to me without the knowledge of Darlowitz She has¬ tened to obey my request, when I com¬ municated to her the anxious desue which I felt to quit an abode, where the heart-wrung sacrifice I had made was continually present to my mind ; adding, that when removed from be¬ neath the same roof with Darlowitz, he might thmk less of me, and more of Julia Falkenheim. " Heroic child, ' cried the Baronets,
" in every thing like yourself The Baron and myself have had it in contempla¬ tion to address you uponthis subject, but feared the possibility of wounding delicacy so noble and so refined as yours Too surely Darlowitz can never recover the passion with which you have inspired him, while he knows that you remain beneath fhe same roof with him, it is only by your absence that wo may prenume to hope he may in time obtain a victory over his heart. But, my dearest Ida, another motive prevented us from hinting to you what you have of joursclf proposed , we de¬ sired to render our beloved girl, the child of our adoption, for ever inde¬ pendent of contingencies, and we fear¬ ed that if we declared to her our wish and intention of doing so, that her dc ate mind would feel wounded, conceiving we meant to compensate
her fora sacrifice beyond all price, or bribe her never more to reclaim it Now however there is no further cause of hesitation—learn then, my child, that the Baron determines to secure to you a pension duung your life, more than adequate to your wants, and sufficient to enable you to sustain an appearance befitting his daughter, for such he will ever consider you, in whatever part of the globe you may fix your residence Further have I to add, my beloved Ida, that if you refuse this small memorial ofan eternal gratitude from your pa¬ rents, so far below what jou have a right to claim, that you will have the reproach of embittering our future lives, of humbling us to the earth, and of robbing your noble sacrifice of half its value in our eyes, nay, so much would your refusal wound the love and pride of the Baron, that perhaps all would.
be rendered useless which you have done to secure his happiness " " I threw myself into the arms of the Baroness " Be assured," said I, "thatI will refuse nothing winch can add to your felicity, I believe you know and value me too well, to propose to me any thing which you would despise me for acceding to , formyself, I consider you, and ever shall, in the light of parents, to whom I can never be humiliated , but, my dear benefactress, perhaps I may not long exist f о be α care either to myself or j ou ' " Ah, say not so, my beloved," cried the Baroness, tenderly embracing me, " have better thoughts, and live to close the eyes of one w ho loves you as a moa thei ·

the tears which had been long trembling m her ejes, now slreamcd down her paie cheeks, and she audibly sobbed. Angelo, unable to resist pity, took her in Ins arms, his soul was tortured at the sufferings, while it gloried in the heroism of lus eluld —" Weep not, my be¬ loved Agnes,' he cried, " weep not over the past, be consoled in the reflec¬ tion that you have been more unfortunate than guilty, and that your dignified conduct has been some expiation for an error wlnrh is less yours, m effect, than mine, who should hai e been near to protect and to preserve jou ' Agnes still wept upon the bosom of her father, liei tears wcic a ι innocent tribute to the past for her heart was guiltless of even an improper idea for lum who was now the husband of дно-
ther Angelo succeeded in soothing hei , and she resumed " Much more remains not for me to say. Finding myself alone in the w orld, destitute of friends, or of natural pio tectors, I determined fo travel into Switzerland, there to seek the dear mother of my childhood, the only one I had ever known, and enquire if she had beard aught of my parents, or could give me some intelligence respecting them But, alas, my dear father, I arrived at the w ell known spof, her cottage still remain¬ ed, but its formi" occupant dwelt mit no more, Mad une Bertrand had ceased to exist "Madame Bcifiand no moie '"ex¬ ci uined Angelo, " not long since I heard fiom her

" I do not want anything of you, M Boffuet,' said I— 'I am not at this junc¬ ture quite 10 destitute as I have been " " Ob, if that be the case," answered this mercenary and llliberalbcing, "come in, Mademoiselle, and remain as long as you chuse " " I entered with a beating heart, and desired to be conducted to the chamber where my dear friend bad died I knelt beside the bed where she had breathed her last, I kissed the pillow where her poor head had lain, bedewed it witb my tears, and blessed God that she was now where persecution and suffering could reach ber no more " All this time Bofiuet left me to my¬ self, when I returned to lum I found his manners considerably changed, from gross
rudeness to still grosser adulation and the most constrained politeness "Mademoiselle de Montmorency," said he, " I am happy to hear that you are no longer m need ofthe bounty of stranger· I confess, when I first beheld you, I thought you had come to reclaim that trifling sum entrusted to Madame Boffuet for you against a time of necessity, but I am pleased, for your own sake, that you had no such idea, as I must have conteited the claim —Since you have no occasion for it, you cannot but allow that it is a very inadequate return for the many years of protection and sup¬ port afforded you by myself and Madame Boffuet, who, poor woman, was not cer tainly the wisest of her sex * " If I could have viewed with scorn or detestation any one who was hal-
, lowed in my eye», by having lived Willi, and conversed with my dear departed friend, it would have been this wretch, but I pitied the miserable meanneii of his disposition, and without noticing his observation, enquued of him if my dear Madame Bertrand had heard from my parents since my departure, of if he could inform me of aught respecting them " Madame Boffuet,' answered he, " certainly informed your parents of your departure, I believe they were at that time m England, but excuse me if I acknowledge that I never much par¬ ticipated in these interests of my wife, and that she tlierefore seldom or ever shewed me the letters which ihe received Some little time back she bad a letter from Italy, over which she wept most bitferly, poor weak woman Who wa s th«
author I cannot pretend to determine, but in all probability it came from some friend of your parents, informing her of ete«ibleca,lamity, for nothing else surely could excite such immoderate grief." " And (ell me, tell me," cried I eager- ty,"what became of that letter ? Oh I if you have it still, give it me ; it may be the maps of leading me to my parents !" " Wfay, I should be extremely happy, Mademoiselle," returned he, hesita¬ tingly," bnt in truth I was uever a friend to concerning myself in affairs which did not concern me; and when my wife died I destroyed all her papers, and among them I suppose all the letters she had ever received from your mother." " Oh! my God!"exclaimed I,"was it possible that you could act thus ? and VOL. IV. r.
was that last letter which you speak of among them?" " Why, as to that, Mademoiselle—I cannot say it w as."— " Oh then you have preserved it'" I cried ; " give it to me."

" Poor Madame Bertrand!" exclaim¬ ed I, " dear persecuted friend ' " when perceiving the brow of Bofiuet begin¬ ning to lower, 1 added, " Ah ' had that letter but been preserved, I think I could have forgiven the loss of all the rest." " Oh, but I was glad to destroy my old tormentors, the letters," answered the unfeeling Boftuet, " it was the only e 2
revenge I could take for the inconve- niencc4heybad caused me during her lifetime ; but who expected ever to see you again ! yon might have had them. Mademoiselle, if I had known." " What could be said to a savage like this í I hastily took my leave af him, with coolness indeed, but avoided re¬ proaches which he would have been incapable of feeling. I lingered а few days about my dear native land, I wandered among the mountains of my childhood, among the fruitful val¬ lies, aud along the magnificent borr ders of the Genevan lake. Unable however to remain in а spot where I had no longer aught to interest or att- fach uie, and feeling that by perpetual change of scene alone could I hqpe to banish ideas no longer to be indulged without crime, I departed ftom Swit-
zerland, and fondly dwelling on the slender shadow of hope excited by the intimation of Bofiuet, that the last letter my dear parent il fntnd had ie ceived had been fiom Italy, I detir- ninied thither to bend my course, in the flattering idea that some chance might perhaps occur, which might di¬ rect me to my parents, or at least discover to them that their daughter still existed " It was owing to chance alone that I fixed my residence on this spot, its retired situation pleased me, I thought it a more safe and proper habitation than any which a çay town ..ould aflord me, and determined for α time at least to remain m it The features ol eveiy stranger ol either чех that passed my door, or thai I accidentally encountered, i have examined with an eager and t, J
impatient interest, a» though some se¬ ctei intelligence should perhaps re¬ veal a parent, or some one at least connected wilh them : I ean account no otherwise for the singular sensation I experienced on beholding my father than from that powerful instinct originating in force of blood, as it were, by which nature draws resistlessly towards each other those connected by Iter sacred tics. " I can safely aver that I felt in¬ voluntarily drawn toward« you; and though I entertained a conviction. that my admission of your visits must, im¬ press you with an unfavourable idea of me, it was impossible for mc to re¬ sist an attraction which acquir¬ ed fresh strength each time that I be¬ held you. When absent I thought of you perpetually with an indefinable in-
terest, and when present, my heart would sometimes experience a sudden emotion which I cannot describe, but which almost tempted mc to throw myself into your arms, and exclaim " Great God ! I know not wily, but í love you, as if you were my fa¬ ther !" Agnes concluded, and in α sweet en¬ thusiasm threw herself into the arms of her real parent, who, overpowered by her tender and sacred emotion, pressed her to his breast, and, .wept over hertears, which, though not unmin- gled witb bitter feelings, were yet the sweetest that for long he had shed.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Angelo had recovered a long lost daughter ; but bow recovered her f The fond gratulations of the father were cbtcbed by bitter anguished reflections on the past ; and while he wished to remember only that he had found a child, he wai doomed to feel tliat she could never be his boast. Her who might have flourished a fair blooming rose beneath the fostering hand of a parent, was blighted by the storm, aud broken by the foot of the sfranger. Conscience whispered lhat the fault
was his, and that he who foi sakes im infancy his offspring, must not hope to be blessed by tbem in glorious pride upon a future day 1 Angelo viewed hi» daughter with tbe fondest affection ; he idolized the lovely artleisness of her character, admired her* singular beauty, and was charmed with her just and noble sentiments ; yet still, »till be could not triumph in her. In the midst of her brilliant qualities hit tenacious 'eye discerned a blemish, and such was his pride, selfish and un¬ just, that he could not bear to ac¬ knowledge to the world that thi» long-lost, long-sought daughter was not perfect t that the child, left foi years unaided on the wide desert of the world, had fallen a prey to inevi¬ table fate ; he could not even euduie
the idea of passing her on society for a creature perfect in character as in form, lestin an evil hour her secret should ho betrayed, and he be covered with α dreadful shame, which, however me¬ rited, he felt that he could never sup¬ port. Thus tremblingly alive was the li¬ bertine to his own dishonour, and thus minutely sensible, Could he feel and judge of a calamity that the had entailed upon many a doting parent, fond husband, or honourable brother, whose best hopes might have been fixed upon the fair female he had destroyed. To a very few and select friends therefore alone wai Agnes by the ap¬ prehensive Angelo introduced, and even Ihose he examined with a lynx-eyedt fearful anxiety, lest in the innocent looks of (he lovely Agnes they should
read what he so trembled to have surmised Even the homage which was paid her, yielded him a pleasure al¬ loyed bv an impatient and uneasy dread lest some accident should oc¬ cur to prove her unworthy of it and change it into scorn if (indeed any eould have viewed with scorn ι crca- tnrelike Agnes) or when informed of her story, have beheld her with other eyes than those of а respectful pity No one indeed could thmk of bis daughter half so severely as did Angelo himself Often did hc pause on the idea of quitting with bei the woild amlburj mg himself in а piofomid utilement ' where thought he I nu 0 'it with. out fear or restr tint idmire the virtues of my Agnes no worldly convitici ıtıons would then intiivcne to covir mV tlieck
with the burning blush of shame ; for¬ getting her errors I might dwell only on her excellencies, while the society of one so beloved, would be a suffi¬ cient preservative against lassitude or ennui." Bnt these reflections faded by de¬ grees from the mind of Angelo ; though entering deep the vale of years, he still loved tihe world, and to think serious¬ ly of quitting it for ever, wai, he found, impossible. His was not a mind to be thrown upon itself; frivo¬ lous habits and long residence in so¬ ciety had unfitted him for the delights of solitude, which, so far from pos¬ sessing any charms to him, appeared re¬ plete with horrors. At length upon a sincere investiga¬ tion of his sentiments, he discovered
that he war. in reality anxious for se¬ clusion for his daughter only, while he shuddered at it for himself. Could he induce her to leave the world, where he durst not exhibit her in the proud light he wished, he would pro¬ cure for her some elegant retirement, and consider bimself supremely happy in her acquiescence. Thus with an un¬ becoming and morbid pride, did he shrink ftom accomp?iying int» society the child for whose errors he alone was accountable, and with a selfish weakness sti!) more unpardonable at his period of life, hesitate to abandon a world from which yet he wished to exile a young and lovely being, that but for his own conduct would never have given him caueeeven for thi« sha¬ dow of reproach. Such had been the extremity to which
his pride had prevailed, that he had ordered Agnes to address the Baron Steinhaussen in a letter which he dic¬ tated, thanking hint for the protection which had been so long afforded her, and simply intimating that an occur¬ rence of «ecent date had tendered it longer unnecessary for her to avail herself ofi their continued bounty ; re¬ questing »t tlie same time, that it might bc instantly withdrawn. Thus carefully avoiding throughout all re¬ currence-to the name of Darlowitz, and all mention of her having found a parent. From that period tbe name of Slein¬ haussen was hateful to him ; and when Agnes would, sometimes innocently dwell upon the kindness they had demonstrated towards her, the impa¬ tient looks of her father would spee-
dily shew her that she touched upon a string which vibrated only discord : by degrees, therefore, she dreaded, without knowing why, and ultimate¬ ly ceased altogether to allude to them. If became necessary however to de¬ cide: either Agnes, being constantly with her father, must at once be unequivo¬ cally introduced as his daughter, or else some other situation must be thought of for her ; for in this desul¬ tory and unsettled state, liable to a¡ thousand inconveniences, subject to eternal alarm, it was impossible to continue. One day when she was sit¬ ting in the same room with him, An¬ gelo, whohadlong had it in contempla¬ tion to propose to her a plan on which he Suffered liimself to dwell with pe cullar complacency, thought hc bail
now discovered a mode by which, with¬ out appearing to desire it, he eould lead her on, not only to yield but joyfully to accede to what he bad in view. " Agnes, my dear child," said he ten¬ derly, taking her hand, " among all those of my friends whom you have seen,wluch do you prefer?" " I ha-ve no preference fbr any one» iny dear father," replied Agnes, '* but I esteem them all equally " " And is there not any one among them, Agnes,that you could esteem suf¬ ficiently for a husband ?" Agnes started back, and the colour forsook her cheeks, then with her native artlessneas she cried, teats rushing to her eyes, " Ah, my dear father, I only implore you, talk not to
me of marriage ; I hope and trust that your daughter cherishes no sentiment which shouldbe banishedfrom her breast ; but ah ! shefeelsthather heart cannot be offered to another—that—that ithasbeen wedded once, and can ,<лк« no second husband." Angelo bit his lips, and his determi¬ nation to pursue hi« parpóse acquired fresh strength. " Agnes," said he, -with a seriou» «ir, " hitt to -whom yonr heart was wedded, is now the-htnbttd of ano¬ ther." " Tis tiue," cried Agnes-baretiflg into tears, " and" I love bim for the virtee which caused bim to become so," " It is a point," replied Angelo, witb encreasing gloom, " that I have no de¬ sire to hear 4bcueeed." '
" Oh ' my father, cried Agnes in л mournful voice, I feel nothing which you ought not to bear confessed ' It is enough, ıeplıed Angelo " Time, I have often tliought, might ef¬ fect a revolution in your sentiments, jet if uot— ' "In tbe sentiments which I feel it no crime,but aglory to cherish, my fathei, ' interrupted Agnes, " time never can— then what--------* "Why then," interrupted Angelo in return—" m the seclusion of a convent should you learn that your present sen¬ timents are in reality criminal ' There too should you expiate the offence of having entertained them " Great God ' ' cried Agnes, sinkuig
•n her knees, and raising her hands to heaven, " have 1 been so long in error then,and has conscience failed to reproach ine î can I be indeed the guilty creature which my father represents me f Ah ' if if be indeed so, in the gloom of a con¬ vent let me hide my head , if I am inno¬ cent, that awful gloom will have no ter¬ rors foi me ' but in uninterrupted com¬ munion with my own heart, I may be¬ hold it as it is, repentover its sins, or re¬ joice in its purity " The heart of Angelo smote him at the pious and artless appeal of the daughter he had so unjustly accused , but raising her from the ground, lie said " \VeII do 1 know my swett Agnes sins not л olun- tanly, even in thought, but the boly soli¬ tude ofa convent, by teaching hei to look into horsclf, will purify fiom every vo¬ nlai error, a miud already so good, so

servatioıı.If she remained in the worldsbe might at some future period be pressed again to' marry, an idea from which, above every other, her unhealed heart revolted ; by - yielding to monastic, se¬ clusion she preserved her fidelity to her first love, she yielded his place in her heart to no mortal image, but to thut of God alone ' It was this last reflection which rais¬ ed her to enthusiasm. Religion and obedience spoke through the medium of an unconqüered love, and .while' in¬ fluenced singly by that, she believed it was to them, she yielded : she embra¬ ced her father, and iu an animated voice, With glowing cheeks aud sparkling eyes, exclaimed, " Do with me as you will, my father ' you have recovered your daugh¬ ter, you rejoiced when you did so, let her not prove thai she is unworthy of
your love by being hostile to jour wishes " With a mixed sensation of pleasure and remorse, Angelo returned the fervid embrace of the innocent Agnes, who little surmised the complex movements of her father s heart, or the secret springs which actuated his conduct The strong power of her first love made perpetual seclusion seem easy to Agnes and robbed it of its repulsive terrors, but pure indeed must be the love which takes re¬ fuge m religion, and innocent the ten¬ derness which may be animated by devo tion >
CHAPTER XXIX.
Having so far compassed his purpose in gaining the acquiescence of the gentle Agnes, Angelo, unneeeisarily ap¬ prehensive that the might letract, or dosire at least to do so, hastened every necessary measure, and shortly esta¬ blished herin the convent della Tri¬ nita delle Monache, one of the most splendid receptacles in all Italy for the daughters of the nobility, and ac¬ counted one of the richest in its or¬ naments, and pictures. But to remain in Italy during the whole year of her noviciate, was a circumstance which
would materialíy derange íhe ,pjans of Aagelo, who was now desjrous of quo¬ ting it as early as posşihle. He confided to an jnttma^e /rierid his embarrassment, who instantly proposed to exert whatever influence he possessed individually, and all be¬ sides that be could çpnıruand, ţo pro¬ cure a dispensation from the Pope for limiting the time pf her noyiciaje iţi six njpnths. Angelo hailed this idea früh rapture, and immediately put in motion every epgjue tp fodjttø it. He was soon given to understand that he need not doubt of success, and he resolved therefore to remain in Naples during the indispensable period, to vi¬ sit his daughter in her convent, bat never permit her to leave it, iest inter- TOL. iv. u
course with the world should make the» contrast on her return to it appear too forcible, and give her a distaste to the idea of passing her life within its gloomy walls. > Thus, while Angelo hushed, without appor-ing his conscience, in the re¬ flection that he was faithfully perform¬ ing his promise to the departed Ga¬ brielle in seeking their children, while he exulted in the idea of having dis¬ covered 'ohe, and how her spirit, could it look down, would bless him, he did not, or would not think, what must have been her feelings had she still lived,or what if from her sainted abode she could ha ve viewed his actions, to behold him forcing his only daughter, in the pride of youth and beauty, into the wretched gloom of a convent !-<-to look into his heart, and behold the un-
worthy feelmgsthat propelled the deed' to punish with unfeeling severity for his own pride's sake (what yet had originated in his own guilt), a crea¬ ture who might still have done him lionour, and who was formed to have be- comeanornamentto society Was this, ah · was this' fulfilling the fond wishes of the tender mother ? was this to cherish and protect the daughter whom Pro¬ vidence had directed to him, that be might atone to her, for his past in¬ justice } that hc might triumph in her, and tint she might prove a so¬ lace to bis age ' was this his atone¬ ment ? Ins giatitude î to despise the mercy he had received, and with sa¬ crilegious pride, hasten to bury her ш the profoundest gloom ' But Angelo examined net so nar¬ rowly the secret r< cesses of bit heart, u ä

During the six months previous tt» the konfirmation of the dereted Ag¬ uei, he visited her -daily.

In court¬ ing the young Agnes they had а double vanity to gratify, the vaniti of hav¬ ing made a Convert to their holy or¬ li 3

had submitted, Angelo returned home from the eventful ceremony, whjch had raised an insurmountable barrier between her and the world, and learn¬ ed that a stranger had been extraor¬ dinarily solicitous to see him, during his absence, Angelo gave orders that when next he came, he should be admitted, and retired to his room. In less than an hour he was inform¬ ed that the stranger had returned, and was waiting anxiously to see him. Angelo repaired to the apartmeul where his visitor had been introduced; he beheld a stranger clad in deep mourning, young and of an elegaut interesting appearance, who to his polite request to be favoured with his name, appeared from agitation in¬ capable of reply.

There was an expression of mournful wildness in the eyes of Darlowitz as be uttered these words, that softened even the heart of Angelo ; conscience brought for an instant before his eyes the croud- ed mirror of his past life—did it become Mmtobetbiu rigidlyscvere? He paused, then answered, " Well,-------- weih I agree to your request ; you shall, since. you wish it, convince yourself of the truth of what so idly you appear to doubt; but it must be upon certain conditions," ,, ,

Instantly she obeyed the summons, and drawing near the grate, putthrough her hand for her father. At sightof thatlovely countenance евг veloped in a sable veil, as the fair moo» dimly appears through a gloomy cloud, its beauty shaded, but not concealed,— at sight of that well known hand thrust through the iron bars of her prison—at
light of that delicate form, immured in an eternal captivity,the miserable Darlo¬ witz forgotm an instant his promile! his resolution,his disguise ! he rushed towards the grate, uttering a loed cry, and no longer master of himlelf, be seized the hand intended for her father, and co¬ vered it with kisses and with tears ! "(Oh ! Ida, Ida ! my beloved !" he ex- elaimed in a voice of piercing anguish, 'i is it thus that I behold thee?—thou who mightest have been my wife, whom on the wings of unbridled hope I flew to make for ever mine!" But who can describe the emotion of Agness on recognizing her lover *· She uttered a shriek of despair, and would have fallen to the earth had she not caught the bars of the grate ; while An¬ gelo, fired with uncontrollable rage at the frantic imprudence of Darlowitz,
and his infringement of his promise, seized him with violence by the arm, and exclaimed, " Villam' unworthy vil¬ lain ! you have forfeited your honour '— Unhand my daughter instantly, or dread my vengeance ' ' " I despise your threats' I depise your vengeance'* answered Darlowitz "in¬ human father ' thus to have precipitated your child into the abode of eternal mi¬ sery '" " Wretch ' is it for you, who have destroyed her, to talk thus ' ' raved An¬ gelo in fury, and half drawing forth his stiletto.

Arriveo in Rome, Angelo awaited there only till hc might receive some intelli- gencefrom his friend,whew he determined to lose no time in embarking immediate¬ ly for France, passing through Paris, which he desired once more to revisit, and thence proceeding immediately to England. Mean time he remained for two days in the utmost privacy, when he receiv¬ ed tbe anxiously expected letter from Verospi, which informed him, of what he had not before entertained a doubt. that the ill-starred Darlowitz had ex-

pired oh" the spot ; that the convent wai in the utmost horror and confusion at •uch an outrage having been committed within their precincts ; that nevertheless they desired for their own sakes to ren¬ der the affair as little public as possible ; and Verospi added, that for the sake of Agnes it would be expedient to make some delicate compensation to their house in the form of a magnificent offering. Heconcluded thus: "Happily wedisco- vercd that the rash Steinhaussen did not come entirely alone to this country, he was accompanied by anintimate ftiend,to whom we had the mclancholytask of com¬ mitting his lifeless body.

observations contained in this letter, il conveyed to the heart of Augelo a balm more consolatory than the intelli¬ gence it gave inflicted pam He was happy to find that another, and one of whom he had an high opinion, would have acted as he had done, and this re¬ flection abated the remorse which he had felt, and helped to reconcile lum to himself Thus is error disseminated and siţch is the language man holds to man their mistaken ideas of honour lead them readily to excuse in others that which ou similar false and destructive principici, they would feel uo remorse ш being guilty of themselies At the shrine of barbarous custom, the happi ness and Ines of individuals are daily immolated, society becomes ш coiisc- rot, it ι
quenco more corrupt, and the aggregate of human misery increased ! ' Agreeably to the advice of his friend, Angelo departed from Rome, fitst how¬ ever thanking him for the valuable letter he had sent him,which hedecláredtobave lightened his soul of half its oppression ; then stating to him hia intended move¬ ments, observed that hc ¿hould make'no stay till he arrived at Paris, where he hoped to find a letter waiting for him, informing him of the welfará of hi« daughter, respecting whom he entreated him to enquire daily. " · In j'ustice to Angelo, however, beit said, that though he decided to visit Paris before his return to England, it was not so much to diversify the scene, as his friend expressed it, as to gratify
the earnest desire he felt, of learning, pcihaps through the medium of the in¬ famous Milborough, (if still she con¬ tinued to reside there ) some intelligence oflus son, whom fondly he endeavour¬ ed to hope might either have returned to her, 01 given her some mfoi mation of himself. He embarked accordingly at Civita Vecchia, landed at Toulon, pursued his Way through France without relaxing his speed, and stopping only to take necessary rest till he arrived at Pans, when allowing himself only a few houis of repose, unable to controul his natural impetuosity, he hastened to the abode of the Marquis St Evremond, chusing rather to enquire first of him concern¬ ing Milborough, ere he sought an inter¬ view with that detested female, ι %
Happily for his impatience, he found St Evremond at home, and passing hastily over customary salutations, re¬ verted to the principal occasion of bis л ısıt "Oh, that Englishwoman 1 " replied St Evremond, seeming suddenly to re¬ member whom he meant—" Ah '—she has long ceased to glitter a star in our hemisphere '" " Know you then whither she is gone > hastily demanded Angelo, uu- abic to relish gaiety at tlus moment. " Would you know ?" answered fhe Marquis laughing—*' she has retired to one of our petit maisons ' " "How 1 " exclaimed Angelo, "ıhı was not mad '"
" Not certainly when l lud the plca- mre of introducing you to her, ' ıeplıed St Evremoud, with the utmost noncha¬ lance , " though I think she gave some symptoms of derangement that night, but shortly after, it was conceived that an abode of that nature was most proper for her " " Do not trifle with me, I beseech you'" exclaimed Angelo, "butıfyou are really serious, be more explicit in your information. ' " Well, you must know then resumed the Marquis, " that after that lneinoi- able night, when there appeared fo be some secret between you, which neither I nor any one else could falhom, w htthc r the company began to entertain certain suspicions detrimental to her character or w hethcr they began to bevvearj of her, i3
f cannot pretend fo determine, but she was shortly forsaken by tlie whole ofthe. ¿ray world, and absolutely shunned by. the better part. But mark me, Count; I do not wish to paj my nation the com¬ pliment of possessing eifher much deli¬ cacy or much discrimination ; if they ι an obtain amusement, they are not fas¬ tidious about the means ; I simply sup¬ pose, that as they are fond of novelty, and as after one visit to la belle Angloise/ you saw- as much of her as you could iuíwenty, they grew literally tired'of her, and tlierefore it became the fa¬ shion to forsake her, and a crime in the court of our arbitrary goddess, after once she had decreed this, to notice her. " Yon know, fashion here is omni¬ potent: one of our first rates gave the word, looked cool on her, shrugged her shoulders, and remained silent
when she was praised. The infection instantly caught, it spread like wild- Cue ; to be seen with her became a barbarism, aud going into her house was sufficient to exclude jou for a week from every other.—La belle An¬ gloise was in conséquence deserted by every creature here ; she· was considered ai no longer in the world, and might as well have resided among the sandy deserts of Arabia. What must she do in this dilemma ? she applied to a never failing but treacherous friend, aue whose potent influence exhilarat¬ ed as it led to the grave, ai¡d whose aid, report loudly proclaimed, she hud ever had recouise to. She permitted herself to be conquered by this sub¬ tle soother, its ardent fires mouutcijl to her brain, aud produced there ait 4 .' inflammation so violent as fo bring on raving delirium, which ultimately ι +
ended in a total privation of rea¬ son. " Aircrfaincd to be absolutely in a »fate of madness, it was deemed ne¬ cessary for the present to confine her ш one of our petit maisons, from whence however, should she not shortly recover, of which not the smallest hopes are entertained, it is intended to remove her to the BicÊtre, the hos¬ pital for lunatics, and incurables, as' it is proved that she has no resource» in fhis country, and draws none from any other. Before her absolute de- riuigement, finding herself suddenly so isolated, she surprised me one morn¬ ing at my lodgings, and after reproach¬ ing me with her best powers of rhe¬ toric, preremptorily asked mc, for what cause I had abandoned her.— \\ hat could I reply ? I lamented her
situation, but fashion, our goddess of reason, w ould not pci mit me to break through her rut« s — This I hinted to her, she raved wilh fury, I bowed, and left her my apartment The Marquis concluded , he had re¬ lated her story with a smile upon his countenance, he had not paid even the tribute of a moment s seriousness to her dreadful state ' Seen with con¬ tempt, she was remembered with indif¬ ference—in her best days, she had ex¬ cited no interest, in lier misfortunes no pity Such is ever the fate of the female, who, by excelling in infamy alone, ob¬ tains the short lived triumph of a mo¬ ment, despised even by the ephemeral beings she attracts, or execrated by í ä
those her false glitter ma) have un¬ happily misled. Angelo heard the relation which baf¬ fled his hopes without a scntiment of regret, but on that account. He felt no surprise that a dreadful habit, by which he knew her formerly distin» guished, should have grown upon her in tbe degree, and been resorted to in the shocking excess described by St. Evremond. Well he knew thit the wretched Milborough possessed nor mind nor soul : transferred by her vile arts from a menial situation to one of splendour, and then again justly sunk into worse than pristine degradation, her weak reason was not adequate to ■upportthechange, nor the tormenting reflections that assailed her. Destitute
of every merit, she was no longer young nor even attractive, who would be the consoling fiiend, who would sympa¬ thise with a female like her, and reduced to hei situation ? The result then was obvious, and that which could banish reflection, blind hci to the present, and diyest her of care for the futuje, was the only resource to which she could eagerly fly Yet he formed а wish to behold her, not because he felt the remotest inte¬ rest lor her, but perhaps she was not so mad as St Eviemond represented— perhaps she mi^ht know him '—per¬ haps, biought by her situation to a sense of hei crimes, she might expe¬ rience remorse, and inform hnn if she knew aught respecting his son These ideas passed rapidly through his mind ; he leaked at St Evremond, and ex-
claimed, " Marquis, cannot I iee the hapless wretch ?" The Marquis burst into a laugh. " What ! have you not seen enough of her, Count ?—pardon me, but I thought you had !—you can see her, certainly ;"' when perceiving Angelo look grave,' he added, " I will even accompany you, if yon please ; but I absolutely confess to you, though I would not, have it breathed, that I paid ber a visit a week ago, which wa» lost on ber liowcver, as she did not know юе." ι " Well then, you can go with me at once," cried Angelo. . " When I have dined," answered St. •. Evremond, ? ' it will be too late—in the evening I am engaged,—if you will an-
company me whither I am going, I pro¬ mise to attend you to-morrow moinmg on your philanthropic expedition to the fair insensible " To this proposition Angelo with reluctance acceded, he dined with his gay companion, and could not se¬ parate from him till a late hour of the night. On the following morning, agreeably to his promise, the Marquis agreed to accompany Angelo to the wretched abode vihere he believed Milborough at present was When they arrived, they were informed that she had been removed three days ago- to the Bicêfre, as incurable Atthisintelligence,Sf Evremond shrug¬ ging bis shoulders exclaimed, " Pauvre
diable ! We have nothing to do but to return then," he added, addressing An¬ gelo; yet at hisearnest entreaty at length consented to accompany him to this re¬ ceptacle for loet humanity, the abode of tlie most terrible woe ! though not with¬ out complainingofthewasteoftimewhich might be so much more agreeably »peut.- When they reached the Bicêtre they inquired concerning Milborough, but were anewcred, tliat no one could be per¬ mitted to visit her, as she was in a state that rendered it improper for her to be seen. By dint of high bribery however they were secretly admitted. The in¬ stant they were within the walls the most terrible, and varied din assailed their shrinking sense ; mournful cries ! terrific shrieks ! lengthened moans ! and echoing peals of laughter, as if in mockery I As they passed along the va-
nous doors, here the loud discordant song attracted pity fiom the hardest heart ' there the wild unconscious solitary whispered aloud bis seeiet of fancied importance ' here the lover reproached in bombastic strain bis mistress who was not by ' and there her who had been forsaken, implored the compassion of him who heard lier not, and who had, long smce forgot that he had evei known her '—Oh ' human nature ' to what an abyss of woe art thou reduced, when the fine chords of the mind are en¬ tangled in confusion, or disorganised by madness—Oh ' most pitiable of calami¬ ties ' with which mysterious Providence permits his creatures to be afflicted I— Oh ' man ' aiftot art thou, when such becomes thy state ι— At length they reached the ipot where the miserable Milborough was confined.
Here the sight which met the eyes of Angelo, whose nerves weie less rigid than those ofthe Frenchman, was almost more than, with all his just abhorrence of her, he could endure Sitting half naked on some straw, secured round tbe waist by a massy iron chain to a ring in the wall raved in wild¬ est madness the insensate Milboiough * The garments that partly covered her, ( for in her paroxysms she had torn them almost to tatters) exposed to view that wretched person, bearing evident marks of the treatment she had necessarily re¬ ceived Her hair fell around her in wild disorder, her starting eyes rolled rapid¬ ly in their sockets, her cheek was hag¬ gard and pale, and in hei whole aspect there was an expression of savage fierce¬ ness, that shocked rather than interested the beholder.
When Angelo first entered, she was heaping straw upon her head, but on obstivuig him she suddenly sprang up, and Whether or not she for an instant re¬ cognised hnn, the most dreadful fuiy took possession of her, and she made nn attempt to rush towards him ' Failing of course, from the confinement of her chain, she uttered a fearful yell, clapped her hands together repeatedly, and burst¬ ing into α loud discordant laugh, which echoed through the terrible abode, and, seemed multiplied by a thousand others, she leaped and danced with antic move¬ ment, and struggled to escape, till, ex¬ hausted by a violence that the strength of madness alone could give, she sunk exhausted down Unable to endure a repetition of this hornille scene, and finding it vain to expect aught like reason (in which
hope alone he had visited her) ftom a wretch so lost, he precipitately left-tilt spot, resigning to a fute dreadful, yet justly merited, her who had barbed the keenest arrow for lhe heart of Gabrielle, the envenomed poison of which had festered there, and sapped the source of life ! Her who had reuderoddum de¬ testable in bis own eyes, and who bad' filled his breast with remocsejleîicited a: feeling of melancholy, but no companion fbr her state, io the breast of Angolo, il ,-. Men love not tbe remembrance of their crimes ; firm friendship! ean be never founded on the basi« of guilt ; hence tbe wicked have no sympathy for each other in the hour of adversity. The remembrance of a good action per¬ formed together by tbe virtuous, diffus¬ ing a feeling of complacency over their eouls, may draw them resistlessly
towards each other, even after year* of variance or disunion ; but the guilty fly from those who remind them of their sins, and lmte those who weie the part¬ ners of their guilt, ¡ As Angelo ïeturned home, he itiquirud at the post-ofiice if any letters had ar¬ rived fbr him from Italys one-was put iota bis hands, which by the feuponenp- tion ketsaw was from Ver ttspi;, 'behasti¬ ly itone ihr nea), too impatient- te wait) for its perusal till he reached his lodg¬ ings. It contained however but few lines, and those of little import save what re¬ garded Agnes, of whom Angelo, with a pang of remorse, read, that although her delirium had left her, it had been succeeded by a melancholy, so settled and profound, as to give some colour for
apprehension that it would ultimately become rooted. " She seldom," added Verospi, "an¬ swers when addressed, or if she does, wholly from the subject, never of her¬ self addressing any one, Her air is mournful, solemn, abstracted ; in person the is considerably reduced, her cheek is paler than death, and though in general the expresiion of her countenance it that of piteoui resignation, if I may 'bé allowed the idea, I have sometimes seen a wildness in it that has excited in mc some alarm lest her intellects should be incurably deranged. But these, I trust, are only the fears of one interested in your welfare, and hers ; all will yield to time ; be assured they are but latent ef¬ fects of certain occurrences, the remem¬ brance of which have not yet ceased to haunt her imagination. But that you
forced a promise ftom me at parting, to inform you punctually respecting her, I •hould not have enlarged so much upon a subject which I fear you will dwell on too deeply ' Notwithstanding the endeavours of his friend to treat lightly the situa¬ tion of Agnes the vivid imagination of Angelo beheld her already stretched upon the bed of death, or, thought far more horrible ' perhaps in a state resembling that of the wretched bemg he bad just quitted " But no ' no," he cried, remembering the gentle sweet¬ ness of Agnes, " so fair a mmd can never be possessed by the infuriate dæmons of despair or madness like that I have beheld, appropriate only to the ever stormy soul and the degene¬ rate mind of a Milborough' Agnes may sink to the grave, weighed down
by insupportable woe, but she will die like an angel, and the pure soul quitting her body without a struggle, ¡willexr cite no horror in its flight !" His first impulse was to return im¬ mediately to Italy, but the refiection of his son, of whose fate he. was in utter ignorance, prevented him from yield¬ ing to it. Besides, his return, so far from rendering the smallest benefit to bis daughter, would revive in hei mind, with a force that might prove fatal, events that the power of time might perhaps obliterate; a remote idea too of the inconvenience, if not danger, which might probably still await him there, operated completely to deter him. To remain longer in Paris, Was now however unnecessary ; he therefore
wrote to Verospi lnforminghunof his me¬ ditated departure, desn ing that he might address bis next to him in England, most earnestly entreating that he would continue to pay Agnes every attention, to conceal nothing ftom him lespect¬ mg hei, and concluded by a request that he would lose no time in pre¬ senting to the convent in his name a sumptuous golden censer with massy chains, and a diamond cross for the bosom of the Virgin This done, and having from the shortness of his stay nothing material to arrange, he early on the following morning quitted Pans, and with despondmg mmd em¬ barked for England
CHAPTER XXXI.
•»e pass over a period of several months during which Angelo w as inde¬ fatigable in his search, and incessant in his endeavours to discover his son To gain even the remotest intelli¬ gence of him, he left no means un¬ tried, he ransacked town and country, and oflered the most considerable re¬ wards to whomsoever could give even the smallest trace of hnn All proved vain, and Angelo was «t length compelled to admit the idea that he could not be m England, per haps not even in Europe, to large a
part of which he had already travers¬ ed, but rather that in some rash mo¬ mentary impulse, he had either trust¬ ed his life to the waves, or seeking death in the field of battle, had pe¬ rished in another part of the globe. Ah' erring father, happy thou, had such been the destiny of thy son. From Verospi he had heard more than once since his residence in Eng¬ land ; the unfortunate Agnes sttll re¬ mained ln'the same hopeless state, ren¬ dered still more hopeless ftom its long continuance , and as the terrible ides pressed heavily on his mind, that ere long he might lose a daughter, it re¬ doubled his longing anxiety to recover a son. One evening, towards the close of summer, Angelo, аз was fiequently hig vol iv. »,
custom, rode towards the country ; gra¬ dually his mmd became absorbed in the reflection of the past, this offered »niy painful images, and lie reverled to his «on, his present probable si¬ tuation , the ideabrougbt with it others, «till more painful, and deeply musing he unconsciously resigned the rems to his horse, indifferent what path he pur- ened Thus for some time he wandered on, when his hone slightly stumbling, aroused lum to the recollection of the present, and he observed that it was nearly dark, and that he was entering asoht uv path, unarmed and unaccom¬ panied checking the animal therefore, he thought of returning homewards, but scarcely had he retraced three paces of the way, than he beheld a person spring from an adjoining thicket,
who galloping swiftly towards lum, immediately on reaching Inm seized his horse's bridle, and piesenting a pis¬ tol to his bieast, exci umed m a smo¬ thered voice—" Your gold instantly, or you die '" Angelo, becoming sensible of his im¬ prudence, perceived that lie had en¬ countered a highwayman he was masked, but his figure, w Inch was un¬ disguised, resembled not that of a vulgar ruffian, wealing on the contrary an appearance of jouth and elegance, which caused Angelo to consider with surpnse a conduct so inconsistent with it Unarmed howevei, a weapon at his bosom threatening instant death, the present was no tunc for resistance or remonstrance, or for an exertion of «outage hazardous as lain Calmly therefore complying with the request & ä
of his assailant, he gave into his hands all he possessed about him, and then could not avoid observing—" You ap¬ pear but young, my friend, and your profession is a dangerous one." " True," answered the robber in a low voice, " but we can nieet death only once, and how soon ΐ encounter it I care not !" so saying he slightly bowed, and, N ' darted away with inconceivable ve-, f locity. ,^,·, Angelo pursued hiin wilh. huieyefàs' far as the daikness would permit j he could not reconcile his profession with 3 his appearance, anil though he had re¬ ceived convincing proof that whatever, he might think, they were not incompa¬ tible, he felt pity for one whom nature seemed so little to have fitted for a couisc so desperate, and so degrading.
Indulging these ideas as ho proceeded onwards, he perceived two шеи on horseback, rapidly advancing whom fiom then an, however, he dul not ima¬ gine to be appioaclung with hostile in¬ tent One of theuiiespeetfully accost¬ ing Angelo, аь he diew near, inquucd if he had been 011 O.e Ь ----------road. " I have," returned Angelo, surprised at the question, "for what purpose do you ask? ' " Pardon me, ' replied the man, *' but have you been attacked ? ' " I have,' answered \11gclo, " and robbed , now supposing Unit Un ir en¬ quiries originated only in mol.ies of personal safely " Aud hew ho robbed \ou, added the к J

fied with himself thit lu should beau iiivoliiiitarv means of depriving a human eicatuie of existence, and moie parti¬ cularly one m whose unfoitunate fate he telt some interest, he jet secretly hoped th it he would be able to elude Ins pur¬ suers and when he remembered the spnit of the animal on which he was mom ft d he fiatteicd himself this hope was not inational Some few days after tins adventure, vvlith had so unusuallj impi essed the mind of Angelo he accidentally read in α duuiml pin t that the highwayman who 1 ad for somi time piivt mfe«ted the e ----------road liad successively robbed two gentlemen and was supposed to have committed other similar offences, had I cen apprehended and w ıs lodged m prison Whtn \ngelo perused this, involuntarily he felt a sensation of ex-
treme regret, he decided in his mmd that he would be present at hie trial, but give no evidence that would tend to criminate him, for he sufficiently re¬ pented that he had already, as it were, pointed lum out to justice , and rather than have uttered a syllable to endanger his hfe he would have ìejoiccd in an op¬ portunity to preserve it. The day of the tual at length arrived, Angelo had intended to have been pi e- sent from the commencement, but un¬ foreseen circumstances prevented hnn, and when hc arrived, he learned that tlie trial was over, that the prisoner was coming out of court, and that he was condemned to suffer death Powerfully aflccted, yet anxious to obtain at least a glimpse oflus countenance, he pressed eagerly through the croud, and by bis exertions approached sufficiently near «.5
to have a view of the person of the prisoner.—But oh, what language can deseribe his horror Î— bis despair !"—bis» madnessat that view ! ------it was Ms hn that he beheld! Uttermg a loud; frantic ery, he rushed with the strengthofamaniacbacttthrough the crowd.—Could a whole life of future- happiness,( if »uchwere possible ) blot out a momenfflike tire present ! The wretch¬ ed Angelo· felt it could not :—his resOi- lutïon wa* tafeen ;—h^ gained his house- in a state· of frenzy ; and securing himself in his apartment took his pistols from, his- cabinet, loaded and placed them on the table before him ;:—then gazing" rngerľy upon them.lie seized one/ and pointed it io- his burning temple !— another initant, and death would bury in. internal oblivion his shame, bis anguish, hi» remorse ! Suddenly a thought darted! through hie brain; hit hand, nerved with
the wild fury of despair, trembled and relaxed its hold of tlie instrument of death , he withdrew it from his head, paused, placed it on the table again, and exclaimed—" No, I must uot quit the world thus, I must first perform some sacred duties, and eie I sleep for ever, must behold my boy ' ' For a moment he seated himself to collect his tumultuous thoughts, then starting up, added, " it shall be so "— Quitting his apartment beendeavourcd to appear calm, to betray no extraordi¬ nary emotion to superficial observers, be succeeded, and seemed sufficiently composed to escape lemaik. His firit step was to make his will, which he caused to be regularly attested, speaking of it merely as a matter of propnety, and appearing perfectly ra-
tional and tranquil —All he possessed he bequeathed to Agnes, or lu case of her death, («bieli wiíhaii inward pang he consideri d might already be,) one half to Verospi, the other to the convent He tben addressed Verospi by letter, mfoi mıng hım of what he had done, ■mil, without touching on the dreadful events which had ind need this step, (for inthe midst of the most terimle degıa- tUtuiu even on tlu verge ol the grave, lus f rid was lnsunnountablc,) stated r imply as tie caust, his cornicioni tint he should not long survive In this letter b~ collosi d one to Agues, tendeily affectionate, dcsiuug ol lum, if she was restored to io ison, th it it might be given her, praying of her to forgive hun for having destioycd hci happiness, which but für hım might have been perfected, and to ei deavour to live, that his souL
might not be burthened with the ad¬ ditional crime of having precipitated her to an early grave '—to remember him with tender pity in hei orisons, and to pray for the repose of his spi¬ rit. Tlieme arrangements employed the remainder of the day, and a part of the night , the intermediate hours ere he could behold his son, he duist not pass in reflection. He sought to banish thought by motion, and walked rapidly to and fro m his chamber, yet now paus¬ ing inv oluntnrilj in feai ful meditation, now starting in horror at the appalling images that would present themselves befoie him Morning at length arrived; he stole from his house and wandered about, till the period when he might be permitted to enter the prison, which con¬ tained (distracting thought') his only
son l The hour at length arrived ; he- piesented himself at the gate, received admittance, and was conducted to the door of his cell By dmt of entreaty, and tbe more powerful eloquence of gold, he obtained what with half his fortune he would have purchased, the permission to remain for a short tune alone with the pusoner. Scarce could he support his trembling frame, while the dreadful door unlocked and grated on its lunges,—hc entered , —Oh 1 tiemendous God'—could it in¬ deed bc ?—that fondly, too fatally loved boy,—his cherished foim, still rich ш youthful beauty, weighed down, degrad¬ ed by the massive emblems of the vilest guilt '—that fair countenance, round which waved bright auburn ringlets, so often dwelt on with delight, did he be¬ hold it ш the gloom of a dungeon '— hi»

The vrords of Felix seemed to
excite in the breast of Angelo a de*- pcrate fortitude ; he sprang from the earth, gazed upon him with a look of frightful calmness, and cried, " Let me hear all, while I have yet the pow¬ er , I would know your thoughts,—why has life been long oppressive to you ? —say, by what inconceivable and dieadful fatality do I behold you thus ?" " Oh ' my father ' " exclaimed the youth, bursting into tears, and throw¬ ing himself upon the bosom of the despairing Angelo—" let us—let us not retrace the past—but exchangc'iautu»! forgiveness " Angelo wept not, the muscles of his countenance were convulsed with migh¬ ty horror, and alone betrayed the tre¬ mendous workings of his soul — 'J Felix," said he at length, in a deep
hollow voice, " I implore you to an¬ en er me ' " Oh spare mc ' spare me , ' cried the youth, " my father, »paie your¬ self' "Ivo, answered Angelo, with a half suppressed groan, " I will not »pare myself '—say then, am I, am I the cause ?—nay then, I command,—I entreat—." " Wherefore, wherefore," cried Felix clasping his hands in agony, " would you drag from me--------" "Proceed, proceed 1 " wildly inter¬ rupted Angelo " Oh · why Mns I taught to hate the best of mothers ?

ately exci nmed the youth, " to con¬ temn her virtuous maxims, to repay with abhorience, and scorn, her in¬ structions f Why did I behold my father prefer to hei the most aban¬ doned of her sex '—lhat fatal con¬ nexion was the origin of all my crimes, it perfected my ruin '—She, de«' mg demon, gloried to sow ш mj the seeds of early vice, taught me that I owed to шу paient« nor filial love nor gratitude, and alienated my affec¬ tions from them to herself—She was my mother,myadviser, ray fnend.she had over meimplicitsway,—did I not fly with her from the house of my father ? did I not participate------must I go on ?—you will not bid me be silent,—yet I cannot, no I cannot retrace my num¬ berless progressive crimes, each, each more dreadful than the other-----— —————at length I—I—"
" Enough ι enough ·" cried Angelo in gloomy voice, " I can imagine the gra¬ dations from crime to crime—I have tra¬ ced you before—I learned, but no mat¬ ter "—He paused ,—from the look of tranquil horror Ins countenance assumed an expression of the vv lldest fienzy, and he exclaimed, seizing the arm of his ion, " Unliappy boy '—kneel, kneel, and curse your fathei '—it is not enough that hn vices have been the origin of all your crimes '—but he hai placed you here ' he delivered you into the hands of your pur¬ suers'" With a terrible smile as he concluded, be gazed upon his son, for his brain was whirling with mad¬ ness and despair " What do I hear ?" cried the youth —" my father my accuser '·■· ■ ■ you ' '
" Yes, yes, I!—you attacked me—if was fated that your father should be¬ come your murderer ;—I experienced certain sensations for you indeed,— but I disregarded them, for I am a monster !" Intense horror had taken possession of the youth, his blood froze in his veins, his limbs shook !—Sinking on his knees he raised his eyes to heaven, with an expression so like his sainted mother's that the heart of Angelo bound¬ ed with agony—"Oh, God !" he cried, " merciful God, I thank thee ' that at thy bar, where speedily I must appear, I have not to answer for the murder of my father !" Then in the deep grati¬ tude and humility of his penitent soul, he kissed the ground, and approaching his father, seized his hand, and bedewed U w ith his tears.
" But thy father," cried Angelo in torture inexpressible, " will have thy blood upon his head'" and throwing himself on his knees beside his son, " ľelix," he exclaimed, " canst thou cmbiaec thy mui derer ? ' " Oh ' my father," cried Felix, endea¬ voui nig to strain lum to his breast, " my deal father, may you live long and happy yet ere jou leave your guilty son, assure limi of j our forgiveness for having biought on jou indelible disho¬ nour—for weighing j ou lo the gì ave in shame and sorrow ' ' " Cease, cease, my boy," exclaimed the frantic fathei, " this is too much — Oh God ' my heart.my brain,willbuist* —have I no tears 2 —no ' I cannot weep, iny heart has turned to stone ' Felix, did vou wish me life ?—no, no, believe it not,

throne of mercy, ho ping that the dread¬ ful punishment awarded in this world might save from eternal condemnation m the next' At this moment when the past seem¬ ed but a crowd of gloomy visions, when the present receded from their view, and the dread futuie alone en¬ gaged their hearts and thoughts,—the door opened, and awakened them ftom their profound abstraction from earth. —Roth arose, for no vulgar witness might profane the sacrednees of their sensations—but the blest illusion was at an end, and they were recalled to earth Angelo incapable of convening with, or even gazing on his son, at this awful juncture, in the presence of another human being, hastily cried,
" Farewell, my Felix, ' and moved to¬ waids the door " Oh, my father ' cried the youth dissolving again into mortal weak¬ ness, " shall Ino more behold y ou r ' Angelo drew near his son, took his hand, piessed it convulsively to his heart, and murmured— ' Hope, my boy '—oh, endeavour to hope that we may meet hereaftei ' —then added— "arm thyself with couiage, give thy soul to God,—implore him to receive it, and pardon the errors of fhy youth --------------- My peace will be more difficult to mike '—One last embrace—now then farewell— -foi evei ι ' Their arms eutwmed, their throbbing hearts met, and beat in tremendous agony

circle of domestic felicity, it gave an additional throb of agony to the pre¬ sent moment, by the hopeless con- tiast that it oflered " Oh God ' he cried, ' have I then arrived so far '— the hour of release draws near —He rose and drew toward the window, his hands uplifted, and his eyes gazing on the mov røg clouds that gave birth to ideas in his mmd, which human reason could not pursue, and the scul trembled, and feared to identify ' The beams of the sun now burst forth, and a stream of radiance en¬ tered his chamber —" Oh, glorious iun'" he exclaimed—" once again I have beheld thec—but never shall I more—My lelix—my unhappy boy—■ at this time thou canst not behold it, —but thoììt *vrilt, once again-----Oh ' horrible idea ·—I cannot stay—the thought of thee at that fearful mo¬ ment would unnetvo my hand '—it

To outrage the sacred in— '- stitution, entails misery .and ruin upon ■'■ımuorıı myriads, sinks and loses İh labyrinthian confusion every tie of con¬ sanguinity, causes an unknown offspring to wander through the world unclaim¬ ed, and plunges them iu а vortex of misfortune aud crime. The momentous subject furnishes mat¬ ter for the lessons of the moralist, the contemplation of the sage, and the com¬ mentaries of the philosopher. Some of the fatal consequences attendant on the disregard of α system so glorious, rational and indispensable, it has been the objet f of the preceding work, conscientiously, it is hoped not vainly to pourtray.

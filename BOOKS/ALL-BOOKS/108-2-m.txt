fallen upon life There ıs no telling the freshness and novelty of my joy on the possession of this long-withheld resource, which 1 wondered I had ever thrown aside in neglect, or in vacancy or in caprice , which I wondered any one could believe himself unhsppy, that was permuted to possess which, above all, I wondered I had never felt the full value of nil that moment During the hour lhat the monk delayed, I was too happy to glance at the probability of disappointment I experienced a thousand glad and busy feelings. With the benevolence of joy I wished I could communicate my frame of mind to the loungers vho yawn ov er untasled libraries, to those whose eyes wander over a book, without a conscious¬ ness of their contents. To me, my ap proaching employment seemed inex- huutable, 1 remembered the time, «ben I repined if I had not several books te make a selection from, but now, оле appeared
appeared sufficient for the occupation of the whole day I can pause, said I, over every sentence, and though its meaning be nothing new, or peculiar, to think on it will waken some corresponding train of thought within me, I shall arrive at some discovery, some new combination, orresemblance in objects unnoticed before, at least, the pursuit will amuse me I shall be intently, delight¬ fully employed, and when I turn from my excursion of thought, to see 1 have yet so many pages to read, yet such (strong aid lo interpose between me and lhe. feel¬ ings of solitude, and the hour of darkness. 1 hough reading had never been attended with such consequences still mg^ftrcep· tions were so new, that I wa» confident I would enjov all this and more on Ihe pos session of this new treasure and I deter¬ mined to husband my store with judicious economy, not to suffer my eye to wander over a single pige carelessly I determin¬ ed
ed to paute and to reflect, lo taste and to digest with epicurean slowness I almost wished my powers of intelligence wtie slower, that I might be compelled to ad¬ mit more tardily, and to retain longer At length, it came—the treasure—a sin¬ gle book—it was a library to me , I scarce¬ ly waited to thank my grim attendant I opened the book, and the delusion va nished So vehement wis my littrary ap¬ petite, and so long had been my funnit· that I could no more restrain it, thin the flow of a torrent, I hurried at once into the middle ofmy scanty repast, and found myself nearly half through it, before the execution of my deliberate plan would have permitted me to travel ov er a pige When all was finished, (early in the day) I reflected I had yet lo read it over i^ain , and I began again, but soon found that my pleasure was diminished, even beyond the power of repetition to diminish it, Ibe uneasiness ofa task was over ne, I felt

When the castle bell tolled twelve, I listened with a momentary re¬ lief to the echoes, to the long deep echoes sa they died away, the v ery recesses of' my chamber seemed to answer them, and as they rolled off, I seemed to feel them spreading above, below, around, I listen¬ ed to them, till my own fancy filled up the pause of sound Would lhat it had never left my ears At that moment, a voice, in strong, distinct human sounds, shrieked, murder.murder, murder 1 thrice, so near, that
that it seemed to шие from the very wsll be¬ side me I cannot tell you the effect of tha cry, whatever disposition I might have felt to assist the sufferer, to shout aloud in a voice of encouragement, to lament my confine¬ ment, and to tell them a human being who heard and pitied them, was so near, was al Irepelled by a sudden and inexpress¬ ible conviction, that the sounds I heard were not uttered by man Whence this arose I could not explain, I could not examine, it would not be resisted, it would not be removed It chained me up in silence, I could neither communi- cite, nor inquire into it I could not even speak to my warden about it, 1 felt all day like a man, upon whose peace some secret is preying I looked in deep op¬ pression around me, on the walls and win¬ dows, and dark corners ofmy room, as if they possessed a consciousness of what they had heard, as if they could pour out and unfold the terrible sounds they had swallowed
swallowed In the midst of this dejection I recollected my book, I took it up, and with diligence that deserved a better re¬ ward, I read every syllable of it again, and paused over the very expletives with a superstitious minuteness, that made me smile when I discovered it But it would not do All power of feeling pleasure had ceased I »a, like the vulvar who when they are affected with any milady, complain that it is lttlgetl in the heırt all lhe attention I lould bestow still left a dull sense of inward uneasiness, whith 1 could not remove, antl feared even to advert to But long before night, 1 h ul finished even my book, sull I was le- solved not to be " tormented befoie the time," I resolved by every or any act of exclusion, to keep the idea ol what I h ed heard away, till midnight, till I could keep it away no longer Oh, jou have never known the sickly strivings of soli¬ tude ' to dispose my scanty furniture in a thousand
a thousand shapes, the most di.tinct fron use that can be conceived, to endeavour to walk up and down the room, confining my steps to one seam m the flooring, and when they tottered from Us narrowness, to look behind, lest some strange hand was pushing me from mj way, to trace the winding vems in the old wainscot, that amused and pained me with a re¬ semblance to the branching of trees and shrubs, to follow them where they could be seen, and feel them where they could not—these were the wretched resources of a situation that demands variety, yet deprives the spirits of all power as well as means to exercise it, and these wretch¬ ed resources were a relief in the horrible state ol my mind, nor could even that re- lie I be long enjoyen The hour tame For many minutes I remained silent, gasping, as if I was watching for the sound I dreaded My book was open before me I did not see a word
word in it I felt the slow, yet progres¬ an« motion that brings you nearer an objert of horror I felt my hairs rising up 1 felt my pores open, and Ihc told, creeping consciousness of the thing we cannot nane, spreading over me I heard a hissing ia my ears My eyes were involuntarily distended I felt as if all the dark powers were invisibly, but per¬ ceptibly close to me—ji st preparing to be¬ gin their work—just in the intense silence of preparation The hand ofa little time¬ piece t' at had been brought to me mo ved stilly on Woildswould Ihive civen for a sound when I saw it |ust tout Inni, on the hour The castle bell tolled It wis but a moment, lo I could have bome it no longer and the voice again shrieked murder ' It was il possible more horrible than tlie preceding night there wits more of humam suffering in it —more of tlie voice of a man who feels the fingers of a murderer on his ver) throat
throat, who cries with the strength at agony, stronger than nature, wjio pours all his dying force into the sound that is the last living voice he shall utter Even he who hears such a sound feels not what I did M?n, the actual sight of man, in the most dreadful circumstances m which man can behold or imagine him, is nothing to the bare fear, the suspicion, the doubt, that there is a being near vou not of this woi Id Between us and them there is a great gulph fixed, on the li¬ mits of which to glance or to totter ismore terrible to nature than all corporeal suf¬ ferance Of this misteimus sensation it is impossible to desti ibe the quality or the diproe Its daikness its remote¬ ness itsshapelcssness constitute its power and influence V hethcr my mmd was wearied by its own motions, I do not know, but I soon fell into a deep sleep I know not how I was awakened, but I recollect it was so suddenly and tho¬ roughly
roughly, that I starled up as I awoke, and became sensible in a moment The monk, was sitting opposite me lie sat at the table, on which stood the time piece and the lamp His head rested on his hands, and he watched the time¬ piece m silence My recollection came to me at once, and fully I felt lhat at such an hour, suih a visitor could have but one purpose Oh ' who can tell lhe gush of horror that comes lo lhe heart of the being that, lone and helpless, is wa¬ kened at midnight, and sees around the bard blank walls of his prison, and be¬ side him, the fare of his murderer, pile with unnatural thought, by his dun lamp¬ light I sat up with the impulse, but not the power of resistime 1 ga/ed on him earnestly He neither raised his he^l nor spake 1 was amazed by his sileme It seemed to cast a spell over ine I bad no power to break it I could not speak
speak to him, yet my eyes remained fixed, and my thoughts seemed rapid m proportion о my inability to utter them A thousand causes for his silence were suggested to me He might be waiting the arrival of some assistant, who was to overpower mv struggles, or help to thrust iny corpse into '«line dark remote hole, where no se treh would e\ er follow or find me whtre ibe foot of α brother might Iread over my dust without a sus¬ picion of my fite Perhaps he was a- Weiiting a signal to rush on me , perhips, till same new and humble means of death should be brought in, and admi nistered to nie perhaps — that was the worst of all—some su« h means had al¬ ready been appli 1 in my food, or while I slept and he was come lo wat<Ji its operation, to witness the 'bitterness uf death, the twiMed eye, the wnthing fea¬ ture, the straining jnuscle, without giv¬ ing
mg th· aid which all that retain thr shape of saan alike expect and afford While these thoughts were yet m their height, the hana of the time piece point¬ ed to one The вмяк extended his hand to it—it touched it—ud he raised his head. " Now I may speak," said he, fixing ha large heavy eyes on me My former suspicion recurred. " Then, ' said I, " I shall know my fate Oh > I feel that vou are come to announce it, 1 feel that you are come to murder me " He waved his hand with a melancholy motion I had but one construction for all his rro- tions. ' Speak, ' said I, " I conjure you , your eye is dark, and I fear to read it, or look into it What is your pur¬ pose ?" " Death," said the monk — " Then I am to be murdered, murdered m this dark hole, without a chance, or struggle, or straw to grasp at for life ? Oh ' merciful Heaven, Oh ' ' " What is it
it you fear ' ' said the monk rising — " my business is death, but not yours What do you fear r Look at this hand, years have passed since it held a wea¬ pon , years have passed since blood has flowed in its veins ' I looked at his hand I involuntarily touched it It was deadly cold I was silent, and awaited some ex¬ planation of his appearance or his words " My business is death, a business long; deferred, longun finished Under «Is pres¬ sure I have been called up, and kept wan¬ dering for many years, without hope, and without rest I have had many pilgrimages without companion or fitness no one knew me, or sought my name or purpose But my term is closing, and iny task will soon be finished, for now 1 am permitted io come to you, and speak to you He spoke so slowly that I had Ume to collect myself I marvelled at his strange language " I know not what it ss you mean, nor to what business vou
you allude," said I " If my sense· are not impaired, you are Father Schemoli, the companion of my father " " 1 am," said he, in a peculiar tone, " I am your father's constant companion " " I know you well, you look pale and strange by this dim light, yet I know you But what is the purport of your appearance at this hour, or of the words you have uttered, I know not " " And do you only know me as Father Schemoli : Нате you seen me under no other ap¬ pearance > Do you remember the last time you for me ?" " I remember it well it was in the west tower, you bor» the light, you accompanied my father ; I remember you well ' " Had you ne¬ ver seen me there before ?" " Never ; whatever I suspected, I never saw you there before ' " Beware—beware What spectacle did you behold there, buned and mouldering in one of the passages?" " I saw a terrible sight there, ' said J, shuddering,
ihuddenng, ' but it was removed on my list unlucky visit .o that place " " No, you saw it, though in another form—saw it as plain as you see me now ' " I know not what you mean Your loice thills me, but I do not un¬ derstand vou ' " You will not understand mi , look on my еуст, my features, my limbs," said he, rising, and spreading him¬ self out, " the last time you beheld them, they were fleshless, decayed, and thrust in a noisome nook, yet still the strength of their moulding, and shape, and cha- rattcr, might strike an eye that was less quit k, and gazed not so long ai, yours " As he spoke—was it fancy, or the very witcheiv of the time and place ? —his eyes, his mouth, his nostrils, all the hol¬ lows of Ins face became deeper and darker, as the sickly glare of the lamp fi II on the skin of his shorn head, it looked tense and ν ι How, like the bones of a skull, and the annulations of the large |ointi of voi» n ι his
his up-spread hands, seemed so distinct and bare, as if the flesh had shrunk from them I swallowed down something that seemed to work up my throat, and I tried to resist the effect of his words and ap¬ pearance, for it outraged my belief and my senses to a degree that no local ter¬ rors, no imposition, or fantasy of fear could justify ·' Is this mockery or fren?» ' Is it my ears or eyes you would abuse * If I Understand you, you mean something that could not be imposed on the belief of a child, or of superstition itself \ on would make me believe, lhat j ou, whom I have seen exercise all the functions, whom I have seen going m and out a- mongst us, are a being who has been dead for years—that you now inhabit another form—that the flesh which I felt a mo¬ ment past n not substantial Do you thmk that durance and hardship have de¬ based me to such weakness? Do you believe my mmd cramped and shackled like
like my body > Or, do you believe, even il it were, that mv senses are thus en¬ feebled and destroyed—.that I cannot hear, and see, and feel, and judge of the impressions objects ought to make on those senses as well as if it were not now midnight, and in this dark hold, and by this single dim light J Away ' I am not so enfeebled yet " He heard me calmly " You, who wish to judge only by the evidence of your senses, why do you not consult that of your hearing better * Have you never heard this voice before' and where have you heaid it ? ' Yes, sud I, with that solemnity of feeling which enforces truth from the speaker, " Yes, I leel I have, but whe¬ ther in) perceptions are confused by fear, 01 iny memoiy indistinct, I cannot recai when I hear u like a voice I have heard in a dream, or like those sounds whuh visit us m darkness, and mingle with the, wind, yet I feel also it is not ж t the
the voice with which you speak in the family " I was gazing at him while I spake as if I could find any resemblmce in his face, that could assist me to recai the fonner tones of his voice He fixed him¬ self opposite to me—he turned his eye full on me " What voice, ' said he was that which bore witness to Michelo s fears in the west turret, that your fathers yengeance uas ten ible * What voice pass¬ ed you on the winds of darkness when vou watched at the tomb of Orazio > What voice rung in the ears of the dying man, ' Woe and death, when 5 ou knelt beside his bed? What voice shrieks, * Murder/ every night, from a depth ne¬ ver measured even by the thought of man since these walls were raised > Is it not the voice which speaks to vou now ? His voice had been progressively deepening till its sounds were almost lost, but in the last question it pierced my very sense with
with its loudness His form was outspread, and almost floating in the tbrkness The light only fell on· his hands, that were extended and almost illuminated All Ihe rest was general and undefined obscuntv I was lost in wonder and fear, such as can only be fell by those who suddenly find their secrets in possession of another who find all that they had thought im¬ portant to acquire or to conceal, the sport of another, who sports with it and them " Blessed Virgin ' who are you ? where were you concealed ì how did you follow me ! who uttered these sounds, or if it was you— Ì" " You cai. not admit things that would ontrage the credulity of an infant, or of superstition, you cannot believe that I have assumed other forms than that I now bear, you are prepared with your reasons, and your answers, and your arguments, physical and sage, and able to solve all appearances and objects you may witness " Uepumieddensively— "You

Gracious Heaven I what a sensation came over me when ] felt myself alone after what I had heard and seen ' I shrunk into my cloak ] wished sight, and hear¬ ing, and memory utterly extinct I frit I had acquired a strange treasure I felt that the visit and the communications I might probably receive were supernatural and marvellous, but I feared to look in¬ to my mind, I dreaded to think on them , they were all too wild and darkly shaped to be the companions of night and soli¬ tude I wished to think deeply of what I had w messed , but not till morning I longed for a deep, heavy sleep, to ease my dizzy head, that throbbed, and whirled, and rung, till, grasping it with both hands, I tried to shut every avenue of thought and sensation lt was a disnvtl night I heard the clock strike every hour Morning broke, and when 1 saw, at length, the sun, bright and chearful, shining on my walls, I lay down lo rest with
with a confidence, a satisfaction of mind, thst I believe I never shall again feel going to rest at night Father Schemoli visited me, as usual, in the diy There was not a trace of last night s business in his countenance I shrunk when he entered, vet soon sur¬ prized at his silence and unaltered look, I spoke to him, spoke of last night, first with questions of general import These received no answer I became more anxious , I inquired, I demanded, 1 in- treated in vain After staying the usual time, he departed, without relaxing a nui tie, without nitering a sound, or in¬ dicating by look or gesture that he even understood me He departed leaving me in that unpleasant state in which jou be¬ gin to question the evidence ofjour own senses, and doubt whether the objects of vour solicitude were not the shadows of a dream The day passed on Evening came, 1 with
with a tram of sad and dusky thoughts I could not exclude them. I ceased to attempt it My mmd had either sunk under the languor of a long and vain resistance, or had become familiarised to objects once so strange and repLİsıve lo our nature They seemed to me the proper furniture of my prison I hung over them in gloomy listlessncss, without shrinking, or repelling them as I first endeavoured Of a mind in this state, no wonder the sleeping thoughts were as dark as the waking Indeed, all mv thoughts, at that gloomy time, floated between vision and consciousness I have often started Irom a point where their pursuit has led me, and asked my¬ self, Was it the dark object of a dream ? That night, weary with the watching of the last, I threw mvself on my narrow bed as soon as it was twilight I had scarce closed my eyes, when I was in¬ vented with all those strange powers which
which sleep gives, beyond all powers of life I thought Μ ι chelo was still alive, and that he led me to the apartments of the west tower Ihey were ď-corated gaily and magnificently, and filled with crowds, who turned their eyes on me, as if some¬ thing was exp< eted from my arrival I passed through them till I arrived at the chamber tut chamber whose ominous stains told me of dangers my curiosity or my fortitude defied It was more magnificent than the rest At the head of a sumptuous table sit my uncle and his wife, such as 1 had ->cen them in thesr portraits, gay, and youn¿ and splendid At a distance, they apptaicd to be smil¬ ing around them, and on each other, but at, I drew near thim, the smile was altered into a strange expression It seemed an effort to conceal the sharpest agony I came still nearer, and fear began to mingle with my feelings As I approached
approached, my uncle seized my hand, and drew me to him, then withdrawing his gay vest, shewed me his breast pierced with daggers, and splished with blood I shuddered, but while 1 was yet gazing on him, he snatched one of the daggers from his side, and plunged it into that of his wife She fell, dying, beside him, and, with one of those sudden chľnges, that in dreams exrite no wonder, he suddenly became Father Schemoli his head shorn, and his habit that of a monk, andchaunted the requiem over the corpse •f his wife It wis echoed by a thou¬ sand voices I looked around mc , the eompany, so gay and festive, were chang¬ ed into a train of monks, with tapers and «rosses, and the apartment was a vault As I gazed still the li hts grew blue and pale; slowly, bu' perceptibly, the body decayed away, ind became ι skeleton, wrapt m a blood) shroud lhe band of monks
monks faded away, as I looked on them, into a ghastly troop, with the as¬ pects of the dead, but the features and movements of the living Their eyes became hollow, their garments a blue discoloured skin the hands that held their tipers, as vcllow anıt as thin a» they Still I gaaed, while they all around nie, and standing on a single point of ground, I beheld them all go dawn, their forms deadening in the gloom, and the last sound of their retuuem coming broken, ind faint, and far from benealh The whole scene was then t hanged, and I found myself wandering through looms, spanous, but empty and dreary lioin the floor, from the w ıınsıol, (rom ıvtry corner, I heard my name ι «pealed, in soft, but distinct accents AnmbaL Anni¬ bal It came to me from every side Pursuing it, but yet scarie knowing tke direction, 1 followed it from room to worn.

an air of peculiar loneliness mit The voice ceased, and thtre ran a hissing stillness through the room, as if its object were attatied I looked around me, expecting- ly On the centre of the room a sump¬ tuous cloak was spread I approached it, conscious that this was Ihe point and end of my wanderings I knew not why— I raised, but dropt it again, shrinking ; for a bloody corse lay beneath I was re¬ treating, but the garment began to move and heave , and the figure extending a hand, seized mine—I could not withdraw it—and drew me under that blood drop¬ ping covering by it The Woor sunk down below us, and I found myself in a passige low, and long, and dark The figure glided on before me, beckoning me to follow Far onward I saw a dim, blue light I followed the mangled form W e came into a place resembling a chapel I again saw my uncle standing beside an altar The tapers on it burned with that strange light

to mistrust that it was the former, when I perceived he was conducting me ta your father s apartment It was evening, but the tapers were already lit, for your father hates the darkness. When I entered the room he was standing There wss another figure then· which I saw but dimly ; for ray eyes were weak, and my limbs reeled under me Your father looked at me with astonishment " Is this Filippo,' said he, turning to the monk, " this spectre, this shadow, u it Filippo?" I was sı bdued to a childish weakness by my confinement His voice sounded compassionately What voice would not be delightful after a silence of four days r I attempted It» sup¬ plicate I believed him touched by the spectacle he had made me, but my voice failed me, and I stood, trembling and silent, before him " Filippo, said he, " you see the consequences of disobe¬ dience , you feel that I have a power to punish, which it is vain for you to provoke or
er to oppose I know you to be not in¬ capable of reflection, not of a vulgar mind, and therefore I deign to reason with you If romantic boys and inquisitive menials are permitted to rove about, discovering, or nrventing wonders what family can repose m honour, what individual can rest in peace?

terrupled me " It ıs enough," said he, " I meant not to crush, but to correct you You have suffered enough, but as long as the influence of your young mas¬ ter might expose you to repeated danger, I should be to blame for your second of¬ fence, if I exposed you to it Go hence, therefore, and if gratitude can bind jou, you are bound to me Marco here will conduct jou to the house where my Apu- lian steward will call m a few days, to bring you with him to my estates there ; he has my directions to settle you there m a situation little inferior to his own, where vou may learn habits of ugularity and obedience Do not oppress me with your thanks— ì —I do not wish to heat them ' I attempted to utter some inco¬ herent sounds of gratitude, but he re¬ pelled me with impatience that confound¬ ed me "I will have no more of this— 1 cannot bear rt Will you not take him from me, father?" I fiirbare to speak. • Set
" Set out Immediately," said he, " night it the best time to-morrow will bring you to your journey's end, and Marco will be your guide " He retired, attended by his confessor 'Tome, fellow traveller," said Marco, advancing, " shall we set out ? night is gathering fast ' I now saw him distinctly for the hrst time , he was a strange, ferocious looking fellow I marvelled to see such a one in the Count's apartment, among whose virtues, condescension was never very distinguish¬ ed , but every thing around me was mar¬ vellous, and the sight of Marco, as he was called, was forgotten m the condescen Sion of the Count, and the suddenness of my own deliverance I said I was ready to attend him, but he saw me totter, and look weak, he approached the table, where stood a flagon of wine " Come, said he, " this glass to your safe and fpeedy journey, swallow it man, you will have need of courage " I took the wine from
from hım, and looked on him as I took it, with the vacant eye of weakness, but the look of his features rouzed me, weak as I was , it was a strange expression, I do not like lo Iliink of it, even now We went nut immediately, he took care I should not be seen by any of the family. \\e went to lhe stables I felt myself in¬ flamed by the wine I had swallowed, and we rode off together in high spirits In .1 short time, however, my companion be¬ larne silent and gloomy I asked him a thousand questions about my journey, its object, and its termination, I could get no answer irom him, but a short and ge- neial one—" Your journey is short and easy, «--morrow night willend it ' Then I spoLeof the Count, and his condescen¬ sion to ire, but I observed, that as I spake on this subject, he became more dark, and more restless , then I began to inquire how long he had been in the service of IheCountMontorio " 1 have served the Count,"

irmed men were fighting in the hut, and blood was spilt, and bodies were fall¬ ing like withered leaves Sometimes he would cry out to wipe those daggers, sometimes lo hide those bloody gar¬ ments, sometimes, What, struggling still ' Press your knee firmly on his breast, and gripe the skin of his throat ! Aye, that will do, now close his eyes, and wipethatbloody ftum offhismouth 'Then starting up, he would cry, " There, fel¬ lows, there, he has fled, he has escaped, fly after him, pursue him , my lord the Count will buy his blood with half his lands ' These were strange words, but I con¬ fess, that while I looked at the bright and blessed moon, and caught the breeze through my casement of leav«, so fresh and cool after the damp heats of my dungeon, I listened to them rather with vacant curiosity, than fear As 1 looked on the clear heavens, I thought I saw the very star, that when I used to be return¬ ing
mg through the woods to the castle, I would see just rising over the battlement» of Ihe West tower It would glimmer among Ihem, Signor, just like a feeble ta¬ per at a casement, and when I saw it rising over the dark hills of the vintage, I thought о Γ lhe cosile, and of you Though my companion and my journey were so strange, myriads would I have given you were along with me, and I determined as soon as I had reached \pu- lia, lo discover where you were, and to li¬ berate you if possible " Filippo, I believe this is a gratuitous addition lo your narrative In the sudden joy of liberation, could you think of me ì ' " Could I, Signor ì Ah, you know not with what keenness the mind, just escaped from suflenng, reverts to images that awaken and contrasi Ht former slate lo think of myself was to think of you , for to think of myself, wis to think of a lonely being, a solitary being, a confined and pining being,
being , therefore I thought of you All I had so lately felt for myself was transferred to you, it was not sympathy, Signor, but strong remembrance—remembrance of the dungeon and the darkness, the dim lamp, the meal that I scarcely saw, the strange faces staring me out of sleep, and the toads that I shook off as I awoke all this I thought of, and how then could I forbear to think on you? Farly in the morning we set forward again , »ve rode through a wild, woody country all day, only baiting to sleep ш the hollow ofa chesnut during the heats of noon At the close of evening, we were in a thitk wood, the tracks were perplexed, and appeared as if they were not much fre¬ quented Marco often paused, ani look¬ ed around him with uneasiness and dis¬ trust , he often checked his mule, and looked between the trees, and listened of¬ ten, as the wind that now b'gan to rise, moaned among the branches, sometimes resembling
resembling the sounds ofa human voice It wss to no purpose to ask questions , his Utter silence, and the gloom of the even¬ ing, were beginning to make me feel strangely, when on a sudden, after mut¬ tering to himself forsorne time, he spur¬ red his mule on violently, then turning round, and bending his head low, he gal- lopped on me so quick, that I had scarce time to spring out of his way, i» r d ask what he me-nt " It was a spnmţ of my mule said be, " cursed |adc, hshing the animal, ind falling bebind me ' I had belter keep out of your way, ' said I, crossing into another track " Ave, ave, you had bettei, if you can " he muttered Then darting forward, he disappeaied among a thick tuft of brushwood on the right I was startled for the first time, at this motion, and followed him as fast as I could— it wis in vain , he had a better knowledge of the wood, and its dark wav s , still I pursued lum, though in a short time I
I could not even hear the sound of his mule s feet Bui the wood opening sud¬ denly to the right, I saw a large ruinous building, that appeared like Ihe remains of a good dwelling, fitted up for the re¬ sidence of a woodman, there were no ofhces about it, no appearances of any country business being exercised by the owner, it looked strangely dreary Mar¬ co was at the door, dismounted, and talk¬ ing to an ill looking mm , both advanced when they saw me with an appearance of satisfaction This is vour ho^t, said Marco, ' this is Vei anzio Yon were rarely frightened when I gillopped away ind left you in the thicket—but I knew you would follow the track , few can miss it, that have once set out in it It was cursed foolish howcvc, to leave him said Venanzio discontentcelly, ' he might have got away, and all pursuit of him bevnn Come, young man,alight, you will not be sorry ofa good bed, and quiet rest

drawing batk his chán, measured mc with a slovv and steady look, from head to foot, and then nodding to Venanzio, began twisting his fingers into a k.'ot, and drawing.them afterwards with a straining motion together, \ enanzio only grasped the hilt of his stiletto lumly, but both de¬ sisted siiiklcnli, when they behtld mc looking at thein There came a boding sickness oter me, I struggled v»ith it, for I knew not vvl) I felt so I ittempted icon versation, foi vve had sunk to monosyl¬ lables and silent looks The mine of \ tmnzso I thought was f-mihar ' Cer- tainlv, sud I to the host, ' I have heard vour naine befoie, though vour name- it ike does not do it muth cicdit ' " Very possibly you might, s.,id he " Tht person to whom I allude, said 1, " was a famoiib assassin in Messina , Ins atro- iitits weie the most numerous and ex¬ traordinary 1 ever heard of "Why do voi n li jou

" Oh, curse him," said another, " I could forgive him any thing, but cheating his comrades, as he did, when they had so handsome a price for their work " Venanzio looked surlily , " Perhaps," said he, " he was ill pa d himself" " You seem to mistake me, said I, " the person of whom I speak, was no mechanic, he was an assassin ' Well, «aid one of them, "and dont you know, that such a one must have assistants, ave, and pay them well loo (darting an angry look across lhe table), and must have work too— ave, bloody work, tearing work ' ah, ah, ah'" (rutting out large splinters of the table with a clasp knife, and forcing a horrid laugh).

lofty, such a fall, however, could neither stun nor hurt me I only dreaded the noise might alsrm the ruffians, this how¬ ever, was not to be avoided I determined immediatelv on my descent to rush across the room, and spring through the wind w, or if possible to prevsil on the wouno I man, who appeared averse from blood to inform me, in what direction I might escape I now let myself down silently, but ex¬ peditiously The wounded roan gave no ngn of notice, I neither heard him stir nor mosn I hid sunk on the Ьеатч, till only my elbows were supported, and was endeavouring to detach those, and let myself drop when by some untoward motion, a· large heap of the rubbish I had removed fell through the hole with a loud noise, and part lit on the bed The frighted wretch screamed aloud, and continued his cries so long, that though my intention was to leap down, and im¬ plore
plore hım to be silent, I heard steps ap- proacl· ng before I could execute it; or draw myself back, almos , into my hiding place Saviolo re entered, as usual, with a curse in his mouth but I found the pur¬ port of his return was not to sooth, but to threaten the sick man, and with horror I heard him say * Curse on your clamours, you will waken the man that ts to be murdered and give him a hint of where he is and then we shall have a struggle, insti ad of finishing him as he lies " The terrified creature averred with earnest re¬ pellilo is that some one must bem the room from the noise he had heard, and from the violence the roof appeared to hai e sustained Saviolo appeared little inclined to believe him, the noises he said were imaginary and the roof had been shattered by the storm , " For just over your head there is a passage between the stories of the building, with the ex- * tent
tant of which none of us are acquainted, and through which the wind rushes with terrible fury, but at all events," he con¬ tinued, " as they will not want mc in this business, I shall stay with you, and pre vent you from crying out, till it is ovei , they will have struggling enough with km, there u no occasion to wake and put hunon hu guard."

7 eno wss about to go up, and discover whether the stranger was Mİeep, and that if he were, he was to inform the person appointed to strangle lum, who would dispatch him immeilntely \t this terrible intelligence, I was al¬ most ready to dash myself down and trust to a desperite chance of safety, for every probable one had disappeared, I was en¬ closed on every side, death actually stared me in the face The immediate danger, however, I felt an irresistible impulse to escape from If any of them should visit my room, and find 't empty, he would quickly discover my retrct, and I should be butchered in that dusky hole without a struggle, back therefore, I crept, without a single hope to direct the motion, but with a blind resistance of inevitable evil, half smothered by the dust and rubbish, I scrambled through, crushing at every touch the eggs of the little domestic ser¬ pents, and displacing the nests o," lizards and
and toads, whose cold slime made me shudder, as I crawled amongst them At length, I reached my own apart¬ ment, tnd as I raised myself out of the trap-door, and caught the tamp that burn¬ ed stilt beside it, f almost expected some hand would push me back into the cavity The room was empty, nnd no one had been there in my absence After a moment s debate, 1 rose, shut the Irap-door, placed the lamp on the table, and threw myself on the bed, concerting with calm desperation my last plan of deliverance I had scarce Iain down, when I heard a slow, heavy tread on the stairs, though I had arranged something like a means of escape, and though part uf it was to admit Zeno into the room without resistance, as his intentions were not immediately murderous, yet there is no telling the agony with which I heard hi-n approach— certainly approach, nor the miserable vatchlulness with which I Ltruggled to distinguish
distinguish whether lhe steps were real, or whether I was deceived by the wind, w hose force had made the ruinous stairs 11 eak all night—it uni a step, the step of the man who came to see was I prepared for murder He came up softly, and I I card him pause at the door, and withdraw the bolts slowly likeone who fears todis- tmbasl »per, I heard him in the room, 1 felt bini appioach the bed I counter¬ feited deep sleep, as he came nearer, I experienced a hon id sensation, like tnat vi'itrh arrómpanles lhe oppression of the night m?re , it was the struggle of na¬ ture witain me, my resolution was to lie still, but m'urc mov d w thin me to snuggle or to fly He came close to me, 1 heard him keeping m his breath , he bent over me, holding his lamp almost close to mv face I thought tl.is might be a Inal whether my sleep was counterfeited , but I darı d not stir I would have given the world to have looked at him under my eye-lids at
at that moment, to have seen the ex¬ pression of his face, whether there was compassion or any relenting hi u , but I dared not Yet at this moment wh le ] jet doubted but he was examining whether he could not do the deed himself Send that, in the next instant I should ftel his stiletto in me before I even saw it drawn Even at that moment will 5 011 believe me Signor ? an irresistible pro pensity to laughter spread itself over my Ace, over my face I say for in my heart was nothing but despair yet was it ir resistible my feitures relaxed into some thing lhat felt to me like the motion of blighter but struggling with the pertıı ballon of fear and the paleness of e\ pected death It appeared so different to him that mittenng inwardly loor wretch' he sleeps uneasily he withdrew his lamp and quitted the room I did not even dare to turn on my side or un¬ close my eyes lill he had shut the door I counted
I counted his steps down stairs, and then rose instantly I had no refuge now but m myself Alt that intervened between me and death was removed. The next ν isitor was to have my blood I hastened to the door, and secured ι as well as I could This was a means of delay if not of defence I then extin¬ guished my! amp and descended through the trap door and scrambled on to my lormer s ation, aft»r drawing the tráp¬ il юг after me as close a. I could As I irawled over the ceiling of their room, I ventured to peep downward They were still sitting but as I looked, oue of them prepared to rise, then I durst look no longer I crawled onward till I came over the loom of the sick man 1 look¬ ed downward The sight was bey ond the most sanguine calculations of my hope The sick man was quiet, the lamp still burned and Saviolo was asleep There was not a moment to be lost I let my¬ self
self down as quietly as I could through the hole in the ceiling till I hung only on fie beam with my hands After suspend¬ ing myself for some time, till I felt my own weight, and was released from all obstructions, I commended myself io St Philip, and let go mv hold, and lell with less violence lhan could be inngintd The sleepers did not move I looked around me For some time, without len- luring lo stir, to be assured of lhe reality of my desrent, wilh so little noi e or danger, and that the tianquillitv about me was not counterfeited All was still I rose, and creeping wilh that raulion, which none but such a situation can «jive or imagine, I began to exploie the room There was but one window, the lamp burned in the hearth, b- r ore which Sı¬ vıolo was sleeping in a chair Scarcely touching the ground, 1 proceeded to pass him When I was opposite lnm I in¬ voluntarily stopped, and, with an impulse 1 cou'd
I could not resist, looked full at him His eyes were wide open and in¬ tently fixed on me My terror did not conquer my reason After a moment passed in the stupor of lear, I percer» ed he made no use of his observation, he neither spoke, nor offered to stop me I ventured to look at him more close¬ ly and I perceived, from the fixed and filmy glare of his eye, that he was still asleep A moment s thought confirmed my confidence I had often heard of people who slept thus, particularly those whose minds are gloomy or perturbed I now withdrew myself quietly and plac¬ ed the lamp at some distance, lest its light should act too strongly on the exposed and dilated organs of sight I glided across Ihe room to the window It was a large casement that appeared, trati its structure, to be moveable, but with most distressful apprehension I perceived, that to reach it I must step across the pallet to
of the ack man, nay, actually step on it After what had happened, however, with¬ out disturbance or discovery, I had some hopes that a hghl step would be unfelt and unheard I rose therefore on one foot, and, reaching across the bed, laid hold of the frame of the casement A ternble blast that rushed against it that moment, almost made me fear it would be shattered in my hold I re¬ leased it for a moment, and looked round me with fear I heard only the heavy breathing of Saviolo, and the groaning of the old and ruinated ceiling, as the wind swept over it I felt these delays of fear would be endless, and, resting my knee on the frame-work, and holding it »nh both hands, drew my foot from the hid, when the sick man, with a faint cry, like that of weak surprise, extended one arm, and caught me by the ancle In ıha scene reason, life, seemed to forsake me I neither felt nor thought, I neither struggled
struggled nor spoke I grasped the frame with a force that shook it, and fixed my hollow and bursting eyes on the hand that held me For my liberty, for my life, again, I would not live over the two moments that elapsed, before I perceived that he had grasped me in lhe agonies of pain, involuntary, unconscious, and yet asleep, that he had laid hold on the first thing that was ne\t his hand, and held it without being sensible of the aet, о of any relief from u But this discovery consoled me but little He might hold me till escape was impossible, and to li¬ berate myself by a struggle, would be to wake him With anguish therefore, (such as none but he who counts but a mo¬ ment between him and death—death, ag¬ gravated by the near chance of safety, and tht certain increase of suflenng, has ever felt,) I awiited the dissolution of his hold as my only hope of life In two moments, with the ume suddenness 5 of
of motion, he released me, and, with some inarticulate moans of pain, turned to the other side The instant he released tne, I felt such a gush of heat through me, that I almost relinquished my hold of the casement from weakness In a mo¬ ment, however, I collected myself, and attempted to open the casement This was done with difficulty, yet I dared not look behind me, lest I should see Saviolo s eye upon me It teas done however, and I looked out on the free air and the open woods. The night was now utterly dark, and the tempest terrible I could hear the roar of the forest below, but knew not whether I should be in the forest on springing out of the window For deliberation there was no time, nor could it teach me any thing Arountl, above, and below me, were only tumult and darkness. I threw myself out of the window I alighted, after a rapid decent, npon something solid This gave way under
under me, and I felt mvself falling again, with more pain, and through more ob¬ struction than before At length I reach¬ ed the ground, sore and bruised hveiy thing about me was soft and damp, other¬ wise, I am convinced I must have broken my limbs withmy double fall At a little distance fiom me, I heard the growling of a dog, and the rattling ot a cluni I «lid not dare lo stir, nor even to examine whethei I was hurt or not, Itst he should betrai me by his barking In a moment howevei, I began to reflect, I had gained but little beside bruibes and danger, b) I In owing myself out of the window I ι ould be as easily discovered and mur¬ dered in a shed, which I believed my present abode to be I rose therefore as quieti) as possible, but sunk down agiin from utter inabihty to stand. I found 1 had either sprained or broken the limb on which I ahghtcd Anothtr thrill of agony ran through me at this dis- vol u к ce very,
covery, keener than the pain that fol¬ lowed my vain attempt to stand, but however reluctant or perturbed, I was obliged to sink down upon the damp straw that was spread over the ground In a few moments, the moon broke thro the clouds, and shining with strong light, discovered every object around me I was in a large shed, rudely constructed of mud and the branches of trees, and cover¬ ed but partially with straw I could not see whether it was connected with the principal building, but it was open every where, yet I could not escape The roof was broken through where I had fallen, and through the fracture I had a view of other parts of the building, rude, and ruinous, and dimly seen, from amid dark clouds and masses of forest shade that were spread around them The anguish of my mind would, I believe, have again risen to madness, had it not been quali¬ fied by a kind of stupid satisfaction at 3 the
the idea of being so far frum the per¬ sons and weapons of the murderers, and a dream of impossible hope that I might be concealed by bung wheie it was not probable any would searih or tu pect, from its nearness to'he house thus paiified by contrary expectations, of whith, nevertheless, the love of life ι n dered both probable, and compelled to reconcile mvself to remaining where I vvas, since, to stir was impossible, I sunk down, but still kept my eyes fixed on the building still listened ea^jerlv for a í >nnd In a short time, 1 beheld a light mov ing slowly up a part o r the building just opposite It wa, so dim, and pro¬ ceeded with such frequent pause of mis- chief-meaning delay, thit at once I con¬ ceived it was the person emplojed to mitrdtr me who was ascending to my room I attempted to stand upon my leet , bul the impulse was unable to con¬ tend with pain and infirmity The light iei
stopped and di appeared for some time In a moment after, the whole building echoed with cri 's of astonishment, and qtnck voices that illed and answered each other and lights darted and disip- peared at every window in my sight All this I interpreted aright He had gon" up to my room, found it emptv, and was now alarming the rest to pur¬ sue and discover me AH this I wis obliged to know, with a const lousncss that if any chance should diret t them to where I was concealed, 1 was inevitably lost After halľ an hours intolenble suspense, during which every partoft'ie building seemed to undergo a sean h I distinctly heard thtn going out ш another direction apparently that by which I had entered the house, and whu h wis oppo site to the pail of the bi liding where the sick man I y This was an intiminoti of safety to me, but still how piennous was that safety ' Any of thein might ta e 1 tie

confidence, was to be made a mens of ex¬ torting from you some knowledge, which they did not describe very clearly, but of which they seemed determined to get pos¬ session My attachment to you made me shudder at this proposal, till I recollected, that to appear to enter into thei mea¬ sures, was the Lest way to defeat their mischief, and that to betray my indigna¬ tion and horror at them, would be only to sacrifice my powers of serving you, to an unseasonable display of my zeal I listened to them therefore in silence, and by holding down my head in a pos¬ ture of of deep attention, concealed the changes that my countenance underwent I never knew so much of the iniquity of the human mmd, I could not believe so afuch had exbted in it, as I heard mani¬ fested in the directions given me for ac¬ quiring the knowledge of this secret they believe you to possess The object was simple, but the means were crowded with such

every night his appearance was becoming rnore terrible and its expectation more insupportable to me I dreadeu in what this might terminate He had darkly spoken of fhe possible subversion of my reason, I felt all the horrors of this pre¬ diction There is no evil like the ex¬ pected or approaching loss of reason, there it no infliction thst cannot be tole¬ rated in imagination, but that which ■weeps all power of provision resistance, or mitigation of any other Even in the present state of my mmd, this sensation was exquisitely painful, as it in a manı er verified what, of all things I was most un¬ willing to believe true , viz the agency and power of that singular being I shuddered inwardly with reluctant con¬ viction with that irksome feeling that cannot dispute the evidences yet hates to admit the conclusion One circum¬ stance relative to his appearance, ( which night in a great measure assist me to judge
judge of his up maturai pretensions), I believed myself abled fo discover still— the mode of his «.trance into my apart¬ ment If, as it seemed, he was a being that could glide through walls, and over¬ come material obstructions, I could resist no longer the belief of whatever he might disclose If he required the assistance by which human beings pass from one part of space to another, I rejoiced in the hope of discovering his imposture, and obtaining a triumph over this wonderful being, whose superiority lo humanity, mingled en» y with my astonishment While I was occupied by these thoughts a strange drowsiness crept over me , 1 resisted it at first, without an appre- hen ion of its influence being so strong, but in a "hort time, I felt all power of thought gliding from my mind Half angry at so unseasonable a weak¬ ness I rose, and began to walk about the room, it was in vain In a short time, from
from utter incapacity of motion, I was obliged to throw myself on the bed, where a deep sleep fell on me It did not continue long, I awoke I know not how Before I was fully awake, I felt my eyes were in search of Father Schemoli, they discovered him, as usual, sitting by the table on which my lamp was burning still * Without betraying any emotion, without uttering a single word,or interjection of fear, I continued to gaze on him, expecting something more than 1 had yet heard, to proceed from him, the idea of his superna turai power involuntarily mixing withmy own thoughts, produced a full conviction in me, that he was acquainted with the real object and topic of Filippo s conference with me, and I awaited his declaration of it with as full reliance, as if he had been present at our conversation, but he spoke without allusion to that, or any subject, but the constant one of his visits
visits. On that, he poured forth a flood of supernatural eloquence, which I no longer attempted · ι resist, or to interrupt It was terrible to hear him—the admiration that follows impassioned oratory, was lost in more strange and awful feelings, there was evidently something of the power and evidence of another world about him Delight was checked, yet heightered by terror, and attention wa" often suspended by the wonder, how man could hear him and live The mind rose to the level of the speaker, I felt myself upborne and floating on the pinions of his voice over the confines of the invisible world, over the formless, and the void I felt it with a wild and terrible joy—a joy that made me as strange to myself, as everv thing around me was, a joy that from the very gid¬ diness of its elevation, precluded me Irom measuring the height to which it had raised me—the remote point at which I stood from the common feelings and habits of
of human nature I know this was a strange and wayward frame, 1 wonder at myself, I can hardly describe or render it probable, but I have heard of beings, who, with unnatural strengh of feeling, would hang on a bare and single point of rock to see the ocean in a storm, would rush out to cross the forky lightnings in their dance, or howl to the storm is it bent the forest, or shook the mountains to their base 1 have heard of such, but scarce believed such a feeling could exist in a human breast, till I listened to this strange being and listened with pleasuie as strange But this night, whether encour¬ aged by my silence, or whether in the progressive fulfilment of his commission, he spoke more openly of its object, he dared to tell me I was doomed to be a murderer A murderer did I say ŕ Com¬ pared to the crime, which he affirmed I would perpetrate, that of murder might be termed a benefaction, an honour to society.

Was I not a free agent ? Had I not the power of choosing one mode of action, and declining another ? To the perpetra¬ tion of such horrors as he predicted, no- VOL n L thing

he walked as he would at noon day ; but at the end of the passage, he suddenly stop¬ ped, and taking the'lamp from me and shrouding it with his cloak, stepped for¬ ward with breathless and shivering slow¬ ness, motioning me to do likewise I did so, but in the room we entered, I could discover no Teáson for this sudden cau¬ tion, it was spacious and desolale, and as the half veiled lighi threw a partial and thwarting gleam upon it, I could only see masses of dusky obscurity As we drew near the opposite door Filippo con¬ tracted his steps with increasing fear, and I how threw round me a glante of serious inquiry 1 discovered then with difficul¬ ty, a dark heap in Ihe corner we were ap¬ proaching , it was too dim and shipeless to suggest any cause for the caution he betrayed ; yet his eye as he drew nearer it, rolled in horror, and his steps almost falter d I leant over him to view it aore closely, and in that moment I thought

concern, as if I was not flying for life— for life hardly held and hourly threat¬ ened Still, under the influence of what I bnagined I beheld, I eagerly questioned Filippo, whom I had now overtaken, and who had renewed his swiftness ' That chamber," said he, incoherently ' ask not—hurry on, your life depends on a moment—he is quiet ' I obeyed lnm insilence we crossed other chambers and wound through other pas sages 1 had never beheld before, orknew this vast fabric contained, but as I passed, 1 could not help glancinga thought of horror upon the numberless victims of the guilt or cruelty of its former possessors so far from the knowledge or sympathy of their fellow creatures, though under the same roof, and within the same walls, that it was perhaps unknown to their nearest re¬ latives where they existed, or what they suffered, that the groans they utured, might form a part ol' the respiration of a 4 friend

By the delay, and the imperfect sound that followed the application, I knew ils success too well, the sound struck upon my heart Filippo the next moment withdrew
withdrew the key, and disappeared down a dark arch, which I had not seen before, bearing the lamp with him I remained in utter darkness. My mind had been weakened by trials and sufferings both real and fantastic The moment he was gone I became the victim of visionary terror I recollected hw sudden appear¬ ance, almost impossible to be effected by human means, his strange swiftness and silence, his look so wild and unnatural, his few words so ominous, his disappear¬ ance without noise or preparation I re¬ collected the strange warnings given to those who were near their dissolution, by those who had already undergone it I recollected how probable it was Filip¬ po had exposed himself to danger even mortal, by his zeal for me, I recollected wilh horror, the mysterious heap in that dark clumber, at which he had seemed to tause with portentous shudderings, its dimensions and shape were like those of

We were in the dark, I remembered the visitation of the spectre monk, I remem¬ bered words never heard by man, but me— never to be heard My eyes grew dim ; a blaze of purple light quivered through the hall, yet 11 ould see nothing by its glare My limbs tottered undei me, but the tnlluenc* whose terror would hase betrayed m>, abated The steps were evidently receding, and as they retired, I thought I heard curses hissing along the walls I remained gasping for breath The air of the hall grew cool again, and
though the darkness was not diminished, its shades, I thought, were less dense and oppressive On a sudden, I felt myself grasped with violence I struggled to free my¬ self I heard lhe voice of Filippo I believed him treacherous, and all tht mysttry was solved " Wretch," said I, grasping him in my turn, " you have be¬ trayed me" " What madness u this?" he whispered in low but vehement tones, " for the holy Virgin's sake, follow me, but speak not ' " You lead me to death," said I, yet I followed him without resist¬ ance I now found we were in complete darkness After descending a few steps, we stopped I was urgent in my whis¬ pered inquiries, but obtained no answer I became impatient of fear and expecta¬ tion and almost remonstrated aloud, when I heard a noise near me, like the open¬ ing of a door, and, in the next moment, Filippo
Filippo led me iato the court of the castle I» was Ihe »ir, the free, open air, the blessed air of heaven 1 breathed it in fr e e d om, it was no dream of transitory freedom. I opened my bosom to it I extended my arms, as if it were tangible •nd material I was delirious with sud¬ den and incontrolable joy When my senses returned, I found we were in a ruinous enclosure, surrounded by buildings I had not remembered to have seen before, but which, from their appearance, I judged to belong to the servants of the castle In one or two of the turrets, thst were gsotesquely perch¬ ed here and there on the blank and giant walls, I still saw lights twinkling Filip¬ po, stooping to the ground, raised up the lamp, which he bad dexterously hid be hind the fragment of « fallen battlement and we crossed the court in silence, with steps often obstructed by the rums that wire
were scattered over it We glided thro' other arches, whose darkness was partially broken by our half-hid light , and at length reached a low door, which opened on the rampar« Here still greater cau¬ tion was necessary This has been long in a ruinous state, our steps were con¬ fined to a narrow ledge of иску path, and our only hold of support was the projections and weedy tults of the dis¬ mantled wall At length the glare of the lamp flash¬ ed upward on a rude and ruined arch, which appeared once to have been con¬ nected with the remains of a draw¬ bridge We crept under it, and. cling¬ ing to its rugged and indented sides, which the bickering gleams of the lamp carved into fantastic shapings, descend¬ ed to the moat, which the fragments that had fallen from above, had almost filled up beneath the arch We crossed it, descended
âeseended the mound, and reached the wwod in safety I now heaped thanks inquiries, and applauses, in the same breath, on Filip¬ po, who was too busy crossing him¬ self and praying to his patron to heed me At length, as we lay behind a tuft of chesnut trees, for he would not permit us as yet to proceed, f procured from him Ihe intelligence of the means • When you drove me from you, Si g nor, said he, " and seemed determined to die, I left you with a resolution to do something desperate I was resolved you should not perish unaided This was necessary for my own safety, as well as yours. 1 could not imagine they wou' i spare me, who was permitted to live only aa a means to betray you wh η it was no longer necessary to employ that means.

Cn this night I observed the confessor had joined the family Through the air of deep abstraction he always wears, it was impossible to discover his thoughts, or whether the frame of his mind was ha¬ bitual or peculiar ' As he approached, where the family were not yet seated, I observed hnn bung forward, as usual, a small vial of lemon juire, which he mixes with wa¬ ter, and which constitutes his only be¬ verage, and place it beside his cover I was near him The motion of his arm shewed me another small vial in his vest
vett I grew deadly nek aa I beheld it I had no doubt I saw the instru¬ ment of yonr death As he turned round he displaced his girdle and rosary He observed rt and began to adjust them In order to do so, he found it neces¬ sary to place the other vial on tSe table, to which his back was turned This vas the critical moment The viri of lemon-juice was on the right, the other on the left With the quickness and si¬ lence of thought I changed their places He turned round, put up the first vial into his vest, and emptied the latter in¬ to a glass of water that stood beside his cover " When I had don» this, I reflected that I had only gained time, that rt must be soon discovered that the monk was poisoned, and that you had only swallow¬ ed lemon-juice If, therefore, I could not devise some means of escape in the interval which I had gained, I felt it ä wu
was una» ailing except so far as to punish an intentional murderer, but the success and promplitiide of my first movement suggested a flattering omen, which I ac¬ cepted, not unreadily " In the mean time lhe family assem¬ bled The Count and his confessor whispered often With unspeakable de¬ light I saw the latter employ the vase that stood beside him Towards the con¬ clusion of the meal, the Count desiring the chamberlain to be summoned, spoke some words to him in a low voice, on which the litter detached a rusty key from his girdle, and gave it to the con¬ fessor who lodged it in his »csi I un¬ derstood e» ery motion It seemed, thai for some reason, probably that of con¬ cealing the corse, the monk had found it necessary to procure the key from the chimberlain I had glanced on the size ind shape of the key, and though it was T< « » n notimi,·
nothing remarkable, I guessed from the former, and from the apparent intention with which it was procured, that it be¬ longed to some external door of the castle, to which, if we could procure access, our safety was assured. I therefore resolved to watch the monk silently I concluded, from the conversation that I repeated to you, that the poison was of a rapid and quiet operation I doubted not that the monk would soon feel its effects, and if I could be near him at ihe moment, and secure the keys, all was w -I " The family now separated The monk retired I watched him at a cautious distance, and saw him enter his apart¬ ment—to lhat terrible apirtment, even at noon day, 1 know not what force could have compelled me, but now, at night, alone, and in darkness, save the dim and solitary lamp that burned in the passage

His steps, however, were a sufficient di¬ rection for me in the deep stillness of the night He took a direction to your apartment ľvery moment now I ex¬ pected to see him falter, or to hear him groan, as I glided after him on tip-toe, led by the taper that streamed distantly on the darkness " He proceeded, however, without hesi¬ tation, till he entered a large hall, not immediately near your apartment It w S wa»

In the mean time, Ippolito, without any object but that of flying what was inevi¬ table, had quitted Naples with a single attendant, and no other preparation for a journey, than an utter indifference to its vicissitudes or hardships. On the first evening, without having pursued con¬ sciously,
seiously, any direction, he found him¬ self on the banks of the Lake of Celano. It was now the close of autumn, and as the wind swept over the dim waters of the Lake, and the mists moved in fantastic wreiths ov er the remote and rocky shores, sometimes giving the forms of ancient structure to the cliffs and headlinds, and sometimes shapings still wilder to the scattered fishermen s huts, and villas on their points , Ippolito mechanically look¬ ed around for some place to which he mi^ht retire for the night, without the hope of repose 'These winding roads," said the at¬ tendant, " Signor, aie so wild and lonely , the nearest town to which we can resort, is that of Celano a good mile further" Ippolito, too weary of spirit to commu¬ nie ate with his servant, silently took the direction pointed out to him towards fhe town of Celano, which they reached at the close of evening They
They entered a wretched inn, to the many defects and inconveniences of which Ippolito was insensible, since he procured in it, the only luxury he could enjoy—a solitary chamber, against the very case¬ ment of whuh the waves of the lake wer« beating Here for the first time he thought on what direction he would pursue Many were suggested, and many rejected, till Ippolito, wondering at his own fastidious¬ ness, began to examine into its reasons, and discovered, with a sensation nearly amounting to horror, that there was spread over his mind a sense of invisible and universal persecution, which ι m pelled his thoughts in their flight fioin place to place, with the same velocily that ils actual influence would have chased bia steps When this conviction shuck him, m uttersble anguish he started from his chair.and paused for a moment between the impulse of fright, and ihe torpor of despair
despair That this influence should have attained this absolute dominion in his mind, and asserled lhat dominion in the very mo¬ ment when the change of place had flattered lum with partial victory, was not lo be borne His distraction almost appli¬ ed to t K tupendous frame of the Psalmist, »»hen he exclaimed, " Whither shall I go Iiom thy presence? Of the latter clause he filt the truth too forcibly, " If I go down to Hell, thou art there also " As he stalked about the room, some persons in the next spoke so loudly, that he was compelled to hear them without any ef¬ fort of attention As he listened to the voices, he recollected the speakers were a party ol vine-dresseis and libourers, who were returning to their native territory— the Abruzzo, from the neighbourhood of Naples, whither they had been allured during the summer, by the hope of higher wages They were now drinking in the adjacent room with the landlord " It is a s range
a strange business, said one, addressing the host, whose name was Bono, " nor do I like speaking of it much 1 never liked to have Satan s name often in my mouth , for, Christo benedetto, one ıs so apt to think of him, when one is alone W hen 1 have to cross the mountain ne ir our village by night, or to watch the ¿rapes in the hut alone I neve listen to stories such as those m the d ıy , I always fill my mind with store of good hwnns, but when there is a good number of us together as we are now, I feel that I haveis much courage as another And so comrades, as I was saying, they talked of nothing el · all over Naples Some said that the ca alier had devoted himself, body and so Jİ, to Satan , and that he met him every night in some place underground, «here no one could discover that his sériants never could trace him further than the portico of the palace , and that some who attempted to follow him, were all inv ested 111
in a glare of blue fire, and their torches were dashed out of their hands by a hoof of red-hot iron Others said, that it was not the voung cavaliers fault, but his great-grandfather's, who had sold all his poslenty lo the old serpent, for a great heap of treasure he gave him , but that the purchase was not to be claimed till this generation, and that it was forfeit at the time of the last ι ai nival, when the fiend appeared to the unfortunate youth, habited like a minstrel, and playing on a harp, whose strings were the guts of necromancers ' Your time is come, you must away *' and thit ill the grove wheie he glided along, has been blasted and bare ever sinte ' '\o\ bv what I hive heard,' said the host Iheliendhas mon-Christian bowels, ind uses lhe Cavalier like a man of ho¬ noui, for 1 heir he has given him per¬ mission to wander ever Italy for a year and aday, and if he can get a priest to give
give hım absolution, he quits his claim on him for ever ' ** Ha, ha, ' exclaimed another, in a tone of superior wisdom, " do you, friend, take the devil to be such a Tool ì no, no, rely on it, if he quits him on the simple score of witchcraft, he will stick his claws fast m hım on an action of bond and compact It is mirvellous, neighbours, how simple ye are, why it is just in the world below us as it is here, witchcraft is like contracting a debt, bu a compact is like a bond—if once Satan ι able to produce it in open court against the defendant, the inquisition itself must acknowledge it, nay,' (exalting his voice with his argument), "his holiness the pope himself must sign as a competent witness." All seemed struck by the force of this argument, and a pause of general medita¬ tion ensued, till one of the party, whose voice was that of an old man, said with an apparent diffidence of his own senti¬ ments,
ments, " Now were I to give an opinion, it would be that the Cavalier was neither devoted to Satan by himself nor his an¬ cestors Ah, neighbours, did you see »vhat a goodly an. noble youth he is to look •tt ye never coul< ! believe he dealt with any thing evil—no, no, as long as I re¬ member, or as long as my father could remember, the Montono were a great, proud, wicked family, they did deeds of mischief enough among themselves, with¬ out the aid of Satan, they were always threatened with discoveries, and dying assassins, employed by them, confessed terrible things, it was said Now perhaps something of this kind is about to be disclosed, and Ihe Cavalier's noble heart is breaking to think of it, and he cannot bear to stay in Naples any longer, to wit¬ ness the ruin of his family ' At this mild construction of Ippolito s flight every one uttered a murmur of disapprobation The love of the marvel¬ lous
loin il too jealous for its gratifications. and too irritable for its credit, (o yield to incredulity so easily. And the former speaker, elated by hit succeu, was anxi¬ ous to preserve Ihe popularity it had ac¬ quired him. " Old man,"said he, " you are much mistaken; if the Cavalier be per¬ mitted to travene Italy, rely upon it, 'lis for the purpose of bringing others to his maiter'· service, in order to escape bet¬ ter himself; for that is the way Satan always deludes those poor wretches. He promises reward and honour to those who are zealous in his service ; and when Ihey have seduced souls without number, and finally lost Iheir own, then lie rewards thein after his own manner, which any one knows thai has once seen the great picture near the shrine of St. Antonio, at the Church del Mirali, near Naples. There, all the degiees and kinds of punishment that ever were invented are exercising upo» the hosts of ruined spirits ;
spirits, one would think the devils had been all in the Inquisition, they are so clever at it, you could swear you smelt bnmstone, and felt a heat like that of a furnace, breathed over you from it, but only to tell you of one group in it, there are three figures-------' Here Ippolito heard the clustering sound of his hearers drawing more close¬ ly around him, his misery became sud¬ denly intolerable and he groaned aloud Terrified at the sound, they all desisted to speak or to listen, and without venturing to comment on the cause of the disturb¬ ance, the last speaker said in a voice of fear, " I believe we had better cease to speak on this subject, unless some ecclesiastic was in the hopse with us. " " There is a con¬ vent of Dominicans near these walk," said the host, who was anxious for the conclu¬ sion ' How near,'said the other, whose desire of exciting wonder was contend¬ ing with fear " You may hear the ves- vol и о per
per bell from this," said the host, evasive!) " But how near, friend Bono, tell me precisely how near ? ' " 'Tis a long mile," said the host, reluctantly The speaker declined to finish his story on this secuntj "The devils in it,' said the host in his disappointment, ' if the toll о that bell, and the chaunt of the monks at vespers, are not sufficient to fnghten the devil, if he were in this room ' His companion" reproved him for pro- faneness, and the host, to retrieve the credit of his sanelimonv said,' Whatever be the t avaliei sulhunun in this lourney, I would not Lc the host tornene lun for the wealth of the \ alıean I wirnnt, the smell ol sulphur n« vei would quit the room he lay in , and il I nieived ι single cell fiom him, 1 should expel I ll to turn lino a bu ning coal in my hand ' Ί ou had betler be on vour guird, friend Bo¬ no, ' said another, in the mere wanton¬ ness
ness of wisdom, " I hear he was seen to take this dir „tion " By the holy saints, there came a cavalier to my house this evening There was now a general commotion of fear, followed by a whispering consul¬ tation Ippolito s first impulse was to quit the inn but he recollected lhat would only confirm their suspicions and perhaps make his further progress difficult Ano¬ ther expedient occurred but his proud heart long struggled with the necessity of deceit \t this moment he heard his servant pissing under the window, he called hun and without spcufying his reasons desired that he would on no ac¬ count mention his name or rank in the hou e nor during anv future part of the jouiney whuh he must be in readme s to pursue as soon as possible lhe man, proud of a charge that usembled an ap¬ proach to confidence, readily pronii ed to observe it, and that his fidelity might о 2 not
not want the merit of resisted tempta¬ tion, immediately repaired to the room where the vine-dressers were seated with the host They had just resolved to send for him, in order to discover whether his master was the Count Montono and now received him with the overcharged welcome, that suspicion gives to hide her own purposes " Pray friend, ' said the host, after they had drank some time, " what is the ca¬ valier, jour master s name' ' "His name— his name —said the man, who in the de¬ termination to conceal the real, had for¬ got to provide himself with a fict nous one " Aye, his name,' continued the host, " I suppose you have lived with him but a short time?' "1 have lived with the Signor several years," said the man, in his eagerness to prove he was not un- piepared foi every question, and to re¬ trieve the ground his embarrassment had lost " You have lived with hım seve¬ ni
ral years, and vet do not knovť his name, that is sliangc indeed stranger than any thing I have yet heard > " Whv what have you heard of the Signot 5 ' said the man, glad to become the inquisitor in his turn " I have ht ard he sometimes walks at night, said the other, significantly "To be sure he docs, and so do all the ca¬ valiers in Naples, ' said the man tuuin- phantly " Aye, but do you know where he goes ? " said the ho,t, lowering his voice " Ν«) , nor docs any one else," said the man, betraying a material part of his intelligence, in his solicitude to prove that no one was wiser than himself " Vou never attend him on those 01- t astons ? ' pursued the host " Sanla Maria, no, ' said the man shuddering " What would you take, and accompany him in one of his nightly wanderings 5 ' said the host, pursuing his victory. " Not the wealth of Lorelto, " said the man, who recollected the terrible stories he hid
had heard of his master at Naples, and who had answered his own thoughts, ra¬ ther than the questions addressed to him " Then it is all true," said the old man " Holy saints ' what a pity ι ' " Η hat ıs a pity ?" said the latkey, roused from his abstraction by the exclamation " \\ hat you have just confessed about youi mas¬ ler '"said the host "Iconfe«s' said the man , " I would not conft ss if I was torn with pincers, I confessed nothing " "Nav, it was not much either, ' said one of lhe men, a shrewd fellow, you only acknowledged your master was one of the Montono family ' " 1 will be tori in ten thousand pieces first,' said the lirai, with increased vehemence " you are a horrid and atrocious villain to say I ac¬ knowledged it 1 never did, and never will ' " Comi, come, ' said his wily op¬ ponent, " you need no be in a fury , perhaps I mistook you, but you must confess, that if he is not one of the fa¬ mily
md) he is remarkably like them ' " To be sure, ' said the man, again sacrificing his cause to his power of answering a partial objection, " to be sure , there is a strong y¡t»n/¡/-likeness among them all' Here a general cry ot triumph arose, whuh drowned even the angry exclama¬ tions of the servant, and Ippolito, dis¬ tracted by the consequences of his folly, and the superstition of the rest, silent¬ ly quitted the chamber, remounted his horse, and pursuing the first track he discovered, with all the speed that dark¬ ness and weariness permitted, was many miles from Celano, before the party had resolved whether to summon the Domi¬ nican brethren to their aid, or to send express to the Inquisition at Naples. The hardships of his wanderings, ra¬ ther than his journey, were lost in more piinful subjects of meditation The se¬ cret of his soul was known—that deep and
and eternal secret, that he believed buned in the bowels of the earth It was known, and the tumult of his thoughts forbid the conjecture by »vhat means H was known, or how its further diffusion might bi pre» ented The onlv sensation that prevailed in his mind, was a confusion undefined, and unappeasable, that could neither trace lhe forms of danger, nor discover what way of flight from it was to be pur¬ sued He trembled, though he starce recollected what was past, he depretat- ed, though he knew not what was to come, he fled without an object in flight, and he increased his speed, is the motives of fear became more and more oltsrurc to his mind The darl ness and remoteness from human lesort or notice, in which the transactions at Naples had passed, had utterly excluded all suspicion that they were known, oi could be known to any indindual but himsell
himself And such was the abstraction and intentness of mmd with which he was engaged in them, that had such ι suspicion occurred, it could not hi\e suspended the pursuit a moment Along with the circumstance it.self, all conse¬ quences, remote or ob\iou.s, were equal strangers to his mind \\ hen, therefore, the fact itself, with all the consequences that the suspicions of ignorante, and the rage ol superstition eould attjLh to it, rushed on his mind, unforeseen and un- weighed, without a powei of prepai.ition ( it -»ist me he staggered undei the "hoi k, it bl ι ted and astourdid him lor a inom* 1 1 1, Msionan and remote Ιπγί were h ni lied b\ substantnl and imminent tenuis ihe ingu.sh of tenor that t innot name ils object, and of ,inlt thit tai not aactitain its danger, gathei- cd over his nund A sensation of rare and excruciating inducine, the sensa¬ tion oi all our measures being antiti- o û pated ;

tris progress seemed nothing but an ap¬ proach to mischief Towards morning he found himself in a part of the country, whose wildness and savageness insensibly poured quiet and confidence on his mind It was man he dreaded , ard here there »vas no trace of man Rocks ana »saters, whose wreath¬ ed and fantastic undulations, almost re¬ sembled the clouds that hovered round them, melting their hues and shapes in¬ to their own unsubstantial forms of misty lightness, presented a range of scenery, more meet for the haunt of an aeual genius than a mortal inhabitant Far to the lett, as the fuller tints of morning deepened and denned the sha¬ dowy charaiters of the mountain land¬ scape, Ippolito descried a dim cluster of cottages, perched in the hollow of two hills, whose antic and spiry pin¬ nacles seemed to have been clett for its reception fhe opposite features of its wild
wild and sheltered situation presenting a contrast that divided the feelings be¬ tween awe and pleasure To the mhi- bitants of a place so sequestered, Ippo¬ lito believed he might safely apply for food and refuge Thither therefore he directed his course, and found, that whatever wonder he ex¬ cited, was occasioned bv lhe appeannce of a stranger in so π mole я region Here he reposed forsorne davs, like a hırıl lhat, chased and wounded, il«,uiis Iki nest amongst maittssiblt lorks iiul spieatls htr torn plunniţe to ihc iwmls ι t freedom He vns excitetl to pnsou- tl exertion to rentier existime toleıablı lleiewereno irtifunl lesourus, no c\- peditnts to disguise tht waste of time, and renew the spirit ol eıııoı ment He was impelled to vigorous bodilv txertise, at first to exhtust the thiiibhin¡,s of inward pain, and altırvv ırıls to (ţratify a newly-acquired stnst ol pleasure An ι extnoiiliiiuy
estriordinary vijţour of frame, which the voluptuous indolence of Naples had enervated, was renewed by his mount tin habits , and Ihe change was in some lime extended to his mind He was at first soothed by the dash of the ι at irai t the hum ot the winds in the mountain ca¬ verns the misses of roi k, bold abiupt, siiti d« t uheil that often assumed the pint o soine anı icnt Gothic strutture, thtn muked and storied ascents and lowers summits, shaping out the fantastic lunns of its architecture , and the beams if tin stttingsun reflected from a sur¬ la« e, ıesplı iident with hues of verdure tnd stains ol marble, aptly portriying lhe illuminated windows, glorious with the colours of blazonry B) these he was at first soothed, and weaned from painful remembrance, but in a short time, he visited them with positive pleasure, not for the sake of what
what they took away, but of what they gave It n impossible for a mind, not con¬ scious of great crimes, to be conversant with nature, without feeling her balmy and potent influence The quiet magic of loneliness, the deep calm of unbreath¬ mg things, the gentle agitations of inani¬ mate motion, poured themselves into the very recesses of his soul, and healed them At first, when he rushed into these soli¬ tudes, he menially resolved to devote himself to the contemplation of his sinn- tion, and of some bold, gigantic effort by which he resolved to free himself from his thraldom , but as weariness and dis¬ traction were the only result of his de¬ liberation, he suffered it gradually to steal from his mind, and balanced be¬ tween the reproaches of indolence, and the refreshment of tranquillity He
He was amused in his solitude by some papers of Cyprian's, which, in the hurry of his departure from Naples, he had u^inteiilion illy taken along with him. They related to that mysterious story which he had left unfinished Ippolito had almost forgot, that the object of it had been attaihed to him The other extraordinary circumstances of the nar¬ rative, strange and remote as thev were, Cyprian s enthusiasm had thrown a shade of incredulity over, and Ippolito read it as a representation of events that had never existed In the papers he now read, the au¬ thors mind appeared weary of the or¬ dinary modes of language, and piogiess of narrative bhe had selected di Deren t periods, as eras in her melancholy his¬ tory, and written a few lines on each m the language of poetry They were monotonously melancholy It vus a passion apparently unbroken by
by an interval of tranquillity, unillumin- Cd by a single ray of hope She had loved as none had ever loved, rnd suf¬ fered as few had suffered Nor would Ippolito have understood the reason or possibility of such despair, had he not recollected to have heard from Cyprian, that the unfortunate female had been a nun, that she had not seen the ob¬ ject lhat fascinated her. till she was un¬ der irrevocable engagements, and that though her " love, stronger than death, had survived in these posthumous lamen¬ tations, it had not the power to make her transgress the barrier of religion, by a disclosure of it while she lived 1 he first appeared to have been written when passion had lingered long enough to know it was hopeless , when the first clouds of melancholy began ю gather over her feel¬ ings—it was written on a second accidental view ot the object of her affections.

And Ikea lkait kan u ever Ippolito had perused these lines, stretch¬ ed on the mossy roots of an ash in a wild dell, when ht had finished the last, he perceived that tha evening had already gathered round him He rose, and re¬ mounting his hone, «hich was fastened to an adjacent tree, rode homeward to the hamlet He lingered in the way, for the images of sadness, had combined with the hues of evening to pour a voluptuous melan¬ choly over his soul Within a furlong of the h.mlet, he entered a woody defile, where the branches of the tall, thick trees meeting above, excluded light even at noon-day, and now deepened the gloom of
of gathering night Across the high banks and matted wood-pttth of this dell, the roots of the trees branched into a thousand antic ridges and curvings, while above, the foliage, so thick and bowery, scarce admitted the wind to whisper through its leaves, or the birds to find their way to the nests, that seemed woven into a verdurous wall Ippohto paused as he entered it to mark ihe rich gleam of western light its opposite extremity admitted At that moment e face ap¬ pearing beside him audibly pronounced, " Why do you linger here ? your fate may be forgotten, but will not be long unful¬ filled ' It seemed to pass him as it spoke, and was lost in the gloom of the wood It was the voice, the face of the stranger, in darkness, in midnight he would ha» e known it He lost not a mo¬ ment in thought, the very force of lus fear gave hnn spceJ like a whirlwind; calling, commanding, adjuiing him to stay
stay or to return, he plunged into the wood, and while he could trace his „n-dow in thought, or th* vestige of motion or so«.-·* that followed him, he pursued it wilh a speed that seemed to make all hu man flight unavailing It was in v un hi an hour he was many miles from the dell in the wood, but not obtained a a glimpse of him he p. d His feelings were too tempestuous weigh cırı um- itances, or pause over 'oubts, he had bat one object— to discover if this dreaded being could really pervade all space, aad overtake all flight If he had in vain called on the moL">tains to cover hnn, and hid himself where even the jealous rage of superstition had failed to discover him He paused on a rising ground to catch the last remains of the light is they fided over the wide prospect before him He saw at a distance what he at first believed to be a young tree, whose branches were tossed by the wind, but his
his eye, sharpened by fear was not long deceived—it was a human figure, tall and dark, that moved onward with amaz¬ ing swiftness, and whose outspread and streaming garments were flung to the wind, like tht foliage of a tree Again he called, again he hastened forward, but his л oice was only echoed by winds and woods, and his peed only led him to wilder haunts, and remoter distance He rotle all night with unabated eager¬ ness of pursuit, and towards morning, first felt his confidence decline on seeing 1 eloic lum a town, from whose numerous nennes roads branched in every direc¬ tion liut though not successful, he » icldcd to the weariness of the noble ani¬ mal that bore him, and entering the first inn he sa»v, summoned the camanere, and inquired, had a person of the strangei s appeirance, which he described shudder¬ ing at his own precision, passed through the town fhe ıran listened to him with F a a, look
a look, which Ippolito thought might be owing to the stern earnestness o r his •wn, but repl id without Hesitation, tlMK had not Ippolito then dismissed him, and wearied by the wanderings of the night, sunk into a perturbed and broken sleep When he awoke, he perceived he had devoted more hours to repose, than his teme admitted, the day was farspent, and he called impatiently for his horse No plan of pursuit was suggested to him but he determined to follow the open track of country through the principal towns, and inquire for the stranger as he passed through each A) he quitted the inn, a servant appear¬ ed with his norse, a rustic was leaning carelessly against a post of the shed from which he had been just led Ippolito observed as he sprung into bis seat, that the servant eyed him intently, and in¬ quired the reason " You are very like a cavalier 1 bave seen m Naples, Signor said
said the man " And what of this caviller >" said Ippolito, pausing " Nothing, Sig¬ nor, but that I should not like much to see him in this house—I do not think I should ever sleep in it again " " Has the cava¬ lier the power of banishing sleep from the houses he visits r' "It is said, he n" er sleeps himself Signor, he has other employments at night " " What may those be i aa'd Ippolito " Pardon me, Signor, I dare not speak of him or them " He crossed himself with signs of strong fear " But I would wish you to be more cırı umst innal, ' said Ippolito, who readily comprehended whom he meant, and who wished to know the probable extent of his danger and become familiar with its ter¬ rors " I should wish to know him, tould it be my chance to encounter him ' " You will easily know lum by yourself, Signor, said the man retiring, ' he is just your stature and figure " This comparison suggested anotner idea to
to Ippolito —the stranger and he were exactly of the same stature he presW his inquiries on the man adding It is of importance to me to be acquainted with the description of this person I am in pursuit of one myself whom per hapsit may assnt me to discover The person of whom you are in quest said the peasant, who had not before spoken is already gone before you ¡Signor he is by thu time at Bellano Amazed al this intelligence so bruptly given yet un willing to exprnd lime in inqii ring how it was obtained Ippolito hastily asked tl e distance and direction of Bell no The peasant informed him and Ippolito was hasting awav when a suspicion of tins strarge intelligence eros ed his mind, and he waved his hand to the peasant to approach hi n The man lingered with a reluctant air Ippolito a 0 am signified his wish to speak with him and the man advanced slowly and irresolutely From whom
whom had you this intelligence ?" said Ippolito I do not know, Signor " • How—not know? Is it possible you rould converse with a human being, and not know to whom you spoke ? ' "1 know not, if he were a human being," said the man ' What is it you say, what man¬ ner of man was he that spoke with you ? " ' Why do jou ask? 1 pray to the virgin I ina) neversee either of )ou again—you know him well enough, I dare say he is beside vou now though no Christian eye « η sec him \\ hat insolence is this, or is il pbien y nlhcr ? Slave, do )ou know lo whom vou speak ? -said Ippolito ' Slavi, reptat d the man with strong resentment Us you are a slave, and to lhe worst of masters, I would not change wilh you, though tins shed is my only dwelling were you on a throne of gold Poor, wretched deluded creature, jour grandeur is lent on hard conditions, and tor a miserable moment of time ' I see even
even now melancholy appearing through those noble, beautiful features yon have assumed I wonder all those gold trap¬ pings do not blaze *up in rows of sul¬ phur, while I talk to you But I have discharged my conscience I dare not say farewell to you, but I trust to see you soon in the dungeons of the Inquisi¬ tion, and that is the best wish a good Catholic can give you " Ippolito, overpowered by the impas¬ sioned tones in which the man poured out his horror and aversion, and by his fears of more general and serious per¬ secutions, retreated without remonstrance, and hastily took the road to Bellano He understood too well the suspicious hints of the groom, and the open rage of the peasant There is no country in the world where pursuits, such as Ippolito s, are observed with more jealousy, or abhorred with a more " perfect hatred,' than m Italy Ippolito
Ippolito saw all the horrors of his fate, and cursed his visionary imprudence too late The innocence of his intentions, and his exemption even from the trans¬ gressions to which it might be supposed to lead, it was useless to avow to him¬ self and who else would believe hım t To have sought the secrets of the other world as a diversity of levity, and to be conversant in ihem without sacrificing ou- spiritual welfare was what could not be easily nor indeed probably believed But all excuse or vindication was too late Suspicion haunted his footsteps, the relentless vigilance of superstition had an eye on him for evil, aı d not for good Unce excited, her persecution was inexorable, and her rancour mor¬ tal His dark and secret trials were known , and, instead of exciting compassion, and »nsuring shelter and protection, they had only a.<akened hatred and fear It mm little
little consolation to him to reflect, that the conversations he had heard had pass¬ ed among the rustics of obscure vil¬ lages The rage of the vulgar is more deadly and tndıscrımınatıng, less lia¬ ble to be pacified by representations, less assailable by any medium ol rational vindication, and more apt to vent itself in sanguinary violence, tiun that of the higher orders Besides, the knowledge that had reached them must have been first diffused through every other rank in society Λ dreadful feeling of ibandonment and proscription began to overshadow his soul lhe rudeness of the scene— rocks and waters seen in a cloudv twi¬ light—fed the dirk tumit t of his thoughts As his const loitsness of the haired of mankind increased, a sense of hatred to mankind increased along with it He wished, in the wildness of the hour, for some banditti, or mountaineer to
to cross his path, or rush from the hol¬ low of the rocks upon him , his tall dark hgure, and waving sabre, like the pines which bowed their branches almost to his saddle bow, as he passed them He wished foi some object of enmity, some stiusţgle of violence, to exhaust the ea- цсг beatings of his finy, to quench that avtision to miukind which he felt their p„ľ,t.t'uiiun had alrcaely kindled in 'us I · heart Impatient of solitude, he contended with nature and the elements, he spur¬ red his horse to passes that seemed ín- acces ible, he delighted to gallop up prenpicts, to ford streams, and to wind ilong the giddy and pointed ridge of lotk, where the heron and the crane и ere first startled by the foot of man, he pushed right against the blast when it blew with vehemence, and held on hu, path where, for a mile, the foam of every returning
returning wave of a laker beat against his horse s mane It was now the close of evening, when he descried Bellano A few stattered huts, interspersed with larger buildings now in ruins, overspread the view to some distance From what this desola¬ tion proceeded Ippolito could not dis¬ cover The soil was fertile, though neg¬ lected , but in the houses and their in¬ mates, there wis an appearance of staring wildness, and of squalid dejection, such as he had never yet beheld He look¬ ed around in vain foi an inn, or any place where he might either procure re¬ pose for the night, or information on the object of his journey As he passed slowly through the nar¬ row streets for the first time, he imagin¬ ed that the eye of all he saw was fixed on him, that his name and fortunes were legible on his brow Whatever know¬ ledge
ledge of him had been betrayed be¬ fore, was communicated in hints and whispers , was avowed with timidity, and murmured round till it was lost in the fears of the speakers But now he seem¬ ed to feel that a general spirit of in¬ quisition had fisteneel on him , that every one either pursued him with suspicion, or shrunk fiom him in terror Wearied, dismayed and disappointed, he struck into the skirts of the town They were now dark and lonely He flung the rein, on the neik of his horse, and loitered on without object At tnis moment the figure of the stranger vi- siblv pissed him He paused a moment, and thin throwing himself off his norse, nlpiied him with the most earnest and solemn supplications, to appeal and in¬ form him in audible words, why he was thus pursued and persecuted Not a sound followed his adjurations, not a step ciossed him After
After following an imaginary track for some time, he found hu progress check¬ ed by a rising ground, on which stood a large edifice, dimly seen in the even¬ ing light Its buildings, spreading over an extent of ground, presented a range of shadow, heavy, sombrous, and solitary It bore no mark of habitation , no smoke ascended from the roof, no step echoed round the walls Ippolito gazed on it irresolutely, yet with a strong impulse to enter it It was certainly the point of termination to lhe direction he had pursued, and lhe direction was what the stranger, il he moved on earth, had pro¬ bably taken At a little distante, he saw a peasant approaching, who seemed, like himself, to linger near the building There was a promising confidence and simplicity id his manner Ippolito thought it best to preface his inquiries with some vague observations on the desolation around them
ihem. " Yes, Signor," said the peasant, " something has happened to the place I think it looks as if it were cursed." ' But what has been the cause of the indigenre and loneliness I see prevailing here, not only among these rums, but among the inhabitants of the village'" " They are wretched and oppressed, Sig¬ nor A strange suspicion hangs over this place There is a horrible tale told of it I do not like to relate the circum¬ stances, I have heard them related so dif¬ ferently , but since they happened, the inhabitants of this place, which was then flourishing, have been scattered and de¬ solated " " What are those urcumstances so strange, that could depopulate a coun¬ try, and leave such mirks of ruin behind them ?" said Ippolito, glad of the relief of local curiosity " They relate," said the peasant, " to a murder committed, or supposed to be committed, on a man who was entrusted with some affair of ex¬ traordinary
traorduiary import The murderer was nevar discovered, nor his motives for the action even conjectured, and however the circumstances are told by a hundred mouths, the wise seem to imply, none of them in fact ever transpired ' ' But is it possible no steps were ever taken to trace this mysterious affair ? ' "I know ■ot. Signor There was a great, power¬ ful, wicked family, said to be concern¬ ed in it They had influence to crus all inquiry № one that contended with that house ever prospered They do not want power for outward means, nor vil- Inny for secret ones «So, whoever op¬ poses them fares like the inhabitants of Bellano ' " Was the whole village then implicated in this strange transaction Ì ' "They were punished as if they had been, Signor Good night. Signer I do not like lingering near the spot at this hour Thu u the very house in which the deed was done " The
The peasant retired Ippolito survey¬ ed the structure He saw it was safe, from solitude and fear In the village, wild and deserted as it seemed, he dread¬ ed discovery, he dreaded the unknown effects of the stranger's machinations. Weiry of persecution, and impatient for gloomy quiet, he thought with pleasure of plunging into the recesses of a soli¬ tude, from which even superstition, that haunted hnn in every other retreat, would recoil with shuddering Again he surveyed the building, and, ascending the rising ground, traversed the dismantled wall that enclosed it It was spacious and ruinous The dark lines of the building were strongly de¬ fined on the deep blue of a clear au¬ tumnal sky, in which the stars, faintly emerging, Upt here and there a battle¬ ment, or a turret with silver He found th e. principal doors fastened, and, as he examined the wall more closely, to dis- 5 cover
tover some means of admission, he thought a ligure started and disappeared in the same moment, from behind a projecting angle of the building He pursued eagerly, but vainly Yet as he turned away, some¬ thing like a sound issuing from the in¬ terior of the building, struck on his ear He listened ; all was stiil He now renew¬ ed bis search, and soon discovered a low door, which required but little force to «pen, and which admitted him into a passage, lofty, and dimly lit It conduct¬ ed him to the principal hall, from which doors and passages branched in every direction All were alike dark and de- aerted Ко foot seemed to have trod there for many years, and their long perspectives led the eye to a shadowy depth it feared to penetrate As Ippolito gazed around him, ι sha¬ dow, faint and undefined, passed along the other extremity of the hall He would hav e looked on it as one of the imagi¬ nary
nary shapes that seem to people the shades of obscurity, but the next mo¬ ment lie heard a sound too distinct to lie the production of fantasy, that seem td to die away in distance lie spring foiward, and found himself it the foot of a spacious stainase, over whose broken steps the darkness made it difficult to proi -ed As he ascended ihem, he loud!» and repeatedly called on the person whom he imagined he had seen, assured him he hid nothing to apprehend fiom »lolence or malignity, thit he wis himself a lonely tra» eller, who was willing to unite with him for mutual security in that solitary mansion and to whom it would therefore be moie prudent to disclose himself No answer was returned to his remonstrances, and he was checked in their repetition by th" 1 loud clapping of a door in a remote part of the building That this dreary place had inhabitants, he had now no doubt W ho voi. n n the»
they might be, or what was their purpose, he resolved to examine, wilh a boldness which was the offspring of desperation He was delighted with a summons that seemed equal to the powers of his mind, «nd did not threaten to 11 it him with guilt, or blast him with infamy The stranger was not here to demand from him the energy of a hero, and then predict to him Ihe fate of a villain The event of this adventure might perhaps exercise his imagination or task his cou¬ rage, but could scarcely aflect his peace, his principles, or his character He had now ascended the stairs, and paused for some moments in a gallery which seemed to communicate with several chambers, from one of them a light ap¬ peared to issue at intervals He entered it, and was surprised to see some embers of a wood fire, dimly burning on the hearth From their blaze, which rose hifu ly and expired, u the wind hissed through lhe dis¬ mantled
mantled casements, waving the feeble fire, lie discovered an apartment like the rest, spacious and dreary Not a »es¬ tiğe of furniture, or any circumstance but that of the fire, indicated the presence ofa human being in the building, his eye wandered over walls, ceiling, and floor, not an object struik them, but the damp, misty obscurity of decay The room was ..hill, he approached the fire, the blaze became more strong, and by its increasing light, he dıscoveıed m the wall opposite hnn a narrow grating, the dusky bars gleamed in the fue-hghf, and, as he con¬ tinued to look on them, a human coun¬ tenance appeared distinctly on the other side Ippolito started, he advanced to the grating, the face disappeared, and a piteous cry issued from within Ippoli¬ to now earnestly demanded who was concealed in the apartment, threatening, with serious anger, to punish any one he might discover, unless they avowed them- 4 3 selves,
selves, and the causes of their conceal¬ ment The grating was then thrown open, and the servant by whom Ippolito nad been so imprudently betrayed at Ce'ino, threw himself at his feet. " Oh, Signor, said he, after a long and unintelligible vindication of himstlf, "why did you leave me at Celano > " Why did you compel me to do so bv your folly, in ex¬ posing my name * ' said Ippolito " It was not my fault. Signor —it was not my fault, I nev er travi lied with a wizard before, and 1 could not kndw ' " A wizard, idiot ' you will drive me mad ' " Illustrious Signor, I kiss your feet, be not angry with me in this dreadful, solitary place ' alas, 1 have suffered enough for it since, those devils at Celano were near tearing me to piec«^, and when I escaped from them, 1 lost my way returning to Naples, and after wandering about in tins wild coun¬ try, dreading to make inquires, lest I should
should be discovered and sent to the In¬ quisition, I crawled in here to-night, lo sleep in one of these waste rooms, and pursue my journey to morrow, and little thought I should have the ill lurk ( good fortunei mean), to behold you agam " ' But why, ' said Ippolito, " did you fly from me on the stairs, jou surely must have hcird iny voice, and when have its tones denountetl dangtr to you ? ' I did not fly, síid the man " I was not on the stairs' " Tıs but now I pursued some one to this very apartment, ' ь nil Ippolito " By all the holy s..i its, I hive not quitted the room since I entered the building, ' said the man This is most stiange said Ippolito, musing ' 1 am pursued by a power that seems to possess more than hu¬ man resources—resistance is vain, I am spent in this struggle But how was it possible vou should conceal yourself, if you did not fly Irom me ? ' " The door by which you entered, Signor, ıs under the
the windows of this room, and when I saw you, I concealed myself, and have not quitted this room since you entered the door below" "And why did you con¬ ceal yourself ľ" said Ippolito, " to me, in the same circumstances, the sight of vou or of any human being would have been most welcome The man hesitated " Why did you conce yourself, ' re¬ peated Ippolito, " you knew me, and knew lhat from me you had nothing tc fear " " I knew you indeed, said the man, shuddering, "and therefore I hid myself Ah, Signor, it is well known for what a purpose you seek these solitary places, and whom you are accustomed to mtet in them, I thought the roof shook over my head as you came under it He ciossed himself with the strongest marks of fear " Mother of God, ' ex¬ claimed Ippolito in agony, " is it possi¬ ble ? Am I so utteriy lost ? Do my own specie· tremble at mv own approach? Hear
Hear me, my good fellow, you who hav e lived withme, who haveknownme, who hav* been lavishly nurtured with every indul¬ gence a generous master could afford, can you believe the horrid tales that are told of me ? I attest the blessed name I have just mentioned, and every saint in heaven, that I am s innocent as you are I have entered into no compact with the enemy of souls; I am no dealer m witchery, I am a crossed and care haunted man, a restless and un¬ happy spirit is within me , it has driven me from my home, and instead of being soothed and healed by the compassion of mankind, it is aggravated and maddened by the brutal rage of ignorance, till ex¬ istence has become loathsome to me " In the ardour of his appeal, Ippolito had laid his hand on the man's shoulder ; the man recoiled from his touch Ippo¬ lito felt it in every nerve, and was again about to expostulate with him, when a strange holni'v sound seemed to ı-sue from
from a distance, and approach the room " I will believe it, 1 do believe it all, said the man cage ly, " but say no mot" nm» Signor, this is no time or place fo such subjects " " Can this place have othe - in¬ habitants, ' said Ippolito pausing fro η his remonstrance to follow the sound " Surt ly it has, said the man "Have vou seen or heard any thing since you cn Kred it, anv shipe or sound like this ' "I have indeed, Signor, just before you entered, the shadow ofa dark figure passed Ihe door, and 1 am convinced I alterwards heard heavy steps on the st nrs but in these old mamions lhe wind makes suih stiange noises tlut unless one ¡> eyes as sure them------' Here the man s face underwent а сопл ul- sion of terror, andflyingonlppolitchehild him with the strong grasp of fear " What have you seen, said Ippolito, supporting him, " or what is |t you fear ? ' " A hand beckoned to me from that grating, said the
the man in inward and struggling tonei '"Tıs this bickering blaze deceries you," said Ippolito stirring the embers with his sword, and looking at the grating , ' the light it flings on these mouldy walls is so pale and fitful " " No, no, Signor, I know this plaie, and Us history well, I marvel that its inhabitants ha\e taken s j litlle note of our intrusion yet, but thty will not long neglect us ' " Yon know this place is inhabited—and by whom ŕ" said Ippolito "By thcspintsofa mur¬ derer, nd ils pumshers,' said the man, rolling his eyes fearfully around him. " Why do you pause with so many starts of fear,' said Ippolito, " speak plainly and full« .vhat you have heard of this place, and of the cause of its desertion " ' You know them perhaps, belter than I do, Signor,' said the man " How is it possible ι should know them, it is scarce an hour since I entered these walks ' " Because they relate to your family " « 5 " fo>
" To my family '" said Ippolito, as recol¬ lection faintly wandered over his mind ; then added in an evasive tone, " there are many circumstances relating to my family, of which I am ignorant " " Do you wish to hear what is told of this man¬ sion, Signor/ said the man, pursuing the subject "Ifyour counge ıs sufficiently recovered to relate H, " said Ippol to, wishing to suggest an excuse to hun The msn proceeded in his narrative "It is some years back, Signor, since this was an ini, and as the town was flourishing, and in good repute, 1 suppose the inn was so likewise It so happened that this >nn was full of company on a night, and they « — e all employed speaking of some strange mysterious business that was about to be disclosed shortly that they said would involve one of the first)amities m Naples, I know not whether it wa» a monk, or an assassin that was to make the discovery , but, whatever it was, the im¬ port
port of it was expected to be most singu¬ lar and terrible So, as the guests were all conversing and each giving his con¬ jei tures and rejsons, a person was usher¬ ed in, accompanied by a guard of sol¬ diers, not as a prisoner, but in order to defend him on his journey he spoke but little, and seemed dejected and terrified, like a man labouring tinder a great se¬ cret It was immediately whispered about the house, that this was th,. person who wis to make the discover", and many in¬ quiries and hints of advances were made, to learn what it might be, bji tie stringer was s » distant that, one by one the gpests all dropped off to their own rooms and left him to go to his about midnight So he did—but never was seen, to return from it Signor , no trace of him was the next morning to be seen, nor ever since The house was examined, the guests were. detained.
detained, the host and hn family com¬ mitter to prison, from whence they never emerged Then the fury of the law fastened on the town , the wretched in habitants were sent, some to the Galbes, and some to the Inquisition but no in telligencc of the stranger was ever prt cured, but ever since that nigSt, this place has bee ι visited with stringe ap¬ pearances Tenant after tenant quitted the house and at length it was dese-t- ed, and left to decay, as you see The \erv last inhabitant told me, that as he was sitting one dark evening about the close of antumn, it might have been in this very room ------"Hark 1 hark' said Ippolito and his servant to each other at the same moment A pause, deep and breathless, followed " Did you hear a nois» > ' said Ippolito, in a suppressed tone " I did. Signor , it resembled, methought ------ " And I see a shape," said Ippolito, springing forward, "it
" it glided past the door that moment ; I saw it with these eyes, I saw its sha¬ dow fi tting along the gallery ' He was rushing out " Holy saints'" cried the min, clinging round him, " you will not follow it ' " Away, dastard '' said Ippolito, snatching a brand from the fire to excite a stronger light " I shall die if I remain here alone, ' said the man " Then follow me," said Ippo¬ lito, who had already reached the stairs He looked around All was dark and stilly The flaring and uneven light of the brand quivered in strange reflections on the walls. As he still looked down the gallery, the shadows at the farther end seemed to embody themselves, and pourtray something like the ill-defined outlines of a human shape He held up the light, and it vanished with visible motion Ippolito impetuously pursued The passage terminated at the foot of a narrow and spiral staircase As he as¬ cended
tended ľ, «the echoes of another step were heard distinctly above, and some¬ thing like the brush of a vestment, float¬ ing between the shattered balİMtrade, al¬ most extinguished the light Encouraged, not repelled Ippolito sprung upward with greater velocity and soon reached the top of the staircase A figure, strongly visible but still ob¬ scure, now appeared at some disiince, and, waving to him with shadowy ges¬ ture, disappeared to the left without a sound At this moment, the last blaze of the brand quivered and expired Ippolito stood lapped in uncertainty A step from below approached It was the ser¬ vant, who, binding two of the faggots together, advanced with a stronger light " Come, quickly," said Ippolito , ' it dis¬ appeared here—here to the left ' The man followed him, ag ust and reluctant, but dreading solitude more than even the apparition
apparition they were pursuing, they entered a room, the only one to the left The figure he beheld appeared to have vanished through the walls Ippolito examined the wainscot and the case¬ ments , the latter commanded a view so extensive, that he discovered the room was situated in one of the turrets of the buiUing Ml was silence and deso¬ lation still " By what mysterious agency, ' said Ippohto, " does this form hover over space, without being confined by it ?" Λ sound, like the fall of some ponder¬ ous body—a sound that seemed to shal' the walls, and sink into the depths of ie earth, roused him from hi, musing The concussion was so violent, that tt flung open a low door in the wainscot, whic', had h ,n< to escaped his notice Ifpolito approach«^ it Within, he beheld an apartment, the extent of which was lost in shades, that were, for a mo¬ ment,
mem, dispersed by a pale blue light t a fluttered over them, and then disappear¬ ed Ippohto, taking Ihe light from his servant, whose countenance spoke the verv despair of fear, entered the room " Thn sard he, as he waved the light above hu head that slowly broke through • gloom of frowning and peculiar blatk- ness, " this should be the very seat of those marvellous operations There is a depth of sh idow, a m ıjr sty of night and horror here — here 1 pause — thit wan¬ dering shape rested here — here he will either return, or appear no more W hat ts that dark mass in that corner said the servant, who had crept after him Ippohto approached the spot he point¬ ed to, and discovered the remains of an antique bed " Make haste Signor, and qu,t this apartmei the brand is almost extinguished," said the servant " You must go down and relight it, I shall
shall not quit this spot to-night," answered, Ippolito "Go down—by myself' bless¬ ed Virgin ' no, not for the Pope in per¬ son, ' said the man. " Did you not come up by yourself?" " Aye, but, Signor, I was coining to you, I heard your steps, and thought of you the whole way But tç i«o to an empt / room, lo feel every step I am gttting fuither from yiu, and at length to ventine ii.to the very hold and haunt of oiher things than nyself! no.

The
ilie man threw himself at Ippolito'« feet, who, glad of an opportunity of Urent meditation, leant against the wall, fixing his eye on the dying flashes of the brand, which he had placed in the hearth Its broad glare danced on the ceiling, ransforming the characters of damp and decay into forms at fantastic as the lines of magic, and now, shrunk into a point, scarce shewed the rude and blackened stones on which it was con¬ suming In the veering light, Ippolito once thoug.it he saw a form in a re¬ mote part of the chamber, but the next moment it expired, leaving a thou¬ sand imagined shapes to darkness At this moment, the servant, half- raising himself, whispered, " Signor, I hear a 'person breathing near me " " You hear my respiration probably," said Ippolito " No, Signor, no, it is the breath of one who breathes with difficulty, u if he were trying to sup¬ press
press it—there—there—it parted me now—blessed saints how neir I Signor, if I live, I felt the rushing of a garment past me that moment " " Hush ' sud Ippolito , " you will not let me distin¬ guish if any one is in motion near us " They both paused some time. Nit a sound was heard " I am stifled hold ing in my breath, said the man " You may draw it in peace," said Ippolito; no one seems inclined to molest us, and if there should, against visionary assail¬ ants I have innocence, and against cor¬ poreal ones, a sword ' lie spake the latter sentence aloud, for the objects he had witnessed were such as human power could easily produce, and he endeavoured to resist his strong propensity to search for supernatural powers ш every object above ordinary life In a short time, the servant forgot his fears in sleep, and Ippolito, exhaust¬ ed by recent fatigue, slumbered, as he leant
leant against the wainscot The visions of his sleep were like the spirits whose agitation had produced them, wild and perturbed He dreimt he was kneeling at the al¬ tar of a church, which was illuminated for a midnight mass Around or near him, he saw no one either to partake or administer the right At length, a figure advanced from the recesses of the allir and ap¬ proached him, at the same moment he perceived his father and brother kneeling beside A deep stillness spi cod ovtr him «s he gnzed around, he experienced that sensation so common in sleep—the con¬ sciousness of «jme mystery we are un¬ able to penetrate, but of which we si¬ lently expect the developemeut The figure distributed the consecrated cle¬ ment His father, on swallowing it shuck¬ ed " poison, in a tone of horror and {ell back expiring At that moment the figure, throwing off his monkish weeds discovered
discovered the person of the stranger, ar- rav ad m a voluptuous ind martial hibit He gazed wuh a fixed eye of horrid triumph, on tlit contorsions of the dying man, bent over him to catch his groans, and, as his dim eyes windered in agony presented himself in every point to their view, exclaiming " Behold ' The vision suddenly changed its scene and tircumstances— Ippolito found him¬ self in a vaulted passage lit by a few se¬ pulchral limps, Annibal wis beside him, and the stranger bearing a torch, and in the habit of a funereal mourner, stalked before them As Ippolito slowly seemed to recover his powtrs of observation he perceived he was in a part of the castle of Muralto, he remembered to have traversed before The stranger, waving them to follow, en¬ tered an apartment hung with the insignia of death,, he remembered it well—it was the last of the chambers that communi¬ cated
cated with the tower so long shut up In the centre of the room, stood a bier, co¬ vered with a pall the stranger withdrew it, and pointed to Annibal and Ippolito, the corse of their father beneath Ippo¬ lito, retaining his natural impeti osıty in sleep, snatched the torch from the stranger, and held it over the countenance of the dead , they were fixed in a kind of vi¬ sionary sleep As he still gazed, the lips began to move, and at length uttered some words of extraordinary ınıpoıt, which Ippolito vainly tried to recollect when he awoke As he still gazed, the body ex¬ tended one hand to h«m, and another to Annibal, seized on both, and drawing them under the pall, lapt them in total dark¬ ness He shuddered and awoke lhe light had long expired, it was suc¬ ceeded by moonlight, dimly breaking through the discoloured windows, and figuring the floor with the rude imagery of thei. casement work He
He looked around him to dissipate the forms that still fluted before his eyes, on a part of the fíoor, where Ihe light fell strongly, he observ ed a dark spot he had not beheld before, whose shadows by their dipth seemed to fall within the floor He approached it, and percciveda crasm of which he could not discover the depth He examined it with his svwurl, and found there was a descent by sleps with¬ in , he Ined to follow them, but found their depth extended beyond his utmost leach Here he piused for a moment, but his resolution w ıs soon taken to des¬ cend and explore it There appe red to be something de¬ signed to ten^n and to bahle him in the circumstances he had witnessed, that tempt¬ ed his courage as strongly as his imagina¬ tion, they were cırt umstances beside, such as human power and contrivance could easily produce, and «uth as human fortitude could easily cope with The β jealousy
jealousy of imposition operated more powerfully on his high-toned mind, than even his appetency for the marvellous, and of the latter too, there was a lurking impulse that expedited his resolution His servant still slept, and Ippolito wished not to disturb him, as he would be equally clamorous at eithei alternative of accompanying him into the vault, m of remaining in solitude, his sleep would probably continue till the morning and at morning he might depart in peaie He therefore commended himself to all the saints, and began to descend Ihe steps They were winding and «riegular He soon lost the faint reflections of moon¬ light, and for a few moments advanced in total darkness He paused, for to advance in darkness, was to < ncounter superflu¬ ous danger, when a flbh of sudden light from below played on the dank, black wall» and shewed him the rugged eteps winding downward to a depth it was gidd
giddy to think of The paleness and flitting disappearance of the light, indi¬ cated the distance from which it issued, but as Ippolito, encouraged by this dubi¬ ous omen, eagerly proceeded, frequent Hashes of a stronger light convinced him it was stationary, and that he was ap¬ proaching it He advanced , the light in¬ creased , it seemed the faint gleam of a lamp struggling with darkness In a few moments he perceived it glimmering at a determinate distance, and sending up long stieatns of abrupt light on the upper daikness A few steps more brought him to л level, he entered a vaulted passage low and blaik, hoary and chill with damps, at the entrance of it a lamp burnt feebli He disengaged it from the wall with difficulty (it was iron, of coarse and ancient structure), and proceeded with it slowlji.lcxtentling his sword before him In the deep blackness of the perspectiv· no object near or remote could be de- vo π к scried
scried , the air seemed almost materially thick and dark A dim atmosphere of bluish light spread round the edges of the flame Ippolito carried, which shivered almost to dissolution, ihough he advanced with the most cautious slowness, dreading lest its extinction should leave him wan¬ dering for ever in darkness or its motion should kindle the foul and pent-up va¬ pours to a flame of which the explosion would be fata) As he glided onwards a sound, he paused to distinguish, came to his ear He listened—it was a human groan, it was repeated, it was like the expression of mental anguish, more than of bodily , it seemed to issue from an im¬ mense distance Ippolito called aloud in accents of encouragement, the sounds ceased As he turned in the direction from which they had proceeded, his foot struck against something which η." stoop¬ ed to examine, it wa* a rosary and cruci¬ fix
fix of wood, they were corroded by damp, but their shape was yet distinguishable As he examined it with that disposition which desires to look for proof in casual things another light twinkled like a star ■n the passige beyond him and a figure dimly defined appeared and vanished with the swiftness of a shadow Ippolito with alternate cries of menace and intreaty, adjured и to pause, or to approach It hovered for a moment on the remote edge of darkness, as if doubtful whether to obey him or not but as he hastened for¬ ward to uige his importunity, it disap¬ peared Its motion was so evidently hu¬ man, that Ippolito felt inspirited with a hope of suci ess as he pursued it, till his progress was suddenly entangled by something that lay on the ground Im¬ patiently he endeavoured to remove it with his hand—it was a heap of dusky and decayed garments, of which the shape was indistinguishable As he threw it from a S hım
hnn, the clank of a human bone rung against the vault He was now irresistibly checked, and holding down his lamp, tried to discover whether any memorials of horror wen near him lhat might be avoided in hi progress Shuddering, he perceived the remains of a human skeleton scattered to some distance around him, the skull had dropped from the garment that was entangled round hn steps As he ga¿td around unwilling to linger, and unable to depart, the lamp darted a bright and ta¬ pering flame upward, and then sinking down, quivered as it about to expue For a moment he believed the fluctua¬ tion of the light was owing toan influence connected wilh the obj'it bifore lum; but on looking upward, he discovered an aperture of which hi., e) e eould not mea¬ sure the height, in the roof of the vault, through which the air rushing had almost extinguished the lamp Comparing this ι ucuimtancc
circumstance with the spectacle before him, he immediately conjectured that the unfortunate person had been precipitated through the chasm, and dashed piecemeal by the fall, as the bones were scattered at various distances All thought of further pursuit was for a moment repelled , and in the interval, as Ippolito was withdrawing his e) es with the slowness of fascination from the object before him, the other light appeared ap¬ proaching from a di«itaiice Through the thick vapours of the vault, Ippohto could siarcely discover that it was supported by any visible hand , but as it approached, he perceived it »vas the stranger who bore it ' He had no time to collect his facul¬ ties , the stianger was alieady beside him They viewed each other for some time without speaking a word, while the lights they held reflected to each, the »ι sage of the other as pale and hxedssthat of the dead At length, " W lierefore are »ou

ver some means of entrication from tins maze of passages From the moment he looked around him with this object, the length and d irkness of the vault became intolerable He would have been delighted ro dis¬ cover the slightest change in his pro¬ gress , he would h. ve been delighted to observ e the walls more rugged and frac¬ tured 01 the ground more uneven At length, the objetts around began evidently to assume a different aspect Lırge masses of stone, rude and dark, projected from the walls and roof, as if Ihey would crush the passenger Around some of them Ippolito observed dusky and stunted weeds were entwined , and once he thought a pale reflection wan¬ dered through a chasm over his head, as if light was stealing on him from the world above Still his progress appear¬ ed endless He
He now walked on with steady swift¬ ness, not admitting the sugges'ions of the hour and place to oveH.adow hn mind, or benumb his exertions Mov¬ ing, with the rapidity of one who wis approaching a definite object, while his eye vainly hung on the darkness to discover one, sometimes stung with an impulse to return, he would pause till the perplexity of the passages wildered his brain in the effort to retrace them Thus he passed on, dreading to look behind, antl scarce¬ ly hoping, as he looked onward In this state of mind, he suddenly fc ind hu progress checked by a wall that ter¬ minated the passage Neither door nor window was perceptible in it He ex¬ amined it with his lamp, and at length discovered a grating that, almost decay¬ ed with rust, ran lor a considerable length in the w. 11, parallel to the ground From its form . nd direction, Ippohto conjec¬ tured

light that fell on his visage, discovered the stranger ' The other was in the ha¬ bit ofa monk He resumed his burthen and was pro¬ ceeding with it when tl ι stranger pro¬ ducing a dagger fastened it in the monk's girdle, pointing with appropriate gesture to the object in white, and giving him the torch he bore, retired up the steps, where Ippohto could see his dark figure gliding past the chasms, through which they wound, and sonetimes bending from them, as if to mark the moľ on» of hu agent below Iiy what means this my terious being was present in every icene of horror, and active in every purpose of mischief, ( for such the present appeared) filled Ippohto with new wonder He seemed to glide fom place to place, like the ver« genius of evil, with a dark suggestion for every mind, and a dagger for every He rt The monk proceeded with slow steps across

He raised the lady in his arms, and pursuing the direction the monk had tsken, began to isrend the steps He looked around in vain for direction o-assistance, the steps were broken and irregular, and but for the dim light that still issued from thr lampat the other extremity of the vault, had been utterlv dark Ippolito knew not whither they led, u might be into the very centre of dan¬ ger—but no choice of directions was left him no other means of flight from the cemetery were vi« Ые As he still as¬ cended, wondering at his own safety, he s г could

On emerging from it, he looked around him — he was in a cloistered passage, that appeared to belong to some ecclesiastical biiililiin; through the windows, dim Atidfiw, α laint moonlight was poured on the chccquered floor, the clustering pillars, and the poin'cd arches of the roof Far to the left, Ippolito thought he could still distinguish the dark figure of the monk as he flitted along, though his stcpcwerc no longer audible, and siili lurlhcra ¿le-un as of distant lamps, trem- blid thiough the ol sciti itv, warning Ip pohlo to shun the direction, where, a· there were probably inhabitants, there •.as danger With only this con|ccture to direct him, he immediately turned to the right r he passage terminated in a door, feebly secured , but as Ippolito laid down the lady lo force back the bolts, he locked behind him with an eye of wonder, to mark was there no scimi of ţursuiţ or of danger following them Exhausted
Exhausted as his strength was, he found some difficulty in removing the fasten¬ ing« of the door , it opened on a cover¬ ed walk, through whose pillars thit vul bore the form of cloisters, he beheld a garden on which the -noorshinc flung its rich and tremulous flood light On Ippoli¬ to panting from the vapours of a dungeon •nd torches, no object could have had such sudden power of refreshment and renoration, as the beams οι the woon, and the breezes of night As he supported his companion, he per¬ ceived with delight, that the current of the air had recalled her spirits, she spoke not, but her limbs heaved, and her eyes unclosed, though without a ray of intel¬ ligence As he now hastened with Kr through the vaulted walk, he distinguish¬ ed all the features of the building lo which the passages were attached The high tufts of pine, and larch, and cypress concealed the lower parts of the fabric , but
but above them he could see the row of small convellimi windows, with lhe antic carvings ot the battlements above, .it their extremii), the great staircase win¬ dow, stained with a thousand colours, tint gave then rich, ionianne tingings to the moon-beams, and the trees that waved around it, bey«md, features still more chaiacteristic of lhe structure appeared , the niched and figured walls, the angles of the buildings surmounted with crosse» of grey marble, and further still Ihe spire of the convent rich with the lantas- tic piofusion of gothicembellishment. As he still ganţed, though he hastened onwaid, he could see .apers gleaming in different parts of the building , and once he thought he beheld a figure passing among the shade at the opposite extre¬ mity of the garden The walk which he had trav ersed, bj this time, terminated in a ponteo, whose light pillars were con¬ nected by trellis-work, and mantled over »Hh
with luxuriant shrubs , he crossed it, and beheld before him an aperture in the girden wall, whos·· fragments lay s« át¬ téred around, through »filili lie behclil the open countiv in all the magic of moonlight He darted through it with an impulse which annihilated weari¬ ness and fear, and found himself on a rising giounti, whose graduni slope, skirl¬ ed with tufts of arbutus and magnolia, led to Ihe brink ofa st earn, whose waters n- flected the turrets оГ the convent Ippolito hasretiidto the bank and depositing his nncoiisuous charge beside it, sprinkled her with water, and unfolded hei vesture to the air W hile she slowly recoveied her intel ligenceand speech, Ippolito gazed on her ¡orm, lovely eien in the semblance of death Her long, dark hm that fell ovei her face and bosom, like the fob i b e ol ilie cypress over a monumenta! mai ble, in¬ formed lum she was not a religious, vet Ihe

and osiers, nodding where their branch» had waved a moment before.

tance of space, or strangeness of hour, were no obstruction to him, ht might caaerge after a subterranean tourney, at Puizoli, or appear again at Naples But one expedient presented itself, the same which under similar circumstances had been suggested to Annibal, that of flying to another country To abide the fixed and regular assaults of the stranger, was not tolerable even to thought, as its con¬ tinuance would not only expose him to aggravated suspicion and danger but to the greater mischief of familiarized guilt, at which he shuddered, for he had already begun to feel its influence The morning now began to pour a pale light through mist and fog on the landscape, and Ippolito looked bick on the events of the night, as on ihe b ui- ness of years That a few hours only had passed since his arrival !.. Bellino the preceding evening, and that into those few hours, so many circumstinces should have
have been compressed, almost exceeded the belief of reflection As objects be¬ came stronger in the strengthening light, he discovered that the ravages «У the late shock had been partial, and almost con¬ fined to that part of lhe country he had quitted , all around him seemed tranquil nd uninjured At a distance he beheld along the banks, the huts of fishermen, starce peering from among the tufts of the thick embowering trees, that love a watery soil, and here and there the sails of lhe г early barks flitting on the d tant AJVtS, like Ihe pinions of the white fowl that skim their surface lie now endeavoured to moor his boat on the shore opposite to that he had em¬ barked from , and it lt ngth, though des¬ titute of any skill in the use ot the oar, succeeded He debarked ne-r a small cluster of huts where he proc íred the ne¬ cessary information with regnd to the distance of l'uzzoli, fiom whtn e he re¬ solved

The old mm spake with the energy of virtuous abhorrence He shook in every limb, and marked himself with the cross wherever Ippolito had touched him , but his tailing voice bespoke a lingering of humanity, which his zeal conicndtd with m vain Ippolito retreit« d from his last appeal The fonili im of hi heart seemed dit« d up and sealed The vitals of huminity were parched and vvithered within lnm He extended his arms, and looktd up¬ ward ' Then I am outlawed of nature I am divested of the rights of being Every ear is deaf, and every h« nt is iron to me Wherever I tread, the solt of my foot dries the etreatm of humanity I have done, but you, Oh, you ' may you one day know what it is to knock at the human heart, and find it shut ' May you know what it is to frt from the hell¬ hounds of superstition, and hear their howl double on jou at every winding' May

pııtments and motions, as it has since been Its principi! seats were then Rome and Naples In the other Hies it only maintained agents who, with the help of the secular irm observed, apprehended mil dispiteht d their several offenders to the principal sens of the office The pre¬ sent agent at P11/70I1 was a Signor Gi¬ berto Angellmi a man of intelligence and hnmin tv There was no regular prison in 'lie town but the number of suspected per¬ sons had lately inneased so much, that they had been compelled fo repair and fortify an ancient structure that had form- eily been a Romín fort and which stood 011 ι mole on the western shore whose waves beat agai ist its hoary bastions mur¬ muring sounds of to the sufferers within 1 hither Ippolito was conducted At another houi his mind would have thrill ed

few moments, as if to coir ince him no such relief was to be expecied, and then glided on as before They now reached an arched passage, where guards, fully accoutered, stalked baikttards and for¬ wards, in silence also Ihey bowed to the person who conducted Ippolito, but at him did not even direct a casual glance The sullen habits of their office seemed to have extinguished all human feeling, even curiosity, the last lhat might be sup¬ posed to linger within the walls of an In¬ quisition His conductor now led Ippolito through a dark, narrow chamber, lo another, more spacious, but equally gloomy , and light¬ ing a lamp attached to the wall, and pointing to a pallet scarcely distinguish¬ able in a distant recess, silently disappear¬ ed. Ippolito threw himself on it, and, reflecting that the influence of the stran¬ ger wn excluded here, sunk into sleep He
He was three days in cunlniemrnt be¬ fore he was summoned to attend ihe In¬ quisition During that period, the soli¬ tude and silence of his prison the noise¬ less step and mute \isage of his guani , the lew and monotonous sounds that reach¬ ed htm from without, the loll of the bell lhe chimes of the night, the w! ι e pered watch word of the guard , and lhe hoarse dashmgof the sea at the foot of his tower— had tranquillized his mind, and poured into it a still and patient melancholy, not destitute of vi ,our, but utterly distinct from sternness On the third day, he was conducted to Signor Angellmi s presence Through the passages he traversed, he perceived day-light gradually diminishing, from the thickness of the walls, and the narrowness of the grated apertures It was almost twilight, when they reached a low door One of the guard touched it with a staff he held, and it opened Ippolito was led
Írd into ι room hung with black, and lighted by a lamp The inquisitor and his secret iry were seated at a table at the upper end Ί he guard Hithdrew 1 here was little of the grim formality of an inquisitomi examimtion observed, save that Ippolito wis seitcd opposite the agent, the prisoners of that tribunii not being permitted to stand dui ing the exa¬ mination When the inquisitor raised his eves beseemed involuntaiilv struck with Ip¬ polito s form and expression and sun et¬ ed h» wild and woe-tinted counteninit with a feeling, Ippolito thought prosi rib- td within those wall*» ' Be so good, cavalier," said he, " as to inform re whether you bear the n ime oí Monto¬ no ?"

• Were you ever in Puzzoli before i" said Ihe inquisitor " Never " " Did you witness any remarkable object on your ar· rival Ihere? Ippolito hesitated The ques¬ tion was r« peattd ' I saw an extraordi¬ nary inscription in the aisle of tue great chur-h What was the reason of the emotions vou betriyed on beholding it ? ' The emotion of surprise was too na¬ tural and general to require an individual to assign reasons for it many others ex¬ pressed the same whom I do not see here You were observed to use some remi Kable words ΥΛ ci c m) w ords then noted by casual observers ? said Ippolito, shocked and overwhelmed at thisdiscovery ' Those around you were not casual ob¬ servers said Angellmi your motions and your expressions have, from the mo¬ ment of your quitting Niples to the pre¬ sent, and for some preceding time, been. in the possession of the holy Office " At this terr ble intimation Ippolito sunk back in his stat, and hid his face with his x S hands.
Ilands He felt like a man, who, believing he has eluded the pursuit of an assassin, traverses a long and dreary path with liope, and just as he approaches its ter¬ mination, perceives that hb pursuer his only sported with h^ destruction , that he has followed him step by vit p anıl ıs prepııed to spring on hım as he reídles the list The inquisitor seemed slıolıth »netted hy his appearance, but rcncitid the examination " Had you," said he, " ever b« held that inscription before ' ' Ippolito, with¬ in whom all power or impulse of re¬ sistance began to ful, admitted he hid. " λ\ hen, and until r whit circumst^nt is'' said the inquisitor Ippolito hesitated, but was too dispirited to construit an an¬ swer, till the question wasrepiattd with solemnity, ' A>k your informer that,' he replied, " and his answers will betray another vutim to the holy Office, his confession will unfold a horrible tale " "He
"Ile h i3 already unfolded it, * said the inquisitor What—is it possible that he has surrendered himself to the judg¬ ments of the ι hurc Ii ? lbs he dis. losed the mvstcry ol his iniquiiv ? Is it possible thit ι \mduition awuti me ■* "Of whom io \on spe ικ ? said the inquisitor, there apptirs some matike here ' Of whom' sud Ippolito with vehemence, * o^the evil one thit haunts and troubles me of hnn who Ins bbstul my exist¬ ence who h s dc ι! d in) cois cute with horrid thoughts who his hunted u e fiom sonet), n d ch sed me into the talons ot tli inq ition ^ ou sprak then of one I am a strinar to said the inquisi¬ tor my informer was an individual of unqutstionible innocente 'It is im¬ possible sud Ippolito ' he could not have obtained his nifoimation if he were, none but agents were witnesses of the transaction Have a care said the inquisitor " If it be impossible that a witncu

to reconduct him lo his apirtment and Ihe inquisitor and his secictiry silently vanished in the obscurity of the chamber. He was led batk to his soluary tower where he had abundant leisure for ihe preparation the mqiMtor hid rcicm- mendtil to him In 1 he hid now no re o- lurion for if His inuit! wis »vi ry wuh miserv, his powers wtak«ncd by «onti- jiaed sufferance were no»v rt laved to that frame, which, out ol great c»cnt ind am¬ ple ranges of view telccts on' tl e re¬ cent and proximate points nd dwt lis en them with minute piriialilv Of his Various and eventful life be only icmini- bcred and revolved his confirtntc with the inquisitor But by whit încins the stringer could reveal the transactions at Naples without acknowledging himoili is a prir 'jjal, or any other person could oblam a knowledge of them, he conjectured in vain Yet even this state of uneasy de¬ bility and helpless fear was not utterly w.thuut
without relief The varying colours of the sky, and aspects of the ocean, the wild scenery of rocks and ruins, that indented the bold cumngs of the shore, and the rnd less varieties their shapes and hues underwent from the transitions of morn to noon of evening to moon-light, with imperceptible gradations, too soft for the quaintest pencil or most curious eye to r ollow, all these were with him in hi« prison The influence of the stianger could not change the eternal forms of nitui e nor prevent tl eir gleaming through the hi^h giated window of hib tower At inten th he e\cn perused the fragments of Cyprians strange story, which had been spired in the search l u, underwent on his entrance into the Inquisition As long as the f untest rav oflight trem- blfd o%cr the wirer or the shore, Ippo¬ lito hngued at his casement, Mudiousty confining his thoughts to external ob¬ jet ts, pleased even to observe the distant x 5 tokens
tokens of involuntary sympathy, lhat were paid to his situation, or its imagined tenant. To observe the fishermen paus¬ ing on their oars, as they glided round the vast projecting bultresses lhat prop¬ ped the rock on which his tower was perched, and shake their heads, as they threw a scarce perceptible glance at its steep and impassable height When the guard silently lit his nightly lamp, Ippo¬ lito producing his manuscripts, would pore over them with unrelaxed attention , not to procure pleasure, but to exclude pain Yet some of these excited his sympatin, exhausted as it was with personal claims They marked out regular periods of life as well as passion, and therefore conciliated a degree of substantial sympathy and vi¬ vid belief, not always accorded or sought in such performances In the fragments he now perused, the writer seemed to have exhausted every drop
drop of the bitterest draught ever held to the pale lip of human affliction—disap¬ pointed passion She seemed to delight herself with imaging the last distress that could be now inflicted or with held, —that of separation from the object she had loved in vain W hether this separa¬ tion was voluntary or compulsive ima¬ ginary or real could not be discovered fiom the lines themselves but to Ippo¬ lito they seemed like the struggles of weak resolution (such as might be sup¬ posed to linger in the breast of a vestal crazed with love ) torturing itself with more list looks at an object it could not accomplish and could not renounce The first of these fragments appeared an at tempt to blend the warmth of passion with that of devotion \ et the pission was neither sanctified nor the devotion softened by the union

FATAL BEVENGE;
THE FAMILY OF MONTORIO.
CHAP I S*va Ptlopii domus HoRACi " Pclops' cruil olTipnng " AeotT the year 1П90, the family of Monlono, one ol lhe most distinguished in Italy, occupied their hereditary seat, in the vicinity of Naples To the tale of the strange fortunes of this family, it may be necessary to prefix a sketch of its character It was marked by wild and uncommon features, suth as rarely occur m those of more temperate climates But in a coun- V«L I I try
try, like the seat of these adventures, where climate and scenery have almost as much effect on the human mind, as habit ind education, the wonder dissolves, and the most striking exhibition of moral phenomena present only the rede« ted consequences of the natural Ihe general idea of the Italian cha¬ racter was fully realized in that of the Montono family, weak yet obstinate, credulous, but mistrustful, inflamed with wild wishes to attain the secrets ind com muuion of another world, yct sunk in the depth of both national and localsupei- stition Their palaces weie haunted by groups of monks, and magici ins and alchymista, and astrologers, and amid the most superstitious state of the country of superstition, the House of Montono was distinguished by weak and gloomy cre¬ dulity The character and habits of the present Count were, like those of his pre¬ decessors, singular In the early part ol bis
Ins Ыс, he had unexpectedly succeeded to Ins anccstonal wealth and honours, by the sudden death of their possessor and all Ins lannly Shocid bv such a con¬ currence of domestic calamity, tht Count had pieiipitilrly quilted his caslle, nor could he, till after a considerable ti nt, piev al on himself to quit A,)uln, and riusi! H When at lt ngl h he ret in ned, /ivs visible that the blow, vvluili his spints hid sustained, was irrecoverable. II« returned -lctompanicd by his Count¬ ess, his children, and a nuniiriis itlinue of ittuuLiiN and Irom that moment the sight or sound of «het r illness ι« as banish« d liom the walls ol Munito Ilıt i t eJ do¬ mestics, who hid к ului t'ici«. in (hi ir lords alísente, and to vslioin t it ubs ncc had ftlt like th ir own evtle, now saw with sorrow, thr the «hiilet hisrslum hid produicd was almost for tlie worst. The hilnis of th evtl«, uut ıı» pre enl possesso-, retailed lo tiıuı memory t'ıe s i former
former master, and the festivity of hap¬ pier days, thiew a deeper shade over the stately gloom of the present Of their former lord, they were lavish in commen¬ dation , and as it is the na*u e of enthu¬ siasm to remember only the \ irtues ot the object it delights to praise, while they celebrated the excellences and graces of his character, they forgot that he had beenjealous, violent, and vindictive even beyond Italian irritability, that his credu¬ lity was without bounds, his rage without restraint, and his vengeance without re¬ morse The many graces however of his person and mind, and the melancholy fate of a man who had suddenly died amid the most exquisite sensibility and enjoyment of domestic delights, drew a shulc over the memory of his failings, and those who remembered him, remembered hnn only as the master whose eye poured forth benignity, and whose hand was lavish of bounty To
То the remembrance of such days and iharicters, the present afforded a striking connast The Count, dark, silent, soli- lan, r«jull n d all approach, retreated fioin all atta« liment , antl when his at¬ tendants raised their eyes to his, it was said they saw an expression theie which made them withdraw them, under an im¬ pure of terroi, intuitive and inexpress¬ ible The temper of a master, however ungennl, soon pervades his household lhe servants glided through the apait¬ menis with steps that seemed to dread their own echo, orders were communicated in whispers, and executed in silence, and the bells that summoned its inmates to rest or lo relig.on, weie almost tht only sounds heard wilhin Us walls bonetimts this talm was suddenly and strangely bro¬ ken, and the Count, attended bj his con¬ fessor, would often summon the family to attend him at midnight to the chapel, where ťiey ïcmained engaged in solemn and se¬ vere
▼ere acta of religion till morning, and often, under still more terrible agitations of mind, he would hurry the Countess and hu family from their rest, and compel them to accompany him by night to Naples, from whence, after a short residence, he would return to his castle, to silence and to solitude A conduct so extraordnnry excited many comments, but the recent mi fortunes, and known character of the fam.ly, were a sufficient answer to ih-se, and curiosity soon grew weary of a sub¬ ject that furnished nothing to gntify in- qury Besides, the Count had now arriv¬ ed at that period of life when a man is chiefly represented by h.» children, when the stronger features of a charicter are dimmed by the distance of retirement and iest —when declining ambition reposes itself amongst those for whom it has toiled, and the hopes and views of society are transferred to its young successors
Of
Of the Count s numerous family, four sons, and four daughters, still .urvived Alt of them partook of the peculiarities which marked thev huuse, the two elder sons eminently Amid the family group, the bo'd and original figure of the Count¬ ess stood alone Her beauty ill!' un¬ touched by ume, her mind unimpaired by the weakness of her sex or country, she y et seemed to share the dark despondency of her husband But while the source and degree of thtir secret suffering appeared the same, their modes of sustaining к were strikingly different His, was the gloom of a mmd bowed by affliction,— hera, of a mind resolved to make affliction bow to it He, waswild, dejected, and unequal, —she, calm, collected, and silent But hei calmness was evidently that of subdued pain, it was the calmness of one, who, stretched itpon the rack, suffers not a groan to escape him Jn the lower circles of domestic duty, she moved with a care¬ le«
les absence, which wasneither the absence of indolence nor of affectation, it was the abstraction of a mind obviously capable of higher occupations, and from which the discharge of common duties neither re¬ quired so effort, nor а suspension of its inward and peculiar operations She pei¬ formcd the severest offices of religion, which her superstitious husbind exacted from her, with the steady patience of one whosubmits to a remedy, but who expects not relief—with her children she took no comfort, from her husband she sought no counsel whatever were her secret trials, she seemed bent to brar them un¬ aided, i'nallied, and alone She presented the image of a great mind sinking under calamity, but sinking without complaint or weakness, like Cæsar falling at the base of Pom pey s statue, but covering his face as he fell Of her children, her daughters appeared tbe mast beloved, a id of her sons, the two younger.
younger, though the elder were confess¬ edly mort the favourites of nature as welt as of society At Naples, the elder, the beautiful and dissipated Ippolito, was the delight of everj assembly, the soul of every pleasure Driven from retirement, from the gloom of the castle and its inma'cs, entitled by his rank to mingle in the first assemblies, and indulged by his father with a splendid establishment, Ippolito, plung¬ ing into all the voluptuous madness of Niples, seemed resolved to indemnify himself for the short restramt of his early years All t he rich issemblage of imagery that vouth talents, and sensibility can present, and flattery magnify and embel¬ lish Ippolito sought to realize 'n his bril¬ liant and tumultuous career Tins the flame of gennis, which should have been fed by close and inward cultivation, was wasted in wild and eccentric blazes, and society, with heedless selfishness, exhausted the powers in who e display it delighted s 5 Had
Had this young man been instracted. either by »asure or by habit, in the con- thret of his imagination, or the conquest of his passions, hu being would have answered some better purpose than the delight of dissipation, or the example of • moral tile Ippohto resembled his mo¬ ther m the graces of a person which re¬ vived the finished forms of classic anti¬ quity —a lace warm with the rich tma· of Italian beauty, a dark-brown complex¬ ion, over which the glow of conversation or of sentiment the hurry of motion or of acadesst.sprradaspeakingcnmson, -eyes, whose lustre, sometimes softened some¬ times oeepened, as his dark locks were parted, or permitted to cluster over then, spoke sensibility in every change—fea¬ tures, over which the very soul of ex¬ pression hovered, in a thousand charms, mingled and mutable Such was the form, that enclosed a mind bold, ardent credu¬ lous, and volatile ,τ -of winch the reason was
wat aa little under regulation as the pas¬ siona. He possessed talents, but he rather delighted in their duplag, than their cr¬ em» —and that display waa of the most fantastic kind He loved to soar into the untravelled regions of thought, to raise the airy fabrics of fancy on vacancy, to eater on the very conţinea of intellect, and bend ovc the world of shadows and ■uneai forms. This mental malady was aggravated by indulgence till no proposi¬ tion struck him, but under the form of a paradox, no event interested him, unless ¿••»kened by a shade of mystery or adven¬ ture ,—but this intellectual obliquity wat only partial, it was confined to hu mode of apprehending, not of pursuing objects, for, when the direction of hu mind was once discovered, by an artful application to its assailable part, its future progres« might be ascertained without the least al¬ lowance for delay or deviation Under the heated and irregular state of mind he had
had embraced the study of astrology, a -tudy of which none bnt those who have travelled know the Influence, which is asgeneral» it is violent, and under which foreign nobility are often known to main¬ tain a professional astrologer in their pa¬ laces, rather as an assistant of habitual knowledge, than a hidden agent of super¬ stition On a mind like that of Ippolno, this pursuit operated with peculiar dan¬ ger, by pointing out, as the subjects of us study, some of the most striking ob¬ jects of sense it tempted a mind but too susceptible of impressions from such sub¬ jects FeAT can resist the emotions inspired by the night view of an Italian sky a view unfolding the Host of Heaven in lustre, magnitude, and number never witnessed and never imagined in our cloudy and contracted hemisphere,—and few can cal¬ culate the awful solicitude to which those emotions swell when the gazer thinks he beholds in those solemn objects the arbi¬ ters
ters of his destiny, traces in their progreas the myiterious movements of fate, and seeks from their position, a knowledge of those events, which all are alike solicitous to know, though conscious that their know¬ ledge can neither hasten nor retard theirap- proach, neither dimmish their certainty, nor mingile their inflictions At first, this study was confined to the more serious events of life, but in a short time, its influence became so extensive, that it mingled in the most trivial, even in those lighter mo¬ ments of which solemn thought is deemed an interruption If this topic was alluded to, the laugh was hushed, the frolic sus¬ pended, and the giddy Ippolito became intensely thoughtful, n laboriously inqui¬ sitive Of this a pr »of occurred shortly after his arrival in Naples, attended by circumstances somewhat peculiar At the gay season ot the carnival, when supersti¬ tion indulges her votaries with a remission of austerity, Ippolito was present at a masked
■Mbed bdi (ivea by ■ Neapolitan of nak. On this gay evening, every hour mm Ыа a new character, and every cha¬ racter wa« marked by some frolic of lerity, or tame sally of wit. Through the gai ıha«, which the softened lights, the iobage, the fountain«, the invisible min¬ auda/, and mingled moon-light, made to F cw m hl e the bower« of enchantment, he glided, «oasetimes aa the shepherd of Quarta·, anıt sometimes a« the hero of Ariosto, he now attracted the multitude by a apontaaeou« burst of eloquence and song, and now entertained a female mask with the moat animating gallantry—at length, weary of frolic, he assumed the •tbit of a domino, and mixing among she group·, endeavoured to receive the amusement« he had so lavishly afforded In a short tine his attention was arrested by a mask who had hovered around the whole evening, apparently unconnected with aay party The dress and figure were 4 fantastic
fantastic, even beyond the licence of a mask ; it had united the characters of a gipsy and an astrologer, under an em¬ blematic habit ; its mask depicted a coun¬ tenance wild and haggard, and its language, unlike the quaint jargon of the place, wu sombrous, solemn, and unusual. This maak had frequently approached Ippolito du¬ ring the evening, yet when he attempted to address it, abruptly turned away. But its language and gesture were inviting, for it sometimes sung, and sometimes scat¬ tered among the groups, the following lines.---------- ¿ I.

On Rosotia di Valozzi, the daughter of a noble family, residtnt at Naples, wee bestowed the most dangerous gifts of na¬ ture, an interesting form, and a mind sus¬ ceptible " ev en to madness All the softer, and all the stronger, modes of this dangerous quality were assembled in her mind —there is a do¬ mestic sensibility which expends itself on the common vicissitudes, and petty dis¬ asters of life, and there is a lofty fíame of feeling which, overlooking the lower modes of human suffering, creates for itself a svstem of heroic dignity, and unaffecting distress The more subtle spirit of both these vas hers, but both purified, blended, and reconciled, the former, without its hack- med parade of daily exhib lion, the latter, without its droud and pedantic inutility —Thus she was prevented from knowing that relief which vulgar and ro¬ mantic sensibility individually enjoy, ( the one

joyment Nature and solitude gradually lead the mind to abstraction,and of abstract imagery, the most powerful and splendid are the presence and perfections oi the Deity Го these, therefore, her mind was naturally elevated, and no impressions from external or temporal objects could pervert the homage of her feelings At the age of fourteen, therefore, never (oncluding that her feelings could have any other object oroctasion of exercise ıhan the present—that any subject of in¬ terest could exist beyond the bounds of a iloister, or Ihe sphere of monasticism, ihc announced her intention of taking the veil within the wall, of th" convent where sht had been educated Her family, too w ealthy for the need ν polity which dev otes the youngır dnyhteis of Itali in families to the veil, heard her resolution with regret and endeavoured to dissuade her fiom her purpose She ìeiraincd index ible, ini her parents were compelled to c i content

You know my fondness for ruins I strolled there after my tiesle I found the great dxvrs closed, and that the work¬ men had entered through a rhasm under one of the shuttered windows 'b I look¬ ed through the cavity, the various fea¬ tures of the view, the fragments of ruin, the rustic groups, some labouring, some gazing vacantly around, and the figure of a boy, who placed in a recess half- hid among the clustering shrubs, bre if lied a few wild noles on his pipe touthed me with that pleasant melancholy, which is suggested by the view of ancient decay and modern apathy, of desolated majesty, and ignorance gazing amongst Us ruins As I continued to lean on a piojcclion of the chasm, unseen, I overheard a con¬ versation, suggested by the place, and such as 1 would live to listen to on a wintry night, by a low, Hitting, em¬ ber fire It told of spirit and shadow, and self-lighted tapers, aad belts that rung
rung untouched within those deserted walls. I listened with curiosity plea¬ santly stirred, tilt I was roused by tome dark allusions I listened, but could not understand, they spake " of the Counts not resting better in his bed, than hie ancestors in their graves, if thote /hingt were known, ' and observ¬ ed that " old, white-headed Michele, in spite of his guarded silence, was too w. II acquainted with them. " Though my first impulse, on returning to the castle, was to send for the old groom of the ehambers, and satiate my appetite for the marvellous with his legendary won¬ ders I had no other object than to pass a vacant hour in listening to a tale that required little effort either of thought or credit I had at least little apprehension of what awaited me little ftar of being in a state like that of one who is gradually -mpelled towards a pre¬ cipice, the terrors of which he can nei- 4 ther
thtr massure nor avoid. Michelo came on my summons. Desirous of full mfor- matian, and aware of his cautious and timid temper, I endeavoured to frame му request skuYiilly " Michelo," said I, " I have often listened with delight to the family legends your memory is so well stond with,—but I am informed you are in «possession of some still more mar¬ vellous and terrible, something you will not communicate to a common ear, and which I hope von have reserved for mine" This address so far from an accusation, and onlv implying a know¬ ledge compatible with the purest inno¬ cence, produced the most terrible effet t on the old man His lips quivered, and his countenance changed, and with the most earnest solemnity he besought me, not to importune him for the disclosure I referred to The impression I received from his agitation was indescribable The vague curiosity with which I had begun the

Little do you know, little alas, do I know myself, if I knew all, or even believed what I have heard, how could I pass the chapel, as I do at night, how could I tra¬ verse these lone apartments, or venture to sleep in that little turret, over the
vtty nom —where the wind sing» so dole¬ ful that if I suffered myself to think I might fancy it was—I might run mad listening to it " I bade him be composed, but the composure I recommended, I was far from enjoying myself My anx¬ ious юте of the marvellous was mixed with other feelings, nor could I, (though I affected to do so) believe the agitation of the old man was occasioned by the nugatory tales of menial superstition He rose from his knees, condemning himself for having " foolishly and wick¬ edly betrayed himself, олегсоте by my sudden question and pierring eye '—I will not harass you with the repetition of menace and intreaty, of expostulation and evasion He at length consented to ad¬ mit me to his lone, remote turret that night, for he still dreaded our being dis- conered or even observed bj the family The night, like every other period to which solicitude adds an imaginary length, was slow io armai.

informed me, that possessor had been ny uncle, my father's own brother Of this man he gave a character that seemed to warm him into eloquence ; he described it as a mixture of the most shining qua¬ lities, and the fiercest passions 11 is love was madness, hi« courage, rashness, his hatred deadly, and his vengeance, though honourable, as the cavaliers in Naples call it, there was no escaping from with life —" All your house, ' continued he, " were much attached to secret studies, your uncle was m particular much versed in strange books and arts, and in a way of going up to ask the stars whether he was to be happy or miserable—Alas, it would'have been better to have asked his own heart —Many a night would my lord pass on the high turreis of hi B castle, and on his descent, he would walk about his apartment for hours, talking to himself about tnnes, and sextiles, and quadrants, and horoscopes, and ascendants, hard words,

called Ascanio, at the castle —" Lven amid all the revelry and mirth on my lord s arnval," said he, " it was whispered by thedomestics, who accompanied them from Naples, that the lady was likely to lead a life of tone, uncomľoi ¡able splendour, for owing either to my lord's jealousy, or some secret cause of disquiet, that even then spread a shade of melancholy over her beautiful face, they both seemed resolved on total retirement—Matters grew more dark and strange, my lady wept in her chamber alone, my lord stalked silently through his, your fathei appea-ed distracted with the distress he witnessed, and alternately conferred with each alone, I suppose, endeavouring to conciliate and soolh them At length it wu announced that my lord was to make an excursion to the Grecian Isles, this excursion the Countess, now near her con finement, was not to accompany, he was to be attended oniy by Ascanio Ascanio, at

column of fire, brighter than noon, rose from the mountain, flashing a horrible glare of yellow light on the woods, and shore, its edgings lanced with lightnings, and its centre white with intense heat, it wu suspended a moment at its greatest height, or appeared so to our eyes, and the next came rushing down the sides of the mountain in floods of fire—a strong concussion of the earth followed, the air and elements were in wondrous motion, and the lightnings, or meteors rather, broad and flaky, hissed and wreathed m fearful play on the turret points and casements When the first burst of ter¬ ror was over, I thought ofthe Countess and her children, she used to sit with them in a high and lonely tower, ol which I scarcely believed but it was crumbled to ashes I hastened up the great stairs, when—the terrors of my tale are coming on, they are too strong for me, let me hav e air, let me have breath.

Solicitous, both for the old domestic and his story, I assisted him to ι ise, and supported him to his narrow casement In a few moments he respired , I watched the progress of his recovery , my eye was fixed on his, it became suddenly fixed and hollow, he extended his arm from the casement, but the breath which he had but just recovered, utterly forsook him— he could not speak—my eye followed the pointing of his finger The night was still and daik, the ruined chapel was beneath the casement—as I gazed, a light, palt but distinct fell on the wal'a, and on the shrubs that have mantled round them, I walched it, it wandered, borne by no hand, accompanied by no step, along the chancel, (I saw it gleaming past our win¬ dows), and expued at the lomb of our uncle Michelo and I remained aghast— we remained near an hour, silent, scarcely breathing—we saw it return Then I tried to swallow down the thick and stifling
ktifling sensation with whuh my throat was filled " Michelo," said I, " has this been seen before ?" " Often, ' said the old man, " by me " " Has no visible form, no distinct sound attended it * ' " Often, ' said he again " And have you ever wit¬ nessed?"— " Listen, Signor, —to you alone would I tell what I have witnessed other strange appearances have long been talked of within these walls, this is but recent A few nights ago, when I first observed that light, 1 was tempted to follow it I thought it might be some one whom cu¬ riosity or ignorance had led there, and I entered without apprehension The licht that glided before me, disappeared at the tomb of Count Orazio , I ! -τ- 1 sound issuing from it, that could scarce be called a groan, or any thing that signifies a hu¬ man accent I approached it, I know not how, I shudder now to tell it, yet I re¬ member I did not shudder then The massive grating of the vault was wrenched open—
open—I descended—yes, I did descend a flash of light burst forth again, and as it hissed on the damp arching, the palls waved with a visible motion—the coffins rattled on the biers—something, I could neither distinguish nor describe, hovered before my eyes—a pressure (not of a fleshly hand ) came over my face, it was bony and cold, and damp I lost all fur¬ ther power or feeling, and when I reco¬ vered, I was laid without the walls of the thapel on the damp grass, my lamp bui ning beside mc, tould I have travelled there m trance ' I li- cd to my turret- room I stood to collect my breath, my eyes fell on that muror you are looking at now ray face reeked with livid streaks of blood" 1 —To none but jou have I mentioned this No one could hear the old man s earn¬ est voice, and look on his pale face, and disbelieve him You know my habit, to voi ι в reason

But Ippolito's curiosity was now as much occupied hy his young domestic, as his brother s w as by his old one Amused by the strange nrtumstances of his intro¬ duction, Ippolito had assigned him an apartment near his own, and exempted him from every office of servitude This was indeed a gratuitous indulgence, for had Cyprian, as he called himself, actually dropt from the sphere of another planet, he could sort e have been more ignorant of every thing relative to this. Ippolito perceived it, and resigned him to his own pursuits The form of Cyprian was slight and dr beate, a profusion of thesnut hair shaded his cheeks, and deepened the dark tint oi melancholy thought, that sat for ever on D S his
bu isçe His head was seldom raised tn>m a declining posture, his feature» seldom varied their pensive expression, but when they did, their sudden and eager brighine« of intelligence, bespoke a mind of suppressed energies, and habituil de¬ jection Though voluntarily assuming a station of serv nude, he possessed all the refinements of manner and acquirement that mark the higher ranks of №ciety Seated at the harp, or organ, Cyprian poured through his delicate halfopen lips a stream of sound) more resembling respiration than tones modulated by art aad practice, they were the very sighs of music , while his fingers, sinking into the strings, seemed almost to partake living sensibility, and forget the power of mo¬ tion at the cadence As a painter, his merit was distinguished, but in all he did, nothing appeared laboured, nothing even finished, he seemed to possess the genius uf art, apparently without its rules or its h bour
labours, and over all was spread a species of fragility, a certain delicacy of imper¬ fection, that characterized the desultory efforts of a mind which only required stability to arrive at perfection But it was soon discovered, that neither as a painter, nor a musician, did he remit that influence which he claimed for higher offices. He enteied on his office of mo¬ nitor to Ippohto wtth a spirit and power that actually seemed given him from above Ippohto listened with surprise, but it was surprise which the gentleness of the pleader disarmed of anger, and mio which his eloquence infused admira¬ tion Turning into jest, however, a conflict wtth a boy, he collected the powers of sophistry and declamation he was too well accustomed to wield, and imagined that a few sentences of rapid bnlliancy, would overwhelm the poor tittle pleader at once But this meretricious array was displayed before
before Cyprian m vam , simple, earnest, sincere, he penned his florid opponent with the eloquence of a man, and the fervency of an angel He was neither dazzled by verbiage nor disconcerted by subtlety, and Ippolito s pride summoned him in vain to the cause which his con¬ science deserted The conclusion of the debate proved that it was not for victory the yonng disputant had engaged, he pro¬ ceeded with tenfold earnestness to press the praitical consequences of his conces¬ sions on Ippolito Such was Au inge¬ nuous pride, that what he could not de¬ fend he dared not practice, and a boy caught the promise of reformation from a blushing libertine But a more difficult task yet remained—to direct the choice of life while it was yet suspended, and to eflect a transition from one mode and habitude to another, yet to conceal the interruption, and prevent the interme¬ diate wanderings of vacane) At this moment
mMfient, tİMrefore, Cyprian displayed «M hiŕrasHtrcet; punting, uxt hamony, WW poetry ; and overall hu tut« spread a «Hrn, chute and mellow, ltk« thet of moon-light on a landscape—bit Ippolito wu delighted by the conscious expansion of latent power«, which he mistook for the acquisition of new ones, and Cypnan succeeded m recalling to the forgotten pleasures of nature and of tute, a mind, fevered by the noxious stimulant! of arti¬ ficial voluptuousness But minds thus habituated are not emily weaned from periodical indulgence, and when the night armed, not all the taste or talent» of Cypnan conld prevent the chronic fit of vacancy. When they failed, even the pensiveness of the little monitor would yield to his solicitude far his pupil, ш the graceful petulance of airy command, he would wind his »lender arms amuad Ip¬ polito, and vnth^emefc btendukmentt, de¬ clare he should not quit tb* palace» blan¬ dishments,

He spoke of earthly things in all their excellency and beauty, being but as a veil spread before the fulness of impassible perfection, to which we are not to look, but through them, he spake of the disso¬ lution of earthly things, as but the with¬ drawing of a veil, when that which it con¬ cealed shall break upon us in alt its glo¬ rious beauty, filling our renewed faculties with a fulness of joy, " auch aa eye hath not seen, nor ear heard ' Ippohto listened,and was "alatoti per¬ suaded to bea Christum "

I set out on such a journey, m the close of autumn As I was obliged to tross the Apukin mountains, I took care to piovide me a host in that wild country, who, as is the custom there, shifted his hut and floiks, according to the vicissitude of the scisons I espected to lind hnn among the woody recesses of the mountains, but after wasting ihc ev ι ning in searth of him, I at length dirtctcd my mule to tne foot ol the mount.ins, in hopes of meeting ι ie oilier hut in which to pass the night In the first I saw, a large company of peasants were assembled round a blazing wood-lire, I joined them, and perceived my old host among them, he was re¬ lating a marvellous tale, to whith I list¬ ened among the rest ft was wild and «trange, it told ol something lliat had been lately seen on the mountains, thi terroi of which had driven thein togetheı •into the valley, tilitt it was, I muld not comprehend, some desciibed it as a good, lul ' r some

Ir was not extraordinary that on Ippolito these lettere should produce an eflect merely «light and partial His mind was not constructed to receive the impressions Annibal wanted to convey Tint some strange obsĹunty had gatheied over the fate of the late Count and his Countess, was plain from every part of the narrative, yet Ippohto, innocent and ndble of mind, perused
perused the letters, not with suspicion, but with curiosity, and in the avidity with which he read a narratine of monders, the observation (relative to his fathers concern in those transactions) which had been suggested to the dark penen ation of Annibal, was totally overlooked by his brother His two predominant passions, love of the marvellous, and love of heroic adventure, inspired him with the thought that some dark act of oppression or νιο lente had been committed the un'bliling of which was reserved for him , and as he thought, of relieving distress or of wn dicating virtue, his cheek glowed, and his frame mantled and dilated with generous enthusiasm He was roused from hrs Ini ce of heroism, by Cvprian, who invited him to their evening excursion Ippolito who was in that state of mmd, which is pleased with itself and us purposes, compii« d , and the smile which, as he assented, hi up his beautiful countenance, gave to it almost an
an angel brightness and benignity Ггот such an expression in Ippohto s face, Cy¬ prian was alwavs observed to turn away abruptly and tremblingly When that face w is partially averted, he would view it, with such a fixedness, as if his very mind waa eye, when it was turned towards him with no marked expression, he would venture, timidi) to look up, but when Ippohto smiled Cyprian shrunk from him, with a ■ick and miserable delight, which was equally difficult to describe or account for They set out It was one of those evenings, of which it is diflicult for one not conversant with Italian scenery and climate to imagine the beaiitv There was a b!a/c of animateli but t inquil lowliness, difased ovir eailli, and sea, and ky , ıhı re vias a spHidonr whuh did not «1 i//le д rithness whith did not satiate, there was not a cloud in heaven, not a dark spot on earth, the eye wandered over
over an extent of view, which its bright¬ ness made seem immeasurable, and rested on it with a fulness of complacency The West, that presented a broad sweep of golden I ght, ıhı sea, that chequered the reflection by the heaving of its waters, and the gliding of its vessels, the wooded windings of the shore, and the promontories clothed ш their most verdurous and lovely hues, endless variety of shape and shade, from the dark brown tufts, to the feathery spray, that quivered in the breeze, and admitted the blue sky through its fibres, the spires and palaces, uhose glowing western flouts shone like jasper and topaz in the belting sun — all these ob eels, seemed to produce a kind ol visible hár¬ mon), as sensibl«. to sucht, as the mingled accordance of sounds to the ear 'f hey ascended a pith they knew, which conducted them to a recess, where sha¬ dowed by the arbutus anil the mangolta, they sat, and surveyed the prospect After
After a silent pause^—" Tell me," said Cyprian, " What is necessary to form a poet, but to be conversant amid such stencry as this ' ' " Many things more are necessary," said Ippolito, "labour, and art, and study, and knowledge, which must be supplied by experience, by ob¬ servation on the mixt forms of artificial life, and by those hereditary habits of as¬ sociation, both of sentiment and language, whith must be acquired by an intimacy with the works of similar authors lie who exposes himself merely to the im¬ pressions of nature, will indeed acquire a sensibility of them, but it will bc a sa¬ vage and solitary feeling, which canaqt be embellished from want of internal cultiva¬ tion, and cannot be communicated, from want of the aids anil colourings of appro¬ priate language " ' Pardon me, ' said Cj prian, " your own observation seems favourable to me you mention habits of hereditary association derived from one poet
poet to a ìother— that this is truc I admit and if it be tri e it n u t follow that the first represi ntati lis wert d stın ö u shed I their fidelity nnd extellence now the early poets must have copied from nature solely for soclity was in a crude and ele menlarv state and of prei ous modtls ihe first artiste can have had none When I mentioned the earlv poets said Ippolito 1 did not mean the abo ngines of Tarnassus the bards of savage tnbes as savage as they—whose effusions were orsi and traditionary—I meant the poets of an age cultivated but not so cultivated as our ow v Nature must in deed be the object of poetical representa tion but it mu t be nature mod I с 1 and conformed to the existn 0 habits and tasle of aoriety ** W ere I a poet sn d C yprian I should invert jour rule and admit the in fluence of pre\ailirg manners into my strains so far as thev were conformable
to nature Γι om that species called pas toral, for instance, I would banish that tum and fantastic garniture which re¬ moves it from every thing with which the observation or Гансу uas ever held allı nice Shepherds laying aside all concern loi the simple objects and pleasures of a pastoral life, to pursue their mistresses w ith speeches, which to them ought to be uuaffecting and unintelligible, cxpcndinp a portion of time which ruial b't can seldom spare, tto talk of pains and pleasures, whieh even refine¬ ment feigns to feel, and whirh here, there¬ fore divest fiction of all imposing resem¬ blance lo truth All this I would exchange for the true and visible imagery of runt life — Гог the little peasant boy chasing the fire-fly, or feeding the silk worm, slum¬ bering in the shade at noon, or led, in pursuit of some wanderer of the flock, to a scene of unexplored wildness, treading with rude awe where his steps are not echoed by a human sound and gazing on ă views,
view», which no eye, save the ej e of the lone genius of the place, had ever before beheld ; or touched with local and rural superstition, trembling in moon-light or in storm, amid ruins, deemed the resort of beings not of this earth Or, if shep¬ herds must be in love, 1 would represent them loving like shepherds, with simple fidelity, with unfutidious jealousy, with services such as pastoral life may require and receive, and with hopes of rustic enjoy¬ ment, such as labour may acqu:-c, and sim¬ plicity relish I am sure an assemblage of such imagery would give pleasure to those who love natine, and Ihose who do not, might find at operas and carnivals, sheji herds and shepherdesses sufficiently tourtlv and unnatural " " You should sludy the poesj of the heretic English, as a penance lor join own poetical heterodoxy,'' said Ippohto, " though perhaps the task would have fetle of penance in it I have been . t'¡n nttd
acquainted some time with the chaplain of the English Fmbassy , he is reckoned a man of literature in his own country, and were he not a heretic, t should think him ι man of sense and probity He tells me, that (from the surly independence ofthe national spuit, from tht roughness of the climate, or from a taste derived from their ancestry ) there is a spirit in their poesy, quite different from that of the conti¬ nental A simple appeal to the strong and common feelings of our nature often made in suth language as the speakers of common lift clothe their conceptions in Of this he dese ibes t>-c effect to be in¬ conceivable by a reader accustomed to the poetry of Italy I rom thtir oramas and poems, remote and heroic adventures are almost banished, and thev turn with more emotion to the indigent peasant, weeping over her famishing babes—to the maniac, who shrieks *on the nightly waste—to age, pining in lonely misery— to
to honest toil crushed in the sore and fruitless struggle with oppression and ad versify—than to the ravin,; princess or the declaiming hero Thev have also a species of poesy among them (unknown 1 believe to any but the noahern nations of Europe,) which contributes to main¬ tain this taste—the traditionary talcs of their ancestry, the rude chronitlcs of a bold and warlike people, of whith the language is wild and peculiar even to tht ears of its admirers, from ι kind of quaint and antique rhythfti whuh ırresı tiblj as sociated in the mind« of the hearers, wnh the thoughts of times long past with melantholy and awe-breathing remem- li- in' These ire the balladi of the West and North of Lurope, ıhev an set to ι simple and monotonous melodv and chaunted with enthusiasm ' There is a nation of pcopU wild and little known, in aWislern island, w hosi national poetry is still rithei and whost hiiinonv

Over the face of the priest was spread a chaste and holy sad¬ ness, such as men may be supposed to feel, to whom the fixed hope of a better life, have made the inflictions of this of light and trivial avail. But the wretched parent wai bowing to the priest, foi having performed the last rites, was thanking hun with the humility of courteous misery, for having for ever removed from him his last earthly stay and h че There was something in the expiession of the old man thus trying to work features, con- • uised Willi anguish, into a gentle smile, to blend the duties of the moment with the wrung feelings of the parent, and not 5 forget

causes, and her motions, yea, and the mighty Mov er himself ' Oh, wonderful ' " " And thither shall we follow, though not now, we shall be there in a space, which to the duration of that world, is as a moment, said Cyprian, " and be assured, that these coot and healthful moments of reposing thought, snatched from the fe¬ vering turmoils of the world, will have an effect that shall not be unfelt or forgotten there. There the best hours of our live* are numbered and valued, and the best of our hours, I believe, are passed amid the stillness of nature, and the silence of thought ' They descended, and returaed to Na¬ ples.

CHAP. VII Tn infloence which in these conferences Cyprian had obtained over the mind of Ippolito, wai ungular and powerful The obscurity of his introduction the pecu¬ liarity of his manners, gave even a hovel¬ ing shade of awe to impressions, of which the character had otherwise been faint and fugitive Not of a sex to inspire love, and still too female like for the solid feelings of manly friendship Cyprian ho¬ vered round hu master, like his guardian sylph, with the officiousness of unwearied zeal, and the delight of communicated punty On
On their return to Naples, Cyprian ob¬ served, that a length of time elapsed be¬ fore Ippohto joined him, though they had quitted the carri ige together, and when he did appear, that his aspect waa strange and altered It wore an expression of ghastly wonder His lips were white, and his eye vacant H" addressed abrupt in¬ quiries to Ihe servants, with the air of a man who wishes to satisfy his curiosity, without betraying the object of it, but from them he learned nothing They " had seen no shape," they " had heard no sound, ' and Ippohto s inquiries seemed suddenly checked by something more than the difficulty of satisfying them Shortly after, Ippohto retired to dress for an as¬ sembly, and Cypnan to his closet, where. In his master s absence, he was constantly employed in writing, and where (some whom the prying habits of an Italian ser¬ vant had induced to watch him, declared, that ) he gave himself up to emotions so terrible,
terrible, they wondered so delicate a frame could support them When Montono returned, his valet was summoned to attend him alone His ca binet wu contiguous to Cyprians who obeying an impulse which his concern for his muter justified to himself, listened at a partition, in a state of solicitous feeling, which the tow, broken sound: that issued at intervals through it irritated instead of appeasing-------At times, the words " strange — fearful —" terrible —and every expression of painful wonder met his ear Soine observation was then made by the servant, of a tendency apparently palliative or explanatory to which Ip polito answered with solemnity " Impos¬ sible, if I have life and sense 1 saw it— three times to-nigh ι, distinct and terrible " A sentence followed from the serrant, which, partly from fhe stretch of meet painful attention, and partly from the answer, Cypnan conjectured to be an inquiry
inquiry about some form or shape It was followed bv some imperfect answer from Ippolito, but of which Cyprian could not discover whether the imperfection arose from the loim being too obscuii ш too homble for description The conference ceased, ind ( vpiun liad caree time to sit d ivvn lu Ins pipi s which he tinned over with sh itv ι 1 1 and a vacant eje, wh"n Monlono ei ι it ihe room He stalked about for somi time gloomilv, then like one who wakens slowly fiom an oppressive dream, he gazed around hnn, and sighed heavily Cyprian, who wished to ascribe to himself the uneasiness that prevailed, lest he should irritate a disturbed spn it, said timidly, ' I ha,e been wilting, since you told me of the English poetry, and this has been the cause of all this foolish em- bat rassment, I was anxious and ashamed to shew it to you " He held out a paper, vol ι г which
Which Ippolito took with a listless hand, tad while he read it, Cyprian watched his couatenaace with an emotion, the fate of hu poetry did not excite.

о 5 Ippolito,
Ippolito, though he perused these lines with the apathy of one occupied by other thoughts, still seemed anxious to escape from them, by tenaciously seeking em¬ ployment. He snatched up the papers that lay before Cyprian, and vehemently began to peruse them. Cyprian, all agi¬ tation, rose, and besought him to restore them.—" They are not to be read."— " You increase my anxiety to examine a composition that is written— nut to he read," said Ippolito, with a languid smile. " They must not be'read by you—to j'ou they can afford no pleasure ; they are a simple tale of woman's tove, and we men believe that women cannot love ; it is a tale not to be told in an hour of levily, or when an intercourse with lhe light, cold characters of the world has hardened the heart, and made it slow to believe, that there are beings, who only live to feel, and who have died of feeling. Choose con« other hour, aiul Iring with you another
another heart I shall make no demands of outrageous sympathy, for I know that the subject is removed too far from the world's line and topic of feeling, to ex¬ pect it Nor do I thmk that real suffering eser sought relief, but in the patience of umnswenng bchtf This is alt I would ask, but this I fear 1 would ask in vain at such an hour from you "—" Cyprian," said Montono, touched by his words, " the frivolity in which vou see me aimeried, rs artilii lai and irksome, I have a heart eapiblc of passion, but the object capa* Ые of inspiring it, I yet seek in vam. It is but a little while ыг.^е I entered society, with feelings ardent in youth, and exalted by hope—those feelings are repelled, crushed almost extinguished I submit to a pitiful compromise with the depraved sjstem of society, I trffe with the triflers of th» day, and languish even for the reiVe hing hope of imaginary excellence. All who ar« beautiful, I can admire
admire, her only, who can loie, can I love "—He claaped his hands, and threw up his dark, ardent eye to heaven, «nd stood with the look and energy of inspi¬ ration—" If such a being evei existed, ' said Cyprian, " there is her history — " And is she yet alive, said Ippolitc, ' and is she to be found f —" No, she lives no more, she has passed away, as few have perished, without note, and without remembrance All that loves to cling round the image and memory of fhe dead, has forsaken her, she perished without a tear, without a memorial, with¬ out a grace ' " 7/ns is a narrative of thoughts, not ot circumstances—no ear heard, and no ej e saw her suflerings, and never did the subject of her sole thought enter into the thought of another It is necessary be¬ fore I begin to read these fragments, to mention to you, that the writer was young in years and in sentiment , the very
very child of simplicity and enthusiasm , an union not impossible in young minds.· She entered into the world, she was sur¬ rounded, dazzled and confused But her feelings expanded, as the eye becomes accustomed to the glare of recent light. In the tumult of new pleasures, she saw an object, on whom she gazed with the smile of new born love, it was her last, last smile — He was indiffcient, because he was unconscious, she never told her love, till its posthumous disclosure was no longer a crime in a vestal ' Ippolito prepared to listen, though it was now late, for every object combined to soften him to attention, the chaste and mellowed light, the quiet apartment, whose floating perfumes just stirred the sense the soothing pensiveness ofCypnan, who concealed his face with his hand, and who reads with the voice of one who fears to trust his own emotions, as he reads—"The first fiagment," said he, " descebes

At this moment, several servants en¬ tered, with each of whom Ippolito suc¬ cessively whispered, and ifter listening with much perturbation to their answers he rushed from the palace, to which he did not return till late the following evening

man, that of confirming the evidence, and fulfilling the purposes of divine interpo¬ sition, and if they are not, 1 shall at least relieve myself from doubts and fears that are becoming intolerable, Ishall probably detect and punish fraud, and certainly possess a resource against future imposi¬ tion " As I said this, I turned my eye on Michelo, but his countenance was unaltered I have indeed no reason to suspect him I now declared my inten¬ tion to visit the apartments that evening, and inquired whether he would be able to procure their keys ' " I have kept those keys for many years, Signor, I enjoyed m my youth extensive trust under your uncle, and itili there aie some employ¬ ments which my lord your father would not willingly trust to others, and which I am therefore still permitted to discharge " Michelo, 1 find, is one who tortures his bearers by perpetual allusions to secrets, of which nothing more than the hints are 5 ever
ever luffered to escape hım , whaawak ens expectation to a painful state of sus¬ pended existence, and leaves it there gasping and unsatisfied, and this not so much from malevolence or casual indis¬ cretion detecting itself as fiom a perpe¬ tual struggle between a mind pressed with a burthen too great for its powe-s, (and therefore anxious to relieve itself by com mumcation,} and the monitions of con science which tell it is not right or of fear, which whispers it is not safe to disclose it I have therefore become accustomed to his manner, an ' forborne to importune him In the dusk of the evening he pro¬ mised to attend me But by the beautv of two succeeding evenings, my fathtr was induced to order ices and refresh¬ ments to the pavillion of the fountim we were obliged to nttend him There, amid the indulgence of every wish and every seme, music and fragrance, flowera and
and feasting, perspectives, through the foliaged lattices, of luxuriant gardens, warm with the bnlliant amber of sun-set, which played on the limits of the view, in a quivering flood of indefinite bright¬ ness of waters and woods, among which distant melody floated, breathing a low and dying note, so sweet, it seemed caught and echoed by the shells of listen¬ ing spirits Amid such scenes we sat in sombrous state, the mute, sad libellers of nature and enjoyment, more like statues that decked the feast, than human beings, partaking its pleasantness The third evening I awaited Michela, m my apartment, and he ainved at the appointed hour It was the dusky still¬ ness of twilight, all wu tranquil in the castle, and the grey light that came paler through the casements, seemed to pro- mite quiet and obscurity We passed hastily through the vaulted cloisters that lead to the lower stories of the tower, and vol ι и then
tiWn openiat a dow, that led to a long ft—af, we seemed to enter on a new iwgte« of tke castle Here all signa of life and habitation seemed to cease, the walk appealed never to have enclosed a kuman habitant The very echoes had a «tnnge hollowness, as if they were for Ae first time awakened by the tread of a human foot We reached another door, which seemed intended never to open, Hichrlo applied one of several keys which ht now produced, and I was obliged to assist him with my utmost strength be- ture It yielded 1 now discovered the foot of a stair-case, which wound beyond the sight, and on the ballustrade of which Michele paused to take breath I as¬ cended the stairs, they were dark and •arrow, and conducted us to a door which required our united strength again to open. Michelo, who had exhausted his ■a the effort, feebly staggered onward when it yielded, and sunk into a seat I followed,
I followed, gaung round me, it wm a spacious apartment, apparently hnpad with faded furniture, but of which nothing could be distinctly seen, for the light that broke through the disnumtled ease¬ ments, and tor ι tapestries of the windows, could only discover its size Michelo faltenngly withdrew the drapery that obscured one ofthe windows I now look¬ ed around the apartment, the decay appeared to proceed more from neglect than from age, Every thing was covered, and almost consumed bv dust all the furniture of a sumptuous chamber was there The bed stood under a canopy, dark and defaced but still retaimng its draperies, its pillars, and its plumage " This was the bridal apartment of the Count Orazio," said Michelo, "here the Countess passed most of her melancholy life, and here' —he turned away I inquired why theseapartments had been «hut up, and why the costly furniture, n t that
that might decorate the most modem apartments, was here suffered to decav in obscurity —"They would perhaps have revived painful recollections," said Michelo, faltenngly " when my lord therefore returned to his castle, I re« eived orders to -emove hither the furniture of those gay apartments, and then to close these doors for eter, an order whith 1 la¬ ment I have been tempted to infringe Again filled with wonder, whith the cir¬ cumstances of the place, and these dark suggestions inspired, 1 renewed mj im¬ portunities to Michelo to finish the t ile he had be_un in the turret-chambir He heaid me with intreasing anguish of perplexity, but with unj leiding resolution His eye wandered round the apartment, as if he dreaded thatevtn the broken and unmeaning words he uttered were over¬ heard " Icannot, I dare not, you know not how I am straitened, "( he wrung his hands, and wnispered in the struggling tones of misery )

May 7th This perpetual struggle is wcrse than either alternative — To do all I dread to dò · — .0 tee hm agam, were only the gmk ofa moment, would it not be better than to wiste life in this misery of un¬ certain debate, which neither possesses the resolution of innocence, nor the en¬ joyments of guilt —what if I see him no more—But why not see him, ever present as he is to my though s — ıs he not per¬ haps more seductive, more fatally lovely, to the eyes of imag lation than of sense? Yes, I mil see him, I will gaze on him, I will discover how unlike the object of my thought, the image of this dream he is, and then I shall cease to think of him May 16M I Лапе again seen him,—I am yet breath¬ less,—I cannot yet look into my mind, yet let me think—yea, I have thought enough now for life I shall think my liverlong
live-long convent hours away —Oh, he is gloriously beautiful What thoughts hover around his image, like music «ti earning before the approach of aerial v mitant , like the clouds of amber and rose that invest «nd mingle with the form of some fine creature of the elements. In such a gay blaze of mental brightness he burst upon me—When the tints ofthe evening gathered round the group on the Corso, 1 hoped, I dared to hope, he might pass—in the obscurity he might pass without seeing me—my sigh would b" unheard, my burning cheek would onlv be felt by me —I might see him, I might even touch him as 'ie passed Among a group near me, I saw a plume that ov ertopped the rest—it advanced—oh the tremulous pant, the suffocating swell of expedition,—I could not believe it for very excess of jov—he approached , I saw him not nor heard him, it was aH mist and darkness with me then, out I felt-
Jelt —it was he, and I felt he was gone His departing was like the dying swav of a scented gale, rich, languid, overpower¬ ing, from that moment there was a deli¬ cious sickness m the air, there was a soft oppression at my heart, I could not speak, and had any one spo en to me, 1 feel I must have answered with my tears All night have I sat, repeating to myself at long intervals, " I have seen him ' —Morn¬ ing is now dawning through my chamber, yet still is evening and the Corto with me------- May iOth Can I remain in thu state of dotage ?

believed my heart and treasure were Mine were the pure pleasures, the hallow¬ ed hopes, the calm, corrected mind, a light that flowed from heaven shed a glad and quiet brightness around me, and I rejoiced to walk in that light The morn¬ ing awoke me to prayer, at night I paus¬ ed upon the blam'Ieu day, and sunk to sleep in prayer I reckoned that every day should be like the last, as free from guilt, as far from pain, that I should float on their equal motion, as on the wings of a cherubim to that place of which I believed my enjoyment certain and near Is it so short a space ' And am I so already loit?

his name to the ear of midnight, with ttleot stealth, in the deep and silent hour, when the night-tapour, fine as aa infants breath, stands in the air—when the leaf of the poplar and the aspen is unmpved— when there is a hissing in the ear for very stillness—then I love to lean from my casement, and utter his name—once and softly then swift, and bright, and throng¬ ing myriads of images, float m glittering play around me Then the early morn, the tepid glow, the vernal birth of cherub-passion, rushes on me The first meeting—the rapturous flutter of young alarm—the expansion of a new sense—the opening burst of a world of pleasure These are with me^— his n ime makes them present I am ab¬ sorbed in them, I rush on with their un¬ conscious now Some um¿c of new and daring indulgence arrests me—I start, I recoil—but I only recoil to see I have gone so far "lis less impossible to go ι 5 too

Letter from Annibal di Montera \ bav* been so tossed with doubt and distraction, since I wrote to you that I have been unable to form one sane re¬ flection, or to divide events from the feelings that accompanied them I de¬ ferred the continuance of my letters, there¬ fore, in hopes of willing them at length in calmness, and in eise The hope has been fruitless The eitraoidi naiy cinum- ttantei in which I have been engiged« have deprivd me of all dışlın« t powers of discrimination
discrimination and reflection, they are so woven into my habits of thought, that I feel myself able to do little more than to describe them , and even that, not as a spectator would, and as a philosophic mind would wish to do, but with all the confused perceptions, the superstitious minuteness, and the weak amplifications of real and present lear I know not whe¬ ther you will prefer this to a more com¬ posed atcount or not, but if you do not, you must compound with necessity ; for it is the only one my present state of mmd enables me to furnish you with The night was approaching, on which I had determined to re-visit the apartments, and to suffer Michelo to tell his tale I remembered how I had once been over¬ powered by fear, and once by pleasure, and I now determined to collect every power, and confirm every resolution that could pi eserve me from the influence of weakness or of deception I even
I even perused some of the old legend* of our library, thit abound in adventure similar to mine, I endeavoured to ait a personal part in ihe nárrame, and t shun the weakness, or acquire the fortitude, which their various agents exhibited I passed some time in this mental disciplin¬ ing ; but I find ineffectually, if its influ¬ ence was to have preserved me from fear As the hour approached, my wish to view the spot I was to \ ısıt so soon be¬ came irrepressible I ventured on the terrace that leads lo the tower, and I found myself under the walls of the apart¬ ment , its appearance without resembled that with'n, dark, lonel), and deserted I saw a range of windows, which from their d.reciion, I conceived lit the long passage through which I had been con¬ ducted by Mithelo They were narrow, ■nd dismantled, and at a distance from the ground, but many cavities in the walls, together with fragments of the battlements
battlements that had fallen on the terrace, assisted me to climb to their level, I now looked round mc with security I had taken a time at which the servants were engaged in a distant part of the castle, and I enjoyed the leisure of full gratifi- lalion I looked through the window, it lit the passage as f had imagined , the passage appeared, as on the night I had visited it damp and diiskv, and solitary, but, as by holding my face parallel to the window, I looked down its deep length I unarmed I saw a figure issuing from the will at the other end, and ao- ptoathmg wiih a slow, unsteady motion That it was a human figure, I could on'y conjecture from its loose garments, of which the darkness still prevented me from distinguishing the shape or habit It advanced—nor was it with a pleasant emotion that I recollected it must pass by the window at which I hung It advanced, its head was coveied, one arm was ex¬ tended
tended, and the dark d r ι pery whuh hung from it, shrouded the fice 1 was so ab¬ sorbed in wond r and curiosity thit till it drew within a few paces of the window, I forgot my station would discover me , I relaxed my hold, and concealed my head under the large pediment of the win dow It passed, and though I felt through the shattered casement pannels, the air impelled by its aoproach, Hs step ga e no sound, I raised mv heid, it had passed, and I saw it floating away in the distant obscurity of the passage 1 lingered long under the casement, butther« was neither sound nor object Of what 1 had seen, 1 knew not what о think, that it was not MicheV, I was certain, and no otlier being had means to enter those walls, except by such means as I was almost impelled to believe that form was master of I loitered in vague and unsatisfied conjecture, till the hour at which Michelo had promised to attend mc, »hen that arrived,
arrived, he joined me, and employing the same precautions, we reached the apartments unobserved Michelo again paused to recover himself from fear and from haste, and I eximined the apart¬ ments, witt more leisure and a better light than the last evening hid allowed " Signor, said Michelo, retailing me, ' I h ive led you hither that I might men¬ tion without interruption, and without feir, what in any other pírt of the castle I might notsafcly mention not even in my own remote turret at midnight, I came hither to shun the suspicions which I fear are already excited, thos>e obseivations which I dread our frequent conferences may suggest, and which it is impossible to exercise here ' Of this position I felt not quite assured but concealing what 1 had seen, desired him lo proceed —My attention was that moment excited by a strange appearance on the floor " Can this, Micheto, be the etTect of the shade å which
which these closed windows throw on the floor '" Michelo was silent " See where it spreads in long, and dusky streaks, and ends just beside that door "—·* It is blood," said the old man, shivering — "Blood 1 " I repeated, "this stain that overspreads half the room' impossible; to produce this there must have been a massacre, not a murder m this apartment ' " It « blood,' said the old man, rising, and feebly following me, as I examined the traces—" here it fell, and here, splashes of it are on this wall, as if it had been forced out by violence, and at this dooi, all appearances of it cease "—I paused, all those dispersed causes and ip- pearances, that had hitherto floated vague¬ ly in my mmd, exciting only a partial and unproductive emotion of fear, or won¬ der, or anxiety, now rushed on it with collceled force, and produced one appall¬ ing conviction " Here has been murder, Mithelo, and you who know in whose veins
veins this blood has flowed, you who were perhaps present at that hour, a wit¬ ness to that deed, you preserve an obdurate silence, though perhaps your strange suffeungs are owing to the visits of the victim, ihouith perhaps it lin¬ gers near this spot, where its blood was poured, unabsolved, and unrequired ; though perhaps its s ludless form was seen to-night, wandering in the passages of this chamber ' —" Pursue your path," said the old man, with solemnity, " ν hi¬ ther a hand mightier than mine seems to conduct you , I can lead you but a little way, my time is brief, and my task restrained, I would willingly have fol¬ lowed on, but a power, I may not resist, with-holds me '—Pursuing the traces, we had reached the other apartment, here they had ceased, but in my impatience of discovery, I again adverted, to the jarring looseness of the floor, and the damp and death-like steam that floated through it I strode
I strode across the room, tt shook under me; frantic with impatience, I resolved to rend the boards asunder, a task my Strength would have been easily equal to, and which would probably give some re¬ lief or object to my mind, which now eould scarce support its feelings, wrought up as they had been to a pitch, solemn, severe, and terrible —" Forbear, forbear, Signor, said Michelo, " solitary as tbese apartments seem, there is one who visits them, the Count, your father, I have too sure proof, repairs, at the appointed time, to these chambers, oh, fear his vengeance, should he discover that other feet beside his own, had trod these bloody floors, his vengeance is terrible ' — " Twice," said I, eagerly grasping at his Words, " twice, Michelo, have you utter¬ ed these words, that they have a meaning beyond common fear is evident, and whatever that meaning may be, 1 will know it before I quit this spot what have yuu
you known or felt of his vengeance ? ' " His vengeance is terrible, ' said a voice, deep and distinct, beside me '· Again you have repeated it," I said, for impa¬ tience had confused my perceptions " I spoke not, I breathed not, ' said Michelo, aghast, and clinging to me, "a voice issued from the wall, quit this spot, for holy St Gennaros sake, quit this spot, if yet we may quit it alive I was not, like him, congealed and tendered helpless by fear, but I suffered perhaps more from the keenness and strength of my own perceptions Resist it as we may, the presence, or the fear ofthe presence ofthe dead, is almost in¬ tolerable We endure it in a tale, because it is a tale, and the consciousness of fiction produces a balance with the pain of credulity But I was oppressed by evidence that appeared irresistible, and 1 felt the natural fear, which 1 have in common with the peasant, and the child, vol ι к and
and which my improved perceptions per¬ hap· magnified with many an unfelt and subtle circumstance of addition I deli¬ berated a moment, a gush of visionary heroism came to my mind, and I resolved to examine the flooring, when Mithelo, unable to speak, grasped my arm, and pointtd to the opposite wall My eye followed his involuntarily, they resttd on the figure of an armed man in the tapestry, whose bold and prominent out¬ lines rendered it even strongly visible in "that dim light Λ weapon which it held, waa pointed in the direction I was about to explore, the head was thrown back, and the features of a strong prolile were fixed on the same direction As 1 ga/ed on il, the large eye appeared to live, it moved, it looked at me , it turned lo the spot, to which the atın pointed, and the aim vibrated with a slow and palpable motion , then all betame lifeless and dis¬ coloured and dead, as an artificial form What

we exchanged was observed and inter¬ rupted The night at length arrived, onr dull and regular household dispersed, I retired to my apartment, my thoughts were occupied by the purpose of the night, and I entleavtiuicd to banish from my recollection the « lrcumstances th t had attended my lit visit to the chapel 'i he) rose bclorc me in sti ong shape and tlearness, I siw them on cvtry 4ile, as I stalked atit) s my cliambtr I Ult ťiem, as I endeavoured to heave tlieni oft my breast, pressing on it, a thick and impal¬ pable weight \\ ith them came many a disastrous pitsage of untertain evil The whole ghastly troop seemed to bc array¬ ing for the entounter at midnight, m the tomb My terrors increased, and though I felt that Michelo s ai rival was but the signal for Ihose terroi to commence, I yet longed for his a¡y iacii, for the pre¬ sence ota human being — ihis struggle m 5 of
of involuntary meditation was interrupt¬ ed by a noise at the door, it was Miche¬ le —'· Hush, Signor, it is I, are you pre¬ pared?'—"Iain "—' I hen come, Signor, but speak and tread boftlv '—" Why this caution, have not the family retired'' " All, Signor, but the pag-s who are now assembling to watch in my lords chamber L'ut then, Signor,' —" What then, whv this hesitation ' —" 1 here is one in this house,' pushing his pale face close to me, and whispering ' one who never slcips or il he does, can tlo all the ittions of of a living man, vea, and more, while be wouUl seem to sleep —" Absurd, Michelo, banish these dreams of fear " Nay, Signor —but I am silent,.—tread softly, however, Mgnor " We proceeded through the gallery with cautious steps, we had now reached the stairs, when a distant sound was heard, » Чагк, ' said I Michelo turned round, and starttd on observing we were near the a- partment
partment of Father Schcmoli Hecc nu- nicated this in a whisper " Proceed," said I. " I saw the confessor retire to his apart¬ ment an hour ago '—" ι es, ' mullerid Mi¬ chele, " but heaven knows what apaitmenis intlosehimnow '—-We desi ended thestair- case, muffling our lanthorn, and s'arling as the wind shook the casements, and the steps creaked beneath our tread We reached the great hall, anil stole through it almost without touching the pave¬ ment Tho deep and midnight silence, the dampness and dull echoes of the marble floor, the huge and dusky htigbt ofthe walls and lool, over whith our single lamp shed a dull, unpi rang gleam, made our passage appear like a progress through a vault Mithelo applied the key to the great door, and I wrapped my tloak about the lock to suppress the sound while he turned the key Wonder not at tlusfeeble minuteness, I cinnot think of mvself, * ci eeping
creeping along in »ilence andın fear with ont wishing you to accompany me for sufferings whether volnntiry or not we always expect some compensation either of participation or of pity —We issued into the Outer court ind I felt refresh ment in the air of heaven, though it blew damp and sultry We now entered the chapel and hi vmg reached t ıoughmany ruinous ob structıons the tomb of the lite Count We concealed our limps muffled our cloaks about us so as to conceal as much of the human form (if seen) as possible and lurking behind a projecting pediment of ihe tomb awaited the event in a state of ieeling difficult to describe—There wis nothing to relax its intense and severe controul Theie was no external sound no light no motion It was one of those nights, in which you feel from time to time a hot blast hissing past you that sinks again into silence A night m which
which the dark and heavy clouds seem to be working with inward tumulti, in which, from expecting a storm long, we begin almost to wish for its approach The moon, often struggling through the clouds, tinged for a moment their sombrous and surging masses, with a bright and sudden light that vanished in a moment, and the night-dews fell with almost perceptible damp and heaviness. On the dubious features of the structure, tombs and monuments, windows dusky with foliage, and arches shapeless in ruin, these bursts of light and darkness played with such shadowy influence, that he must have had senses not easily deluded, who tould be convinced he saw nothing more there than might be seen by day I, however, felt that my situation re¬ quired me to collect firmness, not to dis¬ sipate it, and I attempted to converse with Michelo.
Michelo, " Tell me," said I, " why, when the vaults of this chapel were already nu¬ merous and spacious enough to contain the remains of our familv, why was a mo¬ nument erected for Count Orazio, for one too, whose end, I have reason to believe, Was obscure and tragical ' And why, above all, was it erected in this ruinous and deserted pile, instead of that withm the walls of the castle, which is still fre¬ quented by the family " *' There is a strange report. Signor," whispered the old man, " concerning this tomb, and the reason of its bemg built Many things had concurred to drive it from my memory, but your inquiry has recalled it lt is needless to. remind ) ou, Signor, how much all your illustrious fa¬ mily have been attached to secret studies But of all, the Count your great grand¬ father was most engaged in them He devoted his entire soul to them, nay, some said so in such a tone, as if they wished
wished to be understood literally But, oh ' Signor, what am I saying—rest hie bones, they be within a few steps of us '' " Why this interruption, Mithelo ŕ '—" Is it not fearful, Signor, to speak of the dead, when we feel them to be so near us 1 ' lhe effettof this observation on my¬ self, I endeavoured to conceal, by urging hun to proceed " Well, Signor, ( lower¬ ing his voice as if to deceive the dead,) be that as it may, no power could drag him from these studies, and at length it was said he had invented by his art, a glass, that could shew him every event and person he wished to see lt is cer¬ tain, that after his decease, my Lord, your grandfather, spent many days shut up in his fathers closet—examining and des¬ troying his instruments and books, and 'tis said, strange and doleful soundi were heard to issue from the room while he wu thus employed But the task was an invo¬ luntary one, for I have heard the Inquisi¬ tion
tion were beginning to consider his pro¬ ceedings as offensive, and had actually dismissed their ministers to examine into them and to search the castle ' Ahttle before the old Count s deith he is said to have discovert d by his wisdom that there was a spot in the un u of the castle which would be the seat ' « lamity and destruction lo the fimily tl- imme¬ diately set himself to disto er wheie this spot might be and 1 tontlude that if it required so much skill lo f nd out th I it did exist, it re«|uire 1 still n ore to diseover where However, your great ^rindfather was in no wise dismayed he | tirsucd his point lesolutely, and at Itngth distovered the fatal spot to b« the very one on which we now stand — What' the spot m winch tins tomb has been built '- ι he same, Signor I have htard that the Count apprized his family ol this circumstance, but the discovery slumlxred unnotued, till your untie, Count Orazio, hearing of it.
И and being as I have mentioned, much v« red m those studies himself, ordered a monument for himself to be erected on the spot hoping by this means to fulfil, and vtt to avert the prediction—to defeat· yct not appear to defy it " I iw that connected what I had wif- ne sed on this spot, with what I now lıı a d could blame lilt emotion to which I yielded for a moment But, though the denunciation was terrible, there is a so- lemnitv in whatever we suppose to be connected with our fale, that divests it of the hideoi s ghasttiness attending other s'lbpcts of supernaiural aspect, and that m u ks the bounds of awe and of horror — Urder a d cree, the mind bends in con¬ trolled and gloomy passiveness, appalled but not convulsed—without the relucí¬ ame and revoltings of visionary terror As the attempt to relax my feelings had been so unsuccessful, I turned for relief to silence and to meditation —The bell tolled twelve —— Michelo
Michele now, eagerly, but still whisper ing, said, " look, Signor, look, through this chasm in the wall you may see — nay Signor, lower, yet lower·—-you must bend, Signor, —now do you see, Signor, a Irag- ìnent of the caslle, just above the great stairs? — I do see that part ol the castle, which I believe tobe adjacent to the great stairs " " There, Signor, ıs Father Schemoh's apartment, that part of the tower, and that nairow window, in which you see a light burning, belong to his oıatoıy — now Signor, every night his limp is to bt seen in that window till midnight and ever when the bell tolls it is said to disap¬ pear, nor, from that hour, can he be found nor tan it be conjetlured, wheie 01 how he и employed —this onl) is known, he is not to be found in his apail- ment But his friends, it is said, jre at no loss to find employment for him — Sometimes he holds a feast with them m t'ıe
the vault—and sometimes he mixes in procession with them, through that tower, ind sings in their unholy mass at midnight " What words are these. Michele, and what is ihcir import 5 " " Heed not me, Signor, mark the lamp , see, Signor, see, it grows dim, and more dim, and now it is gone— Holy Peter—it will be with us momently. ' The emotion with which I had watch¬ ed the extinction of the lamp, I endea¬ voured to resist, as the cause was utter¬ ly inadequate to excite it—" And what are we to in" a r from this, Michelo* IheConfessor та_, be permitted to extin¬ guish his limp at midnight? " Ah ' but. Signor, (depressing his voice to its lowest tones,) tıs Irom that mom-nt that strange appeannies at thi, lonb are said to com¬ mence —■ Of the truth uf thit, we shall then soon bc enibled to judge, said I, endeavouring to derive fortitude from the inttlligence The expectation which it suggested, scarce permitted mc to draw my
my breath I ro limited to gaze vacantly, but fixedly for I knew not in what direc¬ tion to exp'ct the approich of this visita¬ tion " 1 ook, look, Signor," Michelo ex¬ claimed, " look yonder,—now, Signor, do you believe now do you behold ' '—As he spake, a light resembling that we had once before seen, a pale, dull light, appeared moving along a passage, which opens by an arch into the east wing of the ihipel In armze I observed it issue from the lower end, where 1 knew theie wat neither door nor aperture I marked its approach, for it was slow it seemed to hnve proceeded from the ground, gradually arising and advancing, and looking dim, tremulous, and sepul¬ chral Michelo, leaning across the angle of the monument, grasped mv aim, there was no sound, the very wind was still, 1 heard the beating ol my heait At this moment, the moon nding over the billowy clouds,
clouds, poured a broad and suuiu-n light through thit passage It played uncer¬ tainly through the rifted ι oof, and fell full on the ar«h communicating with the chipel In that instant I beheld a figure standing beneath the arch, a dark gigan¬ tic figure, its form and altitude I could not discover, the light was bnef and sud¬ den, ind the vision confused and imper- fett, but I discoveied, that, as if folded in its vt ture, it held the light we had seen and wluth, in the moon-shine, was diminished to a small, dull twinkle I pussid Muhclos arm in token of obser¬ vation, he letuined the pressure, neither of us spoke,—all was dark—even that pale light had disappeared —" He has seen us, murmured Michelo —" Hush," saidl, "let us await its appioach in si¬ lence ' —" Something is near, ' said the old man, " I fed the ground near me pressed, as if by feet ' —" Ilu^h," said Í, " all is silen,, a body cannot move with- 2 out

Michele s faint voue of dissuasion was tost in the wind that sighed hollowly through the aisles I clambered out from my lurking place, and endeavoured to feel my way in the direction of the light and of the figure, for the central aule was now totally dark I advanced a few paces, I felt something rush past me—not with thr distinct and alternate step of a hu¬ man foot, but as if it glided above the earth, and was borne on without effort I paused, and extended iny arms—they encountered something that felt like a human hand, raised, and extended, and as it were, pointing onwards, I now call¬ ed aloud to Michele to turn the lanthorn, and to guard the door of the vault By the noise that followed, I conceived he attempted to obey me, but at that mo¬ ment a cry of horror burst from the tomb, the light disappeared, and the door of the vault, closed with a thun¬ dering crash. —All remained m silence and
«nd darkness.—I slood petrified, I called on Michelo, and shuddered at the echoes of my own voice—I attempted to move, but felt as if a step beyond the spot on which I stood, would be into a gulph At length I broke from this trance ol fear, I felt шу way to the tomb—I called on Michelo again , believing him to have swooned I felt all the pavement and pe liments with the hilt ol my sword— Mich lo was not to be found, the tomb ajip and to have opened her mouth, and sw Mowed hi η up I appliid my utmost strength in vain to the door of the vault, and though 1 ilmost exp tted it to burst open, and disilo t a sight that would sear the eye, or unsettle lhe brain—1 yet persisted to stiuggle with fi antic forte no succi ss attended my efforts, no sound encoiuaged thcni Once i thought I heard a tow and ftcbte moaning-^but it was lost in that tonfused and humming sound, with which tbe etloit to listen intcn ely, filled
filled my ear Fear and shame and im¬ patience distracted me,—to force the wretched, reluctant old victim, to a pur¬ suit from which he recoiled, to betray him into the very grasp and circle of it, to leave him expiring amid horrors, of which even to think was not safe, to do this, was fo me impossible The being at whose approach I hid shuddered I would at tint moment have encountered and grippie«! with to rescue his miserable prey but there was no hope and no power of assistance I could not rend open the vault, and to alarm the castle, would be to draw on us from my fither s resentmei t consequences as ter¬ rible as any power could menace us with More than an hour was spent in fruitless efľortsand expedients, at length, I conceived it possible toi ouse some of the servants who were lodged in an adja¬ cent wing ofthe castle and by rewards to secure their ¿ilence with regird to the ob- voi ι n jett
ject for which their services were required It wu when I moved from the cha¬ pel to execute this puipose, that I felt terrors of which I had been before insensible. Alone, at midnight, among the dead and their mansions, and pro¬ bably near to some being, whose influ¬ ence and image were the more terrible, because they were undefined and un¬ imaginable, because they hovered, vvith a dim aspect of uncertainty, between the elements and agency of different worlds, because they tould not be refer¬ red to any distinct or sensible point of fear, nor admitted of any preparation against them, such as men can always make against a hyman foe, and some¬ times against an invisible one Haunted by these fetlings, I jet mov¬ ed on The nigh» was now siili and dark , and in the mas^y lint of shapeless dark - ле Æ, which the «asile spread before me, 1 would have given hall its value to have α distovered
discovered onespark of light there was not one In thit deep stillness (which made the echo ef my steps seem like the tread of many) lhe slightest sound was not lost I had almost reached the castle- terrace, and was debating which wing to approach, when the hoarse and heavy giating of the door of the vault reached my ear —I paused —I heard it close Doubting, fearing, vet wth a vngue ex¬ pectation of relief, I hastemd back — Λ light breeze waved my hair as I passed, and the volumes of cloud and vapour, floated İnek fiom the east, like a daik «urtun-fold, and the moon stood с «Im and bnght, ina deep azure field, tinging the frartured and shifting masse, with silver is Ihey retired I blessed it, and wondered how often I hid br Hi! that lovely light with ajialhv, or with plea¬ sure, in which sympathy lor the benight¬ ed whom n «hcercd, <n for the wanderer whom it succoured, had ηυ share, η 2 · I sought
I sought the aisle again The moon poured a Ii -hr as broad as day, through the windows I saw the tomb of Count Orazio I beheld a figure seated on it, I advanced in hope and feat It was Macheio —he sal like a manner, who leans on a bare and single crag after the tem¬ pest and the wreck, he was haggard, spent, and gasping —I rushed to hnn, but he appeared not to hear my moving, his head was raised, and his look fixed on ihe arched passage, the moon-light pour¬ ed a ghastly and yellow j- ilcness on his stilt features I looked m his eyev, the) were hollow and glazed, I touch d his hand, it was cold and dropped from mine I shuddered, and scarce thought him au earthly man A moment reproached my fears, and I ti ied to address some words of comfort and inquiry to hnn, but I was Tepelled by an awe in which I scarce thought Michelo an agent " Woe, woe/'çroaned the old man, with a voice
a voice unlike a mortal sound, his arms rais¬ ed and outspread, his eye wild and dilated, his whole wrm and movement rapt ^nto a burst of prophetic ecst-cv I involunta¬ rily retreated from htm " Alas, how is it with vou, Michelo' let me conduct vou from this spot, never will I forgive my¬ self for having forced you to it Haste away with me, my father may rouse in the night, the domestics may be sum¬ moned to attend his vigils in the chapel, and wc shall be discovered, hasten back with me, Michelo — ' Woe, woe, woe," said the old man again, and bowed his head, and fell on the pavement 1 borçlum from the chapel in my arms, tottering for the weight of cgeand insen¬ sibility is heavy T ne au seemed to rev ive him , and I saw, by the moonlight, some¬ thing like colour, come to his dead face again As I gazed on, and spoke to him, a shadow stronger than the waving of the cypi ess-boughs, crossed the spot I look¬ ed
ed up, I beheld issuing from behind the buttress, against whuh 1 leaned with my burthen, the dark, and shapeless form I had beheld— (lhe moon disappeared )— It passed me, and proceeded towaids the castle I gasped, but could not speak to it—I stretched out my arms, but had no power to pursue it—It floated onward, and with these eyes I beheld it entei the wall of the nstle It was at lhe solid but¬ tress angle of a lower, whose stiong line was visible in the shade, there was nei¬ ther door nor apertur , but thcie was neither obstruction nor dehy lhe moon burst forth agun as it retired, ind Michelo unclosed his weak eve on its beam He rose tremblingly, I supported him We proceeded towards the с islle , neithei of us spoke, but he moaned heavilv, and closed his eye from lime to timi W e reached the great hill, the door of which we had left open, all power or vsish ol niipiirv died vutlun me W hi η
When we heard our steps on the pave ment of the hill and felt we trod in the house ofthe living Michelo with a falter¬ ing hind made the sign of th·· cross and swooned again I hid much difficulty in bringing him to my apartment and often I thought I heard sounds thit passed me and f«lt a motion in the passages other than whit mvself occasioned but I wis in a state ol mind in which it is diflicult to avoil the lliu ins ol fear When revived ind recover« d he implo ed to be led to his own apirtment His eye wis vet wild ind his woids were inco herent I hesitated I ut yi Ided to his earnestness— lead me Signor sii«! he to my turret other hinds shall bear mc fiom it lead mc to my btd a better rest than it shall give me is near ' I attended hnn 1 hid forborne to impor¬ tune him but the wild resolution the mystery of his silence wrought with my abated fears of his safet) to excite а soli¬ citude

I seated him ш his chair, I trimmed his lamp, and de¬ parting with a reluctant step, asked, *' Michelo, what have you seen ; "—" The secrets of the grave," said the old man, without a pause, and without a whisper. His boldness emboldened me " And dare you relate them, Michelo ? —" And dare 5 ou lbtcn to them, if İdare 5 'said the old man, hxing his eves, which shone with strange light, on me " I dare—so help me heaven, andali the saints, as no weak, personal concern or fear mingles in the spirit with which I await the deve· lopn'ent of these mvsUnes "—" No more to-i i e ht, Signor, ' said the old man, re¬ lapsing into weakness, " leave me to¬ night, leave me to silente, and to heaven 1 have need of prayer and ol preparation , iuy ume is bnef, and my task temblé But come to the turret, and knoek to¬ morrow, and if I be alive, I will answer you "—lie iell before a crueifix, and prayed

" So may He to whom I am hast¬ ening,

His vociferation, his eagerness, and his air and figure, which exhibited a kind of splendid and dissolute madness, had drawn all eyes on him But they were diverted by the appearance of a stranger, whom I can no more describe, than I can define the impression his presence appeared to make on the company and on me He was clothed in a long, loose, dark cloak, that completely concealed him He wore a mask, over which the dark plumage de¬ pending from his hat, hung so as almost to hide it He moved along with a slow stride, appearing to know no one, and to be

the demand grew more vehement, the harp was brought, and he sat down with tad and sore reluctance to an employment remote from its congenial scenery and »pints He touched it with a trembling hand, its broken tone« seemed, like him to mourn their altered destination The times, when he had hoped the exertion of hu talent would have cherished sensi¬ bility, and delighted virtue when the grateful silence of praise struck more deeply on his delicate sense, than the boisterous delight, which rather terrified than encouraged him, when he hoped, the alternate sway of pleasures that refined, and of ln'iuence that rectified Montono s mind, .vol'M have divided his life between the exercises and enjoyments of virtue, insf^d of lulling into vacancy, the inter¬ vals of Bacchanalian frenzy, with a despis¬ ed and prostituted talent,—those times and hopes, struck on bn mind, and tears fell

nay by the effort of a recollected mind But when they pursue us to the very hold and circle of our shelter, when they sit before us, amid our mirth and wine, in the blaze of lights, and the loud and comforting tone of human voices, when they do this, and will not be repelled, what shall we think?"— "Ippolito di Montono.' said the stranger, " delay not, resist not, retreat not, mutt I speak the words of power, must I produce the nal of your bond *"—" Summon your instru¬ ments and youi ow is," raved Monto¬ no, with a shrieking laugh, " let them bear me off in their visible grasp, shake this house to its foundations, and amid the ruin, bury me, or bear me off, if ye will have me, I shall be no easy prey." The stranger rose, Cyprian shrieked, the cavaliers rose, murmuring and prepanng to draw their swords—the stranger waved bis arm; " Children of earth,' said be, 8 in

Among them was a nobleman, who had been intimate with the father and uncle of Ippohto, but whom his riper years had not yet taught to retire from the revels of youth From tbe first ippearance of the stranger in the hall, he had appeared uncommonly agi¬ tated His attention to the figure, its voice, and its words, had been marked and ear¬ nest,

His presence—his voice seem to act on me like a spell Either my spirit, weary of suffering, sinks into that lassitude, which precedes dissolution, or it bows to its arbiter, with conscious submission, and tells me to rest on him And even now departing, he bid me be bold and fearless I will not fear—I will rest on hnn " Montono, you mistake the amaze ment of a harassed spirit, for the con fideni e of a controlled one This is the monk of the mountains,v.horn your super¬ stition would transform into the minister of jour fate,—he holds the confession secret, which, perhaps, he only awaits the n val of Pallenni to disclose to¬ morrow And will j ou, will j ou, see the serpent crawling within your walls, and whetting the sting that is to piene you, without an effort to crush hi;,«?"

though she would have almost exchanged her chair of state fora rack, to have learn¬ ed the cause of the Counts absence Midnight arrived, artificial levity could exist no longer The Countess almost talked to herself, and the Duke appeared perplexed and suspicious, when one of the attendants acquainted him that the Count was in his apartment This was the signal of their meeting The family separated, the Duke retired to his own chamber, which, when he conceived the castle was at rest, he quitted for Mon¬ tono s The Count and Countess were alone The Duke er tered, with two attendants, in silence 'lhe faces, the person.,, the manners of the meeting, hail undergone a sudden and total change 1 here were no compliments, no gaiety, no polished festivity; the countenances of the group were only marked by different shades of suspicious or sullen gloom, as they be¬ tokened
tokened the varied characters of the inquisitors and the criminals The Duke advanced " Is it necessary," said the Count,pomtingtotheattendants, ' isitne- cestary that your lacqueys should w itness this extraordinary procedure ?

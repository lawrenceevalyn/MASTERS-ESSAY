not calculated to make her happy, and rinding by experience how little she could bear privations, after being so long accus¬ tomed to elegance and enjoyment, she me¬ ditated as serious an attack on the old peer's heart as he did on heis, and ilisphyeil as gieat, and muth more genuine, desire to pleise 'Hie sacrifice ot herself to a man three times her ovvn age, she held as a tnfle, when weighed against the scale of title, for¬ tune, and consequence She knew not that he w as halt the year an invalid, or tbat be was a capricious tyrant in lus own fa¬ mily but it she had, her own temper was so comfortably apathetic, and her desire for the distinctions already enumerated so great, that she would have made no scru¬ ple of accepting the title of lady Ran¬ dolph Thus secretly concordant in opinion, and therefore mutually bent on pleasing, each became every day more complacent to¬ wards the other, and when his loidslnp be¬ came thus domesticated at Westhaven, he ΙΐίκΙ

' Miss Orford is considei ibly older than Vavasour, returned lord Randolph "she is
is, besides, remarkably plain in her person, and very singular in her manneis anil opi¬ nions." " And what could induce him to en¬ gage himself to such α queer creatine?" said Elizabeth, stealing a glance at Althéa's varying cheek. " They were engaged by parental au¬ thority when sir Montague was very young," his lordship replied; "and the last will and, testament of the father on both sides providet! for its ratification. Miss Orford forfeits her whole fprtune, except¬ ing two hundred a-ycar, if she refuses to marry her cousin ; and if the objection arises on hjs side, he gives up щ very consi¬ derable proportion of his ; and she is then bound to marry an Irish cpusin of her own name, whom she abhors.

Haeeiet heajd, with her usual lndiffe- lence, tlie tale poor Althéa told, with such sad earnestness, of her disappointment in her brother. Tlie offer she had foimerly made of herself assisting Philipson if George «refused, was now become much more inconvenient than when she first proposed
pioposed it, for to stay in a family like Elisabeth s, where there was a succession ot company at home, and visits abroad, without a proper change of dresses and ornaments, was not to be thought of, pır ticularly now that lord Randolph was be¬ come stationary there, and new plans and hopes suggested themselves to her mmd She saw, or fancied she saw, tli.it he was pleased with an elegant vanety in her taste, and was determined not to lose him for want of attention to so important an article as dress Her five hundred pounds was theiefore somewhit diminished, end she was unwilling to depnveherself of the means of continuing bet elegant and fash¬ ionable attack on his lordships heart She offered, however, to lend Philipson α hundred pounds, if that sum was sufficient to be of any use Althéa, who knew not exactly the extent of his wants, neither accepted nor declined the offer, till she had spoken or written to him and Harriet secretly hoped he would not accept the loan
loan of a sum so insignificant In the mean time, her ancient lord had many de¬ bates w ith his own heart, and with Gerard, respecting matnmony, not quite willing to resign his liberty, yet hating still more the idea of Randolph Castle passing to a man he detested He had written to Ins sister and his aunts on the occasion, not to ask their advice but to announce his intention, and their joint reply was expres sive of great congratulation to lum, them¬ selves, and the lady Of her conduct on tlte occasion, he thought there could be but one opinion—she must joyfully and gratefull) accept an honour so distinguish¬ ed, and so much above any hopes she could have had the piesumption to form At length the important decision was made—he would marry Gerard apjirov- ed the design and opportunity soon offer¬ ed oí a jinvato ıııteı view with İlan iet She had ibi some time obseived her grow¬ ing influence with the enamourtd old peer, and therefore, though highly delighted at the

but, judging by her ovvn feelings, Althcv thought that nothing could make amends tor age, ill temjier, and a variety of jıeı sonalinfirrmties, with which she knew the carl was troubled "Have you carefully consulted jour heart, Hirnet? said she, after listening to Harriet s enumeration of the advanta ges attathed to such a marriage ' С in you indeed submit to become the w ife oi an infirm passionate, capricious old man merely to obtain equipage and title ind a few useless luxuries which will be deai 1) indeed bought, if your happiness is to be the sicnhce' ' That cmnot be the case Harriet ie phed, "for in those useless luxunes, as youi philosophy is pleased to call them consist my happmess I eire little enough for his lordship, that I am Very willing to acknowledge but love as you dream about it makes no part of my creed I believe happiness to consist in rank and splendor and eqviijwge, in a superb house and

Althéa found her good friend as glad as •ever to see her, and she found heralone ; for Mrs Amy Finch had gone suddenly away.twodays before, to nurse her nephew, who had come to her house at Kensington ill. Mrs. Charlton was always placid, but she was generally remai kobly cheerful too; but now Althéa fancied she wa» grave and ill at ease, and though she talk¬ ed of old times, and took the same interest as ever in all that concerned Althéa and her family, still there was an air of abstrac¬ tion, and a brow of care, which could not escape Althéa's observation. She noticed Ml it
it at length, and Mrs Chailton owned that she was uncomfortable " You know, my dear Altliea," said she, " I am not apt to despond, and you know also that I am not so temcious of this worlds goods as to repine at a partial dc privation of them on my own account But I have just now several claims upon my puise, wlnth I am unable to answer as I wish , and 111 tell v ou why I am threatened with a lawsuit respecting the Irish estate, vv Inch, as you know, is one ot the greatest sources of my wealth A claimant has sprung up, after moie than foity years' possession of this propeity, and I am under the necessity of going myself to Ireland, to answer some questions, and produce some important documents, in peison I am most pirtitulaily un comfortable at this for it this very time my poor young friend, Mrs Sedley, and liei abommible, tliougli specious husband, li ive come to such extremities as to talk seriously of parting, and my influence might

The wedding took place in due time, »nd the happy pair set off to pass the honey¬ moon in Lun'on, and see all the sights. Mrs. Vernon «partook of the sumptuous breakfast prepared by Mrs. Pringle ; but Philipson and Isabella, though invited, did not attend, as -George gave consider¬ able offence by not asking him to per¬ form the ceremony. The distribution of bndecake conveyed more envy and heart¬ burnings than pleasure ito «many who -re¬ ceived it ; and had Pliilipson been able to persuade his wife, he would have return¬ ed the iportion which arrived at the par¬ sonage, accompanied by a mote of twenty pounds, addressed to the little Althéa, for a coral necklace, but in reality а shabby gift to her mother. Some weeks passed on unmarked by any event. Philipson, though reheved by Han iet's loan, and Althéa's generous gift, ftom his greatest and most imme¬ diately pressing embmrassmeuts, was yet too much involved to recover his ease of mind,
mmd, and sought to escape reflection by seeking society His temper, which was originally rather careless than good, became by these circumstances much sonreí andhe grew first negligent at home, and then hai sh Any application for money, though made as seldom as possible, threw him into a passion, so that, to avoid altercation, Isabella some¬ times was compelled to contract httle bills, which, when the time came, she found herself unable to pay, and thus increased the evil for which she found only a tem¬ porary remedy Mild and gentle herself, and unused to the starts of passion and fits of ill humour, to which bei husband now frequently gave way, her health and spints diooped alike, though she extited berstll to conceal the failure of both from bun Unknown to liei, he hid taken u]> almost all ber little fortune, fiist in furnishing the viuuagc, and then in paying some of lus old college debts, which could be evad¬ ed no long« Their income thus was lessened, w hilst an mcrcising family rather lcquued

listening to idle news, and flirting with forward girls, who liked Ins gallantries quite as well as if he had been a single man some of them, from the laudable ino tive of giving pain to his wife, who by their encouragement of his folly, became ev ery day more neglected The absence of Althéa at this timo was a vei y serious affliction to Isabella and would have been equally so to Althéa herself could she have known all the growing evils of her sisters situation One thing only re mained to make her still more uncomfort able and that was the removal of her mo ther from her immediate nuglibonrliood and tins trouble wai soon added to the rest The Lea where Mrs Vernon had now for some years resided was the pro¬ perty of a young man whom some in discretions had obliged to dispose of tint, and other estate* during an involuntary exile to another kingdom Cireumstances had changed, and Mr Molyneux return- ed to England, accompanied by а ftmale- fiumi

Jealousy formed no part of lsibella s cbaricter, and indeed the unbounded af¬ fection and high opinion she entei t uned ot her husband, had hitherto effectinlly pre¬ served her from this passion Nor even now, when forced to exchange this perfect confdence for some degree of doubt, at least, could her feehngs be called jealous They were, however, of а very misenble description, and such as she knew not how to endure However anxious to doubt such heart rending information, she could not help combining circumstances, and they forced on her mmd a degree of ter¬ rible conviction, and certainly induced a kind of watchfulness on her part, m order to catch at any occurrence which might Danish or corroborate suspicion and tins close observation too soon ended in a eon- finnation of all she most dreaded, yet he¬ sitated to believe Convinced that Phi¬ lipson vi as not ofa temper to bc r claimed b) leproaches 01 ill humour, and feeling indeed too wietehed to complain, she con cealed

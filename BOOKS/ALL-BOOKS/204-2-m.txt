Edward aflured her that his fentiments had fuftemd no alteration in any refpeet. " Ah, Sir," faid fhe, fhaking her head, * f how then, to mc, can you be ali that is mild and benevolent, and all that is cruel and Ungenerous to Mifs-Ormerode ?" w To Mils Ormcrode!"

" Of that, Sir. yon are the beftjud^e: but hr the love o( mercy do 4 iot let herlanguiflt in a prifon—her aunt is inexorable—it waft at her fuit flic was arretted." Edward had fecn little of Mifs Ormerode, yet that little was enough to intcrcft him in her favour ; but now the charge of Aus^tfta occuraxl to his recollection, Selina had. as he thought, wantonly afivrtcd, that fhe had hoard a confirmation of a particular attachment from his own month, He mufed, and willing to be certain that his fufpieions w her characler were foumicd, he turned to Mrs.l,omch% and faid, "*Did Mifs o Ormerode,
Ormcrode, Madam, inform you that / was her icduccr ? n " Mils Ormerode, Sir, declared that her prefent diftrefs had you for its primary caufe ; andher aunt has been more explicit, fhe (hewed me the letters which"—"You will drive mc mad, Mrs. Lomelv—tell Mils Ormcrode that her. prefent odious calumny but confirms the ill opinion 1 before enter¬ tained of her veracity.

He tendered a note of fifty pounds. Mrs,
Mrs. Lomely, though fhe was convinced of Selina's innocence, could not refute the tempting paper: fhe faid that flie was afraid Mils Ormerode would not accept it; but as fhe was in want of the neceflaries of life, flic might perhaps be prevailed upon. " I wifh," added fhe, " that you would ex¬ plain this fad affair between yourfelves. I think I could almoft fwear there is a mif¬ take: you arc fo good, Sir; and, if I may ipeak my mind, Mifs Ormerode is very good too.*' Mrs. Lomely now took her leave, and Edward recollected, with amazement, that he had not afked the fimple queftion how the acquaintance began between her and the young calumniator. Mrs. Lomely, after her creditor had can¬ celled her debt, found her very rigid eco¬ nomy no longer neccifary, and by the affift¬ ance of fome friends at Liverpool, o^ned a fmall Jhop in the vicinity of Oxford Street. Hor induftry wa> rewarded, and every thing IheundcrtookwasattciKledbyprofperity: ha eldeft

Recovering her re¬ collection fhe turned into a little toy ihop, leaned her head upon the counter, and fit¬ ting down, burft into tears. Mrs. Lomely, who was the miftrefs of the houfe, feeing a girl, apparently not eighteen, thus deeply diftreft, begged her to walk into a little clofet, flie called her back parlour. Here flie remained two hours;and the conference ended by Selina's agreeing to take the firft floor at a moderate rent. Mrs. Lomely, however, demanded a refer¬ ence. Selina timidly mentioned Mrs. Bed* dome j but added, that flie feared malicious reports had irritated her aunt againft her. Mrs. Lomely was affected by this candid confeffion: fhe left Selina, and walked to Red Lion Square; fhe was admitted to Mrs,
Mrs. Beddome, who was buikd in reading Mrs. Carter's Epicletus. Mrs. Lomely explained thc motive of her vifit; and Mrs. Beddome, laying down Epic- tetus, flew in a violent paflion. ** My Niece, that was, fends you here for a character, Madam; well, I vow I never heard the like of this!

Mrs. Lomely was interefted, suid begged the narrator to proceed. « Well/' continued Mrs. Beddome, " my father was fond of hunting, and ufed fome¬ times to go on a vifit to Sir John decking- ham, who was created Lord Sapley about two months ago.

Well, Madam, they went out, and the firft leap that prefented itfeif was a hedge as high as the monument: over went Sir John ; but my poor father being too much in a hurry, tumbled over his horfe's head, and broke his neck : a furgeon was called in; but he declared the cafe to be defperate, as the pa¬ tient had been dead more than half an hour." " Why am I told all this," thought Mrs. Lomely. " Well, Mrs.---------•, I always forget names*—oh—ay—Lomely. Well, Mrs. Lomely, the fmall-pox feized the two eldeft girls, and proved fatal: fo when I was ena¬ bled to ferve little Selina, I did ; for I took her home to my own houie, meaning to live fingle for her fake, and for fome other c % cc*fott$*

I thought the girl might get handiomcly married, fo I let her go; but Selina told me that the lady made too free with noyau.—Dear mc, now I think of it, Mrs. Lomely, will you take a glafs ? I have it juft at hand." Mrs. Lomely civilly declined the offer. "Well," continuedMrs. Beddome, " I in¬ fifted on her flaying ; but the poor girl moped and pined till a Mifs Delvalley, worth 1 don't know how many millions of mo¬ ney, took her to her fine houfe in Sackville- flrcet: it ufed to delight me to fee Selina drive up to the door with a coachman and footman, and lamps before the windows.

But thc dream of peace foon vaniihed. One morring, as fhe was fitting at work with Mr*.

36 FITZMAURICE,' CHAP. 1IL Matrimonw The morning after Edward had fent thc note of fifty pounds to Selina, a letter was delivered to him; the fuperfcriprion was in her hand-writing; he haftily tore it open, and found, in a blank flieet of paper, his note returned. Amazed at fuch contra¬ dictory behaviour, he refolved to fee hen and difpatched his fervant to Mrs. Lomely with the following note ; " Mifs Ormcrode. " Mr. Fitzmaurice would be particu¬ larly gratified, if Mifs Ormcrode would allow him the privilege of half an hour's converfation.

Edward almoft dourucd if he were awake: refolvuu* to eluekl.ut this tnvfterv, he jiroctekn* to Mrs. Lomely, and begging her to be his advocate, told her that Ionic villnny, which he c.uld not fathom, had certainly been put in piactice." "I believe it, Sir," faid Mrs. Lomelv i " but indeed I know not what to think; after the letters 1 have teen, I cannot but conclude that fome portion of guilt muft attach itfclf cither to you or Mifs Orme¬ rode. Pardon my franknefs; you have been a generous benefactor to me, and 1 am not ungrateful, believe me." Edward haftily enquired what letters fhe alluded to; and, after fome hefitation, Mrs, Lomely informed him of the fcene which had paffed at Mrs. Beddome's. To the houfe of that lady did Edward repair, but was informed that flie was cone into the country for a week or ten davs. Vexed, disappointed, and bewildered, he returned ro Mrs. Lomely, and begged her to attend him to the priibu,—Here he again
again renewed his requeft to Selina by mef- flige ; but all Mrs. Lomely's rhetoric could not avail— th.' infulted prifoner peremptorily refuiec' to fee him. Edward now wrote with a pencil on a card : " Some horrible deceit has been prac- tifed againft your repofe ; I know not how I can be implicated in it: permit me to elucidate this myftery. E*F" " I am waiting at the prifon gate." Mrs. Lomely declared that flie was al¬ moft' afraid to take the letter; ihe faid, that though Mifs Ormerode was ufually all gen- tlenefs, flie felt quite awed when flie laft fpoke to her. She is not very handfome, Sir, "faid Mrs. Lomely," but I declare her fine eyes flatbed with fuch majefty^ that I thought I faw thc greateft queen in the world before me; and yet, poor thing, flie r only a prifoner. She then departed, and foon returned with
with joy in her countenance, announcing Mifs Ormerode's acquiefcencc with his wiflies* Edward darted through the prifon gate, followed by Mrs. Lomely, who directed him to the apartment of Selina. When they entered thc room, the gentle fufferer role from her humble feat. She was drefled in a dark cotton gown; fkeins of filk of various colours were fpread on the table before her : a fplendid muflin drefs, which flie was beginning to embroider, to decorate fome votary of diifipation, formed a con* trail to the forlorn appearance of all around. Edward was bereft of the power of utter* ance. Sclina, re-(eating h< riclf, ailletcd an air of c unpofure; and i\ough her voice faltered, flie faid, with a ..nile, it was in a very di.ferent fituation we laft met, Mr. Fitzmaurice; but the viciffitudes of life ought not to aftonifh ; ill-fortune, " Like the toad, ugly and venomous, Bears yet a precious j^vel iu l> heail/* and may teach me to exert energies which a ftate
a ftate of tranquil prosperity would have permitted to lie dormant." Educrri, without attending to her, ex¬ claimed "Heavens! Madam; how came this fad reverie? and how am I implicated in it?" " I do not wifh to ,reproach you, Mr. Fitzmaurice; why will you, why will you force me to do fo ? Let all that is paft be forgotten by you, and leave me to my fate: if my forgivenefs be neceffary to your peace of mind, you have it freely/* " Did I need forgivenefs, I would humble myfelf to the earth Ixfore you; 1 am confeious of no crime. 1 meet your queftions; put me to the trial; I fliall not flirink from it," Selina looked at him reproachfully.— " Know you not," faid fhe, " of fome ac¬ tions, which, if revealed to thc world, might feverely teach you the bitter leflbn of re¬ pentance." " My actions, Madam," replied lulwaid, warmly, u feek no concealment. I do not boaft
boaft of a greater degree of moral recliaidc than falls to the lot of man ; but furely no aftion of mine (you force me to fpeak) has been or will be inch as a man of the ilricLii integrity would blufh to own/' " Were we by ourfclves " faid Se¬ lina, timidly. " There is no necefntv for that/* inter* ruptcd Edward ; ** I have already declared my readinefs to fubmit my actions to the teft : I am prepared to anfwer any queftion you may propofe/* " Do you then imagine, Sir," exclaimed Sclina, her eyes fparkling with the cou- feious dignity of offended virtue, " that my defire of a third perfon's abfence ori¬ ginated in a fear for myfelf? This injury is intolerable ! Tell me then, Mr. Fitzmaurice, how can you reconcile to your honourable feelings the horrors to which \ou have ex* pofed mc ? Treating mc as a propagator of failhood; and then, by forgeries, blading my fair fame for ever !" Edward, overwhelmed with amazement, could only flammer inarticulate founds.

Selina continued— u Could you find no other means to ingratiate yomitlf with Mifs Delvalley ? Did you think me your enemy ? Much were you deceived : 1 ever promoted your intcrcft, in that quarter; perhaps more than -——." She paufed. Edward carneftly requefled her to pro* cced; he utterly denied thc charges: ** I am convinced/' faid he, "cither that iho whole is a fabrication of a concealed enemy, or that circum fiances have been mifreprc- fented. You are incapable of deceit; your voice is not the voice of guilt; your ap¬ pearance evinces injured rectitude/ 1 Selina, thus urged, demanded what were his motives for denying to Mifs Del¬ valley, that a converfation had taken place between them in the park. This brought on an explanation, and Selina, biufhing, confefled herfeif to blame. The ftrange circumftancc of the letters was next diicufled : thefe Edward refolved upon obtaining; but as Mrs. Beddome was out of town, and the fervants knew not whither
call patience to his aid. He, however, in¬ fifted upon liberating Mifs Ormerode ; and fhe returned to her old apartments at tbe houfe of Mrs. Lomely. A month palled away, during which time Edward was her conftant vifiter: her many good qualities made a deep imprei- fion upon his heart, and he obtained aa avowal of her love for him. Mrs. Rigby contented to the match with a good grace; but in her letter faid, that flie wiflied her nephew had married a wo¬ man of fortune, " Nothing, my dear Edward," added flie, " could prevent my being prefent on fo joyful an occalion, but a fit of the gout, and the concerns of my immortal foul: the Reverend Mr. Tone i$ now myfpiritual guide; he bids me look upon the world as a muthroom, which is growing to-day, ami ftewed and eaten to¬ morrow P* Mrs, Beddome now returned to London, Edward called frequently at her houfe; but
but her doors were Jhut againft him* I-Ic, at length, wrote to her, denying thc Icttcis to be his, and begging pcrmiffion to exa¬ mine thc forgery ; he concluded by obferv- ing, ** that to refute the calumny alto¬ gether, nothing was wanting but her con¬ tent to an union with her niece." To tins Mrs. Beddome returned thc following anfwer: " Sir, " Your's received; and I cannot fay that I am greatly honoured by thc favour, he- caufe all who write to me are generally people of unfpotted characler. You ale me to let you look at the letters which p.i't between you and my niece; but I knou who-would be fool then, fo beg to be ex- cufed. I always fpeak my mind, whi-Jt every virtuous perfon ought to do; and I defy any body, though 1 Lave lived five- and-fifty years in the world, to fay any thing to the prejudice of my charaftcr; and 1 will
I will take care they never fliall. As for your denying thc letters to be your*s, I be¬ lieve it to be a wicked lie. I called upon Mifs Delvalley, to make myfelf fure, but flie was not in town, fo f went upon a fool's errand*; for J know that my fervants are all honeft, and my niece an abandoned reprobate huffy, " I had hoped, by (hutting her in a pri¬ fon, to fecure her from the evil doings of the world; and did intend (I fear the act was finful) to have fupplied her ncceflities there; for to fuch as fall from virtue no mercy ought to be (hewn in this world; and as for the next, fire and brimftonc is too good for them, " You act like a jackanapes when you afk my pcrmiffion to marry my niece* What have 1 to do with het ?

Which is all at prefent, from Your humble Servant, llachad Beddome" The ftyle and fentiments of this letter, would at any other time have raifed a imile of pity. But now Edward refolved, by a public marriage, to countcraft the deed? cf prejudice : authorized by the timid conilnt of Selina, he determined no longer to de¬ lay their union, which took place at Mr*. Rigby's, in Piccadilly; feveral perfons oi rank of both fcxes bang prefent.

Miss Delvalley, after her laft conference with Edward,—-(a conference, which, by deftroying her hopes, left her nothing but ihaaie and regret),—in an agony of de- fpair, flew from London, and immured herfeif in a private lodging at Bath; her foul ihrunk from fociety * flic tVt hcrfeit the ^ave of impetuous paflion, and dread¬ ed the eye of a world flie had renounced, la agonies, little fliort of frenzy, flic re- fiefted, that as Edward had flighted her proffered love, fo likewife might he expole her—a total change took place in her bofom, and hatred and vengeance fuper- ieded the fofter emotions* Degraded in 4 the
the cjcs of thc world, Augufta imagined that no act could cover her with ad¬ ditional ignominy, and, abandoning every \irtuous principle, ihe meditated how to inflict mifery on a man whofe ftrict honour ought to have enfurcd her grati¬ tude. Her long residence in Italy, rendered tlie idea of affaflination familiar—but deatli feemed to her a dcfirable retreat—her wifh was, to fee Edward wretched, and triumph in his mifery. Among fome papers left in a drawer by Selina, in her hurry of removal from Sack- ville-ftrcet, Augufta found a fmall minia¬ ture cf Edward—fhe knew that Selina had a talent for painting, but tlie highly finiflied manner in which this was executed, plainly proved the pleafure the artift ex¬ perienced in the taflc—This circumftancc was to Augufta, " confirmation, flrong as proof of holy wrif," and flie doubted not but that Edward icturned the love of her companion.-—Enraged at being flighted for the dependant Selina, fhe refolved to injure
injure Edward in the object of his affec¬ tions* The miftrefs of the houfe had bem very officious about thc perfon of Augufta, often bringing in Iter tea or arranging her room—it fometimes happened, that her lodger was furpriied in tears, which made thc iagacious landlady conceive her to be fome young creature eloped from a father or hufband. In a final] lodging, at an obfeure part of Bath, did Augufta refide fome time, under the feigned name of Smith—flie never ftirred from her apartments, but ruminated night and day on plans of ven¬ geance. Her mental exertions were too powerful for her conftitution, and at times her behaviour was fo wild and in- coniiftent, that her landlady often fufpect- ed a derangement of intellect. Sad reverie of fortune 1 the youthful, g^y, rich and innocent Augufta, driven from a world flie was calculated to adorn, by the indulgence of unreftraincd impctuo- vol, n, * flt> ;
fity* expofed to the fneers of malignity, the taunt of the unfeeling, and even be* come an objed of curiofity to her interefted landlady. This woman had been formerly a mil- liner at the weft end of thc metropolis— ihe was well known to many women of quality; and the coroneted coaches with¬ out the door, prevented, in a great meafurc, any animadverfions which might have been made on what was pafling within. Mrs, Chaenpney having amaffed large funis of money, retired from her bufinefs, (which did not folcly confift of felling crape and mofs rofes) and removed to an obfeure part of Bath, where an occafional right honourable vifiter would fometimes pafs an evening.-*-Indeed, long habit was be* Come nature in this woman, and ihe would rather manage an intrigue, gratis^ than re* ^iiahi in inaction. Augufta, one evening, retired to a fmall apartment where her writing defk was placed, and, to her furprife, heard thc § * name
name of Smith repeated by perfons in the next room—the partition conhft d only of deal-boards, covered with iclou:- ' paper. Augufta, tremblingly ahw to ; , picion, tore off a part of it, and diftii.cuy overheard the converfation. a Well, well, dont fore me any more about that; you know I have not the wealth of Craefus, nor can I, like Midas, turn all I fee to gold by a touch. " What do vou tell me about the old Romans for ?-—no, no, Sir, I am refolv¬ ed to bring you to my term*;, or you fliall not get a peep at her." " Now- the devil take me if———" " There is no neceffity to take the Lord's name in vain about it—-tec her you fhall not, without you give me what I afk—» Come, come, Sir, as I have left off bull** nefs in a great way* and only pradiie for fuch quiet perfons as yourfelf, it is but juft I ihould have my proper fee.** " Take it then, and now tor Mifs Smith* 1 * *' And now, Sir, fhe h, I confefs, in the b a next
next room—but be cautious in this af¬ fair—I keep, heaven be praifed, the beft of .charafters: if you miftake her room for another, when you are going out, why you muft afk her pardon, you know, and I cannot think of a prettier introduction." Here the convention was carried on in a lower key, an# Augufta trembled at the idea of her humiliation—flie took a hafty retrofpect of her conduct, and found, with horror, that flie alone was to blame. A fudden noife was heard in thc paflage, but before Augufta could rife to lock the cloor, it was opened by a gentle¬ man, who, advancing into the- middle of the room, ftopt fliort, and in a hurried manner faid :—« I afk your pardon, Md- dam, I imagined I fhould find Mrs. Champ- ney here/*— He would have proceeded, but his eyes encountered thofe of Augufta; both were equally furpriied, the gentleman was no other than Delvalley! Forcing
Forcing his brow into a frown, though much tempted to fmile at the unexpect¬ ed rencontre, « Augufta," cried he, " is it thus you difgrace your family ? Have you fet all decorum at defiance, and do you immure yourfelf in an obfeure lode- mg, without acquainting your neareft and deareft friend ? Are you not aware of the mifery which tore the heart of a brother, who loves you but too well ? a brother, who, to fave you, has flown from London, when urgent bufinefsabfolutely required his ftay :" •*. A brother who—who is a model of du¬ plicity," exclaimed Augufta, « Delvalley, away with the mafk of fanctity—your vifit was to Mifs Smith ; and yet you would pre¬ tend affection guided you hither. Delvalley, you are a hypocrite; and I am a wretch, deferted by principle, and almoft bereft of reafon:--«we know each other." " Faith, Augufta," replied Delvalley, u you arc in the right, and all I wonder at, is, that wc never were fo explicit be- n 3 fore;
fore* but let me beg of you to return to London; your houfe is not yet fold, and I can put a ftop to the ill-judged proceeding. If you have any thing to propofe relative to Fitzmaurice (who is, I conceive, at the bottom of all this ex¬ travagant rage) let me into the fecret, take me as your counfel, and depend on my beft advice and afTiftance.'* Augufta embraced her brother, and unfolded her plan of ruining Selina in the opinion of the world j for this purpofe ihe demanded his aid* Delvalley hefi- tated, and feemed rather unwilling to engage in the bufinefs. He faid, that as a confiderable living was vacant, he had applied for it; fliould an act of duplicity ftigtnatke bis charader, it might inter¬ fere between him and promotion, but bade her watt till he had fecured the living, and then he eared not what he did. Augufta treated him with the contempt he merited $ he replied to her invectives with great fang froid, but faid, that if flie chofe
chofe to marry r Ainflie, he had no doubt but, to oblige her, the Captain would ruin Sclina in the opinion of the world, and blow Edward's brains out. " Is Ainllie, at Bath r" demanded Au¬ gufta. The anfwer was affirmative. ** Let him then," iaid ihe, " know tliat I am here, I muft, I will be re¬ venged/' Delvalley, fecure of five thouiand pounds, which he had, bem promifed on the marriage day, joyfully executed the commiilion j he brought Ainflie to the lodgings, and bade him fecure his prize, ere ihe changed her mind. Augufta refolved in her mind various fchemes of vengeance; thofe once ac- compliihed, flie determined to quit a world flie abhorred. Ainflie appeared before her. While the tumult of paflion heaved her bofom, all idea of marriage ihe peremptorily re¬ jected j—her hand, Ihe laid, once refilled* X? 4 fliould
ihould never be held out to another;—he; heart once trampled on, was proof to the feeling* of love* Ainflie, with all the art he was mafler of, tried in vain to tbake her Solution. Hir \\mds were, " Revenge me, and pof- fi-li, thc wealth 1 ddpife." The Captain was not difpleafod at her continual repetition of thele words : attorn¬ ing a gay air, he cried ;-" Well, Madam, [ dcfiii horn an unavailing fuk; unhapjij .is 1 mull be at your fixt refolution: I will be with you this evening;—you flail be revenged—we will talk the affair over again at piquet." Again did Augufta feci degraded- -but a few wetks before Ainflie would have ap¬ proached her with reverence and awe; he now Ihcwcd an unbecoming familiarity : —Ah, thought Augufta, my mind was then pure, and virtue will compel thc ad¬ miration iven of thc worthlefs. Ainflie, true to his appointment, called ear¬ ly in the evening; the game at piquet tcinu- nated
natcd in his receiving a large fum of money; and having communicated a dark plot to Augufta, he retired to put his hellifli ilhcmc in execution. It may readily be fuppofed, that Ainflie kept hh party at pkmct a fecret from Del¬ valley ; he only mentioned, that he found his filler's fcruplcs infurmountablc, nnd was obliged to decline thc alliance. Deb valley was furious; all the rhetoric he was mafter of, was employed to encourage thc Captain to continue his addrefles; but Ainflie hail a proipetf of the fortune of Augufta—for her perfon he cared not ; to his brutal mind, the haunts of infamy could furnifh a more inviting object. In order to cnfnrc his future accefs to the furious woman, he put all his fchemes in execution. liis footman, a fmart young fellow,cafily got acquainted with the girl at Mrs, Bed- dome's, nnd flic was prevailed upon, by a promife of marriage, and five hundred pounds, to give fomc letters, forged by i> t Ainflie,
Ainflie, into the hands of her miftrefs, pretending flie had found them on the ftairs. Some notes, written by Edward and Sclina, were in the pofleflion of Au¬ gufta, and ihe delivered them to Ainflie, who was an adept at writing any hand but his own. How far his plan was iuc- cefsful, has already been detailed* Augufta was tranfported with joy; Ainflie profited by a moment of maddening gratitude, and the guilty woman had nothing left her to bcftow. But when the marriage of Selina was made public, all the horrors cf defpair agitated her bofom $ flie was tempted to rufli into the midft of thc feftivity, and deftroying her happy rival, put a period, at the fame time, to her own tortures. Slie had facrificed her for¬ tune and her fame, and now curfed, with frantic blafphemies, the hour that gave birth to a wretch like her. Ainflie, with expreffions of tendernefs but augmented her miferies, nvid nothing could have Withheld ler from felf-murder, but the hope

Selina was concerned for the prejudices of a woman, in every other rcfpcft fo amiable; but promifed herfeif much delight in the weftern excur- tion, which was prevented by Edward's re¬ ceiving a letter from his worthy relative: " To Mr. Edward Fitzmaurice. *< Nephew Edward, "The Holy Scriptures recommend pa¬ tience to man, as a remedy for the evils of this life. Now, as your friend in the fpirit, and your aunt in the flefh, I would recom¬ mend you to apply this remedy to your in¬ ward foul, as perhaps it may be put to thc fiery
fiery furnace of anger at what I am about to pour into your outward cars. . " I have, by the internal warnings of the fpirit, and the perfuafions of the Reverend Mr. Tone, been induced to enter into tlie holy eftate of matrimony, and hav« taken that worthy paftor as my fpiritual guide, and hufband of my bofom. Though young in years (being not yet three-and-twenty) he is old in wifdom and in good works. He, therefore, as my lord and mafter, com¬ mands me to fay, that, as he means to re¬ fide in London, you muft quit thc houie in Piccadilly; and, as you may be ftraightened for money, he allows me to fend you fifty pounds, which is all he can do for you, as his family is numerous. His mother, grand¬ mother, three lifters, and two little brothers, are on their way to the manfion in London: your apartments will be wanted. " I did not imagine, Nephew, that I fliould have ever married again, but your * bad conduct forced me to feek a protector. Mr. Pobjoy has been with me, and has made knows
known your iniquities: fie upon it, I fay; put a wicked reprobate of a girl on a foot* ing with your After Anaftatia, who never did any thing wrong in her life ! Want to make her again one of the family ! and then to behave riotoufly* only becaufe your brother-indaw gently remonftratcd on the impropriety of the thing! My flefh quivers to think of it!

Your aunt in the flcfli, Deborah Tunc J* Adieu to Edward's hopes of happinefs— he curfed thc infatuation of methodifm, and in his heart railed at his aunt for & fuperannuated old Beldame, whofe vanity not even age could abate. How to com¬ municate thefe tidings to his amiable wife he knew not; her diftrefs would now \m greater
greater than any (he had yet experienced. By the order of Mrs. Rigby, his marriage had been celebrated with the greateft fplen- dour : perhaps flie would not even pay the expences. He did not poffefs quite three hundred pounds, and he knew the demands upon him to exceed twice that fum. With a heavy heart did Edward quit the houie to feek a lodging; he was not long in the fearch: he took a fmall firft floor at a moderate rent, and returned to Piccadilly to prepare his unfufpecting wife for a removal. He was met in the hall by Selina, who* running into his arms, cried, " Oh! now I fliall be fafe!" Edward, greatly furprifed, enquired her meaning. Selina, panting for 'breath, faid, that a hackney coach had flopped at the door, and fhortly after two women and five children entered the drawing-room: they came, they faid, from a Mrs. Tone, and were to be confidered as heads of the houfe. Selina added*
added, that the fervants, who were in great confufion, were aflembled in the butler's parlor; and, knowing his knock, flie had herfeif opened the door, Edward clearly comprehended the caufe of this tumults he foothed his timid wife, and haftily afcended to the drawing-room* Here he beheld a fpeftacle which, at any other time, would have excited his rifibility: a woman, upwards of feventy* flood in the middle of the room; by her fide w f as an elderly matron, three young women, and two little boys (who, with dirty fingers, were placing with the filk curtain taUcK and finging as loud as they could bawl) completed thc group. Thc abrupt entrance of Edward difconccrtcd the pious ibt^ who were fcrcaming—" The Lord my pafture fliall prepare--—-." * fi Fray, youth," cried the old woman* " is there any thing eatable in this houfe ? For we are all hungry, after long wander¬ ing in a foreign land." Edward begged to know, by what right they
they intruded; and added, that if they could not give a fatisfaclory anfivcr, he fliould call the fervants to conducl them into the ftreet. " Here's language to the cleft !" ex¬ claimed the old woman: " but, youth, let mc tell you, that my grandfon Tone governs his wife, and I govern my grandfon Tone* You are, doubtlefs, the gracclefs nephew of vour pious and long-fuffering aunt, De¬ borah Tone, late Deborah Rigby, of excel¬ lent repute and fwcet favour among the elect. Join our holy fongs, and order a repaft to be made ready: let our apart¬ ments be prepared; and let-----." More would (he have faid, but Edward was out of hearing: enraged that a hypo¬ critical fet fliould thus ufurp his rights, he begged Selina to prepare for quitting the houfe j refolved that no after repent¬ ance fhould induce him to pardon his vain and credulous relative. The fervants were now aflembled in the hall: thc butler ihewcd Edward a letter from
from Mrs Tone, requiring every attention to be paid to her dear kinsfolk* By the date it appeared that fomc accident had re¬ tarded the letter j and thus the holy fociety came unexpectedly to their new rcfidence. " 1 thought," faid the butler, " I was tranf* mogrified with wonder! The old gentle¬ woman, that looks fo like an ale wife, brought all the young varmint with her in the coach j flic met me here, and bade me praife the Lord. I afked her what for j and flie told mc, that, as flie was very dry, flia would have a tankard of brown flout, with fupr and nutmeg: then, before I could fay Jack Robinfon, they popped up ftairs, and fell finging and fqualling like fo many cats in a gutter. I was minded at firft to fend for a conftable, for they looked fa tag, rag* and bobtailifli, that I thought they could be no relations of Madam's ; but this let¬ ter, that I got abort two hours ago, told me how matters ftood: fo I thought I'd wait till I faw your Honour, and if your Honour,
Honour pkafes I'll trundle *em all into the ftreet". Edward begged the hbneft man not to give himfclf any trouble on his account, and ordered a hackney-coach to be called, as he was refolved not to aft his aunt's equipage. The Tenants no fooner underftot>d that he meditated a departure, than they croud- ed round him and his trembling wife; they vowed that their miftrefs was turned- crazy, and that they would fare her and her new fet no longer* The butler fworc, that when any of the ftraight-haired gentlemen in iron grey (who were always abufing the bifhops and the government) ufed to frequent the houfe, he was con- ftantly miffing his fiiver fpoons, and a fait* feller or fo—they might be parfons for all he knew, but they looked more like journeymen ihoe* makers or bankrupt tay- lors—and indeed he had heard that one of them was formerly a cobler in White- chapel, But now, added he, when the houfe
houfe was once cleared of fuch fhahheroon% it is a burning fliame to fend a parcel ot fcarecrows of the fame kidney. The fervants joined in opinion with the fpokefman, and unanimoufly requefled Edward to keep them, and let the gentry above ling till their throats aked. Edward was affected at this inftance frf regard : he, however, declined the offer, confeious that he muft now defcend from a fphere of life to which he had long been accuftomed, - Had he alone been concerned, his phi- lofophy would have run no rifk of being fhaken; but his heart funk, and his eyes filled with tears, when he contemplated his innocent wife; ftie divined the caufe of his forrow, and was no fooner conveved to her humble lodging, than fhe chtar- fully buhed herfeif in putting every thing in order $ ftie then took him by the hand, and with a fmilc, beaming with the fweeteft benignity, exclaimed :—** Grieve not, dear Fitzmaurice, on my account, for I know you
you bcftow not a thought on yourfelf; can you think fo meanly of me, as to imagine that a change of fortune will caufe me a figh ; poverty and I have been long known to each other: and, be¬ lieve me, the horrors of thc phantom re¬ cede before the energies of a patient mind; dwelt not on the affluence we hare loft, but tliink of the happinefs yet in ftore for us: your own prudence will point out the path you will purfue; my hands fliall fur- nifli their weak tribute ; contented, be¬ caufe virtuous, our days will be crowned by felf-approhation; the fmile of affection fliall chear our toil: I am happy, ves, my iove, very, very happy." She threw her arms around him, and fobbed in his bofom; no felfifli idea flamed the purity of her mind, and the tears which ihe could not reftrain flowed for her huiband. Thc firft burft of feeling having fubfided, Sehna felt a calm, which innocence alone •an bellow j her chearful rcfignation, communt-
Edward ; his fancy teemed with images of futurity, and he refolved no longer to trull to the fallacious promifes of another, but be ever felf dependant. Agitated by the events of the clay, Selina found reft a ftranger to her eyelids; flie, however, pretended to fleep kft Ed¬ ward might fufpedt that her feelings prey- ed too heavily upon her; the neighbouring clocks proclaimed the lapfe of each melan¬ choly hour, and it was not till broad day- light that Selina funk into a fevcrifh flum* her. Edward rofe early—his reft had been broken by fearful vifions $ he would not difturb Selina, hoping that the perturba¬ tion of his fpirits would fubfidc by the time flie joined him. While he fadly ruminated on his dif- li'cffmg circumftances, the fervant of the houfe opened the door, and two men en¬ tering the room, arretted him for the fum of fix hundred pounds. Looking
Looking at the writ, Edward, with forrow, allowed thc validity of the claim, (which was for part of tlie expences of his marriage) and intreated the men to allow him to break the matter by degrees to his wife. Thc fellows* who had more huma* nity than generally fidls to the lot of a iheriff's officer, begged him to take hit own time, but faid that they muft be in the next room. Edward, with an aking heart, entered the bed-chamber: he foftlv drew back the curtain j Selina flept - 3 her head re¬ clined upon her ai*m, and her breath was fliort, and interrupted. Edward gazed on her with agony indefcribable. Oh my wife! thought he, Oh my Selina! you fleep in pain—perhaps dreadful images haunt your fancy!—why fliould 1 awake thee from ideal to fubftantial woe?—ex* cellcnt creature!—how will thy meek tpirit bear up agamft the tide of unexpected mifery ? w Fitzmaurice 1
<c Fitzmaurice ! dear Fitzmaurice !" mur* mered Selina, (for her dreams prefented the form of her hufband). Edward bent over her in filent anguifh, and a tear, which he fought not to reftrain* (as he was unconfeious that it flowed) fell upon the cheek of his amiable wife. Selina ftarted, and awaked—" Ha !" cried flie, with an affectionate fir Je, " you find me an idle fluggard. I muft learn to rife early, that I may enjoy a greater por¬ tion of happinefs; for till I convince you that J am capable of chearful induftry, I ihall fancy myfelf unworthy of your gene* rous protection." Edward clafped her to his bofom~his grief, which but augmented by the efforts he made to reftrain it, now burft forth— the tenderly foothed his trouble, and with difficulty he was brought to acknowledge his fituation. Selina's promptitude of mind taught her how to ad in this emer¬ gency—fhe read the foul of Edward—flie was impreffed with an idea of the miferies to
ducive, yet fhe knew, that her hufband felt for her fake alone* She begged time to give what orders he might judge pro¬ per, and when lie left the room, dltft herlelf*and was foon by his fide. Edward had ordered a fnrall trunk, con* tainirig the neteflaiy articles of wearing apparel—** You, my love, 1 * cried he! while he fondly preft her hand 4f will ftill retain thefe lodgings, do not aikto accompany me now :*—in a few days I fhall hope to fee you." Selina looked carneftly in his face—a timid reproof trembled on her tongue. " You relieved me from a prifon,** faid fhe, *« fliall I abandon you to the hor¬ rors of one? If yon think I'flibuld fufFer lefs from a temporary parting, I will obey you; but believe me," (the tears ftreamed down her cheeks) M that with you all fitua* tions are equal, and if by my affectionate afluluity, you will allow me to affeft my¬ felf a wife indeed, I fliall feel myfelf (and not before) worthy of the title. " Exalted woman ! M cried thh enrap-

Yet even in this abode of wretched nefs, ilid the mind of the unfortunate fair find fome alleviations, by the dulcet founds of ;an ^Eolian harp, which \vas placed in the windows of a prifoner: Edward liftened attentively, and Selina, infpired by its melody, wrote the following lines: On the JEotUm Harp, On yonder harp, what various filings ahouml, Yet alt in concord yield Iciaphic found ' In vain we twk, fuch harmony to find, Among the j .rrtng difcord of mankind.

CHAR VI. A Waterman. Though Edward felt that the defigns of an enthufiaftic feet had ruined him with his aunt, he was far from fufpecting that a deeper plan had been agitated againft him. This was no other than the offspring of the brains of Mr. Pobjoy, who ht flip no opportunity of promoting the intereft of his family, becaufe his own was concerned in it. Athacombe was but thirty miles from the village of Rockbourne; and^Pobjoy, after fome deliberation, determined lo afk pardon of Edward for his unkind reception of him; for the fame of Mrs. Rigby's for¬ tune had reached into Devonfliire, and the little apothecary thought that his children had a right to a fcramble for the loaves and fillies. Having put on a fine gloffy black coat and a pair of new footed worfted ftockings, he took his eldeft born, Neddy, on the fad-
die before him, hoping to reach Mrs. Rig- by's before night. When he arrived in fight of the beautiful manfion he was ftruck with awe; for, though thirty miles in the country is confidered as a mere morning's ride, Mr, Pobjoy had never before been ten miles from Rock* bourne. Mrs. Rigby was not in a moil compla- m\t ftate eff mind. Mr. Tone, intent on the duties $f the table, had been remifs in $#urting her from Solomon's fong; and the mgvy Mr had half promifed to herfeif never td be his. Mr. Pobjoy gave a ftiff jerk Irf his head and the fkifts of his coat; this he intended as a bow, while Neddy, fucking the thumb of his right hand, and fcratching his head by the*fc&p$f the other, feemed to take very little notice of what was going forward. After ^nnounting his name and occupa¬ tion, Mr. Pobjoy hoped that his brother-in- law was well. Mrs. Rigby, in anfwer to his long oration* fqilied, "that flie received all mankind as spiritual brethren, not at all
all caring for confanguinity; that he was welcome to ftay till the next morning at her houfe, becaufe charity forbade her to drive the ftranger from the gate;*' and con- eluded by obferving, « that as for Ed~ ward Fitzmaurice, flie did not know how to act on his account, or what (he could do for him, as fhe fhould in all probability (here fhe affected a blufli) again enter into the holy wedded ftate." Pobjoy was almoft overwhelmed with afto- nifliment; he had, however, imfc enough to fee that any objection on his part would only precipitate the match ; and he recol¬ lected a faying, which he fometimes, when out of temper, made ufe of to his mother* in-law, viz. when an old woman is refolved to go to the devil, the devil himfelf can- not hinder her. Rendered cautious by <|"s elegant reflection, the Son of Phytic cloathed his face in fmiles, approved her choice, though he had new feen its oh- iCcti and wiihed her much joy of her happy PJOipecls. E 3 Edward

Edward was no longer a favourite with his aunt. This, Pobjoy wiflied to turn to his own advantage. He declared, that he only came to rcmonftrate with the youth who had grofsly infulted him in his own houfe, and on his rcfufal of an apology, to lay his bad conduct before his excellent proteftrefs. Mrs. EJgby, in a rage, vowed never to fee her nephew more; flie \va-> highly delighted at finding an excufe (how¬ ever weak) to abandon him j and the mv expefted arrival of the apothecary fur mill¬ ed her with one. She now pioufly anathe¬ matized the horrid mifconduct of infulting a brother-in-law, though fhe had but a minute before declaimed the ftorge of con¬ fanguinity. Mr, Pobjoy, in confequence of having afforded her this pretence, became a great favourite ; and in lefs than a month he and his whole family were comfortably fettled at Athacombe, much to the difcomfiture of the pious Mr. Tone, who urged in vain that this was being righteous over much.
Bat Mrs. Tone was peremptory; though? fhe conlentcd to give up Edtvard as her heir, ihe had too much regard for the opi¬ nion of thc world to abandon the whole fa¬ mily. Mr. Pobjoy*s practice, as an apo¬ thecary, was not great; indeed, he only fol¬ lowed the profeffion, becaufe it gave him a confequence in the village, and gratified hi; infatiable thirft for anecdote* His fortuiu-, which he inherited from his father, an in- duftrious (hoermnV.r, was fecured in i ] ,r funds; though not large, it was fuljy lit:- ficient to live upon with comfort, bur vex iiicreailng family put the poor doctor to hh wits end. His practice was confined to a few 'ruftics at Rockbourne; a fituation in a large town was the height of Pobjo}^ am¬ bition. This, by Mrs.Righy's influence, he obtained, for while fhe deputed him to re¬ ceive her rents as fteward, flie recommend¬ ed him to her acquaintance as a ph\ fician. Mr, Tone, who had a call by tlie fpirit from felling herrings, to thunder from a pulpit, and fometimes from a beer barrel, now be- b 4 gan
gan to throw off the mafk. Secure of ihe widow, he looked down upon the apothe¬ cary ; and after afluring him that he fliould exact afevere account of his ftewardfliip on his return, carried his ancient bride to London. Mr. titki Mrs. Pobjoy were almoft annihi¬ lated by this cavalier behaviour. Prudence how$¥er came to their aid, but unfortu¬ nately left principle behind. Pobjoy was a great ftiCkler for church and king; lie al¬ ways dmnk the toaft after dinner :-*-but af- feirs were now altered, he began to have quahm of confcience; liis wife talked of jyftifk&rion by faith alone. Mrs. Fitzmau¬ rice exclaimed againft lawn fleeves, and the children were taught to run about the houfe, sdkmg every body what they fhould do to be faved. Tfais behaviour greatly recommended them to Mrs. Tone; her piety now grew outra¬ geous, and fome of her friends actually thought her a proper object of confinement; an idea her hufband v\as not willing to dif- courage. ■—*—-— .....-............ .......... ___........ While
While thefe machinations were carrying on, Edward was configned to the horrors of a prifon. He wrote a letter fo Mrs- Tone, evincing the calm contempt her con¬ duct infpired, and demanded his liberty at her hands, not as a favour, but as a right. To this letter he received no apftver, for it did not reach the hands of his aunt; Mr* Tone, like a careful hufband, opened all his wife's letters \ and as this was not cal¬ culated to dulcify her temper, he committed it to the flames. AHEdward'slittle remaining property was in the hands of a banker in the city. An im¬ mediate fupply was neceffary, and Selina offered to bear the draft. She put on her ftraw hat* and willing to fpare every cxpence, walked towards the city, though her trembling limbs often reminded her of the neceffity of a conveyance. When foe came near Blackfriars-bridge, fhe beheld a crbwd aflembled; it approached her, and as flie flood on the fteps of a door to kt it pafs, fhe beheld the body of a gentleman, f, 5 which
which had juft been taken from the water. The livid countenance ftruck her eye; the crowd paffed on, and Selina had recourfe to a fmeliing-bottle, to prevent her from fainting., A maid fervant opened the door where fhe was ftanding, and civilly aflced her to w-alk in: when feated in the parlour, after having fwallowed fome hartfhorn drops, flic began to recollect her fcattered thoughts. "Having thanked the girl for her humane at¬ tention, flie was about to withdraw, when two ladies, apparently mother and daugh¬ ter, entered the room. With the moft en¬ gaging kindnefs, they begged her to be feated j flie complied, and after a few mi* nutes converfation, again arofe to depart, when her eyes meeting a portrait oppofite to her, fhe involuntarily fhrieked, Alarmed at her emotion, Mrs. Hargreaves (the lady of the houfe) haftened to her af¬ fiftance. " You are not yet A fufficiently re¬ covered, Madam," faid flie; ** let me beg you to reft a little longer." ** 'Tis nothing, Madam," faid Selina, faintly 5
faintly; " but as I looked at that portrait, J------" <c Do you know the gentleman ? he is an intimate friend of ours—a very particular friend." " Jt is— it is - - -1- believe — I think - - - Mr. Delvalley/ 9 " It is, Madam," faid Mrs, Hargreaves, coolly. " Are you acquainted with the gentleman ? he is an eftimable character," " How little," exclaimed Selina with in- dignation, " do you know him : under the mafk of probity, he conceals the " blackeft of hearts* At this moment, not far from this fpot, a wretched woman hnguifhes iu fcclufion from the world, a victim of his arts." u I cannot think," faid Mifs Hargreaves, biufhing, that Mr. Delvalley-----" " Name him not, name him not/' ex¬ claimed Selina in an agony. " Let the in¬ jured Mifs Fitzmaurice declare in what deteftation iuch a character ihould be held I " Selina could not cxprcls more, yet her £ 6 anger
angef againft the feducer of innocence was heightened by a ftrong fufpicion that Del¬ valley and Augufta were inftrumental in the forgery againft her fame. At the, name of Fitzmaurice, Mrs* Har* greaves ftartled* She fternly enquired if Selina was the wife of a perfon fo called ? ** My name is Fitzmaurice," faid Selinaj wondering. The countenance of Mrs. Har¬ greaves lowered with angef, while that of the daughter beamed with delight. At length the elder- lady rifing, faid* " I now fee, Madam, that your coming was not quite accidental; from your appearance, young woman, I fliould not have thought ^ou capable of artful intrigue i however* you may wifh, Mrs. Fitzmaurice, to pre¬ judice me againft a worthy character; be¬ lieve me^ your arts are vain. 1 know you s Mrs. Fitzmaurice, I know you, and am forry that the errors of your early life* are not expiated by a due fenfe of your enor* mities* I beg, madam, that you will in- ftantly quit' my houfe, and inform your hufband,
hufband, that if lenity did not predominate in the heart he ungratefully flinders, a court of juftice would take cognizance of his villainies/* A chariot then drove to the door, and the two ladies getting into it, drove away for a morning's ride. Selina, ftupified with aftoniflimcnt, calmly left the houfe. She obferved not the pafling crowd, but mechanically walked towards the city. Her ideas were not fuffi- ciently diftinct to form a connected chain; ihe felt flie was miferable, yet fuch"was the fuddennefs of the blow, that Ihe could fcarce tell whence her mifery arofe. When ar¬ rived at the banker's, (he was informed that the houfe had ftopt payment; that the elder partner had fhot himfelf, and the younger fled his country, Sclina felt no additional fliock; flie re¬ turned in a ftate of calm defpondence, nor did any idea break the monotony of her for* rows till flie readied the bridge. Selina ftartled—Here, thought fhe, but two houfe
ago did I behold a corpfe borne by me—poof, poor fuflcrcr! thy mifery is at an end ! what ihould deter me from following thy example ? Wretched being that I am I let me fummon my refolut : on: oh, my be¬ loved Fitzmaurice, I will expiate, by a vo¬ luntary death, my faults in regard to you j by me were you ruined; I cannot bear your foothing tendernefs, and I will die." " A boat, Ma'am! a boat, your lady- ihip!" vociferated the watermen. Se¬ lina was affifted down the fteps, and being afked, whither flie meant to go? anfwered, " Yes." " Where would your ladyfliip like to be taken r" " Yes,*' replied Selina, penfively. <( Would you like to go to Greenwich, Madam ?" " Yes/* Thc boatman perceived that fomething was wrong; he, however, took his oars, and guefling her intention (inftanccs of a fimilar nature having fallen under his ob- fervation)
fervation) he determined to watch h v r motions. Selina leaned her head upon her hand; her pale cheek and tcarlefs haggard eye be¬ trayed thc acutcnefs of her mifery ; the man narrowly watched her, fearing every mo¬ ment (he would leap from thc boat. <c Special warm weather, Madam/* (aid he, u for thc time of the year/* Selina made no anfwer. is It's mortal hot, Ma'am, isn't?" No anfwer. ** My wife/* continued the waterman, " will wonder at my good luck in having fuch a fare/' " You have a wife?" faid Selina ear- neftly. ** Yes, Ma'am, that I have, and three as fine children as ever breathed God's air, though I iay it, that ihould not (ay it. *I fliall have another in a month orfo." " And did not your wife," faid Selina (whofe brain began to wander), " involve you in every difficulty, caufe you to con* tract

"Almighty Providence !' f exclaimed fhc, u yes, 1 will live for my hufband ; pardon, gracious heaven, thc dictates ot defpair; blot from my foul the guilt with which it was about to be contaminated, but by gra¬ cious interference." " Shall 1 row back, Madam r 1 * faid the waterman 1 " Yes, row back quickly, my good friend/' Selina arrived at the flairs; fhe put a guinea, in the hurry of her feelings, into the hand of the waterman. He called after her to give the change; but the celerity of her ftcp precluded purfuit, and the man dared not leave his boat. On her return to the prifon, fhe fbftly opened the door: her hufband was reading aloud; flie was concealed by a curtain, drawn acrofs the room to exclude the wind, and liftened attentively.

Selina wept. Her fobs were audible. Kdward ftartled, and approached her: he was evidently indiipofed, yet endeavoured to fpeak with chcarfulnefs j and when Selina, with a breaking heart, informed him of the extent of his misfortune, he betrayed no particular emotion., But his face belied his heart f there mifery had fole dominion ! he beheld his beloved wife a prey to poverty; and himfelf unable to contribute to her fupport! 'VLeave me for a while, Sclina," cried he, faintly; "we have yet refources; but this news has much difcompoled me. Retire, my love; to-morrow I will fee you." Selina
Sclina olxyed. Fitzmaurice fondly em¬ braced her, and ihe quitted the prifon. Left alone,The unhappy man began to confider how to procure immediate relief. To his aunt he had applied, but had re¬ ceived no anfwer.

CHAP. VII. A Revolution, At eight o'clock in the morning, Selina arofe from a flutnber, more tranquil than fl^e could have hoped, from the difturbed ftate of her mind. Her dreams had pre¬ fented images of joy; on waking, flie flghed at the recollection of a wandering fency! « Ah/' thought fhe, « am my plea- fures always to be ideal ?"—With a hafty flop, fhe fought the prifon gate, and when flie entered the wretched apartment of her hufband, ber eyes were ftruck by the ap¬ pearance of a man flitting by the bedfide.

She ut¬ tered a few incoherent fentences; her brain could bear no more. Her looks were fruv &ied j her frame was convulfed. « OK

T$£ Jiijlory of Fitzmaurice^ follow u Of my family I know little. My grand¬ father's name was Clarke: he began the world by keeping a book-ftall. Induftry and honefty were his chief refources 5 they did not fail him* he raifed himfelf to a large (hop, and left a fortune of twelve thoufand pounds to an only fon. My father, having this decent capital, continued the bufinefs, and married a lady whofe family could not endure the vile name of Clarke: this objection was, however, foon iemoved* for by putting himfelf to fome expencc, he changed his name to that of his wife's family, and became a Fitz¬ maurice. " Fortune continued favourable: my father's gains encreafed. I was born two years fubieqoent to the marriage, and your t 5 father
,te£ father was my junior by a twelvemonth. My brother was placed in the counting houfe of an eminent merchant; but my mother's family infifted that I, as the eldeft born, fliould have the education of a gentle* man j that is, pafs my time in the miferable occupation of doing nothing. «* I was fent, therefore, to college, where I loft the little learning I had acquired at fchool, but gained a vaft knowledge of the world ; for I drank, gamed, and intrigued ; was at the head of riots, and, in fliort, the moft noted debauchee of Oriel. Many complaints were made to my father of my mifconducT:; many were his letters of re- monftrance : I anfwered them by demands for money, and many of my mother's family were weak enough to accede to my extor¬ tions. ** At length my father died; and my mother furvived him but a week! Death had, of late, been much an intruder: the * frequent hearfes befiegcu our gates/ and many
many Fitzmaurices were borne to the laft receptacle of pride, the family vault. " My brother was a diligent, thinking man; he refolved to continue in the line chalked out for him. I ridiculed his nar¬ row ideas; faid, they became his fortune, which was fix thouiand pounds; and ex¬ ulted in poflefling five times that fum. 1 would not quit the univerfity : habit had rendered it familiar to me. Here I found companions, whofe purfuits were congenial to my own. My large fortune was thc theme of their envy. I knew it. I entered into every expenfive plan; and did not per¬ ceive, till after a length of time, that a large part of my newly-acquired property had found its way to thc purfc of my com¬ panions. Among all my iaults, ungenerous fuipicion never had a place: I curfed the ill-run of a die, but there my rage found its limit. Among the youths of Oriel was a Mr.------; he was a fore, according to thc opinion of his fellow collegians; but if a man of probity had depicted him, he would r 6 have
have been deemed affable, unaffected, de* vout, learned, and diligent. To this man 1 bore the moft inveterate hatred: his ex¬ cellent conduct feemed to reproach my ex- ccfles. I had no ideas of the happinefs of felt-approbation; yet 1 could not endure that another fliould enjoy any degree of praife : I wiftied alone to enjoy the fwects of admiration; little thinking that the fen¬ timents I excited were due to my vices and my wine parties. To humble Mr.------, was then my greateft wifh. J fheercd at him in the quadrangle; I ridiculed him to my companions: thefe were not flow to clifparage a man of worth : I even (I blufli at the recollection) attempted to blacken his character, by pretending to be privy to fome actions of his, in which the rules of the univerfity a:e moft fevere. The ftudents, or thofe fo called, were, in my time, and perhaps now, feldom ad¬ mitted to the private parties of the place. But fome of my mother's family were fet¬ tled at Oxford ; and it was at the houfe of a Mrs,
a Mrs. Ommaney I firft met Amanda Sullivan. " This young lady was, in my eyes, a perfecT: beauty. Indeed her female friends allowed her to be very handfome. Her mind was, I believe, purity itfeif. She was about the age of feventeem Her parents were opulent farmers inDevonftiires and as I fcrupled not to tranfgrefs the laws of truth, I often pleaded the illnefs of a near re! uion. to excufe an abfence from my fludies: this time was fpent at the houfe of the father of my enchantrefs ^ who, divining my motives, often prefTed me to make his houfe my own, when my academical avocations would permit. " Mifs Sullivan was fummoned to a reiv tion, from whom fhe had great expecta¬ tions. Her maiden aunt, Mrs. Sullivan, lived at Hampftead. I could no longer bear to be feparated from the object of my love: I could not brook even the flight re- itraint of a college. I took my degrees (though I richly deferved cxpulfion) and Jlcw
flew to London. Here I had daily oppor¬ tunities of viewing my beloved Amanda. She was, in a fliort time, brought to con¬ fefs her efteem for me, The marriage-day was fixed, but a flight cold, which flie ne- gleded, was attended by a fever: it en¬ creafed } and on the day appointed to be the happieft of my life, the fair creature was borne a corpfe to the church-yard of Hamp¬ ftead. Need I depid my feelings? they were thofe of a young'man unufed to difappoint- ment* I raved; I accufed Providence: but time brought reflection, Iconfoled myfelf for an irreparable lofs j and, with all the felf-fufficiency of youth, concluded, that an objed equally beautiful, and more indebted to fortune, might fall to my fhare* " I could not but pay a vifit to the parents of Amanda: and it was in one of the moft romantic fpots in Devonfliire that I compofed thofe lines, which I fome¬ time ago purpofely let fall *, that you, Eel- ward,
ward, might not think me quite fo mifan* thropic as I appeared. Oh let every heart guard itfeif againft that baneful influence!— I cannot but repeat you fome lines * which 1 wrote on revifiting the well-known fcenes of Devon, when age had cooled my firft impreflions.

u Again I plunged into the gay or rather diffipated fcenes of life. I aflembled round me, the idle and profligate: the gaming ta¬ ble was not neglected. My fortune, in left than a year, was reduced to two thoufand pounds; thefe, in a maddening fit of de¬ fpair, I flaked on the turn of a die ; the die turned—I was ruined. ** I now began to perceive that I was fhunned by my acquaintance; I knew that fortune was followed, [and ingratitude very common; but I fondly hoped / fliould find an exemption from the general lot* My hopes deceived me; and to complete my misfortune, a woman, on whom I had laviflied a great part of my property, de~ ferted me, after h**^ v» uivca a trivial „ j ^uutieis concerted difpute, and was foon after the profeffed miftrefs of a mm (I cannot call him gentleman) to whom I had loft large funis, I was not fo little known in the circles of fafhion, as to fall unheeded; many pitied me, more laughed
laughed at me, though none wondered at my misfortunes. " I now faw the world in its moil odious colours. My brother (whofe attention to his mercantile concerns had raifed him to great eminence) frequently proffered his af « fiftance : this I haughtily refufed, Mifan- thropy took poflcflion of my mind. I loath* ed my fpecies. My brother's offers I at¬ tributed to pride; and, with a gloomy fa- tisfaction, I reflected that I had yet fuffi¬ cicnt to buy a piftol* u In meditations onfuicide did my hours pafs away* My refolution was almoft taken, when a daily paper confirmed my wavering intentions. By this was I informed, that % youn& ***— \^<\ put a period to his ex¬ igence, in a manner the mote *.i-L wfA j envied his magnanimity, as I falfely deemed k, and refolved no longer to delay myfelf immolation. " I mufthere obferve,that I think the pub¬ lic prints are highly reprehcnfible for infert- ing
ing fuch paragraphs, without feverely ani¬ madverting on the raflinefs of the ad; for theimpulfcs of defperation we daily hear of, may from their frequency lofe a portion of their horror. " I prepared the weapon of death, and re* folved to excel my predeceffors in calmnefs. I wrote a letter, which I put in my pocket, to be found after my death, in which I de¬ tailed and juftificd my motives. My drefs was particularly attended to; and, to put the finiftiinghand to my intrepidity, I went to a coffee*houfe,and entered into a conver¬ fation with fome of my old acquaintance, who, as their circumftances rcfcmbl*»rl my own, did not fhun me. ** Here I made the panegyric of Rouf- feau, and publicly juftified fuicide, " A deep fighjattracted my notiee.

Of a gen¬ tleman, who had but lately left London, I enquired for my only futviving relative. 1 underftood that he was married, and that his wife, a gay young -woman, had fpoken of me in a public company as a wicked ex¬ travagant man. Unwilling to prefs forward when neglect aflailed me, I wrote no more to Europe, caufed a report of my death to be fpread, and refolved, on my return, to enrich my brother or his children, fhould he or they come to want affiftance.

Love, indeed, had long fmce taken ins flight ; but if cftccm could fccurc happinefs, my wife wholly pofleffed mine, 1 lived with her eight years, during which time 1 made enquiries after my brothei. With forrow did I hear that he was a bank¬ rupt, and in obfeurity.

At length my energies returned. 1 learnt from Mr. Rig¬ by that my brother was dead. I enquired if he had left any children.

The idea of Anaftatia was, however, more foothing, I fancied her needed, ibilorn, and ilruggling with a worthy huf¬ band, to fupport a riling family. I pictured to myfelf a fcene of domeflic humble hap¬ pinefs. I ordered a peft-chaife, and was in a few days conveyed to Rockbourne. " How muft a man of fentiment k* delighted at the reception 1 received, as the friend of the father of Anaftatia ! I found her in the midft of her children.

W xx i\ 1 . 1JV> -^F Fortune, While tliis happy party were lofing the pains of the part in fmiling contemplation of the future, a note was delivered to Ed¬ ward; upon opening it, he found thefe words: " I am locked up in a garret ; my wicked hufband will kill me $ I have been very fimple, I know, but I hope you will come and let me out ; my dear nephew, do pray come i—Sally, who brings this, informed me that you lived in a great ftyle in Harley- ftreet, and one of your fervants faid you were vaftly rich j if fo, and I hope it is fo (as I was weak enough to deprive you of my fortune, by marrying that monfter of ingra¬ titude Tone) do pray come and kt me eut ! do pray come and releafe, Your much afilifted Aunt in tlie flefh, and friend in the fpirit. Deborah Tone,
This incoherent letter, when fhe^vn to Mr. Fitzmaurice, caufed him to laugh heartily; he was however, the firft to pro- pofc flying to her relief. Edward infifted on taking proper officers, as Mrs- Tone had declared her life endangered; and in the evening, accompanied by his uncle and thofe myrmidons, proceeded to PicadiUy. The fervants who opened the door, alarmed at the appearance of fo formidable a party* flicwed Edward and his uncle into a parlor* where fat Mr. Tone, his mother and grand¬ mother, all three in a ftate not far from in* toxication- Tone fiercely demanded their bufinefs? Edwaid informed him, that hevviflied to fee his aunt; but Tone informed liim, ihe was in the country. " *Tis lalfe," cried Edward indignantly, " fhe 13 now in this houfe; hypocrite 1 1 infifton feeing her/' "Here's language to thc elect!" muttered ihe women as well as they could articulate. Tone, from intoxication, was incapable cj cf
of refiftance 5 and Edwaid, followed by his party, fearchcd thc houfe. - in a mean garret or rather clofet, the unfortunate Mrs. Tone was dheovercd. She was fitting on the ground, for there was no chair or table in the room; her chin rcftcd on her knees; (lie was drcft in a rich film gown, but it appeared as if it had not Wen pulled off for many days, for her hand¬ kerchief and cap were foiled and uncleanly. When flic beheld her nephew, Mrs. Tone hkl her face with her hands; (lie fobbed \vith violence, and begged Edward to take *hu fiom that wretched place. He offered his hand to affift her, but weeping with rage xnd fliame, flic informed liim, that he; legs were tied together. <c Rafcal!" cried Fitzmaurice to Tone, (who had now ftaggered up flairs;) " what demon could prompt you to iuch internal cnselty ? >J " Thc father of lies himfelf!"

Why will you turn yourfelf and me ?"— " It is too late to repent now, Mr. lone!" " But my dear I reflect on thc confequen- oc% my dear!" u Aye, aye, I am your dear now; but what was I when you locked mc in thc cV kt ? Did you not compare mc to the wo¬ man that fits upon the bcaft, and hvear (; 4 e upon h) that I was drunken with wine, when I had only drank final! beer ?—It is too late now to repent.** Mrs. Tone then left the room, and the picture being removed, a will was found, properly attcfted. By th* will, Mr. Righy had fettled two thouiand p«r annum, as a jointure.
jcinture, on his widow, upon condition* that flie fliould never marry again 5 in that cafe, it was to defcend to Edward, as heir- at-law; and to him ^vaa bequeathed ths whole of the large fortune? except an annuity of three hundred pounds, which was left to Helen Fitzmaurice. ' This will was a kind of peace-offering to his nephew, for whom Mr. Rigby had a real aflbdlfon, and whofe abfencc he could not bear, Mrs. Tone confefled that fhe gave large funis to bribe the witnefles to (Ilence. She did not mention thc affair to her hufband, thinking his piety real, and fearing his dis¬ approbation. When he threw off the mafk, fhedetermined to revenge herfeif and do her¬ feif an aft of juftice. She now begged forgive- nefs, in a manner fo abjeft, that her nephew thoroughly defpiied lier^ he, however, pro¬ mifed that flie ihould enjoy her -jointure during her life, and returned to the apart- mcnt> where Tone was foaming with rage. The manly (irmncfi. of Edward awed the preacher, who, after a long altercation, agreed
agreed to receive fifty pounds, half-yearly, upon condition, that he fliould never moleft his wife, who fliould forfeit all claims upon her nephew's bounty, if ihe lived again with her hufband. Tone and his family were now permitted to depart; he gnaflied his teeth in impotent rage, but fearful of lofing his fmall income, vented not his fury in words, Mrs, Tone fcarccly dared raife her eves to her nephew, though he endeavoured to pve her every confolation, of which her tuftreflcd mind was capable: fo felfifti was flie, that her joy at being delivered from the thraldom of her hufband was not fufficicnt to counter-balance the lofs of her ill-gotten wealth: flie murmured at her fmall in¬ come, as flie termed it, and even propof¬ cd fome addition, on account of her love of juftice, which had prompted her to betray the fecret. Mr. Fitzmaurice was indignant—fternly addreffing her, he faid,— « Mrs. Tone, I know not which claims moft my contempt your
*— Dare you talk of a love of juftice, who* have iniquitoufly defrauded a young man of his lawful inheritance?—Dare you attri¬ bute to a love of juftice, what was extorted from you by revenge ?—Can you boaft any fhare of common fenfe, when you think of infpiring affection, laden as you are with years and infirmities?—What pity can you lay claim to, but that, due to imbecility of mind ?— Perhaps your hufband kept you ignorant of your nephew's diftreffes; but a moment's reflection muft have taught you, that he had contracted debts, which you in juftice were bound to anfwer, had you even been the rightful heirefs of Mr. Rigby. My excellent nephew's refpeet to the memory of his uncle, by allowing you the amount of your jointure, I approve, and woukl recommend you to live retired at Athacombe. Your future conduct may merit my nephew's forgivenefs." Mr. Fitzmaurice then, m a few words, explained the fecret of their relationfhip > and
and Mrs. Tone, after a pious fhower of tears, extorted from her by the foregoing lecture, promifed to leave London as foon as poffible; adding, that flic would write to Mr. Pobjoy .to get every thing ready for her reception. At the name of Pobjoy, Mr, Fitzmaurice, good-humourediy rubbed his hands;—" No* no" cried he 5 "I muft have an explana¬ tion with the little gallipot vender myfelf. What fay you, Madam; will you allow this party to efcort you to Cornwall. Pobjoy has been cheating you I'll be bound: the fellow did not turn canter for nothing." Mrs, Tone lifted up her hands and eyes, but acquiefced.—The other party then took their leave j and Mrs, Tone, after hav¬ ing fcolded her fervants (all of her huf- band's providing) and even the maid who compaffionately had provided her with pen and ink j retired to her bed, where fhe vainly endeavoured to lofe in fleep the ideas of her diminiihed fortune.
V- Jt -1 ■*■ \ i ♦ *A. A prof (fitl cf Marriage. Mr. Fitzmaurice begged that Edward's re* vcrfe of fortune might be kept a profound fecret for the prefent; and in this he had a double view: to fpare the feelings of Mrs. Tone, and expofe the hypocritical Pobjoy. The journey to Cornwall was fixed for the next week* but was delayed by unexpected events. One morning while Edward was fitting with his uncle, the carriage of the Bifhip of -r— drove to the door, and Helen entered the room. During her brother's conva*- lefcence, (he had been a frequent vifltor, and now he was reftored to health, affection and gratitude brought her almoft daily to4iar- Icy-flxeet. A chearful converfation enfued; and as Helen was about to depart, a pacquet was put mto the hands of Edward, who, open™ ing
ing it, found two letters, one addrdild to him, the other to his filler. Thc letter to Edward ran thus: ". Sir, " When the fignature of this letter ftrikes your eye, you will, doubtlefs, feel in¬ dignant at the prefumptionof the man who has the honour of addrefling you. I can™ didiy confefs, that my condud towards Mifs Fitzmaurice renders me defpicable in my own eyes: with what horror then muft I be looked upon by others? May I entreat you, Sir, to rive the enclofed letter (which I have fent, unfealed, for your pcrufai and appro¬ bation) to your much abufed fifter. To repair her injuries, is the deareft wifh of my heart. I acknowledge that I am not igno* rant of your revcrfe of fortune: this has not the moft trifling weight with me; I am ready to take your fifter portionlefs. Let that circumftance plead for me, and prove at once the continuance of my love, and the diiintcrcflednels of my motives. 1 have the honour

My fifter is in a declining ftate of health, or ihe would, doubtlefs, have becn- a mediator between us." Helen faintly rcquefted her brother to difpenfe with her reading the letter addreffed to her- " Time, and experience of my fc« : ducer's treachery," faid flie, ** ought to have obliterated every trace of love fiom my heart i but there are fome latent chords, which (though long untouched) w f ill fome¬ times painfully vibrate. I fear that i cannot with indifference perufe lines, where repent* ance is profeffed by a man once dearer to me than family, fame, or life.

Helen now fat down, by the advice of her enraptured uncle, to anfwer the letter of Delvalley : but the hour of dinner inter¬ rupted her, and flie was obliged to leave the unfiniflied flieet. She, however, foon returned with Selina, to purfue her tafk, and was fcarccly joined by Mr. Fitzmaurice and Edward, when a thundering knock at the door, announced thc approach of com¬ pany. Two ladies entered the drawing-room, and Selina immediately recognized Mrs. and Mifs Hargreave's. The former advancing to Sclina, faid, " Mrs. Fitzmaurice, I have many apologies to make for my unkind be¬ haviour to you, when chance conducted you to my houfe; but now the moments are too precious to be waited in luperfluous ceremony;—may I, madam, fpeak with vou alone."

Mr. Fitzmaurice took the paper in afto- nifliment; and Mrs. Hargreaves addrefling Helen, faid, " I will not aik the unnecef* fary queftion, if you know Mr. Delvalley-* that paper fell from his pocket not two hours ago; it was unfealed; fltuated as my daughter was (on the point of becoming wife to the unworthy writer) flie deemed it no impropriety to perufe it.—Comfort yourfelf, my Sarah, his ungentlemanlike taunts reflect diigrace only on himfelf" Thc letter was as follows : VOL.

CHAP. XL Further Retribution. The Bifliop of —- was the model of what an ecclefiaftic ought to be. This dignified prelate owed his elevated iituation to his virtues: he graced thc epifcopal throne; it conferred no additional luftre on him. All the value he attached to his power in the church and ftate, was in proportion as it alTorded him the means of duleminaring truth and virtue. He beheld, with regret, thc progrefs of fcepticifm and infidelity: this he undauntedly attacked, ami flood forth, a firm champion of the great Mafter who fent him. From the pulpit his elo¬ quence was irrefiftible. Truth boldly infilled upon, n^cd fear no opponent. His audiences were numerous; at length it became falhionable to form a part of them. What began by falhion, cnd<:d in conviction : all the town flocked to hear this excellent man; tbe
the idle and thoughtlefs were charmed into attention, and "fools, who came to feoff, remained to pray/'—The good Bifliop felt it particularly incumbent on him io fcruti* nizewith feveriiy tic learning cf the candi¬ dates for holy orders, but alfo thc charader of the clergy of liis diocefe. He was con¬ vinced that the decay of religion was not to be attributed fokiy to modern phiiofophy; the conduct of the minifter?, to whom its interefts were confided, rnhht likewife be no fmall caufe; conferment ly, at a vifitation, no member of the cpifcc;:acy was nure dreaded : the negligent met reproof; the worthy praifc; and praife from tlie mouth of the Bifliop of —-—, conferred an honour never to be forgotten. Helen had, by the dc fur of her uncle, informed her patronefs, that Ihc was abo-st to refide entirely in Harley-ftreet. Mrs. —----'grieved at the parting, but was not felfifli enough to attempt to detain her. Mr. Fitzmaurice had agreed to call for his niece at two o'clock: about thai time :i knocK
knock at the door made Helen ftart. She haftily finiflied drefflng, and ran down flairs, not doubting but that,her uncle was ar¬ rived. The parlour-door was open, and in a back room the figure of Delvalley ftruck the eyes of Helen. He was in clofe con¬ ference with thc Bifliop : fo carneftly were they engaged, that the approach of a third perfon was unnoticed. The limbs of Helen convulfively fhook, and fhe was obliged to lean, for fupport agamft a chair. " I confefs, Sir," faid his lordfhip to Del- valley, " that I do not approve of non-rcfi- <3cnce; you have already much advance¬ ment in the church; your arguments do not convince me, though I confefs your ex¬ emplary conduct deferves every favour. I hope, Sir, that the gentleman, to whom you would commit the care of your flock, is every way qualified/' " I humbly thank your Iprdfhip," re¬ plied Pelvalley, who looked the picture of humility; "and hope by my zeal, and at- * " tention
tention to every moral duty, as w r ell as my clerical functions, to merit your good opinion—Thc gentleman I mentioned is a man of cxtenfive clafiical knowledge." ------ 4 * Is he a,good man?*' faid the bifliop: I reverence a icholar, but a moral characler feems to me to be the firft requifite to a clergyman.** " I omitted/* replied the hypocrite, " to notice his moral character 5 for I hoped, as I had mentioned him as my intimate friend, it was unneceflary: 1 have not aflbciated, my lord, with the worthlefs:—no friend of mine will, I hope, be undeferving your lord- fhip's countenance.** *' I doubt it not, Mr. Delvalley—I doubt it not:—your character is well known to me:—your conduct has ever been ex¬ emplary.—The Living, Sir, is yours.** Helen would have retired; but Delvalley, who now exultingly lifted his head, met he* eye. He ftarted, and exclaimed,—" 1 am undone !" " How?" cried the bifliop, w You
"You come, doubtlefs, to exult in my ruin; but 1 have clclerved it.—Be fatisfied -*-you cannot fink me lower." "Oh! I come not* to accufe!" cried JMcn: (< *loft to virtue and truth as you arc, I would not ruin you." *' This," faid his lordfhip, gravely," muft be explained." <e Let her then explain 1" raved Del¬ valley:—but think not to triumph in my fuffcrings,—No, Helen! 1 will put it be¬ yond the reach of fate to wound mc deeper." He ruflied wildly fr^m the houfe. He¬ len funk on the flc^r; and Mr. Fitzmau¬ rice, who foon after entered, immediately comprehended the caufe of her cliforder. He tenderly requefled her to leave the room, and compofe her fpirits. Helen gladly obeyed, and fought the company of her pro- teftrefs, who offered every foothing allevi¬ ation, of which a poliflied mind is capable* The worthy bifliop heard the infamous tale with difihay:~" And on this man," exclaimed
eselaitncd he, with uplifted hands, ** was I about to bcftow a confiderable fituation in the church. With honed pride may I aver, that I have ever fought to promote real merit, without regard to the claims of rank. In this man (it is the lot of humanity to err) I thought worth and dignity united. Mr. Delvalley has, till now, fupported an imblemimcd character.—His family is no¬ ble.—The knowledge of that, fliouid have taught carefully to guard the honour tranf- mitted "from fire to fon.—His literary pro¬ ductions were fuch as to reftecYhonour on the head and heart of the writer. Under thefe circumftances, my dear Sir, I was led ttt think Mr. Delvalley an ornament to the profeffioa he had embraced.—His hypocrify was un¬ bounded: and who but the * mighty Mafter iliall read the thoughts of the heart? My eyes are now opened—A villain fliall no longer diigrace our pure eftablifhment—I will take fuch Aeps as will evince my refolu- tion to punifh villainy,—Had you, Mr. Fitzmaurke*
i Fitzmaurice, mentioned thc name or pro¬ feffion of thc man to whom the misfortunes of your Niece were owing, he fliould long mice nave ceaicd to be a fcandal to our order." Mr. Fitzmaurice now fummoned Helen, who, with tears of gratitude, took leave of her beneficent protectors. When the cha¬ riot ftopt in Harley-ftreet, Edward flew to the door:—" I muft fpeak with you, Sir— Helen remain where you are—our ftay will not be long/* Mr. Fitzmaurice haftily entered the houfe, and Helen remained in the chariot— her heart fluttered, flie knew not why—a quarter of an hemr elapfed—her uncle, her brother returned not—a quarter of an hour elapfed—her alarm increafed—her fituation was irkfome—flic repeatedly confulted her wajch—another quarter of an hour flowly dragged away; and at length a, fervant in- .formedjier, that her uncle requeftecfto fpeak yith jlipr:—rfhe wasjtffifted from the clia- riot,
ript, and entered the parlour with trembling fteps. A prefentiment whifpered that her feelings would receive a rude fliock, " Helen V 9 exclaimed Mr. Fitzmaurice, 4i your conduct, in regard to Mr. Delvalley* has hitherto been noble. Will you act confiflently with the high opinion I have formed of your heart ?" " I hope, deareft Sir," ciied the trembling Helen, * s that you have no diftruft of my fincerity/* ** None!—But human nature is vin¬ dictive; and the Utc fcene with Mr. Delvalley muft have eradicated from your bofom every tender fentiment for an object fo unworthy/' " Y--cs,** replied Helen, in a low and tremulous voice. " The void is, doubtlefs, filled with a de- fire of vengeance." " No/' replied Helen, firmly, « it is not/* M I fear to hurt you, Helen—Mr, Del¬ valley would fee you—he wiflies ------ * H?s

" He will foon need forgivenefs" from a higher power," faid Edward;—« he i& dying/' Helen faintly echoed the words—her co¬ lour faded.—At^ length flie ftammered— " All artifice, perhaps------" " That was my opinion," faid Edward ; " but the tears of age arc not lightly ftied— the grey-headed fteward, Barlowe, has con¬ firmed the horrible tale." ** Horrible 1" exclaimed Helen,—" has then Delvalley been rafli enough to——" « You have divined it," interrupted Fitz- aiaurice. " Agitated by ihame, and per- hr^s'remorfo, he flew from the houfe of his dioceian^
diocefiyi, and iiad no fooner reached his own dwelling, than he fwallowed a large quantity of laudanum." " Delvalley, I forgive yoir!" exclaimed Helen,—" from my inmoft foul, do I forgive you—let me not again reproach you-—— J will go, Sir—let us fly." Fitzmaurice had the penetration to per¬ ceive, that the agitation of his Niece was occationcd by a long fmothered, though un- extinguished affedion for her feducer. He, neverthclefs, kindly pretended to attribute her emotion to her horror at an ad of fuicide. When the chariot flopped in Sackvillo- ftrect, the door was opened by the porter, who begged Edward to follow a footman to the apartment of his mafter. " Flow does Mils Delvalley bear the fliock ?'* demanded Edward. "Ah J Poor young lady! She is infen- Able to all that palfes," replied the man. Edward imagined, that grief had over¬ powered her, and followed his condudor. M£FEtz-
Mr. Fitzmaurice entered a parlour, followed by the almoft; exanimate Helen. Diftant flirieks, as of women, were heard; the houfe was otherwife filent as the grave- In a fhort time, Edward returned.—" Sum¬ mon your courage, Helen," faid he, ** or fpare your feelings by immediately quitting this lioufc. M « Delvalley is then no morel" faid He¬ len, mournfully. ** He is not yet dead—he wiflies to fee you, but~—" " Oh, frame no obje&ions!—Let m$ affure him of my forgivenefs." She flew into the hall* and without knowing which way to take, began to afcend the ftairs, Edward followed, and conducted her to the chamber of Delvalley. As they were advancing to the door, a loud fliriek ftruck*the ear* but it came not from the apartment of the dying man. Heedlels of any dhftrek but her own, Helen haftily threw open the door. On entering the room, what a fpe&acle prefented
prefented itfeif to her eyes:—Mrs. Har- greaves was on her knees at the bed's foot: her daughter was the ftatue of defpair by her fide.—The grey-headed fleward wring¬ ing his hands, contemplated his dying maf¬ ter.—But Delvalley was the picture of hor¬ ror—his widely-flaring eyes, and black qui¬ vering lips,plainly flicked, that deatli would not be tardy to relieve him from bodily fuf- fcring.—A phjfician -fat on the beck Helen wildly ruflicd forward, « Oh, Dclvdiey!" cried flic, " is it thus I am doomed to fee you r" ts Arc you then come indeed, Helen r~~ Do you—can you forgive me? I thank this interval of eale, which jiermits me to admire fuch exalted pocdnefs. Before the perfons prefent, I declare you heircls of all I poflefs. Poor remuneration for the lofs of happlnefs and domeflic comfort ! But \\\\sl" fhall I fay to this other object of my .cruelty ?" * s Speak not of me, Mr. Delvalley,** cried Mifs Harcreaves— u arain, and ai^ain, do I affure vou of mv forpivpnpfs." ________
" Be comforted, Sir," faid Mrs* Har- greaves^—"of my child's pardon and mine, you may be allured." " Oh, there again/ 5 raved Delvalley, "am 1 torn with agony. Oh, Sir! (turning to the phyfician) is there no hope ?—no flight, no diftant hope of faving my life ?—How dare I face that Being, whofe laws I have neglected, whole power [ have fet at nought, whofe caufe I have betrayed ?—Is there no hope ?~In pity teach me to think I lhall not die." The phyfician remained filent.—Delvalley carneftly confulted his countenance, but no hope was to be gathered from thence.—The unhappy man fell backwards—horrible con- vulfions enfued, and the fervants were fum* xnoned. With difficulty could the united force of four athletic men confine the writh¬ ing form of Delvalley—his eyes glared, as if they would burft from their fockets, and blood ftarted from his livid lips. At length, exhausted by involuntary exertion, the pa¬ tient recovered a fenfe of his mifery—-he again addrefled the phyfician.
« Is there no hope ?—Oh, give me hope! *—I may yet live—I may repair my crimes. —Oh, no !*—I may live, but to repair my crimes is impoffible." %t I have already informed you, Sir," faid the phyfician, ** and painful was the tafk, that you have but a fliort time to live; tliink, then, of more important concerns, and apply cornfort to your foul." " Would I could ! Would I could!" raved Delvalley; ** but it will not, it cannot be—a feducer! A fuicide !—Of the paft I think with horror—of the future, with defpair/* Convulfions again feized the wretched man: his robuft frame long with flood t heir violence. —£)eep*drawn fobs, which II niggled for a vent, heaved his panting bo¬ fom.

Thc fleward approached the body. ic Ah !" tried he, " never were two better youths than my lord and Mr. Aubrey, when my late lord lived. They were beloved by every body, and well did they deferve it. But it is ncccflhry it feems to go to a public fchool and a college : They came back with a power of learning, io be fure, but were quite Jpoilt by fi niftiing their education. My young lord ufed to love the poor, and would never break in the hedges j but when he came back from Oxford, he ufed to make game cf the people who complained of his deflroy- kg a field of wheat; and then two years after, my old lord died ;—thc eftate was put 'out to nurfe, as they call it, and my young 'lord obliged to go out of the kingdom like a vagabond: as for poor Mr. Aubrey—but we muft never fpeak ill of the dead.—So I declare that I never fufpefted him of any wickednefs, tilt it all came out.'* Mr. Fitzmaurice, in a low voice, afked

She was followed by two women, who.criee) our, "that it was not her fault; fhehactgot

She approached where the corpfe lay ex¬ tended. " Fitzmaurice ! Fitzmaurice !" faid ihe, in a penfive tone, " I have heard the name repeated ! Is he then dead ?" A difcordant laugh burftfrom her lips. Edward flood motionlefs.—Augufta heed¬ ed him not.—She caft around her eyes, but they reded on no particular object.— At length they fell on the livid countenance of her brother*—She with a fcream advanced —"What!

Mr. Fitzmaurice was almoft overpowered by the (hocking fcene; the phyfician in¬ formed him, that his patient had been in a ftate of infanity fornetinie, and added, that he feared nothing but death would relieve her from her mitery. Fitzmaurice and all the party now left the houfe. To divert the mind from too deep a contemplation of paft events, it was deemed proper to expedite the journey to Cornwall, which took place m a few days. 1 6
CHAP. XII. The Denouement . As- the carriages approached Athacombe, pleafure again glowed in the eyes of all the travellers, except in thofe of Mrs. Tone. She reflected with bitter regret, that the manfion houfe was no longer hers; flie wept at thc idea, and quoted a variety of texts on the uncertainty of riches. When thc carriages drew near the village, \T;\ Fit/mauricc perceived there was a great coud nffembled, and exp:.fl his furprize, a-; the journey had been kept fecret; buthe was deceived !i \ conjecture. A country hoy haftily ran by ; Mr. Fitzmaurice ftopt tiie carriage, and demanded the caufe of fuch a concourfc of people,—" They do fay a". Mafter Pobjoy is to be put in the flocks," cried the panting boy, and ran on. Mr. Fitzmaurice, laughing heartily, declared he was glad of it 3 but Mrs. Tone, in a de¬ mure
Inure voice, faid, " that doubtlefs the good-for-nothing brat was a frec^uenter of fteeple-houfes, and an enemy to the elect." The crowd now firft recognized Mrs* Tone. The carriages flopped. Mr. Fitz* maurice, with the alertnefs of youth, leaped to the ground, and, penetrating through the crowd, recognized Pobjoy, without hat or wig, fitting in the ftocks, half dead with rage and intoxication. The confta¬ ble, w r ho now firft learned ihat Mrs. Tone was arrived, grew alarmed, and was pre¬ paring to releafe the delinquent; but Mr. Fitzmaurice prevented him, and advancing to the carriages, begged the whole party to alight. Mrs. Tone was ready to fink into the earth with vexation. " Oh, {\c upon it, fie upon it, Mr. Pobjoy !" exclaimed flic, iC who could have thought you guilty of back- Aiding and iniquity." " Fie upon yourfelf, you jade !" cried Pobjoy, without opening his eyes (for he apprehended if he favv nobody, nobody could
could fee him). " Fie upon me, indeed ! 1*11 take the law, J have as much right to kifs the parfon's daughters as any other. Did not I marry the fifter of the nephew of the rich Mr. Rigby's widow that was ?" " Aye, aye/* faid the conftable, (who would have releafed the prifoner if Mr* Fitzmaurice had not prevented him) " but Parfon Plowden fays, that if you was the re-* lation of the Queen of Shebcar^ or the Arch- bifliop of Canterbury himfelf, you fliould not confult his daughters. Don't you know Madam Rigby—I mean Madam Tone, Mafter Pobjoy ?" * c I know fhe is an old fool, and ought to be whipped at the cart's tail for marrying a man young enough to be her grandfon j and I know you are a rogue, and ought to be hanged* I'll take the law of you all! Why don't you let me out ? My leg is al¬ moft broke. Is this a way to ufe a body ?" " Oh, Mr. Pobjoy," exclaimed Mrs* Tone, " tliink not of fuch trifling fubiu- iiary concerns. What is a broken leg to a broken
broken fpirit ? What is a body to a foul ? What is------" " What is cat-and-a-fiddle ?" roared Pobjoy i ** who made you a ruler and a judge over us, pray ?

My eftate was twice, aye four times as large as hers, and now flie gets me to be fleward, in order to have me clapped in the flocks!" This oration, which was interrupted by frequent
frequent hiccups, and nodding from fide to fide, failed not to open the flood-gates of Mrs. Tone's eloquence. She compared him to Judas, who bore the bag; to Shcmci, who flung ftones at the righteous; io Aaron, who fet up the golden calf; and to Solo¬ mon, who ran after ftrange women. " I wifh they were all in thc flocks," roared Pobjo}^, 6i and that you had a locked jaw, and fee if I would help you to your clack again. If I muft fit here, leave me alone, cant you r I want to fleep, fo don't keep fuch a curfed chattering/* Mrs. Tone eleclaied that he had cloathed himfelf with iniquity as with a garment; and began to hold forth on thc enormity of his conduct, to the great entertainment of Mr. Fitzmaurice, but not to the edification of Pobjoy, who fcllfaft aflcep. Mrs. Tone, unable to bear her ridiculous fituation, burft into tears. Edward now fhook Pobjoy by the Ihoulder; and had not his uncle entreated him to defift, would have releafed the prifoner from wooden durance*
durance,—Pobjoy flowly waked: he opened his eyes with a noife between a ya« n and a howl; but gazed with a vacant flare and open mouth, when he beheld v\ho we^e ti.-j fpcftators of his difgrace. Mrs. Tone, who thought the iituation of her fleward a reflection on herfeif, now ad¬ vanced, and with a half-fubmiffive, half-au¬ thoritative voice, bade the conftable relcafe the pri loner from the engine of ihame* Mr. Fitzmaurice would not, however, permit him, and Edward was about t,o plead the feelings of his mother and Anaftatia, when Pobjoy, frightened into fobriety, exclaimed—" Oh, the wickednefs of this world! Yes, Mr. Eel- ward Fitzmaurice, I fee how it is — you would prevent your good and pious aunt from releafing me: but thou art a fon of Belial, and abomination is under thy tongue, — Good madam* liften not to that fprout of Satan's own rearing.—You did right to cut him down, and caft him into the fire :—he is not aa ingredient for the pottage of the elect*
elect, As for the other trunk of wick¬ ednefs, Withers, he will only fet the coun* try in a flame'—-he is a jacobin, and an Irifli defender—he will try to talk money out of your pockets. Worthy lady, order me to be releafed, and I will affert my in* nocences—lean prove the malice of my perfecutors, and will plainly fhew, that thefe two bowers of the knee to Baal, have been lurking in difguife about the country, to kill me and burn the manfioivhoufe. Ah ! pious lady! if you did but know the good care I have taken of your noble eftate!—how I have raifed the rents!" ------> u Yes, that you have!" cried a woman, with a child in her arms — ** You have raifed the rents, that it is a fhame to be thought on:—it is no wonder that you now wear filk flocking?, and thingumcries at the wrihYes:—but nc> one's above the law :— the king and Madam Tone herfeif are notr above thc law, fo I*m glad you've met your defarts, you ikhvflint:—if you was to fit there t-:i
till I let you out again, you would know the place when you faw it again, I warrant." At length, Mr. Fitzmaurice, in compli¬ ance with the intreaties of Edward, com¬ manded thc conftable to (et thc poor ftew* ard at liberty. The villagers made bon- tires in honour of Mrs. Tone; for they were ignorant that ihe was no longer lady of the manor. Mrs, Fitzmaurice and Anaftatia were ab¬ fent on a vifit to a female goffip, who lived about five miles from Athacombe, and were not expected for two or three days. Mrs. Tone officiated as miftrefs of the houfe, and feemed tolerably reconciled to her fituation. The next morning, Mr. Fitzmaurice pro* pofed to examine the worthy (toward; but he was not to be found: entvuiries were made, but in vain. At length a little boy was feen lurking about the houic: on be¬ ing emellioned as to his deligns, he confess¬ ed that he was commimoned by Mr. Pob~ joy to ileal an old black latin waiftcoat, which
which was hid in the hay-loft. The boy was fecured, the loft fearchcd, and the waift- coat found. The pocket contained a letter, addrcllcd io Edward—-it was from his mo-^ then—She informed him, that Mr. Pobjoy made many objections to her fending him any relief; but ihe could not find it in her heart to eefert him; flie fent him fifty pounds, (the note was inclofed) and added, that Anafiatia would gladly contribute to his com¬ fort, if Mr. Pobjoy were lefs rigorous, for he never let her have a penny at her own difpofal This letter, in fome degree, foftened the anger of Mr. Fitzmaurice againft Anafta¬ tia and her mother. Having learned from the boy that the apothecary was at the fign of the goat-in-boots, he ordered his fervants to bring him back to the manfion-houfe. But Pobjoy, fearing fome accident might have befallen his meffenger, had already de¬ parted. He, however, by miftake, had thir¬ teen hundred pounds in his pocket, the pro¬ perty
perty of Mrs. Tone : thefe he never thought of returning. . Mr. Fitzmaurice would have doubled ihe income of Helen, but flie would not permit him: flie fitted up a fmall, but elegant cottage, where flie lives with her mo¬ ther and fitter, devoting her time to the edu¬ cation of the children of the latter. Pobjoy has never been heard of, and it is fuppofed he failed for America. Augufta's recovery being hopelefs, her brother, loid Delvalley, took poffeifion ©flier property, and fhe was removed to an afylum for lunatics, where flie remains a fad monument of the effects of unreftraincd pafSons, Mary Collins and the footman of Ainflie were both executed for a forgery; the former, "after condemnation, wrote to Mrs. Beddonfe, acknowledging her evil deeds: the good lady made every apology to Selina, who was hap¬ py to embrace the fofterer of her youth. Ainflie ftill walks about Bond-ftreet, is ftill a fharper, and has almoft fciuandered the large f
large property of lady Margaret: when for¬ tune declares againft liim, he will fink to that contempt his vices and follies expofe him to; while Edward and Selina, by acling from principle, enjoy the greateft happinefs known to mortality.

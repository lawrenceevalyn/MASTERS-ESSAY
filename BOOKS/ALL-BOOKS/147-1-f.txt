THE 



BRIDAL OF DUNAMOUE. 



CHAPTER I. 



" A rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood. 
A narrow plain spreads beneath, covered with grass and 
aged trees, which the midnight winds, in their wrath, had 
torn from the shaggy rock. The blue course of a stream is 
there, and the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle's 
beard.'' 

i\T a considerable distance from the me- 
tropolis, a wild and solitary tract, known 
by the name of Dunamore, stretches itself 
along the eastern coast of Ireland, form- 
ing part of the inheritance of the ancient 
family of Glenmorlie, that for a succession 
B 2

of ages resided here, in an old abbey, ro- 
mantically situated at some distance from 
the village. 

This, much frequented in summer as a 
bathing-place, is built on the decline of a 
steep hill, gradually sinking into a fine 
strand, whence the green cliffs, darting 
into immense headlands, form a noble but 
dangerous bay, from the iron-bound nature 
of the coast. Hence to the abbey appears 
little better than a desert ; there the woods 
that partially screen its time-struck towers, 
where whistles in the sighing breeze the 
dark mass of years, again give sign of cul- 
tivation. 

The village, though chiefly consisting 
of poor straggling houses, is not unplea- 
sant to the eye, from its romantic appear- 
ance, perched as are some of the buildings 
on high rocks, while others lie nestling in 
snug hollows, as if to screen themselves 
from the fury of the storms, that are here 
tremendous. 

Exposed to all the fury of the ocean, 
nature's barriers alone could here resist 



the waves that break and dash against 
the shore, with a noise resembling the dis- 
charge of the loudest artillery. This ex- 
posure gives, in general, a bleakness to 
the aspect of the place, though in sum- 
mer the fields and rocks are bestrewed 
with aromatic herbs and wild flowers, 
while wild honeysuckles and roses com- 
pose the hedges â€” a bleakness heightened, 
in some parts, to desolation, by the inter- 
mixture of bog, heath, and rocks, in the 
fields, the solitary bays that indent the 
coast, and the abject poverty of the poor 
cotters â€” a poverty, however, that has no 
effect on their characteristic cheerfulness. 
Most of the old customs are here kept up 
â€” the holidays enjoyed with even luxuri- 
ous indolence â€” the jig-houses filled of an 
evening, and the wakes attended with all 
that boisterous mirth that is certainly re- 
volting to the feelings of a stranger, though 
perhaps more owing to indifference about 
death than any want of natural feeling. 
When Johnson viewed the luxuries of 
Garrick's villa at Hampton â€” " These are 



the things," he said, " David, that make 
a man unwilling to die." Certain it is, 
that either owing to the slavish life they 
lead, or some other cause, the common 
Irish seldom evince any concern about 
death ; at all times speaking with calmness, 
and even pleasure, of the spot in which 
they expect to rest ; and if ever evincing 
any thing like anxiety on the subject of 
their death, only about their wake and 
funeral ; thus setting an example of com- 
posure and resignation on it, that even 
philosophy, at times, might fail of doing. 

The strand, in fine weather, is a de- 
lightful promenade; nor is a walk over the 
cliffs unpleasant to those who have cou- 
rage for it, rent as they are into frightful 
fissures, where one false step must be in- 
evitable destruction. Nor does the place 
altogether want attraction during the sum- 
mer months, when even the Persian looms 
themselves could not produce such a car- 
peting as covers the rocks and fields ; but 
when again the glooms, the storms of win- 
ter, prevail â€” when again the savage blast 



howls round the casement, " the flaky 
snow descends, and even the faithful dog 
seems conscious of his shivering masters 
misery," it is then indeed sufficiently de- 
solate to chill the feelings. This however 
was not exactly the case, through the hos- 
pitable kindness they made a point of 
shewing to all within the reach of its in- 
fluence, during the residence of the Glen- 
morlie family at the place ; but for years 
previous to the period at which this story 
commences, it had been entirely given up 
to the care of domestics. 

Mr. Glenmorlie, its proprietor, long, 
long before its desertion, was a gentleman 
that, even in his day, when hospitality 
was so common as scarcely to be estimated 
as a virtue, was praised and celebrated 
for his. His fortune was immense, his 
establishment noble, and his door open to 
all ; but while the rich and elegant par- 
took of his sumptuous banquet, the needy 
and the friendless were cheered by his 
bounty. But with all this generosity of 
disposition, there was a selfish considera- 



8 

tion for his own gratification evinced, and 
an openness to flattery that considerably 
took off from his better qualities. 

He was twice married, and by each 
marriage had a son. His last lady was 
beautiful, but unprincipled, and by her 
artful blandishments obtained such an as- 
cendancy over him, as to induce him to 
make a will in favour of her son, to the 
utter prejudice of the one he had by his 
first union. Convinced, however, that by 
doing so he should commit an act that 
would affix a stigma on his name, he en- 
deavoured to excuse, if not justify it, by 
pretending that his eldest son had, in 
many instances, acted in a manner to of- 
fend and disoblige him ; but as he could 
bring forward no specific charge against 
him, this was doubted, and his attempt 
to justify himself at his expence only an 
additional cause for censure and reproach. 
In short, instead of leaving behind him 
that character for unblemished integrity 
he had once enjoyed, he left behind him 
a name stigmatized for injustice. 



But railing, nor raving, nor invective, 
could rend away the seal from the bond. 
The younger son, according to the tenor 
of the will, took possession of the proper- 
ty, with only the exception of a small 
freehold bequeathed to the eldest. The 
friends and connexions of the family, ac- 
cording to their respective interests and 
feelings, sided with the respective parties. 
Proceedings were commenced to set aside 
the will, under the plea of its being made 
under undue influence ; but after a long 
and expensive contest, the suit was ulti- 
mately dropped, and the unfortunate Ro- 
dolphus obliged to abandon all those hopes 
and brilliant expectations he had long in- 
dulged in. Married some years before his 
father's death, a large family aggravated 
his feelings on the occasion. Melancholy 
took possession of him â€” he gave himself 
up to gloom and indolence â€” shrunk even 
from mixing with his own family â€” and 
finally died, a victim to the keen sense he 
entertained of the injury done him. 
B 3

His children, but slenderly provided 
for, were exposed to a variety of priva- 
tions ; and each new trial exciting addi- 
tional ill- will to those who so unjustly 
enjoyed their birthright, there was for a 
time nothing but strife and animosity be- 
tween them. 

In process of time, the fortunate branch 
became ennobled by an earldom. George, 
the second earl of Dunamore, was a man 
of a proud and austere temper, tenacious 
of worldly respect, and boastful of here- 
ditary distinctions. With such a disposi- 
tion, it may be supposed he could not 
think, without an unpleasant sensation, on 
the blot on his escutcheon ; but while it 
rankled in his recollection, making him 
often feel a sense of degradation under the 
fortune he enjoyed, he at the same time 
indignantly repelled the slightest allusion 
to the act by which he had become the 
representative of his ancient house. 

But though impelled by pride to at- 
tempt its vindication, he was, in reality, 
so impressed with a conviction of its in- 



11 

justice, as to be anxious in the extreme 
to make every amends in his power for it 
to the party it had injured; but hitherto 
his efforts for the purpose had been haugh- 
tily repulsed. Of the legal heir, one de- 
scendant now alone remained, a young 
lad, residing with his grandmother in the 
ruins of an old castle, that stood upon the 
small estate bequeathed to his progenitor. 
Of this small property little now remained; 
and lord Dunamore repeatedly offered to 
take the boy under his protection ; but 
his grandmother, born herself a Glenmor- 
lie, and brought up with all those feelings 
that a sense of injury excites, scornfully 
rejected these offers ; preferring rather to 
see her grandson, though the idol of her 
heart, want the advantages of education 
and patronage, than owe an obligation to 
the person who enjoyed his birthright ; 
several friends interfered on the occasion, 
but her obstinacy was invincible. 

The boy himself said nothing on the 
subject. Of a mild and passive temper, 
he seemed perfectly content to resign him- 



12 

self to her will ; he was indeed a melan- 
choly wight â€” 

" Baubles be heeded not, nor gauds, nor toy, 
And yet poor William was no vulgar boy;" 

seeming not to desire a higher enjoyment 
than was derived from loitering over the 
]ieglected fields â€” indolently watching the 
waves breaking on the shore â€” or being 
listlessly stretched upon the grass, poring 
upon the brook that babbled by. 

But the sudden death of his grandmo- 
ther put an end to all further opposition 
to the wishes of lord Dunamore, who no 
sooner learned the event than he had him 
brought to the abbey. At first William 
was shy and fearful, nor did he ever seem 
as if he felt himself at home. The earl 
tried to inspire him with a wish to enter 
life, but in vain ; and at last became sa- 
tisfied to let him remain as he pleased. 

The family of lord Dunamore consisted 
of his lady and one daughter, about the 
age of William, and, like him, of rather a 
melancholy turn, and inclined to loneli- 
ness, and gloom, and superstition. Many 



13 

circumstances had conspired to occasion 
this, and depress the natural cheerfulness 
of youth â€” the incurable sorrow of the 
countess her mother for the premature 
death of a number of children, had con- 
verted Dunamore Abbey, from a residence 
of festive hospitality, to one of melancholy 
seclusion; and this, together with the 
neighbourhood of the abbey, had early 
contributed to give a gloom to her temper. 
The gloom which a melancholy country 
is apt to diffuse over the fancy has been 
described as compatible enough with oc- 
casional and social merriment, but by no 
means to be experienced without danger 
in solitude ; and in this, through the dis- 
taste conceived by her mother to society, 
lady Elenora had been brought up ; and 
hence, without any thing to vary the 
scene, or give excitement to Iier spirits, it 
is not to be wondered at that her mind 
became imbued with that deep melancholy 
that renders it particularly susceptible of 
fearful impressions, by a place where " the 
mournful dashing of the waves," the por- 



u 

tentous noises which every change of wind, 
and every increase and diminution of the 
waters, are apt to raise in a lonely region, 
full of chasms and rocks, continually met 
her ear; and the aspect of nature was 
often as dismal and distressing. There 
were people who said, the severe afflictions 
of her parents were but a just judgment 
for their enjoyment of what they possessed ; 
and the idea never recurred that she did 
not tremble with presageful fears of far- 
ther visitations to their house. 

But though she did not mix in life, she 
was neither unseen nor unthought of 
Shortly after William's taking up his re- 
sidence in the family, she became the wife 
of her cousin, sir George Glenmorlie ; and 
in process of time William himself led to 
the hymeneal altar a young lass, for whom 
he had early conceived a boyish regard. 

Unfortunate as her mother, however, 
of a numerous offspring one daughter only 
was spared to lady Elenora ; and, finally, 
like her, in deep affliction at these depri- 
vations, she, in a degree, withdrew from 



15 

the world, and fixed her permanent abode 
at Dunamore. 

While her daughter was yet an infant, 
the earl and countess died, and shortly 
after William and his wife, leaving be- 
hind them an infant son, whom lady Ele- 
nora, then countess of Dunamore in her 
own right, immediately adopted; and, 
nestled in the very bosom of pity and 
kindness, the little orphan felt no want of 
those he had lost. 



CHAPTER II. 



Next to her own daughter, he soon be- 
came the object of her greatest tenderness, 
and sir George not only seemed to share 
in her affection, but to concur in all her 
plans and projects for him. In reality, 
however, he did neither, regarding him 
with an eye of envy and ill-will, instead 
of kindness, and secretly determining on 



16 

traversing, if possible, his benefactress's in- 
tentions respecting him. 

These she had no hesitation in reveal- 
ing to sir George. It was her wish to 
have a marriage effected between him and 
her daughter ; led by a superstitious feel- 
ing to believe, that the severe calamities 
she and her mother had experienced 
were a punishment from Heaven for the 
sins of others. 

Sir George scoffed at the idea, and 
would have openly opposed her wishes, 
but that she had too much in her power 
to allow him to run the risk of provoking 
her. As a means however of disap- 
pointing them, he determined on detach- 
ing his daughter, as much as possible, 
from her; and accordingly making her 
disinclination to enter the world again a 
pretext for committing her in a great de- 
gree to the care of her aunt, lady Am- 
bresbury, he invited her ladyship over 
from England, where she was settled, to 
the Irish capital, where the young lady 
was so well managed, as by degrees to 



17 

imbibe something very like contempt for 
her mother and her protegee, and finally 
decide on giving her hand, in due time, to 
her cousin, the young lord Ambresbury ; 
but, in order to prevent the chance of any 
ill consequence from this, it was deter- 
mined that it should not be announced to 
the countess till it was first tried whether 
it could not be made to appear that it 
was owing to Henry himself that his mar- 
riage with her had not taken place. 

In the neighbourhood of the abbey 
was a gay pleasant family, of the name of 
Keating, but between whom and the fa- 
mily there a kind of hereditary dislike 
had long subsisted. There was a number 
of young people belonging to it, and from 
a double motive the countess had early 
cautioned Henry against forming any ac- 
quaintance at the house. For a time he 
scrupulously attended to the caution, but 
the emissaries of sir George were at work ; 
and by degrees, spite of all his resolves 
and precautions, Henry was drawn in to 
form an intimacy there. Once formed, it 



18 

was too delightful to wish to relinquish 
it, tired as he was of the eternal sameness 
of the abbey, where, from one end of the 
year to the other, all went on in the same 
dull, uninteresting, monotonous kind of 
manner, for he had none of the drov/sy 
indolent propensities of his father ; on the 
contrary, he was all animation and enter- 
prise, and would early have entered the 
army, but for his patroness. Ever on the 
alert with regard to him, she soon disco- 
vered the cause of these now-frequent ab- 
sences from home that had alarmed her 
suspicions, and quickly took him to task 
about it. 

Henry, all regret and repentance for 
having disobliged her, gave her every as- 
surance she could desire of greater steadi- 
ness for the future, and for a time ad- 
hered to his promise ; but the temptation 
to break it was resistless ; one of the con- 
sequences that sir George, when secretly 
laying himself out to get him drawn into 
an intimacy with the Keatings, had fore- 
seen as likely to result from it, had oc- 



19 

curred. He had fallen in love with one 
of the handsome daughters of Mr. Keat- 
ing, and to persevere in keeping away 
from her residence was more than he had 
resolution to do. 

The consequence of the renewal of their 
intimacy was a speedy marriage. Her 
parents could give her no fortune, and 
making sure of Henry's being amply pro- 
vided for by his patrons^ they not only 
readily consented to their union, but did 
all in their power to hasten and promote 
it ; but once secure of her (and Henry's 
courage almost failed him), he knew not 
how, without a friend to soften matters 
for him, to declare at the abbey what he 
had done ; for sir George had artfully con- 
trived to impress him with a conviction 
that he, even more than the countess, dis- 
liked the Keatings. However, it must be 
done ; and so, accordingly, a few days after 
his â€” he could hardly tell whether or not 
half- repented marriage, he repaired to the 
countess's dressing-room, where the chief 



20 

part of every day was passed in reading 
or working. It was an upper apartment, 
for the sake of the prospect, and looked 
down upon a steep chasm at the side of 
the building, where a turbulent mountain 
stream dashed onward towards the sea, 
through masses of broken rock. â€” " Well, 
what news, Henry ?" she demanded, as 
he entered ; her usual question whenever 
he returned from any ramble. 

He shook his head. â€” " Oh, none !" 

" Well, according to the old adage, 
* No news is good news." 

" Not always," said Henry, as he threw 
himself dejectedly on a chair. 

" Why, what's the matter ?" with a 
good-natured smile, and for the first time 
attentively observing him ; " you look as 
dull this morning as an old judge. Have 
you spoiled your new fowliiig-piece, or 
has Miss Beauty got lame ? or has the 
purse got low sooner than was expected ? 
or have you been disappointed of a card 
for the approaching ball at Waterton ?" 



21 

" No â€” nothing of this kind has hap- 
pened to trouble me, and yet troubled I 
am." 

" So T perceive. Come, relieve your 
mind, by telling me what it is about ?" 

" I fear," said Henry. 

" Then I am to infer it is something 
that will make me very angry." 

" Oh, so I dread, so I dread !" said 
Henry, starting up and traversing the 
room with unequal steps ; " but I swear," 
he continued, suddenly stepping before 
her, " that to atone for what I have done, 
there is nothing, in consequence, that I 
will not do." 

" Very well, proceed to confession then, 
and by the time you have concluded, I 
shall consider what penance to inflict. 
But I hope, Henry," suddenly changing 
her tone, and regarding him with auste- 
rity, " it is not any thing about the Keat- 
ings I am to hear ?" 

Henry, for a moment, hid his face in 
his hands ; then, throwing himself at her 
feet, he confessed his marriage ; " and 



now," cried he, *' that you know all, 
what would you have me do? for I am 
aware of what I have to fear from sir 
George." 

" Then, upon my honour !" said her 
ladyship, laying her hand upon her heart, 
" since you ask me, I see nothing for you 
but to open one of the windows here, and 
leap out." 

" I will not break my word this time," 
said Henry, and starting up, he flew to a 
window. 

She rushed after him. â€” " Witless boy !" 
she exclaimed, throwing herself upon his 
arm, " what do you mean ?" 

" To obey you," replied Henry. 

" Obey me !" she reproachfully repeat- 
ed, as she closed the window ; " when to 
do so would have been to make me hap- 
py, you refused. Unfortunate boy !" she 
exclaimed, as she threw herself, overpow- 
ered by emotion, on a chair, " what will 
become of you ? Madly â€” rashly, you 
have defeated â€” frustrated my intentions, 
disappointed my hopes, and blighted all 



your own prospects â€” prospects that the 
proudest, the greatest, might have envied 
you. But go â€” I cannot compose myself 
while you remain here." 

Henry sorrowfully obeyed, with a sting 
in his heart at the idea of what it was 
now evident his folly had lost him. But 
his aifection for his gentle Rose was too 
sincere to permit him long to regret what 
he had lost by his marriage with herâ€” -"And 
yet, on her account, poor innocent wretch !" 
be cried, " should I not regret it ; for to 
what misery probably has it been the 
means of dooming her ?" 

Scarcely could sir George, under the 
semblance of stern displeasure, conceal the 
joy he felt at the communication of his 
lady ; but while he artfully kept this up, 
he affected to be ready to have something 
done for Henry. 

Great was the pleasure of the countess 
at hearing this, as she would not have 
liked to have acted in opposition to his 
will, and yet would have been miserable 



24> 

to have had no provision ^de for the of- 
fender. 

Completely deceived by sir George, she 
readily consented to let him arrange all 
matters respecting him. This was all he 
wanted to prevent the alienation of the 
large property she had at her control, and 
to which indeed was owing his fear of of- 
fending her. Henry was speedily given 
to understand that he never would be re- 
ceived at the abbey again, but that, on 
condition of his leaving the kingdom im- 
mediately, he should receive two thousand 
pounds. 

Great was the indignation of Henry at 
this attempt to banish him the kingdom, 
by those who, if he had not been an in- 
jured person, would have had no power 
to prescribe to him. The recollection of 
this, he thought, when the first burst of 
indignation at his conduct had subsided, 
should have operated to prevent any thing 
so wounding to his feelings; and under this 
idea, for a time, he indignantly hesitated 



2f5 

to accept what was offered to his accep- 
tance. But his situation was desperate. 
Of the wretched patrimony inherited from 
his father, there was not sufficient for 
even the necessaries of life. His wife's 
family neither could nor would do any 
thing for her, if they had had the power, 
now that they saw, by his being thrown 
off by his patrons, they should derive 
none of those advantages from her alliance 
with him that they had expected ; and fi- 
nally he was forced to subscribe to the 
conditions of sir George. 

Matters were so arranged that the 
countess knew nothing of his departure 
till he was far on his way from the king- 
dom. She was all despair and repentance 
on hearing it, blaming herself for her 
harshness towards him. The marriage of 
her daughter with her cousin immediately 
after took place, and from this period the 
countess was never more seen or heard of, 
except as a being of deranged intellects. 

Sir George did not survive the marriage 
VOL. T. c 



of his daughter above a few years ; but bis 
death occasioned no change in the con- 
dition of the countess ; she still continued 
under the control of creatures entirely de- 
voted to him and lady Ambresbury, 
whose only care about her was, that she 
should be kept out of the sight of any 
one who could detect the fallacy of the 
reports spread about her, in order to inva- 
lidate any instrument which she might 
have privately executed in favour of 
Henry. 

That she could not but sometimes feel 
some compunctious visitings of nature for 
this conduct to a parent who had always 
merited the appellation of one, may be 
supposed ; but still, as they occurred, she 
flew to dissipation to banish them. 

The property of lord Ambresbury lay 
in England, and there their residence was 
fixed. A son and daughter constituted 
their family. Edwald, a fine, noble, 
handsome, open-hearted youth, was about 
seventeen when he took a romantic whim 
into his head of visiting the old abbey 



27 

at Dunamore, of which he had heard so 
many curious records and traditions. With 
some difficulty he obtained permission, but 
on the express condition of his not attempt- 
ing to see his grandmother, under the 
pretext of a melancholy impression being 
likely to be made upon his mind by her 
sight. 

In compliance with this stipulation, he 
was for some time at the abbey withou 
attempting a thing of the kind, when one 
of the old domestics that had been dis- 
missed, obtaining admission to him, gave 
him such hints as led him, without further 
delay, to seek the apartments where she 
was secluded, and introduce himself to 
her. The result of this was a terrible 
conviction on the mind of Edwald, that 
she had been the victim of the greatest 
injustice and cruelty ; and with all the 
warmth of youth and feeling, he would at 
once have stood forth her champion, had 
she permitted ; but by this time complete- 
ly subdued by age and sorrow, and un- 
c 2, 



willing to expose her daughter to that 
stigma she was aware must attach to her, 
were her unnatural conduct disclosed, she 
declined letting him risk embroiling him- 
self with his family on her account, satis- 
fied that from what she saw of his dispo- 
sition, she might depend on his solemn 
promise of befriending Henry or his fami- 
ly, should they ever come in his way, and 
on whose account alone she could have 
wished for his interference for her. 

From this time Edwald was in the 
habit of making frequent excursions to 
the abbey. His real motive for them was 
carefully concealed, and he had the satis- 
faction of thinking he greatly contributed 
to making the poor recluse there some 
amends for the past. 

All his generous feelings awakened 
about Henry and his family. He lost no 
time in contriving to have inquiries made 
after him, but to no purpose ; from the 
time of his leaving Ireland, he had never 
been heard of, and by many it was be*: 
lieved that he and his wife were dead. 



$6 

He was near twenty when his grand- 
mother died, and his mother immediately 
succeeded to the title and estate of Duna- 
more ; and now that the former could not 
be injured by the disclosure, he revealed 
to the latter all that he had become ac- 
quainted with at the abbey, with an ear- 
nest request that she would promise to 
be the friend of Henry or his family, if it 
could be discovered either that he was 
living, or had left any. 

Far however from complying with 
this request, she accused him of credulous 
folly, for ever having given credit to the 
statement that had occasioned it ; and fi- 
nally concluded by declaring, that nothing 
should ever induce her to trouble herself 
about those for whom he so ridiculously 
interested himself.

CHAPTER III. 



She, with her widow'd mother, 
Liv'd in a cottage, far retir'd 
Among the windings of a woody vale. 
By solitude and deep-surrounding shades^ 
But more by bashful modesty, concealed. 



The modest virtues mingled in her eyes', 
Still on the ground, dejected, darting all 
Their humid beams into the blooming flowers ; 
Or, when the mournful tale her mother told, 
Of what their faithless fortune promis'd once, 
Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy star 
Of evening, shone in tears. Kookhy Hall. 

Sweetly sequestered in woods stood the 
ancient seat of the still more ancient fami- 
ly of Ambresbury, in Wiltshire. Several 
fine pieces of water, dispersed through 
the grounds, with the river Avon flowing 
at the bottom of the extensive gardens, 
augmented the beauty of the situation. 
Ai picturesque bridge, thrown across the 



SI 

river, led to a finely-wooded hill, whence 
there was an extensive view of the neigh- 
bouring downs, and a fine tract of coun- 
try. 

Nothing could exceed the beauty and 
grandeur of the forest scenery about the 
mansion. Towards the extremity of the 
park it was of a less magnificent, but 
perhaps more picturesque description, the 
rugged thorn and hardy fir there predo- 
minating over the oak, the ash, and the 
elm ; but the glades among them, with 
their trooping deer, were inexpressibly 
beautiful, from their silvan softness. In 
one of the most sequestered of these stood 
a small cottage, rudely fenced in by old 
massy paling, and lost in the unpruned 
luxuriance of the honeysuckle and roses 
that rambled over it. In this lived the 
widow and daughter of Henry â€” in this 
sought to shun 

The cruel scorn 
WHiich virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet 
rrom giddy passion and low-minded pride.

Henry quitted Ireland for America on 
a speculative plan. It did not answer ; 
and after many years of painful vicissitude, 
he died without the comfort of thinking 
he had been able to realize any provision 
for his family, and in consequence en- 
joined his wife to return without delay to 
Europe, to see what could be done there 
amongst their connexions for them, from 
whom he now regretted having suffered 
his resentful feelings to occasion so com- 
plete an estrangement. 

In compliance with this injunction, his 
widow prepared, immediately after his 
decease, for her departure thence; but her 
daughter only accompanied her. They 
had formed an intimacy with the com- 
manding officer of a British regiment sta- 
tioned near the place where they resided, 
and his family ; and having heard their 
story, and pitying the situation of the 
widow, he kindly offered to take her son 
under his protection, and procure him a 
commission.

Mrs. Glenmorlie landed in England, 
and thence immediately vv^rote to Ireland, 
to make inquiries after their connexions 
there. The result of these was most dis- 
tressing : of her own family, scarcely one 
remained, and none that had either ability 
or inclination to serve her ; and lady Du- 
namore was no more. As soon as she had 
a little recovered from the shock imparted 
to her feelings by these disastrous tidings, 
she decided on trying, as her last hope, 
what an application to the present lady 
Dunamore would do, and accordingly pro- 
ceeded to Wiltshire. At first she thought 
of a personal application ; but when she 
reflected on her character, which she had 
early understood, she decided on writing, 
her mind being too sore, her spirit too 
wounded, to be able to endure the ap- 
prehension of encountering scorn, or cold- 
ness, or derision ; and accordingly stop- 
ping at a small inn contiguous to the 
park, thence dispatched a letter to her, 
c 3 



S4> 

detailing her situation, and imploring re- 
lief. 

In vain she appealed to the humanity 
of lady Dunamore : humanity for her ex- 
isted not in her breast. She knew not 
how it was, but she had always felt as if 
the possessions of her house were not se- 
cure, while any of the injured branch re- 
mained in existence. To afford them the 
means, therefore, of endeavouring to sup- 
port this, was not by any means her plan, 
and an answer accordingly, of the most 
unfeeling description, was returned to the 
application for this, containing a positive 
prohibition against ever being troubled by 
one of the kind again. 

None but those who know what it is 
to have hope extinguished within their 
bleeding bosom, can picture to themselves 
what the unfortunate Mrs. Glenmorlie 
felt at the receipt of this letter. Her brain 
became nearly bewildered by her situa- 
tion, the expences of travelling having, 
by this time, nearly exhausted her means* 



35 

In this terrible predicament she heard, by 
chance, that there was a small cottage to 
let hard by, and it instantly occurred to 
her to become its tenant, till she could 
collect herself, and see to what account 
the few articles of value she had remaining 
could be turned. Her plan was soon car- 
ried into effect; but she had not been 
long in her new abode, when terror, anx- 
iety, and fatigue, brought on a fever that 
endangered her life. 

It was now the turn of Constance to 
feel despair, and no language could give 
utterance to the horrors that assailed 
her. She not only beheld herself on 
the point of losing her mother, but of 
losing her without human aid or con- 
solation for herself at the dreadful mo- 
ment, and with difficulty could she pre- 
vent herself from shrieking aloud in the 
wild anguish of her soul. At length she 
suddenly decided on writing to Edwald, 
and her whirling brain got cool on form- 
ing the decision. She had heard some- 
thing of him â€” that he was reckoned ami- 



$6 

able and feeling, and she determined to 
put him to the test. 

The astonishment of Edwald at the re- 
ceipt of this letter may easily be con- 
ceived, given up, as he had, by this time, 
almost all hope of ever hearing any thing 
of the family. That which had led to it he 
lost not a moment in realizing; and if pity 
and interest had previously been excited 
by it, how were they heightened on be- 
holding the writer ! But we shall pass 
over the scene that ensued : suffice it, that 
every thing that was requisite being now 
provided for Mrs. Glenmorlie, her disor- 
der speedily took a favourable turn ; and 
the tranquillity imparted to her mind, by 
the knowledge of having obtained such a 
friend, as soon as she was in a condition 
to hear the circumstance, quickly effected 
her complete recovery. 

There was no longer a necessity for her 
remaining in this obscure retreat, but the 
importunities of Edwald prevailed on her 
to do so. He could not elsewhere, at pre- 



37 

sent, enjoy their society, and he could not 
bear the idea of relinquishing it ; but 
when by degrees she perceived indications 
of a growing attachment between him 
and Constance, she began to repent her 
acquiescence in his wishes. 

Trembling at the idea of her daughter's 
peace being trifled with, she shortly came 
to an explanation on the subject with 
him. The result quieted every appre- 
hension. He avowed the most ardent 
passion ; mentioned the sanction he was 
convinced it would have received from his 
grandmother, had she been living ; and fi- 
nally, by his arguments and representations, 
prevailed on Mrs. Glenmorlie to consent 
to his marriage with Constance as soon as 
he was of age ; till when he feared indu- 
cing her to become his, lest, through the 
arbitrary temper of his parents, of involv- 
ing her in any thing unpleasant. 

What moments of ecstacy were these 
that were now passed at the cottage ! The 
anxious heart of the mother, at rest about 
the future prospects of her child ; the 



S8 

child assured, for the remainder of her 
days, of a generous protector ; and the 
lover, of clasping, in his selected bride, 
all that high fancy forms, or lavish hearts 
can wish ! 

How impatiently did he fly from com- 
pany, to wander with her through the fo- 
rest glades â€” to feel her hanging on his 
arm â€” to read in those eyes, so sweet and 
so sedate, the varying emotions of her 
soul. 

Once led to regard him as her future 
husband, the sensitive Constance no longer 
shrunk back from listening to the avowal 
of his attachment ; and in giving utter- 
ance to its impassioned effusions â€” in pic- 
turing to her scenes of anticipated bliss, 
be experienced a happiness transcending 
what he had ever before experienced. 

But malignant eyes were upon them â€” 
his frequent absences from home, his ab- 
tracted manner when there, and the vague 
excuses he made for not pursuing his 
usual sports and exercises, at length began 
to alai-m his mother; inquiries were the 



S9 

consequence of her suspicions, and the re- 
sult of these a discovery of the continu- 
ance of Mrs. Glenmorlie in her neighbour- 
hood, and his attachment to her daughter. 

How did she now regret from selfish- 
ness not having afforded her the means of 
quitting it ! But it was not too late, she 
trusted, to remedy the mischief that had 
ensued from her obduracy to the applica- 
tion for this. She acquainted lord Am- 
bresbury with the discovery she had made, 
and a plan was laid between them for get- 
ting Edwald away. Open opposition to 
his wishes, they were aware, would prove 
ineffectual, and they accordingly decided 
on having recourse to artifice, for prevent- 
ing what filled them with indignation but 
to think of 

Lord Ambresbury suddenly pretended 
to be summoned to France by a dying 
friend, and desired Edwald to prepare to 
accompany him. Edwald knew not how 
to refuse, and yet most unwilling was he 
to consent ; but it was impossible for him 
not to do so ; and a hasty leave of the dear 



m 

inmates of the cottage was the conse- 
quence. Of his truth, his sincerity, nei- 
ther mother nor daughter had the slight- 
est doubt ; neither, from the artful way in 
which matters had been managed at the 
Hall, of any treachery there ; and yet, not- 
withstanding all this, a presageful fear 
seized the heart of each on his intended 
journey being announced, and all that had 
so recently seemed certain and secure ap- 
peared to dissolve away, like a glittering 
illusion before their eyes. 

He had not been long gone, when, re- 
turning one evening from a melancholy 
walk they had been taking in the forest, 
they found Mrs. Glenmorlie's desk broke 
open, and the whole of the money he had 
supplied her with taken away. This was 
a most distressing circumstance ; however, 
the conviction that he would not delay, 
the moment he was acquainted with it, to 
prevent its subjecting them to any incon- 
venience, prevented the consternation it 
excited from being of any long continu- 
ance; and under this conviction, Mrs. 



41 

Glenmorlie not only continued her usual 
expences, but accepted bills for her son, 
which, by the desire of Edward, she had 
written to him to draw on her. The pe- 
riod for settling these was drawing on ; 
and the people she dealt with about the 
place were beginning to get importunate 
for the arrangement of their demands ; but 
still no remittance arrived, neither had one 
line been received from Edward since his 
departure, and she neither knew what to 
think, or what to do. The agony of her 
mind was heightened by the terrible state 
of terror and distress into which the con- 
duct of Edwald had also thrown Con- 
stance ; and, in a word, her strength again 
sunk beneath the conflicts she was endur- 
ing, and her life was despaired of 

Deserted, as she now had reason to be- 
lieve, by the man she loved â€” destitute of 
the means of procuring her mother any 
relief â€” and not only this, but trembling 
every moment with dread of seeing her 
dragged from her dying bed to all the 
horrors of a prison, what did not the mi- 



42 

serable Constance now endure ! Chilled 
with wo, pale, inanimate, loathing life, 
she was kneeling to her God in agony too 
great for utterance, when the name of 
lady Dunamore was whispered in her ear, 
and a gleam of hope diffused itself through 
her anguished heart, under the idea that 
she had discovered her situation, and had 
come, touched at length with pity and 
compassion, to minister to her affliction. 

Lady Dunamore was prepared to see 
loveliness, but not loveliness so perfect, so 
touching, as the wretched Constance's; 
she no longer wondered, on seeing her, at 
the passion of her son. 

The deadly paleness of her face â€” the 
languishing softness of her eyes, denoted 
how much she stood in need of comfort. 
Their silent appeal to the heart was not 
unfelt, and for a moment lady Ambres- 
bury forgot her resentment, and by a 
bursting tear declared her sympathy in the 
sorrow she witnessed. 

Having introduced herself, though the 
ceremony was needless, Constance already 



43 

knowing her by sight, she proceeded to 
explain the purpose of her visit ; she had 
received a letter from her son, she said, 
the effect of due consideration, confessing 
the error he had been guilty of, in think- 
ing â€” of acting, contrary to the wishes 
of his family, and, with her forgiveness 
for it, entreating her to take upon her- 
self the absolving him from the engage- 
ment he had had the imprudence to enter 
into. 

The fainting soul of Constance for a few 
minutes rendered her incapable of hearing 
more ; when she recovered, oh ! to what 
intenseness of agony was it ! Did he then 
wish to break his engagement to her ? and 
was it in such a moment of unbearable 
wo that the cruel avowal was to be made ? 
She cast her appealing eyes to heaven, and 
she implored the God of Mercy to take 
her with her dying mother. 

But the transient emotions of pity over, 
lady Ambresbury was not again to be 
moved by the sight of her distress ; she 
rested not till she had wrung from her 



44 

pale and quivering lips a solemn promise, 
never more to hold intercourse with her 
son, should he have the weakness, the te- 
merity, to think of seeking the renewal 
of their engagement â€” " And for your own 
sake, as well as his, I ask this," she cried, 
" since it must be evident to you, from 
what has occurred, that very little depen- 
dence is to be placed on his steadiness ; 
and that the privations he must incur, 
should he disoblige his father and me, 
would speedily occasion repentance for the 
headlong folly that had drawn them upon 
him." 

But the promise thus extorted was not 
enough ; she proceeded to state that she 
was acquainted with the melancholy con- 
dition of her mother, and perfectly inclin- 
ed to afford all the relief and assistance it 
required, on one condition â€” that was, that 
Constance should consent to give her hand 
immediately to a person who had seen, ad- 
mired her, and was ready to take her as a 
kinswoman of hers ; but on no other, as 
no other could quiet the apprehensions she 



45 

laboured under, of something unpleasant 
yet occurring to her son on her account. 

But this was a condition to which not 
even the necessities of her dying mother 
could induce Constance to accede; she 
shrunk from it in horror and disgust; and 
loading her with reproaches, lady Arabres- 
bury left her. But when, the next day, 
bailiffs entered the house, and she saw an 
effort made to remove her mother from 
the bed, where she appeared to be breath- 
ing her last, how did she shriek, in the 
distraction of her soul, at having hesitated 
about it ! Winged with despair, she flew 
to the inexorable countess, and flinging 
herself at her feet, called upon her to dis- 
pose of her as she pleased, so she would 
rescue her from the horror of the scene 
with which she was threatened. 

No time was lost in taking advantage of 
the terror into which she was thrown. She 
was just of age â€” a licence was therefore pro- 
cured without difficulty ; and ere she well 
knew what she was about, she became the 
wife of a dependent of lord Ambresbury's. 



46 

â€” " Yet, if the sacrifice avails," she cried, 
as she recovered to a perception of the 
misery to which she had doomed herself; 
but, alas! it did not â€” her mother lived 
not to benefit or to suffer by what she had 
done for her ; and, in a state of insensi- 
bility, she was removed from her lifeless 
remains, and immediately taken from the 
neighbourhood, and, through the artful 
management of lady Dunamore, without 
any one either knowing what had hap- 
pened, or whither she was gone.

CHAPTER IV. 



'Tis well â€” 'tis solitude indeed â€” 



*Tis dreadful â€” 'tis superb ! This sacred spot 
No mortal man frequents. Beneath that wall, 
That mouldering threatens ruin on my head, 
I'll sit me down, and let no curious eye 
Trace out ray hallow'd haunt ; let none appear. 
Unless to make the scene more solemn still, 
From out yon tomb its sheeted tenant rise. 
And wail his woes with mine. Love laid him there- 
Rejected love ! e'en then more blest than me. 
Time might have made him happy, and his truth 
Might have rewarded; but, ah! where's the hour ? 
When shall it come to bring me peace again ? 
Can it restore Constantia ? say, shall time 
Open the grave, and force its marble jaws 
To render back to life the beauteous frame 
It has enclos'd ? No, no â€” she's gone for ever â€” 
Ever gone ! 



-Hark ! pretty warbler 



And dost thou mourn thy love too ? how my soul 
Doth pity thee ! 'Tis Philomel; and now. 
Whilst all the forest sleeps, she tells her loss â€” 
Her bitter loss, like mine. Yet she's blest too â€” 
Pass but a summer, a short year^ and then 



48 

She rests ; but I must wear this hated being ; 
Perhaps for me Death has an age to wait : 
And then Heav'n's vengeance 'gainst self-murder ! 
Oh, insupportable ! The horrid thought 
Throws grief on grief; and yet it cannot be â€” 
The wound's too deeply giv'n ; 'tis not long 
That I can last. Oh ! might, my love, thy ghost 
But bless for once ray eyes ! wouldst thou but speak 
The words of peace to my distracted soul, 
I should be happy ! 1 would know the will 
Of Heav'n ; but in this doubtful state I'm curst; 
For there must be a Heav'n â€” nought but that 
Could form thee as thou wast; from thence thou cam'st, 
And thither art return'd. Yet if there be. 
Why are things so ? why am I punish'd thus? 
My love was ever pure as Vestal flames, 
No gross desires ere tainted it ; and thou 
Wast innocence itself. Is there a reason 
I should be tortur'd thus? I've heard 
That souls like thine in shades here oft return'd, 
To soothe their lovers' sorrows, till the time 
Of bliss arrive ; but here no comfort dawns â€” 
No white-rob'd messenger of peace descends â€” 
Nought to my plaint responsive, save the screams 
Of night's foul bird â€” the owl, and hollow groans 
From yon old fane, which, ever and anon, 
With hideous noise, comes tumbling down. 
Inscription in an old ruined Monastery in Normandy. 

While these steps were taken for de- 
stroying the happiness of Edwald by her 
who should have been most zealous to 



49 

promote it, Edwald himself was enduring 
all the tortures of anxiety and suspense. 
In vain was letter after letter dispatched 
to England â€” no answer was ever received ; 
and equally vain were the efforts he made 
to leave his father ; on one pretext or 
other, their stay on the Continent was pro- 
longed, till upwards of a year had ex- 
pired there, and Edwald had become ex- 
hausted, both in body and mind, by what 
he suffered. 

Scarcely did he find himself again at 
the Hall, ere, regardless of what might be 
thought of the circumstance, he fled from 
it, to visit the cottage. The day was 
closing in as he reached it, but there was 
no light from the windows to enliven the 
gloom â€” no sound, no sign of life within ; 
yet it was too early for the family to have 
retired to repose, and his heart misgave 
him at the first glance at the place. But 
when, attempting to open the gate, he 
found it locked, and on making his way 
over it, the little walk leading up to the 

VOL. I. D 



50 

cottage-door completely choked up with 
weeds, a terrible conviction of the truth 
flashed upon his mind ; still, however, he 
lingered, but no voice replied to his call, 
no sound met his ear, save the hollow 
wind, sweeping in hollow gusts through 
the shadowing woods ; and he at length 
retreated, to try whether he could obtain 
any satisfaction at any of the neighbour- 
ing cottages, about its late occupants. 

As he was making his way to the near- 
est in his recollection, he encountered an 
old woodman, muttering over to himself 
the earnings of the day, as with his dog 
he trudged homeward. Abruptly stopping 
him, Edwald addressed to him the inquiry 
he was so anxious to have answered. 

** Know what's become of un ?" repeat- 
ed the old man, doffing his hat over and 
over again ; " bless yer heart ! and be ye 
igrant yersel, zir? But that's true, you've 
been in foreign parts, they says, and it 
may be moin hard to get news there loike 
from this ; why, zir, the old lady be dead." 



51 

" Dead !" exclaimed Edwald, with a 
recoiling sensation. 

" Ay, ZLire, zir, she be dead, and buried 
too, zir, in that fearsome place, Yewly." 

"And the daughter?" 

" She be gone too, zir." 

" Gone !" repeated Edwald, starting, 
and grasping his arm â€” " you don't say 
she is dead too ?" 

" Noa, zir, noa ; she may be alive and 
merry, for aught I know to the contrary, 
but she vanished from this like a spirit, as 
my old dame says, without never letting 
nobody know nothing at all of the matter, 
not even master Parkson himself, from 
whom they had the cottage." 

" Extraordinary," said Edwald, " that 
no one should know whither she went." 

" Yes, zir, zo it be, and zo zome of the 
folks about here do say; but wherever she 
be, they do say they wish her well, for 
she was a koind soul, always ready to do 
a sarvice to a neighbour, if she could.â€” 
But be quiet. Ranger â€” I say be quiet,"

univer; 



52 

speaking to his dog, who was whining 
and jumping about him all the time. " I 
hope you'll 'cuse him, zir ; but the poor 
beastes have no manners loike; ya see, 
zir, he expects sumat when he gets home, 
and so that makes him impatient." 

" And Mrs. Glenmorlie is buried at 
Yewly ?" cried Edwald, scarcely knowing 
what he said. 

" Yes, zir, the poor soul be buried 
there," and at Ed w aid's desire he pro- 
ceeded to describe the exact spot. â€” *' Every 
one to their fancy, to be zure, as my old 
dame says," he continued ; " but to mine 
'tis a strange one, to be rather laid among 
nettles, and wild briars, and brambles, and 
troubled spirits, and what not of other 
rubbish, than in a clean, decent church- 
yard, like our village one, with such foine 
godly sayings on the gravestones to read. 
It would do any one good, I'm zure and 
certain, and make him prepare for his 
latter end, to read this on farmer Thatch- 
em's : â€” 



53 

* Here be I, that once was stout, 

And here thou'lt be, don't make no doubt ; 

For thof 1 cannot come to thee, 

'Tis certain zure thou'lt come to me. 

The longest life is but a blast, 

Zo make thee hay while zun do last." 

"Good-night!" said Edwald, putting 
some money in his hand ; " and if you 
can make out for me where the daughter 
is, you will oblige me." 

Yewly was indeed a fearful place to the 
neighbouring rustics, as old David said. 
Centuries had elapsed since its desertion 
and decay, and credulity had peopled it 
with all that was appalling to superstition. 
Founded as early as the heptarchy by a 
Saxon prince, from whom the family of lord 
Ambresbury boasted of their origin, a con- 
siderable part of it was now but a massive 
pile of ivy-mantled ruins ; yet still within 
its mouldering walls was the burying-place 
of the descendants of its founder. The 
narrow walks winding through the trees 
that filled up the extensive enclosure 
about it were so overgrown with grass, 
and choked up with briars and brambles, 



54 

that it was difficult to make the way- 
through them, or decipher the ancient 
records of mortality the place contained. 
Within the pile indeed some stately tombs 
were still discovered, but in so perishable 
d state, green with damp, and sinking to 
decay, as to prove how fallacious is the 
hope of those who expect to have their 
names perpetuated to posterity through 
such means. A massive arch, with a suc- 
cession of others falling behind it, gave 
admission to the place ; but tlie rich win- 
dow of gorgeous colouring, that had once 
emitted a purple glory through this grand 
perspective, was no more. Trees, sprung 
up from amongst the rubbish, spread them- 
selves with ivy amongst the shattered pil- 
lars, where, in place of the rich banner, 
the long dank grass now waved over the 
warrior's tomb. 

Shunned by all but the melancholy and 
musing, or the traveller curious in re- 
search, or fond of indulging in the emo- 
tions excited by grandeur in decay, the 
owl here sung unmolested her strains of 



55 

melancholy to the moonshine that slept 
upon its mouldering battlements, and the 
bat spread its leathern wings in security. 
A kind of sluggish repose seemed always 
to prevail around it ; no sound almost was 
ever heard here, but the pent-up wind, 
moaning through the long lone aisles, or 
sweeping the hanging woods with a hol- 
low murmur ; the lazy ass here enjoyed 
himself in luxurious indolence ; and if by 
chance a sudden storm drove a shepherd 
with his flock, or a woodman to it, they 
were not long ere they sought another 
shelter. 

Hither, now impelled by a resistless im- 
pulse, Edwald guided his steps. The si- 
lent tenant of the tomb could not satisfy 
the anxiety that tortured his heart, and 
yet he felt as if it w^ould be a relief to him 
to visit the grave of Mrs, Glenmorlie. He 
bent over it with strong emotion ; all that 
had occurred in their parting interview 
now recurred to his recollection, and the 
more he reflected on this, the more he 
wondered at what had followed, and for 



56 

the first time a vague suspicion of trea- 
chery crossed his mind. This at once de- 
cided him on having no farther conceal- 
ment relative to Constance â€” honour, faith, 
humanity, all demanded that he should 
now be explicit concerning her, nor rest 
till he had discovered what had become 
of her. He trembled when he thought 
of all she must have suffered â€” all she might 
then be undergoing ; yet should he, con- 
trary to his presageful fears, find her in 
health and safety, still what a damp upon 
the happiness of the moment would be 
the loss of her mother â€” that gentle being 
whom he had loved with the affection 
of a son, and to whom, he fondly hoped, 
it would have been given him to have 
made some reparation for the past! In 
vain he thought of that happier state of 
existence to which she was translated, 
where there is fullness of joy and plea- 
sure evermore ; grief the most acute per- 
vaded his bosom for her, and with diffi- 
culty he tore himself away from her grave. 
Yewly was a favourite haunt of hers and 



57 

Constance: on the very spot where she 
now rested, had they all often lingered 
together, to contemplate the sublime spec- 
tacle of the setting sun, and listen to the 
breeze sighing through the woods. 

The explanation that now ensued was 
what lord Ambresbury and his mother 
had expected, but they bore it with pa- 
tience, from knowing they had nothing 
further to fear from Constance. Unsuc- 
cessful in his diligent inquiries about her 
in the neighbourhood, he became nearly 
distracted, and unable to continue for 
any time in a place. In one of his de- 
sultory tours, he stopped for a few days 
at a little retired village in one of the 
northern counties ; strolling about the ro- 
mantic environs of the village, he found 
himself one evening in a secluded valley, 
through which flowed, with an impetuous 
but interrupted course, a rapid river. The 
stones that impeded its current occasioned 
those " plaintive hollow murmurings" 
which, as a descriptive tourist observes. 



58 

" are adapted to recall the gay wandering 
mind from secular pursuits to philosophi- 
cal contemplations, and bring to our re- 
collection that tumultuous joys and plea- 
sures form not the real happiness of the 
soul." 

Edwald wanted not any thing to give 
a pensive turn to his thoughts; but what- 
ever was in union with their melancholy 
was pleasing to him; and he continued to 
wander on, till roused from the reverie 
into which he had fallen by the soft ac- 
cents of a well-known voice, from an an- 
tique summer-house, looking down on 
the torrent below ; he sprung up the rocky 
bank, and in another moment had Con- 
stance in his arms; but how altered ! She 
shrieked at seeing him, and, with a look 
of terror, would have disengaged herself 
from his arms, but he held her fast. 

Through her husband, who was a rude 
unfeeling man, she had long before be- 
come acquainted with the treachery that 
had been practised to separate them, and 
her soul recoiled from the aorony of the 



5d 

explanation that must now take place; for 
she saw at once, by the manner of Ed- 
wald, that he was in ignorance of her mar- 
riage. â€” " And is this my reception ?" he 
cried, reproachfully, " after so long a sepa. 
ration?" as she struggled to disengage 
herself from him. 

" Leave me, for Heaven's â€” for mercy's 
sake !" cried the agitated Constance, for 
the servant to whom she had been speak- 
ing at the time that Edwald had heard 
her had quitted the building, and, in con- 
sequence, she was in terror of seeing her 
husband every moment enter. â€” " Leave 
me," she conjured him, "and all that you 
require to have explained â€” that you wish 
to hear, you shall learn." 

Edwald could not â€” would not obey her, 
which perceiving, and aware of all that 
was likely to result from finding him with 
lier, she suddenly burst from his grasp, 
and bolting the door communicating with 
the garden on the outside, compelled him 
thus to retreat by the way he had entered. 

She had previously learned where he 



60 

was in the village ; and he had not been 
long returned to the inn, whither he has- 
tened back for the purpose of addressing 
a reproachful letter to her, when he re- 
ceived the following from her, brought by 
an old confidential Irish servant, who had 
been for some time in the service of her 
mother. 



" Cruel must I call the chance 
which has again brought about a meeting 
between Edwald and me 1 He may ex- 
claim at the expression â€” he may wonder 
when he learns that Constance has prayed, 
even fervently prayed, that they might 
meet no more; but wonder will cease, 
though not indignation, perhaps, when he 
learns that she is no longer at liberty to 
receive those assurances that rendered for- 
mer meetings so delightful. He may â€” 
lie will perhaps call her faithless, perfidious, 
on learning this ; but, with the rest of her 
sorrows, she must bear with patience the 
loss of his esteem. 



61 

*' Yet should she endeavour to justify 
herself â€” but, alas ! it is useless now ! In 
this moment, when about bidding him a 
tinal adieu â€” in this moment of unutter- 
able anguish, she conjures him, by all that 
is feeling and generous in his nature, ne- 
ver more to seek another interview with 
her. 

" She has an infant child â€” should dis- 
grace attach to her, it must share in it, 
and grow up perhaps to reproach tlie me- 
mory of its wretched mother. 

" Yes â€” memory ; for she feels in this 
world her race is nearly run â€” in that 
which is to come she hopes to receive 
some recomj>ence for the sorrows that have 
subilued her in this. Then destroy not, 
oh, Edward ! that hope, by trying to make 
her forget her duty. This nuist for ever 
conclude iier correspondence with you â€” 
must be her eternal farewell. Farewell ! 
chilling expression ! she lingei*s over it â€” 
over her last adieu to one who wa^ so 
kind, so generous, so beloveil a friend. 

" Constance/* 



62 

We shall pass over what immediately 
followed the receipt of this letter â€” suffice 
it, that the explanation to which it led 
to from the faithful Esther made Edwald 
perfectly acquainted with the treachery to 
which he had been the dupe. For some 
minutes he stood suspended between his 
savage eagerness to rush upon his mother 
with reproaches, and his wish to implore 
forgiveness of Constance for the wrong he 
had involuntarily done her; but the latter 
prevailed. In vain however the inter- 
view he sought was implored. Constance 
could not be prevailed on to mock her 
Creator, by praying to him to guard her 
from temptation, whilst she rushed volun- 
tarily into it herself; and finding it use- 
less to torment her on the subject, he re- 
turned home. Here the scene that ensued 
occasioned an estrangement of some time 
between him and his parents : at length 
the interference of mutual friends brought 
about a kind of reconciliation between 
them, but confidence on his side was for 
ever destroyed in them. 



63 

At length he again returned privately 
to the neighbourhood of Constance ; he 
was within a little way of the village, when 
a funeral bell struck out, and presently 
after he saw the melancholy procession it 
announced approaching. He mechanical- 
ly drew up his horse to the side of the 
road to let it pass, and was vacantly re- 
garding the hearse, when the name of De 
Grey, Constance's husband, accidentally 
pronounced, roused him from his abstrac- 
tion, and eagerly inquiring, he learned 
that he was indeed the person they were 
bearing to the grave. 

But the dawn of hope was but tran- 
sient ; the person who gave him this in- 
formation, not satisfied with this, proceed- 
ed to inform him also of the malignant 
disorder of which he had died, and that 
his wife, in attending on him, had also 
caught it, and was then despaired of. 

Edwald heard no more; he spurred on 
his horse to the house so lately prohibited 
to him, and found that he had indeed ar- 



64 

rived but in time to receive the last sigh 
of Constance â€” it was breathed on his bo- 
som : restored to her reason a short time 
previous to her dissolution, she had heard 
his frantic exclamations in the hall, and 
desired he might be admitted to her. 

She noticed him the moment he entered 
â€” " Be calm, Edwald," she cried, as he 
sunk beside the bed, and sobbed aloud ; 
" regret not that my sorrowful pilgrimage 
here is at an end." She raised her head, 
but it sunk immediately again on his arm. 
â€” " Oh ! what happiness," she continued, 
" to breathe my last sigh on your bosom, 
and be at liberty to assure you with it, 
how dear ! how very dear " 

Her lips quivered â€” she gasped â€” she 
turned her dying eyes once more upon 
him, and closed them for ever. 

For hours after all was darkness and 
horror ; he then gave orders for her fune- 
ral, and actuated by something like fren- 
zy, mounted his horse, and stopped not 
again till he found himself at home. His 



65 

wild and disordered appearance alarmed 
his parents, but their anxious inquiries 
obtained no satisfaction from him. 

In the course of the evening, he con- 
trived to draw his mother from the house 
with him. The remains of Constance 
were brought to Yewly for interment, and 
all things being arranged according to his 
orders, he now led his mother thither. 
After sauntering about some time, he drew 
her on, by imperceptible degrees, towards 
it, through the conversation he forced 
himself to keep up with her, for the pur- 
pose of preventing her being aware of 
what he was about. 

The shadows of night were gathering 
about it by the time they reached it, and 
nothing could be more dreary, more deso- 
late, than the aspect of the massive ruins, 
stretching into the funereal darkness of old 
yews and cypresses, while a moaning wind 
swayed the long grass of the tombs, and 
swept with a hollow murmur through the 
woods. 

" No, no ! I cannot go on indeed, my 



66 

dear Edwald !" said his mother, stopping 
short on perceiving whither he had led 
her â€” "I have an absokite horror of that 
place, with its glooms, and its graves, and 
its inscriptions." 

" And yet youth and beauty can rest 
here without shuddering," said Edwald, 
retaining his firm hold of her, and, despite 
of her resistance, forcing her onward. 

Within the very interior of the pile was 
a chapel, still kept up in good preserva- 
tion, and here the remains of Constance 
were laid out, with funeral candles lighted 
about the coffin. Lady Dunamore started 
at the sight â€” " Good God !" she exclaimed, 
'' what is all this ?" 

The folding-doors of wrought iron un- 
closed at the touch of Edwald â€” the pall 
was thrown back â€” " And there," he cried, 
pointing to the plate upon the coffin, " that 
will satisfy you." 

She read, shrieked, and started back, 
and â€” "My God! my God! when and 
where did this happen ?" were her excla- 
mations. 



67 

" Idle questions!" replied Edwald, with 
all the fierceness of despair; " suffice it, 
there lies your victimâ€” the victim of cruel 
ambition and treachery â€” all that remains 
of worth, of beauty, and excellence, that 
would have graced any station. But 
hear me vow â€” hear me swear, by that 
Heaven which has so soon recalled her to 
itself, never to know another choice !" 

Lady Dunamore shrieked â€” " Edwald ! 
Edwald," she cried, " if you do not wish 
to drive me to distraction, recall that 
vow !" 

But vain were her supplications, and a 
kind of gloomy pleasure pervaded his soul 
at the idea of the revenge it had given 
him the power of inflicting. 

The shock imparted to lady Dunamore 
by what had happened occasioned a spee- 
dy change in her disposition and manner ; 
feelings never before experienced were 
awakened ; but the amendment of her 
heart took place too late for her happiness 
â€” her son was entirely lost to her. The 
deserted abode of Mrs. Glenmorlie became 



68 

his residence, and the faithful Esther, with 
the infant of Constance, its inmates with 
him ; nor could any entreaties induce him 
to enter society again, nor cancel the vow 
he had taken. 

At length lord Ambresbury, naturally 
of a stern and unfeeling nature, became 
so exasperated by his conduct as to desist 
from seeing him. His mother, however, 
all repentance for the past, continued to 
keep up an intercourse with him ; but the 
only one of the family he had any plea- 
sure in seeing was his sister Clara. The 
health of lady Dunamore at last yielded 
to the anxiety of her mind, and in less 
than a year after the death of Constance, 
she followed her to the tomb. 

Shortly after, the brother of Constance, 
mournfully affected by these disastrous 
events, came, at the earnest request of 
Edwald, to pay a visit at the cottage ; he 
was a very fine young man, and the inno- 
cent heart of Clara soon began to feel a 
prepossession in his favour. 

Lord Ambresbury had hitherto trou- 



69 

bled himself very little about her visits at 
the cottage; but he no sooner heard of 
the arrival of the young soldier than he 
thought it time to interdict them, though 
had he known all, he would have known 
there was nothing to apprehend on that 
account, Glenmorlie being under an en- 
gagement to the daughter of his patron. 
However, he knew nothing of this, and 
even if he had, he would have pretended 
ignorance, in order to have had an opportu- 
nity of offering an insult where he hated. 

Accordingly, as the little party were 
sitting together one evening, he rushed in 
upon them, with looks expressive of the 
infuriate passions of his soul; and after 
loading them all with reproaches, and ac- 
cusing Glenmorlie of having formed the 
same plan for ensnaring the sister that 
had been formed for ensnaring the brother, 
proceeded to drag his almost-fainting 
daughter away. 

Consideration for Edwald alone restrain- 
ed Glenmorlie from resenting this accusa- 
tion in the manner it merited ; but after 



70 

such a one, he could not possibly think 
of remaining longer with him ; and thus, 
through the cruel conduct of his father, 
was he deprived of a friend that was be- 
ginning to acquire some influence over 
him, and might gradually have succeeded 
in winning him back to the society he had 
renounced. 

But to have him restored to this was 
not now the wish of lord Ambresbury. 
He had made proposals for a young lady 
in the neighbourhood, but to accepting 
which his family was an obstacle â€” mothers 
and daughters-in-law seldom agreed toge- 
ther ; and then his son cut off the hopes 
of any she might have; and in malignant 
rage at the idea of his being a bar to his 
happiness, he felt infinitely more inclined to 
thwart and prevent any thing that could 
be done for his benefit than promote it. 

Through his means, from whom no- 
thing now was to be expected â€” no gratifi- 
cation to either paternal pride or ambi- 
tion, to be doomed himself to disappoint- 
ment, was intolerable ; and after brooding 



71 

for some time over the thought, he de- 
cided on at least rendering him as wretch- 
ed as possible, in consequence, by treating 
him as a maniac, not without a horrible 
hope of the treatment he would be sub- 
jected to effecting what he wished ; while 
at the same time he also decided on get- 
ting rid of his daughter, by forcing her to 
accept a proposal that about this period 
had been made for her. 

There was no one to interfere about 
Edwald, or disprove his assertions about 
him â€” assertions which the life Edwald 
had latterly led had given but too much 
colour to ; and he was remorselessly torn 
from the cottage, and hurried to a place 
of severe confinement ; while his terrified 
sister was assured, that if she hesitated to 
accept the offer that was made her, she 
should be treated with the greatest severity. 

Of this, from what had occurred to her 
unfortunate brother, she made no doubt ; 
but her very soul recoiled from the idea 
of obeying the unfeeling mandate of her 
imperious father; she not only abhorred 



72 

the person, but character of the person, 
who had proposed for her; and finally de- 
cided on flying from the tyranny she 
could not otherwise resist. An old friend 
of her mother's lived in London, and with 
her she determined to take refuge, till ei- 
ther she was of age, or some measures 
could be had recourse to, to induce her 
cruel father to give up his determination 
of forcing her inclinations. 

No suspicion being entertained of her 
intention, she found no difficulty in car- 
rying it into effect. Disguising herself as 
well as she could, she stole from the house 
one night, with a small parcel, containing 
a few valuables, after it was thought she 
had retired to her chamber, and repaired 
to a place in the park by which she knew 
a stage passed to London. But with what 
sensations of mingled grief, and terror, 
and regret, did she quit her home ! and 
how did her fainting soul seem to die 
within her, when, in passing through a 
gallery to the door by which she was to 
effect her escape, a full-orbed moon, dart- 



7$ 

ing through the windows, and giving to 
her view the picture of her mother, re- 
called those happy days, when, enjoying 
maternal love and protection, she seemed 
to have nothing to fear! 

The herald of the morning was just be- 
ginning to salute her ear with its melodi- 
ous notes, when the expected coach ap- 
peared in view, and took her up. She was 
a little startled at finding three passengers 
within ; but she soon found, or rather ima- 
gined, she had nothing to apprehend from 
them ; for though two of them quickly 
resumed the slumbers which the opening 
of the door, and the letting-in of the cold 
air of morning on them had disturbed, the 
other continued to observe her. He was 
a young Scotchman, and was convinced, 
at his first glance of her, there was some- 
thing wrong. In this suspicion he was 
confirmed on hearing her speak; her ac- 
cents were not those of a person in the in- 
ferior situation which her travelling with- 
out protection might have warranted one 

VOL. I. E 



74 

to believe, and his curiosity was strongly 
excited ; while aware of the dangers to 
which her youth and appearance exposed 
her, he determined not to lose sight of 
her till he had seen what became of her. 



CHAPTER V. 

" Her steps were lonely, and her soul was sad, for Connel. 
Was he not young and lovely, like the beam of the set- 
ting sun ?'* 

In pursuance of this determination, he 
assisted in conducting her to a room, on 
their alighting at the inn in London, and 
where the scene of noise, confusion, and 
danger, which, on driving under the gate- 
way, was exhibited to the view of Clara, 
nearly deprived her of her senses â€” with 
coaches coming in and out â€” waggons load- 
ing and unloading â€” passengers clamorous 
about their luggage â€” porters running in 
all directions â€” and ostlers forcing their 



75 

way with their horses through all impedi- 
ments. 

A little recovered from her panic, Dun- 
don aid proceeded to ask her whether he 
could be of any further service to her? 
She hesitated, and then falteringly men- 
tioned the place she had to go to. Dun- 
donald proposed her sending for her friend; 
and trembling with terror at the idea of 
proceeding to her by herself, from the im- 
pression made upon her nerves by her en- 
trance into London, Clara acceded to the 
proposition, and a note was accordingly 
dispatched to her friend ; Dundonald, to 
her great comfort, continuing with her; 
for from the attention he had paid her 
throughout her journey, she could not 
help regarding him something in the light 
of an acquaintance, and she was endea- 
vouring to enter into something like con- 
versation with him, when she suddenly 
missed her little parcel. Dundonald im- 
mediately proceeded to inquire for it, but 
in vain, and the consternation of Clara at 
E 2 



76 

its loss would have been inexpressible, but 
for the friend she made sure of having to 
receive her : what then were her feelings 
may easier be conceived than described, 
when the porter returned to say her friend 
was dead ! The curdling blood ran cold to 
her heart, at the horrible predicament in 
which she found herself, and for a few mi- 
nutes Dundonald thought life must have 
forsaken her frame. 

When, at length, by the gentlest sooth- 
ings, he brought her a little to herself, he 
conjured her to say how he could serve her. 
â€” "Serve me!" repeated the distracted 
Clara â€” " you cannot serve me !" and her 
brain grew dizzy; and unable longer to 
support herself, she allowed the woman 
of the house to be rung for her ; and Dun- 
donald, committing her to her care, im- 
mediately took his departure for Rich- 
mond. 

A widow lady, of the name of Duncan, 
resided there, from whose benevolence he 
made sure of obtaining for the youthful 
stranger that protection she so peculiarly 



7T 

required. He was not too sanguine in his 
expectations ; naturally compassionate, the 
sympathy of Mrs. Duncan for the unfor- 
tunate was heightened by a bitter know- 
ledge of what sorrow was in her own per- 
son. The moment she heard the affecting 
detail of Dundonald, she was ready to 
take wing with him â€” " For we canna be 
ganging too soon," she cried, " lest any 
harm should happen to the winsome little 
soul where ye left her ; and, ah ! ye're a 
bonny ehiel, Charley lad !" she continued. 
" I wish all I had a wee regard for were 
so sure of a gude birth above â€” always 
ready to stand forth the champion of the 
widow and the orphan. See what would 
have become of the bonny bairn, gif an 
she had come across any of those prowling 
wolves that are ganging aboot with the 
deil in their hearts, seeking whom they 
may devour !" 

The praise she bestowed on Dundonald 
was not unmerited â€” never was there a 
more feeling heart â€” never a more noble 
nature : fortune alone prevented his being 



78 

a universal benefactor to mankind; but 
he was only a cadet, compelled, though of 
a most respectable family, to make exer- 
tions for support; confined, however, as 
were his means, he still had had the power 
of conferring obligations on Mrs. Duncan 
that never were forgotten, and made her 
regard him in the light of a son. 

They found Clara in the delirium of a 
fever; but an inn was no place to nurse 
her in ; she was accordingly muffled up, 
and conveyed to Richmond, where prob- 
ably she never would have recovered, but 
for the truly- maternal care that w^as taken 
of her, and where, as probably, she would 
have relapsed on regaining her senses, but 
for the kind assurances of Mrs. Duncan, 
of retaining her with her. 

Convinced, from the honour and huma- 
nity she had experienced, she might safe- 
ly place confidence where she was, she 
was no sooner sufficiently recovered to en- 
ter into an explanation concerning herself, 
than she frankly revealed her story. JNIrs. 
Duncan had anticipated something of the 



7^ 

kind, but not by any means that she was 
of the rank she was, and felt a Httle un- 
easy at learning it, from the inconveni- 
ence she was aware she might subject her- 
self to, from assisting to secrete a person 
of her description from her family ; she 
had given her promise to that effect, how- 
ever ; and after what she heard of the cruel 
tyranny of lord Ambresbury, she could 
not think of breaking it ; and if she had, 
Dundonald would have interfered, and his 
interference was nevrsr vain with her. 

The consequences of the growing in- 
timacy between him and Clara may be an- 
ticipated. To the disposition already de- 
scribed â€” a disposition that imparted a re- 
sistless softness to his tones and manner, 
he united all the advantages of a fine per- 
son, and a cultivated and accomplished 
mind ; and gradually gaining upon the 
esteem and admiration of Clara, he stole 
one image from her mind to substitute 
another in it. 

Viewing with him the enchanting beau- 
ties of the place where they were â€” enjoy- 



80 

ing with him the delicious sweetness of 
the evening air, when the nightingale 
tunes sweetest her love-laboured song, 
how often was Clara lulled into a forget- 
fulness of the past, till recalled by some 
casual circumstance, yet perhaps without 
her being able to say by what connecting 
association with it â€” so hidden are the links 
by which the past and present are con- 
nected in our minds! But how beautifully 
do these lines illustrate this ! 

*' But ever and anon, of griefs subdued, 

There comes a token, like a scorpion's sting, 
Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued; 

And slight withal may be the things which bring 
Back on the heart the weight which it would fling 

Aside for ever; it may be a sound â€” 
A tone of music â€” summer's eve- â€” or spring â€” 

A flower â€” the wind â€” the ocean â€” which shall wound, 
Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound." 

Mrs. Duncan knew not what to say to 
their growing attachment ; she knew Dun- 
donald had no independence for a family, 
and considered lord Ambresbury's ever 
taking his daughter again into favour very 
uncertain ; but at length her wish to see 



81 

him happy got the better of her prudence, 
and she began pleading for him with Clara, 
and with whose own heart seconding her 
arguments for him, she shortly succeeded. 

A journey to Scotland ensued ; and im- 
mediately after their return from being 
married, Clara addressed a letter to her 
father, explanatory of all that had hap- 
pened since her leaving the paternal roof 
To this a bitter answer was returned â€” 
Since she had chosen, he said, to forget so 
long that she had a father, it was his de- 
termination now not to remember the cir- 
cumstance, but in new connexions to en- 
deavour to find consolation for the ingra- 
titude and folly of two degenerate chil- 
dren. 

Little as Clara expected from her un- 
feeling parent, still she had not altogether 
expected such an answer as this â€” " If not 
from principle, at least from pride," she 
thought, " some little provision would be 
made for her ;" and the disappointment of 
this expectation was a most severe one. 
E 3 



That the daughter of such a house should 
not, by settlement, have a fortune secured 
to her, may appear strange; but through 
the anxiety of her grandfather, sir George 
Glenmorlie, to have her parents married, 
lest of any disappointment of this favour- 
ite wish from her grandmother, no delay 
was allowed for making the settlements 
usual on such occasions, and which after- 
wards were put off from time to time, till 
they at length ceased to be thought of 

Dundonald, however, affected to think 
lightly of what had so affected her, and 
in reality did so, for he was young and 
sanguine in his temper, and just then so 
happy, from the secured possession of her 
he loved, that all must go on well, he 
thought ; and Mrs. Duncan reminded 
them that they were her children, and that 
whatever she had would be theirs; and 
Dundonald, whose situation was in a mer- 
cantile house in London, giving up his 
lodgings there, they became permanently 
fixed with her. 

And never was there a happier little 



8S 

domestic circle ; home was here what it 
should always be â€” the resort of peace, and 
love, and joy. Every thing to each other, 
they were only anxious the present bliss 
might continue : but, alas ! life is but one 
great scene of eternal change ! how few, 
for any length of time, can keep their frail 
bark moored in the haven of tranquillity, 
or bask in the sunshine, without feeling a 
cloud intercepting the genial warmth! 
Clara had just recovered from giving birth 
to a lovely boy, when their more than 
mother was taken from them ; and so sud- 
den was her death, that the will she had 
always intended to make in their favour 
was not made ; so that whatever she died 
possessed of went to a distant relative, 
who having long regarded them with en- 
vy and ill-will, had no hesitation in mak- 
ing them quit the house immediately, 
where so many â€” many happy hours â€” so 
many blissful days, had been passed. 

But this was but the beginning of sor- 
rows â€” Mrs. Duncan was scarcely laid with- 
in her grave, when Dundonald, through 



84 

the malice of* some envious interloper, was 
infoi-med he was no longer required in the 
house where he had so long been. He 
tried, however, to support himself under 
the shock imparted by the intimation, by 
a hope of soon obtaining another situation; 
but this hope proved fallacious â€” day after 
day he returned from town, still disap- 
pointed, feeling, even to an excruciating 
degree, that hope deferred maketh the 
heart sick. Their finances declined; his 
health became impaired, his temper alter- 
ed ; and Clara, from being the most blessed 
of wives, became the most wretched. Dis- 
tress by himself Dundonald could have 
endured ; but distress in which a wife and 
child were to share, he had not fortitude 
to support: yet sometimes, out of com- 
passion to the miserable Clara, he would 
force a sickly smile upon his countenance, 
and essay to be what he once was; but 
when their languid steps involuntarily 
guided them to that loved â€” that regretted 
home, now closed for ever against them, 
where so much happiness had been expe- 



85 

rienced, the sickening sensations of his 
soul, at the torturing contrast between 
the past and present, would send him back 
with redoubled gloom. 

At length he became so ill as to be un- 
able to quit his bed, and without some 
relief for his distracted mind, Clara saw 
no hope of his recovering. Under what 
she now endured, her sinking frame could 
hardly support her : she was literally 
alone, forsaken, faint, without a friendly 
bosom to lean on for assistance, or friendly 
voice to speak consolation to her ; but to 
suffer herself to sink beneath her sorrows, 
and he who was dearer to her bleeding 
heart than ever must perish with her. 

A hundred times she took up a pen to 
address her father, to conjure him, if he 
would not relieve her as a child, yet to 
do so as a suffering fellow-creature ; but 
as often she threw it aside, in utter de- 
spair of succeeding with him. He had, 
long before this, obtained the person for 
whom he had literally sacrificed his chil- 
dren; and just about this period, Clara 



86 

suddenly heard of her elopement from 
him. 

She had scarcely heard it when it struck 
her, that perhaps what he suffered from 
this event might have had a softening ef- 
fect upon him, and induce him to have 
pity on her, if he but saw her â€” saw her, 
as she was, wasted, worn down with sor- 
row and fatigue. Yet how could she 
leave her husband to present herself to his 
view ? how commit him, in whom her 
very life seemed centered, to the care of 
others, when her own tenderest care was 
insufficient for him ? Yet the journey to 
the Hall was not a long one ; and so much 
might be achieved by undertaking it, that 
the pang of a temporary separation was 
worth enduring for his sake ; and finally 
she mentioned it to Dundonald. 

After a slight hesitation, he strenuously 
recommended her making the effort, and 
she accordingly began to make prepara- 
tions for her journey ; yet a thousand 
times, in doing so, her resolution nearly 
faltered, and but for the desperation of 



87 

her situation, she would have abandoned 
her design altogether, from a dread of dis- 
appointment. But at last the moment of 
heart-riving anguish came for taking leave 
of her beloved : a hundred times she 
gave him what she meant to be her part- 
ing kiss, but as often she returned to re- 
peat it â€” to look at him again â€” to press 
his emaciated hands to her anguished bo- 
som, and call upon the God of Mercies, 
with quivering lips, to spare him, to re- 
store him to her, to bless him with all the 
blessings that his virtues, his faithful love, 
and tenderness, deserved. 

At last she was forced to tear herself 
away, but at the door she turned to take 
another look : it would have been well 
for her if she had not ; for, oh ! never, 
never, from that moment, from her tor- 
tured imagination was effaced the last 
ashy look of fainting tenderness she then 
caught ! It was the first she saw of a 
morning â€” the last she beheld at night ; it 
was for ever present to her, sleeping or 



B8 

awake, wringing, even at times upbraid- 
ing, her widowed heart. 

She was taken up at Brentford, and 
about night-fall dropt at a little inn con- 
tiguous to the Hall, and within the deep 
shadow of the immense woods that here, 
in all the pomp of foliage and luxuriance 
of maturity, waved their gigantic arms 
athwart the rugged and vegetative banks, 
and in receding masses extended their 
gloomy shades to an interminable dis- 
tance, shedding a brown horror over many 
a darksome dell and lonely byepath. 

The view of these magnificent woods, 
so calculated to inspire awe and admira- 
tion, served but to heighten the anguish 
of the desolate Clara, from the recollections 
they revived. Merely pausing to assure 
herself her father was at the Hall, she set 
out for it, unrecognised by any one, owing 
to her close disguise and altered appear- 
ance. 

On seeing her making towards the 
woods, the woman of the house, who. 



89 

from thinking there was something odd 
in her manner, had been watching her, 
followed to remonstrate with her on the 
imprudence of venturing into their tan- 
gled paths at such an hour, when day was 
not only rapidly closing in, but there was 
every reason to believe a storm was com- 
ing on ; but she was not to be dissuaded, 
and accordingly soon found herself within 
the deep gloom of her native shades, whose 
murmurs, bringing back the memory of 
the past, robbed her almost of the power 
of proceeding. 

She had not left the inn many minutes 
ere the storm that was apprehended came 
on with tremendous fury, exciting such 
alarm for her safety, as, with scarce a mo- 
ment's intermission, one percussive peal 
followed another, as to induce the people 
of it to brave its violence in quest of her ; 
but in vain they sought her, not knowing 
the direction in which she meant to go, 
till at length they gave up the fruitless 
search, but not without the most fearful 
misgivings about her. 



90 

In the meanwhile, the object of their 
humane solicitude, with difficulty, pursued 
her way, now awed by the flashing light- 
ning and astounding peal, of which it was 
the dread precursor â€” now opposed by the 
wild waving of the trees, that, with all 
their branches depressed, now seemed as 
if shrinking from the tempest, now toss- 
ing them again on high, as if braving it. 

Fearful of intruding abruptly on her 
father, she had decided, upon considera- 
tion, on first announcing herself to Orton, 
the steward, a person who stood high in 
his confidence, and on whose ready inter- 
ference for her she thought she might 
safely depend. 

Just as she reached the building, she 
saw a man issuing from it, and inquir- 
ing of him for the steward, was directed 
to a door in one of the turrets leading 
directly to his apartments. To this well- 
known door she accordingly proceeded, 
and pushing it open, tapped at an adjoin- 
ing door, and was desired to come in. 
She obeyed; and found Orton seated by 



a fire well calculated to render him re^ 
gardless of the tempest that raged with- 
out, and busied in looking over some pa- 
pers that lay scattered on a table. 

The immediate uplifting of her veil 
rendered it unnecessary for her to an- 
nounce herself: but his immediate recog- 
nition of her was by no means attended 
with pleasure to Orton ; on the contrary, 
there was no one whom he would not 
rather have seen there than her, for her 
confidence in him was utterly misplaced. 
Artful, selfish, and designing, he was in- 
capable of being actuated by any thing 
but his own interest ; and to this he con- 
ceived the reconciliation of lord Ambres- 
bury with his daughter would be very in- 
jurious. What had been might be; and 
from the moment of lady Ambresbury's 
elopement, he had meditated throwing a 
handsome niece of his own in his lordship's 
way. As yet he had had no opportunity 
for this, owing to the state of mind into 
which her conduct had thrown him, and 



92 

the reflections it had forced upon him ; but 
he did not despair of yet obtaining it. 

Indulging this hope, rioting in the idea 
of yet bearing rule in the lordly mansion 
of Rookby, he could ill bear the idea of 
being disappointed in his anticipations. 
But a short time before, and he would not 
have feared this through the means of 
Clara, but latterly he thought he had 
perceived something like relenting in lord 
Ambresbury's mind towards her. He 
had begun to speak of her, to talk of a 
journey to Richmond ; and, in short, Orton 
determined, if in his power to prevent it, 
they should not meet. 

As soon as the shock her unexpected 
appearance gave him was a little recovered 
from, he proceeded to make inquiries, 
which convincing him he had nothing to 
fear from any artifice he practised, he had 
no hesitation in telling her that he deemed 
it fortunate she had not appeared abruptly 
before her father, he was still so exaspe- 
rated against her ; but that, if she permit- 



93 

ted his interference, and in the interim, 
till the result of it was known, allowed 
him to secrete her in the house, she might 
rely on his best exertions to serve her. 

Clara, though with a heart sinking 
within her at the cruel hint he threw out 
concerning her father, acquiesced in the 
propostion ; and Orton, all alarm, quickly 
led her to the place he had in view for 
her concealment. 

Rookby Hall was a very ancient edi- 
fice ; one of the secret outlets belonging 
to it, such as in former times few build- 
ings of the kind were without, was a rude 
cave, which, in after days, was converted 
into a hermitage by one of the owners of 
the place ; but, though much altered 
since then, it still wore the appearance of 
one, and was kept in good preservation, 
as a memento of former times ; the apart- 
ments into which it was divided consisted 
of a chapel, a cell for repose, and another 
for refection, and were all so artfully con- 
structed, that their communication with 
each other was difficult to be ascertained. 



94 

The stony ascent to it without, narrowed 
by thickets of briars and blackthorn, had 
more the appearance of being a channel 
for a little rill that trickled along it than 
any regularly-formed path ; a romantic 
dell opened beyond, where a chiding 
stream played in wild eddies amongst the 
sinewy roots of the old trees, and the frag- 
ments of rock with which it was strewed, 
and where, as the ivy-clad cliffs, richly 
coloured with a variety of other dark and 
creeping substances, alternately receded 
and advanced, all those contrasted beau- 
ties of light and shade â€” those tender sha- 
dows that give such pleasure to the eye 
and exercise to the imagination, were pro- 
duced. Hither having conducted Clara, 
he left her to meditate what farther he 
should do to prevent v\^hat he dreaded, 

A night of horror v/as the conseqnence 
of being left by herself At lengtii, 
unable to endure a longer continuance of 
the suspense she was writhing under, she 
suddenly started up, with a determina- 
tion of ascertaining her fate at once â€” that, 



95 

if destined to disappointment, she might 
at least expire by her husband ; for expir- 
ing she felt herself But Orton had taken 
care she should not quit it, and Vvith wild 
shrieks she called upon him to liberate 
her : yet was she not impatient in giving 
way to these agonies ? she suddenly re- 
flected. Orton had promised â€” solemnly 
promised, to see her father that night, and 
let her know the result immediately ; and 
he would not â€” he could not, break his 
promise ; he could not trifle â€” he could not 
dally with the feelings of a person situ- 
ated as she was. Yet still he came not, 
and despair and distraction seized her 
soul at the minutes that were thus wasted 
from her dying husband, and she wished 
(oh, how fervently !), as in frantic agony 
she dashed herself upon the ground, that 
she had not undertaken this unfortunate 
journey. 

From something like a stupor she was 
suddenly raised, and looking up, she be- 
held Orton bending over her. â€” " What ! 



96 

still awake ?" he cried, as, on seeing him, 
she started up. 

" Providentially, perhaps," said Clara, 
her eye at the moment glancing on some- 
thing like an unclasped knife in his hand, 
and, as she spoke, attempting to pass him 
to the door ; but eagerly pursuing her, he 
brutally pushed her back, and again 
locked it on her. 

Lord Ambresbury had been abroad that 
day : returning at night, his horses got so 
frightened by the storm, that he deemed 
it advisable to quit the carriage, and pur- 
sue the remainder of the way on foot. 
The nearest entrance to the house was by 
the one leading to the apartments of Or- 
ton; and admitting himself by it, he turn- 
ed into the adjoining room, and found him 
standing there, with clenched hands and 
strong indications of agitation on his looks. 
On the door opening, he was advancing, 
with a savage aspect, to thrust out the 
intruder, when he beheld his lordship. 

After regarding him for a minute with 



97 

surprise â€” " Why, what is the matter, 
man ?" demanded his lordship ; " you look 
absolutely terrified." 

In extreme confusion, Orton said, or 
rather stammered out something about 
the storm ; and then, in order to try and 
divert his lordship's attention from him, 
proposed lighting him to his own apart- 
ment. 

" No ; I will first warm myself at your 
fire," said lord Ambresbury, advancing to 
it as he spoke. 

Enraged at his not permitting what he 
wished, Orton followed, and, under the 
pretext of making it better, thrust the 
poker into the grate with a violence that 
forced the principal part of the contents 
out upon the hearth. 

" Very civil, upon my word !" said his 
lordship, as he started back. " Well, 
since you have acted in this manner, be 
so good as to take the trouble of lighting 
me hence." 

With great celerity Orton proceeded to 

VOL. I. F 



98 

obey him, and they were quitting the 
room when lord Ambresbury, treading 
upon something, stopt to see what it was, 
and took up the miniature of an infant 
boy, that, on examining, suddenly struck 
him as bearing a resemblance to his much- 
injured daughter, brought thus suddenly 
to his mind. â€” " Whose," in extreme emo- 
tion, he demanded, " is this, or how did 
it come into your possession ?" 

Orton started and stammered, and, with 
an execration against himself, for his care- 
lessness in dropping it â€” for Clara had got 
it done at Richmond, for the express pur- 
pose of bringing it with her, and in hopes 
it might aid his eloquence, had given it 
to him â€” proceeded then to say, it was the 
picture of a little nephew, his mother, in 
the vanity of her heart, had sent to him. 

Lord Ambresbury could not discredit 
this assertion, yet, notwithstanding, had 
he yielded to his feelings, he would have 
kept the picture, for its cherub smile had 
touched his heart ; but he was not a man 
to like to have it thought he was capable 



99 

of any weakness. Yet he had not for- 
given Clara, but he was beginning to feel 
that desolation attendant on standing 
alone in life, and, on that account, to wish 
to recall her. 

He retired to repose, but the emotion 
excited by the incident of the picture was 
inimical to it, as well as the continued 
violence of the storm, and rising, he slipt 
on his nightgown, and repaired to the 
study. This ancient apartment had much 
the appearance of a Gothic hall : its roof 
was composed of lofty arches, resting on 
oak pillars, richly carved. At its extre- 
mity was a low gallery, surmounted by 
an immense window of painted glass, in a 
deep recess at one side of which was a 
secret door, opening on a winding stair- 
case leading to the hermitage. 

On gaining this apartment, lord Am- 
bresbury tried to compose his mind by 
reading. While thus engaged, he heard 
a noise in the gallery ; and turning his 
head, to his extreme surprise, beheld the 
F 2 



100 

steward emerging from the secret cavity 
in the recess of the window. 

He was hastily stepping forward when 
he caught a ghmpse of lord Ambresbury, 
and immediately started back, as if in- 
tending to retreat ; but the voice of his 
lordship recalled him, and he slowly de- 
scended from the gallery. â€” " Where have 
you been ?" was the interrogation of lord 
Ambresbury as he approached him. 

Regarding him w^ith a truly ghost-hke 
aspect â€” " I fancied â€” I imagined," he 
stammered out, " that the door of the 
hermitage might have been left open ; and 
so to ascertain, I w^ent there." 

" An odd fancy, I think," said lord 
Ambresbury ; " and supposing it had, 
there was no great chance of any one be- 
ing in the way to-night to take advantage 
of the circumstance, I think." 

" Why, perhaps not, my lord ; but," as 
if scarcely conscious of what he was say- 
ing, " but the storm of this night is really 
enough to wake the dead." 

" Pooh, pooh !" cried his lordship, " this 



101 

is not the first storm you have heard in 
your life ; so retire to your pillow ; but," 
stooping as he spoke, and taking up a 
knife, which unconsciously Orton had let 
fall from his shaking hand, " what have 
you been doing with this?" 

" With that !" and he became of a still 
more ashy hue â€” " oh ! I thought if any of 
the bolts were dislodged, they might want 
forcing back, perhaps ; and so I took that 
with me on that account." 

Lord Ambresbury thouglit it was odd 
his acting in this manner, and that he 
seemed strangely perturbed ; however, he 
knew of no grounds for suspicion, and re- 
suming his book, the steward retired from 
the apartment. 

The stormy night was succeeded by a 
lovely morning, and lord Ambresbury 
was slowly riding through the park, when 
he perceived a group of country people 
earnestly conversing. Stopping to inquire 
what was the matter, he heard of tlie 
strange disappearance of the stranger from 
the inn the preceding night, and that 



102 

they had been collected for the purpose 
of searching for her. He listened atten- 
tively â€” ^involuntarily, as he did so, recalled 
the extraordinary conduct of Orton to his 
recollection, became disturbed, and hastily 
turning back, summoned him to his pre- 
sence the moment he alighted, and with- 
out ceremony at once taxed him with 
knowing something of the female whose 
disappearance had excited so much alarm 
in the neighbourhood. â€” " No evasion â€” no 
subterfuge," he peremptorily exclaimed, 
on seeing him tremble and change colour ; 
" I have heard enough to make me decide 
on ascertaining the truth." 

" Well then, my lord," said Orton, 
finding evasion useless, " since you must 
have the truth, your daughter has been 
here." 

" My daughter ! and why," indignantly, 
" is it that to chance I am indebted for a 
knowledge of the circumstance ?" 

Orton sneered malevolently. Humili- 
ation would not avail, he saw, and there- 
fore he determined to give utterance to 



103 

the malice inspired by disappointment 
â€” " The time is not very remote," he said, 
" when it would have been unfortunate 
for any one to have let you know it by 
any other means." 

" Villain !" half- articulated lord Am- 
bresbury, " you are now beginning to dis- 
close yourself" Then, seized with sud- 
den alarm about his daughter, he demand- 
ed where she was. 

" Safe," Orton coolly repHed. 

But we shall not dwell longer on the 
scene between them. Suffice it, that, in 
revealing where she was, Orton pretended 
that his conducting her there was merely 
for the purpose of keeping her visit a secret, 
till he had considered of the best mode of 
announcing it. Whether lord Ambres- 
bury believed this was his motive for do- 
ing so, or whether Orton really meditated 
any serious deed of atrocity, it matters not 
to say. 

Clara was found in a state of insensi- 
bility. Two days elapsed ere she was 
brought to herself; but when she was, and 



104 

found what a delay had occurred, and 
thought of the effect which agitation and 
suspense might have upon her husband, 
her brain got dizzy again, and she nearly 
relapsed into the state from which she 
was just recovered ; nor could the assu- 
rance of her restoration to her father's fa- 
vour speak peace or ease to her distracted 
soul. 

At length, through the very energy of 
despair, she raised herself, and accompa- 
nied by her father, set off for Richmond. 
On stopping at the house where she lodg- 
ed, there was no one to receive them ; but 
the hall door lay open, and springing 
from the carriage, she flew up to the 
chamber of her husband. She softly laid 
her hand upon the lock, but it resisted 
her effort ; the key was taken out, and 
her misgiving soul dying within her, she 
dropt lifeless on the spot. When she re- 
covered, she found herself reclined on a 
sofa in the sitting-room, with her father, 
tVie w^oman of the house, and some other 
person standing by her. The moment 



105 

she raised her eyes to theirs, she read, in 
their looks, a confirmation of what she 
suspected ; and bursting from them, she 
again flew to the chamber of her beloved. 
She would not be torn from it â€” she would 
not be hindered from seeing him again â€” 
from again gazing on him â€” from again 
clasping him in her fond embrace ; but, 
oh ! the agony of gazing on those marble 
features â€” of folding him to her heart, 
without feeling one returning throb in his 
â€” of calling upon him without being re- 
plied to â€” of thinking that in this perhaps 
long lingering life, she should never more 
hold communion with him â€” he who was 
all and every thing to her â€” friend, father, 
husband, in one ; that another had receiv- 
ed his last sigh â€” the last glance of his 
closing eyes â€” the last faint pressure of his 
feeble hand ! 

She was taken back to Rookby, but 
weeks elapsed ere she was conscious of any 
thing but the irreparable loss she had sus- 
tained ; but, though in time her grief 
f3 



106 

seemed to obtain some mitigation, yet, in 
reality, she every day became more sen- 
sible of this ; her father was incapable of 
imparting any consolation for it; and even 
her little Alan, for a time, but augmented 
her affliction by the recollections he re- 
vived. 

Her brother, by this time, was reduced 
to that state in which his father had re- 
presented him to be, without the smallest 
hope of his ever being restored to himself; 
so that lord Ambresbury began to look 
upon her son as his future heir. To this 
consideration, more than to any other cir- 
cumstance, was owing the affection he 
shewed him ; for he was naturally of a 
cold selfish disposition, and in his heart 
never forgave the step his daughter had 
taken, though one to which his own ty- 
ranny had driven her. He loved Alan, 
however, as ardently as he was capable of 
loving any one ; and not to have loved 
him indeed would have been next to im- 
possible, so artless, so affectionate, were 
his manners ; b ut notwithstanding his par- 



107 

tiality for him, he would not have been 
sorry to have had his daughter give him 
an heir by a more illustrious father. On 
the first intimation, however, of his wish 
for her making a second choice, Clara put 
a stop to all persecution on the subject, 
by avowing, in the most sacred and so- 
lemn manner, her fixed determination 
against ever changing her state again. 
Worlds indeed could not have induced 
her to give up the dear delight of cherish- 
ing the memory of her husband â€” of hold- 
ing communion with his spirit, and mak- 
ing his virtues her constant theme. 

Next to loving his Heavenly Father, 
the first lesson she taught her infant son 
was to love and revere the memory of his 
earthly one, whom, with inexpressible de- 
light, she saw, in every respect, he pro- 
mised to resemble. The same sweetness 
of disposition, the same kindness and be- 
nevolence of heart, he earlv manifested, 
and, with equal pride and pleasure, she saw 
him likely to grow up all she wushed. 
As he advanced in years, he became ac- 



108 

quainted with the family-history, and 
frequent were the conversations that en- 
sued between them concerning the bro- 
ther of Constance, and fervent their 
wishes, that they had the power of mak- 
ing him amends for what he had been un- 
justly deprived of, and the unkindness 
they learned he had continued to experi- 
ence from fortune ; but on Alan, in the 
warmth of his benevolence, dropping a 
hint of this before his grandfather, lord 
Ambresbury, who detested the whole 
race, unjustly imputing to them the con- 
duct that had entailed eternal remorse 
upon his heart, vehemently protested 
that if, by any chance or accident, he ever 
discovered that, either directly or indi- 
rectly, he or his mother held any kind of 
correspondence or communication with 
either Glenmorlie^ or any one belonging 
to him, from that moment he would cast 
them off, and banish them his presence, 
though the next he should be compelled 
to take in a beggar's brat for his heir. 
This threat, which they knew him too 



109 

well not to know he was capable of carry- 
ing into effect, if provoked to it, com- 
pelled them to suppress their real feelings, 
as they were both completely in his 
power ; for though the title and estate of 
Dunamore must be Mrs. Dundonald's, if 
she survived her brother, yet, till after 
his death, which might not happen till 
long after hers, there was no indepen- 
dence for her or Alan â€” so they were 
obliged to be cautious how they acted. 



CHAPTER VI. 



The person for whom so strong an inter- 
est had been excited in their minds mar- 
ried the daughter of his patron, and, after 
a long series of military services, with- 
drew on lialf-pay, and with the rank of 
colonel, from the army, and . with his 
family, consisting of a wife and daughter, 



110 

became settled at what he almost con- 
sidered as his native place, Dunamore. 

The aspect of the veteran shewed what 
the youthful soldier had been ; but the 
cheerfulness and urbanity that distin- 
guished the early period of his life was 
injured by a rankling sense of injury, and 
the mortifying privations to which injus- 
tice and ingratitude had doomed him. 
His wife, like himself, had been illegally 
deprived of her paternal inheritance : her 
father was an Irishman, and advantage 
was taken of his enforced absence from 
his native country, to make a fraudulent 
transfer of a handsome estate that was en- 
tailed on him there. This, however, un- 
like the inheritance of Glenmorlie himself, 
was retrievable ; but, on their applying to 
some friends, from whom they expected, 
and had a right to expect assistance for 
obtaining redress, they were refused ; and 
thus, whilst legally entitled to two fine 
properties, found themselves absolutely 
without an income almost adequate to their 
wants. 



Ill 

Colonel Glenmorlie, of a lofty temper, 
often evinced extreme impatience under 
these circumstances ; but his wife bore 
them with greater equanimity. Naturally 
of a mild and enduring disposition, re- 
ligion had rendered her still more so; but 
not all her resignation to the will of Hea- 
ven could prevent her sometimes experi- 
encing acute pangs on account of others. 

Their daughter Rosalind, bounding in- 
to life with all the buoyancy of youthful 
spirits, knew nothing â€” felt nothing of the 
cares that at times disturbed and distract- 
ed the minds of her parents. The world 
was just opening to her view, and every 
thing appeared delightful to her ; while 
all that was requisite to have her elevated 
to that rank she wished for in it was, she 
felt convinced, from a sanguine imagina- 
tion and a high confidence in herself, to be 
seen. 

For this rank none could be more as- 
piringly ambitious ; a life of retirement 
was her utter detestation. It might do 
very well for the plain and the uninform- 



1121 

ed, and the untalented ; but for a person 
conscious of high pretensions, the idea of 
it was intolerable. Yes, a person of the 
forjner description might be very well 
satisfied to pass their days like Mrs. Prim- 
rose in making gooseberry-wine, turning 
the green sward like her daughters, and 
playing Pope Joan with their neighbours ; 
but for a person of the latter, how insuf- 
ferable to be doomed to such a life ! and 
she was all impatience for an establish- 
ment that should relieve her from an appre- 
hension of the kind : but to obtain this, it 
was necessary she should enter other cir- 
cles than those she at present occasionally 
mixed in ; for, as yet, she had been intro- 
duced to none more brilliant than those 
of the neighbouring town of Waterton, 
and in which there was very little hope 
of her ever meeting any one she would 
condescend to look upon with an idea of 
accepting. Still, however, it was gratify- 
ing to her to frequent them, both from 
the admiration she excited, and for the 
sake of a little change of scene; but for 



113 

this occasional gratification she was in- 
debted, not to her parents, but the kind- 
ness of their next neighbour, lady Dun- 
druna. They neither Hked the society at 
Waterton, nor could think of trying to 
vie with it ; and without an attempt of 
the kind, there w^as no chance of any pro- 
per attention or respect there ; and though 
the notice of people they certainly con- 
sidered inferior to themselves, with regard 
to family, could be of little consequence 
in the estimation of colonel and Mrs. 
Glenmorlie, they did not like the idea of 
encountering their slights. 

Lady Dundrum was the widow of a 
citizen of this place, who, in going up 
with an address to the lord-lieutenant, 
had been knighted. She was a lady who 
would have been perfectly satisfied never 
to have seen any thing green but a card- 
cloth ; but the good knight, not dying 
quite as rich as was expected, she was 
compelled to give up the dear delight of 
living all the year round where she would 
have had the constant enjoyment of cards 



114 

and gossiping, for a small residence at 
Dunamore, whence, however, she always 
contrived to manage matters so as to be 
able to repair, for the greater part of every 
winter, to Waterton. Having taken a 
fancy to Rosalind, and conceiving the 
chaperoning of a girl of her well-known 
connexions and air of fashion, and lofty 
pretensions, would add to her importance, 
she always took her with her. 

Rosalind was quite as much admired 
and followed as either of them expected, 
and was the means of drawing not a few 
of the fashionable beaux of the place to 
Dunamore during the season, where there 
was a hotel open and balls every fort- 
night, at which lady Dundrum was still 
her chaperon ; for her mother's depressed 
spirits made her dislike scenes of the kind, 
and wish to confine herself to the society 
alone of the few families who resided at 
the place, unlike lady Dundrum, who 
made it a point of visiting every one who 
came there, the moment she knew who 
they were. 



115 

But lady Dundrum was not the ac- 
quaintance whom colonel and Mrs. Glen- 
morlie most regarded, nor even Bosalind. 
The superior claims of the Woodburne 
family to esteem and affection were both 
felt and acknowledged. Mrs. Wood- 
burne was the confidential attendant al- 
ready mentioned of the colonel's mother : 
her parents were respectable tradespeople, 
who, after giving her an excellent educa- 
tion, fell, through unexpected mischances, 
into deep distress, and shortly after died. 
Immediately upon their decease, she de- 
cided on going over to Mrs. Glenmorlie, 
from whose knowledge of her and her 
connexions she felt convinced a dependent 
situation would be more tolerable with 
her than with any other person : nor was 
she mistaken ; Mrs. Glenmorlie considered 
her coming to her almost as a blessing, 
and uniformly treated her more as an elder 
daughter than a servant. 

Compelled by the cruel conduct of lord 
Ambresbury to return to Ireland, she was 
seeking for a situation there when her 



116 

condition became suddenly reversed by 
the unexpected return of Mr. Woodburne 
from Newfoundland, to whom she had 
early been engaged, and their marrying 
immediately after. 

He was some years older than herself* 
had always loved and admired her, and 
was on the very point of asking her hand, 
when, like her parents, experiencing a 
sudden reverse of circumstances, he was 
compelled to give up this intention for the 
present, and go out to Newfoundland, to 
an uncle, who had long been inviting him 
there. After a residence of some years 
with him, he died ; and possessed by his 
death of a handsome independence, he 
immediately returned to Ireland, to com- 
plete his engagement to his dear Esther. 
He was a man of excellent endowments : 
naturally of a studious turn, he had, in 
consequence, highly improved and cul- 
tivated his mind. Few indeed could boast 
of a stronger or better-informed one, 
knew the world better, or were keener in 
their observations; but a temper some- 



117 

what stern, and a sarcastic manner, ren- 
dered him, in general, more feared than 
liked ; yet he had a heart of real feeling; 
but he had no patience with the follies 
and vices of mankind. 

From the advantages she derived from 
her union with him, as well as from her 
natural manner, no one would ever have 
supposed that JMrs. Woodburne had ever 
moved in a subordinate station ; but 
that she had, or rather that she and her 
husband had been connected with trades- 
people, was a fact too well known at 
Waterton to allow of their being admitted 
into the first circles there, despite of all 
their virtues, their excellencies, and even 
handsome independence. This, however, 
gave Mr. Woodburne very little concern. 
He quite as much despised those who had 
excluded him from them, for their frivo- 
lity, their adulation of wealth, however 
acquired or debased, and their aiming at 
what they never could be, as they de- 
spised him for his birth and original situ- 
ation in lifie ; and quietly withdrawing 



118 

from them, fixed himself at Dunamore, 
where, in embellisliing the beautiful cot- 
tage he built there, cultivating the inti- 
macy of a few select friends, and pursu- 
ino: his favourite studies, he never found 
time to regret his not being entitled to 
the privilege of the entree into the 
fashionable circles of Waterton. 

But his chief delight was derived from 
cultivating the mind of his daughter. 
He educated her on his own plan, and 
had no reason to regret the circumstance. 
She grew up all he wished, and he was 
not very easily to be pleased. INIild 
and well-informed, without any lack of 
firmness, where firmness was requisite, 
he allowed of no gaddings, no visitings 
from home, no waste of time on accom- 
plishments she had no taste for. It filled 
him with disgust to hear parents boast 
of having compelled their daughters to 
sit six or seven hours of a day at a piano, 
trying to acquire what they had no 
genius for, and which, when no longer 
required as an embellishment, they would 



119 

discard. Anna had no taste for music, 
and having ascertained this, her father 
ceased to torment either her or himself 
about it, making her devote the time she 
would have thrown away upon it to 
what she had in reality a turn for â€” draw- 
ing and reading. 

Rosalind was beautiful, even faultlessly 
beautiful, but Anna had no pretensions 
to be considered so. To describe her, and 
you would not have supposed her to be 
particularly attractive ; but to look at her, 
you would feel her to be so. Yet she had 
neither brilliancy of complexion, nor any 
striking symmetry of features or person ; 
but there was a sweetness â€” a softness, 
amounting indeed at times to languor, 
in her looks, and an unstudied elegance 
in all her movements, that were very re- 
sistless. For the languor just spoken of 
there was a reason assigned : it was whis- 
pered that she had met with a disappoint- 
ment, nor was the whisper an incorrect 
one. In a visit with her parents to an- 
other part of the kingdom, she met colo- 



120 

nel Montmorency : her appearance and 
manner struck him ; he got introduced, 
became a daily visitor at the house where 
she was, and finally proposed for her, and 
was accepted as a match far exceeding 
any expectations her parents could ration- 
ally have entertained for her, being both 
of noble birth and fortune. 

Matters were arranging for their mar- 
riage, when at a party, one evening, the 
colonel encountered an officer of distin- 
guished rank, belonging to a regiment 
just arrived at the place. Both seemed 
agitated by the encounter, and the emo- 
tion they betrayed, exciting the curiosity 
of Mr. Woodburne, occasioned inquiries, 
the result of which was his ascertaining, 
that, a few years back colonel Montmo- 
rency had been the unfortunate cause of 
estranging a married relative of the other 
from her family. The moment he learned 
this, he decided, that, with his consent, 
his daughter never should become his 
wife; no rank, no fortune, no w^orldly 
advantages, in his opinion, being an equi- 



121 

valent for the want of religious and moral 
principles â€” the risk a woman must run, 
with regard to her own eternal and tem- 
poral happiness, who marries a dissipated 
man, or one who, if he does not rush into 
temptation, is at least incapable of resist- 
ing it when it offers. His decision was 
made known, but he left his daughter to 
her own ; he did not command, but he 
represented and appealed, and finally suc- 
ceeded by doing so : she had early bee^ 
taught to let her reason, not her feelings, 
govern her; and when she found herself 
sinking under any arduous conflict, to look 
up for strength and support whence alone 
it could be truly imparted. The lesson 
was not now forgotten, and the result was 
a triumph of the proudest nature to the 
heart of her father. 

But the lover did not so readily yield 
submission to his will ; he pleaded, he im- 
plored, he urged a thousand extenuating 
circumstances in excuse for his error, and, 
in agony, besought Mr. Woodburne to 

VOL. I. G 



122 

have mercy, nor deprive him of the only 
woman he had ever really loved. But all 
would not do : yet it required the greatest 
effort of resolution on the part of Mr. 
Woodburne to maintain his inflexibility, 
moved as he was by the distress he saw 
he had occasioned, and doing ample jus- 
tice, as he did, to the generous feelings of 
Montmorency's heart ; but believing him- 
self right, nothing could shake his resolu- 
tion. 

For a time perhaps his daughter, de- 
spite of herself, thought he had been a 
little too rigid; but still struggling with 
her feelings, she gradually became convin- 
ced of the propriety of his determination, 
and, for every pang it had cost her, became 
at length fully compensated, by not mere- 
ly the heightened affection, but even re- 
verence, with which her father regarded 
her for the victory she had obtained over 
herself 

Yet a feeling of regret would now and 
then be experienced, stealing the faint co- 
lour from her cheek, and giving a sickly 



1^3 

languor to her air ; fancy would stray after 
Montmorency, for he was all that was cap- 
tivating and interesting to the heart of 
woman â€” handsome, gallant, br^ve, accom- 
plished, and incapable of a premeditatedly- 
dishonourable action ; and she would in- 
voluntarily sigh at what he had endured, 
and still might be enduring, for her. 

Few however gave her credit for what 
had occurred; those who actually knew 
of an engagement between her and Mont- 
morency, choosing to believe that it w^as not 
her fault, but his, that it had been broken 
off; and of this opinion was lady Dun- 
drum. â€” " It was quite ridiculous," she de- 
clared, " to think any thing else â€” to ima- 
gine that either father or daughter would 
have been silly enough to lose such a 
match, merely because the lover was not 
quite a sir Charles Grandison ; the fact was, 
he had never been serious, and the report 
of his being so entirely originated in their 
wishes." 

Anna left every one to their conjectures 
G 2 



124 

â–  â€” neither feeling nor generosity would 
permit her to disclose the truth ; not even 
to Rosalind, whom she considered in the 
light of a sister, did she reveal it ; her 
wounded heart indeed rendering her in- 
capable of touching on the subject, even 
if her delicacy had been less. 

Rosalind returned her affection very 
sincerely ; but still, notwithstanding her 
esteem and regard for her, there were mo- 
ments when there was an awkwardness in 
her feelings about her ; lady Dun drum 
had imbued her with the prejudices of the 
people of Waterton, and a dread of losing 
her cast there, should she be known to be 
the intimate of Anna, made her often shy 
and strange towards her. Yet never was 
she so, that she did not immediately after- 
wards reproach herself for ingratitude and 
littleness of mind, in slighting so superior 
a creature, for the sake of those frivolous, 
empty-hearted, empty-headed beings that 
composed the parties there : still she could 
not rise superior to their narrow preju- 
dices ; and while all delight in the com- 



125 

pany of Anna at Dunamore, was all dis- 
may and apprehension on seeing her at 
Waterton : and this she was always sure 
of doing there, for poor Mrs. Woodburne, 
who was one of the sincerest of human 
beings herself, and, of course, took every 
one according to their seeming, always 
made it a point of putting off whatever 
business she had there till lady Dundrum's 
visit to it, it was so pleasant to have a 
friend to go to there immediately ; and 
then when there, she was often in the ha- 
bit of proposing that Anna, whom she 
wished to be introduced more generally 
into society, should accompany them in 
some of their visits, or to the play, or an 
assembly ; and these propositions put lady 
Dundrum to the necessity of a thousand 
evasions and subterfuges, for she by no 
means wished to give offence, where there 
was such ample power of giving good en- 
tertainments, and rendering a variety of 
little kindnesses. 

Whether Anna saw through these eva- 
sions, or suspected their motive, she kept 



126 

to herself. Not so her father, however ; he 
saw through one, and surmised the other; 
and though he would not degrade himself 
by speaking to lady Dundrum on the sub- 
ject, he could not forbear giving utterance 
to the contempt with which she had, in con- 
quence, inspired him, neither to the indig- 
nation he felt towards Rosalind. But Mrs. 
Woodburne would not be persuaded to 
believe any thing to the prejudice of the 
latter ; and her husband ceased to try and 
induce her, from the pain he saw it occa- 
sioned her. Her affection for both Rosa- 
lind and her parents, indeed, was of a de- 
scription that would not permit her to 
hearken to any thing to their prejudice â€” 
for the former, in particular, from her 
strong likeness to the little daughter of the 
lamented Constance, whom she had loved 
with the most passionate fondness, and 
meant, had it lived, to have reared as 
her own child, till her uncle claimed her. 
Glenmorlie and his wife, however, on every 
occasion, manifested the high estimation 
in which they held Woodburne and his 



127 

family ; they were never so happy in any 
society, and the most cordial intimacy sub- 
sisted between them. 

The fondness of Mrs. Woodburne for 
Rosalind was often manifested in presents, 
that had a startling effect on her father 
from their magnitude ; they seemed above 
her means of making; but whenever he 
remonstrated with her on the subject, and 
her arguments and assertions failed of sa- 
tisfying him, those of her husband were 
called to her aid ; and as the colonel knew 
him to be a man of prudence, and not a 
person by any means to be ever hurried 
away by any flighty or romantic notions, 
he always felt easy when he had vindi- 
cated her from the imputation of indis- 
cretion. Still he did not like to see that, 
both in number and value, their gifts to 
her exceeded those to their daughter. An- 
na had no taste for music â€” she did not 
therefore require a harp ; and one of the 
most costly description had been present- 
ed by them to Rosalind ; but she certain- 
ly had a right to expect that the orna- 



1^ 

ments they gave her should equal in num- 
ber and magnificence those they bestowed 
on her friend, which never was the case. 

The season for Dunaniore was commen- 
cing, and some early visitors to it arrived; 
they were known to the Woodburnes, and 
a party, soon after their arrival, was made 
to view Dunamore Abbey. Rosalind, as 
a thing of course, was included in it ; but 
her parents declined it â€” her father could 
not endure the galling sensations excited 
by the view of a place of which he had been 
so unjustly deprived, and her mother would 
not leave him ; but Kosalind was delight- 
ed at the idea of rambling over it, her 
knowledge of it having as yet been con- 
fined to the exterior. 

The party set out at an early hour, tak- 
ing a cold dinner with them. The morn- 
ing was lovely, and every countenance 
wore a smile of hilarity ; but there is some- 
thing inspiring in a rural party, a bustle 
and deviation from the usual routine of 
regular life, that is an agreeable excite- 
ment to the spirits. 



129 

Dunamore Abbey, of date so ancient 
as to be uncertain, stood in one of those 
deep, dark, secluded glens, for which Ire- 
land is so remarkable, where all is wild 
and romantic, solemn and obscure, alter- 
nately calculated to inspire awe, and fill 
with melancholy. The trees which diver- 
sified the prospect were chiefly seen climb 
ing the steep mountains, to form long ca- 
thedral walks on their summits, or start- 
ing from the rocky banks, save where a 
beautiful grove in the centre, surrounding 
the building, gave it still an air of monas- 
tic seclusion ; through this the grand arch 
of entrance was seen, while the spiry pin- 
nacles of the pile rose in majestic grandeur 
above the trees, the straight boles of 
which, together with the verdure of the 
ground under their deep shadow (perceiv- 
ed at a great depth in the grove, in conse- 
quence of their distance from each other), 
produced an uncommon and solemn scene; 
the very sunbeams that chequered the 
ground seemed slumbering on it, whilst 
g3 



130 

the deer that herded under the trees suf- 
fered no disturbance from the sight of 
strangers. 

A beautiful stream held a murmuring 
course through the glen till it approach- 
ed the abbey, when it began to assume 
a different character ; and after being lost 
to the eye for some time behind some 
shrudbby banks, forming, by their breaks 
and foliage, a rich foreground, again burst 
both upon the eye and ear, in a fall of 
some magnitude over craggy rocks, over- 
grown with fern and brushwood. Here, 
looking back, the abbey was seen rearing 
its stately pinnacles above a noble screen 
of wood, while, at the opposite side of the 
stream, a picturesque cottage met the view, 
designed for the accommodation of chance 
visitors to the place. From the briglit 
green knoll on which it stood, zigzag 
steps, cut in the rock, wound through the 
flowering plantations, to an ancient shrine 
at the edge of the stream, and almost 
within reach of the spray of the fall ; hence 
a number of romantic walks diverged in 



131 

various directions, commanding fine views 
of the sea and adjacent country. 

The housekeeper was in waiting to shew 
them the interior, which was what Ro- 
salind wanted to see ; and she flew from 
room to room, admiring every thing she 
saw, and describing what alterations she 
would have made if it were hers. At 
length they entered an apartment of so 
magnificent a description, that she linger- 
ed here for some time after all the rest of 
the party but the Woodburnes had left 
it. â€” " Well," she suddenly exclaimed, 
" this is certainly a very delightful place, 
and I think I should have become it very 
well. To console me for its deprivation, 
its destined lord, in common honour and 
justice, should positively, come over, fall 
in love with me, marry me, and thus 
make amends for the past." 

" And he will," said an unknown voice, 
close to her. 

Rosalind started, and looked wildly a- 
bout her â€” " W'fe was that?" she de- 
manded. L' 



132 

** Who?" repeated Mr. Woodbume; 
" who do you mean ?" 

" Why, the person who spoke this in- 
stant." 

" The person !" again repeated Mr. Wood- 
bume ; ^ why there is no one here but our- 
selves.'' 

*â€¢' Yet, positively, 1 heard another voice ;" 
and she again looked round her. 

" Oh, you imagined so !" said Mr. Wood- 
bume ; " but this is quite a place for ro- 
mantic fancies." 

" Why, you would not attempt to per- 
suade me out of my senses, I hope, sir ?" 
said Rosalind, a little petulantly. 

" Me ! no â€” I should be sony to try and 
pei'suade you out of any thing that is use- 
ful ; but you see there is no one, as I have 
already said, here but ourselves." 

" True so, I perceive, in this apartment 
â€” but here ;" and she pushed open a small 
arched door at the side of the fireplace, 
which she had not before noticed, and 
passed into another apartment ; but there 
was no one in it, and she really began to 



133 

feel surprised ; yet that her ear had not 
deceived her she felt convinced, for she 
had actually felt the breath of the person 
who spoke upon her cheek. 

Mr. Woodburne laughed at her air of 
consternation, and his wife joined in his 
mirth ; and the former was rallying her 
on the subject, when they were called to 
join the rest of the party. 

Dwelling, however, on the recent inci- 
dent, while her companions were hurry- 
ing from one state apartment to another, 
Rosalind kept looking into every place 
they passed, and making her way through 
innumerable galleries and passages by her- 
self In traversing one, she suddenly 
thought she heard Mr. Woodburne con- 
versing with some one; and instantly burst- 
ing into the apartment whence she heard 
his voice, found him in deep conversation 
with a stranger of most prepossessing ap- 
pearance â€” young, majestically tall, finely 
formed, and with a countenance of the 
most captivating expression. Eith^ the 
suddenness with which she bolted in up- 



134 

on them, or some other cause, made them 
both start at her appearance ; but Mr. 
Woodburne almost instantly recovering 
himself â€” " Yes," he said, but as if he had 
not noticed her, and was only finishing 
what he had been saying, " you are quite 
correct, perfectly so, in your observations, 
sir ; there is a great deal to admire and 
applaud, and " 

But Rosalind felt convinced, from his 
manner, that he was speaking at random, 
for the purpose of misleading her as to 
what he had actually been conversing a- 
bout, and this persuasion made her look 
inquiringly from one to the other ; while, 
as unconsciously, she kept advancing into 
the room, the stranger kept retreating, till 
he had vanished from it. â€” " Who is that ?" 
in an eager tone, Rosalind demanded, the 
moment she found he was gone. 

" Don't you perceive he is a stranger?" 
said Mr. Woodburne, evasively. 

" Yes, I perceive he is a stranger to me, 
but is he so to you ?" 



135 

" Did you ever see him with me be- 
fore?" asked Mr. Woodbiirne. 

" No, but still you may know him, and 
do you know I think you do â€” now do tell 
his name." 

" I cannot,''' said Mr. Woodburne ; " but 
come here â€” I want to shew you this pic- 
ture," pointing to the full-length portrait 
of a female, opposite to which he was stand- 
ing â€” " Do you know we were saying â€” 
that is, I mean â€” " and he spoke in confu- 
sion â€” " I was thinking you had a resem- 
blance to it." 

" Oh ! I have seen it already," replied 
Rosalind, carelessly, " for we were in this 
apartment before;" but suddenly stopping 
to contemplate again the portrait of a 
young warrior that was hanging beside it 
â€” " Do you know I think there is a great 
likeness between this picture and the 
stranger you have just been speaking with, 
and, Hke this sir Armascis, as I understand 
he was called, I think he would very well 
become the plume and casque." 

" Yes, I believe he might look well e- 



136 

novigh as a knight in a lady's bower; but 
where are your companions ?" 
-^'** Oh, Lord ! I don't know â€” gazing and 
gdping about them, and keeping close at 
the heels of the housekeeper, I suppose, 
lest they should lose any of her scientific 
observations ; but, for my part, whenever 
I come to see a place of the kind, I always 
make my escape, to have the pleasure of 
exploring it by myself, for to me there is 
nothing more monstrously stupid than 
being led mechanically through it." 

" Stupid enough," said Mr. Woodburne ; 
" but come, suppose we rejoin the party, 
they may else get uneasy, lest we should 
have got ourselves involved in some of 
the inextricable passages of the place, or 
stumbled into some secret chamber." 

Rosalind laughed, and followed him ; 
and as they proceeded again, kept looking 
into every little cell or chamber they pass- 
ed, but without seeing any one. At 
length they reached the apartment where 
their companions were. 

The curiosity of Rosalind was power- 



137 

fully excited, and she took an opportunity 
of slyly asking the housekeeper what other 
parties were viewing the place that day ? 

" None," she replied. 

" Oh ! I thought there had ; we met a 
stranger in another of the apartments, and 
that made me think so ; can you tell me 
who he is ?" with affected carelessness she 
asked. 

" Tell who he is ?" repeated the house- 
keeper, in a vague tone, and staring at 
her^ â€” " I â€” I â€” '' But a violent fit of cough- 
ing here interrupted her speech ; and ere 
she had recovered from it, Mr. Wood- 
bume, with Anna, had joined Rosalind, 
to direct her attention to some of the or- 
naments of the apartment, which they 
shortly after left to range about the grounds. 

Their dinner was laid out in the cottage 
already mentioned, to which the rocks 
at the fall formed a rude bridge; and al- 
together they passed what they considered 
a very delightful day. 



138 



CHAPTER VII. 



" Who is it that they have got sick and 
concealed at Mr. Woodburne's ?" asked 
lady Dundrum, a few days after, of Rosa- 
lind, as they were sauntering down to the 
strand together. 

" Sick and concealed !" repeated Rosa- 
lind, in a tone of astonishment : " what 
has put that in your head, my dear ma- 
dam?" 

" Oh ! it certainly is the case," resumed 
lady Dundrum. " A chaise-and-four stop- 
ped there the other night at a very late 
hour, and a gentleman was seen alighting 
from it, who has never since been seen ; 
but the very next day an express was sent 
to Waterton for doctor Woolmers." 

Rosalind mused. Doctor Woolmers 
had certainly been down at the time men- 
tioned, and she had wondered who it was 



139 

he had come to see ; and she now recol- 
lected she had recently seen scarce any 
thing of the Woodburnes, and that their 
excuses for not coming out, or asking her 
to stop when she called, had appeared ra- 
ther vague and confused ; yet still it ap- 
peared so improbable that this should be 
owing to the cause assigned by lady Dun- 
drum, that she could not believe it. 

She could not help dwelling, however, 
on what she had heard, and involuntarily, 
on parting from lady Dundrum, her feet 
took the direction of Mr. Woodburne's ; 
and entering the parlour abruptly, she 
found Anna and her mother there. 
They were both quietly seated at work, 
and appeared very glad to see her; and 
after looking about her for some time, and 
listening without either seeing or hearing 
any thing unusual, she became confirmed 
in her belief of what she had heard from 
lady Dundrum being quite an idle tale, 
and began to wonder at herself, for hav- 
ing allowed it to make any impression on 
her. 



140 

The conversation involuntarily reverted 
to the day they had passed at the abbey. 
A great many anecdotes connected with 
it followed. Rosalind spoke of the family- 
history, and commented with bitterness 
on the wrongs her father had sustained. â€” 
" And to think," she said, " that the fa- 
tnily in England should not have the feel- 
ing or generosity to try and make some 
arinends for these. There is Mrs. Dundo- 
nald and her son: if they were what some 
people have pretended to represent them, 
they never could have acted in such a man- 
tlet; he at least, his own master, in the 
army, could well have contrived, if so in- 
clined, to have shewed us some attention ; 
but they are an abominable set altogether, 
and I am sure I do not wonder at my fa- 
ther hating and execrating their names ; 
for my part, all I hope is, that I may ne- 
ver see any of them, for my prejudice is 
so great against them, that I am sure I 
never could look upon them with an eye 
of goodwill." 

A deep sigh was heard; she started. â€” 



141 

" Who is that ?" she demanded ; and with- 
out waiting for a reply, she started from 
her chair, and attempted to enter the ad- 
joining room, which was Mr. Woodburne's 
study ; but as she pushed against the door, 
which was a little ajar, it was gently 
closed against her. 

She turned inquiringly to her compa- 
nions. â€” " The wind has shut the door," 
said Mrs. Woodburne, but without exact- 
ly looking at her, while Anna kept her 
eyes firmly fixed upon a little drawing she 
was finishing. 

Wondering, and musing, and reverting 
to what lady Dundrum had told her, Ro- 
salind reseated herself; but in the course 
of a few minutes again starting up, she 
ran into the garden, saying she wanted to 
look at Anna's geraniums. She kept close 
to the study-windows, but the blinds of 
all were down, except one â€” that was a 
little raised ; but on her approaching it, 
â€¢with an intention of looking into the 
apartment, it was gently dropped, and a 



U2 

doubt could no longer be entertained of 
there being some one within. 

That it could be of no consequence to 
her to know w^ho it was, she felt persuad- 
ed. This persuasion, however, could not 
prevent her earnestly wishing to ascertain, 
so powerful is the spirit of curiosity in 
almost every breast ; and accordingly, on 
Anna's joining her, which she almost im- 
mediately did, she was tempted to ask 
her; but when she reflected how very un- 
likely it was that Anna would betray any 
thing her parents wished to keep secret, 
and the impropriety, not to say imperti- 
nence, of any one's attempting to pry into 
what others chose to keep secret, she 
checked herself, though not without diffi- 
culty, and finally decided on saying no- 
thing on the subject. 

A day or two after this, Mr. Wood- 
burne left home for some time, but with- 
out its being mentioned whither he was 
gone ; and during his absence tidings were 
received of the death of the long-suffering 



143 

lord Dunamore and his father, with an in- 
timation of his sister being in so languish- 
ing a state, that it was not expected she 
would long survive her accession to the 
titles and estates of her family. 

About this time the scene promised to 
be changed with Rosahnd. The earl and 
countess of Monteagle, coming over in 
their beautiful yacht, to pay a visit to 
their seat in the southern part of the king- 
dom, got embayed, through a sudden 
change of weather, in the dangerous bay 
of Dunamore, and were with difficulty ex- 
tricated from the vessel, ere it got dashed 
upon the rocks. Colonel Glenmorlie was 
active in his exertions on the occasion ; and 
his house being nearest the spot where 
they landed, the fainting countess was 
conveyed to it. 

On recovering a little from her terror, 
they would have removed to the hotel ; 
but aware that she would not be so well 
attended to there as with them, the colo- 
nel and Mrs. Glenmorlie invited them to 
remain with them with so much cordial- 



144 

ity, that the invitation was gratefully ac- 
cepted ; and in the week that ensued, so 
great a degree of intimacy took place be- 
tween the earl and the colonel, that in 
their rides and rambles about the place, 
much of the family-history of the latter 
was imparted to his lordship. 

Lord Monteagle was, in a great degree, 
a being of impulse â€” lively in his feelings, 
and prompt in his services. The commu- 
nications of Glenmorlie deeply interested 
him ; and yielding to the feelings they 
inspired, he swore he should be righted. â€” 
" The scoundrel !" he exclaimed, alluding 
to the person who kept fraudulent posses- 
sion of the property of Mrs. Glenmorlie ; 
" how 1 enjoy the idea of his being at 
length ousted! would that we had met 
before! but, thank God! it is not yet too 
late for the purpose of enabling you to ob- 
tain justice;" and he pressed his services 
upon the colonel with so much warmth, 
so much feeling, that the other could not 
bring himself to refuse them. 

The amiable countess, participating in 



145 

the feelings of her lord, tnily rejoiced at 
his conduct on this occasion ; and highly 
interested by the family, and charmed 
with Rosalind, determined on not letting 
her wait for the perhaps-slow decision of 
the law, to be introduced into the circles 
she would adorn, and accordingly gave 
her an invitation to accompany her at once 
to Monteagle Castle. 

We need scarcely say it was joyfully 
accepted ; Rosalind was almost wild with 
delight at it, and various were the feelings 
which its announcement excited in other 
bosoms; all however were unanimous 
in thinking that she would never return 
home unmarried. 

But with all her affection for herâ€” ^all 
the delight she took in any thing that 
promised to be of advantage to her, Mrs. 
Woodburne was all dismay and apprehen- 
sion when she heard of it. â€” " And oh 
that they had never come â€” had never been 
driven here !" was her exclamation, in a 
tone of even agony, on hearing of it. " To 

VOLr I* H 



146 

think that after all was so well planned, 
so well arranged, there should be a chance 
of disappointment, for I know you will 
be getting lovers," she cried, addressing 
herself to Rosalind, " and getting mar- 
ried ; and then there is an end of all our 
delightful hopes and expectations." 

" What hopes or expectations?" de- 
manded Rosalind. " You did not hope or 
expect," laughing, " to get me married to 
your little dumpy favourite, Mr. Griffin." 

" No matter, or at least it seems no 
matter to me now, what favourite I ex- 
pected to get you married to," cried Mrs. 
Woodburne, dejectedly; " but perhaps, 
after all, you wont go ; and do, my dar- 
ling," throwing her arms round her neck, 
and fondly kissing her â€” " do, my darling, 
give up this invitation ; and take my word 
for it, you wont regret it." 

" But I shall not be very long away," 
said Rosalind. 

" Oh ! long enough â€” long enough, I 
fear, to occasion greater disappointment 
than you are aware of, except you would 



147 

promise not to accept â€” not to think of any 
one till you come back." 

" Well, I will promise â€” positively pro- 
mise," said Rosalind, laughing, " not to 
accept or think of any one I don't like." 

" Well, well, it can't be helped," said 
Mrs. Woodburne, sorrowfully shaking her 
head ; " all I can say is what I said be- 
fore, that I wish the earl and countess had 
not been driven hither." 

" Now that is the first ill-natured thing 
I ever heard you say, my own dear second 
mamma!" said Rosalind; "knowing, as 
you do, how often I have been wishing 
to see something besides the stupid hum- 
drums of Waterton." 

She could not help being diverted by 
Mrs. Woodburne's apprehensions about 
her leaving Dunamore. The only way in 
which she could account for her anxiety 
to keep her there was by a wish she had 
long imagined she and ]Mr. Woodburne 
entertained to have her married to a rela- 
tion of their own, whom they were often in 
H 2 



148 

the habit of talking to her about, and from 
whom they were, about this time, expecting 
a visit ; whether she went or staid, how- 
ever, could be of little consequence with 
regard to him, as a man who had made 
his money in trade, as he had done, it was 
out of the question she could ever think 
of accepting; and to avoid an introduction 
to him was an additional motive for the 
pleasure she derived from the countess's 
invitation. 

At length the party left Dunamore, and 
in due time arrived at the magnificent 
Castle of Monteagle, where they were re- 
ceived by the countess's mother, Mrs. Tre- 
lawney, who had preceded them from 
England, a very stiff, stately, imperious 
lady, quite as fond of cards as lady Dun- 
drum, and, if possible, still more so of in- 
terfering about others. Though all joy 
and flutter at the idea of accompanying 
the countess, yet when Rosalind actually 
found herself on the point of quitting 
home, her spirits sunk ; scarcely, however, 
had she entered Monteagle Castle, ere de- 



149 

jection gave way to the intoxicating effect 
produced upon her senses by the splendour 
and magnificence that here met her view ; 
she began to feel as if till now she had never 
been in her proper element â€” to look back 
with distaste and aversion on all she had 
been accustomed to, and feel that if com- 
pelled to pass her life amidst such scenes, 
she must be miserable. 

The countess, by her fond caresses and 
extravagant admiration, innocently con- 
tributed to heighten her vanity and ambi- 
tionÂ« Not satisfied with leaving it to 
chance to have her noticed and admired, 
she was continually extolling her to her 
guests, and pointing her out as something 
superlatively lovely, and lovely she cer- 
tainly was â€” 

" Her form was fresher than the morning n^se 
When the dew wets its leaves; unstain'd and pure 
As is the lily, or the mountain snow ; 



While- 



-a native grace 



Sat fair-pro portion'd on her polish'd limbs." 

But while the countess, by her partiality, 
occasioned her to be flattered by some, she 



150 

drew upon her not a little ill-will and en- 
vy from others. Mrs. Trelawney was a- 
mongst those ; she had a kind of antipa- 
thy to beauty and excellence in any one 
she was not immediately connected with, 
and soon, accordingly, began to look with 
a scowling brow upon Rosalind, and ex- 
press her disapprobation at her having 
been brought to the castle. â€” " Very im- 
prudent, I must tell you, I think it was, 
lady Monteagle," she said, " very impru- 
dent, indeed, to bring that girl here ! It is 
very ridiculous for people to trifle with 
their domestic tranquillity, by putting 
temptation in the way of any one. Men 
are frail creatures, and there is no know- 
ing what may happen from the circum- 
stance." 

" Nay, my dear mother," said the coun- 
tess, laughing, " you shall not make me 
jealous of Monteagle." 

" Jealous ! really, lady Monteagle, you 
speak strangely â€” God forbid I had an idea 
of the kind ! I should be the basest of 
women if I could insinuate any thing to 



151 

his prejudice" (and here she spoke but the 
truth) ; " but your son, lady Monteagle â€” 
your son â€” what will you say, should he 
take a fancy to your protegee V 

" Oh dear ! I have no fear of that ; he 
must admire her, as every one must that 
has an eye for beauty ; but he knows our 
expectations too well for him to think of 
disappointing them." 

" Yes, and so did your lord the expec- 
tations of his father, and yet he disap- 
pointed them," Mrs. Trelawney was on 
the point of adding, but timely checked 
herself This indeed had been the case â€” 
the earl's marriage with her daughter had 
been quite against the consent of his fa- 
mily, particular circumstances rendering 
it a very undesirable connexion in their 
eyes, though they did ample justice to 
her merits. 

Highly disagreeable when she chose to 
be so, Rosalind was more than once so of- 
fended by the rude repulsive manners of 
Mrs. Trelawney as to be on the point of 
taking her departure, but still checked 



152 

herself from yielding to the impulse of in- 
dignation, by reflecting on what she should 
lose by the circumstance. In the first 
place, the earl and countess, whose imme- 
diate guest she was, were all that was kind 
and attentive ; and in the next, their son, 
lord Orielton, was shortly expected to join 
them at the castle from abroad; and vague 
ideas had begun to occupy her mind con- 
cerning him, such as induced her to wish 
to prolong her stay at the castle, and finally 
to decide on not minding Mrs. Trelawney, 
or letting her drive her from it. 

But Mrs. Trelawney was not the only 
person whom her being an inmate in it 
provoked and displeased â€” a neighbouring 
family, of the name of Liscarrol, nearly 
related to lord Monteagle, were equally 
exasperated at the circumstance. Mrs. liis- 
carrol had long made up her mind, that 
nothing was wanting but an introduction 
to lady Monteagle, to have her take her 
daughters under her immediate protec- 
tion, and introduce them into the brilliant 
circles of London ; and she still persevered 



153 

in thinking this would have been the case, 
but for Rosalind, and accordingly could 
not bring herself to look with calmness 
on her, from the idea of her usurping the 
place they should have occupied. Her 
daughters participating in her angry and 
jealous feelings, Rosalind had therefore 
but very little pleasure in their society ; 
they conducted themselves so artfully, 
however, that while in reality they were 
all spite and malice towards her, the coun- 
tess had not the slightest suspicion of their 
real sentiments, more especially as Rosa- 
lind herself disdained speaking of the va- 
rious slights she met with from them. 

She had been some weeks at the castle, 
during which she received an account of 
the death of lady Dunamore ; when ac- 
companying the family from it to a din- 
ner-party one day at Mr. Liscarrol's, she 
heard the Miss Liscarrols speaking in rap- 
tures of a major Ancram, to whom they 
had been introduced the preceding day, at 
a house where they were visiting.â€”" With- 
H 3 



154 

out exception, I think him the handsom- 
est creature I ever beheld," said Miss Lis- 
carrol. 

^ And so elegant !" exclaimed Miss Pe- 
nelope, her sister. 

" And so accomplished !'* cried Miss 
Annise, her other sister. 

" And was so anxious for an introduc- 
tion to us," said Miss Liscarrol. 

" I quite long to have a glimpse of 
him," cried one of the confidential friends 
to whom these observations were made, to 
the utter neglect of Rosalind, who was 
allowed to occupy a solitary seat in one of 
the windows. 

*' And so do I" â€” " And so do I," cried 
another, and another. 

" And well, I rather believe you will 
have an opportunity of gratifying your 
curiosity to-day," said Miss Liscarrol ; *^ for 
his friend, Mr. Glenmire, promised mam- 
ma positively, that if they could possibly 
excuse themselves from a party to which 
they w^ere engaged, he and major Ancram 
would be here to dinner." 



155 

" Major Ancram !" repeated lord Mont- 
eagle, overhearing them ; " that is the 
name of a brave young fellow, who has 
very much distinguished himself in some 
of the recent campaigns on the Conti- 
nent." 

" Yes, the same we are speaking of," 
said Miss Liscarrol ; " and I assure you," 
in an affected tone, " he looks the hero he 
is," and she was about launching again in- 
to extravagant ^icomiums when he and 
his friend were announced. 

But little interested by what she had 
been listening to, Rosalind scarcely gave 
herself the trouble of turning her head ; 
but when she did, what was her surprise, 
perhaps her emotion, at recognising in 
the handsome soldier the elegant stranger 
whom she had encountered in the abbey, 
and whose idea had often since recurred 
to her imagination ! She felt herself co- 
lour, and could not avoid looking earnestly 
at him, to see whether he would recollect 
her : she was not long in suspense about 
this â€” having paid his compliments to the 



156 

ladies of the house, he disengaged him- 
self from Mr. Liscarrol, who began speak- 
ing to him, and approaching her â€” " I 
know not," he said, " whether Miss Glen- 
morlie will allow me the honour of claim- 
ing acquaintance with her, unintroduced 
as I was when I had the pleasure of meet- 
ing her ; but still I cannot refrain from ad- 
dressing her, as if she would." 

Rosalind bowed and smiled, and, to the 
utter dismay of the Liscarrols, as well as 
mortification of their set, he took a seat 
beside her. 

His voice was in unison with his ap- 
pearance, and that Rosalind thought even 
still more interesting than she had done 
at first ; but that might have been owing 
to his dress : he was in the deepest mourn- 
ing, and an air of pensiveness, amounting 
almost to sadness, hung upon his brow, 
that seemed to intimate it was not the 
mockery of wo he bore about him. The 
day on which they had met was reverted 
to ; but nothing escaped him like any ac- 
knowledgment of being acquainted with 



157 

Mr. Woodburne; and at length Rosa- 
lind made up her mind to his being a to- 
tal stranger to the place, contrary to what, 
though she knew not why, she had often 
previously imagined. 

She never had felt more pleased â€” more 
flattered, than by the pleasure he evinced 
at seeing her, indicating, as it did, that 
she had not been unnoticed by him on 
their first meeting. It afforded her too a 
kind of triumph she could not help enjoy- 
ing, over those who had taken such pains 
to slight and mortify her ; and altogether 
elated by the circumstance, she had never 
felt more inclined to render herself agree- 
able. He sat by her at dinner ; and as 
exclusively as politeness to others would 
allow, his attentions were devoted to 
her. 

The Miss Liscarrols could scarcely re- 
frain from downright rudeness, on return- 
ing to the drawing-room ; but Rosalind, 
now aware in what this originated, no 
longer regarded it: she soon saw they 
would have recourse to every manoeuvre 



158 

to try and prevent his singling her out 
again. 

With the rest of the young people 
they adjourned to the music-room, in or- 
der, she was convinced, to intercept him 
on his coming up from dinner, in his way 
to the inner drawing-room ; but the stra- 
tagem failed : on perceiving she was not 
in the music-room, he quickly disengaged 
himself from the party there, and joining 
her in the next, again entered into conver- 
sation with her ; but this was not long al- 
lowed to continue uninterrupted; MissLis- 
carrol watched his movements, and as she 
seated herself at the piano, suddenly asked 
him whether he was not fond of music. 

Politeness would not permit him to de- 
cline this indirect invitation to attend to 
her, but he hesitated to obey it till he saw 
whether Rosalind would accompany him. 

When Miss Liscarrol saw them enter- 
ing the room together, she flounced round 
on her chair ; and venting her vexation 
on the unfortunate piano, by giving it 
what might be termed a thump, dashed 



159 

at once into a bravura, which, from the 
discordant nature of her feelings at the 
moment, had any thing but harmony to 
recommend it. 

Her sisters and several others of the 
party succeeded her at the instrument, 
but Rosalind was not once asked to take 
a seat at it. 

Major Ancram looked his surprise at 
the circumstance, and when at length he 
found them entirely quitting it, for the 
purpose of commencing dancing, could 
not refrain himself from asking her. 

" Oh, some other time !" she replied, 
carelessly ; " but now to oblige you â€” now 
would only be to delay an amusement 
that is more agreeable." 

" Impossible !" he returned, warmly ; 
" nothing could be so delightful as to hear 
you sing and play." 

" Indeed !" cried Rosahnd ; " and pray 
how do you know that ? Is it by divina- 
tion you know I play so divinely as you 
would have me to infer you are think- 
ing?" 



160 

" No, not exactly by that," he replied, 
laughing and colouring ; "but still I do 
know you both play and sing divinely." 

" Well, I should like to know how you 
have attained this knowledge ?" cried Ro- 
salind. 

" Why, suppose, from the expression 

J) 

" Oh, come, I hate studied compli- 
ments !" said Rosalind, laughingly inter- 
rupting him. 

" But the compliments you receive can 
never be studied ; they must be involun- 
tary." 

" Ah, that will do very well ! but," 
glancing at the piano, " that is not my 
instrument." 

Major Ancram took the hint, and led 
her to a harp in another part of the room ; 
but aware of the advantage to which she 
appeared at this elegant instrument, she 
was in no hurry to commence playing. 

Provoked at what had taken place, 
Miss Liscarrol, after fidgetting about for 
some time, at length losing all patience, 



161 

'demanded whether she meant to play or 
not ? adding, she never knew a perform- 
ance that was worth twice asking for. 

" Oh, when you hear mine, you will 
be of a different opinion !" said Rosalind, 
maliciously laughing. 

Miss Liscarrol turned up her lip.â€” 
" Some people are fortunate in a good 
opinion of themselves," she said. 

" Which is happy for them," retorted 
Rosalind, " as it renders them blind to 
that which others entertain of them." 

" But," said major Ancram, checking 
the involuntary smile which this retort 
had excited, '' it is natural for Miss Lis- 
carrol to be impatient for what she is 
aware will afford her so much pleasure.^' 

" True," cried Rosalind, " and as I like 
to gratify my friends," and she laid an 
emphasis on the word, " I shall not any 
longer delay the pleasure she is so impa- 
tient for." 

Deteraiined not to enter into any com- 
petition with Miss Liscarrol, she sung a 
simple Scotch ballad. Various were the 



162 

efforts that were made to interrupt or mar 
her performance, but they all proved un- 
successful, and major Ancram was en- 
chanted. More, however, by looks than 
words, he testified the delight he expe- 
rienced ; yet, as she was quitting the in- 
strument â€” " Were T to say what I think," 
he cried, " you would deem me extrava- 
gant." 

" Then don't say it," replied Rosalind ; 
" leave it to me to imagine." 

" But do you think you could imagine 
it?" 

'' Yes, all." 

" All !" he repeated, emphatically. 

" Yes, all that commonplace gallantry 
could dictate â€” that I have sang like a Ce- 
cilia, and " 

" Let me conclude the sentence for 
you ?" he cried, warmly. 

" Oh, no ! it is not worth finishing," 
she exclaimed, and bounded away to join 
the dancers with a gentleman who had 
been for some minutes soliciting her hand, 
and might perhaps have felt a little piqued 



163 

and surprised at its not being asked by 
major Ancram, but that she saw he de- 
clined dancing, evidently from a feeling 
of the inconsistency of it with his present 
mourning habit ; and indeed nothing had 
ever seemed to her more revolting to the 
feelings than to see a person in the weeds 
of wo partaking of such an amusement, 
and admired him still more for the deli- 
cacy and feeling it was manifest he pos- 
sessed from this ; she felt delighted, when, 
on the breaking up of the party, he was 
invited, with his friend, to join it, the next 
day, at Monteagle Castle, to dinner. 

His attentions were the same on the 
next as on this. Several parties ensued, 
and at each successive one he was, if pos- 
sible, still more particular than at the 
last; so that she gradually became con- 
firmed in her belief of his being a decided 
admirer. It was a belief that conveyed 
transport to her heart, for never had she 
seen â€” never had she conversed with a being 
who so truly answered every idea she had 
formed of perfection. 



164 

Lord Orielton ceasM to be thought of; 
and how did she rejoice at not having 
yielded to the entreaties of poor dear Mrs. 
Woodburne to remain quietly at Duna- 
more, and there patiently await the arri- 
val of her poor droning relation with his 
snug little fortune, as she pictured him to 
be ! If she had done so, what should she 
not have lost by the circumstance! 

Several days elapsed in this manner, 
when a party was made to view the mag- 
nificent remains of an ancient church on 
an island in a lake in the neighbourhood. 
The earl and countess happened to be en- 
gaged on the day fixed for it, but it was 
decided that Rosalind should be of it, to 
her extreme delight ; there were always 
such opportunities for particular attentions 
in such parties, and for detached conver- 
sations ; and, in short, she quite antici- 
pated with impatience the day for it : but 
it was a day destined to be one of vexa- 
tion to her. The morning or two pre- 
ceding it, she received a letter from An- 
na, informing her that the friend they 



16^ 

had often been speaking of to her, and 
had anticipated with such pleasure intro- 
ducing her to, had at length visited Du- 
namore, but only on his way to her 
neighbourhood ; so that, in a day or two, 
she might expect to see him with a letter 
of introduction from her mother. 

Nothing could possibly have discon- 
certed Rosalind more than this intima- 
tion. She had contrived to learn that 
their relation, who, of course, was the 
person she had no doubt that was now 
meant, though a very good kind of man, 
was the very reverse of what she could 
like to have known as an acquaintance of 
hers ; and the idea of introducing him â€” a 
being so old-fashioned, quizzical, and 
queer in his manners and appearance, 
as he was represented to be, to the 
sneering Liscarrols and the elegant An- 
cram, was absolutely insupportable to her 
imagination. Yet what was to be done ? 
Indebted, as she was, to the Woodburnes, 
for so many kindnesses, how could she 
possibly think of slighting any friend or 



166 

connexion of theirs ? JMerely to receive 
the letter he brought, but take no notice 
of him, would be to a certainty to offend 
them, and cause herself to be stigmatized 
for ingratitude. 

At length, after much deliberation, she 
thought, as she conceived, on an expe- 
dient that would obviate all danger of 
this, and extricate her completely out of 
the dilemma in which she found herself 
It was, when he called, to have him in- 
formed that she had left the castle for an 
uncertain time with some visitors who 
had recently been there, and to confine 
herself within doors for some days till she 
should suppose he had quitted the neigh- 
bourhood ; for, as she could not avoid 
thinking she was his sole inducement to 
it, she concluded, on being told what she 
intended, his stay would not be of very 
long continuance ; yet, with inexpressible 
regret and reluctance, in pursuance of this 
plan, she thought of giving up the de- 
lightful party made for visiting the lake : 
but it could not be helped, and it w^as 



167 

better to endure the vexation which do- 
ing so occasioned her, than the mortifica- 
tion of being compelled to drag such a 
being into company along with her. Lest 
of any mischance, she was obliged to get 
the family at the castle to sanction the 
assertion of her being absent; so that it 
was absolutely imagined in the neighbour- 
hood she had actually left the castle for a 
little time. She explained to the countess 
her motive for wishing to have this 
thought, and she could not help laughing 
on hearing it ; but INIrs. Trelawney sneer- 
ed, and said she gave herself great airs in- 
deed. 

The day after Anna's letter, the expect- 
ed one from her mother was received : it 
was brought by a servant, with a message 
to know when it would be agreeable to 
Miss Glenmorlie to see him. The answer 
she had settled was given, and she heard 
no more of the gentleman. 

On the day of the party to the lake, the 
family at the castle, as already mentioned, 
were engaged from home, and obHged to 



168 

decline going with them ; she passed it in 
a restless, discontented manner. Unable 
longer to endure remaining within, she 
strolled into the park after tea ; and after 
rambling about some time, found herself 
near a rustic building, fitted up for the ac- 
commodation of occasional visitors. She 
was carelessly turning from it when she 
heard her name pronounced, and the next 
instant saw several of the party on which 
her thoughts were employed, coming 
down the steps to meet her, and amongst 
them major Ancram. 

" And pray, fair lady," was the almost- 
general exclamation of those she was most 
intimate with, as she returned with them 
to the building, where, having landed 
near the spot, tea was prepared for them, 
" how is it that we see you here, when 
we thought you had quitted the castle?" 

" Oh, you must not ask !" said Rosa- 
lind, laughing, diverted by the surprise 
beholding her so unexpectedly had occa- 
sioned, and elated by seeing Ancram her- 
self in the same way. 



169 

" Why, is it a secret ?" 

Â«Â« Yes â€” that is, I meant it should be 
so ; but I believe I must explain, in order 
to prevent the danger of what I wish be- 
ing counteracted. The fact is, I only 
pretended I had left the castle, in order 
to avoid an introduction to a person I 
greatly disliked the idea of" 

" Lord, I wonder you would take the 
trouble ! what so easy as to have let them 
know you did not like it ?" 

" Ah ! but then I should have offended 
the kindest friends in the Vvorld. It is 
on their account entirely, not on account 
of the gentleman's feelings, I assure you, 
that 1 wished to avoid letting it be known 
that I had a particular dislike to his ac- 
quaintance." 

" Well, and what kind of being is he, 
that you should have this dislike ?" 

" Oh, hideous ! if he accords with the 
idea I have formed of him in my imagi- 
nation ! yet, notwithstanding, I feel that 
on account of those who wished to have 

VOL. I. I 



170 

introduced him to me, I should not have 
played this trick with respect to him ; 
but " 

She paused, in utter surprise at the dark 
contracting of Ancram's brow at the mo- 
ment. She knew not how it could be 
that what she had been saying could of- 
fend him ; and yet it struck her, that to 
this was owing the sudden alteration in 
his countenance. In confusion and per- 
plexity at the thought, she forgot what 
she had been about adding, and moving 
mechanically to a chair, remained for a 
minute or two without again speaking. 
Then again looking up, and trying to 
rally herself â€” " Why, you seem," she 
cried, addressing him, as he sat a little be- 
hind her, " as if you had left your spirits 
behind you in one of the old cells you 
have been viewing." 

" Really," he replied, but in a tone 
very different from his usual one ; " yes, 
really ; but places of the kind have some- 
times an effect upon the imagination ; yes, 
but, as it happened, I did not take any 



171 

great spirits with me to leave behind ;'* 
and he again sunk into a fit of musing. 

Rosalind felt still more surprised, and 
regarding him earnestly, became still more 
confirmed, from the expression of his 
countenance, when he caught her observ- 
ing him, in her previous idea of having, 
in some way or other, offended him. 

The surmise was so painful, that she 
at length tried to struggle against it, and 
persuade hei-self that she must be mis- 
taken, and that it was nothing but some 
sudden depression that affected him ; and 
reviving at the thought, she exerted all 
her powers of playfulness to rouse and re- 
animate him ; but all would not do ; he 
continued silent, abstracted, and com- 
pletely unlike what he was wont to be. 

At length Rosalind, a little piqued, and 
suddenly recollecting that the family by 
this time might be returned to the castle, 
and that her being missed might create un- 
easiness, starting up, said she must be gone ; 
but her retiring was opposed â€” there were 
some musical instruments in the builds 
I 2 



172 

ing, and the party, intending to have 
some playing and singing, could not think 
of parting with her, but proposed that a 
servant should be sent to quiet any alarm 
that her being absent from the castle 
might have occasioned. 

Ancram listened quietly to the arrange- 
ment; then slowly rising â€” " Permit me 
to be the messenger ?" he said. 

" Oh, no ! why should you take that 
trouble ?" cried Rosalind, with quickness, 
who, though piqued, was still unwilling 
he should not be present when she com- 
menced singing. 

" I wish it," he replied, in a cold con- 
strained tone, and departed. 

Rosalind felt miserable â€” something she 
saw was wrong, but what she knew not ; 
and her ignorance on the subject served 
to render her still more unhappy. She 
tried to play â€” to sing; but she failed in 
each effort, and pleading a sudden head- 
ache, withdrew from the instrument, and 
threw herself on a sofa away from the 
party ; but her eyes were fixed on the 



17B 

door, for notwithstanding the manner in 
which Ancram had departed, she looked 
to see him return ; but minute after mi- 
nute passed away without again bringing 
him, and unable longer to constrain her 
feelings, she suddenly left her seat, and 
took the opportunity of the attention of 
the party being diverted from her at the 
moment to slip away un perceived ; not 
without a hope of encountering Ancram 
by the way, or finding him with the fa- 
mily at the castle, and of something, in 
either case occurring, to remove the un- 
easiness under which she laboured. But 
in both these expectations she was disap- 
pointed, and a restless night, in conse- 
quence, made her rise early in the morn- 
ing, to try whether the air would remove 
the headache that ensued. Involuntarily 
her steps took the direction of the rustic 
building, and on reaching it, though she 
knew not why, she listlessly sauntered into 
it ; but how was she almost electrified into 
animation again by finding Ancram there ! 
â€” " You here !" she exclaimed, in a tone 



174 

indicative of the surprise she experienced 
at seeing him ; " you here !" and suddenly 
becoming conscious of the emotion she 
had betrayed, she blushed, and tried to 
appear composed, by saying something, 
in a rallying accent, of his being an admi- 
rer of the beauties of morning to rise so 
early. 

" Certainly, I am indeed !" was the re- 
ply ; " it was not, however, to admire 
them I rose so early this morning, but to 
prepare for my journey." 

" Journey !" repeated Rosalind ; " what 
journey ? you are not going, sure !" 

" Yes, I am indeed ! the chaise that is 
to convey me hence is at this moment ac- 
tually waiting for me ; and I only de- 
layed setting off to search for a letter 
w^hich I missed this morning, and fancied 
I might have dropped here." 

Only delayed his departure to search 
for a letter â€” not to take leave of her ! and 
had all his attentions come to this ? and 
had he actually meant nothing by them â€” 
nothing but to amuse himself at the ex^ 



175 

pence of her tranquillitiy ! yet this was 
inconsistent with his general character, 
his manner, his sentiments ; and again 
she gave way to the idea of having, in 
some way or other, injured herself in his 
estimation, and the w^orld, if she could, 
she would have given to know how ; but 
this was impossible, at least through her 
own means, and, in inconceivable distress, 
she turned aside to a window to conceal 
the pain she was enduring. As she leaned 
against it, the identical letter major An- 
cram was in search of caught her eye, im- 
mediately beneath it, on the outside ; and 
stooping down, she picked it up. As she 
was presenting it to him, involuntarily 
glancing at the superscription â€” " If I did 
not know," she cried, " that you are un- 
acquainted with him, I should think this 
letter was directed by a friend of mine, 
the gentleman with whom I saw you con- 
versing at Dunamore Abbey." 

" Perhaps you would not err if you 
did," said he, coolly, as he took the letter 
from her. 



176 

Rosalind started. â€” " What ! do you 
know Mr. Woodburne, after all, then ?" 
slie exclahned. 

Ancram bowed. 

" And yet conceal it from me !" she re- 
sentfully cried â€” " conceal it for the pur- 
pose of hearing me betray â€” expose myself 
to you," and she burst into an agony of 
tears. The truth at once striking her, 
that, acquainted with the obligations she 
owed the Woodburnes, the disgust ex- 
cited by the ingratitude her recent con- 
duct evinced towards them, had decided 
him on thinking no more of her. Yes, it 
was evident this was the case ; to this was 
owing the sudden alteration in his man- 
ner â€” the sudden contraction of that brow, 
so open, so benevolent, so indicative, in 
his own heart, of all that was noble and 
generous. Fool ! â€” idiot ! to speak so in- 
cautiously as she did â€” to aver herself cap- 
able of such ingratitude â€” such artifice ; 
but she was punished â€” properly punished 
for it ; she had lost by it the esteem of 
the only man for whom her heart had 



177 

ever yet entertained a preferable regard ; 
and nothing â€” no, nothing, she believed, in 
the first agony imparted by the belief, 
could compensate her for this. 

" I should be concerned," cried major 
Ancram, " if Miss Glenmorlie accused 
me of having any unworthy motive for 
what she has now discovered, or thought 
me capable of turning to her prejudice 
any thing I may have heard in conse- 
quence." 

" Oh no ! I accuse you of nothing of 
the kind," she replied, " or believe you 
capable of any thing ungenerous ; but still 
I cannot but resent â€” cannot but feel hurt, 
that you should have left it to chance for 
me to discover what I have now done." 

" But perhaps it was not my original 
intention," returned Ancram, half-smiling, 
" to leave it to chance, and perhaps I 
only refrained explaining it myself, from a 
hope that the kind friends to whom I left 
mentioning it, might, at the same time, 
prove I was not altogether unworthy of 
those sentiments with which I wished to 
i3 



178 

inspire Miss Glenmorlie. Had she con- 
descended to see me, as I solicited, after 
receiving Mrs. Woodburne's intended let- 
ter of introduction, all this would per- 
haps have been satisfactorily proved to 
her." 

Rosalind started from the sofa on which 
she had flung herself â€” " Mrs. Wood- 
burne's letter of introduction !" she repeat- 
ed ; " what ! was it from you it came ? and 
were you the person â€” you the friend, she 
meant, and not that odious relation of 
hers I have alv/ays been in such dread of 
knowing ?" 

Ancram bowed. 

" And, good God ! why did I not 
know all this before ?" cried Rosalind^ 
passionately ; " and what could be the 
reason for all this mystery and conceal- 
noent ? but it matters not !" she cried, 
turning resentfully away ; " I have been 
excessively ill-used throughout the affair, 
and I resent it accordingly." 

" No [" cried Ancram, warmly, " no ! 
and I am convinced Miss Glenmorlie wiU 



179 

think so herself, when she comes coolly to 
reflect on the matter. There was no un- 
worthy motive for the concealment, and 
that alone could give her a right to say 
she was ill used by it." 

" And what was the motive then for 
it?" demanded Rosalind, turning round 
with quickness on him. 

Ancram coloured, hesitated, attempt- 
ed to explain, and then suddenly became 
silent. 

Rosalind looked earnestly at him, and 
was prevented by his confusion from press- 
ing the question. The truth indeed be- 
came too evident to her to require it to 
be repeated. It seemed evident to her 
that he had taken a fancy to her, the day 
on which he had met her at the abbey; 
and through a romantic whim, wishing 
to get acquainted with her sentiments ere 
he disclosed his own, had got the Wood- 
burnes to aid him in his plan for the pur- 
pose, and a delightful one it would have 
proved but for herself Yes, she alone 
was to blame, she again became convinced. 



180 

Yes, it was she herself alone who had de- 
stroyed the favourable opinion which 
others had inspired him with of her â€” that 
favourable opinion without which she felt 
persuaded he never would have thought 
seriously of her; but was it irretrievable? 
was it so utterly destroyed, that he would 
persevere in his resolution of going ? and 
she involuntarily turned her eyes inquir- 
ingly on him. 

He seemed to understand their lan- 
guage, for approaching her â€” " Miss Glen- 
morlie will not, I hope, let me depart," he 
cried, " without relieving my mind from 
the pain of thinking that any unworthy 
suspicion of me lurks in hers." 

" You are then really departing," cried 
Rosalind, only attending to this illusion. 

" Really." 

Rosalind's lip quivered, and for a mo- 
ment she was obliged to turn aside her 
head. Then, endeavouring to appear un- 
concerned, and anxious to know whether 
he v/as returning to Dunamore. â€” " A fine 
tale you will tell of me," she said, " I sup- 



181 

pose, when you rejoin our friends at Dun- 
amore." 

" Miss Glenmorlie need not fear," he ra- 
ther reproachfully replied, " any tale to 
her prejudice from me. If she is as high- 
ly thought of as I wish her to be, none 
need desire to be more highly estimated. 
But I delay her," he added, purposely, as 
it seemed to her, avoiding touching upon 
what she was so desirous of ascertaining ; 
" and my friend Glenmire, who accom- 
panies me hence, is, I dare say, by this 
time, quite at a loss to know what has be- 
come of me ; and so farewell ! God bless 
you !" and, spite of her efforts to prevent 
him, through pique and resentment at 
his persevering in going, he would take 
her hand. 

Rosalind for a moment struggled to dis- 
engage it ; then utterly overcome, she co- 
vered her eyes with her other hand, and 
gushed into tears ; she felt Ancram press 
the hand he had taken to his lips â€” to his 
heart, whilst broken and murmured sen- 
tences escaped him : he relinquished it. 



182 

Rosalind gasped, and pressing it against 
her breast, as if to subdue the emotions 
that struggled there, uncovered her eyes ; 
but he was gone â€” gone without saying 
whether they should ever meet again ; and 
in agony at the thought, she rushed after 
him to the door, but he was completely 
out of sight ; and retreating into the build- 
ing, she again threw herself almost dis- 
tractedly on the sofa, and again burst into 
tears. 

Yet since he could so coolly, so easily, 
so decidedly, part from her, was he worth 
the pang she felt on his account â€” the re- 
gard, the affection, of a heart so ardent, 
so sensitive, as hers ? No ; and she strove 
to revive â€” to reinspirit herself, at the 
thought ; but had she not provoked what 
she so resented? Yes, too certainly; and 
â€” " Fool, fool !" she passionately exclaim- 
ed at the idea, " to let him depart with- 
out making an effort to vindicate myself 
in his eyes â€” to prove that I was not the 
light, the frivolous being I gave him so 
much reason to imagine." 



183 

Yet how could pride â€” how could deli- 
cacy, have permitted such an effort ? would 
not the motive for it have been evident, 
and would this have been consistent with 
the respect she owed to herself? No; and 
since matters therefore must remain as 
they were, she would not permit him to 
occupy another thought ; but, despite of 
this resolve, several days elapsed without 
her being able for a moment to detach 
them from him; and during which she 
more than once was on the point of ad- 
dressing Anna concerning him ; but the 
detail into which she must enter, the ex- 
planations she must give, to render her- 
self perfectly understood, or rather obtain 
for herself the information she wished for, 
still checked her; for how could she bear 
to acknowledge to the Woodburnes the 
want of sincerity she had manifested in 
her professions of regard for them ? and, 
finally, she decided on silence relative to 
all that had lately passed. 

But though she should be destined ne- 
ver to see major An cram again, she felt 



184 

she should never be able to forbear wish- 
ing to know to what cause or reason was 
owing the Woodburnes not having been 
explicit about him, since, as was now 
proved to be the case, he was the person 
whom, in hinting of, or alluding to a 
friend whom they particularly wished to 
introduce to her, was meant. There was 
a mystery in the circumstance that puz- 
zled and perplexed her; and finding the 
more she dwelt on it, the more it did so, 
she at length tried to detach her thoughts 
from it 

But the sneers of the Miss Liscarrols 
more effectually enabled her to do this 
than any argument she used with herself 
for the purpose ; she had given them every 
reason to imagine she considered Ancram 
as a conquest, and their triumph at the 
mistake into which her insolent vanity had 
led her w^as not to be concealed. 

Rosalind was not of a temper to let 
such an one be quietly enjoyed over her; 
reanimated by it, she quickly recovered 
her wonted vivacity and playfulness of 



185 

manner, and became as captivating as 
ever. 

Lord Orielton again began to be thought 
of; his arrival was now daily expected; 
and how gratifying would it be, she felt, 
to have Ancram informed, through the 
medium of the Woodburnes, of her hav- 
ing achieved such a conquest ! Might not 
the intimation be a means of recalling 
him, and the idea decided her on it, if 
possible. 

Wishing to finish a work that had great- 
ly interested her, she declined going out 
one morning with the countess and her 
mother, and was sitting reading in the 
boudoir of the former, when some one en- 
tered abruptly from the shrubbery into 
which it opened. Rosalind turned to see 
who it v/as, and beheld a very elegant 
young man, whom she at once decided to 
be lord Orielton, from his strong likeness 
to the countess ; nor was she mistaken â€” 
it was indeed lord Orielton she saw, who, 
tired of being pent up for many hours in 
a carriage, alighted at the first gate he 



186 

came to, instead of driving round to the 
grand entrance, and was passing the apart- 
ment just mentioned, when a glimpse of 
Rosalind within it, making him think it 
was his mother he saw, he rushed in, as 
already stated. 

The moment he discovered his mistake, 
he proceeded to apologize for the manner 
in which he had entered, but with looks 
that seemed inquiring who the fair stran- 
ger was he was addressing ; and the flut- 
ter of Rosalind at the unexpected incident 
was heightened by the intenseness of his 
gaze. So conscious was she of the emo- 
tion it occasioned her, that on his ringing 
to know the direction in which the earl 
and countess were gone, she took the op- 
portunity of slipping off to her chamber, 
nor met him again till dinner-time, by 
which time his curiosity respecting her 
was fully satisfied ; but she soon became 
convinced that curiosity was not the only 
feeling with which she had inspired him, 
and the conviction had the effect of ren- 
dering her still more attractive. The re- 



187 

suit of this soori became obvious, render- 
ing the countess fully sensible of the im- 
prudence she had been guilty of, in throw- 
ing such a creature in his way. 

Lovely as was Rosalind, and well-connec- 
ted, yet neither she nor the earl could think 
of sanctioning their son's attachment for 
her, from the still more ambitious views 
they entertained for him. Heir to an an- 
cient title and immense possessions, they 
could not think of allowing him to form 
an alliance less illustrious than he was en- 
titled to from these circumstances, and 
accordingly decided, the moment they be- 
came sensible of their hopes respecting 
this being likely to be endangered, on 
sending Rosalind away. A hint to a friend 
at a distance occasioned an invitation to 
lord Orielton, which he knew not how to 
refuse, though most reluctant to accept, 
from his unwillingness to quit his fair en- 
slaver; and the moment almost he was 
gone, the countess signified to Rosalind, 
that the family being under a necessity of 
returning to P^ngland much sooner tlian 



188 

they had at first intended, she could not 
ask her to protract her visit. 

Raised as she had her expectations of 
taking her over with her, the dismay and 
astonishment of Rosalind at this intima- 
tion were unutterable. The disappoint- 
ment it inflicted fell like something chill- 
ing on her heart, and tears â€” tears of bitter 
mortification, burst from her, despite of 
the efforts of pride to restrain them â€” tears 
that so distressed and embarrassed the 
countess, from the consciousness of what 
they were owing to, as to make her has- 
tily retire from the apartment. 

To endeavour to make amends for the 
disappointment she had inflicted, she load- 
ed her with costly presents, and with fond 
caresses mingled the kindest assurances 
of regard ; but nothing could appease the 
resentment of Rosalind ; with difficulty 
she forbore repulsing those caresses, and 
spurning these presents ; nothing prevent- 
ed her but the reflection of the injury 
she might do herself with lord Orielton, 
by offending his mother. 



189 

Angry as she was, however, with the 
countess, she still felt persuaded she had 
an affection for her â€” a persuasion that led 
her to believe, if left to her own feelings, 
she would not have acted in this manner. 
To the influence of Mrs. Trelawney she 
imputed her doing so, and the idea did 
not tend to lessen her previous dislike to 
that lady. 

The countess intended sending her wo- 
man with her, but relinquished the inten- 
tion, in consequence of her being offered 
a seat in the carriage of a family that were 
going to Waterton, to embark thence for 
England, and who kindly offered to send 
her the remainder of her journey. 

On a lovely evening in June she found 
herself again at home, where all around 
was now smiling in summer beauty. The 
bright blush of the evening sky was re- 
flected in the sparkling waves â€” the fields 
were again bespread with flowers, and gay 
groups of visitants to the place were scat- 
tered about in various directions ; but no- 
thing could cheer or console Rosahnd for 



190 

the disappointment she had sustained; 
the nearer she drew to the end of her 
journey, the heavier became her heart. 
After the expectations she had indulged 
in â€” the predictions that were uttered, 
how mortifying to return as she had gone ! 
how malicious would be the sneers ! how 
great the triumph of those who had en- 
vied her the invitation of the countess, at 
the circumstance! to return too without 
any positive certainty of ever being in- 
troduced into fashionable life again ! for if 
her father failed in his lawsuit, there was 
now but little hope of this ; and her an- 
guish at the thought was augmented by 
the heightened disgust and abhorrence 
with which she now thought of a frugal 
and retired life. 

Every thing now seemed mean and in- 
significant, compared with what she had 
left behind her ; and in an agony of bitter 
tears, at the thought that still what she so 
much despised she might be doomed to 
endure for ever, she fell into her mother's 
arms. At first JNIrs. Glenmorlie imputed 



191 

these tears to joy at finding herself again 
at home, but she soon discovered her mis- 
take ; the seeming unconsciousness with 
which RosaHnd received her caresses, the 
petulance with which she interrupted her 
details of the little incidents that had oc- 
curred during her absence, and the dis- 
satisfaction and disgust with which she 
looked around her â€” all soon tended to con- 
vince her of her error, and the conviction 
gave a pang of the severest nature to her 
maternal heart. 

But the disappointment experienced by 
Rosalind was not entirely confined to her 
own bosom ; colonel and Mrs. Glenmorlie 
also felt disappointed and surprised, after 
the professions the countess had made, at 
her being sent back in the hasty manner 
she was : too liberal, too rational, however, 
to resent vv^ithout a conviction of having 
cause, they proceeded to inquiries, and, by 
dint of interrogation, at length began to 
ascertain the truth. 

Colonel Glenmorlie could not help feel- 
ing hurt, greatly hurt, at the idea of his 



192 

alliance being disdained; still, however, 
when he reflected on the great expecta- 
tions the earl and countess had a right to 
entertain for their son, he could not won- 
der at their not voluntarily relinquishing 
them ; and what he could not wonder at, 
he could not be offended at. 

His wife thought as he did; but not soRo- 
salind herself At the idea of being deemed 
unworthy of the addresses of lord Orielton, 
her haughty soul took fire, and whatever 
partiality she had conceived for the family 
became almost converted into hatred. 
Alike she inveighed against them all, pro- 
testing they were all alike base, fickle, and 
insincere; and that whilst she lived, she 
should regret her introduction to them ; 
and in asserting this, she asserted but what 
she thought at the moment, imputing, as 
she did, to that circumstance, her loss of 
Ancram â€” yes, it was on his account Mrs. 
Woodburne had warned her against ac- 
cepting their invitation â€” had conjured her 
to remain at home ; but she would not at- 
tend to her â€” she laughed at â€” she derided 



193 

the effort that was made to detain her ; 
and how, in her very innermost soul, did 
she now regret having done so ! 

Her first inquiry on reaching home was 
after the Woodburnes, and her feehngs of 
discontent were not lessened on learning, 
a day or two previous to her arrival, they 
had left home on a visit to a friend, with 
whom they were in the habit of often pass- 
ing a month or two during summer. Had 
they remained, her curiosity, at least, if 
not anxiety, about Ancram, might have 
been satisfied. It would have been scarce- 
ly possible, she thought, for them to have 
avoided saying something about him, and 
the mystery concerning him might gra- 
dually have been revealed. Yet of what 
consequence to her now to have it ex- 
plained, or listen to any particulars about 
him, convinced, as she was, of his having 
ceased to think of her, from never having 
heard any thing concerning him since his 
leaving the neighbourhood of Monteagle 
Castle? Had he continued to do so, he cer- 

VOL. I. K 



194 

tainly would have contrived to have given 
her some intimation of this through the 
Woodburnes. 

A little soothing and indulgence was all 
that was requisite, Mrs. Glenmorlie fondly 
flattered herself, to bring her back to her 
former temper and habits ; but day after 
day elapsed without effecting this, and at 
length she decided on remonstrating with 
her on the subject, conceiving she should 
ill fulfil the duty of a parent, if she allow- 
ed her to waste her time in murmurs and 
repinings. 

At the very first allusion to this, Rosa- 
lind wrung her hands in wrathful agony. 
" What !" she exclaimed, bursting into 
tears of passion, " is it not enough that 
1 am compelled to live in this odious place, 
and associate with those I despise, but 
that I must also be obliged to submit to 
the drudgery of matters I detest ?" 

Mrs. Glenmorlie clasped her hands, and 
looked up to heaven â€” " Good God !" she 
exclaimed, turning of a deadly paleness, 
" have I then lost my child ? Oh ! how 



195 

true is the observation, that we little know 
what will be productive of happiness to us ! 
How delighted was I at your invitation 
to Monteagle Castle, and yet how bitterly 
do I now regret the circumstance! Yet, 
was your affection for your father and m^ 
what I fondly assured myself it was, not 
so immediately could your feelings be al- 
tered, or your regard alienated from the 
home they occupy. Unhappy girl ! how 
many wretched beings would prostrate 
themselves in gratitude to Heaven for such 
a home as that you now detest and scorn ! 
May you never know what it is to feel the 
want of such an one ! But, alas ! Heaven 
often punishes our discontent, by rendering 
us blind to the blessings in our possession 
till deprived of them. With what min- 
gled horror and amazement may you yet 
recall this moment, and revert to the ex- 
pressions that have at once shocked and 
amazed me !" 

The natural affections, the warm feel- 
ings of Rosalind, unsubdued, unmoved 
K 2

she could not behold the tears she had oc- 
casioned her mother â€” unrepentant witness 
the agony into which she had thrown her. 
Shocked, confounded, she stood for a mo- 
ment as if transfixed ; then flinging herself 
at the feet of her mother, with bursting 
tears she implored her forgiveness for the 
pain she had given her, assuring her, if 
she but gave her the consolation of saying 
she had no doubt of her affection for her 
or her father, she would strain every nerve 
to be again all she wished. 

Clasping her to her bosom, the fond 
mother readily granted what she required ; 
but how readily do we forgive where w^e 
love, and yield to a belief essential to our 
happiness ! â€” " No â€” I could not desire to 
live, if I did not think I was loved by 
those I love," said Mrs. Glenmorlie; "ex- 
istence is only valuable to me, as I think 
I am regarded by them; and now, my 
dear child, let the past be forgotten ; I am 
not altogether surprised that the disap- 
pointment you met with should have been 
felt; yet so often does imagination out- 



197 

strip reality, or rather so seldom does the 
latter come up with the former, that the 
infliction of it perhaps has only saved you 
from a greater one. However, were you 
even sure that would not have been the 
case, it is childish to regret what is not 
attainable â€” worse indeed if we reflect on 
the real sorrows and calamities of this life. 
How trifling would your case of sorrow 
appear to the mourners caused by that 
treacherous element, last winter, that now 
so beautifully reflects the vivid dyes of 
heaven ! The bereaved orphan, the lonely 
widow, the childless mother, the thou- 
sands and thousands of wretches, that are 
literally compelled 

* To pick their wintry faggot from the thorn, 
To seek their nightly shed, and weep till morn.* 

Nay, do not seem impatient. I know we 
cannot always argue in this manner ; that 
when vexed, it is impossible not sometimes 
to shew it : but then we should stru<xffle, 
as much as possible, to obtain a command 
over ourselves ; and in ceasing to think of 
your recent disappointment, I must also 



198 

beg you will cease railing against the 
Monteagle family â€” to rail against them is 
a base requital for their generous and un- 
sought friendship to your father." 

" Well, I am sorry I said any thing a- 
gainst them," said Rosalind, " that is, with 
the exception of Mrs. Trelawney â€” nasty, 
spiteful, old creature ! I am sure it was 
entirely owing to her that lady Monteagle 
gave up taking me over with her to 
England. I saw she was jealous of me, 
from the moment I entered the house â€” 
an abominable woman ! she is as spiteful 
as an old maid, and as fond of gambling 
as a black-legs. I am sure, if Pam 
could ask her, she would marry him, for 
the sake of always having him in her pos- 
session, and that she would rather leave 
her chamber without saying her prayers 
than without rouge. I shall hate her as 
long as I live." 

" No, no !" cried her mother, " Heaven 
forbid you were capable of that ! But let 
me entreat you never to make use of that 
expression again. I hate the word hate. 



199 

from the rancorous feelings it gives an idea 
of; from the lips of a young person, in 
particular, it is revolting, as they at least, 
inexperienced in the frauds, and deceits, 
and villanies of mankind, should be in 
amity with all." 

Rosalind listened patiently to this lec- 
ture, but was not, in reality, much bene- 
fited by it. She was grieved, it is true, 
at having pained her mother, and per- 
suaded to think it ungrateful to speak far- 
ther against the countess : but utterly to 
subdue the feelings occasioned by her dis- 
appointment was impossible, or to think 
with complacency of her imagined enemy, 
IVIrs. Trelawney. 

The rankling feelings that still found 
harbour in her breast, were not lessened 
by the invidious triumph she conceived 
enjoyed at her expence : on every counte- 
nance she thought she perceived a sneer, 
and discovered exultation in every voice 
at her coming back so suddenly and un- 
engaged ; and again and again she regret- 



200 

ted ever having accepted the invitation to 
Monteagle Castle. 

She could not envy Anna â€” no, she 
loved her too sincerely for that ; yet even 
what she heard about her since her return 
augmented what she felt at the disappoint- 
ment of her own expectations. The fame 
of her own charms had extended beyond 
Waterton, and sir William Le Fleming, 
a young baronet residing in the neighbour- 
hood of that town, and but lately return- 
ed from the Continent, came expressly to 
a ball at Dunamore for the purpose of 
seeing her. 

The party with whom he came knew 
nothing of her absence from it till after 
their arrival. In the course of the even- 
ing some of them took an opportunity of 
inquiring from him how he bore his dis- 
appointment relative to seeing the beauty 
of the place ? 

" Disappointment !" he repeated, " why, 
surely I have not been disappointed of see- 
ing her," and his eye involuntarily glanced 



201 

at Anna, who happened to be there that 
evening, attired with her usual simplicity, 
and indebted to nothing but her natural 
advantages for admiration. Each eye fol- 
lowed the direction of his, and charms 
which had not before been seen in her, 
perhaps were now discovered through the 
admiration he avowed. 

The moment he entered the room, her 
appearance had struck him ; and conceiv- 
ing she must be the beauty of whom he 
had heard so much, he waited not for the 
ceremony of introduction to solicit her 
hand. Her unaffected manner, and style 
of conversation, did not lessen the admi- 
ration her appearance had excited; and 
when he discovered his mistake concern- 
ing her, his heart felt he could desire to 
see nothing more lovely. He resumed 
the seat beside her, which for a moment 
he had vacated â€” engaged her for another 
set â€” continued wandering about, the next 
morning, till he encountered her and her 
father going down to the strand to walk â€” 
K 3 



202 

irnrhediately joined them, returned with 
them to the cottage, and from that mo- 
ment seemed to consider himself as an ae- 
kridwledged acquaintance. 

Anna could not be altogether blind to 
the sentiments she had inspired, but she 
had none of the ridiculous vanity that 
would have led her to boast of what she 
thought ; she knew it was very possible 
for a person to admire without being seri- 
ous, and besides, she had not yet suffici- 
ently examined her heart to know whe- 
ther, if he really v/ere so, she could bring 
herself to give encouragement to sir Wil- 
liam. But on both these points &he was 
soon out of suspense â€” sir William no 
sooner heard of her intended departure 
from Dunamore with her parents, than he 
declared himself; and, through the repre- 
sentations of her father, she was induced 
to give a conditional promise to become 
his, if, upon a further knowledge of each 
other's disposition and sentiments, it was 
found they sufficiently agreed to let them 
hope for happiness ih an union. 



S03 

And this conquest might have been 
hers, Rosalind reflected, had she remained 
at home; for, attractive as was Anna, yet 
beside her, what chance would she have 
had of it ? So vanity whispered ; and yet 
she by no means envied her it â€” on the 
contrary, she rejoiced at her good fortune : 
but still she could not avoid feeling an 
unpleasant sensation at the idea of her 
having got the start of her, with regard 
to an establishment in life, so compara- 
tively little as she fancied she had been 
thought of when compared with her. Yet 
she felt it would have been ungenerous to 
have wished to have made a conquest of 
sir William, feeling almost persuaded, as 
she did, that she would have rejected him ; 
and yet it would have been so gratifying to 
her vanity and her pride to have had it 
known that she had the power of rejecting 
such a suitor â€” yes, that was what she ex 
actly wanted; and it stung her to the soul 
to think that she had not yet been able to 
boast of one absolutely-decided conquest 
or splendid offer. 



204 



CHAPTER VIII. 



While she was indulging the idle regrets 
of vanity on this account, lord Orielton 
returned to Monteagle Castle; and finding 
her gone, the pang he felt at the circum- 
stance rendered him even more sensible 
than he had been before of the sentiments 
with which she had inspired him. A sus- 
picion of the fact soon occurred â€” he quick- 
ly discovered that artifice had been had 
recourse to, to separate them, and, indig- 
nant at the discovery, abruptly quitted 
the castle, and proceeded forthwith to 
Dunamore, without exactly saying whi- 
ther he was going. 

His unexpected visit to it extremely dis- 
concerted colonel and Mrs. Glenmorlie, 
more especially as they speedily ascertained 
its being without the concurrence of his fa- 
mily. However, the former soon decided 



205 

how to act ; should the reserve of his man- 
ner not succeed in inducing his lordship 
to shorten this, he decided on acquainting 
the earl with it, and, in the meantime, on 
taking care to prevent any particular com- 
munication between him and Rosalind. 
To do this, however, required all the ad- 
dress he was master of; so intent was the 
young lover on obtaining an opportunity 
for declaring himself^ and so well inclined 
was the lady to afford it to him. He could 
not help being hurt by the coldness with 
which he was treated, both by the colonel 
and Mrs. Glenmorlie; still he could not 
bring himself to quit the place. 

In pursuance of his determination, there- 
fore, when the former found day after day 
elapse without his giving any intimation 
of his having an intention to do so, he 
took him to task on the subject, plainly 
informing him, that if he delayed his de- 
parture much longer, he should certainly 
apprise the earl of his visit to the place, 
lest otherwise he should himself be un- 
worthily suspected of what he was incap- 



206 

able of. â€” " Aware of the sentiments of 
the earl your father, my lord," he proudly 
said, " neither pride, nor honour, nor the 
sense of obligation I owe him, will permit 
me to sanction those you entertain for my 
daughter. Never, with my consent, shall 
she enter a family that do not, in every 
respect, think her worthy of their alliance; 
if, therefore, you linger here, you will not 
only compel me to send her hence, but 
force me to do what may be the means of 
creating a difference between you and 
your father. Be advised, therefore, and 
give np a pursuit that must prove un- 
availing." 

Lord Orielton, after some exertion of 
his eloquence, finding neither arguments 
nor persuasions of avail with him, at length 
seemed to acquiesce in those he had used 
with himself; and taking a formal leave of 
the family, left Dunamore ; but he only 
left it in the morning to return to it at 
night, to lodgings provided for him by his 
valet. Here he remained concealed for 
several days, when, becoming convinced 



207 

there was but little chance of obtaining 
the opportunity he wished for of speaking 
to Rosalind without letting her know he 
was there, he decided on endeavouring to 
do so. He durst not venture to write, 
lest of the letter falling into the hands of 
her father ; but he knew the part of the 
house she immediately occupied, from her 
having one day, in the garden, pointed out 
to him a beautiful shrub that clustered 
round the windows ; and could he gain ac- 
cess to the garden at night, he conceived 
he might be able to contrive some expedient 
for letting her know what he wished. 

The colonel's house was built on the 
brow of a hill, and the garden descended 
in terraces to a kind of Gothic building, 
opening to fields extending to the very 
edge of the Qliffs. Up these lord Oriel- 
ton made his way to the fields, and through 
them approached the garden ; but the 
night unluckily happening to be dark, 
and neither moon nor stars, though prob- 
ably invoked to do so, choosing to un- 
muffle themselves, he mistook the garden 



Â£08 

of lady Dundrum, which indeed exter- 
nally seemed to form part of it, for the 
one he meant to enter; and in making 
his way into it, alarmed a dog, which she 
had as an out-centinel. At his first bark 
her ladyship, whose head, when on the 
pillow, never ceased running on White 
Boys, Shanavats, and Caravats, and such 
like desperadoes, took the alarm, and rous- 
ing her man Pat, called out to him to fire, 
and cry murder. 

Pat obeyed, and her next-door neigh- 
bours being awakened â€” " What is the 
matter, Pat?" demanded the colonel, as 
he flung up the sash of his chamber. 

" Faith and troth, I don't know, sir," 
Pat very leisurely replied. " I only know 
my mistress called to me to fire and cry 
murder, but for what I can't tell." 

" Oh, my dear colonel ! I will tell you 
myself," exclaimed her ladyship, thrust- 
ing herself out of the window as far as she 
could venture â€” " I will tell you myself â€” 
there has been a most terrible attack me- 
ditated to-night, and so I beg that you 



209 

and your men will fire away, without de- 
lay, all the blunderbusses and pistols you 
have in the house." 

" But are you sure, my dear madam,'* 
asked the colonel, a little hesitatingly, in 
consequence of having often before been 
disturbed by mere fancies of her ladyship's, 
" that you had no unpleasant dream ?" 

" Oh, no, my dear colonel ! I myself 
saw one of the gang, that I am sure con- 
sists at least of twenty, making his w^ay 
back again over the hedge into the fields ; 
and Heaven knows but what the rest may 
be lurking amongst these bushes and trees 
here ; so fire, my dear colonel â€” fire, I im- 
plore!" 

" Suppose, my dear madam, we first 
reconnoitered ?" and withdrawing from 
the window, he slipped on his night-gown, 
and forthwith proceeded to do so. 

As he was searching about, the Hght in 
lady Dundrum's window permitted him 
to see something glistening on the ground; 
he took it up, and bringing it close to the 
eandle, perceived it was a ring of lord 



210 

Orielton's, which he had remarked on his 
finger as a very fine antique. The whole 
affair was now explained â€” his lordship 
had deceived him, and, of course, any fur- 
ther search was unnecessary. 

Having quieted the alarm of lady Dun- 
drum, he went back, and found his wife 
and daughter anxiously watching for him. 
Involuntarily, as he entered, he darted an 
angry glance at the latter â€” why she could 
not tell, and was musing on the circum- 
stance in her way back to her chamber, 
when, the parlour-door remaining open, 
into which her father had gone with her 
mother, she heard sufficient to explain the 
cause, and fill her mind with ecstacy. 

The next day was spent by the colonel 
in trying to find out the Romeo of the 
preceding night; but in vain, through the 
precautions the enamoured Orielton had 
taken. Vexed and irritated, the colonel 
returned home, yet not without a hope 
that the disappointment he had experi- 
enced in his project for speaking with Ro- 
salind might have had the effect of in- 



211 

ducing him to depart : till perfectly satis- 
fied on this head, however, he deemed it 
the wisest way to say nothing on the sub- 
ject to Rosalind, lest if not, as he hoped, 
her knowledge of it might lead to the de- 
feat of all his precautions. 

In the meantime, flattered by the per- 
severing attachment of lord Orielton, Ro- 
salind determined it should not be her 
fault if he languished in vain for a meet- 
ing. While her father was employed in 
endeavouring to discover where he had se- 
creted himself, she went out, and persuad- 
ed, if still in the place, he would be on 
the alert to speak to her, bent her steps to 
a spot where, should he follow, their con- 
versation would not be liable to interrup- 
tion. She was not wrong in what she 
thought â€” lord Orielton had a spy upon 
her movements, and no sooner learnt whi- 
ther she was gone, than he speedily fol- 
lowed. 

Meeting succeeded meeting, and, all 
hope respecting Ancram lost, Rosalind, 
though sighingly, reluctantly, was almost 



brought to consent to an elopement, when 
the unexpected interference of her father 
prevented the step. For a few days, own- 
ing to his having no suspicion of her 
knowing any thing about the trick lord 
Orielton had played him, he had not 
minded missing her of an evening; but 
when at length he found she could not sa- 
tisfactorily account for the circumstance, 
he determined to watch her, and, in con- 
sequence, surprised her and lord Orielton 
walking together beneath the cliffs. 

His indignation at the circumstance 
was too clearly evinced by his looks, to 
render any other demonstration of it ne- 
cessary ; a silent one of it, however, was 
not sufficient for him â€” " After this, my 
lord," he cried, as he seized the arm of the 
affrighted Rosalind, who stood in an awe 
of him that made her tremble at the idea 
of having incurred his displeasure â€” " after 
this, there is an end of all further forbear- 
ance concerning you. I wished to avoid 
the risk of creating domestic unhappiness; 
but consideration for myself will not any 



213 

longer permit me to be influenced by this ; 
and as to this imprudent girl, should she 
any longer, in utter forgetfulness of what 
she owes to herself, attempt acting in op- 
position to my wishes and commands, she 
will find that in ceasing to remember the 
duty of a child, I also have ceased to feel 
the affection of a father." 

The letter he immediately dispatched 
to INlonteagle Castle occasioned a peremp- 
tory one for the immediate return thither 
of lord Orielton. Ere its arrival, however, 
he had made up his mind to this, for the 
purpose of following up the colonel's in- 
vidious statement, as he termed it, by a 
full explanation of his sentiments respect- 
ing Rosalind. It failed, however, of pro- 
ducing the effect he had hoped ; and the 
agitation and vexation of his mind, unused 
as he was to contradiction or opposition of 
any kind, united to fatigue, brought on 
an illness that shortly assumed a danger- 
ous appearance. 

In terror at the circumstance, his pa- 
rents began to repent their inflexibility to 



214 

his wishes ; the world had nothing to 
offer them in compensation for his loss ; 
and, at length, yielding to their apprehen- 
sions, they implicitly declared he should 
meet with no further opposition from 
them. 

Whether the assurance had any salutary 
effect, or whether he might not have re- 
covered without it, matters not; suffice 
it, he shortly afterwards got better; and 
as soon as he was in a state of convales- 
cence, the earl wrote to colonel Glenmor- 
lie, to acquaint him with what had passed, 
and express his hope, that his first hesita- 
tion about the marriage would not now 
operate to the disadvantage of his son. 

Colonel Glenmorlie had certainly been 
greatly hurt by this ; his resentment, how- 
ever, was not sufficiently powerful to in- 
duce him to reject the overture now made 
â€” a match so every way flattering to his 
pride and ambition, and consonant, as he 
had every reason to imagine, to the wishes 
of his daughter, he could not bring him- 
self to decline ; and, accordingly, an an- 



215 

swer every way agreeable and satisfactory 
was returned. 

Matters were soon arranged â€” as the re- 
quisite settlements prevented lord Oriel- 
ton from marrying till he was of age, of 
which he still wanted a few months, ad- 
vantage was taken of the circumstance to 
request that nothing might at present be 
said of the affair, till the earl had himself 
broke it to a family with whom he had 
entered into a matrimonial engagement 
for him. The colonel made no objection 
to the proposition ; and after passing a 
few days together, midway between their 
respective residences, they separated, the 
earl to proceed to England, and the colo- 
nel to return to Dunamore. 



216 



CHAPTER IX. 



**:Â»^**t 



The ardent wish of Rosalind was now 
accomplished â€” she would soon be allowed 
to boast of a noble conquest ; but the con- 
viction imparted not the happiness she had 
expected ; her fate irrevocably decided, as 
she believed, she recoiled, with something 
of horror, from the thought. Ideas re- 
curred â€” an image was recalled, that ren- 
dered her wretched ^at the contemplation, 
and made her wish â€” vainly wish, that she 
had not suffered herself to be engaged, 
without giving herself time for further 
consideration. Yet, after the encourage- 
ment she had given lord Orielton, getting 
herself so entangled as she had done 
through pride and coquetry, how could 
she have drawn back, after the consent of 
his family was obtained to their union ? 
No, it was impossible ; and for what she 



^17 

suffered she had herself alone to blame. 
Suffered ! and was it really possible, with 
such brilliant prospects as now lay before 
her (her pride, her vanity, her ambition, 
satisfied), that she did suffer any pain or 
unhappiness â€” experienced any thing but 
pleasure and delight ? Her sighing heart 
could not answer the interrogation ; and 
with equal surprise and pain, her mother 
saw the colour fading from her cheek, and 
a general languor pervading her frame. 

At the other side of Dunamore Abbey, 
about two miles from it, was another ro- 
mantic bathing-place called Covetown. 
The station for the packets between Wa- 
terton and England, and extremely beau- 
tiful and picturesque in its situation, it 
had gradually become a very formidable 
rival to Dunamore ; while that was the 
resort chiefly of invalids, or families from 
the adjacent counties, this was the favou- 
rite and fashionable one of the gentry of 
Waterton, who, between cards, balls, pub^ 
lie breakfasts, and excursions about the 

VOL. I. L 



harbour, found means very agreeably to 
pass their time. 

Just at this time, some friends of lady 
Dundrum's, who had taken a cottage 
here for the season, being obliged to quit 
it sooner than they had expected, made 
her an offer of it for the remainder of the 
time they had taken it for â€” an offer which 
she most delightedly accepted, from the 
superior gaiety and fashion of the place 
to Dunamore, and invited Kosalind to 
accom.pany her. The invitation was ac- 
cepted â€” B^osalind was anxious to escape 
from observation at home, and her mother 
wished her to be compelled to make exer- 
tions for shaking off the languor that 
seemed oppressing her. 

On returning from Monteagle Castle, 
Rosalind learnt that lord Dunamore was 
at the abbey, and had made an overture 
for the acquaintance of her family, but 
which had been coldly and haughtily de- 
clined by her father, in consequence of 
his having discovered that he had previ- 
ously been in the neighbourhood ; and im- 



219 

puting it therefore not to any considera- 
tion of their relationship, but entirely to 
the report that was by this time in circu- 
lation of a change being about taking 
place in his circumstances. 

If his lordship was sincere in the wish 
he had now expressed, why, he argued, 
not have taken the opportunity of his first 
visit to the place to intimate it ? But no ; 
he then looked upon him as a needy, dis- 
tressed man, one whom the hand of fate 
had pressed down, never to rise again ; and 
had he not since been led to regard him 
in a different light, he never would have 
intimated what he did ; and what, there- 
fore, originated in feelings he despised, 
he scorned and rejected. Yet, in believ- 
ing what he did, there were many that, 
from the general character of lord Duna- 
more, would have thought him guilty of 
injustice ; but colonel Glenmorlie was vi- 
olently prejudiced against hinj, from the 
family to whom he belonged. The inju- 
ries his mother, his sister, himself, had 
l2 



220 

sustained from lord Ambresbury, had 
never been effaced from his mind ; and 
the rankling recollection he retained of 
them made him think with dislike, al- 
most amounting to aversion, of all con- 
nected with him, and feel even a degree 
of pleasure in having such an opportunity 
or pretext as the present for evincing this 
dislike. 

Neither he nor Mrs. Glenmorlie had 
seen the earl ; those that had, represented 
him as extremely handsome and interest- 
ing ; and much regret was evinced in the 
neighbourhood at the little probability 
there was, from his professional duties, of 
his remaining long at the abbey. 

Rosalind, from what she heard, could 
not avoid a little curiosity to see him : 
her wish for this, she made no doubt, 
would soon be gratified at Covetown : but 
she soon learned, that, though he did not 
altogether decline the private parties that 
were made for him, he hardly ever mixed 
in the amusements of the place, but chief- 
ly devoted his time to examining into the 



221 

condition of his tenantry, and seeing what 
could be done for the redress of such 
mevances as came under his observation 
ere his return to England. 

Rosalind wondered, should they meet, 
would he notice her? But noâ€” she conclud- 
ed not, from what had occurred respecting 
her father ; and sometimes she felt a slight 
sensation of regret at the thought, so un- 
consciously had a feeling of esteem and 
admiration been inspired by what she 
heard concerning him. 

Anxious to fly from thought, she en- 
tered with avidity into all the gaieties and 
dissipations of the place, and quickly re- 
covering her vivacity, became the belle of 
Co veto wn, as she was of Dunamore. 

She had been some days at the former 
when a party was made to visit the ab- 
bey, in which she and lady Dundrum 
were included ; and although both had 
seen it before, both were very well pleas- 
ed to see it again ; Rosalind, from the 
delight she took in the contemplation of 
its ancient grandeur ; and lady Dundrum, 



22^ 

from going wherever there was a chance 
of any amusement. 

After a slight survey of the grounds, 
the party proceeded to view the interior 
of the building. In the last of the state 
apartments they stopped. â€” " And pray, 
Mrs. Housekeeper," demanded one of 
them, a gentleman of the name of Mars- 
den, " is there no chance of your lord 
quitting the army, getting married, and 
coming to settle here ?" 

" Indeed I don't know, sir," was the 
reply, " but I rather believe not." 

" Why, young, and rich, and hand- 
some, as he is, he does not mean to follow 
the example of his predecessors here, I 
hope, by devoting himself to a life of ce- 
libacy." 

Â« ;No â€” I hope not, sir ; that would be a 
pity indeed !" 

" But that's true," resumed ]Mr. Mars- 
den ; " I wanted to ask you whether there 
was any truth in the whisper I heard of a 
marriage certainly having been in agita- 
tion some time ago, from apartments hav- 



223 

ing been fitted up for the immediate use 
of a lady here ?" 

Mrs. Sagely looked confused, and hesi- 
tated to reply ; but at length, pressed to 
do so by the curiosity excited by what 
Mr. Marsden had said, acknowledged 
that she believed there was some truth in 
what he had heard ; for that certainly such 
apartments as he alluded to had been 
fitted up in the abbey, but which were 
now shut up, with a positive command 
that they should neither be shewn or 
mentioned to any one. 

" But to us you will shew them," was 
the general exclamation, " and depend 
upon our silence â€” our secrecy." 

Mrs. Sagely hesitated however: she 
pleaded the positive injunction of her lord, 
and the irreparable injury she might do 
herself, was it discovered that she had dis- 
obeyed it ; but her wish to oblige render- 
ed her unable to persevere in refusing 
what was asked, and, though reluctantly, 
she led the way to the prohibited apart- 
ments. 



224 

They formed a suite of three : the first, 
a dressing-room ; the second, a work- 
room ; and the third, a library, opening 
to a garden ; and in their respective deco- 
rations, taste and magnificence were in- 
deed blended. 

The dressing-room was hung with pearl- 
coloured paper, edged with a deep border 
of natural flowers, here and there stray- 
ing into wreaths. The toilet stood be- 
tween two immense windows, with dra- 
peries of rose-coloured silk. At either 
side of the table was a statue of a nymph, 
presenting a basket of fillagree gold, filled 
with all kinds of costly perfumes ; and op- 
posite was a deep recess, elevated by a 
few steps above the apartment, and with 
rich draperies, corresponding with those 
of the windows, hanging about it, to be 
dropped at pleasure, so as to form a luxuri- 
ous boudoir. The room besides contain- 
ed several fine paintings of the Italian 
school, the most conspicuous of which 
were the Graces attiring Venus, and Juno 
borrowing the cestus from her. 



225 

The work-room, furnished with what- 
ever was requisite for fancy-works of all 
descriptions, was farther enriched with 
cabinets of gems, shells, and minerals, and 
likewise ornamented with some fine paint- 
ings. 

The library w^as of an octagon form, 
something resembling an oratory. The 
books were arranged in deep Gothic 
niches, shut in by doors of wrought brass; 
hence a flight of steps led to the garden 
immediately attached to these apartments. 
A Gothic greenhouse enclosed it at one 
side, and on the other it was shut in by 
a thick shrubbery. None but the choicest 
flowers were cultivated here, and such as 
were admitted were chiefly reared on al- 
tars of green turf, disposed round a foun- 
tain in the centre, where a Naiad was re- 
presented leaning against an overturned 
urn. A pile of rocks, at the bottom of 
the garden, suggested the idea of a bath 
within them, on the plan of the caves con- 
structed in former times in Greece for the 
l3 



226 

nymphs, when the idea of nympholepsy 
prevailed there, their deep excavations 
forming natural reservoirs for water; whilst 
a mysterious gloom pervaded each recess, 
and creeping plants and flowers were nou- 
rished all around by the irriguous soil ; a 
naiTow opening near the summit gave ad- 
mission to the place, exactly opposite to 
which, on a tablet of the rock, was en- 
graven â€” 

Tiirice happy they, who on the sunless side 
Of a romantic mountain, forest-crown'd, 
Beneath the whole collected fclvade recline, 
Or in the gelid caverns, woodbine-wrougiit, 
And fresh-bedevv'd with ever-sportliig slrean^i. 
Sit coolly calm. 

Hence a descent of narrow stairs led to a 
broad fountain, in a grotto of circular 
form, bedecked with shells and sparry 
icicles, and gloomily opening by a wide 
arch, hung with tendrils of ivy and other 
creeping plants, to a winding passage in 
the rocks, ending in a lower grotto, where 
the bath was constructed. Stars of pur- 
pie and yellow glass, set in the roof, per- 



227 

mitted but a softened li^ht to ffain ad- 
mission here; while the moisture of the 
place nourished all around the fountain a 
variety of aromatic plants. In one place 
was a group of statuary, representing the 
story of the three nymphs, Eunica, Malls, 
and Nycheia, becoming enamoured of the 
boy Hylas, while dipping his vase in the 
water ; in another, Diana, with her at- 
tendants, reposing from the chase ; while 
every cavity in the successive descents 
was filled with mould, and planted with 
herbs and flowers, in imitation of the gar- 
dens formed in such places for those they 
had been dedicated to. Winding stairs 
led up from the bath to a dressing-room, 
looking down upon a rocky defile, con- 
taining a rude hunting-lodge, filled with 
ancient implements of the chase. 

While the rest of the party were look- 
ing about them with admiration, Rosalind 
was all astonishment and agitation at what 
she saw. In her former visit to the abbey, 
as she ran thoughtlessly about it, she had 
laughingly mentioned what, if she were 



228 

mistress of it, she would do ; and what- 
ever she had then suggested, she now saw 
executed. Who was it that had done 
this â€” that had attended to her suggestions, 
adopted her plans, and embodied her 
ideas ? She was all wonder and perplex- 
ity ; strange surmises began to rise ; and 
hastily retreating to the house, she rushed 
through the various galleries leading to the 
apartment where hung the picture of the 
young knight resembling major Ancram, 
and dragging the housekeeper after her, 
demanded, as she pointed to it, whether 
that picture bore any resemblance to her 
lord? 

" To my lord," repeated the housekeep- 
er, staring at her, as if with astonishment 
at the emotion she evinced. 

" Yes, to your lord ! to the earl of Du- 
ll am ore r 

" Oh dear, yes ! It is as like him as if 
it had been drawn for him." 

Rosalind wanted to liear no more : she 
released her arm, and in anguish of hearty 
in bitterness of spirit unutterable, turned 



229 

to a window. The truth flashed upon 
her mind : Ancram and the earl were 
one : through a generous wish to make 
amends for the injuries sustained by her 
family, he had adopted the idea of making 
her his, but, ere he revealed it, wished 
to know whether she were worthy of the 
distinction he meant to confer on her. 
The Woodburnes were the confidantes 
of his plan : through them he learned 
whither to follow her from Dunamore, 
and by them would have been introduced 
to her by his proper name, but for her 
own fault â€” but for his no longer, through 
the light in which she had made herself 
appear to him, feeling tjie wish that had 
actuated him to desire this introduction. 
Yes, it was through her own means he 
had relinquished his wish for it, and all 
idea of her ; it was she herself that had 
marred the fehcity that was planned for 
her ; and what â€” what on earth could make 
her amends for the pain endured by the 
reflection ? Yet might it not be possible 
to retrieve his esteem â€” to convince him 



230 

that what had so offended and displeased 
him, had merely been the effect of the 
thoughtlessness of a girlish heart, and not 
owing to any want of love or gratitude to 
those to whom love and gratitude were 
due? But of what consequence would this 
be now, entangled, engaged as she was 
to another, through her coquetry and am- 
bition ? Yes, her giving way to these 
had sealed her fate ; but for her yielding 
to these, she might still have been happy 
â€” might still have regained all she had 
lost ; and she could hardly suppress a 
groan of anguish at the thought. She 
glanced round the room : the housekeeper 
had left it, and the voices of the party 
sounded at a distance, and again she 
rushed to the contemplation â€” the danger- 
ous contemplation of the picture resem- 
bling lord Dunamore. With what height- 
ened admiration did she now gaze on it 1 
and as she gazed on it, how did she won- 
der that it had not made her at once sur- 
mise the fact ! 

When she thought of what she had lost. 



231 

through not sooner ascertaining it, a feel- 
ing of resentment kindled in her bosom 
against the Woodburnes. â€” " But they did 
not imagine I required to be put upon 
my guard," she cried. " No; if they had 
done so, they would never have wished 
to have introduced one so loved and va- 
lued as is lord Dunamore by them to me ; 
and I â€” I alone am to blame myself in the 
affair !" she exclaimed aloud, in the pas- 
sionate agony of her soul. 

She suddenly paused, and the deepest 
suffusion of crimson flushed her cheek at 
the idea of having been overheard, through 
a slight movement she at the moment 
heard near her. The apartments extended 
in suites along the galleries ; and deter- 
mined to ascertain whether any one had 
been listening, she hastily flung open a door 
leading to one of these. But how impos- 
sible to paint her confusion, when, in the 
room into which it immediately opened, she 
beheld lord Dunamore reclined on a couch, 
with his face concealed by his arm as it 
rested on it !â€” " Oh, if he had heard her ! 



232 

But no ; he did not move â€” he did not stir ; 
and in the persuasion of his being asleep, 
overcome by the sultry heat of the day, 
or the drowsy stillness of all around him, 
she presently, in a degree, recovered her- 
self. For an instant she stood looking 
at him ; she then breathed a blessing on 
him ; and wafting him a kiss -with her 
hand, softly withdrew, and closing the 
door, rejoined the party. But there was 
an end of any further pleasure for that 
day : one idea, one torturing reflection, 
solely occupied her mind : that she was 
miserable â€” miserable through her own 
means, and must remain so â€” remain so 
from the conviction that but for herself, 
without any sacrifice of her inclinations, 
all that pride, or vanity, or ambition, had 
ever sighed for, might have been hers. 
Yes, a union with lord Dunamore would 
have gratified every ambitious wish she 
ever formed ; and on this union how in- 
tent had he been ! what a tender â€” what an 
affecting proof of love â€” of the delight he 
took in the contemplation of it, had he 



given her, in the even romantic attention 
he had paid to her suggestions ! 

Unable to converse â€” to participate in 
any degree in the enjoyments of the par- 
ty, she kept aloof, as much as possible, 
from them. They dined and drank tea 
in the cottage already described, and after 
the latter, had a dance before it ; but re- 
fusing to join in this, Rosalind stole away, 
and seated herself on a rocky knoll at 
some distance, where, every now and 
then, the sound of music came minghng 
with the rush of the torrent below, and, 
despite of the feelings that oppressed her, 
she could not help gazing with admiration 
on the scene around her, than for the 
pencil a more enchanting one could not 
be conceived, with the purple shades of 
evening hanging on the brow of the 
mountains, and their darksome glens just 
rescued from obscurity by the gleaming 
of the torrents that dashed through them, 
and the contrasting brightness of the yet- 
illumined sea. 

The party at length broke up, and she 



2S4 

was summoned to rejoin them by the pre- 
parations she saw making for departing. 
The sun was by this time set behind the 
mountains, after pouring, for a moment, 
a flood of dazzHng glory over the scene, 
and the cold grey hues of twilight gradu- 
ally beginning to steal upon his track in 
the heavens. The repose of coming night 
already prevailed around : the birds that, 
all day long, by their incessant warblings, 
added to the cheerfulness of the scene, 
were now at rest, and the flocks folded in 
the quiet fields. It was an hour indeed 
calculated to sooth any mind that was not, 
like Rosalind's, torn by vain anguish and 
regrets. 

She left the enchanting spot in a state 
of perturbation that made her wish to re- 
turn immediately home ; but she had not 
now her fond mother with her, to indulge 
every whim and caprice. 

Lady Dundrum could not think of 
foregoing the game of cards and pleasant 
supper that awaited the party at Mr. 
Marsden's, and Rosalind, much against 



235 



her inclination, was compelled to accom- 
pany her. 



CHAPTER X. 



The day after her visit to the abbey ter- 
minated her suspense relative to lord Dun- 
amore's intention of noticing her â€” as she 
was sitting by herself, she saw him riding 
up to the door ; he inquired for her, was 
admitted, and, with a heart palpitating 
with emotion, she received him. 

What she had surmised respecting him 
was right â€” through the representations of 
his mother relative to her family, her aunt, 
her father, an interest had been inspired for 
her, that created a romantic wish to make 
her a participator of the honours and wealth 
she had been unjustly deprived of His 
mother had contrived to enter into a pri- 
vate correspondence with Mrs. Woodburne; 
and, in the course of time, availing him- 



236 

self of his being in the army to pay a stolen 
visit to Ireland, he found himself confirm- 
ed in this wish, which he confided to them, 
by the opportunities which the Wood- 
burnes secretly afforded him of seeing 
Rosalind. 

Aware of his grandfather having spies 
in the neighbourhood, he feared either in- 
troducing himself to colonel Glenmorlie, 
or affording him that efficient assistance 
he so ardently desired ; what he could do 
with safety, however, he did; and those 
magnificent presents that Rosalind was 
continually receiving from the Wood- 
burnes in reality came from him ; so that 
Mr. Woodburne did not deceive colonel 
Glenmorlie, when he assured him that in 
making them Mrs. Woodburne did not act 
inconsistently with prudence. 

The delight of the latter at the idea of 
an union between lord Dunamore and her 
favourite was unspeakable, and with diffi- 
culty could she observe the silence for a 
time requisite on the subject; but though 
she did contrive to maintain this, she could 



237 

not avoid, from time to time, giving hints 
of a favourite v^hom she yet wished to in- 
troduce to her, and whom Rosalind mis- 
took for the relation of whom she had 
more explicitly spoken. Lord Dunamore, 
however, though he did not venture to 
make himself known to colonel Glenmor- 
lie, ventured, through Mrs. Woodburne, 
to make himself known to some of the old 
domestics at the abbey, and there he took 
up his concealed abode ; and there, over- 
hearing what passed in the first visit of 
Rosalind to it, was hurried, by a sudden 
impulse of feeling, into the declaration 
that had nearly been the means of prema- 
turely betraying him to her, and conceiv- 
ed the romantic idea of contriving a sur- 
prise for her, by the adoption of all the 
plans she had suggested. 

At length he became completely his 
own master, and there was nothing, of 
course, to prevent the full disclosure of 
his sentiments ; but ere he avowed them, 
he wished to have a more perfect know- 
ledge of hers. As yet he knew nothing 



Â£38 

of her, but through the report of friends 
â€” partial friends ; and he wished to be as- 
sured she was indeed the lovely, the per- 
fect, the intelligent being, she had been 
represented, ere he entirely committed 
himself To do this â€” to enable himself to 
ascertain what he wished, he decided on 
introducing himself to her by a feigned 
name, lest in the first instance there should 
be any restraint â€” any studied caution or 
reserve; and accordingly, making him his 
confidant in the affair, borrowed that of a 
young Scotch kinsman, whom he greatly 
resembled in person and manner. 

All went on well â€” nothing for a time 
occurred to induce a belief that she had 
been too partially represented by the 
Woodburnes, when her conduct respecting 
the letter of Mrs. Woodburne induced him 
to think they were indeed mistaken with 
regard to her ; it evinced, in his opinion, 
a levity, an insincerity, an ingratitude, 
that made him shrink back from the a- 
vowal he had been on the point of mak- 
ing, with a determination not to bestow 



239 

another thought on it, except convinced, by 
a further knowledge of her disposition, he 
might do so without incurring the imputa- 
tion of w eakness or imprudence ; yet hard- 
ly had he left the neighbourhood â€” hardly 
taken what he was uncertain might not 
be a final farewell of her, ere he began to 
think he had judged her too hastily, too 
rigidly, and to repent of his precipitancy. 
Yet how could he return, without either 
explaining himself, or appearing to trifle 
with her? and accordingly he compelled 
himself to proceed on his journey, yet not 
without a feeling of embarrassment at the 
idea of the meeting between him and the 
Woodburnes; for, prevented by genero- 
sity from being explicit with them, would 
they not ascribe what had occurred to some 
caprice or unsteadiness on his side? and 
the reflection pained him â€” the reverence 
and esteem in which he held them making 
him wish to retain their esteem. 

His embarrassed manner, however, de- 
spite of him, betrayed what he wished to 
conceal. It was evident to the Wood- 



240 

burnes, that Rosalind was to blame â€” that 
it was owing to something that had dis- 
pleased him in her manner or conduct, and 
not to any capricious change in his senti- 
ments, that he had returned without the 
explanation he had intended to her ; and 
indeed it was owing to an apprehension 
of this kind, that when away from those 
who had a right to remonstrate with or 
check her, she would be betrayed into some 
indiscretion, through the levity and co- 
quetry which, with all her partiality, she 
was but too sensible she was inclined to, 
that made Mrs. AVoodburne so unwilling 
she should leave Dunamore. She did not, 
however, attempt questioning lord Dun- 
amore on the subject, both because she 
was confident it would be useless, and she 
could not bear to acknowledge to him she 
was conscious of their being any failing in 
her favourite. But though unknowing 
how he should finally decide regarding 
her, lord Dunamore could not avoid tak- 
ing advantage of her absence from home 
to make an overture for the acquaintance 



241 

of her father â€” it was haughtily repulsed, 
as already stated ; but though the circum- 
stance pained lord Dunamore, he could 
not bring himself to resent it, considering, 
as he did, how much appearances made a- 
gainst him ; unwillingness to have any ad- 
ditional odium thrown upon his grandfa- 
ther having induced him to conceal that 
to his tyranny was owing his not having 
before made this overture. 

He heard of the arrival of Rosalind at 
Covetown, and, in consequence, decided 
on shortening his own stay in the neigh- 
bourhood ; but he had not the resolution 
to persevere in this decision, from what 
occurred at the abbey ; taking refuge in 
the chamber adjoining the one where hung 
the picture said to resemble him, he un- 
intentionally, as well as unsuspectedly, in 
consequence, became a witness of the vio- 
lent emotion of Rosalind at the discovery 
she there made through this picture; and 
hurried away by the feelings the sight 
of it occasioned, would probably have 
rushed out to her feet, but for the con si- 

VOL. I. M 



242 

deration due to her, the shock he was a- 
ware it must give her to find she had been 
overheard; and, influenced by which consi- 
deration,when, through a slight movement 
he made he had betrayed himself to her 
knowledge, he had recourse to the artifice 
already mentioned to spare her any pain 
or confusion. Some struggles ensued with 
himself, the result of which was, a posi- 
tive determination, though he could not 
forbear seeing her again, to avoid the re- 
newal of all particularity on his side, ex- 
cept convinced he might, without risking 
his happiness, avow the sentiments she 
had originally inspired. 

" Well," he cried, as he advanced into 
the room where she was sitting, " I once 
asked whether JNIiss Glenmorlie would 
condescend to let me claim acquaintance 
with her â€” I now^ solicit to know whether 
she will allow me the still greater honour 
of claiming relationship with her ?" 

" I don't know," replied Rosalind, agi- 
tated almost to tears, yet trying, under 
playfulness of manner, to conceal this agi- 



248 

tation ; " since, if there was any great anx- 
iety about it, it would have been demand- 
ed before." 

" Come, come," said lord Dunamore, 
laughing, though somewhat confused, " I 
see you are better-natured than you would 
have supposed ;" so kissing the hand he 
had taken, " remember, from this mo- 
ment, you are my sweet coz ;" and they 
seated themselves. 

But into what conversation they might 
gradually have slided, we cannot pretend 
to say; for ere they had time to speak 
above a few words, lady Dundrum came 
bursting into the room from one of her 
gadding visits. She had previously seen 
him, and this her personal knowledge of 
him being quite sufficient for her, without 
waiting for the ceremony of a formal in- 
troduction, she immediately addressed him, 
expressed her pleasure at seeing him where 
he was â€” her hope that Miss Glenmorlie's 
being with her would be a means of in- 
ducing him often to repeat his visit ; and, 
after conversing with him for some time, 
m2 



^44 

on a variety of topics, such as the differ- 
ence between the bathing-places in Eng- 
land and Ireland, the amusements of Cove- 
town, and the sameness of those at Wa- 
terton, proceeded to inquire whether her 
young friend had been telHng him of their 
recent visit to his residence â€” " That en- 
chanting place," she cried, " with which 
we positively are all in love â€” where na- 
ture has left so little for art to do, and that 
little has been done with so much taste, 
and magnificence, and genius, by your 
lordship." 

" You honour me by your approbation, 
madam," said lord Dunamore, but not 
without laughing at the extravagance of 
her compliments. 

" Oh, my lord ! no one of the smallest 
taste can deny you that ; for my part, had 
I such a seat, I think I should never wish 
to go outside the gate. â€” Ay, you may 
smile, Miss Glenmorlie," which Rosalind 
certainly did, from knowing her uncon- 
querable passion for gadding. " I certain- 
ly am not partial to retirement ; but were 



245 

I mistress of such a seat as the abbey, I 
need never fear wanting visitors, from its 
manifold attractions." 

" Well, should 1 ever take up my resi- 
dence in it, I hope I shall find this to be 
the case," observed his lordship. 

" Oh, my lord ! don't fear that ; when 
taste, and elegance, and hospitality, are 
blended, none need fear a want of visitors." 

Lord Dunamore bowed to the compli- 
ment â€” it was the only way in which he 
could reply to it. 

" But much as I admired every place I 
saw," resumed lady Dundrum, " there was 
nothing I was so particularly delighted 
with at the abbey, as the romantic bath, 
and that exquisite little suite of " 

Here a cough from Rosalind recalled 
her to recollection ; and confounded by 
what she had been so near betraying, she 
stopped abruptly, coloured, stammered, and 
at last blundered out something of a part 
of the building quite distinct from that 
she had meant. 

Lord Dunamore became grave; from 



246 

her his looks reverted to Rosalind, and his 
keenly-inquiring glance made her invo- 
luntarily decline hers. Not for worlds 
would she have had him suspect the dis- 
covery she had made at the abbey, and 
yet she feared his ascertaining it, by the 
embarrassment of her countenance. He 
remained thoughtful for a minute or two, 
evidently unconsciously twirling his watch- 
chain about; then abruptly rising, he took 
a cool leave, and departed. 

The moment he was gone â€” " My Hea- 
vens, madam !" petulantly exclaimed Ro- 
salind, " how could you be so inadvertent 
as to betray what you were so expressly 
cautioned against mentioning ? There, I 
dare say you have occasioned the dismis- 
sion of the housekeeper." 

" Oh Lord, child ! no â€” no such thing ! 
I am sure lord Dunamore is not that ill- 
natured kind of person to be so easily pro- 
voked â€” it would be unnatural for so young 
a man as he is to be so. Not but I am 
very sorry for what happened to escape 
me; but it was entirely from want of 



247 

thought, or rather from being hardly able, 
since I saw them, to think of any thing 
else but those delightful rooms, and that 
exquisite bath, with its garden, he had so 
secretly fitted up ; they so much put me 
in mind of what has been said of Rosa- 
mond's bower, and the palace of Cupid 
for Psyche, and a thousand other roman- 
tic tales and traditions." 

" I am sure I wish you had not seen 
them then, since they have made an im- 
pression so calculated to do mischief on 
your imagination." 

" Lord, my dear ! why will you persist 
in saying so? I am convinced, as I have 
already said, that lord Dunamore is not 
the kind of captious being you would have 
one imagine â€” his countenance gives me 
full assurance of that ; so make your mind 
easy on that score ; and tell me, don't you 
agree with me in thinking him a charm- 
ing creature, and wondering how any wo- 
man on earth could possibly disappoint 
him ? for, from what the housekeeper 
said, I think we may infer it was owing 



248 

to the lady the meditated marriage was 
broken off: how I should like to know 
all about it !" 

" Pshaw !" cried Rosalind, peevishly, as 
she turned away to a window, " this cu- 
riosity about the affairs of other people 
must be a very tormenting thing." 

" Lord, my dear ! you don't seem in 
one of the best moods possible to-day ; but 
staying within doors, as you have done to- 
day, is apt to make one fretful and sple- 
netic ; but to be sure you mean to come 
with me this evening to Mrs. Austin's?" 

" Me, madam !" exclaimed Rosalind, 
contemptuously ; " how could you possi- 
bly imagine such a thing ? I am sure, if I 
was, what you have just been so kind as 
to tell me, fretful and splenetic, that is 
not a place in which I should recover my 
good-humour. The one evening I passed 
with you there has been quite sufficient 
for me; the lady of the house looking so 
deplorably mortified and miserable, be- 
cause she could not make up one solitary 
card-table, from almost every one she had 



249 

invited sending excuses ; and the son and 
daughter alternately fatiguing and dis- 
tressing you, the one by straining her wits 
to try and keep up some conversation, and 
the other by his ghastly attempts at face- 
tiousness." 

" Well, my dear, for all that, the Aus- 
tins are very respectable people ; and it is 
very ill-natured of their acquaintance to 
make a point of refusing their invitations, 
because their parties are not quite as well 
attended or brilliant as others. They 
should recollect what they used to be; 
and indeed, I believe, between ourselves, 
but on account of their family, they would 
altogether relinquish having any, for their 
circumstances are very much altered." 

" Perhaps so, madam," replied Rosa- 
lind, but in an accent of evident inatten- 
tion to what she had been listening to; 
" and perhaps to that may be owing their 
parties being so stupid." 

" Well, no matter, my dear ; out of 
kindness I know you will come with me 
m3 



250 

this evening, that poor Mrs. Austin may 
be as little disappointed as possible ; for 
indeed I am afraid she is destined to be 
again inundated with excuses, most of 
those she has invited meaning to reserve 
themselves for the grand affair of Mrs. 
Grady to-morrow evening. Were they 
indeed sure of meeting lord Dunamore â€” 
for he also, I understand, has been invited 
â€” but, of course, his going to such a par- 
ty is out of the question." 

" Oh, assuredly !" asserted Rosalind, 
with a smile of derision ; " and notwith- 
standing your eloquence, my dear madam, 
I am sorry to be constrained to tell you, 
that in the number of the expected ex- 
cuses, mine must be included ; for really I 
could not think of inflicting on myself the 
penance of going to another of poor un- 
fortunate Mrs. Austin's neglected parties." 

Not entirely out of contempt did she 
now refuse doing so, but partly from a 
hope that by remaining at home she might 
have a chance of seeing lord Dunamore 
again in the course of the evening, in the 



251 

walk she meditated. The walk was taken, 
but in this hope she was disappointed; 
and after wandering about till she had ab- 
solutely fatigued herself, she returned 
home out of spirits and out of humour, 
vexed, perplexed, and tormented by a va- 
riety of unpleasant reflections, the least 
p^-inful of which v^as certainly not the 
cruel manner in w^hich she had allowed 
herself to speak of the Austins â€” the ut- 
ter forgetfulness of her own recent situa- 
tion, which her apparent want of feeling 
for them evinced â€” for this implied want 
she could have abhorred herself at the mo- 
ment; she thought of her recent sneers 
with absolute detestation of herself for 
them, and felt that till she had done some- 
thing to make amends for her conduct in 
this instance, she could not be reconciled 
to herself. 

" Well, madam, I hope you had a plea- 
sant evening ?" was her first inquiry, on 
meeting lady Dundrum the next morning 
at breakfast. 

" Why, yes, my dear, it did turn out 



252 

a very pleasant one indeed, though at first 
there was no great hope of that ; for, as on 
the evening you were there, poor Mrs. 
Austin, owing to the number of excuses 
she got, was unable to make up even one 
table, there being but three whist-players 
in the room ; and there we sat, stupidly 
looking at one another, yet each trying to 
look pleased and happy, in order not to 
add to her too- evident mortification, when 
in came lord Dunamore." 

Rosalind started â€” " Lord Dunamore !" 
'* Yes, my dear; and then the scene be- 
came changed indeed â€” he directly made 
up the fourth hand we wanted ; and then 
he played rubber after rubber, without 
ever appearing tired, though in his part- 
ner, old Mrs. Nesbit, he had one of the 
most disagreeable partners in creation, till 
doctor Sheppard came in to relieve him ; 
and then he joined the young people, 
who had been vainly trying before to 
make up a set for a quadrille ; and there 
he exerted himself quite as much for their 
amusement as he had before done for ours : 



253 

and at supper he was quite the life of the 
party â€” laughing, and chatting, and sing- 
ing, and paying attention to every one, 
and telling a thousand entertaining anec- 
dotes, lieally, if 1 had not been in love 
with him before, I should have lost my 
heart then to him." 

" I don't wonder at it," said Rosalind ; 
" it certainly was very amiable of him to 
act in such a manner ;" and a sigh escaped 
her at the contrast she involuntarily drew 
between him and herself. " Yet perhaps 
he might have had some secret induce- 
ment for going â€” Did he not look as if 
he expected â€” that is, I mean, did he not 
look in any way as if he was disap- 
pointed ?" 

" No, not in the least ; if he met with 
any thing to disappoint him, he kept it to 
himself, as politeness required. Nothing 
could be more perfectly good-humoured ; 
and by his apparent enjoyment of her par- 
ty, quite reconciled poor Mrs. Austin to 
it; and if I am not much mistaken in 



254 

what I overheard, gave a pleasant fiUip to 
the spirits of the captain, by the hopes he 
inspired of doing something for his son. 
It would be a glorious act for him to res- 
cue the poor lad from the pining life he is 
leading at home, owing to his father's in- 
ability to make any exertion for him." 

" An act, I am confident, he is capable 
of," replied Rosalind, with warmth ; 
" wealth, in his hands, will, I am sure, 
prove a source of happiness to thousands. 
But did he not," hesitating a little, " ask 
for me?" 

" Oh, yes ! almost immediately after 
entering the room." 

" Well," a little anxiously, " and what 
did you say ?" 

" I said you had a very bad headache, 
which prevented you coming." 

" You are sure you did not betray the 
real reason ?" 

" I ! do you think I would do what 
might have made you appear ill-natured ? 
No, no, my dear, let me alone for know- 



255 

ing when to be silent ; none of my friends 
or acquaintance shall ever have to accuse 
me of want of discretion." 

" As, to wit, this morning," RosaHnd 
was on the point of laughingly adding, 
but timely checked herself, from not be- 
ing in a humour, at the moment, to wish 
to vex her ; " and well, I suppose," she said, 
" after going to Mrs. Austin's, there can 
be no doubt of his being at Mrs. Grady's 
this evening ?" 

" Oh ! not the slightest â€” there will real- 
ly be some inducement for going there, 
besides good-nature; for her parties are the 
most stylish in the place â€” every one makes 
a point of going to them." 

" And yet I understand she is not a 
woman much liked." 

" Oh, Lord ! how should she, without 
any thing amiable or interesting about 
her? but she gives superb entertainments, 
and that is quite sufficient to get her rooms 
filled." 

" A proof we need not value ourselves 
much upon collecting a fashionable crew 



256 

about us. However, I must not be very 
severe in my animadversions on the lady, 
as I rather think I shall make one of her 
party myself this evening." 

" To be sure, my dear â€” why not? up- 
on my word ! if you continued to mope 
at home, I should beg a cell in the abbey 
from lord Dunamore for you ; for there, as 
the poet says, you would have room for 
meditation even to madness." 

Certain of meeting lord Dunamore in 
the evening, Rosalind omitted nothing 
that could improve her appearance ; and, 
attired in white silk, with flounces of ricli 
blond, and a coronet of pale flowers on 
her dark hair, certainly did leave her toi- 
let perfectly satisfied with herself 

But though all was serene on leaving 
the dressing-room, there had well nigh 
been a little hurricane afterwards. Rosa- 
lind wanted to delay going, till certain of 
the rooms being full ; lady Dundrum, on 
the contrary, wanted to go the moment 
they were ready, lest the loo-table should 
be filled up, and cassino and whist she de- 



257 

tested â€” there was so much scolding at one, 
and cheating at the other ; and, in short, 
she got so fidgetty and teazing, not to say 
peevish, that Rosalind was at last obliged 
to give way to her. 

But the good-humour this had discom- 
posed was pretty well restored by finding 
the rooms tolerably crowded ere they 
reached the house, which, midway be- 
tween AVaterton and Covetown, was 
filled with fashionables fi'om both, as 
well as the officers belonging to a regi- 
ment quartered in the former; and in 
flirting with these, Rosalind sought to 
amuse herself till lord Dunamore came, 
the mawkish country Misses, ranged 
round the rooms like so many automatons, 
as if just capable of simpering at one 
another, and making a fashionable bend, 
being her utter aversion, as were also the 
beaux belonging to the place, with their 
pertness and priggishness : but, by de- 
grees, those she chose to honour with her 
notice were called off to actual service, at 
the different card-tables, by the lady of 



258 

the house, and she would have been at a 
loss for some one to converse with, but 
for suddenly espying pretty, gentle, little 
Miss Austin, sitting in a corner by her- 
self, as much neglected as if she had been 
an intruder, instead of an invited guest. 
Rosalind immediately joined her ; and af- 
ter a little chat, drawing her arm under 
hers, they proceeded to promenade the 
rooms again ; but in vain Rosalind looked 
and watched for lord Dunamore ; and at 
length, to her unutterable vexation, she 
understood he had sent an excuse. 

" What a pleasant evening we spent !" 
said lady Dundrum, as they were return- 
ing home. 

" We !" repeated Rosalind, emphati- 
cally. 

" Why yes, my dear, did not you ?" 

" Any thing but that," answered Rosa- 
lind, still dwelling on the disappointment 
she had experienced in not meeting lord 
Dunamore. 

" Really ! well, I am sorry for that, 
though I am sure I don't know how it was 



259 

you did not ; for there was every thing to 
render it agreeable â€” beaux, and belles, and 
cards, and dancing; for my part, I would 
never wish to pass a pleasanter one â€” I 
won seven guineas at the loo-table." 

*' Oh ! that accounts then," satirically 
observed Rosalind, " for your^ finding it so 
pleasant." 

" Well, my dear, I do not deny being- 
better pleased to win than lose." 

" To be sure, that is very natural ; and. 
Heaven knows, you earned what you got 
to-night, pinned as you were, for so many 
hours, to a card-table, with every sense 
and faculty apparently in suspension. I 
observed your party sometimes ; and really 
you all put me in mind of so many zoo- 
phytes â€” tliere being nothing to decide 
whether you belonged to the animate or 
inanimate part of the creation, but now 
and then a sigh or a gasp when Pam, or 
the black ace, eluded your grasp." 

" Ah, well ! only wait a little, my 
dear ; you will then find the comfort of 
cards." 



260 

" I have not the presumption," rejoined 
Rosalind, " to rail against what so many, 
infinitely superior to me, I am sensible, in 
every respect, sanction, by seeking amuse- 
ment from ; I only contend it is odious to 
see every sense apparently absorbed by 
them, as if it was for something more 
than amusement people sat down to play." 

Lady Dundrum laughed significantly, 
but said nothing; and Rosalind, having 
vented her spleen a little by this philippic 
against her favourite amusement, let the 
conversation drop ; but how was her vex- 
ation renewed, when, on entering the 
house, she learnt that lord Dunamore had 
been there, with an intention of passing 
an hour or two with her, under the sup- 
position of her not being sufficiently re- 
covered, from what he had heard the pre- 
ceding evening, to go out. 

" And what an evening have I lost !" 
was her internal exclamation on receiving 
this information ; " and what should have 
tempted me to go to the odious party I 



261 

have been at, had I known I might have 
expected him here !" 

The next morning, at breakfast, a card 
was received from him, inviting her and 
lady Dundrum to a dinner party the com- 
mencement of the ensuing week. Lady 
Dundrum accepted the invitation with 
ecstacy; and the moment breakfast was 
over, hurried out, at once to announce it, 
and try and learn who had been invited 
to meet them. 

Rosalind had not been long left by her- 
self, when she also put on her bonnet for 
a stroll. She had not got far from the 
house, when she encountered lord Duna- 
more. â€” " Happily met," cried he; " that 
is, if you allow me to be your escort 
wherever you were going." 

" I was merely going to take an idle 
stroll," replied Rosalind. 

" AVhich to me is extremely delightful," 
said he ; " so permit me ;" and as he spoke, 
he drew her hand under his arm ; " and 
now which way shall we bend our steps ?" 



2162 

" Ob, as chance directs ! the place is so 
romantic, that you could scarcely go any- 
where you would not find the walk a plea- 
sant one." 

" And assuredly with such a compa- 
nion," looking laughingly at her. 

" Oh, that of course ! you could not 
possibly have avoided saying so." 

" How do you know? what if I was 
not in the habit of saying what I do not 
think ?" 

" Pooh ! that is all nonsense : â€” if we 
could believe that indeed !" 

" Well, what then ?" 

*Â« Why then your compliments would 
be considered more flattering ; but I don't 
know why you should have greater credit 
given you for sincerity than other people." 

" Well, when I set about convincing 
you of my sincerity, I shall not rest till I 
have succeeded ; but to let that rest for 
the present â€” did you hear of my calling 
on you last evening?" 

" Yes ; but instead of calling on me, I 



263 

fully expected, from your having been at 
Mrs. Austin's the night before, that you 
would have been at Mrs. Grady's." 

" Oh ! in one place I was wanted, but 
in the other I could be spared ; besides, 
the idea of your not going afforded me 
the hope of passing so much more a de- 
lightful evening than I could possibly at 
that lady's party, that I could not possibly 
prevail on myself not to send an excuse." 

Rosalind blushed with pleasure, and 
how ecstatic would have been her feelings 
at this avowal, but for the torturing re- 
collection that occurred at the instant! 
The agony it imparted contracted her 
brow, and compelled her for a moment to 
turn aside her head to conceal it. Alarmed 
then at the idea of the conversation as- 
suming a greater particularity, she exerted 
herself to give a turn to it. 

On returning home he sat some time 
with her ; when he rose to depart â€” "Well," 
said Rosalind, laughing, " to make you 
amends for the terrible disappointment of 
last night, if you don't know what to do 



264 

with yourself this evening, you will find 
us at home." 

" Then expect me," he replied ; " and 
now," kissing her hand, " adieu ! with a 
thousand thanks for the dehghtful morn- 
ing you allowed me to pass." 

" Delightful !" Rosalind repeated to her- 
self; and did he think so because it was 
passed in her company ? What flattering, 
what dehcious hopes would this have awa- 
kened â€” his looks, his manner, the emo- 
tion evinced by both the morning he called 
on her â€” but for the terrible entanP'lement 

in which she had involved herself! 

Â« 

She was musing on this in bitterness 
of spirit, when lady Dundrum burst in 
upon her, with the news she had been col- 
lecting in her gossipping calls- â€” '* Well, 
my dear," she cried, as she threw herself 
upon a chair, " we shall have a delightful 
party at the abbey." 

" My dear madam," a little peevishly 
interrupted Rosalind, " I have not the 
least wish to know ; it half destroys the 
pleasure of a party to know beforehand 



265 

who is to be at it. I wanted to tell you 
I have asked some one to drink tea with 
you this evening." 

" Really ! and who, pray ?'* 

" Lord Dunaniore." 

" Lord Dunamore ! Well, really, I am 
quite delighted, and so glad that you told 
me before I threw off my bonnet and 
shawl, that I may try and make up a 
party for him. I know the Austins are 
disengaged, and I think I shall be able 
to secure old Mrs. Nesbit and doctor Shep- 
pard." 

" No, no, my dear madam !" cried Rosa- 
lind, attempting to stop her, " lord Duna- 
more is not, by any means, so fond of cards 
as you seem to imagine. I know â€” that is, 
I am almost persuaded, he would rather 
pass the evening with us in conversation/' 

" Pshaw ! how stupid, my dear ! No, 
no â€” I will do as I said," and away she 
sallied, and, to the extreme chagrin of 
Rosalind, succeeded as she wished. 

Lord Dunamore was tlie last of the 

VOL. I. N 



266 

party in coming, and Rosalind could not 
avoid thinking that he was disappointed 
in finding one there. He had too much 
command over himself, however, to evince 
any positive vexation ; but this was not 
the case with Rosalind, and, but for the 
Austins, she probably would have shewed 
what she felt at the positiveness of lady 
Dundrum ; but she was actually begin- 
ning to like this family, and, independent 
of this, there w^ere considerations that 
made her w ish to avoid any thing that 
might appear slighting to them. 

Lord Dunamore w^as now her constant 
attendant â€” the companion of her walks, 
and her escort to the different parties in 
the place ; and to w4iat could this be ow- 
inof, but a revival of the sentiments he had 
at first experienced for her? Her own for 
him were daily becoming more ardent â€” 
more impassioned ; in vain reflection point- 
ed out the risk she was running, by en- 
couraging such feelings â€” there w^as some- 
thing too delicious in them, answered, as 
she believed they were, by corresponding 



267 

ones in his bosom, to permit her to have 
resolution to resist them, more especially 
as she flattered herself she should be able 
to overcome them, whenever the moment 
actually arrived for rendering that neces- 
sary. 

If for a time led to misjudge her through 
her own fault, he had tried to think of 
her without interest, that time was now 
over. She saw that it was, in a thousand 
nameless instances â€” in the sparkling glance 
of his eye, whenever encountering hers â€” 
in the fond familiarity of his smiles â€” in 
his constant assiduities and attentions; and 
she revelled, or rather would have revelled, 
in the thought of being so dear to his 
heart, but for the reflection â€” the torturing 
reflection, of her engagement to another. 
Haunted perpetually by this, her manner, 
her conversation, often became involunta- 
rily constrained towards him. 

Nor was this her only cause of unhap- 
piness â€” the light in which she allowed her 
father to be considered by him, was an un- 
N 21 



268 

ceasing cause of reproach. Fearful of their 
becoming acquainted, lest her engagement 
should be revealed to him, and thus an 
end put to those attentions that were so 
delightful to her, even sooner than was 
requisite, she permitted him to think that 
the prejudice to which he justly imputed 
the repulse he had already experienced 
from her father was invincible; and the in- 
justice she was guilty of, in permitting 
him to think so, aware, as she was, that a 
candid statement to her father of what had 
occurred since her arrival at Covetown, 
would at once have overcome every re- 
sentful and indignant feeling, and induced 
him eagerly to seek what he had before 
coldly and haughtily repulsed, preyed con- 
tinually on her mind, exciting at once re- 
morse and apprehension. 

Thought was too painful to be endured, 
and she accordingly fled from it as much 
as possible ; but it v/as not always to be 
avoided ; and little could those who saw 
her in her moments of forced gaiety have 



269 

suspected the pangs that too often tortured 
her in private. 



CHAPTER XI. 



The party at the abbey was numerous and 
fashionable ; the officers belonging to the 
regiment at Waterton were included in it, 
and the band attended in the evening for 
dancing. Kosalind saw herself the object 
of general attention, and the circumstance 
did not fail to give an excitement to her 
spirits that rendered her extremely bril- 
liant. To complete her triumph, how- 
ever, it was requisite that her influence 
over lord Dunamore should be perceived ; 
but how was this to be accomplished â€” 
how should she contrive to render this 
visible ? for, tender as were his attentions, 
they were still, in general, of that calm, 
unobtrusive, unostentatious description, 
that might escape observation, except par- 



270 

ticularly directed to them ; she knew no 
other method than by occasioning him 
some emotion, nor no means of doing this 
but by entering into a flirtation with an- 
other. 

Amongst the officers was a major Bal- 
four, who had previously paid her much 
attention, and on him she fixed, to try 
what a Httle coquetry would do. He was 
just handsome enough for the use she 
â– wanted to make of him â€” that of creating 
jealous}^ in the heart of another ; and af- 
ter appearing to be wholly engaged with 
him for some time, she suddenly suffered 
her eyes to roll round with a vacant look, 
and felt her heart flutter with dehght at 
finding lord Dunamore was intently observ- 
ing her. This was all she required to perse- 
vere in her plan ; and ere she left the din- 
ner-table, at which this sudden flirtation 
had commenced, she was set down by most 
of the company as either a great coquette, 
or else very much disposed to give serious 
encouragement to the handsome Balfour. 

The gentleman, very much inclined to 



S7l 

be of this latter opinion himself, joined 
her the moment he returned to the draw- 
ing-room, and again they appeared to be 
quite engrossed by one another. The sti- 
mulus requisite to make Kosalind perse- 
vere in her coquetry was not wanting â€” 
she saw lord Dunamore was hovering a- 
bout the seat she occupied, with a flush 
on his cheek that denoted internal agita- 
tion ; and elated at having succeeded in 
occasioning him some emotion, she deter- 
mined to persevere in doing all in her 
power to render it more visible. 

There was a good deal of playing and 
singing before dancing commenced, and 
she was at length asked to take her station 
at the harp. She hesitated â€” saw lord 
Dunamore was in reality attending to her 
without appearing to do so, and â€” " No, 
really," she cried, " I don't think I shall 
play to-night â€” dancing will be quite a suf- 
ficient exertion." 

" Nay, let me entreat," said major Bal- 
four, with the air of a man who was sa- 
tisfied he should not be refused ; " I shall 



272 

be quite au desespoir if one song is not 
granted." 

" Well, rather than that," and she rose, 
and carelessly passing her hand under his 
arm, suffered him to lead her to the in- 
strument. â€” " Well, now that I am here 
to oblige you," she cried, and she laid an 
emphasis on the latter word, " what shall 
I play?" 

" Oh ! something that breathes of pas- 
sion," he replied, in a languishing tone. 

She laughed, and was running her fin- 
gers over the chords, when one of her 
bracelets fell off; lord Dunamore and he 
both stooped for it at the same instant, but 
his lordship was the person who took it 
up. He offered to put it on : for a mo- 
ment Rosalind did not pretend to notice 
him. â€” " Oh, no !" she then cried, " I wont 
trouble you ;" and taking it from him â€” 
" Here, major Balfour," she said, " I be- 
lieve you are more au fait in these mat- 
ters than his lordship," putting out, as she 
spoke, her white hand to him. 

He eagerly seized it, rapturously press- 



273 

ed it to his lips, and then dropping on one 
knee, put on the bracelet. 

" Pish ! this is really being quite too 
adoring !" said Rosalind ; and forcing away 
her hand, she looked to see what effect 
this had upon lord Dunamore; but he was 
gone ; and in dismay and apprehension of 
his having left her through disgust and 
contempt, she precipitately quitted the 
instrument, and walked to another part of 
the room. 

Yet why this alarm â€” this disquietude ? 
Had she not purposely laid herself out to 
make him uneasy? and was not the abrupt 
manner in which he had withdrawn from 
her side a proof of having succeeded in 
the effort ? If she could be but sure she 
had only inspired a feeling of jealousy, no 
scorn, no contempt ! Almost unconsci- 
ously she proceeded to seek for him ; but 
what was her mortification, her disappoint- 
ment, instead of finding him thoughtful, 
abstracted, discomposed, to find him in 
the next room, apparently free from agi- 
N 3 



274 

tation â€” no indication of it either in his 
looks or manner, gaily laughing and chat- 
ting with the party there ! 

Was he then utterly indifferent ahout 
her conduct? had vanity misled her? 
Pride, self-love, were wounded even to 
agony by the supposition : or did he think 
a woman capable of the conduct she had 
practised unworthy of feeling any uneasi- 
ness about ? oh, yes ! that must be the case ; 
for he certainly had appeared discomposed 
at first by her coquetry with major Bal- 
four; and his so quickly recovering him- 
self was, doubtless, owing to the contempt 
that coquetry had inspired : instead, there- 
fore, of awakening still more powerful 
emotions in his mind, she had probably 
destroyed whatever interest she had pre- 
viously excited, and â€” "Fool, fool!" she 
internally exclaimed, " to suppose a cha- 
racter like his was to be moved by 
her artifices â€” affected by what he must 
despise." 

In the bitterness of this reflection, she not 
only peremptorily, but even petulantly, re- 



275 

fused dancing with major Balfour, to his 
utter astonishment, after what had passed, 
and was retreating to the set that was 
now forming in the next room, when she 
caught a glance of such meaning â€” such 
comprehensive meaning, from lord Dun- 
amore â€” of such mingled reproach, and 
surprise, and tender upbraiding, as in a 
moment revived her hopes and dispelled 
her despair. Her hopes ! and what hopes 
could she form that must not be at the 
expence of his happiness? If she had 
succeeded, or did succeed, in inspiring him 
with an attachment to her, must she not 
have to accuse herself of disturbing the 
happy equanimity of his mind â€” of the 
tranquillity, the repose, of that generous 
heart, that so delighted in promoting the fe- 
licity of others ? She could have smote her 
breast at the thought â€” she could have bid 
him fly from her with scorn and detesta- 
tion; had he joined her at the moment, 
she could have wept to agony. â€” " But of 
what avail my tears?" she cried to her- 
self; " thus it is that I am continuallv 



276 

erring and repenting. How is it, that, 
aware as I am of what I suffer when ob- 
liged to condemn myself, I am continually 
incurring self-condemnation? How is it, 
but by not knowing how to maintain a 
proper command over myself â€” by allow- 
ing my feelings and passions, on the small- 
est provocation or excitement, to gain do- 
mination over me ? and so well taught, so 
instructed, so remonstrated wdth on the 
subject, as I have been by the best of mo- 
thers â€” the most excellent of women ! But 
I will amend when alas !" and she sigh- 
ed deeply, " when I have no longer any 
happiness to lose." 

On lady Dundrum's retiring, he attend- 
ed her to the carriage; Rosalind followed, 
but apparently not noticed by him. Hav- 
ing handed her ladyship in, he was re- 
treating into the house, when Rosalind 
laid her hand on his arm â€” '" So this is the 
way you are serving me ?" she cried. 

He coloured and looked confused. â€” " I 
thought major Balfour was attending you>'* 
he said. 



277 

" No, you may perceive he is not." 

" Oh ! then, of course, I shall have the 
pleasure of handing you into the carriage." 

" And is it only," with a little archness, 
" because there is no one else here to do 
so?" 

Lord Dunamore looked earnestly at her 
for a moment â€” " Where we imagine we 
have power, let us not make an ungene- 
rous use of it," he cried ; " adieu !" kissing 
his hand as he retreated from the carriage, 
" and dream of what I have said." 

Dream ! she did indeed dream of it â€” 
dwell on it â€” repeat it a thousand times. 
Power ! had he acknowledged she had 
power over his feelings ? â€” " But of what 
avail to know !" was the anguished excla- 
mation her recollected engagement exci- 
ted; but she would fly for the present 
from this recollection â€” she would be hap- 
py while she could : in the few remaining 
weeks she had to stay where she was, she 
would concentrate all that might have 
been the happiness of years; and when she 



S178 

returned home, then, in sober sadness, sit 
down to regulate her feelings. 

But she could not adhere to this resolve 
â€” the next morning brought a letter, for- 
warded from home, from lord Oriel ton. 
She received it with a recoiling sensation, 
and hastening to her chamber, flung it pas- 
sionately from her. Yet could she treat 
the letter of lord Orielton with this con- 
tempt â€” he with whom her future days 
were to be passed â€” whom she would be 
bound to reverence and honour ? She a- 
gain took it up, and, with a hand render- 
ed nervous by agitation, broke the seal. 
Tender, affectionate, indicative of the most 
sincere attachment, with mingled anguish 
and remorse did she think of an engage- 
ment where so much was due, whilst so 
little was felt. Her feelings were not pas- 
sively to be endured ; and putting on her 
bonnet, she hastily left the house, taking 
a direction in which she thought there was 
but little chance of her encountering any 
one she wished to avoid. 



279 

She had not gone far, however, when 
she met Miss Austin, and whom, after 
conversing a few minutes with, she asked 
to walk on wuth her, glad, after all, to meet 
with some one â€” so insupportable were her 
reflections. 

Miss Austin excused herself, however, 
but with evident reluctance, on the plea 
of being obliged to hasten home â€” "Where 
we are now all bustle and hurry," she said, 
" preparing for the departure of my bro* 
ther, who, perhaps you know, through the 
kindness of lord Dunamore, is getting an 
appointment in India." 

" Not exactly," replied Rosalind, ** but 
I am now happy to learn it." 

" But this is not all," continued the full- 
hearted girl, with a gush of grateful tears; 
** lord Dunamore is not only getting him 
this appointment, but to you. Miss Glen- 
morlie, I am sure I may disclose the fact, 
without any risk of humiliation, but has 
undertaken doing all that is requisite on 
the occasion; thus adding kindness to kind- 
ness, and obligation to obligation. Through 



280 

the most untoward circumstances, my poor 
father was suddenly deprived of the power 
of doing any thing for his family, and his 
anxiety in consequence may easily be con- 
ceived; but from this he is now relieved â€” â€¢ 
the heavy weight that hung upon his heart 
is removed from it ; and, oh !" she added, 
with all the enthusiasm of ardent and 
youthful gratitude, " may the generous 
being who has been the means of relieving 
him from it be as happy in this life as he 
must be in the next, for his benevolence ! 
If in any fond wish he has been disap- 
pointed, may he speedily and fully be 
compensated for this disappointment ! In 
short, may every blessing this life can be- 
stow be his ! Never can I breathe a prayer 
for myself^ without also offering up one 
for him, his preservation and happiness. 
But I am not the only person who has 
reason to bless and embalm his name with 
tears of gratitude â€” you know not the 
good he has done since his coming into 
the neighbourhood; for, like the silent 
dews of heaven, his secret bounty largely 



281 

flows, and brings unasked relief. But I 
must bid you adieu, my dear Miss Glen- 
morlie ; I am not only expected back im- 
mediately, but now that we are so soon to 

lose poor Henry " Her lip quivered 

â€” the feelings of the sister overcame her ; 
and wringing the hand of Rosalind, with 
a tearful smile, she bounded off. 

Rosalind was affected even to tears by 
what she had been listening to. While 
indulging them, she heard some one ap- 
proaching, and hastily uncovering her face, 
beheld lord Dunamore. Agitated by so 
unexpectedly beholding him, she started 
up from the grassy bank on which she had 
seated herself, without making an effort 
to conceal the tears that bedewed her 
cheek. 

Lord Dunamore looked grave and re- 
served ; but at sight of these tears the 
distance of his manner vanished, and â€” 
*' Good God !" he exclaimed, " no ill news, 
I hope, from home ?" 

" No, thank Heaven ! the pang that 
would inflict is at least spared me." 



282 

" You relieve me by saying so, for I 
was afraid, from your tears, the reverse 
was the case." 

" No, nor are they immediately pro- 
ceeding from any other painful cause â€” on 
the contrary, ' rather from pleasure." 

" I rejoice to hear it, and would add â€” 
might they never flow from any other 
cause ! but that life will not permit of such 
an expectation ; and a wish we cannot ra- 
tionally look to being fulfilled, it is absurd 
to utter ; all that I shall therefore say is, 
that I hope you may be destined to shed 
as few from any other as mortals in gene- 
ral are !" 

Rosalind bowed â€” " My doubting the 
fulfilment of the wish cannot prevent my 
being grateful for it," she said. 

" Doubting it !" repeated lord Duna- 
more ; " and why should you doubt it ? 
Life is opening to you with fair and bril- 
liant prospects." 

" Perhaps so; but, like Juliet, perhaps 
I have an ill-divining spirit. But to speak 
of something else â€” perhaps I shall sur- 



283 

prise you when I tell you that you have 
been the real cause of my recent tears." 

"I!" exclaimed lord Dunamore; "you 
do indeed surprise me by the assertion ; 
and pray may I inquire how ?" 

" By the kind and benevolent action 
you have just performed â€” in short, by 
your generosity to the Austins. Nay, do 
not blush to hear it has been mentioned. 
Oh ! you know not the eloquence â€” the 
pathetic eloquence it imparted to the lan- 
guage of a sister, or how impossible it was 
to resist the effect of that eloquence upon 
the feelings ! But why, if we do not strive 
to suppress our indignation at an act of 
cruelty or baseness, should we hesitate to 
yield to the sensations excited by one of 
benevolence ? I know you will disclaim 
all praise on this occasion â€” I know you 
will tell me, that in doing what you have 
done, blessed as you are with the power of 
gratifying every generous impulse, you 
have but performed your duty; and I al- 
low this. But still this will not permit my 
giving utterance to what I think on the 



284 

occasion ; for when we behold the wretched 
and forlorn, so often slighted as they are 
by the great and the affluent, how can we 
withhold the tribute of esteem and admi- 
ration from him," and she involuntarily 
laid her hand upon the arm of lord Dun- 
amore as she spoke, " who so nobly proves 
himself worthy of the kindness of a be- 
nign Providence !" 

" You affect me," said lord Dunamore, 
in a tone indicative of strong emotion; 
" but sweet is praise from the lips of those 
we love; yet, whilst I lay the flattering 
unction to my heart, permit me to repeat 
what you have already said for me, that 
in doing what you approve, I have not 
merely performed a duty, but an impera- 
tive one, since, notwithstanding w^hat 
I now am, there was once a chance my 
situation in life might have been different ; 
and this reflection certainly gives all who 
are unhappy a claim to my sympathy and 
consideration. But," he added, taking the 
hand that rested on his arm between his, 
and pressing it to his lips, while his coun- 



285 

tenance assumed an expression of the ten- 
derest, liveliest, fondest admiration, " how 
sweetly must she who thus appreciates an 
act of kindness, perform one herself, when 
occasion offers !" 

Rosalind began to tremble with agita- 
tion ; his looks â€” the softness of his tones, 
made her fear that a dreaded eclaircisse- 
ment was approaching; and rather than 
see any tendency to which, she would 
have preferred his retaining the cold re- 
pelling air he had worn on first joining 
her. 

As a means of preventing what she 
dreaded, she proposed returning home. 
Lord Dunamore playfully tried to prevent 
her ; but in vain â€” the letter of that morn- 
ing had recalled her to a proper sense of 
her situation : she saw she could no longer 
persevere in her recent conduct, without 
trifling with all that ought to be precious 
to her ; in a word, that she had advanced 
to the very verge of danger, and that no- 
thing remained for her, but to make a 
retrograde movement as fast as possible. 



2186 

if she wished to prevent the utter destruc- 
tion of her peace. 

She had hoped to have found lady Dun- 
drum at home by the time she got back, 
but she was disappointed ; and dreading a 
protracted tete-a4ete with lord Dun a more, 
she could have railed against her at the 
moment for this incessant love of gadding. 

As with a feeling of embarrassment she 
advanced into the room, she saw a billet 
on the table, addressed to her from major 
Balfour, begging her acceptance of a beau- 
tiful bouquet of greenhouse plants that 
had accompanied it. Scarcely allowing 
herself to read it, she flung it, together 
with the bouquet, away, andâ€”" Coxcomb !'' 
she exclaimed, " if he teazes me, I shall 
certainly leave this to avoid him." 

" But might he not be checked without 
being absolutely shunned?" demanded 
lord Dunamore, a little archly ; " I have 
heard such things were possible ; and since 
you have set my mind at rest about him, 
I should indeed grieve that you quitted 
this abruptly." 



287 

" Oh ! complaisance obliges you to say 
so ; but when once gone, you would soon 
cease to lament the circumstance." 

" Then you think me more insensible 
than I really am." 

" Oh, no ! only like other men of the 
world â€” saying things without meaning." 

" But suppose I am not, according to 
your acceptation of the term, exactly a 
man of the world ?" 

" Well, perhaps not, only just suffici- 
ently so to deem a little commonplace 
gallantry no harm." 

" And you accuse me of this to you ? 
Do you remember, the other day, my tell- 
ing you, on something of a similar charge, 
that that was not the moment for assert- 
ing my sincerity ? But it is now come ; 
yet can I believe it doubted â€” that you, 
so discerning, could remain utterly igno- 
rant of the sentiments you had inspired ? 
No, I will not so discredit your penetra- 
tion, or my own feelings, as to admit such 
a belief Yes, I see â€” by that averted eye, 
that kindling blush, I should err to do so ; 



288 

but to put the matter beyond all further 
doubt, thus," catching her to his boson), 
and straining her to it with passionate 
fondness, " let me claim you as my own, 
my destined bride !" 

This was the moment that Rosalind had 
dreaded â€” the moment she wished to have 
warded off for ever, anxious as she was 
to save lord Du nam ore from the humilia- 
tion of a rejection, where he had such rea- 
son to be sure of, and think himself en- 
titled to acceptance ; and her confusion 
and her distress were indescribable. She 
struggled to disengase herself from his 
arms â€” engaged to, almost the wife of an- 
other; and yet to find herself enfolded in 
his embrace â€” to feel the tumultuous throb- 
bings of his heart against her bosom ! She 
burst, with sudden agony, from him, and 
throwing herself, panting, on a chair â€” 
" Lord Dunamore !" she cried, " how have 
you presumed to treat me in this man- 
ner ?" 

He looked astounded â€” "Presumed!" 
he repeated. 



289 

** Yes ! presumed," laying hold, in de- 
spair, of his conduct, to furnish herself 
with something of a plausible pretext for 
what she was enforced to. " I know not 
what there has been in my manner, in my 
conduct, to provoke," and she sobbed hys- 
terically, " the freedom you have taken ; 
but throughout this whole affair I have 
been ill-used â€” treated as a person whom it 
was only requisite for you to make up 
your mind about, to be sure of having." 

" Good God ! you hurt â€” you astonish 
me by this ungenerous accusation !" cried 
lord Dunamore. " How I have merited 
it, I am utterly unconscious ; if, however, 
I have unwittingly offended, pardon what 
was not intended, nor suppose me capable 
of wilfully offending any one, much less 
her whom I wish to make my wife." 

" Your wife ! oh, no, no !" in accents of 
bitterness she exclaimed ; " you, so cool, 
so considerate â€” oh, no, no ! you could ne- 
ver seriously think of a person for your 
wife you knew so httle about." 

VOL. I. o 



290 

^' But how do you know that is the case 
with regard to you ?" said lord Dunamore, 
recovering from his discomposure, and a 
fond smile again brightening his counte- 
nance ; " longer than she is aware of 
have I known my Rosalind, not merely 
by description, but sight. Her friends, 
the Woodburnes But need I enter in- 
to particulars ? does she not at once sur- 
mise the fact ? They made me acquaint- 
ed with her â€” they gave me opportunities 
of seeing â€” of listening to her ; but not on- 
ly there did I see her, or listen to her â€” 
she cannot have forgot the day, the en- 
couraging day, she passed at the abbey, 
when she said, * The lord of the place 

should come over, and ' And he had 

come over, and seen her, and admired her, 
and felt, that in prevailing on her to unite 
her fate with his, he should indeed render 
himself happy ; and this he now asks her 
to do â€” asks her in full confidence of being 
able to prove to her that he deserves no 
suspicion of the kind she has just uttered." 

** No, no !" exclaimed Rosalind, shrink- 



291 

ing back, " I cannot ; and even if I could 
" and she paused, not knowing what 



she was saying â€” what she would say. 

" Nay, if you allude to your father, 
cried lord Dunamore, " the explanation I 
have to give will, I am convinced, remove 
every prejudice from his mind; or if you 
hesitate only because you think presump- 
tion has mingled in my hopes, does this 
look like presumption, like confidence, un- 
worthy of either of us, thus," and he knelt 
at her feet, " to solicit the hand of Rosa- 
lind, and declare that my happiness de- 
pends on its being granted ?" 

Rosalind, for a moment, gazed on him 
with passionate tenderness; then covering 
her face with her hands, she again shrunk 
back, and motioned him to rise : but, oh ! 
the agony â€” the struggle of rejecting a 
heart so devoted to her ! Her resolution 
faltered ; but the stern rage of her father 
â€” the vengeance of an injured lover, should 
she falsify her engagement, were too ap- 
palling to her mind not to reconfirm it ; 
o 2 



292 

and finding him about pleading still more 
passionately for himself, she started up, 
and retreated towards the door. 

At this lord Dunamore suddenly stop- 
ped, and the expression of his countenance 
altered. â€” " From what I now see, I per- 
ceive, madam," he cried, " that further 
importunity would be persecution, and 
shall accordingly desist from it ; but ere I 
take my leave, permit me to say that I 
grieve I have so long obtruded on you â€” 
that I did not sooner allow myself to com- 
prehend your real sentiments ;" then slight- 
ly and distantly bowing, he departed. 

Rosalind flew to the window to gaze 
after him, as at her last gleam of departing 
happiness ; and so their acquaintance, their 
friendship, had ended ; and henceforth 
they should be as nothing to one another 
in the creation ; but while life remained, 
she felt her heart could never be estran- 
ged from him. â€” " My sentiments!" she ex- 
claimed, as despairingly she raised her 
streaming eyes to heaven, '* oh ! how little 
in reality are they comprehended by him ! 



293 

how little does he surmise the wild anar- 
chy, the sorrow, the confusion, he has ex- 
cited in my breast !" 

AV'ere those feelings endurable ? â€” was it 
requisite she should doom herself to un- 
happiness? â€” might she not venture to throw 
herself upon the kindness and compassion 
of her parents, and confess the truth ? But 
no â€” her mother indeed might pity, and 
be inclined to listen to her plea ; but her 
father, stern, inflexible, unrelenting, in 
whatever honour was concerned, would 
he not spurn her from his feet, or trample 
her beneath them, at the bare suggestion 
of her wishing to break an engagement 
she was bound by so many ties to adhere 
to? and, cast from his regard, pursued 
by the reproaches of an injured lover, 
would lord Dunamore, the noble, the ge- 
nerous, the dignified Dunamore, receive 
her to his bosom? Idle hope ! How would 
he shrink from an union where no confi- 
dence could be placed ! for what proof of 
steady affection for him could be deduced 
from her conduct, receiving, as she had 



294 

done, while yet his idea was impressed on 
his imagination, the addresses of another? 
Oh ! when he came to discover this â€” 
when he came to discover that at the very 
moment when she was alluring him to the 
humiliation of being rejected by her, she 
was not at liberty to receive his vows, 
what would he â€” what must he think of 
her ? â€” " Oh ! never after that let me be- 
hold him again !" she cried ; " never en- 
counter his indignant glance, his contemp- 
tuous smile â€” never behold him again ;" 
and could she bear to think she should 
never more behold him ? and with these 
regrets was she to become the bride of an- 
other â€” of one so entitled to the fondest 
love â€” so entitled to it by his own merits, 
and the disinterested generosity of his at- 
tachment ? 

The wrong she did him by the senti- 
ments she harboured â€” the ingratitude, the 
disrespect she had been guilty of towards 
him, now struck full upon her mind ; and 
in agony â€” the agony of self-condemnation, 
self-upbraiding, she wrung her hands, and 



295 

â€” " Oh, unworthy of either !" she cried, as 
in frantic distress she paced the room, 
" unworthy alike of him I have rejected, 
and him I have accepted ! Did they know 
what I do, little would be the regret of 
either for losing me â€” little the danger of 
any rivalry between them, for one they 
must then despise." 

In this state of agitation she was sur- 
prised by lady Dundrum. In extreme 
confusion, she instantly retreated to a win- 
dow, and leaning against it, pretended to 
be engaged by something without, in or- 
der to have a pretext for avoiding her 
looks. â€” " So, still at home !" cried her la- 
dyship : " well, upon my word, my dear, 
you mope a great deal too much ; and this 
is such a charming day ! But that is true 
â€” did you see any thing of lord Duna- 
more this morning ? for I just met him, 
and it is very odd he merely passed me 
with a bow, and looked as if there was 
something disturbing him." 

** Very likely," said Rosalind ; " there 



296 

are few people, I believe/' and she spoke 
with difficulty, " but who meet occasion- 
ally, let their station in life be what it 
may, with something to disturb them." 

" Very true, my dear ; but, liOrd bless 
me, child !" catching a glimpse of her coun- 
tenance, " you have been crying \ Why, 
I hope you are not an illustration of your 
own remark? But I suppose the fact is, 
you have been poring over some melan- 
choly love-tale : it would have done you 
a great deal more good to have been ram- 
bling about the cliffs and fields. Every 
one was out to-day. But come, you must 
rouse yourself, and get up your spirits 
against evening, for you know we are en- 
gaged to Mrs. Bolton's." 

" Yes, but I must be excused going," 
said Rosalind, as she sunk upon a chair, 
" for my head is distracted." 

" Distracted ! No wonder, I am sure, 
for your eyes are as red as a ferret's with 
crying. But come, a little rose-water will 
cure that ; and when you find yourself in 



297 

company, you will feel quite a different 
being." 

" I shall not try whether I should or 
not, for into company I certainly shall not 
go to-night ; for, exclusive of having a 
headache, I w^ant to prepare for my depar- 
ture to-morrow, for I must then return 
home," â€” a resolution she had suddenly 
taken, in consequence of being unable to 
endure the idea of meeting lord Duna- 
more again, after what had occurred. 

" Home!" repeated lady Dundrum, in 
a tone of surprise ; " why no, I hope not, 
my dear, as I purpose remaining here some 
time longer myself" 

" I must, indeed," was the sighing re- 
ply. 

" Well, really, I am sorry â€” there are 
so many delightful parties in agitation, 
and I purposed, besides, giving one myself 
the ensuing week. But, bless me ! what 
shall I do? I cannot possibly think of 
leaving you the last evening you will be 
with me, and yet I so positively promised 
o 3 



298 

to call on poor dear cross Mrs. Nesbit in 
my way to Mrs. Bolton's, that I am 
afraid the testy little mortal will be quite 
affronted if I disappoint her." 

" On my account the risk must not be 
incurred," said Rosalind, " more especially 
as I have so much to do, I could not sit 
quietly with you." 

" Well, my dear, since that is the case," 
said her ladyship, in a tone of revived 
cheerfulness, relieved from the terrible ap- 
prehension of being obliged to forego a 
delightful loo party, " I believe I will 
keep my engagement ; but, depend on it, 
I shall not be late, nor will I leave you till 
I see you take a cup of strong coffee, the 
best thing in the world for a headache," 

Rosalind could have shook her head, 
and told her that hers was not to be re- 
moved by such means; but she avoided 
saying any thing that could excite the cu- 
riosity of her ladysliip. 

Her preparations for departing over 
sooner than she had given her reason to 
imagine, the Austins occurred to her 



299 

thoughts ; and conceiving they might 
think it unkind her not bidding them 
adieu, she decided on repairing to them 
for the purpose. She might have enter- 
tained a similar apprehension with regard 
to many others in the neighbourhood, but 
it so happened the Austins alone excited 
it, and this, perhaps, not so entirely from 
holding them in preferable regard, as from 
their being connected, in some way, from 
what had occurred in her mind, with lord 
Dunamore. 

The evening was tranquil and lovely, 
the sun was already setting, and the glow 
of the evening sky threw a repose and soft- 
ness on the landscape that was inexpres- 
sibly beautiful. Rosalind lingered in her 
walk. She was about quitting scenes of 
enchantment â€” scenes which particular cir- 
cumstances had rendered abstractedly in* 
teresting to her, and she felt all that sad- 
ness of heart which taking leave of such 
never fails of occasioning. The groves of 
Dunamore Abbey, with the spires of that 
ancient pile, flushed with the crimson of 



300 

the parting beam, were conspicuous in 
the scene. 

Rosalind in vain strove to withdraw 
her eyes from them. â€” " Oh, bowers of 
bliss ! oh, scenes of beauty !" she exclaim- 
ed, " what happiness, but for myself, 
might I not have enjoyed within you ! 
but I knew not the paradise that was 
created for me till all hope of possessing 
it was lost." 

The Austins were still at the tea-table, 
but it was not till she had advanced en- 
tirely into the room that she found lord 
Dunamore was one of the party. She al- 
most started with emotion, yet she knew 
not how to regret what had afforded her 
an opportunity of once more beholding 
him. On their eyes meeting he distantly 
saluted her, and then immediately resum- 
ed the conversation with captain Austin 
which her entrance had interrupted, leav- 
ing it to the ladies and young Austin to 
chat with her. Making an effort to reco- 
ver herself, she proceeded to explain the 
motive of her visit. 



301 

" Going to lose you so suddenly !" said 
Mrs. Austin. " Well, really, Miss Glen- 
morlie, without flattery, I am sorry for 
it ; and as to Harriet," alluding to her 
daughter, " I believe I need not say that 
she will be so too ; and here is lord Duna- 
more also come to take leave : upon my 
word, there will be quite a chasm in our 
society here !" 

Lord Dunamore ! and was he too going? 
Yes, and certainly on her account â€” cer- 
tainly to avoid her ! and the conviction 
this imparted of resentment and displea- 
sure, and a wish, or rather determination, 
to think no more about her, nearly over- 
came the composure she had been strug- 
gling to regain. She glanced unconscious- 
ly at him : his eyes were on her at the 
moment, but the instant hers encounter- 
ed them, they were averted. She sighed, 
and wished to go, yet knew not how, 
for this was probably the last time she 
should be in his company, and the idea 
seemed to chain her to the spot. 

Suddenly addressing himself to her â€” 



S02 

" Well, I must unite with my lady, Miss 
Glenmorlie," said captain Austin, in ex- 
pressing my regret at your leaving us ; 
though, to be sure, the little distance to 
which you are going affords some conso- 
lation for your doing so ; but for losing 

lord Dunamore now, do, my lord, 

let us have the comfort of knowing, is 
there any chance of your coming to settle 
amongst us ?" 

" Consider my professional duties," re- 
plied lord Dunamore, evasively. 

" Well, yes ; but then, if there was a 
young and beautiful countess in the way, 
might you not be induced to relinquish 
the tented field for the quiet enjoyment 
of your own delightful groves ?" 

" I must wait till there is a young and 
beautiful countess in the way," said he, 
laughing, " to resolve that question." 

" Well, it must be your own fault if 
that be not soon the case." 

Lord Dunamore bowed. â€” " You flatter 
me by thinking so," he said ; " but per- 
haps it may not be exactly as " He 



303 

suddenly checked himself, coloured, and 
turned off what he had been about saying 
with a laugh. 

" I did wish and hope, and began to 
think," resumed captain Austin. 

" My dear !" cried his wife ; her voice 
recalled him to recollection, and in his 
turn he coloured violently and looked 
confused. His confusion, however, was 
nothing equal to what he occasioned Ro- 
salind by the significance of his glance, 
rendering evident, as it did, his meaning 
in what he alluded to ; and hastily she 
turned away her eyes from lord Duna- 
more, lest she should see by his looks that 
it was as apparent to him as it had been 
to her. 

Ere her embarrassment had at all sub- 
sided, the latter rose abruptly. â€” " You are 
not going to leave us so soon, my lord, I 
hope," said Mrs. Austin, in a tone of 
alarm ; " you know you rather gave us 
to expect, when you came in, that you 
would stop the evening with us." 

" Assuredly, but I have just recollected 



304 

that I have some other farewell calls to 
make ; and so you must have the good- 
ness to excuse my prolonging my visit." 

" Certainly, my lord, since that is the 
case ; nor can I continue to urge Miss 
Glenmorlie to lengthen hers, since, by go- 
ing now, she will have the pleasure of 
your lordship for an escort home." 

" No, no !" exclaimed Rosalind, abso- 
lutely terrified at this cruelly-embarrassing 
suggestion, after the scene of the morn- 
ing ; " no, no, by no means ! not for 
worlds ! that is, I should be sorry to give 
lord Dunamore that trouble." 

" It would be a pleasure," he said, " but 
that," and he spoke evidently under the 
impression of awkward feelings, " I am 
obliged to go quite in a contrary direction ; 
so that to my young friend here," glancing 
at young Austin, " I must delegate what 
would otherwise have afforded me so 
much happiness ;" and he proceeded to 
shake hands with the family. 

The heart of Rosalind throbbed vio- 
lently. Would he, by overlooking her at 



305 

the moment, place her in the awkward â€” â€¢ 
the embarrassing situation of appearing 
slighted by him ? He retreated towards 
the door â€” their eyes encountered. He 
paused â€” the natural generosity of his feel- 
ings overcame every other sensation, and 
advancing again into the room â€” " Miss 
Glenmorlie," he said, extending his hand 
to her, " good-bye ! and â€” and when you 
see our friends, the Woodburnes, remem- 
ber me to them." 

Rosahnd bowed. She could not speak, 
and ere she had at all recovered from her 
emotion, he was gone, and she found her- 
self again surrounded by the Austins. 
They were too keen, too penetrating, not 
to perceive that something was amiss. 
The relationship between lord Dunamore 
and Rosalind v\'as known to them, as 
well as the admiration he had evinced for 
her, and, consequently, the coldness of 
their manner now towards each other 
could not but appear extraordinary. They 
had too much delicacy, however, to make 
a comment on what they thought ; nei- 



306 

ther did they tease the bewildered and 
nearly-subdued Rosalind to remain longer 
Avith them. They saw her home, and 
the hour being late, took leave of her at 
the door, with a hope that the intimacy 
that had been commenced might be con- 
tinued.

" Our foes were too gallant not to welcome us, and often, when we met, would willingly have de¬ tained us, but seriously, two such vali¬ ant nations cinnot long be adverse, and in that confidence I have already began to cement th- public union by private friendship " Uttering these last words, he led forward a cavalier, in w hose coun¬ tenance so plainly an honest ingenuous¬ ness was deputed, that he could not miss a prepossession of the hearts of his beholders " 1 his is Signor Claudio de Santillana," said he , " the chance of war gave him to my hands, and his great act impUshmcnts have raised him to my heart I feel myself happy in hisafFectionsand honoured in his esteem We are now suth sworn friends, that I could almost firmly believe whit in sport 1 often have heard professed, men must be one time inimical to gain a true sense of each other's value."
" I perfectly agree with that idea," added Claudio, " for from your own conduct I draw my conviction of its truth Till I became your opponenti suspected not superior conduct, and be¬ fore I was your captive, knew rather from hearsay than experience that noble generosity which a min ¡n arms should pnctise to Ins fellow ' " A truce, my dear Claudio '" cried the lively Henri, "to acknowledgments, or in justice to yourself, and these my brave followers, permit mc to say com phmcnts Foryour own trutmcnt look no wider than your own deserts, for tht gallantry which gained mc s » vilua- ble a prize I now thank my valiant com¬ rades at whose held I have fought from the rising j the sinking of the sun, antl never once found en se to cry—come on ' ' To this spe h his armed va sals replied w ith the In iliest testimonies of a sincere affection they crowded about him, thcy wept their

Now, holy father, is there not reason to rejoice « hen I re¬ store so many gallant fellow s in safety to their homes ' nor can you be surpris¬ ed thit I should weep, when I knew that m the multitude, parents there were would* uni y' seek to embrace their sons; but these I likewise know are few, and
fttl with proudest exultation that the grandest token of good generalship is the safety of the victors " " And the warrior who does not tlurk hki you, my noble lord," said the priest, cl isptng the hand of Henri, " dots not deserve to be intrusted with the life of a dog, ' adjoined Claudio, " much less wtihthatotaman " lhevehemcnctofshe speaker produced a smile in Henri, and the Cure, who, taking an arm of each, led them to a small refectory, where the board was neatly spread " I am but ill provided for an enter¬ tainment," said he, pointing to some cold viands, "but your profession, gen- tlunen, befriends my poor table, inso¬ much as it sildom grants you opportu¬ nity to seek for dchcacie " " Ί rue," replied Henri, " and so far we are obliged to it, as our palates ai e m ex¬ cellent order But these, father 1 " observ. ing some fruits and wines , " these w ill bemorc the welcome, forthey aretheless

mırıhıngto a town some leagues distant. 1 hese objı etions were not to be over¬ ruled , so, bidding the priest a kind fare- is ell, the tw о frıtnds hastened through thegardcn to mount their horses, whith were i t uictly standing near the gate "At kit," said the Cure who attended them from the boose, " it least suffer me to procuri you a guidi " " By nomeans," cried Henri, "Pierre is well acquainted with the road, and I have a slight recollection of the coun¬ try there can be no danger." " Pirdon me," returned tbe Curé, " there may be great danger," and his eyes fell on Pierre w ho was alighted to icpair some accident in the furniture of Ins fleed " there is a certainty of some dangir, as the roads arc yet unrepair¬ ed since the enemy's inroad. Do not go unguidtd " " We shall do extremely well," ex¬ claimed the gay chevalier, " better in my opmion than if burdened with the
company of another besides, here is no peasant I would exact such service from, so much more happily as he is now employed Therefore, my dear father, trust us to our fortunes, if they prove dl we shall reflect the more on your kindness " His courser curvetting impatient to be gone, he shook hands once more with the priest, and reined it about to gallop off, but he was pre Vented by the inquiries of Claudio for but Squire Ercolani " Is he among the dancers?" asked Claudio " He walked towards them," replied Pierre " (So, and bring him to us," laid Henri , " but do it a» t fully, for if my friends sh »uld suspect my departure it will not be speedy ' Pierre quitted them, and the priest observed th t he did not recollect bis countenance among the chevalier's ancient retinue " He is still new in my service," said Henri, " and his swarthy face preju- dices none«mi« behalf but I believe
bim honest, and am assured of hu cou. rage His chief fault u an invincible suU lenness, which I dislike the more, as you know, father, it is far from being our characteristic ' The subject of these re¬ marks now Teappeared, being accompa¬ nied by a frisky well formed Itaban, who protested his ignorance of so immediate a continuance of the journey He was destrtd to get astride his horse, which order he and his companion obeying, Henri bade a last farewell to hu host, and by the side of his friend galloped down the descent of the mountain 'their spirits were exhilarated w ith the wine they had drunk, and they rode with a rapid pace eill they reached the side of the river, on which opposite bank the road was traced but bere an un thought of difficulty presented itself to the forward chevalier, in the swelling current, which falling from an eminence not a furlong distant whence he stood, rushed foaming before hu hone's head
" Mon Dieu ' ejaculated h , " Signor Chudio, our progress ıs soon stopped ' " There must be some bridge here about," said Claudio, but Pierre being questioned, told them they had passed the only bridge in the futhermost quar ter of the pbin " but, " added he, " an old peasant hves somewhere in this val¬ ley by the profits ot a wherry " It must be distant hence, ' observed Claudio, " the current is here too swift for any strength to w ork a boat across ' "But lower down, Don Chucho,' said Pierre, " it is less v íolent " We will then proceeu on the mır gin,' id Henri, « horn the w hole com pany followed \\ htn thev had threaded the serpentine course about an hundrett yards, they perceived the waters more tranquil "Itis not unlikely that we may find a place fordable m this neigh bourhood," observed Henri, " for 'tis proved that the flood has sunk consider ably by the appearance of these a jueous

" We art here much on a level with its surface," continued Henri "What thmk you, Don Cleudio, lull wc venture to btive this formidable stream'' " My humour is not over anxious to vemuie a thance of diving," replied С laudio, " ind can we find this same Icrryn in Purre mentions, 'twill by far be s iter to commit ourselves to his skill, thin lo the power ot these horses. 1 confess myselt unwilling to trust mine, for his proficiency in swimming yet re¬ mains unproved " "I w ill « age this 'gainst any mare our side of the Alps," said the cheva¬ lier, stroking the arched neck of his beast, " ay, or stallion either, lor

" If my lord will permit me," said hil Squire, " I will go forward, and see whe¬ ther bis house stand not beneath the (haile of yonder clump of trees." ** Witb all my heart," said Henri ; " and make good haste, for I am in- dined to fear he may be gone to merry- make witb the rest of his neighbours." " I warrant his absence from their mummery," replied Pierre ¡ " 'tis a sarly unsociable creature." Hethenfped before his master, who followed him in a gentler mode, and came to a little grove which his precursor had entered ; pasung through an alley, shaded and overhung by the conjoined boughs of a douHe row of chestnut«, he was wel¬ comed by Pierre, who said the wherry was preparing for their passage.

They called aloud with oilers of a I trgcr sum, but his steps soon grew remote, and the closing of an inner gate ethocd negatively, 'lhc dejected fi ¡ends with¬ drew, and seated themselvesvvithin a few yards of the inhospitable threshold. The fresh gale chilled them with its easterly keenness; their feet and legs were torn by the thorns they had trodden thro' ; while the raven's croak and the flipping of the winged bats they had disturbetl from covert, invidcd them with a creep¬ ing horror which the will had not ılın power to resist.

One of them drew lumi bis side a horn pendent by Ins bj., which he sounded; and when the bli^t ceased to vibrate in his cars, the astu-
nished Chevalier recognised in the tones of one ot them, who seemed to be ad¬ dressing ι superior, those of Pierre He felt an emotion of joy at this discovery, and arose wilh ci nfidtnce to profess himself, but С 1 mdlo thetked hnn by the garment, and w Inspired limito hearken tn their conversaţii ıı, vvlutlı precaution might perhaps prevent his becoming a fellow captive w ith his sel v ınt to ι ruth· less banditti " I prnttst, ' said the voice, " 'twas no neglect of mine, Signor' the Clievalitr ridts so thoughtlessly, that it «as with tht greatest difficulty I kept a sight of him so long " "Had you pieservtd ι more consi¬ derate с ire," answ cred ι voice deep and sonorous, " this separation could not have happened " " I performed the best of ill) abilities," replied the first speaker, who the friends w ere now convinced was no other than Picire " and no master of mine can have reason to doubt it however, if

forth, and was greeted by his Squire, of whom Claudio solicitously demanded the fortune of Ercolani He was told they had separated in tbe wood As Pierre then gave them to understand that he by chance had fallen in with these horsemen, in whose leader he found я manly concern for their misad¬ ventures, Henri and Claudio patsed into a laige court, anxious to pay their re¬ spectful thanks, but they were told he was gone round with most of his train to the stables, which lay in a diffeient quarter being likewise apprised tha they were committed to the care of the old man, they follow ed hım, attended by Pierre, to a narrow flight of crazy steps, winch, being ascended, brought them through a small postern into a hall of undıstınguıshable extent, as their only light was an expiring 1 ť címed by thetr grey bearded guide " You must bite your fingers here,*' cro-ked he, " till I return."

His full dark eyes humbled the gaze of beholders, and his proud lip, thickened with disdain, projected con¬ scious superiority to men, and self indé¬ pendance of aught earthly His high forehead was crowned with luir blick as jet, which in waving curls wantoned about his temples, and crescent c; e- brows of a fellow hue, strikingly lem- trastcd with the polished it hitenes«, of an unblemished skin.

An awful magni¬ ficence, grand, though in decline, dis¬ covered itself in the whole; but the beauties of particular embellishments their lamp ill permitted them to inspect, as it trembled in the wind, which gushed through many a tent in the hangings. They now surveyed the bed, which stood within an arched recess opposite the «aiements: its furniture was gorge¬ ously worked, and the tester nearly touched the ceñiog; a fringed coanter- nace was the only modern apj^arance that they remarked, when, casting his eyes towards the head, with a wonder tíat benumbed his faculties, Henri beheldt

My earliest si¬ tuation, in the retrospect of memory, represents me labouring under the seve nty of a sad illness, which, I have heard my mother say, confined me many months to a bed, and, even when yield¬ ing to the goodness of my constitution, preserved so strong a hold, that a lapse of years could only restore me to the soundness of uature I seemed «hen growing sensible to the objects around, to be degraded, I knew Dot how, nor from what my parents bave often told me, the delirium of mv fever had be¬ witched me with such extravagant fan- ties, that the tone and demeanor of haughtiness I assumed, sometimes procur. ed mc chastisement Indeed, thcc-mciioos they inspired in my bosom were very different from the filial transports I have seen in other children, and, since then, I have ofte» condemned myself fer neg¬ lecting to pretend the affection nature

I involuntarily shivered when I considered the poverty of the hut, and tbe ludeness of my
parenti, wbo were rough m their miktest mood, caused my little heart to struggle with emotion till my eyes overflowed with tews. In short, discontented and fretful, my spenti sunk into a dejection the lost иЛе ruffle«!, and once the ac¬ cidental Utterance of the name Lewis, by which a little playmate saluted mc, sounded a tender familiarity with my car»,my mdnnclioly coukl not brook,and I burst mto a violent crying To my mo¬ ther, who questioned me as to the cause* I found it impossible to give an explana¬ tion, and tbe poor bilie wanton was chid for mischief-making She was the only daughter of aSpamsh поЫеамп, who,his estate being completely ruined by th« Ulttstuic Щг, betwixt the Christians and Moslem kingdom», emigrated into Italy to receive a bequest of property im the right of hl» lady To her my mo¬ ther ml a chosen attendant, and when Ricardos (my lather) courted her, he •found it more difhcult to gain the appro-
I tuon of the countess, than the heart of his mistress However, though with di awn from the bouse, my mother stili proved her a munificent patroness, and, in gratitude, left her husband and my self, to nurse the infancy of her new born daughter She contmued with them till the unfortunate Countess was obliged to flee from her house with its guilty lord, whose indulgence in the per mcious habit of gambling plunged them into inextricable misery They set tied near the suburbs of Verona, and, his wife soon after dying of a broken heart, the disconsolateCount entrusted his be loved Camilla entirely to the care of her nurse In a short time, dissatisfied with Inactivity, and comfortless in expecta tion, he came to my mother's dwelling, and gave to her a small sum of money, promising quarterly to rcn*vr it then tenderly embracing his child, he dcjiart ed with bitter self accusations, but had nei er лпее re appeared, or sent token
of existence. Thus was the friendless in¬ fant thrown on tbe charity of strangers, whose narrowness of means, unsup¬ ported, could no longer continue the little style whicli had been hitherto prac¬ tised towards ber; but clad in coarse ap¬ parel, and faring like themselves, thcy nourished her witb care and mildness. They saw her daily Improve in an en¬ dearing vivacity, and my mother, who pxatly swayed Ricardos in the kindness of his conduct, to warmly loved the ten¬ der nursling, that I am assured, had such a sacrific« been necessary, tbe would awn willingly bave parted with ber own ion. Her distinction is caresses, which, babies as we were, did not escape our apprehension, abated no jot of the mu¬ tual fondness we had conceived; and when this distinction went farther, as it often did, in trifling presents and the Uke, tbe bewitching art, wherewith she contrived secretly to share them with me, betokened a disinterested mind.
then in blossom, but which I afterwards beheld budding tht frankest generosity. " With the attachment of natural brother and sister we passed the earliest stages of childhood, and commenced those years, in which the improving keenness of the intellectual faculties craves the food of knowledge spontaneously, as the body it's proper nutriment We cu¬ riously enquired of things hitherto only admirable to our senses, but the answers proved the people about us quite as igno¬ rant as ourselves, for a monotonous life nt daily labour, nursing their minds in idleness, had almost occasioned a total privation of thought, and thoughhappy in an unmanly contentment, beyond the narrow conctrns of their necessary occu¬ pations they were unable to inform, be- cause ban en of idea so, the only novel intelligence we could obtain, was the certainty of a developement of all our ignorance in w orks of wonder entitled books. To get one of these became our
eager endeavour the desire fur instruc¬ tion once whetted no obstacle tan blunt, and a superstition we simply ton caved, that these had a magical proper¬ ty of imfcuding all our wishes might luggest, occasioned the hours of leisure to move with m rcase of heaviness By а lucky fortune the long sought mestini able prize came to our bauds, and, un- sMşpţcioiu of a progressive accoutrement of its contenti, wc hoped rcodi у to ex tract tbe solution oi what our fantu, projected, but, soon wc pentivi d tiu necessity uf learning to read before w t could understand, and although tltt let ters were not unknown by me, for af ttr a httle hesitation I could point out tadı, wc found u impossible to improve with out in instructor ihis, at length, «c gained fortune was interested in our behalf, and my httle fame for a gttt, esteemed supernatural, but whith was reallysurpvising, as neither of myparents knew one letter from another, had г a

Our progressivas rapid, because we were e .«rnest, lud each step to knowledge disperses the gloom which obscures those above it Uur pleasures came m rapid succession, for learning was delight, and labour recreation the eftorts ot each strove to keep pace with the kindness of the other, and while; I tempted the frisky chamois to a mild imprisonment in her bower, or twined the straggling eglantine to encercle the casement of her chamber, she would anxiously contrive me nets and lu ts tor fishing, poreirgpouchtSv, belts, slinks, and a thousand sutlt, 1 needed, to etjuip me tor those pursuits, which ihicf objttt in sutet s was htr sati fac¬ tion lhc danct in the evu ing was the chicrtul windu g up ot tht day an early rest icised и ith the rt ing sun, and we improvid in vigoui ind suture wah vi- ч bit stridts tt inrd mituri!)

invite. She was ot that slender form which interests the heart without cn- thralment ot the eyes: her chief bcauly sprung from animation; so that the sweetness ot her tones, the signifitancc of her countenance, aided by a carriage, unaffected because untutored, made an hour of familiarity irresistibly cultivat¬ ing, for the gentle arllessness, wherehy she stole her empire over you, lulled all apprehension, antl the passions only a- vvoke Írom thtir iniautious security, to experience the ellects of a power, they equilly ftlt unable and unwilling to baffle. Striiken with love my silt, 1 thought it impossible that man could be¬ hold lnr «ith indifferente, and though fearless of any mericnary bartering of her affections, yet, sensible to my own deficiencies in rank and wealth, 1 feared that some one, more fortunately gitted, might cllutually supplant 111c in her breast. '1 he temptations of the world are thought swcctir while untasted;
and if displayed before her, I conceived it to be probable that Camilla in the eager. ness ot youth, might withdraw- from that favorable* obscurity, ai tl torget a lowly peasant's son amid the binliint cirile of titled suitors, bo much 1 w as overeóme by these reflections, as In vin ρ like а babe; so ihat when 1 quittid ыу pillow, I left it soaked wilh the tears I had shed. The day was fresh when equipped for hunting I sallitti abitiad, my mind so agitated that it felt a degree ot phi en- zy, and was ready to wrt ak its fury on the harmless Hocks that lay in my way : not finding any village sportsman at the rendezvous, whenie wc were used to go in search of the destructive adversarii»- to the herdsmen, 1 wandered about with an unste idy gait, until guided by a horn, I overtook a party attending a noble cl the neighbourhood.

No looner did I enter, than my father
commenced a scverelecturepnmyrough ness to the Baron, from whith I under stood that the lattir had complained to Ricardos, and threatened my punish¬ ment unless 1 supphctted pardon Re proofs on this topic I could not «til di¬ gest, so, in answer to the prejudiced account my father had recuved, I told the fact accurately as it w as, concluding with expressions of contempt for the denunciations of revenge, and of disdain for the bare thought ot being a suitor for pardon. My father tlun admitted that the circumstance assumed a differ ent aspect, and, convinced of my obsti¬ nacy, forbore all further persuasion lo submit although ht observed, tint the Baron being left an orphan in his y oung est days had, by never meeting coun¬ teraction of his will, but the contrary from his servile tutors and dependants, acquired so extravagant an idei of ink commands being indisputabit, tint it was to be apprehended w с should sut

busiest scene, nit for comfort, but relief." The Chevalier too often had heard ot' misfortune's fitful insar ity to be con¬ founded by its present symptoms in Claudm: complaisant to the wild tenor of his speech, he reproved it not, but mingling his tears with those of the uttercr, soothed him to lomposure. Henri, after several apposite observa¬ tions, inquired of Claudio, how long was the interval since his sufferance of the last miserable stroke, and his pre¬ sent relation of it ? " The year but three times bath come round," answered the Cavalier; " but to mc it hath seemed twenty times iu natural length : and otten 1 have heard tlie wretched father declare, that tin: few remaining seasons bis age tuuld vx- jxxt to endure, seemed an eternity to his careworn mind. The loss ot Camilla sunklhim on a sick bed, where for many weeks his lift· was in imminent dan-
ger : he very slowly shook off the in¬ firmities ot illness, and though grieved to llu heart myselt, Iwas obliged to dis¬ semble resignation when attending him. His kindness to me rallier was confirmed than weakened, yet did I muih tear that my piesencT* was painful to him by re¬ viving most poignantly the unhappy fate ot his daughter; mil solitude be¬ coming intolerable to ni)stlt, 1 broke from my l»enctietor, and went to the army.

Hut my thoughts were preposstsid, wherctore I was incapable as a babe to aggi at. lize myself in the vuirlel ·. of my blood I was as prodigal as soldi.'is ian be, but my talents as an officer were ci ushed beneath the weight ot my tares. Where service was to be tuund I sought it: the ceremonious
battle, forlorn assault, projected ambush ment, or annientai skirmish, all of these, possibility [ crmittcd, I entered, and many a man found cause to biwail the intcniperature ot that courage, deli¬ berate conduct shuddered at, and con¬ demned During the times ot ces ıtıoıı I often revisited the abode of mypitron, in whom I «as shocked to trace the signs ot decay, too visible on his person. As hostilities dropped in Italy , I tomul myself at liberty, ind spent some months with lnm but the limitation if my mistress empoisoning tvery ninnitnt with sad rcmcmbrtncc, tnd addition illy dissatisfied with mictivit), I quitted Don Phılıppo to bicorne a volunteir under the Marquis del Gulsto, «ho« ts assembling a large but promiscuous army, at the head of «huh he hoped to rout your coeentrymen fiom ľud mont, and run a career ut victunous invasion through the neighbouring pro¬ vinces of France. His success Europe
knows, and how the homkide imbc tiled the soldier. For me, disdainful ot the signal to retreat, I obeyed slowly, until .1 vagrant shot struck and shat¬ tered my horse. It was a lutky cir¬ cumstance I since have thought, for it give me to the hands of Henri." '1 he friends sat silently for some mi¬ nutes. " But with regard to this stran¬ ger ?" at length said the Chevalier. '■ Tiuly," a lyoincd Claudio, " I hopr that 1 have justiin d my behaviour to tlie silinger, though yuu, in generous . onfidcncc, accused it nut." " And do you siedi istly believe that ne md Julim aie «he sime'" asked Henri. "My menioi; is filiations ¡i.dietl if hclu· not," icpl'iuU laudio '· My Ше¬ пи it, their birth was not double."

The simple «ene preceding his sleep broke it, by tbe aid of a disordered imagination He imagined that Henri shock him, then staxted as if spoke tor, yet never com¬ pletely awoke lus dreams wore only
interrupted m their evd imagery by something that seemed to realize them.
In the morning when he awoke, he outstretched his limbs to recover hem from inert hnguor, but, throwing his arm across the place Hcnn had taken, he « as surprized to find it vacant. 1 am a slug^rird, cried he, and imme¬ diately jumping up, called out to his fiitnd No answir being returned, he snitched his sword from the bolster, where he had I ud it the overnight, but « hence he observed thit of the Cheva¬ lier to be gone He no ν felt a degree of alirm, r η to the windows, and threw «me ot them open.

That tbe Chevalier would go abroad after what bad passed, exceedingly sur¬ prized him, and lie continued to look abroad, impatient for his return. Cha- (■tuil-d by his long absence, he at length determined to go m search of him, but,
tunung round with tbb resolution, the sight of Henri's ctsqvo, whkh was hy¬ ing where the Chevalier himself had placed it, filled him with consternation. Ready to burst with emotion, be rushed to the door, it was closed, and he stag¬ gered many paces backwards, for its fas¬ tenings were unmoved, but complete as they had been made the preceding mght Unhappy youth ' sighed he, and smote his forehead, too just were your fore- bodements, and vain hath proved all our precaution, fen- surely be whom we had to deal with, is not of human origin At that juncture, came some one to the door, he knocked, Claudio hesi¬ tated , but with him personal fear ever was slight withdrawing the barricado, he threw open the door, the hideous Nicholas entered, in his hands was a tray with breakfast, he did not salute
tbe СатвДкг; Ь«« sulkily a» before, pboed tbe tray upon tbe ground, Clau¬ dio sikintly beheld this proceeding; a hope «tolo through bis bosom ; it was tnasknt; for looking downwards, he •aw that there was a portion but for tme. About to address the old man, tbe latter left tbe room, but bequeathed a parting glasee so fraught with ma. lignity, that the Italian was startled : be stooped, and emptied the contents «sf tbe ewer into the tray ; a white se¬ diment appeared at tbe bottom ; it was jritty, and palpably of a poisonous qua¬ lity. Claudio dashed away tbe deadly victuals, and flew after the treacherous assassin. Nicholas was lingering at the remote end of tbe corridor, but seeing tbe injured Italian approach with fury beaming in his eyes, be slunk from the spot, and disappeared. Claudio ran with rapidity to the place, and striking wide the entrance,
bounded mto the centre Ы an apart· ment, and arrested the disgusting fugi¬ tive. The wretch screamed a piercing and unequal yell Claudio half relin¬ quished hu bold, for Jus ears acknow¬ ledged its similarity to that, whkh so frightened his company when thcy were wandermg through the waste ) and he no longer doubted it bang а ugnai· howl He began to shake the miscreant with all his might, and to drag him backwards, but. Nicholas fiercely re¬ sisted, and only when be felt the naked sword patted along bit throat, would he move a foot, threats of immedme destruction, enforced by gestures con¬ sistently violent, drove him along tbe corridor, and being thrusted mto the chamber, he fell on the floor. " Wretch '" taid the Itaban, " anse, and answer me 1 " He obeyed with sqoabd form and haggard aspect, en¬ deavouring to befit his fiend like eyes
for bemhleuppKcation. Chudio thud· ctered, and spurned him with bis heel, •tying, " You soagbt my life." " I seek it sow !·' hoarsely spake the mon s ter. His wards were no mockeries, for rekasing a abart dagger from bis ac¬ cursed breast, he sprang forward, with a dSMjUy purport in his descending blow ι but. Claudio, unshrinking, met the band, and with an upward stroke M tinnir trom tke arm divided it, that, innocent and »faestained, the weapon dropped at bis feet. Tbe assassin tore die room with shrieks. Claudio caught vp the dagger, and immediately he was possessed by tbe demon of revenge, for it wa» Henri's ; the blade of demas¬ ían tetnper, and ebon grasp, studded with jewels, were not to be mistaken. «* Wbere obtained you this?" cried the kalian to tbe sanguinary Nicholas. ** Where is Henri; the Chevalier? Speak," cootmeed he, " speak quickly
«г never will you again."

When accompanied by Henri he had not attempted that part, the path ht now made never yet being trodden by human foot, and his brain grew giddy with a downward prospect of many fa¬ thoms perpendicular, unrelieved to the sight by weedy or rocky projection but lor the fissures in the rock behind, this station were untenable in one of them he thrust hu arm, and bent beneath the impending brow of the extreme, the last and mightiest test of his intrepi¬ dity.

And now Clau- •dio desired him to bring them shortly to tbe secret valley, which he began to describe, and also the edifice situated within it. At this command, the horror- stricken guide began to roll his eyes, and mutter a heartfelt repentance for having undertaken so perilous a commission ¡ but tbe Italian, despising and disregard¬ ing his fears, insisted on a prompt per¬ formance of his will. The poor man resisted until the peasantry came up, and •earned from hit supplications what was the service they so «trolly had been in- duced to embark in: in corsequence thty testified against Rowlana а great resentment, which proved itself lo bc founded in an unmanly pusillanimity.
When the soldiers were instructed in the scruples of then* rustical companions, they piquantly derided them, and pro¬ fessed themselves faithful to tbe cause of Chudio, who, encouraged by their firm¬ ness, and convinced how necessary was a vigorous exertion, drew his poniard, and clapt it close to the throat of Mi¬ chael " Dastard ' cried the runous Cavalier, " if y ou bhrink from our agree ment, this shall be the reward of your iaithlessness 1 have purchased a portion of your time, and till it be expired y ou shall be my submissive Jave You know my will, likewise you know the consequence of slighting it, so let your cowardice still direct you before you harm is uncertain, but here it is una- oidable " He then ordered Ercolani to gallop foremost, and the peasants awed irto a sullen silence, followed the Cavalier and hit troopers At le ngth they arr«« <«d on the brow •of the heights that overlooked tbe vaU 16
ley, In the centre of which stood the mystk chateau There the Squire stopt, and turning to his master, besought him not to tempt hu rum by entering those dnadfal walls, lor that Michael had related circumstances respecting them which made his hair stand an end The Cavalier was chagrined that his Squire, whom he knew to be as valiant as loyal, shoul 1 be infected by so vague an apprt hennon, and he sharply rebuked th.· folly of his petition Michael then led them around, and they began to de scend by a gradual path hollowed into the earth The repulse Lrcolani had experienced, was not otherwise effectual on his fears, than to confound them with wonder at his master's presump tuous rashness, which he was convinced would come to an evil issue, as his steed stumbled, a mishap immediately received by the credulous rider for an infallible portent of ill Without misadventure they all reach·
ed the gates After a violent knocking, to which no notice was bestowed from within, they attempted to force them open, but their united efforts were un¬ availing, the fastenings being immove¬ able at length they paused to recover breath, and advise what further to un¬ dertake The local ignorance of the troop submitted to the dearly bought knowledge of the Cavalier, and they proceeded round the walls, in compii ance with his opinion, until they all came before that part of the structure whtiice he escaped there they stopt vet human figure or voice they nei the saw nor heard on any of the ram parts or towers, and but for the careful security of the port?!, they would have thought the place absolutely deserted I lancho retrograded a few paces, the bitter to view the whole extent of the wing by ascending a knoll a little irore distant, he overlooked the wall, and gliding his ryes from the buttress which

It was hideously disordered, the boards bang foully stained with blood; particularly in that part where he so nar¬ rowly had eluded assassination their iligpcimcss was increased by the gore, which (erved to guide the observant Ca-
valler; who, discriminating the stained footmarks according to their various directions, discxrvered the hidden door, before whieh the tapestry was redrawn; and forcing his passage, entered the mi¬ serable chamber. Preceded by the Ca¬ valier, the troop crossed it in profound silence, and proceeded along a dark ser¬ pentíne passage that brought them to the head of the corridor, half a doien paces beyond the bed-chamber door, wherethrough they all re-entered. The peasants being ignorant of what woeful business occasioned their journey thither, were lost in horror and amass¬ ment at what they witnessed; which the Italian no sooner heeded, than he dis¬ closed, as "oncisefy as his full heart would permit, all that was requisite to their understanding the spectacle that appalled them. He then snatched the helm of Henri from the corner where it was cast; invoked its master, and pre¬ sented it to tbe soldiers ; conjuring them,
as they regretted lus W, to persist In an undaunted research then adjusting it on his own head, he cricc 1 , that it ever had been used to ait as a beacon in the pursuit of honourable danger, and, at the head of the obedient party, ran down the corridor After an examination of numberltss apartments, naked ot human vestige, they struck do vn tht grand spi ral st ur-cast which tumulateti in tht second hall lli.it was dismal as tin rest, and the first signs of inhabitants, out of the upper chimbir, wire d)stin gui&hable in the apartmint, w herim the Italian had supt the preceding night There the hearth was not quite cold, but tht embers displayed no spark ot fire, and were rudely scatttred about An idea of their concealment started into Claudio's mind, which cherished it tor the most reasonable surmise of the conduit espoused by If e villains , and open to tht peril of a surprisa! by am- bushment, he cautioned his followers

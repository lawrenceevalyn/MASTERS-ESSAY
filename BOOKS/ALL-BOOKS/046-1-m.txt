He was appre¬ hensive that his seeming inattention would Call foHh her reproach, and 'lie dispatched a hurried epistle containing the fondest ex¬ pressions'of his attachment,* and breathed a tributary vow to her happiness.' " l '" ' Rosalviva had retired for the evening earlier than her usual hour, mortified
and vexed at the neglect, she had,met with—and in the confusion of jher ideas, she resolved to think less of one shfe con¬ sidered undeserving her. esteem ; and in tlie smile'of'a suitor more capable of ap¬ preciating her w r orth, she felt satisfied in discharging from her memory that of Leontini. Had the pure and hallowed flame of love ever lighted the bosom of Rosalviva, it would never have formed sentiments so decisive as the present. It was not that she mourned his absence, or that his total separation would have caused one sigh, or one tear; it w r as that she con¬ sidered her pride and magnified value but indifferently pi ized by him, on whom she had conferred her greatest esteem, and for whom she had forfeited the assi¬ duous overtures of others, who wonld have
doubtless repaid her with, more than corn-^ ???' fervency. » ■* v j* ft Fool'^ she exclaimed; *" that Ί· was,* thus to have secluded·; myself ifoi" one whose platonic soul· is so unmindful of the charms which numbers have aspired to in vain. But I will hazard its coldness no longer ; and as a proof of my freedom, tins night terminates the conference. ; ' It will at least teach him that the merits and attainments' of a being like Rosalviva are'not to be purchased with indifference." The latest moment expired in which he had sometimes visited the Castelli, and in the heat of her resentment she directed the subjoined communication :— ' ' Γ cannot but be sensible of the trifling situation I hold in your ebteem. The 'very frequent instances of your neglect, and ?ηγ^ subjection to the most painful disap-
pointments, have together broken that 'confidence I had reposed ; and to prevent a recurrence of the forfeiture of promises made by you, or my own unhappiness, you will consider this as the conclusion of a correspondence, yourself only can be blamed for, 1 ' • The astonitìliment of Leontini by the introduction of a messenger with Rosal¬ viva's letter, at an early hour, demanded an instant perusal—the effect of its con¬ tents is easily imagined. He prepared to defend the conduct un¬ der which he had been circumstanced ; but the susceptibility of his feeling's to the unmerited charge, was too painful to siifler him to proceed, and he determined per¬ sonally to endeavour to acquit himself, and soften the asperity of her decision. - He traversed one of the anti-rooms of
the Castelli with much disorder, before Rosalviva acknowledged his presence. He had no cause to dissimulate; he still re^ tained every feeling of his earliest ardour. 4 4 Rosalviva, " he tenderly pronounced, on her entrance—"can it be possible that the language dictated in this letter is the sentiment you would really acknowledge ; surely you have formed too rash an opi¬ nion of my character, or am I the victim of some malignant reptile, whose invidious purposes arc endeavoured to bc effected at the price of the misery of him who sincerely lovcb you. Such let me con¬ sider, (Rosalviva, to bc the incitement, lather than the genuine feeling of on eso amiable, so lovely as yourself." 44 Leontini," answered the heiress of di Romagno, "the ideal suggestion of a rival approaching, under the mask of a
'slanderer, you will '"suffer' me^'to remove; in' whatever 'respect my 'opinion* hás been conveyed 1 to you", it is exclusively my own. Υ?ίΊ caníiöt" be ignorant öf tlie 'trutlt'of its' assertion, 'anü :í m' its confession/ you may iii some measure restore, if not tlie affection, tlie credit due to a nobleman, and a man of honour. " : Leontmi replied at considerable length upon ' the : sincerity of his prbfesšioris, ad¬ ding, that circumstances alone, of which she was perfectly acquainted, ought suffi¬ ciently to plead in'mitigation'| and that 'in any shape wherein lie could offer atone¬ ment, it should be completed. " He attempted to engage the hand of Rosalviva; but her hauteur resisted the effort, and at his seeming embarrassment a triumphant smile lighted up her bold features.
• « < "Well, Signor / Leontini, for ,delicacy sake further interrpgation shall be avoided.

' Loud Byro4. An entertainment, given in honour ot the nuptials of a Sicilian nobleman, afford¬ ed the first interview with Leontini and the heiress of di Romagno. Its impres¬ sion was strong and powerful ; the amuse- s ments of the evening ceased to delight; him; he was thoughtful, and the more he gazed on the fine figure of Rosalviva, his attention and admiration became the more lasting.
. " Some friends of Leontini observed the charm under which he was bound ; .but to the lightness of their remarks, he re-" turned a coldness that ill accorded with his usual manner and friendship. The stature of Leontini was below tlie, middle height, but accurately formed. A kind of stern decision marked Ins features;' but gloomy as they would occasionally ap¬ pear, there- was still many a sunny tint of warm and pleasing generosity that' beamed in its lighter shade. His attacliment for Rosalviva gradually' increased. Her lightness of disposition' would at intervals afflict him ; but he had at length arrived at the satisfaction that he lived secure in her affection, and he supported the temporary separation diir¬ ing her stay at Messina, with sensations * of mingled gratification'and felicity. ? 2
He had twice perused a letter from Rosalviva, some few weeks after her ar¬ rival at her friends, written' in the pure language or affection and expressions of sincerity, when the entrance of a domestic broke upon his pleasing meditations, and presenting a billet, carefully folded, with¬ drew. Leontini was not acquainted with the characters of the em elope, and tearing it open, he read, " a hiend to the Signor Leontini, in respect ior his character and worth, embraces the piesent moment of ■"'' 1 signifying that the Signora Rosalviva has this instant quitted Messina; an assignà- tion made in the cloisters of the Castel á Marri, within the hearing of the writer, Off u^ r» t , ft ¡ íf t snrnmoned his closer observance, and"as a warning to the Signor Leontini, in the case of confidence, this communication is submitted."
Tlie astonishment of Leontini was pain- i ( lb . ·* H, ^ jf fully excited. He glanced upon the com¬ munication of Rosalviva, bearing the prê- vious day's date ; and after some few •'' Muffii tt, ? »«. j.i moments of reflection, he uttered, amidst the -contest of his feelings, *' Rosalviva is innocent; she could not so betray, so - 7jj . . f deceive her Leontim—obscure and villify- ing wretch, that would pollute her name, I treat thy attempt with the scorn it de- serves." And at the same instant he destroyed the letter of his unknown cor- ..'.í'. ' í respondent, with implicit satisfaction. tfc Rosalviva will never inflict the smallest wound, or sacrifice the heart that has vowed to love her," recurred to his re- membrance with increasing assurances in behalf of her fidelity, and his reply to her epistle was fraught with all the ardour of a lieart doting on the object of its enthusiasm. c3
An elapse of several days moved on with increased anxiety on the mind of Leontim". No communication had he received from Rosalviva. The instance of his unknown correspondent, apd which he had treated with contempt, appealed somewhat ear¬ nestly to his credulity as to the truth of its intelligence. He. perused the several letters in his possession from Rosalviva /lu¬ ring their intimacy, iu each was breathed a language progressively ardent and af¬ fectionate ; lie meditated on her belm iour towards him ; he reviewed the various iib stances of her peculiar inquiry and sym¬ pathy which she had manifested fer him. Her manner had always been disinterested and genuine. Why she could .have hekl forth that show of regard which she liad, why she could have concealed' her aflec-, tions for another, aud yet have exchanged
with his, was alike mysterious. The proud and lofty soul of Rosalviva he considered as too superior to admit of, or hazard reproach. She had frequently given him proof of her contempt, at advancements and concbct that were coloured with the sh'ghtest dishonour. Independently he-knew that her will was decisive ; she lived under no control ; lier own authority, to her own inclination was only liable—few ventured ίο oppose it. V, hy then she should have stooped to so pityable an act of duplicity was the utter surprise of Leontini. lie still treated tho idea of her capability of falsehood with indignance. it could not be possible, nor would he entertain a thought that appertained to her dishonour, líe composed'his mental agitation with the belief, that the hwrry of engagements had precluded her írom embracing the length

" Leontini was for the moment confused at the singularity of the affair ; and de- ; .sirous of a closer interview with his com¬ municant, ; he retired sonie few paces, where the light of the portico lamps was inore vivid.

It was not the heat and enthusiasm of boyhood that taught him to bow to the throne of her beauty; it was a progressive and earnest attachment brought on by incessant oppor- . tunity—by the strict sense of honour and_ sincerity that seemed to guide her mind and. principles ; and by all her'pleasing endearments and assiduous endeavours to obtain his smile, and sense of happiness;. ????* years had: elapsed since he had
taken his last farewell of Viola de Morini» wheri hè received tlie communication from her under the fictitious title of Millezzani. Viola had perceived the brink which the hurry of her irksome existence had thrown her upon. It was reviewed in all its dis¬ gust and sadness; and'evei y succeeding day brought with it her further disquie¬ tude. Viola had been intioduccd, at the early part of her alliance, to a portion of splen- _ dour and entertainment, and which for a time diverted—at least it helped to frus¬ trate those recollections which horn s of solitude are too apt to sketch. Up ( to a certain time, those enjoyments that Viola participated in were anxiously promoted by her husband;—they were at length tetlious to 'him—her comfoits became the least of his thoughts, and at last w eie
wholly disregarded. At this stage of her alliance she had but attained her twenty second year. At a public festival, where Viola with reluctance had consented to be present, and that only at the earnest entreaty of a valued friend, was announced, some time .after its·commencement, the Signor ï .contini and the Comptessa Rosalviva. Viola heard the name of her former lover. »She saw r the attention with which he escorted ihe »Signora Rosalviva. lier feel¬ ings with poignancc acknowledged the senti¬ ment her heart still retained for him ; and unable to endure their conflict, she pleaded indisposition, and hurried to her abode. The anguish of past events, tlie idea that preyed on her mind of her present misery, and' the happiness of Leontini, alternately pressed wiihin her bosom. She felt a de-
sire once more to see him—to converse with him—to question his felicity—to mark if he still respected her memory. Various thoughts collectively rushed upon her mind, and she felt determined to discover their reality. She frequented numerous resorts, in the hope of his presence ; but a period of sonie months witnessed her ill success. Her per¬ severance was not to be defeated ; and its success at length brought her to the height of her wishes. The name of Millezzani she knew was uot familiar to him, and with its aid she effected her endeavours. Leontina again perused the epistle—his heart abounded with loo much of sym¬ pathy to withhold the tribute due to her 1 remembrance, and to the sufferings of Viola its influence gave a tear.
Ile returned a few lines to Viola, in token of his sense of her confidence. The tiame evening h& undertook to be with her, and conformable to his promise he met once again the woman of his * * first love." It needs no art to sketch the effect of such a meeting—it requires not language to tJI the rapture of such a moment, to those who have known the feeling of love —to those who have borne a separation, and which time has rendered its reality only the moro susceptible—it is witli facility imagined the present sensations of Leontini and Viola di Morini. Through hours of painful silence she had wept the lotó of a Leontini—she had wept over the correspondence of happier days; and even when her husband was unmind¬ ful of her .happiness, she had welcomed
no other solace but the indulgence of so¬ litude, and to bring back the remem¬ brance of the past,' ihr with jt was im¬ pressed the careases and affection oí" her Leoni iui. So much ' had ' she 'ehcrkhcd tlie pang which was rapidly undermining her existence, that at the period of her communication with Leontini, sorrow and oppression had so altered her "fair form," that it seemed but a desolate wreck oí' that which it once had been. Leontini had equally suffered during the intercourse; it had nearly cost him a life that was already " drooping ' into lethargy and debility. The banner "of lus country waved with conquest—he £ew to it with ardour ; and in the path leading to glory he hoped to forget all liis wret¬ chedness. Fame had seemingly marked his efforts for her own, and in the thickest vol. i. 1)
of danger his valour was successful. From a stranger in the ranks of military enthu¬ siasm, he acquired "a leaders name." The shores of Sicily echoed with the praises of its heroes, and the name of Leontini was not pronounced but with acclamations of applause. Palermo hailed lier repeliera of the Moorish invasion with ardour, and in the esteem of its inhabitants, Leontini held a prominent feature, and for some time his mind and spirits enjoyed a seasonable tranquility. Rosalviva, too, the envied heiress of Di Romagno smiled upon him, and when sensible of the weakness that attended the regret at Violas loss—sensible that she was irrevocably in the possession of an¬ other, and probably happy, he endea¬ voured to prize the opportunity that
might render him equally so ; and in .the favours of Rosalviva di Cardoni, lie, liad partly realized his wishes—'this then was his situation, and thus was .-formed 5 the outline of his heart, when the presence of Viola di Morini claimed lus remembrance. He embraced her respectfully—he, could not look upon her with indifference, though the image of Rosalviva filled her place hi iiis bosom. Several moments expired before either ventured to break the silence. 44 Leontini," she sobbing ly exclaimed, 44 Ous is a painful meeting, prudence ought to have spared me its anguish; hut, however great may be its reprehen¬ sion, it ought to merit forgiveness."— Tears followed the confession of,Viola, and she indulged in their relief, supported İn tlie arms of Leontini.

Leontini would have retired—but she eagerly caught his hand. " Leontini, this is a moment I have prayed for, long have studied to obtain ; do not, if you ever loved e me, do not leave d3

' '' The present separation with the stran¬ ger was a period which the'Comptessa would willingly have prolonged ; but the opposition to such a wish was implicit.
She had .reached the residence of her friend, and prudence withheld further communication. He assisted her from the ; vehicle/it y^as a moment that wa.s to. divide her from an, intelligence she might profit.by—it would not admit of. an entire ã .forfeiture,, and without further apology, she intimated that on the suc¬ ceeding ¡evening ? she should pass the Strado di Voli,· towards tha residence of one of her friends. The stranger comprehended the tenor . of the information^ and pressing her hand to his lips, whispered that his family were noble, Jus fortune princely, and that, the .endowments f of his ancestry were added to the most illustrious of record. Rosalviva numbered with anxiety the moments that noted the timeJ" of 'her passing the Strado di Voli, and she hur-
ried to tlie spot; disguise was no longer requisite, for in the stranger's ' mask of- the j previous' ' 'evening · stood * the ! j Conte Gömerim * ¡ - 1 ' - ^ ^·' J ' »"«»- '' " Ibeir' Meetings were ^ frequent·, and to every scene of ^public assembly í the>Contè i Golfieri was ? her devoted 'ciceroni.

The proceedings which daily occurred at the Castelli di Romagno he was not, ignorant of. Matters seemed to proceed, in the same course for a considerable length of time ; t but what added to the^ surprise of Leontini was, that no appear¬ ance, of a suitor to.the hand of Rosalviva was discoverable; and-no persons had marked-the preference of her esteem to^ one individual more than another.

Napbli was the favorite protege of the old Conte d i'Cardoni'; and'the respect ]>aid to him during her father's existence she was not inclinable to discard ; and if his* pretensions and T behaviour' bordered upon the extreme 'of folly and insignifi¬ cancy *the»·* wa& j a show of splendour in his equipage, a supremacy in his entertain¬ ments, and a magnificience in his general appearance, which far exceeded either of
the nobles of Palermo, and which Rosai- viva could at all times- definitively' com¬ mand. ' '' * it was considered indispensable, since that the solemnity due to the memory of Cardoni had expired, that the title deeds and inheritance of the domain should be consigned from the care of the Padre Vivaldi, to the legal and full possession of tlie Comptessa Rosalviva, The Padre was waited upon for tlie discharge of his trust; and by the wish of Rosalviva he attended the Castelli. Tlie Monk bowed from his erect posture in lowly submission to her person, as lie was introduced ; and in a tone of reverential dignity, pronounced on her a blessing. The character and person of Vivaldi was never social to the esteem of Ro¬ salviva. There was an imperative and
mysterious carriage that ever accompanied lus demeanour, which to a female mind was far from gaining prepossession ; and before her ideas had formed themselves in correctness of discrimination, the dispo¬ sition and terms of friendship offered to lier by Vivaldi, were by no means wel¬ comed or acceptable» Since that she liad attained the age of maturity, the Monk had rendered his subservience to her rank more practicable—and appeared to regard it with thè humility which she felt ought to be paid to her inheritance. Thè tall figure of the Monk, habited in the sombre garment of his order, had re¬ tired in silent deVotion to a recess of the apartment where the portrait óf Cardoni was suspended. The impressive stillness of the moment tended to convey a "throb of unpleasant
feeling hi' the bosom öf the Comptessa, and .which the advanced hour, f and r the ob¬ scurity f of the apartment, appeared to (in¬ crease. ' ' ' ? ? " · '·* ur' The Padre, bent»to < the paintings of ^ his late master, and Rosalviva waited during an elapse of many moments, whilst he,in¬ wardly murmured a prayer of invocation.) "The subject, reverend father, which required your attendance, " spake Rosal¬ viva, impatient at the loneliness of his mood, " liad better be deferred until an earlier hour on the morrow, since the lateness of the evening will prohibit the conference requisite." , * . , ..< " The duties of my holy office/ daugh¬ ter," replied the Monk, ashe approached towards her in respectful obedience* ?&??? too numerous and too imperyiousnto,Jje disregarded ; it is therefore only at a' time fike the present, when those avocations
EOSALVÏVA. havé ceased,' that Ί can bestow leisure tand opportunity tb merit the confidence of that part of the community, which I : trust I may number the Comptessa with J my friends. ' I would'hazard much; beauteous Rosalviva, to complete thine. 'Tis yet some two hours till midnight, and'much may be discussed in that* period—name 'then, daughter, thy wishes." * ' The Comptessa hesitated, 'there was a familiarity and'a consequence in 'lus mari¬ ner that she did not .expect, still she. could have nothing to apprehend. , . > t K Turning to the'Padre, she observed, */at'tlie decease of .my lamented parent, the documents- of his estates and my claims, were vested in your authority and -possession ; at least that of the , holy brotherhood, of which.you are the ]prin- - cipal, until the arrangements of the funeral VOL. i. E
rites had been performed, and until what¬ ever incumbrances wliich have accrued should be discharged." " Yes, fair daughter, your memory is good; until the incumbrances should be discharged."' "Time and obedience have fulfilled such bequests/ 5 , spoke Rosalviva, not al¬ together mindful of the hurried voice of the Monk, * ' and the holy and honourable charge of the father Vivaldi, it is my in¬ tention now to cancel. 1 ' " Indeed, 1 ' murmured Vivaldi and his dark eye was raised in earnest look to Heaven, ' ' that were a task, my daughter, ï shall be pleased to witness the completion of; but those incumbrances ?? not cleared, nor is it in your present power to get them cancelled." Rosalviva was astonished, she could
scarcely give credence to w hat she heard, she shuddered to think that some dark purpose was in agitation; but ad\ erting instantly to the functions of the confessor, she conceived that he doubtless retained an erroneous idea of their arrangement, and a hasty opinion was the result; she im¬ parted the nature of her belief to Vivaldi. His enunciation of her credulity was in¬ stantly opposed to the remark, and his voice, accompanied with a half suppressed smile, repeated his previous suggestion ; adding—" I can assure you, daughter, there is much to be done before the domain of Romagno rests peaceably in the posses¬ sion of the Comptessa Rosalviva." For some moments the heiress of Di Romagno was absorbed in a painful silence. She meditated upon what possible ground an opposition could be made in justice to l 2
her claims ; and as her reflections· deepened, she felt the more convinced that the views and intentions of the Padre were injurious to her rights: :md in the enthusiasm of her imagination upon liis baseness, she resolved to defeat liis attempt of persuading her as to the illegality uf her heritage — she challenged him to produce whatever man¬ date that authorized his immediate denial of her property ; and declared, unless it was restored to her, every document com¬ mitted to liis care by the Conte di Cardoni —the decrees of her tribunal bhould- en¬ force it, and bring down disgrace and iu- fainy.upon every brother of the order allied to VI valdi. " This may appear probable," an¬ swered Vivaldi, who h:.il calmly listened to her vehement h:irang:.e, "but you will repent the application, Comptessa ; take
counsel, and profit by it: be satisfied in the indulgence of your present luxuries, and seek not to enthral the memory, and let me add, the poverty of your depen¬ dance.'' The injunction of % r ivahli sounded mys¬ teriously upon the ear of Rosalviva ; the emphasis whicli he applied to the words poverty of lier dependance, was singularly impressive, and his expression of features at the same instant, was equally for¬ bidding. The haggard, but stern menace of countenance, the angry flash of terror that his-eye conveyed, and the infuriated tone of voice, severally struck upon the mind of Rosalviva a severe and fatal pre¬ sentiment ; and much as her spirits were usually buoyant, their solidity felt a shock at the sudden and strange evidence of the confessor Vivaldi. > l 3
"J* I should not be wanting," rejoined the" Monk, * ' in rendering assistance to facilitate the utmost of your wishes—and moreover to shield you from the lash of adversity, did occasion require it. But ï cannot, in duty to the last words of the late Conte, in compliance too with the holiness of our Order, and with my sense of moral and religious obligation, willing¬ ly be the instrument for the indulgence of your vices." ** Vices," interrupted Rosalviva. * t The term may appear harsh, daughter, hut I am not ignorant to what excess youthful passions will dive * into when rushing upon the wide stream of pleasure ; without an arm to direct, without a Warn¬ ing voice to impede. In the whirlpool of fleeting enjoyment, the mind is easily drawn from objects that demand the more
grave and tranquil obedience, and the performance of a duty degenerates into a task so irksome, that the burden is gladly thrown from our endurance ere we pause to reflect on the probable enormity of the act. Setting aside, fair daughter, the frail¬ ties attachable to the weakness of thy sex, you must bear in mind that tliere exists a promise, nay, an oath, it is registered in the volume of eternity ; which forfeits the fulfilment of the genial ties of nature in the sworn determination of avenging the insulted remains of your deceased parent. You must not suffer to slumber the in-> junction of liis dying moments ; you must not idly pass over the continued species of malevolence and reprehension, that slanders the name and rank of Cardoni. «The Conte predicted its blighting voice,
nor was his prophecy grounded on p fiction. You, Rosalviva, are ignorant ofj its ^real terror, and equally unable to combat its wrath., It is said „that the cause which terminated with the assassination of the Conte was not that of accident, but ori¬ ginating from a dispute persisted in by Cardoni, and that so forcibly, that rather than suffer his authority, to meet Opposi¬ tion, he determined on the rum of his aggressor. It was accomplished, but the offspring of the fallen party, indignant at the crime and injury sustained, publicly accused the Conte of the atrocity. Words ensued, their quarrel was heated mali¬ cious; strength aud superior skill prevailed, and thus was vanquished the instigator of the broil, Reo Cardoni." ** False «and calumniating assertion,"
vehemently uttered the Comptessa, "and tomlus tdle r devout confessor thou hast ■ïistenedT ' ? ' " Appearances, alas! daughter, un¬ happily cany with them conviction in the present instance." * J ' ' « And hast th ou, »Padre Vivaldi, ' ' warm¬ ly spoke Rosalviva, unmindful of the con¬ fessor's latter remark,—'* also forgotten the pledge of assurance made at the same couch of my departing parent. ' * " Of what nature ?" hastily questioned the Monk, "That of thy faith on the innocence and honour of the Conte of Cardoni." » " I should have staked all I possessed in life against the dissimulation of a Cardoni at that period ; but I have since learned <the fatality of human confidence—but argument hke the present is better avoided, n 5
'daughter ;■ you have the means of attaining rpeace, and obeying the hequests' of \your- parent. It is 'given you simply- in ? the solicitation,! that you bend your knee to the-throne, of Providence, there supplicate 1 his commanding aid to bring to· light the -assassin of your parent. Rosalviva, this advice must not be ridiculed, >as youvalue ithe righteousness, and'forgiveness ofthat God to whom 1 you bend, reject, not the «counsels of one who gains little by deceiv¬ ing thee,*' and thereby suffer me toem- hlazon the rectitude and acquiescence of -.thy heart in characters that shall 4 be <exalted through the remotest genera¬ tions." > -TheConfessor paused, and taking .the fhand 'of Rosalviva, made the sign of ithe Moly Cross on her breast, whilst Jiis lips «acknowledged a benison.
i 'No'reply was offered by the Comptessa, tno resistahce.marked the detention of her 'hand, which <was still in that of Vivaldi's ; yshe was silent, save the brightness of her «eye, and the fixed and settled ^countenance, wliich ? fully indicated the wandering of 'her mental faculty j * >- * r The Padreimotioned to 'depart, and in¬ timating his 'intention of returning to the Palazzi on the forth-coming· evening, he concluded-with—"retire, my daughter, to the repose of thy chamber—reflect upon the value of my counsels, and the, beams of the morning shall bring with it conso¬ lation and happiness." í The Confessor quitted the apartment, ;and as-his hollow foot-steps resounded along the outer corridores, they conveyed back a new and strange feeling towards the object. She would have indulged, in
an' :apathy whichít had· ■ hitherto íbeen »??"» 'knotyn'to: her,' and the more she ruminated uponï*flie ¡remarks of Vivaldi, the more susceptibly ¡w r ás' her mind receding into a, languor, that í she- seemed ill calculated to support'; 'she called to v memory the last bequest jof her parent,, she .retraced her vow ;made ??' ln*s> dying pillow—it might have,, in ithe effervescence of lier youth and gaiety, gradually ¡obliterated itself without knowing,its importance ; but she now felt that jt was re-kindled, she felt that ex¬ clusive of her own anxiety and resolution to avenge the ill fated death of the Conte —there was a spirit more impelling than her own,whose agency appeared to pursue with alacrity the hope that would lead to the perpetrators of the deed ; she had al- Teady consulted her admirer Golfieri— she *had purposed to offer large rewards for thè

• " And where is the Signora Viola*?" he tremulously exclaimed, to an interest¬ ing female who was in attendance. r „ "The Signora , quitted Palermo,this morning early—from the nature of a com- munication she received last nighty her departure was of immediatenecessity.'' ; ** And the direction of her route," en¬ quired Leontini, who had eagerly glanced over the tenor of her Jetter. " Alas ! Signor, I am ignorant, poor dear lady, her heart was so full of anguish and her agitation so apparent, that I had much difficulty in restraining my own sorrows from keeping pace with her's." Leontini's several interrogatories /were but simply answered, but they were marked with so much candour and artless- ness, that the possibility of being fraught vol. ι. ρ
with any meaning but that of sincerity was instantly ¡dismissed. The. epistle merely solicited the for¬ giveness òf Leontini, stating that reasons which might at some distant period be revealed, .commanded her absence;, she conjured him to believe that his image would ever be nearest his heart—she in- treated his confidence to their recent in¬ terview, and intimated the hope of being eventually a contributor to liis happiness. The accompanying stanzas were seem¬ ingly executed iu much taste; 1 they were not submitted with the accuracy of re¬ finement and study, but disclosing more the purity and language of her breaking heart. , , Then '? a ple.isure in tlmiUtiji on «lays gone by,- TW the tlioftglit alone bl U Γι to elicer us; Theresa f »loa sure in Iumhii:,' tlir pensive sigh, Tobliadcs ihat once «tre Ulov'd, ond urar us,

The variety of sensations that alter¬ nately swayed the bosom of Leontini, were more acute than expression could pourtray; his smiling look, lus manly form, contrasted with the motionless and sullen statue of despair, ,can readily ex¬ cite a feeling oí deepest commiseration in the heart of those w ho haye felt the throb of ardent love. He was not sensible to the belief that a meeting with Viola could have created such interest—he was less so that her loss would leave so cruel an afflic¬ tion; yet those few moments whicli he had passed with her the previous evening, had unquestionably excited him to the ut¬ most warmth and admiration. He knew that love for him had brought with it all her sufferings ; he knew how long she¡¡had wept in sorrow and sadness, andfhe.was the spectator of the forlorn wreck to which
the cherislung of such love had reduced her. He was convinced that no artifice had been used to render the melancholy picture moie desolate, he was convinced that no'motive of interest had· led to the interview—he felt'assured that the un¬ subdued flame of affection had lighted her onwards, though its momentary blaze should even destroy with its brightness. These assurances appealed more sensi¬ tively to the softer feelings of nature, and lie contemplated on their fatality in the most painful reverie ; he viewed the path that was only open to' his tread, it was dark and comfortless—there was no gleam that could cheer him on to emulation and delight—there was no star that would set to the splendour of his happiness, all the sweet delusion of hope and gladness had withered—he knew that few human beings
ani ved at the age of feeling, but had some* pleasing wish—some charm in existence' that inspired the heart and mind with« heroism', virtue, and sensibility. He knew) no" bosom contained a heart so cold ' and í sceptical,' as not to feel a spontaneous glow < towards the attributes of woman's love.*. Yes/ all mankind had some interest that strengthened unity ; but lie felt proscribed, í and careless to its tie—there was no human being that he wished to bind the hand of friendship with ; he cared not to know of it. Rosalviva had blighted his confidence and his hopes, and what few embers the presence of Viola had re-kindlfedj 'were > now faded, and extinguished for ever.' ^ ji These were his reflections, these < were the' í melancholy train of'thoughts 'that '(•rowdeb/iipon his förlora heartj * v · « ìlnU He had not passed over many moments
in the recognition of his solitude, when lie was aroused by the cries of danger, and from are mote corner of the street he per¬ ceived two 'men .dragging the jbody of a monk, whoac struggles contended hard against the completion of their purposev- that minder was its purport, Leontini held no doubt. Tho suggestion demanded his courage and intciference, and without fur¬ ther hesitation, he rushed immediately : to the spot. " For the love of God and humanity, preserve me, stranger" faintly exclaimed a monk, ? still in the grasp of lus adversaries. Leontini drew his sword, and closing a despeiate thrust in the arm of one of the assassins, caused his instant retreat. The other being exempt from any extraordinary skill or resolution, resigned his burden, and
liurried away towards the direction of lus companion. * Leontini found that the priest had re- e ived a slight wound in the breast—he staunched the blood which flowed copious¬ ly, and procuring assistance, had him con¬ veyed to the convent of his order. The wound was not dangerous, and after its examination, Leontini was about to depart. " The Padre would return thanks for thy care," cried one of the fathers.— *'Yes, worthy Signor," added Vivaldi, (who had been the object of attack) to my latest hour I have to acknowledge thee my preserver." Leontini bowed in silence, and testified his satisfaction of being instrumental in de¬ feating the designs of the assassins. '
The Padre extended his hand to meet that ofiLcontini. < A lamp that burned in a corner of the cell, emitted but a faint and uncertain light. , A lay-brother re¬ vived its flame, and obeying, the motion of Vivaldi, passed the light »across ??? coun¬ tenance of Leontini, which^\as directed to that of the Padre. , ¡ - 4 ' Jesu Maria !" he momentarily exclaim¬ ed, and an icy dampness took possession of h is limbs; his voice faultered, and ?\ ith a look of strange, but enquiring meaning, he sunk down upon the pallet. Leontini beheld the change of liis features w ith asto¬ nishment; his hand was still grasped,by Vivaldi. ? One of the monks who had wit¬ nessed the emotion of the superior, urged him to signify the cause of his discom¬ posure.* i'gpeak," cried he, "¡mid if sorrowfully, that it may be alleviate^T-
these bewildering flights of imagination, Signor, (turning to Leontini) are not un¬ common, you will therefore"— " Oh no, my senses are no longer bewildered," interrupted Vivaldi—"'tis real, 'tis real ; in him is marked the re¬ membrance of Isadora too powerfully to he deceived. Speak, young man—your name, your family ; but I am not- de- 'ceived." The irregular expression and vehement manners of the Padre was mysterious to the mind of Leontini, and for an elapse of some moments he was unable to reply. " Speak, boy, thy name!—'tis"— The Monk paused in expectation of the definition — "'tis Leontini," bowed the Signor. "Yes, Leontini di Nicolenzi," •eagerly added the superior—" my son any son."
A stupi fy ing lethargy for some mo¬ ments bound up the tenses of Leontini. The voice of Vivaldi awakened him.— **I. ook up, my boy—look up, and give new life to thy no longer dejected paient." * ' Mave I, indeed, rescued from assas¬ sination the author of my existence," so¬ lemnly rejoined Leontini, and directing his look to heaven, added, "benignant Pro¬ vidence, t hat has given to ?? at once a friend and a father." Leontini embraced the superior with duteous respect. íle was anxious for the intelligence of his father's narrative, and to learn from what cause he had lived until this moment in ignorance of his being in existence, lie expressed his hope that he might be in immediate possession of its several particulars. The brother, who was in attendance,
withdrew ; and Leontini fastened the door of the apartment. Vivaldi, desirous of communicating the varied incidents of his past life, thus commenced :— " At the age of twenty-one I was united to the daughter of a valued friend, with whom I possessed every species of wealth and felicity, and for several months I knew uo pang of sorrow or disquietude. The termination of the year, however, depriv¬ ed me of my respected parent. By his decease I became inheritor of property to a considerable amount. Due respect was paid to his memory, and in the smiles of my wife, and the anticipation of becoming a father, I was not rendered wholly dis¬ consolate at his loss. My Isadora gave birth to the offspring who this night, by the all-wise decree of Providence is re¬ stored to me." The Confessor wiped
away ,a, trickling « tear, and. gazing full upon the features of Leontini, again pro¬ ceeded :— '\ßut ? God, at what a price, and what suffering was the summit of my wishes realized ; by a 'forfeiture of a life dearer to me than mine own, by· the sacri¬ fice of that of Isadora's. " My mother," exclaimed Leontini. " Yes, boy, in a few hours subsequent to thy first breath of life, her's was no more. With scarcely a struggle, she re¬ signed her soul to the call of her maker. To the being like myself, whose heart and existence was cemented with the partner of his fortunes, it required a fortitude but few can command. Dissolved as I was, from every hope, from every blessing ; the qua¬ lity of that mind, the goodness of that heart, the sensibility of soul, and the warmth of affection, I lost with her, hung
with such weight t upon my imagination, tliat for some considerable time-the eíForts of the most skilful men were opposed, and tended towards the restoration of my Kh¬ mer tranquillity ; but I had too deeply im¬ pressed on my poor wíl hering heart the image of Isadora—every change, both of time and place, brought with it her form— her look—her dying look—the last blush of health that tinged-her cheek, dispersing itself for the pallid hue of death, was ever before my eye; and oft was I seen in earnest attention to catch the ideal sound of the last words she uttered to me ; iu silence and in solitude, through my cares by day, and my dreams of night, the me¬ mory pursued me ; had I been wholly left to its influence, I should have inevitably fallen its victim ; the only relation I was possessed of watched my sorrows with
unremitting care, and ultimately succeed¬ ed in-separating me from the spot where I had cherished my miseries. Under the charge 1 and protection of this friend you were left, while I endeavoured to seek relief in ïhe bustle and socialities of other simres. " A small province in the south of Italy was my retreat, and in the nume¬ rous circles of splendour and gaiety with which I associated, I »was diverted in some measure from that constant gloom and dejection ; but here too 1* suffered. I had not long singled out one of my fellow men, with whose stamp and cha*· racter I was prepossessed, ere my cre^- 4İulity lost me the whole of my fortune, and 5 by the perfidy of my assumed friend, I found myself a beggar: yes, Leontini, tlie whole of my property was in. his
liancis —one roof had for some time shel¬ tered us, I entrusted him with 1 my confi¬ dence, and in an unguarded'moment*he plundered me of every article ■ thafr was, convertible to cash and of value: All the horror bf wretchedness and despair rushed before me, and only one bleak scene of desolation presented itself. ! - - > ■ " The detail'of. my misfortunes I com¬ municated to the protector of my boy,- J, commended to his guiding hand the safety of a Leontini ; it was not my wish to hear his reply—I waited not for it, but hastily quitted the province that had familarized me with trouble,and beggary, and again £et forth upon the world an unknown and heedless adventurer. It would be painful to bring forward the catalogue of a series .of ' hardships and oppressions that I felt .through a lapse of many years. * - , ?

understood, that on the hour he named, I wás in waiting for his summons. He en¬ tered, accompanied by a menial, securing my door—"Di Borji," said he, "mark this man—he is your companion and part¬ ner in the services I require 5 of you, and taking the arm of the coarse masculine figure beside him, he presented 'him to 'me. The'red glare of the f fire threw its light upon the features of niy new com¬ panion, and those of my employer; the orie was rude and disfigured, those of the Signor were wrought with much expres¬ sion, and'commanding much diversity of character." " On your ronte, Strom¬ boli) here, will give you your lesson, heed îf well ; and be mindful that one more in¬ terested will regard its valne:" Thus èaying, hé' motioned to depart, and follow¬ ing- the' steps of my comrade, we were
soón in the public streets; it-was at the corner of one of them that we loitered. . During our stay, I learned from Strom- bolo, that our employer was the young Conte Golfieri." u Conte Golfieri, " repeated the agitated Leontini, in an expression of surprise and horror. 44 Yes, Signor, and the intended vic¬ tim of his wrath, the Padre Vivaldi." "MercifulOmnipotence!" exclaimed the father, and he again marked the sign their holy faith. 4 £ I need not further describe that event, Signor, you well know its sequel." The life of the assassin was nearly ex¬ hausted; Leontini had taken the minutes of his last confession ; to its substance was added the tremulous signature of· Di Borji. Vivaldi interceded with his God
for his pardon, and white yet in the act of administering alleviation, he heaved one heavy sigh, and with it fled the remains of guilt and repentance.—Vivaldi was too affected to muse upon the incident;, he committed his peace to the care of Provi¬ dence, and embracing Leontini, retired, to his couch. Orders had been given for the prepara¬ tion of a principal chamber for the recep¬ tion of Leontini, and to its solitude and reflection he consigned himself.

city and piety, and upon the noblest and most strict foundation of rectitude were hist principles formed. The death of the partner of his affection, and with whom he had derived every pos¬ sible happiness, caused a sudden and sin* gular change in the mind and disposition of Napoli —he was no longer the en lnr and social character nature had seemingly stamped—he shunned those societies where his presence had ever been revered—he avoided those friends who appeared to feci his grief, and wished to console him ; and the mmd and genial virtues that had hitherto adorned lus manner, were ex¬ changed for the churlish and reserved lia· bits of one who liad .renounced the admoni¬ tion and sympathies of every tiling that en¬ deavoured to offer luna relief. He had long ceased to mix with the " bustling,world,"
and in a life of seclusion within the walls of his own palace, his broken spirit and irrit¬ able temper seemed to have free range. Paoli Golfieri, nephew to the Duke, was his nearest and only kindred, and by the earnest desire of the late Duchessa, (who having no issue) the young Paoli was re¬ ceived and educated as their own. To the elegant and prepossessing figure of Golfieri, whicli was pourtrayed in an agreeable sta¬ ture, was engrafted a mind of peculiar qua¬ lities, and which had shewn itself even in his infantine years. Amongst the numerous companions, and young noblemen who were classed as his associates at the ducal palace, the disposition to controlli over them was eminently manifest;—there was a vivid spark of ambition and design about ' him " that materially differed from those in liis friendship, and though he mingled in their
pursuits, and attached himself to their ha¬ bits, there was an artful enthusiasm that prompted him beyond a common enterprize. These were the traits of an early character which maturity made the more ardent and striking;—his strong inclination and desire for the love of gaming was attained the moment he had arrived to that fortune and property which at the termination of his minority was his inheritance. To its pro¬ pensities he was nearly the fatalist, when the intermediate grasp of Leontini snatched him from the impending ruin. From that moment friendship had cloaely allied him to the interests and welfare of Leontini, and he felt a gratitude for the disinterested service he was sensibly aware of having re¬ ceived at his hands. Their interests and happiness became mutual, and there was at length no pleasure, or no pursuit, but theirs was an equal participation.
With the correspondence of Leontini to Rosalviva, circumstances at times render¬ ed the confidence of Paoli necessary,—he was entrusted with it, and as the friend of Leontini lie was received by the Comptessa with all the respect due to his character. But the interview with Rosalviva was fatal to that friendship ; and in defiance to every rigid moral sentiment, his once firm and unsullied principles yielded to a passion which was nncontrolablc, and with the possession of Ro&alviva only could that pas¬ sion become abated, it was the first feel¬ ing that woman's excellence had created,. —it was too vivid to be extinguished with facility. lie cherished an immediate regard for her—he envied the choice and felicity of hib friend, and in the heat of his sensi¬ bility, his mind was hurried into a forget* fulness of that honour which had been pledged between them. There was every
charm in Rosalviva that tended to delight him,—there was not a moment iu her pre¬ sence thathe did not feel himself awakened to every delightful transport—its inspiration was not to be vanquished, and each suc¬ ceeding interview bound him the more for¬ cibly in the power of her reverence and adoration. lie marked with intense acute¬ ness of passion her esteem for Leontini, but his imagination was too much upon the alert to discourage his hopes of obtain¬ ing her esteem—be already had an oppor¬ tunity of judging by her disposition and manner the buoyancy of her soul, and his penetration led him to believe its similitude with the opinion of an admired w r ritet> Rochefoucault, "There is no art which can long hide love where it is, nor feign it where it is not." He shaped her lightness Of heart and warmth of disposition, into a
familiarity and an attachment by wliich he counted largely on the profit ; such then was the mind and ideas of the man in whom was reposed the confidence of Leontini. Leontini had studied many of tlie'cha¬ racters in the catalogue of human life,— he had initiated himself with the extravagan¬ cies and- weaknesses of their nature, and had contemplated on the irregular depra¬ vity which the heart invariably falls into '—he viewed it with pity and horror; but such feelings were not in sociality with his friend, and the fcrveney of his alliance in honour and estimation towards him, caused him to neglect the strict examina¬ tion of thobe qualities in common with the rent of mankind. The appointments which at length committed the Comptessa to his attention, Paoli was not unmindful of. ------ Rosalviva on the same hand was enlivened
with his vivacity; she w r as animated and instructed by his cheerful and engaging manner. The various pleasing and glowing attributes of ( his nature elicited her warm¬ est admiration, and she failcd nót' 'tó en¬ courage a more than usual mark of friend- ship and respect. She perceived how ma¬ terially the habits and opinions of Leontini differed with those of'Golfieri,—she felt the natural reserve attached to Leontini's conduct,—she considered him too; less communicative, and at eveiy interval of reflection she found her disposition and wishes yield more towards the Conte Paoli than. to his, mistaken friend. It was not to be supposed that with'such" a character Roaalviva could for any length of time re¬ tain merely a cold and common-place inti¬ macy ; her passions were naturally strong, and she felt too much gratified in the daily
proof of his attention and feeling towards her, not to be deeply impressed with its val ne. His constant command and flow of spirits elated and kept warm those of Rosalviva's—they charmed her to an ex- tacy in his presence, and the exercise of her remembrance of it in his absence. During circumstances like these, it may be expected that the heat of Rosalviva's affection towards Leontini was materially calmed. His appearance and his con¬ versation combined, placed in contrast with his friend, appeared heavy to her, tedious, and uninteresting. Paoli be¬ came too successful, and she lewarded his ardour with all the warmth and impulse of a soul susceptible of pure eiljoyment. ' It was at this period that she contemplated a visit to Messina, as narrated in a pridr chapter,—and it was at this period that
ROSALVIVA. the intercourse and principles of Paoli and the fover of Rosalviva became disunited. - A mission of. some importance from the Duke tJ of Palermo to the Port of Syracuse* demanded the service of Golfieri, who, taking a hasty farewell of Leontini, pro¬ ceeded on his departure. , The execution,of.Golfieri' s mission was· terminated. He had, previously to Rosal¬ viva's leaving Palermo, been made ac¬ quainted with her intentions and the length of time she, intended remaining at Messina. He,, feared her, former regard for Leon- tini« had. manifested itself before her de¬ parture; .anxious, therefore,, to ascertain the, fact of.his suppositions, he determined to. stay, some short, time at Messina, and there,, unknown to Rosalviva, Jie might have an opportunity of witnessing her ge¬ neral .conduct,—he communicated this to
leontini, .with all the seeming, assurance Of friendship, and further intimated that he should be attentive to the care and inte¬ rests of the.Comptessa, upon the score,of that .confidence which Leontini had ever reposed in him. It was upon the receipt of such an epistle, subsequent to that which was .forwarded by an anonymous hand, that he felt the more indebted and bound towards his friend, and.in the satisfaction and belief of the slander from his unknown corres¬ pondent, he was appeased and delighted that one like Paoli was willing to offer her liis protection. To Golfieri his several epistles were, forwarded,, who dictated that kind of.repLy which at .length brought Leontini to consider, that by some means he was no longer in possession of her'.affection,.; I . ,, ,The. entire termina tion of the, ¿corres-
pondence on thè part of Rosalviva; and 'the being totally discarded from her notice, created no small poignancy in the bosom ; of Leontini,' but he was ignorant and, un¬ willing'to believe, that to his'friend was he indebted for all his moments of anguish. Time at length revealed,, and pourtrayed in its genuine colour, the duplicity and in¬ gratitude of Golfieri. This, and the con¬ temptuous manner in which he had been treated by the Comptessa; (notwithstand¬ ing he had embraced eveiy means and every opportunity that offered for his amusement and gaiety,) was too forcibly imprinted on his''memory to be easily era- dicated;^-and 'though his miud appeared at intervals light and cheerful,' there was a gloomy and a throb at his heart, which was fast blighting his other more genial and'dependant virtues^Change of scene vol. i. h
was indispensable, and with the resolution to quit Palermo, he had endeavoured to prepare for its effect, when the incident which brought him to the assistance of Vivaldi defeated his projects, and brought him to the embrace of a parent. V/ith Vivaldi's power, and from the confessions of Di Borgi, he cherished sensations that till then had never found place in his bo¬ som ;—instead, therefore, of his spirits sink¬ ing into despondency, they were newly strung with a passion and an exultation that were rapturously enjoyed,—he felt himself in duty impelled to avenge his pa¬ rent's attack,— lus soul spurned at the idea of bringing the object of his resentment to an immediate or disgraceful death,—he knew that there were tortures far more afflicting than the sufferings and fate of the common horde,—his heart* beat high
with the satisfaction of his hopes, and" hé looked forward to a period'when Golfieri and the unfeeling Rosalviva should be degraded and humbled. In the meanwhile, we .momentarily re¬ turn to Golfieri. ¡> The utmost rage and mortification-fired the breast of Paoli, as the comrade of Di Borgi, in almost breathless detail on tho subsequent day, intimated the fatal con¬ sequences of the wounds wliich Piozzi had received« «'And thou, dastard," exclaimed the Conte, * * left him to perish« ' ' " My lord, dissolution immediately followed the thrust of the strangers poign¬ ard. I was not fool enough to hazard a similar condition, fearful, too, of the num¬ ber of my opponents* ï judged it nioro expedient to give the direct infbrrtiation ? 2
to your excellence, so that,if you are still disposed, no time' might be lost in giving me further aid; I then will pledge tlie worth of the Cassaro to a single Marvredi, if before morning the old Padre is not in other worlds." "Psha," bitterly implied Paoli, " 'tis too late, the Padre will not so readily leave the convent Here, be satisfied with this until my further summons, and expect my wishes realised on the night of to-morrow, —something shall surely be determined," and putting into the hand of the assassin a purse containing a few pistoles, he abrupt¬ ly Iefthim, .and hastened to the Palazzi of Rosalviva. "Tliink no more of it, Golfieri," inter¬ rupted the Cómptèssa, as Paoli, in a tone of vehemence reprobated the' fatality { of
the occurrence, " 'tis the business of a weak and common mind, to entertain re¬ gret at trivial disappointments; Vivaldi cannot dream of the person of' his anta¬ gonist, and doubtless will take the¡opportu- nity of an early visit to my Palazzi —what, if in your presence .1 demand- the au¬ thorities and documents of my inheritances his reply will instantly govern your fixed and decided resolution of acting ; and to Paoli Golfieri there is little need of further counsel on such an occasion, his own dic¬ tates are his surest guide// " They are, dearest Rosalviva, and ??> assured that I will not easily disregard then· tenor."

nary offences, that you will forgive them, and I will yet hope that you will be mine." "Never, never, harshly pronounced the Comptessa—" indulge not in a thought so futile, my heart is relentless, and were it even softened by your wish of atonement, its sentiments cannot be altered, since that it is eternally plighted to one who has de¬ served it." Leontini was silent, the impression of the scene had totally unmanned him ; stern and morose as had been his intentions on the engagement of this interview, they had separately weakened, and and in the in¬ voluntary sensation of grief and despair, all his purposes 'had vanished. "It is then your wish, Rosalviva, that we&hould never meet again?" interrogated Leontini,' his tone of voice, after a pause of some length, assuming a more »settled
calmness. " Nay—such a question sur^ prises me," answered the Comptessa, and her features were contorted into a deri¬ sive smile. ' ' You might have spared your¬ self the task of requiring its conclusion, and me the necessity of replying—that it was, and is my imperative determination, you might have gained the full reliance o£. had you but reflected upon the guide of my conduct, and to terminate a conference that cannot bein either way beneficial, I entreat you to retire ; t have but to add,. Sig¬ nor Leontini, that your presence in my Palazzi is extremely irksome, and as it is in ¡my power to remove any such unplea¬ santness, I must, in duty to myself, com¬ mand its instant obedience." "Yet, one moment, it is the last where¬ in we shall ever meet," .eagerly, cried, Leontini, and Jhe elapsed her hand, jvitliin
his, thereby detaining her, before she had availed herself of summoning any of the^ domestics; collecting his utmost compo¬ sure and effort of mind, he pronounced: " Rosalviva, could this meeting have ren¬ dered itself agreeable to a mutual concilia¬ tion, without wishing, or attempting the renewal of our correspondence, I could have parted with you in submission and. content, as it would bave been my hope 1 that the felicity you were wont to ex¬ change, would have been 'replete, and in the affection of another, that .yott should have forgotten me; but as you have inhumanly torn from me every tie that I had anticipated to render existence blissful—I will not shrink from the communication that otherwise should have fallen to oblivion. > ■ - "Ha! you tremble; but it is only
your future acts that can affiance yoib with guilt—its prevention is in your power, and beware, Rosalviva, if you value the ordainment of Heaven's most sacred decree, that you hazard not its worth." Leontini's dark and penetrating eye met those of Rosalviva—their brightness seemed fraught with an < unusual degree of expression, and an imvard pang of secret affliction fixed in the same moment-on her heart, but it was of too powerful a nature to be easily moved ; and in a voice of half frantic gesticulation, she uttered —" Speak fully, what these insinuations refer to, or I shail deem their apparently portentious remarks to be shaped merely for sinister motives, and in that assur¬ ance, will ■ treat them as. they deserve—
my vows are plighted, and no earthly power shall ever cause their dissolution." " And to whom?" enquired Leontini. "To one whom thyself can only be thanked for the introduction." "To whom," eagerly repeated Leon- tini, doubting whether from her own lips the name of her paramour would be dis¬ closed, "to whom T' " Paoli Golfieri," answered the Comp¬ tessa, with an undaunted air. ' ' Be not too sanguine in the credence of thy pledge, Rosalviva." " As the all-powerful God of Heaven is my Creator, so—" *' Hush, desist from thy oath, least apostacy should stamp the covenant—hear me, it is needless to withhold the intelli¬ gence by wliich you may profit. I came
to render you service, and notwithstand¬ ing the obduracy of your proud heart, my endeavours for your welfare shall not be passed in silence ; in one word, I affirm that with Golfieri you can never wed. This may be sonic alleviation to the many hours of bitterness and misery that I have endured for you, Rosalviva." " Insulting fool," replied the Comp* tessa, " can'st thy puny efforts forbid the decree, miserable and presumptious infa¬ tuation—never!" " Never—you deceive yourself, thanks to that righteous Providence, this confir¬ mation of iny hopes will be a recompence for me in the hour of solitude, and reflec¬ tion, to know that with such a traitor as Golfieri you can never be united ; and that there will arrive a time when conviction and punishment will repay his deserts
" These implications may sound 'im¬ portant ; but in the presence of the Conte I doubt their utterance," remarked the Comptessa with a tone of complacency and composuie, " Rosalviva, for your sake I dare do more îthan would almost be credible to human species—but if you , esteem the character of virtue, and the desirrê of happiness, you .will banish 'from ???* heart an attachment which can only end in your ruin." " This is language winch I will no longer be the auditor of; and that your boasted and incomprehensible designs may be put to the test, I shall summon the presence of the Conte Golfieri, he is now in my Palazzi —with him you can adjust' matteis as your inclination is most suit¬ able ;" and withdrawing to an* apartment
that opened to a further 4 suite of rooms, she left the astonished Leontini confound¬ ed, and for a time insensible of her absence. Many minutes had not elapsed "when the door of the apartment'wa^ 1 thrown open, and preceded by'an attendant with lights, the Conte Golfieri presented him¬ self. Surveying the figure of Leontidi - with an indignant menace, and with a kind of strangeness, he pronounced—"and isit by your request that I am directed hither —the Signor Leontini, if I mistake not4" " Yes r , callous and detestable miscreant, it is the deceived Leontini; arm'thyself, Vvillain, before my 'resentment charges me with thy murder—draw and defend'thy¬ self (and his'conduct became nearly fran¬ tic)', or this weapon willfind à sheaih only in thine heart." ' ^ i 3i ^ , * ' j ?© rushed upon the man who had been
instrumental to his, wretchedness, and but for the interference òf the attendant/ who liad loitered in the apartment, his thurst at Golfieri's bosom would have been fatal. . ·*,Hold,.

" Aye, and thank thy better fate for so easy an escape," added Golfieri, darting a fierce arid revengeful look at tirò Sup¬ pressed turbulence of his aggressor*—be¬ gone whilst thou hast the means, and in¬ cur not the serious chastisement of Paoli (Staffieri.": » ·.. ·. .-..'/ " The Comptessa has acknowledged' my protection,» and it shall not witham- punity be violated." -— ^?,^.-??)??. > . ^ Inhuman' betrayer; > can r oriiríe f and

" Peace, fool/ ho there, Gioeni Orino —bear hence thfe 1 maniac impostor 'from the Palazzi ; and should he ever resume these practices, know that there are dun¬ geons which can quiet them." Several within the command of Golfieri instantly entered the room, though nbt without considerable difficulty, were they enabled to subdue the opposition and de¬ fiance of Leontini. . Overpowered by superior strength, with which he was surrounded, and breathless with the maintenance of so unequal a con¬ flict, he sunk exhausted in the arms of the domestics. They hurried him from the Palazzi, and fainting nearly with tlie pain of a wound « t which he had received in the struggle,* he
,was conveyed almost senseless to an ob¬ scure part of an avenue ; where, overcome with fatigue, the menials of Golfieri left him to seek his own safety.

"If you decline, Signor," resumed the stranger, mindful of his silence and apathy, and perfectly sensible of its cause, " dan¬ ger threatens you. As a man of honour, İ i_ t / I pledge myself that the purport of my communication is to your advantage, nay, your safety^—dismiss these doubts, Sig- nor—a Sicilian shall never have the oppor¬ tunity of declaring that a Neapolitan once wronged him ; nor will Visconti Carraccio, hazard thy displeasure." "Senhor Carraccio'?" momentarily ex¬ claimed Leontini—" the kinsman of Gol¬ fieri!" t * I am so considered.

Leontini startléd— aii inexpressibleshudr
dering for the moment seemed to appai him. He almost doubted the honesty of Carraccio, and trembled to tliink whether he had not been ensnared into the complete power of Golfieri by the specious and well paid deception of his agent. His suspicions were almost verified—when the voice of Visconti hushed him, who in.an enuncia*- tion of the most ^exulting land, cried, '«But no, his'hopes are defeated!"—The announcement of some of Carraccio's friends silenced the conversation; and to the several visitors Leontini was respectfiilly introduced. Every possible luxury adorned the table of Carraccio, and the* conviviality of the guests was supported with unabated ardour. . . - 1 1 ,' K >! Leontini was buried ,in conjectureras to what manner the scene would < terminate. Several hours had elapsed in the celebration
of 'their 'riotous mirth—every succeeding moment he anticipated the fetimmons of Golfieri ; and at every opening of theisa-* loon entrance he looked for his appearance!' ^-The friends' of Carraccio were v severally departing.' ' ì ' ' fii ' "'p' 1 '- ; ' Leontini motioned to retire,' but* a pro¬ hibition whispered to him by Visconti/ urged him to remain; and as' thé Neapoli¬ tan closed an outer portai, 1 he found they were the only occupants of the aparments. Time had scarcely been given 'for ob¬ servation* 'on* either 'side, when a. · low knock at a'small arched door, at the oppo* site end of the salo0n,'called the attention of Vièconti, who'pronouncing the leave of admittance—a countenance apparently su* perhuman thurst -itself * forward ? on \ the partial·' opening of the -door, and s looking around in mysterious'silences he > entered;
closed the porch, and deliberately ap¬ proaching Carraccio, stood in a lofty atti¬ tude, nand 'inquisitively surveying' the Signor Leontini, which, when concluded* hei presented Visconti with a billet, ' and awaited lis answer. ' ' ' r 'The Conte may expect my prompt obedience, ' ' i pronounced - his confident. - ' u The messenger rudely bowed and'with- drew« 1 r . * i.i » " ' v i l.Visconti handed the written communi¬ cation to Leontini, adding, "here, Signor, you may perceive'the intentions of Gol-' fieri." He glanced on the paper, where was legibly traced by'the' r pën 'of the Conte Paoli, ?" If-the Signor Leontini' ?? in-¿he immediate power of Carraccio, let him 'be conveyed to 'the grating > whicli terminates tlie lower court of the palace.' Golfieri and his confederate, alike dis-
guised, will be in readiness to receive him, once within the dungeon walls of the 'Pa¬ lazzi, he rests secure, nor ever again have the light of Heaven to gaze upon.]' ι irti " . An almost total annihilation of-faculty succeeded the perusal of Paoli Vorder —he was about to comment upon the horrible machination of the Conte, when the> Nea¬ politan, in a tone of commanding confi¬ dence, cried,—" utter no fears, Signor, the pledge of Visconti is at stake and shall not be broken—obey with strictness my dictates, and be certain of their profit." " But the dungeon where this atrocious and treacherous Paoli, would have his victim¡ consigned," insinuated Leontini/ almost bewildered m a train of doubts and apprehensions.—" How could Signor Car- 1 raccio effect release,, if once * withinn its powpr/?" i ,' · · a * a " alW
ν "It shall· be effected," imperatively re¬ plied Visconti, and looking 'sternly upon the countenance of Leontini^ which r \vas pallid, nearly by the oppression of ? mind worked 1 up with suspicion, arid an ap¬ palling sense' of his situation.-^-" It shall be ¡effected, 1 ■ was again repeated by the confidante of -Golfien. ; ■ ^' But on'· conditions," "interrupted Leontini, "which may be equally fatal.'" ' ' No Signor j ; this moment can mark thy friëndsliipj and whenever the ëervicës ¡ of Leontini can promote· thie views of "Car¬ raccio, can they be securedi?" ; ' >-^ · ■i; :»' My desire is to ieavethe Palazzi, 5 nor hazard any plan ! formed »by ^ Golfierfeif thèn^ my rank and services are respected; yòu-willofFer,^ Signor,·' no òppositioniitò nij^ departure ; it was only on thè score of cønfidénce, and ; my belief ofyOurhònoùri'
that I acceded to the association already knowiii beyond that I know not-r-nor will I conform to." 44 Signor Leontini, you touch upon »the feelings of a man of „honour,, when you frame resolutions, at present insinuated, had the purposes to which I wereiSolicited by the Conte been put in practice, where would be the necessity of apprising you of their purport. Tf at your immolation 1 had aimed, there ^were^ other methods of effecting it, without offering,a confidence which is founded, on tlie, most honourable motives ; in giving you, Signor, the in¬ tentions of' the Conte, and Jiis determina¬ tion ¡tOitassassmatc/I conceived that I,had served ¡you .so much, that not a, trifling debt of gratitude would have,been due tp me,,jf.I needed but its, acknowledgment, and ,which ¡woulddiave been exemplified in
the. obedience and attention of those di¬ rections it was now my business to ex¬ pedite." t ".You can give no better proof, Signor Carraccio, of the value of your good will and friendship towards me, than by an acquiescence to my request—that you were willing to befriend me is fully pour¬ trayed in the disclosure of Paoli's diabo¬ lical arrangement, and .which ! shall never cease to remember. Profiting by it, is in having the opportunity of escaping from the ruin which is attendant." Signor Leontini, I cannot but admit the correctness of your observations—that the matter may retain its intended shape, will the service I have rendered you be worth a similar instance in return 1 ?" "Unquestionably," answered Leontini, without the coldness of hesitation.
? f * It is now required, then, Signor— in conducting you to the public street from hence, and there with sufficient protection you reach your abode, my act of friendship is replete—to repay it; is to follow impli¬ citly the actions of Visconti, and fearlessly meet the designs of the Conte Golfìeri-4)n such conditions you can' serve me, and the obligation is mutual/' ,' < " I accept of the terms," confidently rejoined LeonthnVafter a momentary pause —" you undertake that in so' doing 1 hazard not the commitment'of erinle, but assist· the designs of Carraccio. ' ' * ^ido." --r · · ? - • '** You equally pledge ýóurs'elf that my liberation from such sanguinary horrors, is in your hands, and it shall be instantly efFected.'\ vol. ι. ?
' * I do," repeated the Neapolitan, ' *'and but few hours shall number your confine¬ ment." The discourse was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Paoli's uncouth and scowling messenger, who, in an enuncia¬ tion of savage expression, enquired the reason of Visconti 's delay—" the Signor Conte," added he, " has awaited your appointment during the last half hour— how much more time will your excellenza be pleased to—" " Silence, fool," roared the stern voice of Carraccio—and lowering its tone to that of a whisper, cried—" inform the Conte he has need of but few moments to com¬ plete his purposes," and instantly tlie ruffian again retired. Carraccio intimated to Leontini that they must attend the summons.
j " Stay, Signor, a bumper of Lachryma to our unity.". ; , ' The pledge was mutual, and the Neapo¬ litan furnishing Leontini with a large cloak, similar to one he himself was wrapped in, they quitted the saloon through the small porch by which'the ruffian had gained ad¬ mittance. Closing the door, and preceding Leon¬ tini, the tall figure of Carraccio (bearing a lamp), they issued along the narrow avenue that branched from the apartment. Proceeding some distance, they came to an aperture, where, with some difficulty they passed, and entered a wide and capa¬ cious apartment, leading to a spiral stair¬ case, wbich was terminated by a pair of folding gates, but from their dismantled and delapidated appearance, some years ? 2
hadeläpsed- since any use or defence had been made of their pliability. .-..:, • Not one : word hâd^escaped thé lips of .the Neapolitan during thè descent. .. . - , : The. obscurity of the abyss that was be¬ fore them, and the : immense depth* it ap¬ peared from any inhabitable part of the building, created a cold and agitated sen¬ sation on the heart of Leontini, and he al¬ most reproached his credulity for being conveyed to the dreadful, and sepulchral void that seemed to enclose hiim \ ι A swift current of ^ir dimmed the light carried by- Visconti—the gloom of the ap« parently immeasurable recess in which they halted, and the strange, silence,of Carraccio,, hung with' appalling sense on the mind. The deathly, solitude, and vast^ obscurity of the expanse, increased
which' the flame ;he hesitatedto'break the silence, lest ihe í tone ' of voice'should ibetray. 7 his terror, and assuinmg.the^possîbility, of con¬ fidence and caution, hè obeyed the motion of ????????? arm, í which ushered" him'on¬ wards ; andin an accent' that scarcely rose beyond'a whispers but which vibrated with dismal· f 6ound throughout the vaults he pronounced, "our progress will speedily terminate — follow, < Signor, but· speak nought." t v " ·. . ff They emerged further' into 'tlie void of darkness,' - passing .through an * Unroofed piazza, or kind of broken archway, closed hy an iron grating, which Visconti un¬ fastened, and opened into an opposite avenue of some length, which the-gleam of a torch-light in the distance sufficiently ? 3
pointed but, and served to trace its black and unfrequented compartments. ' Visconti re-applied his key to the grat- ing/and[ with slight assistance it returned to its threshold'; their light, ihough not extinguished, afforded but a feeble ray, 'and in order'to ascertain the approach of the figure that the flare of the torch faintly 'discovered, Carraccio shaded the lamp. In anxious suspence the heart of Leon¬ tini beat with heavy pulsation at the inflic¬ tion he might be doomed to. "Breathe not, Signor," intimated Car¬ raccio, " the Conte Golfieri and his at¬ tendant is near." Leontini was silent, but in ?? imagina¬ tion a series of singular constructions were in formation, as to the conduct and seem¬ ing mystery of Visconti.
: The motion^ of the two figures habited in sable cloaks and partly masked, rivetted him to : the solemnity of the spot, and in quick and distrustful tones, the Conte ex- claimed to his companion,-^*'Carraccio might have been less ceremonious-—in the name of St. Athanasius, what had he to i^xV" :■ ^.^-¿V^-'V ■■''' 4 ' I think, my lord, that the Signor was not so- easily deluded, as was expected; for their conversation seemed loud and debating. On my entrance, the, Signor was pressing to withdraw tohis Palazzi. Words ran lùgli ; besides, in the state of the Signor's reason, it was. not probable that he: would tamely submit to be;borne to these regions." , t ' The drug that I remitted to Visconti, ' ' ; remarked Paoli, "could not have been ád-
ciimistéreíl —its suporific and invincibléjm- flúènce is certain.'' ?.. ?·: ; ? The feelings of Leontini, who had dis r tinctly heard thase several ejaculations, may be more'readily conceived than expressed; still the expression ? of tlie last speaker somewhat animated, him, aware that Vis¬ conti had not applied the baneful drug; and the hope that he. was still secure-in his confidence, was not wholly banished. Such a failure in' the obedience to Golfieri's design, augeredthe privateand peculiar resentment he questioned not, but Carraccio mustj re¬ tain against the Cónte, ! his exigencies was therefore somewhat alleviated. - ■' 4 ... Theref was little moment fòri diversity o«,, opinion, as the voice of Golfieri'directed his4x)mipániori, in order to prevent further impediments to throw openf the grating of an innei\dungeon.
They both proceeded to the extent of the vaulted area, and forsorne few minutes.the ( entire space where Leontini and tlie Nea¬ politan had remained, was immersedjn ut¬ ter darkness. . » ,♦'»,*' "Now, Signor Leontini, further ¡timé need not be lost," replied -Carraccio,* and taking his hand, he retained it with muscular , pressure.

Nay, do. - not tremble thus—-it ill becomes a man of your worth! to fear, Remémbei*. the pledge exr isting between^us. Seem resigned to ???? fate without a struggle.

grating, and perceiving his approach, in a tone of authority, reiterated—" Ho, there, Bertroni—Bertroni.'V , t t They are here, ? ' in a low but reverbe- rating* tone, cried Golfieri, and desiring the assistant to answer tlie call of Visconti, the ruffian, whose name had been made to resound throughout the vault, in equal vi¬ bration, replied, "Here, Signor, here." The hasty step of Bertroni immediately brought lus masculine form to the spot where Carraccio and the Signor had rested ; and throwing the reflection of the. light full upon the sullen feature of Leontini, cried, "Come, Signor, there is no ceremony requisite for the introduction to this new abode^—see, my comrade there has perfectly and carefully prepared it for -yourexcellenza." A rude and splenetic burst of laughter
ibllowed the expression, and looking with a scornful smile upon Carraccio, bellowed out—"Your lordship knows that we are pretty attentive in these matters." í ' r ■ r • The ruffian grasped the hand of Leontini, and snatching him' with the utmost ease tò lus arms—he hurried *into the inner'dun¬ geon. ... n' · ,' r The large dark eye of Golfieri flashed with an exultation—his victim was borne in the herculean grasp of Bertroni, and taking the hand of Carraccio, who had fol¬ lowed, exclaimed, " My rival is at length secure;" muffling the tone of his voice, he added,«" now Bertroni^ to the com¬ pletion of thy errand—aye, and with this," producing a dagger—" he sleeps for ever." 1 "Ruffian," replied Leontini,"and at the same time drawing his sword-^-* * dare to

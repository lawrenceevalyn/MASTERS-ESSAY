Then, per¬ baps in following our hero througbtthe chequered pages of his narrative, sliould we find tbe indignation of his soul burst¬ ing from the oppressive trammels, m ri¬ gidly imposed on the unfortunate by røø- nastic superstition, euren though that in¬ dignation border not on correct morality* we ??] ,be ted to deplore, rather than disdain, to.pitjb rather than condemn, Though at first the ??????^?? »light seem truly blessed in ihe society of religious men, because the apparent goodness and motive o£ their actions, to a heart naturally pious, led ??, tot foot towards them with reverential ?? tMfc- pripntattvesof the Divinity, and beings in themselves of, hol^a||ieritb«ii human mfàp · $ ei *rf# t ?? % ? ofvH^. 1??1|? ? ???^^ jindv^i^ll J^B «tinnd for

for reflection, then fell the iron ìmnà of oppression heaw.and more heavily upon hhn,bv becoming perceptible to his heart and increasing with his understanding, till the society which had before charm¬ ed him, became irksome to bis mind, and the hallowed walis of bis cloister were converted to a prison. The father of Ulric, as though in the same hour hehad banished him both from his heart and his home, rarely ap¬ proached the £rute of St. Gabriel, to bless or applaud the pious zeal of his son; at first this neglect fell deeply on the lacerated feelings ofthe youth j still, mingled with bitter tears of regret, daily did he offer up prayers for the peace ?? happiness of berøgs that to him had provedmerciless: but by de- grtes, the genial and heartfelt offerings of Mi breast became less subservient to filiti tad brotherly affection, till at last merely,
C w]
merely breathed from un internal sense of duty, they totally ceased to exist r for at that age, when the mind like a drooping tendril, requires the aid df some friendly hand to upraise and direct its wanderings, Ulric, accustomed to solitude, and too familiar with religion to feel her genuine influence, formed within the limits of his own mind, a thou¬ sand bold and extravagant ideas, to era¬ dicate which, efforts were required of a nature more tender than those ofthe sullen and coldhearted companions of bis cloister. Thus, led on by vain and false rea¬ soning, without the power of discri¬ minating virtue from the more ghiring colourings of evil, that natural want of stability which Ulric possessed, became m it were fixed in his disposition, and frequently induced him, at one time to coincide ^rith^wh, ittesø ,?? opinions, which
? 15 J
which at another, hfe heart bad dis¬ dained to approve or avow. While hislifelvas spent in penitence, prayer, land abstinence, how different¬ ly passed that of his brother Reginald ; surrounded by thètninions of greatness, and nursed in the lap of ease, little thought he on the solitary mourner in St. Gabriel's turrets, but wrapt in the profuse enjoyment of pleasure, the throb of companion was aft alien to his breast, théBëttse ofaffecthftt à stranger therein : while his slothful limbs courted repose on a couch of silk and down, those of the ht»èrabie fiovice, were bent before some sacred image on tbe cold and un- cóìtth pavement of his cell ; to that cell would he frequently retire, not so much fo ruminate on the divine promises, of hbly writ, or to fdrtify by Apostolic ex¬ ample, hb aching heart with firmness, as to meditale ?? reciñe dyer the injus¬ tice of his own rnhappy fate. "Alasi"

^Aleat" would he ment»*' v exclaim, <% ' what had 1 dope, at thsi u^4*specting age, ere reason rendered me capable of deciding properly upon mine own ??? tions, <>! reflecting on the barbarov« wishes of others, to be dfawn,intoa life of sechision? why am I consigned toa living tomb, while the unfeeling Regi¬ nald revels in the sunshine of joy, prosperity, and ease* regardless of wots that wring the bosom of an unfortu¬ nate wretch, which bis proud heart dis¬ dains to acknowledge by the endearing epithet of brother.** Thus would he sadly ruminate, till the long-toned mid¬ night bell, sounding its melancholy mar- iiiurs from the northern tower of the Monastery, disturbed his gloomy reve- rieft, when dashing from his çheefc the tear qf bitter anguish, he reluctantly repaired to the chupei. Those aaççii- jfted objects which had once captivated his sotil, no longes e^çite^the smallest admiration

admiration within him ; his duty, from eonstant observance became a mere tàslt, áHdf he frequently affected to ob- serve U, viften ? heart and mind were totally áb&rkctéd^ therefrom. The world to which he was an entire stran¬ ger, seemed to liis futile imagination as some free and celestial paradise, wherein the wanderer's path is strewn with flov. - ¿Vs and his hour of existence crown ?? with joy. The death of his father which oectlr« red before Ulric bad attained his twenty third year, turned all these upbraidings into a deadly hatred for Reginald. That which paternal respect had stifled, now burst forth with tenfold ardour, and when his brother condescended to vilit him at the convent, in order to im¬ part the tidings of St. Julien's death, and l«tst wishes for his future conduct and welfare, scarcely 1 could he restrain the warmth
[18]
warmth of his indignation at what he considered insulting mockery. Äegí- nald, who from habit was totally insen- sibie to the advantages he enjoyed, entertained no idea of his brother's wretchedness, but conceived at first that his chilling manner proceeded from grief at the loss of a parent, or was the result of a life devoted to religion and retirement ; yet at parting, so pointed was the contempt or Ulric, that it could not fail to convict him, and quitting the cloister with the spirit of anger in his breast, he determined if possible, to fer¬ get the ties existing between them. Truly opposite wfcre the dispositions of ?? two brothers ; Reginald ???- áeilèdi-nothing <tf so much importunée aa his own hearts gratification, md buried in the enjoyment thereof it never once occurred:to his mind that the ldtrty èf ihose in affluence is to seek

[*] Julia was devoted to St Gabriel, and doomed never, under dread of per¬ dition, to hearken to the vows of love : Ulric too was a priest of the most rigid order; yet a fatal something whispered to hit heart, that though access to eter¬ nal happiness depended on forgetting her, stili» etui must he remember and be wretched r—thoUo h love tvere ati ob¬ stacle that barred his way to life, yet must he woo tbe delusion and expire. Anew world, a new train of ideai rushed in upon Ulric; the convent had lost its gloom, it was become the casket which enshrined his most inestimable treasure—the citadel that contained ?? dearest object » ? Day succeeded day, and his emotions hourly increased ; tfie hardships ofthe cloister, his past wrongs, Reginald-too wast forgotten ; nothing but the conflict of
[ «3
of love anddespâatr agitated his breast : no companions save the sighs of hope- í cisnes* «nd the tears dt regret, ware cherished encroachers on his s^ditude; letmrtored a secret ?? consenting sorrow at his heart, whieh had fallen into tenderness, and he coveted retirement, wherein, unnoticed and unrebuked, he nnght indulge the delicious contagion, Wm hours together would he hang over the name of Julia, which he had unconsciously sketched in hk breviary, or lost in elysiàn dreams, form pictures of rapturous bliss, in whieh she and himself, were ever most prominent objects : no longer repining atthe stern fate which doomed him to conventual se* elusion, he almost blessed» and held the hand lenient that had placed him in it.

disapointment j since all sublunary en* joytnent is but as fhe âhadow, which comes bafore us and disappears for ever. Since the chapel was become as it were his earthly paradise, Ulrica fea¬ tures no longer assumed the sadness of gloomy regret, but beam ed with their wonted mildness and afiability : so re¬ formed too appeared his actions, that the earliest streak of dawn beamed ever on his public devotions. Such unusual zeal çotdd not long escape observation from the most aged fathers, who warmly ap¬ plauded his piety ; and Ulric, the late repining Ulric, waa now disthiitítt- guished as an example and pattern of youthful sanctity. Eut although the daily eight of his adored Julia, might be a source ot inexpressible eatìsfaetiòu to his heart, yet wis he anxious to ap* proach, and in secret converse #Wh her; ?1 it seemed utterly impossi¬ ble
C «l 1

With no other prospect than that which eventually led to despair, Ulric racked his imagination to devise some stratagem by which he might effect the purpose nearest his heart. In addition to the delight the outward form of Migion afforded him, { however painful the deception misrht be to his honourable feelmgs) by enabling htm more frequently to gaze on Julia's form, partially seen through the dark foldings of the veil, and the strong heavy «tratmsrs which concealed her, it obtained him the approbation and con¬ fidence of the aged Frisurs, from whose D 2 good
[52] opinions his anxious mind looked for¬ ward to something like alleviation from his present suffering—and at an hoar, when his heart should be crowned with love and rapture ; such ideas alone led htm to continue a deception, which in the pursuit of any other object, his soul would have revoltedat.

did the figure of the young mor ? appear before her, and extending its hand, invite her to accompany it to scenes of peace and jo\/remote^ fife'remote from, the seclusion of cloisters and the cheer¬ less society of their melancholy tenant*. At other times a solitary cabin, hanging on the mossy margin of a translucent lake, presented itself to her feverish imagmation, wherem she seemed to share the pure and exquisite enjoyments of genuine affection in tbe society of Ulric; and as he tenderly imprinted the soft kiss of love upon her tremblfng hand, a thrill of rapture rushing vio¬ lently to her agitated bosom, woidd awaken her from the dream of bliss—to to a bitter sense of her forlorn and de¬ plorable situation. The grate alone, through which she might gafce unsuspected, on the youth¬ ful form of Uiric as he assisted at the ceremonicb
[ 55 ] ceremonies of the alter, wa* tjbe only resort in which her soul seemed to find consolation Her religious companions witnessed with considerable surprise the sudden alteration which bad taken place in her manner and countenance ; but as Julia had not been obi ged to accept the rigid vows of St. Gabriel, any otherwise than as the intreaties of her relation the Abbot, (who professed himself the friend of her father, and the guardian protector ofher orphan state,) might be supposed to prevail over her inclinations, they attributed the pal¬ lid hue of her cheek to unusual con¬ finement, and the sadness of her spirits to the remembrance of absent friend«. Yet, there was one,, of a gentle, and kind nature, who conceived the cause to originate from a totally differ¬ ent source. Agnes Bertrand, ρ ssessing a feeling heart, and superior under- Π 4 stunding
? 56]
standing had been necessitated to accept the veil, and devote her life to religion, under circumstances similar to those which consigned Ulric to a Monasteiy, in order to preserve the dignity and fortune of an elder brother. Agnes, from the best, the most bene¬ volent motives, had more narrowly at¬ tended to the change in Julia ; she had been an unhappy witness to the repen¬ tance of many, who like her, led away by superstition, or unfortunate circum¬ stances, had consigned themselves to a living tomb, or rather plunged their ex¬ istence into misery, rendering life burthensome, and death enviable,— not from the trammels of mortality which the latter shook off, but, because it removed them from a state of incura¬ ble regret. Hearts congenial, seldom are long in becoming attached to each other, and, from the excellence of her disposition,
[57]
disposition, united to the tenderness of her nature, Julia was soon led to select Agnes from the rest of the sisters, both as her companion and friend. "Why weep'st thou my poor child?" inquired Agnes tenderly, one evening as she sat near Julia in her cell. "Alas ! sister," replied the feir mourner, "I may not—dare not say.** "I have a heart," continued Ag¬ nes, gently taking her hand/* deserv¬ ing 1 trust, not only your esteem, but your confidence ; the gloomy dejection to which you seem a martyr, can but ex* cite my interest,—fain would I learn, and share those misfortunes, which so evidently overwhelm you ; my Julia can^ not weep at the painful recollection of a single voluntary offence; is it then from any secret wrong she endures, or *He loss of liberty that I behold her thus/ D 5 "? neither 1

"Julia, you mistake, you know not tlie concern, which impels me, thus un- welcomely perhaps, to intrude upon your griefs : believe me 5 no inquisitive curiosa ν urges my enquiry, but ge¬ nuine and I eartfelt esteem ; fein would I learn your secret, not to aggravate the sensitive feelings which are so for¬ cibly wounded already, but rather by endea ingsympathy to re eve and com¬ fort them " Sobbing, Julia concealed her fece upon the bosom ofher friends while un- numbered

numbered conflicting emotions daeply rent her own. She remembered with horror, that her whole exists nee was devoted to St. Gabriel, and that any thing like hope of emancipation (Vom her anguish, was never, never to be expec¬ ted. All before her seemed as one de¬ solate and pierceless gloom; it was in vain she endeavoured to impress upon her own recollection, the nature and so¬ lemnity of vows under ivhich she was bound ; virtuous reason refused to coun¬ teract the violence of her love, and sighing, she exclaimed* "Ah ! that I had beheld him one day sooner, or had never entered this fetal Monastery/* Almost thunderstruck at the dreadful¬ ly unexpected conviction of the word Mmi aîtues, crossing herself in terror« faultered "what meanest thou Julia?" * r I know not* she answered con ulsively, ,f why I am thus afflicted, joy hp fted D6 tilis

"In purple and silver/' **Dost thou mean Ulric?—** "I know not, but if Ulric be his name, J twere better Juïia had never seen him ; was there a wizard influence in his eye, to dart this parching fever through my blood, and rob roy bursting heart of ?1? ifs peace, yes Agner, yes, his image haunts me ever; sleeping or waking it stands before me,—in vain I fly from it, or from myself. A consuming pas¬ sion triumphs over my happiness, from which alas! I perceive no prospect of escape but such as death alone can offer. "Lost and unfortunate Girl !" sighed Agnes
[61]
Agues, "summon up your fortitude, sur¬ er not this weakness to overcome you, remember, your vows are plighted to a most High Being, whose awfui frown might plunge you into eternal perdition ; how small an effort, aided by reflection, may relieve you from the weight of your present anguish : but what, Julia, whr.t atonement can save your immortal soul^ from the dreadful punishment which awaits on perjured sinners." with such arguments as these r did the virtuous Nun endeavour to assuage the stor¬ my feuds of love and despair, raging in the breast of that hapless victim, whose reply was only in her tears. Meanwhile, Ulric totally unadvised, was not to be overcome by any reflec¬ tion, however formidable it might seem in opposition to his love. His passion still burnt with increasing vigour
[62]
vigour, while the outward appearance ofhis piety, had so far succeeded to assist the visionary hopes which he en¬ tertained, as to procure him not only the notice of the Abbot, but also the privilege of occasionally passing the walls of his Convent, in order to at¬ tend on the sick peasant- who were in' tb% habit of daily sending to St. Ga¬ briel's, both for advice and assistance. No longer a captive, the turrets of bis Monastery were become far from hateful, and frequently in his lone ram¬ bles, would he climb some lofty emi¬ nence, from which to contemplate the luxuriant sublimity ot nature f while love, and liberty beaming upon his soul, taught it to expand towards the Supreme Deity, with enlotions of grati¬ tude and joy. In one of these excursions, coming to v
[«??
to the cottage of a lone matron, he pro¬ cured the necessarv apparel for disguis¬ ing himvelf as a poor village gtrl ; when retreating to a solitary part ofthe forest adjoining the Monastery, he assumed the dress, and, after concealing his Monk's habit under the hollow ofa fall¬ en oak» repaired with a basket of wild flowers on his arm, to the Convent grate, Vvhere he anxiously enquired for Julia asa messenger from her mother; decei¬ ved bv such a plausible artifice, the su¬ perior permitted her to attend, in the presence of Agnes and a lay sister. His features being enveloped in a thiclc coarse veil, UMe, so disguised, was fer from exciting any suspicion. tf Madam,** said he, addressing himself to Julia, "havinuc occasion to journey this way to the shrine of our Blessed Virgin, for the benefit of absolution, I ventured to the castle of your nAle Mother

Af other with a tender of my humble ser¬ vices, requesting to bear any commu¬ nication to yourself respecting the wel¬ fare of the family; Lady de Courci, pre¬ senting me with a liberal donation for my father, a poor but honest woodcut¬ ter, on the estate, desired me not only to see you in her name, but on my return to bear a faithful statement both of your health and happiness." The seeming artlessness of this ad¬ dress, won so readily upon the tender feelings of Julia, that had it been possi¬ ble she would have thrown herselÇinto thesupposed Cottager's arms, atthe idea of a messenger from her Mother»— in whose loved society she had tasted nothing but joy ;—the fatal contrast of her monastic solitude^ flashed keenly upon her, mind, and her trembling limhs almost refused their wonted suppqrt, as, sinking on the arm of the faithful Agnes,
[65 J
Agnes, she incoherently poured forth her thanks.
"Tell my mother," faultered slie, " that I am well—am happy-*-" št Very happy f * enquired Ulric with a voice of tenderness. Too much agitated to form a reply. Julia, almost fainting, hastily drew tlie veil in deep folds across her features, in order to conceal tears which involun¬ tarily gushed to her eyes. Agnes obser¬ ving her distress, and /doue conscious ofthe source from which if, flowed, as- sured Ulric that it proceeded from the welcome intelligence of her family, which was the first Julia had received ^ehereecluWon.AtthisNtantthe Convent bell proclaiming the hour of JIass, they prepared to withdraw, when the young Monk presenting his little basket to Julia, requested her to accept its contents, whicli were plucked from her

Ulric scarcely able to contain the rap¬ turous tumult of his joy, hurried back tp the spot whereon he had disguised himself and hastily resuming his re¬ ligious garb proceeded with alacrity to his devotional duties.

Vildersd fancy, and hastily snatching them to her lips, she imprinted innumer¬ able kisses on their tender leaves ; Ulric had held them in his hand, and Ulric per¬ haps had plucked them from their vital stems : charmed with these ideas Julia carefully arranged their half withered blossoms in water, and as their open¬ ing tints slowly revived, bedewed them with her tears : her first tbought on awa¬ king from repose, or returning from mass, was to pick oiFthe fading leaves, and sigh over the languid buds as they declined. "So" would she internally exclaim, ' t shall I also sink ere long; to rise no more, and that unlucky beau¬ ty which captivated Ulric'« beart, will fade like thine." A melancholy prevailed over lie* ivhole frame, and unable from excessive, weakness to attend the church as usual, her beart became agonized wjth the thought
C W3
thought of Ulric's pangs in her absence! Agnes beheklthe dreadful change with sensations of secret terror—as the Abbess frequently visited the religious cells, she feared least the unhappy girl, in an unguarded moment, should men¬ tion Ulric's name. About this period the widowed parent of Julia expired, and, as the holy mother imparted to her the heartrending intelligence, she uttered a shriek of woe and sank sense¬ less on the earth. The Abbess,like too many who with¬ out feeling, can offer consolation, while Agnes tenderly raised the luckless Julia, and hailed with gentle accents the reviving reason, reproachfully and in anger, held up to her desolate view the frailty of sublunary objects, and the weakness of their perishable charms ; from tbe delineation of which she pro* ceeded to the strength of holiness that tob. ι. E enables

enables us to support with fortitude the trials of this world, and, prepares ui for a better. Julia bowed with reverence as the Abbess concluded, yet something like disdain glowed at her bosom; was it thevoiceof humanity or feeling she thus exerted to alleviate her sorrows? Ah no ! shall the tongue ofthe Christian condemn the tears of filial affection ? or that blessed Beisg who became a voluntary instrument to save, lookstern- ly on the cause which impels them ?— Though the Abbess of St Gabriel, ga¬ zed proudly down from her tower of monastic zeal, to the humble offices of her handmaid Agnes, yet the Great Master whom she outwardly professed to serve, delighted not less in the art¬ less compassion of the unpresuming Nun, than tbe lofty ostentation of his more rigid votary: pause awhile ye ironhearted

A sigh of anguish which escaped Julia, as the Abbess withdrew, spoke more than language could express to tbe compassionate sister, and clasping the afflicted mourner to her bosom she offered her the tenderest consolation— « f alas! * f articulated Julia, almost mco- ?2 herently

As Julia*s cheek still lay on the bo¬ som of her benevolent friend, the letter of Uiric excited her attention, and in spite of the stormy pangs that tortur¬ ed her breast, a deep blush of shame overspread her pallid features, which could not escape the attentive observa¬ tion of Agnes, who taking up the wri¬ ting, immediately presented it to her, E 3 Confounded

On arising from the attitude of devo¬ tion, " I will remove these remembran¬ ces of Ulric's love;"said Julia, " and yet, shall I act ungratefully ? indeed 1 cannot—good sister, bear them hence." " O Julia !" said Agnes with tender resentment, "is this the firmness you boasted Ψ' Julia instantly took down the flowers which she had twined into a wreath, and deposited them in her cabinet.

"Yes/* she exclaimed, I solemnly promise.'* " Bless thee !" said Julia, assuming an appearance almost celestial, as put¬ ting forth hei hand, she placed both the wreath and letter of Ulric, in the bosom of her friend. But alas! each succeeding day was iar from bringing health to her (acted cheek« true the rose's ? 5 glow
C«l
^low beamed brightly there, but it was only the hectic colouring of consumpti¬ on, since her hopeless love for Ulric, and regret at the death of her once indulgent Mother, preyed too deeply on on Julia's sensitive mind, to admit the alleviations of hope.—Frequently would she sit buried in deep tbought, unheed¬ ing even the tender enquiries of Agues, which were not only become unwelcome to her ear, but were too often disregard¬ ed.—Heavy sighs stole frequently from Ber bosom, yet the murmur of complain t was still—those eyes of azure of bright¬ ness which in health and peace, were seen swimming in delight, no longer re¬ tained their lustre, and Julia, the late sylph-like Julia, remained but a woe- worn semblance of her former self. With heart-rending emotions of sorrow Agnes beheld the rapid decline of her friend, she saw her daily sinking in the ?ery
[S3] very blossom of existence to an untime¬ ly grave, from which no apparent means of preservation presented themselves; since alas ! the root of her disorder was deeply planted in the mind. Agnes ar¬ dently loved Julia, and felt anxious by some effort, however dreadful in effect, to snatch her from the deathlike lethar¬ gy which enveloped her;—she was Porteress to a small iron door at the ex¬ tremity ofthe Nun's cloister^ leading to the centre aisle ofthe church, near the end of which, she was aware from ob¬ servations, made through the gratings ofthe chapel, lay the cell of Ulric— to his retirement, Agnes inwardly resolved to repair at the silent hour of midnigbt; when no eye save her own, and Ais, who well knew the purity of her inten¬ tion, should witness the transaction ; it occurred to her mind, that by conduct¬ ing the young monk into Julia's pre¬ sence, she should be enabled to restore E 6 the
[8*3
the benumbed faculties of her soul to their wanted elasticity, by proving that nothing exceeds hope which is not ut* terly impossible—Julia, perhaps, ani* mated by the pious example of him she loved, might be content to exist on the sublime expectation of a celestial and immortal union in that world of lights where no cloud of anguish dims the sky of rapture—no storm of discord blasts the bud of peace. Consigned from her infancy to Con¬ ventual gloom, Agnes was totally ignor¬ ant of the danger likely to ensue from the perilous enterprise she was about to undertake ; perfectly ignorant of men and manners, she was perhaps less ca¬ pable of acting with discretion in the present instance, than even Julia her¬ eelf : she imagined from reports which prevailed of Ulric's piety, that he was too holy to trespass on the limits öf her virtuous
[85] rirtuous intention, which proceeded no further, than the fond and anxious wish of restoring her friend to the blessings of life, bad carried it; the crime, which appeared most prédominent to her mind, was that of breaking through the sacred regulations of her convent ; but this also deserted her recollection, while she gazed upon the pallid and altered features of Julia, although the violation of those holy decrees, Agnes knew, was alwayt punished with rigour, and not unfrequently with death : Yet as her mind averted to the prophetic language of her visibly dying compan¬ ion, at the moment of her melancholy request respecting tbe flowers of Ulric, and under the internal conviction, that Julia was the only earthly being for whom she had ever felt such disinteres¬ ted esteem, or from whom she had ever experienced such professions of friend¬ ship, she determined to preserve her existence
[86 1
existence, were it possible, even at the hazard of her own. f * Twas at the hour, when perjured spirits are said to quit their graves, and pierce with horrid yells the sepulchre— while coward-hearted guilt, afraid to fly, in maddening terror notes tbe dis¬ tant echo ; that a quivering flame gli¬ ding through the dreary cloisters of St. Gabriel, betrayed a pale figure, with slow and cautious step, pacing the go¬ thic aisle; but, as the loud clock in harsh tones proclaimed the nocturnal hour, the form suddenly retired behind some sheltering columb of the pile, and half extinguishing the lamp it carried, waited in silent awe, to count the solemn tones: need it be added this nightly wanderer was Agnes, who with hurried footstep, had quitted her lowly chamber, in order to conduct Ulric to the feet of tbe unhappy Julia. Tlie
? 87] Tlie youthful monk, unmindful of repose and lost in meditation, on hi& adored Julia, suddenly started from his seat, at the sound of a gentle hand beat* ing against the door of his cell ;— aston» ished at such an unusual circumstance. at such an hour too ! he vvas willing to imagine that the perturbed state of his mind had conjured up the idea, or that it was merely the chill wind beating against the easement as it flit¬ ted past; regardless therefore of the event, he relapsed into his former posi¬ tion and reflections. ?? after day had he as usual resorted to the Church, but Julia no longer appeared to gratify his anxious eye—innumerable and wild commotions fluctuated through his sad breast,—he invented a thousand strata¬ gems, which were as readily abandoned. Dreading detection, he did not presume to enquire into the mysterious cause of her absence, nor couid he again safely venture
[ 88]
venture to the Convent grate in his pea¬ sant's garb,—Thus musing, the knock¬ ing was asain repeated, when suddenly rising and throwing open the door, what was his surprise to witness the en¬ trance of Agnes, who as the faint beams ot the lamp fell upon her form, attired in the white-flowing vestal robes of her order, seemed to his bewildered com¬ prehension, like some supernatural visi¬ tant. " Ulric" exclaimed the Nun, in tremulous accents, " follow me, I come to guide you to her you love, since Julia's life demands the rash proceed¬ ing ;-—bear witness heaven that my design is holy/' "Fair Stranger !" interrupted Ulric, •tell me of Julia,—tell me she still ex¬ ists, that 1 may kneel and bless thee." In language hurried and almost inco¬ herent, Agnes imparted to him the par¬ ticulars of Julia's situation, with the fears
Γ 89] fears and hopes which alone could have impelled her in defiance of St. Gabri¬ el's vows, to adopt a measure so hazard¬ ous to her liberty and peace. Charm¬ ed with the noble disposition of the adventurous sister, as overjoyed with his own good fortune, Ulric imprinted a kiss upon the trembling hand of Agnes, who crossing herself in alarm, prepared to conduct him to Julia ; when for the first time, entering through the narrow iron door, whieh opened to the Nuns' department, he silently followed his guide, till she paused at the entrance of the cell, tenanted by the object of his tenderest love. Tottering with emoti¬ on, his heart beat tumultuously against his side, an unusual tremor prevailed over bis limbs, while unable to support himself, he reclined against ah opposite recess, and wiping the cold dew from his brow, gazed anxiously towards the door as Agnes entered« By
e*>3
By the glimmerings ofthe lamp, he could distinctly perceive the figure of a female in white raiment, her hands clasped, and her eyes bent steadfastly on the ground—it was Julia! his once beautiful Julia! a burst of anguish v"tmg the soul of Ulric, as he witness¬ ed the alarming change which had oc¬ curred since he last beheld her, and inwardly did he accuse himself as the author of her calamities. **Hpw fares my Julia?" enquired the tender Agnes. A deep sigh alone was the answer, but that sigh betrayed the desolation which w r oe had wrought upon the heart from whence it sprung. "Perhaps," continued Agnes timidly "could you for a moment behold Ulric, to bear him speak—to compare your sorrows, and learn from his own lips the joyous hopes which he entertains of a bright
? 9t ?
bright reward hereafter, for all those misfortunes which have divided your hands, but cemented your hearts, you you might yet be induced to smile on the pilgrimage of life." Haply/* sighed Julia" the voice of him 1 love, might yet impart a dawn of solace to my wounded soul; but why Agnes! why thus cruelly remind me of things impossible?" "Not so!" exclaimed Ulric; sudden¬ ly darting forward and sinking passion· ately at her feet, * Ulric is already here, he lives or dies with you." For a moment, like one lost to herself, Julia glanced wildly on Ulric, at length turning her enquiring eyes to¬ wards Agnes, who betrayed by the vi· vid hlushes on her cheek the anxiety she endured, conviction suddenly flashed upon
î ?«}
upon her mind, as proudly rising, she cried, *'whoart thou, that thus with un¬ hallowed and polluting footstep, presu- mest to intrude on the sacred solitude of St. Gabriels Vestals ?" "O Julia! behold me adoring at your feet, and take compassion on an unhap-r py being,, whose love for thee haa taught him to defy all dang<îr. ,, "Rash youth ! leave me, I conjure you leave me, fly tor ever tbis perilous spot, your peace-*—your safety demands it ; anr not 1 a veiled Nun—were you not wit*. ness to my vows? those sacred vows which forbid me the intercourse of your sex—¿away ! already methinks,. I bear footsteps approaching, they come to drag thee to death, or worse than death, to some dark and dreary dungeon, wherein thou wilt have nothing left but the bitter relief of cursing that treacher« ous
[93]
ous impulse which thus leads thee cm to destruction/* Ulric raised his supplicating eyes, they were suffused with tears, and heavy sighs impeded the uttterence of his emotions. Julia perceiving the agita¬ tion under which he laboured, unable longer to support her usual digni¬ ty, sunk exhausted on the bosom of Agnes; while he, the pale image of de¬ spair, still on his knees, implored her to pity and forgive him* Agnes, deeply affected at the scene, shed abundance of tears,and snatching· the veil from the angelic features of Julia, vainly endea¬ voured to recover her from the swoon into which she had suddenly fallen. Almost frantic, Ulric caught her in his trembling arms, and wildly watch¬ ing the lingring throbs of returning animation, hung fondly over the object which
[9«]
which bad infatuated his soul "Ah Julia! Julia V 1 cried he tf mielose again those azme- beaming eyes, let them in in mercy cast one parting gaze on me— on me, unhappy murderer of your peace!—say but you pity, you deplore niy fate, though they drag me to eter¬ nal night, thy seraph form shall be my star of rapture ;—thy latest words my joy of loneliness/' As some lone traveller from the moun¬ tain desert, transported, listens to the gurgling stream ; so Ulric buried in the joy of woe, welcomed the tear on Julia's glowing cheek, and bade his thirsty heart drink deep of love. " Awake me not, ? Agnes T'sobbed the reviving sufferer, **awake me not from the quiet sleep of death, but ra¬ ther, steeped in dull forgetfulftess, leave me to slumber on; thou h^re Ulric!" continued
[95]
continued she extricating herself atthe same instant from his arms/' leave me I beseech thee.'* "O Say that, you pardon me—say that we shall meet again ------------ "* "I cannot—I dare noti" "Here then, on the cold earth, let me remain for ever." "Must I too fall the victim of your rashness—is this the love of Ulric?" I had forgotten* 1 cried he starting from his abject posture. "Julia, I go^— but, must it he for ever—will not some hand invisible unbar the enyious bolts tliat bold thee from me! yes, sure the eye ofthat .alUej&rçjbing Cower, >vhjch darts below the thunder, sees and ap¬ proves the purity of my passion—were it not his decree, could I love thus t* * * " Presumptuous man î" answered Ju- im A "ought we not rather to solicit for¬ giveness

and closing the massy bolts returned sorrowfully musing to the cell Julia absorbed sn prayer, bending before the crucifix, was for a time un¬ conscious of the presence of Agnes ; at length turning with disconsolate air towards the Nun, she exclaimed " Oh ! how shall we answer this offence at the seat of High Confessional. 0 The idea fell to the soul of Agnes like «orne vivid night-flash which illumines and rends the silver surface of the deep ; the evident crime which she had volun¬ tarily committed, for the first time oc¬ curred forcibly to her mind, but the pang of remorse was a stranger in it*— the best of motives had urged her to the deed, and though the punishment of the offended Ministers of the Church might descend heavily upon her, she al¬ most conceived herself guiltless in the records of Heaven» F Interrupting
[98] Interrupting her silence, Julia resum¬ ed, " I know Agnes the benevolent intention vvhich excited you to the under¬ taking, and believe me, however other¬ wise 1 may seem, am grateful ; but must not suffer the attainments of mine own inclinations to crush thee beneath them ; true I love Ulric, yet am determined to forget him/' < c You cannot—it is impossible. " Still Julia endeavoured to persuade herself that such a design might readi¬ ly be effected, and founding her résolu- tions on the basis of religion and ho¬ nour, while forgetting the slumbering consumer which had recently bowed her to the very brink of death, she falsely imagined, as the deceiver awoke not, her heart was become impregna¬ ble to the seductions of love. The resolutions of Ulric wore a far different appearance from those of Julia
[99]
Julia, though perhaps in the balance of reason they might have poised alike. In vain did he turn his eyes to that part ofthe Church in which the luckless maid generally appeared, she had entirely deserted the spot, (( üh V' thought he, <f ~she loves me not, bow presumptuous was I to suppose it—another object more deserving, occupies her heart— maddening thought ! ? ! that I had mine enemy on some cliff, which beetling bends athwart the stormy waters, that 1 might feast me on his perishing shriekj and bless the pitiless ghost that drag¬ ged him down." From such jealous perturbations Ulric frequently resorted to reflections more tending to enfiarne his passion ; and distracted at the long absence of Julia from the Chapel, determined to invent some new stratagem of be¬ holding her—his peace depended on F 2 the
? loo] the success of his love, and unmindful of circumstances, he felt disposed to rush boldly on destiny,—to die, or live. He remembered having observed suspended in the Dormitory, clusters of keys anci¬ ently belonging to various departments of the Monastery, and privately convey¬ ing part of them to his cell, anxiously awaited the hour of midnight, to try their effects on the iron door which opened to his earthly Paradise.

"Tell ??, ï pray yoa, of some ehadowy thíag Crossing tbe trav'ller on his path of fear," <* The world was all before them, where to choose Their place of rest, and providence their guide." Milton. THE hour, which was to decide upon the hopes or fears of Ulric, at length arrived, when taking the keys from their concealment, with palpitating heart he repaired towards the iron door, which, after a variety of fruitless efforts, to the inexpressible delight of our midnight adventurer, slowly receded on its rusty F S hinge«
[102] hinges; for a moment he paused to listen, —a dead stillness hung upon the night, and gliding forn ard, Ulric had iitarly reached the cell of Julia, as a door suddenly fiew open, and a Nun, bearing a lamp, appeared h tily ap¬ proaching ; trembling with apprehen¬ sion, Ulric prepared to secrete himself, when the keys winch lie liad cuncculcd in his habit, fell tothe pavement. Alarm¬ ed at such an unusual sound, the Sistei fearfully raised her lamp, and observing bis talt figure enveloped in dark-flow¬ ing robes, fainted: the young Monk tarried not to upraise her, but abruptly retreating, retired chagrined and dis¬ appointed, to his own solitary abode. . The Sister Agatha, who had fallen to the earth, was discovered in the same situation by two Nuns, ivho, alarmed at her cries, had hastily quitted their pal¬ lets, and gently raising the object of their
[103] their consternation, they conducted her to the nearest cell. In a few moments all was confusion and terror, the Sisters unmindful of re¬ pose, flocked round the bewildered Agatha, in order to listen to her wild tales of the supposed Appartion, which she declared stood near the entrance of Julia's door, and which she firmly be¬ lieved to be the perjured spirit of that lady's mother; some crossed themselves for dread, while others hastened to the Abbess with intelligence of the event, and on the ensuing àety a solemn mass was chaunted to St, Gabriel, for repose of the wandring spectre, in which Ulric united his voice. Julia readily con¬ jectured the supposed ghost to be Ulric, but how it was possible for him to gain admission, exceeded her comprehension, since the keys were still in the possession of Agnes. F 4 At
104]
At length sbe was utmost willing to join in the general belief which pre¬ vailed through the Monastery, and after the honr of twilight, detained the Nuns captives to their Cells or led them forth in groups to follow their devotional callings. Secretly exulting in the unexpected success ofhis stratagem, Ulric determin¬ ed once again to ventare towards the retirement of Julia, who had vainly essayed to banish him from her recol¬ lection, and although she endeavoured to conceal the weakness of her nature, her friend guessed too readily at the passing struggles of her unabated passion. At the accustomed hour^ unin¬ terrupted by a single obtrusive occur¬ rence, Ulric knocked softly at Julia's door·—in a few moments it was opened to him by Agnes, who subdued by the supplicating influence ofhis looks, had no
[105]
no power to bid him depart; Julia pale and dejected, was languidly reclining on a couch—in an instant he sank on his knees before her, and tenderly enquir¬ ing into the delicate state of her health, perceived that her eyes were moist with team,—she did not a& formerly, command him to retire, but suBered him to press her trembling hand in his; she had combated with her better reso¬ lution, till the effort had almost ceased to be meritorious, since not only her own happiness, but that of others so apparently depended on it, and alas! might eitherways be crushed in her decision. While Ulric yet held the hand of Julia to his lips, and silently mingled his tears with her's, at the painful rè- membrance of those laws, which stern¬ ly prohibited the encouragement of their mutual loves, under conviction of F 5 eternal
? loe j eternal perdition; Agnes sympathizing iu their distress, hung sadly over them. Surely sighed she, " it cannot be the intention of the Deity to debar his creatures from the society of each other—was ii to avoid aU intercourse with our race we vere created t —to shroud ourselves in sullen gloom, like noisome weeds, tainting the caverned air—must Man the noblest effort of his Maker, an abject and unthankful being, fiy from the charms of life, while ani¬ mals, insensible to wretchedness, loved by their kind, range freely through the vallies! why is the cloistered pile alone deemed holy ? who would not raise his heart upon the hill, and gazinsr on the lavish charms of nature, pour his full soul to that Omnipotent, who sheds from his golden urn the silver vesper- dew, and tints with invisible pencil, the webless texture of the rose ! are we not told that <ς Heaven is Love"—if then
[107] then Love be of so sacred an origin, what better can animate the human breast ? He who formed us his favoured representatives, surely would delight, rather than murmur at our congeniality." as Agnes thus reasoned, (although her reasonings may appear rash and futile, they were the inmates of a benevolent and sensible mind, divested of that sel¬ fishness peculiar to man) she raised her swimming eyes to heaven and im¬ plored the blessings of providence on the heads of Ulric and Julia. Prom this period, their nocturnal meetings became frequent ; Julia rapid¬ ly conquered her indisposition, and Ulric already began to form schemes for tlieir quitting the Convent. Agnes and Julia possessed many valuable trin¬ kets, among which the latter had a rosary of diamonds ; it was agreed when next Ulric journeyed to attend any of P6 the
? 108 J the sick peasantry that he should convey this gem to a town not far distant, and dispose of it to a wealthy Jew residing therein, in order to supply them with the necessary means of existence,, to¬ wards whatever part of the world fate might direct their waiiderings. Mm opportunity of executing sucfc ac trans* action shortly occurred, when carefully concealing the treasure, Ulric secretly entered to the habitation of Father Emanuel and offered it for sale. The old miser eyeing the crucifix with some degree of satisfaction,eagerly demanded the statement of its price, ' f That*' replied Ulric, " must rest entirely upon your own decision, and when I inform you, one of our holy order to whom it belongs, intends to expend its value in charitable purposes for the honour of St. Gabriel, I feel aware you will not object to give me the total amount õf its worth ! '* at these artless obser¬ vations
[100] vations a sarcastic smile gilded the aged features of Emanuel, and hastily putting aside the object of their discus¬ sion, he counted a hundred pieces of gold into Ulric's hand, as a return for the same. Unacquainted with the nature of money, the lovets eye beam¬ ed rapturously upon the sum, which he imagined almost inexhaustible ; and has¬ tening back to St.Gabriels, with all the ardent and air-drawn promises of youth¬ ful fancy before him, he resorted as usual to Julia and Agnes, who welcomed his arrival and success with emotions of unfeigned delight, and the following midnight was appointed as the safest hour in which to effect their escape from the Monastery. The happiest period perhaps of Ulric's life, at length lingeringiy ap¬ proached, and repairing tothe ir on door, he awaited not long etc the appearance of
? »»?] of his gentle companions at once satisfied his doubts and fears as to ihe fortitude of iheir resolutions. Agnes pale and agitated, no longer capable of affording support to Julia, bung trem¬ blingly on tier arm. In compliance to their earnest entreaties, and Julia*s tears, she had consented to become a partner in tbe emigration, hut as the moment of trial approached, felt her¬ self iit*le calculated to pursue ihe task she had so heroically under taken. The finger of Ulric was on his lip,as leading ihem to his cell he threw open the nar¬ row lattice which offered access to the gardens of the Cloister, and hastily glid¬ ing down the most retired walk, silently conaucted them to a breach in the wall which admitted entrance to the surrounding forests. In all her beauty rode the silvery moon, surrounded by her myriads of revolving
? ? i revolving spheres, reflect ing their gold¬ en fires over the azure zones of Heaven. Tbe d n of death was on the slumber¬ ing er, , ι, sav e when lne far-off chime of Con v ei.; bell awoke with sulien voice the lament of Echo. l*>ng drawn shadows of the loft \ pine crossing the pilgrim's path, and frequently bursting mto rudely^antastic figures, startled his drowsy imagination, to the grey, misty, and half-formed phantasms of other worlds ; and often did the fugitives of St. Gabriel pause alarmed to gaze upon tlie blasted Oak, which attired i u its sheet of moonlight terror, seemed like some centiiiel lo cross their pathway, and watch the fearful advaoces of their nocturnal flight. As they attained a distant eminence, Agnes for the last time, stopped to cast a farewell gaze on the Convent's spires, which appeared faintly glimmering throuarh
[112]
ing through the foliage. It was a home she was voluntarily deserting for ever, and though confinement had been her destiny in those walls, peace had been its companion* A thousand remembran¬ ces crowded to her mind, in which the recollection of tranquillity and independ¬ ence, almost taught her to regret the step she had taken. So it is, when the hand of death, snatches for ever from our intercourse, that which we knew not how to prize, those errors, once the objects] of our chief regret, sink with it to the tomb, while virtues, till then unperceived,, fall with magnified lustre on our sight, and at length, in the glance of retrostection, we are led [to deplore tbe loss of that hap- iness, which we had not the foresight to hold or to estimate. Silently lost in thought, Agnes accom¬ panied our lovers on their pilgrimage, and
C ns] and the merry lark, as he left his mossy cradle, to pipe a matin hymn on the topmost pinnacle of heaven, beheld them, many leagues from the monastery of St. Gabriel, occasionally slaying at the Forrester's door to solicit re¬ freshment or repose. At the eve of the third day, they came to a valley on the borders of an immense forest. The sides of this romantic glen were verged w r ith lofty branches of the wide-spreading beach tree, imparting a brown and pen¬ sively sweet retirement, impervious to the parching noon-tide ray, or tbe piti¬ less pelting, of the northern, howling storm. A pellucid rivulet, meandering through beds of fragrant herbs, watered tbe vale—giving its dimpling cheek tò the sighing gossamer, which like a se¬ cond Narcissus, bent wooingly over its glassy surface, and falling from a lofty declivity through beds of broken rock, into a lake, poured forth a pleasing sound
[114] sound, congenial to the romantic so¬ litude of a scene, so wild—so lovely, that it might well have been deemed the re¬ sort of sedge crowned Sisters, or the fa¬ vourite solitude of some water Spirit. Not far distant, an aspiring mountain reared its wood-clad summit* com¬ manding an extensive prospect of the surrounding country; a few cottage* irregularly scattered on its sides, whose white tops peeping through the green¬ wood, and pouring forth their little curl¬ ing columns of smoke, excited the ad¬ miring breast to emotions of humble contentment and domestic tranquillity. To one of these cabins, our wanderers repaired and delighted with the genuine hospitality of the peasants, who endea¬ voured to outvie each other in artk ss at¬ tentions, Julia expressed a wish to re¬ main among them for ever ? she was charmed with the witcheries of the place and
? И? and the peaceful seclusion of the glen united with her ideas of of earthly hap¬ piness, Ulric ever anxious to anticipate her desires, purchased ? cottage which had more than the rest excited their admi- ration,from being placed upon the mar¬ gin of the lake and over-canopied with lofty trees, The Woodman, their host readily undertook to purchase such arti¬ cles for them, at a town some league· distant, as should be considered either necessary for their use or amusement. In the extremity of the valley a mcHn- choly Anchorite had built his lowly cell, atthe altar of which, Julia in the pre¬ sence of Agnes and the happv cottager's, who made a holiday on the occasion, surrendered her hand to the enraptur- red Ulric. Thus, serenely resting on the bosom of
f »6 3 of peace, they resolved to pass the remainder of their lives in seclusion, and soliciting forgiveness for their offen¬ ces, from One whose mercy had ren¬ dered thera already so blessed. Ulric toiled in the garden and by his indus¬ try procured the means of support in a manner more luxuriant than the Con¬ vent had afforded ; -sometimes with hw bow upon his arm, be pursued the wild fowl from her retreat of rushes,, at ©thers accompanied by Juliaand' áž^nes^ «teered his rustic bark along the expau* sive lake». Sometimes, when tbe sinking sun¬ beams were seen behind the mou n lain, would they also repair to the grey roots of a venerable Oak which drew upon its height—the heart of each was alike susceptible to the beauties of nature, and the loveliness of prospect from this eminence was of no common order; the rich:
?И? rich and particoloured foliage spreading its leafy vest, studded with the grey turrets of Convent and Castle, scarcely admitted the aching sight to pause upon the verdant meadows of waving grass, save when the red deer, starting from some secret lair, excited the eye to watch its sinuous trace;* while stealing from the underwood to slake its burning tìiirst in the lake. Alone in tbe peace¬ ful vale hung the little cabin inhabited by Ulric and his companions—around its sides were entwined the vine, the woodbine, and the rose ; while the holy- oak, the sweet briar, and the piony, twisted into uniform groups, beautified the woodland terrace that surrounded it-—over the mossy ascent to which, two wide-spreading chesnut trees, sha¬ ded a rural chair, that by its easy simplicity seemed to hold forth a hospi¬ table invitation to the admiring stranger. ^* There is nothing so interesting as the book

It would be tedious to our readers, were we to dwell minutely upon eaeh f circumstance attending Ulric and Julia through two summers of uninterrupted barmony; during which, the latter presented her husband with a son, that we shall have occasion to mention here¬ after, by the appellation of Valentine, the name assigned by Ulric, from the circumstance of his being born on St. Valentine'» Eve.

STO« The Reader, ere now, will have entertained sone concern for the fate of Matilda, after her flight from the Bri· dal Chamber. On entering the woods, fear added wings to her feet, and fancy pictured to her terrified imagination, the forms of Reginald and her Father, uniting iu lé it
? mj pursuit ofher; having ran, however, to a considerable distance from the Castle of St. Julien, she paused beneath the extensive branches of a sheltering tree, where, ready to sink with fatigue, she «eated herself on the gràss,and gave free indulgence to her tears. At length, the rosy streak of light in the eastern sky, and the perfume of numberless flowers steeped in tbe silver dews of morning, awoke her recollection and induced her to wander on, least the Vassals of the Castle should overtake her,and restore her to the dreaded arms, from which she had so recently escaped. On the evening of the second day, having received no other nourishment than such as the wild brambles afforded, forlorn and weary, she sat on the margin ofa mossy-bordered stream, and earnest¬ ly prayed fot death : the last rays of the setting
[178]
setting sun were sinkinsr behind the fo¬ liage, and the dark clouds of the nor¬ thern sky, towering into uncouth forms, frowned awfully portentous of a raid- night storm. u Alas !" sighed the unhappy Matilda, " must this turf become my unknown bier? O Evlin! little thinks4 thou on the agony I endure—little dreamstthou of my wanderings in this pathless wil¬ derness, wherein 1 have no prospect but of perishing : haply thou deentst me faithless to my vows—the willing partner of St. Julien's greatness, and learns't thy tongue to curse my hapless name/* While she thus continued to deplore her misfortunes, distantly howled the loud thunder, and already the yivid lightning glimmered through the trees. " O God !" exclaimed the Fugitive, "no 1 5 house
t irøi
hoase, no home, no succour!" and cast¬ ing her hopeless eyes around, the figure ofa venerable old man, leaning on hit statf, excited her attention ; a burst of exquisite joy, at the sight of a human being escaped the lips of Matilda as he approached, and throwing hersetf at hb feet, she earnestly besought his pity. With some degree of surprise, the Hermit raised her from the earth, and meekly enquiring into the cause of her sorrow Matilda,, related to him the rea¬ son of her appearance in a place, so ill according with her higb rank ; and the circumstances attending her clandestine marriage; but,recollecting the stern in¬ junction of her Father, she ventured not, at first, to disclose either her own Bame or that of Evlin. The richness of Matilda's apparai> however, bespoke the truth of her asser¬ tion»

tions» "Lean on me" cried the siiven» hatred Recluse/ c that I may conduct you towards my cell, which is not far dis* fent, and in which you may remain un¬ discovered/* The fair wanderer grate¬ fully accepted the proposal, and accom* panied him to his habitation, situated in one of the most intricate parts of the forest. It was no regular mansion, such as men generally frequent, biit a cavern hollowed out of the rock, with much art, being divided into several apartments of the most convenient order. The en¬ trance ¡to this hermitage, opened upon a small and verdant lawn» bordered with eraggs, on the tops of which, hanging shrubs and oak-branches wrought an unpenetrable barrier—a streamlet of clear water, gliding, from some secret source, down the rocks, entered a cave on the opposite side, through whieh it was necessary for the tenante of tive Her¬ mit's dwelling to pass: a rude boat how* 1 6 ever
tim j ever, readily stemmed the torrent and conveyed Matilda and her guide to the strand. There was somthing, so bewitching, so fascinating in this solitude,that it cast a pleasingly serene sensation over Ma¬ tilda's bosom—so lone, so tranquil it seemed/that even the wood robin, un¬ mindful of their approach, sat calmly on the cowering, spray, and sweetly piped its hymn of thankfulness. During this time, the threatening storm had re¬ treated and twilight thrown her vesper mantle over surrrounding objects, not less lovely in their·gloom. "Ah!" thought Matilda with a sigh, <f in the society of Evlin, how happily could I pass my days in this peaceful seclusi¬ on, no distractions of - human great* ness, could molest our peace^—no* envy of earhtly malice destroy our joys;" her reflections were here interrupted by the Hermit
? 182 3 Hermit exclaiming» "Zelinda ! dear Ze*» linda ! I have brought thee an unex* pected guest." At these words, a matron, attired in deep mourning, made her appearance from the cell, sheobserved Matilda with some degree of attention, but not with rudeness; and, on being informed of her situation by the Seer, stretched forth her hand with a smile of welcome. The benevolent strangers persuaded Matilda to retire early to repose, since the pale and haggard look of her cheeh proclaimed bow much she was overcome by fatigue. On the following mornin<r, Zelinda found her feverish and dejected ; she endeavoured to rise, but in vain, and many months elapsed, ere, in defiance of human efforts, the gentle, suffering Matilda, was a ain able to leave her couch» ι Witk
? 188 3 With the first dawn of health an<i reason, arose early to her recollection, the remembrance of her husband, and confiding in Zelinda, she expressed a wish that be could be apprized ot her situation, and tbe immutability of her vows. . The amiable woman, ready to comply with any thing which could re* «tore peace to the bosom of her guest, informed her of some Woodcutters, re¬ siding on the borders of the forest, to which the Hermit would repair, early in the morning, and request one of them to convey a message from her to Evlin* Overjoyed at a prospect which promis¬ ed so fair a reward for all her past mise¬ ries, Matilda rapturously imprinted a kiss on the Matron's cheek, and in¬ stantly retired to address an epistle, filled with tenderness, to her husband ì nor sooner had aspiring Phaeton ascen¬ ded his golden chariot, than the Hermit repairing to some trusty Peasant, com* missioned
f 184 ] missioned him, with a suitable reward,, to deliver the letter safe into those* hands for vvhich it was designed. At the entrance to the hermitage, a rugged bench and stone table, which stood beneath the overhanging rock, afforded a pleasing and cool retreat from the scorching rays of the summer sun. In this enchanting retirement Matilda deîi*>*hted to share the converse and frugal meal ofher hosts. The wild, pink-clad thyme,and the tufts of yellow flowers scattered around, breathing their balmy perfume, exalted, with vo- luptous emotion, the soul to extatic de- delight; while the witcheries ofthe rude¬ ly natural landscape, added to the half- heard gurgling of the partially seen, silver winding waters, impressed forci¬ bly upon the enquiring mind,a due sense of admiration towards the great God of Nature«. Fain
? 185 1 u Pain would 1 learn,'* said Mafiida as they sat at their usual repast, " how a spot so lovely, so bewitching, and which, from its almost inaccessible bar- rier, nature appeared to reserve for her own fantastic bower, should have attracted your earliest observation." The Hermit, smiling at her request, kindly offered not only to relaie the cause ofhis becoming an inhabitant of the cell, but the adventures of his past life, which might serve to divert the mind ofhis guest till the arrival ofher anxiously expected Evlin. Matilda charmed with such unusual marks of confidence in a stranger, offered him her thanks for the indulgence, and he commenced as follows. THE HERMITS STORY. My Father, Baron Fitz Alan, was a nobleman of high estate; and re¬ nowned
C 186 ? renowned in the annals of his country both by the towering height of ances¬ try and the illustrious fame of his own warlike deeds. My Mother, who I have understood possessed all the requisites of a great and noble mind, died in giving birth to me, and from which unhappy circum¬ stance I may date the period of my misfortunes; since my Father, who Was passionately attached to his wife, might, at her gentle instigation have been content to look with less severity on the errors of his only son. From the decease of my Mother, I shall pass over a lapse of twenty sum¬ mers, spent in the insensible felicity of childhood, and the follies of youth; at the termination of vvhich I was sud¬ denly summoned from my travels, in or¬ der to solicit the fair hand of a rich and
[187 3
and powerful Heiress, whose lands hj contiguous to those of Fitz Allan Cas* tie. 1 confess the respect which I en¬ tertained for the author of my existence, was very distant from inspiring me with a desire to comply with the pecu· ??? nature ofhis commands, since, in* stead of readily acquiescing to them, I unhesitatingly refused even to behold the lady his kindness had selected to ren* der me happy,- which incensed the Baron to such a voilent degree, that he not only threatened to disinherit, but to cast me off for ever* In a few days after, however, he again sent for roe to hie apartment, but judge of ray surprise, when in oppo* sition to the rules of all common order» I found him attended, not merely by the Guardian, but by the Lady Isabella herself, who unconscious of the decep* tion imposed ???? her, had been ??* requested
Γ 188 3 quested by Lord Fitz Allan to enter hii mansion under pretences of a nature totallv foreign to the actual design. That Isabella had charms, it would ? impossible to deny, but the thwarting spirit of youth had so steeled my breast against them, that it was not probable, the stratagem, to eifect which the Baron had been at such considerable pains, would in the least tend to accel· lernte our union. On the departure of his guests, the Baron eagerly demanded my opinion of Isahella. With some degree of con* sternation, I replied; that roy inclinati* ons were not so much indulged as those of the vassals around me, who, at least, had the felicity of selecting partner» for themselves.

I shall not dwell upon each particu¬ lar occurrence, but merely state, that after some little hesitation, Fitz Alan's overtures to Isabella, through the repre¬ sentation ofher Guardian, so far pre¬ vailed, that she consented to give me her band. í must confess it occasioned me some disagreeable sensations to impose on the amiable qualities of this young lady, since to have loved her would have been no difficult task, but for the recol¬ lection of the apparent force exercised over my inclinations; however, as I had not completed my travels, in obedi* ence to the Baron's commands, 1 again prepared to quit the mansion of my birth, and even Isabella, with a de¬ gree of regret. Some time had elapsed, and the ves¬ sel in which I had embarked was swiftly conveying rae to other climes, when a midnight storm suddenly arose. So dark«
? hø ] so terrible, were the elements, that as the torches' glare played across the fea¬ tures of the Mariners I coM perceive them pale with emotions of horror and despair. O! then did 1 repent niy own rashness, for which I had fallen to de¬ traction, and inwardly repine at the overbearing spirit that induced me to resign my home, and the yielding hand of Isabella : but, alas ! my reflections Were of short duration, for a sudden wave breaking in upon the vessel, bore me, with inveterate force,along the world of sea ; at first, overwhelmed with the unexpected blow, I was fast sinking into eternity, till a momentary gleam of reason awoke me to a sense of dau- ger, and excited my exertions to the first law of nature, self preservation- long and fearful was tbe struggle ;át length, totally exhausted, I sunk faint- on a bed of rocks, towards which alone, the hand of Providence, in that awful night must have conveyed me. For
C w 1 summit ofthe rocks, with indescribable joy I discovered the form of a vessel, from the sides of which, several dark figures descending into an open boat, made for the bland. Tmnsported at once again beholding the resemblance of a human being, hastily running towards the strangers as they landed, ï threw myself at their feet, and im¬ plored their compassion. At first, surprised by the wtldness of my manners and attire, they recoiled as I approached ; but, observing- the sup¬ plicating attitude in which Ibtiil remain¬ ed, at last they addressed me in a lan¬ guage totally foreign ; it was by signs, therefore, ï expressed to thefti my de¬ sire of entering their bark, to which, after some little survey of the Wand, they consented to convey me. It was the galley of a Pirate— ??? Chief

" O Hemayæ ! save thyself and me—^ snatch thy Zelinda from the arms of Hasràc —how could'st thou bear to see her in thy rivals possession? or witness her last sad virgin look at thee, of an¬ guish and reproach. 4 At these words, my soul became suddenly en flamed with love and jealousy, when, tak¬ ing the key from MandaneîSihand, I unlocked my fetters, and; however I might have preferred death to any other object, without Zelinda, prepared to fol¬ low wherever my guide thought proper to direct.

Let me, therefore, dwell briefly upon the period of my arrival at the Castle of Fitzalan. My Father was still living ; but, on receiving the unpleasing intel¬ ligence of my marriage with Zelinda, refused to see me, and denied that wel* eøVne y which, as his son, 1 had a right to expect. The aged Steward alone, 'be¬ held my leception with tears; and at the intercession of this worthy man, I receføedfrom my father a trifling sum, with which ï retired, still happy, in the enjoyment of Zelinda's love, to a lonely cottage near the dwelling ofthe Gover¬ ness ; whose husband escaped from a va¬ riety of troubles, yet lived to rejoice at, and* welcome-*her return. L 2 In
* ïn this manner we continued· for -a length of time, in which -Zelinda gave birth toa sou, endowed t\ith all its Mo¬ ther's charms ; but, alas! as the Child grew in years, one fatal day, playing on the borders of a neighbouring forest, the wild flowers seduced his wandering feet among the briary underwood, and ere his shrieking motber whosatwatch- *mg his innocent gambols, could extri¬ cate him from the wilderness, he had suddenly fallen through some secret ca- ^ityof an ancient mine, and disappear¬ ed for ever, in vain were our cries upon his name, in vain did we endea¬ vour to explore with torches the sub¬ terranean cavern ; no clue which.mighi lead to a discovery of bis fate could *be attained. Ah ! lady, if I bad before tasted deeply of- sorrow, it now appeared that I was doomed to swallow its bitterest dregs ; for what can equal that anguish, which the inconsolable distraction, of a wife
? «84 J wife, lamenting her offspring's fall, ef¬ fects upon the mind of an adoring bus- band ; or the conviction that his hapless child rests unburied, on the same dark rock where it had expired—no mother's tear to dew its icy cheek ; no father's hand to close its lifeless eyes. Overwhelmed by the loss of her favo¬ rite, and the deranged state of my Ze¬ linda's mind, the Governess did not long survive^—My Father too, unforgiving to the last, before death, surrendered his ?????··*». ¡?*? #1?? l»Qrifİ£> ?? ??""'"'1"1 í^íT^LíClty ??1?/ HIV II4IIU9 \Jl Ot« O.Í IgCTI O f allowing only a small income to supply my wanls, till the lost Heir of Fitz Alan should be discovered.

" Be comforted my child, said the Hermit," since you have no cause to re¬ proach yourself; death is [a tribute we must all submit to, and, perhaps, duly considered, would leave less impression of regret on the survivors mind.

Lvíín thanked the fïermit for his kind- ness, and uniting in his persuasions to Matilda, she became resigned, and, on the following day, was enabled to share in domestic conversation. The cell, being adorned with several Turkish portraits, which had formerly belonged to the Governess,*hey excited, from their masterly execution, the admiration of Evlin. Fitzalan, ready to resort to any means which might serve to divert the sadness of Matilda s spirite, proposed shewing them several rich miniatures, pYeserved in a curious cabinet of ebony, ift an adjoining apartment; but, no sooner had hë produced the first, a like¬ ness óf Zelinda's mother, than Evlin, giifcing wildly upoh ít, turned pále.

There is great morality however. continued Ulric deeply sighing, in this rude ballad ; vows are better never made, than made to be broken— ? Re¬ nard! I have suffered much, and I have beheld others, dearer than myself, while sympathizinir in my sorrows, sinking under the burthen of their own—from the committal of this very error.

Kenard, this purpose to my peace is precious ; therefore, I charge you, by the promise »i\en, make no delay,'but on with him, the wretched Ulric, on, to retribution."

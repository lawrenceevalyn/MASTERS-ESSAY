Disappointed and moi¬ tified, I burst into teais, the audience attributed my distress, to embanassinent, and redoubled their plaudits the ladies handed their smelling-bottles over the boxes , and the gentlemen thionged be¬ hind the scenes Ashamed to occasion such disturbance, I begged peimission to retne a iew moments, when I hoped to 'i recover
neover from α temporary indisposition to vihich I said I was sub|ect, fortunately \\ illmot did not seem to recollect ine, and Mrs \nnesly with muth kindness attended me to my apartment, and entreated me so earnestly not to spoil the evening's enter¬ tainment, for which she hod made such expensive prepaiations, that I again went on the stage, and received much unmerited applause The next day, when I met Sir Lawrence, he enquired if I had made my determination I assured hnn I felt the most lively gratitude for the interest he took in my behalf, and would place my conduct under his direction He then told me that his cousin, Mrs Mellish, wanted just such a companion, and he trusted that, as she was a most amnble woman, her having three lovely ehil iren wou'd be na objection on my side, as the) had proper attendants I was sincerely rejoiced at the jirospect of leiving my jircsent situation loi ont so eligible, and repeated my thanks I am to give Mrs Annesly notice
notice to-morrow. When I am settled you shall hear from me again. " I remain, dear Eliza, " Your Affectionate, " Azelia."
A trivial circumstance occurred yesterday, wliich I had nearly forgot. As J was standing in the balcony with Mrs, Annesly, two gentlemen passed, one of them I knew to be your Vauxhall favourite ; he fixed his eyes on us for some time, but neither bowed nor smiled, and when he had passed, seemed to loiter ; and once turned to call his dog, but perceiving 1 looked that way he hurried on. Mrs. Annesly says she sees him every day.

JM.RS Anncsly was too much piqued to solicit Azelia to remain , but told hei she was welcome to quit her whenever it suited herself, that as she had been hand¬ somely treated, .and thcy had made np previous agreement, she supposed she would not expect any remuneration for her seivices the two months she had been with her , but, as she did not wish to be shabby, she would make her a present of two
tis о guineas to defray the expences ol removing Azelia returned hei thanks, but declined her libel al offer, and observ ed, smilmg, that as she was just then out of cash, she would onl\ beg her to distribute one guinea among the seivants, on her account Mrs Annesly snd, haughtily, she might do a;» she pleased , and the footman just then entenng to lemme the bieakfast, Azeita gave him one ofthe guineas which Mrs Annesly had put on the table, request¬ ing him to piocure hei a coach, in the couise of an houi, hinting, that he was to divide the money equally with the two femile servmts The expence she had been at, to make a suitable appearance while with Mrs Anneslj, had completely impoverished her, but isshedidnot wish others to suffei by her false pride, she reconciled herself to the acceptance ofa guinea so grudgingly bestowed The capricious Mis Annedy, findmgshe was about to lose an attendant so service¬ able, had given vent to her resentment, in a manner
manner, the most insulting to ЛгеЬа , and had tauntingly reproached her with iflectation. Lady-like airs, hypocrisy, and various other degrading nusconstiuc- tions of her conduct This behaviour considerably lessened the sense of obliga¬ tion which our heroine might have felt for formei kindness and attention, which she now ph'tily peiceived was meiely the result of selfishness When she arnv ed at Gmldford-street, the residence of Mrs Mellish she wasshewn into a parloui wheie that lady wis sitting with her young family, lhe eldest of whom seemed about eleven years of age, and was busily employed making some knotting for funge —the youngest girl was leading at her mothei's knee—and * hne boy, ibout four years old, was mounted on a beiutiful locking-horse, md learning the arts of the memge from Sir Lawrence Lester, who stood beside him He turned round as A/eba entered, and smiling, said— "You are come intnrte,MissHa¿ely, 1 was being
being bantered by my cousin here, on y our iccount, but I know that blushing cheek will prov c iny acquittal ' Mrs Mellish put liei fìnger to heı lips, in a moment the reading ceased, the rocking-horse stood still, and the little girl cast her eyes down upon her work, which were at first fixed on Azelia " You must not mmd my rittle brained cousin, said Mrs Mellish, " if you are the young lady mentioned to me, by the name ofHizely, I cm assure you, his account of you has been such, as makes me happy m receiving you into -ny family ' A/elia bowed, and felt much pleasure at this kind ıeceptıon Mrs Mellish was a most agreeable figure fair, delicate, and genteelly dressed , she appeared fo suffer by an ill statt of health , but her looks and accent vvere cheerful " We will not enter into the minutiæ of business just now, ' sud she , " but Caro İma shall shew you your little apartment If any accommodation is wanting, which you
. you may havebeen used to, makeit known without fear, and I will order it for you. I shall dress at three, when I will talk fur¬ ther withyou. You may either remain in your own chamber, or join the servants in the house-keeper's room." Carolina then put do,wn her work, and went before Azelia to an apartment neatly furnished ; pointed to a bell, which hung on the outside, and told her, when that rung, she must attend her Mamma in the room beneath her's ; and then, with a smile anda nod, tripped down stairs. When Azelia attended Mrs. Mellish, she found it was not so much to assist her in dressing, as to learn the regulations of the family. Sir Lawrence has informed me, Miss Hazely said she, that you are very ac¬ complished, which is a great satisfaction to me, as I undertake the important task of educating my own children ¿ and though they have regular masters in thç moţe diffi¬ cult branches of study, which women are seldom fully competent to teach, it is vot. π ' с much
much more eligible foi them to be in the society of well bred persons, than among ignorant domestics , for which reason 1 tiust Ihcm very little i»i the nursery, as the idle superstitious habits and ideas they ronti ictlheie, aie seldom, if ever eradi¬ cated I nevci go abroad, except for nu and exercise, and, that I might not bc called fiom the attention I wish to pay to my children, I see no company Mr Mellish has paities sometimes, when I merely fill my place at table, and gladly withdraw fiom scenes inimical to the plan of domestic seclusion I hove marked out for myself But there is one thing, not unusually enquired into I own, but whi h is a matenal considciation with me I hope you have had a moral and religious educi¬ tion 1 am of the Protestant chuich of England, and do not like any division in the tenets of my household, though I am not bigot enough to condemn every other iorm of foith The icply of Azelia wos entnely to her satisfaction,
satisfaction, and our heroine soon found, in the gentle piety and exemplary conduct of Mrs Mellish, the charms of religion, which, through a variety of untowa d circumstances, she had hitherto too much neglected That amiable lady treited her with a degree of kindness and distinction, which ever affords the most heartielt satis¬ faction to a dependint, yet, with pam, Azelia perceived that a secret unhappiness preyed upon the mmd of her esteemed patroness, noi knew that her very vu tue was the souice of her misfortune, though a trivial incident soon levelled, to the observing Azelia, a secret, which Mrs Mellish thought it her duty to conceii fi om cveiy one as much as she possibly could Hei mode of education was rathei singular; she never allowed her children any dis¬ tinction 01 advantage on account of se¬ niorit) , but rather taught the eldest to give the youngest piefeience, in conside¬ ration of then weikness md imbecility thereby exciting a geneious emulation, in ι '2 point
point of self denial Love and harmony bubsisted undisturbed among them, the domestics respected theirmistiess toomuch to babble about what family affairs came withm then knowledge , and Mrs Mellish knew too well the interest of herself and chıldıen, to let every transaction come withm the observation of her household Her method of punishing a transgression, was also different fi om that ofmost mothers, who make themselves the sole object of love or terror Cordelia, hei secontl daughtei had one da), on being struck by her brother in momentary indignation, used an imprecation which she had too often heaid, but scarcely knew the import of Shocked at what she heard and well knowing the souice from whence it sprung, Mrs Mellish darted an angry look at the gnl, whose quick eye instantly read her fault in her mother s features, hei little lips fell, her cheek reddenetl, and, with a tear m each eye, asked—Are you displeased Mamma ? " To
" To be sure I am, wicked child," said her mother " You have suffered youi turbulent temper to rise against a helpless infant, you have used an expiession which makes ine shudder Havel not olten told you such language was sinful ?" " Papi often sajs so,"replied Cordeln, and you do not call hnn wicked ' Mrs Mellish turned to Azelia— " How cautious, my dear, should paients be to keep their children from witnessing any impropriety of word or action , ev en tlus infant has caught at what was nndv er- tantly uttered, though I endeavoui ill in my power to keep hei fiom all unpiopei example —Your Papa, I im sorry to saj it, learned that bad woid from somebody who was wicked, and he had no Manimi to correct hnn , if he did say it, he made atonement " " And so w ill I Mamma, I am very sorry, foigive me too " " You have not offended me Cordelia, kneel down theie, and ask pudon, of c j Hun
Him who gives you ЬГе and health ıııd happiness md blessed you with pirents to teich you how to serve him to pray to lum for his goodness —It is him you hive offended ind to hım jou mııstıppcıl for pudon The little rreaturo instantly knelt down at a chair and repeated with earnestness, ill the simple pnyers she knew, while Mrs Mellish, turning te Azelia, with a placid smile said— " This scene seems to surpnse you , I know it is an unusual mode of proceeding» but it was a system with me even before I procured that admired author, who says, " I consider it the greatest art of moral education, to give religion a due anã permanent effeñ on the mind, and to use every means of confit ming its influence till it grows into a deep and resolute habit, which no mctdents or vicissitudes may in future dislodge Azelia in this transaction, simple as it was, discovered what the prudence and gentleness
gentleness of Mrs. Mellish had hitherto conceiled, and it needed not great pene- tntion to conclude that she was unfortu¬ mtely allied to a man of principles, far moie relaxed thin her own , and in this opinion Azelia was further confirmed, when the encreasing confidence and esteem ofher kind mistress, gave her a se it at then family table , where she heaid impre¬ cation supply the place of argument, and enforce obedience fiom the trembling domestics Mr Mellish was, m gay parties, fhe soul of conviviality, well informed, high spinted, and possessing a fund of good humoui , but the love of absolute supremacy absorbed every olher consider¬ ation , /ns voice was ever loudest, his con¬ ceptions most correct, his determinations most judicious, and his taste indubitable , these errors were the fruits of early indul¬ gence, and an m itable temper, yet he had his good qualities, obscured as they were by extieme vanity and absolute power, the temper of Mrs Mellish was of ihat miiet c i nature
niture which extended itself to hti spirits, she shrunk alık« from the bois tcrous mirth of her husband, 01 the still more vociferous rutmour of his resentment, and often retreated in tears fiom the .iportment On one of these occasions, Azelia shockedbyhisimpiety.andsincerely sympathising with the sufferings of о delicate mind under such gross tieatment, ventured to ехргегз her surprise, that beings so uncongenial in their manners and pursuits, should ever have enteied into such an indissoluble engagement " My dear girl,' said Mrs Mellish, " marriage is seldom thought seriously about, till the tie is irievocobly made, and even those who are most prudent in their determination, too often let passion or prejudice throw down then air-built reso¬ lutions fhe lover is not to be called such, if be cannot assimilate his manners to the taste oflus mistress, and iewwomen, befoie marriage, have opportunities of looking beyond the surface of a charactei , or if they
they hive prejudice thiows i ftlse covering over the picluie When I first knew Mr Mellish I wis eighteen had liwivs lesideclin thecoimtiy consequently knew little of the levities ofi town life Mellish cuncdown on ι visit to my fither— he hid long been known in the funily —he was a y oung mm of promising talents md pleasing manners—he was a student in the 1 empie md though not possessed of ι hrge fortune seemed to possess abilities w uch ilmost ensured his success m the profession I un very sony to siy thatl cai iny reputed propeity first ittncted his itfention however it miy be he pud me such fhttenng distinctions is quickly won my fivour he adopted his taste to mine, seemed to enjoy w th ine rural pleisurcs, of which he declared he had befoie no conception and expressed a most ardent desire for the diy when his own exertions should produce him a peaceful competence, when he might retire with the woman of his heut to cííím contemplative scenes and с Ь enjoy

CHAP III A Mistake — A Puzzle — And an Old Woman's Story ÖNE day after the departure of Sir Liwience, Mrs Mellish, being indisposed, remained the whole morning in her apaitment, the children were in the nursery, and Azelia who had lately been almost alwiys witlun observation of the family, was glad of in oppoitumty to indulge hei own lellections, she reined to the
the library and answered the lost letter of her friend Benwell, and having an hour to spaie before it was necessary to dicss for dinnei, ol which she usually partook with Mi and Mrs Me'lish she drew liom theshelf/iminermons Tssay on Solitude the melancholy fote oflus amiable daughter beguiled her of many tears , and while hei thoughts were wholly occupied by the author s pathetic description of suffering innocence, Mr Mellish entered unper¬ ceived , his morning salutation roused her, and closing the book hastily os she rose to address hun, he peiceived she had been in tears Mr Mellish smiled " «liss Hazely weeping, cried he, " by Heaven this is too much, cruel Sir Lawrence, to dim the lustre of those bright eyes by base desertion ' " Thinking him but m jest, Azelia laughed with him," and said, " indeed Mr Mellish you have an excellent talent for raillery, and I am often the object upon which you choose to exercise it, however.

respect Sir Lawrence much, but never felf for him a sentiment more tender " " Ah '" rejoined Mellish, " you hue felt it for another, I thought so, and I hope ev ery sigh is returned with inteiest ' " I fear not, ' said Azelia, " many < irriimstances intervene to make it un¬ likely; it is almost too great presumption for me to hope " The countenance of Mi Mellish glowed, he pressed her hand to hia lips, for vanity made him take her last words to himself Surprised at this action, Azelia was at a loss what to say, and, to complete her embairassment, Mrs Mellish, at that moment entered the room Mellish let the hand of Azelia drop, and, whistling the tune of « О thou wert born to please me," left the room *' What is the matter, A7cha î" asked Mis Mellish, "you look unusually giave ' Azelia innocently related all that had pissed, and her fuend turned pale, )ou must not mind these flights Azelia, Mr Melli h

Mrs Wolstenham was fortunately too much engrossed with her own thoughts, to notice the smile of contempt which stole over the features of Azelia, as she pei use d this effusion of ignorance, cunning, and falsehood, and she returned it without any к 2 comment.
comment Mrs Wolstonham resumed her story— " Soon after this, I was obliged to accompany my sick mother to the South of France , and iny correspondence with the sentimental Constantia ceased, on account of the expence I there mained Mi Wol- stenham,- and at my return, heard that Constantia was gone out to service Absence had, I own, rather weakened my fnendship, and as I was m anew spheie of connections, I thought it her duty to seek me Thus she lost materni improvement, howeier, she has not been unlucky, an old doctor to whom she was cook, much of an epicure, and not insensible to the chaims of hei person, took some pains to seduce her I believe he did not succeed , but whether 01 not, he at length made her his wife As he was very rich, ¡»he began to mix among people of distinction, but he restrained her as much as possible through motives of false shame His death at length released her, when she burst upon the
the world as an opulent widow, and whit is moresurpibing all her love ofhterature has evaporated , she is novv is domesticate d as a tabby cat Our acquaintance is ac¬ cordingly but slight, for where there ь not congennlity of sentiment, theie can be no permment fnendship ' Here Azelia was about to make some observations on the abuse of the word friendship, which sad experience had tiught her, but Mrs Wolstenham, whose first pleasure was to hear herself speak, gave her no opportunity, by continuing with the utmost volubility ' A mind so susceptible of tender impressions as that of Constantia s then was, could not be expected to lavish its tender¬ ness on an old man She was in fact, his mere nurse during the latter part of his life, and when releised fiom this wearisome occupation, enjoyed lierself like a woman of spn it, as he left his whole fortune to her without limit or control, though he had two children who might have expected t 3 some
some establishment—such is the effect of dotage The personal attractions and immense weilth ofthe young widow drew a number of suitors among whom was a young fellow of mem birth but engaging person Consimili hid before sicrificed all to weilth—she now resolved to sacrifice all to love b it like a true coquet determined to keep her admirer in doubt till she ascert medherentuesoveieignty Griddle followed her footsteps wherever she went her cirnage never drew up but he stood 1 ke her footman in readiness and time, it length made bim conqueror They are now ι loving couple with ι fine group of little masters mil misses Bein¿ raised to a fancied equality with me she wntes with the familiarity of an old friend and in consideration of her former affection I cannot decline the intercourse though our pursuits now are widely dissimilar She has ìequested me to send her a genteel soit of person as a domestic gov e ness and it is to her I would recommenc' you
Azelia not much liking the account of her, embellished as it had been by the rhetoric of partiality, begged permission to· consult her friend Mrs Mellish This being granted, she took the first oppoitu¬ mty of writing a note to that lidy, which remaining many dijs uninsiveied she took the resolution ofventuimg to the house, at a time when she knew Mr Mellish was usually at his office, in Doctor s Commons On enquiring m Guıldford- street, she found to her extreme regiet, that in consequence ofa misunderstanding between her fucini and Mr Mellish, the family had suddenly left town on the preceding day A/elia was returning much chagrined through 1 heobald s-Road, when she was arrested in her progress, by hei Vauxhall champion, who eagerly accosted hei " It is long since I had the pleasure of seeing you Madam, said he with much politeness in his manner, " Your looks indicate, that you have not enjoyed your б 4 health
lıc ılth well lattly , indeed you are much alteied since the night when------' He paused A/elia suipnsed at this address, said coolly— ' I shou'd imagine, Sir, the alteration you notiţe, is not so miterial now, as it was some months past, as ) on then seemed wholly incapable of recollecting my features " " Pardon me," said he earnestly, " I knew you too readily, but I saw you in improper company—I knew not whether it was by choice , and my feelings were then too acute tô permit my expressing in)selfwith any degree of consistency or self command " Azelia coloured ; she called to mind the encomiums of little Alwyn, at the time they fitst met, and now stole a glance at him, to discovei if they were just, butthe expressive regards of his fine dark eyes disconcerted her, and she hastened her steps to conceal hei emborrassment " Why
" Why will you, with such persevering cruelty, deny me the pleasure of a short conv ersition with you ?" said he, " Chance has been my friend ; it is an unexpected happiness, which would be encreased by vonr acquiescence Your name I presume, Madam, is stilili lzely '' Azelia thought he wis unacquainted with it, but finding he was not, bowed assent " And as yet no gentlemin has been happy enough to succeed m prevailing on you to change »t,- said he smiling " Perhıps no one his taken the trouble to attempt it," replied she, with equal gaiety " Knowing your heart to be engaged, it would indeed be an useless effort with many, and it is that apprehension which no doubt deters several of your admn ers " Azelia stirted m confusion at his being so well acquainted with ail lhat concerned her , and just then, being befoie the house of Mrs Wolstenham, she was saved the necessity of replying iS "Do
" Do you live here? ' asked her com¬ panion " At present I do,' said she , " but expectshoitl) toremove" ' May lask) oui futuie address ? ' " It is lmmatenal, Sii —I believe I shall go to В ith ' " Thank Heaven ' ' exclaimed he fer¬ vently, " then I may again meet with V ou " Veiy likely, ' replied A/elia hastily, - but piay go now , foi should I be seen discoursing with a stranger-------" " A stranger, Miss Hazely ' Ah, if you knew my thoughts, you would find I deserve not that appellation , but not for the world should yon be subjected to reproof on my account Tarewell ' " He hastily pressed her hand to his lips, and then hurried away, while Azelia stood fixed on the sleps w ith a degree of astonish¬ ment and emotion she had never before experienced, a sudden ideo ciossed her mind, tint it was to this mysterious stranger
stranger, she was indebted for the present anonymous letter, which had caused her so much perplexity ; and she formed as hasty a resolution of going to Bath at all events, that she might have an oppor¬ tunity of returning the money, and expressing her gratitude for his kind advice

Azelia was detained attending to a numbei of useless minuţia, till the stage in which her place was taken, had left the inn without her , itwas then six o'clock in the evening, of a Septeinbei's dry Mrs Griddle who was in the opposite extreme of punctuality, had strictly enjoined hei expected domestic to be with her on the dav fixed without fail , so that Azelia was induced, to listen to the advice of the book-keeper, at the coich office, who assured her, that by taking a post chaise, she would certainly overtake the stage at Slough Mrs Wolstenhim, who did not want generosity, seconded this counsel, and insisted on defraying her expences so far, and Azelia was then reluctantly obliged to submit, though her appre¬ hension was great, at the danger she might incur, m trivelling alone at night, even so short a distince, which they all assured her might bc easily performed by lolenble horses, in rather moie than three lourb, that it wis a road well fiequentecl by

Λ re¬ hearsal was called the next morning ; Miss Hazely's name was entered in the books, but at setting off she started a dif¬ ficulty, which occasioned some embarrass¬ ment and mirth at the theatre ; this was, her refusing to be saluted on the stage, by Sir John, she protested it was an indelicacy she could not submit to ; no man had yet taken that liberty, and it shocked her to think of it.

The manager leered it tlie red nosed man, who grinned aud shewed a vile set of straggling green teeth, which malignantly might have chimed for his own The young ladies titteied and jogged each other's elbows, as much as to say, ' she ■will be used to it soon ' The old lady now vented her spite, by observing, ' thatshe nevei thought much of raock modest misses,'and Melusnn, fearing hei young ■adventuress would be űisconceited by their remii ks, said, ' suiely, my dear Hazely, you cannot be so unnecessarily prudish, as to ob|ect agunst ι fnendly salute fiom my husband , besides, eonsidei, your refusal will deiange the whole perfoimance Azeln, whose good mture was equalled only by her delicacy, knew not how to reply, but, after a little hesitation said, ' that though her scruples weie natuial and imconcpieiable, she perceived they exposed hei to ridicule, but she inust, neveitheless, pcisist in declaring, that if the business of the stige ıendeı ed such ι 2 fanılıaı ıtıes

" Porlíraníft, OcíuííTfJ, 17 " MV DEAR FSrrlVD, " Your long silence gave mc much uneasiness; I addressed a letter to you at Mrs. Annesly*)·» which was re¬ turned by that person in an envelope, s 5 containing
contiming a few words by which I learnt that you had left her and that she waa ignonnt of your present abode though I did not exactly believe this and was besides extremely solicitous to learn your fate I wis hippy to hen you had quitted hei, ind though I icired that you might be e\~ posed to many inconveniences I thought any eťil more pieferable fo thesociety of a woman of ill fame but ah» * my deai A/-elii I feai you hav e not made in ex¬ change foi the better Mrs Lightfoot m y beiworthy woman but hei levity and in· consideratencss makes her in ill idviser foi one of your youth md plnnt disposition Ihc profession of a phyer is even to the most rigid in principles a life of peni and inevitable temptation do not mv ininble friend think I presume on your favour to obtrude my admonitions I know the intrinsic virtues you possess and perfectly agree wi h you m opinion that such appa- íently trivial liberties as vou with proper spirit resented arc too often the preludes 3 'o
to greater impropriety ,· it is from this public shewof libertinism that the characttM- of an actress is degraded, and it is cer¬ tainly a fault in authors to rest their dra¬ matic attractions on incidents which must wound ihe feelings of delicacy in the performance. A loose manner Of writing is attended with many dangers tD those beneath whose inspections such compo¬ sitions fall, and I am convinced that these habitual levities tend to pervert the mind and render it callous fo thaf fine sense of modesty which most women inherently possess ; few tiiere are, Who support them¬ selves with becoming dignity in that dan¬ gerous avocation ; but to those who do, great is their merit. May you, my friend, be one of those, since the stage is your' choice ; but if you find the purity of your manners likely to be impaired by an intercourse with those who are less scrupu¬ lous, fly the fascination of example in time, and fear not to sutTer any pecuniaryr и б inconvenience

Azelia was much gratified by this letter , the fnendship of Mrs Benwell was highly prized by her, but she hod no intention to partake of her bounty, as she well knew how numerous must be the calls of an encreasing family The universal applause she re¬ ceived, filled her with emulation, she heard of the great success of many actresses who had risen from obscurity and vainly hoped that fortune Would now repay her through the medium of htr own tilents, for the early deprivation of her rights She wis however puncd to observe that hei
htr friend Lightfoot vvas not altogether so happy as she expected her husbind wis careless and dissipated and too often ie duccd theu fimnces to the lowest ebb of indigence Azelia disti essed herself to issist them ind Lightfoot took the ορροί tunity of expiessmg his gntitude in a minner which she did not iltogethei ap prove The mamger too begin to be very issiduous in his attentions ind after a sue cessful season which he m a great measure owed to the e\ei tions of \zeln made her ι senous offer of his hand Astonished at a dechration so unexpected she never theless give a decisive negitive ind couched her rejection in terms not iltoge¬ ther pilitible to hei veteran lover who give her plainly to understind tint in losing his countenance she would nre parably injuie herself Azelia flew to her fnend to communi cate this intelligence and wis as much surprised is mortified to hear hei second the proposal of Mr Grumpus with zeal Azeln rejected her counsel with disdain Have
" Have you any otherattachment, Hazely, which induces you to refuse such an eligible offer ?" Azelia blushed, but did not reply, being too doubtful оГ Melusina's discretion to make her an entire confidant ; and Mrs. Lightfoot cast on her a suspicious glance, which, for the lirst rime, betrayed that she bad noticed the conduct of her hus¬ band. Azclia's embarrassment encreased her doubts, and she quitted her with cool¬ ness, though pecuniary obligations tied her tongue. Azelia was unspeakably dis¬ tressed, her situation began to bc irksome, yet she had no alternative ; giving way to the mortification of the moment, she leaned against a side scene and, bursting into tears, exclaimed— " Alas ! what fatality pursues me, that lean find no resting place on earth ?" " Can Miss Hazely want a place of re¬ pose, while my arms are open· to receive her," cried Lightfoot, clasping her round the waist. She screamed, and springing from his hold.

He had vanity, and longed to display his smart petit figure before an admiring audience ; to you vvho have been on the stage, I need not enumerate all the little piques and triumphs which successively occur m this contention for fame My cousin could sing, and was not backward m making the most

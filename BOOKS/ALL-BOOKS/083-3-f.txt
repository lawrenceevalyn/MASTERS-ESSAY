GLENARVON. CHAPTER I.
Love, though, when guilty, the parent of every crime, springs forth in the noblest hearts, and dwells ever with the gene¬ rous and the high-minded. The flame that is kindled by Heaven burns brightly and steadily to the last ; its ob¬ ject great and superior* sustained by principle, and incapable of change; but, when unsupported by these pure feel· ings, it rages and consumes us, burns up and destroys every noble hope, perverts the mind, and fills with craft and false¬ hood every avenue to the heart. Then that which was a paradise becomes a hell, and the victim of its power a maniac and a fiend. They know not the force of VOL. III. в
passion, who have notfett it—they know not the agony of guilt, who have not plunged into its burning gulf, and trem¬ bled there. О ! when the rigorous and the just turn with abhorrence from the fearful sight—when, like the pharisee, in the pride of their unpolluted hearts, they bless their God that they are not as this sinner, let them beware ; for the hour of trial may come to all; and that alone is the test of superior strength. When man, reposing upon himself, dis¬ dains the humility of acknowledging his offences and his weakness before his Creator, on the sudden that angry God sees fit to punish him in his wrath, and be who has appeared invulnerable till that hour, falls prostrate at once before tiie blow ; perhaps then, for the first time, he relents ; and, whilst he sinks himself, feels for the sinner whom, in the pride and presumption of bis happier day, he had mocked at and despised· There is no trial which human frailty
cannot resist—there is no passroft im¬ planted in the heart's core, which reason cannot subdue, if we call upon our God to assist us; but, when unsupported by his strength, every temptation that assails us may overcome us, and the remem¬ brance of our own weakness should teach us to be humble in ourselves. Fallen, miserable Calantha! where now are the promises of thy youth—the bright prospects of thy happiness ? Where is that unclouded brow—that joyous look of innocence which once bespoke a heart at ease ? Is it the same, who, with an air of fixed and sullen despondency, flying from a father's house, from a hus¬ band's protection, for one moment re¬ solved to seek the lover whom she ado¬ red, and follow bim, regardless of every other tie ? Y r et even in that hour of passion and of guilt, the remembrance of her husband, of her sacred promise to ber aunt, and of that gentle, supplicating look with which it was received, re- в 9
curred. A moment's reflection c jnged the rash resolve; and hastening forward, she knew not whither—she cared not to what fate, she found herself, after a long and weary walk, at the vicar's house, near Kelladon—a safe asylum and retreat. The boat which had conveyed her from the shore, returned ; and a few hours after brought Glenarvon to the other side of the rocks, known in the country by the name of the Wizard's Glen, and ofttimes the scene of tumult and rebellious meeting, Calantha little expected to see him. He met her to¬ wards evening, as weary and trembling she stood, uncertain whither to fly, or how to act. The moment of meeting was terrible to both ; but that which followed was more agonizing still· A servau t of her father's had discovered her after a long search. He informed her of her aunt s illness and terror; he humbly, but firmly, urged her instantly to return.
Calantha had resolved never to do so; but, lost as she was, the voice of her aunt still had power to reach her heart— " Is she very ill ? " Very dangerously ill," said the man ; and without a mo¬ ment's delay, she immediately consented to return. She resolved to part from him she adored ; and Glenarvon generously agreed to restore her to her aunt, whose sufTerings had affected his heart—whose prayers had moved him» as he said, to the greatest sacrifice he ever was called upon to make. Yet still he upbraided her for her flight, and affirmed, that had she but confided herself to him, she had long before this been far away from scenes so terrible to witness, and been spared a state of suspense so barbarous to endure. Whilst he spoke, he gazed upon her with much sadness. " I will leave you," he said; " but the time may come when yon will repent, and call in vain for me. They may tear my heart from out my breast—they may в 3
tear thee from me, if it is their mad desire. I shall, or die, or recover, or forget thee. But oh ! miserable victim ! what shall be¬ come of thee? Do they hope their mo¬ rality will uuteach the lessons 1 have given, or pluck my image from that heart ? Thou art mine ; wedded to me ; »old to me ; and no after-time can undo for thee what 1 have done. Go ; for I can relinquish thee. But have they taught thee what it is to part from him you love ? never again to hear his voice- never again to meet those eyes, whose every turn and glance you have learned to read and understand ?" Calantha could not answer. " You will write kindly and constantly to me," at length she said. " May God destroy me in his vengeance," cried Glenar¬ von, eagerly, " if, though absent, I do not daily, nay, hourly, think of thee, write to thee, live for thee ! Fear not, thou loved one ! There was a time when inconstancy hadbeen a venial error 0
—when insecure of thv affections, and vet innocent, to flv thee had been a duty ; to save thee had been an angeľs act of mercy and of virtue ; but now. when thou art mine, when, sacrificing the feelings of thy heart for others, thou dost leave me, can you believe that I would add to your grief, and increase my own ? Can you believe him you love so base as this ? Oh ! yes, Calantha, 1 iave acted the part of such a villain to ?our lost friend, that even you mistrust ne/* She reassured him. "Ihave gi¬ ven my very soul to you, Glenarvon ï 1 believe in you as I once did in Hea¬ ven. I had rather doubt myself and every thing than you," She now expressed an anxiety to re¬ turn and see her aunt, "Yet, Calantha, it may perhaps be said that you have fled to me. The stain then is indelible. Think ofit, my beloved; and think, if I* myself conduct you back, how the male¬ volent, who are ever taunting you, will в 4
say that I wished not lo retain you. They know me not ; they guess not what I feel ; and the world, ever apt to judge by circumstances imperfectly re¬ lated, will imagine"........"At sucha moment/' said Calantha, impatiently, "it isof little importance what is thought. When the heart suffers keenly, all the sayings of others are of little weight. Let them think the worst, and utter what thoy think. W r hen we fall, as I have done, we are far beyond their power ; the venomed shaft of malice cannot wound ; for the blow under which wè sink is alone heeded, I feel now but this—that I am going to part from you," Glenarvon looked at her, and the tears filled his eyes. " Thy love," he said, " was the last light of Heaven that beamed upon my weary pilgrimage; thy presence recalled me from error ; thy soft voice stilled every furious passion, it is all past now ; I care not what becomes of me." As he spoke, they approached
the boat, and entering it, sailed with a gentle breeze across the bay. Not a wave rippled—not a cloud obscured the brightness of the setting sun. " How- tranquil and lovely is the evening !" said Glenarvon, as the bark floated upon the smooth surface» " It is very calm now/* she replied, as she observed the serenity of his countenance. " But, ah ! who knows how soon the dreadful storms may arise, and hurry usto destruction/* The boat touched the shore, where a crowd of spectators were assembled— some watching from the top of the cliff, and others idly gazing upon the sea. The figure of Elinor distinctly appeared amongst the former, as bending forward, she easrerlv watched for Glenarvon. Her hat and plume distinguished her from the crowd ; and the harp, her constant companion, sounded at intervals on the breeae in long and melancholy cadences. Her dark wild eye ñxed itself upon him as he approached. "It is my false lover," в á
she said, and shrieked. " Hasten, dear¬ est Calantha/* he cried, "from this spot, where we are so much observed* That wretched girl may, perhaps, follow us. Hasten; for see with what rapidity she advances/' " Let her come," replied Calantha. " I am too miserable myself to turu from those who are unhappy/ 1 Elinor approached ; she guzed on them as they passed ; she strained her eyes to catch one last glimpse of Glenarvon as he turned the path. Many of his friends, retainers, and followers were near. He bowed to all with gracious courtesy ; but upon Elinor he never cast his eyes. " He's gone !' J she cried, shouting loudly, and address¬ ing herself to her lawless associates in the language they admired. " He is gone, and peace be with him; for he is the leader of the brave!" Calantha and Glenarvon now passed on in silence to the castle; but Elinor, returning to her harp, struck the chords with enthusiasm,
whilst the caverns of the mountains re¬ echoed to the strain. The crowd who had followed loudly applauded, joining in the chorus to the well-known sound of " Erin nťavourncen— Etin go ЪгаЬ."
CHAPTER II.
The moment of enthusiasm was past ; the setting sun warned every straggler and passenger to return. Some had a far distant home to seek ; others had left their wives or their children. Elinor turned from the golden light which illu¬ minated the west, and gazed in agony upon the gloomy battlements of St. Alvin Priory, yet resplendent with the last parting ray. Of all who followed her, few only now remained to watch her steps. She bade them meet her at the cavern at the accustomed hour; she was weary, and feigned that till then, she would sleep. This she did to disem¬ barrass herself of them. Upon raising herself after a little time, they were gone. It was dark—it was
lonely. She sat and mused upon the cliff, till the pale moon broke through the clouds, and tipped every wave with its soft and silvery light.—**The moon shines bright and fair/' she said: "the shadows pass over it. Will my lover come again to me? It is thy voice, Glen¬ arvon, which sings sweetly and mourn¬ fully iu the soft breeze of night· My heart's fit to break, yet no tear fills шу eye, As I gaze on the moon, and the clouds that flit by. The moon shînfs so fair, it reminds me к f ¿heej But the clouds that obscure it, are emblems of me. They will pass like the dream of our pleasures and youth ; They will pass like the promise of honor and truth ; And bright thou shalt shine, when these shadows are gone, All radiant—serene—unobscur'd; but alone. "And did he pass me so coldly by? And did he not once look on me?'* she said. "But I will not weep: he shall not break my spirit and heart, Let him
do so to the tame dov^s for whom he has forsaken me. Let sneh as Alice and Calantha die for his love I wdl not/*— She took hrr ha ρ: her voice was tired and feeble. She iiui»tiy murmured the feelitms of her troubled чои!. It sounded like the wind, as it v*h , «pered through the trees, or the moumiul echo of some far distant flute. SOXG. And can*st thou bid my heart forget, What once it lov'd so weU; That took—*that smile, when first we met; That last—that sad farewell ? Ah! no : by ev'r? pang I've prov'd, By every fond re¿»*ct, I feci, though 1 no more am lov'd, I never—can forget. 1 wish'd to see that face again, Although *twere chang'd to me : I thought it not such madd'ning paia As ne'er to look on thee»
Bat, oh! 'tw*s torture to my breast, To meet thine »lter'd eye, To see thee smile oti *U the rest, Yet coldly pass me by. Even now, when et'ry hope is o*er To which I........ *' Are these poetical effusions ended ?" said a soft voice from behind,—She start¬ ed ; and turning round, beheld the figure of a man envelloped in a dark military cloak, waiting for her upon the cliff.— " What a night it is ! not a wave on the calm sea : not a cloud in the Heavens. See how the mountain is tinged with the bright moonshine. Are you not chilľd— Are you not weary ; wandering thus alone ?" " 1 am prepared to follow you," said Elinor, "though not as a mistress, yet as a slave/* ** I do not love you/* said the man, approaching her. " Oh, even if you were to hang about and kneel to me as ouce, I cannot love you ! Yet it was pleasant to be so loved; was it
not?" " I think not of it now," said Elinor, while a proud blush burned on her cheek. "This is no time for retrospec¬ tion. '* "Let us hasten forwards, by the light of the moon: I perceive that we are late,—Have you forgiven rne?" " There are injuries, Glenarvon, too great to be forgiven : speak not of the past : let us journey on." The lashing of the waves against the rocks, alone disturbed the silence ofthe scene. They walked in haste by each others side, till they passed Craig Allen Point, and turned into the mouth of a deep cavern· Whispers were then heard from every side—the confusion of strange voices, the jargon of a foreign dialect, the yells and cries of the mutineers and discontented. "Strike a light/' said Elinor's companion, in a commanding tone, as he advanced to the mouth of the rock.—In a moment, a thousand torches blazed around, whilst shouts of joy proclaimed a welcome to the visitor,
who was accosted witb every mark of the most obsequious devotion. * ς How many have taken the oath to* night ?" said a stout, ill-looking man, ad¬ vancing to the front line. " Sure, Citizen Connor, fifty as brave boys aseversuck'd whiskey from the mother country,'* answered O'Kelly from within· The ferocious band of rebels were now or¬ dered forward, and stood before their leader; some much intoxicated, and all exhibiting strange marks of lawless and riotous insubordination* " We'll pay no tythes to the parsons," said one. " We'll go to mass, that we will, our own way/* " We'll be entirely free." " There shall be no laws amongst us/* " We'll re¬ form every thing, won't we ?" ** And turn all intruders out with the tyrants.'* *' Here's to the Emerald Isle ! Old Ire¬ land for ever! Erin forever!" " Come, my brave boys," shouted forth one Ci¬ tizen Cobb, " this night get yourselves pikes—make yourselves arms ; beg, buy»
or steal, and bring them here privately at the next meeting. We'll send your names into the directory. Fear nothing ; we vvill protect you ; we'll consider your grievances; only go home peaceably, some one way, and some another—by two's, by three's. Let us be orderly as the king's men are. We are free men ; and indeed free men can make as good soldiers/' " I would fain speak a few words, citizen, before we part to-night. The hour is not yet ripe ; but you have been all much wronged. My heart bleeds for your wrongs. Every tear that falls from an Irishman is like a drop of the heart's best blood ; is't not so, gentlemen ? Ye have been much aggrieved ; but there is one whom ye have for your leader, who feels for your misfortunes ; vvho will not live among you to see you wronged ; and who, though having nothing left for him¬ self, is wihing to divide his property amongst you all to the last shilling. See
there, indeed, he stands amongst us. Say, shall he speak to you ?" " Long life to him^—let him speak to us/' " Heaf him/' " Let there be silence as pro¬ found as death." " Sure and indeed we'll follow him to the grave." * 4 Och| he's a proper man!" A thousand voices having thus commanded silence : " Irishmen," said Glenarvon, throw¬ ing his dark mantle off, and standing amidst the grotesque and ferocious rab* ble, like some Being from a higher world —" Irishmen, our country shall soon be "free:—you are about to be avenged. " That vile government, which has so ff long, and so cruelly oppressed you, " shall soon be no more ! The national t( flag—the sacred green, shall fly over " the ruins of despotism ; and that fair * f capital, which has too long witnessed " the debauchery, the plots, the crimes '* of your tyrants, shall soon be the ci- t( tadel of triumphaut patriotism and vir- u tue. Even if we fail, let hs die de-
tr fending the rights of man—the inde* Ж€ pendence of Ireland· Let us remem- ** ber that as mortals we are liable to the t€ contingencies of failure ; but that an t( unalterable manliness of mind, under €t all circumstances, is erect and unsub* ** dued. If you are not superior to your ff antagonist in experience and skill, be €e so in intrepidity. Art, unsupported ** by skill, can perform no service. " Against their superior practice, array " your superior daring; for on the cow- et ard, who forgets his duty in the hour " of danger, instant punishment shall * r fall ; but the brave, who risk their €e lives for the general cause, shall receive ** immediate distinction and reward.—* " Arise then, united sons of Ireland—* ce arise like a great and powerful people, €t determined to live free or die." Shouts of applause for a moment in¬ terrupted Glenarvon. Then, as if in¬ spired vvith renewed enthusiasm, he pro¬ ceeded : " Citizens, or rather shall I not
ic say, my friends ; for such you have t( proved yourselves to me, my own and ft dear countrymen ; for though an exile, <c whom misfortune from infancy has pur- fi sued, I was born amongst you, and cf first opened my delighted eyes amidst ,f these rocks and mountains, where it is " my hope and ambition yet to dwelL " The hour of independence approaches. " Let us snap the fetters by which ty- tf rants have encompassed us around : let ff us arouse all the energies of our souls; " call forth all the merit and abilities, (r which a vicious government has Jong 4< consigned to obscurity ; and under the (< conduct of great and chosen leaders, * f march with a steady step to victory/* Here Glenarvon was again interrupted by the loud and repeated bursts of ap¬ plause. Elinor then springing forward, in a voice that pierced through the hearts of each, and was echoed back from cave to cave—'* Heard ye the words of your leader?" she cried: "and i,s there one amongst you base enough to desert
him ?" " None, none." " Then arm yourselves, my countrymen ; arm your¬ selves by every means in y oar power, and rush like lions on your foes. Let everv heart unite, as if struck at once by the same manly impulse ; and Ireland shall itself arise to defend its indepen¬ dence ; for in the cause of liberty, inac¬ tion is cowardice ; and may every coward forfeit the property he has not the cou¬ rage to protect ! Heed not the glare of hired soldiery, or aristocratic yeomanry ; they cannot stand the vigorous shock of freedom. Their trappings and their arms will soon be your's. Attack the tyranls in every direction, by day and by night. —To war—to war ! Vengeance on the detested government of England ! What faith shall you keep with them ? What faith have they ever kept with you ? Ireland can exist independent. О ! let not the chain of slavery encompass us around.— Health to the Emerald isle! Glenarvon and Ireland for ever !
CHAPTER III.
The cry of enthusiasm has ceased. Eli¬ nor and her companion have quitted the cavern. Before she parted for the night, she asked him respecting one he loved. " Where is Calantha?" she said, " In yon dreary prison," he replied, pointing to Castle Deiaval :—«* like a rose torn from the parent stem, left to perish in all its sweetness—gathered by the hand of the spoiler, and then abandoned. I have left ber." 4 * You look miserable, my Lord." " My countenance is truer to my feelings than 1 could have supposed/ 1 "Alice dead—Calantha discarded! I heard the tale, but it left no credit with me.—Can there be hearts so weak as thus to die for love? 'Tis but a month ago, I think, you said you never would
leave her ; that this was different from all other attachments; that you vvouid bear ber hence." " I have changed my in¬ tention: is that sufficient?" xt Will she die, think you ?" " Your uncle will, if you continue thus/* replied Glenarvon. *« I am sick at heart, Elinor, when 1 look on you." " Old men, my Lord, will seek the grave; and death can strike young hearts, when vain men think it their doing. I must leave you." " Where¬ fore in such haste ?" <e A younger and truer lover awaits my coming: I am his, to follow and obey him." " Oh, Elinor, I tremble at the sight of so much cold depravity--so young and so abandoned. How changed from the hour in which í first met you at Glenaa ! Can it be pos¬ sible ?" " Aye, my good Lord ; so apt a scholar, for so great a master." Glenarvon attempted to seize her hand. " Do you dare to detain me? Touch me not. I fear you.".... " Elinor, to what perdition are you hastening? I adjure
you by your former love, by Clare of Costoly, the boy for whom you affect such fondness, who still remains the favorite of my heart, return to your un¬ cle. I will myself conduct you." " Leave your hold, Glenarvon : force me not to shriek for succour.—Now that you have left me, I vvill sp*eak calmly. Are you prepared to hear me ?" " Speak/' ** Do you see those turrets which stand alone, as if defying future storms? Do you behold that bleak and barren mountain, my own native mountain, whicb gave me the high thoughts and feelings I pos¬ sess; whicb rears its head, hiding it only in the clouds ? Look above : see the pale moon, that moon which has often witnessed our mutual vows, which has shone upon our parting tears, and which still appears to light us on our guilty way: by these, by thyself, thy glorious self, I swear I never will return to virtue : vol. in. с
" For the heart that has once been cstrang'd, " With some newer affection may burn, u It may change, as it ever has change, ** But, oh ! it can never return." " By these eyes, which you have term¬ ed bright and dear ; by these dark shining locks, which your hands have oft en¬ twined; by these lips, which, prest by your's, have felt the rapturous fire and tenderness of love—virtue and I are for¬ sworn : and in me, whatever I may ap¬ pear, henceforward know that I am your eöemy. Yes, Glenarvon, I am another's now." " You can never love another as you have loved me: you will fiud no other like me." " He is as fair and dear, therefore detain me not. 1 would rather toil for bread, or beg from stran¬ gers, than ever more owe to you one sin¬ gle, one solitary favour. Farewell—How I have adored, you knovv : how 1 have been requited, think—when sorrows as acute as those you have inflicted vi r *
you, Alice, it is said, blest you with her dying breath. Calantha is of the same soft mould ; but there are deeds of horror, and hearts of fire :—the tygress has been known to devour her young; and lions, having tasted blood, have fed upon the bowels of their maştera." St, Clare, as she spoke, stood upon the edge of the high cliff to which they had ascended. The moon shone brightly on her light figure, which seemed to spring from the earth, as if impelled for¬ ward by the strength of passion, The belt of gold which surrounded her sien« der waist burst, as if unable longer to contain the proud swelling of her heart: she threw the mantle from her shoulders ; and raising the hat and plume from her head, waved it high in the air: then darting forward, she fled hastily from the grasp of Glenarvon, who watched her lessening form till it appeared like a single speck in the distance, scarce vi¬ sible to the eye. с 2
CHAPTER IV.
Before Glenarvon had met Elinor upon the cliff, he had conducted Lady Avon- dale to her father's bouse. The first per¬ son who came forward to meet them was Sir Richard. " My dear child/' he said, " what could have induced you to take in such a serious manner what was meant in jest? There is your aunt dying in one room ; and every one in fits or mad in different parts of the house. The whole thing will be known all over the country; and the worst of it is, when people talk, they never know what they say, and add, and adu\ till it makes a terrible story. But come in, do; for if the world speak ill of you, 1 will protect you: and as to my Lord Glenarvon
there, why it seems after all he is a very good sort of fellow; and had no mind to have you ; which is what I hinted at before you set out, and might have saved you a long walk, if you would only have listened to reason. But come in, do; for all the people are staring at you, as if they had never seen a woman before. Not but what I must say, such a comical one, so hot and hasty, I never happened to meet with ; which is my fault, and not your's. Therefore, come in ; for I hate people to do any thing that excites observation. There now ; did not I tell you so ? Here are all your relations perfectly crazy: and we shall have a scene in the great hall, if you don't make haste and get up stairs before they meet you." " Where is she ? where is she?" said Mrs. Seymour; and she wept at beholding her. But Ca¬ lantha could not weep : her heart seemed like ice within her: she could neither weep nor speak, " My child, my Ca- c 3
lantha," said Mrs. Seymour, " welcome back." Then turning to Glenarvon, whose tears flowed fast, *' receive m ν prayers, my thanks for this," she ex¬ claimed. " Heaven bless you for restoring my child to me." 44 Take her," said LóVd Glenarvon, placing Calantha in Mrs. Seymour's arms ; 4< and be assured, I give to you what is dearer to me, far dearer than existence. I do for your sake what I would not for any other: I give up that which I sought, and won, and would have died to retain—that which would have made life dear, and which, being taken from me, leaves me again to a dull blank, and dreary void. Oh I feel for what I have resisted ; and forgive the past." " I cannot utter my thanks," said Mrs. Seymour. " Generous Glen¬ arvon ! God reward you for it, and bless you." She gave him her hand. Glenarvon received the applauses of all; and he parted vvith an agitation so
violent, and apparently so unfeigned, that* even the duke, following, said, " We shall see you, perhaps, to-morrow: we shall ever, I am sure, see you with de¬ light." Calantha alone shared not in these transports; for her agony was be¬ yond endurance. Oh, that she too could have thought Glenarvon sincere and ge¬ nerous; that she too, in parting from him, could have said, a moment of pas¬ sion and my own errors have misled him !—but he has a noble nature. Had he taken her by the hand, and said—» Calantha, we both of us have erred ; but it is time to pause and repent : stay with a husband who adores you : live to atone for the crime you have eommitted : —she had done so. But he reproached her for her weakness; scorned her for the contrition he said she only affected to feel ; and exultingly enquired of her whether, in the presence of her husband, she should ever regret the lover she had lost. с 4
When we love, if that which we love is noble and superior, we contract a re¬ semblance to the object of our passion ; but if that to which we have bound our¬ selves is base, the contagion spreads swiftly, and the very soul becomes black with crime. Woe be to those who have ever loved Glenarvon ! Lady Avondale's heart was hardened ; her mind utterly perverted; and that face of beauty, that voice of softness, all, alas! that yet could influence her. She was, indeed, insensible to every other consideration. When, therefore, he spoke of leaving her —of restoring her to her husband, sbe heard him not vvith belief; but she stood suspended» as if waiting for the explana¬ tion such expressions needed.--It came at length. " Have I acted it to the life?" he whispered, ere he quitted her. " lt is but to keep them quiet. Calm yourself. 1 will see you again to-morrow/* That night Calantha slept not; but she watched for the approaching morrow.
It came :—Glenarvon came, as he had promised: he asked permission to see her one moment alone : he was not de¬ nied. He entered, and chided her for her tears; then pressing her hand, he inquired if she really thought that he would leave her: u What now—now that every secret of my soul is your's? Look at me, thou dear one : look again upon your master, and never acknow¬ ledge another." " God bless and protect you," she answered, ** Thanks, sweet, for your prayer. What fire burns in your eye ? What ecstasy is it thus to call you mine? Oh, tear from your mind every remaining scruple!—shrink not. The fatal plunge into guilt is taken: what matter how deep the fall. You weep, love; and for what? Once you were pure and spotless; and then, indeed, was the time for tears; but not now; oh, not now ! ** They talk to us of parting :—we will not part. Though contempt may brand с ό
my name, I will return and tear thee from them when the time is fit ; and you shall drink deep of the draught of joy» though death and ignominy may be mingled with it. Let them see you again—let the ties strengthen that I have broken. That which has strayed from the flock will become even dearer than before; and when most dear, most prized : a second time I will return, and a second time break through every tie, every resolve. Dost shudder, sweet one ? To whom are you united? Remember the oaths—the ring; and however es¬ tranged—whatever you may hear, re¬ member that you belong to me, to me alone. And even/' continued he, smiling with malicious triumph, 4t even though thegallant soldier, the once-loved Avon- dale return, can he find again the heart he has lost ? 'Tis but a shadow he can attempt to bind. The heart, the soul, are mine. О ! Calantha, you know not what you feel, nor half what you would
fee)) were I in reality to leave you. There's a fire burns in thee> fierce as in myself; you are bound to me now; I will return and claim you." As he spoke, he placed around her neck a chain of gold, with a locket of diamonds, containing his hair, saying as he fastened it—" Remember the ring ; this, too, is a marriage bond between us, friend of my best affections; never will I abandon or forget thee;—never, by Heaven ! shalt thou regret thy attach¬ ment or my own." " Glenarvon," said Calantha, and she was much agitated, " I have no will but your's; but I am not so lost as to wish, or to expect you to remain faithful to one, you must no longer see ; only, when you marry——" " May the wrath of Hea¬ ven blast me/' he interrupted, " if ever I call any woman mine but you, my adored, my sweetest friend. I will be faithful ; but you—you must return to Avondale: and shall he teach you to
forget me ? No, Calantha, never shall you forget the lessons I have given ; my triumph is secure. Think of me when I am away ; dream of me in the night, as that dear cheek slumbers upon its pillow. Our's has beeu but a short-tried friendship, but the pupils of Glenarvon never can forget their master. Better they had lived for years in folly and vice than one hour in the presence of such as I am. Do you repent, love ? It is im¬ possible. Look back to the time that is gone; count over the hours of solitude and social life ; bear in your memory every picture of fancied bliss, aud tell me truly if they can be compared to the transport, the ecstasy of being loved. " Oh ! there is Heaven in the language of adoration ; and one hour thus snatched from eternity is cheaply purchased by an age of woe. My love, my soul, look not thus. Now is the season of youth. While fresh and balmy as the rose of summer, dead to remorse, and burning
with hidden fires, dash all fear and all repentance from you ; leave repinings to the weak and the old, and taste the con¬ solation love alone can offer. What can» heal its injuries ? Wbat remove its re¬ grets ? What shew you its vanity and illusion but itself? This hour we enjoy its transports, and to-morrow, sweet, we must live upon its remembrance. " Farewell, beloved. Never let, or father or husband teach thee to forget me. Dis¬ semble well, however ; for they say the conquering hero returns — Avondale. Oh ! if thou shouldst—but it is impossi¬ ble—I feel that you dare not. We must appear to give way : we have been too unguarded : we have betrayed ourselves: but, my life, my love is yours. Be true to me. You need not have one doubt of me: I never, never will forsake you. Heed not what I say to others ; 1 do it but to keep all tranquil, and to quiet suspicion. Trust all to one who has ne¬ ver deceived thee. I might have as-
sumed a character to you more worthy, more captivating. But have you not read the black secrets of my heart—aye, read, and shuddered, aud yet forgiven me ?"
CHAPTER V.
The repetition of a lover's promises is perhaps as irksome to those who may coldly peruse them, аэ the remembrance is delightful to those who have known the happiness of receiving them. It may*' indeed be held immoral to exhibit, in glowing language, scenes which ought never to have been at all ; but when every day, and every hour of the day—- at all times, and in all places, and in all countries alike, man is gaining possession of his victim by similar arts, to paint the portrait to the life, to display his base intentions, and their mournful con¬ sequences, is to hold out a warning and admonition to innocence and virtue ; this cannot be wrong. All deceive them¬ selves. At this very instant of time, what
thousands of beguiled and credulous be¬ ings are saying to themselves in the pride of their hearts, " I am not like Ca¬ lantha/' or, " thanks be to Heaven, the idol of my fancy is not a Glenarvon/* They deem themselves virtuous, because they are yet only upon the verge of ruin ; they thiiik themselves secure, because they know not yet the heart of him vvho would mislead them. But the hour of trial is at hand ; and the smile of scorn may soon give place to the bitter tear of repentance* " Many can deceive/' said Glenarvon, mournfully gazing on Calantha whilst she wept ; u but is your lover like the com¬ mon herd ? Oh ! we have loved, my gen¬ tle mistress, better than they know how : we have dared the utmost : your mind and mine must not even be compared with their's. Let the vulgar dissemble and fear—let them talk idly in the un¬ meaning jargon they admire: they never felt what we have fell ; they never dared
what we have done : to win, and to be¬ tray, is with them an air—a fancy : and fit is the delight for the beings who can enjoy it. Such as these, a smile or a frown may gain or lose in a moment. But tell me, Calantha, have we felt nothing more ? I who could command you, am your slave : every tear you shed is an¬ swered not by my eyes alone, but in my heart of hearts ; and is there that on earth I would not, will not sacrifice for you ? " I know they will wound you, and frown on you because of me; but if once I shew myself again, the rabble must shrink at lust ; they dare not stand before Glenarvon. Heaven, or hell, I care not which, have cast a ray so bright around my brow, that not all the perfidy of a heart as lost as mine, of a heart loaded» as von knovv too well, with crimes man shudders even to imagine—not all the envy and malice of those whom my contempt has stung, can lower me to their level. And you, Calantha, do you tbink
you will ever ìearn to hate me, even were I to leave, and to betray you ? Poor blighted flower, which I have cherished in my bosom, when scorned and trampled on, because you have followed him whom all had gladly sought, if I had sobut willed it ! Were I to subject you to the racking trial of frantic jealousy, and should you ever be driven by fury and vengeance to betray me, you would but harm yourself. To thv last wretched hour, thou wouldst pine in unavailing recollection and re¬ gret; as Cly tie, though bound and fettered to the earth, still fixes her uplifted eyes upon her own sun, who passes over, re¬ gardless in his course, nor deigns to cast a look below." It was at a late hour that night, when after again receiving the thanks of a whole family—when after hearing himself called the preserver of the wretch who scarcely dared to encounter his eyes, Lord Glenarvon took a last and faltering leave of Calantha. Twice he returned
and paused: he knew not how to say farewell: it seemed as if his lips trem¬ bled beneath the meaning of that fearful word—as if he durst not utter a knell to so much love—a deatb to every long- cherished hope. At length, in a slow and solemn voice, " Farewell, Calantha," he said. " God forgive us both, and bless you." Lady Avondale for one instant ventured to look upon him : it was but to impress upon her memory every fea¬ ture, every lineament, and trace of that ¡mage, which had reigned so powerfully over her heart. Had thousands been present, she had seen but that one :— had every danger menaced him, he had not moved. Thus in the agony of re¬ gret they parted; but that regret was shared ; and as he glanced his eye for the last time on her,, he pointed to the chain which he wore with her resem¬ blance near his heart; and he bade her take comfort in the thought that absence could never tear that image from him.
CHAPTER VI.
And now the glowing picture of guilt is at an end, the sword of justice hangs over the head of a devoted criminal ; and the tor¬ tures of remorse are alone left me to de~ scribe. But no : remorse came not yet; absence but drew Calantha nearer to the object of her attachment. They never love so well vvho have never been estranged. Who is there that in absence clings not with increasing fondness to the object of its idolatry, watches not every post, and trembling with alarm, anxiety, and sus¬ pense, reads not again and again every line that the hand oflove has traced ? Is there a fault that is not pardoned in absence ? Is there a doubt that is not harboured and believed, however agonizing ? Yet, though believed, is it uot at once tor-
given ? Every feeling but one is extinct in absence; every idea but one image is banished as profane. Lady Avondale had sacrificed herself and Glenarvon, as she then thought, tor others ; but she could not bring herself to endure the pang she had voluntarily inflicted. She lived therefore but upon the let» ters she daily received from him ; for those letters vvere filled with lamenta¬ tions for her loss, and with tbe hope of "Ï speedy return, She felt no horror at her conduct. She deceived herself: conscience itself had ceased to reprove a heart so absorbed, so lost in the laby¬ rinth of guilt. Lord Avondale wrote to her but seldom : she heard however with uneasiness that his present situation was one that exposed him to much danger ; and after a skirmish with the rebels, when she was informed that he was «afe, she knelt down and said, " Thank God for it !" as if he had stiil been dear. His letters, however, were repulsive and
cold. Glenarvon's, on the other hand, breathed the life and soul of love. Iu one of these letters, Glenarvon in¬ formed her, that he was going to Eng¬ land, to meet at Mortanville Priory se¬ veral of his friends. Lady Mandeville, Lady Augusta Selwyn, and Lady Tre¬ lawney, were to be of the party, " I care not," he said, " who may be there; this I know too well, that my Calantha will not," He spoke of lady Mowbrey and Lady Elizabeth with praise. " Oh ! if your Avondale be like his sister, whom I have met with since we parted, what indeed have you not sacrificed for me ?" He confided to her, that Lady Mande¬ ville had entreated him to visit her in London : " But what delight can I find in her society ?" he said; " it will only remind me ofone I have lost." His letter, after his arrival in England, ended thus: " I will bear this separation as long as I cap, my Calantha; but my. health is consumed by my regret; and,
whatever you may do, I live alone—en¬ tirely alone. We may be alone in the midst of crowds ; and if indifference, nay, almost dislike toothers, is a proof of at¬ tachment to you, you vvill be secure and satisfied. I had a stormy passage from Ireland. Is it ominous of future trouble ? Vain is this separation. " I will bear with it for a short period: but in the spring, when the soft winds prepare to waft us, fly to me ; and wà vvill traverse the dark blue seas, secure, through a thousand storms, in each others devotion. Were you ever at sea ? How does the roar of the mighty winds, and the rushing of waters, accord with you—the whistling of the breeze, the sparkling of the waves by night, and the rippling of the foam against the sides of that single plank which divides you from eternity? Fear you, Calantha? Oh, not if your lover were by your side, your head reclining on his bosom, your heart freed from every other tie, and linked
alone by the dearest and the tenderest to his fate! Can vou fancy vourself there, a bout the middle watch ? How many knots does she make ? How often have they heaved the log? Does she sail with the speed of thought, when that thought is dictated by love? Perhaps it is a calm. Heed it not : towards morn it will freshen: a breeze will spring up; and by to-morrow even, we shall be at anchor. Wilt thou sail? 'They that go dow ? n into the great deep; they see the wonders of the Lord/ That thou may'st see as few as possible of his ter¬ rific wonders, is, my beloved, the prayer of him who liveth alone for thee ! "The prettiest and most perilous na¬ vigation for large ships is the Archi¬ pelago. There we will go; and there thou shalt see the brightest of moons, shining over the headlands of green Asia, or the Isles, upon the bluest of all waves — the most beautiful, but the most trea¬ cherous. Ob, Calantha! what ecstasy
were it to sail together, or to travel in those pleasant lands I have often de* scribed to you—freed from the gloom and the forebodings this heavy noisome at¬ mosphere engengers!— Deareet! I write folly and nonsense:—do I not? But even this, is it not a proof of love?'' After bis arrival at Mortanville Priory, Glenarvon wrote to Calantha a minute account of every one there. He seemed to detail to her his inmost thoughts. He thus expressed himself concerning Miss Monmouth :—" Do you remember how often we have talked together of Miss Monmouth ? You will hear, perhaps, that I have seen much of her of late. Remember she is thy relative ; but oh ! how unlike my own, my beloved Ca¬ lantha! Yet she pleases me well enough. They will» perhaps, tell you that I have shewn ber some little attention. Pos* sibly this is true ; but, Heaven be my wit¬ ness, I never for one moment even have thought seriously about her/' Ьъау VOL. III. D
Trelawney, in writing to her sister, thought rather differently. It was thus that she expressed herself upon that sub¬ ject. " However strange you may think it,*' she said in her letter to Sophia, *' Lord Glenarvon has made a proposal of marriage to Miss Monmouth. I do not believe what you tell me of his con¬ tinuing to write to Calantha. If he does, it is only by way of keeping her quiet ; for I assure you he is most serious in his intentions. Miss Monmouth admires, indeed I think loves him; yet she has not accepted his offer. Want of know¬ ledge of his character, and some fear of bis principles, have made her for the present decline it. But their newly made friendship is to continue; and anyone may see how it will end. In the mean time, Lord Glenarvon has already con¬ soled himself for her refusal—but I will explain ail this when we meet. " Remember and say nothing of this to Calantha, unless she hears of it from
others ; and advise her not to write so often. It is most absurd, believe me· Nothing, I think, can be more wanting in dignity than a woman's continuing to persecute a man who is evidently tired of her. He ever avoids all conversation on this topic; but with me, in private, I have heard a great deal, which makes me think extremely well of him. Yoa know how violent Calantha is in all things:—it seems in the present in¬ stance, that her love is of so mad and absurd a nature, that it is all he can do to prevent her coming after him. Such things, too, as she has told him ! A wo¬ man must.bave a depraved mind, even to name such subjects, " Now, I know you will disbelieve all this ; but at once to silence you, I have seen some passages of her letters ; and more forward and guilty professions none ever assuredly ventured to make. Her gifts too !—he is quite loaded with them ; and while, as he laughingly observed, Ώ 2
one little remembrance from a friend is dear, to be almost bought thus is un¬ becoming, both in him to receive, and herself to offer· As to Lord Glenarvon, I like him more than ever. He has, in¬ deed, the errors of youth; but his mind is superior, and his heart full of sensi¬ bility and feeling/'
CHAPTER VH.
Ip Glenarvon's letters had given joy to Calantha, in more prosperous and happier days, when surrounded by friends, what muet they have appeared to her now, when bereft of all ? They were as the light of Heaven to one immersed in darkness ; they were as health to the wretch who has pined in sickness : they were as riches to the poor, and joy to the suffering heart. What then must have been her feelings when they sud¬ denly and entirely ceased ! At first, she thought the wind was contrary, and the mails irregular. Of one thing she felt secure—Glenarvon could not mean to deceive her. His last letter, too, was kinder than any other; and the words with which he concluded it, were such as to d 3
inspire her with confidence. " If, by any chance, however improbable," he said, l( my letters fail to reach you» impute the <Jeby to any cause whatever: but do me enough justice not for one moment to doubt of me. I will comply with every request of your's ; and from y©4è I require m teima nothing but re« memhrance—the remembrance of one who hm forgotton himself, the world« fame, hope, ambition—all here, and aU hereafter, but you." Every one perhaps has felt the tor¬ tures of suspense : every one knows it» iengthened pangs : it is unnecessary hete to paint them. Weeks now passed» matead of days, and still not one line, one word from Glenarvon. Τ lieti it was that Lady Avondale thus addressed him: " It is io vain, my dearest friend, that I attempt to deceive mvself. It is now two weeks since J have watched, with incessant anxiety, for one of those dear,
those kind letters, which had power to still the voice of conscience, and to make one, even as unworthy as I am, compa¬ ratively blest» You accused me of cold¬ ness; vet I have written since, I fear, with onlv too much warmth. Alas! 1 have forgotten all the modesty and dig¬ nity dtie to m ν sex and situation, to im- piore for one line, one Huie Ime, which might inform me you were vvell, and not offended. Lord Avondale's return, I told you, had been delayed. His ab¬ sence, his indifference, are now my only comfort in life. Were it otherwise, how could I support the unmeasured geilt I have heaped upon my soul? The friends of my youth are estranged by my re¬ peated errors and long neglect. I am as lonely, as miserable in your absence as you can wish. *· Glenarvon, I do not reproach you: I never wdl. But vour sudden, vour unexpected silence, has pxen me more aguish ıhan i c;m express, i will not η 4
doubt you : 1 will follow your last in¬ junctions} and beheve every thing sooner than that vou wil! thus abandon me. If thai time is indeed arrived—-and 1 know how frail a possession guilty love must ever be—how much it is weakened by security«.how much it is cooled bv ah* sence : do not sive yourself the pain of deceiving me : there ís no use in deceit. Say with kindness that another has gamed vour affections; but let them Lever incime you to treat me with cru¬ elty, Oh, fear not, Glenarvon, that I shall intrude, or reproach you. 1 shall bear everv affliction, if vou but soften the pang to me by one soothing word. ** Now, possibly, when you receive this, vou will iaush at me for mv fears ; vou will sav 1 but echo back those w Inch vou indulged. But so sudden is rhe s.lence. so long the period of tort u rmg suspense, that 1 must tremble ttll 1 re¬ ceive one Ime from vour dearest hand— one line io sav that vou are not oflended *■ ·
with me. Remember that you are all on earth to mei and if I lose that for which I have paid so terrible a price, what then will be in ν fate! " 1 dread that vou should have in- volved Yourself seriouslv. Alas! I dread for you a thousand things I dare not say. My friend, we have been very wicked. It is myself alone 1 blame. On me, on me be the crime ; but if my life could save you, how gladly would I give it up! Oh, caunot we yet repent! Act well, Glenarvon: be not in love with crime: indeed, indeed, I tremble for you. It is not inconstancy that I fear. Whatever your errors may be, whatever fate be mine, my beart cannot be severed from you. I shall, as yo« have often said, never cease to love; bur, were I to see your ruin, ah, believe me, it would grieve me more than my own. I am nothing, a mere cypher : you might be all that is great and supe¬ rior. Act rigbtiv, then, m ν friend ; and
hear this counsel, though it comes from one as fallen as I am. Think not that I wish to repine, or that I lament the past. A r ou have rendered me bappy : it is not you that I accuse. But, now that you are gone, I look with horror upon my situation ; and my crimes by night and by day appear unvarnished be¬ fore me. ** I am frightened, Glenarvon : we have dared too much. I have followed you into a dark abyss ; and now that you, my guide, my protector, have left my side* my former weakness returns, and all, that one smile of your's could make me forget, oppresses and confounds me. The eye of Heaven has marked me, and ϊ sink at once. You vvill abandon me: that thought comprises all things in it. Therein lies the punishment of my crime; The portrait which you have left vvith me has a stern look. Some hav e said that the likeness of a friend is preferable to him¬ self, for that it ever smiles upon us ; but
with me it is the reverse, I never saw Glenarvon's eyes gaze coldly on me till now. Farewell. " Ever with respect and \ove\ ** Your grateful, but unhappy friend, ** Calantha»" Lady Avondale was more calm when she had thus written. The next morning a letter was placed in her hand. Her heart beat high. It was from Mortan¬ ville Priorv :—but it was from Ladv Tre- lavvnev, in answer to one she had sent her, and not from Glenarvon, " Dearest cousin," said Lady Trelaw¬ ney, " I have not had time to write to you one word before. Of all the places I ever was at, this is the most perfectly de¬ lightful. Had I a spice in me of ro¬ mance, I would attempt to describe it ; but, in truth, I cannot. Tell Sophia w* expect her for certain next week ; and, ifyou wish to be diverted from all black
thoughts, join our party. I received your gloomy letter after dinner ! I was sitting ou a couch by---------, shall I tell you by whom ?—by Lord Glenarvon himself. At the moment in which it was deli¬ vered, for the post comes in here at nine in the evening, he smiled a little as he recognized the hand ; and, when 1 told him vou were ill, that smile became an incredulous laugh ; for he knows well enough people are never so ill as they say. Witness himself: he is wonderfully recovered : indeed, he is grown perfectly delightful. 1 thought htm uncommonly stupid all this summer, which I attribute now to vou ; for vou encouraged him in his whims and woes· Here, at least, he is all life and çoôd humour. Ladv Au- gusta says he is not tbe same man ; but sentiment, she affirms, undermines anv constitution ; and vou are rather too much in that style. ♦* After all, my dear cousin, it is silly to make yourself unhappy about any
man. 1 dare say you thought Lord Glen¬ arvon verv amiable: so tlo i :— and vou fancied he was in love with you, as they call it: and 1 could fancy tue same: and there is one here, 1 am sure, may fancy it as well as any of us : but it is so absurd to take these things seriously. It is his manner ; and he owns himself that a grandt puss ίο n bores him to death; and that if you will but leave him alone, he finds a little absence has entirely restored his senses. 44 By the bye, did you give him.·.· but that is a secret. Only L much suspect that he has made over all that vou have given hira to another. Do the same by him, therefore ; and have enough pride to shew him that vou are not so weak and so much in his power as he imagines. I shall be quite provoked ifyou write any more to him. He shews all vour letters : I tell you this as a friend : only, now, pray do not get me into a scrape, or re¬ peat it.
" Do tell me when Lord Avondale returns. They say there has been a real rising in the north : but Trelawney thinks people make a great deal of nothing at ad: he says, for his part, he believes it is all talk and nonsense. We are going to London, where I hope you will meet ns. Good bye to you, dear coz. Write merrily, and as you used. My motto, you know, is, laugh whilst you can, and be grave when you must. I have written a long letter to my mother and Sophia; but do not ask to see it. In¬ deed, I would tell you all, if! were not afraid you'd be so foolish as to vex your¬ self about what cannot be helped." And Lady Avondale did vex herself; and this letter from Frances made her mad. The punishment of crime was then at hand :—Glenarvon had betraved, had abandoned her. Yet was it possible, or was it not the malice of Frances who wished to vex her? Calantha could not believe him false. He had not been to
her as a common lover :—he was true : she felt assured he was: yet her agitation was very great. Perhaps he had been misled, and he feared to tell her* Could she* be offended,, because he had been weak ? Oh, no ! he knew she could not : he would never betray her secrets; he would never abandon her, because a newer favourite employed his momen¬ tary thoughts. She felt secure he would not, and she was calm. She walked to Belfont. She met vvith many of her former friends ; but they received her coidiy. Lady St. Clare drew up her head, and dropi her an austere courtesy. Several ladies of equally unblemished reputation, were the first to shrink from a " fallen sinner." She returned to the castle ; but every eye that met her*s appeared to view her with new marks of disapproba¬ tion. Guilt, when bereft of support, is ever leprobated; but see it decked in splendour and success, and where are
they who shrink from its approach ? Calantha's name was the theme of just censure, but in Glenarvon's presence, who had discovered that she was thus worthless and degraded? And did they think she did not see their meanness. The pioud heart is the first to sink before contempt—it feels the wound more keen¬ ly than any other can. O, there is nothing in language that can express the deep humiliation of being received with coldness, when kindness is expected—*of seeing the look, but half concealed, of strong disapprobation from such as wc have cause to feel beneath us, not alone in vigour of mind and spi¬ rit, but even in virtue and truth. The weak, the base, the hypocrite, are the first to turn with indignation from their fellow mortals in disgrace ; and, whilst the really chaste and pure suspect with caution, and censure with mildness, these traffickers iu petty sins, who plume themselves upon their immaculate con-
duct, sound the alarum bell at the ap¬ proach of guilt, and clamour their ana¬ themas upon their unwary and cowering prey. For once they fell with justice ; and in this instance their conduct was re¬ ceived without resentment. There was a darker shade on the brow, an assumed distance of manner, a certain studied civility, which seemed lo sav, that, by favour, Lady Avondale was excused much ; that the laws of society would still admit her; that her youth, her rank and high connexions, were considerations which averted from her that stigmatising brand, her inexcusable hehaviour other¬ wise had drawn down : but still the mark was set upon her, and she felt its bitterness the more, because she knew how much it had been deserved. Yet of what avail were the reproving looks of friends, the bitter taunts of com¬ panions, whom long habit had rendered familiar, the ill-timed menaces and rough
reproaches of some, and the innuendoes and scornful jests of others? They only tended to harden a mind rendered fierce by strong passion, and strengthen the natural violence of a character which had set all opposition at defiance, and staked every thing upon one throw—which had been unused to refuse itself the smallest gratification, and knew not how to en* dure the first trial to which it ever had been exposed. Kindness had been the only remaiuing hope ; and kindness, such as the human heart can scarce believe in, was shewn in vain. Yet the words which are so spoken seldom fail to sootb. Even when on. the verge of ruin, tbe devoted wretch will turn and listen to the accents which pity and be¬ nevolence vouchsafe to utter; and though* thev mav come too late, her last looks and words may bless the hand that was thus stretched out to save her. It was with such looks of grateful affection that Lady Avondale turned to
Mrs. Seymour, wben she marked the haughty frowns of Lady Margaret, and (she cold repulsi ve glance with w h ich m any others received her. Yet still she lived upon the morrow; and, with an an¬ guish that destroyed her, watched, vainly watched, for every returning post. Daily she walked to that accustomed spot—* that dear» that well-known spot, where often and often she bad seen and heard Ihe man who then would have given his very existence to please her ; and the re¬ membrance of his love, of bis promises, in some measure re-assured her. One evening, as she wandered there, she met St. Clara, who passed her m haste, whilst a smile of exulting triumph lighted her eotrøtenance. Lady Avon- dale sighed, and seated herself upon the fragment of a rock ; but took no other notice of her. There was a blaze of glork>u$ light diffused over the calm scene, and the gloomy battlements of Belfont Priory
yet shone with the departing ray· When Calantha arose to depart, she turned from the golden light which illuminated the west, and gazed in agony upon the spot where it was her custom to meet her lover, Tbe vessels passed to and fro upon the dark blue sea; the sailors cheerfully followed their nightly work; and the peasants, returning from the mountains with their flocks, sung cheerfully as they approached their homes. Calantha had np home to return to: no approving eye to bid ber welcome : her heart was desolate. Sbe met with an aged man, whose white locks flowed, and whose air was that of deep distress. He looked upon her· He asked charity of her as he passed : he said that he was friendless, and alone in the world. His name she asked: he replied, " Camioli." " lf gold can give you peace, take this," she said. He blessed her: he called her all goodness—all loveliness ; and he prayed
for her to his Creator. " Oh, Father of mercy," said Calantha, * c hear the prayer of the petitioner : grant me the blessing he has asked for me. I never more can pray, He little knows the pang he gave, He calis me good : alas ! that name and Calantha's are parted for ever. Poor wretch! who hast nothing to hope for in life, But the mercy of hearts long success has m^de hard. No parent hast thou, no fond children, no wife, Thine age from distress and misfortune to şuard. Yet the trifle l gare, little worth thy possessing, Has calľd forth in thee, what I cannot repay : Thou hast asVd of thy God 'for his favour and blessing ; Thou hast prayed for the sinner, who петег must pray. Old man, if those locks, -wh ich are silver'd by time. Have ne'er been dishonored by guilt or excess ; If when tempted to wrong, thou hast iled from the crime ; By passion unmoT'd, unappalľd by distress :
If through life thou haat follow'd tlic course that b fair, And much hast pcrform'd, though of little possess'd; Thea the God of thy fathers shall favour the prayer, Aad а blessing be sent to а heart oow unblest
CHAPTER VIII.
Lady Avondale wrote again and again to Glenarvon. All that a woman wouid repress, all that she once feared to utter, she now ventured to write. " Glenarvon," she said, " if I have dis¬ pleased you, let me at least be told my fault by you : you who have had power to lead me to wrong, need not doublt your influence if you would now but advise me to return to my duty. Say it but gently—speak but kindly to me, and I will obev everv wish of your's. But mf v V perhaps that dreaded moment is arrived, and you are no longer constant and true. Ah ! fear not one reproach from me. I told you how it must end ; and I will never think the worse of you for being as all men are. But do not atfd cruelty
to inconstancy. Let me hear from your own lips that you are changed. 1 but repeat your words, when once my letters failed to reach you—suspense, you then said, was torture: and will you now expose me to those sufferings which you even knew not how to endure ? Let no one persuade you to treat her witk cruelty, vvho, whatever your conduct may be, will never cease to honour and to love you. " Forgive, if too presumptuous, I have written with flippant gaiety, or thought¬ less folly. Say I have been to blame ; but do not you, Glenarvon, do not you be my accuser. You are surrounded by those who possess beauty and talents, far, far above any which I can boast; but all I had it in my power to give, I offered you; and, however little worth, no one can bear to have that all rejected with contempt and ingratitude. And are they endeavouring to blacken me in your opinion ? and do they call this acting
honourably and fairly ? Lady Trelawney perhaps—ah ! no, I will not believe it. Besides, had they the inclination, have they the power to engage you to re¬ nounce me thus ? " Glenarvon, my misery is at the utmost. Ifyou could but know what I suffer at this moment, you would pity me. О leave me not thus: I cannot bear it. Expose me not to every eye : drive me not to desperation. This suspense is agonizing: this sudden, this protracted silence is too hard to bear. Every one does, every one must, despise me : the good opinion of the wise and just, I have lost for ever ; but do not you abandon me, or if you must, oh let it be from your own mouth at least that ï read my doom. Say that you love another—say it, if indeed it is already so; and I will learn to bear it. Write it but kindly. Tell me I shall stiil be vour friend. I will not upbraid you : no grief of mind shall make me forget your former kind- VOL. III. К
ness. Oh no, ï will never leàrn to hate or reproach you, however you may think ït to trample upon me. I will bless your name with my last breath^—call upon you even from the grave, where you have sent me—only turn one look, one last dear look to me/ Such was her letter. At another time she thus again addressed him: " Glenarvon, my only hopein !ife,drive me not at once to desperation, Alas! why do 1 write thus г You are ill perhaps: or my friends surroundingyou, have urged you to this. In such case, remember my situation. Say but kindly that my letters are no longer a solace to you, and I will òf myself cease to write; but do nor hurl me at once from adoration to con- item pt and hate. Do not throw me off, and doom me to sudden, to certain per¬ dition. Glenarvon, have mercy. Let compassion, if love hás ceased, impel you to show me some humanity. I know it is degrading thus to #rite. I ought to
be silent, and to feel that ifyou have the heart to treat me with harshness, it is lowering myself still further thus to sue. But oh I my God, it is no longer time to think of dignity—-to speak of what is ri^ht. I have fallen to the lowest depth. You, you are the first to teach me how low, how miserably I am fallen. I forsook every thing for you. I would have fol¬ lowed you; and you know it. But for your's and other's sake, I would have sacrificed all—all to you. Alas! I have alreadv done so. " If you should likewise turn against me—-if you, for whom so much is lost, should be the first to despise me, how can I bear up under it. Dread the vio¬ lence of my feelings—the agonizing pang, the despair of a heart so lost, and so be¬ trayed. Oh, write but one line to me. Say that another has engaged you to for¬ sake me—that you will love me no more ; but that as a friend you vvill still feel some affection, some interest for me. ν о
I am ill, Glenarvon. God knows I do not aftect it, to touch you. Such guilt as mine, and so much bitter misery !— how can 1 bear up under it ? Oh pity the dread, the suspense I endure. You know not what a woman feels when re¬ morse, despair, and the sudden loss of him she loves, assail her at once. " I have seen, I have heard of crueltv. and falsehood: but you, Glenarvon—oh you vvho are so young, so beautiful, can you be inhuman ? It breaks my heart to think so. Why have you not the looks, as well as the heart of a villain ? Oh why take such pains, such care, to lull me into security, to dispel every natural fear and suspicion, a heart that loves must harbour, only to plunge me deeper in agony—to destroy me with more re¬ fined and barbarous cruelty ? Jest not with my sufferings. God knows they are acute and real. I feel even for my¬ íèlf when I consider what I am going to endure. Oh spare one victim at least.
Generously save me : I ask you not to love me. Only break to me yourself this sudden change--tell me my fate, from that dear mouth which has so often sworn never, never to abandon me,"

CHAPTER IX.
Days again passed in fruitless expecta¬ tion ; nights, in unceasing wakefulness and grief. At length one morning, a let¬ ter was put into Lady Avondale's hands. It was from Glenarvon. It is impossible to describe the joy, the transport of that moment; nor how, pressing it to her lips, she returned thanks to Heaven for receiv¬ ing, what it was a crime against her Crea¬ tor thus to value. She glanced bereye over the superscription ; but she durst not open it. She dreaded lest some cause should be assigned for so long a silence, which might appear less kind than what she could easily endure. The seal was not his seal ; and the black wax, so constantly his custom to use, was ex¬ changed for red. The motto upon the
seal (for lovers attend to all) was not that which at all times he made use of when addressing Calantha. It was a seal she knew too well. A strange foreboding that he was changed, filled her mind. She was prepared for the worst, as she apprehended. At last she broke the seal; but she was not prepared for the following words written by his own hand, and thus addressed to her. Oh ! had he the heart to write them ? Mortanville Friory, Notembcr the ötK Lady Avondale, I am no longer your lover ; and since you oblige me to confess it, by this truly unfeminine persecution,—learn, that I am attached to another ; whose name it would of course be dishonourable to mention. Ishall ever remember vvith gratitude the many instances I have received of the predilection you have shewn in my fa¬ vour. I shall ever continue your friend, if your ladyship will permit me so to E 4
style myself; and, as a first proof of my regard, 1 offer you this advice, correct your vanity, which is ridiculous; exert your absurd caprices upon others ; and leave me in peace. Your most obedient servant, Glenarvon, This letter was sealed and directed by Lady Mandeville; but the hand that wrote it was Lord Glenarvoi/s ; and therefore it had its full effect. Yes; it went as it was intended, to the very heart; and the wound thus given, was as deep as the most cruel enemy could have desired. The grief of a mother for the loss of her child has been described, though the hand of the painter fails ever in expressing the agonies of that mo¬ ment. The sorrows of a mistress when losing the lover she adores, have been the theme of еуету age. Poetry and paint¬ ing, have exhausted the expression of her despair, and painted to the life, that
which themselves could conceive—could feel and understand. Every one can sympathise with t heir s uffer i ngs; and that which others commiserate, is felt with less agony by ourselves. But who can sympathize with guilt, or who lament the just reward of crime? There is a pang, beyond all others—- a grief, which happily for human nature few have been called upon to encounter. It is when an erring but not hardened heart, worked up to excess of pas¬ sion, idolized and flattered into security, madly betraying every sacred trust, re¬ ceives all unlooked for, from the hand it adores, the dreadful punishment which its crime deserves. And, if there can be a degree still greater of agony, shew to the wretch who sinks beneath the unexpected blow—shew ber, in the per¬ son of her only remaining friend and protector, the husband she has betrayed-— the lover of her youth î Oh shew him unsuspicious, faithful, kind; and do not e 5
judge her, if at such moment, the dream dispelled, frantic violence impelling her to acts of desperation and madness, lead her rash hand to attempt her miserable life. Where but in death can such out¬ cast seek refuge from shame, remorse, and all the bitterness of despair? Where but in death ?---------it is no coward's act. The strength of momentary passion may nerve the arm for so rash a deed ; but faint hearts will sicken at the thought. Calantha durst not—no, she durst not strike the blow. She seized the sharp edged knife, and tried its force. It was not pain she feared. Pain, even to extremity, she already felt. But one single blow—one instant, and all to be at an end. A trembling horror seized upon her limbs : the life-blood chilled around her heart. She feared to die. Pain, even to agony, were better than thus to brave Omnipotence—to rush forward un¬ called into that state of which no certain
end is known : to snatch destiny into our own povver, and draw upon ourselves, in one instant of time, terrors and punish¬ ments above the boundless apprehension even of an evil imagination to conceive. Calantha's eye, convulsed and fixed, perceived not the objects which sur¬ rounded her. Her thoughts, quick as the delirious dream of fever, varu d with new and dreadful pictures of calamity. It was the last struggle of nature.—The spirit within her trembled at approaching dissolution.-—The shock was too great for mortal reason to resist. Glenarvon— Glenarvon ! that form—that look alone appeared to awaken her recollection, but all else was confusion and pain. lt was a scene of horror. Mav it for ever be blotted from the remembrance of the human heart ! It claims no sympa¬ thy: itwas the dreadful exhibition of a maid which passion bad misled, and reason had ceased to guide, Calantha bowed not before that Bemg who had e в
seen fit to punish her in his wrath. She sought nor vengeance, nor future hope. AH was lost for her; and with Glenarvon, every desire in life, every aspiring energy vanished. Overpowered, annihilated, she called for mercy and release. Siie felt that mortal passion domineered over reason ; and, after one desperate struggle for mastery, had conquered and destroyed her. Her father watched over and spoke to her. Mrs. Seymour endeavoured to awaken her to some sense of her situa¬ tion :—she spoke to her of her hus¬ band, Calantha 1 when reason had ceased to guide thee, she called to sooth, to warn thee, but thou couldst not hear. That voice of conscience, that voice of truth, which in life's happier day thou had'st rejected, now spoke m vain ; and thy rash steps hurried on to seek the ter¬ mination of thv mad career.
CHAPTER Χ.
When the very soul is as it were anni¬ hilated by some sudden and unexpected evil, the outward frame is calm—no ap¬ pearance of emotion, of tears, of repining, gives notice of the approaching calamity. Calantha, motionless, re-perused Glenar¬ von's letter, and spoke with gentleness to those who addressed her. Oh ! did the aunt that loved her, as she read that barbarous letter, exhibit equal marks of fortitude? No: in tears, in reproaches, she vented her indignation: but still Calantha moved not. There is a disease which it is terrible tonnine. Ah, see vou uot itssvmpîoır^ in the wild eye of your child. Dread, dread the violence of her uncurbed pas-
sions, of an imagination disordered and overpowered. Madness to frenzy has fallen upon her. YV" hat tumult, wiiat horror, reign in that mind: how piercing were the shrieks she uttered : how hol¬ low the cry that echoed Glenarvon's name! Lady Margaret held her to her bosom, and folded her arms around her. No stern looks upbraided her for her crimes: all was kindness unutterable—- goodness that stabbed to the heart. And did she turn from such indul¬ gence—did her perverted passions still conquer every better feeling, as even on a bed of death her last hope was love—her last words Glenarvon ! Sophia approached Calantha with words of kindness and religion : but the words of religion offered no balm to a mind estranged and utterly perverted. Her cheeks were pale, and her hollow eyes, glazed and fixed, turned from the voice of coibfort. Miss Seymour placed her children near her; but with tears cf
remorse she heard thera speak, and shrunk from their caresses. And still it was upon Glenarvon that she called. Yet when certain death was expected, or far worse, entire loss of reason, she by slow degrees recovered. There is a recovery from disease which is worse than death ; and it was ber des¬ tiny to prove it. She loved her own sorrow too well: she cherished every sad remembrance : she became morose, absorbed, and irritated to frenzy, if in¬ truded upon. All virtue is blighted in such a bosom-—all principle gone. It feeds upon its own calamity. Hope no¬ thing from the miserable: "a broken * f heart is a sepulchre in which tbe ruin " of every thing that is noble and fair is tc enshrined." That which causes the tragic end of a woman's life, is often but a moment of amusement and folly in the history ofa man. Women, like toys, are sought after and trifled with, and then thrown
by with every varying caprice. Another, and another still succeed ; but to each thus cast away, the pang has been be¬ yond thought, the stain indelible, and the wound mortal. Glenarvon had offer¬ ed his heart to another. He had given the love-gifts—the chains and the'rings which he had received from Calantha, to his new favourite. Her letters he had shewn ; her secrets he had betrayed : to an enemy's bosom he had betrayed the strusrdes of a ^uihv heart, tortured with remorse, and yet at that time at least but too true, and faithful to him. They vvere the letters written iu con¬ fidence which he shewed ! They were the secret thoughts of a soul he had torn from virtue and duty to follow him, which he betrayed ! And to whom did he thus expose her errors ?—to the near relations of her hus¬ band, to the friends,and companionsof her youth; and instead of thro wing a veil upon the weakness he himself had caused, when
doubt, remorse, and terror had driven her to acts of desperation ; instead ot' dropping one tear of pity over a bleeding, breaking heart, he committed those tes¬ timonies of her guilt, and his own trea¬ chery, into tîıe hands of incensed aud injured friends. They were human : they saw but what he would have them see; they knew but wliat he wished them to know : they censured her al- ready, and rather believed hîs plausible and gentle words, than the frantic rhap¬ sodies of guilt and passion. They read tbe passages but half communicated ; they heard tbe insidious remai ks; they saw the letters in whicb themselves were misrepresented and unkindly named ; nor knew the arts whieh bad been made use of to alienate Calantha. They espoused the cause oí Glenarvon, and turned with anger and contempt against one whom they now justly despised. Kven Sophia, whom the terror of despair bad one mo¬ ment softened — eveu Sophia had uot
long been in the society of Glenarvon after her arrival in England, when she also changed ; so powerful were the ar¬ guments which he used to persuade her; or so easily tranquillized is resentment when we ourselves are not sufferers from the injury,
CHAPTER XI.
On quitting Castle Delaval, Lord Glen¬ arvon went as he had promised, to Mr. Monmouth'ss eat in Wales, by name Mortanville Priory. There, in a large »and brilliant society, he soon forgot Calantha. Lady Augusta rallied him for his caprice ; Lady Mandeville sought to obtain his confidence. Tears and re¬ proaches are ever irksome ; and the confidence that had once been placed in a former mistress, now suddenly with* drawn, was wholly given to her. A petitioner is at all times intrusive ; and sorrow at a distance but serves to encrease the coldness and inconstancy it upbraids. The contrast is great between smiling and triumphant beauty, and remorse, misery, and disgrace. And, if
every reason here enumerated were insufficient to account for a lover 1 * inconstancy, it is enough in one word to say, that Lady Avondale was a sent; for Lord Glenarvon was of a disposition to attend so wholly to those in whose presence he took delight, that he failed to remember those to whom he had once been attached ; so that like the wheels of a watch, the chain of his affections might be said to unwind from the absent, in proportion as they twined themselves around the favourite ofthe moment ; and being extreme in all things, he could not sufficiently devote himself to the one, without taking from the other all that he had given. It were vain to detail the petty in¬ stances of barbarity he employed. The web was fme enough, and wove vvith a skilful hand. He even consulted with Lady Mandeville in what manner to make his inhuman triumph more poig¬ nant—more galling; aud wheu he heard
that Calantha was irritated even unto madness, and grieved almost unto death, he only mocked at her folly, and despised her still remaining attachment to himself. " Indeed she is ill," said Sophia, in an¬ swer to his insulting enquiry, soon after her arrival at Mortanville Priorv. "She is even dangerously ill/' " And pray may I ask of what malady ?" he replied, with a smile of scorn. " Ofone, Lord Glenarvon," she answered with equal irony, " which will never endanger your health—of a broken heart." He laugh- ed. " Of deep remorse/* she continued. " And no regret ?" said he, iookiug archly at her. " Do not jest," she re¬ torted : " the misery which an unhal¬ lowed attachment must in itself inflict, is sufficient, I should think, without adding derision to every other feeling/' " Does Miss Seymour speak from expe¬ rience or conjecture ?" Before Miss Seymour could answer, Lady Mandeville, who was present,
whispered something to Glenarvon ; and he laughed. Sophia asked eagerly what sbe was saying. " It is a secret," said Glenarvon, significantly. " How happy must Lady Mandeville be at this mo¬ ment!" said Lady Augusta, " for every one knows that the greatest enjoyment the human mind can feel, is when we are in the act of betraying a secret con¬ fided to us by a friend, or informing an enemy of something upon which the life and safety of another depends." "Come," said Lady Mandeville, " you are very severe; but I was only urging Lord Glenarvon to listen to Miss Seymour's admonitions in a less public circle. Miss Monmouth may be displeased if she hears of all this whispering/' So saying, she took Gienarvon's arm, and they walked out of the room together. " After all, he is a glorious creature," said Lady Trelawney, ** I wish I had a .glorious creature to walk with me this morning," «aid Lady Augusta with a
sneer : " but how can I hope for support, when Calantha, who had once thousands to defend her, and whom I left the gayest where all were gay, is now dying alone, upbraided, despised,and deserted. Where are her friends?" " She fell by her own fault entirely/' said Lord Tre¬ lawney. " Her life has been one course of absurdity. A crime here and there is nothing, I well know," said Lady Augusta ; " but imprudence and folly, »who can pardon?'* " She has a kind heart," said Frances. " Kind enough to some," said her lord ; " but talk not of her, for I feel indignant at her very name." " There is nothing excites our indignation so strongly/' said Lady Augusta, " as misfortune. Whilst our friends are healthy, rich, happy, and, above all, vvell dressed and gaily attend¬ ed, they are delightful, adorable. After all, your sensible judicious people on the long run are the best : they keep a good eye to their Own interest; and
these flighty ones are sure to get into scrapes. W r hen they do, we flatterers have an awkward part to play : we must either turn short about, as is the case now, or stand up in a bad cause, for which none of us have heart or spirit/' " There is no excuse for Ca¬ lantha," said Miss Seymour. " God forbid I should look for one," said Lady Augusta. " I am like a deer, and ever fly vvith the herd : there is no excuse, Miss Seymour, ever, for those who are wounded and bleeding and trodden upon. I could tell you—but here come these glorious creatures ! Are you aware, that when Lady Avondale sent a few days since for her lover's portrait, and a lock of his hair, one of these glorious creatures, Lady Mandeville, yesterday in an envelope enclosed a braid of her own. C'est piquant cela; fadmire ľ* ţc How illnatured the worid is !" said Miss Monmouth, who had heard the a ter part of this discoursa
" Not illnatured or wicked, my dear," said Lady Augusta; " only weak, cow¬ ardly, and inordinately stupid." " With what self-satisfaction every one tri¬ umphs at the fall of those whose ta¬ lents or situation raise them a little into observation!" said Miss Monmouth. " Common sense is so pleased," said Lady Augusta, " when it sees of how little use any other sense is in this life, that one must forgive its triumph ; and itsold saws and wholesome truisms come out with such an increase of length and weight, when lhe enemy to its peace has tumbled*"'down before it, that it w T ere vain to attempt a defence of the culprit condemned, I know the world too well to break through any of the lesser rules and customs imposed, but you, my dear, know nothing yet ; therefore I cannot talk to you/' Miss Monmouth was the only child of the Honourable Mr. Monmouth, a near relation of Lady Mowbrey's. Her youth, VOI» III. F
her innocence, a certain charm of man¬ ner and of person, rare and pleasing, had already apparently made some impres¬ sion upon Glenarvon. He had secretly paid her every most marked attention. He had even made her repeatedly the most honourable offers. At first, trem¬ bling and suspicious, she repulsed the man of whom rumour had spoken much, which hei 'rm principles and noble ge¬ nerous heart disapproved ; but soon at¬ tracted and subdued by the same all splendid talents, she heard him with more favourable inclinations. She was, herself, rich in the possession of every virtue and grace : but, alas ! too soon she was over-reached by the same fasci¬ nation and disguise which had imposed upon every other. Amongst the many suitors who at this time appeared to claim Miss Monmouth's hand, Buchanan was the most distin¬ guished. Lady Margaret eagerly desired this marriage. She put every engine to
work in a moment to defeat Glenarvon's views, and secure the prize for her son. She even left Ireland upon hearing of his increasing influence, and joined for a few weeks the party at Mortanville Pri¬ ory. The parents of Miss Monmouth were as eager for Buchanan, as the young lady herself w r as averse. Glenarvon saw with bitterness the success his rival had obtained,and hated the friends and parents of Miss Monmouth for their mistrust of him. By day, by night, he assailed an innocent heart, not with gross flattery, not vvith vain professions. He had a mask for every distinct character he wish- ed to play ; and in each character he acted to the very life. In this instance he threw himself upon the generous mercy of one vvho already was but <лЮ well inclined to favour him. He candidly acknowledged his errors ; but he cast a veil over their magnitude ; and confessed only what he wished should be known. Miss Monmouth, he said, ν 'i'
should reform him ; her gentle voice should recall his heart from perversion ; her virtues should win upon a mind, which, the errors of youth, the world and opportunity had misled. Miss Monmouth was the idol of her family. She was pure herself, and there¬ fore unsuspicious. Talents and judg¬ ment had been given her with no sparing hand ; but to these, she added the warm¬ est, the most generous heart, the strong¬ est feelings, and a high and noble cha¬ racter. To save, to reclaim one, whose genius she admired, whose beauty at¬ tracted, was a task too delightful to be rejected. Thousauus daily sacrifice their hearts to mercenary and ambitious views; thousands coldly, without one feeling of enthusiasm or love, sell themselves for a splendid name ; and can there be a mind so cold, so corrupted, as to censure the girl, vvho, having rejected a Buchanan, pave her hand and heart, and all that she possessed, to save, to bless, and to re- -¿|ачш a Glenarvon,
CHAPTER XII.
Happily for Miss Monmouth, at the very moment her consent was given, Lady Margaret placed a letter in Glen¬ arvon's hands, which threw him into the deepest agitation, and obliged him г instantly, and for a short time, to hasten to England. He went thither iu company with Lady Margaret ; and strange as it may appear, the love, the idolatry, he had professed for so many, seemed now with greater vehemence than for others transferred to herself. Whether from ar¬ tifice or caprice, İt is unnecessary to say, but Lady Margaret at least made shew of a return. She never lost sight of him for one moment. She read with him; she talked with him; she chided him f 3
with all the wit and grace of which «be was mistress; and he, as if maddening in her presence, gazed on her with wild delight ; and seemed inclined to abandon every thing for her sake. Lady Margaret applied to her nume¬ rous friends for the ship which had long been promised to Lord Glenarvon, as a reward for his former services. She wrote to Sir George Buchanan in favour of his appointment; she spoke with eloquence of his misfortunes; and whether from her representations, or some other cause, his titles and estates were at length re¬ stored to him. Thanking her for the zeal she had shewn, he proposed to return with her immediately to Italy. She now hesitated. Her brother had written to her: tbese were the words of his letter: " Buchanan is desirous that his marriage should be celebrated in this place. Miss Monmouth, I fear, has beeu compelled to accept his hand ; and
I should pity her, if such force did not save her from a far worse fate. í mean a marriage with Glenarvon/' Glenarvon was by Lady Margareťs side when this letter was receive d. He held one of Lady Margaret's white hands in his : he was looking upon the rings she wore, and laughingly asking lier if they were the gifts of Dartford. " Look at me, my beautiful mistress," he said, with the triumph of one secure. She, carelessly placed the letter before his eyes, ** Cor¬ rect your vanity/* she said, whilst he was perusing it, alluding to the words he had written to Calantha; " exert your caprices upon others more willing to bear them ; and leave me in peace/* Stung to the soul, Glenarvon started; and gazed on her with malignant rage: then grinding bis teeth with all the hor¬ ror of supprest rage, " I am not a fly to be trodden upon, but a viper that shall sting thee to the heart. Farewell for ever/' he cried, rushing from her. Then
returning one moment with calmness, "and smiling on her, " you have not grieved me," he said gently: " I am not angry, my fair mistress. We shall meet again: fear not we shall meet again." " Now I am lost/* said Lady Margaret, when he was gone. " I know by that smile that my fate is sealed.'* There is nothing so uncongenial to the sorrowing heart as gaiety and mirth ; yet Calantha was at this time condemned to witness it. No sickness, no sufferings of its owners, prevented extraordinary festivities at the castle. Upon the even¬ ing of the celebration of Buchanan's mar¬ riage, there vvere revels and merry-making as in happier times; and the peasantry and tenants, forgetful of their cabals and wrongs, all appeared to partake in the general festivity. The ribband of green was concealed beneath large bouquets of flowers; and healths and toasts went round with tumults of applause, regard¬ less of the secret sorrows either of those
who pledged them, or of their superiors. The lawn was covered vvith dancers. It was a cheerful scene ; and even Calantha smiled, as she leant upon her father's arm, and gazed upon the joyful coun¬ tenances which surrounded he*\ but it was the smile of one whose heart was breaking; and every tenant as he passed by and greeted her looked upon the fa¬ ther and the child, and sighed at the change which had taken place in the ap¬ pearance of both* Suddenly, amidst the danceşs, with a light foot, as if springing front.the earth, there appeared, lovely in beauty and in youth, the fairest flower of Belfont. Tt was Miss St. Clare. No longer envel¬ loped in her dark 4 flowing mantle, she danced amidst the village maidens, the gayest there. She danced vvith all the skill of art, and all the grace of nature. Her dress was simple and light as the web of the gossamer : her ringlets, shining in the bright sun-beams, sported with tbe
wind : red was her cheek as the first blush of love, or the rose of summer, when it opens to the sun. Upon the lake the boats, adorned with many coloured ribbands, sailed with the breeze. Bands of music played beneath the tents which were erected for refresh¬ ments. The evening was bright and cloudless. Elinor was the first and latest in the dance—the life and spirit of the joyous scene. Some shrunk back it is true at first, when they beheld her; but when they saw her smile, and that look of winning candour, which even innocence at times forgets to wear, that playful, youthful manner, re-assured them. " Can it be possible !" said Calantha, when the music ceased, and the villagers dispersed^—" can you indeed affect this gaiety, or do you feel it, St. Clare?" " I feel it/' cried the girl, laughing archly. " The shafts of love shall never pierce me ; and sorrows, though they fall thicker than the rain of Heaven, shall
never break my heart." " Oh ! teach me to endure afflictions thus. Is it re* ligion that supports you ?" " Religion I м St. Clare sighed # " Yon bright heaven/' she said, up¬ lifting her eyes, " is not for me. The time has been, when, like you, I could have wept, and bowed beneath the chastening rod of adversity; but it is past. Turn you, and repent, lady; for you are but young in sin, and the heart alone has wandered. Turn to that God of mercy, and he will yet receive and reclaim you." A tear started into her eyes, as she spoke. " I must journey on ; for the time allowed me is short. Death walks among us even now. Look at yon lordly mansion—your father's house. Is it well defended from within? Are there bold hearts ready to stand forth in the time of need ? Where is the heir of Délavai :—look to him:—even now they tear him from you. The fiends, the fiends are abroad :—·look to your
husband, lady —the gallant Eari of Avon- dale: red is the uniform he wears; black is the charger upon which he rides; but the blood of his heart shall flow. It is a bloody war we are going to: this is the year of horror!!! Better it were never to have been born, than to have lived in an age like this." " Unhappy maniaci'* said a voice frora behind. It was the voice of the Bard Camioli: " unhappy St. Clare!" hesaid. She turned ; but he was gone. Every one now surrounded Miss St. Clare, re¬ questing her to sing. " Oh, I cannot sing," she replied, with tears, appealing to Calantha; then added lower—" my soul is in torture. That was a father's voice, risen from the grave to chide me." Calantha took her hand with tender¬ ness ; but Miss St. Clare shrunk from her. " Fly me," she said, " for that which thou thinkest sweet has lost its savour. " Oh listen not to the voice of the charmer, charm slie never so sweetly/' Yet ere
we part, my young and dear protectress, take with you my heart's warm thanks and blessings ; for thou hast been kind to the friendless—thou hast been merciful to the heart that was injured, and in pain. I vvouid not wish to harm thee. May the journey of thy life be in the sun¬ shine and smiles of fortune. May soft breezes waft tby gilded bark upon a smooth sea, to a guileless, peaceful shore! May thy footsteps tread upon the green grass, and the violet and the rose spring up under thy feet!" Calantha's paie cheeks and failing tears were her onïy answer to this prayer.
CHAPTER XIII. Cam ioli had been some time concealed in Ireland. He now entered his brother Sir Everard's door. Upon that night he was seized with illness, before he had time to explain his intentions. He had placed a bag of gold in tbe hands of his brother; and now, in the paroxysm ofhis fever, he called upon his daughter; he urged those who attended on him to send for her, that he might once again behold her. " I am come to die in the land of my fathers," he said. " I have wandered on these shores to find ifall I heard were true. Alas! it is true; and I wish once more to see my unhappy child—before I die." They wrote to Elinor : they told her of her father's words. They said : " Oh, Elinor, return ; ungrateful child—haste
thee to return. Thy father is taken dangerously ill. I think some of the wretches around us have administered poison to him. I know not where to find thee. He has called thrice for thee ; and now he raves. Ob hasten ; for in the frantic agony of his soul, he has cursed thee ; and if thou dost not obey the summons, with the last breath of de¬ parting life, he will bequeath thee his ma¬ lediction. O, Elinor, once the pride and joy of thy fathers heart, whom myself dedicated as a spotless offering before the throne of Heaven, as being too fair» too good for such a lowly one as mé¬ retűm ere it be too late, and kneel by the bed of thy dying father. This is thy house. It is a parent calls, however un¬ worthy ; still it is one who loves thee ; and should pride incline thee not to hear him, О how thou wilt regret it when too late-—Ever, my child, thy affectionate» but most unhappy uncle, Everard St. Clare/*
She received not the summons—she vvas far distant when the letter was sent ror her to the mountains. She received it not tdl noon; and the bard's last hour was at hand. Miss Lauriana St. Clare then addressed her---" If any feeling of mercy yet warms your stubborn heart, come home to us and see your father, ere he breathe his last, 'Tis a fearful sight to see him: he raves for you, and calls you his darling and his favourite—his lost lamb, who has strayed írom the flock, but wert dearer than all tbe rest. Miss Elinor, I have little hopes of stirring your compassion; for in the days of babyhood you were ever hard and unyielding, taking your own way , and disdaining the counsel of such as were older and wiser than you. Go to, child; you have played the wanton vvith your fortune, and the hour of shame is come." Miss St. Clare beard not the summon« —upon her horse she rode swiftly over
st the moors—it came too late—Camioli had sickened in the morning, and ere night, he had died. They wrote agaiu : " Your father's spirit has forsaken him : there is no recall from the grave. With his last words he be¬ queathed his curse to the favourite of his heart; and death has set its seal upon the legacy. The malediction of a father rest upon an ungrateful child !" Elinor stood upon the cliff near Craig Allen Bay, when her father's corpse was carried to the srrave. She heard the knelt and the melancholv dir^e : she saw the procession as it passed : she stopped its progress, and was told that her tather in his last hour had left her his malediction. Manv were near her, and flattered her at the time ; but she heard them not. Elinor stood on the barren chrf, to feel, as she said, the morning dew and tresh mountain air on her parched forehead. " My brain beats as if to madden me :— the fires of hell consume me:—it is a
father's curse," she cried ; and her voice, in one loud and dreadful shriek, rent the air. tr Oh it is a father's curse!" then pausing with a fixed and hurried eye : " Bear it, winds of heaven, and dews of earth," she cried : " bear it to false Glenarvon .-—hear it, fallen angel, in the dull night, when the hollow wind shakes your battlements and your towers, anj shrieks as it passes by, till it affrights your slumbers :—-hear it in the morn, when the sun breaks through the clouds, and gilds with its beams of gold the eastern heavens :—hear it when the warbling skylark, soaring to the skies, thrills with its pipe, and every note of joy sound in thy ear as the cry of woe. The old man is dead, and gone : he wili he laid low in the sepulchre : his bones shall be whiter than his grey hairs. He left his malediction upon his child. May it rest with thee, false Glenarvon ! Angel of beauty, light, and delight ofthe sou!, thou paradise of joys unutterable
from which my heart is banished, thou God whom 1 have worshipped with sacrilegious incense, hear it and tremble. Amidst revels and feastings, in the hour of Jove, when passion beats in every pulse, when flatterers kneel, and tell thee thou art great, when a servile world bowing before thee weaves the laurel wreath of glory around thy brows, when old men for¬ get their age and dignity to worship thee, and kings and princes tremble before the scourge of thy wit—think on the cry of the afflicted—the last piercing cry of agonizing and desperate despair. Hear it, as it shrieks in the voice of the tem¬ pest, or bellows from the vast fathomless ocean ; and when they tell thee thou art great, when they tell thee thou art good, remember thy falsehood, thy treachery. Oh remember it and shudder, and say to thyself thou art worthless, and laugh at the flatterers that would deny it/'
CHAPTER XIV.
Nothing is more mistaken than to sup¬ pose that unkindness and severity are the means of reclaiming an offender. There is no moment in which we are more in¬ sensible to our own errors ihun when we smart under apparent injustice. Calan¬ tha saw Glenarvon triumphant, and her¬ self deserted The world, it is true^ still befriended her; but her nearest relations and fnends supported him. Taunted with her errors, betrayed, scorned, and trampled upon, the ЫцЬ spirit of her character arose in pr<-portion as every hope was cut off. She became violen:, overbearing, untraceable even to lier at¬ tendants, demanding a more than ordi¬ nary degree of respect, from the suspicion that it might no longer be paid. Kvery
«rror of her life was now canvassed, and brought forth against her. Follies and absurdities long forgotten, were produced to view, to aggravate her present dis¬ grace; and the severity which an offend¬ ed world forbore to shew, Sophia, Fran¬ ces, the Princess of Madagascar, Lady Mandeville, and Lord Glenarvon, were eager to evince. But, even at this hour, Calantha had reason to acknowledge the kindness and generosity of some ; and the poor remem¬ bered her in their prayers. Those whom she had once protected, flu w forward to support her; and even strangers addressed her with looks if not words, of consola¬ tion, lt was not the gay, the professing, the vain, that shewed compassion in a moment of need—it was not the impru¬ dent and vicious whom Calantha had stood firm by and defended : these were the first to desert her. But it was the good, the pious, tbe benevolent, who came to her, and even courted an ac-
quaintance they once had shunned; for their hope was now to reclaim. Humbled, not yet sufficiently, but miserable, her fair name blasted, the jest of fools, the theme of triumphant malice, Calantha still gave vent to every furious passion, and openly rebelled against those who had abandoned her. She refused to see any one, to hear any admonitions, and, sickening at every contradiction to her authority, insisted upon doing things the most illjudged and unreason¬ able, to shew ber power, or her indigna¬ tion. Struck with horror at her conduct, every one now wrote to inform Lord Avondale of the absolute necessity of his parting from her. Hints vvere not only given, but facts vvere held up to view, and a life of folly and error was painted with every aggravation. Calantha knew not at this time the eager zeal that some had shewn to hurl just vengeance upon a self-devoted victim. She was informed therefore of Lord Avondale's expected
return, and prepared to receive him with hardened and desperate indifference. She feared not pain, nor death : the harshest words occasioned her no humilia¬ tion : the scorn, the abhorrence of com¬ panions and friends, excited no other sen¬ timent in her mind than disgust. Me¬ naced by every one, she still forbore to yield, and boldly imploring, if she vvere guilty, to be tried by the laws of her country—laws, which, if she had trans¬ gressed, she revered, and would sub¬ mit to, she defied lhe insolence, and ma¬ lice of privale interference. From this state, Calantha was at length aroused by the return of Lord Avondale. It has been said, that the severest pang to one not wholly hardened, is the unsus¬ picious confidence of the friend whom we have betrayed, the look of radiant heahh and joy which we never more must share, that eye of unclouded virtue, that smile of a heart at rest, and, worse than all perhaps, the soft confiding words
»ι and fond caresses offered after Jonar ab- sence. Cruel is such suffering. Such pang Calantha had already once endured, when last she had parted from her lord ; and for such meeting she was again pre¬ pared. She had been ill, and no one had read the secret of her soul. She had been lonely, and no one had comforted her in her hours of solitude: she had once loved Lord Avondale, but absence and neglect bad entirely changed her. She prepared therefore for the interview with cold indif¬ ference, and her pride disdained to crave his foigiveness, or to acknowledge itself undeserving in his presence. " He is no longer my husband," she repeated daily to herself. " My heart and his are at variance—severed by inebnation, though unhappily for both united by circum¬ stances. Let him send me from him: I am desperate and care not/' None sufficiently consider, when they describe the hateful picture of crime, how every step taken in its
mazy road, perverts, and petrifies the feel¬ ing. Calantha, in tong retrospect over her former life, thought only of the neg¬ lect and severity of him she had aban¬ doned. She dwelt with pleasure upon the remembrance of every momentary act of violence, and thought ofhis gaiety and merriment, as of a sure testimony that he was not injured by her ill con¬ duct. " He left me first," she said. " He loves me not; he is happy; £ alone suffer." And the consolation she derived from such reflections steeled her against every kindlier sentiment. Lord Avondale returned. There was no look of joy in his countenance—no radiant heartfelt smile which bounding spirits and youthful ardour once had raised. His hollow eye betokened deep anxiety ; his wasted form, the suffering he had endured. Oh, can it be said that the greatest pang to a heart, not yet entire¬ ly hardened, is unsuspicious confidence ? Oh, can the momentary selfish pang a vol. m. g
cold dissembling hypocrite may feel, be compared to the unutterable agony of such a meeting ? Conscience itself must shrink beneath the torture of every glance. There is the record of crime— there, in e^ery altered lineament of that well known face. How pale the withered cheek—how faint the smile that tries to make light and conceal the evil under which the soul is writhing. And could Calantha see it, and yet live? Could she behold him kind, com¬ passionating, mournful, and yet sur¬ vive it ? No—no frenzy of despair, no racking pains of ill requited love; no, not all that sentiment and romance can paint or fancy, were ever equal to that moment. Before severity, she had not bowed—before contempt, she had not shed one tear—against every menace, she felt hardened; but in the presence of that pale and altered brow, she sunk at once. With grave but gentle earnest¬ ness, he raised her from the earth. She
durst not look upon bim. She could not stand the reproachful glances of that eye, that dark eye which sometimes soft¬ ened into love, then flamed again into the fire of resentment. She knelt not for mercy : she prayed not for pardon : a gJoomy pride supported her: and the dark frown that lowered over his fea¬ tures was answered by the calm of fixed despair. They were alone. Lord Avondale, upon arriving, had sought her in her own apartment : he had heard of her illness· The duke had repeatedly implored him to return ; he had at length tardily obey¬ ed the summons. After a silence of some moments : tc T Iave I deserved this?" he cried. " Ob, Calantha, have I indeed deserved it?" She made no answer to this appeal. if There was a time," he said, " when I knew how to address you—when the few cares and vexations, that ever intruded themselves, were light¬ ened by your presence ; and forgotten in G2
the kindness and sweetness of your con¬ versation. You were mv comfort and my solace : your wishes were what I most consulted; your opinions and in¬ clinations were the rule of all my actions. But I wish not to grieve you by remind¬ ing you of a state of mutual confidence aud happiness which we never more can enjoy. " Ifyou have a heart/' he continued, looking at her mournfully, " it must al¬ ready be deeply wounded by the remem¬ brance of your behaviour to me, and can need no reproaches. The greatest to a feeling mind is the knowledge that it has acted unworthily; that it has abused the confidence reposed in it, and blasted the hopes ofone, who relied solely upon its affection. You have betrayed me. Oh ! Calantha, had you the heart ? I will not tell you how by degrees sus¬ picion first entered my mind, till being more plainly informed of the cruel truth, I attempted, but in vain, to banish every
trace of you from my affections. I have not succeeded—I cannot succeed. Tri¬ umph at hearing this if you will. The habit of years is strong. Your image and that of crime and dishonour, can never enter my mind together. Put me not then to the agony of speaking to you in a manner you could not bear, andl should repent. They say you are not yet guilty ; and that the man for whom I was aban* doned has generously saved you—but consider the magnitude of those injuries which ï have received : and think me not harsh, if í pronounce this doom upon myself and you : — Calantha, we must part." The stern brow gave way before these words; and the paleness of death over¬ spread her form. Scarce could she sup¬ port herself. He continued : " What¬ ever it may cost me, and much no doubt I shall suffer, I can be firm. No impor¬ tunity from others, no stratagems shall g3
prevail. I came > because I would nor shrink from the one painful trial I had imposed upon myself. For your's ana other's sakes, I came, because I thought it best to break to you myself my irre¬ vocable determination. Too long 1 have felt your pow r er : too dearly I loved you, to cast dishonour upon your as yet un¬ sullied name. The world may pardon, and friends vvill still surround you. I will give you half of all that I possess on earth : and I vvill see that you are sup¬ ported and treated with respect. You will be loved and honoured ; and, more ïhm thìSj our children, Calantha, even those precious and dear ties which should have reminded you of your duty to them, if not to me,—yes, even our children, I will not take from you, as long as your future conduct may autho¬ rize me in leaving them under your care. 1 will not tear you from every remain¬ ing hope ; nor by severity plunge you
into further guilt ; but as for him, say only that he for whom I am abandoned was unworthy/' As he uttered these words, the frenzy of passion for one moment shook his frame. Calantha in terror snatched his hand. " Oh, hear me, hear me, and be merciful !" she cried, throwing her¬ self before his feet.—" For God's sake hear me." " The injury was great," he cried : " the villain was masked ; but the remembrance of it is deep and eternal." He struggled to extricate his hand from her grasp: it was cold and trem¬ bling ----" Calm yourself," he at length said, recovering his composure : " these scenes may break my heart, but they cannotalter its purpose. I may see your tears, and while under the influence of a woman I have loved too vvell, be moved to my own dishonour. I may behold you humble, penitent, wretched, and being man, not have strength of mind to resist." g 4
" And is there no hope, Avondale ?" ť< None for me," ,he replied mournfully: и you have stabbed here even to my .very hear of hearts." "Oh, hear me! look upon me." " Grant that I yield, wretched woman ; say that I forgive you —that you make use of an attachment ihat perhaps never yet was equalled, to mislead my feelings—Calantha, can you picture to yourself the scene that must ensue? Can you look onward into after life, and trace the progress of our me¬ lancholy journey through it ? Can you do this, and yet attempt to realize, what I shudder even at contemplating ? Un¬ blest in each other, solitary, suspicious, irritated, and deeply injured—if we live alone, we shall curse the hours as they pass, and if we rush for consolation into society, misrepresented, pointed at, de¬ rided,—oh, how shall we bear it?" Her shrieks, her tears, now over¬ powered every other feeling. "Then it is for the last time we meet. Yon come
to tell me this. You think I can endure it ?" " We will not endure it," he cried fiercely, breaking from her. *' I wish not to speak with severity ; but beware, for my whole soul is in agony, and fierce passion domineers : tempt me not to harm you, my beloved : return to your father: I will write — I will see you again."-----" Oh ! leave me not—yet hear me.—I am not guilty—I am innocent- Henry, I am innocent." Calantha knelt before him, as she spoke :-—her tears choaked her voice. " Yet hear me ; look at me once ; see, see in this face if it bear traces of guilt. Look, Henry. You will not leave me," She fell before him ; and knelt at his feet. " Do you remember how you once loved me ?" she said, clasping his hand in her's. " Think how dear we have been to each other: and will you now abandon me ? Henry, my husband, have you forgotten me ? Look at the boy. Is it not your's? Am I not iu G δ
mother ? Will you cause her death who gave him life? Will you cast disgrace upon the mother of your child ? Can you abandon me—can you, have you the heart ?—-Have mercy, oh my God ! have mercy— ï am innocent."
CHAPTER XV.
The convulsive sobs of real agony, the eloquence which despair and affection create in all, the pleadings of his own kind and generous heart vvere vain. He raised her senseless from the earth ; he placed her upon a couch ; and without daring to look upon her, as he extricated his hand from the strong grasp of terror, he fled from ber apartment. Mrs. Seymour had waited to see him; and, when he had quitted her niece's room, she arrested him as he would have hastened by her, at the head of the stairs. Her ill state of health, and deep anxiety, had enfeebled her too much to endure the shock of hearing his irrevocable in¬ tention. He knew this, and wished to break it to her gently. She pressed his
hand ; she looked upon his counte¬ nance. All a mother's heart spoke in those looks. Was there a hope yet left for her unhappy niece? "Oh, if there yet be hope, speak, Lord Avondale; spare the feelings of one who never in¬ jured you : look in that face and have mercy, for in it there is all the bitterness of despair/* He sought for expressions that might soften the pang—he wished to give her hope ; but too much agitated himself to know what he then said : " I am resolved—I am going immediately," he said., and passed her by in haste. He saw not the effect of his words—h*e heard no* the smothered shriek of a heart-* ^oken parent. As he rushed forward, he met the duke, who in one moment maj ked in the altered manner of Lord Avondale— the perfect calm—the chilling proud re¬ serve he had assumed, that there was no hope of reconciliado«. He offered him bis hand; he was himself much flioved,
*<I can never ask, or expect you to for¬ give her," he said in a low broken voice· " Your generous forbearance has been fully appreciated by me. I number ¿t amongst the heaviest of my calamities, that I can only greet you on your return with my sincere condolements. Alas! I gave you as an i n heritage a bitter por¬ tion. You are at liberty to resent as a man, a conduct, which not even a father can expect, or ask you to forgive/' Lord Avondale turned abruptly from the duke : " Are my horses put to the carriage?" he said impatiently to a ser¬ vant. "All is in readiness/* "You will not go?" "I must: my uncle waits forme at the inn at Belfont: he vvouid scarcely permit me..». 5 * The shrieks of women from an adjoin¬ ing' apartment interrupted Lord Avon» dale. The duke hastened to the spot. Lord Avondale reluctantly followed. "Lady Avondale is dead," said one: " the barbarian has murdered her/'—
Lord Avondale flew forward. The vio¬ lence of her feelings had been tried too far. That irrevocable sentence, that as¬ sumed sternness, had struck upon a heart, already breaking. Calantha was with some difficulty brought to herself. " Is he gone ?" were the first words she uttered. " Oh ! let him not leave me yet/' Sir Richard, having waited at Belfont till his patience was wholly exhausted, had entered the castle, and seeing how matters werç likely to terminate, urged his nephew with extreme severity to be firm. "This is all art," he said: "be not moved by it/' Lord Avondale w r aited to hear that Calantha was better, then entered the carriage, and drove off, 14 1 will stay awhile," said Sir Richard, "and see how she is; but if you wait for me at Kelly Cross, I will overtake you there. Be firm : this is all subter¬ fuge, and what might have been ex¬ pected."
Calantha, upon recovering, sought Sir Richard. Her looks were haggard and wild: despair had given them a dreadful expression. " Have mercy— have mercy. I command, I do not im¬ plore you to grant me one request," she said—" to give me yet one chance, how¬ ever, undeserved. Let me see him, cruel man : ■ let me kneel to him." " Kneel to him i" cried Sir Richard, with indig¬ nation : " never. You have used your arts long enough to make a fool, and a slave of a noble confiding husband. There is some justice in Heaven. I thank God his eyes are open at last. He has acted like a man. Had he par¬ doned an ad u 1 tress—-had he heard her, and suffered his reason to be be¬ guiled—had he taken again to his heart the wanton who has sacrificed his ho* hour, his happiness, and every tie, I would have renounced him for evet. No, no, he shall not return : by God> ke «hall not see you again/*
"Have mercy," still repeated Lady Avondale; but it was but faintly. " I'll never have mercy for one like you, ser·· pent, who, having been fondled in his bosom, bit him to the heart. Are you not ashamed to look at me?'* Calantha's tears had flowed in the presence of her husband; but now they ceased. Sir Richard softened in his manner. " Our chances in life are as in a lottery/' he said; "and if one who draws the highest prize of all, throws it away in very wan» tonness, and then sits down to mourn for it, who will be so great a hypocrite, or so base a flatterer, as to affect com¬ passion ? You had no pity for him : you ©ught not to be forgiven." " Can you answer it to yourself ίο refuse me one interview ? Can you have the heart to speak with such severity to one already fallen?" "Madam, why do you appeal to me? What are you ap¬ proaching me for? What can I do?" "Oh, there will be curses on you*
head, Sir Richard, for this ; but I vvill follow him. There is no hope for me butin seeing him myself/' "There is no hope at all, madam/' said Sir Richard, triumphantly: "he's my own nephew; and he acts as he ought. Lady Avon· dale, he desires you may be treated with every possible respect. Your ehilden will be left with you, as long as your conduct---------" " Will he see me ?" "Never."
CHAPTER XVI.
Sir Richard ordered his carriage at twelve that evening, and did not even tell Lady Avondale that he was going from the castle. Calantha, fatigued with the exertions of the day, too ill and too agitated to leave her room, threw herself upon the bed near her little son. Mac Allain and the nurse spoke with her; promised to perform her last injunctions j then left her to herself. The soft breathing of Harry Mowbrey, who slept undisturbed beside her, soothed and composed her mind. Her thoughts now travelled back with rapidity over the varied scenes of her early and hap¬ pier days: her life appeared before her like a momentary trance—like a dream that leaves a feverLsh and indistinct alarm
upon the mind. The span of existence recurred in memory to her view, and vvith it all its hopes, its illusions, and its fears. She started with abhorrence at every remembrance of her former con¬ duct, her infidelity and neglect of the best and kindest of husbands—her dis* obedience lo an honoured parent's com¬ mands, and tears of agonizing remorse streamed from her eyes. In that name of husband the full hor¬ ror of her guilt appeared. Every event had conspired together to blast his rising fortunes, and his dawning fame. His generous forbearance to herself, was, in fact, a sacrifice of every worldly hope ; for, of all sentiments, severe and just resentment from one deeply injured, is that which excites the strongest sym¬ pathy; while a contrary mode of con¬ duct, however founded upon the highest and best qualities of a noble mind, is rarely appreciated. The cry of justice is alone supported; and the husband vvho
spares and protects an erring wife, sa¬ crifices his future hopes of fame and ex¬ alted Heutation at the shrine of mercy and of love. She suddenly started with alarm. " What then will become of me ?" she cried. " The measure of my iniquity is at its full." Calantha's tears fell upon her sleeping boy. He awoke, and he beheld his mother; but he could not discern the agitation of her mind. He looked on her, therefore* with that radiant look of happiness which brightens the smile of childhood; nor knew, as he snatched one kiss in haste, that it was the last, the last kiss from a mother, which ever through life should bless him with its pressure. lt was now near tlie hour of twelve ; and Mrs. Seymour cautiously approached Calantha's bed. " Is it time?" " Not yet, my child." " Is Sir Richard gone?" "No; he is still in his own apartment, I have written a few lines," said Mis Seymour tenderly; " but if you fail.
what hope is there that any thing I can -say will avail ?" " Had my mother lived," said Calantha, * c she had acted as you have done. You look so like her at this moment, that it breaks my heart. Thank God, she does not live, to see her child's disgrace." As she spoke, Calantha burst into tears, and threw her arms around her aunt's neck. " Calm yourself, my child/' " Hear me/* said Lady Avondale. " Perhaps I shall never more see you. 1 have drawn down such misery upon myself, that I cannot bear up under it. If I should die,—and there is a degree of grief that kills—take care of my children. Tlide from them their mother's errors. Oh, my dear aunt, at such a moment as this, how all that attracted in life, all that appeared brilliant, fades away. What isit I have sought for? Not real hap¬ piness—not virtue, but vanity, and far worse." " Calantha," said Mrs. Sey¬ mour, as she wept over her niece, " there
is much to say in palliation of thy errors. The heart is sometimes tried by pros¬ perity; and it is in my belief the most difficult of all trials to resist. Who then shall dare to say, that there was not one single pretext, or excuse, for thy ill conduct? No wish, no desire of thine was ever ungratified. This iu itself is some palliation. Speak, Calantha : fear not; for who shall plead for thee, if thou thyself art silent?" " From the deep recesses of a guilty, yet not humble heart, iu the agony and the hopelessness of despair," said Ca¬ lantha, " I acknowledge before God and before man, that for me there is no ex¬ cuse. 1 have felt, I have enjoyed every happiness, every delight, the earth can offer. Its vanities, its pleasures, its transports have been mine; and in all instances I have misused the power with which 1 have been too much and too long entrusted. Oh, may the God of worlds innumerable, who scatters his
blessings upon all, and maketh his rain to fall upon the sinner, as upon the righteous, extend his mercy even unto me." tf Can I do any thing for you, my child ?'* said Mrs. Seymour. " Speak for me to Sophia and Frances," said Calantha, "and say one word for me to the good and the kind; for indeed 1 have ever found the really virtuous most kind. As to the rest, if any of those with whom I passed my happier days remember me, tell them, that even in this last sad hour I think with affection of them; and say, that when I look back even now witb melancholy pleasure upon a career, which, though short, was gay and brilliant— upon happiness, which though too soon misused and thrown away, was real and great, it is the remembrance of my friends, and companions—it is the thought of their affection and kindness, which adds to and imbitters every regret—for that kindness was lavished in vain. Tell them
I do not hope that my example can amend them : they will not turn from one wrong pursuit for me; they will not compare themselves with Calantha; they have not an Avondale to leave and to betray. Y T et when they read my history —if amidst the severity of justice which such a narrative must excite, some feel¬ ings of forgiveness and pity should arise, perhaps the prayer of one, who has suf¬ fered much, may ascend for them, and the thanks of a broken heart be accepted in return." Mrs. Seymour wept, and promised to perform Calantha's wishes. She was still with her, when Mac Allain knocked at the door, and whispered, that all was in readiness. " Explain every thing to my father," said Calantha, again embracing her aunt; is and now farewell/'
CHAPTER XVII.
ίς Sure what a stormy night it is ! Lord help us, Mr. Mac Allain," said the nurse, as she wrapped her thick cloth mantle over the sweet slumberer that fondled in her bosom, and got into a post-chaise and four with much trepida¬ tion and diflicultv. " I never saw the like! there's wind enough to blow us into the sea, and sea enough to deluge the land. The Holy Virgin, and all the saints protect us!" Gerald Mac Allain having with some trouble secured the re¬ luctant and loquacious matron, now re¬ turned for another and a dearer charge, who, trembling and penitent* followed him to the carriage. " Farewell, my kind pre¬ server," said Calantha, her voice scarcely audible. " God bless, God protect you» VOL. III. Η
dear lady," said the old man in bittei grief. " Take care ofthe children. Tell my father that I have been led to this step by utter despair. Let no one suspect your friendly aid. Lord Avondale, though he may refuse to see me, will not be offended with the kind hearts that had pity on my misfortunes." " God bless you, dear lady," again reiterated the old man, as the carriage drove swiftly from the gates· But the blessing of God was not vvith Lady Avondale; she had renounced his favour and protection in the hour of prosperity; and she durst not even im¬ plore his mercy or his pardon in her present affliction. Thoughts of bitter¬ ness crowded together: she could no longer weep—the pressure upon her heart and brain would not permit it. " Eh ! dear heart, how the carriage rowls !" was the first exclamation which awoke her to a remembrance of her situation. " We are ascending the moun-
tain. Fear not, good nurse. Your kind¬ ness in accompanjring me shall never be forgotten." " Och musha, what a piteous night it is !—I did not reckon upon it." " You shall be rewarded and doubly rewarded for your goodness. I shall never forget it. Lord Avondale will reward you." " Iley sure you make me weep to hear you ; but I wish you'd tell the cattle not to drive so uncom¬ mon brisk up the precipice. Lord have mercy, if there ain't shrouds flying over the mountains !" " It is only the flakes of snow driven by the tempest." " Do not fret vourself thus," conti- nued Lady Avondale. " I vvill take care of you, good nurse." " 1 have heard say, and sure I hope it's no sin to mention it again, my lady, that the wind's nothing more than the souls of bad christians, who can't get into Heaven, driven on¬ ward, alacks the pity ! and shrieking as they pass." " 1 have heard the same/' h 9
replied Calantha mournfully. " Och lord ! my lady, I hope not : l'am sure it's a horrid thought. I hope you don't be¬ lieve it. But how terrible your dear ladyship looks, by the light of the moon. I trust in all the saints, the rob¬ bers have not heard of our journey.— Hark what a shriek !" * e It is nothing but the wind rushing over the vast body of the sea. You must not give way to terror. See how the child sleeps: they say one may go in safety the world over, with such a cherub: Heaven protects it. Sing 4 1 to rest, nurse, or tell it some merry tale/* The carriage proceeded over the rocky path, for it could scarce be termed a road ; the wind whistled in at the wiu- dows ; and the snow drifting, covered every object. " There it comes again/' said the affrighted nurse. " What comes?'* ** The shroud with the death's head peeping out of it. It was just such a night as this, last Friday night as ever
came, when the doctor's brother, the prophet Camioli, on his death bed, sent for bis ungrateful daughter, and she would not come. I never shall forget that night. Well, if I did not hear the shriek of the dear departed two full hours after he gave up the ghost. The lord help us in life, as in death, and defend us from wicked children. I hope your dear ladyship does'nt remember that it was just on this very spot at the crossing, that Drax O'Morven was murdered by his H son : and is*nt there the cross, as I live, just placed right over against the road to warn passengers of their danger.-— Oh I м — " What is the matter, nurse ? For Hea¬ ven sake speak." " Oh!"—" Stop the carriage. In the name of his Grace the Duke of Altamonte, I desire you to stop," cried a voice from behind. " Drive on, boys, for your life. Drive on in mercy. We are just at Baron's Down :—I see h S
the lights of the village, at the bottom ofthe hill/' Drive for your life: The nurse shrieked; the carriage flew ; jolts, ruts, and rocks, vvere unheeded by Calan¬ tha. " We are pursued. Rush ou :«- reach Baron's Down :—gallopyour horses. Fear not, I value not life, if you but reach the inn—if you but save me from this pursuit." " Stop/' cried a voice of thunder." " Fear not," " Drive Johnny Carl," screamed the nurse. " Drive Johnny Carl," repeated the servant. The horses ffevv ; the postboys clashed their whips; the carriage wheels scarce appeared to touch the ground. A yell from behind seemed only to redouble their exertions. They arrive: Baron's Down appears in sight: lights are seen at the windows of the inn. The post¬ boys ring and call : the doors are open: Lady Avondale flew from the carriage :— a servant of the duke's arrested her pro¬ gress. " I am sorry to make so bold ;
but I come with letters from his grace- your father. Your Ladyship may re¬ main at Baron's Down to-night ; but to¬ morrow I must see you safe to the castle. Pardon my apparent boldness : it is u un¬ willingly that I presume to address you thus. My commands are positive/ , 44 Sure there's not the laist room at all for the ladies ; nor any baists to be had, all the way round Baron's Down ; nor ever so much as a boy to be fetched as can take care of the cattle over the mountain," said the master of the inn, now joining in the conversation· ** What will become of us ?" cried the nurse. 46 Dear, dear lady, be prevailed on : give up your wild enterprize : return to your father. Lady Anabel will be quite kilt with the fatigue, be prevailed upon : give up this hopeless journey/' 44 You may return, if it is your pleasure: I never will." u Your ladyship will ex¬ cuse me/' said the servant, producing some letters: but 1 must entreat your H 4
perusal of these, before you attempt to proceed," " You had better give my lady your best accommodations," said the nurse in confidence to the landlord : "she is a near connexion of the Duke of Alta- monte's. You may repent any neglect you may shew to a traveller of such high rank." " There's пае rank will make room," retorted the landlord. " Were she the late duchess herself, 1 could only give her my bed, and go without one. But indeed couldn't a trifle prevail with the baisU as brought you, to step over the mountains as far a*, Killy Cross?" " There's пае trifle," said a man, much wrapped up, who had been watching Lady Avondale—" there's пае trifle shall get ye to Killy Cross, make ye what haste ye can, but what we'll be there before ye." Calantha shuddered at the meaning of this threat, which she did not understand ; but the nurse inform¬ ed her it was a servant of Sir Richard Mowbrey's«
CHAPTER XVIII.
The letters from her father, Lady Avon- dale refused to read. Many remon¬ strances passed between herself and the duke's servant. The result was a slow journey in the dark night, over a part of the country which was said to be infested by the marauders. No terror alarmed Lady Avondale, save that of losing a last, an only opportunity of once more seeing her husband—of throwing herself upon his mercy—of imploring him to return to his family, even though she were exiled frora it. " Yet, I will not kneel to him, or ask it· If when he sees me f he has the heart to refuse me/* she cried, " I will only shew him my child; and if he can look upon it, and kill its mother, let him do it. 1 think in that nó
case« -yes, I do feel certain that I can en¬ counter death, without a fear, ora mur¬ mur.** The carriage was at this time turning down a steep descent, when some horse¬ men gallopping past, bade them make way for Sir Richard Mowbrey. Calan¬ tha recognized the voice of the servant : it was the same who had occasioned her so much alarm at the inn near Baron Moor. But the nurse exclaimed in ter¬ ror that it was one of the rebels : she knew b'm, she said, by his white uni¬ form ; and the presence alone of the ad¬ miral, in the duke's carriage, convinced her of her mistake. " Thanks be to hea-ven," she cried, the moment she be¬ held him, *' it is in ra'al earnest the old gentleman/' " Thanks be to heaven/' said Calantha, " he either did not re¬ cognize me, or cares not to prevent my journey." " We'll, if it isn't himself," said the nurse, " and the saints above only know why he rides for pleasure,
this dismal night, over these murderous mountains; but at all events he is vvell guarded. Alack ! we are friendless." Lady Avondale sighed as the nurse in a tremulous voice ejaculated these ob¬ servations ; for the truth of the last re¬ mark gave it much weight. But little did she knovv at that moment, when the admiral passed, how entirely her fate depended on bim. It was not till morning they arrived at Kelly Cross. * f Bless my heart, how ter¬ rible you look. What's the matter, sweet¬ heart ?" said the nurse, as they alight¬ ed from the carriage.—" Look up, dear. —'What is the matter?"—" Nurse, there isa pressure upon my brain, like an iron hand ; and my «yes see nothing but dim¬ ness. Oh Heavens! where am 1 I'Send,. oh nurse, send my aunt Seymour—Call. my—my husband--— tell Lord Avondale to come—is he still here ?— 1 here is death on, me: I teel it liere—here/*— "Look up, sweet dear:—cheer yourself :.
—you'll be better presently." " Never more, nurse—never more. There is death on me, even as it came straight upon my mother. Oh Heavens !"—" Where is the pain ?" " It came like ice upon my heart, and my limbs feel chilled and numbed.—Avondale—Avondale." Calantha was carried to a small room, and laid upon a bed. The waiter said that Lord Avondale was still at the inn. The nurse hastened to call him. He was surprised ; but not displeased when he heard that Lady Avondale was ar¬ rived. He rushed towards her apart¬ ment. Sir Richard was with him. "By G — d, Avondale. ifyou forgive her, 1 will never see you more. Whilst I live, she shall never dwell in my house." " Then mine shall shelter her," said Lord Avon- dale, breaking from Sir Richard's grasp : " this is too much ;" and with an air of kindness, with a manner gentle and af¬ fectionate, Lord Avondale now entered, and approached his wife. € * Calantha,"
he said, " do not thus give way to the violence of your feelings. I wish not to appear stern.—My God ! what is the matter ?" " Your poor Lady is dying," said the nurse, " For the ¿луе of mercy, speak one gracious word to her." " I will, I do," said Lord Avondale, alarmed. " Calantha," he whispered, without one reproach, " whatever have been your errors, turn here for shelter to a husband's bosom. My uncle and the world may scorn me ; but I will do for thee, what many have done for those less worthy. Whatever the sacrifice, be it life, or even fame, I swear by Him who created me, to forgive, to stand by thee to the last. Every one has—every one may forsake thee, but I—never, ne¬ ver ! Come here, thou lost one. Thou hast strayed from thy guide ancl friend : thou hast renounced thy religion to fol¬ low after the vanities and false light of a* cold and vain philosophy.—I, too, have erred, for I left thee without a guide ;
and now I will dedicate every hour of my life to restore and to reclaim thee, . Oh ! come again, unhappy, lost Calantha. May Heaven forgive you, as I do, from my soul.—What means this silence—* this agonizing suspense ?" " She faints," cried the nurse. " May God have mercy!" said Lady Avondale. " There is something on my mind. I wish to speak—ro tell—your kindness kills me. 1 repent all.—Oh, is it too late?"—It was.—For amendment, for return from error, for repentance it was too late. Death struck her at that mo¬ ment. One piercing shriek proclaimed his power, as casting up her eyes with bitterness and horror, she fixed them upon Lord Avondale. That piercing shriek had escaped from a broken heart. It was the last chord of nature, stretched to the utmost till it broke. A cold chill spread itself over her limbs. In the struggle of death, she had thrown her arms around her hus-
band's neck ; and when her tongue cleaved to her mouth, and her lips were cold and powerless, her eyes yet bright vvith departing life had fixed themselves earnestly upon him, as if imploring par¬ don for the past. Oh, resist not that look,, Avondale! it is the last. Forgive her—pity her: and if ^hey call it weakness in thee thus to weep, tell them that man is weak, and death dissolves the keenest enmities, "Oh! tell them, that there is something in a last look from those whom we have once Joved, to which the human soul can never be insensible» But when that look is such as was Calantha's, and when the last prayer her dying lips expressed was for mercy, who shall dare to refuse and to resist it ? It might have rent a harder bosom than thine. It may ascend and plead before the throne of Heaven. It was the prayer of a dying penitent:— it was the agonizing look of a. breaking heart.
Weep then, too generous Avondale, for that frail being who lies so pale so cold in death before thee. Weep; for thou wilt never find again another like her. She was the sole mistress of thy affections, and could wind and turn thee at her will. She knew and felt her power, and trifled with it to a dangerous excess. Others may be fairer, and more accomplished in the arts which mortals prize, and more cunning in devices and concealment of their thoughts; but none can ever be so dear to Avondale's heart as was Calantha. And did she thus die, some may per¬ haps exclaim, unpunished for her crime! Did she not live to feel its consequences in all their magnitude and bitterness— to hide under smiles of levity the an¬ guish of her soul—to mask under the appearance of pride and insensibility, the remorse, the terror, the despair, she felt —to receive from strangers unmerited kindness—to hear from malice all that
she too well deserved ? Did she not linger on to see the husband she adored reproached by the cold and stern, for his mercy to herself—to trace in his coun¬ tenance the bitterness of a proud but injured spirit struggling to conceal its sufferings and its wrongs, perishing, by slow degrees, of lhe crudest of all ma¬ ladies—disappointment, regret, injured honour, and blasted happiness? Oh did the God who made her, in commiseration for what she had already felt, spare her this trial ?—He did in mercy ; and on a bed of death, she lay insensible to the present, as to the past.
CHAPTER XIX.
Sin Richard wished to say one word to console Lord Avondale; but he couid not. He burst into tears; and knelt down by the side of Calantha. " 1 am an old man," he said. " You thought me severe; but I would have died, child, to save you. Look up, and get well. I can't bear to see this:—no, I can't bear it." He now reproached himself, " I have acted rightly perhaps, and as she deserved ; but what of that: if God were to act by us all as we deserve, where should webe? Look up, child- open your eyes again—I'd give all I have on earth to see you smile once on me—to feel even that little hand press mine in token of forgiveness." "Uncle," said Lord Avondale, in a faultering voice,
u whatever Calantha*s faults, she forgave every one, although they might have in¬ jured her; and she loved you," " That makes it all the worse/' said the ad¬ mirat, " 1 can't believe she's dead." Sir Richard's sorrow, whether just or otherwise, came too late. Those who act with rigid justice here below—those who take upon themselves to punish the sinner whom God for inscrutable pur¬ poses one moment spares, should some¬ times consider that the object against whom their resentment is excited will soon be no more. Short-lived is the en¬ joyment even of successful guilt. An hour's triumph has perhaps been pur¬ chased by misery so keen, that were we to know all, we should only commi¬ serate the wretch we now seek to subdue and to punish. The name of christians we have assumed; the doctrine of our religion, we have failed to study. How often when passion and rancour move us to shew our zeal in the cause of virtue,
by oppressing and driving to ruin unut¬ terable, what we call successful villainy, the next hour brings us the news thai the object of our indignation is dead,—- That soul is gone, however polluted, to answer before another throne for its offences. Ah ! who can say that our very severity to such offender may not turn back upon ourselves, and be re¬ gistered in the Heaven we look forward to with such presumption, to exclude us for ever from it. Sir Richard gazed sadly now upon his nephew. " Don't make yourself ilf, Henry," he said. " Bear up under this shock. If it makes you ill, it will be my death." " I know you are too generous," said Lord Avondale, " not to feel for me/* " I can't stay any longer here," said Sir Richard, weeping. " You look at me in a manner to break my heart. I wiil return to the castle; tell them all that has happened ; and then bring the chil¬ dren to you at Allenwater. I will go
and fetch Henry to you." " I can't see him now," said Lord Avondale: " he is so like her." *' Can I do any thing else for you ?" said Sir Richard. " Uncle," said Lord Avondale mournfully, " go to the castle, and tell them I ask that every respect should be shewn in the last rites they offer to ---------" " Oh, I under¬ stand you," said Sir Richard, crying : " there will be no need to say t hat- she's lov'd enough." " Aye, that she was/* said the nurse; " and whatever her faults, there's many а -one prays for her at this hour; for since the day of her birth, never did she turn away from those who w r ere miserable or in distress." " She betrayed her husband," said Sir Richard." " She had the kindest, noblest heart/' replied Lord Avondale. ' f I know her faults : her merits few like to remember. Uncle, I cannot but feel with bitterness the zeal that some have shewn against her." *' Do not speak thus, Henry," said Sir Richard. " I
would have stood by her to the last, had she lived; but she never would appear penitent and humble. I thought her wanting in feeling. She braved every one ; and did so many things that---- '* " She is dead," said Lord Avondale, greatly agitated. " Oh, by the affection you profess for me, spare her memory." fi You loved her then even------" ** I loved her better than any thing in life." Sir Richard wept bitterly. ** My dear boy, take care of yourself/' he said. tc Let me hear from you." " You shall hear of me," said Lord Avendale. The admiral then took his leave; and Lord Avondale returned into Calantha's apart¬ ment. The nurse followed. Affected at seeing his little girl, he pressed her to his heart, and desired she might immedi¬ ately be sent to Allenwater. Then ordering every one from the room, he turned to look for the last time upon Calantha. There was not the faintest tint of colour on her pale transparent
cheek. The dark lashes of her eye shaded its soft blue lustre from his mournful gaze. There was a silence around, lt was the calm—the stillness of the grave. Lord Avondale pressed her lips to bis. ** God bless, and pardon thee, Calantha," he cried. " Now even I can look upon thee and weep« O, how could'st thou betray me ! * lt is not an * open enemy tbat hath done me this dis- * honour, for then I could have borne it: ^neither was it mine adversary that did * magnify himself against me; for then * peradventure I would have hid myself 4 from him : but it was even thou, my * companion, my guide, and mine own * familiar friend.'------We took sweet counsel together—farewell ! It was my¬ self who caused thy ruin, I loved thee more than man shoulcl love so frail a being. I could not bear to grieve thee ; I could not bear to curb thee; and thou hast lost me and thyself. Fare¬ well. Thy death has left me free to
act. My vengeance till this hour, for thy sake, was sheathed. Thou had'st a strange power over my heart ; and, oh, Calantha, how thou did'st misuse it 1 /' As he uttered these words, while yet in presence of the lifeless form of his departed, his guilty wife, he prepared to leave the mournful scene. 4C Send the children to Allenwater, if you have mercy." These were the last words he addressed to the nurse as he hurried from her presence. О man, how weak and impotent İs thy nature ! Thou can'st hate, and love, and kiss the lips of thy enemy, and strike thy dagger into the bosom of a friend. Thou can'st command thousands, and govern empires; but thou can'st not rule thy stormy passions, nor alter the destiny that leads thee on. And could Avondale thus weep for an ungrateful wife? Let those who live long enough in this cold worid to feel its heartless- ness, answer such enquiry· How many
¿aíly sacrifice themselves for the wives of others.—How many for a mistress re¬ nounce both fame and country! What¬ ever she had been, Calantha was still his friend. Together they had tried the joys and ills of life; the same interests united iL em: and the children, as they turned ._ their father, pleaded for the mother whom they resembled.—Nothing, how¬ ever, fair or estimable, can replace the loss of an early friend. Nothing that after-life can offer will influence us in the same degree. It has been said, that although our feelings are less acute in maturer age than in youth, yet theyoung mind will soonest recover from the blow that falls heaviest upon it. In that season of our life, we have it in our power, it is said, in a measure to repair the losses which we have sustained. But these are the opinions of the aged, whose pulse beats low—whose reasoning powers cm pause, and weigh and me** VOL. III. ï
sure out the affections of others. In youth these losses affect the very seat of life and reason, chill the warm blood in its rapid current, unnerve every fibre of the frame, and cause the phrenzy of despair. The duke was calm; but Lord Avon- dale felt vvith bitterness his injury and his loss. The sovereign who has set his seal to the sentence of death passed upon the traitor who had betrayed him, ofttimes in after-life has turned to re¬ gret the friend, the companion he has lost. " She was consigned to me when pure and better than those who now upbraid her. 1 had the guidance of her; and I left her myself; when temptation and ruin surrounded her. Can a few years have thus spoiled and hardened a noble nature! Where are the friends and flatterers, Calantha who surrounded thee in an happier hour? I was aban¬ doned for them : where are they now ?
Is there not one to turn and plead for thee—not one í They are gone in quest of new amusement. Some other is the favourite of the day. The fallen are femembered only by their faults/'

CHAPTER XX.
Lord Avondale wrote to Glenarvon, desiring an immediate interview. He followed him to England ; and it was some months before he could find where he was. He sought him in everyplace of public resort, amidst the gay troop of companions who were accustomed to surround him, and in the haunts of his most lonely retirement At length he heard that he was expected to return to Ireland, after a short cruize. Lord Avondale waited the moment of his ar¬ rival ; watched on the eve of his return, and traced him to the very spot, where, alas ! he had so often met his erring partner. It was the last evening in June, Glenarvon stood upon the high cliff;
and Lord Avondale approached and passed him twice, " Glenarvon," at length he cried, " do you know me, or are you resolved to appear ignorant of my intentions ? Long, long have I de¬ sired this interview. For one cause alone, 1 sacrificed myself, my feelings-— my just resentment. You know my wrongs. My heart is bleeding. Defend yourself; for one of us must die." " Avondale,'' said Lord Glenarvon, I " vvill never defend myself against vou. ér d » Y r ou are tbe only man who dares with im¬ punity address me in this tone and lan¬ guage. I accept not this challenge. Re¬ member that 1 stand before you defence¬ less. My arm shall never be raised tgainst your's." " Take this, and defend yourself," cried Lord Avondale in violent agitation. " 1 know you a traitor to every feehng of manly principle, honour aud integrity. I know you; and your mock generosity, ι 3
and lofty language shall not save you/'' ** Is it come to this?" said Glenarvon, smiling with bitterness. " Then take thy will. I stand prepared. 'Tis well to risk so much for such a virtuous wife ! She is an honourable lady—-a most chaste and loving wife. I hope she greeted thee on thy return with much tenderness: I counselled her so todo; and when we have settled this affair, after the most approved fashion, then bear from me my best remembrances and love. Aye, my love, Avondale : 'tis a light charge, and will not burthen thee/' *' Defend yourself," cried Lord Avon- dale, fiercely.—St. Clare, at that moment, rushed forward vvith a troop of followers ; and placing herself between the furious combatants : " Avondale," she cried, "thou shalt not raise thy hand against Glenarvon. By this bleeding heart, I adjure you—by Calantha's last prayer.
and the solemn vow you made her, sully not thy upright honour with this mockery and exhibition. Who doubts thy prow¬ ess, and thy power? Splendid is the ray that surrounds the youthful head of Avondale:—yon miserable victim has yet to live aud to repent. "Oh, hear me," she continued, throwing herself forward before him: if reserve that arm to defend an injured country. Ca¬ lantha's spirit cries to thee from the grave : oh, hear that pra} r er, and remem¬ ber thy solemn vow. Let the worth¬ less live to repent and suffer." " 1 sought thee not," said Glenarvon, fiercely breaking from St. Clare ; " but since it is thy rash desire to strike at one who defies thee—take this."—He rushed forward as he spoke, and struck his dagger into Lord Avondale's bosom, then departed. " Let me pursue. Let me revenge/' said St. Clare, as she consign¬ ed Lord Avondale to the care of her ι 4
followers.—" Monster, bereft of every principle, this is too horrible. I did not think thee capable of this."------Glen¬ arvon fled not from her pursuit: he con¬ tinued his course unmoved. " I could have loved that man/' he said and sighed. —-■"He has nobleness, generosity, sin¬ cerity. I only assume the appearance of those virtues. My heart and his must never be compared : therefore I am compelled to hate him : but—oh ! not so much as I abhor myself." Thus saying, he descended with a firm step by the side of the mountain. He stopped not for the rugged path¬ way ; but he paused to look again upon the stream of Elle, as it came rushing down the vaiJcy ; and he paused to cast one glance of welcome upon Jnis Tara, Glenarvon Bay, and tbe harbour termi¬ nating the wide extended prospect. Tbe myrtles and arbutes grew luxuriantly intermixed with larch and fits. The
air was hot: the ground was parched and dry, Tiie hollow sound of the fo¬ rests ; the murmuring noise of the waves ofthe sea; the tiukling bell that at a distance sounded from the sea' icred florks — all filled İıis heart with vague remem¬ brances of happier days, and sad fore¬ bodings of future sorrow. As he ap¬ proached tbe park of Castle Delaval, he met vvith some ofthe tenantry, vvho in¬ formed him of Calantha's death. Miss St. Clare stood before him. Perhaps at that moment his heart was softened by what he had just heard. -—Approaching her, " St. Clare," he cried, " give me your hand: it is for tbe last time I ask it. I have been absent for some months. I have heard that which afflicts me. Do not you also greet me unkindly. Pardon tbe past. I may have had errors : but to save, to reclaim you, is there any thing I would not do?" St, Clare made no answer, " You may have discom- I 5
forts of which I know not. Perhaps you are poor and unprotected. All that I possess, 1 would give you, if that would render you more happy." Still she made no reply. "You knovv not, I fancy, that my castles have been restor¬ ed to me, and a gallant ship given me by the English court. I have sailed, St. Clare : 1 only now return for a few weeks, before I am called hence for ever. Accept some mark of my regard ; and pardon an involuntary fault. Give me your hand/'—" Never/' she replied : " all others, upon this new accession of good fortune, shall greet and receive you with delight. The world shall smile upon you, Glenarvon; but I never. I forgave you my own injuries, but not Avondale's and my country's/' " Is it possible, that one so young as you are, and this too but a first fault, is it pos¬ sible you can be so unrelenting ?"—" A first fault, Glenarvon ! The lessons you have taught were not in vain : they
have been since repeated ; but my crimes be on you !"—" Is it not for your sake, miserable outcast, alone, that I asked you to forgive me? What is your for¬ giveness to me ? I am wealthy, and pro¬ tected : am I not ? Tell me, wretched girl, what are you?"--" Solitary, poor, abandoned, degraded," said Miss St. Clare: " why do you ask? you know it/'—" And yet when I offer all things to you, cannot you bring that stubborn heart to pardon!"—" No: were it in the hour of death, I could not."—" Oh, Elinor, do not curse me at that hour. I am miserable enough."—" The curse of a broken heart is terrible," said Miss St. Clare, as she left him ; " but it is already given. Vain is that youthful air; vain, my lord, your courtesy, and smiles, and fair endowments :—the curse ofa broken heart is on you : and, by night and by day, it cries to you as from the grave. Farewell, Glenarvon: we shall meet no more."
Glenarvon descended by the glen: his» followers passed him in the well known haunt; but each as they passed him muttered unintelligible sounds of dis¬ content: though the words, " ill luck to you," not unfrequently fell upon his ear;
CHAPTER XXI.
It was at Kelly Cross that Lord Avondale remained till he w j as sufficiently recovered from his wound to proceed. From Kelly Cross to Allenwater, the road passes through mountains, which, rough and craggy, exhibit a terrific grandeur. The inhabitants in this part ofthe country are uncivilized and ferocious. Their appear¬ ance strongly betokens oppression, pover¬ ty, and neglect. A herd of goats may be seen browzing upon the tops of the broken cliffs; but no other cattle, nor green herbage. A desolate cabin here and there ; inactivity, silence, and de¬ spondency, every where prevail. The night was sultry, and the tired horse of Lord Avondale hung back to the village
he had left, and slowly ascended the craggy steep* When he had attained the summit of the mountain, he paused to rest, exhausted by the burning pain of his wound. Lord Avondale then looked back at the scenes he had left. Before his eyes appeared in one ex¬ tensive view the bright silver surface of Glenarvon Bay, breaking through the dark shades of distant wood, under the heights of Inis Tara and Heremon, upon whose lofty summits the light of the moonbeam fell. To the right, the Dartland hills arose in majestic grandeur ; and far onwards, stretching to the clouds, his own native hills, the black moun¬ tains of Morne ; while the river Allan, winding its way through limestone rocks and woody glens, rapidly approached to¬ wards the sea. Whilst yet pausing to gaze upon these fair prospects, on a night so clear and se¬ rene, that every star shone forth to light
him on his way, yells terrible and dis¬ orderly broke upon the sacred stillness, and a party of the rebels rushed upon him. He drew his sword, and called loudly to them to desist. Collingwood, an attend¬ ant who had waited for him at the inn, and had since accompanied him, exclaimed: " Will you murder your master, will you attack your lord, for that he is returning amongst you ?"—" He wears the English uniform," cried one. " Sure he's one of the butchers sent to destroy us. WVll have no masters, no lords ; he must give up his commission, and his titles, or not expect to pass."—" Never," said Lord Avondale, indignantly : " had I no commission, no title to defend, still as a man, free and independent, I would pro¬ tect the laws and rights of my iusulted country. Attempt not by force to oppose yourselves to my passage. I vvill pass without asking or receiving your permis¬ sion." " It is Avondale, the lord's son,"
cried one : ťf I know him by his spirit. Long life to you í and glory, and pleasure attend you/'—" Long life to your ho¬ nour!" exclaimed one and all; and in a moment the enthusiasm in bis favour was as great, as general, as had been at first the execration and violence against him. The attachment they bore to their lord was still strong. " Fickle, senseless beings!" he said, with hitter contempt, as he heard their loyal cry. " These are the creatures we u ould take to govern us: this is the voice ofthe people: these are the rights of man/'-—" Sure but you'll pity us, and forgive js; and you'll be opr king agam. and live amongst us; and the young master's just gone to the mansion; and didn't we draw him into his own court» ? and ain't we returning to our cabins alter seeing the dear crea¬ ture safe : and. tor ail ine world, didn't we unlade Lik- ye tor one if the mur¬ derers in tin· umiorin, cometo kill us, and make us slaves? Long life to your ho¬ nour!".
All the time they thus spoke, they kept running after Lord Avondale, who urged on his horse to escape from their persecution. A thousand pangs at this instant tortured his mind. This was the retreat in which he and Calantha had passed the first, and happiest year of their marriage. The approach to it was agony. The fever on his mind aug¬ mented. The sight of his children, whom he had ordered to be conveyed thither, would be terrible :—he dreaded, yet he longed to clasp them once more to his bosom. The people had named but one, and that was Harry Mowbrey. Was A nabel also there ? Would she look on him, and remind him of Calantha? These vvere inquiries he hardly durst suggest to himself. Lord Avondale hastened on. And now the road passed winding by the banks of tbe rapid and beautiful Allan, till it led to the glen, where a small villa, adorned with flower gardens, wood and
lawn, broke upon his sight. His heart was cheerless in the midst of joy : he was poor, whilst abundance surrounded him. Collingwood rang at the bell. The crowd had reached the door, and many a heart and many a voice, wel¬ comed home the brave Lord Avondale· Tie passed them in gloom and silence. " Are the children arrived ?" he said, in a voice of bitterness, to the old steward, whose glistening eyes he wished not to encounter. "They came,God bless them, last night. They are uot yet awakened." 44 Leave me/ y said Lord Avondale. " I too require rest;" and he locked him¬ self into the room prepared for his recep¬ tion ; whilst Collingwood informed the astonished gazers that their lord was ill, and required to be alone. " He was not used/' they said, as they mournfully re¬ tired, " to greet us thus. But whatever he thinks of his own people, w T e vvouid one and all gladly lay down our lives to- serve him/'
CHAPTER XXII.
Upon that night when the meeting be¬ tween Lord Glenarvon and Lord Avon- dale had taken place, the great procession in honour ofSt. Katharine passed through the town of Belfont. Miss St. Clare. having waited during the vvhole of the day to see it, rode to St. Mary's church, and returned by the shores of tbe sea, at a late hour. As she passed and repassed before her uncle's house, she turned her dark eye upwards, and saw that many visitors and guests were there. They had met together to behold the proces¬ sion. Lauriana and Jessica stood in their mother's bow window, Tyrone, Carter, Grey, and Terney, spoke to them con¬ cerning their cousin. *' See where she
rides by, in defiance," said one. " Mias St. Clare, fie u pen this humour," cried another; " the very stones cry shame on you, and our modest maidens turn from their windows, that they may not blush to see vou.'' *' Then are there few enough of that quality in Belfont," said St. Clare smiling : " for when I pass, the windows are thronged, and every eye is fixed upon me." <* What weight has the opinion of others vvith you ?" "None." "What your own conscience ?" " None/' '* Do you believe in the reli¬ gion of your fathers ?" " lt were pre¬ sumption to believe : I doubt all things." 44 You have read this: and it is folly in you to repeat it : for wherein has Miss Elinor a ris*ht to be wiser than the rest of us ?" "it is contemptible in fools to affect superior wisdom." " Belter be¬ lieve that which is false, than dare to differ from the just and the wise : the op nion of ages should be sacred: the religion and laws of our forefather*
must be supported," " Preach to the winds, Jessica : they'll bear your mur¬ murs far, and my course is ended." The evening was still : no breeze was felt; and the swelling billows of the sea were like a smooth sheet of glass, so quiet, so clear. Lauriana played upon the harp, and flatterers told her that she played better than St. Clare, She struck the chords to a warlike air, and a voice, sweet as a seraph angel's, sung from below, " St. Clare, is it you ? Well I know that silver-sounding voice. The day has been hot, and you have ridden far : dismount, and enter here. An aunt and relations yet live to receive and shelter thee. What, though all the world scorn, and censure thee, still this is thy home. Enter here, and you shall be at peace." " Peace and my heart are at variance. I have ridden far, as you say, and lam weary : yet I must journey to the mountains, before I rest. Let me ride on in haste. My course will soon
be o'er/' " By Glenarvon's name I arrest you," said Lauriana. " Oh, not that name: all but that I can bear to hear." Cormac O'Leary, Carter, Grey, and Terney, now came down, and assisted in persuading her to alight. " Sing to us," they cried. " What hand can strike the harp like thine ? What master taught thee this heavenly harmony ?" " Oh, had you heard his song vvho taught me, then had you wept in pity tor my loss. What does life present thaťs worth even a prayer ? What can Heaven offer, hav¬ ing taken from me all that my soul adored? Why name Glenarvon ? It is like raising a spirit from the grave ; or giving life again to the heart that is dead : it is as if a ray of the sun's glorious light shone upon these cold senseless rocks ; or as if a garden of paradise were raised in the midst of a desert : birds of prey and sea-fowl alone inhabit here. They should be something like Glenarvon wbo dare
to name him/' " Was he all this in¬ deed ?" said Niel Carter incredulously. " When he spoke, it was like the soft sound of music. The wild impassioned strains of his lyre awakened in the soul every emotion : it was with a master- hand that he struck the chords; and all the fire of genius and poetry accompa¬ nied the sound. When Heaven itself has shed its glory upon the favourite of his creation, shall mortal beings turn in¬ sensible from the splendid ray ? You have maddened me: you have pro¬ nounced a name I consider sacred/' " This prodigy of Heaven, however," said Cormac O'Leary, " behaves but scurvily to man, Glenarvon it seems has left his followers, as he has his mistress. Have you heard, that in consequence of his services, he is reinstated in his father's possessions, a ship is given to him, and a fair and lovely lady has accepted his hand ? Even now, he sails with the
English admiral and Sir Richard Mow¬ brey/ 1 The rich crimson glow faded from Elinor's cheek. She smiled, but it was to conceal the bitterness of her heart. She knew the tale was true ; but she cared not to repeat it. She mounted her horse, and desiring Cormac O'Leary, Niel Carter, and others, to meet her that night at Inis Tara, she rode away, with more appearance of gaiety than many a lighter heart,
CHAPTER ХХШ.
Elïnor rode not to the mountains ; she appeared not again at Belfont ; but turn¬ ing her horse towards the convent of Glanaa, she entered there, and asked if her aunt the abbess were yet alive. "She is alive," said one of those who remem¬ bered Miss St. Clare ; " but she is much changed since she last beheld you. Grieving for you has brought her to this pass." What the nun had said was true. The abbess was much changed in appearance; but through the decay, and wrinkles of age, the serenity and benevolence of a kind and pious heart remained. She started back at first, when she saw Miss St. Clare : that unfeminine attire in* spired her with feelings of disgust; all vol. m. к
she had heard too of her abandoned con¬ duct chilled her interest; and that com¬ passion which she had willingly extend¬ ed to the creeping worm, she reluctantly afforded to an impenitent, proud, and hardened sinner. " The flowers bloom around your gar¬ den, my good aunt ;.thesun shines ever on these walls: it is summer here when it is winter in every other place. I think God's blessing is with you." The ab¬ bess turned aside to conceal her tears : then rising, asked wherefore her privacy was intruded upon in so unaccustomed a manner. " I am come," said Elinor, if to ask a favour at your hands, and if you deny me, at least add not unneces¬ sary harshness to your refusal. I have a father's curse on me, and it weighs me to the earth. When they tell you I am no more, say, will you pray for my soul ? The God ot Heaven dares not refuse the prayer ofa saint like you/' " This is strange language, Miss St.
Clare ; but if indeed my prayers have the efficacy you think for, they shall be made now, even now that your heart may be turned from its wickedness to re¬ pentance."—" The favour I have to ask is of great moment : there will be a child left at your doors: and ere long it will crave your protection ; for it isan orphan boy, and the hand that now protects it will soon be no more. Look not thus at me : it is not mine. The boy has no¬ ble blood in his veins : but he is the pledge of misfortune and crime/* The abbess raised herself to take a nearer view of the person with whom she was conversing. The plumed hat and dark flowing mantle, the emerald clasp and chain, had little attraction for one of her age and character ; but the sunny ringlets which fell in profusion over a skin of alabaster, the soft smile of en¬ chantment blended with the assumed fierceness of a military air, the deep ex¬ pressive glance of passion and sensibi¬ le 9
lity, the youthful air of boyish playful¬ ness, and that blush which years of crime had not entirely banished, all, ail awakened the affection of age: and, vvith more of warmth, more of interest than she had wished to shew to one so depraved, she pressed the unhappy wan¬ derer to her heart. " Wbat treacherous fiends have decoyed, and brought thee to this, my child ? What dæmons have had the barbarous cruelty to impose upon one so young, so fair ?" " Alas ! good aunt, there is not in the deep recesses of my inmost heart a re¬ collection of any whom I can with justice accuse but myself. That God who made me, must bear witness, that he implanted in my breast, even from the tenderest age, passions fiercer than I had power to curb. The wild tygress who roams amongst the mountains—theyoung lion who roars for its prey amidst its native woods—the fierce eagle who soars above all others, and cannot brook a rival in its flight, were tame and tractable
compared vvith me. Nature formed me fierce, and your authority was not strong enough to curb and conquer me. I was a darling and an only child. My words were idolized as they sprung warm from my heart ; and my heart was worth some attachment, for it could love with pas¬ sionate excess. In my happier days, I thought too highly of myself ; and for· give me, Madam, if, fallen as I am, I still think the same. I cannot be hum¬ ble. When they tell me 1 am base, I acknowledge it: pride leads me to confess what others dare not; but I think them more base who delight in telling me of my faults: and when I see around me hypo¬ crisy and all the petty arts of fashionable vice, I too can blush for others, and smile in triumph at those vvho vvouid trample on me. It is not before such as these, such canting cowards, that I can feel disgrace; but before such as you are —so good, so pure, ancl yet so merciful, 1 stand at once confounded/'
ťí The God of Heaven pardon thee ľ* said the abbess. u You were once my delight and pride. 1 never could have suspected ill of you." " 1 too was once unsuspicious/' said St. Clare. ^ My heart believed in nothing but innocence. I know the world better now. Were it their interest, would they thus deride me? When the mistress of Glenarvon, did they thus neglect, and turn from me ? I was not profligate, abandoned, har¬ dened, then! I was lovely, irresistible! My crime was excused. My open de¬ fiance was accounted the mere folly and wantonness of a child. 1 have a high spirit yet, which they shall not break. I am deserted, it is tiue ; but my mind is a world in itself, which 1 have peopled ■with my own creatures. Take only from me a father's emse, and to tbe last I will smile, even though my heart is breaking." " And are you unhappy ?" said the abbess, kindly. " Can you ask it,
Mudam? Amidst the scorn and hatred of hundreds, do I not appear the gayest of all? Who rides so fast over the down? Who dances more lightly at the ball? And if 1 cannot sleep upon my bed, need the world be told of it ? The virtuous suffer, do they not? And what is this dream of life if it must cease so soon ? We know not what we are: let us doubt all things—all but the curse of a father, which lies heavy on me. Oh take It from me to-night ! Give me your bless¬ ing; and the time is coming when I shall need your prayers/* 41 Can such a mind find delight in vice ?" said the abbess, mildly gazing upon the kneeling girl. " Why do vou turn your eyes to Heaven, admiring its greatness, and trembling at its povver, if you yet suffer your heart to yield to the delusions of wickedness ?" " Will such a venial fault as love be accounted infa¬ mous in Heaven ?" " Guilty love is the κ 1«
parent of every vice. Oh, what could mislead a mind like vour's, mv child?" gt Madam, there are some born with a perversion of intellect, a depravity of feeling, nothing can cure. Can we straighten deformity, or change the rough features of ugliness into beauty?" " We may do much. 3 ' " Nothing, good lady, nothing ; though man would boast that it is possible. Let the ignorant teach the wise; let the sinner venture to in¬ struct the saint ; we cannot alter nature. We may learn to dissemble ; but the stamp is imprest with life, and with life alone it is erased." " God bless, forgive, and amend thee !** said the abbess. " The sun is set, the hour is late: thy words have moved, but do not convince me. Rise, daughter, kneel not to me : there is one above, to whom alone that posture is due." As St. Clare rode from tbe convent, sbe placed a mark upon the wicket of the
little garden» and raising her voice, " Let bim be accursed," she cried, " who takes from hence this badge of thy secu¬ rity: though rivers of blood shall gush around, not a hair of these holy and just saints shall be touched/*
U
CHAPTER XXIV.
The preparations made this year by France, in conjunction with the allies, and the great events wlrich took place in consequence of her enterprizes, belong solely to the province of the historian. It is sufficient to state, that the arma¬ ment which had been fitted out on the part of the Batavian Republic, sailed at a later period of the same year, under the command of Admiral de Winter, with the intention of joining the French fleet at Brest, and proceeding from thence to Ireland, where the discontents and disaffection were daily increasing, and all seemed ripe for immediate insur¬ rection. Lord Glenarvon was at St. Alvin Priory, when he was summoned to take
the comtmuJ of his frigate, and join Sir Gvìorg.ì lìuchau.in and Admiral Duncan at theT*-xel. Not a moment's time was to be lobt: he had already exceeded ihc leave of absence he had obtained. The charms of a new mistress, the death of Calantha, the uncertain state of his af¬ fairs, and the jealous eye vvith which he regarded the measures taken by his uncle and cousin de Ruthven, had detained him till the last possible moment ; but the command from Sir George was peremp¬ tory, and he was never tardy in obeying orders which led him from apathy and idleness to a life of glory. He prepared, therefore, to depart, as it seemed, without further delay, leaving a paper in the hands of one of his friends, commissioning him to an¬ nounce at the next meeting at Inis Tara the change which had taken place in his opinions, and entire disapprobation of the lawless measures which had been re¬ cently adopted by the disaffected. He
took his name from out the directory; and though he preserved a faithful si¬ lence respecting others, he acknowledged his own errors, and abjured the desperate cause in which he had once so zealously engaged. The morning before he quitted Ireland, he sent for his cousin Charles de Ruth¬ ven, to whom he had already consigned the care ofhis castles and estates. "If I live to return," he said gaily, " 1 shall mend my morals, grow marvellous vir¬ tuous, marry something better than my¬ self, and live in all the innocent pleasures of connubial felici tv. In which case, vou » * ér will be what you are now, a keen ex¬ pectant of what never can be your's. If I die, in the natural course of events, all this vvill fall to vour share. Take it now then into consideration: sell, buv, make whatever is for vour advantage; but as a draw-back upon the estate, gentle cousin, I bequeath also to your care two children •—the one, my trusty Henchman, a love
gift, as you well know, who must be liberally provided for—the other, mark me, Charles !—a strange tale rests upon that other: keep him carefully: there are enemies who watch for his life: be¬ friend him, and shelter him, and, if re¬ duced to extremities, give these papers to the duke. They will unfold all that I know r ; and no danger can accrue to you from the disclosure. I had cause for silence." It was in the month of August, when Lord Glenarvon prepared to depart from Belfont. The morning was dark and misty. A grey circle along the horizon shewed the range of dark dreary moun¬ tains; and far above the clouds one bright pink streak marked the top of Inis Tara, already lighted by the sun, which had not risen sufficiently to cast its rays upon aught beside this lofty landmark. Horsemen, and carriages, were seen driv¬ ing over the moors; but the silent lone-
liness of Castle Delaval continued un¬ disturbed till a later hour. Il was there that Lady Margaret, vvho had returned from England, awaited with anxiety the promised visit of Glenarvon. Suddenly a servant entered, and informed her that a stranger, much disguised, waited to speak with her.—-His name was Vi¬ viani.— He was shewn into Lady Mar¬ garet's apartment. A long and animated conversation passed. One shriek was heard. The stranger hurried from the castle. Lady Margaret's attendants found her cold, pale, and almost insensible. When she recovered. "Is he gone?" she said eagerly, " The stranger is gone," they replied. Lady Margaret continued deeply agitated ; she wrote to Count Gondimar, w ho was absent; and she endeavoured to conceal from Mrs. Seymour and the duke the dreadful alarm of her mind. She appeared at the hour of dinner, and talked even as usual of the daily news.
" Lord Glenarvon sailed this morning," said Mrs. Seymour. " I heard the same," said Lady Margaret. " Youug De Ruth¬ ven is, I understand------" " What?" said Lady Margaret, looking eagerly at her brother—" appointed to the care of Lord Glenarvon's affairs. You knovv, I con¬ clude, that he has taken his name out of the directory, and done every thing to atone for his former errors." " Has he?" said Lady Margaret, faintly. " Poor Calantha," said Mrs. Seymour, " on her death-bed spoke of him with kindness. He was not in fault," she said. " She bade me even plead for him, when others censured him too severely/' " It is well that the dead bear record of his virtues," said Lady Margaret. " He has the heart of...." " Mr. Buchanan/' said a servant, en¬ tering abruptly, and, all in haste, Mr. Buchanan suddenly stood before his mo¬ ther. There was no need of explanation. In one moment, Lady Margaret read in
the countenance of her son, that the dreadful menace of Viviani had been ful¬ filled ; that his absence at this period was but too effectually explained; that all was known. Buchanan, that cold relentless son, who never yet had shewn or affection, or feeling—whose indiffer¬ ence had seldom yielded to any stronger emotion than that of vanity, now stood before her, as calm as ever, in outward show ; but the horror of his look, when he turned it upon her, convinced her that he had heard the dreadful truth. Mrs. Seymour and the duke perceiving that something important had occurred, retired. Lady Margaret and her son were, there¬ fore, left to themselves. A moment's pause ensued. Lady Margaret first en¬ deavoured to break it : "I have not seen you," she said at length, affecting calm¬ ness, u since a most melancholy scene-- I mean the death of Calantha/' " True," he cried, fixing her with
wild horror; " and I have not seen you since.,.. Do you know Viviani ?"—" Re¬ member," said Lady Margaret, rising in agitation, " that I am your mother, Buchanan; and this strange manner agitates, alarms, terrifies me." " And me," he replied. " Is it true," atlength he cried, seizing both her hands with violence—" Say, is it true?" "False as the villain who framed it," said Lady Margaret. " Kneel down there, wretch¬ ed woman, and swear that it is false," said Buchanan ; " and remember that it is before your only son that you for* swear yourself—before your God, that you deny the dreadful fact." Lady Margaret knelt with calm dig¬ nity, and upraising her eyes as if to heaven, prepared to take the terrible oath Buchanan had required. " Pause," he cried: " 1 know it is true, and you shall not perjure yourself for rne." " The story is invented for my ruin/* said Lady Margaret, eagerly. " Believe your mo-
ther, oh, Buchanan, and not the mon¬ ster who would delude you. I can prove his words false. Will you only allow me time to do so ? Who is this Viviani ? Will you believe a wretch who dares not appear before me? Send for him: let him be confronted with me instantly: I fear not Viviani. To connect murder with the name of parent is terrible— to see an executioner in an only son is worse." " There are fearful witnesses against you." " I dare oppose them all/' €c Oh, my mother, beware." " Hear me, Buchanan. Leave me not. It is a mother kneels before you. Whatever my crime before God, do you have com¬ passion. 1 am innocent—Viviani is.·.." 44 Is what ?" " Is false. 1 am inno¬ cent. Look at me, my son. Oh, leave me not thus. See, see if there is mur¬ der in this countenance. Oh, hear me, my boy, my William. It is the voice of a mother calls to you, as from the grave/'
Buchanan was inexorable. He left her.—He fled.—She followed, clinging to him, to the door.—She held his hand to her bosom : she clasped it in agony. He fled: and she fell senseless before him. Stillile paused not; but rushing from her presence, sought Viviani, who had promised to meet him in the forest. To his infinite surprize, in his place he met Glenarvon. " The Italian vvill not venture here," said the latter; "but I know all. Has she confessed?" " She denies every syllable of the accusation," said Buchanan; "and in a manner so firm, so convincing, that it has made me doubt. If what he has written is false, this monster, this Viviani, shall deeply answer for it. I must have proof —instant, positive proof. Who is this Viviani ! Wherefore did he seek me by mysterious letters and messages, if he dares not meet me face to face? I will have proof." " It will be difficult to obtain positive proof/' said Glenarvon.
" La Crusca, vvho alone knows, beside myself and Viviani, this horrid secret, is under the protection of my cousin de Ru t h ven. How far he is acquainted with the murder I know not; but he fears me, and he dares not openly oppose me. Lady Margaret has proved her in¬ nocence to him likewise," he continued smiling bitterly; "but there is yet one other witness."—" Who, where?" "The boy himself/* " Perhaps this is all a plot to ruin my wretched mother," said Buchanan. " I shall have it brought to light/' " And your mother publicly exposed ?" " lf slid is guilty, let her be brought to shame." "And yourself to ruin/' said Glenarvon. " To ruin unutterable." They arrived at Belfont, whilst thus conversing. The evening was dark. They had taken a room at the inn. Glenarvon enquired of some around him, if Colonel St. Alvin were at the abbey. He was informed that he was
at Colwood Bay. " Ask them now/' said Glenarvon in a whisper, " concern¬ ing me." Buchanan did so, and heard that Lord Glenarvon had taken ship for England that morning*, had abandoned his followers, and received a bribe for his treachery from the English court. The people spoke of him vvith much execration. Glenarvon smiling at their warmth; " This was your idol yester¬ day: to-morrow/* he continued, " I will give you another." As soon as Buchanan had retired to his room, as he said, to repose himself, for he had not closed his eyes since he had left England, his companion, wrapping him¬ self within his cloak, stole out unper¬ ceived from the inn, and walked to St, Alvin Priory.
CHAPTER XXY.
Shortly after Buchanan's departure, Lady Margaret had recovered from her indisposition. She was tranquil, and had retired early to rest. The next morning she was in her brother's apart¬ ment, when a servant entered with a letter. " There is a gentleman below who wishes to speak vvith your grace." " What is his name?" " I know not, my lord ; he would not inform me," The duke opened the letter, lt was from Colonel De Ruthven, who entreated permission to have a few moments conversation with the duke, as a secret of the utmost importance had been communicated to him that night; but it was of the most serious consequence that Lady Margaret Buchanan should be kept in ignorance
ef the appeal. The name w^s written in large characters, as if to place particular emphasis upon it; andas unfortunately she was in her brother's apartment at the moment the letter was delivered, it was extremely difficult for him to conceal from her its contents, or the agi¬ tation so singular and mysterious a com¬ munication had caused him. Lady Margaret's penetrating eye ob¬ served in a moment that something un* usualhad occurred ; but whilst yet com¬ manding herself, that she might not shew her suspicions to her brother, Mac Allain entered, and giving the duke a small packet, whispered to him that the gen¬ tleman could not wait, but begged his grace vvouid peruse those papers, and he would call again. " Sister," said the duke, rising, " you will excuse. Good God! what dol see? What is the matter?" Lady Margaret had arisen from her seat : —*the hue of death had overspread her lips and cheeks:—yet calm in the midst
ofthe most, agonizing suspense, she gave no other sign of the terror under which she laboured. Kindly approaching, he took her hand. " That packet of letters is for me/* she said in a firm low voice. " The superscription bears my name," said the duke, hesitating, " Yet if—if by any mistake—any negligence—"—" There is no mistake, my iord," said the servant advancing. " Leave us," cried Lady Margaret, with a voice that resounded throughout the apartment ; and then again faltering, and fainting at the effort, she continued : " Those letters are mine : —my enemy and your's has betrayed them :—Viviani may exhibit the weak¬ ness and folly of a woman's heart to gratify his revenge ; but a generous brother should disdain to make himself the instrument of his barbarous, his un¬ manly cruelty." " Take them," said the dukcj with gentleness: "I would not read them for the world's worth.
That heart is поЫе and generous, what¬ ever its errors; and no letters could ever make me think ill of my sister." Lady Margaret trembled exceedingly. " They wish to ruin me," she cried—" to tear mc from your affection—to make you think me black—to accuse me, not of weakness, brother, but of crimes/'--* " Were they to bring such evidences, that the very eye itself could see their testimony, I vvouid disbelieve my senses, before I could mistrust you. Look then calm and happy, my sister. We have all of ns faults ; the best of us is no miracle of worth; and the gallantries of one, as fair, as young, as early exposed to temp¬ tation as vou vvere, deserve no such se- verity. Come, take the detested packet, and throw it into the flames."—" It is of no gallantry that I am accused ; no weak¬ ness, Altamonte; it is of murder!" The duke started. " Aye, brother, of the murder of an infant." He smiled. " Smile too 5 when 1 say further—of the VOL. III. L
murder of your child."—" Of Calan¬ tha!" he cried in agitation. " Of an infant, I tell \ r ou ; of the heir of Deia¬ val/' " Great God ! have I lived to hear that wretches exist, barbarous, atrocious enough, thus to accuse you ? Name them, that my arm may avenge you —name them, dearest Margaret; and, by heavens, I vvill stand your defender, and at once silence them/' " Oh, more than this: they have produced an impostor— a child, brother—an Italian boy, whose likeness to your family I have often marked." "Zerbellini?" " The same/' " Poor contrivance to vent their rage and malice ! But did I not ever tell you, my dearest Margaret, that Gondimar, and that mysterious Viviani, whom you protected, bore an ill character. They were men unknown, without family, without principle, or honour." "Bro¬ ther," said Lady Margaret, "give me your hand : swear to me that you know
and love me enough to discredit at once the whole of this : swear to me, Altamonte, that without proving their falsehood, you despise the wretches who have resolved to ruin your sister." The duke now took a solemn oath, laying his hand upon her's, that he never could, never would harbour one thought of such a nature. He even smiled at its absurdity; and he refused to see either the stranger, or to read the packet—when Lady Margaret, falling back in a hollow and hysteric laugh, bade him tear from his heart the fond, the doating simplicity that beguiled him:—" They utter that which is true/* she cried. ** I am that whicb they have said." She then rushed from the room. The duke, amazed, uncertain what to believe or doubt, opened the packet of letters, and read as follows :—~ " My gracious and much injured patron, Lord Glenarvon's departure, L 2
whilst it leaves me again unprotected, leaves me also at liberty to act as I think right. Supported by the kindness of Colonel de Ruthven, I am emboldened now to ask an immediate audience with the Duke of Altamonte. Circumstances preclude my venturing to the castle:— the enemy of my life is in wait for rae,— The Count Viviani arid his agents watch for me hy night and by day. Lady Margaret Buchanan, with Lord Glenar¬ von's assistance, has rescued the young Marquis of Delaval from his perfidious hands; but we have been long obliged to keep him a close prisoner at Belfont Abbey, in order to preserve him from his persecutors. My Lord Glenarvon sailed yesternoon, and commended my¬ self and the marquis to the colonel's care. We were removed last night from St, A lvi n 's to Colwood Bav, where we await in anxious hope of being admitted into the Duke of Altamoute's presence.
This is written by the most guilty and miserable servant of the Duke of Alta¬ monte. "Andrew Macpherson." "Thanks be to God," cried the duke, "my sister is innocent; and the mean¬ ing ofthis will be soon explained." The remainder of the packet consisted of letters—many of them in the band-wri¬ ting of Lady Margaret, many in that of Glenarvon : some were dated Naples, and consisted of violent professions of love : the letters of a later date contained for the most part asseverations of inno¬ cence, and entreaties for secrecy and silence: and though worded with caution, continually alluded to some youthful boy, and to injuries and cruelties with which the duke was entirely unacquaint¬ ed. In addition to these extraordinary papers, there were many of a treasonable nature, signed by the most considerable landholders and tenantry in the country^ L 3
But that which most of all excited the duke's curiosity, was a paper addressed to himself in Italian, imploring him, as he valued the prosperity of his family, «nd every future hope, not to attend to the words of Macpherson, who was in the pay of Lord Gle n arvon, and acting under his commands; but to hasten to St. Alvin's Priory, when a tale of horror should be disclosed to his wondering cars, and a treasure of inconceivable value be replaced in his hands*
CHAPTER XXVI.
So many strange asseverations, and so many inconsistencies, could only excite doubt, astonishment, and suspicion ; when Lady Margaret, re-entering the apartment, asked her brother in a voice of excessive agitation, whether he would go with Colonel de Ruthven, who had called for him? And without leaving him time to answer, implored that he would not. " Your earnestness to dissuade me is somewhat preci pi tate — your looks— your agitation...." -'Oh, Altamonte, the time is past for concealment, go not to your enemies to hear a tale of falsehood and horror. 1, u hoin you have loved, sheltered, and p-ntecied, I, your own, your only sister, have toid it you—vvill tell it you further; but before 1 make L 4
mv brother loathe me—oh, God ! before I open my heart's black secrets to your eyes, give me your hand. Let me look at you once more. Can I have strength to endure it ? Yes, sooner than surler these vile slanderers to triumph, what dare I not endure ! " I am about to unfold a dreadful mys¬ tery, which may no longer be concealed. I come to accuse myself of the blackest of crimes/' " This is no time for explana¬ tion," said the duke. " Yet hear me ; for I require, I expect no mercy at your hands. You have been to me the best of brothers—-the kindest of friends. Learn by the confession I am now going to make, in what manner I have requited you/' Lady Margaret rose from her chair at these words, and shewed strong signs of the deep agitation of mind under which she laboured. Endeavouring not to meet the eyes of the duke, " You re¬ ceived me/' she continued, in a hurried manner, " when my character was lost,
and I appeared but as a foul blot to sully the innocence and purity of one who ever considered me and treated me as a sister. My son, for whom I sacrificed every natural feeling—my son you re¬ ceived as your child, and bade me look upon as your heir. Tremble as I com¬ municate the rest. " An unwelcome stranger appeared in a little time to supplant hirn. Ambition and envy, moving me to the dreadful deed, I thought by one blow to crush his hopes, and to place my own beyond the power of fortune." " Ob, Margaret! pause—do not, do not continue— Л was not prepared for this. Give me a mo¬ ments time^—I cannot bear it now." Lady Margaret, unmoved, continued. " To die is the fate of all ; and I vvouid to God that some ruffian hand had ex¬ tinguished my existence at the same tender age. But think not, Altamonte, that these hands are soiled with your
infant's blood. I only wished the deed— I durst not do it. " 1 will not dwell upon a horrid scene which you remember full well. There is but one on earth capable of executing such a crime : he loved your sister ; and to possess this heart, he destroyed your child.—How he destroyed him I knovv not. We saw the boy, cold, even in death—we wept over him : and now, upon pica of some petty vengeance, because I will not permit him to draw me further into his base purposes, he is resolved to make this scene of blood and iniquity public to the world. He has already betrayed me to a relentless son ; and he now means to bring forward an impostor in the place of your murdered infant!"—" Who will do this?"—" Vi- viani ; V r iviani himself will produce him before your eyes/' *' Would to God thar he might do so !" cried the Juke, gazing with pity and horror on the fine
but fallen creature who stood before bim. " I have not that strength/' he con¬ tinued, " you, of all living mortals, seem alone to possess,—My thoughts are dis¬ turbed.—I know not what to think, or how to act. You overwhelm me atonce; and your very presence takes from me all power of reflection. Leave me, there¬ fore." "Never, till 1 have your promise. I fear you : 1 know by your look, that you are resolved to see my enemy—-to hear." " Margaret, I will hear you to¬ morrow." " No to-morrow shall ever see us two again together." " In an hour I will speak vvith you again—one word."—As he said this, the duke arose: and seizing her fiercely by the arm: " Answer but this—do you believe the boy this Viviani will produce—do you think it possible—answer me, Mar¬ garet, and I will pardon all—do you think the boy is my long lost child?" " Have no such hope ; he is dead. Did
we not ourselves behold him ? Did we not look upon his cold and lifeless corpse ?" c * Too true, my sister." " Then fear not : Buchanan shall not be defraud¬ ed.'* " It is not for Buchanan that I speak : he is lost to me : I have no son." " But I would not have you fall a prey to the miserable arts of this wretch. Be¬ ware of Viviani—remember that still I am your sister: and now, for the last time, I warn you, go not to Colwood Bay ; for if you do...." " What then ? ,? " You seal your sister's death/* As she uttered these words, Lady Margaret look¬ ed upon the duke in agony, and retired.

TfiE duke continued many moments on the spot where she had left him, without lifting his eyes from the ground—with¬ out moving, or speaking, or giving the smallest sign of the deep feelings by which he was overpowered ; when sud¬ denly Lord Glenarvon was announced. The duke started back :—he vvouid have denied him his presence. It was too late:—Glenarvon was already in the room. The cold dews stood upon his forehead ; his eye was fixed; his air was wild. " I am come to restore your son/' he said, addressing the duke. " Are you prepared for my visit ? Has Lady Mar¬ garet obeyed my command, and con¬ fessed ?" " I thought," said the duke, u that you had left Ireland. For your
presence at this moment, my lord, I was not prepared." " Whom does Lady Margaret accuse ?" said Lord Glenarvon tremulously. "One whom I know not/' said the duke—" Viviani/* Glenarvon's countenance changed, as with a look of exultation and malice he repeated:— " Yes, it is Viviani." He then briefly stated that Count Gondimar, having ac¬ companied Lady Margaret from Italy to Ireland in the year—had concealed under a variety of disguises a young - Italian, by name Viviani. To him the charge of murdering the heir of Delaval was assigned; but he disdained an act so horrible and base. La Crusca, a wretch trained in Viviani's sei vice, could answer for himself as to the means he took to deceive the family. Lord Glenarvon knew nothing of his proceedings ; he alone knew, he said, that the real Marquis of Delaval was taken to Italy, whence Gonditnar, by order of Viviani some years afterwards, brought him to Englaud, pre-
senting him to Lady Avondale as ber page. In corroboration of these facts, he was ready to appeal to Gondimar, and somo others, who knew of the transaction. Gondimar, however, Lord Glenarvon acknowledged, was but a partial witness, having been kept in ignorance as to the material part of this affair, and having been informed by Lady Margaret that Zerbellini, the page, was in reality her son. It was upon this account that, in the spring of the year ****, suddenly mistrusting Viviani, Lady Margaret en¬ treated Count Gondimar to take the boy back wdth him to Italy ; and not being able to succeed in her stratagems, on ac- countof himself (Glenarvon) being watch¬ ful of her, she had basely worked upon the child's feelings, making him suppose he was serving Calantha by hiding her necklace from his (Lord Glenarvon's) pursuit. On which ialse accusation of
theft, they had procured the boy to be sent from the castle. Lord Glenarvon then briefly stated, that he had rescued him from Gon¬ dimar's hands, with the assistance of a servant named Macpherson, and some of his followers ; and that ever since he had kept him concealed at the priory. " And where is he at this time?''said the duke.— * c He was with Lord Glenarvon's cousin, Colonel de Ruthven, at Colwood Bay."— " And when could the duke speak with Viviani?"—** When it was his pleasure." " That night?"—" Yes, even on that very night."-" What witness could Lord Glen¬ arvon bring, as to the truth of this ac¬ count, besides Viviani ?"—" La Crusca, an Italian, from whom Macpherson had received the child when in Italy—La Crusca the guilty instrument of Vi¬ viani's crimes."—" And where was La Crusca ?"—" Madness had fallen on him after the child had been taken from him
by Viviani's orders : he had returned hi company with Macpherson to Ireland. Lord Glenarvon had offered him an asylum at his castle. Lady Margaret one day had beheld him ; and Gondimar had even fainted upou seeing hirn suddenly, having repeatedly been assured that he was dead/'-—" By whom was he informed that he was dead ?"—" By Lady Margaret and Vi viani ."-" Was Gondimar then aware of this secret?''— f ' No; but of other se¬ crets, in which La Crusca and Viviani vvere concerned, equally horrible per¬ haps, but not material now to name." This conversation having ended, the duke ordered his carriage, antl prepared to drive lo Colwood Bay. Lord Glen¬ arvon promised in a few hours to meet him there, and bring with him Viviani. " If he restore my child, and confesses every thing," said the duke, before he left Lord Glenarvon, " pray inform him, that I will promise him a pardon." " lie values not such promise," said Glen-
arvon scornfully. " Lady Margaret's life and honour are in his power. Vi¬ viani can confer favours, but not receive them." The duke started, and looked full in the face of Glenarvon* " Who is this Viviani ?" he said, in a tone of voice loud and terrible. " An idol," replied Glenarvon, " whom the multitude have set up for themselves, and worshipped, forsaking their true faith, to follow after a false light—a man who is iix love with crime and baseness—one, of 4vhom it has been said, that he hath an imagination of fire playing around a heart of ice—one whom the never-dying worm feeds on by night and day—a hypocrite/' continued Glenarvon, with a smile of bitterness, " who wears a mask to his friends, and defeats his enemies by his unexpected sincerity--a coward, with more of bravery than some vvho fear nothing; for, even in his utmost terror, he defies that which he fears/* " And where is this wretch ?" said the
duke: " what dungeon is black enough to hold him ? What rack has been pre¬ pared to punish him for his crimes?" " He is as I have said/' replied Glen¬ arvon triumphantly, " the idol of the fair, and the great. Is it virtue that women prize? Is it honour and renown they worship? Throw but the dazzling light of genius upon baseness, and cor¬ ruption, and every crime will be to thera but an additional charm/' " Glenarvon," said the duke gravely, and as if conquering some sudden emo¬ tion, "you have done me much wrong; but I mean not now to reproach you. If the story which you have told me is true, I must still remember that I owe my son's safety to you. Spare Lady Margaret ; keep the promise you have solemnly given mc ; and at the hour you have mentioned, meet m^ with the Italian and this boy at Colwood Bay." Glenarvon left the prescnee of the duke immediately, bowing iu t <>ken of assent,
The Duke then rang the bell, and or¬ dered his carriage. It was about four in the afternoon when he left the castle: he sent a message to Lady Margaret and Mrs. Seymour, to say that he had ordered dinner to await his return at seven.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
No sooner had the duke, accompanied by Macpherson, vvho waited for him, left the castle, than Mrs. Seymour sought Lady Margaret in her apartment. The door was fastened from within:—it was in vain she endeavoured by repeated calls to obtain an answer—a strange fear occurred to her mind.—There vvere rumours abroad, of which she was not wholly ignorant. Was it credible that a sudden paroxysm of despair had led her to the last desperate measure of frantic woe ? The God of mercy forbid ! Stilt she felt greatly alarmed. The duke returned not, as he had promised : the silence of the castle was mournful; and terror seemed to have spread itself amongst all the inhabitants, Mac Allain
entered repeatedly, asking Mrs. Seymour if the duke were not to have returned at the hour of dinner; and whether it was true that he was gone out alone. Eight, nine, and ten sounded; but he came not. Mac Allain was yet speaking, when shrieks, long and repeated, were heard. The doors burst open ; servants affrighted entered; confusion and terror were ap¬ parent in all. " They are come, they are come ľ' exclaimed one. " We are going to be murdered. The rebels have broken into the park and gardens : we hear their cry. Oh, save us —save us from their fury ! See, see, through the casement you may behold them : with their pikes and their bayonets, they are destroying every thing they approach." Mac Allain threw up the sash of the window: the servants crowded towards it· The men had seized whatever arms they could find : the women wept aloud. By the light of the moon, crowds were
seen advancing through the wood ar.d park, giving the alarm by one loud and terrific yell. They repeated one word more frequently than any other. As they approached, it was plainly distinguished : —murder! murder! was the cry ; and the inhabitants of the castle heard it as a summons to instant death. The Count Viviani's name and Lady Margaret's were then wildly repeated. The doors were in vain barricadoed and defended from within. The outer courts vvere so tumultuously crowded, that it became dangerous to pass. Loud cries for the duke to appear vvere heard. A rumour that the heir of Deiaval was alive had been circulated—that blood had been spilt. " Let us see our young lord, long life to him !" was shouted in transports of ecstasy by the crowd ; whilst yells of execration mingled against bis persecutor and oppressor. ** Return : shew yourself to your own people: no ruffian hand shall dare to harm you·
Long life to our,prince, and our king !"— Suddenly a bugle horn from a distance sounded. Three times it sounded; and the silence became as general as the tumult previously had been. In the space of a few moments, the whole of the crowd dispersed ; and the castle was again left to loneliness and terror. The inhabitants scarcely ventured to draw their breath. The melancholy howling of the watch-dogs alone was heard. Mrs. Seymour, who had shewn a calm fortitude in the hour of danger, now* sickened with despondency. " Some direful calamity has fallen upon this house. The hand of God is heavy upon us." She prayed to that Being who alone can give support: and calm and resigned, she awaited the event. It was past three, and no news of the Duke. She then summoned Mae Allain, and proposing to him that he should arm himself and some others, she sent them forth in quest of their roaster. They
went; and till their return, she remained in dreadful suspense. Lady Margaret's door being still locked, she had it torced; but no one was there. It appeared she had gone out alone, possibly in quest of her brother.

CHAPTER XXIX.
When the duke arrived at Colwood Bay, he found Colonel de Ruthven pre¬ pared to receive him ; but was surprised and alarmed at hearing that Lord Glen¬ arvon had that very morning sent for Zerbellini, and neither himself nor the boy had been seen since. The duke then informed the colonel that Lord Glenarvon had been at the castle about an hour since; but this only made the circumstance of his having taken away the child more extraordinary· It was also singular that Lord Glenarvon had engaged a packet the night before, and had taken leave of his friends, as if at that moment preparing to sail : his presence at the castle was, however, a full answer to the latter report: and whilst every
enquiry was set on foot to trace whither he could be gone, the duke requested permission of the colonel himself to exa¬ mine the maniac La Crusca and Mac¬ pherson : the former was still at St. Alvin Priory—the latter immediately obeyed the summons, and prepared to answer every question that was put to him. The duke first enquired of this man his name, and the principal events of his life. Macpherson, in answer to these interrogations, affirmed, that he was a rrative of Ireland ; that he had been taken a boy into the service of the late Coun¬ tess of Glenarvon, and had been one of the few who had followed her into Italy ; that after this he had accompanied her son, the young earl, through many changes of life and fortune; but having heen suddenly dismissed from his ser¬ vice, he had lost sight of him for above a year; during which time he had taken into his pay a desperado, named La U 9
Crusca, who had continued with him whilst he resided at Florence. After this, Macpherson hesitated, evaded, and appeared confused ; but sud¬ denly recollecting himself: " I then be¬ came acquainted," he said, " with the Count Viviani, a young Venetian, vvho took me immediately into his service, and who, residing for the most part in the palace belonging to Lady Margaret at Naples, passed his time in every ex¬ cess of dissipation and amusement which that town afforded. In the spring of the year, the count accompanied Lady Mar¬ garet secretly to Ireland, and, after much conversation with me, and many remon¬ strances on my part, gave me a positive command to carry off the infant Marquis of Delaval, but to spare his life. He menaced me with employing La Crusca in a more bloody work, if I hesitated ; and, having offered an immense bribe, interest, affection for himself, and fear,
induced me to obey. My daughter," continued Macpherson, " was in the power of the count:—she had listened too readily to his suit. 'I will expose her to the world—I will send her forth unprovided/ hesaid, * ifyou betray me, or refuse to obey." " No excuses," cried the duke, fiercely : " proceed. It is suificient you willed the crime. Now tell me how amongst you you achieved it." " I must be circumstantial in my narrative," said Macpherson ; " and since your grace has the condescension to hear me, you must hear all with patience ; and first, the Count Viviani did not slay the Lord of Deiaval : he did not employ me in that horrid act. I think no bribe or menace could have engaged me to per¬ form it: buta strange, a wild idea, oc¬ curred to him as he passed with me through Wales, in our journey hither; and months and mouths succeeded, before it was in my power to execute his com- M 3
mands. He sent me on a fruitless searck to discover an infant who in any degree might resemble the little marquis. Hav¬ ing given up the pursuit as impossible, I returned to inform the count of the failure of his project. A double reward was proffered, and I set forth again, scarce knowing the extent of his wishes, scarce daring to think upon the crime I was about to commit. " It is useless to detail my adven tur s, but they are true. I can bring many undoubted witnesses of their truth : and there yet lives an unhappy mother, a lonely widow, to recount them. It was one accursed night, when the daemons of hell thought fit to assist their agent— after having travelled far, I stopped at an inn by the road-side, in the villiage of Maryvale, in the County of Tyrone. I called fora horse; my own was worn out with fatigue : I alighted, and drank deep of the spirits that vvere brought me, for they drove away all disturbing thoughts :
—but, as I lifted the cup a second time to my lips, my eyes fixed themselves upon a child ; and I trembled with agita« tion, for I saw my prey before me. The woman of the house spoke but little English ; but she approached me, and expressed her fear that I was not weih Sensible that my emotion had betrayed me, I affected to be in pain, offered her money, and abruptly took leave. There was a wood not far from the town. " On a subsequent evening I allured her to it : the baby was st ber breast. I asked ber its name,—* Biliy Kendal/ she answered, * for the bve of its father who fights now for us at a distance/ *I will be its father/ I said. But she ebid me from her, and was angrily about to leave me: striking ber to tbe earth, I seized the child. The age, the size—- every thing corresponded. I had bar¬ tered my soul for gold, and difficulties and failures had not shaken me* I had m ^
made every necessary preparation ; and all being ready and secure, 1 fled; nor stopped, nor staid, nor spoke to man, nor shewed myself in village or in town, tili i arrived at roy journey's end." 1 arrived m the neighbourhood of Castle Delaval, and continued to see my master, without being recognized by any other. He appeared much agitated when he first beheld me. I cannot forget his saute. He desired me to keep the boy with me out at sea that night ; and directing me to climb from tbe wherry up tbe steep path of the western cliff (where but yesterday 1 stood wben the colonel »eot for me), he promised to place food, and all that was requisite for us, near the chapel. 1 But trust uo one with your secret/ he said : ' let not tbe eye of man glance upon you. Meet me in tbe night, in tbe forest near tbe moor, and bring tbe child. Mind tbat you éo not utter one word» and let ú not have the power of
disturbing us. Do you understand me?' * Yes/ I said, and shuddered became 1 did so. My master saw me shri k, and reminded me of the reward. I un¬ dertook punctually to fulfil every in¬ junction : it was now too late to repent. But, oh, my lord ! when I think of that night, that accursed uight, what horror comes over me ! " It was past twelve o'clock when I took the boy up from a sweet sleep, and fastening the wherry near the foot of the rock, vvith one hand I climbed the steep ascent, while with the other I carefully held the child. In one part the cliff is almost perpendicular: my foot slipped, and I was in danger of falling ; but I re¬ covered myself with much exertion. There was no moon ; and the wind whis¬ tled loud and shrilly through the church¬ yard. It is, I believe, two miles from thence to the castle ; but through the thick wood I now and then caught a glimpse of its lighted portico; and, re- я å
memberi ng its former gaiety, · you re¬ joice to-night/ I thought, 4 with music * and dancing, regardless of my sorrows, 'or the hardships of others, even more i wretched than I : but to-morrow, the c black foot of care shall tread heavy even * upon you/ '* Tbe wind rustled among the trees. This was the spot in which I w r as to meet my employer. I heard a step ; it approached ; and I pressed the child nearer to my bosom. * Some mother is weeping for you sorely, little boy/ I said ; * and would give all she is worth to see that pretty face again. She little dreams of your hard fate, or into what rouerh hands her treasure has fallen ; but I will not harm thee, boy. Hard must be the heart that could/ Such were my thoughts: God be witness, such were my intentions at that moment. I now saw La Crusca ; and well 1 knew by the villain's countenance his horrible inten¬ tions : the lantern he carried glimmered
through the trees : his eyes glared as in a low voice he enquired for the boy: and, as he was still concealed from him under my cloak, he seized me by the arm, and asked me why I trembled. He urged me instantly to deliver the child to him ; but finding that I hesitated, he rudely grasped him ; and the boy waking suddenlv, cried aloud, * Did not our master tell you to prevent this?' said the Italian, enraged, as, bidding the child be at peace, he abruptly fled vvith it. I heard not long after one piteous shrieka and then all was silent. " I returned to the boat* All there looked desolate. The little companion who had cheered the lonely hours was no more. The mantle remained. I threw myself upon it* Suddenly, upon the waves I thought I saw the figure of the child.. I heard its last cry. 1 ever hear that piteous cry. The night was dark. the winds blew chilly over the vast wa-
ter : my own name was pronounced in a low voice from the cliff. " It was my lord—" " Who ?" cried the duke. " My master, tbe Count Viviani. He had returned to give me further in¬ structions. I ascended the fearful steep, and listened in silence ; but, before he left me, I ventured to ask after the bov, c Leave him to me/ said the count, in an angry tone. * He is safe : he shall sleep well to-night/ Saying this, he laughed. * О ! can you jest?' I said. ' Aye, that I can. This is the season of jesting/ he answered ; * for, mark my words, Macpherson, we have done a deed shall mar our future merriment, and stifle the heart's laugh for ever. Such deeds as these bleach the hair white before its time, give fearful tremblings to the limbs, and make man turn from the voice of comfort on the bed of death. We have sent a cherub thither/ continued the count, pointing up to heaven, f to
stand a fearful testimony against us, and exclude us for ever from its courts/ if Saying which, he bade me hasten to some distant country. He entrusted the Lord of Deiaval to my care, repeated his instructions, and for the second time that night departed. The morning sun, when it rose, all glorious, and lighted the eastern sky with its beams, found me still mo¬ tionless upon the cliff. My eye invo* luntarily fixed upon the great land-mark, the mountains which extend behind yon beautiful valley ; but, starting at the thought of the crime I had committed, I turned for ever from them. I thought never again to behold a prospect so little in unison with my feelings. It is many years since I have seen it ; but now I can gaze on nothing else. My eyes are dim with looking upon the scene, and with it upon the memory of the past/' Macpherson paused:—He turned to see what impression his narrative had made on the duke: he was utterly
silent.— Macpherson therefore continued : " So far we had succeeded but too well in our black attempt ; but the fair boy intrusted to me sickened under the hard¬ ships to which I was obliged to expose him. The price agreed on was paid me. La Crusca joined me; and together we reared the child in a foreign country, so as I hope to do him honour. But a dark malady at times had fallen upon La Crusca. He would see visions of horror ; and the sight of a mother and a child threw him into frenzy, till it became necessary to confine him. I had not heard for some time from my master. I wished to bring my young charge back to his own country, before I died. I wrote; but no one answered myl etters.. I applied to the Count Gondimar ; but he refused to hear me. " I had assumed another name ; I lived apparently in happiness and affluence. " Accompanied bv La Crusca, I return« ed first to England and then to Ireland.
I sought Count Gondimar; but he evaded my enquiries; and having taken the child from me, insisted upon my silence, and dispatched me to Ireland with letters for the Lord Glenarvon, who immediately re¬ cognized and received me." " Where?" cried the duke. Macpherson hesitated.— " At the priory, where he then resided, and where he remained concealed : La Crusca was likewise permitted to dwell there; but of this story my lord was ig¬ norant till now." " That is false," said the duke, " One morning La Crusca be¬ held Lady Margaret even as in a vision, on that spot to whieh I every day re¬ turned ; but he had not power to speak. Madness, frenzy had fallen on him. Lord Glenarvon protected him. His house was also my only refuge. He ga¬ thered from me much ofthe truth of what 1 have related, but I never told bim all. I durst not speak till now. lie was deeply moved with the wrongs of the injured boy ; he vowed to revenge tbem ; but he
has forgotten his promise ; he has left us, he has forsaken us. I am now in the ser¬ vice of another : this gentleman vvill be¬ friend me; and the Dnke of Altamonte vvill not turn from the voice of his mi¬ serable servant. " " Where ?" said the duke starting, " where did you say Viviani, that damned Italian, had once concealed the child ? He is there now perhaps ! there, there let us seek him."—" In the chapel," said Macpherson hesitating, " there is a vault, of which he retains the key ; and there is a chamber in the ruined turret, where I have ofttimes passed the night." " Let ns hasten there this instant," said the duke.— u What hour is it ?" " Nine/ 5 " Oh ï that it may not be too late ! that he may not already have taken advantage of the darkness of evening to escape Í" Saying this, the duke and Colonel de Ruthven having previously given orders to the ser¬ vants to watch Macpherson carefully, drove with all possible baste to the chapel,
near the Abbey of Belfont. But still they hoped that Viviani was their friend- He could have no motive in concealing the child : his only wish was probably' to restore him, and by this means make terms for himself. With such thoughts they proceeded to the appointed spot· And it is there that for some moments we must leave them. The duke was convinced in his own mind who his real and sole enemy was ; he was also firmly resolved not to let him escape : he knew also what part of Macpherson's narrative to believe.
CHAPTER XXX.
Viviani had long and repeatedly me¬ naced Lady Margaret vvith vengeance. In every moment of resentment, on every new interview, at every parting scene, revenge, immeiliate and desperate, was the cry ; but it had been so often repeated, and so often had proved a harmless threat, that it had at leugth lost all effect upon her. She considered him as a depraved and weak character—base enough to attempt the worst; but too cowardly to carry his project into effect. She knew him not. That strong, that maddening passion which had taken such deep root in his soul, still at times continued to plead for her; and whilst hope, however falla¬ cious, could be cherished by him, he would not at once crush her beyond
recovery, A lesser vengeance had not gratified the n*ge of his bosom; and the certainty that the menaced blow when it fell would overwhelm them both in one fate, gave him malignant consolation. Her renewed intercourse with Lord Dartford he had endured. Lord Dart¬ ford had prior claims to himself; and though it tortured him to see them in each other's society, he still forbore : but when he saw that he was the mere object of her hate, of her ridicule, of her contempt, his fury was beyond all con¬ troul. He wrote to her, he menaced her; be left her, he returned ; but he felt his own little importance in the unprovoked cairn with which she at all times receiv¬ ed him : and maddening beyond endur¬ ance, " This is the moment," he cried : *' now, now I have strength to execute my threats, and nothing shall change me. It was in London that Count Viviani, having left Lady Margaret in anger, ad-*
dressed Buchanan by letter, " Leave your steeds, and your gaming tables, and your libertine associates," he said. *' Senseless and heartless man, awake at last. Oh ! you who have never felt, whose pulse has never risen with the burning fires of passion, whose life, un¬ varied and even, has ever flowed the same—awake now to the bitterness of horror, and learn that you are in my power/* Buchanan heard the tale with incredulity; but when obliged to credit it, he felt with all the poignancy of real misery. The scene that took place be¬ tween himself and bis mother had left him yet one doubt: upon that doubt he rested, lt was her solemn asseveration of innocence. But the heart that is ut¬ terly corrupted fears not to perjure itself; and be continued in suspense ; for he be¬ lieved her guilty. Such was the state of things, when Viviani, having by fraud again possessed himself of Zerbellini, sought Lady Mar-
garet, and found her a few moments after the duke had left the castle. He well knew whither he was gone ; he well knew also, that it was now too late to recall the vengeance he had decreed ; yet one hope for Lady Margaret and himself remained :—would she fly with bim upon that hour. All was prepared for flight in case he needed it ; and with her, what perils would he not encounter. He entered the castle, much disguised : he made her the proposal ; but she re¬ ceived it with disdain. One thing alone she wished to know ; and that she so¬ lemnly enjoined him to confess to her : was Zerbellini the real heir of Deiaval ? -«was she guiltless of the murder of her brother's child ? " You shall see him, speak with him/' said Viviani, " ifyou will follow me as soon as the night is dark. 1 will conduct you to him, and your own eyes and ears shall be con¬ vinced/* So saying» he left her to all the horrors
of her own black imagination ; but, re¬ turning at the time appointed, he led her to the wood, tilling her that the boy was concealed in an apartment of the turret, close to the chapel. Suddenly pausing, as he followed the path :-— " This is the very tree," he cried, turning round, and looking upon her fiercely ; u yes, this is the spot upon which La Crusca shed the blood of an innocent for you." " Then the boy was really and inhumanly murdered," said Lady Margaret, pale with horrorát the thought, but still unappalled for herself. " Yes, lady, and his blood be on your soul ! Do you hope for mercy ?" he cried., seiz¬ ing her by the arm. " Not from you.'* " Dare you appeal to heaven ?" Sh« would not answer. " I must embrace thee here, lady, before we for ever part." " Monster!" said Lady Margaret, seeing the dagger in his hand, as he placed his arm around her neck. " 1 have already resolved that I will never survive public
infamy ; therefore I fear you not ; neither will I endure your menaces, nor your insulting and barbarous caresses. Trifle not with one who knows herself above you—who defies and derides your power. I dare to die/' And she gazed unawed at his closely /ocked fist. "*Stab here— stab to ^lW(|ÎÉNWW't, which, however lost and perverféìffyet exists to execrate thy crimes, and to lament its own." " Die then—thus—thus," said her enraged, her inhuman lover, as he struck the dagger, without daring to look where his too certain hand had plunged it. Lady Margaret shrunk not from the blow ; but fixing her dying eyes reproachfully upon him, closed them not, even when the spirit of life was gone. Her murderer stood before her, as if astonished at what he had dared to do. " Lie there, thou bleeding victim," he said, at length pausing to contemplate his bloody work. " Thou hast thought it no wrong to violate thy faith—to make
a jest of the most sacred duties. Men have been thy victims: now take the due reward of all thy wickedness. What art thou, that I should have idolized and gazed with rapture on that form ?— something «^ven more treacherous and perverted ^Дап myself Λ Opon thee» ¿«•-^trese, I revetige the ШЕЕЕфШ many ; Ujc «J nen hereafter, creáHMI like thee, as fair, as false, advance iato the world, ^ prepared even from childhood to make β «system of the arts of love, let them, D amidst the new conquests upon which they are feeding their growing vanity, hear of thy fate and tremble." Saying these words, and flying with a rapid step, his dagger yet reeking with the blood of his victim, he entered the town of Belfont, at the entrance of which he met St· Clare, and a crowd of fol¬ lowers, returning from the last meeting at Inis Tara. " Hasten to the castle/' he cried, addressing all who surrounded him ; u sound there the alarum ; for
the heir of Altamonte is found ; Lady Margaret Buchanan is murdered.-—Has¬ ten there, and call for the presence ofthe duke ; then return and meet me at the chapel, and 1 will restore to your gaze your long forgotten and much injured lord," The people in sho«f f s re-echoed the mysterious words, but the darkness of evening prevented their seeing the horrid countenance of the wretch who ad¬ dressed them. St. Clare alone recognised the murderer, and fled. Viviani then re« turned alone to the chapel.

CHAPTER XXXI.
The carriage which had conveyed the Duke of Altamonte and Colonel De Ruthven from Colwood Bay could not proceed along that narrow path which led across the wood to the chapel ; they were therefore compelled to alight; and, hastening on along the road with torches and attendants, they enquired repeatedly concerning the loud shouts and yells which echoed in every direction around them. They vvere at some little distance from the chapel, when the duke paused in horror,—The moonlight shone upon the bank, at tbe entrance ofthe beech trees; and he there beheld the figure ofa female as she lay extended upon the ground, covered with blood* Her own rash
hand, he thought, had perhaps destroyed her. He approached,—-it was Lady Margaret! That proud spirit, which had so long supported itself, had burst its fetters. He gazed on her in surprise.— He stood a few moments in silence, as if it were some tragic representation he were called to look upon, in which he himself bore no part—some scene of hor¬ ror, to which he had not been previously worked up, and which consequently had not power to affect him. Her face was scarce paler than usual ; but there was a look of horror in her countenance, which disturbed its natural expression. In one hand, she had grasped the turf, as if the agony she had endured had caused a convulsive motion ; the other was stained with blood, which had flowed with much violence. It was strange that the wound was between her right shoulder and hcr throat, and not immediately perceivable, as she had fallen back upon it:—it was more than strange, for it admitted little N 9
doubt that the blow had not been in¬ flicted by herself. Yet, if inhumanly murdered, where was he who had dared the deed? The duke knelt beside her: —he called to her; but all mortal aid was ineffectual. The moon-beam played amidst the foliage ofthe trees, and lighted the plains around:—no trace of the assassin could be observed :—the loneliness ofthe scene was uninterrupted. A dark shadow now became visible upon the smooth surface of the green—was it the reflection of the tree—or was it a human form? It lengthened—it advanced from the thicket. The shapeless form advanced; and the heart of man sunk before its approach ; for there is none who has looked upon the murderer of his kind without a feel¬ ing of alarm beyond that which fear creates. That black shapeless mass- that guilty trembling being, who, start¬ ing at his own shadow, slowly crept for» ward« tben paused to listen—then ad-
vaneed with haste, and paused again,—* now, standing upon the plain between the beech wood and the chapel, ap¬ peared like one dark solitary spot in the lonely scene. The duke had concealed himself; but the indignant spirit within prompted him to follow the figure, indifferent to the fate that might await on his temerity. , Much he thought that he knew him by his air and Italian cloak ; but as his dis¬ guise had entirely shrouded his features, he could alone indulge his suspicions; and it was his interest to watch him un¬ perceived. He, therefore, made sign to his attendants to conceal themselves in tbe wood ; and alone, accompanied by Colonel De Ruthven, he followed to¬ wards tbe chapel. Thcro the figure paused, and seemed to breathe with åiU ficulty, slowly turning around to gaze if all were safe:—then, throwing his dark mantle back, shewed to the face of Heaven the grim and sallow visage of tt :l
despair—-the glazed sunken -eye of guilt, —the bent cowering form of ftar.-«— " Zerbellini/' he cried, " Zerbellini, come down.«-Think me not your enemy —I am your real friend, your preserver. —Come down, my child. Wirh all but a brother's tenderness, 1 wait for you/' Arouzed by this signal, a window was opened from an apartment adjoining the cloister; and a boy, lovely in youth, mournfully answered the summons. " O î my kind protector!" hesaid. " 1 thought you had resolved to leave me to perish here. If, indeed, I am all you tell me¬ if you do not a second lime deceive me, will you act by me as you ought? Will voti restore me to mv father?'* The V é voice, though soft and melodious, sound¬ ed so tremulously sad, that it imme¬ diately awakened the deepest compassion, the strongest interest in the duke. He eagerly advanced forward. Colonel De Ruthven entreated him to remain a few moments longer concealed. He
wished ίο know Viviani's intention; and they vvere near enough to seize him at any time, if he attempted to escape. They were concealed behind tbe pro¬ jecting arch of the chapel; and whilst they beheld the scene, it was scarce pos¬ sible tbat the Italian should so turn him¬ self as to discover them. By the strong light of tbe moon, which stood all glo¬ rious and cloudless in the Heavens, -and shone upon the agitated waves of the sea, the duke, though he could not yet see the face of tbe Italian, whose back was turned, beheld the features of Zer- beliini—that countenance which had often excited a strange emotion in his bosom, and which now appealed forcibly to his heart, as claiming an alliance vvith him. Let then the ecstasy ofhis feelings be imagined, whdst stdl dubious, still involved in uncertainty and surprise. Viviani, having clasped the boy to his bosom, said in an impassioned voice these words:-—" Much injured child, N 4
thou loveliest blossom, early nipped in the very spring-time of thy life, pardon thy murderer. Thou art the heir and lord of aíí that the pride of man can de¬ vise ; yet victim to the ambition of a false and cruel woman, thou hast ex¬ perienced the chastening rod of adver¬ sity, and art now prepared for the fate that awaits thee. u Albert/' he continued, " let me be the fust to address thee hy that name, canst thou forgive, say, canst thou for¬ give me?" " I know as }et bnt imper¬ fectly/' said the boy, " what your con¬ duct to me has been. At times 1 have trusted you as a fneud, and considered you as a master/' ** This is no time, my dear boy, for explanations—are you pre¬ pared ? At least, embrace the wretch who has betrayed you. Let these tainted and polluted lips impress one Ьш fond kiss upon thy cheek of rose, fair opening blossom, whose young heart, spotless as that of cherubims on high, has early felt
the pressure of calamity. Smile yet once on rne, even as in sleep I saw thee smile, when, cradled in princely luxury, the world before thee, I hurled thee from the vanities of life, and saved thv soul. Boy of my fondest interest, come to my heart, and with thy angel purity snatch the'fell murderer from perdition. Then, when we sleep thus clasped together, in the bands of death, ascend, fair and un¬ polluted soul, ascend in white-robed in¬ nocence to Heaven, and ask for mercy of thy God for me !" " Wretch ľ* cried the duke, rushing forward :—but invaio his haste. With the strength of desperate guilt, the Italian had grasped the boy, and bearing him in sudden haste to the edge of the frightful chasm, he was on the point of throw» ing himself and the child from the top of it, when the duke, with a strong urasp, seizing him by the cloak, h меч bly de¬ tained bim.—" Wretch," he cried, %i live to teel a father's vengeance!—bve to«..* " N Ő
" To restore your son," said Glenarvon, with a hypocritical smile, turning round and gazing on the duke. " Ha, whom do I behold I no Italian, no Viviani, but Glenarvon/* " Yes, and to me, to me alone, you owe the safety of your child. Your sister decreed his death—I sav*d him. Now strike this bosom if you will."—" What are you? Who are you ?" said the duke. " Is it now alone that you know Glenarvon?" he replied with a sneer. "I suspected this; but that name shall not save you/*—" No¬ thing 1 can save me," said Glenarvon, mournfully. " All hell is raging in my bosom. My brain is on fire. You can¬ not add to my calamities/' " Why a second time attempt the life of my child?" ·* Despair prompted me to the deed," said Glenarvon, putting his hand to his head : " all is not right here—madness has fallen on me." " Live, miserable sinner," said the duke, looking upon him with contempt: " you are too base
to die—I dare not raise my arm steinst you." * ς Yet 1 am di fenceless," $^$ Glenarvon, with a bitter smile, throwing the dagger to tiie ground. " Depart for ever from m«*/' s:ud the duke—**your presence here is terrible to all/* Zerbellini now knelt before his father, Who, straining him closely to his bosom, wept over him.—In a moment, yells and cries were heard ; and a thousand torches illumined the wood. Some stood in hor¬ ror to contemplate the murdered form of Lady Alargarei; others, with .shouts of triumph, conveyed tiie heir of Deiaval to his home. Mrs. Seymour, Mac Al¬ lain, and others, received with transport the lom; Inst boy : shouts of delight and cheers, long and repeated, |Ш<с1аи11*ч1 his return. The rumour of these cwiirs spread fur and wide; the concours«* of people who crowded around to hear and inquire, and see their young loni, was immense. A mournful silence succeeded. Lady
Margareťs body was conveyed to the castle. Buchanan followed in hopeless grief: he prest the duke's hand; then rusbed from his presence. He sought St. Clare. " Where is Glenarvon ?" he cried. ** In his blood, in his blood, I must revenge my own wrongs and a mother's death." Glenarvon was gone. One only attendant had followed him, 0*Kelly% who had prepared every thing for his flight. Upon that night they had made their escape, O'Kelly, either igno¬ rant of his master's crimes, or willing to appear so, tried severely but faithful to the last. They sailed : they reached the English shore; and before the rumour of these events could have had time to spread, Glenarvon had taken the com¬ mand of his ship, following with intent to join the British fleet, far away from his enemies and his friends. Macpherson was immediately seized· He acknowledged that Lord Glenarvon, driven to the necessity of concealing
himself, had, vvith Lady Margaret and Count Gondimar's assistance, assumed the name of Viviani, until the time when be appeared in his own character at St. Alvin Priory. The rest of the confes¬ sion he had privately made concerning the child was found to be true. Wit¬ nesses were called. The mother of Billy Kendall and La Crusca corroborated the fact. La Ciusca and Macpherson re¬ ceived sentence of death,
CHAPTER ΧΧΧΙΓ.
The heart sometimes swells with a fore¬ thought of approaching dissolution ; and Glenarvon, as he had cast many a home¬ ward glance upon his own native moun¬ tains, knew that he beheld tbem for tbe last time. Turning with sadness towards them, " Farewell to Ireland," he cried ; "and may better hearts support her rights, and revenge her wrongs ! I must away." Arrived in England, he travelled in haste; nor paused till he gained the port in which his ship was stationed. He sailed in a fair frigate with a gallant crew, and no spirit amongst them was so light, and no heart appeared more brave. Yet he wasi'l in health; and some ob¬ served that he thank much, and oft, and that he staited from his own thoughts;
then laughed and talked with eagerness,, as if desirous to forget them. " I shall die iu this engagement/' he said, ad¬ dressing his first lieutenant. "Hardhead, Ishall die; but I care not. Only this. remember—-whatever other ships may do, let the Emerald be first and last in action.. This is Glenarvon's command.—Say, shall it be obeyed?*'—-Upon the night after Lord Glenarvon had made his escape from Ireland, and the heir of Deiaval had, been restored to his father, a stranger stood in the outer gates of St. Alvin, p r i orv —It was the maniac La Crusca, denouncing woe, and woe upon Glenar¬ von. St. Clare marked him as she re* turned to the Wizzard's Glen, and, deeply agitated, prepared to meet her followers. It was late when the company were as¬ sembled. A flash of agony darted from. her eyes, whilst with a forced, smile, she informed them that Lord Glenarvon had disgraced himself for ever; and, lastly, bad abandoned his country's cause.
"Shame on the dastard!" exclaimed one. " We'll burn his castle," cried another. " Let us delay no Jonger/' was murmured by all. " There are false friends among us. This is the night for action. To-morrow— uho can look be¬ yond to-morrow ?*' " Where is Cormac O'Leary?" said St. Clare- " He has been bribed to forsake us/* " Where is Cobb O'Connor ?*' " He is appointed to a commission in tbe militia: be is a rat." " Frust not tbe faithless var¬ let: they wbo take bribes deserve no trust." " Or^God^'cri^d St. Clare indignantly ; " have 1 lived to see my country bleeding; " and is there not one of hei childreu firm " bv her to the last?" ίς We are all united, " all ready to stand, nnd die, for our li- " berty," replied her eager followers. " Lead on : the hour is at hand. At the " given signal, hundreds, nay, thousands, " in every part of the kingdom, shall 14 rush at once to arms, and fight gallantly
" for the rights of man. The blast of the " horn shall echo through the mountains, " and, like the lava in torrents of fire, we " will pour down upon the tyrants who " oppress us. Lead on, St. Clare: hearts " of iron attend you. One soul unites " us—one spirit actuates our desires: " from the boundaries of the north, to " the last southern point of the island» " all await the signal/' <f Hear it kings " and oppressors of the earth/' said St. " Clare: " hear it, and tremble on your " thrones. It is the voice ofthe people, ** the voice of children you have trampled " upon, and betrayed. What enemy is " so deadly as an injured friend ?" Saying this, and rushing from the ap¬ plause with which this meeting conclud¬ ed, she turned to the topmost heights of Inis Tara, and gazed with melancholy upon the turrets of Belfont. Splendid was the setting ray of the sun upon the western wave : calm was the scene before her : and the evening breeze blew softly
around. Then plucing herself near her harp, she struck for the last time its chords. Niel Carter and Tyrone had followed her. Buchanan, and de Ruth¬ ven, Glenarvon's cousin, stood by her side. " Play again on thy harp the sweet sounds that are dear to me. Sing the song of other days/' he said. " Oh, look not sad, St. Clare: 1 never will abandon thee." " My name is branded with infamy/* she cried : " dishonour and reproach assail me on every side. Black are the portals of hell—black are the fiends that await to seize my soul—- but more black is tbe heart of iron that has betrayed me. Yet I will sing the song of the wild harper. I will sing for you tlie song of my own native land, of peace and joy, whieh never more must be mine." " Hark î what shriek of a^onv is •J ét that?"—" 1 hear nothing/' " It w T as his dying groan,—-What means your altered brow, that hornd look ?" It was the
sudden inspiration of despair, lier eye fixed itself on distant space iu wild alarm —her hair streamed—as in a low and hurried tone she thus exclaimed, whilst gazing on the blue vault of heaven : '* Curs*d be the fiend's detested art, Impresati upon this breaking heart. Visions dai к and dread ï ьее. Chilľd is the life-blood in my breast. I cannot pause—I may not rest ; ï gaze upon futurity. " My span of life is past, and gone : My breath is spent, my course is done. Oh! sound my lyre, one last sad strain í This hand shall wake thy chords no more. Thy sweetest notes were brcath'd in vain : The spell that gafe them power is o'er." " Dearest, what visions affright you?" said de Ruthen. " When shall the wishes of the peopie be gratified ? What sudden gloom darkens over your countenance ?" said her astonished followers. " Say, prophetess, what woe do you denounce against the traitor?" In a low murmur« ing voice, turning to them, she answered :
tfi When turf amî faggots crackling blazes When fire and torch-lights dimly burn 5 When kine at morn refuse to graze, And the green leaf begins to turn; Then shall pain and sickness come, Storms abroad, and woes lit home. When cocks arc heard to crow at ev'n, And swallows slowly ply their wing; When home-bound ships from port are driv*n r And dolphins roll, and mermaids sing ; Then shall pain and sickness come, Storms abroad, and woes at home. When the black ox shall tread with his foot On the green growing saplin's tender root; Then a stratiger shall stand in Glenarvon's half, And his portals shall blaze and his turrets shall full, Glenarvon, the day of thy glory is o'er; Thou shalt sail from hence, but return no more. Sound mournfully, my harp; oh, breath a strain, More sad than that which Sion's daughters sung, When on the willow boughs their harps they hung, And wept for lost Jerusulem í A train More sorrowful before my eyes appear: They come, in chains Ihey come! The hour of fat« İs near. Krin, the heart's best blood shall flow for thee«. It is thy groans I hear—it is thy wounds I see. Cold sleep thy heroes in their silent grave «· The leopard lords it o'er ť huir last rotrta.t.
O ? or hearts ihat once were free and brave, Sec the red banners proud!) wavr. Thoy crouch, tin·) fall bol ore a tyrant's fi-el. The star of freedom sets, to riso no moie. Quench'd is the immortal Fpark in endless night.' Never again bhall rny so fair, so bright, Arise o'er Erin's desolated shore." No sooner had St. Clare ended, than Buchanan, joining with her and the rest of the rebels, gave signal for the long expected revolt. ie Burn his castle—de¬ stroy his land/ 3 said St. Ciare. Her fol¬ lowers prepared to obey : vvith curses loud and repealed, they vented their exe¬ cration. Glenarvon, the idol they had once adored, they now, perhaps, with greater show of justice despised. " Were he only a villain," said one, " I, for my part, would pardon him : but he is a coward and a hypocrite: when he commits a wrong he turns it upon another: he is a smooth dissembler, and while he smiles he stabs." AU his ill deeds were now collected together from far and near, to «trengthen the violence of resentment
and hate. Some looked upon the lonely grave of Alice, and sighed as they passed. That white stone wns placed over a broken heart, thev said : another turned to the more splendid tomb of Calantha, and cursed him for his barbarity to tlieir lady : u it was an ill return to so much love—we do not excuse her, but wc must upbraid him." Then came they to the wood, and Buchanan, trembling with horror, spoke of his murdered mo¬ ther. " Hum bis castles," they cried, » ** and execrate bis memory from father to son in Belfont/* St. Clare suddenly arose in tîıe midst of the increasing crowd, and thus, to inforco her purpose, again addressed her followers: — " Let not rage against Glenarvon ac- " tuate your resolves: whatever he may " have done, ς we shall not live to see his " like again/ Shew not such pleasure ' 6 in trampling upou the high: my ven- " geance is just resentment—but how " has he offended you ? England, thou " hast destroyed thy sister country/'
she cried. " The despot before whom " you bow has cast slavery and ruin " upon us. О man—or rather less, О " king, drest in a little brief authority, " beware, beware ! The hour of retri- " bution is at hand. Give back the pro* " perties tliat thy nation has wrested from " a suffering people. Thy fate is decreed ; " thy impositions are detected; thy word " passes not current among us: beware ! * 4 the hour is ripe. Woe to the tyrant vvho "has betrayed his trust!" —These were the words which Elinor uttered as she gave the signal of revolt to her deluded followers. It was even during the dead of night, in the caverns of Inis Tara, where pikes and bayonets glittered by the light of the torch, and crowds on crowds assembled, while yells and cries reiterated their bursts of applause. The sound of voices and steps ap¬ proached. Buchanan, de Ruthven, and St. Clare, parted from each other. " It " will be a dreadful spectacle to see the " slaughter that shall follow/' said bu
4t Clare. ť< Brothers and fathers shall " fight against each other. The gather-» " ing storm has burst from within: it - shall overwhelm the land. One des- " perate efiort shall be made for free- ' É dom. Hands and hearts shall unite * c firm to shake off the shackles of ty- " ranny—to support the rights of man *' —the glorious cause of independence. " What though in vain we struggle-« « c what though the sun that rose so " bright in promise may set in darkness « —the splendid hope was conceived— " the daring effort was made ; and many " a brave heart shall die in the sacred u cause. What though our successors f « be slaves, aye, willing slaves, shall " uot the proud survivor exult in the " memory of the past ! Fate itself can« * not snatch from us that which once " has been. The storms of contention " may cease—the goaded victims may " bear every repeated lasb ; and in " apathy and misery may kneel before " the feet of the tyrants wbo forget
" their vow. But the spirit of liberty " once flourished at least ; andevery name " that perishes i u its cause shall stand ťí emblazoned in eternal splendour— glo· 4i rious in brightness, though not immor- 44 tal in success/*

CHAPTER XXXIII.
" Hark !" said the prophetess : " 'tis the screams of despair and agony :—ray countrymen are defeated :—they fall :— but they do not fly. No human soul can endure this suspense:—all is dark and terrible: the distant roar of artillery ; the noise of conflict; the wild tumultuous cries of war ; the ceaseless deafening fire.—Behold the rolling volumes of smoke, as they issue from the glen ! — What troop of horse comes riding over the down ?—I too have fought. This hand has dyed itself in the blood of a human being ; this breast is pierced; but the pang I feel is not from the wound of the bayonet.—Hark ! how the trumpet echoes from afar beyond the mountains.— They halt—they obey my last com-
mands— they light the beacons on the hill ! Belfont and St. Alvin shall blaze ; the seat of his fathers shall fall; and with their ashes, mine shall not mingle ! Glenarvon, farewell! Even in death I have not forgiven thee!—Come, tardy steed, bear me once again ; and then both horse and rider shall rest in peace for ever." It was about the second hour of night when St. Clare reached I nis Tara, and stood suspended between terror and ex¬ ultation, as she watched the clouds of smoke and fire which burst from the turrets of Belfont. The ranks were every where broken : soldiers in pursuit were seen in detached parties, scouring over every part of the country: the valley of Altamonte rang with the savage contestas horse to horse, and man to man, opposed each other. The pike and bayonet glit¬ tered in the moon-beam ; and the distant discharge of musketry, with the yell of triumph, and the groans of despair, о 2
echoed mournfully upon the blast. Elinor rose upon her panting steed to gaze with eager eyes towards Belfont. It was not the reflection of the kind¬ ling fires that spread so deathlike a hue over her lips and face. She was bleeding to deatb from her wounds, while her eye darted forth, as if intently watching, with alternate hope and terror, that which none but herself could see—it was a man and horse advancing with fu¬ rious haste from the smoke and flames, in whieh he had appeared involved. He bore a lovely burthen in his arms, and shewing her Clare of Costolly as he pass¬ ed. " I have fulfilled your desire, proud woman/' he cried : " the castte shall burn to the earth : the blood of every enemy lo his country shall be spilt. I have saved the son of Glenarvon ; and when I have placed him in safety, shall de Ruthven be as dear?" " Take my thanks/* said Elinor faintly, as the blood continued to flow from her wounds.
ιί Bear that bov to mv aunt, the Abbess of Glanàa: tell her to cherish him for my sake. Sometimes speak to him of St. Clare. " Now, see the flame of vengeance how it rises upon my view. Burn, fire; burn. Let the flames ascend, even to the Hea¬ vens. So fierce and bright are tbe last fires of love, now quenched, for ever and for ever. The seat of his ancestors shall fall to the lowest earth—dust to dust- earth to earth. What is the pride of man ?—The dream of life is past ; the song of the wild harper has ceased ; fa¬ mine, war, and slavery, shall encompass my country. " But yet all its fond recollections suppressing, One last dying wish this sad bosom shall draw : O, Erin, an exile bpqutaths thee his blessing ; Land of my forefathers, Eriu go brah. 1 » As she sung the last strain ofthe song, which the sons of freedom bad learned, she tore the green mantle from her breast» oâ
and throwing it around the head of her steed, so that he could not perceive any external object, she pressed the spur into his sides, and gallopped in haste to the edge of the cliff, from which she beheld, like a sheet of fire reddening the heavens, the blazing turrete of Belfont. She heard the crash : she gazed in triumph, aş millions of sparks lighted the blue vault of the heavens ; and volumes of smoke, curling from the ruins, half concealed the ravages of the insatiate flame. Then she drew the horn from her side, and sounding it loud and shrill from Heremon cliff, heard it answered from mountain to mountain, by all her armed confederates. The waves of the foaming billows now reflected a blood-red light from the scorch¬ ing flames..-..,.. Three hundred and sixty feet was the cliff perpendicular from the vast fathom¬ less ocean. "Glenarvon, hurab ! Peace to the broken hearts! Nay, start not, Cla¬ rence: to horse, to horse ! Thus charge;
it is for life and honour." The affrighted steed saw not the fearful chasm into which, goaded on by his rider, he in¬ voluntarily plunged. But de Ruthven heard the piercing shriek he gave, as he sunk headlong into the rushing waters, which in a moment overwhelming both horse and rider, concealed them from the view of man.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
Short is the sequel ofthe history which is now to be related. The strong arm of power soon suppressed this partial rebel¬ lion. Buchanan was found stretched ín death upon the field of battle, lovely in form even in that hour. The Marquis of Deiaval, restored to his family and fortune, soon forgot the lesson adversity had taught. In the same follies and the same vanities his prede¬ cessors had passed their days, he likewise endeavoured to enjoy the remainder ofhis. The Duke of Altamonte lived long enough to learn the mournful truth, which pride had once prevented him from be¬ lieving, the perishableness of all human strength, the littleness of all human great¬ ness, and the vanity of every enjoyment this world can offer» Of Sophia, of Frances,
of Lady Dartford, what is there torelate ? They passed tranquilly with the thousands that sail daily along the stream of folly, uncen s u red and uncoinmeuded. Youth, beauty, and vanity, vvere their*s : they en¬ joyed and suffered all the little pleasures, and all the little pains of life, and resisted all its little templatiorfs. Lady Mande¬ ville and Lady Augusta Selwyn fluttered away likewise each pleasureable moment as frivolously, though perhaps less inno¬ cently ; then turnéd to weep for the errors into which they had been drawn, more humble in themselves when sorrow had chastened them. Then it was that they called to the flatterers of their prosperous days; but they vvere silent and cold: then it was that they looked for the friends wbo had encircled thera once ; but they were not to be found ; and they learned, like the sinner they had despised, all that terror dreams of on its sick bed, and ail that misery in its worst moments can conceive. Mrs. Seymour, in acts o ô
of piety and benevolence, retired to the Garden Cottage, a small estate the Duke of Altamonte had settled on hcr ; und she found that religion and virtue, even in this world, have their reward. The colduess, the prejudice, which, in the presumption of her heart had once given her an appearance of austerity, softened in the decline of life ; and when she considered the frailty of human nature, the misery and uncertainty of existence, she turned not from the penitent wanderer who had left the right road,and spoke with severity alone of hardened and trium¬ phant guilt. Her life was one fair course of virtue ; and when she died, thousands of those whom she had reclaimed or be¬ friended followed her to the grave. As to the Princess of Madagascar, she lived to a good old age, though death re¬ peatedly gave her warning of his ap¬ proach. " Can any humiliation, any sa¬ crifice avail ?" she cried, in helpless alarm, seeing his continual advances. " Can I yet be saved ?" she said, ad-
dressing Iloiouskim, who often by a bold attempt had hurried away this grim king of terrors. " If we were to sacrifice the great nabob, and all our party, and our followers—can fasting, praying, avail? shall the reviewers be poisoned in an emince ! shall— " It was hinted to the princess at length, though in the gentlest manner possible, that this time, nor sa¬ crifice, nor spell, would save her. Death stood broad and unveiled before her. ** If then I must die/' she cried, weeping bit¬ terly at the necessity, " send with haste for the dignitaries ofthe church. I would not enter upon the new world with¬ out a passport; I, who have so scru¬ pulously courted favour every where in this. As to confession of sins, what have 1 to confess, Hoiouskim ? I appeal to you: is there a scribbler, however contemptible, whose pen I feared might one day be turned against me, that I have not silenced by the grossest flat· tery ? Is there a man or woman of note in any kingdom that 1 have not cram-
med with dinners, and little attentions, and presents, in hopes of gaining them over to my side ? And is there, unless the helpless, the fallen, and the idiot, appear against me, any one whom it was my interest to befriend that I have not sought for and won ? What minion of fashion, what dandy in distress, what woman of intrigue, who had learned to deceive with ease, have I not assisted ? Oh, say, what then are my sins, Iloiou¬ skim? Even if self-denial be a virtue, though I have not practised it myself, have I not made you and others daily and hourly do so ?** Hoiouskim bowed assent. Death now approached too near for further colloquy. The princess, pinch¬ ing her attendants, that they might feel for what she suffered, fainted : yet with her dying breath again invoking tbe high priest: " Hoiouskim," she cried, " obey my last command : send all my attendants after me, my eider down quilts, my coffee pots, my carriages, roy confectioner : and tell the cook— 1 * As she uttered tbat short
but comprehensive monosyllable, she expired. Peace to her memorj' ! 1 wish not to reproach her: a friend more false, a foe more timid yet insulting·, a princess more fond of power, never before or since appeared in Europe. Iloiouskim wept beside her, yet, when he recovered (and your philosophers seldom die of sorrow) it is said he retired to his own country, and shrunk from every woman he after¬ wards heheld, for fear they should remind him of ber he loved so well, ancl prove another Princess of Madagascar. it is said, that all the reviewers, who had bar¬ tered their independence for the comforts and flattery of Barbary House, died in the same year as the princess, of an epidemic disorder ; but of this, who can be secure ? Perhaps, alas 1 one yet remains to punish the flippant tongue, that dared to assert thev were no more· But to return from this digression.
CHAPTER XXXV.
Ат Allen water the roses were yet in bloom : and the clematis and honey¬ suckle twined beneath the latticed win¬ dows, whilst through the flower gardens the stream of Allen flowed smooth and clear. Every object around breathed the fragrance of plants—the charms and sweets of nature. The heat of summer had not parched its verdant meads, and autumn's yellow tints had but just touched the shadowy leaf. Wearied with scenes of woe, Lord Avondale, having broken from society and friends, had retired to this retreat—a prey to the fever of disappointment and regret--* wounded by the hand of his adversary, but still more effectually destroyed by the unkindness and inconstancy of his friend.
Sir Richard, before he departed to join the fleet, called at Allenwater.— *' How is your master ? u he said, in a hurried manner. " He is ill/' said James Collingwood. * ς Ile vvill rise from his bed no more." Sir Richard pressed forward; and trembling exceed¬ ingly, entered Lord Avondale's room.—·· " Who weeps so sadly by a dying father's bed ?" " It is Harry Mowbrey, Calantha's child, the little comforter of many a dreary hour. The apt remark of enquir¬ ing youth, the joyous laugh of child¬ hood, have ceased. The lesson repeated daily to an anxious parent has been learned with more than accustomed as¬ siduity: but in vain. Nature at last has given way :—the pale emaciated form—the hand which the damps of death have chilled, feebly caresses the weeping boy." James Collingwood stood by his mas¬ ter's side» his sorrowful countenance
contrasting sadly with that military air which seemed to disdain all exhibition of weakness ; and with him, the sole other attendant of his sufferings, Cairn of Cole- raine, who од^е in this same spot had welcomed Calantha, then a fair and lovely bride, spotless in vestal purity, an^clearer to his master's heart than the v#ry life-blood that gave it vigour. He now poured some opiate drops into a glass, and placed it in the feeble hand which was stretched forth to receive it. " Ah ! father, do not leave me," said his little son, pressing towards liim. " My mother looked as you do before she left me: and will you go also? Wbat then will become of me ?" Tears gushed into Lord Avondak's eyes, and trickled down his faded cheeks. " God will bless and protect my boy," he said, en¬ deavouring to raise himself sufficiently to press his little cherub lips, lt was like a blushing rose, placed by the hand of af-
fection upon a lifeless corpse--so health¬ ful bloomed theHîhild, so pale the parent stem ! " How feeble you are, dear father/* said Harry : " your arms tremble w*hen you attempt to raise me. I will kneel by you all this night, and pray to God to give you strength. You say there is none loves you. I love you ; and Col¬ lingwood loves you ; and many, many more. So do not leave us/'— u And I love you too, dear, dear Harry/* cried Sir Richard, his voice nearly suffocated by his grief; "and all vvho knew you honoured and loved you ; and curse be on those who utter one word against him. He is the noblest fellow that ever lived." " Uncle Richard, don't cry," said the boy : " it grieves him so to see you. Don't look so sad, dear father. Why is your hand so cold : can nothing warm it?" " Nothing, Harry.—Do not weep so bitterly, dear uncle/' " I have suffered agony. Now, all is peace.—God bless
you and my children." " Open your dear eyes once again, father, to look on me. Oh ! Collingwood, see they are clos¬ ed :—Will he not look on me ever again ? My sister Annabel shall speak to him.— My dear mamma is gone, or she would sooth him,—Oh, father, ifyou must leave me too, why should I linger here ? How silent he is!"---" He sleeps, Sir,"—" I think he does not sleep, Collingwood. I think this dreadful stillness is what every one calls death. Oh ! father, look at me once more. Speak one dear word only to say you love mestili." " I can't bear this/' said Sir Richard, hurrying frorn the room. " I can't bear it/' The hour was that in which the setting sun had veiled its last bright ray in the western wave:—it was the evening of the tenth of October ! ! ! On the evening of the tenth of Octo¬ ber, Glenarvon had reached the coast of Holland, and joined the British squadron under Admiral Duncan. The Dutch
were not yet in sight ; but it was known that they were awaiting the attack at a few miles distance from shore, between Camperdown and Egmont. It was so still that evening that not a breath of air rippled upon the glassy waters. It was at that very instant of time, when Avondale, stretched upon bis bed, far from those scenes of glory and renown in whicb his earlier years had been distinguished, had breathed his last ; that Glenarvon, whilst walking the deck, even in the light of departing day, laughingly addressed his companions : " Fear you to die?" he cried,, to one upon whose shoulder he was leaning. ** I cannot fear. But as it may be the fate of all, Hardhead," he said, still addressing his lieutenant, " if I die, do you present my last remembrance to my friends,—Ha ! have I any ?—Not I* lYaith. " Now fill upa bowl, that I may pledge
you ; and let him whose conscience trembles, shrink. 1 cannot fear; " For, come he slow, or come he fast, It is but Death that comes at last," He said, and smiled—that smile so gentle and persuasive, that only tobehold it was to love. Suddenly he beheld before him on the smooth wave a form so pale, so changed, that, but for the stern¬ ness of that brow, the ñxea and hollow gaze of that dark eye, he had not recog¬ nized, in the fearful spectre* the form of Lord Avondale, " Speak your reproaches as a man would utter them," he said. " Ask of me the satisfaction due for injuries ; but stand not thus before me, Jike a dream, in the glare of day—like a grim vision ofthe night, in the presence öf thousands."—The stern glazed eye moved not: the palpable form continued. Lord Glenarvon gazed till his eyes were strained with the effort, and every faculty wasbenqmbed and overpowered·.
Then fell a drowsiness over his senses which he could not conquer; and he ßaid to those who addressed him, " I am ill:—watch by me whilst 1 sleep/* He threw himself upon his cloak, listless and fatigued, and sunk into a heavy sleep. But his slumbers were broken and disturbed; and he could not recover from the unusual depression of his spirits. Every event of his short life crowded fast upon his memory :—scenes long for¬ gotten recurred :—he thought of broken vows, of liearts betrayed, and of all the perjuries and treacheries ofa life given up to love. But reproaches and bitterness saddened over every dear remembrance, and he participated, when too late, in the sufferings he had inflicted. All was now profoundly still : the third watch souuded. The lashing of the waves against the sides of the ship—the gentle undulating motion, again lulled a weary and perturbed spirit to repose. Suddenly upon the air he heard a fluttering, like
the noise of wings, which fanned him while he slept. Gazing intently, he fancied he beheld a fleeting shadow pass up and down before him, as if the air, thickening into substance, became visible to the eye, till it produced a form clothed in angelic beauty and unearthly bright¬ ness. It was some moments before he could bring to his remembrance whom it resembled,— tilla smile, all cheering, and a look of one he had seen in happier days, told him it was Calantha. Her hair flowed loosely on her shoulders, while a cloud of resplendent white sup¬ ported her in the air, and covered her partly from his view. Her eyes shone with serene lustre ; and her cheeks glowed with the freshness of health :— not as when impaired by sickness and disease, he had seen her last—not as when disappointment and the sorrows of the world had worn her youthful form- - but renovated, young, and bright, with superior glory she now met his ardent
gaze; and, in a voice more sweet than music, thus addressed him : ct Glenarvon," she said, " I come not to reproach you. It is Calan tha's spirit hovers round you. Away with dread; for I come to warn and to save you. Awake—arise, before it be too late. Let the memory of the past fade from before you : live to be all you still may be—a country's pride, a nation's glory ! Ah, sully not with ill deeds the bright promise ofa life of fame." As she spoke, a light as from heaven irradiated her counte¬ nance, and, pointing with hcr hand to the east, he saw the sun burst frora the clouds which had gathered round it, and shine forth inali its lustre. «« Are you happy?" cried Glenarvon, stretching out his arms to catch the vision, which hovered near.—■ «' Calantha, speak to me: am I still loved? Is Glenarvon dear even thus in death ?" The celestial ray which had lighted up the face of the angel, passed from before
it at these words; and he beheld the forr» of Calantha, pale and ghastly, as when last they had parted. In seeming answer to his question, she pressed her hands to her bosom in silence, and casting upon him a look so mournful that it pierced his heart, she faded from before his sight, dissolving like the silvery cloud into thin air. At that moment, as he looked around, the bright sun which bad risen with such glorious promise, was seen to sink in mists of darkness, and with its setting ray, seemed to tell him that his hour was come, that the light of his ge¬ nius was darkened, that the splendour ofhis promise was set for ever: but he met the awful warning without fear. And now again he slept ; and it seem¬ ed to him that he was wandering in a smooth vale, far from the haunts of men. The place was familiar to his memory :— it was such as he had often seen amidst the green plains ofhis native country, in the beautiful season of spring; and ever
and anon upon his ear he heard the church-bell sounding from afar off, while the breeze, lately risen, rustled among the new leaves and long grass. Fear even touched a heart that never yet had known its power. The shadows varied on the plain before him, and threw a me¬ lancholy «loom on the surrounding pros¬ pect. Again the church-bell tolled ; but it was not the merry sound of some vil¬ lage festival, nor yet tbe more sober bell that calls the passenger to prayer. No, it was that long and pausing knell, which» as it strikes the saddened ear, tells of some fellow-creature's eternal departure from this lower world ; and ever while it tolled, the dreary cry of woe lengthened upon the breeze, mourning a spirit fled, Glenarvon thought he. heard a step slowly stealing towards him ; he even felt the breath of some one near; and raising his eye in haste, he perceived the thin form of a woman close beside him. In ber arms she held a child, more wan than VOL. III. V
herself. At her approach, a sudden chill seemed to freeze the life-blood in his heart. He gazed again. " Is it Calantha?" lie said. " Ah, no ! it was the form of Alice/' She appeared as one returned from the grave, to which long mourning and untimely woes had brought her.—- " Clarence," she said in a piercing voice, " since 30U have abandoned me I have known many sorrows. The God of Mercy deal not with you as you have dealt with me !" She spoke no more ; but gazing in agony upon an infant which lay at her bosom, she looked up to Heaven, from whence her eyes slowly descended upon Glenarvon. She then approached, and taking the babe from her breast, laid it cold and lifekss 011 his heart. It was the chill of death which he felt—when, uttering a deep groan, he started up with affright* The drops stood upon his forehead— his hands shook—he looked round him*
but no image like the one he had beheld was near. The whiteness of the eastern sky foretold the approach of day. The noise and bustle in the ship, tbe signals of the boatswain, and the busy din around, told him that he had slept enough*. The Dutch squadron now appeared at a distance upon the sea: every thing was ready for attack. That day Lord Glenarvon fought with more than his usual bravery. He was the soul and spirit which actuated and moved every other. At twelve the en¬ gagement became general, every ship coming into action with its opponent. It was about four in the afternoon, when the victory was clearly decided in favour ofthe British flag, The splendid success was obtained by unequalled courage, and heroic valour. The result it is not for me to tell. Many received the thanks of their brave commander on that day; many returned in triumph to the country, ν 9
and friends who proudly awaited them. The Emerald frigate, and its gallant cap¬ tain, prepared likewise to return ; but Glenarvon, after the action, was taken ill. He desired to be carried upon deck ; and, placing his hand upon his head, while his eyes were fixed, he enquired of those around if they did not hear a sig¬ nal of distress, as if from the open sea. He then ordered the frigate to approach the spot whence the guns vvere fired. A fresh breeze had arisen : the Emerald sailed before the wind. To his disturbed imagination the same solemn sound was repeated in the same direction —No sail appeared— still the 1 ght frigate pursued. * 4 V sions of death and horror persecute me/* # ried Glenarvon. " What now do I behold—a ship astern! It is singular. Do others see the same, or am I doomed to be the sport of these absurd fan¬ cies? Is it that famed Dutch pirate, condemned through all eternity to sail
before the wind, which seamen view with terror, whose existence until this hour I discredited ?" lie asked this of his com¬ panions; but the smile vvith which Glen¬ arvon spoke these words, soon gave place to strong feelings of surprise and alarm.— Foreign was the make of that ship; sable were its sails; sable was the garb of its crew ; but ghastly white and motionless were the countenances of all. Upon the deck there stood a man of great height and size, habited in tbe apparel ofa friar. His cowl concealed his face; but his crossed hands and uplifted attitude an¬ nounced his profession. He was in prayer:—he prayed much, and earnestly —it was for the souls of his crew. Mi¬ nute guns were fired at every pause ; after which a slow solemn chaunt began ; and the smoke of incense ascended till it partially concealed the dark figures of the men. Glenarvon watched the motions ofthat vessel iu speechless horror; and now be* ρ 3
fore his wondering eyes new forms arose, as if created by delirium's power to aug¬ ment the strangeness of the scene. At the feet of the friar there knelt a form so beautiful—so young, that, but for the foreign garb and vvell remembered look, he had thought her like the vision of his sleep, a pitying angel sent to watch and save him.—" О Fiorabella, M he cried; " first, dearest, and sole object of my devoted love, why now appear to wake the sleeping dæmons in my breast—to madden me vvith many a bitter recollec¬ tion ?" The friar at that moment, with relentless hand, dashed the fair fragile being, yet clinging round him for mercy, into the deep dark waters. ' ; Monster," exclaimed Glenatvon, " 1 will revenge that deed even in thy blood." There was no need:—the monk drew slowly from his bosom the black covering that enshrouded his form. Horrible to be¬ hold '—that bosom was gored with deadly wounds, and the black spouting streams
of blood, fresh from the heart, uncolour- ed by the air, gushed into the wave. " Cursed be the murderer in his last hour!— Hell waits its victim."—Such was the chaunt which the sable crew ever and anon suns: in low solemn tones. Well was it understood by Glenarvon, though sung in a foreign dialect. " Com¬ rades," he exclaimed, 4< do you behold that vessel ? Am I waking, or do my eyes, distempered by some strange malady, deceive me? Bear on. It is the Jast command of Glenarvon. Set full the sails. Bear on,—bear on : to death or to victory ! —It is the enemy of our souls you see before you. Bear on- to death, to vengeance; for ail the fiends of hell have conspired our ruin/' They sailed from coast to coast—Thev sailed from sea to sea, tdl lost in the immensity of ocean· Gazing fixedly upon one object, ail mad¬ den ngw it h superstitious terror, Lord Glen¬ arvon tasted not of food or refreshment.
His brain was burning. Ilis eye, darting forward, lost not for one breathing mo¬ ment sight ofthat terrific vision. Madness to phrenzy came upon him. In vain his rvicnds, and'manv of the brave companions in his ship, held him strug¬ gling in their arms. He seized his op¬ portunity. " Bear on," he cried : " pur¬ sue, till death and vengeance—" and throwing himself from the helm, plunged headlong into the waters. They rescued bim ; but it was too late, ln the strug¬ gles of ebbing life, even as the spirit of flame rushed from the bands of mortality, visions of punishment and hell pursued him. Down, down, he seemed to sink with horrid precipitance from gulf to gulf, till immured in darkness; and as he closed his eyes in death, a voice, Joud and terrible, from beneath, thus seemed to address him : " Hardened and impenitent sinner ! the measure of your iniquity is full: the
price of crime has been paid : here shall your spirit dwell for ever, and for ever· You have dreamed away life's joyous hour, nor made atonement for error, nor denied vourself audit that the fair earth presented you. You did not controul the fiend in your bosom, or stifle him in his first growth : he now has mastered you, and brought you here : you did not bow the knee for mercy whilst time was given you : now mercy shall not be shewn. 0,cry upwards from these lower pits, to the friends and companions you have left, to the sinner vvho hardens him¬ self against his Creator—who basks in the ray of prosperous guilt, nor dreams that his hour bke your's is at hand. Tell him how terrible a thing is death; how fearful at such an hour is remembrance of the pa*t. Bid him repent, but he shall not hear you. Bid him amend, but like you he shall delay till it is too late. Then, neither his aits, nor talents, nor
his possessions, shall save him, nor friends, though leagued together more than ten thousand strong; for the axe of justice must fall. God is just; and the spirit of evil infatuates before he destroys/'
THE END.

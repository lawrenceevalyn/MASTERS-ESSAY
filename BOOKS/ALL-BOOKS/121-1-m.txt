The epicurean: a tale
THE EPICUREAN.
CHAPTER I It was m the fourth year of the reign of the late Emperor Valerian, that the fol¬ lowers of Epicurus, who were at that time numerous in Athens, proceeded to lue election ofa person to fill the vacant chair of their sect,—and, by the unanimous voice of the School, I was the individual chosen for their Chief I was just then enter¬ ing on my twenty-fourth year, and no instance had ever before occurred, of a person so young being selected for that office Youth, however, and the personal advantages that adorn it, were not, it may be supposed, among the least л ahd recom¬ mendations, to a sect that included within its circle all the beauty as well as wit of Athens, and which, though dignifying its в
pursuits with the name of philosophy, was l'ttle ebe than a pretext for the more refined cultivation of pleasure The character of the sect had, indeed, much changed, since the time of its wise and virtuouB founder, who, whilehe asserted that Pleasure is *he only Good, inculcated also that Good is the only source of Plea¬ sure. The purer part of this doctrine had long evaporated, and the tem perate Epici'nis would have as httle re¬ cognised hu« own sect in the assemblage tf refined voluptuaries who now usurped itb name, as he would have known his own qmet Garden m the luxunous groves and bowers among which the meetings of the School were now held Many causes, besides the attractiveness of its doctrines, concurred, at this penod, to render our school the most popular ot any that still survived the glory of Greece It may generally be observed, that the pre valence, m one half of a community, of very rigid notions on the subject of religion,
produces the opposite extreme of laxity and mfidebly m the other, and this kmd of re-action it was tbat now mainly con¬ tributed to render the doctrines of the Garden the most fashionable phdosophy of the day The rapid progress of the ( hnstian faith had alarmed all those, who, either from piety or worldhness, were in¬ terested in the continuance of the old established creed —all who believed in the Deities of Olympus, and all who hved by them The consequence was, a considerable increase of zeal and ac¬ tivity, throughout the constituted autho¬ rities and priesthood of tlie whole Heathen world What was wanting in sincerity of bebef was made up in rigour,—-the weak¬ est parts of the Mythology were those, of course, most angrily defended, and any reflections, tending to brmg Saturn, or his wife Орч, into contempt were punished with the utmost seventy of the law In this state of affairs, between the alarmed bigotry of the declining Faith, n 2
and the simple, subhme austenty of hci rival, it was not wonderful that those lovers of ease and pleasure, who had no interest, reversionary or otherwise, m tbe old re¬ ligion, and were too mdolent to enquire into the sanctions ofthe new, should take refuge from the seventies of both under the shelter of a luxurious phdosophy, which, leavmg to others the task of disputing about the future, centered all its wisdom in the full enjoyment ofthe present. The sectaries of the Garden had, ever smce the deatli of their founder, been •accustomed to dedicate to his memorj the twentieth day of every month To those monthly rites had, for some time been added a grand annual Festival, in commemoration of his buth The feast given on this occasion by my predecessor» m the Chair, had been invariably distin guished for their taste and splendour, and it was my ambition, not merely to imitate this example, but even to render the anni versary, now celebrated under my auspices,
so brilliant, as to efface the recollection of aU that went before it Seldom, indeed, had Athens witnessed such a scene The grounds that formed ine original site of the Garden had, from time to time, received considerable addi¬ tions , and the whole extent was laid out with that peifect taste, which knows how to wea Nan» *° to Art, without sacrificing her L-T"pucity to the alliance Walks, leading through wildernesses of shade ind fragrance—glades, openmg, ns if to afford α play-ground for the sunshine— temples, rising on the very spots where imagination herself would have called them up, and fountains and lakes, m alternate motion and repose, either wantonly court- mg the verdure, or calmly sleepmg in its embrace,—such was the vanety of fea¬ ture that diversified these fair gardens, and, animated as they were on this occasion, by all the living wit and lovehnebs of Athens, it afforded a scene such as my own youthful fancy, rich as it was then in в 3
images of luxury snd beauty, could hardly have anticipated Ine ceremonies of the day began with the very dawn, when, according to the form of simpler and bettei times, those among the disciples who had apartm_nts within the Garden, bore the image of our Founder in procession from chamber о chamber, chanting verses in praise of—what had long ceased to be objects of our imitation —his frugality and temperance Round a beautiful lake, m the centre of the garden, stood four white Doric temples, m one of which was collected α librar) containing all the flowers of Grecian literature, while, m the remaining three, Conversation, the Song, and the Dance, held, uninterrupted by each other, their respective rites. In the Library stood busts of all the most illustrious Kpi cureans, both of Kome and Greece— Horace, Atticus, Fhny the elder, the poet Lucretius, Lucian, and the biographer of the Phdosophers, lately lost to us Dio-
genes Laertius There were also the por¬ traits, in marble, of all the emment female votaries of the school — Leontium and her fair daughter Danae, Thenusta, Fhikems, and others It was here that, m my capacity of Heresiarch, on the morniiľc ofthe Festival, I received die felicitations of the day from some ofthe fairest lips of Athens, and, m pronouncmg the customary oration to the memory of our Master (m which it was usual to dwell on the doctrines he incul¬ cated) endeavoured to attain that art, so useful before s jch an audience, of diflus-ing over the gravest subjects a charm, which secures them listeners even among the simplest and nost volatile Though study, as may easdy be sup¬ posed, engrossed but httle of the morn ings of the Garden, yet the lighter part of learning,—that portion of its attic honey, for which the bee is not obliged to go very deep mto the flower—was zealously culti vated Even heie, however, the student в é
had to encounter distractions, which are, of all others, bas^iavourable to composure of thought, and, with more than one of my fair disciples, there used to occur uch scenes as the following, which a poet of the Garden, takmg his picture from the life, descnbed — " At o'er the lake, in evening?« glow, That temple threw its lengthening ihade Upon the marble ttepi below, There sate a fair Corinthian maid, Oracefullr o'er tome volume bending, While, by her ude, the youthful Sage Held back her rmgleti, lest, descending, They should o'er-ibadow all the page ' But it was for the evening of that day, that the richest of our luxuries were reserved Every part of the Garden was illuminated, with the most skilful variety ot lustre, whde over the Lake ofthe Temples were scattered wreaths of flowers, through which boats, filled with beautiiul children, floated, as through a liquid parterre Between two of these boats a perpetual combat was maintained,—their respectée
commanders, two blooming youths, being habited to represent Eros and Anteros, the former, the Celestial Love ofthe Platomsts, and thelatter, that more earthlyppint, which usurps the name of Love among tne Ерь cm ean » Throughout thc evening their conflict was carried on with various success, the timid distance at which Eros kept from his more hvely antagonist bemg his only safeguard agamst those darts of fire, with showers of which the other continually assailed him, but which, luckily falling bhoit of their mark upon the lake, only scorched the flowers upon which they fell, and were extinguished In another part of the gardens, on a wide verdant glade, lighted only by the moon, an imitation of the torch-race of the Panathenæa was performed, by young boys chosen for their fleetness, and arrayed with wings, like Cupids, while, not far off, a group of seven nymphs, with each a star on her forehead, represented the movements of the planetary choir, and embodied the n 5
dream of Pythagoras into real motion and song. At every turning ноте new enchantment broke upon the ear or eye. Sometimes, from the depth of a grove, from which a fountain at the same time issued, there came a strain of music, which, minglirg with the murmur of the water, seemed like the voice of the spirit that presided over its flow;—while sometimes the strain rose breathing from among flowers ; and, agmn, would appear to come suddenly from under ground, as if the foot had just touched some spring that set it in motion. It seems strange that I should now dwell upon these minute descriptions ; but every thing connected with that memorable night —even its long-repented follies—must for ever live sacredly in my memory. The festival concluded with a banquet, at which I, of course, presided ; and, feeling myself to be the ascendant spirit of the whole scene, gave life to all around me, and san my own happiness reflected in that of others.
CHAP II Th£ festival was over,— f be sounds of the song and dance had ceased, and I was now left .r those luxunous gardens, alone Though so ardent and active a votary of pleasure, I had, by nature, a disposition full of m C icholy, — an imagination tbat presented sad thoughts, even m the midst of mirth and happi¬ ness, and threw the shadow of the future over ti e gayest liusions of the present Melancholy was, mdeed, twin-born m my soul with Passion, and, not even m the fullest fervour of the latter, were they epaiated From the first moment that I was conscious of thought and feeling, the same dark thread had run acrosb the web, and images of death and anni hdation mingled themselves with the most smiling scenes through which my career of enjoyment led me My very passion for pleasure but deepened these gloomy в 6
fancies. For, shut out, as I was by my creed, from afuture life, and having no hope beyond the narrow horizon of this, every minute of delight assumed a mournful preciousness in my eyes, and pleasure, like the flower of the cemetery, grew but more luxuriant from the neighbourhood of death. This very night my triumph, my happi¬ ness had seemed complete. I had been the presiding genius of that voluptuous scene. 3οώ my ambition and my love of pleasure had drnnk deep of the cup ibr which they thirsted. Looked up to by the learned and loved by the beautiful and the young, I had seen, in every dye that met minf. either the acknowledgment ot triumph* already won, or the promise of others, sull br igh tei, that awaited me. Yet, even İn die midst of all this, the same dark thoughts had presentad the-nselves;—the periahableneM of myself and alt around me every instant recurred to my mind Tho»« hands I had prest— those eyes, in
which I had seen sparkling, a spirit of light and life that should never die—those voices, that had talked of eternal love— all, all, I felt, were but a mockery < f the moment, and would leave nothmg eternal but the silence of tbeir dust I Oh, were it not Гог th» sad von.e, Stealing amid our mirth tn tay, That all, in which w most rejoice, Ere night may be the «"arth-worm's prey ,— But for this bitter—only hie- Full aa the world ib bnmm d with bliss, And capable as feels my coul Of draining to its depth the whole ] shou d turn eirth to heaven, and b If bliss made gods, a deity ' buch wns the description I gavr ot my own feelmgs, m one of those wild, passion¬ ate songs, to which this feraient of my spirits, between mirth and melancholy, gave birth. Seldom had my heart more fully aban¬ doned itself to such vague sadness than >' the present morrent, when, at I ршхи
thoughtfully among the fading lights and flowers of the banquet, the echo of my own step was aU that sounded, where so many gay forms had lately been revel Img The moon was stdl up, the morn mg had not yet glimmered, and tbe calm glories of night still rested on all around Unconscious whither my pathway led, I wandered along, till I, at length, found myself beiore that fair statue of Venus, with which the chisel of Alcamenes had embellished our Garden,—tbat image of deified woman, the only idol to which I had ever bent the knee. Leaning against the pedestal, I raised my eyes to heaven, and fixing them sadly and intently on the ever-bnrnmg stars, as if I sought to read the mournful secret in their hght, asked, wherefore was it that Man alone must penso, whde they, less wonderful, 'ess glorious than he, lived on m light un changeable and for ever ! — " Oh, that there were some spell, some talisman,' I 3xclamicd, *' to make the spirit within us
deathless as those stars, and open to its desires a career like theirs, bummg and boundless throughout all time ' " Whde I gave myself up to this tram ot thought, that lassitude which earthly plea¬ sure, however sweet, leaves behmd,—as if to show how earthly it is, — came drowsily over me, and I sunk at the base ofthe statue to sleep Even in sleep, however, my fancy was still busy«, and a dream, so vivid as to leave behmd it the impression of realít}, thus passed through my mind I thought myself transported to a wide desert plam, where nothmg seemed to breathe, or move, or hve The very sky above it looked pale and extinct, givmg the idea, not of dark¬ ness, but of light that had died, and, had that region been the remains of some oldei world, kft broken υρ and sunless, it could not have looked more dead and desolate The only thing that bespoke ufe, m thib melancholy waste, was a small moving spark, that «tt first glimmered ш the dis-
tance, but, at length, slowly approached the spot where I stood. As it drew nearer, I could peieeive that its feeble gleam was from a taper m the band of a pale venerable man, who now stood, like a messenger from the grave, before me After a few moments of awful silence, durmg which he looked at me with a sad¬ ness that thrilled my very soul, he said, — " Thou, who seekest eternal «Ufe, go unto the shores of the dark Nde — go unto the shores of the dark Nile, and thou wdt find the eternal life thou seekest ' " No sooner had he said these words than the death-like hue of his cheek brightened mto a smde of more tban human promise The bniall torch that he held sent forth a radiance, by which suddenly the whole surface of the desert was illuminated, even to the far horizon's edge, along whose line were now seen gardens, palaces, and spires, all bnght and golden, hke the architecture of the clouds at sunset Sweet music» too, was heard every where, floating
around, and, from all sides, such varieties of splendour poured, that with the exeess both of harmony and of light I woke That infidele should be superstitious is an anomaly neither unusual nor strange A bebef in supei human agency seems natural and necessaiy to the mmd, and, if not suffered to Pow m the obvious chan¬ nels, it will find a vent in some otliei Hence, many who have doubted the ex¬ istence of a God, have yet lujpbcitly placed themselves under the patronage of Fate or the stars Much the same inconsistency I was conscious of in my own feelings Though rejectmg all bebef m a Divine Pro¬ vidence, I had yet a faith in dreams, that all my philosophy could not conquer Nor was experience wanting to confirm me in my delusion, for, by some of those acci¬ dental coincidences, which make the for¬ tune of soothsayers and prophets, dreams, more than once, bad been to me Oraclei, truer far than oak, Or dove, or tripod, ever ipoke.
Il was not wonderful, therefore, that the vision of that night, touching, as it did, л chord sq ready to vibrate, should have aifected rae with more than ordinary power, and sunk deeper into my memory with every effort I made to forget it In vain did I mock at my own weakness ;—such seJMeriiion is seldom sincere. In vain did I pursue my accustomed pleasures. Their ant was, as usual, for ever new; but still came the saddening consciousness of mortality, and, with it, the recollection of this visionary promise, to which my fancy, in defiance of my reason, still clung. Stmictimea indulging in reveries, that were little elee than a continuation of my dream, I even contemplated the possible existence of some secret, by which youth nufht be, if not perpetuated, at least pro¬ long id, and that dreadful vicinity of death, within whose circle love pines and pleasure sickens, might be fer a while averted. " Who knows," I would ask, " but that in Ifypt, that landof wonders,where Mystery
hath yet unfolded but half her treasures, —where so many da. к secrets of the ante¬ diluvian world still remam, undeciphered. upon the pillars of Seth —who knows but some charm, some amulet, may he hid, whose discovery, as this phantom hath promised, but waits my coming—some compound of the same pure atoms, thftt scmtillate m the eternal stars, and whose infusion into the frame of man might make him, too, fadeless and immortal t " Thus did I fondly speculate, m those rambling moods, when tlie hfe of excite¬ ment which I led, acting upon a warm heart and vivid fancy, produced an intoxi¬ cation of spirit, durmg which I was not wholly myself This bewdderment, too, was not a httle mcreased by the constant struggle between my own natural feeling», and the cold, mortal creed of my sect, m endeavourmg to escape from whose dead¬ ening bondage I but broke loose into the realms of romance and fantasy. Even, however, m my calmest and so¬ berest moments, that strange vision per-
petuatly haunted me In vam were all ray efforts to chase it fiom my mmd, and the deliberate conclusion to which L came atlast «as, thft without, at least a visit to Egypt I could not rest nor, till convinced of my folly by disappomtment be reason¬ able I, therefore, announced without delay to my associates ofthe Garden, the intention which I had fonned to pay a visit to the land of Pyramids. To none of them d'd I dare to confess the «ague, м sumary impulse that actuated me Know ledge was the object that I alleged, while Pleasure was that for which they gave me credit The interests of the School, it was apprehended, would suffer by my absence and there were some tenderer ties, which had stdl more to feai from separation But Ibr the former inconvenience a temporary remedy was provided, whde the latter a skilful distnbuCon of vows and sighs alle¬ viated. Bemg furnished with recommend atory le**srs to all parts of Egypt m the summer of the year 257, A J) I set sail fur Alexandru«.
CHAP Ш To one, who extracted such sweets from every moment on land, a sea-voysge, how¬ ever smooth and favourable, appeared the least agreeable mode of losing time that could be devised. Often did my imagin¬ ation, ш passing some isle of those seas, people it with fair forms and kmd hearts, to whom most willingly, if I might, would I have paused to pay homage But the wind blew direct towards the land of Mystery and, still more, I heard α voice within me, whispering for e\er "On *' As we approached the coast of Egypt, our course became less prosperous, and we had a specimen of the benevolence oí the divinities of the Nde, in the shape of a storm, or rather whirlwind, which had nearly sunk our vessel, and which, the Egyptians on board said, was the work of their God, Typhon After a day aad night
of danger, during which we were driven out of out course to the eastward, some benigner influence prevailed above ; and, nt length, as the morning freshly broke, we saw the beautiful city of Alexandria rismg from the sen, with its Palace of Kings, its portico of four hundred columns, »nd the fior Pillar of Pillars, towering up to heaven in tne midst After passing in review this splendid vision; we shot rapidly round the Rock of Pharos, and, in a few minutes, found our¬ selves in the harbour of Eunostus. Thc sun had risen, but the light on the Great Tower ofthe Rock was still burning ; and there was a languor in the first waking movements of that voluptuous ctty—whoso houses and temples lay shining in silence round the harbour—that sufficiently at¬ tested the tèrtìvities of the preceding night. We were soon landed on the quay ; and, m I walked, through a line of palaces and shrines, up the street which leads from the sea to tbe Gate of Canopus, fresh as T was
from the contemplation of my own lovely Athens, I felt a glow of admiration at the scene around me, which its novelty, even more than its magnificence, inspired Nor were the luxuries and delights, which such a city promised, among the least of the considerations on which my fancy, at that moment, dwelt On the contrary, every thing around seemed prophetic of future pleasure The very forms of the archi lecture, to my Epicurean imagination, ap peared to call up images of living grace and even the dim seclusion of the templtj and groves spoke only of tender mysteries to my mmd As the whole bright scene grew animated around me, I felt tbat though Egypt might not enable me to lengthen life, she could teach the next best irt, —that of multiplying its enjoyments The population of Alexandria, at this period, consisted of the most motley mis cellany of nabons, religions, and sects, that had ever been brought together m one city Beside the school of the Grecian
Platonut was seen the oratory of the cabahstic Jew, while the church of the Christian stood, undisturbed, over the crypts of the Egyptian Hierophant. Here, the adorer of Fire, from the east, laughed st the superstition of the worshipper of cats, from the west Here Christianity, too, unluckily had learned to emulate the vagaries of Paganism, and whde, on one side, her Ophite professor was seen kneeling down gravely before his ser¬ pent, on the other, a Nicosián was, as gravely, contending that there was no chance of salvation out of the pale of the Greek alphabet Still worse, the unchan tableness of Christian schism was already distinguishing itself with equal vigour, and I heard of nothmg, on my arnval, but t'ıe raitwir and hate, with which the Greek and Latin churchmen persecuted each other, because, forsooth, the one fàsted on the seventh day of the week, and the others fasted upon the fourth and sixth !
To none of those religione or sects, how ever, except for purposes of ridicule, uid I pay much attention I was new m the most luxunous city of the universe, and gave way, without reserve, to the seduc tions that surrounded me My reputation as a phuosopher and α man of pleasure had preceded me and Alexandna, die second Athens of the world, welcomed me as her own My celebrity, indeed, wa* as a talisman, that opened hearts and doors at my approach The usual noviciate of acquaintance was dispensed with in my favour, and not only intimacies, but loves and friendships, ripened In my path, as rapidly as vegetation spnngs up where the Nile has flowed The dark beauty of tlie Egyptian wi men had a novelty in my eyes that enhanced its other chañas , and that hue of the sun on their rounded cheeks was but an earnest of the ardour he had kindled m their hearts— Th imbrowmag of the fruit, that tell· How neh within the uul of sweetntm dwelli С
Some weeks rolled on m such perpetual and ever-changing pleasures, that even the melancholy voice ш my heart, though it still spokt, was but seldom hstened to, and soon died away m the sound of the siren songs that surrounded me At length, however, as the novelty of these scenes wore off, the same gloomy bodings began to mingle with all my joys, and an mcident that occurred, dunng one of my gayest revels, conduced still more to deepen their gloom. Ihe celebration of the annual festival of «Serapis took place during my stay, and I was, more than once, induced to mingle with the gay multitudes, that crowded to his shrine at Canopus on the occasion Day and mght, whde this festival lasted, the canal, which led from Alexandria to Canopus, was covered with boats full of pilgrims of both sexes, all hastening to avail themselves of this pious hcence, which lent the zest of a religious sanction to pleasure, and gave · holiday to the passions of earth, in honour of heaven.
I was returning, one lovely night, to Alexandria. The north wind, that wel¬ come visitor, freshened the air, whde tfae banks, on either side, sent forth, from groves of orange and henna, the most delicious odours As I had left all the crowd behind me at Canopus, there was not a boat to be seen on the canal but my own, and I was just yielding to the thoughts which sohtude at such an hour inspires, when my revenes were broken by the sound of some female voices, coming, mingled with laughter and screams, from the garden of a pavibon, that stood, brd- liantly illuminated, upon the bank of the canal On rowmg nearer, I perceived that both the mirth and the alarm had been caused by the efibrtsof some playful girls to -each a hedge of jasmin which grew near the water, and in bending towards which they had nearly fallen mto the stream Hasten¬ ing to proffer my assistance, I soon recog¬ nised the voice of one of my nur Alexandrian с 2
fnends, and, springing on the bank, was surrounded by the whole group, who m sieted ón my joining their party ш the pavilion, and flinging the tendrils of jas¬ min, which they had just plucked, around me, led me, no unwilling captive, to the banquet-room I found here an assemblage of the very flower of Alexandria, society The unex¬ pectedness of the meeting gave it an addi¬ tional zest on both sides, and seldom had I felt moi4 enlivened myself, or contn¬ buted more successfully to circulate life among others Among the company were some Greek women, who, according to the fashion of their country, wore veils, but, as usual, rather to set off than conceal their beauty, some gleams of which were continually escaping from under the cloud There was, however, one female, who particularly attracted my attention, on whose head was a chaplet of dark-coloured flowers, and who sat veiled and silent dunng the whole
of the banquet. She took no share, I ob¬ served, ш what was passing around the viands and the wine went by her untouched, nor did a word that was spoken seem addressed to her ear This abstraction from α scene so sparklmg with gaiety, though apparently unnoticed by any one but myself, struck me as mysterious and strange I inquired of my feir neighbour the cause of it, but she looked grave and was silent In the mein time, the lyre and the cup nt round, and a young maid from Athens, as if inspired by the presence ofher coun¬ tryman, took her lute, and sung to it some of the songs of Greece, with a feeling that bore me back to the banks ofthe IIissus, and, even m the bosom of present plea¬ sure, drew a sigh fiom my heart for tbat which had passed away It was daybreak ere our delighted party rose, and unwill¬ ingly re-embarked to return to the aty Scarcely were we afloat, when it was discovered that the lute of the young L 3
Athenian had been left behind, and, with my heart still foil of its sweet sounds, I most readdy sprung on shore to seek it. I hastened to the banquet-room, which was nov dun and sohtary, except tbat—there, to my astonishment, stdl sat that silent figure, which had awakened my cunosity so strongly dunng the night A vague feel¬ ing of awe came over me, as I now slowly approached it. There was no motion, no sound of breathing m that form, — not a leaf of the dark chaplet on its brow stirred By the light of a dying lamp which stood before the figure, I raised, with a hesitating hand, the veil, and saw— what my fancy had alreadv anticipated — that the shape underneath was lifeless, was a skeleton 1 Startled and shocked, I hur¬ ned back with the lute to the boat, and waa almost as sdent as that shape for the remainder ofthe voyage Hue custom among the Egyptians of pbcing a mummy, or skeleton, at the baaquetrtable» had been for some time disused, except at particular ceremonies,
and, even on such occasions, it had been ♦he practice of the luxurious Alexandrians to disguise this memorial of mortality in the manner just described Eut to me, wbo was wholly unprepared foi such a spec tacle, it gave a shock from which my imagination did not speedily recover This sdent and ghasüy witness of mirth seemed to embody, as it were, the ¡hadow in my own heart The features o f the grave were now stamped on the iden that haunted me, and this picture of wh it I voas to be mmgled itself with the sunniest aspect of what I teas The memory of the dream now recurred to me more livehly than ever The bright assuring smJe of that venerable Spint, and his words, " Go to the shores of the dark Nile, and thou wilt find the eternal life thou seekest,* werefci e ?er before my mind But as yet alas, I had done nothmg towards realising this splendid promise Alexandria was not Egypt, —the very soil on which it stood was not in existence, с 4
when Thebes and Memphis already count¬ ed ages of glory. " It is beaeath the fyramids of Mem¬ phis," I exclaimed, " or m the mystic Halls ofthe Labyrinth, that I must seek those holy arcana of science, of which the ante¬ diluvian world has made Egypt its heir, and among which—blest thought!—the key to eternal life may lie." Having formed my determination, I took leave of my many Alexandrian friends, and departed fer Memphis.
CHAP IV Egypt was the country, of all others, from that mixture of the melancholy and the voluptuous, which marked the charac¬ ter of her people, her religion, and her scenery, to affect deeply а temperament and fancy hke mine, and keep tremblingly alive the sensibilities of both. Wherever I turned, I saw the desert and the garden, mingling their bloom and desolation to¬ gethei I saw the love-bower and the tomb standing side by side, and pleasure and death keeping hourly watch upon each other In the very luxury of the climate there was the same saddening influence The monotonous s ťendour of the days, the solemn radiance of the nights — all tended to chensh that ardent melancholy, the offspring of passion and of thought, which hod so long been the inmate of my soul с 5
When I bailed ftom Alexandria, the m- nundation ofthe Nile was at its full. Tlie whole valley of Egypt lay covered by its flood; and, as I saw around me, in the hght of the setting sun, shrines, palacts, and monuments, encircled by the waters, i Could almost iancy that I beheld the sink¬ ing island of Atalantis, on the last evening bl temples were visible above the wave Soch vanebes, too, of anunation as pre¬ sented themselves on every side !— While, far aa sight can reach, beneath as clear Aad blue a heaven as ever bless'd this sphere, Ckrdtxa, aad piUar'd street*, and porphyry domes, Aad high-built templet, fit to be the homes Or mighty gods, and pyramids, whose hour OutbuU all tune, above the waters tower > Then, too, the scenes of pomp and joy, that make One theatre of thu vest, peopled lake, Where all that Lore, Religion, Commerce gives Of bte and motion, ever moves and lives Here, up the steps of templet, from tbe wave Asceudiag, in procession slow and grave, Pnests, ш white garments, go, with «tscred wwdi And silver cymbals gleaming in their hands
While, there, rich barks—freeb from those iimny Far off, beyond the sounding cataracts— Glide with their precioui lading to the sea, Plumes of bright birda, rhinoceros' ivory. Gems from the ule of Meroe, and those grams Of gold, wish'd down by «Abyssinian rams Here, where the waters wind into a bay Shadowy and cool, some pilgrims, on their way To Sais or Bubaitus, among beds Of lotus flowers, that close above tdar heads, Push their light barks, and hid, ая in a bower, Smg, talk, or sleep away the sultry hour, While haply, not far off, beneath a bank Of blossoming acacias, many α prank Is play'd ir the cool current by a train Of laughing nymphs, lovely as she, whose chain Around two conquerors ofthe world was cast, Hut, tor a third loo feeble, broke at last ! Enchanted with the whole scene, I lin¬ gered on my voyage, visiting all those lux¬ urious and venerable places, whose names have been consecrated by the wonder of ages. Àt Sais I was present dunng her Festival of Lamps, and read, by the blaze of innumerable lights, those sublime words с 6
on the temple of Neitha : " I am all that has been, that is, and that will be, and no man hath ever lifted my veil." I wandered among the prostrate obelisks of Heliopolis, and saw, not without a sigh, the sun smiling over her ruins, as if in mockery of the mass of perishable grandeur, that had once called itself, in its pride, « The City ofthe Sun." But to the Ые of the Golden Venus was my fondest pilgrimage; — and as I ex¬ plored its shades, where bowers are the only temples, I felt how fer more fit to form the shrine of a Deity are the ever-living stems of the garden and the grove, than the most precious columns that the inani¬ mate quarry can supoly. Every where new pleasures, new inter ests awaited me ; and though Melancholy, ae usual, stood always near, her shadow fell but half-way over my vagrant path, and left the rest more welcomely brilliant from the contrast. To relate щу various adventures, during this short voyage, would only detain me from events, far, far more
worthy of record Amidst such endless va¬ riety of attractions, the great object of my journey wa« forgotten,—the mj stenes of this land of the sun were, to me, as much mysteries as ever, and I had as yet been initiated m nothing but its pleasures It was not till that evening, when I first stood before the Pyramids of Memphis, and saw them towermg aloft, like the watch-towers of Time, from whose sum¬ mit when he expires, he will look his last — il was not till this moment that the great secret, of which I had dreamed, again rose, m all its inscrutable darkness, upon my thoughts There was a solem nity m the sunshine that rested upon those moniments— a stillness, as of reverence, in the air around them, that stole, like the music of past times, into my heart I thought what myriads of the wise, the beautiful, and the brave, had sunk inte* dust since earth first beheld those wonders, and, m the sadness of my soul, I exclaimed, — " Must man alone, then, pensh ? must
minds and hearts be annihilated, whde pyra¬ mids endure? Death, Death) even on these everlasting tablets,—the only approach to immortabty that kings themselves could purchase,—thou hast written our doom, saj mg, awfully and intelbgibly, ' There is, for man, no eternal mansion, but the tomb!'" My heart sunk at the thought, and, for the moment I yielded to that desolate feeling, which overspreads the soul that hath no light from фе future But agam the buoyancy of my nature prevailed, and again, the willing dupe of vain dreams, I de Inded myself mto *he belief of all that I most wished, with that happy faculty which makes imagination stand in place of happmess " Yes," I cried, " immor¬ tabty must be withm man's reach, and, as wisdom alone is worthy of such a blessing, tip the wise alone must the secret have been revealed Deep, it is said, undei yonder pyramid, has for ages lam con¬ cealed the Table of Emerald, on which
the Thrice-Great Hermes engraved, be¬ fore the flood, the secret of Alchemy, that gives gold at will. Why may not the mightier, the more god-like secret, that gives life at will, be recorded there also ? It was by the power of gold, of endless go'd, that the kings, who repose m those massy structures, scooped earth to the centre, and raised quarries mto the air, to provide themselves with tombs that might outstand the world Who can tell but that the gift of immortality was also theirs? who knows but that they themselves, tri¬ umphant ovtr decay, still hve—those man¬ sions, which we call tombs, bemg neh and everlasting palaces, within whose depths, concealed from this withering worltl, they still wander, with the few who are sharers of their gift, through a sunless, but dlu- minated, elysium of their own? Else, wherefore those structures ? wherefore that subterraneous realm, by which the whole valley of Egypt ts undermined? Why, else, those labyrmths, which none
of earth hath ever beheld —which none of heaven, except that God, with the finger on his hushed lip, hath trodden !" While I indulged ω these dreams, the sun, half sunk beneath the horizon, was taking, calmly and glonously, his leave of the Pyramids,—as he had done, evening after evenmg, Ibr ages, üli they had become umiliar to hun as the earth itself. On the side turned to his ray they now presented a front of dazzling whiteness, while, on the other, their great shadows, lengthen rag to the eastward, looked like the first steps of Night hastening to envelope the hiUs of Araby ш her shade No sooner had the last gleam of the sun disappeared, than, on every house-top in Memphis, gay, gilded banners were seen waving aloft, to proclaim his setting,— while a full burst of harmony pealed from all the temples along the shores Startled from my musing by tbese sounds, I at once recollected, that, on that very evenmg, the great festival ofthe Moon
was to be celebrated On a httle island, half-way over between the gardens of Memphis and the eastern shore, stood the temple of that goddess, Whole beams Bnng the tweet On» of night-flower· and dreamt Not tbe cold Sun ofthe North, wbo chum Jn veital ке tbe current of young vein·) But «be, who haunt· tbe gay, Bubastaan grove. Ami owns abe teet, from her bnght heaVn above, Nothmg on earth, tc match that besťn, but love I Thus did I exclaim, in the words of ou** of their own Egypter, poets, as, anticipating the various delights of the festival, I cast away from my mind all gloomy thoughts, and, hastening to my httle bark, m which I now lived, like a Nile-bird, on the waters, steered my course to the island-temple of the Moon,
CHAP V Тн£ rismg of the Moon, slow and majestic, as if consuous ofthehonoursthat awaited her upon earth, was welcomed with a loud acclaim from every eminence, where mul¬ titudes stood watching for her first light. And seldom had she risen upon a scene more beautiful Memphis,—stdl grand, though no longer the unrivalled Memphis, that had borne away from Thebes the crown of supremacy, and worn it undis puted through ao many centuries,—now, softened by the moonlight that harmonised whh her decime, shone forth among her lakes, her pyramids, and her shrines, like a dream of glory that was soon to pass away Rum, even now, was but too visible aroundher. The sands of the Libyan desert gained upon her hke a sea and, among solitary columns and sphmxes, all °ady half sunk from sight, Time seemed tc stand
waiting, till all, that now flourished around, should fall beneath his desolating hand« like the rest On the waters all was life and gaiety As far as eye could reach, the bghts of in¬ numerable boats were seen, studding, bke rubies, the surface of the stream Vessels of all lunds, —from the light coracle, built for shooting down the cataracts, to the large yacht that glides to the sound of flutes, — all were afloat for thu sacred festival, filled with crowds of the young and the gay, not only from Memphis and Babylon, but from cities still farther removed from the scene As I approached the island, I could see, glittering through the ixees on the bank, die lamps of tbe pügnms hastening to the ceremony Landing m the direction which those bghts pointed out Ι κ*" 1 coined the crowd, and, pasting through a long alley of sphinxes, whose spangling marble shone out from the dark sycamores around them, in a short time reached
the grand vestibule of the temple, where I finind the ceremonios of he evening already commenced. In this vast hall, which was surrounded by a double range of columns, and lay open over-head to the stars of heaven, I sew a gr'jup of young maidens, moving in a aort of measured step, between walk and dance, round » amali shrine, upon which stood one of those sacred birds, that, on aceount of the variegated colour of their wings, are dedicated to the moon. The vestibule waa dimly lighted, —there being but one lamp of naphtha on each of the great pillar· that encircled it But, having taken my station beside one с" those pillars, I had * «Unmet view of the young dan¬ cers, as in succession they passed me. Tbeir long, graceful drapery wu as white as mow ; and each won loosely, beneath the rounded bosom, a dark-blue »one, or bandelet, studded, Uke the skies at mid¬ night, with little silver stars. Through their dark lock· waa wreathed the white
Шу of the Ше, —that flower bemg ac counted as welcome to the moon, as the golden blossoms of the bean flower are to the sun As they passed under the lamp, a gleam of light flashed from their bosoms, which, I could perceive, was the reflection of a small mirror, that in the mara-r of the women of the East each wore beneath her left shoulder There was no music to regulate their steps, but Rs they gracefully went round the bird on the shnne, some, by the beat of the castanet, some, by the shnll nng of the sistrum, —which they held up lifted ш the attitude of their own divine Isis, —harmoniously timed the cadence of their feet, while others, at every step, shook a small cham of silver, whose sound, mingling with those of the castanets and sistrums, produced a wdd, but not an un pleasing harmony They seemed all lovely, but there was one — whose hice the light had not yet reached, so downcast she held it, — who
attracted, and, at length, riveted all my attention I knew not why, but there was a something in those half-seen features,— a charm m the тегу shadow, that hung orer their imagined beanty,—which took me more than all the outshining love¬ nne«* of her companions. So enchained was my fancy by this coy mystery, that her alone, of all the group, could I either вее or thmk of— her alone I watched, as, with the same downcast brow, she glided round the altar, gently and aenatly, as if her présence, bke that of a spirit, was something to be felt, not seen Soddenly, while I gazed, the loud crash of a thousand cymbals was heard, — th«. massy gates of the Temple flew open, as If by magic, and a flood of radiance irom the illuminated aule filled the whole vesti bule, while, at the same instant, as ď the light and the sounds were born togetUr, • peal of rich harmony came mingling with the radiance. It was then,—by that light, which shone
full upon the yonng maiden's features, as, stt 'img at the blaze, she raised her eyes to the portal, and, as suddenly, let fidi their lids agam, —it was then I beheld, what even my own ardent imagination, in its most vivid dreams of beauty, had never pic¬ tured Not Psyche herself, when pausing on the threshold of heaven, while its first glones fell on her dazzled lids, could have looked more beautiful, or blushed with α more mnocent shame Often as I had felt the power of looks, none had ever entered mto my soul so far It was a new feebng — a new sense — commg as sud¬ denly as that radiance into the vestibule, and, at once, filling my whole being, —and had that vision but lingered another mo¬ ment before my eyes, I should have wholly forgotten who I was and where, and thrown myseit ш prostrate adoration, at her fiset But scarcely had that gush of harmony been heard, when the sacred bird, which had, till now, stood motionless as an image, expanded his wmg·, and flew into the Tem-
pie, while hia graceful young worshippers, with a fleetness hke his own, followed, — and she, who had left a dream in my heart never to be forgotten, vanished with the rest. As she went rapidly past the pillar agamst which I leaned, the ivy that encucled it caught ш her drapery, and disengaged some ornament which fell to the ground It was the small mirror which I bad seen shining on her bosom Hastily and tremulously I picked it up, and hurned to restore it, — but she was already lost to my eyes ш the crowd In vam I tried to follow, — the aisles were already filled, and numbers of eager pilgrims pressed towards the portal But the servanta of the Temple prevented all further entrance, and still, as I presented myseit their white wands barred the way Perplexed and irritated amid that crowd of Iacea, regarding all as ene mies that impeded my progress, I stood on tiptoe, gaung into the busy aisles, and witb a heart beating as I caught, from
time to time, a glimpse of some spangled zone, or lotus wreath, which led me to fancy that I had discovered the object of my search But it was all in vain,— m every direction, files of sacred nymphs were moving, but m where could I see her, whom alone I sought. In this btate uf breathless agitation did I stand for some time,—bewddered with the confusion of races and lights, as well as with the clouds of incense tliat rolled «iround me,—till, fevered and impatient, I could endure it no longer Forcing my way out of the vestibule mto the cool air, I hurried back through the alley of sphinxes to the shore, and flung myself into my boat There is, to the north of Memphis, a solitary lake (which, at this season ofthe year, mingles with the rest of the waters,) upon whose shores stands the Necropolis, or City ofthe Dead—- a place of melancholy grandeur,covered over with shrines and py¬ ramids, where many a kingly head, proud n
eren ш death, has for ages awaited the raaurrection of its glories. Through a range of rjepulchral grots underneath, the hum¬ bler denizens of the tomb are deposited, — kloking oiit on each successive generation that visits them, with the same face and features they wore centuries ago Ever) plant and tree, that is consecrated to death, firam the asphodel-flower to the mystic plantam, .tonda its sweetness or shadow to thu place of tombs ; and the only noist that disturbs its eternal calm, is the Ion hvmming sound of the pnests at prayer, when a new inhabitant is added to the sdent city. It was towards this place of death that, m a mood of mmd, as usual, half bnght half gloomy, I now, almost unconsciously, directed my bark. The form of the young Priestess wae continually before me That one bright look of hers, tfie very memory of which was worth all the actual simles of others, never left my mind. Absorbed in such thoughts, I rowed on, scarce knowing
whither I went, till, startled by finding myself withm the shadow of the City of the Dead, Γ looked up, and saw, nsmg in succession before me, pyramid beyond py¬ ramid, each towering more loftily than the other,—while all were out-topped m grandeur by one, upon whose summit the moon seemed to rest, ns on a pedestal Drawing near to the shore, which was suf¬ ficiently elevated to raise this city of monu¬ ments above the level of the inundation, I bfted my oar, and let the boat rock idly on the water, while my thoughts, left equally without direction, fluctuated as idly How vanous and vague were the dreams that then passed through my mmd—tbat bright vision of the temple mirigbng itself with all ! Sometimes she stood before me, like an aenal spmt, as pure as if that element of music and bght, mto which I had seen her vanish, was her only dwell¬ ing (Sometimes, animated with passion, and kindlmg into a creature of earth, she seemed to lean towaids me with looks of η г
tenderne», which it were worth worlds, but for one instant to inspire, and agam — as the dark fancies, that ever haunted me, íecurred —I saw her cold, parched, and blackening, amid the gloom of those eternal sepulchres before me I Turning away, with a shudder, from the cemetery at this thought I heard tbe sound of an oar plying swiftly through the water, and, m a few moments, saw, shooting past me towards the shore, a snudi boat in wbicb sat two female figures, mufiled up and veiled Having landed them not far from the spot where I lay, — concealed by the shadow of a monu ment on the bank, — the boat again dc parted, with the same fleetness, over the flood. Never had the prospect of an adventure come more welcome than at this moment, when my fancy was weaving such chains for my heart as threatened a bondage, of all others, the most difficult to break To become eammoured thus ofa creature of
my own imagination, was the worst, be¬ cause the most lasting, of follies Reality alone gives a chance of dissolving such spelb, and the idol I was now creating to myself must for ever remain ideal Anv pursuit, therefore, that seemed likely to divert me from such thoughts — to bring back mv imagination to earth and reality, from the vague region in which it was wandering, was а relief too seasonable not to be welcomed with eagerness I had watched tlie course which the two figures took, and, having hastily fastened my boat to the bank, stepped gently on shore, and, at α little distance, foUowed tb_m The wind ngs through which they led wert intricate , but, by the bright light of the moon, t was enabled to keep their forms in view, ss, with, rapid step, they glided among the monuments At length, in the shade of α small pyramid, whose |№ak barely surmounted the plane trees that grew mgh, they vanished from my sight. I hastened to the spot, but there η 3
was not a sign of bfe around, and had my creed extended to another world, I might hà,ve fancied that these forms wpi с spirits, sent from, thence to mock me, —so instan¬ taneously they disappeared I searched through the neighbouring grove, but all there was stdl as death At length, m ex amimng one of the sides of the pyramid, which, fbr a few feet from the ground, was fumisbed with steps, I found, midway be¬ tween peak and base, a part of the surface, which, though presenting an appearance of smoothness to the eye, gave to the touch, I thought, indications ofa concealed opening After a variety of efforts and experi¬ ments, I, at last, more by accident than skill, pressed the spring that commanded this mystenous aperture In an mstant the portal slid aside, and disclosed a nar¬ row stair-way within, the two or three first steps of which were discernible by the moonlight, whde the rest were lost m utter darkness. Though it was difficult to con¬ ceive that the persons whom I had followed
would have ventured to pass through this gloomy opening, yet to account for their disappearance otherwise was süU more dif¬ ficult At all events, my curiosity was now too eager in the chase to relinquish it,— the spirit of adventure, once raised, Could not be so easdy laid. Accordmgly, havmg sent up a gay prayer to that bliss-loving Queen whose eye alone was upon me, I passed through the portal and descended mto the pyramid

CHAP. VI. Ат the bottom of the stair-way I fourni mjself m a low, narrow passage, through which, without stooping almost to earth, it was impossible to proceed Though leadmg through a multiplicity of dark wmdings, this way seemed but little to advance m) progress,—its course, I per¬ ceived, bemg chiefly cu cular, imd gather¬ ing, at every torn, but α deeper uitensity of darkness. " Can this," I thought, " be the bojoum of any thing human?"—and had scarcely asked myeelf the question, when the path opened into a long gallery, at the farthest end of which a gleam of light was visible This welcome glimmer appeared to come from some cell or alcove, m which the right-hand wall of the gallery terminated,
and, breathless with expectation, I stole gently towards it. Arrived at the end ofthe galler j,, a scene presented itself to my eyes, for which my fondest expectations of adventure tould not have prepared me The place from which the light proceeded was a small chapel, of whose interior, from the dark recess in which I stood, I had, unseen myself, a full and distinct view Over the walls of thib oratory were painted some of those vanous sjmbols, by which the mystic wibdom of the Egyptians loves to shadow out the History of the Soul — the winged globe with n serpent,—the rays descending from ubove, like a glory, and the Theban beetle, as he comes forth, after the waters have passed away, and the first bunbeam falls on his regenerated wings In the middle ofthe chapel ¡.tood а low altar of g>anite, on which lay а hfelesb female form, enshrined withm a case of crystal, — as they preserve their dead in Ethiopia,—and lookmg as freshly beautiful η δ
as if the soul had but a few hours departed Among the emblems oi death, On the fiont ofthe altar, were a slender lotus-branch, broken m two, and a bird, just winging its flight from the spray To these memorials of the dead, how¬ ever, I but httle attended, for there was a, living object there upon which my eyes were most intently fixed The lamp, by which the whole of the chapel was illuminated, was placed at the head of the pale image in ttie shrine, and, between its hght and me, stood a female form, bending over the monument, as if to gaze upon the sdent features within The position m which this figure was placed, ш terceptmg a strong bght, afforded me, at first, but an imperfect and shadowy view of it. Yet even at this mere outline my heart beat high,—and memory, as it proved, had as much share in this feebng as imagination For, on the bead changing its position, so as to let a gleam fidi on the features, I saw with a transport, which had almost
led me to betray my lurking-place, that it was she—the young worshipper of Isis — the same, the very samé, whom I had seen, brightening the holy place where she stood, and looking like an inhabitant of some purei world The movement by which she had now given me an opportunity of recognising her, was made ш raising from the shnne α small cross * of silver, which lay directly over the bosom of the lifeless figure Bringing it close to her lips, she kissed it with a religious fervour, then, turning her eyes mournfully upwards, held them fixed with an inspired earnestness, as if, at that moment m direct communion with heaven, they saw η ither ι oof, nor any other earthly barrier between tbem and the skies. What a power hath innocence, whose very helplessntss is its safeguard —· in whose presence even Passion himself * А сгон was, among the Egyptian·, the emblem of a future life. η 6
stands abashtd, and turns worshipper at the altar which he came to despoil She, who, but a short hour before, hod pie¬ sented herself to my imagination, as some¬ thing I could have risked immortality to wm — she, whom gladly, from the floor of her own lighted temple, m the very face of its proud ministers, I would have borne away m triumph, and defied all punish ments, both human and sacred, to make her mme, —she was now before me, thrown, as if by fate itself, into my powei —standing there» beautiful and alone, with nothing but her innocence for her guard! Yet, no—so touching was the purity of the whole scene, so calm and au¬ gust that protection which the dead seemed to extend over the living, that everj earthlier feebng was forgotten as I gazed, and love itself became exalted mto re- Entranced, mdeed, as I felt in witness¬ ing such a scene, thus to enjoy it by stealth, seemed a wrong, α sacrdege — and, rathei
than let her eyes meet the flash of mme, or disturb, by a whisper, that sacred silence, m wh ch Youth and Death held commu mon through Love, I would have let my heart break, without a murmur, where I stood Gently, as if life depended upon every movement, I stole away from that tranquil and holy scene — leaving it still tranquil and holy as I found it— and, gliding back through the same passageb and windings by which I had entered, regained the narrow stair-way, and again ascended into light The sun had just risen, and, fiom the summit of the Arabian lulls, uas pouring dou n his beams into that vast \ alley of waters,— as if proud of the homage that had been paid to his own bis, now fading away in the superior light of her Loid My first impulse was to fly from this dangerous spot, and in new loves and pleasures seek for¬ getfulness of the scene which I had wit¬ nessed " Once out of the circle of this
enchantment," I exclaimed, ' I know my own susceptibility to new impressions too well, to doubt that I shall soon break the spell that jü around me ' But vam were my efforts and resolves Eren whde I swore to By, my steps were still lingermg round the pyramid—my eyes stdl turned towards the secret portal, which severed this enchantress from the world of the living Hour after hour did I wander through that City of Silence, —tdl, already, it was noon, and, under the sun's meridian eye, the mighty pyramid of pyramids stood, like a great spirit, sha dowless Agara did those wdd and passionate feel¬ ings, which had, for a moment, been sub¬ dued into reverence by her presence, return to kindle up my imagination and senses 1 even reproached myself for the awe, tbat had held me spell-bound before her " What would my companions of the Garden say, did they know that their chief» — he, whose path Lo* e had strewed
with trophies — was now pining fbr a simple Egyptian girl, in whose presence he had not dared to give utterance to a sigh, atid who had vanquished the victor, without even knowmg her tnumph ■" A blush came over my cheek at the humiliating thought, and my determin¬ ation was fixed to await her coming That she should be an inmate of those gloomy caverns seemed inconceivable, nor did there appear to be any issue from their depths but by the pyramid Agam, therefore, like a sentinel of the dead, did I pace up and down among these tombs, contrasting, in many a mournful reflection, the burning fever within my own veins with the cold qu.et of those who slept around At length the fierce glow of the sun over niy head, and, still more, that ever restless agitation in my heart, were too much for even strength hke mme to bear Exhausted, I lay down at the base of the pyramid—placing myself directly
under the portal, where, even should slumber surprise ine, my heart, if not my ear, might still be on the watch, and her footstep, light aa it was, could not fail to awake me After many an ineffectual struggle against drowsiness, I at length sunk mto sleep— but not mto forgetfulness The same iraage still haunted me, m every variety of shape, with which imagination, assisted by memory, could investit NowJikeNeitha, upon her throne at Sais, she seemed to sit, with the veil just raised from that brow, which mortal had never, till then, beheld,— and now, hke the beautiful enchantrebs Khodope, I saw her rise out of tbe pyramid in which she had dwelt for ages, — Fair Rfaodope, bs ttory telb, fhe bnght, unearthly nymph, who dwell» Mid cLuleu golü and jewels hid, Tbe Lady of tbe Pyramid İ ' So long, amid that unbroken silence, did my sleep continue, that I found the
moon again sinning above the horizon, when I awoke AU around was sdent and lifeless as before, nor did а print upon the herbage betray that any foot had passed it since mj own Refreshed by rest, and with α fancy still more excited by die mystic wonders of which I had been dreaming, I now esolved to revisit the chapel in the pyramid, and put an end, if possible, to this illusion that haunted me Having learned from the expenence of the preceding night, tlie inconvenience of encountering those labyrinths without u light, I nowhabtened to provide myself with a lamp from my boat Tracking my way back with some difficulty to the shore, I there found, not only my lamp, but some dates and dried fruits, with а store of which, for my roving life upon the waters, I was always supplied, — and which now, after so many hour«, of abstinence, were a welcome and necessary relief Thus prepared, I again ascended the pyramid, and was proceeding to search
ont the secret spruig, when a loud, dutnal noise was heard at α distance, to which all the echoes of the cemetery answered. It came, I knew, from the Great Temple on the shore ofthe Lake, and was the shriek which its gates — tbe Gates of Oblmon, as they were called — sent forth from their hinges, ш opening at mght, to receive withm their precincts the newly-landed dead I had heard that sound before, and always witb sadness; but, at this moment, it thrilled through me, hke a voice of ill omen, and I almost doubted whether I should not abandon my enterprise The hesitation, however, was but momentary, —even while it passed through my nund, I had touched the spring of the portal In a few seconds more, I was again m the passage beneath the pyramid, ond being enabled by my lamp to follow the wmd¬ ings of the way more rapidly, soon found myself at the door of the small chapel in the gallery.
I entered, stdl awed, though there was now nothing living within The young Priestess had fled—had vanished, like a spirit, mto the darkness AU the rest was as I had left it on the preceding night. The lamp still stood bummg upon the crystal shrine—the cross lay where the hands of the young mourner had placed it, and the cold in dge beneath wore the same tranquil look, as if resigned to the solitude of death— of all lone tilings tbe loneliest. Remembering the lips that I had seen kiss that cross, and kindling with the recollection, I raised it passionately to my own,—but, at the same moment, I fancied the dead eyes met mine, and, saddened in the midst of my ardour, I re¬ placed the cross upon the shruie I had now lost all clue to the object of my pursuit, and was preparing slowly to retrace my steps to earth, with that gloomy satisfaction which certainty, even when unwelcome, brings,—when, as I held forth my lamp, on leaving the chapel, T
could percelve that the gallery, instead of terminating here, took a sudden bend to «he lefi, which had before eluded my eye, tnd which gave a promise of leadmg still farther mto those recesses. Re-animated jy this discovery, which opened a new source of hope to my heart, I cast but one hesitating look at my lamp, as if to ask whether it would be faithful through the gloom I was about to encounter, and, without further thought, rushed eager!} forward.
CHAP VII The path led, for some time, through the ьагле sort of narrow windings as thoae which I had encountered m descending the stair-way, and at length opened, in a similar manner, into a straight and steep gallery, along each side of which stood, closely ranged and upright s file of lifeless bodies, whose glassy eyes threw a preter¬ natural glare upon me as I passed Arrived at tbe end of this gallery, I found my hopes a second time vanish The path, I perceived, extended no fur¬ ther The only object that I could discern, by the ghmmenng of my lamp, which now, every minute, burned famter aud fainter, was the mourn of a huge well, that lay gaping before me—a reservoir of darkness, black and unfathomable. It now crossed my memory that I had heard of such welb, as being used occasionally for passages
by the Pnests. Leaning down, therefore, over the edge, 1 looked anxiously within, to discover whether it was possible to descend into the chasm, but the sides were bard and smooth as glass, bemg varmshed all over with that dark pitch, which the Bead Sea throws out on its slimy shore. After a more attentive scrutiny, how- aver, I observed, at the depth of a few feet, a sort of iron step, projecting dimlj from the side, and, below it, another, which, though hardly perceptible, was just suf¬ ficient to encourage an adventurous foot to the trial Though all hope of tracing the young Priestess was at an end,—it being impossible tbat female foot should have dared this descent, — yet, as I had so far engaged ш the adventure, and there was, at least, a mystery to be unravelled, I de¬ termined, at all hazards, to explore thc «baam Placing my lamp (which was Iiol- lovrad at the bottom, so as to fit lie a halmet) firmly on my bead, and having
thus both hanJs at hberty for exertion, I set my foot cautiously on the iron step, and descended mto the well. I found the same footing, at regular in¬ tervals, to a considerable depth ; and had already counted near a hundred of these steps, when the laddei altogether ceased, and I could descend no farther. In vain did I stretch down my foot in search of support —the hard, slippery sides were all that it encountered. At length, stoop¬ ing my head, so as to let the light fall below, I observed an openmg or wmdow directly above the step on which I stood, end, taking for granted that the way must he m that direction, with some httle diffi¬ culty clambered through the aperture. I now found myself on a rude and nar¬ row stair-way, the steps of which were cut out of the living rock, and wound spirally downward m the same direction as the well. Almost dizzy with the descent, which seemed as if it would never end, I, at last, reached the bottom, where a pair of massy
iron gatee closed directly across my path, as if to forbid any farther progress. Massy, however, and gigantic as they were, I (bund, tç my surprise, that the hand of an iniant might have opened them with ease—so readily did their great folds give way to my touch, N Light as s tjme.buib, that receive« Some viuuerhtg bird among its lenrei." No sooner, however, had I passed through, than the din, with which the gates clashed together again, was such as might have awakened death itself. It seemed a« if every echo, throughout that vast, subterranean world, from the Catacombs of Alexan¬ dria to Thebes'» Valley of Kings, had caught np and repeated the thundering sound. Startled, however, as I was, not even this supernatural clangour could divert my at¬ tention from the light that now broke upon me—soft, warm, and welcome as are the stars of hit own South to the mariner
who has been wandering through the seas of the north Lookmg for the source of this splendour, I saw, through an arch¬ way opposite, a long illuminated alley, stretching away as rar as the eye could reach, and fenced, on one side, with thickets of odoriferous shrubs, while, along the other, extended me of lofty arcades, from which t ıe light, that filled the whole area, issued As soon, too, as the din of the deep echoes had sub¬ sided, there stole gradually on my ear a strani of choral music, which appeared to come, mellowed and sweetened in its passage, through many a spacious hall withm those shining arcades Among tbe voices I could distinguish some female tones, towering high and clear over all the rest, iad forming the spire, as it were, into which the harmony tapered, as it rose So excited was my fancy by this sudden enchantment, that — though never had I caught a sound from the young Egyptian's
Ιιρβ,-^Ι yet persuaded myself that the voice I now heard was hers, sounding highest and most .heavenly of all that choir, and calung to me, like a distant spirit out of its sphere. Animated by this thought, I flew forward to the archway, but found, to my mortification, that it was guarded by a trellis work, whose bars, though invisible at a distance, resisted all my efforts to force them. While occupied in these ineffectual struggles, I perceived, to the left of the archway, a dark, cavernous openmg, which seemed to lead m a direction parallel to the lighted arcades. Notwithstanding roy impatience, however, the aspect of this pas- Satge, as I looked shuddenngly mto it, dulled my very blood. It waa not ao much dark¬ ness, as a sort of livid and ghasdy twilight, from which a damp, like that of death- vaults, exhaled, and through which, if щу eyes did not deceive me, pale, phan¬ tom-luce shapes were, at tbat very moment, hovering.
Lookmg anxiously round, to discover some less formidable outlet, I saw, over the vast folding-gates through which I had just passed, a blue, tremulous flame, which, after playing for a few seconds over the dark ground of the pediment, settled gradually mto characters of light, and formed the following words -— You, who would try Yon temblé tnck To live, or to die, But ne'er to took back— You, who aipire To be purified then, Sy the terrors of Fire, OfWater.aadAir,— If danger, and pain, And death you deipue, On—for tgun Into light you shall rite, Rue into hght With that Secret Divme, Now ihrooded from nght By the Vedi ofthe Shnne 1 But if------ E 8
Here the letters feded away mto a dead blank, more awfully intelligible than the most eloquent words A new hope now flashed across me Hie dream of the Garden, which had been for some tune almost forgotten, re¬ turned to my mind " Am I then," I exclaimed, " in the path to the promised mystery? and shall the great secret of Eternal Life indeed be mine ?" « Yes '" seemed to answer, out of the air, tbat spint-voice, which stdl was heard crowning llie choir with its single sweet¬ ness I haded the omen with transport Love and Immortabty, both beckonmg me onward—who could give a thought to fear, with two such bright hopes m view ? Havmg invoked and blessed that unknown enchantress, whose steps bad led me to this abode of mystery and knowledge, I plunged mto uie chasm Instead of tbat vague, spectral twilight which had at first met my eye, I now found, as I entered, a thick «darkness,
which, though far less hornble, was, at this moment stdl more disconcert¬ ing, as my lamp, which had been, for ьоте time, almost useless, was fast ex¬ piring Resolved, however, to make the most of its last gleam, I hastened, with rapid step, through this gloomy region, which seemed wider and more open to the air than any that I had yet passed Nor was it long before the appearance of a bright blaze m the distance an¬ nounced to me that my first great Trial was at hand Ãs I drew nearer, the flames burst high and wide on all sides,— and the spectacle that now presented itself was such as might have appalled even hearts more habituated to dangers tban mme. Hiere lay before me, extending com pletely across my path, a thicket, or grove of the most combustible trees of Egypt — tamarind, pine, and Arabian balm Around then* stems and branches were coiled serpents of fire, which, twistmg e 3
themselves rapidly from bough to bough, spread their own wild-fire as they went, and involved tree after tree m one general Ыие. It was, mdeed, rapid as the bum¬ mg of those reed-beds of Ethiopia, whose light brightens, at mght, tbe distant cata¬ racts of the Nde. Through the middle of this blazing grove, I peroeived, my only pathway lay There was not a moment to be lost— the conflagration gained rapidly on either side, and already the narrowmg path between was strewed with fire Casting away my sow uteleša lamp, and holding my robe u some protection over my head, with a tremor, I own, ш every limb, I ventured through the blaze. Instandy, as if my presence had given new hfe to the flames, a fresh outbreak of combusta* .«rose oc all sides The trees clnatäPed mto a bower of fir«, above my herj, while tbe serpents, that hung havsig from the red branches, shot show¬ ers of sparkles down upon me, as I passel.
Never were decision and activity more ser¬ viceable, — one mmute later, and I must have perished The narrow openmg, of which I had so promptly avaded myself, closed mstantly behind me, and, as I looked back, to contemplate the ordeal which I had passed, I saw that the whole grove was already one mass of fire Happy at havmg escaped this first trial, I plucked from one of the pine-trees a bough that was but just kindled, and, with this for my only guide, hastened breath lessly forward I had gone but a ftw paces, when the path turned suddenly off, — leadmg downwards, as I could see by the glimmer of my brand, mto a more confined space, through which a chdlmg an-, as if from some neighbouring waters, blew over my brow Nor had I pro¬ ceeded very far, when the sound of torrents fell on my ear, — mingled, as I thought from time to time, with shnll wailmgs, like the cries of persons m danger or E 4
distress At every step the noise of the dashing waters mcreased, and I now per¬ ceived that I had entered an immense rocky «доегп, through the middle «of which, headlong as a winter-torrent, the flood, to whose roar I had been listening, rushed. Upon its surface, too, there floated strange, spectre-like shapes, which, as they went by, sent forth those dismal shrieks, as if m fear of some precipice to whose brink they were hurrying I saw too plainly that my course must be-across that torrent. Itwas fearful, but in courage lay my only hope What awaited me on the opposite shore, I knew not, for all there was wrapped in un¬ penetrable gloom, nor could the weak light I held reach half so for Dismiss¬ ing, however, all thoughts but that ot pressing onward, I sprung from the rock on which I stood mto the ûootl, — trust- mg that, with my right hand, I should be able to buffet the current, while, with the other, I might contrive to hold my
brand aloft, as long as a gummer of U remained, to guide me to the shore Long and formidable was the struggle X had to maintain More thau once, overpowered by the rush of the waters, I had almost given myself up, as destined to follow 'those apparitions, that still passed me, hurrying, with mournful cries, to their doom ш some invisible gulf before them At length, just as my strength was nearly exhausted, and the last remains of the pine-branch were felling from my hand, I saw, outstretching towards me mto the water, a light double balustrade, with a flight of steps between, ascending, almost perpendicularly, from the wave, tül they seemed lost in a dense mass of clouds аЬоле This glimpse — for it was no more, as my light expired in giving it— lent new spring to my courage Having now both hands at hberty, so despe¬ rate were my eflbrts, that after a few minutes' struggle, I felt my brow stirke £5
against the stairway, and, ш an instant more, my feet were on the steps Eejoiced at my rescue from that penlous flood, though I knew not whither the stairway led, I promptly ascended it. But thu feeling of confidence was of short duration. I had not mounted far, when, to my horror, I perceived, that each sue* cessive step, as my foot left it, broke away from beneath me, — leavmg me m mid air, with no other alternative than that of mounting still by the same momentary footing, and with the dreadful doubt whe ther it would even endure my tread. And thus did I, for a few seconds, continue t« ascend, with nothmg beneath me but that awful river, in which — so tranquil it had become — I could heai the plash of the falling fragments, as evrjry step in succession gave way under my feet It was a trying moment, but süli worse remained. I now found the balustrade, by which I had held durmg my ascent, and which had hitherto seemed firm,
grow tremulous in my hand,—while the step to which I was about to trust my self, tottered under my foot. Just then, a momentary flash, as if of lightning, broke around, and I saw, hanging out of the clouds, within my reach, a huge brazen nng Instinctively I stretched forth my arm to seize it, and, at the same in stant, both balustrade and steps gare way beneath me, and 1 was left swinging by my hands m the dark void As if, too, this massy ring, which I grasped, was by some magic power linked with all th« winds m heaven, no sooner had I seized it than, bke the touching of a spring, it seemed to give loose to every vanety of gusts and tempests, that ever strewed the sea-shore with wrecks or dead, and, as I swung about, the sport of this elemental strife, each new burst of its Airy threatened to shiver me, like a storm-sad, to atoms t Nor was even this the worst, — still holding, I know not how, by the rmg, I fett myself caught up, as if by a thousand ε 6
whirlwinds, and round and round, like a stone-shot m a shng, whirled in the midst of aU Ìbis deafening chaos, tdl my brain grew dizzy, and my recollection confused, and I almost fancied myself on that wheel of the infernal world, whose rotations, it is said, Eternity alone can number f Human strength could no longer sub tain auch a trial I was on the point, at last, of loosing my hold, when suddenly the violence of die storm moderated,— my whirl through the air gradually ceased, and I felt the ring slowly destend with me, till—happy as a shipwrecked man¬ ner at the first touch of land—I fourni my feet once more upon firm ground At the same moment, a light of the most delicious softness filled the whole air Music, sucls as is heard m dreams, came floating at a distance, and, as my eyes gra¬ dually recovered their powers of vision, » scene of gloiy was revealed to them, almost too bnght for imagination, and yet living and real. As far as tlie sight
could reach, enchanting gardens were seen, openmg away through long tracts of light and verdure, and sparkling every where with fountains, that circulated, like streams of life, among the floweis. Not a charm was here wanting, that the imagin¬ ation of poet 01 prophet ш their pic¬ tures of Elysium, ever yet dreamed or promised. Vistas, openmg into scenes of indistinct grandeur, — streams, shining out at intervals, in their shadowy course, — and labyrmths of flowers, leadmg, by mysterious wmdings, to green, spacious gbdes, fìlli of splendour and repose Over all this, too, there fell a light fr° m some unseen source, resembling nothing that illumines our upper world — a sort of golden moonlight, mingling the warm ra¬ diance of day with the calm and melan- ihol) lustre of night Nor were there wanting inhabitants for this sunless Paradise. Through all the bright gardens were wandering, with the serene air and step of happy spints, groups
both of young «nd old, of venerable and of lovely forms, bearing, most of them, the Nde's white flowers on their heads, and branches of the eternal palm m their hands, whde, over the verdant turf, fair children and maidens went dancing to aerul music, whose source was, like that of the light, invisible, but wh ch filled tbe whole air with its mystic sweetness Exhausted as I was by the trials I had undergone, no sooner did I perceive those fair groups m the distance, than my weari¬ ness, both of frame and spirit, was for¬ gotten A thought crossed me that she, whom I sought, might be among them, and, notwithstanding the awe, with which that unearthly scene inspired me, I was about to fly, on the instant, to ascertain my hope. But ш the act of making the effort, I felt my robe gendy pulled, and turning, beheld an aged man before me, whom, bv die sacred hue of his garb, I knew to be a Hierophant Placing a branch of the consecrated palm in my hand, he said,
m a solemn voice, " Aspirant of the Mys¬ teries, welcome !" — then, regarding me for a few seconds with grave attention, added, m a tone of courteousness and in¬ terest, " The victory over the body hath been gamed ! — Follow me, young Greek, to diy resting placp " I obeyed m edence, —and the Priest, turning away from this scene of splendour, mto а secluded path, where the light faded away,' as we advanced, conducted me to a small pavilion, by the side of a whisper¬ ing stream, where the very spint of slum¬ ber seemed to preside, and, pointing to α bed of dried poppy-leaves within it> left me to repose
CHAP VIU Though the sight of that splendid scene which opened upon me, hke a momentary glimpse into another world, had, ibr an in¬ stant »-animated my strength and spirit so completely had fatigue overmastered my whole frame, that even had the form of the young Pnestess stood before me, my hmbs would have sunk m the effort to reach her No sooner had I fidlen on im leafy couch, than sleep, hke a sudden death, came over me, and I lay, for hours, in the deep, and motionless rest which not even a shadow of life disturbs On awaking I saw, beside me, the same venerable personage, who had welcomed me to this subterranean world on the pre¬ ceding night At the foot of my couch stood a statue, of Grecian workmanship, repre¬ senting a boy, with wings, seated gracefully
on a lotus-flower, and having tbe fore¬ finger of his nght hand pressed to his hps This action, together with the glory round his brows, denoted, as I already knew, the God of Sdence and Light Impatient to кпгц what further trials awaited me, I was about to speak, when the Priest exclaimed, anxiously, " Hush '" —and, pointing to this statue at the foot of the couch, said—" Let the spell of that Spirit be on thy lips, young stranger, üli the wisdom of thy instructors shall think fit to remove it Not unaptly doth the same god preside over Silence and Light; since it is only out of the depth of contemplative bilence, that the great light of the soul, Truth, anses í" Little used to the language of dictation or instruction, I was now preparing to rise, when the priest agam restrained me, and, at the same moment two boys', beautiful as the young Genu of the stars, entered tbe pavdion. They were habited ш long garments it the purest white, and bore
each a small golden chalice in bis hand. Advancing towards me, they stopped on opposite aide· of the couch, and one of them» presenting tome his chalice of gold, said* in a tone between singing and speak- fog,— * Drink of this cup— Omris sip· The пшв in his halli below ; «And tbe nune be give·, to cool the lips Of die Dead, wbo downwiwd go. " Drink of this cap—the water within b trtah from «Lethe*· stream j Twill make (he past with all iti airi, And all iu pain and sorrow·, seem Ше a long-forgotten dream 1 * The pleasure, whose chums Aretteep'din woej The taowleuge, that harms ТЛш ioul to know; M The hope, that, bright Ai the lake of the waste, Allure· the ught, But mocki tbe taste ΐ
M The love, that bradi Iti innocent wreath, Whtn« tbe lerpeot maat, In venom, beneath,— " All that, of evil or falte, by thee Hath ever been known or кеп, Shall melt away in thu cup, «od be r orgot, a* it never had beea 1" Unwilling to throw а slight on this strange ceremony, I leaned forward, with all due gravity, and tasted fhe cup, which I had no sooner done than the young cup-bearer, on the other side, mvited my attention, and, m his turn, presenting the chalice which he held, sung, with a voice still sweeter than that of his companion, the following stram -— w Dnnk of thit cup—when It» led Her boy, of old, to the beaming iky, She mingled a draught divine, and iaid— ' Drink of th» cup, thou'lt never die 1' 1 Thtn do I uy and tmg to thee, Heir of that boundleu beav*n on high, Though frail, and ntli'n, and loit thou be, Dnnk of ttui cup, thou'lt never die 1"
Muchas I had endeavoured to keep my philosophy on its guard, agamst the illu¬ sione with which, I knew, this region abounded, the young cup-bearer had here touched a spring of imagination, over which, as has been seen, my philosophy had but httle controul No sooner had the words, " thou shalt never die," struck on my ear, than the dream of the Garden came fully to my mind, and, starting half¬ way from the couch, I stretched forth my hands to the cup Recollecting myself, however, and fearful of havmg betrayed to others a weakness only fit fbr my own secret indulgence, with an afieeted smile of indifference I sunk back agam on my couch, — «hue the young minstrel, but little interrupted by my movement, still continued his stram, of which I heard but the concluding words — " And Memoiy, too, with her dresmi thall come Dresmi ofa former, happier dnv. When Hetven wu »till the Spirit's home, And her wmg* had not yet Ы\т iwsy,
*· Glimptei of glory, ne'er forgot, That tell, like gleam· on a luqteţ tea, What once hath been, what now u not, But, oh, what again thall bnghtly be 1" Though the assurances of immortality, contamed m these verses, would, at any other moment, — vain and visionary as Ί thought them, — have sent my fancy wan¬ dering mto reveries of the future, the effort of self-control I had just made ena¬ bled me to hear them with indifference. Havmg gone th rough the form of tasting this second cup, I agam looked anxiously to the Hierophant, to ascertain whether I might be permitted to rise His assent having been given, the young pagesbrought to my couch a robe and tunic, which, like their own, were of lmen of the purest white, and havmg assisted to clothe me in this sacred garb, they then placed upon my head a chaplet of myrtle, m which the symbo' of Initiation, a golden grashopper, was seen shining out from among the dark leaves
Though sleep had done much to refresh my frame, something more was «tdl wanting to restore its strength, and it was not without a smile at my own revenes I reflected, how much more welcome than the young page's cup of immortality was the unpretending, but real, repast now set bemre me,—fresh fruits from the Isle of Gardena in the Nde, the delicate flesh of the desert antelope, and wme from tbe Vineyard of the Queens at Anthylla, Sumed by one of the pagrs with a palm- leaf, to keep it cool. Having done justice to these dainties, it was with pleasure I heard the proposal of the Priest, that we should now walk forth together, and meditate among the scenes without I had not forgotten the elysium that welcomed me last night, —those en¬ chanted gardens, that mystenous music, and light, and tbe fiut torma I saw wandering about,—as ift in the very midst of hap¬ piness, still seeking it The hope, which had then occurred to me, that, perhaps,
among those sparkling groups, might be the maiden I sought, now returned with increased strength. I had httle doubt that my guide was about to lead to the same Elysian scene, and that the form, so fit to inhabit it, would again appear before my eyes But for different was the region to whicli he conducted me, nor could the whole world produce a scene more gloomy, or more strange It had the appearance of α small, sohtary valley, inclosed, on every side, by rocks, which seemed to rise, al¬ most perpendicularly, to the very sky, — for it uas, indeed, the blue sky that I saw shining between theur summits, and whose light, dimmed and half lost, m its descent thus far, formed the melancholy daylight of this nether world. * Down the side of * ' On t'était même Kiké, depui« la première coBitnicdon de см demeura, de parear an pla¬ neur· eadroit* juta/au baut les terrei qui Ica cou vroient , noo pu, a ta vinte, pour brer ua Jour qui n'aurait jams» été tuffiiant, maii pour recevoir un air MŰutaire, Ac "— Selkoi
these rocky walls fell a cataract, whose source waa upon earth, and on whose waters, aa they rolled glassily over the edge above, a gleam of radiance rested, that showed how brilliant was the sun¬ shine they left. From thence, gradually darkening, and broken, in its long de¬ scent, by alternate chasms and projections, the stream fell, at last, in a pale and thin mist—the phantom of what it had been on earth — into a small lake that lay at the base of the rack to receive it. Nothing could be more bleak and sad¬ dening tban the appearance of thu lake. The usual ornaments of the waters of Egypt were not wanting : the lotus here up¬ lifted her silvery flowers, and the crimson flamingo floated over the tide. But they were, neither of them, the same as in the upper world ; — the flower had exchanged its whiteness for a livid hue, and the wings of the bird hung heavy and colourless. Every thing wore the same half-living aspect ; and the only sounds that dis-
turbed the mournful stillness were the wailing cry of a heron among the sedges, and that dm ofthe waters, m their midway struggle, above. There was an unearthly sadness in the whole scene, of which no heart, however light, could resist the influence. Per¬ ceiving bow I was afieeted by it, " Such scenes," said the Priest, " are best suited to that solemn complexion of mmd, which becomes hun who approaches the Great Secret of futurity Behold," — and, m saymg thus, he pomted to the openmg over our heads, through which I could perceive a star or two twinkling m the heavens, though the sun had but a short tune passed his meridian,—"as from this gloomy depth we can see those stars, which are now invisible to the dweilen upon the bright earth, even so, to the sad and self-humbled spint, doth many a mystery of heaven reveal itself, of which they, who walk in the light of the proud world, know not l'*
He now led me towards a rustic seat or alcove, bende which stood au unage of that dark Deity, that God without a smile, who presides over the kingdom of the Dead.* The same Imd and lifeless hue was spota hia features, that hung over every dung m this dim valley, and, with his right hand, he pomted directly down wards, to denote that his melancholy kingdom lay there. A plantam — that firrountr tree of the genu of Death — stood behind the statue, and spread its branches over the alcove, m which thc friest now, seating himself, signified that I should take my place by his side After a long pause, as if of thought and preparation, —" Nobly," said he, " young Greek, hut thou sustained the first tnals of Initiation. What remains, though ot vital import to the aoul, brings with it neither pam nor peril to the body Havmg now proved and chastened thy mortal frame, by the three ordeals of Fire, of • CWm.

world, and of its vain delights, still en¬ gross thee too much, to let the lessons of Truth sink profitably into thy heart, "s ttm hour· of meditation amid this solemn ■cenery—of that wholesome meditation, which purifies, by saddening — may haply dispose thee to receive, with reve¬ rence, the holy and immortal knowledge tbat is in rtore for thee. With this hope, I now leave thee to thy own thoughts, and to that Ood, beibre whose calm and mournful eye the vanities of the world, rrom which thou cocjst, wither t" Thus saying, he turned slowly away, and pasung behind the statue, towards which he had pointed during the lası sen¬ tence, suddenly, and as if by enchantment, disappeared from my sight
CHAP IX. Beino left to my own sohtary thoughts, I had now leisure to reflect, with coolness, on the inconveniences, if not dangers, of the situation mto which my love of adven¬ ture had hurned me However ready my imagination was to kindle, m its own ideal sphere, I have ever found that, when brought mto contact with reality, it as suddenly cooled,—like those meteors, that seem stars in the air, but, the mo¬ ment thcy touch earth, are extinguished. Such was the disenchantment that now succeeded to the dreams in which I had been mdulging As long as Fancy had the field of the future to herself, even im¬ mortabty did not seem too distant a race for her But when human instrument* interposed, the illusion vanished From mortal lips the promise of immortality ι 3
seemed a mockery, and imagination her¬ self had no wings that could carry beyond the grave. Nor was this disappointment the only feeling that occupied me; — the impru¬ dence ofthe step, which I had taken, now appeared in its full extent before my eyes. I had thrown myself into the power of the most artful priesthood in the world, without e dünce of bemg able to escape from tbeir toils, or to resist any machin¬ ation wrm whidi they might beset me. It stKmrfevloWil^ ftom the stateof preparation in whieh I had found all that wonderful apparatus, by which the terrors and splen¬ dour· of Initiation are produced, that my descent into the pyramid was not unex¬ pected. Numerous, indeed, and active as were the spies of the Sacred College of Me mphi s , there could be but little doubt that a>0 my movements, since my arrival, had beea tracked | and the many hours I hod passed in watching and wandering round the pyramid, betrayed t curiosity
«xhich might well inspire these wily pnests with the hope of drawing an Epicurean mto their superstitious toils. I well knew their hatred to the sect of which I was Chief) — that they con¬ sidered the Epicureans as, next to the Christians, the most formidable enenuea of theu* craft and power "How thought¬ less, then," I exclaimed, " to have placed myself m a situation, where I am equally helpless against their fraud and violence, and must either seem to be the dupe of theur impostures, or submit to become the victim of their vengeance" Of these alternatives, bitter as they were, the latter appeared by far the more welcome. I blushed even to think of the mockeries to which I already had yieldedi and the prospect of being put through still nuther ceremonials, and of being tutored and preached to by hypocrites I d«r«spu«ed, appeared to me, h my present temper, a trial of patience, to which the munaa I 4
and the whirlwinds I had already en¬ countered were pastime. Often and impatiently did I look up, between those rocky walls, to the bright sky that appeared to rest upon their sum¬ mita, as, round and round, through every part of the valley, I endeavoured to find an outlet from its gloomy precincts. But in vain I endeavoured; — that rocky barrier, which seemed to end but in heaven, inter¬ posed itself every where. Neither did the image of the young makten, though con¬ stantly b my mind, now bring with it the ssast corisobmon or hope. Of what avail was it ihat she, perhaps, was an inhabi¬ tant of this region, if I could neither see her smile, nor catch the souna of her voice, — if, while among preaching priests I wasted away my hours, her presence diffused its enchantment elsewhere. At length exhausted, I lay down by the brink of tbe lake, and gave myself up to all the melancholy of my buey. The
pale semblance of daylight, which had hitherto shone around, grew, every mo¬ ment, more dim and dismal Even the neh gleam, at the summit of the cascade, had faded, and tiie sunshine, like the water, exhausted in its descent, had now dwmdled mto a ghostly glimmer, fer worse than darkness The birds upon the lake, as if about to die with the dying light, sunk down their heads, and, as I looked to the statue, the deepening shadows gave an expression to its mournful features that chilled my very souL The thought of death, ever ready to present itself to my linagiuation, now came, with a disheartening weight, such as I had never before felt I almost fancied myself already in the dark vestibule ofthe grave, — separated, fbr ever, from tfae world above, and with nothing but tfae blank of an eternal sleep before me It had often, knew, happened that the visitants of Uus mystenous realm were, after their descent r 5
Sram earth, never seen or heard of, — being condemned, for some failure m their initiatory trials, to pine away their Uves m the dark dungeons, with which, as well as with altars, this region abounded. Such, I shuddered to thmk, might probably be my destiny, and so appalling waa thc thought, that even the spirit of defiance died withm me, and I was already giving myeelf op to helplessness and despair At length, after some hours of this gloomy muring, I heard a rustung m the sacred grove behmd the statue, and, soon after, the sound of the Priest's voice —- more welcome than I had ever thought auch voice could be — brought the as aurance that I was not yet, at least, wholly abandoned. Finduig his way to me through the gloom, he now led me to the same spot, on which we bad parted so many noun before, and, m a voice that retamad no trace of displeasure, bespoke my attention, while he should reveal to me some of those divine truths, by whose
mfüMon, he said, into tha «ml of man, ita purification can alone be eflected. The valley had now become so wholly dark, that we could no longer ducem each other's laces, as we sat lhere was a melancholy ш the voice of my instructor that well accorded with the gloom around us, and, saddened and subdued, I now listened with resignation, if not with in¬ terest, to those sublime, but, alas, I thought, vam tenets, which, with tbe warmth of a believer«, Uus Hierophant expounded to me. He spoke of the pre-existence of the soul, — of its abode, from all eternity, ш a place of bliss, of which all that we have most beautiiul m ourconcepüonihere ıs bet a dun transcript, a clouded remembrance. In the blue depths of ether, he said, lay that " Country of the Soul," — its boundary alone visible m the hne of milky light, that separates it, as bj л barrier of stars, from the dark earth. " Oh, realm of punty t r 6
Home of же yet Unfällen Spirit I — where, in the dava of her primal innocence, she wandered, ere her beauty was soiled by the touch of earth, or her resplendent wings had withered, away Methinks," ho cned, M I see, at this moment, those fields of radiance, —I look back, through tlie mists of life, into that luminous world, where the souls that have never lost their high, heavenly rank, still soar, without a stam, above the shadowless stars, and dwell to¬ gether ш infinite perfection and bliss 1" As he spoke these words, a burst of pure, brilliant light, like a sudden opening of heaven, broke through the valley, and, as soon as my eyes were able to endure the itplendoiir, such a vision of loveliness and glory opened upon tbem, as took even my sceptical spmt by surprise, and made at yield, at once, to the .potencj ofthe apelL Suspended, as I thought, m air, and occupying the whole of the opposite region of the valley, there appeared an immense
orb of light, within which, through a haze of radiance, I could see distinctly groups of young female spmts, who, m silent, but harmonious movement, bke that of the stars, wound slowly through a variety of fanciful evolutions, and, as they linked and unlmked each other's arms, formed a living labyrinth of beauty and grace Though their feet seemed to tread along a field of light, they had also wings, of the richest hue, which, like rainbows over waterfiills, when played with by the breeze, at every moment reflected a new variety of glory As I stood, gazing with wonder, the orb, with all its ethereal inmates, gradually receded mto the dark void, lessening, as it «vent, and growing more bnght, as it les¬ sened , — till, at length, distant, apparent¬ ly, as a retiring comet, this little world of Spirits, ш one small point of intense ra¬ diance, shone its last and vanished. " Go," exclaimed the rapt Priest, " ye happy souls, of whose dwelhng a glimpse is thus
given to our eyes, go, wander, m your orb, throuo^i the boundless heaven, nor ever let a thought of thu perishable world come to mingle its dross with your divine nature, or tempt you to tliat earthward fall, by which spirits, as bnght, have been ruined ľ' A pause ensued, during which, still under the influence of wonder, 1 sent my fancy wandermg after the mhabitants of Úiat orb» — almost wishing myself cre¬ dulous enough to believe m a heaven, of which creature«, so hke all that I most loved on earth, were inmates. At length, the Priest, with a sigh at the contrast he was about to draw, between the happy spmts we had just seen and the fidlen ones of earth, resumed his melan¬ choly History of the Soul Tracing it, from the ñrst moment of earthward desire, to its final ecbpse in the shadows of this world, he dwelt upon every stage of its darkening descent, with a pathos that sent SAdness mto the very depths of the heart lbe first downward look of the Spint to-
wards earth—the tremble of her wings on the edge of Heaven—the giddy slide, at length, down that fatal descent, and the Lethtean cup, midway m tbe sky, of which when she has once tested, Heaven is forgot, — through aU these gradations he mourn¬ fully traced her fall, to the last stage of dark¬ ness, when, wholly immersed m thu world, her celestial nature is changed, she can no langer rise abo\e earth, nor remembers her home, but by glimpses so vague, that, mistaking for hope what is only memory, she bebeves them to be a bght from die Future, not the Past " To retrieve this ruin of the once blessed Soul — to clear away, from around her, the clouds of earth, and, restoring her lost wings*, facilitate their return to Heaven — such," said the reverend man, " is the greitt task of om religion, and such the triumph of those divine Mysteries, щ * In the inngange of Plato, Hierocles, &c to ' rettore to the soul tta wing*," u the mam object both of religion snd philosophy

However sunk and changed and clouded may be the Spirit, as long as a single trace of her original hght remains, there is yet hope that------" Here his voice was interrupted by a Strain of mournful music, of which the low, distant breathings had been, for some minutes, heard, but which now gamed upon the ear too thnlhngly to let it listen to any more earthly sound A faint light, too, at that instant broke through the valley, — and I could per¬ ceive, not far from the spot where we sat, a female figure, veiled, and crouching to eorth, as if subdued by sorrow, or under the influence of shame. The light, by which I saw her, nas from a pale, moon-like meteor, which had formed itself m the air as the music ap¬ proached, and shed over the rocks and the lake a glimmer as cold as that by which the Dead, ш their own realm, gaze on each other. The music, too, which appeared
to nse directly out of the lake, and to come full ofthe breath of its dark waters, spoke a despondency m every note which no language could express,—and, as I lis¬ tened to its tones, and looked upon that tallen Spirit, (for such, the holy man whispered, was the form befoie us,) so entirely did the illusion of the scene teke possession of me, that, with breathless anxiety, I waited the result. Nor had I gazed long before that form rose slowly from its drooping posi¬ tion ,—the air around it grew bright, and the pale meteor overhead assumed а more cheerful and living light Tlie veil, which had before shrouded the race of the figure, became gradually transparent, and the features, one by one, dibclosed themselves through iu Having tremblingly watched the progress of the apparition, I now started from my seat, and half exclaimed, " It is she !" In another minute, this ved had, like a thm mist, melted away, and the young Pnestess of the Moon stood,
for the third time, revealed before my eyes To rush instantly towards her was my «first impulse—but the arm of the Pnest held me firmly back The fresh light, which had begun to flow in fiom all sides, collected itself in a glory round the spot where she stood Instead of melancholy music, strams of thé most exalted rapture were heard, and the young maiden, buoy¬ ant as the inhabitants of the fairy orb, amid a blaze of hght hke that which fell upon her ш the Temple, ascended mto the " Stay, beautiful vision, stay!" I ex¬ claimed, as, breaking from the hold of the Pnest, I flung myself prostrate on the ground,—the only mode by which I could express the admiration, even to worship, with which I was filled But tbe vanishing spirit heard me not — receding mto the darkness, like that orb, whose track she seemed to follow, her form lessened away, till she wu seen no more. Gazing, nil
the last luminous speck had disappeared, I suffered myself unconsciously to be led away by my reverend guide, who, placing me once more on my bed of poppy- leaves, left me to such repose as it was possible, after such a scene, to enjoy.
CHAP X The appanüon with which I had been blessed m that Valley of Visions — as the place where I had witnessed these won ders was called — brought back to my heart all the hopes and fancies, m which I had indulged durmg my descent from earth I had now seen once more that matchless creature, who had: been my guiding star mto this mysterious world, and that she was, m some way, connected with the further revelations that awaited me, I saw no reason to doubt There was a sublimity, too, in the doctrines of my reverend teacher, and even a hope m the promises of immortabty held out by him, which, m spite of reason, won insen¬ sibly both upon my fancy and my pnde The Future, however, was now but of secondary consideration, — the Present
and that deity of the Present, woman, were the objects that engiossed my whole soul For the sake, indeed, of such beings alone did I think immortality desirable, nor, without them, would eternal life have ap¬ peared to rae worth a prayer To every further trial of my patience and faith, I now made up my mind to submit without a murmur Some propitious chance, I fondly persuaded myself, might yet bnng me nearer to the object of my adoration, and enable me to address, as mortal wo¬ man, her who had hitherto been to me but as a vision, a shade The period of ray probation, however, was nearly at an end Both frame and spirit had now been tried, and, as the crownmg test of the purification of the latter was that power of seemg mto the world of spirits, with which, m the Valley of Visions, I had proved myself to be en¬ dowed, there remained now, to perfect my Initiation, but this one night more,
when, m the Temple of bis, and m the presence of her unveded image, the last grand revelation of the Secret of Secrets was to open upon me I passed the mornmg of this day m company with the same venerable person¬ age, who had, from the first, presided over the ceremonies of my instruction, and who, to inspire me with due reverence for the power and magnificence of his religion, now conducted me through the long range of lUununated gallenes and shrines, that extend under the site npon which Mem¬ phis and the Pyramids stnnd, and form a counterpart under ground to that might) city of temples upon earth. He then descended with me, stul lower, mto those winding crypts, where lay the .Seven Tables of stone, found by Hermes in die valley of Hebron. " On these tables," said he, " is written all the know¬ ledge of the antediluvian race, — the decrees of the stars from the beginning of tune, tlie annals of a still earlier world,
and all the marvellous secrets, both of heaven and earth, which would have been, " but for thu key, Lost ш tbe Universal Sea " Returning to the region, from which we had descended, we next visited, in succes¬ sion, a series of small shrines, represent¬ ing the vanous objects of adoration through Egypt and thus furmshing to the Priest an occasion for explaining the mysteri¬ ous nature of animal worship, and the re¬ fined doctrines of theology that lay veiled under its forms Every shrine was con¬ secrated to a particular faith, and con¬ tameli a living image of the deity which it adored Beside the goat of Mendes, with his refulgent star upon his breast I saw ihe crocodile, as presented to the eyes of its idolaters at Arsinoe, with costly gems m its loathsome ears, and neh bracelets of goţd encircling its feet Here, floating through a tank in the centre of a temple, the sacred carp of Lepidotum exhibited its sdvery
scales, wlule, there, the Isiac serpents traded languidly over the altar, wnh that movement which most mspires the hopes of their votanes In one of the small chapels we found a beautiful chdd, feeding and watching over those golden beetles, which are adored ■- their brightness, as emblems of the sun, while, ш another, stood a sacred Ìbis upon its pedestal, so like, m plumage and attitude, to the bird of the young Pnestess, that I could gladly have knelt down and worshipped it for her sake After visiting these various shrines, and listening to the reflections which they sug¬ gested, I was next led by my guide to the Great Hall of the Zodiac, on whose ceiling, ю bnght and undying colours, was delineated the map of the firmament, as it appeared at the first dawn of time Here, ш pointing out the track of the sun, among the spheres, he spoke eloquently of the analogy that exists between moral and physical darkness — of the sympathy with
which all spiritual creatures regard the sun, so as to sadden and droop when he sinks mto his wintry hemisphere, and to rejoice when he resumes his own em¬ pire of light Hence, the festivals and hymns, with which most of the nations of the earth are wont to welcome the resur¬ rection of his orb m spring, as an emblem and pledge of the re-ascent of the soul to heaven Hence, the songs of sorrow, the mournful ceremonies, — like those Mysteries ofthe Night upon the Lake of Saie, — in which they brood over his autumnal descent into the shades, as a type of the Spirit's fall mto this world of death In discourses such as these the hours passed away, and though there was no¬ thmg m the hght of this bunless region tr mark to the eye the decime of day, my own feelmgs told me that the night drew near, — nor, m spite of my incredulity, could I refrain from a flutter of hope, as α
that promised moment of revelation ap¬ proached, when the Mystery of Mysteries was to be made all my own This con¬ summation, however, was less near than I expected. \-y patience bad still further trials to encounter It was necessary, I now found, that I should keep watch, dur¬ mg the greater part of the night, m the Sanctuary of the Temple, alone and m darkness, — and thus prepare myself, by meditation, for the awful moment, when the irradiation from behind the sacred Veils was to burst upon me. At the appointed hour, we left the Hall of the Zodiac, and proceeded through a hne of long marble galleries, where the lamps were more thinly scattered as we ad¬ vanced, till, at length, we found ourselves ш total darkness. Here the Priest, taking me by the hand, and leadmg me down α flight of steps, into aplace where the same deep gloom prevailed, said, with a voice trembling, as if from excess of àwe, — " Thou ait now m the Sanctuary of our
goddess, Isu, (md the dark veils, that hang over her image, are before thee t " After exhorting me earnestly to that tram of thought, which best accorded with the spint ofthe place where I stood, and, above all, to that full and unhesitatmg faith, with which alone, he said, the mani¬ festation of such mysteries should be ap¬ proached, the holy man took leave cf me, and re-ascended the steps, — whde, so spell-bound did I feel by that deep dark- ness, that the last sound of hu footsteps died upon my ear, before I ventured to sür a limb from the position in which he had left me The prospect of the long watch, now before me, was dreadfuL Even danger itself, in an active form, would have been preferable to this sort of safe, but dull, probation, by which patience was the only virtue put to the proof, Having ascertained how far the space around me was free from obstacles, I endeavoured о î
18* THI »PICUREAN. to beguile the time by pacing up and down within those limits, tül I became tired of the echoes of my own tread. Finding my way, then, to what I felt a be a massive pillar, and, leaning wearily against it, I surrendered myeelf to a tram of thoughts and feelings, far different ftom those with which the Hierophant had hoped to inspire me. " Why," I again asked, " if these priest* possess the secret of life, why are they themselves the victims of death ? why sink into the grave with the cup of immortality in their hands ? but no, safe boasters, the eternity they so lavishly pro¬ mise is reserved fbr another, a future world—that ready resource of all priestly promises — that depository of the airy pledges of all creeds. Another world I — alas, where does it lie? or, what spirit hath ever come to say that Lite is there <" The conclusion, to which, half sadly, half passionately, I arrived, was that, life being but a dream of the moment,
never to come again, every bliss that is pn «nised for hereafter should be secured by the wise man here. «And, as no heaven I had ever heard of from these visionary priests opened half such cer¬ tainty of happiness as that smile which I beheld last night — " Let me," I ex¬ claimed, impatiently, striking the massy pillar, till it rung, " let me but make that beaut nil Priestess my own» and I here willingly exchange for her every chance of immortality, that the combined vris- dom of Egypt's Twelve Temples can offer me ! " No sooner bad I uttered these words, than a tremendous peal, like that of thunder, rolled over the Sanctuary, and seemed to shake its walls. On every side, too, a succession of blue, vivid flashes pierced, like so many lances of light through the gloom, Mvealing to me, at intervals, the mighty dome in which I stood— its ceiling of asure, stud¬ ded with stars, its colossal сЫшпшц о 3
towering «ilclt, and those dark, mysterious reils, «hicli hung, in massy drapery, irom the roof to the floor, and covered the rich glories of the Shrine under tlieir folds. So weary had I grown of my tedious watch, that this stormy and fitful illumin¬ ation* during which the Sanctuary seemed to rock to its base, was by no means an vmwelcome interruption of the monotony under which my impatience suflered. iafter a short interval, however, the flashes ceased; —the sounds died away, like ex¬ hausted thunder, through the abyss, and darkness and silence, hke that of the grave, succeeded. Resting my back once more against the pillar, and fixing my eyes upon that side of the Sanctuary, Irom which the pro¬ mised iraadiation was to burst, I now resolved to await the awful moment in pa t ie n ce. Resigned and immovable, I had remained thus, for nearly another hour, when, suddenly, along the edges of the mighty Veils, I perceived a thin rim
of light, as if from some brilliant object under them. — hke that border which encircles a cloud at sunset, when the radiance, from behind, is escaping at its edges This indication of concealed glories grew every mstant more strong, tdl, at last, vividly marked as it was upon the darkness, the narrow fringe of lustre al¬ most pamed the eye, giving promise of a splendour too bright to be endured. My expectations were now wound to the high¬ est pitch, »nd all the scepticism, mto which I had been cooling down my mind, was forgotten The wonders that had been presented to me since my descent from earth —that ghmpse into Elysium on the first night of my coming — those visitants from the Land of Spirita ш the mysterious valley, — all led me to expect, m thu last and brightest revelation, soch visions of glory and knowledge aa might transcend even fancy itself, nor leave α 4
a doubt that they belonged less to earth than heaven. ' While, with an imagination thus excited, I stood waiting the result on increased gush of light still more awakened my at¬ tention; and I saw, with an intenseness of interest, which made my heart beat aloud, one ofthe corners of the mighty Veil slow¬ ly raised up, I now felt that the Great Secret — whatever it might be — was at hand. A vague hope even crossed my mind — ao wholly had imagination resumed her empire—-that the splendid promise of my dream was on the point of being realised! With surprise, however, and—for a moment — with disappointment I per¬ ceived, that the many corner of the Veil was but. raised sufficiently to allow a female figure to emerge from under it — and EbcBR'&u again, over it» mystic splendours, as .dark a* before. By the strong light too, that usued when the drapery was lifted, and ШпттаЫ the profile of the
emerging figure, I either sav, oi fancied that I saw, the same bright features, that had already mocked me so often with their momentary charm, and seemed des¬ tmed to haunt my heart as unavaihngly as the fond, vain dream of Immortality itself Dazzled as I had been by that short gush of splendour, and distrusting even my senses, when under the influence of a fancy so excited, I had hardly tune to question myself as to the reality of my impression, when I heard the sounds of hght footsteps approaching me through the gloom In a second or two more, the figure stopped before me, and, placing the end of a nband gently m my hand, said, in a tremulous whisper, " Follow, and be sdent" So sudden and strange was the inven¬ tore, that, for a moment, I hesitated,—fear¬ ful lest my eyes should have been deceived as to the object they had seen Casting a look towards the Veil, which seemed burst¬ ing with its luminous secret, I was almost β Б
doubtiag to which, of the two chances I sbould commit myself, when I felt the riband in my hand pulled softly at the other extremity. Ibis movement, at once, like a touch of magic, decided me. Without further deliberation, I yielded to the silent summons, and fol¬ lowing my guide, who was already at some distance before me, found myself led up the same flight of marble steps, by which the Priest had conducted me mto the Sanctuary. Arrived at tlieir summit, I felt the pace of my conductress quicken, and, giving one more look to the Veiled Shrine, whose glories we left bummg mefrectually behmd us, has¬ tened mto the gloom, full of confidence m the bebet that she, who now held the other end of that due, was one whom I oouk) fellow devotedly through the world
CHAP XL So rapidly was I hurned along by my unseen conductress, full of wonder at the speed with which she ventured through these labyrinths, that I had but httle tune to reflect upon the strangeness of the adventure to which I had committed my¬ self My Knowledge of the character of the pnests, as well as the fearful rumours that had reached me, of the fate that often attended unbelievers m their hands, wak«d a momentary suspicion of treachery m my mmd But, when I recalled the face of my guide, as I had seen it m the chapel, with that divine look, the very me¬ mory of which brought punty mto the heart, this suspicion all vanished, and I felt shame at havmg harboured it but an instant. In the mean while, our course continued uninterrupted, through winding» more о 6
capriciously mtncate than any that I had yet passed, and whose darkness seemed never to have been disturbed by a single glimmer. My conductress still continued at some distance before me, and the clue, to which I clung as if tt were the thread of Destiny herself, was still kept, by her speed, at full stretch between us At length, suddenly stopping, she said, m a breathless whisper, " Seat thyself here," and, at the same moment, led me by the band to a sort of low car, m which I lost not a moment m placing myself as desired, while the maiden, as promptly, took her seat by my side. Λ sudden click, like the touchmg of a spring, was then heard, and the car, — which, as I had felt m entenng it, leaned half-way over a steep descent, — on bemg loosed from its station, shot down, al¬ most perpendicularly, mto the darkness, with a rapidity which, at firsts nearly depnved me of breath Tbe wheels slid smoothly and noiselessly m grooves, and
the impetus, which the car acquired in descending, was sufficient, I perceived, to carry it up an eminence that succeeded, —from the summit of which it again rushed down another declivity, even still more long and precipitous than the for¬ mer In this manner we proceeded, by alternate falls and rises, till, at length, from the last and steepest elevation, the car descended upon a level of deep sand, where, after running for a few yards, it by degrees lost its motion and stopped Here, the maiden alighting, agam placed the riband m my hands, — and agam I followed her, though with more slowness and difficulty than before, as our way led up a flight of damp and time-worn steps, whose ascent seemed to the weary and insecure foot mtermmable Perceiving with what languor my guide now ad¬ vanced, I was on the point of making an effort to assist her progress, when the creak of an opening door above, and a faint gleam of hght which, at the
same moment, shone upon her figure, apprised me that we were amved withm reach of sunshine. Joyfully I followed through this open¬ ings and, by the dun hght, could discern, that we were now m the sanctuary of a vast, nuned temple, — having entered by a passage under the lofty pedestal, upon which an image of the idol of the place once stood The first movement of the maiden, after replacmg the portal under the pedestal, was, without even a look towards me, to cast herself down on her knees, with her hands clasped and up¬ lifted, ω ď for the purpose of thanksgiv¬ ing or prayer But she was unable to sustain herself m this position , — her strength could hold out no longer Over¬ come by agitation and fatigue, she sunk senseless upon the pavement. Bewddered as I was, myself, by the events of the night, I stood for some minutes looking upon her m a state of helplewness and alarm. But, reminded,
by my own feverish Bensations, of the reviving effects of the air, I raised her gently m my arms, and crossing the corri¬ dor that surrounded the sanctuary, found my way to the outer vestibule of the tem¬ ple Here, shading her eyes from the вцп, I placed her, reclining, upon the steps, where the cool wind, then blowing freshly from the north, might play, with free draught, between the pillars over her brow It was, indeed, — I now saw, with cer¬ tainty,— the same beautiful and myste¬ rious girl, who had been the cause of my descent mto that subterranean world, and who now, under euch strange and unaccountable circumstances, was my guide back agam to the realms of day I looked round, to discover where we were, and beheld such a scene of gran¬ deur, as ·— could roy eyes have wandered to any other object from the pale form reclining at my aide—might well have won them to dwell on its splendid beauties 2 was now standing, I found, on the
small island m the centre of Lake Mcens and that sanctuary, where we had emerged from darkness, formed part ofthe rums of a temple, which (as I have smce learned) was, m tne grander days of Memphis, a place of pilgrimage for worshippers from all parts of Egypt. The fair Lake, itself, out of whose waters once rose pavdions, palaces, and even lofty pyramids, was still, though divested of many of these « onders, a scene of interest «and splendour such as the whole world could not equal While the shores still sparkled with mansions and temples, that bore testimony to the luxury of a living race, the voice of the Past, spealung out of unnumbered ruins, whose summits, here and there, rose blackly above the wave, told of tunes long fled and generations long swept a waj, before whose giant remains all the glory of Ле present stood humbled Over the southern bank ofthe Lake hung the dark relics of the Labyrmth , — its twelve Royal Palaces, like the mansions of the
Zodiac, — its thundering portals and con¬ stellated halls, havmg left nothing behmd but a few frowning nuns, which, contrasted with the soft groves of olive and acacia around them, seemed to rebuke the lux¬ uriant smiles of nature, and threw a me¬ lancholy grandeur over the whole scene The effects of the air, m re-animating the young Pnestess, were less speedy than I had expected,—her eyes were stdl closed, and she lemained pale and insensible Alarmed, I now rested her head (which had been, for some time, supported by my arm,) against the base of a column, with my cloak for its pillow, whde I hastened to procure some water from the Lake The temple stood high, and the descent to the shore was precipitous But, my Epicurean ha¬ bits having but httle impaired my acti¬ vity, I soon descended, with the lightness of a desert deer, to the bottom. Here, plucking from a lofty bean-tree, whose flowers stood, shining like gold, above the
iwtfer, one of those «Urge hollowed leaves tbat eerve as cups for the Hebes of the Nile, I filled it from the Lake, and hurrifid back with the cool draught to the temple. It wa» not without some difficulty and delay that I succeeded) in bearing my rustic chalice steadily up the steep ; more than once did an unlucky slip waste its contents, and as often did I impatiently return to retili iL During this time, the young maiden was fast recovering her animation and consciousness; and, at the moment when I appeared above the edge of the steep, was just rising from the steps, with Her hand pressed to her forehead, as if confusedly recalling the recollection of what had oc¬ curred· No sooner did she observe me, than a short cry óf alarm broke from her lips. Looking anxiously round, as though «he sought for protection, and half audibly uttering the worcU, " Where is he ?" she made an effort, as I approached, to retreat into the temple.
Already, however, I was by her side, and taking her hand gently, as she turned away, " Whom dost thou seek, fair Priestess?" I asked,—for the first time breaking through the silence she had en¬ joined, and m a tone that might bave re-assured the most timid spmt. But my words had no effect m calming her apprehension Tremblmg, and with her eyes still averted towards the Temple, she continued m a voice of suppressed alarm, — " Where can he be?—that venerable Athenian, that philosopher, who ------" " Here, here," I exclaimed, amtiously interrupting her, — " behold him still by thy side—the same, the very same who saw thee steal from under the lighted Veds of the Sanctuary, whom thou hast guided by a clue through those laby¬ rinths below, and who now but watts his command from those bps, to devote him¬ self through life and death to thy ser¬ vice." As I spoke these words, she turned
slowly round, and looking timidly in my fece, whde her own burned with blushes, said, m a tone of doubt and wonder, " Thou ' " and hid her eyes in her hands I knew not how to interpret a reception so unex|iected That some mistake or disappomtment had occurred was evident, but so inexplicable did the whole adven¬ ture appear, that it was m vam to thmk of unravelling any part of it Weak nnd agitated, she now tottered to the steps of the temple, and there seatmg herself, with her forehead agamst the cold marble, seemed for some moments absorbed in the most anxious thought, — whde silent and watchful I waited her decision, with a prophetic feeling, however, that my des¬ tiny would be henceforth linked with hers Tbe inward struggle by which she was agitated, though violent, was not of long continuance Starting suddenly from her seat, with a look of terror towards the temple, as if the fear of
immediate pursuit had alone decided her, she pomted eagerly towards the East, and exclaimed, " To the Nde, without delay ! ' — clasping her hands, when she had spoken, with the most suppbant fervour, as if to soften the abruptness of the man¬ date she had given, and appealing to me with a look that would have taught Stoics tenderness I lost no tune m obeying the welcome command While a thousand wild hopes and wishes crowded upon my fancy, at the prospect which a voyage, under such auspices, presented, I descended rapidly to the shore, and hading one of the nu¬ merous boats that ply upon the Lake for lure, arranged speeddy for a passage down the canal to the Nile Havmg learned, too, from the boatmen, α more easy path up the rock, I hastened back to the Temple for my fair charge, and without a word, a look, that could alarm, even by its kindness, or disturb that innocent confidence which she now placed m me,
led her down by the wmdmg path to the boat Every thing looked smiling around us as we embarked Tbe morning was now m its first freshness, and the path of the breeze might be traced over the Lake, wakening up its waters from their sleep of the night The gay, golden winged birds tbat haunt these shores, were, m every direction, skimming along the lake, whde, with a graver conscious¬ ness of beauty, the swan and tlie pelican were seen dressing their white plumage in the mirror of its wave To add to the animation of the scene, a sweet tinkling of musical instruments came, at intervals, on the breeze, from boats at a distance, employed thus early m pursumg the fish of these waters, that suffer themselves to be decoyed mto the nets by music The vessel which I selected for our voyage was one of those small pleasure- boats or yachts, — so much m use among the luxunous navigators of the Nde, —■
m the centre of which rises a pavilion of cedar or cypress wood, gilded gorgeously, without w 'tb rebgious emblems, and fitted up, withm, for all the purposes of feasting and repose To the door of this pavibon I now led my companion, and, after a few words of kindness — tempered with as much respectful reserve as the deep ten¬ derness which I felt would admit of— left her in solitude to court that restonng rest which tlie agitation of her spirits but too much required. For myself, though repose was hardly less necessary to me, the ferment m which my thoughts had been kept seemed to render it hopeless Throwing myself upon the deck, under an awning which the sailors had raised for me, I con¬ tinued, for some hours, in a sort of vague day-dream, —sometimes passing m review the scenes of that subterranean drama, and sometimes, with my eyes fixed m drowsy vacancy, receiving passively the
impressions of the bnght scenery through which we passed. The banks of the canal were then luxu¬ riantly wooded. Under the tufts of the light and towermg palm were seen the orange and the citron, interlacing their boughs, whde, here and there, huge tamarisks thickened the shade, and, at the very edge of the bank, the willow of Babylon stood bending its graceful branches into the wa¬ ter Occasionally, out of the depth uf these groves, therp shone a small temple or pleasure-house,—whde, now and then, an openmg m their Ime of foliage allowed the eye to wander over extensive fields, all covered with beds of those pale, sweet roses, for which this distnct of Egypt ь so celebrated. The activity of the mormng hour was. visible every where Fbghts of doves and lapwings were fluttering among the leaves, and the white heron, which bad roovted all night m some date-tree, now
stood sunning its wmgs upon the green bank, or floated, hke bvmg sdver, over the flood The flowers, too, both of land and water, looked freshly awakened, —and, most of all, the superb lotus, which had nsen with the sun from the wave, and was now holding up her chalice foi a full draught of his light Such were the scenes that now passed before my eyes, and mingled with the revenes that floated through my mmd, as our boat, with its high, capacious sad, swept over the flood Though the occur¬ rences of the last few days appeared to me one series of wonders, yet by ur the most miraculous wonder of all was, that she, whose first look had sent wild-fire into my heart, —whom I had thought of ever smce with a restlessness of passion, that would have dared any tlung on earth to obtain its object,—was now sleeping sa¬ credly m that small pavilion, whde guard¬ ing her, even from myself, I lay calmly at its threshold. H
Meanwhde, the sun had reached his meridian. The busy hum ofthe mornmg liad died gradually away, and all around was sleeping in the hot stdlness of noon The Nile-goose, folding her splendid wings, was lying motionless on the shadow of the sycamores m the water Even the nimble lizards upon the bank seemed to move more languidly, as the bght fell upon theu* gold and azure hues Over¬ come as I was with watching, and weary with thought, it was not long before I yielded to the becalming influence of the hour. Looking fixedly at the pavilion, <— as if once more to assure my senses, that I was not already m a dream, but that the young Egyptian was really there, — I felt my eyes close as I looked, and in a few inmutes вивк into a profound sleep
CHAP. λΙΙ. It was by the canal through which we now sailed, that, m the more prosperous days of Memphis, the commerce of Upper Egypt and Nubia was transported to her magnificent Lake, and from thence, having paid tribute to the queen of cities, was poured out again, through the Nde, mto the ocean. The course of this canal to die river was not direct, but ascending m а south-easterly direction towards the Said, and m calms, or with adverse winds, the passage was tedious. But as the breeze was now blowing freshly from tbe north, there was every prospect of our reaching the nver before night-fall. Rapidly, too, as our galley swept along the flood, its motion was so smooth as to be hardly felt, and the quiet gurgle of the waters underneath, and the drowsy song of the H 2
boatman at the prow, alone disturbed the deep silence that prevailed. Ibe sun, indeed, had nearly sunk be hind the Libyan hüls, before the sleep, in which these sounds lulled me, was broken, and the first objec·, on which my eyes rested, ш waking, was that fair young Priestess,—seated under a porch by which the door of the pavilion was shaded, and bending intently over a snudi volume that lay unrolled on her lap Her face was but «half turned towards me, and as, once or twice, she raised her eyes to the warm sky, whose light fell, softened through the trellis, over her cheek, I found every feebng of reverence, with which she had inspired me m the chapel, return. There was even a purer and hober charm around her countenance, thus seen by the natural light of day, than in those dim and unhallowed regions be¬ low She could now, too, look direct to the glorious sky, and tbat heaven and her eyes, so worthy of each other, met
After contemplating her for a few mo¬ ments, with Uttle less than adoration, I rose gently from my resting-place, and approached the pavibon. But the mere movement had startled her from her de¬ votion, and, blushing and «confused, she covered the volume with the folds ofher robe. In the art of winning upon female con¬ fidence, I had long been schooled ; and, now that to the lessons of gallantry the inspiration of love was added, my ambition to please and to interest could hardly, it may be supposed, iad of success. I soon found, however, how much less fluent is the heart than the fancy, and how very distinct are the operatipné of malang love and feebng it In the few words of greeting now exchanged between us, it was evident that the gay, the enter¬ prising Epicurean was httle less em¬ barrassed than the secluded Priestess; — and, after one or two ineffectual efforts tb h 3
bring our voices acquainted with each other, the eyes of both turned bashfully away, and we relapsed into sdence. From this situation — the result of timidity on one side, and of a feebng altogether new, on the other — we were, at length, after an interval of es¬ trangement, relieved, by the boatmen announcing that the Nde was m sight The countenance of the young Egyptian brightened at this intelligence, and the smde with which I congratulated her on the speed of our voyage was answered by another, so full of gratitude, that already an instinctive sympathy seemed established between us We were now on the point of entenng that sacred nver, of whose sweet waters the exde drinks in hu dreams, — for α draught of whose flood the daughters of the Ptolemies, when wedded to foreign krogs, sighed Ш the midst of their splen¬ dour. As our boat, with slackened sail,
glided mto the current, an enquiry fin. m the boatmen, whether they should anchor for the night m the Nile, first reminded me of the ignorance, m which I still re¬ mained, with respect to either the motive or destination of our voyage Embarrassed by their question I directed my eyes towards the Priestess, whom I saw wait¬ ing for my answer with a look of anxiety, which this silent reference to her wishes at once dispelled Eagerly unfolding the volume with which I had seen her occu¬ pied, she took from its folds a small leaf of papyrus, on which there appeared to be some faint lmes of drawing, and after thoughtfully looking upon it, herself, for a moment, placed it, with an agitated hand, In the mean time, the boatmen had taken m their sail, and the yacht drove slowly down the nver with the current, while, by a light which had been kindled at sunset on the deck, I stood exammmg tbe leaf that the Priestess had given me, — her h 4
daik eyes fixed anxiously on my counte¬ nance all the while. The lines traced upon the papyrus were so faii.t as to be almost invisible, andı I was for some time at a loss to divine their import. At length, I could perceive that they were the outlines, or map — traced slightly and unsteadily with a Memphian reed—ofa part of thai moun¬ tainous ridge by which Upper Egypt is bounded to the east, together with the names, or rather emblems, of the chief towns in the neighbourhood. It was thither, I could not doubt, that the young Priestess wished to pursueher course. Without a moment's delay, therefore, I gave orders to the boatmen to set our yacht before the wind and ascend the cur¬ rent My command was promptly obeyed: the white sail again rose into the region of the breeze, and the satisfaction that beamed in every feature ofthe fair Egyp¬ tian showed that the quickness with which I had obeyed ber wishes was not unfelt by her. The moon had now risen; and
though the current waa against ns, the Etesian wind of the season blew strongly up the river, and we were soon floating before itv through the rich plain· and groves ofthe Said. The love, with which this simple girl had inspired me, was — possibly from the mystic scenes and situations in which I had seen her—not ujmiiiigleä with в tinge of superstitious awe, under the influ¬ ence of which I felt the buoyancy of my spirit checked. Tbe few words that had passed between us on the subject of our route had somewhat loosened tbis spell; and what I wanted of vivacity and confi¬ dence was more tban made up by the tone of deep sensibility which love bad awakened in their place. We had not proceeded tar beibre the glittering of lighta at a distance, and the ««hooting up of fireworks, at intervals, into the air, apprised us that we were approach¬ ing one of those night-fairs, or mart·, which it is the custom, at thii season, to и «
hold upon ihe -Nile. To me the scene *- was ¿st-unbar, but to my young companion it was evidently a new world, and the mixture of alarm and delight with which she gazed, from under her ved, upon the busy scene mto which we now suiled, gave an ear of шпосепсе to her beauty, which still more heightened its every charm It was one of the widest parts of the nver, and the whole surface, from one bank to the other, was covered with boats Along the banks of a green island, m the middle of tbe stream, «lay anchored the galleys of the principal traders, — large floating binare, beanng each the name of its owner, emblazoned m letters of flame, upon the stern Over their decks were spread out, m gay confusion, the producb of the loom and needle of Egypt, — neh carpets of Memphis, and those vanegated veik, for which the female embroiderers of the Nde are so celebrated, and to which the name of Cleopatra lends a traditional value, ín each of the other galleys was
exhibited some branch of Egyptian work¬ manship, — vases of die fragrant porcelain of On,—cups of that frail crystal, whose hues change like those of the pigeon's plumage,—enamelled amulets graven with the head of Ariubis, «and necklaces and bracelets of the black beans of Abyssinia. Wlule Commerce thus displayed her luxunes m one quarter, m every other direction Pleasure, multiplied uito her thou-sand shapes, swarmed over the waters. Nor was the festivity confined to the river only All along the banks of the island and on the shores, lighted up mansions were seen through the trees, from which «sounds of music and merriment came. In some of the boats were bands of minstrels, who, from tune to tune, answered each other, hke echoes, across the wave, and the notes of the lyre, the flageolet, and the sweet lotus-wood flute, were heard, m the pauses of revebrj, dying along the waters. Meanwhile, from other boats stationed h 6
ill «he Isast lighted ркмеа, the workers of ttn sent forth their wooden into the air. Bursting oat fiom time to time, as я" in Йастегу exuberance of joy, these »allies of «asme namai to reach the sky, and there beating into a shower of sparkles, shed sach s spleodour round, aa brightened •ven tbe white Arabian hills, — making tbem ahme Uke the brow sf Mount Atlas at night, when the fire from his own bosom ia playing around its snows. The opportunity which this luxurious ■nart aforded us, of providing ourselves with other and kas remarkable habiliments than those in which we bad escaped from that «tether world, was too seasonable not to he gladly taken advantage of by both. For myself, the strange mystic garb that I wore waa sufficiently concealed by my Grecian mantle, which I had luckily thrown round me on the night of my watch. But фе thm véu of my com¬ panion was a fár leas efficient disguise. • 8ht inai, aneet·) flung away the golden
beetles liom her baiti but the sacred robe of her order waa still too visible, and the stan of the bandelet abone brightly through her veil. Most gladly, therefore, did she «vail herself of this opportunity of a change; and, as she took ftom a casket—■which, with the volume I had seen her reading, appeared to be her only treasure — a small jewel, to exchange fiir the simple garments she had chosen, there fell out, at the same time, the very croas of silver, which I had seen her kiss, as may be remembered, in the monumental chapel, and which waa afterwards pressed to my own lips. This link (fbr such it appeared to my imagination) between ua, now re¬ vived in my heart all the burning feelmgs of that moment ¡ —and, had I not abruptly turned away, my agitation would, but too plainly, have betrayed itself. The object, for whieh we had delayed in this gay scene, bemg accomplished, the sail was again spread, and wa proeecded
on our course up the nvei The sounds and the lights we left behmd died gra¬ dually away, and we now floated along m moonbght and sdence once more Sweet dews, worthy of bemg called " the tears of Isis," fell through the air, and every plant and flower sent its fragrance to meet them Ihe wind, just strong enough to bear us smootldy agamst die current scarcely stirred the shadow of tlie tamarisks on the water As the inhabit¬ ants from all quarters were collected at the iught-fair, the Nile was more than usually stdl and solitary Such a silence, indeed, prevailed, that as we glided near the shore, we could hear the rustling of the acacias, as the chameleons ran up their stems. It was, altogether, a night auch as only the clime of Egypt can boast, when every thing bee lulled in diat son of bright tranquillity, wbich, we may ima¬ gine, shines over the sleep of those happy spinte, whp are supposed to rest m the Valley of the Moon, on their way to heaven
By such a light, and at such an hour, seated, side by side, on the deck of that bark, did we pursue our course up the lonely Nile — each a mystery to the other—our thoughts, our objects, our very names a secret,—separated, too, tdl now, by destinies so different, the one, a gay voluptuary of the Garden of Athens, the other, a secluded Pnestess of the Temples of Memphis, — and the only relation yet established between us being that dangerous one of love, passionate love, on one side, and the most femmme and confiding dependence on the other The passing adventure of the night- iair had not only dispelled shll more our mutual reserve, but bad supplied us with a subject on which we could converse without embarrassment From this topic I took care to lead on, with¬ out interruption, to others, — fearful lest our former sdence should return, and the music of her л oice again be bet to me. It was, mdeed, only by thus
indirectly unburdening my heart that I vias enabled to refrain from the full utter- awe of all J thought and felt ; and the restless rapidity with which I flew from subject to subject wu but an effort to escape from the only one in which my heart was Interested. " How bright and. happy," said I, — pointing up to Sothis, the fair Star of the Watera, which was just then sparkling brilliantly over our heads, — " How bright and happy this world ought to be, if—aa your Egyptian sages assert —yon pure and beautiiul luminary was Ha birth-star f Then, still leaning back, and letting my eyes wander over the firmament, as if seeking to disengage them from the ràsoination which they dreaded—" To the study (I said), for ages, of skiea like thii, may the pensive (nd mystic character of your nation be tand. That mixture of pride and me¬ lancholy which naturally arises, at the sight of those eternal lights shining out of dark-
nesa ¡— L that subhme, but saddaned, antici¬ pation ofa Future, which comes over the soal m the sdence of such an hour, when, though Death seems to reign m the герои of earth, there are those beacons of Im¬ mortality bummg ш the sky —" Pausing, as 1 uttered the word " im¬ mortality," with a sigh to think how httle my heart echoed to my Ups, I looked m the face of the maiden, and saw that it had lighted up, as I spoke, mto a glow of holy ammaaon, such aa Faith alone gives —such as Hope herself wears, when she is dreaming of heaven. Ί ouched by the contrast, and gazing upoD her with mourn¬ ful tenderness, 1 found my arms half opened, to clasp her to my heart, while the words died away maudtbly upon my hps,—" thou, too, beautiful maiden I must thou, too, die for ever Ì" My »elf-command, I felt, had nearly deserted me. Ruing abruptly from my seat, I walked to the middle of tbe deck, and stood, for some momenta, uncon-
sciously gazing upon one of those fires, which, —-as is the custom of all who travel by night upon the Nde,—our boatmen had just kindled, to scare away the crocodiles from the vessel But it was in vam that I endeavoured to compose my spint Kvery eflbrt I made but more deeply convinced me, that, tdl the mystery which hung round that maiden should be solved —till the secret, with which my own bosom laboured, should be disclosed—it was fruitless to attempt even a semblance of tranquillity My resolution was therefore taken, — to lay open, at least, my own heart, as far as euch a revelation might be risked, without startling the timid innocence of my companion. Tbus resolved, I returned, with more composure, to my seat by her side, and takmg from my bosom tlie small mirror which she had dropped m the Temple, and which I had ever since worn suspended round my neck, with a ¡trembling hand presented it to her view Tbe boatmen had just kmdled one of their
night-fires near us, and its light, as she leaned forward towards the mirror, fell on her face The quick blush of surprise with which she recognised it to be hers, and her look of bashful, yet eager, inquiry, m raising her eyes to nune, were appeals to which I was not-, of course, slow m answering Beginning with the first moment when I saw her m the Temple, and passing hastily, but with words that burned as they went, over the impression which she had then left; upon my heart and fancy, I proceeded to describe the particulars of my descent mto the pyramid — my sur prise and adoration at the door of the chapel — my encounter with the Tnals of Initiation, so mysteriously prepared for me, and all the various visionary wonders I had witnessed m that region, till the moment when I had seen her stealing from under the Veils to approach me Though, m detadmg these events, 1 had said but httle of the feelings they had
awakened in me, — though my lips had sent back many a sentence, unuttered, there was stdl enough that could neither be subdued or disguised, and which, like that hght from under the veds of her own Isis, glowed through every word that I spoke. When I told of the scene m the chapel,—of the sdent interview which I had witnessed between the dead and the laving,—the maiden leaned down her bead and wept, as from a heart ñul of tears It seemed a pleasure to her, however, to listen { and, when she looked at me again, there was an earnest and affec¬ tionate cordiality in her eyes, as ď the knowledge of my havmg been present at that mournful scene had opened a new source of sympathy and intelligence be¬ tween-ns So neighbouring are the foun¬ tains of Love and of Sorrow, and so imperceptibly do they often mingle their streams. Little, indeed, as I was guided by art or desigli, ш шу manner and conduct to
this innocent girl, not all the most ex¬ perienced gallantry of the Garden could have dictated a policy half so seductive as that which my new master, Love, now taught me. The ardour whiih, shown at once, and without reserve, might bave startled a heart so little prepared for it, thus checked and softened by the ti¬ midity of real love, won its way without alarm, and, when most diffident of suc¬ cess, most triumphed Like one whose sleep is gradually broken by music, the maiden's heart was awakened without be¬ ing disturbed She followed the charm, unconscious whither it led, nor was aware of the flame she had lighted m another's bosom, till she perceived the reflection of it glimmering m her own Impatient as I was to appeal to her generosity and sympathy, for a similar proof of confidence to that which I had just given, the night was now too far advanced for me to impose such a tosk upon her After exchanging a few words,
in which, though httle was said, there was a tone and manner that spoke far more than language, we took a lingenng leave of each other for the night, with every prospect of still bemg together m our dreams
CHAP. XIII It was so near the dawn of day when we parted, that we ogam found the sun sink¬ ing westward when we rejoined each other. The smile with which she met me, — so frankly cordial, — nught have been taken for the greeting of a long mellowed friendship, did not the blush and the cast- down eyelid, that followed, give symptoms of a feeling newer and less calm. For myself, lightened as I was, ш some degree, by the confession which I had made, I was yet too conscious of the new aspect thus given to our intercourse, to feel al¬ together unembarrassed at the prospect of returning to the theme. It was, there¬ fore, willingly we both suffered our atten¬ tion to be diverted, by the variety of objects that presented tliemselves on the way, from α subject that both equally trembled to approach.
lhe nver was now full of hfe and motion. .Every moment we met with boats descending the current, so inde¬ pendent of aid from sad or oar, that the sailors sat idly upon the deck as they shot along, singing or playing upon their double-reeded pipes. Of these boats, the greater number came loaded with merchandise from Coptos, — some with those large emeralds, from the mme in the desert, whose colours, it is said, are brightest at the full of the moon, and some laden with frankincense from the acacia-groves near the Red Sea. On the decks of others, that had been to the Golden Mountains beyond Syene, were heaped blocks and fragments of that sweet-smell¬ ing wood, which the Green Nile of Nubia washes down m the season of the floods Our companions up the stream were far less numerous. Occasionally α boat, returning hghtened from the fair of last night, with those high sads that catch every breez from over the hüls, shot past
us, — whde, now and then, we overtook one of those barges full of bees, that at this season of the year, are sent to co¬ lonise the gardens of the south, and take advantage of the first flowers after the inundation has passed away By these various objects we were, for a short time, enabled to divert the convers¬ ation from lighting and settimg upon the one subject, round which it continually hovered But the effort, as might be ex¬ pected, was not long successful. As even¬ ing advanced, the whole scene became more solitary We less frequently ventured to look upon each other, and our interval.» of silence grew more long It was near sunset, when, in passing a small temple on the shore, whose poi- Ucoes were now full of the evening light, we saw, issuing from a thicket of acan¬ thus near it, a train of young maids linked together in the dance by lotus- stems, held at arms' length between them Their tresses were also wreathed
with this emblem of the season, and such a profusion of the white flowers were twisted round their waists and arms, that they might have been taken, as they gracefully bounded along the bank, for Nymphs of the Nde, risen freshly from then* gardens under the wave. After looking for a few moments at this sacred dance, the maid turned away her eyes, with a look of pain, as if the re¬ membrances it recalled were of no welcome nature. This momentary retrospect, this glimpse into the past, seemed to offer a sort of clue to the secret for which I panted; —and, gradually and delicately as my impatience would allow, I availed myeelf of it Her frankness, however, saved me the embarrassment of much questioning. She even seemed to feel that the confidence I sought was due to me, and beyond the natural hesitation of maidenly modesty, not a shade of reserve 01 evasion appeared. To attempt to repeat, u her own
touching words, the simple story which she now related to me, would be bke en¬ deavounng to note down some strain of unpremeditated music, with those fu¬ gitive graces, those felicities of the mo¬ ment, which no art can restore, as they first met the ear. From a feelmg, too, of humility, she had omitted m her narra¬ tive some particulars relating to herself, which I afterwards learned,—whde others, not less important, she but slightly passed over, from a fear of wounding the pre¬ judices ofher heathen hearer I shall, therefore, give her story, as the outline which she, hersell, sketched was afterwards filled up by a pious and ve¬ nerable hand, —far, far more worthy than mine of bemg associated with the memory of such purity

STORY OF ALÊTHE " The mother of this maiden was die beautiful Theora of Alexandria, who, though a native of that city, was descended from Grecian parents When very young, Theora was one of the seven maidens selected, to note down tfae discourses of the eloquent Ongen, who, at that period, presided over th? School of Alexandna, and was in all the fulness of his fame, both among Pagans and Christians Endowed nchly with the learning of both creeds, he brought the natural light of philosophy to elucidate the mystenes of faith, and was only proud of his knowledge of tht wisdom of this world, inasmuch as it mi¬ nistered to the triumph of divme truth " Though he had courted m vam the crown of martyrdom, it was held, through¬ out his life, suspended over his head, and in more than one persecution, he had evinced his readiness to die for that faith wluth ht
hved but to testify and adorn On one of these occasions, his tormentors, having ha¬ bited him like an Egyptian pnest, placed hun upon the steps of the Temple of Sera- pis, and commanded that he should, m the manner of the Pagan ministers, present palm-branches to the multitude who went up to the shrine Bpt the courageous Christian disappomted their views Hold¬ ing forth the branches with an unshrinking hand, he cried aloud, ' Come hither and take the branch, not of an Idol Temple, but of ChriBt·' " So indefatigable was this learned Father m his studies, that, while compos¬ ing his Commentary on the Scriptures, he was attended by seven scribes or notanes, who relieved each other m takmg down the dictates of his eloquent tongue, whde the same number of young females, selected for the beauty of their penmanship, were employed m arranging and transcribing the precious leaves. " Among the scribes so selected, was the ι 3
flur young Theora, whose parents, though attached to the Pagan worship, were not unwilling to profit by the accomplishments of their daughter, thus devoted to a task which they considered purely mechanical To the maid herself, however, her task brought far otber feelmgs and conse¬ quences. She read anxiously as she wrote, and the divine truths, so eloquently illus¬ trated, found their way, by degrees, from the page to her heart Deeply, too, as the written words affected her, the discourses from the bps of the great teacher himself, which she had frequent opportunities of heanng, sunk still more deeply moo her mind There was, at once, a sublimity and gentle¬ ness m his views of religion, which, to the tender hearts and bvely imaginations of women, never faded to appeal with con¬ vincing power Accordingly, the list of his female pupils was numerous, and the names of Barbara, Juhana, Herais, and others, bear honourable testimony to his influence ov ι that sex.
" To Theora the feeling, with which his discourses inspired her, was like a new soul, —a consciousness of spintila! existence, unfelt before By the eloquence of the comment she was awakened mto admiration ofthe text, and when, by the kindness of a Catechumen of the school, who had been struck by her innocent zeal, she, for the first time, became possessor of a copy of the «Scriptures, she could not sleep for thinking of her sacred treasure With a mixture of pleasure and fear she hid it from all eyes, and was hke one who had received a divine guest under her roof, and felt fearful of betraying its divinity to the world " A heart so awake would have been easily secured to the faith, had her oppor¬ tunities of hearing the sacred word con¬ tinued. But circumstances arose to de¬ pnve her of this advantage The nuld Ongen, long harassed and thwarted m his labours by the tyranny of the Bishop of Alexandria, Demetrius, wae obliged to
relinquish his school and fly from Egypt Hie occupation of the fair sanbe was, therefore, at an end her intercourse with the followers of the new faith ceased, and the growing enthusiasm of her heart gave way to more worldly impressions " Love, among the rest had its share in alienating her thoughts from religion Whde still very young, she became the wife of a Greek adventurer, who had come to Egypt as a purchaser of that rich tapestry, m which the needles of Persia are rivalled by the looms of the Nde Having taken his young bnde to Memphis which was stdl the great mart of this merchan due, be there, m the midst of his specu lations, died, — leaving his widow on the point of becoming a mother, whde, as jet bat ш her nineteenth year " For single and unprotected females, it has been, at all tunes, a favounte resource, to seek admusion mto the service of some o t those great temples, which absorb so much ofthe wealth and power of Egypt Inmost
of these mstitutions there exists an order of Pnestesses, which, though not hereditary, like that of the Pnests, is provided fbr by ample endowments, and confers that rank and station, with which, m a government ьо theocratic, Religion is sure to invest even her humblest handmaids From the general policy of the Sacred College of Memphis, it may be concluded, that an accomplished female, like Theora, found but little difficulty in bemg chosen one of the Pnestesses of Isis , and it was m the service of the subterranean shrines that her ministry chiefly lay 1 Here, a month or two after her admis¬ sion, she gave birth to Alethe, who first opened her eyes among the unholy pomps and specious miracles of this mystenous region Though Theora, as we have seen, had been diverted by other feelmgs from her first enthusiasm for the Christian faidi, she had never wholly forgot the impression then made upon her The sacred volume, which the pious Catechu- i 5
men had given her, was still treasured with care, and, though she seldom opened its pages, there was an idea of sanctity as¬ sociated with it m her memory, and often would she sit to look upon it with reveren¬ tial pleasure« recalling the happmess she felt when it was first made her own " lbe leisure of her new retreat and the lone melancholy of widowhood, led her etili more frequently to mdulge in such thoughts, and to recur to those con¬ soling truths which she had heard in the school of Alexandria. She now began to peruse eagerly the sacred book, dnnk¬ ing deep of the fountain of which she be¬ fore but tasted, and feelmg — what thou sands of mourners, smce her, have felt — that Christianity is the true religion of the sorrowful. " This Itudy of her secret hours became still more dear to her, from the perd with which, at that penod, it was attended, and the necessity she was under of concealing firam those around her the precious hght
that had been kindled m her heart Too timid to encounter the fierce persécution, which awaited all who were suspected of a leanmg to Christianity, she continued to officiate m the pomps and ceremonies of the Temple, — though, often, with such remorse of soul, that she would pause, m the midst of the rites, and pray inwardly to Ood, that he would forgive this pro¬ fanation of his Spirit " In the mean tune her daughter, the young Alethe, grew up still lovelier than herself, and added, every hour, to her happiness and her fears When ar¬ rived at a sufficient age, she was taught, like the other chddren of the pnestesses, to take a share m the service and cere momes of the shrines The duty of some of these young servitors was to look after the flowers for the altar, — of others, to take care that the sacred vases were filled every day with fresh water from the Nde. Ibe task of some was to preserve, m per¬ fect polish, those sdver imagea of the moon ι 6
which the priests earned m processions, whde others were, as we have seen, em¬ ployed ш feeding the consecrated animals, and ш keeping their plumes and scales bright, for the admiring eyes of then wor¬ shippers. " The office allotted to Alethe —the most honourable of these mmor ministries — was to wait upon the sacred birds ot the Moon, to feed them with those eggs from the Nde which they loved, and pro¬ vide fbr their use that purest water, which alone these delicate birds will touch This employment was the delight of her chflduh hours, and that ibis, which At ciphron (the Epicurean) saw her dance round m the Temple, was her favourite, of all the sacred flock, and had been dady fondled and fed by her from infancy " Music, as being one ofthe chief spells of this enchanted region, was an accom¬ plishment required of all its ministrante , and the harp, the lyre, and the sacred flute, sounded nowhere so sweetly as that
through these subterranean gardens The chitf object indeed, m the education of the youth of the Temple, was to fit them, by every grace of art and nature, to give efiect to the illusion of those shows and phantasms, in which the whole charm and secret of Initiation lay " Among the means employed to sup¬ port the old system of superstition, against tlie infidelity and, stdl more, the new Faith that menaced it was an increased display of splendour and marvels m those Mysteries for which Egypt has so long been celebrated Of these ceremonies so many imitations had, under vanous names, been multiplied through Europe, that the jiarent superstition ran a ruk of being eclipsed by its progeny and, m order still to retain their rank of the first Priest¬ hood m the world, those of Egypt found it necessary to continue süli the best im¬ postors " Accordingly, every contrivance that art could devise, or labour execute—every
resource that the wonderful knowledge of the Priests, ш pyrotechny, mechanics, and dioptrics, could command, was brought into action to heighten tbe efiect of their Mysteries, and give an air of enchantment to every thing connected with tliem " The final scene of beatification — the Elysium, mto which the Initiate was re¬ ceived,—formed, of course, the leadmg attraction of these ceremonies, and to render it captivating alike to the senses of the man of pleasure, and the imagination of the spiritualist, was the object to which the whole skill and attention of the Sacred College were devoted. By the influence of the Priests of Memphis over those of the other Temples they had succeeded in extending their subterranean frontier, both to the north and south, so as to include, withm their ever-lighted Paradise, some of the gardens excavated for the use of the other Twelve Shrines. " The beauty of the young Alethe, the touching sweetness of her voice, and the
sensibility that breathed throughout her every look and movement, rendered her a poweriul auxiliary m such appeals to the imagination. She was, accordingly, from her childhood, selected from among her fair companions, as the most worthy represent¬ ative of spiritual loveliness, in those pic¬ tures of Elysium—those scenes of another world—by which not only the fancy, but the reason, of the excited Aspirants uas dazzled. " To the mnocent chdd herself these shows were pastime. But to Theora, who knew too well the imposition to which they were subservient, this profanation of all that she loved was a perpetual source of horror and remorse. Often would she — when Alethe stood smibng before her, arrayed, perhaps, as a spirit of the Elysia» world,—turn away, with a shudder, from tbe happy child, almost fancyuig that she already saw the shadows of sm descend¬ ing over that innocent brow, as she gazed on it.
" As the mtellect of the young maid became more аспте and inquiring, the ap¬ prehensions and difficulties of the mother increased. Afraid to communicate her own precious secret, lest she should in¬ volve her child m the dangers that en¬ compassed it, she yet felt it to be no less a cruelty than a crime to leave her wholly nnmersed m the darkness of Paganism In thu düemma, the only resource that remained to her was to select, and dis¬ engage from the dross that surrounded them, those pure particles of truth which he at the bottom of all religions, — those feelings, rather than doctrines, which God has never left his creatures without, and which, m all ages, have furnished, to those who sought it, some clue to his glory " The unity and perfect goodness of the Creator, the fall of the human soul into corruption , its struggles with the dark¬ ness of thu world, and its final redempUon and re-ascent to the source of all spmt,— these natural solutions of the problem of
our existence, these elementary grounds of all religion and virtue, which Theora had heard illustrated by her Chnstian teacher, lay also, she knew, veiled under the theology of Egypt, and to impress them, in all their abstract purity, upon the mmd of her susceptible pupil, was, in default of more heavenly lights, her sole ambition and care " It was their habit, after devoting their mornings to the service of the Temple, to pass their evemngs and nights in one of those small mansions above ground, allotted to some of the most fav« ured Pnestesses, m the precincts of the Sacred College Here, out of the reach of those gross su¬ perstitions, which pursued them, at every step below, she endeavoured to inform, as far as she might, the mind of her be¬ loved girl, and found it lean as naturally and instinctively to truth, as plants that have been long shut up m darkness will, when light is let in, melme themselves to its ray
"Frequenûy, as they sat together on the terrace at mght, contemplating that as sembly of glorious stars, whose beauty first misled mankind mto idolatry, she would explain to the young listener by what gradations it was that the worship, thus transferred from the Creator to the creature, sunk lower and lower m the scale of bemg, tdl man, at length, pre¬ sumed to deify man, and by the most monstrous of inversions, heaven was made the mirror of earth, reflecting all its most earthly features. " Even m the Temple itself, the апхюив mother would endeavour to interpose her purer lessons among the idolatrous cere¬ monies m which they were engaged When the favounte ibis of Alethe took its station on the shnne, and the young maiden was seen approaching, with all the gravity of worship, the very bird which she had played with but an hour before, — when the aca- aa-bough, which she herself had plucked, seemed to acquire a sudden sacredness m
her eyes, as soon as the pnest had breathed on it, — on all such occasions Theora, though with fear and tremblmg, would venture to suggest to the youthful wor¬ shipper the distinction that should be drawn between the sensible object of ador¬ ation, and that spiritual, unseen Deity, of which it was but the remembrancer or type " With sorrow, however, she soon dis¬ covered that, m thus but partially enlight¬ ening a mmd too ardent to be satisfied with such glimmerings, she only bewil¬ dered the heart that she meant to guide, and cut down the hope round which its faith twmed, without substituting any other support m its place As the beauty, too, of Alethe began to attract all eyes, new fears crowded upon the mother's heart, — fears, m which she was but too much justified by the characters of some of those around her "In this sacred abode, as may easdy be conceived, morality did not always
go hand m hand with religion. The hy¬ pocritical and ambitious Orcue, who was, at this penod, High Pnest of Memphis, was a man, m every respect, qualified to preside over a system of such splendid fraud He had reached that effective tune of life, when enough of the warmth of youth remains to give animation to the counsels of age But, m his instance, youth had only the baser passions to be queath, whde age but contributed a more refined matunty of mischief The advon tages ofa faith appealing so wholly to the senses, were well understood by him, nor was he ignorant that the only way of mak ing religion subservient to bis own interests was by ehaping it adroitly to the passions of others Tbe suite of misery and remorse m which the nund of Theora was kept by the scenes, however veiled by hypocrisy which she witøessed around her, became at length mtolerable. No penis that the cause of truth could bnng with it would
be half so dreadful as this endurance of sinfulness and deceit. Her child was, as yet, pure and innocent, — but, without that sentinel of the soul, Religion, how long might she continue so ? " This thought at once decided her, — all other fears vanished before it She resolved instantly to lay open to Alethe the whole secret of her soul, to make her, who was her only hope on earth, the sharer of all her hopes m heaven, and then fiy with her, as soon as possible, from this unhallowed place, to the desert — to tlie mountains — to any place, however desolate, where God and the conscious¬ ness of innocence might be with them " The promptitude with which her young pupd caught from her the dmne truths, was even beyond what she expected It was like the lighting of one torch at another,—so prepared was Alethe's mmd for the illumination Amply was the mother now repaid for all her misery, by this perfect communion of love and fatth,
and by the dehght with which she saw her beloved chdd — like the young an¬ telope, when Iirst led by her dam to the well,—drink thirstily by her side, at the source of all life and truth. " But such happiness was not long to last The anxieties that Theora hod suffered preyed upon her health She felt her strength daüy decime, and the thoughts of leaving, alone and unguarded m the world, that treasure which she had just devoted to heaven, gave her a feelmg of despair which but hastened lhe ebb of life. Had she put m practice her resolu¬ tion of flying from this place, her child might have been now beyond the reach of all she dreaded, and m the solitude of the wilderness would have found at least safety from wrong But the very happiness she had felt m her new task diverted her from this project,— and it was now too late, for she was already dying.
" She concealed, however, her state from the tender and sanguine girl, who, though she saw the traces of disease on her mo¬ ther s cheek, little knew that they were the hastening footsteps of death, nor thought even oí the possibility of losmg what was so dtar to her Too soon, however, the moment of separation arnved, and while the anguish and dismay of Alethe were m proportion to the security m which she had indulged, Theora, too, felt, with bitter regret, that she had sacri¬ ficed to her fond consideration much pre¬ cious tune, and that there now remained but a few brief and painful moments, for the communication of all those wishes and instructions, on which the future destiny of the young orphan depended " She had, mdeed, tune for little more than to place the sacred volume solemnly in her hands, to implore that she would, at all risks, fly from this unholy place, and, pointing m the direction of the moun¬ tains of the Said, to name, with her last
breath, the holy man, to whom, under heaven, she trusted for the protection and salvation ofher chdd. " The first violence of feeling to which Alethe gave way was succeeded by a fixed and tearless grief, which rendered her in¬ sensible, for some tune, to the dangers of her situation. Her only comfort was in visitmgthat monumental chapel, where the beautiful remains of Theora lay fheie, night after night, in contemplation of those placid features, and in prav ere for the peace of the departed spirit, did she pass her lonely, and — sad as they were — happiest hours Though the mystic emblems that decorated that diapel were but ill suited to the slumber of a Christian saint, there was one among them, the Cross, which, by a remarkable coincidence, is an emblem common alike to the Gentile and the Christian, — being, to the former, a shadowy type of thut immortabty, of which, to the latter, it is a substantial and assuring pledge
"Nightly, upon this cross, which slie had often seen her lost mother kiss, did she breathe forth a solemn and heartfelt vow, never to abandon the faith which that departed spirit had bequeathed to her To suoh enthusiasm, mdeed, did her heart at such moments rise, that, but Ibr the last injunctions from those palhd hps, she would, at once, have avowed her perilous «secret, and snoken out the words, * I am a Christum,' among those benighted shrines 1 " But the will ofher, to whom she owed more than hfe, was to be obeyed. To escape from this haunt of superstition must now, she felt, be her first object, and, ш devising the means of effecting it, her mmd, day and night, was employed. It was with a loathing not to be con¬ cealed she now found herself compelled to resume her idolatrous services at the shrine. To some of the offices of Theora she succeeded, as is the ntstom, by lnhe· пласе , and in the performance of these
— sanctified as they were m her eyes by die pure epifit she had seen engaged in them — there was a sort of melancholy pleasure m which her sorrow found re¬ lief But the part she was agam forced to take, m the sceme shows of the Mys¬ tenes, brought with it a sense of wrong and degradation which she could no longer bear. " She had already formed, m her own mind, a plan of escape, ш which her knowledge of all the windings of this subterranean realm gave her confidence, when the reception of Alciphron, as an Initiate, took place. " From the first moment of the landing of that philosopher at Alexandna, he had decome an object of suspicion and watch¬ fulness to the mquisitonal Orcus, whom phdosophy, in any shape, naturally alarm ed, but to whom the sect over which the young Athenian presided was particu¬ larly obnoxious. The accomplishments of Alciphron, hu populanty, where\er he
went, and the freedom with which he indulged his wit at the expense of're¬ ligion, was all faithfully reported to the High Priest by his spies, and surred up within him no kindly feelmgs towards the stranger ln dealmg with an mfidel, such a personage as Orcus could know no alternative but that of either converting or destroying him, and though his spite, as a man, would have been more gratified by the latter proceeding, his pnde, as a priest, led him to prefer the tnumph of the former. " The first descent ofthe Epicurean mto the pyramid was speeddy known, and the alarm immediately given to the Priests below As soon a& it was discovered that tbe young philosopher of Athens was the intruder, and that he stdl continued to linger round the pyramid, looking often and wistfully towards the portal, it was concluded tliat his curiosity would impel him to try a second descent, and Orcus, blessing the good chance which had thus к 2
brought the wdd bird to his net, deter¬ mined not to allow an oppoitumty so precious to be wasted " Instantly, the whole of that wonderful mechmery, by which the phantasms and illusions of Initiation are produced, were put ш active preparation throughout that subterranean reahn, and the mcreased stir and watchfulness excited among its inmates, by this more than ordinary display of ail the resources of pnestcraft, rendered the accomplishment of Alethe'b design, at such a moment, peculiarly dif ficult Wholly ignorant of the share which had fallen to herself ш attracting tbe young phuosopher down to this re¬ gion, she but heard of him vaguely, аь ďie Chief of agreat Grecian sect, who had been led, by either cunosity or accident, to expose himself to the first tnals of Ini¬ tiation, and whom the priests, she saw, were eedeavourmg to ensnare in then tods, by every art and skill with which thetr science of darkness had gifted them
" To her nnnd, the image of a philoso¬ pher, such as Alciphron had been re¬ presented to ner, came associated with ideas of age and reverence, and, more than once, the possibility of his bemg made instrumental to her deliverance flashed a hope across her heart m which she could not help indulging Often had she been told by Theora of the many Gentile sages, who had laid their wisdom down humbly at the foot ofthe Croa, and though this Initiate, she feared, could hardly be among the number, yet the ru¡- mours which she had gathered from the servants of the Temple, of his undis¬ guised contempt for the errors of hea¬ thenism, led her to hope she might And tolerance, if not sympathy, m her Appeal to him " Nor was it solely with « view to mer own chance of deliverance that she Ûms connected hnn m her thoughts wnli plan which she meditated. The look of к ii
proud and self-gratulatmg malice, with which the High Priest had mentioned this ' mfidel/ as he styled him, when m struchng her m tne scene she was to enact before the philosopher m the valley, but too plainly informed her of the des¬ tiny that bung over hnn She knew how many were the hapless candidates for Innubon, who had been doomed to a durance worse than that of the grave, for but a word, a whisper breathed against the sacred absurdities which they wit nessed, and it was evident to her that the venerable Greek (for such her fancy represented Alciphron) was no less in¬ terested m escaping from this region than herself " Her own resolution was, at all events, fixed. That visionary scene, m which she had appeared before Alciphron, —little knowing how ardent were the heart and unagmabon, over which her beauty, at that moment, shed its whole influence, — was, she solemnly resolved, the very last un
holy service, that superstition or impos¬ ture should ever command of her. " On the following night the Aspirant was to watch m the Great Temple of Isis Such an opportunity of approaching and addressing him might never come again Should he, from compassion for her situation, or a sense of the danger of his own, consent to lend his aid to her flight, most gladly would she accept it, — assured that no danger or treachery she might risk could be half so dreadful as those she left behind. Should he, on the contrary, refuse, her determination was equally fixed — to trust to that God, who watches over the innocent, and go forth alone. " To reach the island ш Lake Mcens was her first object, and there occurred luckily, at this time, a mode of accom¬ plishing it, by which the difficulty and dangers of the attempt would be, in a great degree, diminished. The day of к 4
the annual visitation of the High Priest to the Place of Weeping — as that island in the centre of the lake is called — was now fast approaching, and Alethe well knew that the self-movmj car, by which the High Priest and one of the Hiéro¬ phante are conveyed to the chambers under the lake, stood waiting m readiness By availing herself of this expedient, she would gam the double advantage both of facilitating her own flight and re¬ tarding the speed of her pursuers " Having paid a last visit to the tomb of her beloved mother, and wept there, long and passionately, till her heart almost sadedin the struggle,—havmg paused, too, to give a kiss to her favourite ibis, which, though too much a Christian to worship, she was stul child enough to love, — with a tremblmg step she went early to the Sanctuary, and hid herself m one of the recesses of the Shnne. Her Intention was to steal out from thence to Alaphron, whde it was yet dark, and be-
fore the illumination л£ the great Statue behmd the Veds had begun. But her fears delayed her till it was almost too late, — already was the image bgbted up, and stdl she remamed trembling ш her hiding place. " In a few minutes more the mighty Veils would have been withdrawn, and the glories of that scene of enchantment laid open, — when, at length, summoning up courage, and taking advantage of a mo¬ mentary absence of those employed in the preparations of this splendid mockery, she stole from under the Ved and found her way, through the gloom, to the Epi¬ curean There was then no tune for explanation, — she had but to trust to the simple words, * Follow, and be sdent,' and the implicit readiness with which she found them obeyed filled her with no less surprise than the philosopher himself felt in heanng them " In a second or two they were on then- way through tbe subterranean wmdings, К 5
leaving the ministers of Isis to waste their splendours on vacancy, through a long senes of miracles and visions which they now exhibited, — unconscious that he, whom they took such pains to dazzle, was already, under the guidance of the young Christian, removed beyond the reach of their spells.*
CHAP XIV Such was the story, of which this innocent girl gave me, m her own touching language, the outline The sun was just rising as she finished her narrative Fearful of encountermg the expression of those feelings with which, she could not but observe, I was affected by her recital, scarcely had she concluded the last sentence, when, rising abruptly from her seat, she hurried into the pavi¬ bon, leavmg me with the words already crowding for utterance to my lips Oppressed by the various emotions, thus sent back upon my heart, I lay down on the deck m a state of agitation, that defied even the most distant approaches of sleep Whde every word she had к 6
uttered, every feeling she expressed, but ministered new fuel to that flame withm me, to desenbe which, passion is too weak a word, there was also much ofher recital that disheartened, that alarmed me To find a Christum thus under the garb of a Memphian Priestess, was a discovery that, had my heart been less deeply m terested, would but have more powerfully stimulated my imagination and pnde But, when I recollected the austenty of the faith she had embraced, — the tender and sacred tie, associated with it m her memory, and the devotion of woman ь heart to objects thus consecrated, — her very perfections but widened the distance between us, and all that most kindled my passion at the same tune chilled my hopes Were we left to each other, as on this sdent nver, m this undisturbed communion of thoughts and feelings, X knew too well, I thought, both her sex β nature and my own, to feel a doubt that love would m^nnately tnumph But the «verity of
the guardianship to which I must resign her, — some monk of the desert, some stern Sohtary, — the influence such a monitor would gam over her mind, and the horror with whicb, ere long, she would be taught to regard the reprobate mfidel on whom she now smiled,—^m all this prospect I saw nothing but despair After a few short hours, my happmess would be at an end, and such a dark chasm open between our fates, as must sever them, far as earth is from heaven, asunder It was true, she was now wholly in my power I feared no witnesses but those of earth, and the sobtude of the desert was at hand. But though I acknowledged not a heaven, I worshipped her who was, to me, its type and substitute If, at any mo¬ ment, a single thought of wrong or deceit, towards a creature so sacred, arose m my nund, one look from her innocent eyes averted the sacnlege Even passion it¬ self felt a holy fear ш her presence, —
like the flame trembling in the breeze of tbe sanctuary, — and Love, pure Love, stood m place of Religion As long as I knew not her story, I might indulge, at least, m dreams of the future But, now—what hope, what prospect re¬ mained ? My sole chance of happmess lay m the feeble hope of beguiling away her thoughts from the plan which she me¬ ditated, of weaning her, by persuasion, from that austere raitb, which 1 had before hated and now feared, and of— attaching her, perhaps, alone and unlinked as she was ω the world, to my own fortunes for ever ' In the agitation of these thoughts, 1 had started from my resting-place, and continued to pace up and down, under a burning sun, tdl, exhausted both by thought and feebng, I sunk down, amid its blaze, mto a sleep, which, to my fevered bram, seemed a sleep of fire. On awaking, I found the ved of Alethe
hud carefully over my brow, whde she, herself, sat near me, under the ahadow of the sad, looking anxiously at that leat which her mother had given her, and apparenüy employed m comparing its out¬ lines with the course of the nver and the forms of the rocky hills by which we passed She looked pale and troubled, and rose eagerly to meet me, as if she had long and impatiently waited for my waking Her heart, it was plain, had been dis¬ turbed from its security, and was begin¬ ning to take alarm at its own feelings. But, though vaguely conscious of the peni to which she was exposed, her reliance, as is usually the case, mcreased with her dan¬ ger, and on me, far more than on herself, did she depend for saving her from it To reach, as soon as possible, her asylum m the desert, was now the urgent object ofher entreaties and wishes, and the self- reproach she expressed at having permitted her thoughts to be diverted, for a eangle
moment, from this sacred purpose, not only revealed the truth, that she had forgotten it, but betrayed even a glimmering con- soousneas ofthe cause. Her sleep, she said, had been broken by ill-omened dreams Every moment tbe shade of her mother had stood be¬ fore her, rebuking her, with mournful looks, for her delay, and pointing, as she had done ш death, to the eastern hills Bursting mto tears at this accusing recol lecUon, she hastdy placed the leaf, which she had been examining, in my liands, and implored that I would ascertain, without a momenťs delay, what portion of our voyage was atdl rniperfonned, and m what space of tune we might hope to accomplish it. I had, still less than herself, taken note of either place or distance, and, had we been left to glide on m thu dream of hap¬ piness, «should never have thought of paus¬ ing tQtaak where it would end. But such confidence, I felt, was too sacred to be «dtţoaived. Reluctant as I was, naturaHy, to
enter on an inquiry, which might so soon dissipate even my last hope, her wuh was sufficient to supersede even the selfiehnese of love, and on the mstant I proceeded to obey her will There is, on the eastern bank of the Nde, to the north of AnUnoe, a high and steep rock, impending over the flood, which for ages, from a prodigy connected with it, has borne the name of the Moun¬ tain of the Buds Yearly, it is said, at a certain season and hour, large flocks of birds assemble ш the ravine, of which this rocky mountain forms one of the sides, and are there observed to go through the mysterious ceremony of inserting each its beak luto a particular cleft of the rock, till the cleft closes upon one of their num¬ ber, when the rest, taking wing, let ve the selected victim to die. Through the ravine where this charm —for such the multitude consider it — u worked, there ran, İn ancient times, a canal from the Nde, to some great and
forgotten city that now hes buned m the desert To a short distance from the river this canal stdl exists, but, soon after having passed through the defile, its scanty waters disappear altogether, and are lost under the sands. It was ш the neighbourhood of this place, as I could collect from the deline¬ ations on the \em£, — where a flight of birds represented the name of the moun· tain,—that the dwelhng of the Solitary to whom Alethe was bequeathed, lay Imperfect as was my knowledge of the geography of Egypt, it at once struck me, that we had long smce left this mountam behmd, and, on inquiring of our boat¬ men, I found my conjecture confirmed We had, indeed, passed it, as appeared, on the preceding mght, and, as the wind had, ever smce, blown strongly from the north, and the sun was already declining towards the horizon, we must now be, at least, an ordinary day's sad to the south ward of the spot.
At this discovery, I own, my heart felt a joy which I could with difficulty conceal It seemed to me as if fortune was conspiring with love, and, by thus delaying the moment of our separation, afforded me at least a chance of hap¬ pmess Her look, too, and manner, when informed of our mistake, rather encou¬ raged than chilled this secret hope In the first moment of astonishment, her eyes opened upon me with a suddenness of splendour, under which I felt my own wink, as if lightning had crossed them But she agam, as suddenly, let their lids fall, and, after a quiver of her bp, which showed the conflict of feeling widun, crossed her arms upon her bosom, and looked sdently down upon the deck, — her whole countenance tanking mto an expression, sad, but resigned, as ď she felt, with me, that fate was on the side of wrong, and saw Love already stealing between her soul and heaven I was not stow ш availing myself of
what I fancied to be the irresolution of her nitad, fint, fearful of exciting alarm by any appeal to tenderer feelings, I but adiireascd myself to her imagination, and to that Jove of novelty, which is for ever fresh in the youthful breast. We were now approaching that region of wonders, Thebes. " Ь a day or two," said I, "we shall see, towering above the watera, the colossal Avenue of Sphinxes, and the bright Obelisks of the Sun. We shall visit the plain of Meronen, and those mighty statues, that fling their sha¬ dows at sunrise over the Libyan hills. We shall hear tbe image of the Son of the Morning answering to the first touch of light From thence, in a few hours, a bréese Uke this will transport ns to those sanny Islands near the cataracts; there, to wander, amoiig the sacred palm- gnivesofPUilje, or sii, at noon-tide hour, in tban oool alcoves, which the waterfall, of Syene shadows under its arch. Oh, who, with snch soenes ef loveliness within
reach, would turn coldly away to the bleak desert, and leave this liar world, with all its enchantments, shining behind them, unseen and unenjoyed? At least," —I added, tenderly taking her by the hand, — " at least, let a few more days be stolen from the dreary fate to which thou hast devoted thyself, and then —— " She had heard but the last few words; — the rest had been lost upon her. Startled by the tone of tenderness, mto which, in spite of all my resolves, my voice had sofumed, she looked for an mstant m my face, with passionate earnestness, — then, dropping upon her knees with her clasped hands upraised, exclaimed — " Tempt me not, m the name of God I implore thee, tempt me not to swerve from my sacred duty. Oh, take me instandy to that de¬ sert mountain, and I will bless thee for ever." Thu appeal, I felt, could not be resisted, — though my heart were to break for ll. Having sdenti) expressed my assent to
her prayer, by a pressure of her hand as I raised her from the deck, I hastened, as we were still m full career for the south, to give orders that our sail should be mstantly lowered, and not a moment lost m retracing our course In proceeding, however, to give these directions, U, for the üret time, occurred to me, that, as I had hired this yacht m the neighbourhood of Memphis, where it was probable that the flight of the young fugitive would be most vigilantly tracked, we should act imprudently m betraying to the boatmen the plaoe of her retreat, —and the present seemed the most fa¬ vourable opportunity of evading such a danger Desiring, therefore, that we should be landed at a small village on the shore, under pretence of paying a visit to some shnne m the neighbour· hood, I there dismissed our barge, and was relieved from fear of further observation, by seeing it agam set sad, and resume its course fleetly up the current
From the boats of all descriptions that lay idle beside the bank, I now se¬ lected one, which, m every respect, suited my purpose,—being, m its shape and ac¬ commodations, a miniature of nur former vessel, but so small and light as to be manageable by myself alone, aqd, with the advantage of the current, requiring httle more than a hand t steer it Ibis boat I succeeded, without much difficulty, in purchasmg, and, after a short delay, we were ogam afloat down the current, —the sun just then sinking, in coiucious glory, over his own golden shrines in the Libyan waste Tlie evenmg was more calm and lovely than any that jet had smded upon our voyage, and, as we left the bank, there came boothmgly over our ears a strain of sweet, rustic melody from the shore. It was the voice of a young Nubian girl, whom we saw kneeling on the bank before an acacia, and singing, whde her companions stood round, the wild song
of invocation, which, ш her country, they address to that enchanted tree :— " Ob I AbymnUn tree, We pny,, we pray, to thee, By the glow of thy golden fruit, «And the nolet hue of thy flower, Kttà the greeting mute Of thy bough'i «lute To the atranger who мека thy bower *
II " Oh I Abytunun tree, How the traveller bleuet thee, Whea tbe night no moon alio s, Aad tbe *un-*et hour » near, And thou bend'it thy bought To Un hil browi, Saying, * Come reit thee here * Ob I Abytntian tree, Thut bow thy bead to me t'* • вее an aceount of this Mntttfee tree, which beadi down İta branche· to tfaoie wbo арртоасЬ a, iq M. Jomard'· Description of Byene and the Ca¬ taract·.
In the burden of this song the companions of the young Nubian joined, and we heard the words, " Oh ' Abyssinian tree," dying away on the breeze, long after the whole group had been lost to our eyes Whether, in this new arrangement which I had made for our voyage, any motive, besides those which I professed, had a share, I can scarcely, even myself, so bewddered were my feelings, determine But no sooner had the current borne us away from all human dwellings, and we were alone ori the waters, with not a soul near, than I felt how close'y such solitude draws hearts together, and how much more we seemed to belong to each other, than when there were eyes around The same feelmg, but without the same sense of its danger, was manifest m every look and word of Alethe The consciousness of the one great effort she had made appeared to have satisfied her heart on the score of duty, — white the devotedness with which she saw I
attended to her every wish, was felt with all that gratitude which, m woman, ь the day-spnng of love She was, there¬ fore, happy, innocently happy and the confiding, and even affectionate, unreserve of her manner, wlule it rendered my trust more sacred, made it also far more dif ficult It was only, however, on subjects un connected with our situation or fate, that she yielded to such interchange of thought, or that her voice ventured to answer mme. The moment I alluded to the destiny that awaited us, all her cheer fulness fled, and she became saddened and sdent When I descnbed to her th beauty of my own native land — its fount* of inspiration and fields of glory — hei eyes sparkled with sympathy, and some¬ times even softened mto fondness But when I ventured to whisper, that, m that glorious country, a life full of love and lfyerty awaited her, when I proceeded to contrast the adoration and bliss she
might command, with the gloomy austen- ties of the life to which she was hastening, — it was bke the coming ofa sudden cloud over a summer sky Her head sunk, as she listened, — I waited in vam for an answf r, and when, half playfully reproach¬ ing her for this sdence, I stooped to take her \ nnd, I could feel the warm tears fast falluig over it, But even this—little hope as it held out—was happiness. Though it fore¬ boded that I should lose her, it also whis¬ pered that I was loved Like that lake, m the Land of Roses*, whose waters are half sweet, half bitter, I felt my late to be a compound of bliss and pam, — but the very pam well worth all ordinary bliss And thus did the hours of that mght pass along, whde every moment shortened our happy dream, and the current seemed to flow with a swifter pace than any that * The province of Amnoe, now Fiotup X. 2
ever yet hurried to the sea. Mot a fea¬ ture of the whole scene but is, at this moment, freshly m my memory, — the broken star-light on the water,—the rippling sound of the boat, as, without oar or sail, it went, like a dung of en¬ chantment, down the stream,—the scented fire, burning beside ua on the deck, and, oh, that face, on which its light fell, still revealing, as it turned, some new charm, some blush or look, more beautiful than thelast Often, whde I sat gating, forgetful of all else ra this world, our boat, left wholly to itself, would drive from its course, and, bearing us to the bank, get entangled in the water-flowers, or be caught m some eddy, ere I perceived where we were Once, too, when the rustling of my oar among the flowers had startled away from tbe bank aome wild antetopes, that had stolen, at that still hour, to drink of the Nile, what an emblem I thought it of the
young heart beside me, — tasting, for the first time, of hope imd love, and so soon, alas, to be scared from their sweetness for ever í

CHAP XV The night was now far advanced, — the bend of our course towards the left, and the closing m of the eastern hills upon the nver, gave warning of our approach to the hermit's dwelhng Kvery mmute now seemed like the last of existence , and I felt a sinking of despair at my heart, which would have been intolerable, had not a resolution that suddenly, and as if by inspiration, occurred to me, presented a glimpse of hope which, m some degree calmed my feelmgs Much as I had, all my life, despised hy rjøcroy, — the very sect I had embraced bemg chiefly recommended to me by tiie war which they waged on the cant of all others,— it was, nevertheless, m hypocrisy that I now scrupled not to take refoge
from, what I dreaded more than shame or death, my separation from Alethe In my despair, I adopted the humiliating plan — deeply hunubatmg as I felt it to be, even amid the joy with which I wel¬ comed it — of offering myself to this hermit as a convert to his faith, and thus becoming the fellow-disciple of Alethe under his care! From the moment I resolved upon this plan, my spint felt lightened Though having fully before my eyes the labyrmth of imposture mto which it would lead me, I thought of nothing but the chance of our being süli together, — in this hope, all pnde, all philosophy was forgotten, and every thing seemed tolerable, but the pro¬ spect of losing her Thus resolved, it was with somewhat less reluctant feelmgs, tbat I now under¬ took, at the anxious desire of Alethe, to ascertain the site of that well-known moun¬ tain, m the neighbourhood of which the dwelling of the anchoret lay We had
already passed one or two stupendous rocks, which stood, detached, hke for tresses, over the nver's bnnk, and which in some degree, corresponded with the descnption on the leaf So Uttle was there of life now stirring along the shores, that I had begun almost to despair of any assistance fiOm inquiry, when, on lookmg to the western bank, I saw a boat man among the sedges, towing his small boat, with some difficulty, up the current Hading hnn, as we passed, I asked, " Where stands the Mountain of the Birds?" — and he had hardly time to answer, pointing aboveour heads, "There,* when we perceived that we were just then entenng mto the shadow, which this mighty rock flings across the whole of the flood. In & few moments we had reached the mouth of the ravme, of which the Mountam of the Birds forms one of the ndes, and through which the scant\ canal from the Nile flows At the sight
of this chasm, m some of whose gloomy recesses — if we had rightly interpreted the leaf — the dwellmg of the Sohtary lay, our voices, at once, sunk mto a low whisper, whde Alethe looked round upon me with a superstitious fearfulness, as if doubtful whether I had not already disappeared from her side A quick movement, however, of her hand towards the ravme, told too plainly that her purpose was still un¬ changed With my oars, therefore, check- mg the career of our boat, I succeeded, after no small exertion, m tunung it out of the current of the nver, and steering mto this bleak and stagnant canal Our transition from life and bloom to the very depth of desolation, was im¬ mediate Whde the water and one side of the ravine lay buried m shadow, the white, skeleton-like crags of the other stood aloft m the pale glare of moonlight. The sluggish stream through which we moved, yielded sullenly to the oar, and the shnek of a few water-birds, which we L 5
had roused from their fastnesses, was suc¬ ceeded by a silence, so dead and awful, that our lips seemed afraid to disturb it by a breath, and half-whispered exclamations, " How dreary !" — ** How dismal ! " — were almost the only words exchanged bet -een us We had proceeded for some ame through uns gloomy defile, when, at a distance before us, among the rocks on which the moonlight fell, we perceived, upon a ledge but httle elevated above the canal, a small hut or cave, which, from u tree or two planted around it, had some appearance of bemg the abode ofa human being. " Tbs, then," thought I, " is the home to which Alethe if destined *" — A chill of despair came again over my heart, and the oars, as I gazed, lay mo¬ tionless m my hands. I found Alethe, too, whose eyes had caught the same object, drawing closer to my side &an she had yet ventured Lay¬ ing her hand agitatedly upon mine,
" We must here," she said, '* part for ever" I turned to her, as she spoke, there was a tenderness, a despondency in her countenance, that at once sad¬ dened and inflamed my soul " Part ' " I exclaimed passionately, — " No · — the sari God shall receive us both. Thy faith, Alethe, shall, from this hour, be mme, and I wdl live and die in this desert with thee ! Her surprise, her delight, at these words, was hke а momentary delirium The wdd, anxious smile, with which she looked into my face, as if to ascertain whether she had, mdeed, heard ray words aright, bespoke a happiness too much for reason to bear At length the fulness of her heart found relief m tears, and, murmur¬ ing forth an incoherent blessmg on my name, she let her head fall languidly and powerlessly on my ann. The light from our boat-fire shone upon her face. I saw her eyes, which she had closed for a mo¬ ment, agam openmg upon me with the L б
same tenderness, and—merciful Provi¬ dence, how I remember that moment ! — was on the point of bending down my Ьрь towards hers, when, suddenly, m the шг above our heads, as if it came from hea¬ ven, there burst forth a stram from a chou* of voices, that with its solemn sweetness filled the whole valley Breaking away from my caress at these supernatural sounds, the maiden threw herself trembling upon her knees, and, not danng to look up, exclaimed wildly, " My mother, oh my mother I й It was the Christiana mormng hymn that we heard, — the same, as I learned afterwards, that, on their high terrace at Memphis, Alethe had been oñen taught by her mother to smg to tbe ruing sun Scarcely less startled than my compa¬ nion, I looked up, and, at the very sum nut of the rock above us, saw a light, appearing to come from a small opening or window, through which also the sounds, that had appeared to supernatural, issued
There could be no doubt, that we had now found—if not the dwelhng of the anchoret — at least, the haunt of some of the Christ¬ ian brotherhood of these rocks, by whose assistance we could not hid to find the place of his retreat. The agitation, mto which Alethe had been thrown by the first burst of that psalmody, soon yielded to the softening recollections which it brought back, and a calm came over her brow, such as it had never before worn, smce our meet¬ ing She seemed to feel that she had now reached her destined haven, and to hail, as the voice of heaven itself those sounds by which she was welcomed to it In her tranquillity, however, I could not now sympathize. Impatient to know all that awaited her and myself, I pushed our boat close to the base of the rock, — direcdy under that lighted wuidow on the summit, to find my way up to which was my first object. Havmg hastily received my instructions from Alethe,
and made her repeat agam the name of the Christian whom we sought, I sprang upon the bank, and was not long m dis¬ covering a sort of rude stair-way, cut out of the rock, but leadmg, I found, by easy wmdings, up the steep «After ascending for some time, I arrived at a level space or ledge, which the hand of labour had succeeded m converting mto a garden, and which was planted, here and there, with fig-trees and palms Around it, too, I could perceive, through the glimmering light, a number of small caves or grottos, mto some of which, human beings might find entrance, while others appeared no larger than the tomba of the Sacred Birds round Lake Mcens I was stdl, I found, but half-way up the ascent to the summit, nor could per¬ ceive any further means of continuing my course, as the mountam trom hence rose, almost perpendicularly, hke a wall At length, however, on exploring around, I disoovered behind the shade of a syca-
more a large ladder of wood, resting firmly against the rock, and affording an easy and secure ascent up the steep Havmg ascertained thus rar, I again descended to ihe boat for Alethe, — whom I found tremblmg already at her short solitude, — and having led her up the steps to this quiet garden, left her safely lodged, amid its holy sdence, while I pursued my way upward to the light on the rock At the top of the long ladder I found myself on another ledge or platform, somewhat smaller than the first, but planted in the same manner, with trees, and, aa I could perceive by the mingled light of mormng and the moon, embel¬ lished with flowers I was now near the summit, — there remained but another short ascent, and, as a ladder against the rock, as before, supplied the means of scaling it, I was m a few minutes at the opening from which the hght issued. I had ascended gently, u well from
a feebng of awe at the whole scene, as from an unwillingness to disturb too rudely the rites on which I mtruded My approach was, therefore, unheard, and an opportunity, during some moments, af¬ forded me of observing the group withm, before my appearance at the wmdow was discovered. In the middle of the apartment, which seemed once to have been a Pagan oratory, there was an assembly of seven or eight persons, some male, some female, kneeling m silence round я small altar, — while, among them, as if presiding over their ceremony, stood an aged man, who, at the moment of my arnval, was presenting to one of the female worshippers an alabaster cup, which she applied, with much reverence, to her hps. On the countenance of the venerable nunister, as he pronounced a short prayer oier her head, there was an expression of profound feebng that showed how wholly he was absorbed in that nte, and when
she had drank of the cup, — which I saw had engraven on its side the image of a head, with a glory round it, — the holy man bent down and kissed her forehead Afler this parting salutation, the whole group rose sdently from their knees, and it was then, for the first tune, that, by a cry of terror from one of the women, the appearance of a stranger at the wm dow was discovered. The whole assembly seemed startled and alarmed, except him, that supenor person, who, advancing from the altar, with an unmoved look, raised the latch of the door, which waa adjommg to the wmdow, and admitted me* There was, m this old man's features, a mixture of elevation and sweetness, of sunphaty and energy, which coiumanded at once attachment and homage, and half hoping, half feanng to find in him the destmed guardian of Alethe, I looked anxiously in his face, as I entered, and pronounced the name "Melaniui !" " Me¬ lanius İs my name, young etranger," he
answered, " and whether m friendship or m enmity thou comest, Melanius blesses thee." Thus saymg, he made a sign with his right hand above my head, whde, with mvoluntary respect, I bowed beneath the benediction " Let this volume," I replied, " answer for the peacefulness of my mission," — at the same tune, placing m his hands the copy of the Scripture», which liad been his own gift to the mother of Alethe, and which her chdd now brought as the credential of her claims on his protection At the sight of thu sacred pledge, which he recognized instantly, the solemnity that had marked his first reception of me softened mto tenderness Thoughts of other times seemed to pass through his mmd, and as, with a sigh of recollection, he took the book from my hands, some words on the outer leaf caught hu eye. They were few, — but contained, perhaps, the last wishes of the dying Theora, for as he eagerly read them over, I saw the tears m his aged eyes
и The trust," he said, with a faltenng voice, " is sacred, and God will, I hope, enable his servant to guard it fiuthfully ' Dunng this short dialogue, tbe other persons of the assembly had departed — being, as I afterwards learned, brethren from the neighbouring bank of the Nde, who came thus secretly before day break, to jom m worshipping God Fearful lest their descent down the rock might alarm Alethe, I hurned briefly over the fen words of explanation that remained, and, leaving the venerable Christian to follow at his leisure, hastened anxiously down to rejoin the maiden
CHAP XVI. Milanids was among the first of those Chnstians of Egyp,, who, after the recent example of the hermit, Paul, renounc¬ ing all the comforts of social existence, betook themselves to a lif" of contempla¬ tion m the desert. Less sellisti however, m hie piety, than most of these ascetics, Melanine forgot not the world, in leaving it He knew that mun was not born to live wholly for himself, that hie re¬ lation to human kind was that of the hnk to the chain, and that even his so- utude should be turned to the advantage of others. In flying, therefore, from the dm and disturbance of life, he sought not to place himself beyond the reach of its sympathies, but selected a retreat, where he could combine the advantage of soh-
tude with those opportunities of serang his fellow-men, which a neighbourhood to their haunts would afford That taste for the gloom of subterra¬ nean receeses, which the race of Misraun inherit from their Ethiopian ancestors, had, by hollowing out all Egypt into caverns and crypts, furnished these Christian anchorets with a choice of retreats Accordmgly, some found a shelter in the grottos of Elethya,— others, among the royal tombs of the Thebaid In the middle of the Seven Valleys, where the sun rarely shines, a few have fixed their dim and melancholy retreat, while others hav« sought the neighbourhood ofthe red Lakes of Nitria, and there, — like those Pagan soutanes of old, who dwelt among the palm-trees near the Dead Sea, — muse amid the sterility of nature, and seem to find, m her desolation, peace It was on one of the mountains of the Said, to the east of the nver, that
Melaniiu, as we have seen, chose his place of seclusion,—between the life and fertility of the Nile on the one side, and tha lone, dismal barrenness ofthe desert on die other. Half-way down tbis mountain, where it impenda over the ravine, he found a aeries of caves or grottos dug out of tbe rock, wbich had, in other times, ministered to tome purpose of mystery, but wbose use had been long forgotten, and tbeir recesses abandoned. To this place, after the banishment of hia great master, Origen, Melanius, with a few faithful followers, retired, and, by the example of hb innocent life, no less than by hi» fervid eloquence, succeeded in winning crowds- of converts to bis faith. Haced, as he was, in the neighbourhood of the rich city, Antinne, though he mingled not with its multitude, his name and huj fame were among them, and, to all who sought instruction or consolation, tbe «adl ofthe hermit was ever open. Notwithstanding the rigid abstinence of
his own habite, he was yet careful to pro¬ vide for the comforts of others. Con¬ tented with a rude bed of straw» hun- self; for the stranger he had always a less homely resting-place. From hu grotto, the wayfaring and the indigent never went unrefreshed, and, with the assistance of some of his brethren, he had formed gardens along the ledges of the mountain, which gave an air of cheerfulness to his rocky dwellmg, and suppbed him with the chief necessaries of such a climate, fruit and shade. Though the acquaintance which he had formed with the mother of Alethe, during the short period of her attendance at the school of Ongen, was soon interrupted, and never afterwards renewed, the interest which he had then taken m her late was too lively to be forgotten. He had seen the zeal with which her young heart welcomed instruction, and the thought that such a candidate for heaven should have reUpaed into idolatry, came often,
with disquieting apprehension, over his mind. It waa, therefore, with true pleasure, that, but a year or two before her death, he had learned, by a private communi¬ cation from Theora, transmitted through a Christian embahner of Memphis, that "not only her own heart had taken root in the faith, but that a new bud had flowered with the same divine hope, and that, ere long, he might we them both transplanted to the desert." The coming, therefore, of Alethe was lår less a surprise to him, than her coming thus alone was a shock and a sorrow ; and the silence of their meeting showed how deeply each remembered that thetiewhkh had brought them togetherwas no longer of tnis world, — that the hand, which should have been joined with theirs, waa in the tomb. I now saw that not even religion waa proof against the sadness of mortality. For, as the old man put the ringlets aaide from her forehead, and con-
templated in that clear countenance the reflection of what her mother had been, there was a mournfuïness mingled with his piety, as he said, " Heaven rest her soul 1 " which showed how httle even the certainty of a heaven for those we love can subdue our regret for having lost them on earth. Ibe full light of day had now risen upon the desert, and our host, reminded, by the fiunt looks of Alethe, of the many anxious hours we had passed without sleep, proposed that we should seek, m the chambers of the rock, such rest as the dwelling ofa hermit could oner Pointing to one of the largest openings, as he ad¬ dressed me, — " Thou wilt find," he said, " in that grotto л bed of fresh douni leaves, and may the consciousness of having pro¬ tected the orphan sweeten thy sleep I" · I felt how dearlv thu praise had been earned, and already almost repented of having deserved it There was a sadness in the countenance of Alethe, as I took
lea« of her, to which the forebodings of my own heart but too faithfully responded; nor could I help fearing, as her hand parted Imgeringlv from mine, that I had, by this, sacrifice, placed her beyond my reach for ever. Having lighted ще a lamp, which, in theae recesses, even at noon, is necessary, the holy man led me to tbe entrance of the grotto ; —and here, I blush to say, my career of hypocrisy began. With the sole view of obtaining another glance at Alethe, I turned humbly to solicit the be¬ nediction of the Christian, and, having con¬ veyed to her, as X bent reverently down, a« much of the deep feeling of my soul as looks could express, with a desponding ipirit I hurried into the cavern. A short passage led me to the chamber withm,—the walls of which I found coverai, like thoae ofthe grottos of Lycopolis, with paintings, which, though executed long agaa ago, looked fresh as if their colours were but laid on yesterday. They were,
all of them, representations of rural and domestic scenes ; and, in the greater num¬ ber, the melancholy imagination of the artist had called Death in, aa usual, to throw his shadow over the pieture* MyattentiwwasDarticiilarlydrasmtoone series of subjects, throughout the whole of which the aouıe group—ayouth, a maiden, and two aged persons, who appeared to be the father and mother of the girl,—were represented in all the details of their daily life. The looks and attitudes of the young people denoted that they were lovers ¡and, sometimes, they were seen sitting under a canopy of flowers, with their eyes fixed on each other's Iacea, aa though they could never look away ; sometimes, they appeared walling along the beaks of the Nile, ----- оц one of thaw siret* piebt» Wnen lib, the pure star of lover·, llghti Her bridal сгекен o'er tbe hoi; stratus, — When Hindering ;«nht and matden watch bar And number o'er me ntght· »be batb to run.

Through ali these scenes of endear¬ ment the two elder persons stood by,— their calm countenances touched with a share of that bbss, m whose perfect light the young lovers were basking Thus far, alt was happmess,—but the sad lesson of mortality was to come In the last picture ofthe senes, one ofthe figures was missing It was that of the young maiden, who had disappeared from among them On the bnnk of a dark lake stood the three who remained, whde a boat, just departing for the City of the Dead, told too plainly the end of their dream of happmess This memorial of a sorrow o r other tunes — of a sorrow, ancient as death itself, — was not wanting to deepen the melancholy of my nund, or to add to the weight of Úw many bodings that pressed on it. After a mght, as it seemed, of anxious and unsleeping thought, I rose from im bed and returned to the garden I found the Christian alone, — seated, under the
shade of one of his trees, at a small table, with a volume unrolled before him, whde a beautiful antelope lay sleeping at his feet Struck forcibly by the contrast which he presented to those haughty priests, whom I had seen surrounded by the pomp and gorgeousness of temples, " Is this, then,' 1 thought I, "the faith, before which the world trembles — its temple the desert, its treasury a book, and its High Priest the solitary dweller of the rock ! " He had prepared for me a snnple, but hospitable, repast, of which fruits from his own garden, the white bread of Olyra, and the juice of the honey-cane were the most costly luxunes His manner to me was even more cordial than before, but the absence of Alethe, and, still more, the ominous reserve, with which he not only, himself, refrained from all mention of her name, but eluded the few inquiries, by which I sought to lead to it, seemed to confirm all the fears I had felt m parting from her m S
She had acquainted him, tt «as evident, with the whole history of onr flight. My reputation as a philosopher —my desire to beoome a Christian — all was already known to the zealous Anchoret, and the subject of my conversion was the тегу first on which he entered. О pride of philo¬ sophy, how wert thon then humbled, and with what shame did 1 stand, casting down my eyes, before that venerable man, as, with ingenuous trust m the sincerity of my attention, he Welcomed me to a partici pabon ofhis holy hope, and imprinted the Kiss of Charity on my model brow I Embarrassed aa I felt by the conscious nesa of hypocrisy, I was even still more perplexed by my total ignorance of the real teneta of the faith to which I pro¬ teased myself a convert. Abashed and contused, and with a heart sick at its own deceit, I heard the animated and eloquent gratulation, of the Christian, as though tbey were words in a dream, without link or meaning, nor could disgutse but by the
mockery of a reverential bow, at every pause, the entire want of self-possession, and even of speech, under which I la¬ boured. A few minutes more of such trial, and I must have avowed my impostiire. But the holy man saw my embarrassment; —and,, whether mUtaking it for awe, or knowing it to be ignorance, relieved me from my perplexity by, at once, changing the tlieme. Having gently awakened bis antelope Irom its sleep, " You have bearrV* be said, " I doubt not, of my brother- anchoret, Paul, who, «Tom his cave in the marble mountains, near the Red Sea, sends hourly ' the sacrifice of thanksgiving ' to heaven. Of his walks, they tell me, ■ lion is tbe companion; but, for me," he added, with a playful and significant amîItŞj " who try my powers of taming but on the gentler animal«, this feeble child of the desert is a far fitter play-mate." Jben, taking hia staff, and putting tbe time-worn ti t
volume which he had been reading into a large goat-skin pouch, that bung by his side, " I will now, ' said he, " lead thee over my rocky kingdom, — that thou mayst see in what drear and barren places, that ' fruit of the spirit,' Peace, may be gathered " To speak of peace to a heart bke mine, at that moment, was hke talking of some distant harbour to the manner sinking at sea. Üı vain did I look round for some sign of Alethe, — m väin make an effort even to utter her name Consciousness of my own deceit, as well as α fear of awakening m Melanius any suspicion that might frustrate my only hope, threw a fetter over my spmt and checked m\ tongue. In sdence, therefore, I followed, whde the cheerful old man, with slow, but firm, step, ascended the rock, by the same ladders which I had mounted on the preceding night Dunng the tune when the Decían Per- tecuùon was raging, many Christians of
this neighbourhood, he informed me, had taken refuge under his protection, m these grottos, and the chapel on the summit, where I had found them at prayer, was, m those times of danger, their place of re¬ treat, where, by drawing up these ladders, they were enabled to secure themselves from pursuit From the top of the rock, the view, on either side, embraced the two extremes of fertility and desolation, nor could the Epicurean and the Anchoret, who now gazed from that height, be at any loss to mdulge their respective tastes, between the living luxuriance of the world on one side, and the dead repose of the desert on the other When we turned to the nver, what a picture of animation presented itself! Near us, to the south, were the graceful colonnades of Antinoe, its proud, populous streets, and triumphal monuments On tbe opposite shore, neh plains, teeming with cultivation to the water's edge, offered up, m $
as from verdant altars, their fruits to the mn ; while, beneath us, the Nile, —— the glonoui itretUD, Taat Ute between iu bankt wu teen to glide, — Witb ihrinet snd marble ciues, on each nde, GlUtermg, like jeweb strung along a chain, — Hatt now tent forth in wsten, snd o'er plain And valley, like a giant from hu bed lujbigwisll outvtretch'd lunbt, superbly spread From thu scene, on one side of the moun¬ tam, we had but to turn round our eyes, audit was as ď nature herself had become suddenly extinct ; — a wide waste of sands, bleak and mtermmable, wearying out the sun with Ha sameness of desolation,— Ыаск, bumt-op rocks, that stood as bar¬ riers, at which life stopped, — while the only signs of animation, past or present, ware the foot-prints, here and there, of an antekxx or ostrich, or the bones of dead camels, u they by whitening at a distance, marking wt the track of the caravans over the «raate.
After listening, whde he contrasted, m a few eloquent words, the two rèjgiotís of life and death on whose confines wé stood, I «gam descended with my guide to the garden we had left. From thence, turn¬ ing mto a path along tbe mountain-side, he conducted me to another row of grottos, facing the desert, which had once, he satd, been the abode of those brethren m Christ, who had fled with him to this solitude trom the crowded world, — but which death had, within a few months, rendered tenantless A cross of red stone, and a few faded trees, were the only traces these soutanes had left behmd A sdence of some minutei succeeded, whde we descended to thè edge of the canal, and I saw opposite, among the rocks, that sohtary cave, which had so chilled me with its aspect on the pre¬ ceding night By the bank we found one of those rustic boats, which the Egyp¬ tians construct of planks of wdd thorn, bound rudely together with bands of papy- M β
rus Placing ourselves m this boat, and rather impelling than rowing it across, we made our way through the foul «and shallow flood, and landed directly under the site of the cave. Ibis dwelling, as I have already men¬ tioned, was situated upon a ledge of the rock, and, bemg provided with a son of window or aperture to admit the light of heaten, was accounted, I found, more cheerful than the grottos on the other side of the ravine But there wab a dreariness in the whole region around, to which light only lent inore horror Tlie dead whiteness of tlie rocks, as they stood, hke ghosts, ш the sunshine,—that melan choly pool, half lost m the sands,—all gave me the idea of a wasting world To dwell m such a place seemed to me Uke a lmng death, and when the Chns¬ tian, as we entered the cave, said, " Here is to be thy home," prepared as I was fbr the worst, my resolution gave way, — every feeling of disappomted passion
and humbled pride, which had been ga¬ thering round my heart fbr the last few hours, found a vent at once, and I burst into tears Ì Well accustomed to human weakness, and perhaps guesbing at some of the sources of mine, the good Hermit, with¬ out appearing to notice this emotion, ex¬ patiated, with a cheerful air, on, what he called, the many comforts of my dwellmg. Sheltered, he satd, from the dry, burning wind of the south, my porch would inhale the fresh breeze of the Dog-star. Fruits from his own mountain-garden should furnish my rtpast Tlie well of the neigh¬ bouring rock would supply my beverage, and, " htre," ht continued,—lowering his voice mto u more solemn tone, as he placed upon the tul \ the volume which he had brought, — " here, my son, is that 'well of living naters,' in which alone thou wdt find lasting refreshment or peace ! " Thus saymg, he descended
the rock to his boat, and after a few plashes of his oar had died npon my ear, the solitude and silence around me was complete.
CHAP. XVII. What a fate was nune' — but a few weeks smce, presiding over that splendid Festival of the Garden, with all the luxu¬ ries of existence tributary m my tram, and now, — self humbled mto a sohtary outcast, — the hypocritical pupd of a Christian anchoret,—without even the ex¬ cuse of fanaticism, or of any other mad¬ ness, but that of love, wdd love, to extenuate my fall I Were there a hope that, by this humiliating waste of existence, I might purchase but a glimpse, now and then, of .Alethe, even the depths of the desert, with such a chance, would be welcome. But to Uve — and bve thus — vntkcHä her, was a misery which 1 neither foresaw nor could endure. Hating even to look upon the den to which i was doomed, I hurried out mto
the air, and found my way, along the rocka, to the desert. The sun was gonig down, with that blood-red hue, which he so frequently wears, m this clime, at his setting I saw the sands, stretching out, bke a sea, to the horizon, as if their waste extended to the very verge of the world, — and.in the bitterness of my feelmgs, rejoiced to see so much of creation rescued, even by this barren liberty, from the grasp of man The thought seemed to relieve my wound¬ ed pride, and, as I wandered over the dim and boundless solitude, to be thus free, even amid blight and desolation, appeared a blessing The only living thing I saw was a rest- leas swallow, whose wings were of tbe hue of the grey sands over which he fluttered " Why may not the mmd, hke this bird, take the colour of the desert, and sym¬ pathise m its austenty, its freedom, and its calm 7 " — thus, between despondence and defiance, did I ask myself, endeavourmg to face with fortitude what yet my heart
sickened to contemplate But the effort was unavadmg Overcome by that vast solitude, whose repose was not the slum¬ ber of peace, but the sullen and burning sdence of hate, I felt my spirit give way, and even love itself yield to despair Seating myself on a fragment of a rock* and covenng my eyes with my hands, I made an effort to shut out the overwhelm¬ ing prospect But m vam — it was still before me, deepened by all that fancy could add, and when, agam looking up, I saw the last red ray of the sun» shooting across that melancholy and life¬ less waste, it seemed to me hke the light of the comet that once desolated this world, shining out luridly олег the ruin that it had made ! Appalled by my own gloomy ima¬ ginations, I turned towards the ravme, and, notwithstanding the disgust with which I had left my dwelling, was not ill pleased to find my way, over the rocks, to it agam On approaching the cave, to my astonish-
ment, I saw a light within. At such a moment, any vestige of life was welcome, and I hailed the unexpected appearance with pleasure. On entering, however, I found the chamber as lonely as I had left it The light came from a lamp that burned bnghtly on the table; beside it was unfolded the volume which Melanius had brought, and upon me leaves — oh, joy and surprise—lay the well-known cross of Alethe ! What hand, but her own, could have prepared this reception for me?—The very thought sent a hope ¡nto my heart, before which all despondency fled. Even the gloom of the desert was forgotten, and my cave at once brightened into a bower. She had here reminded me, her¬ self, by this sacred memorial, of the vow which I had pledged to her under the Hermit's rock; and I now scrupled not to reiterate the tame daring promise, though conscious that through hypocrisy alone I could fulfil it
Eager to prepare myself for my task of imposture, I sat down to ťhe volume, which I now found to be the Hebrew Scriptures, and the first sentence, on which my eyes fell, was — и The Lord hath commanded the blessing, even life for evermore !" Startled by these words, m which the Spint of my dream seemed agam topronounce his assuring prediction, I raised my eyes from the page, and repeated the sentence over and over, as if to try whether the sounds had any charm or spell, to reawaken that faded illusion in my soul But, no—the rank frauds ofthe Memphian pnesthood had dispelled all my trust m the promises of religion My heart had agam relapsed mto its gloom of scepticism, and, to the word of " Life," the only an¬ swer it sent back was, " Death * " Impatient, however, to possess myself of the elements ofa Uith, on which,—whatever it might promise for hereafter,—I folt that my happiness here depended, I turned over the pages with an earnestness and
avidity, such as never even the most fa¬ vourite of my studies had awakened ш me Though, like all who seek but the surface of learning, I flew desultorily over the leaves, lighting only on the more promi¬ nent and shining points, I yet found myself even m this undisciplined career, arrested, at every page, by the awful, the supernatural sublimity, the alternate me¬ lancholy and grandeur of the images that crowded upon me I had, till now, known the Hebrew theology but through the platomsing re¬ finements of Philo , — as, in like manner, for my knowledge of the Chrirtion doc¬ trine I was indebted to my brother Epi¬ cureans, Lucian and Celsus. Little, therefore, was I prepared for the simple majesty, the high tone of inspiration, — the poetry, m short, of heaven that breathed throughout these oracles. Could admiration have kindled faith, I should, that night, have been a believer, so ele¬ vated, so awed was my imagination by
tnat wonderful book, — its warmngs of wo, its announcements of glory, and its unrivalled strams of adorati jn and sorrow Hour after hour, with the same eager aid d^ultory cunosity, did I turn over the leaves, — and when, at length, I lay down to rest, my fancy was stdl haunted by the impressions it had received I went agam through the various scenes of which I had read, again called up, m sleep, the bright images tliat had charmed me, and, when wakened at day break by the Hymn from the chapel, fancied myself still listen¬ ing to the sound of the wmds, 'Sighing mournfully through the harps of Israel on the willows htartmg from my bed, I hurried out upon the rock, with a hope that, among the tones of that morning choir, I might be able to distinguish the sweet voice of Alethe. But the stram had ceased —1 caught only the last notes of the Hymn, as, echoing up that lonely valley, they died away mto the sdence of the desert.
With the first glimpse of light I was agam at my study, and, notwithstanding the distraction both of my thoughts and looks towards the half-seen grottos of the Anchoret, pursued it persevenngly through tfae day. Stdl alive, however, but to the eloquence, the poetry of what I read, of its connection or authenticity, as a history, I never paused to consider My fancy being alone interested by it, to &ncy I re¬ ferred all it contamed, and, passing rapidly from annals to prophecy, from narration to song, regarded the whole but as a tissue of splendid allegories, in which the melan¬ choly of Egyptian associations was m terwoven with the rich imagery of the East Towards sunset I saw the boat of Me¬ lanias on its way, across the canal, to my cave. Tnough he had no other companion than hia graceful antelope, that stood snuf¬ fing the wild air of the desert, aa if scent¬ ing its home, I felt his visit, even thus, to be · most welcome rehef. It was the
hour, he said, of bis evening ramble up tbe mountam,—of his accustomed visit to those cisterns of the rock, from which he nightly drew his most precious beverage Whde he spoke, I observed in his band one of those eartben cups, m which the inhabitants of the wilderness are accus¬ tomed to collect the fresh dew among the rocks Havmg proposed that I should ac company him m his walk, he led me, m the direction of the desert, up the side of the mountam that rose above my dwellmg, and which formed the southern wall or screen of the defile Near the summit we found a seat, where the old man paused to rest It commanded afilli view over the desert, and was by the side of one of those hollows m the rock, those natural reservoirs, m which the dews of night are treasured up for the refresh¬ ment of the dwellers m the wilderness Havmg learned from me how far I had pro¬ ceeded m my study, " In that light," said he, pointing to a small cloud m the east,
which had been formed on the horizon by the haze of the desert, and was now faintly reflecting the splendours of sunset, — "in that hght stands Mount Sinai, of whose glory thou hast read, on whose summit was the scene of one of those awful revel¬ ations, m which the Almighty has, from tune to time, renewed his communication with Man, and kept alive the remem¬ brance of his own Providence m this world " After a pause, as ď absorbed in the immensity of the subject, the holy man contmued his sublime theme Lookmg back to the earliest annals of tune, he showed how constantly every relapse of the human race mto idolatry has been followed by some manifestation of divme power, chastening the proud by punish nient, and winning back the humble bj^ Wove. It was to preserve, he said, unex¬ tinguished upon earth, that vital truth, — the Creation of theworid by one Supreme Being, — that Ood chose, from among the
nations, an humble and enslaved race,—-that he brought them out of their captivity " on eagles' wings," and, surrounding every step of their course with miracles, placed them before the eyes of all succeeding gener¬ ations, as the depositaries of his will, and the ever-durmg memorials ofhis power Passing, then, m review the long tram of inspired interpreters, whose pens and whose tongues were made the echoe« of the Divine voice, he traced *, through the events of successive ages, the gradual un¬ folding ofthe dark scheme of Providence — darkness without, but all light and glory withm The glunpses of a coming redemp¬ tion, visible even through the wrath of heaven,—the long senes of prophecy, through which this hope runs, burning and alive, bke a spark through a cham, — the merciful preparation of the hearts of mankind for the great tnal of their * In the original the diacounet of tbe Hermit en fìven much more it length. N
fiüth and obedience «hat waa at hand, oat only by miracles that appealed to the Irring, but by predictions launched into futurity to cany connction to the yet unborn;—"through all these glo¬ rious and beneficent gradations we may track," said he, " the manifest footsteps of a Creator, achancmg to nia grand, ultimate end, the salvation of his creatures." «after some hours devoted to these holy instructions, we returned to the ravine, and Melanins left me at my cave; praying, us he parted from roe, — with a benevolence I but 111, alaa ! deserved, —that my soul, miliar these lessons, might be "as a wa¬ tered garden," and, ere long, bear '< fruit imt» lift eteinal.'' Maat morning, I was again at my study, and even more eager in the task* than be¬ fore. With, the commentary of the Hermit treshlym my memory, lagain read through, wrm'atteiitiorj,theBookofmeLaw. But as vain did I seek the promise of im- mort'lily In ila page·. " It tells me," aaid

Where, then, is the salvation of which the Christian spoke? or, if Death be at tbe oot of the faith, can Life spring out of tl" Again, ш the bitterness of disappomt¬ ment, did I mock at my own willing self- delusion,— agam rad at the arta of that traitress, Fancy, ever ready, hke the De¬ lilah of this book, to steal upon the slum¬ bers of Reason, and deliver hnn up, shorn and powerless, to his foes. If déception —thought I, with a sigh—be neces¬ sary, at least let me not practise it on myself, — m the desperate alternative before me, let me rather be even hypo¬ cnte than dupe These self-accusing renecUons, cheer-
less as they rendered my task, did not abate, for a single moment, my industry m pursuing it I read on and on, with a son of sullen apathy, neither charmed by style, nor transported by imagery, — that fatal blight in my heart having commumcated itself to my fancy and taste The curses and tht blessings, the glory and tbe nun, which tue histonan recorded and the pro¬ phet predicted, seemed all of this world, — all, temporal and earthly That mor tauty, of which the* fountain-head had tasted, tinged the whole stream, and when I read the words, " all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again," a feebng, like the wind of the desert, came withenngly over me Lore, Beauty, Glory, everj thing most bnght upon earth, appeared sinking before my eyes, under this dread nil doom, mto one general mass of cor¬ ruption and silence. Possessed by tbe image of desolation I had called up, I laid my head on the book, m a paroxysm of despair Death, in all
his most ghastly varieties, passed before me, and 1 bad continued thus tor some time, as under the influence of a fearful vision, when the touch ofa hand upon my shoulder roused me Looking up, I ьа«« the Anchoret standing by my side,— his countenance beaming mth that mb* hme tranquilbty, which a hope, beyond this earth, alone can bestow How I envied hnn I We agam took our way to the seat upon the mountam, — the gloom in my own nund making everv thing around me more gloomy Forgetting my hypocrisy in my feelings, I, at once, avowed to mm aU the do· bts and fears which my study of the morning had awakened. " Thou art yet, my son," he answered, " but on the threshold of our fiuth Thou hast seen but the first rudiments of the Divme plan, — its full and mnsnmmat» perfection hath not yet opened upon thee. However glorious that manifestation of Divinity on Mount Sinai, it was but tha s S
forerunner of another, still more glorious, dust, m the fulness of tune, was to burst upon the world, when all, that had seemed dim and incomplete, was to be perfected, and the promises, shadowed ont by the ' spmt of prophecy,' realized, — Vhen the sdence, that lay, as a seal, on kW friture, was to be broken, and the glad tidings of hfe and immortality pro¬ claimed to the world I " Observing my features brighten at these words, the рюш man continued Anticipat¬ ing some of the holy knowledge that was in store for aae, be traced, through all its wonders and mercies, the great work of «nVidemptioa, dwelling on every r raculous circumstance connected with it, — the exalted nature of the Bemg, by whose manstry it waa accomplished, the noblest and fint created of the Sons of Ood, inferior only to the one, se№existent Father, —the mysterious incarnation of this heavenly messenger;—the miracles tlait authenucated his divine mission,—
the example of obedience to God and love to man, which he set, as a ahintng hght, before the world for ever, — and, lastly and chiefly, his death and resur¬ rection, by which the covenant of mercy was sealed, and " life and immortality brought to light" "Such," continued the Hermit, "was the Mediator, promised through all time, to*make reconciliation for iniquity,' to change death mto life, and bring 'heal¬ ing on his wings ' to a darkened world. Such was the last crowning dispensation of that God of benevolence, in whose hands sm and death are but instrumenta of everlasting good, and who, through ap¬ parent evil and temporary rétribution, bringing all things ' out of darkness mto his marvellous light,' proceeds watchfiilly and unchangingly to the great, final object of his providence, — the restoration of the whole human race to punty and happi* nessi" With a nund astonished, if not touched, h *
by these discourses,! returned to my cave, and found the lamp, as before, ready lighted to receive me. The volumo which I had been reading was replaced by another, whkh Uy open upon the table, with a branch of fresh palm between its leaves Though I could not have a doubt to whose gentle hand I was indebted for this m visible superintendence over my studies, there was yet a something in it, so hke spi¬ ritual interposition, that it awed me, — and never more than at this moment, when, on approaching the volume, I saw, as the light glistened over its sdver letters, that it was the very Book of Life of which the Hermit had spoken I The orison of the Christians had sounded through the valley, before I raised my eyes from that sacred volume, and the second hour of the sun found me again over its pages.
CHAP XVIII In this mode of existence did I pass some days ; — my mornings devoted to reading, my nights to listening, under the canopy of heaven, to the holy eloquence of Melanius The perseverance with which I enquired, and the quickness with which I learned, soon succeeded m de¬ ceiving my benevolent instructor, who mistook cunosity for zeal and knowledge for behef Alas' cold, and barren, and •earthly was that knowledge, — the word, without the spint, the shape, without the life Even when, as a rehef from hy¬ pocrisy, I persuaded myself that I be lieved, it was but a brief delusion, a faith, whose hope crumbled at the touch,— like the fruit of the desert-shrub, shining and empty t But, though my soul was stdl dark, the N í
good Hermit saw not mto its depths The very fatality of my belief, which might have suggested some doubt of its sincenty, was but regarded by his innocent zeal, аь a more signal triumph of the truth Нь own ingenuousness led bun to a ready trust ш others, and the examples of such conversion aa that of the philosopher, Justan, who received the light mto his soul dunng a walk by the sea shore, bad pre pared him for illuminations of the spirit even more rapid than mine,, Durmg this tune, I neither saw nor heard of Alethe. — nor could my patience have endured so long a privation, had not those mute vestiges of her presence, that welcomed me every night on my return, made me feel that I was stdl living under her gentle influence, and that her sympadiy hung round every step of my progress One«, too, when I ventured to speak her name to Melanius, though he anewered not my enquiry, there was a smde, 1 thought of promise upon his countenance,
which love, more alive than faith, inter¬ preted as it wished. At length,—it was on the sixth or seventh evening of my solitude, when I lay resting at the door of my cave, after the study of the day, —-1 was startled by hearing my name called loudly from the opposite rocks, and looking up, saw, on the cliff near the deserted grottos, Me¬ lanius and — oh, I could not doubt — my Alethe by his side ' Though I had never ceased, smce the first night of my return fiOm the desert, to flatter myself with the fancy that I was still bvmg m her presence, the actual sight of her agam maile me feel what an age we had been separated. She was clothed all m white, and, as she stood in the last remain» of the sunshine, appeared to my too prophetic fancy like a parting spint, whose last footsteps on earth that glory encircled. With a dehght only to be imagined, I saw them descend the rocks, and placing n 6
thenuelves ш the boat, proceed towards щу cave. To disguise from Melanius the feelings with which we met was im¬ possible,— nor did Alethe even attempt to mak« a secret of her innocent joy Though blushing at her own happmess, she could as httle conceal it, as the clear waters of Ethiopia can hide their gold Every look, too, every word, spoke a ful ness of affection, to which, doubtful as I was of our tenure of happmess, I knew not how to answer I was not long, however, left ignorant of the bnght rate that awaited me, but, as we wandered or rested among the rocka, learned every tlung that hod been arranged smce our parting She had made the Hermit, I found, acquainted with all that had passed between us, had told him, without reserve, every mcident of our voyage, — the avowals, the demon straUons of affection on one side, and the deep sentiment that gratitude hod awakened on the other Too wise to re-
gard feelings, so natural, with severity, -— knowing that they were of heaven, and but made evd by man, — the good Hermit had heard of our attachment with plea¬ sure , and, proved as he thought the punty of my views had been, by the fidelity with which I had dehvered up my trust mto his hands, saw, m nry affection for the young orphan, but a providential resource agamst that friendless solitude m which his death must soon leave her As I collected these particulars from theu* discourse, I could hardly trust my ears It seemed too much happiness to be real, nor can words give an idea of the joy — the shame — the wonder with which I listened, whde the holy man him¬ self declared, that he awaited but the mo¬ ment, when he should find me worthy of becoming a member of the Chnstian Church, to give me also the hand c f Alethe m that sacred union, which alone sanctifies love, and makes the faith, which it pledges, heavenly It was but yesterday, he added,
that hls young charge, herself, alter a pre¬ paration of prayer and repentance, such as even her pure spmt required, had been admitted, by the sacred ordinance of bap¬ tism, mto the bosom of the faith, — and the white garment she wore, and the nng of gold on her finger, " were symbols, he said, " of thnt New Life into which she had been initiated." I raued my eyes to her as he spoke, but withdrew them again, dazzled and confused Even her beauty, to my una gmation, seemed to have undergone some brightening change, and the contrast be¬ tween that open and happy countenance, and the unblest brow of the infidel that stood before her, abashed me mto a sense of unworthiness, and almost checked my rapture. To that night, however, I look back, as an epoch m my existence. It proved that sorrow ts not the only awakener of devonon, but that joy may sometimes call the holy spark mto life. Returmng to
my cave, with a heart full, even to op¬ pression, of its happmess, I knew no other relief to my overcharged feelmgs than that of throwing myself on my knees, and, for the first tune m my bfe, uttering a prayer, that ι£ mdeed, there were a Being who watched over mankind, he wonld send down one ray of his truth into my soul, and make it worthy of the bless¬ ings, both here and hereafter, proffered to me! My days now rolled on m a perfect dream of happiness Every hour of the morning was welcomed as bringing nearer and nearer the blest tune of sunset, when die Hermit and Alethe never faded to pay their visit to my now charmed cave, where her smde left a light, at each partmg, that lasted till her return Then, our rambles, by star-light, over the mountam, — our pauses, on the way, to contemplate the bright wonders of that heaven above us, — our repose by the astern of the rock, and our sdent listening, through hours
that seemed minutes, to the holy eloquence of our teacher, — all, all was happmess of the most heartfelt kmd, and such as even the doubts, die cold, lingermg doubts, that still hung, bke a mist, around my heart, could neither cloud nor chill When the moonlight nights returned, we used to venture mto the desert, and those sands, which but lately had ap¬ peared to me so desolate, now wore even a cheerful and smiling aspect To the light, mnocent heart of Alethe every thing was a source of enjoyment For her, even the desert had its jewels and flowers, and, sometimes, her delight was to search among the sands for those beautiful pebbles of jasper that abound ш them, — some times, her eyes sparkled on finding, per¬ haps, a stunted mangold, or one of those bitter, scarlet flowers, that lend their mock ery of ornament to the desert In all these pursuits and pleasures the good Hermit took a share, — mingling with them occa¬ sionally the reflections of a benevolent
piety, that lent its own cheerful hue to all the works of creation, and saw the con¬ soling truth " God is Love," wntten legibly every where Such was, for а few weeks, my blissful life Oh mornings of hope, oh mghts of happmess, with what mournful pleasure do I retrace your flight, and how reluctantly pass to the sad events tliat followed 1 Durmg this time, m compliance with the wishes of Melanius, who seemed unwilling that I should become wholly estranged from the world, I occasionally paid a visit to the neighbouring city, Antinoe, which, as the capital of the Thebaid, is the centre of all the luxury of Upper Egypt. Here, — so changed was my every feebng by the all- transformuig passion that possessed me, — I wandered, unamused and uninterested by either the scenes or the people that sur¬ rounded me, and, sighing for that rocky so¬ htude where Alethe breathed, felt thu to be the wdderness, and that, the world Even the thoughts of my own native
Athens, that were called up, at every step, by the hght Grecian architecture of tbis imperial city, did not awaken one single regret m my heart — one wish to ex¬ change even an hour of my desert for the best luxuries and honours tbat awaited me in the Garden. I saw the arches of tnumph, —I walked under the superb portico, which encircles the whole aty with its marble shade, — I stood in the Circus of the Sun, by whose rose-coloured pillars the myste¬ nous movements of the Ше are measured, — all these bright ornaments of glory and art, as well as the gay multitude that en¬ livened them, I saw with an unheeding eye If they awakened m me any thought Jt was the moiirnful idea, that one day, like Thebes and Hebopolis, this pageant would pais away, leaving nothing behmd but a few mouldering rums, —bke the sea shells found where the ocean has been, — to tell that the great tide of Life was once there 1 But though indifferent thus to all tbat had formerly attracted me, there were
subjects, once alien to my heart, on which it was now most tremblingly alive, and some rumours which had reached me, m one of my visits to the city, of an expected change m the policy of the Emperor to¬ wards the Christians filled me with ap prehensions as new as they were dreadful to me The peace and even favour which the Christians enjoyed, during the first four years of the reign of Valerian, hod removed from them all lear of a renewal of those horrors, which they had expcnenced under the rule of his predecessor, Deems Of late, however, some less friendly disposi¬ tions had manifested themselves. Hie bigots of the court, takmg alarm at the spread of the new faith, had succeeded m filling the mmd of the monarch with that religious jealousy, which is the ever-ready parent of cruelty and mjustice. Among these counsellors of evil was Macnanus, the Praetorian Prefect, who was, by birth, an Egyptian, and—so alun ıs superstition to
mtolerance —had long made himself no¬ torious by hts addiction to the dark prac¬ tices of demon-worship and magic From this minister, who was now high m lhe ravour of Valenon, the expected measures of severity agamst the Christians, it was supposed, would emanate All tongues, m all quarters, were busy with the news. In the streets, m the public gardens, on the steps ofthe temples, I saw, eveiy where, groups of enquirers collected, «and heard the name of Macnanus upon every tongue. It was dreadnd, too, to observe, m the countenances of those who spoke, the vanety of feebng with which the rumour was discussed, according as they desired or dreaded its truth, — ac cording as they were likely to be among the torturers or the victims Alarmed« though stall ignorant of the whole extent of the danger, I hurned back to the ravme, and, going at once to the grotto of Melanius, detaded to him every particular of the intelligence I had col-
lected He heard me with a composure, which I mistook, alas, for confidence m his security, and, naming the hour for our evening walk, retired mto his grotto At the accustomed time Alethe and he were at my cave It was evident that he had not commumcated to her the intelli¬ gence which I had brought, for never did brow wear such a happmess as that which now played round hers,—it was, alas, not of this earth 1 Melanius, himself, though composed, was thoughtful, and the solem¬ nity, almost approaching to melancholy, with which he placed the hand of Alethe m mme —in the performance, too, ofa cere¬ mony that ought to have filled my heart with joy—saddened and alarmed me. Tins ceremony was our betrotbment,—the plight¬ ing of our faith to each other, — which we now solemnized on the rock before the door of my cave, m the face of that sun¬ set heaven, with its one star standing as witness. After a blessing from the Her¬ mit on our spousal pledge, I placed the
ringi— the earnest of our future union— on her finger, and, m the blush, with which she surrendered her whole heart to me at that mstant, forgot every thing but my happmess, and felt secure, even agamst fete! We took our accustomed walk over the rocks and on the desert The moon was so bnght,—like the daylight, indeed, of other climes—that we could see plainly the tracks of the wdd antelopes m the sand, and it was not without a slight tremble of feebng m his voice, as if some melancholy analogy occurred to him as he »poke, that the good Hermit said, " I have observed m my walks, that where- ever the track of that gende animal is seen, there is, almost always, the foot¬ print of a beast of prey near it. He regained, however, his usual cheerfulness before we parted, and fixed the following evenmg for an excursion, on the other side of the ravine, to a point, looking, he said, "towards that northern region ofthe desert,
where the hosts of the Lord encamped m their departure out of bondage " Though, m the presence of Alethe, my fears, even for herselt were forgotten in that perpetual element of happmess, which encircled her bke the air that she breathed, no sooner was I alone than vague terror»· and bodings crowded upon me In vam did I try to reason myself out of my fears by dwellmg on the most cheering circum¬ stances,—the reverence with which Mela- nius was regarded, even by the Pagans, and the mviolate security with which he had hved through the most penl- ous periods, not only safe Inmself, but af¬ fording sanctuary m his grottos to others. "When, somewhat calmed by these con¬ siderations, I sunk off to sleep, dark, hor¬ rible dreams took possession of my mind Scenes of death and of torment paased confusedlj before me, and, when I awoke, it was with the fearful impression that all these horrors were real
CHAP XIX Ат length, the day dawned, — that dread fui day Impatient to be relieved from ray suspense, I threw myself into my boat, — the same m which we had performed our happy voyage,*-and, as fast as oars could speed me, hurried away to the city I found the suburbs sdent and sohtary, but, as I approached the Forum, loud yells, like those of barbarians in combat, struck on my ear, and, when I entered it,—great God, what a spectacle presented itself' The imperial edict agamst the Christian!« had arrived during the night, and airead) the wdd fury of bigotry was let loose Under a canopy, in the middle of tht Forum, was the tribunal jf Uie Governor Two statues, one of Apollo, the other of Our», «stood at tbe bottom of the steps that led up to his judgment-seat. Before
these idola were shrines, to which the de¬ voted Christians were dragged from all Quarters by the soldiers and mob, and there compelled to recant, by throwing incense mto the flame, or, on their refusal, hurned away to torture and death It was as appalling scene, — the consternation, the enes of some of the victims, — the pale, silent resolution of others, — the fierce shouts of laughter that broke from the multitude, when tbe frankincense, drop¬ ped on the altar, proclaimed some denier of Christ, and the fiend-like triumph with which the courageous Confessors, who avowed their faith, were led away to the flames, — never could I have conceived such an assemblage of horrora I Though I gazed but fbr a few minutes, m those minutes I felt enough Ibr years. Already did the form of Alethe (ht before me through that tumulti, — I heard them shout her name t —he» ilinek fell on my ear, and the very thought so о
palsied me with terror, that I stood fixed and statue-like on the spot Recollecting, however, the feariul pre¬ ciousness of every moment, and that—per haps, at this very mstant—some emissaries of blood might be on their way to the grottos, I rushed wildly out ofthe Forum and made my way to the quay lbe streets were now crowded, but 1 ran headlong through the multitude, and waa already under the portico leadmg down to the nver,—already saw the boat that was to bear me to Alethe,—when о Cei' turum stood sternly m my path, and I was surrounded and arrested by soldiers ! It was m vam that I implored, that I strug gled with them as for life, assuring them that I was a stranger, — that I was an Athenian,-—that I was — noi a Christum The precipitation of my flight was suffi cient evidence against me, and unrelent ingly, and by force, they bore me away to the quarters of their Chief
It was enough to dnve me to madness ţ Two hours, two frightful hours, was I kept waiting the arnval of the Tnbune of then Legion *, — my bram burning with a thousand fears and imaginations, which every passing mmute made more likely to be realised Every thing, too, that I could collect from the con¬ versations around me but added to the agonising apprehensions with which I was racked. Troops, it was said, had been sent m all directions through the neigh¬ bourhood, to brmg ш the rebellious Chris¬ tiana, and make them bow before the Gods of the Empire With horror, too, I heard of Orcus, — Orcus, the High Priest of Memphis, — as one of the principal instigators of this sanguinary edict, and as here present m Antinoe, animating and directing its execution In this state of torture I remained tdl * Ага^гешпЫЬ1в1^ЫоГ Союве! о a
the arriral of the Tribune. Absorbed in my own thoughts, I had not perceived his entrance ;—till, hearing a voice, in a tone of friendly surprise, exclaim, "Alciphron Г I looked up, and in this legionary Chief recognised a young Roman of rank, who had held a military command, the year befbre, stt Adieos, and was one of the most distmgiiished rùdtora ofthe Garden. It was no tune, however, for courte¬ sies;.—he was proceeding with cordiality to great me, but, having heard him order my instant release, I could wait for no more. Acknowledging his kindness but by a grasp ofthe hand, I flew oţ like one frantic, through the streets, and, ¡n a lew minutes, waa on the river. My sole hope had been to reach the grottos before any of the detached parties should arrive, and, by a timely flight across the desert, rescue, at least, Alethe from tbeir iiiry. The ill-Sued delay that had occurred rendered this hope almost de-
sperate ; but the tranquillity I found every where as I proceeded down the river, and the fond confidence 1 still cherished in the sacredness of the Hermit's retreat, kept my heart from giving way altogether under its terrors. Between the current and my oars, the boat flew, like wind, along the waters ; and I was already near the rocks of the ravine, when I saw, turning out ofthe canal into the river, a barge crowded with people, and glittering with arms I How did I ever survive the shock of that sight ? The oars dropped, as if struck out of my hands, mto the water, and I sat, helplessly gazing, as that terrific vision approached. In a few minutes, the current brought us together; — and I saw, on the deck of the barge, Alethe and the Hermit surrounded by soldiers! We were already passing each other when, with a desperate effort, I sprang ¡irom my boat and lighted upon the edge of their vessel. I knew not what I did, for о S
despair waa my on'y prompter. Snatch¬ ing at die sword of one ofthe soldiers, as I stood tottering on the edge, I had luo ceeded Ja wresting it out of his hands, when, at the tame moment, I received a thrust of a lance from one of his com¬ rades, and fell backward mto tbe river. I oan just «member "rising again and mekmg a grasp at the tide of the ves- ael,—but tbs shock, the faintness from my wound, deprived me of all oonscious- nett, tad a shriek from Alethe, as I sunk, it all I can recollect of what followed. Would I bad then died I — Yet, no, Almighty Being, — I should have died in darkness, and I have lived to know Thee ' On returning to my senses, I found myself reclined on · couch, h a splendid stwtmesit, the whole appearance of which being Grecian, I, for a moment, forgot all thtt had pistad, and imagined myself ia my dwn home at Athens. But too toon tha whole «freadnd certainty flashed пров a»! and, starting wildly—ilis*·
bled aa I was —from my couch, I called fondly, and with the shnek of a maniac, on Alethe. 1 was m the house, I found, of my friend and disciple, the young Tnbune, who had made the Governor acquamted with my name and condition, and had re¬ ceived me under hu roof, when brought, bleeding and insensible, to AntiDoe From hun I now learned at once,—fbr I could not wait for details, — the sum of all that had happened m that dreadful interval. Melanius was no more,—Alethe, soil alive, but m pnson ! " Take me to her"—I had but tune to say — "take me to her mstantly, and let medie by her side," — when, nature agam failing under such shocks, I relapsed mto insensibility In this state I contmued for near an hour, and, on recovering, lound the Tribune by my side. The horrors, he said, ofthe Forum were, for duw day, over,— but what the morrow might brmg, he shud¬ dered to contemplate. His nature, it was
plain, revolted from the inhuman duties in which he waa engaged. Touched by the agonies he saw me sufier, he, ÚT eome degree, relieved them, by pro- mismg that I should, at night-fidl, be con¬ veyed to-ttie prison, and, if possible, through his influence, gain access «o Alethe. She might yet, he added, be saved, could I succeed in persuading her to comply with the terms of the edict, and make •wcrmce to the Gods. — " Otherwise," said be, " there is no hope ; — the vindic¬ tive Orens, who has resisted even this abort fetpite of mercy, will, to-morrow, in¬ exorably demand his prey." He then related to me, at my own re¬ quest,— though every word was torture, —all the harrowing details of the pro¬ ceeding beiore the Tribunal. " I have seen courage," said he, " in its noblest forms, in the Seld; but the calm intre¬ pidity witb whicb that aged Hermit en¬ dured tonnenta— which it was hardly less torment to witness—surpassed all
that I could have conceived of human fortitude !" My poor Alethe, too,—in describing to me her conduct, the brave man w-pc like a child. Overwhelmed, he said, at nrst by her apprehensions for my safety, she had given way to a fidi burst of wo¬ manly weakness. But no sooner waa she brought before the Tribunal, and the de¬ claration of her faith was demanded of Ыт, than a spirit almost supernatural seem« 1 to animate her whole form. " She raised hei eyes," said he, " calmly, but with fer¬ vour, to heaven, while a blush was the only sign of mortal feelmg on her features; — and tho clear, sweet, and untrembling voice, with which she pronoui.ced her dooming words, ' t anı a Christian !'sent a thrill of admiration and pity throughout the multi¬ tude. Her youth, her loveliness, affected all hearts, and a cry of ' Save the young maiden I' was heard in all directions." The implacable Orcus, however, would о 5
not hear of mercy Resenting, as it appeared, witb all his deadliest rancour, not only her own escape from hu tods, but the aid with which, so fatally to his views, she had assisted mme, he de¬ manded loudly, and m the name of the insulted sanctuary of Isis, her instant death. It was but by the firm interventen of the Governor, who shared the general sympathy ш her fate, that the delay ol another day was accorded, to give a chance to the young maiden of yet recalling her confession, and thus affording some pretext Ibr saving her Even m yielding reluctantly to thu brief respite, the inhuman Priest would accomţtany it wuh some mark of hb vengeance. Whether for the pleasure lobserved the Tribune) of mingling mock¬ ery with his cruelty, or as a warning to her of the doom she must ultimately expect, he gave orders that there should be tied round her brow one of those duplets of
coral*, with which it is the custom of young Christian maidens to array them*' selves on the day of their martyrdom, — " and, thus fearfully adorned, ' said he, " she was led away, amid the gaze of the pitying multitude, to prison " With these details the short interval till night-fall, — every mmute of which seemed an age, — was occupied As soon as it grew dark, I was placed upon ¿ litter, — my wound, though not dangerous requiring such a conveyance, — and con ducted, under the guidance of my friend, to the pnson Through his interest with the guard, we were without difficulty ad mitted, and I was borne mto the chamber where the maiden by immured Even the veteran guardian of the place seemed touched with compassion for his prisoner, and supposing hei to be asleep, had the Utter placed gently near her * Une de cec couronne· de grain de corail dont lei vierge· martyre· ornoient leur* cbeveaux en allant λ U mort.

She wts half reclining, with her uce ία in her hands, upon a couch, — at the foot of which stood an idol, over whose hideous features alamp of naptha, banging from the celling, shed a wdd and ghastly glare. On a table before the image stood a censer, with a small vessel of incense bende it,—one gram of which, thrown voluntanly mto the name, would, even now, save that precious life So strange, so fearful was the whole scene, that I almost doubted its reality «Alethe t my own, happy Alethe t can it, I thought, be thou that I look upon? «She now, slowly and with difficulty, raued her head from the couch, on ob serving which, the kind Tribune with¬ drew, and we were left alone. There was a palencas, as of death, over her features, and thoae eyes, which when last I saw them, were bnt too bnght, too happy for this world, looked dim and sunken In raumg herself up, she put her liand, as nT from pain, to her forehead, whose
marble hue but appeared more death-like from those red bands that lay sé awfhKy across it After wandering vaguely for ft mmute, her eyes rested upon me, — and, with a shnek, half terror, half joy, she sprung from the couch, and sunk upon her knees by my side She had believed me dead, and, even now, scarcely trusted her senses " My husband ! my love 1 " she exclaimed, " oh, ď thou comest to call me from this world, behold I am ready I ** In saymg thus, she pomted wildly to that ominous wreath, and then dropped her head down upon my knee, as if an arrow had pierced it " Alethe 1"—I cned, terrified to the very soul by that mysterious pang, —and the sound of my voice seemed to re¬ animate her, — she looked up, with a feint smde, m my face Her thoughts, which had evidendy been wandering, be¬ came collected, and m her joy at my safety, her sorrow at my suffering, she
forgot wholly the fitte that impended over herself. Love, innocent love, alone occu¬ pied all her thoughts, and the tenderness with which she spoke, — oh, at any other moments how I would have hstened, have lingered upon, have blessed every word ' But lhe Ume flew mst — the dreadful morrow was approaching. Already I saw her writhing m the hands of the torturer, —the flames, the racks, the wheels were before my eyes f Half frantic with the fear that her resolution was fixed, 1 flung myself from the litter, m an agony of weeping, and supplicated her, by the love she bore me, by the happmess that awaited us, by her own meiciful God, who was too good to require such a sacrifice, — by all that the most passionate anxiety could dictate* I implored that she would avert from us the doom that was commg, and — but for once — comply with the vam ceremony demand¬ ed of her. Shrinking from me, as I spoke, — but with a bok more of sorrow than reproach,
— " What, thou, too ! ' she said mourn¬ fully, — « thou, mto whose spirit I had fondly hoped the same heavenly truth had descended as into my own' Oh, be not thou leagued with those who would tempt me to ' make shipwreck of my faith !' Thou, who couldst alone bind me to life, use not thy power, but let me die, as He I serve hath commanded, — die for tin. Truth Re member the holy lessons we heard on those mghts, those happy nights, when both the Present and Future smüed upon us, — when even the gift of eternal life came more welcome to my soul, from the blessed conviction that thou wert to be a sharer m it, — shall I forfeit now that divme pnvilege ? shall I deny the true God, whom we then learned to love? " No, my own betrothed, ' she con tmued, — pointing to the two rings on her finger, — " behold these pledges, — they are both sacred I should have been as true to thee as I am now to heaven, —
nor m that life to whicb I am hastening shall our love be forgotten. Should the baptism of fire, through which I shall pass to-morrow, make me worthy to be heard before the Throne of Grace, I will inter¬ cede fbr thy soul — I will pray that it may yet share with mme that ' inherit¬ ance, immortal and undefiled,' which Mercy oftere, and that thou, — my dear mother, — and I — " She here dropped her voice, the mo¬ mentary animation, with which devotion and afièction had inspired her, vanished,— and a darkness overspread all her features, a livid darkness,—hke the coming of death — that made me shudder through every limb Seizing my hand convulsively, and looking at me with a fearful eagerness, as if anxious to hear some consoling assurance trom my own lips,— « Beheve me," she continued, " not all the torments they are preparing for me, —not even this deep, burning pam m my brow, which they will haidly equal, — could be half so
dreadful to me, as the thought that I leave thee—" Here, her voice again faded, her head sunk upon my arm, and — merciful God, let me forget what I then felt — I saw that she was dying ! Whether I uttered any cry, I know not, — but the Tribune came rushing mto the chamber, and, looking on the maiden, said, with a fece full of horror, " It is but too true !" He then told me in a low voice, what he had just learned from the guardian of the prison, that the band round the young Christian's brow was —-oh hornble cruel¬ ty ! — a compound of the most deadly poison, — the hellish invention of Orcus, to satiate his vengeance, and make the fate of his poor victim secure.

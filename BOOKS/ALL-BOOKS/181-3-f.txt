Miss Trevennien to Lady Elizabeth Sheffield Manor House Never but with life will my sorrows terminate, never, till numbered with those who have been, snail I pai take of rest Alas ' how does my heart shrink at itsjtipulated obedience ! how does it recoil at all its promises of resignation and acquiescence * Ptty me—pity me, my friend, for the test of duty is at hand my father drops the seventy of com¬ mand, but he assumes the unanswerable, thj irresistible language of entreaty, he has become a suppliant to his child, and J, a bankrupt in every hope, would fam appease

Ingratitude alone could doubt the intention of sir Owen , but alas' he is dead to those little refine» ments of delicacy, else would he net urge such a soiry seirch for happiness He baffled all my objections, he tried to argue me into the espousal of his senti ments one moment he iddressed lum self to my pride, the next to my feeU ings, all were alike roused, yet could I not surmount the seeming dishonour of thus meanlj playing with the aTections of the earl—" You are a fanatic, Made- hna," said my father, " ι visiontry, who, losing sight of this woild, fo Ţets tıs inhabited

" What prudence, what interest " I ea¬ gerly demanded, *' urges my cha ige of situition ? I would live with yoi, my futher, I would seek for no happn --ss beyond " Sir Owen piused for a moment, then, with a look of entrettj, rejoined—" My peaee is near, is dear to you, Madehna jou would hve foi mv hippiness"' I wis ibout to answer, but he checked me—" Ormington loves you," he con¬ tinued , " Ormington s heait, impressed solely with your image, resists every blandishment of beiuty. Why do jou tremble ?—why do j ou turn pale, Ma¬ dehna ? jou have promised to live for my happiness," drawing me towards, him,
him , " say, my child—my dearest child, do you already retract that promise ? ' I could not speak, I could neuber ac¬ cede or negative his hopes, I could only recline my head upon his shoulder, and weep the reluctance of my heart. " Esteem is a basis not to be shaken," pursued sir Owen "tieachery has blight¬ ed the dawning expectations of love, but merit, Madehna, will excite an interest, will ensure an affection, more perma¬ nent, more grateful Lord Ormington deserves some little effoit, he has loved you long, he will survive ihe common test of time, because he is content with less than enthusiasm." Still I could not reply, alas ' if the power had been mine, what remained for me to say î Surprised, agitated, thrown off my guard, perhaps I had been hur¬ ried into some inconsistency which my judgment might have condemned I had hoped the dawn of fascination passed, I had believed the altered man¬ ners

T'ıeVmeyarl Yes, I wilt comply with your lequest t I will write by return of post, my ex¬ cellent, my ever-amiable young friend ; butnot to lure you into belief, not to hood¬ wink your judgment, even if I possessed the power, by the flowery persuasions of oratory. In truth, Madehna, friendship dares not decide a subject of sich impor¬ tance—a subject which delicacy shonld ever guarantee as the exclusive privilege of the heart neither can my pnnciples admit my hurrying you into a mamage with a mind still the prey of disappoint¬ ment
ment tnd dejection Could I know this first fatal impression weakened—could I know indifference to have superseded interest, then as ι list, as a final birrier to eveiy flight of imigmation, I might call your thoughts to the merit of a moie worthy object The mere enthusiasm of love is not essential to happiness, worth, esteem, confidence, is the firm basis of permanent good—a basis which resists tbe inroads of tune, and defies the pres¬ sure of circumstances, yei, Madelina, it is superior to the glowing ardour, of mera passion, which needs but the extinguish¬ ing breath of absence to expose its non¬ entity lfl knew the virtues—if I could analyze the heart of lord Ormington, his persevering affection, seconded by the wishes of sir Owen, might, in time, woa me to his interest, but there must be time, mv dearest girl, for I shudder at the flights of caprice, or the rash decisions of heroism I fear not for your conduct, but for your peace of mind , the one I know
I know to be guarded by pnnciple and innate honour, the other, alas * is or¬ ganized by a too refined sensibility — Think, think, mv young friend, when awakening from the trance of enthusiasm, how rayless how barren will ippear the journey of life should the staff you may precipitately choose fail in the lequi¬ site encitements of esteem and regard- should he be neglectful of the charge en¬ trusted to his care—should he fail in the grateful fulfilment of interest and affec¬ tion' ab, gı acıt us Heaven' think well ere jou act, for a wedded life, believe me, admits of no medium—it is Eden or lar lanı s , it is the balm or the gan¬ grene of the heart Fir be it from me to question the merits of the earl, per¬ sonally a stranger, I am neither actuated by the prejudice of opinion, o·· the ru¬ mour of report, Madehna, as the early friend of your deceased mother, as the interested observer of your ictions, as the trusted scrutinizer of vour motives, do

■without the outrage of mere submission, become a wife, and with that sicred pledge, receive the deirest recompence to a feeling heart—the sweet, the sooth¬ ing reflection of hav ing performed your duty—of having died to infatuation—of having lived for exertion —When I look back to wlnt I have written, I smile at my own indecision , I took the pen to decline the called foi bias of my judg¬ ment, ind in the warmth of interest, I find myself hurried into the very track I had pi ostribed pardon the inconsistency, or rather attribute it to a never slum¬ bering anxiety for your wélfire —an anx¬ iety which would fain di/e into the womb of time, and substintiate the true road to happiness happiness, ah ' Made¬ hna, happmes is the search which e'en fiom the cradle man pursues, happiness is the igras fatuus which lmes 'midst the trials ofthe woild, and leagued with hope, beguiles the pressure of calamity but it is versatile as fancy, it is unsub- stantnl
staiitial as life , its haunts are hid, its ha¬ bitation is unknown , 'tis free, 'tis uncon- fined as the air we inhale, 'tis expan¬ sive, tıs genuine as its sister-gifts from Heaven oft, when the hand exultingly graspsit, the shadow dies away, oft, when the languid eye scarce dares encounter the gathering gloom of misfortune, does its noontide beam impart the zest of coming good The miser seeks it in hts hoards—the philosopher in his studies— the hero in conquest—the author m fame, tıs but the mazy windings to the "ame goal— tıs but the varying paths to the selfsame zenith But how vain, howinefficacious are those wanderings and those labours ' I remember once reid- ing ш a little Persian tale the greit solu¬ tion of the riddle— "Happiness is the shadow of coitentment, and rests or moies for ever with tfs ongin«!

bias of partiality. Perhaps, marking the traces of sorrow m my countenance, she judged me capable ofsyinpjthy, be that as it may, she has sought my society with a', ulity, and anxiously solicited my friend¬ ship On the second· night of my first visit to Stratta Honda, long after we had re¬ tired to our chambers, by some inadver¬ tency I extinguished my light, and for the purpose ot seeking the apartment of my hostess, gioped my way into the passage Almost a sti anger to the Abbey, you will not wonder at my mistaking the turn, nor at my advancing towards a door, winch standing ajar, emitted a ray of light I paused on ibe threshold, for I heard several deep and convulsed sobs, and while 1 yet deliberated how to act, a mournful voice articulated—" Give me foittttide—give me patience oh, Fither of Heaven' shorten my wietched pil¬ grimage, and let the offering of a bleed¬ ing heart atone for sin My hour—my hour
hour is not yet come '" and the burst of tears which succeeded thnlled every chord of pity Actuated by my feelings, eager to whisper consolation, I pushed open the door, at the instant the voice of Miss Annendale thrice pionounced the name of Elltn í he creaking hinge betrayed me, I was no listenet, no mean purloin- er of another s seciet, and yet I felt abashed, unable to advance. I heai d the piercing shriek of fear, and saw Miss An¬ nendale spring forward, and, quick as thought, ettuvgi ish the light, but not befoie mj eyes had distinguished the lit tie chamber decorated as a chapel, and maiked the kneeling figure of the moui¬ ller Shrouded tn darkness, I still heard her quick breathing—I still heard the sob which spoke the smothered woe. Grieved at thp consequence of iny in¬ trusion, I would have resought mv cham¬ ber, when my arm was forcibly seized, and I felt myself hurried forward The hand
hand of my guide was cold, was tiem- bling, once she seemed to falter, but not till secure withm her own chamber did she relinquish her hold : then the light, shining on the features of Miss Annendale, beiraved the wildest emo¬ tion— betiaved the blended conflict of fear, pity, and grief Paleas death she clung to the back of a chair, hei heait sickening, hei spirit dying within her I attempted to take her hand, I spoke something of unintentional intrusion— of madveiteney—of regret, but she heeded me not— sheansweied not. Sud denly awakening, as though to the neces¬ sity of action, she spi ung towaids the door, then pausing for a moment, and turning to me—" lady Elizabeth ' ' she exclaimed, " attempt not to follow there is a seciet, theie ısa mysteiy if you would save the sanity, almost the hie, of .. fellow creature, seek not its solution '" She darted from the apaitment —she fled
fled down the passage. I listened in vain for her return : two long hours revolved, yet still did I remain in doubt. I knew not how to act ; suspense amounted al¬ most to agony ; imagination was busy, but it solved not the mystery. I had seen a female kneeling in the chapel— I hal listened to the voice of lamentation—I had heard the shriek of despair ; but why this unknown inmate was so carefully se¬ creted bafflee'e all surmise; why so per¬ petually watched—why guarded with so much caution, was a source of wonder and of doubt. The return of Miss An¬ nendale by no means silenced inquietude; I marked her swollen eye, her colourless cheek; but delicacy checked inquiry. We parted without explanation; and I confess the visions of the night teemed with the heated imagery of romance. In the morning, Miss Annendale ap¬ peared unusually thoughtful; her eyes betrayed the restless fever of long watch¬ ing, and her whole form the languor of voi,, и, о indisposition.
indisposition She evaded the anxious inquiries of her father, and not till he bad quitted the breakfast toom did she once revert to the occurrence of the past night Then she attempted something like apologj—spoke of the sensitive de¬ licacy of a convicted mind, and pictured, in glowing colours, the firm, the indisso¬ luble olaima of friendship I strove to silence her, but she interi upted me " Was the secret my own, I would baie my heart to ) our inspection , but -----' she paused, then raising her eyes fo ι une, " there are encumstances—there are situations," she ltsumed, " which )oulh shilnks from avowing, there aie inois —there are imperfections, which condition fun would hide ' M ib" Annendale wept ' Ehe last, almost the last anchor fo which my heart clung," she fallered, " and tieichery bereaved me but,' with reviving fortitude, " Heaven will yet uphold the biuised reed—will )et bleach

I will recur to the flushed moment of hope, when our little party were ushered midst the throng of Pleasure s votaries What a contrast to the drear stillness of the Manor' Oh Emily' how I love the music of tongues ' how I enjoy the charms of sociability ' in an instant »e were surrounded by a hundred dear friends—in an instant we heard a hun¬ dred congratulations ' I am so glad 5 ou »re come ' " I am so delighted to see you ' " 'Tis an age since we met, ' &c &c &c were the adulatory offerings of lips uninfluenced by a single heait But such is the tax which gemime feeling pays lo politeness—a tax, from time im¬ memorial, instituted by the laws of fa¬ shion Poor Madelina evinced neither life or eneigy, ) et spite of her pale cheek and drooping spirits she became the exciter of admiration and env) I never saw her looking half so lovely or half so in¬ teresting
teresting hers ıs a face which borrow., no charm from dress, and the snnjilicity of her attire proved but a modest con¬ trast to that profuse bla7e of jewellery beneath whose glare lime vainly seeks to hide his wrinkles Lord Ormington ısceıtaınly in league with sir Owen , he never lelt her side, and bj his artful manceuviing, distanced every other candidate Madelina is ei¬ ther blind, or too guileless to suspect ait, else surely she would fiown on the de¬ signer , but she seemed grateful for his attentions, and crept prodigiously into our watchful papa's favour by her con¬ descension As for myself, not being appıoprıated to any one, I was suffered to pursue my own course, and danced, and talked, and laughed, just as inclina¬ tion biassed. It was a motley group, Emily, such a melange of foppery and affectation—such youth-apmg dalliance —such nothing-meaning compliments' e 3 There
There was that whimsical, fastidious be¬ ing Mr Ciofton, who, " every thing by turns, and nothing long, ' is an ac tor, and a jockey, one hour aping the soft pathos of a Romeo, the next, with maniac snides, matching against time, and displaying all the gentlemanly cha¬ racteristics of scientific coachmanship Then, next on review, stands forth the ei lautest of all errant fops, Hen rv Harrington, positivei) inflated with self-sufficiency, puppyism, and imper¬ tinence, talking as though he would fain be styled a wit, and moving as though he thought himself a Ganymede in grace and beauty Heav en shield us from the degenerate herd of modern beaux ' my heart, if heart I have, is cased in adamant, for it has not once capitulated, nay, nor even condescended to parle) , but laughs at these lords of the creation, defying all the united battery of sighs, ogles, and insinuations " Take
'Take caie my pretty Rosamond,' whispered lady Anstruther, as I bowed to Hanington s requested honour of my hand " envy marks the onset, and many a fair cheek already glows with rivalry " Against what must the guard be placed? ' I demanded, smiling ш security " Certainly against your own pene¬ tration," archly replied her ladyship I shook my head m defiance, and re¬ signed my hand to my paitnei " Is that little heart vulnerable >" de¬ manded our good natili ed hostess, as Harrington fled for refreshments, " or has the close siege of a whole hour proved but labour lost ? Remember, nature has given fine eyes, white teeth, a well regulated smile, fortune a long rent roll, and education a prodigal spi¬ rit ' " Tuie, but conceit has given self-as¬ surance sufficient to counterbalance tins catalogue of recommendations, ' I re¬ plied e 4 " Pshaw,

But 'midst this, my critique on charac¬ ters, 1 must not o'eilook lady Medhurst, and lady Georgina Dresmore ; the iiret a well-jointured speculative widow, the last a blooming giri of fifty. I,ady Medhurst is one of the brightest stars ¡n the hemis¬ phere of fashion, for her superb mansion is ever open to her admiring friends, and her patronage to all candidates for noto¬ riety. She is a most profound amateur in music, enthusiastically devoted to all foreign professors, and sensitive to the mere shallow of an Italian school. But though instruction and perseverance have matured judgment, nature has not kept pace; for possessing a critic taste on the performance of others, she yet often dins the ear with the strained exertions of a voice grating and discordant.

LETTER
LETTER XIII. Lady Elizabeth Sheffield to Miss Treven¬ nion. Tlie Vmejard. V,' eu, my Madelina, aftera night of tin- broken slumber, behold me eager to le- sume my pen ; and though the sun gaily shines upon my window, and the birds tarol to allure me, yet will I not defer. the continuance of the narrative. The first occurrence which broke upon the blank of despondence was a letter from Mr. Annendale, summoning Margaret to bis arms; and the bitterest pang which succeeded the dissolution of her mother, awaited the moment in wliich she lost sight of those haunts so justly and so и 5 tenderly
tenderly remembered, in which she tore herself from the scenes of hei past hap piness, in which she kissed, in adieu the orphan Ellen, and wrung the hand of the kind-hearted Mr Bradbury Not even the devotion of Walpole, who attended her to Portsmouth, could louse hei mind from mournful abstiaction: it seemed as though her mothei died again—as though the little spot which enclosed hei w ıs as a sacred magnet to her heart, thither would her thoughts wander, and thither would she tinti, in defiance of each at¬ tracting novelty Absence luti effaced the image of hei father he had left England when the mind, unfoimed soon loses the faint simi¬ litude of early recognition—when, like the reflection on a mirror, the stene shifted, the object is tiaced no more She loved, she reverenced his virtues, she had often listened to his praises, un¬ til she had pined lo pour into his breast the homage of filial duty , but then she had
had a mother, and then the pictured union was complete. Alas ! now, solitary and alone, she was doomed to adventure the trackless deep, to endure the change of climate, to recount anew the mournful tale of widowed joy. 'It was this last an¬ ticipation whi 1. preyed so heavy on her spii its—which saddened all before her— which steeped the pleasure of a' father's presence in a father's tears. Agonizing was the moment of adieu ; Walpole lingered on the strand until the v essel could be seen no more, until fancy could no longer pierce the darkening line of ¡he horizon; yet cheered by the promises of faith, repeating oft the half- breathed vow of fond affection, he re. lied upon the firm mind of his Margaret, and banished doubt, the outrage to true love. India was now the acmé of his hopes—India the loved abode of all his heart ere pined for ; and to obtain ex¬ change, to reach herburningsancb,tinged every movement of his sanguine fancy. и 6 We
We will not trace each fond attempt but leaving the prosecution to the guid ance of his aident spirit voyage with our interesting Margaret I'rosperois was the breeze light the unfurling sails Tornine wafted о er the boundless track, and Providence warded danger Giate ful were the praise-oflermgs of the Ira veiler nerved by true piety liei spn its rose superior to clejeetion and futni uy agam was hailed with smiles Walpok was welcomed with a fither ssanclio an I life held forth whole years of tom ng bliss buch were the dav dreams of a Ucci ing period said Miss Annendale such the fairy visions of fallaciou hope )ield ing to the Ιι,,Μ play of san 0 uine youth Tianced in the fever of expectation daz zied by the variegation of its colours I traced not the buiating bubble my mo ther was not lorgotten but she was re called with compostile —she was mourn ed as lost but my fathei lived—my fa ther rose the anchor of my hopes But
But to proceed—Miss Annendale, as the tare-worn shadow of her former self e'en now pioclaims, must, at that period of recovered peace, hav e possessed every charm of nature, eveiy blandishment of education, but though assailed by hom¬ age, and the flattei ing arts of tried allure¬ ment, her faith was never shaken. Wal¬ pole reigned entire—he steeled her heart agunst every attiaction—he retained his ihiobbnig pnsonei it was not awarded by caprice, it was not sapped bv the jicnshable lure of external charms, it was a free-will offering, founded on the eternal basis of sympathy and reciprocity of mind—it was that close union of inte¬ iest and sentiment which rises supenor to everv danger, which baffles the threat of every difficulty Sifely sleeied within the swift stieam of the Ilooghley, every passing scene teeming with novelty, chained the atten¬ tion of the observant Margaret the banks niterspeised with villages, now en- nened
riched with the luscious sugar-cane, now waving in the culture of rice and corn, and now, midst darkening groves of mul¬ berry, decked with the glittering splen¬ dour of princely pagodas. But Marga¬ ret forgot all these beauties in her ap¬ proach to Calcutta. It was her father- who intercepted every object—it washer ' father who dwelt in every thought, and not. till clasped to his bosom, not till se¬ cure in his affection, did anxiety and care .slumber; nay, even then they did but exchangc,their object. Miss Annendale was not born for happiness; she possess¬ ed feelings too acute, sensibility too poig¬ nant, ever to enjoy the blessed calm ; there were ties which winged her thoughts to England—ties which clung· to her heart, which glowed with hope and Wal¬ pole. With that affection which speaks true feeling, her father questioned oft her cast of care ; and when he heard the story of the shipwreck, when he listened to the mournful
mournful tale of Ellen's loss, he vowed to be a parent to the orphan, and to ce¬ ment the bond, he called on Margaret. Tıs true, Walpole was unknown, was pooi , but Walpole possessed what kings might envy—a heart untainted, a virtue unsubdued. " ' Tıs I shall be the debtor," exclaim¬ ed the geneious Mr Annendale, " I who shall have cause for joy, for will he not ensure thy happiness, my child ?" With sentiments like these, wheie lurked one cause for feai? Walpole ar¬ rived—Walpole escaped the dangers of the sea, and Margaiet smiled in bliss But alas' even while the sun shines blight, the stoim advances—it steals as doth a thief—it obscures—it overwhelms It was the evening pıevıous to the destined solemnization of the marnage, that to com t the breeze, Mr Annendale and Margaiet descended to the shores of the Hooghly the sun had newly set, and natuie» self was wiapped m silence. Marking
Maiking the rippling current of the stream, they dieamt not of danger, tranced in stilly gloom, no faint buz/ of voices spoke the charm of civilization. Margaret blushed at the images her fa¬ ther diew—he talked of the monow— she shrunk coyly to scenes long past f hey traced not the appi oach of the mur- deier—they maiked not the blood stain- eel step of villani , alas ' the heavy gioan of agony was tlie Inst sound which raised the downcast eyes of Marg irci —the tot¬ tering, the falling foim ol her father, the first intimation ofaiufflancrew Diead ful glaied the ejes ot the rot bers, one branded high his scunner lo complete (he stioke, abeady on the feeling lic irt of Maigaret had it fallen eveiy se\uil 'etr fled, desperation nerved hei aim, and as she shrieked with almost maddened strength, she knelt to covei the devoted form, lhat shriek was heaid by Walpole .—that shriek led him to the spot, be cameni time to save, his tempered steel dispersed
'dispersed the band, but ah ' the life of Maigaret's father was ransomed by his own. The wound was deep, vvasdeadlv he gasped for bieath—he felt the chill of death—he knew no mortal hand could save—he could but fix his ejes on the despairing feitures of Ins heart's first chosen—he could but bteathe the name of I lien, and then he died. 41ı, Madelina ' is not this real woe ? — is not tins moie than the courted indul¬ gence ofsoirow?—is not heie food for melancholy, even to madness ?

Thank Ifeaven, my dear, dear friend, our Madelina is restored to us ! she has en¬ tirely recovered her senses, and the phy¬ sician gives hope of speedy convales¬ cence I Oh, lady Elizabeth ! we have all been so shocked, so tei rifled ! That cruel, treacherous, ungrateful Glenmorris, to sap a heart so pure, and then to cast it from him ! I shall never trust in man again; and for an officer—the veiy co¬ lour of scarlet will henceforth become my abhorrence. Would )ou have sup¬ posed it of him ?—would you have guess¬ ed
ed that insinuating address, that urbanity of manner, but a tloak to veil the hv po¬ ente?

If it had been me, I should not hav* felt half so much, for in pure spite I would have smiled on a new lover, but to see the sister I so deaily love spirit- bioken and deserted, is enough to ex¬ haust the patience of a hundred Jobs I forget, in thus venting my anger, that you are still a strangei ю its rise and «ause , do look then to the Herald of Mo elav and there vou will read, ' Mar¬ ried lately, on his return with clisj atibes from the armv in Spain, the gallmt cap- tun Glenmoins, of the------ regimelt to Cecilia, only d uighler and lieuess of LJ- waid Armita 0 e, esq " We

lETTLR X\IV Miss Rosamond Ireictmwn to Lady Eliza¬ beth Sheffield Mat or House Madfiina certainly ıs better, dear lady riızabeth but she is so thin, and so pale, von would scarrely know her I wish she could steal for one moment on the soli¬ tude of Glenmorris, she would scaie awa) all his happiness, and rouse him, no doubt, to self-examination 'lis in vain she preaches Christian charity and good will to man, she (almost a saint) may turn her cheek to the smiter, but my spirit would fain smite the smiter in return I may listen to the foigiveness of injuries, patience tinder sufferings, enduiance, re- loc u M Signalton,
stgnation, classed alike in the doctrines of the spirit, and the mortifications of the flesh, but not all the divines in Christen dom can make ire wish Glenmorris happy, no, no, I may pray for his amendment working the grace of paidon, but I will not remit one atom in his up-hill labour of remorse Madelina has twice attempted to write herself, but her poor hand trembled so as to be unable to guide the pen twas with regret she relinquished the task, laut weakness is imperious, and her aching head is best suited to the pillow I wi ite by her side, listening to every movement, and echoing every sigh Do you know, lady Elizabeth, if íicarí is to be found in man, I begin to think lord Ormington claims some pretensions, his is certainly placed in a rough exre nor, but his anxiety proves it alive to feeling He could not sit one moment ma place the wholeof Wednesday, pacing the passage leading to the chamber of Madelina,
Madelina, and questioning every one he met; nay, he almost condescended jo bend his knee in gratitude to me, the harbinger of returning reason;- I sup¬ pose, if the truth was known, he possesses a sneaking kindness, and like the rest of his interested sex, bas seif at bottom ; however, he went the right way to wind himself into my favour; for though I be¬ lieve my exit, and the exit of a hundred others, would occasion but little ¡merest, still he feels for Madelina, and that is a sure passport to my heart. We must not sift into the very pith and marrow of every movement, but adjudge some credit even from external circum¬ stances. If he loves her, his case is des¬ perate, for I am sure she can never love liiin ; no, not even if she had never seen, that traitor to her peace, Glenmorris: they are so opposite, it would be jump¬ ing into the lion's den at once.

Rosomaski then introduced the subject of their future mode of life, and made Ir- мп two proposils—that he should ha\e his former eottage, or some other, rent free, or that he and his daughter should reside in the castle " For myself, ' replied Irvan, " I should piefei my old solitude, to which I am ha¬ bituated , but mv daughtei cm never bc so well pliced as m thc semce of the Countess from whose example she will re¬ ceive dub benefit ' " Then tan y heie both of you,' said Kosomaski—" Zerbetta will find a friend in mj Rhodiska, and you need not pine foi your solitude, as you may live as re¬ tned, and employ yourself in what man¬ ner j ou please " Irvan and Zerbetta joyfully accepted the proposi! and Rosomaski was rejoiced at hiving found meins of diverting the grief of Rhodiska, who entered with pleasure into thc scheme of making a permanent reformation m the wandering female So humane

to embrace them before she was tamed off and to give some instructions relating to them even the officers and soldiers seemed inclined to grant her thib request, but the former ìeplied, that his ordeis were peiemptory not to suffei them to speak to any one besides himself, if he should dis rover any pi oofs of guilt Rosomaski ind Rhodiska weie th"n es- coited to the chaise, and the officer of polite got in with them, to prevent them from having any secret communication and conıertıng their defence before then examination which was to take place at Zabno The fatal trunk was placed on the litter, and the soldiers mounted, and sur¬ rounded the chaise, in which were the pri¬ soners The pıocessıpn then moved on towards Zabno, which was about three ¿leagues distant As they were on the road, Rhoclis! a after ruminating on the event of this ternble accusation, cried out— "*Ah ' my deal Rosomaski, you thought nothing of the disappearance of Doiothei and

will of Major Dauveinop She regaided th" accomplishment of the last wishes of her husband, whom she passionate!) loved, and wbo had been snatched from her at an age when men aie most amianle, as a reli¬ gious duty "When I had attained my sixteenth year, my mother told me, in an impeiative tone, that she knew how to compel mc to marry the joung Zedeo I answei ed, that no hu¬ man force should make me consent to give my hand to him, or any other man, against my inclination She reproached me m the harshest teims, with outraging the manes of my father, by refusing the husband whom he had destined lor me " I was little moved at the repimiauds and menaces of my mother, who tven car¬ ried tl e matter so far, as to vent the most direful imprecations against me I retired to my apartment, to withdraw myself from her anger " Some time after, she renewed her pro¬ posals, but, at this time, she constrained herself
herself to speak to me with ι tone of gen¬ tleness I listened attentively to vvhat she said She told me, that a more suitable much than th.it with Zedeo, could not be found for me, as we were both nearly of an a¿e, and had eich a considerable for¬ tune She added, that parents sometimes stw themselves under a necessity of oppo¬ sing the inclinations of their children, to rendet them happy, and that we should be scarcely united to each other, befoie we should both applaud a marriage for which зле now testified repugnance, be¬ cause, at our ige, we were incapable of discerning our true inclinations I iu-ţ svvered hei bv ι positive refusal, winch, however, I endeavoured to soften, that t might weai the appeaiance ot as m uth mo¬ deration as herself But her redness anı), her foiced demeanour, ev inccd sufficient!) that she did herself a violence, and that, aţ the bottom of her heart, she was trans¬ posed vv ith rage and v eviliou " A week after, she igun demanded if voi s n I vvould
I would yet consent to fulfil the intentions of Major Dauvernop ? I declared, that I still persisted in шу refusal, convinced that, by abstaining from accomplishing the indiscreet wish of my fathei, I did by no means violate the reţpeet due to his me¬ mory My answer was the signal for а new scene Unable any longer to stifle the ex¬ plosion of her discontent, she gave the reins to her anger, and forgot herself so far as to strike me I left hei hastily, she pursued me, and I should have found a difficulty in freeing myself from her ex¬ cesses, if I had not found the street-door open, and fled with all my speed " My indignation now knew no bounds, and drove me to the fatal resolution, which plunged me into the dreadful situation in which you beheld me, and which has caused such dreadful anxiety toan innocent couple I had no thoughts of raking away my life, till I passed the door of an apothecary I felt a sudden impulse, and obeyed it with¬ out reflection. I entered, and aiked for somt
some laudanum. Whether from the dis¬ tracted air whieh J must have worn, pr from the apothecary's humane caution, I cannot say, but, from what has happened, there is no doubt but that he took care the dose which he gave me should not be fatal to life. My heart was elated, when I had in my possession what I looked upon as * certain cure for all my sufferings; but I resolved not to make use of it, unless upon the greatest emergency. I concealed it carefully about my clothes, and ìeturned, home with a composure whicli surprised my mother, and indeed myself. " The next day, iny mother appeared to repent the impetuous sallies to which she had given way. She no longer spoke to me of Zedeo, nor of the will of my father, »or of the maniage which caused me so great ά terror; but the coldness of hei* manner, and her gloomy air, did not per¬ mit me to doubt that she still continued to be irritated against me. However, as rroiie of her discourse fenijed towaids Ide ν 2 projected
projected union, I thought there might bc reason for me to hope that she had totally abandoned it There were about fifteen days that I enjo)ed an appearance of α calm, at the end of which, iny mother proposed to me to accompany her on a visit, which she told me she was going to pay to one of her friends, who lived in the country As I could not refuse her with a good grace, I went with her into the- carriage We went without the walls of Cracow, and, after a joiirne) of about seven or eight leagues, I perreived that the carriage entered under a laige portico, which served as an entrance to several wings of a building, whose exterior re¬ sembled an assemblage of large and lofty edifices " The carriage stopped in the midst of a spacious area The door was opened, and I alighted first, when I heard m) mother say, m a loud tone of voice, ' Here s the young person whom you expect ' Those words caused a sudder, terror, which in¬ creased«,
11 cased, when I found myself rathei rudely seized b) two women clothed in white, and siw the carmge drive off with iny mother, it full gallop I followed it with my eves, uttering, at the same time, the most pier¬ cing cues Instantly I was no longer at a loss to guess in what sort of a house I was left As I cast my eyes round the buildings which surrounded the aiea, I remarked, that oil the windows were secured with iron bars, and I read on the top of the portico these shocking words— Coment for feintent Females " I was instantly forced into the great hall, where I beheld an old and wrinkled devotee, whose gloomy looks perfectly coiresponded with the appearance of the abode From the respect which several other recluses paid her, I judged that she was the Superior of the convent She said to me, in a snuffling tone— * lhank Heaven, my child, for having conducted you to this asylum You will iind here the means of making your peace ν 3 with
with Heaven, and of repairing the faults which you have committed. You have âriVen your mother to solicit from the go- »erhment, an order to shut you up here for the remainder of your days. Do not ïegreî the World ; ii is happy for you that you have ijuitt'ed it. You are «rrived in a safe port. Do not be afflicted at the idea tf being destined to live here perpetually : »f you love wort and piayer, if you are fmihbleand submissive, yon will iVieet with tail'd usajre ; otherwise, you will be treated with severity. We know how to subdue tkte Ittóú uhiíactablelíispbsitions. You are «gbihg tb be dressed ih the habit of the no¬ tices ; and if, in the end, you prove уоцг- ièlfoiieof the ch'ose«, you may be admit¬ ted to the rank of a hun.' " Thissiiatige harangue shocked, instead. 6f 'consoling me. I shed a torrent of tears, and intreated the Superior to inform me-, Vha't grievous offences had drawn upon 'me the cruel punishment of being immured ■during life ? She answered, lhat she had tie time
tune to entei into particulars and had no¬ thing more to say to me The two wo¬ men, who hid brought me into the audi- cnce-hill of the Supenoi, then ι onducted me to η little cell, where the) leftmeeome time, a prey to my melancholy reflections They ι eturned, bringing with them all the articles of dress of a novice, and began to substitute them in the place of my former habiliments Unhappily, I had the address to secure my bottle of laudanum " After they had finished this ta**k, they introduced me into an immense hall, where I beheld more than two hundred novices seated on benches, and occupied m needle- woik, and other femmine empio) ments Some were sewing, tambouring, and em¬ broidering , others spinning wool, fla\, or cotton most of them had their eyes cast down, and the outward appearance of hu¬ mility Ten nuns, 'inged at interval«, and armed with rods of discipline, looked round with a scrutmi7ing eye, and, with severe looks, commmded woik and silence As ν 4 soon
isoon as they saw me appear, they marked out a phce for me, and presented me with a distaff and spindle I sit down, but I felt such 1 depression of spirits, that I found it impossible to work One of the nuns perceived it, and came and cuffed me se¬ verely ' I he supper hour being come, we all went to the refei tory Roots, «id bread, and witer, composed all the articles of our repast Thesime silence reigned during supper it was not interrupted but by some devotional lecture, which one of the nuns gave with a loud voice After the repast, we were permitted half an hours recrea¬ tion Pastime and conversation filled up this interval, but the novices were forbid¬ den to whisper, or to enter into any kind of confidential discourse They were cer¬ tain of not being able to say any thing which would not be overheard by the nuns, who were continually passing and repassing between us I was not tempted to take a part in the relaxations of my companions seated
seated in one corner of the hall, with my head retiming on m) hands, I reflected on my afflicting situation, and wept in silence My combinions approached me from time to tune, and offered to console me, but I intreated them lo take no notice of me What aflcçtcıl me most piinfull) was, to tnink tint, thougli innocent and pure, I was confounded with women who, for the greater pirt, hid, b) their weaknesses or their licentiousness tarnished their reputa¬ tions At length the convent clotk sound¬ ed for evening prayer all the novices ranged in .1 circle, and threw themselves on their knees I could not witness, with¬ out gieat emotion, the contrite and peni¬ tent an of the greater part of my compa¬ nions, who, bent towards thc ground, and praying with fetvour, seemed to wish to hide their foi elieads in the dust, at the re¬ membrance of their failings " When the prayer was ended, each no¬ vice retned to hei cell. I panted for the moment of being left to myself. When n S the
the nun, to whose sitperìntendance 1 was entrusted, had carried away the light, and locked the door of my cell, 1 renewed my WBectioiis on my situation I rould »ot restrain my воЪв, by thinking that my con¬ duct was irreproachable, and that my mo¬ ther had, notwithstanding, inflicted on nie a 'cliitstisement, which was due only to the hlost, guilty excesses ' ЙШ I condemned then,' said I, ' to laïiguifch all my life in this abode of afflic¬ tion ? Whai a h'deous perspective ' Grief ■will Undoubtedly söoh terminate my days. Ì sink tinder my misery.' " Heťe 1 rnàdr so loud an exclamation, tha't theiuïn who stood guaid in the pas¬ sage o'verheard the, and bade ine Ъе sileni. Theft I «mfiiïed myself to low murmuring •fcoitfplàims, and passed the whďe «ight in ftiis pafnftìl agitation. " When the Ъ eak of day appeaťed, tho matin bell filled 'the air with its doleful chimes, to which succeeded the hafsh ''croaking of Hhe rattle, which a iitfO Unwed rapidly,
rapidly, as she Walked hastily through the galleries I Tose as mournfully as I had lain down. Prayer and spinning filled up the whole of the morning, except a very short interval, which was dedicated to what they called breakfast, but which was as fru¬ gal as the supper. We then returned to work, which occupied us till dinner, which esactly resembled the supper ,· and, aftet it, we were, in like manner, allowed half an hour's recreation, in a back yard devoted to that purpose. We again entered the hall after it was expired, to remain till the supper hour came round again. " I was too heart-broken to be able lo work like the rest ; and I could not finish fhe task which had been allotted to me, for, which the superintendant nun gave me a severe repi inland. Thc day after, I did- not work with more activity, and I was again scolded. I answered in a tone whkh expressed my indignation. ' Let 4«er bc punished 1 ' cried thc НИИ,. who presided over the hali of Work. s 6. " That
" That instant, two of the sisterhood stripped me and bestowed on iny shoul¬ ders twenty stupes, with the iod of disci¬ pline I exclaimed against such unworthy treatment, and ill my companions af¬ frighted, forgot to tuin their spindles Presently the accents of menace recalled them to their labours, but their humid and downeast eyes dıscoveıed their inward pangs One of them especnlly testified her compassion m a more open manner she was the novice who always sat at my right hand in the work room Hei ph) si- ognomy was mild and interesting, and she wore an air of melancholy, which touched Ihe very soul At the first sound of the rod of discipline, she cried out, ' Injustice '' and that single word had nearly made her a partaker of my punishment When I re¬ turned to my scat, she regarded me with ι look full of compassion I felt my heait yevn towards her—I longed to make her my friend and confídante, but the rigid silence which was prescribed us, did not permit
termit us to use any other languige than that of the ejes ' Scenes much le 3 s violent would have sufficed to make mc abhor this abode I fell into a deep melincholy I had found some little co isolation in the presence of the inteiesting novice who worked beside me the few words which she addressed to me, made me judge of the extent of her amiable qualities—but this comfort was denied me Thej replaced her by another female, whose harsh and austere looks dis¬ gusted Îne, and "made me the moie ıegret the eompmion whom I had lost I no longei siw my friend, but in the intervals of recreation, which, besides bting short, were continually interrupted by the im¬ pei tınent intrusion of the nuns, who w ould not suffer us to discourse at liberty Ne¬ vertheless, I gathered enough to give ine to understand, that an unfortunate attach¬ ment was the cause of all her sufferings^ Both of us, one day, impelled by a desire to bestow our confidence on each other, quitted,

Circumstances seem to authorize your suspicions of the fairness of your father's death : but still they are only suspicions ; anil you have no other grounds to go on than the words heaitl by old Abraham, the conversation between you and Lord Portcarris (which was witnessed by none), and what passed between that contempti¬ ble pettifogger and yourself;—altogether, I should imagine that a secret, and a secret of ininoi tance, is withheld from you—perhaps a, tci'iV, written by your father some time previous to his death. As for the horrid ctime of parricide, I think Lord Portcarrib, though he might he mean enough to secrete papers ot' im¬ portance, would not tlip his hands in blood. And in whose?— A father's I — Ko, no—it cannot be; a murderer bears not the stamp oi' such a man.

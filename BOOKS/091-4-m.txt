" You are at liberty, Madim, direct your steps that way and you will soon ar¬ rive at ι place where 5 on will find a car¬ nige to convey you to Cracow but 1 forbid you it the peril of your life, to reveil to iny person that you have been confined in the subferraneins of my castle on the shores of the lake of Guarda Paulina eagerly embraced the opportu¬ nity of quitting the presence of her per secutor, she »nlked away hastily, over¬ joyed notwithstanding her supposition thit she was at so greit ι distmce from htr friends, it once more beholding the light of day and the vincgited scenes of vegc- titive natine Alreidy hope is renewed in her heart md she begins to thirrk of the mems which she slnll employ to lettini to Genoi, which wis ntater than Ciacow, and to procure the deliverance of her pirents She walked bevond her feeble stiength, as she -imubed herself with these pleising schemes and beheld with ulmira¬ tion tht maje tic setting of Ihe stin—a sight wh nh
which she had been so long deprived of, ind despaired of ever beholding again — She continued walking, without discover¬ ing any termination of the surrounding lorcst, till fattgue compelled her to rest hersell at the foot ofa tree Either wmt of sleep during the preceding night, or the glaring light of day, to which liei eyes hid been so long unused, overcame her, and, in spite of all her endeavours, she fell into a slumber, whence she was suddenly roused by percetvirg herself nised up from the ground Slie opened her eyes and beheld a black spectre, which carried her away, gi indmg his teeth, and grinning most hoinbly, Paulina uttered a doleful cry, and became insensible When she came to herself, she perceived that she was held on tbe knees of the spectre, who, seated on a plank, and suspended in the air, slid along ι great cable, whose extremity was lost in the bottom of the abyss This descent was lighted only by a lanthorn, whose feeble light only made the darkness more fright¬ ful.
ful by rendering it visible and discovering the depth of the gulph It would be im possible to descube the tenors of Piulina who experienced such a convulsion that she would have nievitibly fillen if she hid not been retained by the stiong irm ofthe spectre At the end of half in hour she perceived the bottom ofthe ab)ss the spectre quits his vehicle and cırı les her to i vist sub terrmean hall wheie new objects of terror awaited her Every thing ap¡ eared which might impiess the m nd with the idea of its being the dark abode of demons Pau İma beheld asort of colossal figure covered with black skins ind seated on a coffin — His eyes were of the colour of fire his head bristled with horns his 1 and was armed with an iron fork whose tr pie prongs sparkled On eafh side stood two other figures whose ippeiruice was no less terrify ing and who seemed to attend his orders As soon as Paulina appeared one of them
them presented her with a paper, on which were inscribed, m lirge characters, these woids —" Give an account of youV con¬ duct to the grind chief of the infermi regions '— Pıulıııı, whoae strength of mmd was superior to this deception, threw the pipei on the ground, and said not ι v, ord The chief of the demons wrinkled his brow, gnashed his teeth, and lashed the nr with his trident, this was a signal to the two ministers, vsho instantly suspended themselves by the ìopeof in enormous bell, andrang it violently , all the echoes of the caverns repeated the thundering sounds Shortly, a troop of demons, whose figures were various, but all of a nature to inspire horror, ippeared, making such fnghtful hissings, that one would h iv e imagined himself trinsported into one of those islands which are inhabited only by legions of snikes They surrounded Paulina, and. carried her ivviy hissing furiously all the way, into anothei hall still more fr ghtful She
She pcrceised a fiery furnace, in the midst ofwhich was an enormous boiler, which seemed to resound with the cries of the victims which it cont-uned as if the\ were sulfciing all the pings of being plunged into a bath of boiling witcr The demons danced round the furnace and shouted as they cast fresh fuel on the fire Paulina was very little distncted by all these demoniac exhibitions as she was in¬ wardly preparing herself to meet thit tcimination of her sufferings which she expected She was, howevei, removed from this hall, and conducted into a sort ol dark valley, where her ears were struck with a noise resembling that which is heard in those vast abysses contained in the bow¬ els of the Alps, which are the sources of so many famous rivers She. sees the tor¬ rents falling over the rugged summit of a rock, from which a thousand congelations hung in stalactites These waters sunk at the foot of a rock, and lost themselves with a hoarse bellowing The air around was loaded with a thick mist The
The hissing demons then forced Paulina to the bottom of ι deep valley, where she siw a large reservotr, whose waters were slightly lgitated they placed her in a smill boat whtch floited near the edge, and pushing it offto ι distance, they pulled it round the reservoir by means ofa chain, one end of which was fixed to it and the other cvtremity they held in their hands As soon as Paulina saw herself alone in the boit she tmagtned thit they designed to ink it with hei, but in a few minutes her feirs changed their object AH the de¬ mons shouting with the utmost fury ipproachcd their torches to the surface of the water, which wis instantly covered with ι bluish flame, like that which proceeds from spirituous liquors, ind exhaled a strong odour of naptha and bitumen The quivering flame approached the bolt, and Paulina, either yielding it length to so many terrors, or overcome with the smell fell extended on the bottom of the boat The chief of the pretended demons, who, as
as will be easily guessed, was no other than Lanfranco himself, instantly ordered thatshe should be brought to land, and conveyed to her chamber at the bottom ot the Car- pithian caverns These orders were im mediately executed Paulina was conveyed to a cirnage, which was in waiting, and carried to her chamber, where she was placed on the bed, still insensible As the pretended demons were no other than Lanfianco nid his accomplices, so the phenomena which had been made use of to terrify the unhappy Paulina all existed m the mines of Wielitska The spectre who seized her in the forest was only one of the workmen, who had been selected foi his amazing strength the grind judge was one of the tallest workmen, ind Lanfranco and Gnmani were his two ministers The bell was that which summoned the labour¬ ers to their work after the hours of rest were expired, the large c lldron, which appeared to contain wretches punished by fire, was the boiler in which all the food of 3
of the two thousand men, generally cm- ployed in the mines, was prepared ; the groans were sent forth by some persons placed on purpose behind it. The reser¬ voir, which was meant to design a river of fire rolling through a valley of tears, was only a wonderful spring, which nature has plared in these caverns, and whose surface, constantly covered with naptha, kindles at the contart of a lighted torch. These fiery vapoursdisappear presently, when thewater is beaten with long bundles of flexible rods.*

CHAP X As soon as Paulina was put into the cirnage, the flames were extinguished in that mmnei, and Lanfranco and his accom¬ plices hastened to put every object in its usual state and to clear away all the ma¬ chinery employed to persuade Paulina that she was in the infernal regions, or rather that she hid dreamed so As all the work¬ men of the mine were to return to their libour on the next day, it was necessary to let nothing appear which might awaken the suspicions of those who were not initia¬ ted into the mysteries of Lanfranco Paulina neverawoke til! the next morn¬ ing, when, after breakfast, she saw the detested
detested Lanfianco and Gramani enter the room " I am afraid," said the former, " that your rest last night must have been disturbed by some h amble vision, as the woman who attends you infoims me that you uttered the most piercing groans " " I have seen nothing worse than you, and jour companion who iccompanies you," replied Paulina, "jou are more hideous to me thatl any other ippeaiatice whatever but you are deceived, if )ou imagine that I believ с there is any thing supematunil in those horrid sights which ) ou presented to me last night You miy terrify me, but it is out ofyour power to pervert my senses " " Be it so," rejoined Lanfranco , " I w ill no longer seek to deceive you Know, then, that you are not in the su! teirareins of my castle on the shores of the lake of Guarda, but in the caverns of the Carpa¬ thian mountains vvhich communicate with the mines of Wielitska, m the neighbour¬ hood of Cracow I reveal this to jou, voi ιν. ι. beciuse.

' As they went along, Paulina beheld the different objects, which had been made use of to terrify her on the preceding even¬ ing, the clock, the boiler, the torrents of water, and the reservoir. They next en¬ tered the cabinet of the Jew Ishmael, who was absent ; it was dug out of the mass of salt, and was a kind of subterranean pa¬ lace, but far exceeding them in the won¬ derful

whom Rosomaski had left m it, were theic at that tunc The person who officiated is steward íeceived Ludowico with all the frankness ofan honest mm, and upon his enquiring who wis the present piopnetor of Vistulof, informed him that he did not know, he was only placed theie to ìe¬ ceive the rents from the tenants, which were called for soon after the quarter-day, by a person who wis unknown to lum — Trom all that Ludowico could leim it appeared, either tint Vistulof was not the scene of Linfranco s vengeance, or that the inhabitants of thit castle were total strangers to his misdeeds Giovanno s account of his journey re¬ newed the hopes of all concerned, that some happy discovery would be speedily made A doubt whether Gramam s haunts could be those in which the Rosomaskis had suffered so much, was started by Rhodiska, who could not conceive but that she must have crossed some lake or river to reach the latter. Giovanno, who remembered the
the bi ook ov er which he had seen Giamani pass by means of the moveable bridge supposed that m -wder to deceive his cap lives he had caused them to be rowed t ρ and down on it before th" cainage md entered the mine by some other passage which was gently sloped so as to admit it Gramam s servant was questioned whether hc knew of any other entrance into the subterranean than that by means of the phtfoim * he ıeplıed that the mine must have some communication with those oí Wielitska smce he had left Giamani at the mouth of the enhance which wasdestended by the platform at night and had b) hss directions ν aited foi him at one of the entrances into the mines of Wielitska ο ι the next morning Tl is in Ihgence seemed to remo\e their dotbt and ludowico and (jiovanno accompanied by Tomaso and (n amanı s servant *юоп left Cracow for Zabno «here they deteimined to act as circumstances might require Ihev all repaire 1 to Giovanno s lodgings muffled vol iv о up

when Giovanno held him by the arm, and entreated him, in the most earnest maimer, not to ruin them all by any act pf Intem¬ perance. He represented, that if they should happen to miss in their tirst blow, Lanfranco would, in all probability, assassi¬ nate liosomaskt and Paulina, and fly be¬ yond their reach, or otherwise convés· them away with him to some other retreat, which might never be discovered ; lie added. ..it Lanfranco must have had numerous -»c.iom- pllces, to work his complicateti engines of vengeance ; and that it was more than probable he never appf.retl in puhlic, without having some, of them at hand to - prevent a surprise. Lutlowico was satis¬ fied wiih tin ... prudential remonstrances, and resumed his seat, where he continued for a fesv moments, apparently lost in re¬ flection. He then started up again, and exclaimed— " I have it : you are right, my friend, Giovanno ; we raiist make the lirst blow a sure one. It shall be so ; wait here fpr me till to-morrow." о 3 He

Notwithstanding the precautions which had been taken, Rhodiska was overcome, and sunk into the arms of Theresia, who, apprehending that that might be the case, had placed herself near at hand to receive bor. Rosomaski endeavoured to recall her to life by the most endearing caresses ; but fearing a telapse, if Rhodiska should be¬ hold
hold him, instantly on regaining her senses, Theresia prevailed upon him to ıetıre to a little distance When Rhodiska gave signs of returning sensibility, the greatest care was taken by Theresia to calm hei by de¬ gi ees, but the first excess of ecstatic joy was over, and Rhodiska s natural strength of mind enabled her to receive and retnin the embiaces of her husband and daughter, ma silent rapture, which was fir more ex¬ pressive than the most passionate excla¬ mations could have been Rosomaski, at length, recovered strength sufficient to tell Rhodiska, thit it was tune she should thank the intrepid and generous Zedeo, and his fnends Ludowico and Giovanno, for their present happiness Rhodiska peifoimed this duty with an ease, grace, and fervency, which enchanted those to whom they were addressed, and who thought that one ofthe happiest moments of their lives, in which they had contributed to the peace and hap¬ piness of so amiable a family When Rho¬ diska advanced to embrace Giovanno, arid t pour
pour out to hım the ardent effusions of liei grateful heart, he replied, casting an ex¬ pressive look at Paulina—" Amiable Rho¬ diska ' y ou may save yourself the trouble of thanking me, I am already recompensed to the utmost extent ofmy wishes "—Rho¬ diska and Paulina understood him, and the former, taking a hand of eich, clasped them together, and said, in a low tone— " There is now only one othei addition to our happiness, which, I hope, will not be long delayed " " If you mean by that, Madam,* repl.ed Giovanno, " the ceremony which is to make all my future happiness, it has already been too long delayed by a cruel interrup¬ tion I hope the lovely Paulun will con¬ sider what I hav e suffered during this dread¬ ful interval, and defer my felicity no longer than-------' " The day after tormorrow," rejoined Rhodiska At that instant, young Ladislaus, who had been sent for by Theresia, entered the room,

been adjudged to account to Rosomaski for all the monies which himself and his father had received from those estates during the interval between the death of Rosomaski s fatter and the time of making the decree This account which would hive imounted to in immense sum had nevei been settled and the money due from Lanfnnco to Rosomaski was consıdeıably more than what the latter hid receiv ed when he sold theestates Iherewisnoioom therefore for the dehcicy of Rosomaski tohesititeat considering himself as the undoubted pro prtetor of those still revered spots which had been the possessions of his and Rho dıska s ancestor») and the scenes of moments of ι ispeakable happiness to themselves in spite of the horrible misfortunes with which they had been so strmgely che quered The mutual attachment of Rhodiska and Rosomaski and the happiness which the two young lovers Paulina ind Giovanno were going te enjoy brought the conver·· sation

" These mistaken ideas of my friend have, I believe, given way to matuier rea¬ son," sud Rhodiski "but here she comes, I will put the question to herself, and I hav e no doubt she will confess her errors with her usual frankness ' Theresia at that moment had enteied the room in search of her fr.end, whom she had -missed finding in hei own apartment *· My dear Theresia," continued Rho¬ diska, " my friend Ludowico and myself hav e had a little argument on your account, and you are come m time to decide be¬ tween us He imagines lhat your heart is still insensible to the tender passion, and I nnintain the contrarj , which of us is in the right ? ' Theresia was seized with an emotion which she could not conceal, her lips qui- veied, her eyes were downcast, and she could not speak " Come, come, my dealest Theresia '** added Rhodiska, " it is nobler to confess that we have been in an error than to en¬ deavour to conceal it Confess that you now
dow think that there aie men who are wor¬ lhy of all our confidence and tenderness ' " I will confess," replied Theresia, gain¬ ing courage, and endeavouring to assume a sportive air, " that 1 have witnessed one such example in your Rosomaski, but one should stand very little chance in a lottery which has only one prize to so many thou¬ sands of blanks Have you never heard the opinion of one of their own sex, a French writer, on the subject ?" " Not that I remember, ' replied Rho¬ diska *' It is this — ' €u peut on trouver des amans, •Эш nous soient i jamais ndellea " 11 n en est que dans les [oRlans, Ou dans les nida des tourteicllei " Poetiy, my dear Theresia replied Rhodiska, " you know is only fiction, agieeably wnpt up, do let us descend to humble prose " a 8 * I tell

GLENARVON.
CHAPTER h In the morning Calantha beheld crowds of discontented catholics who thronged the outer courts waiting to see her father« Petitions for redress w 7 ere thrown in at tlie windows; and whilst they were at breakfast, Sir Everard entering, without even waiting to see who was present, asked eagerly if the Duke were athome: he, at the same moment gave a huge paper closely written, into the hands of one of the servants, desiring it to be instantly delivered to the Duke; " and tell him, sir," vociferated the doctor, " it is my case written out clear, as he commanded —tliat which I had the honour to present to him t'other day, when he had not lei¬ sure to look upon it:" then turning round» Vol. II. В
and seeing Calantha, " By my soul/* he exclaimed, " if here ain't my олуп dear Lady Calantha; and God be praised Ma¬ dam, you are come amongst us; for the devil and all ¡s broke loose since you've been away. Let's look at you : луеН, and you are bs tall and handsome iis ever; but I—Oh! Lady Calantha Delaval, begging your pardon, w ? hat a miserable wretch am I become. Lord help me, and deliver me. Lord help us all, in unmerited af¬ fliction/' Calantha had not heard of SirEverard's misfortunes; and was really afraid to ask him what had occurred. He held her hand, and wept so audibly, that she al¬ ready 8алу some of those present turning away, least they should not be able to conceal their laughter : hisstrangegestures were indeed a hard trial. " Be pacified, calm yourself my good Doctor," said Mrs. Seymour, giving him a chair: " Heaven forfend," said Sir Everard: " Nature, adam, will have a vent. I «am the most
miserable man alive: I am undone, yon well know; but Lord! this dear child knows little if any thing about it. Oh! I am a mere nothing now in the uni¬ verse." Gondimar, with a smile, assured Sir Everard that could never be the case, whilst he retained, unimpaired, that full rotundity of form. " Sir, are you here?" cried the Doctor fiercely: u but it is of small importance. I am no longer the soft phlegmatic being you left me. I am a wild beast, Sir—a dangerous animal.— Away with your seoflk—I will fight, Sir —murder, Sir—aye, and smile whilst I murder," There was something in these words which turned Lady Margareťs cheeks to u deadly pale; but the Doctor, who had sought for forcible expressions done, without the least heeding the application, continued to, storm and to rage. " I'm a man," he cried, " accustomed to suffer¬ ings and to insult. Would you credit it dear Lady Calantha : can you comprehend в 2
itj?— that lawless gang—those licentious democrats—those rebellious libertines, have imposed on the inordinate folly of my wife and daughters, who, struck mad» like Agave in the orgies of Bacchus, are running wild about the country, their hair: dishevelled, their heads ornamented with green cockades, and Lady St. Clare, to the shame of her sex and me, the pro¬ perty of a recruiting serjeant, employed by one of that nest of serpents atthe ab¬ bey, to delude others, and all I believe, occasioned by that arch fiend» Glenar¬ von." " Oh!" cried Gerald Mac Allain, who was in attendance at the breakfast table, " saving your honour's pardon the young Lord of Glenarvon has been the cause of my two brave boys being saved from the gallows. I will rather lose my life, than stand to hear him called an arch fiend/ 1 " He is one, old Gerald, whether you or I calj him ì sg or no. Witness how* the other night, he set the rabble with their
î
torches to burning Mr. O'Flarney^ barns, and stealing his sheep and oxen and all his goods." "Och iťs my belief the Rector of Belfont, when he comes, will speak a word for him thoft," returned Gerald Mac Allain ; " for, save the presence of the Duke, who is not here to hear me, he has been our guard and defence all the while his grace's honour has been out of the kingdom." " Curses light upon liim and his gang," cried Sir Everard, furi¬ ously. Are not Miss Laura and Miss Jes¬ sica after him at this very time, and my pretty niece, my young, my dear Elinor, and Lady St. Clare, more crazy than all, is not she following him about as if he were some god ?" 44 The whole country are after him," cried Gerald Mac Allain, enthusiastically: 44 Tis a rage, a fashion," " Tis a phren¬ zy," returned the Doctor,— 4i a pestilence which has fallen on the land, and all itis my belief, because the stripling has not one christian principle, or habit in him: вЗ
he is a heathen/' " If it is the young Glenarvon," said Gondimar, approaching the irritated Doctor, " he is my friend." " Do not I beseech you, bring any of your knock me down arguments to me, Sir. His being your friend, only gives in my opinion/' a blacker shade to his character, ** Sir, I hate personal at¬ tacks." " A blow that hits, Count, and a cap that fits, are sure to make the sufferer look foolish, excessively foolish: I never believed in baseness and malignity till I knew the Count Gondi¬ mar." " Nor I in arrogance and stupi¬ dity, till I knew Sir Everard." " Count, you are the object of my astonishment," " And you, Sir, of my derision." " Ita¬ lian, I despise you." " I sliould only feel mortified, if Sir Everard did otherwise." " The contempt, Sir, of the meanest, cannot be a matter of triumph." " It is a mark of wisdom, to be proud of the scorn of fools/' Passion makes me naad." " Sir, you ivere that before/'
" I shall forget myself." u I wish you would permit me to doso," " A truce to these quarrels, good doctor," said the Duke, who had entered the room during the latter part of the dis¬ cussion. " I have been reading some papers of a very serious nature ; and 1 am sorry to say it appears from them that Sir Everard has very great cause for his present irritation of mind: he is an aggrieved man. This Lord Glenarvon, or whatever the young gentleman styles himself, has acted in a manner not only unjustifiable, but such as I am afraid will ultimately lead to his entire ruin. Count Gondimar, I have often heard you speak of this unfortunate young man, with more than common interest. Could not }ou make use of your friendship and in¬ timacy with him, to warn him of the dan¬ ger of his present conduct, and lead him from the society of his worthless associ¬ ates. He seems to be acting under the influence of a mad infatuation/' Gondimar в 4
assured the Duke that he had no sort of influence with the young Lord. " Read these papers, at your leisure/' said the Duke: " they are statements, you will find, of a number of outrages committed by himself «and his followers, on people highly respectable and utterly defence¬ less. For the common follies of youth, there is much excuse; but nothing can palliate repeated acts of licentious wick¬ edness and unprovoked cruelty» I «am inclined to believe these accounts are much exaggerated; but the list of griev¬ ances is large ; and the petitioners for re¬ dress are m«any of them my most worthy «and long-tried servants, at the head of whom O'Flarney's name is to be found." " No, my Lord,—mine is at the head of the list," cried the doctor; " and in every other part of it, no injuries can be equal to mine. What are barns, pigs, fire¬ arms, compared to a father's лугоп§« — a husband's injuries. Ah, consider my case first. Restore Miss St. Clare, and I will
be pacified. Why do I raise laughter by my cry? It ¡s my niece, niy favourite child, who lias been taken from me. 1 * " ţ*ray explain to me seriously, Sir," said Lady Augusta, approaching the doc· tor, irith much appearance of interest, 44 Ыщ came your family to fall into the unfortunate situation to which you ah lude?" " How came they," s^d the Count? can you ask, when you see Sir Everard at the head of it?" " Madam," said the Doctor with equal solemnity, 44 this momentous crisis has been ap¬ proaching some time. St. Clara, as we called her, mv most lovelv and interest- ing Elinor's affections have long been seduced. We all knew 1 , lamented and concealed the circumstance. The old lady's conduct, however, was quite an unexpected bloiv. But since tbey took to their nocturnal rambles to St. Mary's, St* Alvin's, and all the saints around, their sanctity has not beeu much mended that в 5
I see, and their wits are fairly overset. My own disgrace lean easily support: but oh mv Elinor ! " What nocturnal meetings have taken place at St. Mary's and St. Alvin's?" said Lady Trelawney, with a face of eager cu¬ riosity. " The discontented flockttoge- ther in shoals," said the Doctor, indig¬ nantly, " till by their machinations, they will overturn the State. At Belfont, op¬ posite my very window,—aye, even in that great square house whicli Mr. Ochal- lavan built, on purpose to obstruct Lady St. Clare's view, have they not set up a library? The Lord help me. And was it not there I first saw that accursed pamphlet Lord Glenarvon wrote ; which rhapsody did not I myself immediately answer? Lady Calantha, strange things have oc¬ curred since your departure. General Kennedy, commander of the district, cannot keep his men. Cattle walk out of the paddocks of themselves: women, children, pigs, wander after Glenarvon;
and Miss Elinor, forgetful of her old father, my dear mad hrother, her aunt, her religion, and all else, to the scandal of every one in their senses, heads the rabble. They have meetings under ground, and over ground ; out at sea, and in the caverns: no one can stop the infection: the poison is inthe fountain of life; and our very persons and estates are no longer in safety. You know not, y ou cannot know, what work we have had since you last left us," Sir Everard paused, and then taking a couple of pamphlets from his pocket, entreated Calantha to peruse them. " Cast your eye over these," he said : " I ivrote them in haste ; they are mere sketches of my sentiments; but lam going to publish. Oh ! when you see what I am now going to publish. It is intituled a refutation of all that has or may be said by the dis¬ affected, in or out oí the kingdom.
CHAPTER II. The party at the castle had postponed their visit to St, Alvin Priory till the feast of St. Kathereen and St, Mary, which in that neighbourhood was always cele¬ brated with much observance, A fair was held upon the downs in honour of these two martyrs. The rocks near which the ruins of the convent stood, were called the Black Sisters, and it was there and in the Wizard's Glen, which stretched from the top to the foot of the mountain, that the meetings of the dis¬ contented had been held. The day proved fair ; and at an early hour the carriages and horses were in attendance. Mrs. Sey¬ mour and many others declined being of the party ; but Lady ]\f argaret took Gon- dimar's arm with a smile of good hu¬ mour, which she could at times put on.
Buchanan drove Calantha in his barouch. Sir Everard rode by Calantha's side on a lowly white palfrey, as if to protect her. Lady Mandeville was with her ; «and Lady Trelawney took Sophia anil Lady Augusta Selwyn in her carriage. The rest of the gentlemen were some on horseback and some in curricles. The whole country smiled «around. There were ringers, and pipers, and hur lers upon the down. The cliff, tow-ards the sea, w«as covered with booths and tents. Flocks, herds and horses had been brought from far for side, orna¬ mented with ribbands ; green being tiie favourite colour. Scarcely ever w«as wit¬ nessed a scene more gay. This, «and the vessels laden with fish, crowding into the harbour below, and the high mountains beyond, struck even the Italian, whose eyes had been accustomed to all that nature can produce qf picturesque and majestic. The beauty of the girls, with their long blue mantles thrown aside
from their shoulders, their dark hair fas¬ tened behind with a knot of ribband, was the subject of discussion. Comparisons of the difference of form between one nation and another arose. All descended from their carriages and horses. Lady Mandeville repeated poetry ; Gondimar became sentimental ; Buchanan looked at the horses, enquired their prices, and soon joined the hurlers, in whose combat he greiv so much interested, that no one could draw him from thence until the moment when they left the fair, where they remained till they were all much fatigued. " What are you laughing at so im¬ mensely ?" cried Lady Augusta Selwyn, approaching Lord Trewlawney, who was nearly enclosed in a circle of some hun¬ dreds. The moment Lady Augusta ap¬ proached, with a courtesy seldom seen but in Ireland, the crowd made way for her. " I am listening," he said, " to a preacher—a most capital preacher, whom
they call Cowdel O'Kelly. Only observe him : what a rogue it is, with that hypo- critic mildness of manner, that strait black hair, that presbyterian stiffness and simplicity." " But what is he say¬ ing ?" enquired Lady Augusta. The preacher, standing upon a cart, was de¬ livering an exhortation in a very emphatic manner, to a vast concourse of attentive hearers. The presence of the party from the Castle had no effect upon him : he ivas inveighing against the insolence of his superiors in rank, and pleading in favour of the rights of man. When he had concluded his discourse, ihe crowd dispersed, some laughing at him, and some edified by his dis¬ course, O'Kelly looked after them :— " That is the way of the world/* he said : 44 it gets all it can from a man, and then it leaves him ; but all that is, is for the best ; therefore, amen, your honours; so be it/* Lord Trelawney laughed to an excess. " Yourname," hesaid,"Itakeit,itisCow-
del O'Kelly/* " If you take it to be my name, your honour can't be any ways wrong in calling me by it ; but I call myself citizen Wadman/' " And why the devil, my honest friend, do you call yourself so?" " To please myself, and trick my master." "And pray who is your nmster?" " When I know that I'll let you know/' " What î not know your master ?" " Why what master knows his servant ? There's nothing ex¬ traordinary in that, my Lord/' " But pray, my good citizen Wailman, where do you live, and where does your master live ?" " I live where I can, your honour; «and m to my master, every one knows he lives under ground, in the family vault/* " Is he dead then, or what can he be doing under ground?" said Lady Tre¬ lawney. " Looking for friends, Miss, 1 believe ; for he bm none, that I see, abovç board." " lam sure this is a rebel in disguise," whispered lady Trelawney* Her Lord laughed.
A beautiful little boy now pushing his way through the crowd, plainly pro¬ nounced the words, " O'Kelly, eome home ; I am very tired." The man, has¬ tily descending from the cart, called him his young prince — his treasure ; «and lifted him up in his arms. M He is about the same «age as Harry Mowbrey/* said Calantha, " «and very like him/* What is yonr name, my pretty child ?" " Clare of Costolly," sæd the boy; "and it should by rights be Lord Clare-Hshould it not, O'Kelly ?" As he spoke, he smiled and put his little rosy hands to O'Kelly^ mouth, w ho kissed them, and making a slight bow would have retired. " What, are you going ? will you not stay a mo¬ ment ?" " I fear I intrude too much on your honour's time." " Not in the least— not in the least, good Mister Wailman ; pray stay a little longer," " Why, fair and honest, if I don't intrude too much on your time, my Lord, yon do on mine ; «and so your servant."
44 I really believe he belongs to the abbey," said Lady Trelawney, who had re-entered her barouche, and was driving with the rest of the party towards St. Alvin Priory. 44 See how he steals along by the cliff in the same direction we are going." 44 It was a lovely child," said Lady Augusta, 4t but to be sure no more like Harry ; only Lady Avondale is always in the seventh heaven of romance." 4C Look, pray look," interrupted Frances : 44 I as¬ sure you that is Sir Everard St. Clare's wife, and Lauriana and Jessica are with her. 1 am certain of it," she continued, throwing herself nearly out of the car¬ riage to gaze upon them. Lord Trelaw¬ ney was extremely diverted. 4t And there is the recruiting serjeant : only ob¬ serve the manner in which tliey are habited." The two unhappy girls, drest in the most flaunting attire, singing in chorus the song of liberty, both covered with green ribbands, were walking in company with a vast number of young
men, most of them intoxicated, and all talking and laughing loudly. Calantha begged Buchanan to stop the carri-age, that she also might see them pa^: which they did, marching to the sound of the drum and fife : but her heart sickened when she saw the beautiful recluse of Glenaa amongst them. Elinor came near : she raised her full black eye, and gazed with fearless effrontery upon Ca¬ lantha. It was the same face she had seen a few years back at the convent : but alas, how changed ;—the rich and vivid crim¬ son of her cheek, the deep dark brown of the wild ringlets which waved abovç her brow, the bold masculine manners and dress she had assumed, contrasted strongly with the slender beauty of her upright form. She was drest in uniform. and walked by the side of a young man, whose pale and thoughtful countenance struck every one. Elinor appeared des¬ perate and utterly hardened : her pre-
sence inspired Calantha with a mixed feeling of horror and commiseration, which Lady St. Clare's ludicrous figure, smd Jessica and Lauriana's huge and clumsy personages turned into disgust. 44 Oh did you behold her ?—did you see my poor deluded Elinor?" cried Sir Everard, riding up to Calantha, as she still gazed from the open carriage upon the procession: " did you see my unfor¬ tunate girls ?" 4t I did, indeed," said Lady Avondale, the tears springing into her eyes : u I saw them and stopped ; for it occurred to me, that, perhaps, I might speak to them·—might yet save them." 44 And would you have condescended so much ? Oh ! this is more than I dared to ask or hope." Saying which, the Doctor wept, as was his custom, and Buchanan laughed, " You are so good," continued he, " you were in tears when you saw your former playmates disgracing themselves, «and their sex ; but in the rest of the carriages I he^rd
nothing but jesting and loud laughter. And oh ! would you credit it, can you believe it, Lady St. Clare had the auda¬ city to drop me a courtesy as she passed." " Was the tall young man, who was walking by the side of Elinor, Cyrel Linden ?" 4t It was the same," cried the Doctor— " gone mad like the rest, though they tell me it is all for the love of Miss Alice ; and that since her loss, he is grown desperate, and cares not what becomes of him. They'll be hang'd, however ; that is one consolation—Lady St. Clare, as well as the rest. Indeed,'* cried he, drawing closer, 44 1 am credibly informed that the officers of justice have an eye upon them, and wait only for fur ther evidence of their treasonable prac¬ tices, before they secure them." During this discourse, the carriage drove slowly up the hili; but soon proceeding at a brisker pace, the Doctor was obliged to draw in his steed and retire. The party now entered the park.
CHAPTER III. Beleont Abbey and St. Alvin's ruined Priory appeared in vieiv. The ivy climbed around the turret ; and the grass grew upon the paved courts, where deso¬ lation and long neglect prevailed. At a distance from the convent, a ruin, a lone¬ ly pile stood upon the cliff in solitary grandeur. Not a tree, nor any appearance of cultivation was seen around: barren moors, the distant mountains, and the vast ocean, every ллЬеге filled the eye. The servants rang at the bell of the outer gate : it resounded through the vaulted passages лукЬ a long repeated echo.— A boy immediately answered the sum¬ mons; and with a look of stupid asto¬ nishment, Λναίίεΰ in expectation of their commands. Buchanan enquired of the boy, if they
might see the Priory. "I suppose so," was his reply. And without further preamble, they alighted. " It must be rather me¬ lancholy to live here during the winter months," said Calantha to the boy, as she passed him. " And summer too," he ansivered. " We are told," said Frances, " that this Priory is haunted by ghosts : have you ever seen any ?" He shook his head, " I hears them some¬ times, an' please your honour," he said ; but I never meddles with them, so they never conies after me as 1 see," Are you going to shew us the house ?" cried Sir Everard advancing ; or, if not, why do you keep us waiting in tliis dark passage? go on ; we are in haste." The boy, pro¬ ceeding towards an inner apartment. knocked at the door, calling to the housekeeper, and telling her that there was company below ivho wished to take the round of the castle. The old dame courtesying low, in a mysterious manner, 4
led the way: the boy immediately re¬ treated. Calantha was much tired ; her spirits had undergone a severe shock ; aud the sight of Linden and St. Clara, rø she was still called; made an impression upon her she scarcely could account for. The gaiety of the dresses, the fineness ofthe evenľng.thecho^ofvoiceslaughingand singingas they marched along, indifferent apparently to' their future fete—perhaps, hardened and insensible to it—all made an impression which it is impossible the description of the scene can give ; but lo% it dwelt in her remembrance. Ur «seď to check herself in any feeling, she insisted upon remaining in front of the Castle, whilst thé rast of the party ex¬ plored its secret mysteries and recesses. "I am sure you ate frightened^* said Lord Trehwney; u but perhaps you will have more cause than vre: it looks very gloomy without, m well m within/* They went, and she remained upon the
cliff, watching the calm sea, and die boats at a distance, «aa they passed and repassed from the fikir .. · And can a few short years thus harden the heart ?" she exclaimed» 4i was St. Clara innocent, happy, virtuous? Can one moment of errorthushavecbanged her ? Oh ! it is not possible. Long before the opportunity for evil presented itself» her uncontrouled passions must have misled her, «and her imagination, wild «and lawless, must have depraved her heart. Alice was innocent: he who first seduced her from peace, deceived her ; but St. Clara was not of this character, I understand—1 think I understand the feelings which impelled her to evil. Her image haunts me: I tremble with appre¬ hension. Something witiiin seems to warn me, and to say that, if I wander from virtue, like her, nothing will check my course, ail the burners, that others fear to overstep, «are nothing before me. God preserve me from sin! the sight of St. Clam fills ше with alarm. Avondale, You II. С
where ^t thou ? save me. My course is but just begun : who knows whither the path I follow leads ? my will—my tin- governed will, has been hitherto, my only law." Upon the air at that moment she heard the soft notes of a flute. She listened attentively :—it ce-ased. There are times when the spirit is troubled; when the mind, after the tumult of dissipated and active life, requires rest and seeks to be alone. Then thoughts crowd in upon us so fast, that we hardly know how to bear them ; conscience reflects upon every former action ; and the heart within trembles, as if in dread of approaching evil. The scene around was calculated to inspire every serious reflection. The awful majesty of the ruined building, iil accorded with the loud laugh and the jests of the merry party now entering its walls. Jnce those walls had been, per¬ haps, inhabited by beings as thoughtless and gay: Where were they noiv? had
they any memory of the past? knowledge of the present ? or are they cold, silent, and insensible as those deserted scenes ? how perishable is human happiness î what recollection has the mind of any former state ? in the eye of a creator can a mite, scarcely visible, be worth either solicitude or anger ? 44 Vain the presumptuous hope," said Calantha to herself. 44 Our actions are unobserved by any but ourselves ; let us enjoy what we can whilst we are here ; death only returns us to the dust from whence we sprung; all hopes, all interests, ail occupations, are vain : to forget is the first great science ; and to enjoy, the only real object of life. What happiness is there here below, but in love." So reasoned the unhappy victim of a false judgment and strong passion, I was blest ; I am so no more. The world is a wilderness to me; and all that is in it, vanity and vexation of spirit.... Whilst yet indulging these fallacious opinions—whilst gazing on the western c2
turret, and watching the shadows as they varied on the ïvdls, she again heard the soft notes of music. It seemed like the strains of other times, awakening in the heart remembrances of some former state long passed and changed. Hope, love and fond regret, answered alternately to the call. It was in the season of the ye^ when the flowers bloomed : it was on a spot immortalized in ancient story, for deeds of prowess and of fame. Ca¬ lantha turned her eyes upwards and be¬ held the blue vault of heaven without a cloud. The sea was of that glassy transparency—thatshiningbrightness,the air of that serene calm that, had it been during the winter months, some might have thought the halcyon was watching upon her nest, and breathing her soft and melíuicholy minstrelsy through the air. She endeavoured to rouse herself. She felt as if in a dream, and, hastily advancing to the spot from whence the sounds proceeded, she there beheld a
youth, for he had not the form or the look of manhood, leaning against the trunk of a tree, playing at intervals upon a flute, or breathing, as if from a suffer¬ ing heart, the 8Λν€€ί melody of his un¬ taught song. He started not when she approached :—he neither saw nor heard her—so light was her airy step, so fixed were his eyes and thoughts. She gazed for a moment upon his counten-ance— and she marked it. It was one of thoselaces whicb, having once beheld, we never afterwards forget. It seemed as if the soul of passion had been stamped «and printed upon every feature. The eye beamed into life as it Шгелу up its dark ardent gaze, with a look nearly of inspi¬ ration, луЫ1е the proud curl of the upper lip expressed haughtiness and bitter con¬ tempt ; yet, even mixed with these fierce characteristic feelings, an air of melan¬ choly and dejection shaded over and softened ел г егу harsher expression. Such c3
countenance spoke to the heart, and filled it with one v^ue yet powerful interest— so strong, so undefinable, that it could not easdy be overcome. Calantha felt the power, not then alone, hut evermore. She felt the em¬ pire, the charm, the peculiar charm, those features, that being must have for her. She could have knelt and prayed to hea¬ ven to realize the dream, to bless the fallen angel in whose presence she at that moment stood, to give peace to that soul, upon which w«as plainly stamped the hea¬ venly image of sensibility and genius. The air he had played was wild and plaintive: he changed it to one more harsh. She now distinctly heard the words he sung:— This heart has never stoop'd its pride To slavish love, or woman's wile; But, steel'd by war, has oft defy'd Her craftiest art and brightest smile.
This mind bas trac'd its own career, Nor followed blind, where otheis trodj Nor, mov'd by love, or hope or fear, E'er bent to man, or worshipped God« Then hope not now to touch with love, Dr in its chains a heart to draw, All earthly spells have fail'd to move; Aud heavVs whole terrors cannot awe: A heart, that like some mountain vast, And cold with never-melting snow, Sees nought ahove, nor deigns to cast A look away on aught below. An emotion of interest—something she could not define, even to herself, had im¬ pelled Cal-antha to remain till the song was ended: a different feeling now prompted her to retire in haste. She fled; nor stopped, till she again found herself opposite the castle gate, where she had been left by her companions. While yet dwelling in thought upon the singular being she had beheld— с 4
whilst asking herself what meant this sudden, this strange emotion, she found another personage by her side, and recog¬ nized, through a new disguise, her morning's acquaintance, Wailman the preacher, otherwisecalled Cowdel O'Kelly. This recontre gave an immediate turn to her thoughts, She enquired of him if he ivere an inhabitant of Belfont Ab¬ bey? " No, madam," he answered, "but of St, Alvin Priory." She desired him to inform her whether any one resided there who sung in the manner she then described. u Sure, then, 1 sing myself in that manner," said the man, " if that's all ; and beside me, there be some who howl and wail, the like you never heard. Mayhap it is he you fell in with; if so, it must have moved you to tears." " Explain yourself," said Calantha eagerly. u If he is unhappy, it is the same I have seen and heard. Tell me what sorrows have befallen him?" " Sor¬ rows! why enough too, to plague any
man. Has he not got the distemper?" « The distemper !" " Aye, Lady ? for did he not catch it sleeping in our dog-ken¬ nel, as he stood petrified there one night, kilt by the cold ? When my Lord found him, he had not a house to his head then, it is my belief; but now indeed he*s got one, he's no wiser, having, as I tliink, no head to his house." "Och! itwould sur¬ prise you how he howls and barks, when¬ ever the moon shines bright. But here be those who fell on me at the fair, in truth I believe they be searching for the like of you."
С О
CHAPTER IV. The party from the castle now joined Calantha, They were in evident discom¬ fiture. Their adventures had been ra¬ ther less romantic than Lady Avondale's, and consequently had not given them such refined pleasure ; for ivhile she ivas attending to a strain of such enchanting sweetness, they had been forcibly detained iu an apartment of the priory, unwillingly listenin«' to verv different music. The housekeeper having led them through the galleries, the ladies, escorted by Count Gondimar, Lord Trelawney and Sir Everard, turned to examine some of the portraits, fretted cornices and high casements, till the dame who led the way, calling to them, shewed them a large dreary apartment hung with tape¬ stry, aud requested them to observe the
view from the window. " It is here/* she said, " in this chamber, that John de R uth ven drank hot blood from the skull of his enemy and died." A loud groan, at that moment, proceeded from an inner room. " That must be the ghost," said Lord Trelawney. His Lady shrieked. The dame, terrified at Lady Trelawney's terror, returned the shriek by a piercing yell, rushed from the apartment closing the heavy door in haste, ivhich fastened with a spring lock, and left the company not a little disconcerted. " We are a good number, however/* cried Frances, taking fast hold of her Lord, who smiled vacantly upon her. " We certainly can match the ghost in point of strength : but it is rather unplea¬ sant to be confined here till that old wo¬ man recovers her senses. Groans most piteous and terrible interrupted this re¬ mark—groans uttered as if in the agony of a soul ill at rest. Sophia grasped Sir Everard St. Clare's hand. Sir Everard
looked at Lady Margaret. Lady Marga- ret disdainfully returned the glance." " 1 fear not," she said; "but we will assured¬ ly have this affair examined. I shall speak to my brother the moment I return : there is possibly some evil concealed which requires investigation." " Hark? I hear a step," said Frances. " If I were not afraid of seeing a ghost," cried Lord Trelawney, " faith, I would climb up to that small grated window." " I fear no ghosts," replied Couut Gon¬ dimar, smiling. " The sun has not set, ihereforel defy them thus.—Only takecare and hold the stool upon the table, that 1 may not break my neck." " What do you see?" "A large room lighted by two candles:—would it were but a lamp." u Truly this is a fair beginning.—What is the matter now ?—why what the de¬ vil is the matter ?—If you come down so precipitately I cannot support you. Help ! the Count is literally fainting." It was true. " A sudden dizziness— a palpita*
tion"— He only uttered these words and fell ; a ghastly paleness overspread his face ; the cold damps stood upon his forehead. 44 This is the most unfortunate con¬ firmation of the effects of terror upon an evil conscience," exclaimed Sir Everard, 44 that ever I beheld. I'll be bound there is not an Irish or Englishman here, tlmt would have been so frightened." 44 It is a dizziness, a mere fainting fit," said Gon¬ dimar. u Let me feel his pulse," cried Sir Everard. 4i Well Doctor," 4 * AVell, sir, he has no pulse left :—give him air :" u I am better now," said Gondimar, with a smile as he revived, 44 Was 1 ill enough for this ?" Sir Everard called in. Lord Trelawney*s curiosity engaged him to climb to the grated window ; but the candles had been extinguished, probably, for all beyond the window was utter darkness. Whilst some were assisting the Count, the rest had been vainly endeavouring to
open the door. A key was now heard on the outside ; and the solemn boy entering, said to Lady Margaret, " I am come to tell your honour that our dame being taken with the qualms and stericks, is no ways able of shewing you any further into the Priory." " I trust, however, that you will immediately sheiv us out of it, Sir," said Gondimar. " It not being her fault, but her extrame weakness," continued the boy : she desires me to hope your honours will excuse her." " We will certainly excuse her ; but," added Lady Margaret, " I must insist upon knowing from her, or from some of you, the cause of the groans we heard, and what all those absurd stories of ghosts can arise from. I shall send an order for the house to undergo an imme¬ diate examination, so you had better tell all you know." " Then, indeed, there be no mischief in them groans," said the boy, who ap¬ peared indifferent whether the house were
examined or not. " Iťs only that gen¬ tleman as howls so, who makes them queer noises. I thought ye'd heard some¬ thing stranger than that. There be more- singular noises than he makes, many's the time." " Sirrah, inform me who inha¬ bits this d ------ d Priory ?" said Count Gondimar. " What, you're recovered from your qualms and stericks, I per¬ ceive, though the old dame is so ill with them ?" " No jesting, Sir Everard. I must sift this aflair to the bottom. Come, Sir, answer straitlv, who inhabits this Priory ?" " Sure, Sir, indeed none as can get a bed in the Abbey." " You evade, young one : you evade my enquiry: to the point : be plain." " That he can't help being," said Lord Trelawney. " Pro¬ ceed, Sir, lead us as fast as possible out of these cold damp galleries ; but talk as you go." " Like the cuckoo." " Lord Tre¬ lawney, your jests are mighty pleasant ; but I have peculiar reasons for my enqui¬ ries." " And I for my jokes." " Come,
Sirrah, proceed : I shall say no more at present." 44 Do you like being here?" said Lady Trelawney, taking up the ques¬ tion. 4t Well enough," returned the stu¬ pid boy. 44 I hear," continued Frances, 44 there are some who play upon the harp in the night, and sing so, that the country people round, say they are spell-bound." 44 Oh musha ! there be strange thing's heard in these here old houses : one must not always believe all one hears." Count Gondimar and Lady Margaret, were engaged in deep discourse. t4 I can hardly believe it," she said. 4i It is most true—most terribly true," said Gondi¬ mar. u I will question the boy myself," she cried ; 44 he is subtle with all that ap¬ pearance of clownish simplicity ; but wc shall gather something from him. Now, Lady Trelawney, give me leave to speak, and do you lead these gentlemen and la¬ dies into the fresh air. Lady Augusta says she longs to behold living objects and day-light. I shall soon overtake
you. Come here : I think, frøm what I have gathered, that St. Alvin Priory has not been inhabited by any of the Glenar¬ von family since the year **** : in that case, who has had charge of it ?" 4t None but Mr. Mackenzie and Dame since the old Lord de Ruthven's and his sou the young Colonel's time. There's been no qua¬ lity in these parts till now ; but about three years and better, the young Lord sent some of his friends here, he being in Italy ; and as they only asked for the auld ruin, and did not wish to meddle with the castle, they have done their will there. The steward lets them bide." 44 Have they been here above three years ?" 44 Indeed then, that they've not, your honour ; for sometimes they've all been here, and sometimes there's not a soul alive : but since last Michaelmas, there's been no peace for them." " Can you tell me any of their names ?" 44 All, I believe ; for isn't tiiere one calls himself Citizen Costolly, whom we take to be the
master, the resi! Lord ; but he cares not to have it thought : only he's such a manner with him, one cau*t but think it. Then there's Mister O'Kelly, he as calls him¬ self Citizen Wailman—the wallet ; and there's another as sings, but has no name, a famale ; and there's a gentleman cries and sobs, and takes care of a baby; and his name, I think, is Macpherson ; then there's the old one as howls ; and Mrs. Nelly O'Grady ; and St. Clara, the Prophetess ; besides many more as come to feast and revel here." " And what right have they to be here ?" " Why to be sure, then, they've not any right at all ; that's what we are all talking of ; ex¬ cept them letters from my Lord ; and they all live a strange wicked life under ground, the like of thaves ; and whatever's the reason, for some time past, that young gentleman as was, is disappeared : no¬ thing's known as to what's gone with him—only he's gone ; and the child— och ! the young master's here, and the
only one of 'em, indeed, as looks like a christian." " Is his name Clare of Cos- toly?" " Ah! sure your honour knows him." Having reached the front porch, by the time the boy had gone through his exa¬ mination, Lady Margaret perceiving O'Kelly, sent for him, and tried, vainly, to make him answer her enquiries more satisfactorily ; which not being able to accomplish, she set forth to return home, in an extreme ill humour. Lord Trelaw¬ ney rallied her about the ghost. Casting an angry glance at him, she refused po¬ sitively to return home in either of the carrmges; saying, she was resolved to walk back across the cliff, the short way. Some of the gentlemen proposed escort¬ ing her; but she haughtily refused them, and desired permission to be a few mo¬ ments left to herself. They, therefore, re-entered their carriages, and returned without any further event. Calantha was tired and grave during
the drive home ; and, what may perhaps appear strange, sbe named not her ad¬ venture. " It is himself—it must be/* " Who?" said Lady Mandeville. Con¬ fused at having betrayed her ow r n thoughts,—" Young Linden," she cried, looking out of the carriage ; and then feigned sleep, that she might think over again and «again on that countenance, that voice, that being, she had one moment seen.
CHAPTER V. Lady Margaret walking hastily off, had arrived near the Convent of St. Mary, as the 1-ast ray of the setting sun blazed in the west, and threw its golden light over the horizon. Close to the convent, is built the chapel where the young Marquis and all the family of Al¬ tamonte are interred. It stands upon a high barren cliff, separated by a branch of the sea from the village of Belfont, to which any one may p«ass by means of the ferry below. To the north of the cha¬ pel, as far as the eye can trace, barren heaths and moors, and the distant view of Belfont and St. Alvin Priory, presenta cheerless aspect; while the other side displays the rich vsdley of Delaval, its groves, gardens and lake, with the adja* cent wood.
At this spot Lady Margaret arrived, as has been said, at sun-set. She thought she had been alone ; but she heard a step closely following her: she turned round, and to her extreme surprize, beheld a man pursung her, and, just at that mo¬ ment, on the point of attaining her. His black brows and eyes were contrasted with his grizzly hair ; his laugh ivas hol¬ low ; his dress wild and tawdry. If she stopped for a moment to take breath, he stopped at fhe same time ; if she ad¬ vanced rapidly, he followed. She heard his steps behind, till passing near the convent he paused, rending the air with his groans, and his clenched fist repeat¬ edly stiking his forehead, with all the appearance of maniac fury, whilst with his voice he imitated the howling of the wind. Terrified, fatigued andoppressed, Lady Margaret fled into the thickest part of the wood, and waited till she conceived the cause ofher terror was removed. She soon
perceived, however, that the tall figure be¬ hind her was waiting for her reappearance. She determined to try the swiftness of her foot, and sought with speed to gain the ferry:—she durst not look behind^—the heavy steps of her pursuer gained upon her:—suddenly she felt his hand upon her shoulder, as, ivith a shrill voice and loud laugh, he triumphed at having over¬ taken her. She uttered a piercing* shriek ; for on turning round she beheld — . His name cannot at present be declared ; yet this may be said : it was terrible to her to gaze upon that eye—so hollow, so wild, so fearful was its glance. FVom the se¬ pulchre, the 3ead appeared to have arisen to affright her; and, scarce recovering from the dreadful vision, with a faltering step, and beating heart, she broke from that grasp—that cold hand—that dim- fixed eye—and gained with difliculty the hut of the fisherman, who placed her in safety on the other side of the cliff. The castle bell had already summoned
the family; dinner awaited; and the duke having repeatedly enquired for Lady Margaret, was surprised to hear that she had returned home alone and after dusk. The servant, who informed him of this circumstance, said that her ladyship appeared extremely faint and tired; that her women attendants had heen called; that they apprehended she ivas more ill than she would acknowledge. He was yet speaking, when Avith a blaze of beauty and even more than her usual magnificence of dress, she entered, apo¬ logised for the lateness of her appearance, said the walk was longer than she had apprehended, and, taking her brother's arm, led the way into the dining room. But soon the effort she had made, proved too great:—her colour changed repeat¬ edly ; she complained that the noise dis¬ tracted her; she scarcely took any part in the conversation ; and retiring early, sought a few hour's repose. Mrs. Seymour accompanied her
whilst the rest of those whose curiosity had been much excited in the morning, narrated their adventures .and enquired eagerly concerning Lord Glenarvon's character and mode of life. At the mention of his name, tbe colour ruA- ed into Calantha's face. Was it him¬ self she had seen ?—She was convinced it was. That counten«ance verified all that she had heard against him: it was a full contradiction to all that Lady Trelawney had spoken in his favour; it expressed a capability of evil—a subtlety that led the eye of a stranger to distrust; but, with all, it was not easily forgotten. The ad¬ dress to the people of Ireland, ivhich Lady Avondale had read before with enthu¬ siasm, she read now with a neiv and unde¬ finable sensation. She drew also those fea¬ tures—that countenance ; and remember¬ ed the air he had sung and the tones of his voice.—She seemed to dive into the feel¬ ings of a heart utterly different from what she had ever yet observed ; a sort of Vol. II. D
instinct gave her potver at once to pene¬ trate into its mošt secret recesses ; nor was she mistaken. She listened, with eager cu¬ riosity, to every anecdote narrated of him by the country esquires and gentry who dined at the castle ; but she felt not sur¬ prised at the inconsistences and absurdities which she heard repeated. Others discre¬ dited what was said: she believed the worst ; yet still the interest she felt w as un¬ diminished. It is strange ; she loved not —she admired not that countenance ; yet, by day, by night, it pursued her. She could not restnor employ her m ind in her customary occupations ; yet the fear of again seeing that countenance, was greater than the desire of doing so. She felt as sured that it was Lord Glenarvon :—there was not a doubt left upon her mind re¬ specting this circumstance. Mrs, Sey¬ mour saw that Calantha was pre-occu¬ pied : she thought that she was acquaint¬ ed with the secret which disturbed Lady Margaret—that horrid secret which mad¬ dened and destroyed her : for, since her
adventure at the Priory, Lady Margaret had been ill. But it was not till after some davs re* tirement, that she sent for Calantha, and when she visited her in her own apart¬ ment, she found her silent and trembling. " W here is your boy ?" Lady Margaret said. " He sleeps: would you that I should bring him yon ?" " I do not mean yonr son : I mean that minion—that gaudy thing, you dress up for your amusement—that fawning insect, Zerbellini/' Calantha shuddered ; for she knew that a mother could not thus speak of her child without suffering acutely. " Has ray prettv Zer¬ bellini done any thing to deserve such unkind words from you? If so, I will chide him for it Why do you frown? Zerbellini haste here: make your obei¬ sance to Lady Margaret." The boy ap. proached: Lady Margaret fixed her eyes steadily upon him: the colour rushed into her cheeks, then left her pale, as the hue of death. "Oimè si muojaľ* exclaim-
ed Zerbellini: " Eccelenza si muoja" aud he leant forward to support her ; but Lady Margaret moved not. Manymomeuts passed in entire silence. Atlast, startingas if from deep reflection, "Calantha," shesaid, "1 know yourheart too well to doubt its kindness:—the pre¬ sence of this boy, will cause the misery of your father," " Of my father!" " Do you not guess wherefore? I read his feel¬ ings yesterday : and can you, my child, be less quick in penetrating the senti¬ ments of those you love ? do you not perceive that Zerbellini is of the very age and size—your lost—and—lamented brother would have been ?... .and cer¬ tainly not unlike the duchess." She he¬ sitated—paused—recovered herself. " I would not for the world have you sug¬ gest this to a human being. I would not appear to have said—what you, out of an affectionate regard might—shouki— have considered."—" I am astonished : you quite amaze me," replied Calantha : vet she too well guessed her feelings.
You heard your father, yesterday, say how necessary it was for him to attend the general meeting at Belfast: he flies us to avoid this boy—the likeness—in short, oblige me, place him at the garden cottage, or at the Rector of Belfont's—he will attend to him. I am told you mean to leave your children with Mr. Challoner : if so, he might likewise keep this boy. His strong resemblance—his age—his manner—have given me already the acntest pain.—My brother will never de¬ mand any sacrifice of you ;—but I, Lady Avondale,—I solicit it.—" Shall I be re- fused?" "Dearest aunt, can you ask this? Zerbellini shall be immediately sent from the castle." " Oh no : such pre¬ cipitate removal ivould excite curiosity." " Well then,alloiv me to place him, as you sav, under the care of the Rector of Bel- font and his wife — or—" " But how strange—why—did you never observe this before ?" " Calantha," said Lady Margaret in i)3
a hollow tone, " it is the common talk ; every one observes it: every eye fixes it¬ self upon him, and seems to—to—to—re¬ proach—to-morrow— morn—to-morrow morning, I must quit this place—business of importance calls me away—I hope to see you shortly : 1 shall return as soon as possible—perhaps I shall not go.—The trifle ï now suggest, is solely for my brother's sake.— If you mention one word of this to any one, the sacrifice I ask will lose its value. Above all, if the Count Gondimar is made a confidant." " Fear not : I shall request as of myself, that Zerbellini may be placed with my little son: but you cannot thiuk how much you surprise me. My father has seen the boy so often ; has spoken so fre¬ quently with him ; has appeared so per¬ fectly at his ease." "The boy," said Lady Margaret, "is the living picture of—in short 1 have dreamt a dreadful dream. Shall I confess my weakness, Calantha : I dreamt last night,
that I was with a numerous and brilliant assembly, even in this very castle; and of a sudden, robed in the white vestments of an angel, that boy appeared*-! saw his hand closely stealing behind—he had a dagger in it, and coming towards me— I mean towards your father—he stabbed him. These phantasies shew an ill con¬ stitution—but, for a short time, send the child away, and do not expose my weak¬ ness, do not love. I have many sorrows, my nerves are shattered—bear with me; you know r not, and God forbid you should ever know, what it is to labour under the pressure of guilt—guilt? aye^—such as that brow of innocence, that guileless generous heart, never can comprehend, " My aunt, for God's sake, explain your¬ self." Lady Margaret smiled, " Oh not such guilt either, as to excite such looks as these : only 1 have suffered my heart to wajpder, child ; and 1 have been punished." Calantha was less surprised at this con- D 4
versation, from remembering the secret Gondimar had communicated, than she otherwise must have been ; hut she could not understand what had given rise to this paroxysm of despair at this particular moment. A singular circumstance now occurred, which occasioned infinite con¬ jecture to all around. Every morning, as soon as it was light, and every evening at dusk, a tall old man in a tattered garb, with a wild and terrible air, seated him¬ self in front of the Castle windows, making the most lamentable groans, and crying out in an almost unintelligible voice, " Woe, on woe, to the family of Altamonte." The Duke w-as no sooner apprised of this circumstance, than he ordered the supposed maniac to be taken up: but Lady Margaret implored, en¬ treated, and even menaced, till she ob¬ tained permission from her brother to give this wretched object his liberty. Such an unusual excess of charity- such sudden, and violent commiseration
for a being who appeared to have no other view than the persecution and an¬ noyance of her whole familv, was deemed strange ; but when they no longer were molested by the presence of the fanatic, who had denounced their ruin, they ceased to converse about him, and soon the whole affair was forgotten. Calantha indeed remembered it ; but a thousand new thoughts diverted her attention, and a stronger interest led her from it.

CHAPTER VL The Rector of Belfont had willingly per¬ mitted the little Zerbellini to be placed under his wife's care. The distance from thence to the Castle was short ; and Ca¬ lantha had already sent her children thither for the benefit of sea-bathing. On returning: one dav from thence, she called upon Gerald Mac Allain, who had ab¬ sented himself from the castle, ever since Mr. Buchanan had appeared there. She found him mournfully employed in look¬ ing over some papers and drawing's, which he had removed to his own habi¬ tation. Lpon seeing Lady Avondale he arose, and pointed to the drawings, which she recognized: 44 Poor Alice," he said, 44 these little remembrances tell me of happier days, and make me sad ; but when I see you, my Lady, I forget my
sorrows." Linden's cottage was at a short distance from Gerald Mac Allaii/s. Calantha now informed liim that she had met young Linden at the fair, and had wished to speak to him: but that she did not immediately remember him, he was so altered. Gerald said " it was no use for her to speak to him, or for any one else, he was so ς desperate-tike f and/* added he, " Alice's misconduct has broke all our hearts : we never meet now as formerly ; we scarce dare look at each other as we pass." " Tell me, Gerald," said Calantha, " since you have spoken to me on this melancholy subject, what is the general opinion about Alice? Has Linden no idea of what has become of her ?—had he no suspicion, no doubt of her, till the moment when she fled?" 4i Oh yes, my Lady," said the old man, " my poor girl estranged herself from him latterly ; and when Linden was obliged to leave her to go to county Leitrim for Mr.
O'Flarney, during his absence, which lasted six weeks, he received a letter from her, expressing her sorrow that she never could belong to him. Upon his return he found her utterly changed ; and in a few weeks after, she declined hisfurther visits; only once «again consenting to see him. It was on the very morning before my Lady Margaret conveyed her away from the Castle." " But did you never suspect that things were going on ill before?—did Linden make no attempt to see her at the Doc¬ tor's? It seems strange that no measures should have been taken before it was too late." " Alas î my dear young Lady, you do not know how difficult it is to sus¬ pect and chide what we love dearly. I had given up my child into other hands ; she was removed entirely from my hum¬ ble sphere; and whilst I saw her happy, I could not but think her deserving; and when she became otherwise, she w«as mi¬ serable, and it was not the moment to
shew her any severity. Indeed, indeed, it was impossible for me to mistrust or chide one so above me as Alice. As to young Linden, it turned his mind. I walked to his father's house, ill as I was, just to shake hands with him and see him, as soon as I was told of what had passed. The old gentleman, Cyril's father could not speak. The mother wept «as soon as she beheld me ; but there was not one bitter word fell from either, though they knew it would prove the ruin of the young man, their son, and perhaps his death." 44 From that time till the present," con¬ tinued Gerald, 44 1 seldom see Linden ; he always avoids me. He altered very much, and took to hard drinking and bad company ; his mind w;»s a little shaken ; he grew very slack a 1 his duty ; and listed, we suppose, with that same gang, which seduced my two poor boys from their allegiance and duty. He was repri¬ manded and punished by his commander;
but it seems ıvithout effect, for Mr, Chal- loner was telling me, only a few days since, that iu the last business there with Squire Flarney g Linden was taken notice of by the justice. There's no one can save him, he seems so determined-like on his own ruin ; and they say its the cause why the old father is on his death-bed at this present. There is no bitterness of heart like that which comes from thank¬ less children. Ihey never find out till it is too late, how parents loved them :— but it was not her fault—no—I don't blame her—(he knit his brow)—no—I don't blame her.—Mr. Buchanan is no child of our own house, though he hi is the place of that gracious infant ivhich it pleased the Lord to take to himself. Mr. Buchanan is the son of a strange father : —1 cannot consider him as one of our own so arbritrary:—but that's not the thing." " Gerald," said Calantha, you are not sure that Buchanan is the culprit : we
should be cautious in our judgments." 44 Oh, but 1 am sure, and I care not to look on him ; and Linden, they say menaces to revenge on the young lord, my wrongs and his own ; but his old father begs him for God's sake to be peaceable. Perhaps, my Lady, you will look on the poor gen¬ tleman : what though * tis a tlying man— you'll be gratified to see him, there is such a cahn upon his countenance." 44 Must he die ?" u \\ hy, he's very pre¬ carious-like : — but your noble husband, the young Lord Avondale, is very good to him—he has done all a man and a sol¬ dier could do to save him," 44 I too will call," said Calantha, to hide from Gerald how much she was aftected ; 44 and, as to you, I must entreat as a favour, that you will return to the castle : to-morrow is Harry's birth-day ; and it will not be a holiday, my iather sais, if you are not as vou were wont to be, at the head of the table wiih all the tenants." 44 I will come," said Gerald, if it were only on
account Of my Lord's remembering me : «and all the blessings of the land go with him, and you, and his noble house, till the end of time, and with the young Lord of Glenarvon beside, who saved Roy and Conal from a shameful death—that he did." 44 But you forget," said Calantha, smil¬ ing, t4 that by your ow n account, he was the first to bring ihem into danger." 44 By my heart, but he's a noble spirit for all that : and he has my good wishes aud those of many beside." As he spoke, his eye kindled with enthusiasm. Calantha's heart beat high : she listened with eager interest. 44 He's as generous as our own," continued he, 44 and if he lets his followers take a pig or two from that rogue there, Squire Flarney, does not he give half he has to those in distress ? lf 1 could ever meet him face to face, I'd tell him the same; but we never know when he's among us ; and aint there St. Clara the prophetess, why he went to see her
once, they say, and she left her aunt the Abbess, and the convent, and all the nuns, and went off after him, as mad as the rest. Och ! you'd bless \ ourself to see how the folks crowd about him at the season, but they're all gone from these parts now, in hopes of saving Linden I'm told ; for you know, I suppose that he's missing, and if he's deserted, its said they are sartain to shoot him on account of the troubles." 44 Three timesthere have been meetingsin that cleft there," continued Gerald, point¬ ing towards the Wizard's Glen : 4i it was that was the first undoing of Miss St. Clare : for they tell me she's all for our being delivered from our tyrants ; and she prophecies so, it would do you good to hear her. Oh, they move along, a thousand at a time in a silence would surprise you —justin the still night, and you can scarce hear them tread as they pass ; but don't I know well, when they're coming, aye, and indeed is there one of us w ho live here about the town, would betray them
though the reward offered is very stupen¬ dous." " But see, here are some ofthe military coming."... 4 That officer is General Ken¬ nedy," said Lady Avondale, approaching towards him : " he is not a tyrant at least:" as she said this, she bowed to him, for she knew him well. He often dined at the castle. He was saying a few words to her upon common uni nterestkigtopics, when, a soldier beckoning to him, two horsemen appeared.—" He's found, Sir," said one: α there is no doubt ofhis guilt ; and twentv other names are on the list." " 1 trust in God it is not Linden, of whom you are speaking," said Calantha. Ge¬ neral Kennedy made no answ er : he only bowed to her, as if to excuse himself ; and retired. Calantha observed a vast number of people assembled on the road, close to the \illage. Gerald Mac Allain could scarcely support himself. She enquired
what they were waiting for. " To see the deserters," they answered. It was women, children, parents who spoke : some wept aloud ; others stood in silent anguish ; many repeated the name of him in whom they took deepest interest, ask¬ ing if he were of the number. Linden's she heard most frequently. " III luck to the monsters!—ill luck to the men of blood !" was vociferated the ivhole way she went. "This ivill kill the old man," said Gerald : " it will be his death : he has been all night fearing it, ever since Linden has been missing." The crowd, seeing Calantha, ap¬ proached in all directions. " Oh beg our king, your father, to save them," said one : " Jesus reward you :" and they knelt and prayed to her. She was too much affected to answer. Some of the officers approached her, aud advised her to retire, " The crowd vvill be im¬ mense," they said: " your Ladyship had
better not remain to witness this heart¬ breaking scene. " Twenty names are on the list," continued the officer, " all deserted, as soon as Linden did. Mercy, in this instance, will be weakness : too much has already been shewn»"
CHAPTER VII.
Calantha returned home with a heavy heart; and spoke to Lord Avondale and her father. They both intreated her not to interfere. The moment indeed was alarming and eventful; whatever mea¬ sures were necessary, it was not for her to judge; and while enthusiasm in the cause of liberty beguiled some, it was, she felt it ivas, the duty of a woman to try to soften and conciliate every thing ; but as Linden's fate was peculiarly unfortunate, Lord Avondale generously interested himself for him. Had money been able to pur¬ chase his release, there was no sum he would not have offered. They soon heard however, though with the deepest regret, that it was a case where mercy could not be sbewn, without apprehend¬ ing the most fatal effects from it. Lin-
den and Seaford had together entered the militia not above three years back. Linden, an only son, was полу in his twentieth year, and Seaford, was scarce eighteen. Their example was deemed the more necessavy for the general safety, as so many in the same regiment had de¬ serted upon hearing of their disaffection. In the month of December last, they had all taken the treasonable oaths; and their rash conduct and riotous proceedings had already more than once rendered them liable to the severity of the 1алу. All intercessions were utterly fruitless ; they луеге tried, found guilty antl con¬ demned. Linden ллаа so much beloved by his companions, that several attempts were made, to rescue him from the hands of justice; but he disdained to be so released ; and when he heard of the tumult his condemnation had excited, he asked his captain's permission to be spared the last bitter conflict of walking through his own native town. The re* quest was denied him.
On the 18th of May, at the hour of four, the time appointed to assemble, twenty-three men, who had taken part in the riot, were called out. The regi¬ ment, after this, slowly advanced in so¬ lemn procession through the town, fol¬ lowed by the cavalry, and all the horse artillery. The streets were thronged— the windows were crowded—not a word was spoken ; but the sobs and cries of friends, parents and old «acquaintance, who came out to take a last farewell, were heard. After passing through Belfont, they turned to the high road, and conti¬ nued the march util they reached the plains at the foot of Inis Tara, about two miles from the town. Linden and Seaford were then brought forward with a strong escort. They con·» tinued silent and firm to the last. Just as the pause was made, before the com¬ mand was given that they should kneel, the mother of Linden, supported by Mac Allain, forced her way through the
crowd, and implored permission to take a last farewell of her son. The officer desired that she might pass ; but the crowd was so great that it was with diffi¬ culty she could arrive at the spot:—when there, she only once shook hands with the young man, and said she had brought him his father's blessing :—he made no answer, but appeared very deeply af¬ fected. He had shewn the most de¬ liberate courage till that hour. It now forsook him, and he trembled ex¬ cessively. 44 Thank God I am spared this," said his companion : 44 I have no mother left." The signal was immediately given to fire; and the party prepared to do their duty. A troop of horse at that moment, in the green uniform of the national guards, appeared from an ambush, and a despe¬ rate struggle ensued. The mutineers set up a terrible yell during the combat. The inhabitants, both of the town and country, joined them in every direction.
Lord Avondale and many other officers present came up to the assistance of Ge¬ neral Kennedy's small force, and soon restored order. The party of horse were put to flight. The colonel of the regi¬ ment immediately ordered a court-mar¬ tial ; and three prisoners, who ivere taken, were with Seaford and Linden, executed on the spot. In the skirmish, the young man who headed the party of horse, and had exposed himself most eagerly to rescue Linden, was wounded in the left arm: his person was described; the circumstance ivas mentioned ; and a high reward w «as of¬ fered for his head. It was supposed by many that he was Lord Glenarvon, The severity of these proceedings struck an immediate panic throughout the disaffected. The inhabitants of the town of Belfont arrayed themselves in black. A long and mournful silence succeeded ; and few there were who per¬ ceived through the veil of submissive ac- Vol. IL E
quiescence, the spirit of rebellion and vengeance, ivhich was preparing to burst forth, Gerald Mac Allain, forgetful of his wrongs, appeared at the castle ; Lady St Clare wrote the most penitent letters to Sir Everard ; and with her two daughters Jessica and Laura, entreated permission to return. Every one of the tradesmen and farmers, of any respectability, erased their names from the new club which had been established opposite to Sir Everard's house ; and a sort of mournful tranquillity and terror seemed to reign throughout, A few days after this melancholy trans¬ action, Linden's mother died ; and as Calantha was returning from Belfont, she met the crowd who had followed her to tiie grave. They all passed her in si¬ lence, nor gave her one salutation, or smile of acknowledgment, as on other occasions ; yet they were her father's own tenants, and most of their counte¬ nances she remembered from childhood.
When she mentioned this circumstance at the castle, she was informed that Lord Avondale's having taken an active part against the party, who had come forward to save the deserters, was the cause of this, their unusual deportment. To such height at this time, was the spirit of party carried that the ivhole kingdom, was in a state of ferment and disorder. Complaints were made, re¬ dress ivas claimed, and the people were everywhere mutinous and discontented. Numerous absentees, it was popularly said had drawn great part of the money out of the country; oppressive taxes were continued ; land was let and sub-let to agents and steivards to the utter ruin of the tenants. Some concessions were now granted in haste—some assurance of relief given ; but the popular spirit of indignation, once excited, was not to be allayed bv the same means which had, perhaps, prevented its first rise. The time for
conciliation was past. A foreign enemy lost no opportunity of adding to the in¬ creasing inward discontent. The friends of government had the power of the sword and the weight of influence on their side ; but the enemies were more numerous, more desperate, more enthu¬ siastic. The institution of political clubs, the combination of the United Irishmen, for the purpose of forwarding a brother¬ hood of affection, a communion of rights, amongst those of every diflerent persua¬ sion, even the establishment of a military force was now attempted ; and the con¬ stant cry of all the inhabitants of either town or country was a total repeal of the penal statutes, the elective franchise, re¬ form of parliament, and commutation of tythes. Whilst, however, the more moderate with sincerity imagined, that they луеге upholding the cause of liberty and reli¬ gion ; the more violent ΛνΙιο had eman¬ cipated their minds from every restraint
of prejudice or principle, did not conceal that the equalization of property, and the destruction of rank and titles ivas their real object. The revolutionary spirit was fast spreading, and since the appear¬ ance of Lord Glenarvon, at Belfont, the whole of the county around might be considered in a etate of actual rebellion.
i,3
CHAPTEU VIIL Ulïünarvon seemed, however, to differ in practice from his principles ; for whilst many of those who had adopted the same language had voluntarily thrown off their titles, and divided their property amongst their partizans, he made a formal claim to the titles ivhich his .grandfather had forfeited ; and though he had received no positive assurance, even that his right would be recognized, he called himself by that name alone, and insisted оц his followers addressing him in no other man¬ ner. This singular personage of whom so many, for a long period, had heard the strangest reports, whom some imagined to be dead, and who seemed, whenever he appeared, to make no light impression upon all those with whom he conversed, had passed his youth in a foreign country,
and had only tw ice visited the abode of his ancestors until the present year. It ivas amidst the ruins of antient ar¬ chitecture, and the ivild beauties of Ita¬ lian scenery, thaf his splendid genius and uncommon faculties were first developed. Melancholy, unsocial, without a guide he had centered in himself every strong interest, and every aspiring hope. Dwell¬ ing ever in the brilliant regions of fancy, his soul turned with antipathy from the ordinary cares of bfe. He deeply felt the 1 stigma which had been cast upon his family in the person of his grandfather, who, from the favourite of the lawful prince, had become the secret accomplice of a bloody conspiracy. The proofs of his guilt were clear; his death was a death of shame ; and the name of traitor was handed down ivith the coronet to which his only surviving heir so eagerly aspired. By his nearest friends he was noiv E 4
called Glenarvon ; and so jealous did he appear ofhis rank, that he pn -rred dis¬ guise, straits and difficulties, to a return to his own country without those titles, and that fortune, which he considered as his due. One object of interest suc¬ ceeded another ; a life of suspense was preferred to apathy ; and the dark coun¬ sels of unprincipled associates, soon led one, already disloyal in heart, to the very brink of destruction. He had embraced his father's profes¬ sion, wherein he had distinguished him-» self by his courage and talent; but to obey another was irksome; and the length of time which must elapse before he could obtain the command of a ship, soon disgusted hirn with the service. He quitted it, and returned to Italy- there amidst the luxurious dissipation of Rome or Florence, he gave up his da) s and nights to ever) fierce excess ; and soon the high spirit of genius was darkened,
the lofty feelings of honor were debased, and the frame and character sunk equally dejected under the fatigue of vigils and revels, in which reason and virtue had no share. He had been wronged and he knew not how to pardon. Many had de¬ ceived him and he existed henceforward but to mislead others. The victim of his first attachment had fallen a prey to the revengeful jealousy of an incensed hus¬ band ; but her death was not more sudden, more secret, than that of the tyrant who had destroyed her. Every one knew by whose hand the fair and lovely Fiorabella had perished ; but no eye bore witness against the assassin, who, in the depths of night had immediately revenged her loss. The murderer and the murdered were both alike involved in the impene¬ trable veil of mystery. The proud and noble family who had been injured, had neither the power, nor the inclination to seek redress. Lord Gleimrvon was seen no more at Florence · he had been в 5
the cause of this tragic scene. It afflicted his generous heart when he reflected upon the misery he had occasioned ; but not even his bitterest enemy could have suspected him of deeper guilt. His youth was untainted by the suspicion of crime, and the deatli of Giardini had, with greater show of justice been attri¬ buted to another, and a more dangerous hand. Fascinated with the romantic splendour of ideal liberty, and intent upon flying from the tortures of recollection, he had visited Ireland in the spring of the year .. >., and had remained there some months, unknown even to his adherents* who flocked around him, attracted by his eloquence, and won by his address. One only victim returned with him in his voluntary exile from his native land. One only miserable enthusiast devoted herself to his fortunes, and accompanied him in his flight. O'Kelly, the son of a tenant of his father, recognized his
youthful lord, and early ingratiated him¬ self into his favour* With this sole attendant, and the un¬ happy girl who had renounced her coim¬ try and her virtue for his sake, he de¬ parted ; nor was seen again at St. Alvin Priory till the present year. Indeed the report of his death was so often affirmed, that when he again pre¬ sented himself, so changed in manner and in form, before his adherents, they questioned one with another whether he was in reality their lord. tc 1 am not what I seem," he would frequently say ; " I am not him whom you take me for." Strange things were rumoured of him. There was a man in his service who had returned with him, who spoke to none, who ansivered no enquiries, who had never before been seen with him in his former visits. It was said that he knew many things if he durst but utter them. All feared and avoided this man. His name was Macpherson,
the same whom Gondimar had seen in town; but all felt irresistibly attracted by his youthful master. Glenarvon's pro¬ jects—his intentions were now but too ge¬ nerally suspected ;—it ivas a critical mo¬ ment ; and his motives for visiting Ireland in such a conjuncture could rçot be mis¬ interpreted nor mistaken.
CHAPTER IX, In this his second visit to his native country, Glenarvon desired his servant, O'Kelly, to find a person of respectability who would take charge of a child, then only in his second year. Clare of Cos¬ tolly was his name; but whether the boy w.as the son of Lord Glenarvon, or some little favorite who, for the moment, had excited his interest, none knew, nor durst enquire. Indeed, the impenetrable mystery which surrounded Lord Glenarvon w«as involved in a deeper shade of concealment at this time, then at any former period ; for scarce had he set foot in his new habita¬ tion when a singular and terrific inmate appeared also at the Priory—a maniac ! who was however welcomed in with the rest of the strange assemblage, and aroom
immediately allotted for his reception. Invaiti the affrighted nurse remonstrated ; the maniac's eyes were fixed upon the child, with frautic wildness ; and Gle¬ narvon, deaf to her entreaties, permitted Clare to attend upon the unwelcome strangerand saw him in his arms without alarm. Even in his most dreadful paroxysms, when all others were afraid of approach¬ ing him, Glenarvon would calmly enter into his chamber, would hear his threats unawed,—would .gaze on him, as if it gave him delight to watch the violence of misguided passion ; to hear the hollow laugh of ideotsy, or fix the convulsed eye of raving insanity. That which was disgusting or terrific to man's nature, had no power over Gle¬ narvon. He had looked upon the dying and the dead ; had seen the tear of agony without emotion ; had heard the shriek of despair, «and felt the hot blood as it flowed from the heart of a murdered
enemy, nor turned from the sickening sight—Even the storms of nature could not move Glenarvon. In the dark night, when the tempest raged around and the stormy ocean beat against the high im¬ pending cliffs, he would venture forth, would listen to the roaring thunder with¬ out fear, and watch the forked lightening as it flashed along the sky. The rushing winds but seemed to sooth his perturbed spirit ; and the calm of his brow remained unaltered in every chang¬ ing scene. Yet it was the calm of hope¬ less despair, when passion, too violent to shew itself by common means, concen¬ trates itself at once around the heart, and steels it against every sentiment of mercy. Who had dared to enquire of that eye the meaning of its glance ? or who had trusted to the music of that soft voice, when it breathed fortli vows of tenderness and love ? or who, believing in the light
of life which beamed upon that counte¬ nance, had considered the sportive jests of fancy—the brilliant sallies of that keen wit as the overflowing testimony of a heart at rest ? None^—none believed or trusted in Glenarvon.—Yet thousands flocked around and flattered him ; amidst this band óf ruffians, this lawless unprin¬ cipled gang, the recluse of Glenaa—the lovely, but misguided Elinor w-as now too often seen. She was the spirit and soul of the tumultuous party : her wit en¬ livened ; her presence countenanced ; her matchless beauty attracted. Scarce in her sixteenth year, the pride of her fa¬ mily, the wOnder and ornament of the whole country, she forsook her solitude and hopes of heaven—she left the aunt, who had fostered and cherished her from childhood, to become avowedly the mis¬ tress of Glenarvon. On horse, or on foot, she accompanied him. In the at¬ tire of a boy she unblushingly followed
his steps ! his former favorites were ne¬ ver even named, or dluded to—his pre¬ sent mistress occupied all his attention. AVhen St. Clara described the sufter¬ ings of her country, every heart melted to compassion, or burned with indigna¬ tion ; but when her master, w hen Gle¬ narvon played upon her harp, or sung the minstrelsy ofthe bards of other times, he inspired the passions which he felt, and inflamed the imagination of his hearers to deeds of madness—to acts of tlie wildest extravagance. Crowds fol¬ lowed upon his teps ; yet it was me¬ lancholy to see them pass—so fair, so young and yet so utterly hardened and perverted. Who could behold St. Clara and not comp-assionate her fate ? What was to become of her when Glenarvon had ceased to love ; and did he love ?— ISever : in the midst of conquests, his heart was desolate ; in the fond embrace of mutual affection, he despised the vic¬ tim of his art.
Ofall the friends, flatterers and fol¬ lowers, he had gained by his kindness, and lost by his caprice, not one remained to fill, in his bosom, that craving void which he himself had made. Wherever he appeared, new beauty attracted his worship, and yielded to his power : yet he valued not the transient possession, even whilst smiling upon the credulous being who had believed in his momen¬ tary affection. Even whilst soothing her with promises and vows, which he meant not for one hour to perfora, he was seek¬ ing the means of extricating himself from her power—he was planning his escape from the thraldom of her charms ? Was he generous ? Aye, and prodigal by na¬ ture ; but there was a part of his cha¬ racter which ill accorded with the rest : it was a spirit of malignity ivhich, if ir¬ ritated, never rested, till it had satisfied its vengeance. An enemy, he could have pardoned and have loved ; but he knew not how to bear with or forgive a friend,
His actions appeared the immediate re¬ sult of impulse ; but his passions were all subject to his controul, and there was a systematic consistency even in his most irregular conduct. To create illusions, and raise affection in the breasts of others, has been the delight of many : to dispel the interest he had created was Glenar- von's care. Love he had studied as an art : he knew it in all its shades and gra¬ dations ; for he had traced its progress in his own and many another breasts. Of kno wledgeand wisdom, hehad drank deep at the fountain head, nor wanted aught that could give liveliness and variety to his discourse. He was, besides, a skilful flatterer, and knew in what weak part, he best might apply his power. But the sweetness of his praise, could only be exceeded by the bitterness of his contempt—the venomed lash ofhis deadly wit. That in which Glenarvon most prided himself—that in which hé most excelled,
was tlie art of dissembling. He could turn and t wine so near the truth, with, more than Machiavelian subtlety, that none could readily detect his falsehood ; and when he appeared most frank and unguarded, then he most deceived. Falsehood and craft were stamped upon his countenance, written upon his brow, marked in his words, and scarce conceal¬ ed beneath the winning smile which oft times played upon his lips. 44 If I could but see him once," said Lady Augusta, " I should be satisfied ; but to hear his name from morning till night—to have every fault, folly, nay even crime attributed to him by one party, and every virtue, charm and fasci¬ nation given him by the other,—it is enough to distract women in general, and me in particular. Is there no mercy for curiosity ? I feel I shall do something ab¬ surd, extremely absurd, if an interview it not contrived." " Nothing can be more easy," said the Duke : " you shall
dine with him, at the next public day. 1 have already sent him a card of invi¬ tation." 44 Under what title ?" 44 To Captain de Ruthven." 44 He will as¬ suredly not come," said Lady Trelaw¬ ney. u That I thiuk probable," said the Duke, laughing. 44 The malicious af¬ firm that his arm is in a sling ; and if so, his appearance just at present would be unwise." The conversation soon took another turn; and Lord Avondale en¬ tering, informed Calantha that he had a letter from Sir Richard, and must imme- diatly join him at Cork.
CHAPTER Χ. AoMiRAL Buchanan and Sir Richard Mowbrey had, in the month of January, returned to England, where they had re¬ ceived the thanks of Parliament for their distinguished conduct on the me¬ morable 1st of June. They ivere now appointed to command upon the Cork station, with a considerable force, as se¬ rious apprehensions were entertained lest the enemy should attempt a descent in the south of Ireland. The enthusiasm with whicli the heroes were greeted on their return, did honour to the feelings of the Irish nation. They were invited to every house in the neighbourhood ; and fêtes and balls were given to shew them respect. The Duke and Lord Avon» dale went forward to receive them. Commodore Emmet, an old acquaint-
ance of theirs who resided atCork, sent to offer his house, not only to them, but tothe ivhole party at Castle Deiaval ; if they determined to accept Sir George's invita¬ tion, and dine on board the Royal William on the 1st of June, in comme¬ moration of that day and its success. There were few, if any, of those invited who refused ; but none accepted the invi¬ tation with so much enthusiasm as Calan¬ tha. The letter from SirGeorge Buchanan to Lady Margaret ivas as follows :— Cork, May2Stb. 179©. 44 Мз г dear Lady Margaret, 44 In answer to a letter which 1 received this morning, dated May 26th, ult., I re¬ quest the honour of your Ladyship's com¬ pany on board the Royal W 7 illiam, now in harbour at the Cove. The Duke and the rest of his family and party have al¬ ready promised me this favour, and I am not prepared to accept from yourself any denial on account of those circumstances
to ivhich you allude, and which, I entreat you sincerely to beiieve are, on my part, utterly forgotten. Let me request you, then, to banish from your memory every trifling disagreement, and to meet me, upon an occasion so flattering as is the present to my feelings and those of our friends, with the good-will and kindness you will ever find in the heart of your Ladyship's most obedient and affec¬ tionate brother and servant, " George Buchanan." tn consequence of this invitation, Lady Margaret and the rest of the Duke's family set out on the morning of the 31st, and arrived about the hour of dinner at Commodore Emmet's—a large brick building about a quarter of a mile beyond the town of Cork. The Duke and Lord Avondale, and their lo¬ quacious host, had been aw T aiting them some time. The latter gave to each
the most cordial welcome; boasted that he could lodge them all ; talked incessantly, as he shewed them to their apartments ; entreated them not to dress, as dinner awaited ; and left them, assuring them all, that they were the exact image of the Duke, whom he concluded to be, like the Patriarchs of old, the father of the whole company. Ilis voice murmured on as he descended the stairs, whilst Cassandra and Heloise, his daughters, appeared to offer their services in his place. The dining-room ivas small ; the guests were numerous; the table ivas crowded with huge pieces of meat : the Commodore talked incessantly; hischil¬ dren, his servants, his brother, seemedall gifted alike with the same spirit of acti¬ vity : it was incessant bustle, hurry, noise and contrivance. Music, cards, and tricks of every kind were displayed during the evening; and in the morning, Jong before the sun had arisen, carpen- Vol.IL F
ter% mechanics, ship-huildersand cooks, awoke the guests by the noise of their respective pursuits. Sir George Buchanan had sent to re¬ quest the Duke's company at an early hour on the morrow. The day proved fair,, the boats were ready, and they set forth on their expedition in high spirits. Many shi ps and smal 1 er vessels were spread over the harbour ; and bands of music played as they passed. The beauty of the Cove of Cork, the trees bending to the water side, the fortress, and the animated picture which a mercantile city presents, —delighted all. But feelings of enthu¬ siasm kindled in every heart, when they approached the Royal William, and be¬ held its venerable commander. The sea was rough, and the spray of the waves was at times blown over the boat. The Miss Emmets thought of their new dresses; Sophia of danger; and Calantha of ihe glory of thus proudly riding over the billowy ocean.
Lady Margaret, though silent, was more deeply agitated:—her mind re¬ curred in thought to scenes long past. She was now to behold, after a lapse of many years, her husband's brother, whom she had treated with the most marked in¬ dignity, and for whom she had vainly at¬ tempted to feel contempt. He had ever conducted himself towards her with cour¬ teous, though distant civility; but had yet shewn the most decided disapproba¬ tion of her conduct. When she had last beheld him, shew r as in the full splendour of youth and beauty, surrounded by an admiring world, and triumphant in the possession of every earthly enjoyment. Time had but little changed the majesty of her form ; but something worse than tirne had stamped upon her countenance an expression never to be effaced ; while her marked brow assumed an air of sul¬ len pride and haughty reserve, as she as- ceuded from the boat into the ship; she gazed upon the long forgotten features of f 2
her brother ; and she seemed to be deeply affected. Age had bleached his once dark locks; but he was still unimpaired in mind and form. He bent lowly down to receive her: she felt him clasp her to his bosom ; and overcome by this unex¬ pected kindness, her tears streamed upon his hand :^-he, too, could have wept ; but recovering himself, with a commanding air, he came forward to receive his other guests. The ship was in the highest order ; the feast prepared was magnificent ; and when the Duke stood up and bowed with grace to drink the Admiral's health, the sailors cheered, and the toast ivas repeated from the heart by every individual. But he, though greatly affected and pleased at the homage shewn him, bowed to the Duke, returning him the compliment; and afterwards, drinking the health of Sir Richard Mowbrey, said, that he owed every thing to his assistance—that, in the glorious action of the 1st, his ship
had conferred new honours on the Bri¬ tish Navy, and that he had received the warmest commendations of their great Commander ancl famed Admiral Howe !.. At that name, every individual arose. The name of Howe was repeated from niouth to mouth with an expression of exalted admiration ; his applauses were spoken of by every tongue ; and many .an eye that had never sheivn weakness, till that moment, filled with tears at the name of their venerable, their dear com¬ mander. Captain Emmet, during this scene, was employed in eating voraciously of whatever he could lay hands on. Miss Emmet, who thought it a great honor to converse ivith a lord, had seated herself by the side of Lord Avondale, narrating her own adventures, freely stating her own opinions, and pleased with herself and every one present; while her father likewise talked at the other end of the table, and Admiral Buchanan laughed f3
heartily, but good humouredly at his friend's oppressive eloquence. Suddenly Lord Avondale turned to Calantha and asked her if she were ill ? She knew not, she could not define the sort of pain and joy she felt at that moment. Her eyes had long been fixed upon one who took no part in this convivial scene —whose pale chee> and brow expressed much of disappointed hope, or of joyless indifference. He had that youthful, nay boyish air, which renders this melan¬ choly the more singular.—It was not affected, though his manner had in it nothing of nature, but the affectation was rather that of assumed respect for those he cared not for, and assumed in¬ terest in topics to ivhich he hardly at¬ tended, than the reverse. He even af¬ fected gaiety; butthe hearťs laugh never sounded from his lips; and if he uttered a sentence, his eye seemed to despise the being who listened with avidity to his observation. It was the same,—oh ! ver¡.
it was, indeed, the same, whom Calantha had one moment bebeld at St. Alvin Priory. His face, his features, were the same, it is true, but a deeper shade of sadness now overspread them ; and sorrow and disappointment had changed the glow of boyish health to a more pallid hue. What ! in a month ? it will be said.—A day might, perhaps, have done it. How¬ ever, in the present instance, it was not as if some sudden and defined misfor¬ tune had opprest the soul by a single blow: it was rather as if every early hope had long been blighted ; and every aspiring energy had been destroyed. There was nothing pleasing to gaze upon : it was mournful ; biit it excited nor sympathy, nor confidence. The arm was in a sling—the left arm. There could be no doubt that he was the hero who had risked his life to save young Juden. Was it, indeed, Lord Glenar- F 4
von whom Calantha beheld? Yes. it was himself. Sir George Buchanan had long since known, observed, and distin¬ guished him in his profession, and the firm friendship of the seaman, would not be deterred by any rumours, hoivever current or however unfavourable, from paying- him that respect, ivhich he knew to be due not more to his rank, than to his merit and prowess. Glenarvon had availed himself of the invitation, and faceto face Calantha now stood before him, and gazed witheager curiosity upon him. Never did the hand of the sculptor, in the full poiver of his art, produce a form and face more finely wrought, so full of soul, so ever-varying in expression. Was it possible to behold him unmoved ? Oh ! was it in woman's nature to hear him, and not to cherish every word he uttered ? And, having heard him, was it in the human heart ever again to forget those accents, which awakened every : iterest, and quieted every apprehension? The
day, the hour, that very moment of time ivas marked and destined. It was Gle¬ narvon—it was that spirit of evil whom she beheld ; and her soul trembled within her, and felt its danger. Calantha was struck suddenly, forcibly struck; yet the impression made upon her, was not in his favour. The eye ofthe rattle-snake, it has been s id, once fixed upon its victim, overpowers it with terror and alarm : the bird, thus charmed, dares not attempt its escape ; it sings its last siveet lay; flutters its little pinions in the air ; then falls prone be¬ fore its destroyer, unable to fly from his fascination. Calantha bowed, there¬ fore with the rest, pierced to the heart at once by the maddening power that de¬ stroys alike the high and iow; but she liked not the wily turn of his ез 7 е, the contemptuous sneer of his curling lip, the soft passionless tones of his voice :— it was not nature, or if it were nature, not F 5
that to which she had been accustomed ; —not the open, artless expression of a guileless heart. Starting from the kind of dream, in which she had for one moment been ! wrapped, she now looked around her, and with a sudden affectation, to which she had hitherto been a stranger, assumed a new manner, in order to conceal the in¬ terest which she felt, and which she feared she was betra} ing. Lord Glenarvon ivas the real object of her thoughts, } et she appeared alone to be occupied with every other. She laughed with Lord Trelawney ; talked to the Miss Emmets ; examined with in¬ terest every part of the ship, carelessly approaching the very edge of it ; yet once she met that glance, which none ever, who had seen, could forget, and she stopped as if rivetted to the earth.—He smiled ; but whetlier it was a smile of approbation, or of scorn, she could not discover: the upper lip was curled, as
if in derision; but the hand that was stretched out to save her, as she sstood on the brink of the vessel, and tbe soft silvery voice ivhich gently admonished her to beware, lest one false step should plunge her headlong into the gulph be¬ low, soon re-assured her. It was late before the Duke took leave of the admiral, who promised to breakfast with the Commodore the ensuing day. The guns once more were fired ; the band played as for their arrival ; but the music noiv seemed to breathe a sadder strain ; for it was heard softened by distance, and every stroke of the oars rendered the sounds raore and more imperfect. The sun was setting, and cast its lustre on the still waves: even the loquacity of the Emmets was for a few moments sus¬ pended; it was a moment wliich im¬ pressed the heart with awe; it was a scene never to be forgotten. The splen¬ dour of conquest, the tumult of enthu¬ siasm, the aged veteran, and more than
all, perhaps, that being who seemed early wrecked in the full tide of misfortune, were all fixed indelibly in Calantha's me¬ mory. Future times might bring new interests and events ; magnificence might display every w r onderful variety ; but the impression of that hour never can be effaced.
CHAPTER XL Calantha could not speak one word during the evening ; but while Miss Emmets sung—indifferently, she listened and even wept at what never before had excited or interest, or melancholy. At night, when in sleep, one image pursued her,—it was all lovely—all bright: it seemed to be clothed in the white gar¬ ments of an angel ; it was too resplendent for eyes to gaze on :—she awoke. Lord Avondale slept in the inner room ; she arose and looked upon him, whilst he reposed. How long, how fondly she had loved those features—that form. What grace, what majesty, what beauty was there ! But when those eves awake, she said, they will not look for me. That heart is at peace, and thou canst sleep, Henry, and my sorrows are not known
or heeded by thee. Happy Avondale:— Miserable, guilty Calantha ! whew the mind once cherishes a discontented spirit, every event that occurs tends to strengthen it in the delusion it loves to indulge. Calantha only thought herself neglected. To her perverted eyes every thing appeared in a false light. Thus she accused Lord Avondale when in fact she herself was alone to blame. At an early hour the ensuing day, Captain Emmet proposed a drive to Donallan Park, which he said was a fair domain, fully deservuig the attention of the Duke of Altamonte. Cassandra and Eloise clamorously seconded this pro¬ posal. In this energetic family, Mrs. Emmet alone gave the eye and the ear a little repose. Stretched upon a couch in lang tűd, listless inactivity, she gazed upon the bustling scene before her, as if en¬ tirely unconnected with it : nor seemed to know of gieater suffering 'han when roused from her reveries, by the acute
voices of her family, to the bustle aud hurry of common life. To the question of whether she would accompany them to Donallan Park, she answered faintly, tliat she ivould not go. A fat and friendly lieutenant, who fondly hung over her, urged her to relent, and with some difficulty, at length, persuaded her. Every one appeared much pleased with their excursion, or possibly with some incident during their drive, which had made any excursion agreeable. Of Donallan Park, however, Calantha re¬ membered little : this alone, she noted, that as they ïvalked through a shrubbery, Lord Glenarvon suddenly disengaging himself from Miss Emmet, who had seiz¬ ed upon his arm, gathered a rose—the only rose in bloom (it being early in the summer) and turning back, offered it to Calantha. She felt confused—flattered perhaps; but if she were flattered by his giving it to her, she had reason to be
mortified by the remark which accom¬ panied the gift. " I offer it to you," he said, " because the rose at this season is шге, and all that is new or rare has for a moment, 1 believe, some value in your estimation." She understood his mean¬ ing : her eye had been fixed upon him with more than common interest; and all that others said and Miss Emmet af¬ fected, he thought, perhaps, that she could feel. There was no proof she gave of this, more unequivocal, than her si¬ lence. Her spirits were gone ; a strange fear of offending had come upon her; and when Lady Trelawney rallied her for this change, "1 am not well," she said ; "I wish I had never come to Cork." On the ensuing morning, they returned to Castle Delaval. Previous to their departure, Admiral Buchanan had a long interview with Lady Margaret, during which time Lord Glenarvon walked along the beach with Calantha and Sophia.
" Shall you be at Belfont again this year ?" said Miss Seymour. " I shall be at Castle Delavai in a few days," he an¬ swered, smiling rather archly at Calantha, she knew not wherefore. But she turned coldly from him, as if fearing to meet his eyes. Yet not so was it her custom to behave towards those whom she sought to please, and what woman upon earth exists, who had not wished to please Glenarvon ? Possibly she felt of¬ fended at what he had said when giving her the rose in Donallan garden ; or it may be that her mind, hitherto so en¬ thusiastic, so readily attracted, was grown callous and indifferent, and felt not those charms and the splendour of those talents which dazzled and misled every other heart. Yet to fly, to feel embarrassed, to scarcely dare to look upon the person who addresses us ? Are these such very marked signs of indifference ? It is not probable that Lord Glenarvon thought
so. He appeared not to hate the being who ivas thus confused in his presence, but to think that he felt what he in¬ spired were presumption. With all the wild eagerness of entnusiasm, her infa¬ tuated spirit felt what, with all the art of well dissembled vanity, he feigned. She quitted him with a strong feeling of interest. She, however, first heard him accept her father's invitation, and agree to accompany Sir George Buchanan in his promised visit to Castle Dela val.
CHAPTER XII. On their return thither, they found the guests they had left in a lamentable state of dullness. Lord Glenarvon was the first subject of enquiry. Is he arrived? —have you seen him?—do you like him? — were repeated on all sides. « Who?—who?" 44 There can be but one—Lord Glenarvon!" 4C We all like him quite sufficiently, be assured ofthat," said Sophia, glancing her eye somewhat sarcastically upon Calantha. 44 He is a very strange personage," said Lad3 f Margaret. 4C My curiosity to see him had been highly excited : I am now per¬ fectly satisfied. He certainly has a slight resemblance to his mother." 4t He has the same winning smile," said Gondimar ; 44 but there all comparison ceases." 44 What says my Calantha?" said Lady
Mandeville, 4t does her silence denote praise ?" * 4 Oh ! the greatest," she re¬ plied in haste, 44 I hope, my dear girls," said Mrs. Seymour, rather seriously ad¬ dressing her daughters, 44 that you will neither of you form any very marked intimacy with a person of so singular a character as is this young lord, I was rather sorry when, by your letter, I found he was invited here." 4 * Oh, there is no need of caution for us !" replied Lady Trelawny, laughing: 44 perhaps others may need these counsels, but not we : we are safe enough ; are we not, Sophia?" Lord Glenarvon, the object of discus¬ sion, soon appeared at the castle, to si¬ lence both praise and censure. There was a studied courtesy in his manner— a proud humility, mingled with a certain cold reserve, which amazed and repressed the enthusiasm his youth and misfor¬ tunes had excited. The end was as usual : —all were immediately won by this un-
expected demeanour:—some more, some less, and Mrs. Seymour the last. But, to Calantha's infinite amusement, she heard her speaking m his defence a few hours after his arrival ; and the person she ad¬ dressed, upon this occasion, was Sir Eve¬¬ rard St. Clare, who vehementlv asse- verated, though only in a ivhisper, that the Duke must be mad to permit such a person ţo remain at the castle in times like the present. Sir Everard then stateti, that Lady St. Clare and her daughters were re¬ turned to Belfont, and so eager to be again received into society, that if they dared hope that any of the Duke's family would accept their invitation, they in¬ tended to give a concert on the night of the great illumination for the Admiral's arrival at Belfont. Mrs. Seymour smiled in scorn ; but Lady Margaret kindly pro¬ mised to go ; and as soon as Mrs. Seymour heard that it was merely in a political light ¿I«?y were to counte-
nance them, she was satisfied. For the present terror of all those who upheld the government, was lest the rebels should prove superior, and murder them for their opinions It is unnecessary to relate what Lord Glenarvon said to Calantha very shortly after his arrival at the castle ; it was made up of a thousand nothings; 3 r et they were so different from what others had said : they shelved her so marked a preference ; at least they seemed to do so ; but it was not a preference that could alarm the most wary, or offend the most scrupulous. Such as it was, however, it flattered and it pleased ; it gave a neiv interest to life, and obliterated from her memory every long cherished feeling of bitterness or regret. It chanced one day, that, when seated at dinner, by Mrs. Seymour, to whom he paid no little attention, he enquired of her concerning Mac Allain, who waited upon that occasion behind fhe Duke's
chair. " Why looks he so miserable?" he said. " Why turn his eyes so inces¬ santly toivards Mr. Buchanan?" Mrs. Seymour hesitated, as if fearing to allude to a transaction which she never thought of without horror and dislike ; but she no sooner pronounced the name of Mac Allain, than Lord Glenarvon's counte¬ nance altered : he started ! and, watching Buchanan with a look of loathing anti¬ pathy, exhibited such a variety of male¬ volent passions, in the space of a few moments, that Sophia, who sat near Ca¬ lantha on the opposite side of the table, asked her, as she read countenances so well, to tell her what her new friend's expressed at that instant ? She raised her eyes ; but met Glenarvon's. He saw he was the object of attention : he smiled ; and the sweetness of that smile alone being considered : " I know not," she said, in some confusion ; " but this I believe, that the hand of Heaven never impressed on man a countenance so
beautiful,? so glorious i" 4ς Calantha !" said Sophia, looking at her. Calantha sighed. 44 What is it even so ?—-Heaven defend us!" somewhat confused Calantha turn¬ ed to the Count Gondimar; and, talk¬ ing with affected spirits, soon appeared to have forgotten both the smile and the sigh. 44 * You once, when in London, gave me permission to warn you," said the Count, who observed every thing that was passing, 4i when I thought you in «fanger. Now," continued he,— 4i now 'Ш the moment. It was not when dancing with Mr. Ckrendon, or playing' the coquette with Buchanan and the ¿Duke of Myrtlegrove, that I trembled ^rymi.* JLord Avondje was still dear, évøa^ai those days—but now— О ! the iu- öonstaney of the luiman heart. You, eyen you,.are changed}" v " flM I," she re¬ plied ;."„but abs4;4hiit Jime is arrived which fo\$> predic^^ jfiei f canes no^iore for me; but I can never forget ţtim.
See," she continued, 44 how utterly in¬ different he appears, yet I would die for him," 4t That will be of little service: you will prove his ruin and misery. Mark my words, Lady Avondale ; and, when too late, remember what I have dared to say." 44 Every woman complains," she con¬ tinued, smiling, 4t therefore, let me prove an exception. I have no reproaches to make Lord Avondale ; and, except in your suspicious mind, there is no evil to ap¬ prehend." i4 Tell me, candidly ; if the trial were made, if the hour of tempta¬ tion were to come, could you, do you think—could you have strength and courage to resist it ?" 44 Could 1 ! Can you ask ! It will not be accounted pre¬ sumption to affirm, that I feel secure. But possibly this arises from my convic¬ tion, that there can be no temptation for me : I love my husband ; there is no merit then in being true to what we love." Vol. IL G
As she yet spoke, Zerbellini approached and asked her, in Italian, to read a ßote Lord Glenarvon had sent her. It was written with a pencil, and contained but few words : it requested her to speak no more with the Count Gondimar. He saw the manner in which the paper was de¬ livered, and guessed from w hom it came. " I told you so," he cried. tc Alas! shall I affect to offer you advice, when so many nearer and dearer friends are silent—shall I pretend to greater wisdom, —greater penetration ? Is it not inordi¬ nate vanity to hope, that any thing I can suggest will be of use ?" " Speak," said Calantha ; for the subject was inte¬ resting to her ; " at all events I shall not be offended." " The serpent that is che¬ rished in the bosom," said Gondimar, fiercely, " will bite with deadly venom—· the flame that brightly d.azzles the little wanton butterfly, will destroy it. The heart of a libertine is iron : it softens when heated with the fires of passion, but
it is cold and hard in itself. As whirl¬ winds they are strong and irresisti¬ ble ; but when they subside, the calm of insensibility will succeed. Remember the friend of thy youth ; though he appear unkind, his seeming neglect is better worth than the voivs and adulation of all beside. Oh ! Lady Avondale, let one that is lovely, and blest as you are, continue pure even in thought." Calantha looked up, and met Gondi- mar'seyes: the fire in them convinced her that love alone dictated this sage advice ; and none ever can conceive how much that feeling had been encreased by thus seeing a rival before him, whom he could not hope to render odious or ridiculous. On the fol^ving day Lord Glenarvon took his leave. The Duke appeared de¬ sirous of conciliating him ; Lady Marga¬ ret yvas more even than usually brilliant and agreeable; Mrs. Seymour relaxed something of her frigidity ; and the rest G 2
ofthe ladies were enthusiastic in their approbation. From that time Calantha spoke much and often apart wi th Gondimar. Every thought of her heart seemed concentrated on the sudden in one dark interest ; yet it was not love that she felt : it could not be. By day, by night, one image pursued her : yet to save, to reclaim, to lead back from crime to virtue—from misery to peace, was, as she then apprehended, her sole hope and view. Were not all around alike infatuated ? Was not the idol of her fancy a being to whom all alike paid the incense of flatten—the most lowly, • «►' * the most abject ? u Let them pursue," she cried ; 44 let them follow after and be favoured in turn. I alone, self-exiled, will fly, will hide myself beneath every concealment. He shall hear their words and believe in their adulation ; but never, whilst existence is allow ed me, shall he know the interest with which he has inspired
\ - me." Resolved upon this, and dreading her own thoughts, she danced, she rode, she sang, she talked to every one, sought every amusement, and seemed alone to dread one instant of repose—one single moment of time devoted to self-examina¬ tion and reflection. Ceaseless huny, joyless mirth, endless desire of amuse¬ ment varied the days as they flitted by, 44 Oh, pause to reflect !" said Gondimar. But it was vain : new scenes of interest succeeded each other : till suddenly she started as if already in the dark labyrinth of sin, and shuddering on the very edge of the bottomless chasm, which opened before her feet.

CHAPTER XIII.
Loro Glenarvon was now a favoured guest at the castle. He came, he went, as it suited his convenience or his hu¬ mour.—But every time he came, the se¬ cret interest he had excited was strength¬ ened ; and every time he went, he left apparently deeper maries of regret. Sir Richard Mowbrey and Sir George Buchanan were at this time also át the castle. Sir Everard, forgetful of his wrongs, and his Lady of her projects for the emancipation of her countrymen, kept open house during their stay ; Lady St. Clare, in pursuance of her plan of restoring herself to society, as¬ sisted with her daughters, at a concert in the great assembly-rooms at Belfont, given in honour of the Admiral's arrival
On the eventful evening*, the whole party at the castle resolved to make a most wonderful éclat, by their brilliant appear¬ ance and popular condescension, The Duke addressed himself to every indivi¬ dual with his accustomed affability. Lord Avondale attended upon his uncle, who amused himself by talking up and down that part of the room which was pre« pared for the dancers, bowing to all, shaking hands with all, and receiving those compliments which his brave con* duct deserved. Pale, trembling, «and scarcely heeding the scene, Calantha watched with breathless anxiety for one alone ; and that one, ?e>r what cause «he knew not, spoke not to her. " Where is he ?"—" Which is he?"~* Was whispered now from mouth to mouth. The Admiral, the Duke, the concert were forgotten. One object appeared suddenly to engage the most boundless curiosity. " Is that really Lord Glenarvon?" said a pretty little woman g4
pushing her way towards him. 44 Oh let me but have the happiness of speaking one word to him :—let me but say, when I return to mv home, that 1 have seen him, and I shall be overjoyed." Calantha made room for the enthusiastic Lady ; —she approached—*she offered her hand to the deliverer of his Country as she called him. He accepted it with grace, but some embarrassment. The rush w.as then general: everyone would see—would speak to their Lord—their King; and the,fashionable reserve which affectation had, for a moment, taught the good peo¬ ple of Belfont to assume, soon vanished, when nature spoke in their bosoms : so that had not the performers of the grand concerto called to order, Lord Glenarvon had been absolutely obliged to make his retreat. The mystery in which his fate appeared involved, his youth, his misfor¬ tunes, his brave conduct, and perhaps even his errors awakened this interest in such as beheld him. But he turned
form the gaze of strangers with bitter¬ ness. " Will you allow me to seat myself near you ?" lie said, approaching Calantha's chair. " Can you «ask ?" " Without asking, I would not. You may possibly stay till late : I shall go early. My only inducement in coming here was you." " Oh ! do not say, what I «am well assured is not true/* " I never say what 1 do not feel. Your presence here alone makes me endure all this fulsome flattery, noise, display. If you dance—that is, when you dance, I shall retire." The concert now began with frequent bursts of applause. Suddenly a general murmur proclaimed some new and unex¬ pected event:—a young performer ap¬ peared. Was it a boy! Such grace—such beauty, soon betrayed her: it was Miss St. Clare. She could not hope for admittance in her own character ; yet, under a feigned name, she had promised to assist at the performance ; and the known popularity
of her songs, and the superior sweetness of her voice, prevented the professors from enquiring too much into the pro¬ priety of such an arrangement Messieurs John Maclane and Creigh- ton had just been singing, in Italian, an opera buffa. The noise they had made was such, that even the most courteous had been much discountenanced. A mo¬ ment's pause ensued ; when, without one blush of diffidence, but, on the con¬ trary, with an air of dauntless and even contemptuous effrontery, the youthful performer seized her harp—Glenarvon's harp—and singing, whilst her dark bril¬ liant eyes were fixed upon him alone. she gave vent to the emotions of her own bosom, and drew tears of sympathy from many another. The words w r ere evi¬ dently made at the moment; and breathed from the heart. She studied not the com¬ position, but the air was popular, and for that reason it had effect.
I Γ to lose all that love thee, should e'er be thy lot, By the world, that now courts thee, contemu'd or forgot; When thy own tickle heart has all others estranged, Then remember St. Clara, who never had chaDged. Who had followed thy steps, though in eickness and sadness, More firm to the last than the foes who upbraid Ьегз Who had followed thy steps, though to death and to madness, Then mourn o'er the grave where thy falsehood hasIaH hcr. Ah, say not! Ah, think not ! she e'er can recover, The blow never fails from the hand of a lover *, Full home it was struck, and it fell on a breast By remorse and uukindness already deprest, A «mile oft, in death, may illumine each feature, When hope, fondly cherished, for ever is past j Aud the heart that is noble aud high in its nature, Though deserted and scorn'd, will be ñrm to the last.
The admiration for the young enthu¬ siast was checked by the extreme disgust her shameless ill conduct had occasioned. The tears, too, of Sir Everard, who was present, and audibly called upon his cruel ungrateful niece, excited a strong feeling of sympathy and indignation. She re¬ tired the moment she had ended her song, and the commotion her presence ЪаА excited subsided with her de¬ parture. The heiress of Delaval, decked in splendid jewels, had not lost, by compa¬ rison, with the deserted Elinor. She was the reigning favourite of the moment t every one observed it, and smiled upon her the more on that account. To be the favourite of the favoured wag too much. The adulation paid to her during the -evening, and the caresses lavished upon her had possibly turned a wiser head than her's ; but alas ! a deeper interest em¬ pio) ed her thoughts, and Glenarvon's attention was her sole object.
Calantha had felt agitated and serious during Miss St. Clare's performance. Lord Glenarvon had conversed with his customary ease ; yet something had wounded her. Perhaps she saw, in the gaze of strangers, that this extreme and sudden intimacy was observed ; or pos¬ sibly her heart reproached her. She felt that not vanity alone, nor even enthusi¬ asm, was the cause of her present emo¬ tion. She knew not, nor could define the motive ; but, with seeming inconsis¬ tency, after refusing positively to dance, she sent for Buchanan and joined in that amusement ; and, as if the de¬ sire of exercise had susperseded every other, she danced ön with an energy and perseverance, which excited the warmest approbation in all. " What spirits Lady Avondale has !" said one. fcw How charming she is !" cried another. She herself only sighed. " Have you ever read a tragedy of Ford's ?" whispered Lady Augusta to Ca-
lantha, as soon as she had ceased to exhi¬ bit— 44 a tragedy entitled The Broken Heart." 44 No," she replied, half vexed, half offended, u At this moment you put me vastly in mind of it. You look most woefully. Come, tell me truly, is not your heart in torture ? and, like your namesake Calantha, while lightly danc¬ ing the gayest in the ring, has not the shaft already been struck, and shall you not die ere you attain the goal ?" She indeed felt nearly ready to do so ; and fanning herself excessively, declared, that it was dreadfully hot—that she should absolutely expire of the heat : yet while talking and laughing with those who Surrounded her, her eye looked cau¬ tiously round, eager to behold the re¬ sentment and expected frowns of him whom she had sought to offend ; but there was no frown on Lord Glenarvon's brow—no look of resentment, 44 And are you happy ?" he said, ap¬ proaching her with gentleness. « Per-
haps so, since some can rejoice in the sufferings of others. Yet 1 forgive you, because I know you are not yourself. I see you are acting from pique : but you have no cause ; for did you know my heart, and could you feel what it suffer» on your account, your doubts would give way to far more alarming suspicions." He paused, for she turned abruptly from him. " Dance on then, Lady Avondale," he continued, " the admiration of those for whose society you were formed—the easy prey of every coxcomb to whom that ready hand is so continually offered, and ivhich 1 have never once dared to ap¬ proach. Such is tbe respect whicli wall ever be shewn to the object of real admi¬ ration, interest and regard, although that object seems willing to forget that it is her due. But," added he, assuming that air of gaiety he had one moment laid aside, " I detain you, do I not ? See Co¬ lonel Donallan and the Italian Count aw r ait you." You mistake me," she said
gravely ; " I could not presume to imagine that my dancing would be heeded by you: I could have no motive." u None but the dear delight of tormenting," he replied, " which gave a surprising elasticity to your step, I can assure you. Indubitably had not that impulse assisted, you could not thus have excelled yourself." "If you knew," she said, " what 1 suffer at this moment you would spare me. Why do you deride me?" " Because, oh Lady Avondale, I dare not—I cannot speak to you more seriously. I feel that I have no right—no claim on you I dread offend¬ ing ; but to-morrow 1 shall expiate all ; for I leave you to-morrow.—Yes, it must be so. I am going from Ireland. Indeed I was going before I had the misery of believing that I should leave anything in it I could ever regret." W hat Calau thafeU when he said this, cannot be described. 44 Will you dance the two next dances with me ?" said Colonel Donallan, now approaching. *' I am tired : will you ex-
cuse me ? I believe our carriages are or¬ dered." 44 Oh, surely you will not go away before supper." 4i Ask Lady Mandeville what she means to do." 44 Lady Tre¬ lawney and Miss Seymour stay." 44 Then, perhaps I shall." The Colonel bowed and retired.^— 44 Give me the rose you wear," said Glenarvon in a low voice, 44 in return for the one I presented you at Donallan Park." 44 Must I ?" 44 You must," he said, smiling. With some hesitation, she obeyed ; yet she looked around in hopes no vigilant eye might ob¬ serve her. Shetook itfrom her bosom,and gave it tremblingly into his hands. Alarge pier glass reflected the scene to the whole company. The rose thus given, was re¬ ceived with transport. It said more, thus offered, than a thousand words :—it ivas taken and pressed to a lover's lips, till all its blushing beauties were gone, then it was cast down on the earth to be tram¬ pled upon by many. And had Calantha wished it, she might have read in the
history of the flower, the fate that ever attends on guilty love. And was it love she feft so soon—so strongly !—It is not possible. Alarmed, grieved, flattered at his altered manner, she turned aside to conceal the violent, the undefinable emotions, to which she had become a prey :—a dream of ecstasy for one moment fluttered in her heart ; but the recollection of Lord Avondale recurring, she started with horror from herself—from him; and, abruptly taking leave, retired, 44 Are you going?" smd Glenarvon. * 4 1 attı ill/' she answered. 44 Will you suffer me to accompany you ?" he said, as he assisted her into her carriage ; 44 or possibly it is not the custom in this coun¬ try : -¿- you mistrust me—you think it wrong."— 44 No," she answered with em¬ barrassment ; and he seated himself by her side. The distance to the castle was short. Lord Glenarvon was more re¬ spectful, more reserved, more silent than
before he had entered the carriage. On quitting it only he pressed her hand to his heart, and bade her feel for the agony she had implanted there. None perhaps, ever before felt wliat she did at this instant ......
CHAPTER XIV. If any indifferent person approach us, it either is disagreeable, or at least unim¬ portant ; but when it is a person we love, it thrills through the heart, and we are unable to speak or to think. Could she have im-agined that Lord Glenarvon felt for her, she had been lost. But that was imposible; and yet his manner;—it was so marked, there could be no doubt. She was inexperienced, we may add, inno¬ cent; though sufficiently prepared to become every thing that was the re¬ verse. Yet in a moment she felt her own danger, and resolved to guard against it. How then can so many affirm, when they know that they are loved, that it is a mere harmless friendship ! how can they, in palliation of their errors, bring forw.ard the perpetuallyrepeated excuso
that they were beguiled ! The heart that is chaste and pure will shrink the soonest from the very feeling that would pollute it :~in vain it would attempt to deceive itself: the very moment we love, or are loved, something within us points out the danger:—even when we fly from him, to whom we could attach ourselves, we feel a certain embarrassment—an emotion, which is not to be mistaken ; and, in a lover's looks, are there not a thousand assurances and confessions ivhich no de¬ nial of words can for a moment disguise? Lord Glenarvon had denied to Calantha the possibility of his ever again feeling at¬ tachment. This had not deceived her ; but she was herself too deeply and sud¬ denly struck ro the heart to venture to hope for a return. Besides, she did not think of this as possible:—he seemed to her so far above her—so far above every thing. She considered him as entirely different from all others; and, if not su-
perior, atleastdissimilar and consequently not to be judged by the same crite¬ rion. It is difficult to explain Calantha's pe¬ culiar situation with respect to Lord Avon- dale. Yet it is necessary briefly to state in what manner they were situated at this particular period. They were dearer to each other perhaps, than any two who had been so long united iu marriage. They loved each other with more passion, more enthusiasm than is often retained ; but they were, from a thousand circum* stances, utterly estranged at this time; and that apparently by mutual consent— like two violent spirits which had fretted and chafed and opposed each other, till both were sore and irritated. In the course of years, they had said every thing that was most galling and bitter; and though the ardent attachment they really felt, had ever followed those momentary bursts of fury, the veil had
been toru aside—that courtesy* which none should ever suffer themselves to for¬ get, had been broken through, and they had yielded too frequently to the sudden impulse of passiou, ever to feel secure that the ensuing moment might not produce a scene of discord. Calmness and deliberation had van*· quished Calantha; violence could not. When provoked, Lord Avondale was too severe ; and when he saw her mi¬ serable and oppressed, it gave him more suffering than if he had himself been subdued. There are feiv spirits which cannot be overcome if dexterously at* tacked ; but w ith the fierce and d-aring* force will generally be found useless. It shouki be remembered that, like madr ness, these distorted characters see not things as they are ; and, like martyr» and fanatics, they attach a degree of glory to every privation aud punishment in \Ы noble cause of opposition to what thejr
conceive is unjust authority. Such a character h open and guileless; but unhappily, the Very circumstance that makes it sincere, renders it also, if it turn from the right course, desperate and hardened. Hypocricyand falsehood, how¬ ever disgusting, are perhaps less dange¬ rous symptoms than that fearless open¬ ness. The former at least proves a sense of shame, and whilst this exists all virtue is not extinct. During the first years of their mar¬ riage, these tumultuous scenes but strengthened the attachment they felt for each other; but when Lord Avon- dale's profession absorbed his mind, he dreaded a recurrence of those quarrels and reconciliations which had once so entirely engrossed his thoughts. He left Calantha, therefore, to the guidance of that will, which she had so long and per¬ tinaciously indulged. Absent, pre-oc¬ cupied, he saw not, he heard not, the
misuse she made of her entire liberty. Some trifle, perhaps, at times, reached his ear ; à scene of discord ensued ; much bit¬ terness on both sides followed : and the conviction that they no longer loved each other, added considerably to the violence of recrimination. They knew not how deeply rooted affection such as they had once felt, must ever be—how the very ties that compelled them to belong to each other, strengthened, in fact, the attachment whicli inclination «and love had first inspired ; but, with all the petulance and violence of character natural to each, they fled estranged ща offended from each other's so¬ ciety. JLord Avondale sought, in an active and manly profession, for some newer interest» in which every feeling of api- bition could, have part; a t nd she, sur¬ rendering bei\ soul ţa the illusive drefun ; of а, пщ4. and guilty ^расЬдопП Vol.11. И
boasted that she had found again the happines she had lost; and con¬ trasted the indifference of her husband with the ardour, the devotion, the re¬ fined attention of a newly acquired friend.
CHAPTER XV. O better had it been ίο die than to see and hear Gleimrvon. When he smiled, it was like the light of heaven ; and when he spoke, his voice was more soothing in its sweetness than music. He wa» so gentle in his manners, that it was in vain even to affect to be offeuded ; and, though he said he never again could love. he луоиИ describe Ьолу some had died, and others maddened, under the power οΐ that fierce passion—how every tie that binds us, and every principle and !алу, must be broken through, as secondary considerations, by its victims: he would speak home to the heart ; for he кпелу it in all ifs timings and windings; and, at his ΛνϋΙ, he could rouse or tame the varying passions of those over ivhom besought to exercise dominion. Yet, wlien bv everv 'n 2
art and talent he had raised the flames of love, tearing himself from his victim, he would leave her, and then weep for the agony of grief by ivhich he saw her destroyed. Had he betrayed in his manner to Ca¬ lantha that freedom, that familiarity so offensive in men, but yet so frequent amongst them, she would yet have shud¬ dered. But what was she to fly? Not from the gross adulation, or the easy flip¬ pant protestations to which all women are soon or late accustomed : but from a res¬ pect, at once refined and flattering—an attention devoted even to her least wishes, yet without appearing subservient — a gentleness and sweetness, as rare as they were fascinating ; and these combined with all the powers of imagination, vigour of intellect, and brilliancy of wit, which none ever before possessed in so iminent a degree ; and none ever since haye^even presumed to rival. Could she fly from a being unlike all others—
sought for by every one, yet, by his own confession, wholly and entirely devoted to herself. How cold compared with Glenarvon, was the regard her family and friends af¬ fected ! Was it confidence in her honour, or indifference? Lord Glenarvon asked Calantha repeatedly, which it most re¬ sembled — he appealed to her vanity even, whether strong affection could thus neglect, and leave the object of its soli¬ citude? Yet, had she done nothing to «ЫЙ o bildband and parenťs affection— had she not herself lessened the regard they had so faithfully cherished ? Calantha thought she had sufficient honour and spirit to tell her husband at once the danger to which she was ex- poser! ; but wlien she considered more seriously her situation, it appeared to her almost ridiculous to fancy that it was so imminent. If upon some occasion, Lord Glenarvon's manner лгав ardent, the en¬ suing morning she found him cold,
distant and pre-occupied, and she felt ashamed of the weakness which, for one moment, could have made her imagine she was the object of his thoughts. In¬ deed, he often took an opportunity of stating, generally, that he never could feel either interest or love for any thing on earth ; that once he had felt too deeply and had suffered bitterly from it; and that now his sole regret was in the cer¬ tainty that he never again could be so deceived. He spoke, with decision, of leaving Ireland, mid more than once repeated, emphatically to the Duke, " I shall never forget the kindness which prompted } ou to seek me out, when under very unplea¬ sant circumstances ; I shall immediately withdraw my name from the directory— my sentiments I cannot change; but you have already convinced me of the fojly of spreading them amongst the unen¬ lightened multitude." Sir Everard, who was present, lifted up
his hands at such discourse. 4i He is a convert of mine, I verily believe," he cried ; 44 and Elinor"— 44 Miss St. Clare," whispered Glenarvon, turning to the Doctor, 44 has long-been admonished by me, to return to an indulgent uncle, and throw herself on 3'our mercy." " My mercy !" said Sir Everard, bursting into tears,—" my gratitude. Oh! my child, my darling." 4b And believe me," con¬ tinued Lord Glenarvon, with an air which seemed haughtily to claim belief, 4ς I re¬ turn her as innocent as she came to me. Her imagination may have bewildered and beguiled her; but her principles are uncorrupted." 44 Generous young noble¬ man !" exclaimed Sir Everard, ready to kneel before him — 44 noble, mighty, grand young gentleman ! wonder of our age!" Lord Glenarvon literally smiled through his tears ; for the ridicule öf Sir Everard did not prevent his excellent and warm feelings from àflfectíng those who knew him well. 4< Aiid will she h4
return to her poor uncle?" u I know not/' said Lord Glenarvon, gravely : " I fear not ; but I have even implored her to do so/* " Oh, if you fail who are so fair and so persuasive, who can hope to mqve her ?" " She may hear a parent's voice/* said Glenarvon, " even though deaf to a lover's prayer." " And are you indeed a lover to my poor deluded Eli¬ nor ?" " I was," said Lord Glenarvon, proudly ; " but her strange conduct, ancl stubborn spirit have most effectually cured me; and I must own, Sir Everard, I v o not think I ever again can even affect a feeìiiìg of this sort : after all, it is a useless way of passing life.*' " You are right/' said the Doctor ; " quite right ; and it injures the health : there is nothing creates bile, and hurts the constitution more, than suspense and fretting :— ·Ι know it by myself." They луеге standing in the library during this discourse. Lady Avondale entered now: Lord Glenarvon approached
her. They were for a few moments alone : —he leant over her ; she held a book in her hand ; he read a few lines ; it is not possible to describe how well he read them. The poetry he read was beautiful as bis own ; it affected him, He read more ; he became animated ; Calantha looked up ; he fixed his eyes on bers ; hè forgot the poem ; his hand touched hers, as he replaced the book before her ; she drew away her hand ; he took it and pressed it to his lips. 44 Pardon me," he said, 4C I am miserable, but I will never injure you. Fly me, Lady Avondale : I deserve not either interest or regard ; and to look upon me is in itself pollution to one like you." He then said a few words expressive of his admiration for her husband :— 44 He is as superior to me,'^ he said, " as Hyperion to a satyr :—-imd you love him, do you not?" continued he, smiling« «« Can you ask?" 44 He seems most attached, too, to you^ * 4 Far, far more than I deserve." h 5
44 I can never love again," said Gle¬ narvon, still holding her hand ; 4t never. There will be no danger in my friend¬ ship," he said, after a moment's thought: " none ; for I am cold as the grave— as death ; and all here," he said pressing ber hand upon his heart, 4t is chilled, îost, absorbed. They will speak ill of me," he continued rather mournfully; ** and you will learn to hate me." u I ! never, never. I will defend you, if abused ; I will hate those who hate you ; I—" He smiled : " How infatuated you are," he said, * 4 poor little thing that seeks to destroy itself. Have you not then heard what I have done ?" 44 1 have heard much," said Calantha, 4i but I ^ now —I feel it is false." 44 It is all too true," said Lord Glenarvon carelessly :— 44 all quite true ; and there is much worse yet : but it is no matter," he continued ; 44 the never dying worm feeds upon my heart ; I am like death, Lady Avondale ; ano! all beneath ¡^seared"
Whilst the conscience wakes, and the blush of confused and trembling guilt yet varies the complexion, the sin is not of long standing, or of deep root ; but when the mind seeks to disguise from itself its danger—when, playing upoti the edge of the precipice, the victim Wif- lingly deludes itself, and appears hård and callous to every admonitory èautioiï, then is the moment for alarm ; and that moment now appeared to realize Calan¬ tha's feats. Attacked with some asperity by her nu¬ merous friends, for her imprudent con¬ duct, she now boldlv avowed her friend- ship for Glenarvon, and disclaimed the possibility of its exceeding the bounds of the strictest propriety prescribed. She even gloried in his attachment ; and said that there was not one of those who were admonishing her to beware who would not readily, nay, even gladly fill her place. Calantha had seen their let¬ ters to him: she had marked their ad-
vances; she imagined that all others, like herself, were enamoured of the same idol ; and in this instance she was right : —the infatuation was general: he was termed the leader of the people, the libe¬ rator of his country, the defender of the rights of Ireland. If he wandered forth through Belfont, he was followed by ad¬ miring crowds ; and whilst he affected to disdain the transient homage, she could but perceive that he lost no opportunity by every petty artifice of encreasing the illusion.
CHAPTER XVL Ат this crisis the whole party at the castle were disturbed by the unexpected arrival of the Princess of Madagascar at Dublin. A small fleet had been seen approaching the coast : it was rumour¬ ed that the French, in open boats, were preparing to invade Ireland ; but it proved, though it may sound rather ludi¬ crous to say so, only the great Nabob and the Princess of Madagascar. Their immense retinue and baggage, which the common people took for the heavy artillery, arrived without incident or ac¬ cident at Belfont ; and the couriers having prepared the Duke for the recep¬ tion of his illustrious guest, they await¬ ed her arrival with considerable impa¬ tience. During the bustle and noise, this little
event occasioned, Lord Glenarvon came to Lady Avondale and whispered in her ear, 4t I shall walk this evening : contrive to do so too, as I have something of im¬ portance to tell you." He gave her a ring. It was an emerald with a harp engraved upon it—the armorial bearing of Ireland : 44 let us be firm and united," was written under. 44 I mean it merelv politically," he said smiling. u Even were you a Clarissa, you need not bé alarmed : I am no Lovelace, I promisé you." The princess ivas now announced, fifty- three attendants and twenty-four domes¬ tic friends, were her small and conscien¬ tious establishment, besides a cook, con« fectioner and laundress, to the total dis¬ comfiture of Irish hospitality. The high priest in the dress of the Greek Church, ever attended her, and eagerly sought to gainadherents to the only true established church, at whatever house he occasionally rested. The simplicity of Hoiouskim,
his eagerness, his abilities and informa¬ tion, added much to the rational pleasure of the society at Castle Delaval. But neither the presence of the Nabob nor the caresses of the Princess, who cast many a gentle glance upon Glenarvon, could for one moment detach his thoughts from Calantha. On the contrary he an¬ swered her with distant reserve «and ap¬ peared eager to shew to every one the marked distinction he felt for the woman he loved. " Oh ! he is really sincere," she thought, as he left them all to attend to her. " I amuse, I soothe him," the hope rendered her blest and she felt in¬ different to every consequence. " You are not as handsome as Sophia," said Glenarvon, looking on her ; " but I admire you more. Your errors are such as you have frankly confessed ; but you have others which you wished me not to perceive. Few have so many faults ; yet how is it that you have wound yourself already round this cold, this
selfish heart, which had resolved never again to admit any inmate. You love your husband, Lady Avondale; I respect you too well to attempt to change your affec¬ tion ; but if I wished it, your eyes alrea¬ dy tell me what power 1 have gained :—I couid do what I would." 44 No, no," she answered. 44 You are too vain." 4ς None ever yet resisted me," said Glenarvon : 44 do you think you could ?" Calantha scarce knew how to answer ; but while she assured him she could resist any one and had no fear for herself, she felt the contrary ; and trembled with mixed ap¬ prehensions of joy and sorrow at her boast—when others approached, he did not change his manner to Calantha : he discontinued his conversation ; but he still looked the same : he was not fearful as some would have been, or servile, or fqjl of what might be said : he seemed in all respects careless or desperate. He lighed, but his laugh was not the hearťs kuigh: his wit enlivened and dazzled
others ; but it seemed not the efiect of exuberent spirits. It was not unfrequently the custom at Castle Delaval, during the fine summer evenings, to walk after dinner, before cards or music. The flower gardens, and shrubbery were the most usual pla¬ ces of resort. Lady Augusta smilingly observed to Lady Mandeville and Sophia, that, for some evenings past, Lady Avon- tlale had taken more extensive rambles, and that Lord Glenarvon and she were oftentimes absent till supper was an¬ nounced. The Count Gondimar, who overheard the remark, affected to think it malignant, and asked with a sarcastic sneer, whether Lord Avondale were with her on these evening excursions ? " Little Mowbrey seems a great favourite of Lord Glenarvon*«,*' said Lady Augusta ; ' 4 but 1 do not fancy his father is often of the party, or that his being Lady Avondale's child is the cause ofthe partiality : the boy has a sprightly Wit. We must not draw
unfair conclusions : last year Mr. Bucha¬ nan gave us alarm ; and now it is quite natural ive should all fall in love with Lord Glenarvon. I have myself ; only he will not return my advances. Did you observe v> hat an e%e I made him at breakfast ?.... but that never was a love making meal. Place me but near him at supper, and you shall see what I can do/' Gondimar suddenly left Lady Augusta, who was walking on the terrace. He had caught a glimpse of Calantha as she wandered sloivly by the hanks of Elle :— he hastened to the spot ; he saw her ; he penetrated her feelings ; and he returned thoughtful and irritateti to the Castle- Snatching a pen he wrote for some time. Lady Trelawney and Lady Augusta, ob¬ serving him, approached and insisted upon being made acquainted with \ш studies, " It is alı ode you are inditing, I am certain," said thé latter, " I saw you struck by the God as you darted from me*" " You are right," cried Gondimar,
1 am composing a song." 44 In English too, I perceive." u What ifit be English ? you know one of my talents can write even in that damn'd language : so criti¬ cise my rhapsody if you dare. At ail events Lady Avondale will admire it ; for it is about a rose and love-—most senti¬ mental. And where is she ? for till her return, I will not shew it you." If that question where is Lady Avon- dale must be answered, it is with sorrow and regret that such answer will be made: —sbe was walking* «Inwly, as Gondimar had seen her, by the banks of the river Elle : she was silent, too, and mournful ; her spirits were gone ; her air was that of one who is deeply interested in all she hears. She was not alone—Lord Gle¬ narvon was by her side. It was their custom thus to walk : they met daily ; they took every opportunity of meeting ; and when in their morniug and evening- rambles she pointed out the beautiful views around, the ranging mountains
and the distant ocean,—he would des¬ cribe in giving language, the far more magnificent and romantic scenery of the countries through which he had passed—countries teaming with rich fruits, vineyards and olive groves ; luxu¬ riant vales and mountains, soaring аЬол^е the clouds, whose summits were white v/ith snow, while a rich and ceaseless ve¬ getation adorned the valleys beneath. He told her that he hated these cold northern climes, and the bottle green of the Atlan¬ tic ; that could »be ecc the darU blue of the Mediterranean, whose clear лvave re¬ flected the cloudless sky, she would never be able to endure those scenes in which she now took such delight. And soon those scenes lost all their charms for Ca¬ lantha ; for that peace of mind which gave them charms was fast departing ; and she sighed for that beautiful land to which his thoughts reverted, and those Italian climes, to луЫсЬ he said, he so soon must return.
CHAPTER XVII. It was upon this evening, that, håving walked for a considerable time, Lady Avondale felt fatigued and rested for a moment near the banks of Elle. She pointed to the roses which grew luxu¬ riantly around. " They are no longer rare," she said, alluding to the one he had given her upon their first acquaintance at Donallan : " but are they the less pri¬ zed ?" He understood her allusion, and pulling a bud from the mossy bank on which it grew, he kissed it, and putting it gently to her lips asked her, if the perfume were sweet, and which she preferred of the two roses ivhich he had offered her? She knew not what she ansivered ; and she afterwards wished she could forget what she had then felt. Gondimiir passed them at that mo-
ment :—He observed her confusion ; he retired as if fearful of encreasing it ; and, but too conscious that such conversation was wrong, Calantha attempted once to change it. " I will shew you the new lodge," she said turning up a large gravel walk, out ofthe shrubbery. " Shew me ! " Glenarvon answered smi ling. " Trust me, I know every lodge and walk here better than yourself;" and he amused himself with her surprise. Some thought, how¬ ever, occurred, which checked his merri¬ ment—some remembrances made this boast of his acquaintance with the place painful to him. There was one, whom he had formerly seen and admired, who ivas no longer present and whom every one but himself appeared to have for¬ gotten—one who, lovely in the first bloom of spotless youth, had felt for him all that even his heart could require. She was lost—he should never see her more. A momentary gloom darkened his countenance at this recollection. He
looked upon Calantha and she trembled $ for his manner was much altered. Heť cheeks kindled as she spoke :—her eye dared no longer encounter his. If she looked up for a moment, she withdrew in haste, unable to sustain the ardent glance : her step tremblingly advanced, lingering, but yet unwilling to pause or to retreat. Her heart beat in tumult, or swelled with passion, as he whispered to her that, which sbe ought never to have heard. She hastened towards the castle : —he did not attempt to detain her. It was late : the rest of the company were gone home. Thither she hastened ; and hurrying to the most crowded part of the room, flushed with her walk, she com¬ plained of the heat, and thought that every eye was fixed upon her with looks of strong disapprobation. W «as it indeed so ? or was it a guilty conscience which made her think so ? Lady Mandeville observing her dis¬ tress, informed her that Count Gondimar,
had been composing a song, but wouhl not sing it till she was present. She eagerly desired to hear it. " It is about a rose," said Gondimar, significantly glancing his eye upon the one in Calan- tha's bosom. The colour in her cheeks became far redder than the flower. " Sing- it," she said, " or rather let me read it... or... but wherefore are you not dan¬ cing, or at billiards ? How dull it must be for Clara and Charlotte" (these were two of Lady Mandeville's children). " You never thought of Lady Mande- ville's beautiful children, and our state of dullness, while you were walking," cried Lady Augusta, iC and last night you recollect that when you made every one dance, you sat apart indulging vain phan¬ tasies and idle reveries. However, they are all gone into the ball-room, if dancing is the order of the night ; but as for me, I shall not stir from this spot, till I hear Count Gondimar's song." " I will sing it you, Lady Avondale,"
said the Count, smiling at her distress, 44 the first evening that you remain at your balcony alone, watching the clouds as they flit across the moon, and listening, I conclude, to the strains of the nightin¬ gale." * 4 Then," she said, affecting un¬ concern, 4i I claim your promise for to¬ morrow night, punctually at nine." He approached the piano-forte. 4t Oh not now—I am engaged,—I must dance." 44 Now or never," said theCount. 44 Never then, never," she answered, almost cry¬ ing, though she affected to laugh. Lady Augusta entreated for the song, and the Count, after a short prelude, placed the manuscript paper before him, and in a low tone of voice began :— (To the air of " Ils ne sont plus. 4 *) Waters of Elle 1 thy limpid streams are flowing", Smooth and untioubled, through the flo\v*ry vale: O'er thy green banks onc-p mûre, the wild rose blowing, Greets the young spring,and scents the passing gate. Voi. u. ι
Høre *twas at eve, near yonder tree reposing, One still too dear, (irst breath'd his vows to thee: Wear this, he cried, his gmleful love disclosing, Near to thy heart, in memory of me. JLove's cherished gift, the rose he gare, is faded; Love's blighted flower, can never bloom again. Weep for thy fault—in heart—in mmd degraded: Weep, if thy tears can wash away the stain. Call back the vows, that once to heaven were plighted, Vows full of love, of innocence and truth. Call back the scenes in which thy soul delighted : Call back the dream that blest Ihy early youth. Tiow silver stream, tho' threatening tempests lower, Bright, mild aud clear, thy gentle waters now; Round thy green banks, the spring's young blossom· flower; O'er thy soft waves the balmy zephyrs blow* —Yet, all in vain; for never spring arraying Nature in charms, to thee can make it fair. IU fated love, clouds ali thy path, pourtray ing Years past of bliss, and future of dej»p<>ir. Gondimar seemed affected whilst he eung; and Calantha felt nearly suffocated with every sort of feeling. Lady Augusta

pretended not to understand it, and has¬ tened with Calantha into the adjoining room. Lord Glenarvon followed «and approached Lady Avondale: "Remember me in your prayers, my gentlest friend/* he whispered. " Even in the still night let some remembrance of Glenarvon occur. Think of me, for I am jealous even of thy dreams/* The angry glance of Gondimar interrupted the conference. Calantha could not sleep that night. A thousand fears and hopes rushed upon her mind. She retired to her room : at one time seized a pen, and wrote, in all the agony of despair, a full confession of her guilty feelings to her husband ; the next she tore the dreadful testimony of har erring heart, and addressed herself to heaven for mercy. But vain the struggle. From childhood's earliest day she never hed refused herself one wish, or one in* dulgence. She knew not, on the sudden how to allay the fierce and maddening fever that raged within, " I am lost," i2
she cried, " I love—I worship. To live without him will be death—worse, worse than death. One look, one smile from Glenarvon, is dearer than ought else that heaven has to offer. Then let me not attempt, what I have not power to effect. Oh, as his friend, let me still behold him. His love, some happier, some better heart shall possess." Again she started with horror from herself. " His love!" she cried, " and can 1 think of him in so criminal—so guilty a manner! I who am a wife—a mother! Let me crush such feelings even now in their birth. Let me fly him, whilst yet it is possible; nor imagine the grief, he says my absence ivill cause, can exceed the misery my dis¬ honourable attachment will bring upon both ! And did he dare to tell me that he loved me ? W as not this in itself a proof that he esteemed me no longer? Misera¬ ble, wretched Calantha; where shall I fly to hide my shame ? How conceal from a lover's searching eyes that he is too dear?"
With such thoughts she attempted to close her eyes ; but dreadful dreams dis¬ turbed her fancy ; and the image of Gle¬ narvon pursued her even in sleep. She saw him—not kneeling at her feet, in all the impassioned transports of love ; not radiant with hope, nor even mournful with despondency and fear ; but pale, deadly, and cold : his hand was ice, and, as he placed it upon hers, she shrunk as from the grasp of death, and awoke oppressed with terror.
лЗ
CHAPTER XVIII. No one had apparently observed Lady Avondale's feigned indisposition that evening—feigned, indeed, it was not ; no one soothed her during her sleepless night; and in the morning when she awoke, at an early hour, Lord Avondale asked her not the cause of her disquiet, deeply grieved at her altered manner— too proud to seek the confidence he per- peceived that he had lost—disappointed in the character and conduct of the woman he had chosen as a companion and solace, he watched not her actions, he penetrated not her feelings, but finding that his presence was distasteful to her, he avoided her: he even thought that he no longer loved one who in every point had acted in the manner he least ap¬ proved. Some there are whose affections
change with their esteem and good opi¬ nion. UnhappHy for Lord Avondale this was not his nature. Long habit had rendered Calantha dear. He thought that he had become indifferent, but he knew not that the empire with which she seized over his heart. She arose and descended upon the terrace :—her steps involuntarily led her to the banks of the Elle. The flowers, fresh with deiv, sparkled in the sunshine, and scented the soft morning air. She hurried on, re¬ gardless of the distance. The flower Glenarvon had given her was faded: but its leaves were preserved by her with fondest care. Whilst yet she walked, at a little dis¬ tance she perceived Gondimar, and w.as in consequence preparing to return, ivhen he abruptly accosted her ; and with a manner too little respectful, rudely seiz¬ ed her hand. 44 Have you not slept?'* he cried, u my charming, my adored young friend, that you are thus early iö i4
your walk ; or did you imagine that others, beside myself, would wander upon these banks, and await your fairy step ? О suffer one who admires—who loves, to open his heart to you—to seize this opportunity." *' Leave me, approach me not. What have 1 done to deserve this from you?" she exclaimed. " Why seize my hand by force ? Why press it— oh Heavens î to those detested lips ? Leave me, Count Gondimar : forget not the respect due to every woman." " Of virtue !" he replied, with a scornful smile. " But tell me, has Lady Avon- dale never suffered such insults from some who have no better claim? Has she still a right to this amazing mockery of respect ? Ah ! trust me, we cannot command our love," " Neither can we command our abhorrence—our disgust," she exclaimed, breaking from his grasp and hastening away. As Calantha re-entered the Castle, she met Lady Margaret and Glenarvon, who
appeared surprised and disconcerted at seeing her. " Has Count Gondimar been speaking to you upon any subject of importance ?" said Lady Margaret in a whisper, trying to conceal a look of suspicion, and some embarrassment. Before Calantha could answer, he had joined them ; and expk ning fully that their meeting had been entirely acci¬ dental, they both walked away together and in earnest discourse, leaving Lord Glenarvon and Lady Avondale together. Calantha's heart ivas full, she could not speak, she therefore left him in haste and when alone she wept. Had she not reason ; for every indignity and grief was falling fast upon her. She could not tell ivhat had occurred to Lord Avondale: hehad a proud and dangerous spirit ; and to Glenarvon she ivould not upon every account. Glenarvon awaited her return with anxiety. " I was surprised to see you ivith my aunt," she said, ** what were you saying to fc^r/' He 15
evaded the question, and tenderly en* quired of her the cause of her une-asiness and tears. He loved beyond a doubt— at le.ast he convinced Calantha that he did so. Confused, perturbed, she, more than ever felt the danger of her situation : trem¬ bling she met his eyes, fearing lest he should penetrate her secret. Confident in her own strength: 4ς I will fly," she said, 4C though it be to the utmost ex¬ tremity of the earth; but I will never yield—never betray myself. My fate is sealed-—misery must, in future, be my portion ; but no eye shall penetrate into the recesses of my heart—none shaH share my distress, or counsel me in my calamity." Thus she reasoned, and struggling as she thought, against her guilty passion, by attempting to deceive the object of her devotion, she in reality yielded herself entirely to his power, self deluded and without controul. How new to her mind appeared the
fever of her distracted thoughts I Love she had felt—unhappy love, she had once for a time experienced ; but no taint of guilt wiis mingled with the feeling ; and the approach to vice she started from with horror and alarm. Lord Glenarvon had succeeded too well—she had seen him—she had heard him too often ; she fled in vain : he read his empire in the varying colour of her cheeks; he traced his power in every faultering word, in every struggling sigh : that strange si¬ lence, that timid air, that dread of be¬ holding him — all confirmed, and all tempted him forward to pursue his easy prey. " She is mine/* he cried exult¬ ingly .—" mine, too, without a struggle : this fond wife, this chaste and pure Ca¬ lantha. Wherever 1 turn, new victims fall before me — they await not to be courted." But Lord Glenarvon had oftentimes said, that he never again could feel af¬ fection for any woman. How then was
the interest he shewed Calantha to be accounted for ? W hat name was he to give it? It was the attachment of a brother to the sister whom he loved ; it was all devotion—all purity ; he would never cherish a thought that might not be heard in heaven, or harbour one wish detrimental to the happiness ofhis friend. This was said, as it often has been said : both felt that it was false ; but both continued to repeat, what they wished to believe possible. His health and spirits had much declined ; he looked as if sorrows, which he durst not utter, af¬ flicted his heart; and though, in the presence of others he affected gaiety, when alone with Calantha he did not disguise his sadness. She sought to console him : she was grave—she was gentle, she could be both ; and the oc¬ casion seemed to call for her utmost kindness. He spoke much to her; and sometimes read as Lord Avondale once had done ;
and none ever but Lord Avondale read as well. His tears flowed for the sorrows of those whose poetry and history he re¬ peated. Calantha wept also ; but it was for Glenarvon, that she mourned. When she had ended the tale of love and sorrow, his eyes met hers and they spoke more— far more than words. Perhaps he gene¬ rously resolved to contend against his own feelings ; even at times he warned her of her danger.—But, when he bade her fly him, he held her hand, as if to detain her; and when he said the passion he cherished would cause the misery of both, he acknowledged that her presence alleviated his sufferings, and that he could not bear to see her less.
CHAPTER XIX. There are scenes of guilt it would be horrible to paint — there are hours of agony it is impossible to describe ! AH sympathy recedes from triumphant vice, and the kindest heart burns with indig¬ nation at the bare recital of unpunished crime. By night, by day, the tortures of remorse pursued Lady Avondale. In a husband's presence, she trembled ; from a parent's tenderness she turned with af¬ fected coldness ; her children, she durst not look upon. To the throne of heaven, she no longer offered up one prayer ; upon a sleepless bed, visions of horror distracted her fancy; and when, at break of day, a deep and heavy slumber fell on her, instead of relieving a weary spirit, feverish dreams and maddening appre¬ hensions disturbed her rest» Glenarvon
had entirely possessed himself of her imagination. Glenarvon had said, there was a horrid secret, which weighed upon his mind. He would start at times, and gaze on vacancy ; then turn to Calantha, and ask her what she had heard and seen. His gestures, his menaces were terrific. He would talk to the air ; then laugh with convulsive horror ; and gazing wildly around, enquire of her, if there was not blood upon the earth, and if the ghosts of departed men had not been seen by some. Calantha thought that madness had fallen upon his mind, and wept to think that talents such as his were darkened and shrouded over by so heavy a cala* mity. But when the fierce moment was passed, tears would force their way into his eye, and placing her hand upon his burning head, he would call her his sole comforter, the only hope that was left him upon earth; his dearest, his only friend ;
&nd he would talk to her of happier times; of virtues that had been early blighted; of hopes that his own rashness and errors had destroyed. It was one day, oue dark and fatal day, when passion raging in his bosom, and time and opportunity at hand, he sud¬ denly approached her, and seizing her with violence, asked her if she returned his love. <4 My friendship is ruin," he cried ; 4C all alliance with me must cast disgrace upon the object of my regard. But, Calantha, you must be mine ! May I not even now call you thus ? Shall they ever persuade you to abandon me ? Vain is all attempt at disguise," he continued ; 44 I love you to madness and to distrac¬ tion—you know it too well. Why then suffer me to feel the tortures I endure, when a word—a look from you could re¬ lieve me. You are not indifferent : say then that you are not—thou, who alone canst save me. Here even, in the pre¬ sence of heaven, I will open my whole
heart before you—that heart is seered with guilt ; it is bleeding with venomed wounds, incurable and deadly. A few short years, I have perhaps yet to linger: thou mayest accelerate my fate, and plunge me still lower, whilst I cling to thee for mercy ; but will you do it, because you have the power ?" Calantha scarce could support herself. After a momenťs pause, he continued, " You shall hear me.—Never, since the hour of my birth, never—I make no ex¬ ception of either the living, or, what is far dearer and more sacred to me, the dead—never did I love with such mad and frantic violence as now. О seek not to disguise it ; that love is returned. I read it even now in thine eyes, thy lips ; and whilst, with assumed and barbarous coldness, you would drive me from you, your own heart pleads for me ; and, like myself, you love." Faint and trembling, Calantha now leant for support upon that arm which
surrounded her, and from which she, in vain, attempted to shrink* It was a dread¬ ful moment. Glenarvon, who never yet had sued in vain, marked every varying turn of her countenance which too well expressed his empire and her own weak¬ ness. " I cannot live without you.— Mine you are—mine you shall ever be," he said, " whilst this heart beats with life." Then, with a smile of exultation, he seized her in his arms. Starting, however, with all the terror which the first approach to guilt must ever cause, " Spare me," she cried, ter¬ rified and trembling : " even though my heart should break in the struggle, let me not act so basely by him to whom I am bound."—" Say only, that you do not hate me—say only," he continued, with more gentleness, and pressing her hand to his lips—" say only, that you share the tortures of agony you have inflicted—-say that which I know and see—that I am loved to adoration—even as I love you."
With tears she besought him to spare her. " I feel your power too much," she said. " All that 1 ought not—must not say, I think and feel. Be satisfied ; your empire iscomplete. Spare me—save me ; I have not power to feign." Her tears fell now unrestrained. " There is no need of this/' he said, recovering him¬ self; " you have sealed my fate. A mo¬ ment of passion beguiled me : I am calm now, as when first I met you—calm and cold, even as yourself. Since it is your wish, and since my presence makes your misery, let us part.—I go, as I have often said ; but it shall be alone. My country I leave without regret ; for the chain of tyranny h.as encompassed it : friends, I have none ; and thou, who wert as an angel of light to me—to whom I knelt for safety and for peace—mayst thou be blest: this is all I ask of heaven. As for me, nothing can increase the misery I feel. I wish you not to believe it, or to share it. This is no lovers despondency ■»—no sudden and violent paroxysm occa-
sioned by disappointed passion. It is uttered," he continued, " in the hope¬ lessness of despair : it is the confession, not tbe repining of a heart that was early blighted aud destroyed." Calantha now interrupted him. " I alone am guilty," she replied, " talk not of leaving me ; we may still be friends— we must never be more." " Oh ! pro¬ mise that we shall never be less." Gle¬ narvon looked on her with kindness. " Let no fears dissuade you until I shew myself unworthy of the trust. Forsake not liim, whose only happiness is in your affection. I was joyless and without hope, when first I met you ; but the re¬ turn, to loneliness and misery, is hard to bear. Be virtuous, and, if it may be so, be happy." " That I never more can be," she answered. " You are young in sin yet," said Glenarvon ; " you know not its dangers, its pleasures, or its bit¬ terness. All this, ere long, will be for¬ gotten." " Never forgotten," she replied, " oh never !"
CHAPTER XX. Glenarnon wandered forth every even¬ ing, by the pale moon, and no one knew whither he went, and no one marked but Calantha how late was his return. And when the rain fell heavy and chill, he would bare his forehead to the storm ; and faint and луеагу wander forth, and often he smiled on others and appeard calm, whilst the burning fever of his blood continued to rage within. Once Calantha fol^ved him, ii ivas at sunset, and he stmvedwhen he beheld her, no mark of surprise or joy. She followed him to the rocks called the Black Sisters, and the cleft in the mountain called the Wizzard's Glen ; there was a lonely cottage near the cleft ivhere St Clara, it was said, had taken up her abode. He knocked ; but she ivas from
home : he called ; but no one replied from within. Her harp was left at the entrance of a boiver ; a few books and a table were also there. Glenarvon ap¬ proached the harp and leaning upon it, fixed his eyes mournfylly and steadfastly upon Calantha. 44 Others who formerly felt or feigned interest for me," he said, 44 were either unhappy in their marriage, or in their situation ; but you brave every thing for me. Unhappy Calantha ! how little do you know the heart for which you are preparing to sacrifice so much." The place upon which they stood was wild and romantic; the sea murmured beneath them ; distant sounds reached them from the caverns; and-the boats passed to and fro within the harbour. The descent was rugged and dangerous. Ca¬ lantha looked first upon the scene, and then upon Glenarvon : still he leant upon the harp, and seemed to be lost in me» lancholy remembrances. " Sing once again," she said, at length
interrupting him— 44 Ah ! sing as I first heard you : — those notes reached the heart." 44 Did they ?" he cried, approach¬ ing her, as his lips pressed, upon hers, one ardent kiss. The blood rushed from her heart in alarm and agitation :—she trembled and turned from him. " There is no cause," he said, gently following her:— 44 it is the first kiss of love, swçet one ; the last is full of bitterness." 44 Sing to me," she said, confused and terrified, 4t in mercy, approach me not —I am alone—I fear you," I will sing," he said, 44 and check those fears," saying which he began. It w«as not like a song, but a sort of soft low murmur, with an air of such expression and empassioned feeling, that every note said more than words : it vibrated to the soul. « Farewell." Ahl frown not thus—nor turn from me, 1 must not·—dare not—look on thee ; Too well thou know'st how dear thou art, 'Tis hard but yet 'tis best to part : I wish thee not to share my grief, It teekf, it hopes, for no relief.
« Farewell/' Come give thy hand, what though we part, Thy name is fixed, withi» my heart ; I shall not change« nor break the vow I made before and plight thee now ; For since thou may'st not live for me, *Tis sweeter far to die for thee. «' Farewell " Thou'lt think of me when 1 am gone, None shall undo, what I have done ; Yet even thy love 1 would resign To save thee from remorse like mine ; Thy tears shall fall upon my grave : They still may Ыеьь —they cannot save. 44 Sing no more," said Calantha, " let us return home. I know not what I say, or do. Judge not of my feelings by those which predominate in your pre¬ sence. I may be weak,I acknowledge your power, I am lost irretrievably if you are resolved upon it." 44 Calantha", said Lord Glenarvon firmly, 4i you may trust impli¬ citly to my honor.—These are the last guilty words, I will ever suffer to pass my lips. Henceforward consider me only as your friend—as such accept my hand," He smiled in scorn as he said this.

At that moment they were interrupted; a bark from Inis Tara approached the shore, and O'Kelly, Lord Glenarvon's servant, and two other men descended from it. " To avoid observation, I will join my friends one moment," he said, " if you will walk gently home, I can overtake y ou, —but, perhaps you will await my return." " I will go home : it is late," said Calantha. He appeared much vexed ; fii Well then Ι ΛνίΙΙ await your return," saying this Calantha descended with him the rugged path down the cliff, and watched the lessening bark, and heard the distant shouts from some of his fol¬ lowers who were assembled in the cavern, as they hailed his approach to land : after which a long sileuce prevailed, alone in¬ terrupted by the rippling of the waves. The meeting was apparently over: there were whole parties returning from below, in different directions, Whilst yet awaiting Lord Glenarvon's return, Calantha heard the Fame air re- Vol. II. К
peated which he had so lately played. It seemed as if the wind, as it blew along the wooded shores, had struck upon the chords. It ivas strange ; for Glenarvon was gone. She turned in haste, and from above beheld a young man. Ah no—it was St. Clara. Too soon she saw that it was her. Her ear had caught the last murmurs of Glenarvon's song, and her hand feebly repeated the strain. But, soon perceiving Calantha, she gazed with wild alarm one moment upon her, then throw¬ ing the plumed hat aside, with a grace and ease peculiar to herself, shestruck the full chords, and her clear voice «ascended upon the air in soft impassioned numbers. Lady Avondale heard the words of her song as it murmured along the breeze. (To the air of,*' Hear me swear how much I love") By that smile which made me blest, And left K>eeoon the wretch you see- By that xeart 1 once possest, Which now, they say, is given to Ihee-— By St. Clara's wrongs aud woes-- Trubt not young Glenarvon's vows.
By tlioae lays which breathe around A poeťs great and matchless art— By that voice whose silver sound Can soothe to peace lh' imprisoned heart- By every bitter pang I prove— Trust not young Glenarvon's lore. Each brighter, kinder hope forsaking, Bereft of all that made life dear ; * My health impaired, my spirit breaking, Yet still too proud to shed one tear : Ot lady, by my wrongs and woes. Trust not young Glenarvon's vows. " And when at length the hand of death Shall bid St. Claras heart be still- When struggling with her latest breath, His image shall her fancy fill, Ah trust to one whose death shall prove What fale attends Glenarvon's love. Lady Avondale eagerly attempted to appraoch her. " beautiful, unhappy St. Clara, I will be your friend—will protect you. She ran forward, and climbed the steep ascent with ease : but the youthful harper arose—her dark sunny ringlets waving over her flushed cheek aud eyes: she slightly bowed to Calantha as if in k2
derision ; and laughing as she upheld a chain with an emerald ring, bounded over the rocks with an activity, which long habit had rendered familiar. Calantha beheld her no more : but the distant shouts of applause re-echoed as at first among the caverns and mountains ; and the bark with Lord Glenarvon soon re-appeared in sight. She awaited his return. As he approached the beach, a loud murmur of voices from behind the rock continued. He joined her in a mo¬ ment. His countenance was lighted with the ray of enthusiasm :—his altered man¬ ner shewed the success his efforts had obtained. He told Calantha of his pro¬ jects ; he described to her the meetings which he had held by night and clay ; and he spoke with sanguine hope of fu¬ ture success—the freedom of Ireland, and the deathless renown of such as supported her fallen rights. tc Some day you must follow me," he cried : " let me shew you the cavern beneath the rock, where I
have appointed our meeting for the en¬ suing week." " I will walk no more with you to Inis Tara :—the harp sounds mournfully on those high cliffs :—I wish never more to hear it," " Have you seen St. Clara ?" he said, without surprise. " She sings and plays well, does she not ? But she is not dear to me : think not ofher. I could hate her, but that I pity her. Young as she is, she is cruelly hardened and vin¬ dictive."—" I cannot fear her: she is too young and too beautiful to be as aban¬ doned as you ivould make me think."— " It is those who are young and beautiful you should fear most," he said, approach¬ ing her more n early.— u I may fear them," she replied, " but can you teach me to fly them ?" It ivas now late: very little more passed: they returned home, where they were re¬ ceived with considerable coldness. But Lady Mandeville, perce'ving the state of suffering to which Calantha had reduced кЗ
herself, generously came forward to sooth and to assist her. She appeared really attached to her ; and at this time more even than at any former period, shewed her sincere and disinterested friendship. And yet she was the person Mrs. Sey¬ mour distrusted ; and even Glenarvon spoke of her with asperity and disdain. " Adelaide ! though an envious world may forsake thee, a grateful friend shall stand firm by thee to the last." Such were Calan tha's thougths, as Lady Man¬ deville, languidly throwing her rounded arm over her, pressed her to her bosom, and sighed to think of the misery she was preparing for herself.—" Yet, when I see how he loves thee," she continued, " I cannot blame, I will not judge thee/* That evening Glenarvon wrote to Lady Avondale. His letter repeated all he had before said ; it was ardent : it was un¬ guarded. She had scarce received it, scarce placed it in her bosom, when > Lady Margaret attacked her. " You
think," she said, 4i that you have made a conquest. Silly child, Lord Glenarvon is merely playing upon your vanity." Lady Augusta whispered congratulations : Sophia hoped she was pleased with her morning walk ; Sir Everard coldly asked her if she beheld his niece, and theu, ivith a sneer at Lord Glenarvon, said it was vastly pleasant to depend upon cer¬ tain people's promises. All this time Calantha felt not grieved: Glenarvon had said he loved her : it was enough : his attachment was worth all else beside ; and Lord Avondale's in¬ creasing neglect and coldness steeled her heart against the crime of inconstancy. Before supper, Glenarvon took an op¬ portunity of speaking to her. 44 If you accept my friendship," he said frowning*, 44 I must be obeyed :—you will find me a master—a tyrant perhaps ;—not a slave. lf I once love, it is with fervor—with madness. I must have no trifling, no rivals. The being I worship must be к 4
pure even in thought ; and, if I spare her, think not that it is to let others approach her. No, Lady Avondale ; not even what appears most innocent to you, shail be endured by me. I shall be jealous of every look, word, thought. There must be no shaking of hands, no wearing of chains, but such as I bestow, and you must write all you think and feel without reserve or fear. Now, mark me, fly if you have the power ; but if you remain, you already know your fate. Calantha resolved to fly : yes, she felt the necessity. To-morrow, she said, she ivould go. That to-morrow came, and she had not strength. Glenarvon wrote constantly : she replied with the same openness. 4 Your letters chill me," he said, " call me your friend, your lover : call me Glenarvon—Clarence if you will. All these forms, these regula¬ tions are odious amongst those who are attached. Say that you love, beloved Calantha: my oivn hearťs friend, say it;
for I see it, and know it." There is no greater crime in writing it than in feeling it. Calantha said it too soon—too soon she ivrote it. 44 My dearest Clarence, my friend, my comforter:" such were the terms she used. Shame to the pen, the hand that dared to trace them. Days, and days passed, and soon Glenarvon was all on earth to her ; and the love he felt or feigned, the only hope and happiness of her existence.
CHAPTER XXL Loro Avondale now looked more and more coldly on Calantha : but all others courted and flattered her. The Princess and many others had departed. Mrs. Seymour alone appeared to watch her with anxiety. In vain Calantha affected the most thoughtless gaiety : remorse and suspense alternately agitated her mind. One evening she observed Lord Glenar- narvon and her aunt, Mrs. Seymonr, in earnest discourse—she knew not then that she herself was the subject. 44 She is pure, she is innocent," said Mrs. Sey¬ mour : 44 her spirits wild and thoughtless, may have led her into a thousand follies ; but worse, never — never." — 44 Fierce passion burns in her eye," said Glenar¬ von, scornfully: " the colour in her cheeks varies·—I love her as well as you
can," he continued, laughing ; " but do you think she does not love me a little in return ?"—" Oh ï even in jest, do not talk thus of Calantha," said Mrs. Sey¬ mour : " you alarm me."—" There is no occasion," replied Glenarvon : " calm yourself, I only said, that were I to at¬ tempt it I could succeed ; she shouid be ready to leave you, and Lord Avondale, her dear husband and her babes, and her retinue, and all else ; and I could make her follow r me as St. Clara did ; aye verily; but, in truth, I will not." Mrs. Seymour ivas angry ; she coloured ; she was hurt. " You could not," she replied with warmth: ki О I know her well and know you could not. Whatever her faults she is so pure* so chaste even in thought."—" She loves me."—" It is false," said Mrs, Sey¬ mour, still more eagerly. " Even if she had any foolish romantic liking to ano¬ ther than her husband, Buchanan is ihe favourite."—^"Buchanan I" saidLordGle- narvon with a sneer. " 1 will make her heart ache for this," after which he retired*
Calantha knew not then one word of what had passed ; the next morning she was informed by Mrs. Seymour that Lord Glenarvon was gone. " Gone ! where ?" she said rather in surprise, and agitated. " I know not," replied Mrs. Seymour, coldly enough. " I conclude to Belfont : his uncle Lord de Ruthven, is arrived there. But, indeed, I am glad he is gone : —you have not conducted yourself well. I, your aunt, have no doubt of you ; but otheis who know you less, Calantha blame you more." A letter was now delivered to Mrs. Seymour : she opened it : it was from Glenarvon ; she was dreadfully agitated upon reading it. It contained tiiese words : —" As you seem to doubt the confidence and attachment with which your niece, he Countess of Avondale, has honoured me, I enclose you one of her own letters, that you raay see my vanity alone did not authorise mein the conclusion that she was attached to me. Her duplicity to me can scarcely justify the means I take of open
ing an aunt's eyes ; but the peculiar cir¬ cumstances of my situation will, I hope, excuse it. " Your most obedient servant, " Glenarvon." This letter enclosed one of Lady Avon- dale's — one w ? hich, however, she had not blushed to write. She read it with terror when Mrs. Seymour placed it in her hands. Cruel Glenarvon ! could he have the heart thus to betray me—to my own aunt too.—Oh ! had that aunt been less indulgent, less kind, what had been mv fate ? " You are innocent yet, my child," said Mrs. Seymour, placing her arms around her ; " and the early conviction of the meanness and wickedness of him for whom you were preparing to sacrifice so much, will render it easy to reclaim yourself from your present errors, and to be less hasty in reposing confidence hereafter/'—" Never, never, will I pardon
him/* cried Calantha with indignation. " 1 will not hate ; that were too flattering to his vanity : I will not fly; that were a proof that there was cause for it : but, lowered to the dust as 1 ought to feel— humbled to the earth (and whilst she spoke, she looked and felt more proudly, more vainly than ever), even 1 can des¬ pise him/ What are superior talents, if he who possesses them can act thus ? Oh ! 1 had rather die in torture, than ever par¬ don this." " Be less violent," said Mrs. Seymour, with a look of heart-broken tenderness and aifection : " that stubborn spirit must be subdued." — "I will revenge------" " Be calm, Calantha : think what you are saying : how unfeminine and how pue¬ rile ! Put off these frowns and this idle rage, and look reasonably upon your own conduct, not upon his."—" Shall you ever permit him to enter these doors again ?"—" Had 1 the power, assuredly never/'—" Oh, let him return ; î care
not; I can see him with the scorn, with the indifference he deserves. Do not look thus, my dearest aunt: dry your tears: I am not worth one single tear now ; but I will act in future so as to silence even these too just reproaches." 44 Do you repent, Calantha?"— 4i Do not talk of repentance : 1 cannot feel it : my sin is light compared with his."— 44 Towards your husband."— 44 Oh ! Lord Avondale, he is happy enough : he cares not."— 4t Indeed he does, my child. I tremble for you : every hour of your life is a continual warfare and peril. One danger no sooner ends than another arises. Will you never consider the du¬ ties of your situation, or the character yon have to form and to preserve г"*— 44 Who is more loved thau I am? On whom does even the world smile with greater kindness ? Beauties, wits, the vir¬ tuous—can they cope with me ? I am every one's friend, and every one loves, even though they blame Calantha." As
she said this, she smiled and threw her¬ self on her aunt's bosom. But all this Calantha did but to cheer her aunt. Though not false, she dreaded any one*s seeing the real state of her mind: at this moment she thought Mrs. Seymour too gentle, and of tooten¬ der a nature to bear the violence of her headstrong character : she кпелу it would cause her misery ivere she to read her hearťs secret, and she smiled therefore and spoke with levity, луЫЫ her soul was in torture. But the very moment Mrs. Seymour had left her, Calantha gave way to the rage of fury, and the despon¬ dency she felt. To have lost Glenarvon, was at this time the real source of her regret ;—to speculate upon the cause of hig sudden cruelty and treachery her sole occupation. At the hour of dinner Mrs, Seymour again entered her room ; but without a single reproach. She had been crying— her eves were swollen and red; but she
affected scarcely to remember what had passed, and urged Calantha to accompany her to dinner, as her absence on the day of Lord Glenarvon's departure, might appear strange. But Lady Avondale stub¬ bornly refused, and would not speak. She even appeared sullen, that her aunt might not see she was miserable. She even af¬ fected more anger, more violence than she felt against Glenarvon, that she might dis¬ guise from herself and her aunt the pang his loss had given her. She relented how¬ ever when she saw her aunťs grief; and, struggling with tears which never come till passion is over, and which she thought it weak to display, she dressed and ap¬ peared at dinner. It was alone to please Mrs. Seymour she had clone so ; and, solely engrossed with the past, and ut¬ terly indifferent to the mortifying remarks her melancholy and silence occasioned, Calantha hated those who had the unkind¬ ness to censure and judge her, and re¬ garded her own conduct without com¬ punction or condemnation.
Towards evening Lord Avondale came to her, and said kindly enough that she looked ill. Then her heart smote her, and affecting a pettish ill temper, which she did not, could not feel, she replied that she was well, and took up a book, as if to read. May none ever experience the torture Calantha felt, when, instead of being offended, he gently pressed her hand. She had rather he had struck a dagger into her heart. Upon retiring to rest, Lady Avondale sent for Zerbellini, and asked him res¬ pecting Lord Glenarvon. The boy was a constant favourite and playmate of his: he carried notes and flowers, from each to the other; and artless as he was, he already felt delight in the eager interest so much mystery and secrecy required.— He told Lady Avondale a thousand anec¬ dotes of Glenarvon ; but he had told them so often that they failed to please. He then showed her the presents he had re¬ ceived from those who formerly professed fo like her, 44 And did you ever shew
them to Lord Glenarvon?" said Lady Avondale ! The thought occurring that this might have offended. 4C I did," said Zerbellini, with a shrewd smile.—"And was he angry ?"—" Oh, not in the least : only the more kind ; and he did question me so :" and then the boy repeated a thousand things that he had asked, which shewed Calantha too well, how eager he was to «ascertain, from other lips than her's, every minute detail of follies and errors she had committed. There was no need for this. Lady Avondale felt indignant ; for there was not a thought of heart she desired to conceal from him, or alas from any one, W hat she had done wrong, she herself had confessed without reserve; and to be thus distrusted, deeply grieved her. She thought too, it lessened her re¬ gard ; it gave her a worse opinion of Gle¬ narvon ; and this god—this idob to whom she had bowed so low, sunk at once from the throne of glory upon which her ima-
gination had raised him. " If I pardon this," she cried, as she sent Zerbellini away, and hastened to bed,—" if ever I waste a tear, or sigh, or thought, on him, again, may I suffer what I deserve.—But the thing is impossible." Lady Mandeville at this time was all kindness to Lady Avondale. She was going from the castle ; and, as she parted, she gave her this advice : " Never place yourself in the power of any man : love of this sort is apt to terminate in a wreck ; and whoever puts most at stake will be the sufferer." Lady Augusta also de¬ parted.
CHAPTER XXII. î'rom that day, Lady Avondale grew more calm : a degree of offended pride supported her; and she resolved, cost what it might, to continue firm. She saw, that private communications were taking place between Lady Margaret, her father, and even her aunt and Glenar¬ von . He had already contrived to inte¬ rest every individual in the castle in his affairs.—Lord Avondale often spoke of him with praise; Sir Richard, though he said he was a comical personage, ad¬ mired him, and the female part of the society were all eager and enthusiastic on the subject. Lady Avondale experienced every feel¬ ing that can be imagined during this short period ; and received the half con¬ cealed taunts of her acquaintance with
becoming fortitude —eyen their commi¬ seration for his having left her. She heard their boasts too of what he had written to them, without once repining; but envy, rancour, malice, hatred, rage and regret—all, more or less, arose and subsided in her breast, till she heard one morning, with a sort of trepidation, that Lord Glenarvon was in the adjoining room. Mrs. Seymour immediately came to her. " Tell me truly," she said, " have you any objection to his dining here?" " Quite the contrary, said Ca¬ lantha, with indifference; and she waited till she heard the sound of the horses galloping from the outer court; she then looked from the window, and her heart told her too well that she was not vet en I/ tirely recovered from her infatuation." At dinner they were to expect him; and 'till dinner Lady Avondale could think of nothing else. Mrs. Seymour watched her with anxiety.—She strove anxiously to disguise what she felt, and
she succeeded better than before, for habit now rendered the effort less painful. But Lady Margaret whispered malicously in her ear, that every thought and feeling was more strongly exhibited by her, with all her attempts to hide them than by most others, when they wished them to be ьееп. 44 And I know," she added, unkindly enouo-h, 44 you would give any thing· on earth to be friends with him again." 44 With whom?" 44 See he appears," she said, 44 shall I name him ?" Lady Avondale had resolved to be firm. There is a degree of dignity, ivhich every proud mind can assume. To have for¬ given so much treachery and cruelty, had been contemptible. She felt it, and pre¬ pared for the encounter. 4C He will do every thing to regain you," said Mrs. Seymour, 4t but I have confidence in your present feelings. Shew him, that you are not what he i magines; and prove to me, that I may still be proud of my
child." Lady Avondale had taken Gle¬ narvon's ring from her finger, she had placed upon her neck a row of pearls her husband had given her, upon the eve of her marriage, and thus decorated, she thought her heart had likewise re¬ turned to its ancient allegiance. Lady Avondale entered the dining- room. Lord Glenarvon passed her at the moment; he was in earnest conver¬ sation with Lady Margaret, and slightly bowed to her. She was surprised, she had expected kindness and contrition. She was, hoivever, resolved to act up to the very strictest bounds which decorum prescribed. With some haughtiness, some appearance at least of dignity, she seated herself as far from him as he could desire, and by «addressing herself calmly hut entirely to others, she sought to attain that look of unconcern, which he had so readily «assumed. Dinner was no sooner over than una- Ые any longer to conceal her vexation,
Lady Avondale retired to her room to compose herself. Upon returning, the large society were employed either with billiards, cards, or work—except a few of the men, amongst whom she perceived Lord Glenarvon. Had he refrained from speaking to her, she could have borne it,—had he even looked as grave, as ill as usual ; but an unusual flow of spirits—a peculiar appearance of health» had taken place of that languor, to which he was at times subject. The evening and the supper passed without his saying one word in apology for his unkindness, or in the least at¬ tending to her increasing irritatio». Lady Avondale affected unconcern as well as she could, but it looked like any thing else; and in the morning she awoke but to suffer new humiliations. She saw him smile as he named her in a whisper to Lady Trelaw uey. She heard him tdk to others upon subjects he had once spoken of only to herself· Imme- Vol. IL ï
diately upon this apparent rupture, new hopes arose; new claims were consi¬ dered ; and that competition for his fa¬ vour, which had ceased, began again. Lady Trelawney laughed and talked with him ; at times turning her eye trium¬ phantly towards Calantha. Sophia con¬ fided her opinions to his breast ; affected to praise him for his present conduct, and the tear of agon}, which fell from Calantha's e}e, excited at least as much indignation as it deserved. 44 I have sacrificed too much for one who is heartless," she said; 44 but, thank Heaven, it is yet time for amendment." Alas! Lady Avondale knew not, as she uttered these words, that there İs no mo¬ ment in which it is so difficult to act with becoming dignity and firmness, as that in which we are piqued and trampled upon by the object of our devotion. Gle¬ narvon well knew this, and smiled at the pang he inflicted, as it proved his power, and exhibited its effects to all. Lady
Avondale summoned to her aid even her feults— the spirit, the pride of her charac¬ ter, her very vanity; and rested her hopes of firmness upon her contempt for weakness, her abhorrence of vice. She looked upon him, and saw his attempts to wound, to humiliate, to grieve; and she despised the man who could have re» course to every petty art to torture one for whom he had professed so much. If he wished to expose her weakness to every eye, toq well he had succeeded.
«L α
CHAPTER XXIII. Few women know how to conceal suc¬ cessful love, but none can conceal their doubt, resentment and jealousy. Men can do both, and both without a struggle. They feel less, and fear more. But this was not the case with Lord Glenarvon, nor did he wish to appear indifferent; he only wished Calantha to feel his power, and he delighted in the exhibi¬ tion of it. In vain she had formed the best resolutions, they were now all ren¬ dered useless. Lord Glenarvon had fore¬ stalled her wise intention, no coldness »—no indifference she could assume, had equalled that, which he either af¬ fected or felt. Upon the bosom of Mrs. Seymour, Calantha wept for her fault; it was infa¬ tuation, she said, she was cured; the
lesson, though somewhat harsh, had not been fruitless. Again, she made every promise, which affection and repentance could suggest. She heard the name of her husband pronounced, and longed to throw herself before him, and commend herself to his mercy. I do repent, in¬ deed I do, said Calantha, repeatedly in the course of the day ; and she thought her penitence had been sincere. Hum¬ bled now, and gentle, she thought only of pleasing her aunt, Lord Avondale, and her friends. She was desired to play during the evening : to shew her ready obedience she immediately obeyed. Lord Glenarvon w as in an adjoining room ; he entered when she began : springing up, Lady Avondale left the harp ; then, seeing Lord Avondale surprised, she pre¬ pared to tune it. Lord Glenarvon approached and of¬ fered her his hand, she refused it. "Will you play ?*' he said—and she turned the key with so much force that it broke the l3
chords «asunder. 44 You have wound them too tight, and played upon them too often," he said. 44 Trifle not with me thus—1 cannot play now," she re¬ plied. 44 Leave me, I entreat you." 44 You know not what you have done," he replied. 4i All I ask—all I imploreis, that you will neither come near me, nor speak to me more, for I am mad." 44 Women always recover from these pa¬ roxysms," said he, gaily. Calantha at¬ tempted to play, and did so extremely ill, after which she went to bed, happier, it must be owned, for she had seen in Lord Glenarvon's manner that he was not in¬ different, and this rendered it more easy for her to appear so. The next morning Lady Avondale went out immediately after breakfast, without speaki ng to Lord Glenarvon. He twice attempted it, but with real anger, she refused to hear him. It w«as late in the day, when, having sought for her before dinner, he at length found her
alone. His voice faultered , his eyes were filled with tears. " Ladv Avondale— Calantha/* he said, approaching her, " forgive me.—I ask it of you, and more, if you require it, I will kneel—will sue for it. You can make me ivhat you please—I am wholly in your power/ " There is no need for this," she said coldly. " I will not rise till you forgive me. If you knew all—if...... but can you indeed believe me indifferent, or cold ? Look at me once : raise your eyes and be¬ hold him, ivho lives but in you." "All this is useless, you have grieved me ; but I do not mean to reproach ; the idle com¬ plainings of a woman are ever useless/* " To think that she suffers," said Gle¬ narvon, " is enough. Look once—once only, look upon me." " Let us part in peace," she replied : " 1 have no com¬ plaint to make, I have nothing to for¬ give." " Raise your eyes, and look—Ca¬ lantha, look once on me." l4
She turned to him, she saw that face whose every feature was engraved deep in her very heart—that smile of sweet¬ ness—that calm sereniti, she bad not power to speak—to think ; and yet reco¬ vering from this strange enchiintment, •—" How could you betray me ?" she said. I judge you not, but I can never feel either interest, or friendship again." " Yet," said Glenarvon gravely, " I need both at this time, for 1 am miserable and ill too, only I do not wish to ex¬ cite your compassion by these arts, and I had rather die unforgiven, than use any towards you." " Wherefore did you betray me ?'* "' Can you ask? I was deeply wounded. It is not enough for me that you love me, all must and shall know it. I will make every sacrifice for you—run every risk : but every risk and everv sacrifice must be shared," " Whatever my feel¬ ings may be," she answered coldly, " you shall never subdue me agaic. I may be
infetuated, but I will never be criminal—. You may torture me as you please, if you have the power over me whidi you ima¬ gine, but I can bear torture, and none ever vet subdued me." 44 Calantha," said Lord Glenarvon, taking her hand firmly, and smiling half scornfully, 44 you sliall be my slave. I will mould 30u as I like ; teach you to think but with my thoughts, to act but with my feelings, you shall ivait nor mur¬ mur—suffer, nor dare complain—ask, and be rejected—and all this, I will do, and you know it, for your heart is alrea¬ dy mine." 4t If I forgive you," she cried. 44 If you do not," he said, approaching nearer. " I never ivill." 4i And 'till you do, tliough your whole family should enter, I will kneel here—here, even at your feet." 4t You think to menace me." 44 I know my empire. Take off those ornaments: replace what I have given you: this too you shall wear," he said, throwing a chain around her. l5
44 Turn from me if you can : the heart that I have w r on, you cannot reclaim; and though the hand be thus denied me, if the heart be mine of what avail ? I love you to madness, he said, and you distract me. Trust j'ourself entirely to me, it is the only means of safety left. Yes, Calantha, I will do for you, what no man ever did before. If it destroy me, I will never lead you to guilt, only rely upon me, be guided by me." 44 You ran the risk," she said, 44 of our being separated for ever, of making my aunt miserable. Of------." "Nonsense, child, I never risk any thing, it was necessarç' your aunt should know ; and the fear of losing you entirely will make her readily consent to my seeing you more than ever." 44 Oh Glenarvon, what guilt! Think not that my attachment is such as to bear it." 44 lt shall bear all things," said Glenarvon ; <4 but if you sacrifice what I desire, I will conquer every wrong feeling for your sake. Our friendship will then be innocent." " Not
absolutely......indeed I fear it ; and if: -------„." « Ah! leave these gloomy thoughts. If love should triumph—if you feel half for me, what 1 feel from my soul for you, then you shall accom¬ pany me from hence. Avondale may ea¬ silv find another wife, but the world contains for me but one Calantha." Lady Avondale felt happy.—Shame on the guilty heart that dared to feel so ! but alas, whilst Glenarvon thus addressed her, she did feel most happy. In a mo¬ ment, the gloom that had overshadowed her future hopes, was dispelled. She saw her lover—her friend, more than ever united to her. He consented even to respect what remaining virtue she had left, and from his gentle, his courteous words, it was not her wish to escape. Yet still she resolved to leave him. Now, that peace was again restored, that her irritated mind was calm, that her va¬ nity was flattered, and her pride satisfied, now the admonitions of her aunt recur-
ed ; and even while her heart beat fondest for him, she pronounced her own doom, and declared to him that she would tear herself awav from him for ever. " Per- haps this must be," he said, after a mo¬ menťs pause; "but not yet, Calantha: ah ! not yet." As he spoke his tears fell upon her hand.—Oh! had he not thus wept, Calantha had not loved him. Struggling with his feelings for her, he generously resolved to save, to spare her. " Remember this," he said, " when they condemn me—remember, Calantha, what I have done for you ; how I have respected you; and let not their idle clamours prevail." Lady Avondale was too happy to feel vain. Glenarvon loved, as she never had been loved before, every hour— every moment of each passing day he seemed alone intent, and occupied with her; he wrote his minutest thoughts; he counselled, he did not command. He, saw that power, ambition, was her
ruling passion, and by affecting to be ruled, he completely mastered her—in word, in look, in thought, he was de¬ voted to her. Other men think only of themselves; Glenarvon conquered him¬ self a thousand times for her. What is a momentary, a degrading passion to the enjoyment she felt in his society? It only loivers the object of its fancy, he sought to raise her eveu in her олуп es¬ teem. " Forgive her, pity us," he said, addressing Mrs. Seymour, w ho валу in a moment, ivith alarm, their reconcilia¬ tion, " Drive us not to despair, I yvill respect her—will preserve her, if you do not attempt to tear her from me ; but dread the violence of madness, if you reduce us to the last rash step. Oh dread the violence of a mad and incurable at¬ tachment. Calantha's sole attention was полу to hide from those it might grieve, the change which a few days had again wrought. She appeared at dinner, she
seated herself opposite to Glenarvon. There was no look of exultation in his countenance, his eyes met her's mourn¬ fully. The diamond bracelets that adorn¬ ed her arms, had been given her by him ; the chai n and locket, which contained his dark hair, had been placed around her neck in token of his regard ; the clasp that fastened the band around her waist, was composed of the richest jewels brought by him from distant countries ; and the heart that was thus girt round and en¬ circled with his gifts, beat only for him, regardless of every other tie. 44 Oh my child î my child!" said Mrs. Seymour, gazing on her in agony. 4i I will never reproach you, but do not break my heart. You are ill in mind and health, you know not what you say or do ; God forgive and pardon you, my unhappy Ca¬ lantha?" "Bear with me afew moment's," said Lady Avondale much agitated : 44 I will part from him ; only give me time. Fear me not : I will neither leave you nor
act wickedly ; but if you seek too hastily to sever us, oh my aunt, you may be the means of driving two desperate minds to misery and madness." It may appear strange, but all this time the world and friends appeared more fond of Calantha than at any other: they courted, they flattered her—they no longer feigned that Glenarvon was insincere— and they seemed to gaze with new intent, new admiration upon the object of his attention.—Never was she apparently so beioved, so sought after—in particular by the Princess of Madagascar, her party and her followers.
CHAPTER XXIV. A few days previous to this quarrel and reconciliation, Sir Everard St. Clare had been thrown from his horse in conse¬ quence of a tumult, in which, having beheld his niece, a dimness came over his eyes, and he was no longer able to support himself. The fall, it was feared, had injured his spine. He was confined to his own room ; but no one could pre¬ vail upon him to lie upon his bed, or admit Lady St. Clare, who sat continually sobbing at his door, lamenting her con¬ duct and imploring his pardon. Whatever were the sufferings of Lady Avondale's mind at this time, she yet re¬ solved to visit this afflicted family, as she had a real regard for the doctor in spite of his singularities. She was preparing therefore the ensuing day, to call upon
him, when a servant informed her that a young gentleman below desired to speak with her. Her heart beat upon hearing the name Clarence of Costolly : but upon entering the room she soon dis¬ covered, in the personage before her, the doctor's unhappy niece, Elinor, upon whom every counsel was lost^—every menace and punishment powerless. Elinor had entered the castle with a look of bold defiance ; yet her lips trem¬ bled, as she twice vainly attempted to ad¬ dress Ladv Avondale, who moved for- ward to enquire the cause of her visit. " I am come," said Miss St. Clare with haughty insolence, " to ask a favour of you—tell me shall it be granted? My un¬ cle is ill: he has sent to see me. This may be a mere feint to draw me into his power. I will trust myself with no one but you:—if you will engage for me, that I shall not be detained, 1 will go to him ; if not, come what will, I will never more set foot into his house." " Your
having listened to the prayers of Sir Eve¬ rard/* answered Lady Avondale eagerly, " isa proof to me that you have a kind heart, and you are so young, that 1 feel sure, oh most sure, that vou will return to a more virtuous course." " To virtue !" said Elinor with a smile of scorn, " never —never." As she spoke, a letter dropped from her bosom. Lady Avondale saw from the superscription—the name of Glenar¬ von. Her heart sicken d at the sight; she tried to conceal her emotion ; but she had not yet learned sufficiently how to dissemble. Elinor, with ill suppressed rage, watched Lady Avondale: she could scarcely stand the fury of her glance, when in a voice, nearly choked with p.as- sion, u Take it," she said, throwing the letter to her. " Yes, you shall give it him —give it to your lover. I would have hated you, I would have injured you; but I cannot. No wonder he admires you : 1 could myself; but I am misera-
ble." Lady Avondale raised her eyes : every fierce expression had left Eli¬ nor's countenance: with a subdued and mournful air, she turned aside as İf ashamed of the w eakness she had shewn ; then, taking a little miniature and chain from her neck, "He sent for this too," she cried. " He sent for all he gave me, to offer to his new idol. Take it then, Lady ; and tell him, I obeyed his last command." A tear dimmed her eye foramoment ; but recovering herself, " He h-as not power," she cried, " to break a heart like mine. 'Tis such as you, may die for love—I have yet many years to live." Lady Avondale sprang forward to return the picture— the letter ; but St. Clare, with a preci¬ pitancy she was not prepared for, had left her; Lady Avondale arrived at the door of the Castle only in time to see her gallop off. While she was yet holding the letter and picture in her hand, Glenarvon wm
announced. He looked at both without exhibiting any symptom of surprise, and having read the letter, shewed it to Ca¬ lantha. It greatly shocked her. 4ς I am so used," he said smiling, u to these scenes, that they have lost all power with me." 44 Unhappy Elinor," said Lady Avondale. u In good truth," said Glenar¬ von," 3 ou may spare your pi Cy, Calantha : the lady has spirit enough : it is her lover who ought to claim compassion. Now do not frown, or reproach, or torment me about her. I know it was wrong first to take her with me—it was wrong to see her since ; but never more, you may rely upon it, shall I transgress ; and if you knew all, you would not blame me. She absolutely forced herself upon me. She sat at my door, and wept ivhen I urged her to return home. What could I do ? I might have resisted.— Calantha, when passion is burning in every vein—when opportunity is kind »—and when those who from the modesty
of their sex ought to stand above us and force us from them, forget their dignity and sue and follow us, it is not in man's nature to resist. Is it in woman's?" he Continued smiling archly. " I blame you not," she replied; " but 1 pity her. Yet wherefore not shew her some little kindness?" "A look, a word would bring her back to me. She mis¬ represents every thing : she deceives herself." " Love is ever apt to do so/* " Oh ! my adored Calantha, look not thus on me. You are not like this wretched girl : there is nothing femi¬ nine, or soft, or attractive in her ; in you there is every charm." " You loved her once ?" said Calantha. " It was pas¬ sion, phrenzy, it was not love—not what I feel for my Calantha." " As you re¬ gard me, be kind to her." " I was very kind once, was I not ?" " Oh not in that manner—not so." " How then, my soul ? explain yourself; you shall instruct me." " Counsel her to repent." " From the
lips that first taught her to err, how will such counsel prevail ?" " Why take your picture from her ?" " To give it to the only friend I have left." " I shall send it her again." " She wili only laugh at you." " í had rather be the cause of her laughter, than ofher tears." " Fear not : she is not prone to weeping ; but perhaps," he con¬ tinued in a tone of pique, " you would wish to give me back also, as well as the portrait." " Oh never—never." This was Lady Avondale's answer ; and Lord Glenarvon was satisfied.
CHAPTER XXV.
Lauy Avondale sent the portrait to Miss St. Clare, and vainly endeavoured to restore her to her uncle's protection. She again spoke ofher to Glenarvon. " Cannot I yet save her ?" she said ; " Cannot I take her home, and sooth her mind, and bring her back to virtue and to peace ?" " Never more," he re¬ plied : " it is past : her heart is perverted." " Is there no recall from such perver¬ sion ?" " None, none, my friend." His countenance, whilst he spoke, assumed much of bitterness. " Oh there is no re¬ call from guilty love. The very nature of it precludes amendment, as these beautiful, these emphatic lines express, written by the Scottish bard, who had felt their truth :
' The sacred lowe oVeel-plac'd love, Luxuriantly indulge ¡tţ But never tempt th'illicit rove, Tho' naething should divulge it : I wave the quantum o* the sin, The hazard of concealing; But och ! it hardens a* within, And petrifies the feeling/ " " Is it indeed so ! Alas ! then, what will become of me ?" " Calantha, your destiny isfixed," he cried, suddenly start¬ ing as if from deep thought ; " there is a gulph before you, into which you are preparing to plunge. I would have saved you — 1 tried ; but cannot. You know not how to save yourself. Do }ou think a momentary pause, a trifling turn, will prevent the fall ? Will you now fly me ? now that you are bound to me, and the fearful forfeiture is paid ? Oh turn not thus away :—-look back at the journey you have taken from innocence «and peace : and fear to tread the up-hill path
of repentance and reformation aloue. Remember when a word or look were regarded by you as a crime—how you shuddered at the bare idea of guilt. Now you can hear its language w ith interest : it has lost its horror : Ah soon it shall be tlie only language your heart will under¬ stand. Shrink not, start not. Calantha ; the road you pursue is that which I have followed. See and acknowledire then, the power I hold oier your heart ; and yield to what is already destined. You imagine, when I speak of guilt, that 30u can shrink from me, that iou can hate me ; but 30U have lost the power, and let me add, the right; 30u are become a sharer iu that iniquity—iou must bea sharer in my fate. The actual commis¬ sion of crime still excites horror ; but do you remember when you shuddered at every approach to it ? And cannot hr who has triumphed thus far gain all, think von, if it were his desire ? Ye** jou arc mine—a being wholly jtImiir Vol. II. M

Do not, ei en wen» I to consent, О ! do not lead mc to wrong. M hat shall ever remune¬ rate us for the loss of self-approbation ? He smiled bitterly. ·* It is, ? * he said, % *a possession, 1 never yet cared great h to retain." "And is self-approbation the greatest of all earthly eujo\ mcitfe ? Is man so independent, >o solitari a being, that the consciousness of ritţht w ili suffice to him, when all around brand him with iniquity, and suspect hirn of guilt " He paused, and laughed. fc * Let us be that whieh we are thought," he cried, in a more animated tone. ** The vorst ıs thought ; aud that worst we will become. Let us live on earth but for each other another coun tri will hide us front the ecu-
sure« oť tíie prejudiced ; and our very dependence upon each other, will endear us more and more." Calantha with¬ drew her hand—she looked upon him w ith fear ; but she loved, and she forgot her alarm.

CHAPTER XXIV. Strange as it may appear, a husband, unless his eyes are opened by the confes¬ sion of his guilty partner, is the last to believe in her misconduct ; and when the world has justly stamped disgrace upon her name, he shares in his wife's disho¬ nour, for he is supposed by all to know, and to connive at her crime. But though this be a painful truth, experience every day confirms, that a noble and confiding husband is too often, and too easily de¬ ceived. In the marriage state there is little love and much habitual confidence. We see neglect and severity on the part of the man ; and all the petty arts and cunning ivi les on the side of his more frail and cowardly partner. Indifference first occasions this blindness; infatuation increases it; and in proportion as all in-
terest is lost for the object ivho so de¬ ceives, such husband lives the dupe of the wife, who despises him for his blind¬ ness, and dies in the same happy illusion, in which he has so long passed away his life. He even presses to his heart, as he leaves them his possessions, the children of some deceitful friend, who, under the mask of amity to himself, has fed upon his fortunes, and seduced the affections of his wife. Disgusting as such picture may be thought, is it not, unhappily for us, daily- exhibited to the public view ? and shall they ivho tolerate and sec it, and smile in scorn at its continued and increasing success, affect to start with horror from Calantha's tale ? or to discredit that Avon- dale was yet ignorant of her guilt ? He was besides ofttimes engaged with the du¬ ties of his profession—nor thought that whilst risking his life in the service of his country, the woman he loved and confided in, had betrayed him. How different m 3
was he in mind, in person, and heart from other men ! His very nobleness of soul prevented him from conceiving what some perhaps had soon observed, and wounded pride estranged him from a woman who now appeared avowedly to shun his societv. His cheeks were red svitli the hue of health ; his eyes shone bright ivith spark¬ ling intelligence ; he laughed the loud heart's laugh at every merry jest, and slept with unbroken slumbers, the sleep of the righteous and the just. Calantha looked upon him as we look afar off upon some distant scene were we once dwelt, and from which we have long departed. It awakens in our memory former pains and pleasures ; but we turn from it with bitterness ; for the sight is distressing to us. Harry Mowbrey loved his father and folloived him ; the baby Anabel held out her arms to him when he passed ; but Calantha assumed a stern coldness in his
presence, and replied to his few enquiries ivith all the apparent insensibility of a proud and offended mind : yet such is the imperfection of human nature, that it is possible Lord Avondale cherished her the more for her very faults. Certain it is, that he felt proud of her, and every casual praise which, even from the lips of strangers, ivas bestowed on Calan¬ tha, gave him more delight than any pro¬ fession, however flattering, that could have been made to himself. To see her i»lest was his sole desire ; and when he observed the change in her manner and spirits, it grieved, it tortured him :—he sought, but in vain, to remove it. At length business of importance called him from her. " Write," he said, at parting, " write, as you once used. My presence has given but little satisfaction to you ; I dare not hope my absence will create pain/' u Farewell," said Lady Avondale, with as¬ sumed coldness. " There are false hearts in this world, and crimes are enacted, if 4
íleury, at home ofttimes, as well as abroad. Confide in no one. Believe not w hat your own eyes perceive. Life is but ач the shadow of a dream. All here is illusion. We knovv not whom we love." flow happy some may imagine—how happy Calantha must have felt now that Lord Avondale w as gone. Far from it. She, for the first time, «saw her conduct in its true light. His departure filled her with gloom : every little act of kind¬ ness he had once shewed her recurred ; all his manly virtues : his open unsuspi¬ cious nature :—it was as if her last hope of safety were cut oft' ; as if her good an¬ gel had for ever abandoned her ; and with a reserve and prudence, which in his presence, she had failed to assume, she now turned with momentary horror from the near approach of crime. The thought of leaving her home and Lord Avondale, had not indeed ever seriously occurred, although she constantly listened to the proposal of doing so, and acted in
a way to render such step necessary. She had seen Lord Avondale satisfied, and whilst Lord Glenarvon was near her, only momentary fits of remorse obtruded —no lasting fear occurred—she formed no view for the future. To die with him, or to live but for that moment of time, ivhich seemed to concentrate every pos¬ sible degree of happiness, this was the only desire of which she had felt capable. Bu* now, she shuddered—she paused : —the baseness of betraying a noble, confiding husband, struck her mind, «and filled it with alarm ; but such alarm ap¬ peared only to accelerate her doom. " If I can resist and remain without deeper guilt, I will continue here," she cried ; " and if I fail in the struggle, I will fly with Glenarvon."—This false reasoning consoled her. A calm, more dangerous than the preceding agitation, followed this resolve. Glenarvon had changed entirely in his manner, in his character ; all art, all
attempt at wounding or tormenting was passed. He seemed himself the sufferer, and Calantha, the being upon whose at tachment he relied, he was as fearful of vexing her, as she was of losing him. On earth he appeared to have no thought but her ; and when again and again he repeated, α I never loved as I do now,— oh never." It may be doubted whether that heart exists which could have dis¬ believed him. Others who affect only, are ever thoughtful for themselves ; and some plan, some wa^ and prudential contrivance frequently appears, even in the very height of their passion. The enjoyment of the moment alone, and not the future continuance of attachment, employs their hopes. But Glenarvon seemed more anxious to win every affec¬ tion of her heart ; to fix every hope of her soul upon himself; to study every feeling as it arose, sift every motive, and secure his empire upon all that was most durable, than to win her in the usual
acceptation of the word. And even thougli jealous that she should be ready to sacrifice every priuči pie of honour aud virtue, sliould he demand it, he had a pride in saving her from that guilt into which she was now voluntarily preparing to plunge. Day by day, the thought of leaving all for him appeared more necessary and certain.—She no longer shuddered at the mention of it. She heard him de¬ scribe their future life — the countries they should visit; and it even pleased her to see that he was sincere in his intentions. No disguise was now re¬ quired : he called not the fire that burnt in his heart by the name of friendship and of interest : 4i it is love," he cried, 44 —most guilty—most unconquerable. Hear it, mark it, and yet remain without alarm. Ah ! think not that to share it alone is required; your soul must exult, that it has renounced every hope beyond ; and Glenarvon's love must
entirely fill your affections. Nay more, you shall sue for the sacrifice which is demanded of others. Yourself shall w ish it ; for 1 will never wrest from you that which, unless freely given, is little worth. Perhaps, even when you desire tobe mine. I, even I shall spare you, till maddening with the fierce fires that de¬ vour us, you abandon all for me." He now opened to her the dark re¬ cesses of his heart ; deeds of guilt con¬ cealed from other eyes, he now dwelt upon to Calantha with horrid pleasure. ςί Shrink not ! start not!" he exclaimed, when she trembled at each new confes¬ sion. " Proud, even of my crimes, shalt thou become, poor victim of thy mad infatuation ; this is the man for whom thou leavest Avondale ! Mark me, Ca¬ lantha,—view me as I am, nor say here¬ after that Glenarvon could deceive." * c And do you never feel remorse ?" she feaid.—" Never." " Do you believe ?—"
His countenance for one moment altered. " I know not," he said, and he was grave. " Oh must I become as hardened as wicked," she sakl, bursting into tears. He pressed her mournfully te his bosom. " Weep," he replied, " I like to see your tears ; they are the last tears of expiring virtue. Henceforward you will shed no more." Those who have given way to the vio¬ lence of any uncontrouled passion know that during its influence, all other consi¬ derations vanish. It is of little use to upbraid or admonish the victim who pursues his course: the fires that urge him on to his ruin, prevent his return. A kind word, an endearing smile, may excite one contrite tear; but he ne¬ ver pauses to reflect, or turns his eyes from the object oí his pursuit. In vain the cold looks of an offended world, the heavy censures, and the pointed,
bitter sarcasms of friends and depen¬ dants. Misfortunes, poverty, pain, even to the rack, are nothing if he obtain his view. It is a madness that falls upon the brain and heart. All is at stake for that one throw; and he who dares all, is desperate, and cannot fear. It was phrenzy, not love, that raged in Calan¬ tha's bosom. To the prayers of a heart-broken pa¬ rent, Lady Avondale opposed the ago¬ nizing threats of a distempered mind. " I will leave 30u all, if you take him from me. On earth there is nothing left me but Glenarvon.—Oh name not virtue and religion to me.—What are its hopes, its promises, if I lose him." The fever of her mind was such, that she could not for one hour rest: he saw the dreadful power he had gained, and he lost no opportunity of encreasing it. Ah did he share it? In language the sweetest,
and the most persuasive, he worked upon her passions, till he inflamed them be¬ yond endurance. " This, this is sin," he cried, as he held her to his bosom, and breathed voivs of ardent burning' love. " This is what moralists rail at, and account degrading. Now tell them, Calantha, thou who didst affect to be so pure—so chaste, whether the human heart can resist it? Religion bids thee fly me," he cried: " every hope of heaven and hereafter warns thee from my bosom, Glenarvon is the hell thou art to shun:—this is the hour of trial. Christians must resist. Calantha arise, aud fly me; leave me alone, as before I found thee. Desert me, and thy father and relations shall bless thee for the sa¬ crifice: and thy God, who redeemed thee, shall mark thee for his own " With bitter taunts he smiled as he thus spoke: All day,—every hour in the day,— every instant of passing time Glenarvon
thought but of Calantha. When near him, she felt ecstacy; but if separated, though for one moment, she was sul¬ len and desponding. He felt, he saw, that the peace of her mind, was gone for ever, and he rejoiced in the thought.
CHAPTER XXVÍ. One night, as she retired to her room, Gondimar met her in the passage, leading from Mrs. Seymour's apartment. 4i Lost woman," he cried, fiercely seizing her, 44 you knoiv not what you love;—look to his hand, there is blood on it! .... That night ivas a horrid nigbt to Calantha ; she slept, and the dream tliat oppressed her, left her feeble and disordered. The ensuing day she walked by the shores of the sea: she bared her forehead to the balmy gales. She looked upon every cheerful countenance in hopes of im¬ bibing happiness from the smile that brightened theirs, but it ivas vain. Upon returning, she met Glenarvon. They walked together to the mountains : they conversed ; and half in jest she asked him for his hand,— 4< not that hand,"
she said, " give me your right hand ; I wish to look upon it." " I believe I must refuse you, your manner is so strange/' he replied. " Do if you please, for the reason I wish to see it is more so. lt was a dream, a horrid dream, which made me ill last night. The effect, perhaps of what you told me yesterday." 44 I should like to hear it. Are you superstitious?" " No; but there are visions unlike all others, that impress us deeply, and this was one. I almost fear to tell it you." " 1 too have dreamt," he said, " shall I repeat my dream ?" " Not now, I am too sad for it : but mine, if indeed you wish it, you may hear." " I dreamt (but it is absurd to repeat it) that I was in some far distant countiy. I was standing by the sea, and the fresh air blew gently upon me, even as it does now;....it was night. There was a dirge sung as in monasteries, and friars passed to and fro, in long procession before me. Their torches now and then
lighted the vaults, and the chaunt was mournful, and repeatedly interrupted-^* all this was confused,—That which was more striking, I remember better. A monk in black stood before me ; and whilst he gazed upon me, he grew to a height unusual and monstrous : he seemed to possess some authority over me, and he questioned me as to my conduct and affections. I tried to dis¬ guise from him many thoughts whicli disturbed me ; I spoke in a hurried manner of others; 1 named you not. He shook his head ; aud then looking fiercely at me, bade me beware of Clarence de Ruth ven (for so he called you). I never can forget his voice. " All others you may see, you may converse with ; but, Calantha, beware," he said, " of Clarence de Ruthven : he is a.... he isa...." " A what?" enquired Glenarvon eagerly. " I dare not continue." Glenarvon, however, insisted upon hearing this. " I never, never can tell,"
said Calantha, for you look so much offended—so serious. After all, луЬа1 nonsense it is thus to repeat a dream." " That which seems to have made no little impression upon Lady Avondale's mind, cannot fail of awakening some interest in mine. It is a very strange vision," he continued, fixing his eyes on her. tc These idle phantasies are but repetitions of the secret working's of the mind. Your own suspicions have coloured this. Go on, let me hear all/* " Indeed I forget ;—it ivas confused. I seemed in mv dream to doubt his луоЫв. Only this I remember:—he bade me ask you for your hand—your right hand ; he said there was a stain of blood on it ; and in a low solemn tone, he added, ς he will not give it you ; there is a mark upon it ; he dare not give it you / and 1 алуоке." " To think me every thing, hoivever bad, that your monk may chuse to make me out. Well foolish dreamer, look at
my hand: say, is there a mark on it?" The laugh which accompanied this ques¬ tion was forced. Calantha started back, as she observed that almost demoniac smile. His eyes glared upon her with fierce malignity ; his livid cheeks became pale ; and over his forehead, an air of deep distress struggled with the violence of passion, till all again was calm, cold, and solemn, as before. She was sur¬ prised at his manner; for although he made light of it, he was certainly dis¬ pleased, and much moved by this foolish occurrence. Glenarvon continued absent and irri¬ table during the whole of the walk ; nor ceased enquiring oftentimes that day res¬ pecting what she had said. It appeared to her less extraordinary, when she re¬ membered the circumstances concerning Linden : yet he had so often acknow¬ ledged that event to her,—so often spoke of him with pity and regret, that had he merely thought she alluded to such
transaction, he had been proud of the effort he had made to save him, and of the blood he had shed upon that account. Whatever then occasioned this strange perturbation ;—however far imagination might wander, even though it pictured crimes unutterable,—under Glenarvon's form, all might be forgiven. Passion, perhaps, had misled its victim, and who can condemn another when maddening under its trying influence ! It was not for Calantha to judge him. It was her misfortune to feel everything with such acute and morbid sensibility, that what in others had occasioned a mere moment of irritation, shook every fibre around her heart. The death of a bird, ifit had once been dear, made her miserable ; and the slightest insult, as she termed it, rendered her furious. Severity but caused a desperate resistance, and kindness alone softened or subdued her. Glenarvon played upon every passion to the utmost ; and when he beheld her, lost beyond all recall he seemed to love her most.
How vain it were to attempt to paint the struggles, the pangs, the doubts, the fears, the endless unceasing irritation of a mind disordered by guilty love. Remorse had but little part now : passion soon absorbed every feeling, every hope ; and to retain Glenarvon was there anything his weak and erring victim had refused ? Alas ! the hour came, when even to leave all and follow him appeared incumbent. The very ruin such conduct must occasion to Calantha, engaged her more eagerly to agree to the proposal. Lady Margaret was now, at times, en¬ gaged with him in secret discourses,which occasioned much apparent dissention be¬ tween them; but Calantha was not the subject. " He has the heart of a fiend," Lady Margaret would often exclaim, as she left him ; and Calantha could per¬ ceive that, with all her power ot dissimu¬ lation ; she was more moved—more irri¬ tated by him, than she ever tmd been before by any other. He also spoke of
Lady Margaret with bitterness, and the asperity between them grew to such height, that Calantha apprehended the most fatal effects from it. Still, however, the D'Jike wished to conciliate a danger¬ ous and malignant foe ; and though his visits to the Castle were short, compared with what they had been, they were as frequent as ever.
CHAPTER XXVIII. It happened one morning that Calantha, having been walking with Lord Gle¬ narvon, upon her return entered the library rather unexpected^, and per¬ ceived Zerbellini with the Count Gondi¬ mar and Lady Margaret. They all seemed in some confusion at her entrance. She was however too deeply occupied with other thoughts to enquire into their strange embarrassment ; and looking at Glenarvon, she watched the varying ex¬ pression of his countenance with anxious solicitude. At dinner, that day, he seated himself near her. Mrs. Seymour's e} r es were filled with tears. 44 It is too late," he said, in a low ivhisper : 44 be firm : it makes me mad to see the arts that are used to separate us. Speak only to me¬ think only of me. What avail their frowns ? Vol, II. N
their reproaches? Iam dearer, aminőt than aH?" Dinner being over, Calantha avoided her aunt's presence. She perceived it, and approaching her, " My child," she said, " do not fly me. My unhappy Ca¬ lantha you will break my heart if you act thus." At that moment Lady Mar¬ garet joined them ; " Ask Calantha," she said, " now ask her about the pearl neck¬ lace." The pearl necklace in question was one which Lord Avondale had given her on the eve of her marriage. She was now accused of having given it to Lord Glenarvon. It is true that she had placed in his hands all the jewels of which she was mistress, that his presents might not exceed in value such as she had power to offer; they had been too magnificent otherwise for her to receive ; and though only dear because they were his gift», yet to have taken them without return had been more pain than pleasure :
one smile of his were worth them all— one approving look, far dearer. This gift of Lord Avondale's, however, she had con¬ sidered as sacred, and neither Lord Gle*· narvon's love, nor her own perversion» had led her to touch it. She had received it when innocent and true ; it was pain to her even to look upon it now ; and when she heard the accusation made against her, she denied it with considerable warmth ; for guilt but irritates the mind, and renders the perpetrator im¬ patient of accusation. " This indigna¬ tion is rather ill-timed however," said Lady Margaret, sarcastically : " there are thing's more sacred than pearls thrown away ; and if the necklace has not been given, it is, I believe, the only thing·, retained." Such unpleasant conversation was now interrupted by Sophia, who entered the room.—" The necklace is found," she said; " and who do you think had taken it ?" " I care not," said Calantha n 2
proud and offended at their former sus* picions. " Zerbellini !" " Oh impos¬ sible !" " Some of Lady Margareťs ser¬ vants first suggested the possibility," said Sophia. " His desk and wardrobe were consequently examined, and scarce giv* ing credit to the testimony of their sight, the lost prize was discovered in his silken Vest." Calantha indignantly resisted the general belief that the boy was the real culprit. Every one left the room, and eagerly enquired into the whole affair. " If ocular proof be necessary to con¬ vince you," said Lady Margaret, return¬ ing to Calantha and leading her from the billiard room, accompanied by many others, " you shall now have it; and see," she cried, pausing as she entered the boy's apartment, "how soundly crimi¬ nals can sleep !" " Aye, and how tran¬ quil and innocent they can appear," con¬ tinued Gondimar smiling as he stood by the side of the page's bed. Glenarvon's countenance, rendered more terrible by
the glimmering of the lamp, ch«anged at these words. There, sleeping in unsuspicious peace, lay the youthful Zerbellini, his cheeks blooming, his rich auburn hair flowing in clusters about his face, his arms thrown over his head with infantine and playful grace. <4 If he be guilty," said Cal-an¬ tha, looking earnestly at him, 44 how much one may be deceived !" 44 How much one may be deceived Г* said the Duke turning back and glancing his eye on the trembling form of his daughter. The necklace was produced : but a look of doubt was still seen on every countenance, and Lord Glenarvon, sternly approaching Gondimar, asked him whe¬ ther some villain might not have placed it there, to screen himself and to ruin tbe boy ? 4t I should be loath," replied the Italian, with an affectation of humi¬ lity, 4i very loath to imagine that such a wretch could exist." A glance of bitter scorn, was the only reply vouchsafed. N 3
" We can see die boy, alone, i« Üıe morning," said Sophia in a low whisper to Calantha ; " there is more in this than we к «no w of. Be calm ; fear not, and to¬ morrow, we can with caution discove» all." ** Do not talk of to-morrow," re¬ plied Calantha angrily : " an hour, a mo¬ ment is too long to bear injustice, I will plead with my father." So saying, she followed him, urging him to hear her. " Consider tlie youth of the child," she said, "even if guilty, remember he is but young." " His youth but aggravates the crime," said the Duke, haughtily re¬ pulsing her. " When the young can act basely, it shews that the heart's core is black. Plead not for him : look to yourself, child," he fiercely cried, and left her. The time was past when a prayer of Calan tha's was never breathed in vain ; and struggling with a thousand strong emotions, she fled to her own room, «and gave vent to the contending
passions, by which she was so greatly agitated. That night Lord Glenarvon slept not at the Castle. Zerbellini's guilt was now considered as certain. The Duke himself aivakening the child, asked him if he had t-aken the necklace. He coloured extremely ; hid his face, and then ack*· uowledged the offence. He was ques¬ tioned respecting his motive; but he evaded, and would not answer. His doom was therefore fixed. u I will take him from hence," said Gondimar. 44 He must not remain here a single hour ; but no se¬ verity shall be sheivn to so youthful an offender." It was at that dark still hour of the night, when spirits that are troubled wake, and calmer eyes are closed in sleep, that Lady Margaret and Count Gondimar, entering Zerbellini's room, asked him if he were prepared. 4t For what?" ex¬ claimed the boy, clasping his hands to¬ gether. " Oimèì eccelenza che vuoi/ N 4
Save me," he cried, appealing to Lady Margaret. 44 Iwill not, cannot go." 44 Will no one pity me ? Oh Gondimar ! are these your promises—your kindnesses ?" 44 Help me to bear him away," said Gondimar to Lady Margaret. ;t If Glenarvon should hear us ?" and force was used to bear the struggling boy from the Castle ? In the morning Calantha was informed, by Lady Margaret, of the whole transac¬ tion. She said, however, that on account of his youth, no other notice would be taken of his fault, than that of his being immediately sent back to his parents at Florence. Calantha was unquiet and restless the whole of the day. 44 The absence of your page," said Lady Margaret sarcastically, as she passed her, 44 seems to have caused you some little uneasiness. Do you ex¬ pect to find him in any of these rooms ? Have you not been to Craig Allen Bay, or the Wizzard's Glen ? Has the Chapel been examined thoroughly ?"
A loud noise and murmur interrupted her. The entrance of the Count Gondi¬ mar, pale and trembling, supported by Lord Glenarvon and a servant, gave a general alarm.— 44 Ruffians," said Gon¬ dimar, fiercely glancing his eyes around, 44 attacked our carriage, and forced the child from my grasp." 4C Where ?— how?" 44 About twenty miles hence," said the Italian. 44 Curse on the dark¬ ness, which prevented my defending my¬ self as I ought." 44 Those honorable wounds," said Glenarvon, 44 prove suffi¬ ciently that the Count wrongs himself." 44 Trelawny," whispered Gondimar, 4C do me a favour. Fly to the stables ; view well Glenarvon's steed ; mark if it bear any appearance of recent service : I strong. ly suspect him : and but for his presence at these gates, so calm, so cleanly ac¬ coutred, I could have staked my soul it was by his arm 1 received these wounds." 44 The horse," said Lord * Trelawny, when he returned, 4i is sleek and far dif- N 5 >Δ-
ferent from the reeking steeds that fol¬ lowed with your carriage." Glenarvon smiled scornfully on the officious Lord : tben fixing his eye sternly upon Gondi¬ mar, " I read your suspicions," lie said in а 1олу voice, as he passed: " they are just. Now, serpent, do thy worst: thou art at my mercy." " Not at thine/' re¬ plied Gondimar, grinding his teeth. " By the murdered....." " Say no more," said Glenarvon, violently agi¬ tated, while every trembling nerve attes¬ ted the agony he endured. " For God's sake be silent. I will meet you at St. Alvin's to-night : you shall iiwestigate the whole of my conduct, and you will not find in it aught to giveyou just offence." " The ground upon which you stand has a crimsoned dye," said Gondimar, with a malicious smile : " look at your hand, my lord...." Glenarvon, faint and exhausted, scarce appeared to support himself any longer; but suddenly col¬ lecting all his forces together, with a
struggle, which nature seemed scarcely equal to endure, he sprung upon the Italian, and asked him fiercely the mean¬ ing of his words, Gondimar now, in his turn, trembled; Lord Trelawney inter¬ posed ; and peace was apparently restored #
CHAPTER XXIX. The scene ofthe morning had caused con¬ siderable speculation. The count,though slightly indisposed—appeared at dinner : after which Lord Glenarvon took a hasty leave. It need not be said what Calan¬ tha's feelings were. Gondimar and Lady Margaret talked much together, during the evening. Calantha wrote in anxiety to Glenarvon. No one was now near to comfort her. As she retired slowly and sadly to her room in dreadful suspense, O'Kelly, Glenarvon's servant, passed her on the stairs. The sight of his counte¬ nance was joy to her. " My lord waits to see you, at the back door on the ter¬ race," he said, as he affected to hasten away with a portmanteau on his shoulder* She heard and marked the words, and watching an opportunity hastened to the>
door. It was locked ; but O' Kelly awai¬ ted her and opened it. To be in the power of this man was nothing : lie was Glenarvon's long tried and faithful ser¬ vant ; yet she felt confused when she met his eyes ; and tliought it an indignity that her secret had been betrayed to him. Glenarvon, however, had commanded her to trust him ; and every command of his she too readily obeyed. " 'My lord is going," said the man. " Where ?" she cried ; in the utmost agony. " From Ireland," said O'Kelly. " But he waits for you by yonder tree," she hastened for¬ ward. " Ah speak to me," she said, upon seeing him : " my heart is tortured ; con¬ fide at least in me : let me have the com¬ fort of believing that I contribute to the happiness of one human being upon earth ; 1 who cause the misery of so many." Gle¬ narvon turned from her. " Tell me the cause of your distress." " They will tear yon from m^/* " Never,
never," she answered. íc Look not on me, frail, fading flow ret," he said, in a hollow mournful tone—"ah look, not on me, nor thus waste thy sweets upon a whited se¬ pulchre, full of depravity and death. Could'st thou read my heart—couldst thou see how it is seared, thou would'st tremble and start back with horror," 4b I have bound myself to you," she replied, 44 1 am prepared for the worst : it cannot be worse than the crime of which I am guilty ; grieve not then for me, I am calm and happy—oh most happy, when I am thus with you." There is a look of anguish, such as a slave might give when he betrays his master—such as a murderer in thought might shew previous to the commission of the bloody act, in presence of his victim :—such a look, so sad, so terri¬ ble, impressed a momentary gloom over the beautiful countenance of Glenarvon. Yes, when she said that she was happy, - at that very time he shrunk from the joy
she professed; for he knew that he had led her to that which would blast all peace in her heart for ever. " Calantha," at length he said, " let me pour out the agonies of my soul, to my only friend. I have promised your aunt to leave you : yes ; for thy dear sake, I will go ; and none shall hereafter say of me, that I led you to share my ruined fortunes, or cast dis¬ grace upon your name! Whatever my wrongs and injuries, to others, let one woman exist to thank me for her preser¬ vation. It will break my heart ; but I will do it. You will hear dreadful things of me, when I am away : you will learn to hate, to curse me." " Oh never, Glenarvon, never. *' " I believe you Jove me," he continued ; " and ere we part, ere we forget every vow given and received — every cherished hope, now blighted so cruelly for me, give me some proof of your sincerity. Others perhaps have been my victims;
I, alas ! am your's. You do not know, you cannot know what I feel, you have made me insensible to every other pursuit. I seem to exist alone in you, and for you, and can you, can you then abandon me? Go if it be your pleasure, receive the applause of the world, of friends, of those who affect the name ; and when they hear that Glenarvon has fled, a voluntary exile from his country without one being to share his sorrows, perishing by slow degrees of a cruel and dangerous malady, which long has preyed upon his constitution, then let your husband and your aunt triumph in the reflection, thaf they have hastened his doom. And yon, wretched victim, remember, that having brightened for a few short hours my wea¬ ry path, you have left me at the last more lonely, more deserted even than when first you appeared before me. Oh Calantha, let others mock at my agony, and doubt the truth of one who has but too well - deserved their suspicions ; but do not you
refuse to believe me. Young as I appear, I have made many miserable : but none mure so than myself; and, having cast away every bright hope of dawning fame and honor, I renounce even now the only being who stands like a guardian an¬ gel between myself and eternal perdition. Oh canst thou doubt such love ? and yet believing it, wiltthou consentthat I should thus abandon thee ? I have sacrificed for thee the strong passions that, like vultures, prey upon my heart—fortune, honor, every hope, even beyond the grave, for thy happiness—for thy love ! Ah say canst thou—wilt thou now abandon me ?" " Glenarvon," Lady Avondale replied, weeping bitterly. " I am much more mise¬ rable than you can be ; I have more love for you than it is possible you can feel for me. I am not worth half what you inspire. I never will consent to part." " Then you must accompany me/' he said, look¬ ing her full in the face, " Alas ! if I do
thus, how will yourself despise me. When society, and those ivhose opinion you value, brand her name with infamy who leaves all for you, ivhere shall we fly from dishonor? how will you bear up under my disgrace?" " I will bear you in my arms from the country that con¬ demns you—in my heart, your name shall continue spotless as purity," he replied,—" sacred as truth. I will resist every opposition, and slay every one who shall dare to breathe one thought against you. For you I could renounce and des¬ pise the world ; and I will teach you that love is in itself such ecstacy, that all we leave for it is nothing to it." "How can I resist you?" she answered. "Allow me to hear and yet forget the les¬ sons ivhich you teach—let me look on you, yet doubt you—Jet me die for you, but not see you suffer thus." " Come wdth me now—even now," said Glenarvon fiercely;—" I must make you mine before - we part: then I will trust you; but not
till then." He looked upon her with scorn, as she struggled from his grasp. " Calantha, you affect to feel more than I do," he cried; " but your heart could not exist under what I endure, You love!—Oh you do not know how to love." " Do not be so cruel to me: look not so fierce Glenarvon. For you, for you,I have tempted the dangers of guilt ; for you, I have trembled and wept; and, believe it, for you 1 will bear to die." " Then give yourself to me : this very hour be mine." "And I am your's for ever :" " But it must }>e your own free act and deed. Fear not ; Lady Margaret is in my power ; I am appointed to an interview with her to-mor¬ row ; and your aunt dares not refuse you, if you say that you will see me. It is on your firmness I rely : be prudent: it is but of late I counsel it. Deceit is indeed foreign to my nature ; but what disguise WQţdd I not assume to see you ?" O'Kelly interrupted this conference by whispering something in his ear.—
44 1 will attend her instantly." 4£ Whom?" said Calantha. 44 Oh no one." 44 Ah speak truly: tell me what mean those words—-those mysterious looks : you smile : that moon bears witness against you; tell me all." 44 I will trust vou," «к J said Glenarvon. 4t Oh, my Lord, for Heaven's sake ľ'said O'Kelly interfering, 44 remember your vows, I humbly en¬ treat." 44 Hear me," said Glenarvon, in an authoritative tone, repulsing him. 44 What are you all w ithout me ? Tremble then at daring to advise, or to offend me. Lady Avondale is mine ; we are but one, and she shall know my secret, though I were on the hour betrayed." 41 My Lady you are lost," said the man, 44 if you do not hasten home ; you are w r atched : I do implore you to return to the castle." Lord Glenarvon reluctantly permitted her to leave him ; he promised to see her on the following morning ; and she has¬ tened home*
CHAPTER XXX. Unable to rest, Calantha wrote during the whole ofthe night ; and in the morn¬ ing, she heard that the Duke was in pos¬ session of her letter. Lady Margaret entered, and informed her of this. She also stated that the note would! soon be returned into her own hands, and that although much might be suspected from its contents, neither herself nor the Duke were of opinion that Lord Avondale should at pre¬ sent be informed of the transaction. While Lady Margaret was yet speaking, the Duke, opening the door, with a severe countenance approached Calantha, and placing the letter to Lord Glenarvon upon the table, assured her, with coldness, that he considered her as her own mistress, and should not interfere. Lady Margaret
without a word further being uttered on her part, left the room. As soon as she was gone, the Duke ap* proached his daughter. 4C This is going too far," he said, pointing to the letter: 44 there is no excuse for you." She asked him, with some vivacity, why he had broken the seal, and wherefore it was not delivered as it was addressed. With cold¬ ness he apologized to her for the liberty he had taken, which evena father's right over an only child, he observed, could scarcely authorise. 4i But," continued he, 44 duty has of late been so much sacrificed to inclination, that we must have charity for each other. As I came, however, by your letter somewhat unfairly, I shall make no comments upon it, nor describe the feelings that it excited in my mind— only observe, I will have this end here ; and my commands, like your's, shall be obeyed." He then reproached her for her behaviour. 4i I have seen you give way," he said, 4t to exceeding low
spirits, and I am desirous of кполу^ why this grief has suddenly been changed to ill-timed gaiety and shameless effron¬ tery? Will nothing cure you of this love of merriment ? Will an angry father, an offended husband, and a contemning world but add to and encrease it? Shall I say happy Calantha, or shall I weep over the hardness of a heart that is in¬ sensible to the grief of others, and has ceased to feel for itself? Alas ! I looked upon you as my comfort and delight; but you are now to me, a heavy care—a ne¬ ver ceasing reproach ; and if you persist in this line of conduct, the sooner you quit this roof, which rings лукЬ your dis* grace, the better it will be for us all. Those ΛνΙιο are made early sacrifices to ambition and interest may plead some ex¬ cuse; but you Calantha, what can you say to palliate your conduct? A father's blessing accompanied the choice your own heart made ; and was not Avondale a noble choice ? What quality is there,
whether of person or of mind, in ivhich he is deficient ? I think of him with feelings of pride."—" I do so, too, my father."—" Go, poor deluded child," he continued, in an offended tone, " fly to the arms of your new lover, and seek with him that happiness of which you have robbed me for ever, and which I fear you yourself never more will know. Do not answer me, or by those proud looks attempt to hide your disgrace. I am aw r are of all you w r ould urge ; but am not to be swayed by the sophistry you would employ. This is no innocent friend¬ ship. Beware to incense me by uttering one word in its defence. Are you not taught that God, who sees the heart, looks not at the deed, but at the motive ? In his eye the murderer who has made up his mind to kill, has already perpetrated the deed ; and the adultress who.... "—· "Ah, call me not by that name, my father : I am your only child. No proud looks shall now shew themselves, or support
me ; but on my knees here, even here, I humble myself before you. Speak not so harshly to me: I am very miserable." 44 Consent to see him no more. Say it, iny child, and all shall be forgotten—I will forgive you."— 44 I must see''him once more—ah ! once more ; and if he consents, I will obey."—" Good God î dol live to hear such words? Is it then to Lord Glenarvon's mercy, and to no effort of your own, that I am to owe your amendment? See him then, but do it in defiance of my positive com¬ mands:— see him, Calantha; but the veangeance of an offended God, the male¬ diction of a father fall on thee for thy disobedience:—see him if it be thy mad resolve ; but meet my eyes no more. A lover may be found at any time ; but a father, once offended, is lost for ever : his will should be sacred; and the God of Heaven may see fit to withdraw his mercy from a disobedient child," The Duke, as he spoke these words, trembled Vol. IL О
W/iíh passion, and darting an angry eye lipon Calantha, left her. The door closed. She stood suspended — uncertain how to act.^- At length recovering, she seized a pen, and wrote to Glenarvon.—" I am indeed wretched ; but let me, at all events, spare you. Come not to the Castle. Write to me: it is all I ask. I must quit you for ever. Oh, Glenarvon, I must indeed see you no more ; or involve all whom I love, and yourself, who art far dearer, in my disgrace. Let me hear from you im¬ mediately. You must decide for me: I have no will on earth but your's—no hope but in the continuance of your love. Do not call me weak. Write to me : say you approve ; for if you do not, I cannot obey." Having sent her letter with some fear, she went to Mrs. Seymour, who was far from well, and had been some days con¬ fined to her room. She endeavoured to conceal from her what had passed in the
morning respecting her father. Mrs. Sey¬ mour spoke but little to her, she seemed unequal to the task imposed upon her by others, of telling Calantha that which she knew wouid cause her pain. She was dreadfully agitated, and holding her niece's hand, seemed desirous she should' not leave her for any length of time. Towards noon, Calantha went out for & few moments, and near the Elm wood met Glenarvon. "Oh, for Heaven's sake!" she cried, " do not come here : some one may see you."— " And if they do," he said calmly, " what of that?"—" I can¬ not stay now:—for your sake I cannot:— meet me to-night."—" Where ?" How ?" —" At the Chapel."—" At what hour ?" —" At twelve."—" That is too early."— " At three."—" I dare not come."—" Then farewell."— " Glenarvon !" He turned back. " 1 cannot be thus trifled with," he said. " You have given yourself to me: I was not prepared for this wavering and caprice."«—" Oln you know not what о 2
has passed."—" I know all."—" My aunt is ill/' He smiled contemptuously. " Act as you think right," he said; " but do not be the dupe of these machina¬ tions."—" She is really ill: she is incapa¬ ble of art."—" Go to her, then."—" And you—shall I see you no more?"—" Ne¬ ver."—" I shall come to-night."—" As you please."—" At all events, I shall be there, Glenarvon.—Oh look not thus on tne. You know, you well know your power : do not lead meto infamy and ruin." Glenarvon seized Calantha's hand, which he wrung with violence. Passion in him was very terrible: it forced no fierce words from his lips ; no rush of blood suffused his cheeks and forehead ; butthelivid pale of suppressed rage spread itself over every feature : even his hands bore testimony to the convulsive effort which the blood, receding to his heart, occasioned. Thus pale, thus fierce, he gazed on Calantha with disdain.—" Weak, timid being, is it for this I have renounced so much?—Is it for such as you that
I have consented to live ? How different from her I once loved. Go to the parents for whom I am sacrificed ; call back the husband who is so preferred to me ; note well his virtues and live upon his cares¬ ses :—the world will admire and praise you. I knew how it would be and am satisfied. Then with a rapid change of countenance from malice to bitter an¬ guish, he gazed on her, till his eyes were filled with tears : while his lips faltered as he said farewell. Calantha approached too near : he pressed her to his heart, " I am yours," she said, half suffocated. " Nor parents, nor hnsband, nor fear of man or Heaven shall ever cause me to leave you/ 1 —" You will meet me to-night then."—" I will."—" You will not play upon my irritated feelings by penitential letters and excuses—you are decided, are you ? Say either yes or no ; but be firm to either."—" 1 will come then, let dis¬ grace or death be the consequence." о 3
CHAľTEK XXXI. In the course of the day, Glenarvon wrote to Calantha, 4i I have never sought to win you to me after the manner other men might desire," he said. 44 I have respected your opinions ; and I have re¬ sisted more than woman's feelings can conceive. But Calantha you have shared the struggle. I have marked in your eye the fire of passion, in the quivering of your lip and changing complexion, the fierce power which destroyed you. When in the soft language of poetry, I have read to you, or spoken with the warmth I knew not how to feign, you have turned from me, it is true ; but pride more than virtue, inclined your firm resis¬ tance. Every principle in your heart is shaken ; every tie that ought to bind thee mast, is broken ; and I, who should
triumph at my success, weep only for rhy fall. ï found thee innocent, confi¬ ding and sincere : I leave thee—but, oh God ! wilt thou thus be left ? wilt thou now that thy fouI itself partakes in thy guilt, wilt thou forsake me? Upon this night," continued Glenarvon, "you have given me a solemn promise to meet me in secret : it is the first time conceal¬ ment has been rendered necessary. I know your nature too well, not to be con¬ vinced that you are already preparing to retract. Do so, if it be your will :—I wish you not to take one step without fully appreciating its consequences, and the crime incurred. I have never dis¬ guised to you the guilt of our attachment sine* the moment in which I felt assured of my iwn sentiments. I washed you to feel the sacrifice vou were making : how otherwise could I consider it as any ? my love h worth some risk. Every one knows my weakness; and did you feel half what you inspire, you would be о 4
proud, you would glory in what you now attempt to hide. The woman I love, must see, must hear, mnst believe and confide in uo other but me, I renounce every other for you.—And, now that I claim you as my own, I expect the fulfil¬ ment of your many professions. Shew me that you can be firm and true : give yourself to me entirely : you are mine ; and you must prove it. I am preferred before every earthly being in my Calan¬ tha's heart—my dearest, my only friend. Of this indeed I have long ceased to enter¬ tain a single doubt; but now 1 require more. Even in religious faith—even in hopes, in reliance upon the mercy of God, I cannot bear a competitor and a rival. 44 There is a rite accounted infamous amongst christians :—there is an oath which it is terrible to take. By this, by this alone,! w ill have you bound to me— not here alone, but if tliere be a long here¬ after then shall we evermore be linked together : then shall you be mine far
more, far dearer than either mistress or bride. It is, I own, a mere mockery of superstition : but what on earth deserves a higher name ? Every varying custom and every long-established form, whether in our own land, or those far distant tracts which the foot of man has rarely traversed, deserves no higher name. The customs of our forefathers^—the habit of years, give a venerable and sacred ap¬ pearance to many rites ; but all is a dream, the mere colouring of fancy, the frail perishable attempts of human inven¬ tion. Even the love we feei, Calantha— the beaming fires ivhich now stimulate our hearts, and raise us above others is but illusion—like the bright exhaltations which appear to mislead, then vanish and leave us more gloomy than before." Calantha's eyes were fixed ; her hand was cold ; no varying colour, no trepi¬ dation shewed either life or vigour ; there was a struggle in her mind ; and a voice seemed to call to her from her inmost о 5
soul : " For the last time, Calantha, it seemed to say, 1 warn thee, for the last time I warn thee. Oh hear the voice of conscience as it cries to thee for the last time !—go not to thy ruin : plunge not thy soul into the pit of hell ; hurl not de¬ struction upon thy head. What is this sin against thy religion ? How canst thou throw off thy faith and reliance upon thy God ? It is a mere mockery of words ; a jealous desire to possess every avenue of thy heart's affections, to snatch thee ι» from every feeling of remorse and virtue ; to plunge thee into eternal perdition. Hear me : by thy mother's name I call : go not to thy soul's ruin and shame".... ; ' Am I mad, or wherefore is my soul distracted ? Oh Glenarvon, come again to me: my comforter—my hearťs friend, oh leave me not. By every tie thou art bound to me : never, never will I forsake thee. What are the reproaches of con¬ science—what the fancied pangs of re¬ morse, to the glory, of being thine? Re-
turn Glenarvon, adored, beloved. Thy presence is the light of life : existence without thee would not be worth the pur¬ chase.—Come all the woes that may, upon me, never will I forsake Glenarvon." The nurse entered Calantha's room, bearing her boy in her arms. She ivould not look on him:—" Take him away," she said ; " take him to my aunt." The child wished to stay :—for the first time he hung about her with affection; for he was not of that character, and seldom shewed his love by infantine fondness and caresses. She started from his gen¬ tle grasp, as if from something terrible: " Take him away," she shrieked to the affrighted woman, " and never let him come near me more." There are many ivhose eyes may glance upon these pages, who will regard with indignation the confession here made respecting the character of Calantha. But it is as if those who had never knoivn sickness and agony mocked at its power
—as if those who had never witnessed the delirious ravings of fever or insanity rea¬ soned upon their excess, they must not judge who ean not understand. Driven to despair—guilty in all but the liist black deed that brands the name and character with eternal infamy, Calan¬ tha resolved to follow Glenarron. How indeed could she remain ! To her every domestic joy was forever blasted ; and a false estimate of honour inclined her to believe, that it was right in her to go.— But not to-night, she said. Oh not like a culprit and a thief in the midst of the night, will I quit my father's house, or leave my aunt sick and ill to grieve her¬ self almost to death for my sake. Preserving, during the evening, a sul¬ len silence, an affectation of offended pride, Calantha retired early ; looked once upon the portraits of her husband and mother; and then turned from them in agony. " He was all kindness to me —nil goodness: he deserved a happier
fate. Happier! alas he is blest: I alone suffer—I alone am miserable ; never, never can I behold him more." These were the last words Calantha uttered, as she prepared for an interview she dreaded, It was now but twelve o'clock : she threw herself upon her bed, and waited in tre¬ pidation and alarm for the hour of three. A knock at the door aroused her. It was O'Kelly ; but he waited not one instant : he left a gold casket with a ring, within was a letter : " My beloved," it said, "I wait for thee. Oh repent not thy pro¬ mise !" Nothing else was written. The hand she well knew : the signature w«as„ " Ever and thine alone, Glenarvon/'
CHAPTER XXXIL It was past three o'clock, when Calantha opened the cabinet ivhere the page's clothes were formerly kept, and drew from thence his mantle and plumed hat ; and, thus disguised, prepared herself for the interview. She slowly descended the stairs : the noisy revels of the servants might still at intervals be heard : in a moment she glided through the apart¬ ments and passages, till she found her¬ self at the door which led to the terrace. It opened heavily, and closed again with a loud noise. Alarmed, lest she should be discovered, she flew with rapidity over the terrace and lawn, till she ap¬ proached the wood, and then she paused to take breath, and to listen if all were . silent. Then she walked fearfully onwards. The first night on which she had met
Glenarvon the moon was bright and full* and the whole scene was lighted by its rays ; but now, it was on the wane—the silver crescent shone alone, and the clouds continually passing over it, cast fearful shadows upon the grass. She found herself in the thickest part of the wood. She heard a hollow murmur: it was but the alders, waving in the wind, which made a tremulous noise, like voices whispering at a distance. She passed on, and the recollection that it was to Glenarvon that she was hastening, and that it w r as probably for the last time, made her indifferent to her fate, and ren¬ dered her fearless. Besides, the despe¬ rate and the guilty never fear: a deeper feeling renders them callous toall beside —a spirit of defiance deadens in them the very edge of apprehension. She pro¬ ceeded to the appointed place. The sea dashed against the cli ft* below; and the bleak wind whistled through the ruined chapel as it came in holloiv blasts over the heath.
Calantha ρ reel ved Glenarvon. He was leaning upon one of the broken rocks: he viewed, unawed, the melan¬ choly scene before him. No supersti¬ tious terrors h d power to shake his soul: m sery had done its utmost to subdue him. Nor hope, nor prosperity, could afford him comfort, or remove his de¬ jection. In the first trabsports of joy at seeing him, she darted towards him; but when she marked the pale¬ ness of his cheeks, the stillness of his attitude, she started back, and ad¬ vanced slowly : for she feared to disturb him. The evening breeze had blown back his dark locks, and bared his pale fore¬ head, upon which the light of the moon¬ beam fell. She gazed upon him ; and while she contemplated the beautiful ma¬ jesty of his figure, his fixed and mourn¬ ful eyes, his countenance so fraught with - feeling, she approached him. v * My friend, my lover," she said. " Ah! my
little trembling page, my Zerbellini, wel¬ come to my heart/* he answered: " I knew you would not fail ; but I have waited for you till every bright illusion of hope has been changed into visions of despondency and fear. We meet now: but is it indeed to part no more ! Glenar¬ von is your's, and shall never be severed from you/' " Ah! triumph over yourself and me/* she cried, clasping her hands in alarm. ** Ask any sacrifice but this. Do not make me contemptible to you and to myself/* " Calantha, the time forsafety is past: it is too late now. i have linked my soul to your*s ; I love you in defiance of myself; I know it to be guilt, and to be death ; but it must be. We follow but the dark destiny that involves us ; we cannot escape from fate. For you alone I live :—be now but mine. They tell you of misery, of inconstancy, of lover's per¬ juries, from the olden time ; but you shall prove them false. You leave much, it is
true—rank, fame and friends, a home and the dearest ties of a mother's heart— children ; but have you not embittered all that you relinquish ! Say that I yield you up and fly,—to what fate shall 1 then consign you ! to what endless repining, unjoyous solitary hours—remorse, re¬ gret, the bitter taunt of friends, the in¬ sulting scorn of strangers, and, worse than all—O! worse than all the recoiling heart can endure, the unsuspicious confi¬ dence and caresses of an injured hus¬ band, of him you have already betrayed. О Calantha, turn from these to a lover's bosom; seek for comfort here; and now, even now, accompany me in my flight. " lwill ieave all for you:—I love but you: be you my master." Scarce had »he uttered the impious oath which bound her to him, when her heart, convulsed with terror, ceased to beat. " Ti's but in words—oh God ! 'tis but in words, that thy guilty servant has offended. No—even
ш the mad infatuation of passion, the fear of thy vengeance spake terrors into her soul, and ingratitude for all thy favours was not to be numbered with her sins." But the step she had taken was terrible. She considered herself as no longer under the protection of her father, she had dis¬ obeyed his sacred command, she had broken her solemn promise ; she trem¬ bled exceedingly ; and fear for one mo¬ ment overpowered her. Lord Glenar¬ von looked upon her, mournfully, as if sorry for the sin which he had cast upon her soul. 4C Now," he said, 4i you will look back upon these moments, and you will consider me with abhorrence. 1 have led you with me to ruin and remorse," 44 On me—on me, be the sin ; let it fall upon me alone," she replied ; t4 but if, after this, you forsake me, then shall the ven-, geance of Heaven be satisfied—the mea¬ sure of my crime be at its full. It is not in my power—I cannot forsake you now: I will go with you, Glenarvon, if it were
tocertaindeatbandruin. Iam yoursalone. But this night I must return home," she said. 44 lwill not leave my father thus—I will not cause my aunt's death." 44 If you leave me now I shall lose you." 44 OGlenar- von, let me return ; and after seeing them once again, I will follow you firm until death." He placed aring upon her finger, 44 It is a marriage bond," he said ; 44 and if there be a God, let him n- w bear witness to my vows:—I here, uncompelled by menace, unsolicited by entreaty, do bind myself through life to you. No other, in word or thought, shall ever hold influence or power over my heart. This is no lover's oath—no professioa which the intoxication of pas¬ sion may extort: it is the free and solemn purpose ot a soul conquered and enchain¬ ed by you. Oh Calantha, beloved, adored, look upon me, and say that you believe me. Lean not upon a lover's bosom, but upon a friend, a guardian and protector, a being wholly relying on your mercy and
kindness. My love, my soul, look yet once upon me." " Why fall our tears ? Is it in terror of approaching evil, or in regret for invo¬ luntary error ? My bosom's comfort, my soul's idol, look not thus coldly on me ; for I deserve it not. Your will is mine : lead me as it delights your fancy : I am a willing* slave." " If you abandon me," said Calantha, in tears. " May the curse of God burn my heart and con¬ sume me ! may every malediction and horror fall tenfold upon my head ! may frenzy and madness come upon my senses ! and tortures in this world and the next be my portion, if ever I change towards you !" With words like these, Glenarvon si¬ lenced her as she returned to the castle ; and, strange as it may seem, untroubled sleep—such sleep as in better days she once enjoyed, fell upon all her senses, quieted every passion, and obliterated, for a few hours, the scenes of guilt which tortured her with their remembrance.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
To w r ake is terrible when the heaviness of sin is upon us !—to wake, and see every object around us the same as be¬ fore ; but to feel that we are utterly changed ! I am still in a father's house, she thought, as late the ensuing morning she opened her eye. u My name is not yet branded with disgrace ; but I belong alone upon earth to Glenarvon. Mrs. Seymour sent for her : the nurse entered with the children. But Calantha looked upon the ring and trembled. Lady Avondale ordered her horses, and, dressing in haste, entered Mrs. Seymour's room. Never had she found it easy to deceive till that moment. To tell her the truth had been to kill her : she feigned therefore with ease, for her aunťs life re¬ quired it, and she herself was desperate.
" Have you kept your resolution, my Ca¬ lantha ?" — " Yes," she replied, nor blushed at affirming it. " Two days, and you have not seen Glenarvon ?" Is this possible ?—" I thought one had kil¬ led me," replied Calantha; " but I look well ; do I not ?" and she hurried from her aunťs presence. Her horses awaited : she rode out the whole of the day : it seemed to her as if a moment's pause or rest would have been agony unutterable. And yet, when the spirit is heavy there is something un¬ pleasant in the velocity of motion : throw¬ ing, therefore, the reins upon her well- trained steed, she paced slowly over the mountain's side, lost in reflections which it had been pain to interrupt. Suddenly a horse and rider, in full speed, darting along the moor, approached and crossed upon her path. " Whither ride you Lady, so slow ?" said Miss St. Clare, whom she now recognized, scarce reining in her swift-footed charger. " And
whither ride you, Lady, so fast ?" said Calantha, courteously returning her sa¬ lute. " To perdition," cried Elinor ; 44 and they that wish to follow must ride apace." The hat and plume of sacred green, the emerald clasp, the gift of Gle¬ narvon, were all but too well observed by Calantha. Deeply she blushed as St. Clara, fixing her dark eyes upon her, asked her respecting him, " Is thy young lover well ?" she said : " and wilt thou be one of us ? He slept 1-ast night at Bel¬ font : he could not rest - didst thou ? " Saying which, she smiled, and rode away. Oppressed with many bitter doubts, Calantha returned to the Castle ; and what is strange, she felt coldly toivards Glenarvon. On her return, she found letters from him far the most ardent, the most impassioned she had yet received. He spoke with grief of her unkindness : he urged her by every tie most dear, most sacred, to see him and fly with him. Yet, that night, she went not to meet
him ; she wrote not kindly ; she loved not. She retired early ; and her thoughts were painful and terrible. But such is the inconsistency of the human heart ; her coldness seemed but to encrease his ardour. She received that night, the warmest the most unguarded letters ; she even now dreaded the violence of his at¬ tachment. Remorse, she felt, had taken the place of passion in her own heart: for all within was chilled, was changed. As she thus satin sullen silence, unwil¬ ling to think—unable to forget, she heard a step stealing along the passage ; and in a moment Glenarvon entered her apart¬ ment. " We are lost," she cried. " ï care not." he said, ** so that I but see you."—" For Heaven's sake, leave me." —" Speak lower," he said, approaching her : " be calm, for think you that when you have risked so mucb for me, I dare not share the danger. After all, what is it ? Whoever enters must do it at their peril : their life shall pay the forfeit : I Vol. II. P.
am armed."—" Glenarvon ! how terrible are your looks : I love you ; but I fear you." " Do you remember," he replied, " that day when I first told you of my love ? You blushed then, and wept : did you not ? But you have forgotten to do either now. Why, then, this strange confusion ?"—" I am sick at heart. Leave me."—" Never ! О most loved, most dear of all earthly beings, turn not thus away from me ; look not as if you feared to meet me ; feel not regret ; for if it be a crime, that be on me, Calantha—on me alone. I know how men of the world can swear and forswear : I know, too, how much will be attempted to sever you from me : but by that Being in whose sacred eye we stand ; by all that the hu¬ man heart and soul can believe and che rish, I am not one ofthat base kind, who would ever betray the woman that trusted in me. Even were you unfaithful to me, I could not change. You are all on earth
that I love, and, perhaps what is better worth, that I esteem and respect—that I honor as above every other in goodness, purity, and generous, noble feelings. О ! think not so humbly of yourself : say not that you are degraded. My admiration of you shall excuse your error: My faith¬ ful attachment whilst existence is given to either of us shall atone for all. Look on me, my only friend ; dry up the tears that fall for an involuntary fault; and consider me as your protector, your lover, your husband." There required not many words, not many protestations. Calantha wept bit¬ terly ; but she felt happy. 44 If you change now," she said, 44 what will become of me ? Let me go with you, Glenarvon, from this country : I ask not for other ties than those that already bind us. Yet I once more repeat it, I know you must despise me."— 4i What are words and vows, my hearťs life, my soul's idol, what are they ? The false, the vain, the worldly- p 2
minded have made use of them ; but I must have recourse to them, Calantha, since you can look at me, and yet mis¬ trust me. No villany that ever yet existed, can exceed that which my falsehood to you would now evince. This is no com¬ mon worldly attachment : no momentary intoxication of passion. Often I have loved : many I have seen ; but none ever sacrificed for me what you have done ; and for none upon earth did I ever feel what I do for you. I might have made you mine long ago : perhaps I might have abused the confidence shewn me. and the interest and enthusiasm I had created ; but, alas ! } ou v ould then have despised me. I conquered myself; but it was to secure you more entirely. I am your's only : consent therefore to fly with me. make any trial y ou please of my truth. What I speak I have written : my letters you may shew, my actions you may ob¬ serve and sift. I have not one thought that is unknown to you—one wish, one
hope of which you are not the first and sole object. Many disbelieve that I am serious in my desire that you should ac¬ company me in my flight. They know me not : I have no views, no projects. Men of the world look alone to fortune, fame, or interest ; but what am I ? The sacrifice is solely on your part : I would that it were on mine, lf even you re¬ fuse to follow me, I will not make this a plea for abandoning you : I will hover around, will protect, will watch over you. Your love makes my happiness : it is my sole hope in life. Even were you to change to me, I could not but be true to you." Did Glenarvon really wish Calantha to accompany him : he risked much ; and seemed to desire it. But there is no un¬ derstanding the guileful heart ; and he who had deceived many, could assu¬ redly deceive her. Yet it appears, that he urged her more than ever to fly with him ; and that when, at length she said that her resolution was fixed—that p 3
she would go, his eyes in triumph gloried in the assurance : and with a fervour he could not have feigned he called her his. Hitherto, some virtuous, some religious hopes had still sustained her ; now all ceased ; perversion led the way io crime, and hardness of heart and insensibility followed. One by one, Glenarvon repeated to her confessions of former scenes. One by one, he betrayed to her the confidence others had reposed in his honour. She saw ibe wiles and windings of his mind, nor abhorred them : she heard his mockery of all that is good and noble ; nor turned from him. Is it in the nature of guilty love thus to pervert the very soul ? Or what in so short a period could have ope¬ rated so great a change ? Till this period the hope of saving, of guarding, of re¬ claiming, had led hen on : now frantic and perverted passion absorbed all other hopes. Calantha had read of love, and felt it î
she had laughed at the sickening rhapso¬ dies of sentiment, and turned with dis¬ gust from the inflammatory pages of looser pens; but, alas í her own heartnow presented every feeling she had most ab¬ horred ; and it wa» in herself she found the reality of all that, during her whole existence, she had looked upon with con¬ tempt and dislike. Every remaining scruple left her ; she still urged delay ; but to accompany her master and lover was noiv her firm resolve.
CHAPTER XXXIV, Glenarvon had retired unperceived by any, on the evening he had visited her, in her apartment. The following day he appeared at the castle ; they both avoided each other : she indeed trembled at beholding him. 44 Meet me at the chapel to night," he whispered. Alas ! she obeyed too well. They were returning through the wood : she paused one moment to look upon the sea : it was calm ; and the air blew soft and fresh upon her burning forehead.—What dreadful sight is that?... a female figure passing through the thicket behind, with a hasty step ap¬ proached them, and knelt down as if im¬ ploring for mercy. Her looks were wild ; famine had stamped its hollow prints in furrows on her cheeks : she clasped her
hands together ; and fixing her eyes wild¬ ly upon Glenarvon, remained in silence. Terrified, Calantha threw herself for safety at his feet ; and he clasping her closely to his bosom saw but her. 4i Oh ! Glenarvon," she cried, 44 look, look ; it is not a human form : it is some dreadful vision, sent to us by the power of Heaven, to warn us." 44 My soul, my Calantha, fear not : no power shall harm you." Turningfrom her, Glenarvon now gazed for one moment on the thin and ghastly form, that had occasioned her terror. 14 God bless you." cried the suppliant. He started atthe hollow sound. It seemed to him indeed that the awful blessing was a melancholy reproach for his broken faith. He started, for in tbat emaciated form, in that wild and haggard eye, he thought he recognized some traces of one whom he had once taken spotless as innocence to his heart,—then left a prey to remorse and disappointment. For the p 5
sake of that resemblance*, he offered mo¬ ney to the wretch who implored his mercy, and turned away, not to behold again so piteous, so melancholy a spectacle. Intently gazing upon him, she uttered a convulsive groan, and sunk cxtehded on the earth. Calantha and Glenarvon both flew forward to raise her. But the poor victim was no more : her spirit had burst from the slight bonds that yet re¬ tained it in a world of pain and sorrow. She had gazed for the laät time upon the lover who had robbed her of all happi¬ ness through life; and the same look, which had first awakened love in her bosom, now quenched the feeling, and with it life itself. The last wish of her heart, was a blessing, uot a curse on him who had abandoned her: and the tear that he shed unconsciously over a form so altered, that he did not know
her» was the only tear that blessed the last hour of Calantha's once favorite com¬ panion Alice Mac Allain. Oh ! need a scene which occasioned her every bitter pang be repeated ?—need it be ¡»aid that, regardless of themselves or any conclusions which their being toge¬ ther at such an hour might have oc¬ casioned î they carried the unconscious girl to the door of the castle, where O'Kelly was waiting to receive them. Every one had retired to rest ; it was late ; and one of Calantha's maids and O'Kelly alone remained in fearful anxiety watching for their return. Terrified at the haggard looks, and life¬ less form before her, Calantha turned to Glenarvon. Rut his countenance was changed; bis eyes were fixed. "Itis herself," he cried ; and unable to bear the sight, a faintness came over him :■—ihe name of Alice was pronounced by him. O'Kelly understood his master. " Is it possible?" he exclaimed, and seizing the
girl in his arms, he promised Calan¬ tha to do all in his power to restore her, and only implored her to retire to her own apartment : " For my mastert sake, dear Lady, be persuaded," he said. He was indeed no longer the same subser¬ vient strange being, he had shewn him¬ self hitherto ; he seemed to assume a new character, on an occasion which called for his utmost exertion : he w.as all acti¬ vity and forethought, commanding every thing that was to be done, and awaken¬ ing Lord Glenarvon and Calantha to a sense of their situation. Although Lady Avondale was at last persuaded to retire, it may be supposed that she did not attempt to rest ; and being obliged in some measure to inform her attendant of what had passed, she sent her frequently with messages to O'Kelly to inquire concerning her unhap¬ py friend. At last she returned with a few lines, written by Lord Glenarvon. " Calantha/' he said, " you will now
learn to shudder at my name, and look upon me with horror and execration. Prepare yourself for thé worst :—it is Alice whom we beheld. She came to take one last look at the wretch who had seduced, and then abandoned her :— she is no more. Think not, that to screen myself, I have neglected the means of preserving her.—Think me not base enough for this: but be assured that all care and assistance have been ad* ministered. Tbe aid of the physician, however, is vain. Calm yourself, Ca¬ lantha : I am very calm." The maid, as she gave this note, told Calantha that the young woman, whom Mr. O'Kelly had discovered at the door of the castle, w«as poor Miss Alice—so altered, that her own father, she was sure, ivould not know her. " Did you see her ?" " O yes, my Lady: Mr. O'Kelly took me to see her, when I carried the message to him : and there I saw my Lord Glenarvon so good, so kind, doing
every thing that was needed to assist her, so that it would have moved the heart of any one to have seen him." While the attendant thus continued to talk, her young mistress wept, at having at length dismissed her, she opened the door listening with suspense to every distant noise. It was six in the morning, when a loud commotion upon the stairs aroused her. Hurrying down, she beheld a number of servants carrying some one for air, into one of the outer courts. It was not the lifeless corpse of Alice. From the glimpse Calantha caught, it appeared a larger form, and, upon approaching still nearer, her heart sickened at perceiving that it was the old man, Gerald Mac Al¬ lain, who having arisen to enquire into the cause of the disquiet he heard in the house, had been abruptly informed by some of the servants, that his daugh¬ ter had been 'Uncovered without any signs of life, at the gates of the castle. O'Kelly
and the other attendants had presssd forward to assist him. Calantha now leaving him in their hands, walked in trembling alarm, through the hall, once more to look upon her unhappy friend. There lean ingagainst one of the high black marble pillars, pale, as the lifeless being whom, stretched before him, he still, continued to contem¬ plate, she perceived Glenarvon. His eyes were fixed : in his look there was all the bitterness of death ; his cheek w-as hollow : and in that noble form, the wreck of all that is great might be traced. " Look not thus," she aaid, " Oh Glenarvon: it pierces my heart to see you thus : grief must not fall on one like you." He took her hand, and pressed it to his heart ; but he could not speak. He only pointed to the pale and famished form before him ; and Calantha perceiving it, knelt down by its side and wept in agony : " There was a time," he said, " when I could have feared to cast this sin upon
my soul, or ^varded so much tender¬ ness and affection, as I have done. But I have grown callous to all : and now my only, my dearest friend, I will tear my¬ self away from you for ever. I will not say God bless you :—I must not bless thee, who have brought thee to so much misery. Weep not for one unworthy of you :—I am not Λνΐΐαί you think, my Ca¬ lantha. Unblessed myself, I can but give misery to all ΛνΙιο approach me. All that follow after me come to this pass ; for my love is death, and this is the гелуа^ of constancy. Poor Alice, but still more unhappy Calantha, my heart bleeds for you : for rayself, I am indifferent, Gerald now returned, supported by O'Kelly. The other servants, by his desire, had retired ; and Λνΐιεη he ap¬ proached the spot yvhere his child луа» laid, he requested even O'Kelly to leave him. He did so ; and Mac Allain ad¬ vanced towards Lord Glenarvon. " For¬ give a poor old man," he said in a fal¬ tering voice : "I spoke too severely,
my lord : a father's curse in the agony of his first despair shall not be heard. Oh lady Calantha," said the old man, turning to her, u lord Glenarvon has been very noble and good to me ; my sons had debts, and he paid all they owed : they had transgressed and he got them pardon¬ ed. You know not what I owe to mylord ; and yet when he told me, this night, as I upbraided the wretch that had undone my child and was the cause of her dishonor and death, that it was himself had taken her from my heart; I knelt down and cursed him. Oh God, Oh God î pardon the agony of a wretched father, a poor old man who has lived too long." Calantha could no longer master her feelings ; her sobs, her cries were bitter and terrible. They wished to bear her for¬ cibly away. O'Kelly insisted upon the necessity of her assuming at least some self command;andwhisperingtoher, that, if she betrayed any violent agitation, the whole affair must be made public : he
promised himself to bring her word of every minute particular, if she would for a few hours at least remain tranquil. 4 * I shall see you again," she said, recovering herself and approaching Lord Glenarvon before she retired : 44 You are not going?" 44 Going !" he replied : 44 undoubtedly I shall not leave the castle at this moment ; it would look like fear ; but after this, my dearest friend, I do not deceive myself, you cannot, you ought not more to think of me." 4C I share your sorrows," she said : 44 you are most miserable ; think not then, that I can be otherwise." 44 And can you still feel any interest for one like me ? If I could believe this, even in the bitterness of affliction, I should still feel comfort : but, 34m will learn to hate me." 44 Never. Oh would that I could ; but it is too late now. I love you, Glenarvon, more than ever even were it to death ;— Depend on me." Glenarvon pressed her hand insilence ; then followingher, 44 For your dear sake, I will live," he said. 4ς You
are my only hope, now you will not believe! how from my soul I honour you." Calantha threw herself upon her bed ; but her agitation was too great to allow of her recurring in thought to the past, and fatigue once again occasioned her taking a few moment's rest,
CHAPTER XXXV. When Lady Avondale awoke from her slumbers, she found the ivhole castle in a state of confusion. Lady Margaret had twice sentfor her. Every one was occupied with this extraordinary event. Her name, and Lord Glenarvon*s were mentioned together, and conjectures, concerning the whole scene, were made by every indi¬ vidual. At Gerald Mac Allain's earnest entrea¬ ties, the body of Alice was conveyed to his own house, near the Garden Cottage. He wished no one to be informed of the particulars of her melancholy fate. He came, hoivever, a few days after her remo¬ val, to ask for Calantha. She was ill ; but admitted him immediately. They talked together upon all that had occurred. He gave her a letter and a broach, which
had be en found upon the body. The letter was addressed to Lord Glenarvon. There was also a lock of hair, which seemed, from the fineness of its texture, to belong to a child. The letter was a mournful congra¬ tulation on his supposed marriage with a lady in England, written at some former period : it wished him every happiness, and contained no one reproach. The broach consisted of a heart's ease, which she en¬ treated him sometimes to wear in re¬ membrance of one, who had loved him truly. 44 Hearťs ease to you— mais triste pensée pour moi" was engraved upon it. 44 You must yourself deliver these," said Mac Allain looking wistfully at Calantha. She promised to do so. Mac Allain then drew forth a larger packet which was addressed to himself. 44 I have not yet read it," he said. 4ς I am not able to see for my tears ; but it is the narration of my child's sorrows; and when I have ended it, I will give it to you, my dear Lady, and to any other
whom you may wish. "Oh Mac Allain!" said Lady Avondale, " by every tie of gratitude and affection which you profess, and have shewn our family, do not let any one read this but myself:—do not betray Lord Glenarvon, He feels your sufferings: he more than shares them. For my sake I ask you this. Keep this transaction secret ; and, whatever may be suspected, let none know the truth.— Say: may I ask it?" Calantha's agitation moved him great¬ ly. He wept in bitter anguish. " The destroyer of my child/* he said, " will lead my benefactress into misery. Ah! my dear young Lady, how my heart bleeds for you." Impatiently, she turned away. " Will your hear my entreaties," she said. " You may command ; but the news of my child's death is spread : many are talking of it already: I cannot keep it secret/' " Only let not Lord Glenarvon's name appear." Mac Allain promised to do all in his powe to silence
every rumour; and, with the help of O'Kelly, he, in some measure succeeded. The story believed was, that Mr. Bucha¬ nan first had carried Alice with him to England, where she had fallen into poverty and vice. No further enquiry was made; but Lord Glenarvon himself confided to many, the secret which Ca¬ lantha was so eager to conceal. The narrative of Alice's sufferings may be omitted by those who wish not to peruse it. Lord Glenarvon desired to read it when Calantha had ended it. He also took the broach, and pressing it to his lips, appeared very deeply af¬ fected. After this for a short time he ab¬ sented himself from the castle. The following pages, written by Alice, were addressed to her only surviving parent. No comment is made on them ; no a- pology offered for their insertion. If passion has once subdued the power of reason, the misery and example of others never avail, nor would they even
were we certain of a similar fate. If every calamity we may perhaps deserve, were placed in view before us, we should not pause—we should not divert our steps. To love, in defiance of virtue is insanity, not guilt. To attempt the safety of its victims, were a generous but useless effort of unavailing interference. It is like a raging fever, or the tempest's fury—far beyond human aid to allay or restore. Calantha read, however, the his¬ tory ofher friend, and wept her fate. ALICES NARRATIVE. " My dear and honoured father, u To you I venture to address ¿his short history of my unhappy life, and if sufter¬ ings and pain can in part atone for my misconduct, 1 surely shall be forgiven by you ; but never, while existence, however miserable, is prolonged, never shall 1 forgive myself. Perhaps even now, the rumour of my disgrace has reached you,
and added still severer pangs to tliose you before endured. But oh! my father, I have in part, expiated my offences. Long and severe sorrows have followed me, since I left your roof, and none more heart rending—oh ! none to compare with the agony of being abandoned by him, for whom I left so much. You remember, my dear father, that, during the last year, which I passed at the castle» the attention which Mr. Buchanan had paid me, was so marked, that it occasioned the most serious apprehensions in Lady Margaret, on his account, Alas! 1 con¬ cealed from every one, the true cause of my encreasing melancholy ; and felt happy that the suspicions of my friends and protectors were thus unintentionally misled. 1 parted with Linden, nor told him my secret. Ì suffered the severest menaces end reproofs, without a murmur ; fori knew mjself guilty, though not of the crime ivith which I was charged. At Sir Everard St. (hire's 1 found means to Vol. II. Q
make my escape, or rather, the mad at¬ tachment of one far above me, removed every obstacle, which opposed his wishes and my own. 44 But it is time more particularly to ac¬ quaint you, my dear father, by what acci¬ dent I first met with Lord Glenarvon, to whom my fate was linked—whose attach¬ ment once made me blessed—whose incon¬ stancy has deprived me of every earthly hope. Do you remember once, when 1 ob¬ tained leave to pass the day with ι ou> that my brother, Garlace, took me with him in his boat, down the river Allan, and Roy and yourself were talking eagerly of the late affray which had taken piace in our village. I then pointed out to } ou the ruins of St. Alvin Priory, and asked you the history of its unhappy owners. That evening, when yourself and Roy were gone on shore, my brother Gar¬ lace fixing the sail, returned with me down the current with the wind : and as we passed near the banks from behind
the rocks, we heard soft low notes, such as they say spirits sing over the dead ; and as we turned by the winding shore, we soon perceived a youth who was throwing pebbles into the stream, and ever whilst he threw them, he conti¬ nued singing in that soft, siveet manner I have said. He spoke with us, and the melancholy sound of his voice, attracted us towards him. We landed close by the place near whicli he stood. He accom¬ panied us to the front of the castle ; but then entreating us to excuse his proceed¬ ing further, he retired ; nor told us who he was. From that day, I met him in secret. Oh ! that I had died before I had met with one so young, so beautiful, but yetso utterly lost. Nothing could save him : my feeble help could not reclaim him : it was like one who clasped a drowning man, and fell with him in the struggle: he had cast sin and misery upon his soul. Never will I soil these pages with the record of what he uttered; Q 2
his secrets shall be buried as in a sepul¬ chre; and soon, most soon shall I perish with them..................... Calantha paused in the narrative ; she gasped for breath ; and wiping away the tears which struggled in her ejes: " if he treated my friend w ith unkindness," she said, " dear as he has hitherto been to me, I will never behold him more." She then proceeded. "All enjoyment of life has ceased :—I am sick at heart. The rest of my story is but a record of evil. To exhibit the strug¬ gles of guilty love, is but adding to the crime already committed. I accuse him of no arts to allure : he did but follow the impulse of his feelings: he sought to save —he would have spared ше : but he had not strengih. Omy father, }ou know Lord Glenarvon—}ou have felt for him, all that the most grateful enthusiasm could feel ; and for the sake of the sou w iiom he restored to iou, iou must forgile him tlie ruin of an ungrateful chikl, who
rushed forward herself to meet it. Unused to disguise my sentiments, I did not at¬ tempt even to conceal them from him ; and when he told me I was dear, I too soon shewed him, how much more so he was to me. For when the moment of parting for ever came, wben I saw my Lord, as I thought, for the last time, you must not judge me—you cannot even in fauc) imagine, all Iat that hour endured— 1 left my country, my home—I gave up every hope on earth or heaven for him. Heaven in mercy pardon me, for I have suffered cruelly ; and you, my father, when iou read these pages, bless me, forgive mc. Turn not from me, for you know not the struggles of my heart— \ou can never know ivhat I have en¬ dured/' Calantha breathed with greater difii¬ culty; and paused again. She paced to and fro within her chamber, in strong agitation of mind. She then eagerly re- Umw} io peruse the Ïew remaining* pages,
written by her miserable, her infatuated friend.—" She was not guilty," she cried* " The God of Heaven will not, does not condemn her. Oh she was spotless as innocence compared with me." " There were many amongst Lord Gle¬ narvon's servants who were acquainted with my secret. Through every trouble and some danger I followed him; nor boast much of håving felt no woman's fear ; for who that loves can fear. I will not dwdi upon these moments of my life: they were the only hours of joy, which brightened over a career of mise¬ ry and gloom. Whilst loved by the object of one's entire devotion—whilst sur¬ rounded by gaiety and amusement, the voice of conscience js seldom heard; and, I will confess it, at this time I fancied myself happy. I was Glenarvon's mis¬ tress; and 1 knew not another wish upon earth. In the course of the three years, passed ivith him in England and in Italy, 1 became mother of a child, and Clare,
my littie son, was dear to his father. But after his birth, he for.sook me/' We were in England at the time, at the house of one of his friends, when he first intimated to me the necessity of his leaving me. He had resolved, he said, to return to Florence, and I ivas in too weak a state of health to permit of myaccompanying him. I entreated, I im¬ plored for permission to make the attempt. He paused for some time, and then, as if unable to refuse rne, he consented—reluc¬ tantly, I will own it; but still he said that I should go. He never appeared more fond, more kind than the evening before his departure. That evening, I supped with him and his friends. He seemed tired ; and asked me more than once if I ivould not go to rest. His ser¬ vant, a countryman of ours, by name O'Kelly, brought me a glass ivith some¬ thing in it, which he bade me drink ; but 1 would not. Lord Glenarvon came to me, and bade me take it, u Ifit were poison/*' Q 4
1 said fondly, Cť I would take it from iour hands, so that I might but die upon your bosom." " It is not poison," he said, 44 Alice, but what many a fine laely in London cannot rest without. You will need repose ; you are going a long jour¬ ney, to-morrow ; drink it love ; and mayest thou sleep in peace." I took the draught and slumbered even whilst re¬ posing in his arms.................. Oh my father, he left me. — I awoke to hear that he was gone—to feel a misery í never can describe. From that day, I fell into a dangerous illness. I knew not w hat I said or did. I heard on recovering, that my lord liad taken another mistress, and was about to marry ; that he had provided for me with money ; that he had left me my child. I resolved to follow ; —I recovered in that hope alone. 1 went over to Ireland :—the gates ofthe abbey were shut against me. Mr. Hard Head, a friend of my lord's whom I once named to iou. met me as I stood an helpless
outcast, in my олуп country ; he spoke to me with kindness. ï thought he had been my friend butit proved otherwise. ï madly sought to enter the gates which were closed against me.—O'Kelly passed me :—1 knelt to him.

I will sail to-morrow, if I but reach Cork.—I have proved the ruin of a whole family.—I hear Linden has enlisted with the rioters. A friend of his met me and spoke to me of him, and of you my father. He promised to keep my secret: yet if he betrays me, I shall be far away before you hear of my fate.—I grieve for the troubles of my country.—All the mal¬ contents flock together from every side to Belfont. Lord Glenarvon hears their grievances:—his house is the asylum of the unfortunate:—I alone am excluded from its walls.—Farewell to Ireland, and to my dear father.—I saw my brother Garlacepass; he went through the court to St, Alvin, with many other young men.

Tuesday nigbt, Belfont. 44 I walked to Belfont ;—and now the bitterness of death is passed.—I have seen that angel face once again—I have heard that siveetest voice, and I can lie down and die ; for I am happy now. — He passed me ; but oh ! bitter 5 bitter sight to me, he turned from me, and looked upon another. They tell me it was my preserver and benefactress: they say it was Lady Avondale. lie looked proud of her, and happy in himself.—I am glad he looked happy ; but yet I thought he turned his ey es on me, and gazed upon me once so sadly, as if in this mournful countenance and altered form, he traced the features of her whom he had once loved so well.—But no—it could not be :
—he did not know me ; and I will see him again. If he will but say, " Alice: God bless you," I shall die satisfied.— And if my child still lives, and comes again to you, so cold, so pale—take him to your heart, dear father, and forgive his mother— ï am ill, and cannot write. They watch me ; my pencil is almost worn out, and they will give me no other. —I have one favor to ask, and it is this : —when 1 came to Dublin, I gave all the money I had to buy this broach— take it to Lady Avondale. They say she is very good, and perhaps, when she hears how ill I am, she will pardon my faults, and give it for me to Lord Glenar¬ von.—I shall wait for him every day in the same v/ood, and who knows but I may see him again................... And Alice did see him again ;— and she did kneel to him ;—and she received from his hands the relief he thought she craved;—and the unexpected kindness broke her heart.—She died ;——and she
was buried in the church near Belfont. There was a white stone placed upon her grave, and her old father went daily there and wept ; and he had the tree that now grows there planted ; and it was railed around, that the cattle and wild-goats, might not destroy it." " Take the band from my head," said Calantha. "Give me air. This kills me........" She visited the grave of Alice: she met Mac Allain returning from it, they uttered not one word as they passeo each other. The silence was more terrible than a thousand lamentations.... Lady Margaret sent for Calantha. She looked ill, and was much agitated. " It is time," said Lady Margaret, to speak to you, " The folly of your conduct,"— 44 Oh it is past folly," said Calantha weeping. Lady Margaret looked upon her with contempt. 4i How weak, and· how absurd is this. Whatever your er¬ rors* need you thus confess them ? and
whatever your feelings, wherefore betray them to the senseless crowd ?" 44 Calantha," said Lady Margaret in a hollow tone, 4ť I cau feel as deeply as yourself Nature implanted passions in me, ivhich are not common to all ; but mark thedifferencebetiveen us :—a strong mind dares at least conceal the ravages the tempest of its fury makes. It as¬ sumes that character to the udgår herd which it knows is alone capable of im¬ posing restraint upon it. Eiery one sus¬ pects me, but none dare reproach me. You, on the contrary, are the butt against which every censure is levelled: thy know that your easy nature can pardon malignity and the hand that insults you to-day will crave your kindness to-mor¬ row. When 3 ou are offended, with pue¬ rile impotence and passionate violence, you exhibit the effects of your momen¬ tary rage ; and by breaking of tables, or by idle words, shew your own weakness. Thus you are ever subdued by the
very exhibition of your passions. And now that you love, instead of rendering him you love your captive, you throw yourself entirely in his powei, and will deeply 4 rue the confidence you have shewn. Has he not already betrayed you. You know not Glenarvon. His heart, black as it is, I have read and studied. Whatever his imagination idolizes, be¬ comes with him a sole and entire interest. At this moment he would fly with you to the extremity of the earth, and when he awakes from his dream, he vvill laugh at you, and at himself for his absurdity. Trust not that malignant and venomed tongue. The adder that slumbers in the bosom of him who saved it, recovers, and bites to the heart the fool that trusted it. Warned on all sides, beware ! and if no¬ thing else can save you, learn at least who this Glenarvon is, what he has done. Heis ......" " Lord Glenarvon," said a servant : at that very instant the door opened, and he
entered. He started at seeing Calantha, who, greatly embarrassed, durst not meet his eyes. It seemed to her, that to have heard him spoken of with unkindness was a sort of treachery to an attachment like their's. Lady Margaret's words had wounded and grieved her ; but they had not shaken her trust; and when she looked upon him and saw that beautiful countenance, every doubt left her. Before she quitted the room, she observed how¬ ever, with surprise, the smile of enchant¬ ing sweetness, the air of kindness, even of interest, with which Lady Margaret received him ; and one jealous fear cross¬ ing her fancy, she lingered as if re¬ proachfully enquiring what meant these frequent visits to her Aunt. Glenarvon, in a moment, read the doubt :—" Yes," he cried, following her, " you are right : if ever I have Joved another with idolatrv it was thy Aunt ; but be assured I loved io vain. And now Calantha, I would agree, whilst existence were prolonged,
to see her no more, sooner than cause you one hour's uneasiness. Be satisfied at least, that she abhors me." " None of this whispering," said Lady Margaret, smiling gently, at least in my presence. " I never loved before as now," said Glenarvon, aloud. " Never," said Lady Margaret, with an incredulous and scornful smile. "No," said Glenarvon, still gazing on Calantha ; " all is candour, in¬ nocence, frankness in that heart ; the one I idolized, too long, was like my own—ut¬ terly corrupted." "You wrong the lady," said Lady Margaret carelessly. " She had her errors, I acknowledge ; but the cold¬ ness of Glenarvon's heart, its duplicity, its malignity, is unrivalled." Calantha, deeply interested and agitated, could not quit the room, Glenarvon had seized her hand; his eyes, fixed upon her, seemed alone intent on penetrating her feelings: she burst into tears: he ap* proached her. " You shall not tear her from me," he said, to Lady Margaret,
i She goes with me by Heaven ; she is bound to me by the most sacred oaths : we are married ; are we not dearest ?" c * Have you confessed to her/* said La¬ dy Margaret contemptuously ? <c Every thing/* " She loves you no doubt the better for your crimes." " She loves me, I do believe it, in defiance of them," said Glenarvon, in an impassioned tone, " and may the whole world, if she wishes it, know that by every art, by every power I possess, I have sought her : provided they also know/* he con¬ tinued with a sneer, " that I have won her. She may despise me ;—you may teach her to hate ; but of this be assured —you cannot change me. Never, never was I so enslaved. Calantha, my soul, look on me.—Glenarvon kneels to you. I would even appear humble—weak if it but gratify your vanity ; for humility to you is now my glory—my pride/* " Calantha/* said Lady Margaret, in a protecting tone, " are you not vain ?'
" This Glenarvon has been the lover of many hundreds ; to be thus preferred is flattering. Sball I tell you, my dear niece, in what consists your superiority ? You are not as fair as these ; you are not perhaps as pure ; but you are loved more because your ruin will make the misery of a whole family, and your dis¬ grace will cast a shade upon the only man whom Glenarvon ever acknowledged as superior to himself— superior both in mind and person. This, child, is your potent charm—your sole claim to his ad¬ miration. Shew him some crime of greater magnitude, point out to him an object more worth the trouble and paiu of renderinge miserable, and he will inmediately abandon you." Glenarvon cast his eyes fiercely upon Lady Margaret. The disdain of that glance silenced her, she even came for¬ ward with a view to conciliate : and af¬ fecting an air of playful humility—" I spoke but from mere jealousy," she said. u What woman of my age coukl bear to
see another so praised, so worshipped in her presence. It is os if the future heir of his kingdom were extolled in presence of the reigning sovereign. Pardon me, Glenarvon. I know, I see you love her." " By my soul I do ;" and look, he cried exultingly, " with what furious rage the little tygress gazes on you. She will harm you. I fear," he continued laugh¬ ing, " if I do not carry her from your presence. Come then Calantha : we shall meet again," he said, turning back and pausing as they quitted Lady Margaret's apartment. The tone of his voice, and his look, as he said this was peculiar: nor did he fbr some moments regain his composure. Lady Margret spoke a few w ords to Calantha that evening. " I am in the power of this man," she said, " and you soon will be. He is cold, hard and cruel. Do any thing ; but, if you have any re¬ gard for yourself, go not with him." " I know hps hist згу, his errors/' said Ca-
lantha ; " but he feels deeply." " You know him," said Lady Margaret, with a look of scornftd superiority: " as he wish¬ es you to believe him, he even may exaggerate,were that possible, his crimes, the more to interest and surprise. You know him, Calantha, as one infatuated and madly in love can imagine the idol of its devotion. But there will come a time when you will draw his character with darker shades, and taking from it all the romance and mystery of gnilty see him, as I do, a cold malignant heart, wliich the light of genius, self-love and passion, have warmed at intervals; but which, in all the detail of every-day life, sinks into hypocrisy and baseness. Crimes have been perpetrated in the heat of pas¬ sion, even by noble minds; but Glenarvon is little, contemptible and mean v He unites the malice and petty vices of a wo¬ man, to the perfidy and villany of a man. You do not know him as I do/* " From this hour," said Calantha, in*
dignatioıı burning in her bosom, α we never more, Lady Margaret, will inter¬ change one word w ith each other. I re¬ nounce you entirely ; and think yon all that you have dared to say against my loved, my adored Glenarvon." Lady Margaret sought Calantha before she retired for the night, and laughed at her for her conduct. 44 Your rage, your absurdity but excite my contempt. Ca¬ lantha, how puerile this violence appears to me; above all, how useless. Now, from the earliest day of my remembrance, can any one say of me that they beheld me forgetful of my ow r n dignity, from the violence of my passions. Yet I feel, think you not,and have made others feel. Your childish petulance but operates against yourself. What are threats, blows and mighty words from a woman? When I am offended, I smile ; and when I stab deepest, then I can look as if I had for¬ given. Your friends talk of you witli kindness or unkindness as it suits their
fancy : some love ; some pity, but none fear Calantha. Your very servant*, though you boast of their attachment, despise and laugh at you. Your husband caresses you as a mistress, but of your conduct he takes not even heed. What is the affection of the crowd ? what the love of man? make yourself feared! Then, if you are not esteemed, at least you are out¬ wardly honoured, and that reserve, that self-controul, which you never sought even to obtain, keeps ordinary minds in alarm. Many hate me ; but who dares even name me without respect. Yourself, Calantluij eveu at this moment, are ready to fall upon my bosom and weep, because I have offended you. Come child—your hand. I fain would save you, but iou must hear much that pains you, before I cau hope even to succeed. Only remem¬ ber: 'si vous vous faites brebis le loup vous mangera.' " She smiled as she said this, and Calantha, half offended, gave her Ihe hand for which she solicited. Vol. IL К
CHAPTER XXXIV, Mrs. Seymour was now extremely un¬ well, the least agitation was dreaded for her. Calantha was constantly enquiring after her ; but could not bear to remain long in her presence. Yet at night she watched by her, when she did not know of it ; and though she had ceased to pray for herself, she prayed for h^r. Could it be supposed that, at such a mo¬ ment, any personal feelings would engage Calantha to add to her uneasiness. Alas ! she sought in the last resources of guilt to alleviate every apprehension she might cherish ; she feigned a calm she felt not; she made every promise she meant not to fulfil ; she even spoke of Glenarvon with some severity for his conduet to Alice ; and when Mrs. Seymour rejoiced at her escape, she pressed her hand and
wept. Lady Margaret, from the day of their quarrel, cold and stern, ever arose to leave the room when Calantha entered it, and Mrs. Seymour, seeing resentment kindling in her niece's eye, in the gentlest manner, urged her to bear with her aunt's humour. Lord Glenarvon had not written to Ca¬ lantha for some days, he had left the castle : and she laboured under the most painful suspense. The narrative of Alice's sufferings was still in her possession. At length he sent for it. " My Calantha," he said, in a letter she received from him, " My Calantha, 1 have not heard from you, and my misery is the greater, as I fear that you are resolved to see me no more. I wish for the narrative in your possession ; I know the impression it must make ; and strange as it may ap¬ pear, I almost rejoice at it. It will spare you much future sorrow ; and it can scarce add one pang to what I already suffer. Had you accompanied me, it R 2
was, I will now acknowledge, my firm resolve to have devoted every moment of my life to your happiness—to have seen, to have thought, to have lived, but for you alone. I had then dared to presume, that the excess of my attachment would remunerate you, for all the sacrifices you might be compelled to make ; that the fame of Glenarvon would hide, from the eyes of a censorious ivorld, the stigma of disgrace, which must, I fear, involve you ; and that, at all events, in some other country, we might live alone for each other.—The dream is past ; you have undeceived me ; your friends require it : be it, as you and as they desire. I am about to quit Ireland. If you would see me before I go, it must be on the instant. What are the wrongs of my country to me? Let others, who have wealth and power, defend her :— let her look to English policy for protection ; to English justice for liberty and redress. Without a friend, even as I first set foot upon these shores, I now abandon them."
" Farewell, Calantha. Thou art the last link which yet binds me to life. It was for thy sake—for thine alone, that I vet forbore. It is to save thee, that I now rush onward to meet my fate: grieve not for ine. I stood a solitary being till 1 knew you. I ean encounter evils when 1 feel that I alone shall suffer. Let me not think that I have destroyed you. But for me, you might have flourished happy and secure. О why would you tempt the fate of a ruined man?—I en¬ treat you to send the papers in your pos¬ session. I am prepared for the worst. But if you could bring yourself to be¬ lieve the agony of my mind at this mo¬ ment, you ivould still feel for me, even though in all else chilled and changed.— Farewell, dearest of all earthly beings— my soul's comforter and hope, farewell." " í vvill go with thee Glenarvon, even sliould mj fate exceed Alice's in misery —I never will forsake thee." A servant entered at that moment, n 3
and told her that Lord Glenarvon was below—waiting for the answer. 44 Take these papers," said Calantha, and with them she enclosed a ring which had been found upon Alice : 44 Give them yourself to Lord Glenarvon : I cannot see him.—You may betray me, if it is your inclination ; I am in your power ,·, but to save is not. Therefore, do not attempt it. ..." The attendant had no difficult task in executing this errand. She met Lord Glenarvon himself, at the door of the library. Upon alighting from his horse, he had enquired for Lady Margaret Buchanan ; before she was prepared to receive him, the papers were delivered into his hands; he gave them to O'Kelly ; and after pay¬ ing a shorter visit to Lady Margaret than at first he had intended, he returned to the inn at Belfont, to peruse them. First however he looked upon the broach, and taking up the ring, he pressed it to his lips and sighed, for he remembered it
and her to whom it had been given. Upon this emerald ring, the words : 4 Eterna fede" had been inscribed. He had placed it upon his little favourite's hand, in token of his fidelity, when first he had told her of his love ; time had worn off and defaced the first impression ; and 4t Eterno dolor" had been engraved by her in its place—thus telling in few words the whole history of love— 44 the im¬ mensity of its promises—the cruelty of its disappointment." Calantha was preparing to answer Gle¬ narvon's letter : her whole soul was ab¬ sorbed in grief, when Sophia entered and informed her that the Admiral was ar¬ rived. It was, she knew, his custom to come and go without much ceremony % but his sudden presence, and at such a moment, overpowered her. Perhaps too, her husband might be with him ! she fell : Sophia called for assistance, 44 Good Heavens! what is the matter ?" she said, 44 You have just kilt my lady," said the n 5
nurse ; " but she'll be better presently : let her take her way—let her take her u ay " And before Calantha could com¬ pose herself, Sir Kichard was in her room. She soon saw by his hearty open countenance, that he was perfectly igno¬ rant of all that had occurred ; and to keep him so, was now her earnest endea¬ vour. But she ivas unused to deceit : all her attempts at it were forced : it was not in her nature; and pride alone, not bet¬ ter feeling prevented its existence.
CHAPTER XXXVII. Sir Richard apologized for his abrupt appearance: and told Calantha that he had been with Lord Avondale to visit his relations at Mon teith, ivhere he had left him employed, as he said, from morning till night, ivith his troops in quelling dis¬ turbances and ad min isteri ngj ustice, which he performed but ill, having, as he ex¬ pressed it, too kind a heart. He then as¬ sured her that her .usband had promised to meei hirn on the present day atthe cas¬ tle, and enquired of her if she knew where¬ fore his return had been delayed. She in reply informed him, that he had no intention of joining thein, and even pro¬ duced his last cold letter, in which he told her that she might visit him at Allen¬ ivate!·, at the end of the month, with the children, if all continued tranquil 'm r 5
those quarters. She spoke this in an em¬ barrassed manner; her colour changed repeatedly ; and her whole appearance was so dissimilar from that to which the Admiral had been accustomed, that he couid not but observe it. Sir Richard, håving with seeming care¬ lessness, repeated the words, " He'll be here this week, that's certain," now ad¬ dressed himself to the children, telling Harry Mowbrey the same, " And per¬ haps he'll bring you toys." " He'il bring himself," said the child, " and thaťs better " " Right, my gallant boy," re¬ turned the Admiral ; "and you are a fine little fellow for saying so." Thus encou¬ raged, the child continued to prattle. " I want no toys now, uncle Richard. See I have a sword, and a seal too. Will you look at the impression:—the harp means Ireland : ť Independence* is the motto ; we have no crown ; we want no kings/'* " And who gave you this seal ?" said Sir Richard, fiercely. " Clarence
Glenarvon," replied the boy, with a smile of proud exultation. " D ------ n your sword and your seal," said the Admiral. " I like no rebel chiefs, not 1 ;" and he turned away, " Are you angry with me, uncle Richard ?" "No, I am sick, child—I have the head ache." The Ad¬ miral had observed Calantha's agitation, and noted the boy's answers ; for he left the room abruptly, and was cold and cross the rest of the day. Colonel Donallan having invited the whole family and party, to his seat at Cork, Lady Trelawney and the rest of the guests now left the castle. It was possibly owing to this circumstance that the Admiral, who was not a remarkably keen observer, had opportunity and lei¬ sure to watch Calantha's conduct. In a moment she percei veil the suspicion that occurred; but as he was neither very refined, nor very sentimental, it occurred without one doubt of her ac¬ tual guilt, or one desire to save her from
its consequences:—it occurred with hor¬ ror, abhorrence and contempt. Unable to conceal the least thing or to moderate his indignation, heresolved, without de¬ lay, to seize the first opportunity of taxing her with her ill conduct. In the mean time she felt hardened and indiferent; and, instead of attempting to conciliate, by haughty looks and a spirit of defiance, she rendered herself hateful to every observer. That compassion, which is sometimes felt and cherished for a young offender, could not be felt for her ; nor did she wish to inspire it. Desperate and insensible, she gloried in the cause of her degradation ; and the dread of causing her aunťs death, and casting disgrace upon her husband's name, alone retained her one hour from Glenarvon. On the very day of the Admiral's ar¬ rival, he heard enough concerning Calan¬ tha to excite his most vehement indigna¬ tion ; and at the hour ofdinner, therefore, as he passed her he called her by a name
too horrible to repeat. Stung to the soul, she refused to enter the dining- room ; and. hastening with fury to her own apartment, gave vent to the storm of passion by which she was wholly over¬ powered. There, unhappily, she found a letter from her lover—all kindness, all warmth. 4 ' One still there is," she said, 44 who loves, ivho feels for the guilty, the fallen Calantha." Every word she read, and compared with the cold neg¬ lect of others, or their severity and con¬ tempt. There was none to fold her to their bosom, and draw her back from certain perdition. She even began to think with Glenarvon, that they wished her gone. Some feelings of false honor, too, inclined her to imagine that she ought to leave a situation, for which she now must consider herself wholly unfit. But there was one voice which still re¬ called her :—it was her child's. " My boy will awake, and find me gone—he shall never have to reproach his mother," And
she stood uncertain how to act. Mrs. Sey¬ mour, to her extreme astonishment, was the only person who interrupted these re¬ flections. She was the last she had expected to do so. She had read in the well-known lineaments of Calantha's face :—that face which, as a book, she had perused from infancy, some desperate project :—the ir¬ ritation, the passionate exhibition of grief was past—she was calm. Sophia, at Mrs. Seymour's request, had therefore written to Calantha. She now gave her the letter. But it was received with sullen pride :— " Read this, Lady Avondale," she said, and left the room. Calantha never looked at her, or she might have seen that she was agitated ; but the words^—" Read this, Lady Avondale," repressed all emo¬ tion in her. It was long before she could bring herself to open Sophia's letter. A servaut entered with dinner for her. " The Admiral begs you will drink a glass of wine," he said. She made no answer ; but desired her maid to take it
away, and leave her. She did not even perceive that Mac Allain, who was the bearer of this message, was in tears. Sophia's letter was full of common¬ place truisms, and sounding periods^— a sort of treatise upon vice, beginning ivith a retrospect or Calantha's past Jife, and ending* with a cold jargon of worldly considerations. A few words, written in another hand, at the conclusion, affected her more :—they were from her aunt, Mrs. Seymour. 44 You talk of leaving us, of braving misfortunes, Lady Avondale," she said ; 44 you do not contemplate, you cannot conceive, the evils you thus deride. I know ; yes, well 1 know, you will not be able to bear up under them. Ah i be¬ lieve me, Calantha, guilt will make the proudest spirit sink, and your courage will fail you at the moment of trial. Why then seek it ?—My child, time flies ra¬ pidly, and it may no longer be permitted you to return and repent. You now fly from reflection ; but it will overtake you
when too late to recall the emotions of Virtue. Ah ! remember the days of your childhood ; recollect the high ideas you had conceived of honor and purity —what disdain you felt for those who w illingly deviated from the line of duty : —how true, how noble, how just were all your feelings. You have forsaken all ; and you began by forsaking him who created and protected you ! W hat won¬ der, then, that haviig left your religion and your God, you have abandoned every other tie that held you back from evil ï Say, where do you mean to check your course? Are you already guilty in more than thought ?—No, no ; I will never believe it ; but yet, even if this were so, pause before you cast public dishonor upon your husband and innocent chil¬ dren. Oh î repent, repent, it is not yet too late." 44 It is too late," said Calantha, spring¬ ing up, and tearing the letter: 44 itis too late ;" and nearly suffocated with the
agony of her passionate grief. She gasped for breath. " Oh ! that it were not. I cannot—I dare not stay to meet the eyes uf an injured husband, to see him un¬ suspicious, and know that I have betrayed him. This is too hard to bear :—a death of torture is preferable to a continuance of this ; and then to part, my aunt knows not, nor cannot even conceive, the tor¬ ture of that word. She never felt what I do—she knows not what it is to love, and leave .... These words comprise every thing, the extremes of ecstacy and agony. Oh ! who can endure it. They may tear my heart to pieces ; but never hope that I wijl consent to leave Glenar¬ von." The conciousness of these feelings, the agitation of her mind, and the dread of Lord Avondale's return, made her meet Sophia, who now entered her apartment with some coldness. The scene that fol¬ lowed need not be repeated. All that a cold and common-place friend can urge,
to upbraid, vilify and humiliate, was ut¬ tered by Miss Seymour ; and all in vain. She left her therefore, with much indig¬ nation ; aud, seeing that her mother was preparing to enter the apartment she had quitted: " O! go not to her," she said ; " you will find only a hardened sinner ; you had best leave her to herself. Mv к. ш friendship and patience are tired out at last ; I have forborne much ; but 1 can endure no more. Oh 1 she is quite lost." " She is not lost, she is not har¬ dened," said Mrs. Seymour, much agi¬ tated. ·' She is my own sister's child; she will vet hear me." " Calantha," said Mrs. Seymour, ad¬ vancing, " my child" and she claspsed her to her bosom. She would have turned from her, but she could not. " I am not come to speak to you on any un¬ pleasant subject," she said. " 1 cannot speak myself, answered Calantha, hiding her face, not to behold her aunt: " all I ask of vou is not to hate me ; and God
reward you for your kindness to me : I can say no more ; but I feel much." " You will not leave us, dear child ?" " Never, never, unless I am driven from you—unless I am thought unworthy of remaining here." " You will be kind to your husband, ivhen he returns—you will not grieve him." "Oh! no, no: 1 alone will suffer; I will never inflict it upon him ; but I cannot see him again ; he must not return ; you must keep him from me. I never-----" " Pause, my Calantha: make no rash resolves. I came here not to agitate, orto reproach. 1 ask but one promise, no other will I ever exact :—you will not leave us." This change of manner in her aunt produced the deepest impression upon Lady Avon- dale. She looked, too, so lile her mother, at the moment, that Calantha thought it had been her. She gave her her hand: she could not speak. " And did they tell me she was hardened ?" said Mrs. Seymour*
*' I knew it could not be : my child, my own Calantha, will never act with cruelty towards those who love her. Say only the single words, 44 1 will not leave you," and I will trust you without one fear." 44 1 will not leave you!" said Calantha, weeping bitterly, and throwing herself upon her aunt's bosom. 4t If it break my heart, I will never leave you, unless driven from these doors !" Little more ivas said by either of them. Mrs. Sey¬ mour was deeply affected, and so was Calantha, After she had quitted her, not an hour had elapsed, when Sir Richard, without preparation, entered. His presence stifled every good emotion—froze up every tear. Calantha stood before him with a look of contempt and defiance, he could not bear. Happily for her, he was called away, and she retired early to bed. 4t That wife of Avondale's has the greatest share of impu¬ dence," said the Admiral, addressing the
company, at large, when he returned from her room, 4C that ever it was my fortune to meet. One would think, to see her, that she was the person injured ; and that we were all the aggressors. Why, she has the spirit of the very devil in her ! but I will break it, I warrant you."
CHAPTER XXXVIII. The next morning*, regardless of the presence of the nurses and the children, who were in Lady Avondale's apartment : regardless, indeed, of any consideration, but that which rage and indignation had justly excited, the Admiral again entered Calantha's room, and in a high exulting tone, informed her that he had written to hasten her husband's return. " As to Avondale d'ye see," he continued, " he is a d ------ d fine fellow, with none of your German sentiments, not he: and he will no more put up with these goings on, than I shall ; nor shall you pallaver him over : for depend upon it, I will open his eyes, unless from this very moment you change your conduct. Yes, my Lady Calantha, you look a little surprised, I see, at hearing good English spoken to
you ; but I am not one who can talk all that jargon of sensibility, they prate round me here. You have the road open ; you are young, and may mend yet ; and if you do, I will think no more of the past. And as to you, Mrs. Nurse, see that these green ribbands be döfted. I prohibit Lord Mowbrey and Lady Anna¬ bel from wearing them. I hate these re¬ bellious party colours, 1 am for the King, and old England ; and a plague on the Irish marauders, and my Lord Gle¬ narvon at the head of them—who will not take ле, let me tell iou, ladv fair, for all your advances. 1 heard him say so mjself, a}e, and laugh too, when the Duke told him to be off, which he did, though it was in a round about way ; for they like here, to press much talk into what might be said in a score of words. So you need not look so mighty proud ; for I shall not let you stir from these apartments, do you see, till my nephew comes; and then, God mend you, or take
you, for we will not bear with these pro¬ ceedings, not we of the navy, whatever your land folks may do." * s Sir Richard," said Calantha, " you may spare yourself and me this unkind¬ ness,—I leave this house immediatelv. 1 leave your family from this hour ; and 1 will die in the very streets sooner than remain here. Take this," she said, throw¬ ing the marriage ring from her hand ; " and tell your nephew I never will see him more: tell hitn, ifit is your pleasure, that I love another, and had rather be a slave in his service, than Lord Avondale's wife. 1 ever hated that name, and now I consider it with abhorrence/* u Your Ladyship's words are big and mighty," cried Sir Richartl ; 4I but while this goodly arm has a sinew, and this most excellent door has a key, you shall not stir from hence." As he yet spoke, he advanced to the door ; but she, darting hefore him, with a celerity he had not expected, left him, exclaiming as she
went, * 4 jou have driven me to this : tell them von have done it". · · ........... **«...., ».·#«*···*·*···■*·*****··* In vain the Admiral urged every шш lie met to pursue Calantha. The moment had been seized, mid no power can withstand, no after attempt can re¬ gain the one favorable moment that is thus snatched from fate. The castle pre¬ sented a scene of the utmast confusion and distress. Miss Seymour was indig¬ nant ; the servants were iu commotion ; the greatest publicity was given to the event from the ill judged indiscretion of the Admiral. Mrs. Seymour alone was kept in ignorance ; the Duke coldly, in reply to the enquiry of what was to be done, afiirmed tbat no step should be taken, unless, of herself, the unhappyCa- lantha returned to seek the pardon and protection of those friends whom she had so rashly abandoned, and so cruelly mis¬ used. Yet, notwithstanding the prohi- Vol. IL S
buion. even place was searched, even measure to save was thought of, and all without success. Sir Richard then sat down with Anna¬ bel in his arms, and the little boy by his s^ide, crying more piteously than the nurse v. ho stood opposite encreasing the general disturbance, bv her loud and ill-timed lamentations. " lf my Lord had not been the best of husbands, there would have been some excuse for my Lady," " None, nurse—none whatever," sobbed forth Sir Richard, in a voice scarcely audible, between passion and vexation. ** She was a good mother, poor Lady : that I will say for her." " She was a d ------ d w ife though," cried Sir Richard ; " and that I must say for her." After which, the children joining, the cries and sobs were renewed by the nurse, and Sir Richard, with more violence than at first. " I never thought it would have come to this," said the nurse, first recovering.
4 Lord, ma am, I knew it would end ill, when I saw those d ----- å green ribbands. Who would have thought such a pretty looking gentleman would have turned out such a villain !" '* He is no gentle¬ man at all," said Sir Richard angrily. 4 * He is a rebel, an outcast. Shame upon him." And then again the nurse's cries checked his anger, and he wept more audibly than before. fci Would vou believe it, after all your kindness," said Sophia, entering her mother's room, " Calantha is gone." At tlic words, " she is gone," Mrs. Seymour fainted ; nordid she for some time recover ; hut with returning sense, when she saw not Calantha, when asking repeatedly for her, she received evasive answers ; terror again overcame her—she was deeply and violently agitated. She sent for the chil¬ dren ; she clasped them to her bosom. They smiled upon her ; and that look, was a pang beyond all others of bitter- ΓΙ uri
nem. The Admiral, in tears, approached her ; lamented his interference ; yet spoke with just severity of the offender. 44 If I know her heart, she will yet re¬ turn," said Mrs. Seymour. 44 She will never more return," replied Sophia. 44 How indeed will she dare appear, after such a public avowal of her sentiments— such a flagrant breach of every sacred duty. Oh, there is no excuse for the mother who thus abandons her children —-for the wife who stamps dishonour on a husband's fame—for the child that dares to disobey a father's sacred will !" 44 Sophia, beware. Judge not of others— judge not ; for the hour of temptation may come to all. Oh judge her not," said Mrs. Seymour, weeping bitterly ; 44 for she will yet return." Towards evening Mrs. Seymour again enquired for Calantha. They told her she had not been heard of; her agitation proved too well the doubt she entertained.
41 Send again," sbe continually said, «and her hand, which Lady Margaret held in hers, became cold and trembling. They endeavoured to comfort her ; but what comfort was there left ? They tried to detain her in her own apartment ; but the agony of her sufferings was too great; —her feeble frame—her wasted form, could ill endure so great a shock. The Duke, affected beyond measure, endea¬ voured to support her. 4t Pardon her, receive her with kindness," said Mrs. Seymour, looking at him, i4 1 know she will not leave you thus: I feel that she must return," 44 We will receive her without one reproach," said the Duke. * ; I, too, feel secure that she will return." % * I know her heart: she can never leave us thus. Go yourself, Altamonte," said Lady Margaret.— u Let me go," 4i Wliere would you seek her?" u At Lord Gle¬ narvon's," said Mrs. Seymour, faintly. 44 Oh ! she is not there," said the Duke, s 3
c< She never will act in a manner we 1111Ы not pardon,'* Mrs. Seymour trembled at these words—she was ¡II, most ill ; ami they laid her upon the bed, and watched in silence and agony around her. The Duke repeated sternly : ï trust sl.e is not gone to Lord Glenarvon— all else 1 can forgive.

the mountains But the Roman plunderer had the activity of his countrymen On the very night of my receiving the summons, I was roused from sleep by the outcries of the re taniera, who m that season of heat lay in the open air round the palace. I started from my bed only to see with astonishment the court¬ yards filled with cavalry, gaJoping in pursu.t of the few peasants who still fought for their Eord There was no time to be lost, the torches were il ready in the hands of the soldiery, and I must be taken, or burnt alive Constantius was instantly at my s de I ordered the trumpet to be sounded on the lulls, and we rushed out to¬ gether, speai in hand The Romans, alarmed by resistance, where they had counted upon e ipture without a blow, fell back The interval was fatal Their retreat was intercepted by the whole body of the peasantry, effectually loused The scythe and reaping hook were deadly weapons to horsemen cooped up between walls, and in midnight No efforts of mine could stop the havoc, when once the fury of my people was roused A few escaped, who had

But the painful part of the moral was sp íred us The young Roman s wou ids were stanched and in an enemy and α Roman 1 found tht means of paying a debt of grat iude His îppearance among the troops sent to seize me had been only a result of his anxiety to save tho father of his friends He had a cidentaliy dbcovtrei the nature of the order and hoped to anticipate its exe ution But he arrived only in time to be involved in the confusion of the flight Pursued and wounded by the pe ι saiitr/ he lost hb way and but for the gene rous perseveranoe of Constantius lie must have died The public information which he brought was of the most important kind In the Roman (ouncils the utter subjugation of Judea wt*> resolved on The lust spark of national mde p a ndence was to be extinguished though m the blood of the last natne ι Roman colony established in our lands tho Roman worship introduced and Jerusalem profaned by a statue of Nero, and sacrifices to him is α L,od, on the

' The sole hope of success " said he, " must depend on rousing the popul ir mmd The Roman troops are not to be beaten by any regul ir army in the woild If we attack thein on the ordinary principles ot war, the result can only be defeat, slaughter m dungeons, and deeper slavery If the nation can be roused, numbers may prevail over discipline, variety of attacks may distraci science, the desperate boldness of the insurgents may at length ex¬ haust the Roman fortnnde, and a glorious peace will then restore the country to that inde pendence for which my hfe would be a glad aud ready sacrifice But you must first have the people with you, and for that purpose you must have the leaders of the people------" " What' interrupted I. " must we fir"t min¬ gle m the cabals of Jerusalem, and rouse the frigid debaters and disputers of the Sanhedum mto action ? Are we first to conciliate the irre¬ concilable, to soften the furious, to purify the eorrupt' If the Romans are to be our tyrants till we can teach patriotism to faction , we may as well build the dungeon at once, for to the

them to a sense, that there is even a Heaven above them ' " Yet we must have them with us, said Constantius, ' fo we must have ill Univer sality is the spirit of au insurrectionary war If I were commander of a revolt, I should feel greater confidence of success at the head of а single province, in which every human being from boyhood upwards was against the enemy, than at the head of an empire partially 111 arms The mind even of the rudest spearsman is ι great portion of him The boldest shrinks frum the consciousness that hostility is on all sides, that whether marching or at rest, watching or sleep ing, by night or by day, enmity concealed or visible is round lum, that it is in the very air he bre ithes, in the very food he eats, that he can nevei feel for a moment secure, that every Ь ce he sees, is the face of one who wishes him dead , that eveiy knife, even every trivial instrument of human use, may be turned into a shedder of his blood Those things perpetually confront ing his mmd, break it down, he grows reck less, miserable, undisciplined, and a dastard '
" But,' observed Eleazar, " the sufferings of the troops are seldom allowed to affect the gene rals And to men who have no object but con quest and plunder, the constant robbeiy of an insurrectionary war, must render it а favourite command ' " Let me speak from experience, ' said Con stantius " Two years ago I was attiched with t squadron of galleys to the expedition against the tribes of Mount Taurus While the galleys wintered ш Cyprus, I followed the troops up the lulls No language can describe the (lis content even of that most unmurmuring of all armies, a Roman army Nothing had been omitted that could counteract the severity of the season Tents, provisions, clothing adapted to the hills, even luxuries despatched from the islands, gave the camps almost the indulgencies of cities The phj sical hardships of the campaign were trivial, compared with those of hundreds, m which the Romans had beaten regular armies Yet the disrontent was indescribable, from the perpetual and unrelaxiug alarms of the service. The mountaineers were not num
rous, they weie but half armed, disciplined they were not at all A Roman centurion would have out manoeuvred all their captains But they were brave, they knew nothing but to kill or be killed, and it made no difference to them whether death did his work by night or by day Sleep was scarcely possible To sit down on a march, was to be levelled at by a score of airows, to pursue the archers, was to be lured into some hollow, where a fragment of the rock above, or a felled tree, was ready to crush the heavy legionaries We chased them from hill to hill, we might as well have chased tbe vultures and eagles, that duly followed us, with the perfect certainty of not being disap pointée of their meal Wherever the enemy showed themselves, they were beaten, but our \ ictory was totally fruitless The next turn of the mountain road, was a strong hold from which w e had to expect a new storm of arrows, lances, and fragments of rock Tbe mountaineers always had a retreat If we drove them from the pinnacles of the hills, they were ш a moment in the valleys, where we must follow
them at the risk of falling down precipices and being swallowed up by torrents, in which the strougest swimmei in the legions could not Uve for а moment If we drove them from the valleys we saw them scaling the moantams as if they wore wings, and scofhng at our tardy and htlpless movements, encumbered as we were with baggage and armom We at length forced our way through the mountain range, and when with tbe loss of half the army we had toadied their citadel, we found tbat the woik was to be begun again To remain where we weie, was to be starved, we ^ad defeated the hirlmrunv, but they were as unconquered as ever, and our only resource was to retrace our steps, whieh we did at the expense of α battle every morning, noon, evening, and night, with a ìuinous loss of lives, and the total abandonment of every tbiug m the shape of baggage The defeat was of course hushed up, and according to the old Roman policy, tho escape was coloured into a victory, I had the honour of carrying back the general to Italy, where he was decreed an Ovation, a vol и. в
tum el crown, and a crowd of the usual dis¬ tinctions but the fiumi ph belonged to the men of the mountains, and till our campaign is for¬ gotten, no Roman oflicer will look for his laurels in Mount Tamus again " Such for ever be the fate of wars against the natural freedom of the brave,' said I " but the Cilicians had the advant ige of an almost unpenetrable country Three fourths of Judea are already m the enemy's possession " " No country in which man can exist, can be impenetrable to an invading aimy/ was the reply " Natural defences aie tnfling before the vigour and dextenty ot mm 'J he true barriei is m the hearts of the defenders. We were masters of the whole îange We could not find a thousand men assembled on any one point Yet we were not the actual possessors of a mile of ground bevond the sqaaie of oui camp We aever s iw a daj without an attack, nor evei by down at night without the cei¬ tamty of being startled from our sleep by some fierce attempt at a surprise It was this per¬ petual anxiety that broke the spu its of the
tioops. All was in hostility to them They felt that there was not а secine spot within tlie honzon Every man whom they saw, they knew to be one who either bad drawn Roman blood, 01 who longed m his inmost soul to draw it They dued not pass by а single rock with¬ out a search foi a lurking enemy Even a felled tiee might conceal some daring savage, who was content to die on the Roman spears, aftei having flung Ins unernng lance among the ranks» or shot an arrow that went through the tlncktst corslet I have seen the boldest of the legionaries sink on the ground in ab¬ solute exhaustion of heart, with this hopeless and weaiymg waiiure I have seen men with muscles ns strong as iron, weep like children, through mere depression With the harsher spirits, all was execiation and bitterness, even lo the veige of mutiny Witb *he more gene- lous, all was regret at the waste of honour, mingled with involuntary admiration of the barbarians who thus defied the haughty courage and boasted discipline of the conquerors of man¬ kind The secret spring of their rebistance,
was its universality. Every mnn was embarked m tho common cause Titers was no room for evasion, undci covet of a party disposed to peace there was no Roman inteiest among the people, in which timidity 01 stlhshnc s could fake r« fuge The national с uisc had not a lukewarm fnend the nivadcis had not a dubious enemy The line was drawn with the svvoid, and the cause of national indepen¬ dence triumphed, as it ought to triumph " " But we are a people split mto as many vaneties of opinion, as there are piovinces or oven villages m Judea," observed Eleazar " The Jew loves to follow the opinions ot the head of his family, the chief man of his tube, or cien of the priest, who has long exercised an influence ovei his district We have not the slavishness of the Asiatic, hut wo still want the pei sonai choice of the European We must secure the leaders, if we would secine the people.' " Men," said Constantius, " are mtnnsically the same in every climate under heaven They will all hate hazard, where nothing but hazard
ıs to be gained They will all linger for ages in shverv where tho tisknnster his the policy to avoid sud ten ν lolence but they will ill ei countei the seveiest trills wleie in the hour ot inj iry they find a leader prep ucd to guide them to honour \nd to that extent they shall have trial of me 1 excl umed Before another Sabbath I shall make tho experiment of my fitness to be the leader of my countrymen If I fail none but myself w ill suffer if I succeed Judea shall be w b it she was before the foot of the Italian sta ned her sacred territory But no parley nig for me with tho dofards ani shves >t Jerusalem At the head of my own tribe I will march to the city before the enemy can be aware of my purpose seize upon the garrison and from Herod s pal ice from tho veiy chair of the Procurator will I at once silence the vo ce of faction clamour as it may and lift the banner to the tribes of Israel Nobly conceived said Constantius his countenance glowing with animation blow upon blow is the true tactic of an insurrection
ary war We must stuke at once, suddenly and fatally The sword of lum who would triumph in a revolt, must not merelv sound on the enemy s helmet, bnt cut through it " But to Jerusalem, said Elt i/ar " th ob jections are palpable The Roman cohorts fully garrison the castles The city would be out of hopo of a surpnse, would he diflieult to capture, and beyond all chance to keep Tho whole force of the legions would be directed upon it, and if the revolt failed there, it must be without resource in tho land " Ever tardy, thwarting, and contradictoiy/ I exclaimed " If the Roman sceptre hy under my heel, I should find Eleazar foibidtlmg mt to crush it My mmd is fixed, I will hear no more ' I started from my seat, and paced the room Eleazar appro iched mo " My brother said he, holding out his hand with n forgiving smile, " we must not differ I honour your heart, S-dathiel, I know your talents, there is not α man in Judei, whom I should be prouder to see "t the head of its councils I agree with you, that a blow «hould be struck, an instant
and a deadly blow, and now I oiler you myself and every man whom 1 cm influence, to follow you to tho list exdemity. The only question is, where the blow ib to fill " Constantius had been gazing on tho chart ot Judea, which lay between us on tho table " If it be our object, ' s ud lit, " to combine injury to the Romans with actual advantage to ourselves, to make a trial where failure can¬ not be ruinous, and where success may be of measureless value, here is the spot " He pointed to Masada. The fortiess oí Masada was built by Herod the Great, as his pnnupal magazínu of arms A gallant and successful soldier, one of his luxuries was the variety and costliness of his weapons, aud the royul armoury of Masada was renowned throughout Asm Pride m the possession of such a tiophy, probably aided by some reverence for the memory of the friend of Cesar and Anthony, whom the legions still almost worshipped as tutelai genu, originally saved it from tho usual Roman spoil ition But no native foot was permitted to enter the armoury,

This day was^one of the many festivals of our countiy, and my halls echoed with sounds of enjoyment The immense gardens glittered with illumination m all the graceful devices, of win h oui people weie such masteis, uid when I looked out lor the path of Constantius, I was absolutely pained by the sight of so much fan¬ tastic pleasure, while my hero was pursuing his way through darkness and solitude At length the lesinai was over The lights twinkled thinner among the arbouis, the sounds of glad voices sank, and I saw fiom my case¬ ment the evidences of departure in the tiains of
torches that moved up the surrounding hills The sight of α starlight sky Ins always been ю ше among the softest and surest he ilers oí tbe heart md I gazed upon that mighty scene which throws ttll hum in cai es into such httle ness until my composure returned The hst of ilie guests had left the palace be lore I ventuied to descend The vases of per fumes still breathed in the hall of the evening banquet tho alabaster lamps were still bu η mg but excepting the attendants who waited on my steps at а distance and whose fixed figures might have been taken foi statues there was not a living being near me ol tbe laughing and jovous crowd that had so htely ghtteied danced spoi ed and smiled within those sump tuous walls Yet what was this but α picture of the common rotation of life ?

that brooded on my spirit. I dreaded that the presence of my family might force out my heavy beeret, and hngeted, with my eyes gazing without sight, on the costly covenng of the board A sound of music from an inner hall, to which Mn iam and her daughters had retired, aroused me I stood at the door, gazing on the group withm The musac was ι hymn, with which they closed the customary ûevo tions of the day. But there was something in its sound to me that I had never felt before At the moment when those sweet voices were pouring out the gratitude of hearts as innocent and glowing as the hearts of angels, a scene of horror might be acting The husband of Sa¬ lome might bo struggling under the Roman swords , he might be lying a corpse under the feet of the cavalry, that before morn might bring the news of his destruction in the flames that startled us from our sleep, and the swords that pierced our iosoms And what bei igs were those thus appointed for the sacrifice * The lapse of even a few
vears had perfected fhe natural beauty of my daughters S dome s sp irkling eve was more brilliant her graceful form was moulded into more easy elegance and her 1 luglung hp wis wreathed with a more playful smile Never did I see a creature of deepei witcherj My Esther, my noble and dear Esther who was, perhaps the dearer to me from her indenting а tinge of my melancholy, yet a melancholy ex¬ alted by genius and ardour of soul mto а charm, was this night the leader of the song of holi¬ ness Her large uplifted eye glowed with the brightness of one of the stirs on which it was fixed Her hands fell on the harp in almost the attitude of prayei, and the expression of her lofty and uitellectuil countenance crim soued with the theme told of a communion with thoughts and beings above mortality The hymn was done the voices had ceased, yet the inspiration still burned in her soul, her hands still shook from the chords harmonies, sweet, but of tbe wildest and boldest brilliancy, bursts and flights of sound, like the rushing of the distant wateifall at night, or the solemn
echoes, and mightv complainings oi the forest in the first swell of the sforni Mimai aml Salome sat beholding her in silent admnation and love. The magnificent dress oi the Jewish female eould not heighten the power of such beauty. But it filled up the picture The jewelled tiaras, the cmbioidered shawls, the high wiought and massive armlets, the silken robes and sashes fnnged with pearl and diamond, the profusion of dazzling ornament that makes the Onental costume to this day, were the due h.ibifs of the forms that then sflt uncon¬ scious of the delighted yet anxious eye that drank in tho joy of their presence I saw be¬ fore me the pomp of princedoms, investing forms worthy of thrones My entrance broke off Ше harpers spell, and I found it a hard task to answer the fond in¬ quiries and touching congratulations that flowed upon me But the hour waned, and I was again left alone for the few minutes which it was my custom to give to meditation before 1 lelired to rest I threw open the low door that

CHAPTER IV My preparations were quickly made. I di¬ vested myself of my robes, led out my favounte barb, flung an alhaik over my shoulders, and by the help of my Arab turban might have passed for a courier or a plunderer in any corner of Syria This was done unseen of auv eye> for the crowd of attendants that thronged the palace in the day, were now stretched through the courts, or on the ter¬ races, fast asleep, under the doubled influence of a day of feasting, and a night of tepid sum¬ mer air I rode without stopping, till the sim began to throw up fais yellow rays through the vapours
of the lake of Tibeins To ascertain alike the progress of Constantius and the chances of meeting with some of those Roman squadions which were pprpetu illy moving between the fortresses I struck off the road into a forest tied my barb to α tree α d set forth to recon n oitro Travelling on foot was the common mode of a country which like Judea was but little fitted for the breed of horses and I found no want of compamons Pedlars peasants dis banded soldiers and probably thieves diversi fied my knowledge of mankind within a few miles I escaped under the sneer of the sol dier and the compassion of the peasant The first glance at my wardrobe satisfied the robber that I was not worth the exercise of his profes sion or perhaps that 1 was а brother of the trade But I found none of the repulsiveness that makes the intercourse of higher life so un productive Confidence was on every tongue All the secrets of their families were at my disposal and I discovered even in the sandy roads of Palestine that to be а judicious lis
tener, is one of the first talents for popularity -ill over the world But, of my peculiar objects I could learn nothing, though every man whom I met had some story of the Romans I ascertained to my surprise, that the intelligence which Septi mius brought from the very penetralia of the imperial cabinet, was known to the multitude Every voice of the populace was full of a tale, which probably was reckoned among the pro- foundest secrets of the state. I have made the same observation ra later æras, and found even in the most formal mysteries of the most frown¬ ing governments, the rumour of the streets outrun the cabinets So it must be, while diplomatists have tongue», and while women and domestics have curiosity. But if I were to rely on the accuracy of those willing politicians, the cause of independence was without hope Human nature loves to make itself important, and the narrator of the marvellous is always great, according to the distention of his news Those who had seen a cohort, invariably magnified it into a legion a
troop of cavalry covered half a province and the detachments marching fiom Asia Minor and Egypt for our invasion were reckoned by the very largest numeration within the tellers capacity As I was sitting by α rivulet moistening some of the common bread of the country, which I had brought to aid my disguise I entered into conversation with one of those unhoused exiles of society, whom at the first glance we discern to be natures commoners, indebted to no man for food, raiment, or habí tation, the native dweller on the road He had some of the habitual jest of those who have no care, and congratulated me on the size of my table the meadow, and the unadulterated purity of my potation, the brook He informed me that he came direct from the Nile w here he had seen the son of Vespasian at the head of a hundred thousand men A Syrian soldier, returning to Damascus, who joined our meal felt indignant at the discredit thus thrown on a general, under whom he had received three pike wounds, and leave to beg his way home
He swore by Ashtarotb, that the force under Titus was at least twice the number. A third wanderer, a Roman veteran, of whom the re¬ mainder was covered over with glonous patches, arrived just in time to relieve his general from the disgrace of so limited a command, and another hundred thousand was instantly put under his orders, sanctioned by asseverations ш the name of Jupiter Capitohnus, and as many others of the calendar as the patriot could pronounce Thi c rapid recruiting threw the former authorities into tht hack ground, and the old legionary was, for the rest of the meal, the undisputed leader of the conversation« " To suppose, ' s ud the veteran, ** that those circumcised dogs can stand against a regular- bred Homan general, is sacrilege, Half bis army, or α tenth of his army, would walk through the land, north and south, east and west, as easily as 1 could walk through this brook " No doubt of it," said the Syrian, " if they had some of our cavalry for flanking and foraging. '
" Aye, for any thing but fighting, comrade," said the Roman with а laugh " No, you leave out another capital quality, ' observed the beggar " none can deny, that whoever may be first in the advance, the Syrians will be first in the retreat There are two manoeuvres to make a complete soldier—how to get into battle, and how to get out of it Now the Syrians manage the latter in the most undoubted perfection " " Silence, villain," exclaimed the Syrian, " 01 you have robbed your last hen-roost " " He says nothing but the truth for all that, interrupted the veteian " But neither of us taxed your cavalry with cowardice No, it was pure virtue They had too much modesty to take the way into the field before other troops, and too much humanity not to teach them how to sleep without broken bones The beggar, delighted at the prospect of a quarrel, gave the assent, that more embroils the fray " Mark Anthony did not say so," murmuied the indignant Syrian
" Mark Anthony ' ' cried the Roman, starting upon his snigle leg, " glory to his name but what could а fellow like you know about Mark Anthony ? ' " I only served with lnm, ' drily replied the Syrian. " Then here's my hand for you, ' exclaimed the bravo old man " wo aro comrades. I would love even a dog that had seen the face ot Mark Anthony He was the first man that I ever carried buckler under There was a soldier for you, such men are not made in this puling age Ho could fight from morn till night, and carouse from night till morn, and never lose his seat on his charger in the field for the day after I have seen him run half naked thiough the snows in Armenia, and walk in armour m the hottest day of Egypt He loved tho soldier and the soldiei loved lnm So, comrade, liei e s to the health of Mark Authony Ah, we shall never see such men again " He drew out a flask of ration wine, closely akin to vinegar, of wluch he hospitably gave us
each a cup, and after pouring a libation to his hero s memory, whom he ev idently placed among the gods, swallowed the draught, in which we devoutly followed his example "Yet,' said tho beggar, "if Anthony were a great man, he has left little men enough be hind him Tlieres, for instance, the present gay procurator, six months in the gout, the other six months drunk, or if sober, only think¬ ing where he can rob next This will bring the government into trouble before long, 01 I'm much mistaken For my part, 1 pledge myself, if he should take any part of my pro¬ perty—— ' ------" Why, if he did," said the Syrian, " I give him credit for magic He would find a crop of wheat m the sand, or coin money of the air. Where is your property r " Comrade," said the veteran, laughing, " re collect t if the saying be true, that people are least to be judged of by the outside, the rags of our jovial friend must hide many a shekel, and, as to where his property lies, he has a wide estate who has the world for his portion,
and property enough, who thinks all his own that he can lay his fingers on * The laugh was now loud against the beggar. He however bore all like one accustomed to the buffets of fortune, and, joining in it, said, "Whatever may be my talents in that way, there is no great chance of showing them in this company , but if you should be present at the suck of Masada, and I should meet you on your way back-----" ------" Masada ' exclaimed I instinctively " Yes, I left the town three days ago On that very morning an order arrived to prepare for the coming of the greut and good Florus, who in his wisdom, feeling the want of gold, has determined to fill up the hollows of the military chest and his own purse, by stripping the armoury of every thing that can sell for money My intelligence is from the best au¬ thority The governor's principal bath slave told it to one of the damsels of the steward's department, with whom the Ethiopian is mor¬ tally ш love, and the damsel, m a moment of tenderness, told it to шс in fact, to let you
into my secret I am now looking out for riorus in whose train I intend to make my way b ick into this gold mine The villain' cried the veteran distuib the arms of the dead ' Why they s y that it has the very corslet and buckler tl at Mark Anthony wore when he marched against the Idumeans I fear more the disturbance of the arms of the living said the Synan The Jews will take it for granted that the Romans are giving up the business m despair and if I m a true man there will be blood before I get home No fe r of that fellow soldier said tl e veteran gaily you have kept your two legs and when they Iı we so long carried you out of harm s way it would be the w orst treatment possible to leave you in it at last But there is something in what you say I had а dieam last night I thought I saw the country m ι blaze and when I stirted from my sleep my ears were filled with a sound like the tram pling of ten thousand cavalry I drew my breath quick, aud to conceal my
emotion, gathered up the fragments of our meal On completing my work, I found the beggar's eye fixed on me —he smiled. "I too had a dream last night," said he, " and of much the same kind I thought that I saw a cloud of cavalry riding as fast as horse could lay hoof to giound, I never saw a more dashing set, since my first campaign upon the highways of this wicked world. I'll be sworn that, whatever their errand may be, such riders will not come back without it Then horses' heads were turned towards Masada, and I am now between two minds whether I may not mention my dream to the procurator him¬ self" I found his keen eye turned on me again " Absurd '" said Τ " He would recommend you only to his lictor." " I lather think he would recommend me to his treasurei, for I nevei had a dream that seemed so hke а faet, I should not be surprised to find that I had heen sleeping with my eyes open." His look convinced me that I was known
I touched his hand, while the soldiers were busy packing up their cups, and showed him gold. He smiled carelessly I laid my hand on my poniard, he but smiled agam. " The sun is burning out," said he, " and I can stand talking here no longer Tarewell, brave soldiers, and safe home to you ! Fare¬ well, Arab, and safe borne to those that you are looking after' He stalked away, and as he passed me, said in a low voiee, "Glory to Naphtah ' ' Aftei exchanging good wishes with the old men, I followed lun , he led the way towards the wood at a pace which kept me at a distance When I reached the shade he stopped, and prostrated himself before me " Will my lord," said he, " forgive tho pre¬ sumption of his servant' This day, when I first met you, your disguise deceived me I bear intelligence from your friends ' I caught the fragment ot papyrus from him, and read — " All s well We have hitherto met with no¬ thing to oppose us To-morrow night we shall be on the ground If no addition be made to
the force within, the suipnse will be complete. Our cause itself is victory Health to all we love ' ' " Your mission is now done," said I " Go on to Naphtah, and you shall be rewarded as your activity has deserved ' " No,' replied he, with the easy air of a licensed humorist, " I have but two things to think of in this world—my time and my money, of one of them I have infinitely moie than I well know how to spend, and of the other infi¬ nitely less I expected to have killed a few days in going up to Naphtah But that hope has been cut off by my finding you half way I will now try Florus, and get nd of a day or two with that most worthy of men " " That I forbid," interrupted I " Not, if you will trust one whom your no¬ ble son has trusted I am not altogether with¬ out some dislike to the Romans myself, nor something between contempt and hatred for Gessius Florus " His countenance darkened at the name. " I tell you," pronounced he bitterly, " that fellow's pampered carcass this

burst from his eyes—" She still spumed him She implored to die She called upon my name in her misery —Wretch that I was, what could I, a worm, do under the heel ot the tyrant ? —But I saw her at last —I made my way into the dungeon. There sat she, pale as the stone to which she was chained, «. silent, sightless, bloodless, mindless skeleton I called to her she knew nothing I pressed my lips to hers she never felt them I bathed her cold hands in my tears I fell at her feet I prayed to her but to pronounce one word, to give soine sign of remembrance, to look on me She sat like α statue, her reason was gone, gone for ever ' He flung himself upon the ground, and writhed and gioaned before me To turn him from a subject of such sorrow, I asked what he meant to do by lus mtercouise with Florus " To do ? not to stab lum in his bed , not to poison hun in his banquet, not to smite him with that speedy death, which would be mercy,—no, but to force him into ruin step
by step, to gather shame, remorse, and anguish round htm, cloud on cloud, to mix evil in his cup with such exquisite slowness, that he shall taste every drop, to strike lum only so far, that he may feel the pang without being stunned, to mingle so much of hope in his undoing, that he may uever enjoy the vigour of despair, to sink lum mto his own Tartarus inch by inch, till eveiy fibre hns its particular agony " He yelled, suddenly rose from the ground, and rushed forward and threaded the thickets with swiftness that made pursuit in vain
CHAPTLR \ Тнг violence of the beggars anguish ind the strong probabilities of his story engiossed me so much, that I at first regretted the extra ordinary flight, which put it out of my power to offer him any assistance I returned with а feel ing of disappointment to the spot where I had left my horse, and was riding towards the higher country to avoid the enemy s straggling parties, when I heard a loud outcry On ι crag so distant, that I tliought human speed could scarcely have reached it in the time I saw this strange being making all kinds of sig n ils, sometimes pointing to me, then to some object below him, and uttering a cry which
might easily be mistaken for the howl of a wild beast I reined up, it was impossible for me to ascertain whether he was w irning me of the neighbourhood of danger, or apprising others of my approach, or even, from the nature of his cries, preparing me for an assault by a troop of panthers Great stakes make man suspi¬ cious , and the Prince of Naphtah, speeding to the capture of the principal place of arms of the legions, might be an object well worth a little tre ichery I rapidly forgot the beggar s sorrows in the consideration of his habits , decided tint his harangue was α piece of professional dexte nty, probably played off every week of Ins life, and that if I would not be in Roman hands be fore night, 1 must ride m the precisely opposite direction to that which his signals so labonously recommended Nothing glows with more vigour than the doubt of human honesty. I satisfied myself in a few moments that I was а dupe, dashed through thicket, over rock, forded torrent, and, from the top of an acclivity at which even my
high mettled steed had looked with repugnance, saw, with the triumph of him who deceives the deceiver, the increased violence of the im¬ postor's attitudes He leaped from crag to crag with the activity of a goat, and when he could do nothing else, gave the last evidence of Ori¬ ental vexation, by tearing his robes I waved my hand to him in contemptuous farewell, and dismounting, for the side of the hill was almost precipitous, led my panting Arab through beds of myrtle, and every lovely and sweet-smelling bloom, to the edge of а valley, that seemed made to shut out every disturbance of mau A circle of low hills, covered to the crown with foliage, surrounded a deep space of velvet turf, kept green as the emerald by the flow of rivulets, and the moisture of a pellut id lake in the centre, tinged with every colour of the heavens. The beauty of this sylvan spot was enhanced by the luxuriant profusion of almond, orange, and other trees, that in every stage of production, from the bud to the fruit, covered the little knolls below, and formed a bioad belt round the lake.
Parched as I was by the into эгаЫе heat, this secluded haunt of the very spirit ot freshness looked doubly lovely. My eyes, half blinded by the glare of the sands, and even my mind ex¬ hausted by the perplexities of the day, found delicious relaxation m the verdure and dewy breath of the silent valley. My barb, with the quitk sense of animals accustomed to the travel of the wilderness, showed her delight bv phivful boundings, the prouder arching of hei neck, and the brighter glancing of her bright eve " Here, thought I, as I led her slow ly towards the steep descent, " would be the verv spot for the innocence that had not tried the world, or the philosophy that had tried it, and found all vanity Who could dream that, within the borders of this distracted land, in the verv hearing, almost withm the very sight of the last miseries tbat man can inflict on man, there was a retreat, which the foot of man perhaps never yet deuled , and in which the calamities that aflhct society might be as little felt as if it were among tbe stars '" A violent plunge of the barb put an end to
my speculation She exhibited the wildest signs of terror, snorted, and strove to bieak fiom me, then fixing her glance keenly on the thickets below, shook in every limb. But the scene was tranquilhtv itself, the chameleon lay basking in the sun, and tnc only sound was that of the wild doves murmuring under the broad leaves of the palm-trees But my mare still resisted every effort to lead her downwards, her ears were fluttering convulsively, her eyes were starting from their sockets, 1 grew peevish at the animal's un¬ usual obstinacy, and was about to let her suffer thirst for the day, when my senses were pa¬ ralyzed by a tremendous roar A lion stood on the summit which I had but just quitted He was not a dozen yards above my head, and his first spring must have carried me to the bottom of the precipice. The barb burst away at once I drew the only weapon I had, а dagger,—and, hopeless as escape was, grasping the tangled weeds to sustain my footing, awaited the plunge But the lordly savage probably disdained so ignoble a prey, and continued on the summit, VOL II. D
lashing his sides with his tail, and tearing up the ground He at length stopped suddenly, listened, as to some approaching foot, and then with a hideous yell, sprang over me, and was in the thicket below at a single bound The whole thicket was instantly alive, the shade which I had fixed on for the seat of un ea"thly tranquillity, was m old haunt of lions and the mighty herd were now roused fiom their noon day slumbers Nothing could be grander or more terrible than this disturbed majesty of the forest kings In every variety of savage passion, from terror to fury, they plunged, and tore, and yelled, darted through the lake, burst through the thicket, rushed up the hills, or stood baying and roaring in defiance against the coming invader, the numbers were immense, for the rareness of shade and water had gathered them from every quarter of the desert While I stood clinging to my perilous hold, and fearful of attracting their gaze by the slightest movement, the source of the commo tioa appeared, in the shape of a Homan soldier issuing, зреаг in hand, through a ravine at the
further side of tbe valley He was ρ ilpably unconsi lous of the formidable place into which he was entering aid the gallant clamour of voices thiough the hills, showed that he was followed by others as bold md unconscious oi tlbn danger as himself But his career soon closed his bosses feet h id ьс ireely touched the tuif, when a lion was h\ed with fangs and claws on the creatuie^ loins The uder uttered a cry of horror, and foi the mst int s it, helplessly gazing at the open j tws behind him I saw the hun gathering up his il inks foi a second bound ' ut the soldier, a ligure of gigantic strength, grasping the nostrils of the monste·· with one hand, and witü tiie other liortenmg his speai, drove the steel it one resistless thrust into the lion s foiehead Horse, lion, and ridei fell, and continued strug ghng together In the next moment а mass of cavalry came thundering down the ravine They had broken ofl from their march, through the accident of loiiMng ι straggling lion, and followed him ш the giddy ardour of the chase The sight now
before them was enough to appal the boldest intrepidity. The valley was filled wifh the vast herd, retreat was impossible, for the troopers came still pouring in by the only pass, and, from the sudden descent of the glen, horse and man were rolled head foremost among the lions , neithet man nor monster could retreat The conflict was horrible, the heavy spears of the legionaries plunged through bone and brain, the lions, made more furious by wounds, sprang upon the powerful horses and tore them to the ground, or flew at the troopers thioats, aud unshed and diagged away cuirass and buckler. The valley was a struggling heap of human and savage battle , man, lion, and charger, wnthing and rolling in agonies, till their forms were un- distinguishuble The groans and cries of the legionaries, tho screams of the mangled horses, and the roars and bowlings of the hous bleeding with sword and spear, tearing the dead, darting up the sides of the lulls in terror, and rushing down again with the fresh thirst of gore, baffled all conception of fury and horror. But man ι as the conqueror at last, the sa-
vages, scared by the spear and thinned in their numuers, made a rush m one body towards the ravine, overthrew every thing in their way, and burst from the valley, awaking the desert for many α league with their roar The troopers bitterly repenting their rash exploit, gathered up the remnants of their dead on litters of boughs, and, leaving many a gallant steed to feast the vultures, slowly re tired from the place of carnage The spot to which I clung, made ascent or descent equally difficult, and during this extr ι ordinary contest I continued imbedded in the foliage, and gl id to escape th" eye of man and brute alike But the troop were gone, beneith me lay nothing but α scene of blood, and I begun to wind my way to the summit A mi nace from below stopped me A «oh tary horse man had galloped back to gue a last look to this valley of death, he saw me climbing the hill, saw that I was not a Roman, and, m the irritation of the hour, made no scruple of sacri ficing a native to the manes of his comrades Tbe spear followed his words, and ploughed the
ground at my side His outcry brought bat к a dozen of his squadron, I found myself about to be assailed by а general discharge escipe on foot was impossible, and I had no resource but to descend and give myself up to the sol diery It was to warn me of this hazaid that the signals of my strange companion weie made He saw the advance of the Roman column along the plain My suspicions of his honesty drove me directly into their road, and the chance of turning down the valley scarcely retarded the capture On my first emerging from the lulls I must have been taken However, my captors were in unusual ill temper As in Arab, too poor to be worth plundering or being made prisoner I should have met only a sneer or an execration, and been turned loose, but the 1 ite disaster made the turban and alhaick odious, and I was treitcd with the wrath due to a fellow conspirator of the lions. To my request, that I should be suffered to depart m peace on my business, tho most prompt denial was given, the story that I told
to nccount for my travel in the track of the column was treated with the simplest scorn, I was pronounced u spy and fairly told, that my head was my own only till I gave the Procura tor whatever information it contained Yet I found one fnend in this evil state of my expedition My barb, which I had given up for lost in the desert, or torn by the wild beusts appeared on the heights overhanging our march, and by snuffing the wind, and bounding backwards and forwards through the thickets, attracted general attention I claimed her, and the idea that the way sore and rough clothed prisoner could be the majster of so noble an animal, raised scorn to its most peremptory pitch In turn I demanded permission to prove my right, and called the barb The creature heard the voice with the most obvious delight, bounded towards me, rubbed her head to my feet, and by every movement of dumb joy showed that she had found her master But my requests for dismissal were idle, I talked to the winds, the rear squadrons of the coiutnn were in sight, there was no time to be
lost, I was suffered to mount the barb, but her bridle was thrown across the neck of one of the troopei s horses, and I was marched along to death, or a tedious captivity My blood boiled, when I thought of what was to be done before the dawn " What would be expected from me by my people, and how lame and impotent must my excuse fall on the public ear, how miserable α proof had I given of the vigilance and vigoui that were to claim the command of armies ' ' I gnashed my teeth, and writhed m every nerve My agita tion at length caught the eye of a corpulent old captain, whose good-humored visage was coloured by the deepest infusion of the grape. His strong Thracian charger was a moveable magazine of the choicest Falernian, out of every crevice of his packsaddle and accoutre ments peeped the head of a flask, and to judge by his frequent recourse to his stores, no man was less inclined to carry his baggage for nothing Popularity too attended upon the captain, and a group of young patricians at¬ tached to the Procurators court were eontent
to abate of their rank, and ride along with the old soldier, in consideration of his better know¬ ledge of the grand military science of providing ior the road In the midst of some ramp story, which the majority received with peals of applause, the captam glanced upon me, and, asking " whe¬ ther I was not ill," held out his flask. I took it, and never did I taste draught so delicious Thirst and hunger are the true secrets of lux¬ ury I absolutely felt new life rushing into me with the wine " There, said the old man, " see how the fellow s eye sparkles Falernian is the doctor, after all I have had no othei these forty years For hard knocks, hard watches, and hard weather, there is nothing like the true juice of the ν me Try it agam, Arab ' I declined the offer m cıvıl terms ' There," said he, " it has made the man eloquent By Hercules, it would put a tongue into the dumb animals I warrant it would make that mare speak And now that I look at her, she is as prettily made a creature as I

said, in a whisper—" Friend, let him have the mare. He is rich, and will pay you hand¬ somely, and powerful besides, for he is the nephew of the procurator. It will not be wise in you to put him in a passion." " That fellow shall never have her, though he were to coin these sands into gold," re¬ phed I " Do you mean to call us robbers 7 " eaid the tribune, with a lowering eye " Do you mean to stop me on the highway, and take my property from me, and expect that I shall call you anything else 7 " was the answer " Sententious rogues, those Arabs! Every soul of them has a point or a proverb on his tongue," murmured the captain to the group of young men, who were evidently amused by seeing their unpopular companion entangled with me " Slave ' ' said the tribune, fiercely, " We must have no more of this You have been found lurking about the camp. Will you be hanged for a spy ? "
" A spy ' ' said I, and the insult probably coloured my cheek " No, a spy has no busi ness among the Romans " " So," observed the captain, " the Arab seems to think that our proceedings aie m ge lierai pretty palpablo Slay, stnp, and burn He turned to the patrician tribune.—" The fellow is not worth our trouble. Shall I let lnm go about his business '" " Sir," said the tribune, angrily, " it is your business to command your troop, and be silent " The old man bit his hp, and fell back to the line of his men My taunter reined up beside me again " Do you know, robber, that I can order you to be speared on the spot tor vour lies'" " No, for I have told you nothing but the truth of both of us Such an ord*r too would only prove, that men will often bid others do, what they dare not touch with a finger of their The officeis, offended nt the treatment of their old favourite, burst into a laugh The coxcomb grew doubly indignant
" Strip the hound," exclaimed he to the sol¬ diers " it is money that makes lum insolent." " Nature has done it at least for one of us, without the expense of a mite," rephed I, calmly " Off with his turban Those fellows carry com in eveiy fold of it " The oflicers looked at each other in surprise, the captain hardly suppressed α contemptuous execration between his lips The very troopei s hesitated " Soldiers'" said I, in the same unaltered tone, " I have no gold in my turban An Arab is seldom one of those—the outside of whose head is bettei worth than the in " The perfumed and curled locks of the tri¬ bune, surmounted by α helmet, sculptured and plumed in the most extravagant style, caught ev^ry eye, and the shaft, slight as it was, went home. " I'll pluck the robber off hu, horse by the beard " exclaimed the tribune, sputnng his horse upon me, and advancing his hand I threw open my robe, grasped my dagger,
and sternly pronounced,—"There is an oath in our Ime, that tbe mnn who touches the beard of an Arab, dies ' He was not pre pared for the action, hesitated, and finally wheeled from me The old captain burst out into an involuntary huzza ' " Take the beggar to the camp,' said the tribune, as he rode away " I hate all scoun drels, and he glanced round the spectators ' Then, exclaimed I, after hun, as a part¬ ing blow, " you have at least one virtue, for you can never be charged with Self love " This woman war made me popular on the spot The tribune had no sooner turned his horse's head, than the oflicers clustered together in laughter Even the iron visages of the troopers relaxed into grim smiles The old jocular captain was the only one still grave " There rides not this day under the canopy of Heaven,' murmured he, " a greater puppy than Caius Sempromiis Catulus, tribune of the thirteenth legion, by his mother s morals, and the Emperor's taste. Why did not the coxcomb stay at home, and show off his trap
pings among the supper-eaters of the palatine г He might have powdered his ringlets with gold dust, washed his lily hands in rose-water, and perfumed Ins Indian handkerchief with myrrh, as well there as here, for he does nothing else. Except," and he clenched the he ivy hilt of his falchion, " insult men, who have seen more battles than he has seen years , who know better service than figuring in ball- 100ms, or bowing in courts, and the least drop of whose blood is woith all that will ever run in his effeminate veins But I have not done with him yet As for you, friend," said he, " I am sorry to stop you on your way. But as this affair will be magnified by that fool's tongue, you must be brought to the procuratoi However, the camp is only a few miles off, you will be asked а few questions, and then left to follow your will " He little dreamed how I recoiled from that interview. To shorten the time of my delay, the good- natured old man ordered the squadron to mend their pace, and in half an hour, we saw the
noon-encampment of my sworn enemv, lifting its white tops and scirlet flags among the umbrage of a forest, deep in the valley at our feet
CHAPTER VI. Tur squadron diew up at the entrance of the procurator's tent , and, with a crowd ot alarmed peasants captured in tho course of the day, I was delivered o\er to be questioned by this man of terror. The few minutes which passed before I was called to take my turn, were singularly painful This was not fe ir , foi the instant sentence ol the axe would have been almost ι lehef from the hopeless and fretful thwartings sown so thickly in my path But to have embarked in a noble enterprise, and to perish, without use, to have arrived almost within siilit of the point of ray desires, and then, without striking a blow, to be given up to shame, stung me like a serpent.

took hım ' Catulus entered , and Ins account of me was, luckily, contemptuous in the ex treme I was " а notorious robber, who had stolcu u handsome horse, perfectly worthy of the stud of the procuratoi ' I panted with the hope of escape, and was gradually moving to the door " Stand, slave' cried ΓΙ01 us "I have my doubts of you still, and as the public safety admits of no mistake, I have no alterna tiv e Ί ribune ' order in the betors He must be scourged to confession The hctors were summoned, and I was to be tom by Roman torturers A tumult arose outside, and a man rushed in with the hctors, exclaiming, " Justice, most mighty riorus By the majesty of Rome, and the magnanimity of the most illustrious of governors, I call for justice against my plun derer, my undoer, the robber of the son of El Hakim of his most precious treasure " riorus recognised the clamourer as an old acquaintance, and desired lnm to state his com pl unt and with as much brevity as possible " Last night, said the man, " I was the

The wind rose, and wrapt me in whirls of sand I heard the roar of waters The ground became fractured, and full of the loose fragments that fill from rocky hills I discovered only that I was at the foot of the ridge, and had lost my way In this embarrassment I trusted to the sagacity of my steed But thirst led her di¬ rectly to the bed of ono of the mountain toi- rents, and the phosphoric gleam of the vvatei* alone saved us both fiom α pluuge over a preci¬ pice deep enough to extinguish every appetite and ambition in the round of tins bustling world To find a passage or an escape I alighted The torrent bellowed before ine. A wal' of rock rose on the opposite side After long chmb- mgs and descents, I found that I had descended

end of death was doing Every instant cost u life The hail stones that bruised me were not thicker than the arrows that were then smiting down my people Yet there was I, held like a wolf in the pitfall '" Even where the combat was being fought, baffled my conception. It might be m the clouds, or undei giound, on the opposite side of tho black ridgo before me, or many u league beyond the reach of my exhausted hmbs and drooping steed, all was darkness to the eye aud the mind A light flashed down a ravine, leading mto the heart of the mountains another and another rose Masada stood upon the mountain's brow' I plunged into the torrent—was beaten down by the billows—was swept along through narrow necks of rock, and, half sufi oca ted, was hurled up again, to find myself on the opposite shore. Wet and weaiy, I less climbed than tore my way upwards But the torrent hud borne me far below the ravine Before me was α gigantic rampart of rock. But tho time was flying. I sprang with fierce agility from fissure to fissure
I dragged myself up the face of the precipice by the tufted weeds and chance brushwood I swung from pomt to pomt by the few projecting branches, that yet broke away almost m my grasp, until, with my hands excoriated, my hmbs stiff and bleed ag, and my head reeling, I reaohed the pinnacle Was I under the dominion of a spell ? was the power of some fiend raised to mock me * All was darkness as far as the eye could pierce the heaviest veil of midnight hung upon the earth. There was utter silence Not the slightest breath touched upon the ear For a while the thought of some strange illusion was paramount, then came the frightful idea that the illusion was ш myself, that in the eflort to gam th ascent, I had strained eye and ear, until 1 could neither hear nor see, that I was still within sight and sound of battle, but insensible to the impressions of the external world for ever Immortality under this ex¬ clusion' A death lessness of the deaf and blind' The thought struck me with a force inconceiv¬ able by all minds but one sentenced like mine '
I cried aloud A flood of joy rushed into my heart when I heard my voice answered, though it was but by the neigh of my barb below, which probably felt itself as ill-placed as its master I now used my ear as the guide, und cautiously descending the further side of the ndge, was soon on comparatively level ground, the remnant of α forest My foot struck against a human body, I spoke the answer was a groan, and an entreaty that I should bear a small packet, which was put into my hands with a feeble pressure, to " the prince of Naphtah' In alarm aud astonishment, I raised the sufferer fiom the thorns in which lie could scarcely breathe, ga 1 e hım some water from my flask, and after many an effort, in which I thought that life would depart every moment, he told me that " he was the unfortunate leader of fhe assault of Masada Constantius lay in my " Where I am," said he, " how I came here, or any thing, but that we are undone, I с umot conceive My last recollection was that of fixing a ladder to the inner rampart We had
made our way good so far without much loss The garrison was weakened by detaehments sent out to plunder for the arrival of the procu rator I attacked at midnight To surprise a Roman fortress w as, I well knew, next to im¬ possible, and no man ever found а Roman garrison without bravery But our bold fellows did wonders Every thing was driven from the first rampart, we made more prisoners than we knew what to do with and m the midst of all kinds of resistance, we laid the ladders to the s cond wall But the garrison were still too strong for us Our easy conquest of the first line might have been a snare for the battle ments before us exhibited an overwhelming force We fought on but the ladders were broken with showers of stones from the engines The business looked desperate, but I had made up my mmd not to go back after having once got m , and, rallying the men, carried α ladder through a storm of lances and arrows to the foot of the mam tower I was bravely followed, and we were within grasp of the battlemen*, when I saw а cohort rush out from а sally port
below This was fatal, the foot of the rampart was cleared at once, the ladders were flung down, and I suppose, it is owing to the dl- judged fidelity of some of my followers, that I am unfortunate enough to hud myself here and ihve ' During the endless hours of this miserable night, I lihoured, with scaicely α hope, to keep life in my heroic son My coming had saved him The exposure and his wounds must have destroyed him before morning We consulted sadly on ou* next couise I suggested the possibility of gaining the fortress by α renewal of the attack, while the garrison were unpre¬ pared, or perhaps indulging themselves in ca¬ rousal or sleep after their success The neces sity of some attempt was strongly in my mind, and I expressed my determination to run the hazard, if I could find where the remnant of our troop had taken refuge But this was the first diihculty Signals ot any kind must rouse tha vigilance of the Romans The fortress was above our heads, and to collect the men during the night was impossible ^-...While I watched the restless tossings of
Constantius, a light stole along the ground at a distance. My first idea was, that a Roman patrol was coming, to extinguish our last re¬ mains of hope But the light was soon per¬ ceived to be in the hand of some one cautious of discovery To keep its bearer at a distance, I followed the track, and grasped lnm. "I surrender," said the captive, perfectly at his ease , " Long life to the Emperor ' ' He lifted the lamp to my face, and burst into laughter " May I have a Roman falchion through me, ' said he, " but I think we were born under the same planet By all the food thai uas enteied my lips this day, I took your Highness for a thief, and pardon the word, for а Roman one I have been running after you the whole day and night " He continued to talk and writhe with a kind of mad merriment. I could not obtain an answer to my questions, of what led him there—how he could guide us out of the forest—or what news he brought from the pro¬ curator He less walked than danced before me through the thickets, as our scene with Florus recurred to Ins fantastic mind " Never was trick so capital as your escape,'
exclaimed he, "I would have given an eye, or an arm, things rather an impediment to a beggar, I allow, but it would have been worth a kingdom to see, as I saw, the faces of the whole camp, procurator, oflicers, troopers, and all, down to the Ьогье boys, on your slipping through their fingers ш such first rate style I have done clever things in my time But never, no never, shall I equal th«l way of making five thousand men at once look like live thousand fools I own I thought that you would do something brilliant, and it w ıs for that purpose that I tried to draw off the eye of that scoundrel Florus, for, sot as he is, there are not ten in Palestine keener in all points where loguery is concerned I caught hold of his robe, told lnm a ready lie of the largest size about a dıscoveıy of money in Jeiusalem , and while he was nibbling at the bait, I heard llie uproar You were off, I could not help laugh nig in his illustrious face He kicked me from lum, and foaming with rage, ordered every man and horse out after your Highness But I saw ut a glance, that you had the game in your own

How he stooped to veil this accumulation of knowledge in lags, he did not condescend to explain But lus skill, so far, was certainly admirable, and my brave Constantius re¬ covered with a suddenness that surprised me With his strength, his hopes returned.

Тн h day passed anxiously, for every sound of the huge fortress was heard in tho thicket The creaking of machines, brought up to the walls against future assault , the rattling of hammers, the rolling of waggons loaded with materials for the repair of the night's damage , the calls of trumpet and clarion, and the maich of patroles, rang perpetually in our ears The depth of the copse, and its nearness to the ram parts, justified the beggar s generalship, and the ->on of El Hakim proved himself a master of the art of castrametation Nothing could exceed his alertness in threading the mazes of this
dwarf lorest, where a wolf could scarcely have made progress , and where α lvnx would havo ïequirtd all his еусч On my asking, how he contrived to find hie way through tins labvnnth, he told me, that " for making one's way in woods and elsewhere, theie was nothing like a familiarity with smug¬ gling, and the state " "The man," continued he, "who has driven η trade in every thing from pearls to pistachios without leave of the customs, cannot be much puzzled by thickets, and the man who has con¬ trived to climb into confidence at court, must have had a talent for keeping his feet m the most slippery spots, or he never could have mounted tlie hick-stairs'" He collected the troop, of whom I was re¬ joiced to believe that but few had fallen, though nearly one half were made pnsoneis they were eager to attempt the rampart again, all boldly attributing their failure to accident, and all thirsting alike for tbe rescue of iheir comrades, and for revenge. The letter was
given to our emissary, and I ascended the loftiest of the mountain pinnacles, to t чатшс for myself the nature of the ground Trom my height the view was complete tht whole interior of the fortress by open and in tho same glance, I saw the grace and regal grandeur of design, which Greek taste could stamp even upon the strength of military urcln tecture, and the utter hopelessness of any direct assault upon Masada, by less than an army Who but he that has actually been in the same situation, can conceive tho feelings with which I gazed ' Below me, was the spot ш which α few hours must see me conqueror or nothing ' On that battlement I might before another morn, be stretched m blood ' on that tower I might bo fixed a lion id spec tacle ' Nature is irresistible, and her workings overpowered the old belief, that a mysterious sentence was to give me a miser ible perpetuity of life The tliought has always terribly re turned, but the moment of energy has always txtinguished it, the hurrying and swelling cur rent of my heart rolled over it, as the summei
torrent rushes over the tomb on its bunk The melancholy memorial was there, sure to re ap¬ pear with the first subsiding, but, lost while the flood of feeling whirled along Every group of soldiery that slept, or sang, or gamed, or gazed, along the ramparts under the bright and quiet day which followed so fear¬ ful a night, every archer pacing on his tower, overy solitary wanderer in the streets, every change of the guard, every entering courier , was visible to me, and all were objects of keen interest At length, my courier came I saw his approach from a pass of the mountains at the remotest point from our cover, his well- contrived exhaustion, the ostentations dust upon his tattered habiliments, and the fearless impu¬ dence with which he beguiled the sulky guard at the gate, and stalked before the centurion by whom he was brought to the Governor With what eyes of impatience I now watched the sun ' I wished for the power of extinguish¬ ing dav from the heavens As the hour of fate approached, the fever of the mind grew To defer the attack beyond the night, was to abar-
ilon it for by morn the troops under Floru must reach Masad ι Yet a strange sensation ι dullness of heart sometimes came on me ш which my hands were as feeble as an infants I felt like one before a tribunal, avaitmg the word that must decide his destiny Nothing tries the soul more deeply than this concentra tion of its fortunes into a few moments The man sees himself standing on the edge of a pre cipice down which there is no second step But the thought of returning errandless and humi hated and this too, from my first enterprise, was intense bitterness I made my decision From that instant I breathed freely, my strength returned, hope glowed in my bosom, and clinging to the granite spire of the mountain, I looked down upon the haughty strong hold like its evil genius descending from the clouds The sun touched the western ndge A horse man came at full stretch across the plain at its foot and entered the fortress He evidently brought news of importance, for the troops were hurried under arms, flags hoisted on the ram
parts, and the valls lined with archers All was military bustle My first conception was, that my emissary had betrayed us, and that we were about to be attacked I plunged from the pinnacle, and was following the windings of the goat-track to our lair, when I saw the rising of α cloud of dust in the distance It moved with grpat ra pul ity, and soon developed its contents Intel bgence of the assault jad reached Florus His sagacity saw what perils turned on the loss of the fortress, he shook off bis indolence, and came without delay to its succour Banners, helmets, and scarlet cloaks, poured across the plain A torrent of brass, burning and flashing in the sun beam, continued to roll down the defile, and before the evening star glittered, the whole ca¬ valry of the fifteenth legion was trampling over the drawbridge of Masada Here was the death blow. My enterprise was henceforth tenfold more hopeless, but with me the time for prudence was past If the reinforcement had arrived but an hour before,
I should probably have given up the attempt in despair But my mind was ft\ed, I had made an internal vow, and if the whole host г f Rome were crowded within the walls beneath I should have hazarded the assault I descended, found my troop collected, and to my alarm and vexation, Constantius en feebled as ho was, obstinately determined to assault the rampart again With the noble daring of his enthusiastic heart he told me, that unless I suffared hmi to attempt the re trieval of his defeat, he felt it impossible to survive Shame and grief, said he, are as deadly as the sword, and never will I return to the face of her whom I love, nor of the family whom I honour, unless I can return with the consciousness of having at least deseived to be successful Against this I reasoned, but reasoned in vain We finally divided our followers I gave him the attack of the rampart which was to be the place of his triumph or his grave > flung my »elf into his embrace, and listened to his pai fing
steps, with a heart throbbing at every tread I then moved round the foot of the mountain towards the secret passage The night fell dark as we could wish 1 waited impatiently for the signal, a light from the walls Yet, no signal twinkled from wall or tower, and I began to distrust again, but while I lingered, a shout told me that Con stantius was already engaged " Let what will come, exclaimed I, ' Onward We scrambled up ihe face of the rock and at length found the entrance of the subterra nean It was so narrow, that even in fl ie day time it must have been nearly invisible from below A low iron door a few yards within the fissure was the first obstacle To beat it down might alarm the garrison The passage allowed but of our advance one by one I led the way, hatchet in 1 and A few blows given with as little noise as possible, broke the stones round the lock The doot gave way, and wc all ciept in In this manner we wound along for a distance which I began to think endless The passage was singularly toilsome We
ascended considerable heights, we descended steep paths, m which it was with the utmost difficulty that we could keep our feet, we heard the rush of waters through the darkness, blasts of bitter wind swept against us , the thick and heavy air that closed round us atter them, almost impeded our breathing, and from time to time the vapour of sulphur gave the fear¬ ful impression that we had lost our way, and were actually engulfed in the bowels of a burning mine. The heart of my hunters was bold, and they «till held on, but the mere fatigue of struggling through this poisoned atmosphere, was fast ex¬ hausting their courage I cheered them with what topics I could, but never was my imagi¬ nation more barren I heard, at every step I took, fewer feet following mo. The close and pestilenta! air was beginning to act even upon myself, but the great stake was playing above, and onward I must go. I dared not speak louder than in a whisper , soon no whisper re¬ sponded to mine I tottered on, til', overpow¬ ered by the feeling that our sacrifice was in
vam, a sensation like that of a sickly propen¬ sity to sleep bound up my faculties, and, whe¬ ther I slept or fainted, I for a time lost all re¬ collection. A roar, like thunder, overhead, roused me A sight the most superb burst on my awaking ryes , a roof of gold, arched so high, that even its splendour was partially dimmed, walls of diamond, pillared with a thousand columns of every precious gem, whole shafts of emerald, pavilions of jasper and beryl, couches wrought with pearl and silver, u floor, as far as the glance could pierce, studded with amethyst and ruby, treasures, to which the accumulated spoils of the Greek or the Persian were no thing, the finest devices of the most exquisite art, mingled with the most colossal forms which wealth could wear, opulence in its massive and negligent grandeur, opulence in its delicate, and almost spiritualized beauty, were before me A slender flame burning at the foot of an idol, lighted up this stupendous temple I was alone , but the orifice by which I had entered was visible, the light shot far down
into it, and I soon collected the greater number of my troop All were equally wrapt in won der and the superstitious feelings which the piesence of the Roman and Syrian idoluters had partially generated even in the Jewish mmd began to startle those brave men ' We had, perhaps, come into forbidden ground, the gods of the earth, whether gods or demons, were powerful, and we stood in the viol ited centre of the mountain " Tor the first time, I found the failure of my influence A few adhered to me, but the ma jority calmly declared that, however fearless of man they dared go no further I threw my self on the ground before the entrance of the cavern, and desired them to consummate their crime by trampling on their prince and leader But they were determined to retire I taunted them, I adjured them, I poured out the most vehement reproaches They stepped over me as I lay at the mouth of the fissure, and at length one and all left me to cry out m my dazzling solitude, against the treachery of hu¬ man faith, and the emptiness of human wishes
The roar agam rolled above I heard dis tant shouts and trumpets In the sudden and desperate consciousness that alt was now to be gained or lost, I rushed after the fugitives, to force them back I plunged mto the darkness, and grasped the first figure that I could over¬ take My hand fell on the iron cuirass of a Roman! my blood ran chill "We were be trayed , decoyed into the bowels of the m o un tain to be masaacred ' The figure started from me I gave a bhnd blow of the axe, and heard it crush through his helmet Tl e man fell at my feet. I wild ly demanded " low he came there, and how we might nmke our way into the hght ' You are undcne, ' said he faintly "Your spy was seized by the Procurator Your at tack was known, and the door of the subter¬ ranean left anguardtd, to entrap you This ρ issage was the enti ance to a former mine and in the mme ıs your grave The voice sank he gioaned, and was no more His words were s jon confirmed by the hur¬ ried return of mv mtn They had found the
passage obstructed by a portcullis, dropt since their entrance Torches were seen through the fissures above, and the sound of arms rat¬ tled round us The ambush was complete ' Now, said I, * we have but on«j thing lor it t —the sword, first for our enemy, last for ourselves If we must die, let us not die by Roman halters One and ail, we rushed back into the mme But we had now no leisure to look upon the beauty of those spars and crystals, which under the hght of the altar glittered and blushed with such gem like radiance- From that altar rose а fierce and broad pyramid of fire, piles of fugots, continually poured from a grating above, fed the blaze to intolerable fierceness Smoke filled the mine To escape wus beyond hope The single orifice had been already tried Around us was a solid wall as old as the world It was already heating with the bhze our feet shrank from the floor The flame, shooting in a thousand spires, coiled and sprang against the roof, the walls, and the
grouau To remam where we were, was to be a cinder The catastrophe was inevitable ' In the madness of pain, I made a furious bound luto the column of fire. All followed, for deavh was certam, and the sooner it came the better With unspeakable feelings I saw, at the back of the mound of stone on which the fagots burned, an opening, hitherto concealed by the huge figure of the idol We crowded into it, here we were at least out of reach of the flame But what was our chance, but that of a more hngering death' We hurried in, a portcullis stood across the passage ' What was to be our fate, but famine ? We must perish ш а linger¬ ing misery—of all miseries the most appalling, and with the bitter aggravation of penshmg un¬ known worthless useless, stigmatised for slaves or dastards' What man of Israel would ever hear of our deaths 7 What chronicler of Rome would deign to vindicate our absence from the combat 7 We were within hearing of that combat The assault thundered more wildly than ever
over our heads, the alternate shout of Jew aud Roman descended to us But where were we ' caged, dungeoned, doomed' If the earth laid hor treasures at my feet that night, I would have given them for one hour of freedom, one saving, hallowed effort Oh ' for one struggle beside my warriors, to redeem my name, and avenge my country The contrast subdued me utterly I sank into a corner, and wept like а child The roar of battle grew feeble " Was all lo«t 7 Constantius slain 7 for with life he would not yield. Was the whole hope of Judea crushed at a blow 7 " I cried aloud to my fol lowers to force the portcullis. They dragged and tore at the bars But it was of a solid strength, that not ten times ours could master. In the midst of our hopeless labours, the sound of heavy blows above caught my ear, and fragments of rock fell ш, the blows were con¬ tinued Was this but ρ new expedient to crush or suffocate us 7 A crevice showed the light of a torch over¬ head I grasped the axe to strike a last blow at the gate, and die —I heard a voice pro-
uounce my name ' Another blow opened tlu roof A face bent down, and a loud laugh proclaimed my crazy friend. " Ha' said he, " are you there at last ? You have had a hard night's work of it. But, come up, I have an incomparable joke to tell you about the tribune and the procurator Come up, my prince, and see the world " I had no time to rebuke his jocularity I climbed up the s*de of the passage, and iound myself still in a dungeon To my look of dis¬ appointment, he gave no other answer than a laugh, and unscrewing a bar from the loop¬ hole above his head, ** It is my custom," said he, " to make mvself at my ease, wherever I go ,"apd as pnsons fall to a man's lot, like other things, I like to be able to leave my mansion whenever I am tired of it " " Forward then," said I, impatiently " Backward/ said the beggar, with the most unruffled coolness " That loop-hole ¡s for me dlone I may be under the governor's care again, and 1 have showed it to you now, merely as a curiosity Drink, my brave fellows," said
he, turning to the troop below, and giving them ι skin of wme " Soldiers must have their comforts, my gallant prince," as well as beg¬ gars If that villam Procurator had not come by express, (for no man alive is quicker to catch an idea, where he is likely to lose ox gain,) you should have been by this time sleeping in the governors bed, and the governor, probably, supping with me But all is fortune, good and bad, in this world The Procurator, putting your escape and mine together, began to think that his presence might be useful here, and the laziest rogue in Palestine came with a speed that might have done honour to the quickest, who stands before you in my person I had gone on swimmingly with the governor on the strength of your love-letter, angry as it made him But the first sight of Florus put an end to my chance of opening the gates for your triumphal entry I was tied, neck and heels and flung here, to be gibbeted to morrow morning But that morning has not come yet He paced the cell uneasily At length he
sprang up, and looking from the loop İmle, whia pered " Now ' —A low, creaking sound of ma chinery followed " Down mto the cavern,' said he, " thit accursed cohort has moved at last Away, my prince, and seek your fortune I exhibited some reluctance to be engulfed again But his countenance assumed a вшЫед sternness His only word was " Down ' As we were parting, he solemnly pronounced,— " May whatever power befriends the righteous cause, and blasts the man of infamy and blood, send the Ughtuings before you '" A tear stood in his uplifted eye His worn countenance flushed, as he spoke the words He seized a spear from a corner, and plunged after me into the cavern The portcullis no longer obstructed us, the passage opened at the foot of the rampart My heart bounded, I could have rushed upon an army The same eagerness was m us all But the hand of our guide was on my shoulder " Your attack,' said he, " can be nothing, un less it be a surprise Move along unseen if possible, till you come to the flank of the first

CHAPTER IX. Resistance was at an end, and we had now nothing to do, but to prevent the con¬ flagration from snatching the prize out of our hands The flames rose menacingly from the roof of the palace, and another hour might see the famous arsenal beyond the power of man Leaving to Constantius the care of securing the prisoners, I entered the palace, followed by α detachment In the bustle, I had missed my deliverer, but scarce¬ ly could think about him, or any thing else, while the enemy were showenng lances and shafts as thick as snow upon us But now, some fears of his extravagance recurred to me,
and I ordered strict search to be made for him The fire had seized on but a wing of the palace, and was speedily extinguished I was ascending the stair, when a figure bounded full against me from α side-door It was the beggar His voice, however, was my only means of recognition, for his outw ard man had undergone a total change Ile woie a rich cunass and helmet, a Greek falchion glittered in his embroidered belt, a tissued mantle hung over his shoulder, and a spear pondeious, but inlaid and polished with the nicest art, was bran dished in his hand.

There was but one exception, which I might hav e guessed— he tribune He was all humiliation, stooped to make some abject request about his baubles, and was probably on the point of apolo¬ gizing tor his ever having taken up the trade of war, when I turned on my heel, and shook hands with my old friend the Captain He looked in evident perplexity At lust, through even the grim evidences of the night's wot к on my countenance, and the problem of my pompous mantle, his brightening eye began to recognize me, and he burst out with, " The Arab, by Jupiter 1 " But when I asked lnm, " what had become of his baggage," I touched a tender
string, and with α countenance as erst down as if he had sustained an irrep trahie calamity he told me that his whole travelling cell ir was m the hands of my men, and it was his full belief, that he was at that moment not worth ι flask in the wide world Tha tribune turned away in conscious dis grace, and I sent him to α dungeon to medi tate till moru on the awkwardness of insolence to strangers With the others I sat down to such entertainment as a sacked fortress could supply, but which hunger, thirst, and fatigue rendered worth all the banquets of the idle The old captain cheeied his soul, and grew ihe toneal Wine, said he, flask m hand, " does wonders It is the true leveller, for it leaves no troublesome inequality of conditions It is the true sponge that pays all debts at sight, for it makes us forget the existence ofucreditoi It is the t ue fnend, that sticks by a man to the last drop, the faithful mistress, that jilts no man, and the most charming of wives, whose tont ue no hush ind hears, whose com рапу ıs equally delightful at all hours, and who

to be believed, the place of many a mysterious celebration, unlawful to be seen by human eyes The building was m the centre of the citadel, and was of the stateliest architecture The massive doors were thrown open At the first step, I shrank from the blaze of steel and gold that shot back against the torches The walls of this gigantic hall were covered with arms and armour of every nation—cuirasses, Persian, Roman, and Greek, the plate mail of the Gaul, the Indian chain armour,—innumerable head¬ pieces, from the steel cap of tbe Scythian, to the plumed and triple-crested helmet of the Greek, the richest combination of strength and beauty ever borne by soldiership—shields of every shape and sculpture; the Greek orb, the Persian rhomb, the Cimmerian crescent,—all arms the ponderous spear of the phalanx, the Thracian pike, the German war-hatchet, the Italian javelin,—the bow, from the Nubian, twice the height of man, to the small half circle of the Assyrian cavalry,—swords, the bro t d- bladed and fearful falchion of the Roman, every thrust of which let out a life, tho huge two-
banded sword of the Baltic tribes, the Synan scimitar, the Persian acinaces, tho deep·· hilted knife of the Indian islander, the Arab poniard, the serrated blade of the Afriean, all were there, in their richest models—the collec¬ tion of Herod's life War had raised him to a rank, which allowed the indulgence of his most lavish tastes of good and ill, the sword w ıs his true sceptici and never king bore the sign of his sovereignty more royally emblazoned After long admiration of this display of the wealth dearest to the soldier, I was retiring when a slave approached, and piostratmg him¬ self, told mo that а hall remained, still more singular, " the hall in which the Great Ηο-πΊ γργρι^Ί his death warning I gized ťuiud the aimoury, there was no door but the one by which we had entered-----. " Not here," said tbe Ethiopian, " yet it is beside us The foot of a Roman has never entered it The secret remained with me alone Hoes my lord command that it shall be revealed ? " Ί he order was given The slave took down
one of the coats of m ul, pushed back a valve, and we entered a winding stair which led us downwards for somo minutes 'lhe narrow pass igo and heavy air reminded me of the subterranean Our torches burned dimly, and the visages of my attendants showed how little their gallantry was to be relied on, if we were to be brought into contact with magwm is and ghosts ' Here, said the Ethiopian, ' it wis the custom of the great king, in his declining years, when his heart "vas broken by the loss of the most beloved of lus wives, und maddened by the conspiracies of the princes his sons, to come and consult others than the God of Jerusalem Here the Chaldee men of wisdom came to raise the spirits of the departed, md show the fates of his kingdom We are now in the bowels of the mountain He loosed a chain, which disappeared into the ground with a hollow noise. A. huge mass of rock slowly rolled back, and showed a depth of darkness thiough which our twinkling torches scarcely made way
" Stop,' said tlie slave, " I should have first lighted the shrine " He left us, and we shortly saw a blaze of many colours on a tripod in the centre As the blaze strengthened, n scene of wonder awoke before the eye A host of armed men grew upon the darkness The immense vault was peopled with groups of warriors, all the great military leaders of the world, ш their nati ι arms, and surrounded by a cluster of their captains, the disturbers of the earth, from Sesostns dov n to Cæsar and Antony, brandish nig the lance, or reining the charger, each in his known attitude of command There rushed Cyrus in the scythed chariot, surrounded by his horsemen, hardt d from head to heel There Alexander, with the binner of Macedón waving above his head, and armed as when he leaped into the Grantcus There Hannibal, upon the elephant tint he rode at Cannœ. There Cæsar, with the head of Pompey at his feet. Those, and α long succession of the masters of victory, each in the moment of supreme fortune, made the vault a representa* tive palace of human glory. But the view from
the entrance told but liulf the tale It wis when I advanc d and lifted the torch to the countenance of the first group that the moral was visible All the visages were those ol skele tons The costly armour was upon 1 ones lhe spears and sceptres were brandished 1 y the thin fingers of tho grave Ihe vault was the repre sentativt sepulchre of human vanity Ibis wis one of the funtistic fits of α mmd which felt too late the emptiness of earthly honours Half pagan the powerfil intellect of the man gave way to the sullen superstitions of the murderer Egypt was still the mystic tyrant of Palestine and Herod in his despair, sank into the slavo of a credulity at once weak end terrible In the last hours of а long and deeply varied life exhausted more by misery of soul than disease when medicine wus hopeless and he hatl returned from trying the famous springs of Calhrhoc in vain the king ordered himself to be brought mto this vault, and left alone He remained in it for some hours The attend ants were at length roused by hideous waitings,
they broke open the entrance, and found lnm in α paroxysm of terror The vault was tilled w th the strong odours of some magical preparations still burning on the tripod lhe sound of de¬ parting feet was heard, hut Herod sat alone In accents of the wildest woe, he declared that he had seen the statues filled with sudden life, and charging him with the death of his wife and children He left Masada instantly, pronouncing a curse upon the hour in which he first listened to the arts of Egypt He was carried to Jericho, and there laid on a bed from which he never rose Alternate bursts of blasphemy and re morse made his parting moments frightful But tyi mny was in his last thought, and he died holding in his band the order for the massacre of every leading man in Judea
CHAPTER \ Тн L first decided blow of the war was given I had incurred the full wrath of Rome the trench between me and forgiveness was impass able and I It a stern delight in the conviction tint hope of truce or pardon was at an cud the seizure of Masada was a defiance of the whole power of the emp re But it had the higher importance of a triumph at the beginning of a wai the moment when even the courageous are perplexed by doubt and the timid watch their opportunity to raise the cry of ill fortune It showed the facility of conquest where men are determined to run the full risk of good or evil it shook the mıh
tary credit of the enemy, by the proof that they could be over mal ci cd in activity spirit, and conduct The capture of а Roman fortress by assault was a thm г almost unheard of But the consummate value of the enterprise was ш its deehiation to those who would fight, that they had leadeis, ible and willing to take the last chance with them for the freedom of their country When day broke, and the strength of this celebrated fortress was fairly visible, I could scarcely believe that our success was altogether the work of rr un The genius of ancient fortifi cation produced nothing more remarkable than Masada It stood on the summit of α height, so sh ep that the sun never leached the bottom of the surrounding defiles Its outer wall was а mile round, with thirty-eight towers, each eighty feet high Immense marble cisterns, granaries, like palaces, capable of holding pro visions for years, exhaustlesa arms and military engines, in buildings of the finest Greek art, and defences of the most costly skill, at every commanding point of the interior, showed the
kuigly niagmhetnce and warlike care ot tht most brilli uit, d iring, and successful monarch of Judea, since Solomon By the first sun be im, a new wonder struck the multitude, whom the tumult of the night had gathered on the neighbounng hills I ordered the great standard of Naplitali to be hoisted on the citadel It was raised in the midst of shouts ind hymns, and the huge scarlet folds spread out, majestically displaying the ■чпЫега of our tribe, the Silver Stag, before the morn Shouts echoed and re echoed round the honzon The lull tops, covered as far as the eye could reach, did homage to the banner of Jewish deliverance, and, inspired by the sight, every man of their thousands took sword and spear, und made ready for battle My first care was to relieve the mind of mv family, and Constantius, with triumph m every feature, and love and honour glowing in his heart, was made the bearer of the glad tidings The duties of command devolved rapidly on me An army to be raised— α plan of opera tions to be determined on—the chieftains of the country to be combined—and the profligate
feuds of Jerusalem to be extinguished, were difliculties, that lay before my first step It is in preliminaries like those, that the buminţ spint of а man, full of the manliest resolutions and caring no more for personal safety than he cares for the weed under his feet, is fated to feel the true troubles of high enterprise I soon experienced the wretchedness of having to contend with the indolent the artful, and the bise My mind, eager to follow up the first success, was entangled m tedious and in trícate négociation, with men whom no sense of right or wrong could stimulate to mtegiity Rival interests to be conciliated—gross cor ruptions to be crushed—paltry passions to be stigmatised—family hatreds to be reconciled— childish antipathies—grasping avarice—giddy ambition—savage cruelty, to be rectified, pro pitmted, oi punished, were among my tasks, before I could plant a foot m the field Γι those are the fruits that grow round even the righteous cause, what must be the rank crop of conspiracy ' But one point I speedily settled The first assemblage of the chieftains satisfied me of the
absurdity of councils of war Every man had his plan, and every plan contemplated some personal object I saw that to discuss them would be úseles" and endless I had already begun to learn the diplomatic art of taking my own way, with tlie most unruffled aspect I begged of the proposers to reduce their views to writing, received their papers with perfect civility, took them to my cabinet, and gave their brilliancy to add to the blaze of my fire High station is soon compelled to dissemble. A month before, I should have spoken out my mind, and treated the plans and the proposers alike with scorn But a month before, I was neither general nor statesman Treed from the encumbrance of many councillors, I de¬ cided ou a rapid march to Jeiusalem,— there wrj power and glory in the word bv this measure I should be master of all that final victory could give, the popular nund, the national resource s, and the highest prize of the most successful war. Those thoughts banished rest from my pillow I passed day and night in a perpetual, feverish,
exaltation of mind, yet, if I were to compute my few periods of happiness, among th*»m would he tho week wheal could neither eat driuk, nor sleep, from the meie overflowing of my warlike rivenes at Masada We miy well foi give the splenetic apathy md sullen scorn of life, thit beset the holder of power, when time or chance leaves Ins grasp empty The mighty monarch , the general, on whose sword hung the balance of empues, the statesman, on whose council lose or sank the welfare of millions, fallen into inaction, sunk into the feeble and unexciting employments of common life, their genius and their fame a burden and а reproach, the source of а restless and in dignant contrast between what they were and what they are, how feeble an emblem of such minds is the lion fanged, 01 the eagle chained to a log ' We may pass by even the fooleries which so often make the world stare at the lattei years of famous men When they can no longer soar to their natural height, all beneath is equal to them, our petty wisdom is not worth their trouble They scorn the little opi
nions of common-place mankind, and follow their own tastes—contemptuously trifle, and proudly play the fool Befoie the week was out, I was at the head of a hundred thousand men, I was the cham pion of a great country, tlie leader of the most formidable insurrection that ever contended with Rome in the East, the general ot an army whose fidelity and spirit were not to be surpassed on earth Could ambition ask more ' There was even more, though too solemn to be asked by human ambition My nation was sa cred , a cause above human nature was to be fought for, in that cause I might, at once, re deem my own name from obscurity, and be the instrument of exalting the name, authority, and religion of a people, the regal people of the Sovereign of all ' Constantius returned It was in vain that 1 had directed my family to take refuge in the mountain country of Naphtah. My authority was for once disputed at home Strong affec- tior mastered fear, and, swift as love could speed, I saw them entering the gates of Masada
Such meetings can come but once in a lift· I was surrounded by innocent fondness, beauty most admirable, urd faith ihat no misfortunes could shake, and I was surrounded by them in an hour when prosperity seenit d labouring to lavish on me ull the wishes of muu. I felt too, bv the glance with which Miriam looked upon hei " lit ro,' that I had earned а higher title to the worlds respect Had she found me m chuins, she would have shared them without а murmur But her lofty heart rejoiced to find her husband thus vindicating his claims to the homage ot mankind Yet to those matchless enjoyments I gave up but one day By the next dawn, the trumpet sounded for the march I knew the importance of following up the first blow in all wars, its indispensable importanti in a war of insurrec¬ tion To meet the disciplined troops ot Rome in pitched battles would be madness. The true manoeuvre wus, to distract their attention by variety of onset, cut off their communications, keep their camps in perpetual alarm, and make our activity, numbers, and knowledge of Mic
country the substitutes for equipment, expen ence, und the science of the soldier In summoning those brave men, I adhered to the regulutions of tho law of vur prophet, a law whose humanity and regard for natural feelings, distinguished it in the most striking m inner from the stern violences of the p^gan levy No man was required to take up air^s who had built a house and had not dedicated it, no man who had planted а vineyard or olive ground, aud had not yet reaped the produce, uo mm who had betrothed a wife, and had not yet taken liei home, and, no man during the first year of his marriage My prisoners were my last embarrassment. To leave them to the chance of popular mercy, or to leave them immured in the fortress, would be cruelty To let them loose, would be, of course, to give so many soldiers to the enemy. I adopted the simpler expedient of marching then to Berytus, seizing a detachment of tho Roman provision ships, and embarking the whole for Italy To my old friend the captain, whose cheer- VUL II H
fulness could be abated only by a failure of the vintage, I oflered а tranqud settlement among oui bilis The etiquette of soldiership was for¬ midably tasked by iny offer, for the veteran лав thoroughly weary of his thankless service He hesitated, swore that I deserved to be a Ro¬ man, and even а captain of horse, but finished by saying that, bad a trade as the army was, he was too old to learn a better I gave him and some others their unconditional liberty, and he parted from the Jewish rebel with more obvioub logret, than perhaps he ever dreamed himself capable ef feeling for any thing but his horse and his bottle Eleazar took fhe charge of my family and the command of Masada The sun burst out with cheeiful omen on the troops, as I wound down the steep road, named the Serpent, from 'U ex¬ treme obliquity The sight before me was of a nature to exhilarate the heaviest heart, an immense host making the air ring with accia mations at the coming of their chieftain The mental perspective of public honours and na¬ tional service, was still more exalting. Yet I
felt a boding depression, as if within those walls hud begun and ended my prosperity. On the first ridge which crossed our march, I instinctively stopped to give a farewell look The breeze had sunk, and the scarlet banner shook out its folds to the sun no more, a clond hung on the mountain peak, and covered the tortress with gloom I turned away. The omen was true ' But «ickly thoughts were forgotten, when we were once fairly on the march Who that has ever moved with an army, has not known its ready cure for heaviness of heart' The sound ot the moving multitude, their broad mirth, the mere trampling of their feet, the picturesque lights that fall upon the columns as they piss over the inequalities of the ground, keep the eye and the mmd singularly alive Our men felt the whole delight ot the scene, and gambolled like deer, or horses let loose mto pasture But to the military habits of Con¬ stantius, this π do vigoni w ıs the highest vex¬ ation He galloped from flank to flank with hopeless diligence, found that his arrangements
only perplexed our bold peasantry the more, and at length fairly relinquished the idea of gaining any degree of credit by the brilliancy of then discipline But I, no more a tactician than themselves, was content with seeing in them the material of the true soldier the spear was carried rudely, but the hand that carried it was strong, the maich wns irregular, but the step was firm, if there was song, and mirth, and clamour, thej were the cheerful voices of the brave, and I could lead in the counte nances of ranks, that no skill could keep m order, the hardihood and generous devotedness that in wars like ours, havo so often baffled the proud, and left of the mighty but clav. During the day, we saw no enemy, and drove along with the unembarrassed step of men going up to one of the festivals The march was hot, the zeal of our young soldiers made it ïapid, and we continued it long after their usual hour of repose. But then sleep took its thorough revenge. It was fortunate for our fame that the enemy were not nigh, for sleep f istened irresistibly and at once upon the whole
multitude Sudine Is were planted in vain, the spears fell from their hands, and the watchers weie tranquilly laid side by side with the slum¬ bering. Outposts and the usual precautionary arrangements wore equally useless. Sleep was our master. Constantius exerted his vigilance with fruitless activity, and, beforo an hour passed, he and I were probably the sole senti neis of the grand army of Judea. "What can bo done with such sluggaids'" said he, indignantly pointing to the heaps that, wrapped in their cloaks, coveied the fields fai round, and in the moonlight looked more like surges tipped with foam, than human beings " What can be done '—wondeis " " Will they over bi able to manœuvre m the face of the legions '' " Never " " Will they ever be able to move like regular tioops' ' " Növer " " Will they ever be able to keep then eyes open after sunset ľ 1
"Never, after such a march as we have given them to-day." " What then, under heaven, will they be good for ľ' " To beat tho Romans out of Palestine !"
CHVPTĽR XI Bl foks the sun was up, my peasants were on the march again From the annual journeys of the tribes to the great city, no country was cvei known so well to its whole population as Palestine. Every hill, forest, and mountain stream, was now saluted with a shout of old recognition Discipline was forgotten, as we approached those spots of memory, and the troops rambled loosely over the ground on winch in gentler timos they had rested tu the midst of their caravans. Constantius had many an irri¬ tation to encounter, but I combated his wroth, and pledged myself, that when the occasion arrived, my countrymen would show the native vigour of the soil
"Let these brave peasants take then way,' said I " If they will not make an army, let fhern make a mob , let them come into the field with the bold propensities and generous passions of their nature, unchecked by the trammels of regular warfare, let them feel themselves men and not machines, and I pledge ™>yself foi heir > ictory " " They will soon have an opportunity look yonder" He pointed to a low range of misty hills some miles onward, "Are we to light the clouds 7 foi I can see nothing else." " Our troops, I think, would be exactly the proper antagonists But there is one cloud upon those lulls, that something more than the wind must drive away " The sun threw α passing gleam upon the heights, and it was returned by the sparkling of spears. The enemy were before us. Constan¬ tius galloped with SGine of our hunters to the front, to observe their position. The trumpets sounded, and my countrymen ]ustified all tha* I had said, by the enthusiasm that lighted up
eveiy countenance it the hopo of coming in contact with the oppicssor We adv meed shouts rang fiom tribe to tribe we quickened our pice at length the whole multitude ran At the foot of tho height every man pushed forward without w uting foi his fell w it was а complete confusion Πιο chief lorco against us wis civilly and I siw them prepiringto einige We must suffei prodi 0 iously let the dav en I how it would The whole campaign might hang on the first repulse I stood in ago ıy I saw the squadrons level their 1 uiccs I s iw the centurions d sh out in front All was ready for the f ital cl arge To my asto nishmcnt the whole of the cavalry wheeled iound and disappeared The panic was like miracle—equally rapid and unaccountiblo I role to the top of t 1, hill ind ciscou-ied the secret Constantius observing the enemy s attention taken up with my alv neo had made his way round the heights His trumpet gave the first notice of the manoeuvre Their rear was threatened and tlie cavalry fled, leaving a cohort in our h inds
The first success in war is as full of conse¬ quences as the first repulse. The flight and cap¬ ture of any fragment of the legions, was magni¬ fied into a sign of perpetual triumph But never was successful soldier honoured with a more clamorous tnnmph than Constantius Na¬ ture speaks out among her untutored sons Envy has nothing to do in such fields as ours He was applauŕ ed to the skies " Well," said I, as I pressed the gallant hand that had planted the first laurel on our brows , " you see that, if ploughmen and shep herds make rude soldiers, they make capital judges of soldiership You might have con quered α kingdom without receiving hall this panegj ι ic ш Rome " The service is but begun, and we shall have another lesson to get or give befoie to morrow Those fellows are grateful, I allow, said he, with a smile, "but you must allow that, for what has been done, we have to thank the discipline that brought us in the Roman rear " Yes, and the discipline that made them so much alarmed about their rear, as to run
away , when they might have charged and beuten us ' lhis little affair put us all in spirits, and the song» and cheerful clamours burst out with lenewod animation. But tho symptoms ot the enemy soon became thicker. We found the mined cottugo, the torn up garden, the burnt 01 chard, those habitual evidences of the camp As w e adv auced, the tracks of waggons and of the huge wheels of the military enguias were fiesh in the grass, and from time to time some skele¬ ton of a beast of burden, or some half covered wieck of man, showed thit desolation had walked theie, the cavalry soon showed them selves on the heights in latgcr bodies, but all was forgotton in the sight that at length rose upon the horizon, we beheld, bathed in the richest glow of a summers eve, the summits of the mouutams round Jerusilcm, and glorious above them, Uke anothei sun, the golden beauty oí the Temple of temples. What Jew ever eaw that sight but with ho¬ mage of heart ' Vim fancies may declaim of the rapture of returning to ones country after
long years Raptuie' to find ourselves in a land of sti uigers, ourselves forgotten, our early scenes so t hanged, that we can scarcely retrace them, filled up with new faces, or with the old so woi n by time and care, that we read in them nothing but the emptiness of human hope, the whole woild new, frivolous, and contemptuous of oui feelings Where is the mother, the sis¬ ter, the woman of our heait ? we find their only memorials among the dead, aud bitterly feel that our true country is the toi ib. But the return to Zion was not of the things ot this world The Jew saw befoio him the city of prophecy and power Mortal thoughts, individual sonows, the melancholy expenences of human life, had no place among the mighty hopes th it gathered over it, like angels' wings. Restoi at ion, boundless empire, impei ishuble gloiy, were the writing upon its bulwarks It stood bciore him the Universal City, whose gates weie to be open for the reveience of all time, the symbol to the earth of the returning piesence of the Great King, the promise to the Jew of an empire, triumphant over the casual-

divested of its grosser incumbrances, on a bright and boundless career of lortune. But recollections never to be subdued, sad¬ dened my memory of the Temple, and when the first influendo of the worship passed, I turned from the sight of what was to me the eternal monument of the heaviest crime and calamity of man 1 gave one partiu,; glance, us day died upon the spires. To my surprise, they were darkened by more than twilight, I glunced again, smoke rolled cloud on cloud over Mount Monah , flame, and the distant roar of battle st utled us—" had the enemy anticipated our march, and was Jerusalem about fo be stormed before our eyes ' ' We were not long left to conjectuie. Crowds of fnghtencd women and children were seen tiving across the country The юлт swelled again, we answered it by cries of indignation, and rushed onward Unable to ascertain the point of attack, I halted the multitude at the entrance of one of tho roads ascending to the Great gate of the Upper citv, and galloped for¬ ward with α few of my people.
A horsoman rushed from the gate with а heedless rapidity, which must have flung htm into the midst of us, or sent him over the preci¬ pice His voice alone enabled me to recognise in this furious rider my kinsman Jubal But novei had a tew months so altered a human being Instead of the bold and m írttal figure of the clueft un I siw an emaciated and ex¬ hausted man, app irently in the last stage of life or sot row the florid t heck was of the colour of clay the fl islnng gl ince vv ıs sunken , the loud and cheerful voice was sepulchral I welcomed him with the utturul regard of our relationship but his perturbation was fearful, he trembled, grew fiu y red, and could return my greeting only with a feeble tongue and a wild eye But this was no tine for private feelings I inquired the state ot things in Jerusilem Here his emb irrassment was thrown aside and the natuial energy of the man found room Jeiusalem has three curses at this houi, s ud he fiercely, the pi testi, the people, and the Romans, and the last is the lightest of the three —The priests bloated with indulgence,

success The legionaries, sure of the morning s march into Jerusalem, and the plunder of the Temple, were caught leaning ra crowds over the rumpurts, unarmed, and making absolutt holiday Саша Ct,stius, their insolent general, was carousing m his tent after the fatigues of the evening The tribunes followed hi& ex amplo , the soldiery saw nothing to require their superior abstemiousness, and the wine was flowing freely in healths to the next days rapine, when onr roar opened their eyes. To resist was out of the question Fifty thousand spearmen, as danng as ever lifted weapon, and inflamed with the feelings of their harassed country, were in thoir midst, and they ran in all directions, I pressed on to the generals tent, but the prize bad escaped he was gone, ou the first alarm My followers indignantly set it on fire tho blaze spread, and the flame ot the Roman camp rolled up, like the flame of ι sacrifice to tlio god of battles The seizure of the position was the rum of the detachments abandoned between the hill and the city At the sight of the flames, the
gates were flung open, nnd Constantius drove the assailants from point to point, until our shouts told him that we were marching upon their rear The shock then was final The cohorts, dispirited and surprised, broke like water, and scarcely a man of them lived to boast of having insulted the walls of Jerusalem Day arose, and the Temple mot tho nsing beam, unstained by the smoke of an enemy s fire The wreck of the legions lay upon the declivities, like the fragments of a fleet on the shore But this sight, painful °n to an enemy, was soon forgotten in tho concourse ot the rescued citizens, the exultation of tho troops, and the etili more seducing vanities that filled tho heart of their clueft un. Towards noon, а long train of the principal people headed by tho priests and elders, was seon issuing from the gates to congratulate me Music and triumphant shouts announced their approach through the valley My heart bounded with the fetlings of α conqueror The whole long vista of national honours, the popular praise, the personal dignity, fhe power
of tiampUng upon the malignant, the clearance of iny character, the right to take the future lead on all occasions of puhho service and princely renown, opened before my dazzled eye I was standing alone upon the brow of the promontory As far as the eye could reach, all was in motion, and alt was directed to me the homage of soldiery, priests, and people, cen tred in my single being I involuntarily ut¬ tered aloud—" At last, I shall enter Jerusalem in triumph. I heaid a voice at my side— ' Never shall you enter Jerusalem, but ip sor- An indescribable pang accompanied the words There was not a living soul uear me to have uttered them The troops were stand¬ ing at a distance below, and in perfect silence The words were spoken close to my ear But I fatally knew the voice and conjecture was at an end My hmbs. felt poweiless, as if I had been struck by lightning I called Jubal up the peak to assist me But the blow that smote my frame, seemed to have smote his mmd His
look had grown tenfold more haggard in this single night His eyes rolled wildly, his speech was a collée* on of unmeaning sounds, or the language of a fierce disturbance of thought, al together unintelligible. A lunatic stood befoie Was this to be the foretaste of my own in¬ flictions ' I shuddered as the past horrors rose upon my memory Or was! to see my kindred friends, family, put under the yoke of bodilv and mental misery, as а menace of the punish ment that was to cut asundei my connexion with human nature '
CHAPTER λ II Is pain and terror I drew my unfortunate kinsman from the gaze of the troops, and en treated him to tell me by what melanchclv chance his feelings had been thus disturbed He looked at me with a fieice glance, and half unsheathed his dagger But I was not to be repelled, and still laboured to soothe him He hurriedly grasped tl e weapon, flung it down the steep, and sinking at my feet, burst uto tears An uproar m the valley roused me from the contemplation of this wreck of youth and hope The enemy, though defeated, had suffered little comparative loss The pnde of the legions could not brook the idea of defeat, by what
they deemed the rabble of tho city and the fields Cestius, under cover of the broken country on our flanks, had rallied the fugitives of the camp, and now,between me and the city, were rapidly advancing in columns, forty thou sand men The manœuvre was bold It might either cut us oil from Jerusalem, and force us to fight at a ruinous disadvantage, or leave the city totally exposed But, like all daring games, it was perilous, and I was determined to make the haughty Roman feel that he had an anta¬ gonist who would not leave the game at his discretion From tbe pinnacle on which I stood, the whole champaign lay beneath me Nothing t ould be lovelier The grandest combinations of art and nature were before the eye—Jeru¬ salem on her hills, а city of palaces, and in that hour displaying her full pomp her towers streaming with banners, her battlements crowd ed with troops, her priesthood and citizens in their festal habits, pouring from the colossal gates, and covering the plam with processions,
That plain itself, coloured and teeming with the richest produce of the earth, groves of the olive , declivities, purple with the vine, or yel low with corn, gleaming in the sun, sheets of vegetable gold, richer than ever was dug fiom Indian mine I gazed, with an eye enraptured by the scene of beauty. But the signals of my ad¬ vanced parties along the heights, soon told me that the enemy were m movement My plan was already adopted. On the right spread the plain, on the left lay the broken and hilly country, through which the enemy were moving by the three principal ravines I felt that, if fhey could unite and form, success, with our undisciplined levies, was desperate. The only hope was, of beating the columns separately, as they emerged into the plain The moment of action was rapidly arriving Cavalry had begun to scatter over the ground, and ride down upon the processions, wluch, startled at the sight, were instantly scattered, and flying towards Jerusalem " The day of congratulations is clearly over,'
said Tubal, pointing in scorn to the dispersed citizens " To day, at least, you will not re¬ ceive the homage of those hypocrites of the Sanhedrim " Nor, perhaps, to-morrow, fellow-soldier, for we must first see of what materials those columns are made If we beat them, we shall save the elders the trouble of crossing the plain, ind receive our honours within the walls " " In Jerusalem ! ' exclaimed he, wildly "No, never' You have dangers to encounter with¬ in those walls, that no art of man could with¬ stand , dangers keener than the dagger, more deadly than the aspic, more resistless than the force of armies' Enter Jerusalem, and you are undone I looked upon lum with astonishment But there was in his eye a sad humility, a strangely imploring glance, that formed the most singular contrast to the wildness of his words " Be warned ' said he, pressing close, as if he dreaded that his secret should be overheard. " I have seen horrid things, I have heard hor¬ rid things, since I lust entered the city Be- VOL, II
ware of the leaders of Jerusalem ' I telí you that they have fearful power, that their hate is inexorable, and that you are its great victim ' " This is altogether beyond my conception how have I offended ' * I know not, but mysterious things aie whispered You are charged with unutterable acts Your sudden abandonment of the priest hood sights seen in your deserted chambers, which not even the most daring would ventili e to inhabit —your escape from dangers, that must have extinguished any other human be mg, have bred fatal rumours It has been said that you worshipped in the bowels of the moun¬ tain of Masada, where the magic fire burns eter¬ nally before the form of the Evil One, that you even conquered the fortress, impregnable as it was to man, by a horrid compact, and that the raising of your standard was the declared sign of that compact, dreadfully to be repaid by you and yours ' " Monstrous and incredible calumnv ' Where was their evidence ? My actions were before the face of the world —Hypocrites and villains 1 '
" If your virtues nere writfii in a sun beam, envy would darken, malice pervert, and hatred destroy," exclaimed my kinsman, with the bold counten«nce and manly feeling of his better days " They have in their secret councils stained you with a fate more gloomy than I can comprehend-----that you are sentenced to even here the misery reserved for the guilty bevond the grave I felt as if he had stricken a lance through my heart Mortal sickness seized on every vein My blood was ice Fiery sparkles shot before my eyes " There," thought I, " is the first infliction of the sentence that is to separate to smite, to pursue me, to the last hour of tune ' I instinctively put iny hand to my brow, to feel if the mark of Cam were not already there 1 gave one hurried glance at Heaven, as if to see the form of the desti oying angel stooping over me But the consciousness that I was m the pre¬ sence of the multitude, compelled me to master my feelings I assumed a desperate firmness,
and commanded Jubal to be ready with his proofs of those calumnies, against the time when 1 should confound my accusers. But I spoke to the winds I need have dreaded no observer in lum. The interval of reason was gone. He burst out into the fiercest horrors " They pursue me '" excl umed he, " they come by thousands, with tho poniard and the poison ' they cry for blood ' they would drive me to a crime black as their own '" He flung himself at my feet, and clasping them, prevented every effort to save hun from this degradation He buried his fuce ui my lobe, and casting up а scared look fiom time to time, as if he shrank from some object of ter- lor, apostrophised his vision " Fearful being," he cried, " spare me, turn away those searching eyes, I have sworn to do the deed, and it shall be done I have sworn it against faith and honour, against the ties of nature, against the laws of Heaven, but it shall be done. Now, begone ' See ' ' he cowered, pointing to a cloud that floated across the sun, " see, he spreads his wings,
he hovers over me the thunders are flaming in his hands Begone Spirit of power and evil ' It shall ' uone ' Look, where he va nislies into the heights of his kingdom ' the prince of the power of the air ' The cloud whit h fed the fancy of my unfor¬ tunate kinsman dissolved and with it his fear of the temp'er But he 'ay exhausted at my feet,—hia eyes closed, his limbs shuddering,— the emblem of we ikness and despair I tri^d to rouse lum by that topic which would once have shot new life into hi« heroic heart ( Rise Jubal and see the enemy, whom we have so long thirsted to meet This battle must not be fought without you To day, nei iher magic nor chance shall be imputed to the conqueror, if I shall conquer Jerusalem sees the battle and before the face of my country I will show the faculties that make the leader, or will leave the last drop of my blood upon those fields The wirnor kindled within him He sprang from the ground, and shot down an eagle glance at the enemy, who had made rapid progress,
and were beginning to show the heads of their columns in the plain He was unarmed I gave bun my sword, and the proud humility wifh which he put it to his lips, was a pledge to me that it would be honoured in his hands " Glorious thing ' ' he exclaimed, as he Bashed it before the sun, " that raises man at once to the height of human honours, or sends him where no care can disturb his rest, thou art the true sceptre that guards and graces em pire , the true talisman, more powerful than all the arts of the enchanter l What, like thee, can lift up the lowly, enrich the destitute, restore the undone ' What talent, consummate know ledge, gift of nature nay, what smile of for tune can, like thee, in one hour bid the obscure stand forth the idol of a people, or the wonder of a world I Now, for glory 1 " he shouted to the listening circle of the troops, who answered him with shouts —" Now, for glory ' ' they cried, and poured after him down the side of the mountain The three gorges of the valleys through which the enemy moved, opened into the plain
at wide intervals from each other I delayed oar march until the moment at whicl the near* est column shou'd show its head I saw that the eagerness of Cestius to reach the open ground was already hurrying his columns, and tbat, from the comparative facilities of the ra vine ımmeclıütely under my position, the nearest column must arrive unsupported The moment came The helmets and spears were already pouring from the pass, when a gesture of my hand let loose the whole human torrent upon them Our advantage of the ground, our numbers, aad impetuosity, decided the fate of this division at once The legiona nes were not merely repulsed, they were abso¬ lutely trampled down, they lay as if a mighty wall, or a fragment of the mountain, had fallen upon them The two remaining columns were still to be fought Their solid front, the compact and broad mass of iron that rushed down the ra¬ vines, seemed irresistible, and when I cast α glance on the irregular and waving Unes be*
hind me, I felt the whole peril of the day Yet I feared idly. The enemy charged, and forced their way mto the very centre of the multitude, like two vast wedges crushing all before them But though they could repel, they could not conquer The spirit of the Jew fighting be lore Jerusalem was moie than heroism To extinguish a Roman, though at the instaut loss of life, to disable a single spear, though by receiving it in his bosom, to encumber with his corpse the steps of the adversary, was reward enough for the man of Israel I saw crowds of those hold peasants flmg themselves on the ground, to creep in between the feet of the legionaries, and die stabbing them, others casting away the lance to seize the Roman bucklers, and encumber them with the strong grasp of death crowds mounted the rising grounds, and leaped down on the spears The enemy, overborne with the weight of the multitude, at length found it impossible to move further yet their solid strength was not to be broken Wherever we turned, there was the
sime wall of shields, the same thick fence ol levelled lances We might as well have as¬ saulted u rock Our arrows rebounded from their impenetrable armour, the stones that poured on them from innumerable slings, rolled off hke the hail of a summer shower from a roof But, to have stopped the columns, and pievented their junction, was itself a triumph T felt tint thus we had scarcely to do more, than fix them where they stood, and leave the intense heat of the day thirst, and weariness, to fight our battle But my troops were not to l>e restrained 1 hey still rolled in furious heaps against the living fortification Every broken lance in that impenetrable barrier, every pierced helmet was α trophy the fall of a single legion ary roused a shout of exultation, and was the signal for a new charge But the battle was no longer to be left to our unassisted efforts The tToops in Jemsalem moved down, with Constantius at their head In the perpetual roar of the conflict, their shouts escaped my ear and my first intelli
gence of their advance was from Jubal, who had well redeemed his pledge during the day Hurrying with him to ono of the eminences that overlooked the field, I saw with pride and delight the standard of Naphtah speadtng its red folds at the head of the advancing multi¬ tude " Who commands thein ? " asked Jubal eagerly *' Who should command them, with that banner at then head,' replied I, " but my son, my brave Coustantius ? ' He heard no more , but, bending his turban to the saddle bow, struck the spur into his horse aad, with a cry of madness, plunged mto the centre of the nearest column The stroke came upon it like a thunderbolt, the phalanx w α vered for the first time, a space was broken in its ranks The ch ism was filled up by a charge of my hunters Ίο save or die with Jubal, was the impulse ' That charge was nover recovered, the column loosened, the multitude pressed in upon it, and Constantius arrived only ш time to sec the lemnant ot the
proud Roman army flying to the disastrous shelter of the ravine The day was won — I was a conqueror ' The invincible legions were invincible no more I had conquered under the gaze of Jerusalem ! Where was the enmity that would dare to mm mur against me now ' What calumny would not be crushed by the force of national grati tude ' A flood of absorbing sensations filled iny soul No eloquence of man could express the glowing and s iperb consciousness that swelled my heirt in the moment when I saw the Romans sh ike and heard the shouts of my army proclaiming me victor ' After that diy I с in forgive the boldest extravagance of the boldest pass эп foi wai That passion is not cruelty nor the thirst of possession nor the longing foi suprem icy but something made up of them ill and yet superior to all—the essenti il spnit of the stu nng motives of the hum m mind—the fever of the gamester kindled by the loftiest objects and ennobled by thein------a game wheie the stake is an endless inheritance of renown а
sudden lifting of the man into the rank of those on whose names time can make no impression T who, let their place on earth be what it may, are at the head of mankind. Immortals, with¬ out undergoing the penalty of the grave '
CHAPTER XIII I oniRMiNFiJ to give the enemy nore spite and ordeied the ravines to be attacked by fresh troops While they were advancing I galloped in search of J ubai over the ground of the last charge Ho was not to be seen among the living or the dead The look of the field when the first glow of battle passed was enough to shake a sterner spirit than mine Our advance to the gorges of the mountain had left the pi un naked The sea of turbans and lances was gone rolling like the swell of an augiy ocean against the foot of the hills All before us was the preci pitous rock or the rocky pass, thronged with
helmets and spears But all behind was death or misery worse than death hundreds and thousands groaning m agony crying out for water to cool their burning lips imploring tho sword to put them out of ptun The legion ants 1 y in their ranks as they h id fought olid ¡ îles of inen horses and arms the true monuments oi soldieiship The vetetans of Rome h il gallantly sust uned the honours of her name I turned from this sight towards tho rescued city The sun wus resting on its towers tlu smokes of the evening sacrifice were ascending in slow wreaths from the altar of the sanctu ary The trumpets and voices of the minstrels poured a rich stream of harmony on the cool air The recollection of gentler times came upon my heart Through what scenes of an xtous feehng had I not passed since those gates closed upon me ' The coi trast between the holy calm of my early days and the fierce struggles of my doomed existence pressed with bitter force My spirit shook The warrior enthusiasm was
chilled The sounds of triumph rang hollow in my eur, and those who had at that hour looked upon the man of victory the champion of Israel, would have seen but a helpless wretch, hiding his face fiom human view , and wishing that he could exchange fates with the mangled shapes beside lum The tiamphng of horses roused me from this un warlike weakness Constantius came glowing to communicate tho intelligence, that the last of the enemy had been driven in and that his fresh troops only awaited my orders to force the pusses I mounted, heard the shouts of the bi ivt pursuers, and was again the soldier But the iron front of the enemy resisted oui boldest attempts to force tho ravines The lulls were not to be turned , and we were compelled, after lnuumeinblc efforts, to wait for the move meut of the Rom ins fiom ι spot which thirst and hunger must soon make untenable This day stripped them of their biggage, beasts of burden, and military eng Night fell too speedily—to us а reluctant relaxation, to them a temporary shelter from inevitable luin
At dawn, the pursuit began again We found the passes open, and the enemy strug ghng to escape out of those fatal defiles The day was worn away in perpetual attempts to break the ranks of the legionaries The Jew, light, agile, and with nothing to carry but his spear, was α tremendous antagonist to the Ro¬ man, perplexed among rocks and torrents, fa¬ mishing, and encumbered with an oppressive weight of armour The losses of this day were dreadful Our darts commanded their march from the heights, every stone did execution among ranks, whose helmets and shields were now shattered by the perpetual discharge Still they toiled on unbroken We saw their long line struggling with patient discipline through the rugged depth below , and in the face of oui attacks they made way, till night again covered them I spent that night on horseback Fatigue was never felt in the strong excitement of the time I saw multitudes sink at my horse's feet in sleep as insensible as the rock on which they lay. Sleep never touched my eyelids I gal-
loped from post to post, brought up reinforce ments to my weaned ranks, and longed for It came at last, the enemy had reached the head of the defiles, hut a force was poured upon them that nothing could resist, their remaining cavalry were driven from the sides of the pre¬ cipice into the depths, the few light troops that scaled the higher grounds were swept away I looked upon their whole army as in my hands, and was riding forward with Constantius and mv chief officers to receive their surrender when they were saved by one of those instances of devotedness, that distinguished the Roman character Wearied of perpetual pursuit and evasion, I was rejoiced to see, at last, symptoms of a deteimination to wait for us, and try the chance of battle An abrupt ridge of rock surmounted with a lofty cone was the enemy s position, long after famous in Jewish annals A line of spearsmen were drawn up on the ridge, and the broken eummit of the cone, a space of a few hundred yards, was occupied by a cohort.
Some of the Italian dextenty was employed to give the idea, that Cestius had taken his stand upon this central spot, an eagle, and a con course of officers were exhibited, and upon this spot I directed the principal attack to be made But the cool bravery of its defenders was not to be shaken After a long waste of time in efforts to scale the rock, indignant at seeing victory retarded by such an obstacle, I left the business to the elingers and archers, and ordered a perpetual discharge to be kept up on the cohort This was decisive Every stone and arrow told upon the little force crowded together on the naked height Shield and helmet sank one by one under the mere weight ot missiles Their circle rapidly diminished, dnd, refusing surrender, they perished to a man When we took possession, the enemy were gone The resistance of the cohort had given them time to escape And Cestius sheltered his degraded laurels behind the ramparts of Bethhoron, by the sacrifice of four hundred heroes
This battle, which commenced on the eighth day of the month Marchesvan, had no equal in the war The loss to the Romans was unparal¬ leled since the defeat of Crassus Two legions were destroyed, six thousand bodies were left on the field The whole preparation for the siege of Jerusalem fell into our hands Then was the hour to have struck the final blow for freedom Ihen was given that chance of restoration, that respite, which Providence gives to every nation and every man But our crimes, our wild feuds, the bigoted fuiy, and polluted license of our factions, rose up as a cloud be tween us and the light, we were made to be ruined But those were not my reflections when I saw the gates of Bethhoion closing on the fugi tives I vowed never to rest, until I brought prisoners to Jeiusalem, the last of the sacri legious army that had dared to assault the Temple The walls of Bethhoron, manned only with the wreck of the troops that we had routed from all their positions, could offer no impedi-
ment to hands and hearts like ours I ordered an immediate assault lhe resistance was deb pente for beyond this city there was no pluct of refuge nearer than Antipatm We were twice repulsed I headed the third attack my self The dead filled up the ditch and I had already arrived at the foot of the rampart with the scaling ladder in my hand, when I heard Jubal s voice behind me He was leaping and dancing m the attitudes of utter madness But there was no time to be lost I rushed upon the battlements tore a standard from its bearer and waved it over my head with a shout ot victory The plain the hills, the valleys, co vered with the host rushing to the assault echoed the cry I was at the summit of for tune' In the next moment I felt a sudden shock Darkness covered my eyes and I plunged headlong I awoke in a dungeon
In that dungeon I hy two years How I lived how I bore to retain existence I can now h iveno conception I was foi the greater part of the time in a kind of childishness I w is not mad, nor altogether insensible of things hout me, nor even without the occasional inclination for tho co nmon objects and propen sities of our being I used to look for the glimmer of day light, that was suffered to enter mv cell The reflection of the moon in a pool, oi which by climbing to the loop hole I could gama glimpse, was waited for with some feeble
feeling of pleasure But my animal appetites were more ful'y alive than ever An hour*. delay of the miserable provision th t w is throw n through my bars made me wretched I de voured it like ι w 'd beast and then longe 1 through the dreary hours for its coining agun I made no attempt to escape I dragged myself once to the entrance of the dungeon found it secured by an iron door and ne^ei tried it again If every bar h id been opei ï scircely know whethei I should hne U tempted to p iss it Even in my more re ι somng hours I felt no desire to move Destiny was upon me My doom was marked in ch ι racters which nothing but blindness could ful to read and to struggle with fate what was it but to prepare for new misfortune ' The memory of my wife and children some times broke through the icy apathy with which I labouied to mcrust my mind Tears flowed nature stung my heart I groaned and made the vault ring with the cries of the exile from earth and heaven But this passed away and
I was again the self divorced man, without a tie to bind him to tiansitory things I heard the thundei and the winds the lightnings sometimes startled me from my sivage sleep But what were they to mc ' I was dreadfully secure from the fiercest rige of nature There were nights when I conceived that I could distinguish the roarings of the cean ind shuddeung, seemed to hear the cries of drowning men But those too passed iway I swept remembrance from my mmd and felt a soit of vague enjoyment in the eflort to dely the 1 ist power of evil Cold he it hunger waking sleep weie the calendar of my year the only points in which I was sen sible of existence I felt myself like some ol those torpid animals whit h buried in stones from the creation live on until the creation shall be no more But this stern be iviness w ıs only for the waking hour Night had its old implacable dominion over me full of vivid misery ciowded with the bitter sweet of memory 1
wandered free among thobe, in whose faces and forms my spirit found matchless loveliness, then the cruet caprice of fancy would sting me, m the very concord of enchanting sounds there would come a funereal voice In the circle of the happy, I was appalled by some hideous visage uttering words of mystery A spectral form would hang upon my steps, and tell me that I was undone From one of those miserable slumbers I was roused by a voice pronouncing mv name I at first confounded it with the wanderings of sleep But a chilling touch upon my forehead completely aroused me It was night, yet my eyes, accustomed to the darkness, gradually dis¬ covered the first intruder who ever stood withm my living grave, nothing human could look more like the dead A breathing skeleton stood before me The skin clung to his bones, misery was in every featuie, the voice was scarcely above a whisper " Rise, said this wretched being, " prince of Naphtah, you are free, follow me
Strange thoughts were in the words. Was this indeed the universal summoner ? thf being whom the prospeious dread, but the wietched love 7 Had the King ofterrors stood befoie me, I could not have gazed on him with moie wonder. "Rise,' said the voice impa¬ tiently, " we have butan hour till day-break, and you must escipe »ow, or never" The sound of freedom scattered my apathy The world opened upon my heart, country, friends, children, were ш the word, and I started up with the feeling of one, to whom life is given ou the scaflold My guide hurried forward through the winding way to the dooi He stopped, I heard hmi utter a groan, stnke fieicely against the bais, and fall I found him lying at the threshold without speech or motion л carried him back, and, by the help ot the cruse of water leit to moisten my ¡solitary meal, restored lum to his souses " lhe wind," said he, " must have closed the door, and we are destined to die together.

long —Farewell '" He flung himself upon his face in a corner and seemed to sleep. A noise of some heavy instrument roused us both. He listened, and said, " There is hope still The slave who let me in, ib forcing the door " We rushed to assist him, and tugged and tore at the massive stones ш which the hinges were fixed, but found our utmost strength ineffectual as an infant's. The slave now cned out, that he must give up the attempt, that day was break ing, and tho guard were at hand. We im¬ plored him to try once more By а vio¬ lent effort, he drove his crow-bar through one of tho pannels, the gleam of light gave us courage, and with our united strength we heaved at the joints, which were evidently loosening. In tbe midst of our work, the slave fled, and I heard a plunge into the pool beneath. " He has perished,' said my companion. "The door is on the face of a precipice. He has fallen m the attempt to escape, and we are now finally undone " The guard, disturbed by the noise, arrived,
Sand m the depths of our cell we heard the day spent in makmg the impassable barrier firmer than ever. For some hours my companion lay in that state of exhaustion, which I could not dıştın guish from uneasy slumber, and which I attri buted to the fatigue of our mutual labours. But his groans became so deep, that I ventured to rouse hun, aud even to cheer hun with the chances of escape "I have not slept," said he, "I shall never sleep again, until the grave gives me that slum¬ ber in which the wretched can alone find rest Escape ' No—for months, for years, I have had but one object, I have traversed mountain and sea for it, I have given to it day and night, all the wealth that I possessed in tbe world, I could give no more, but my life, and that too I was to give I stood withm sight of this object Its attainment would have comforted my dying hour.

was done in madness too. On my crimes, may Heaven have mercy ' for they are beyond the forgiveness of man " By the feeble hght, which showed scarcely more than the wretchedness of my dungeon, I made some little preparation for the refresh¬ ment of this feverish and famished being. His story agitated him, and, strongly awakened as my curiosity was, I forbore all question. But it lay a burden on his mmd, and I suffered turn to make his confession. " I loved Salome," said he " But I was so secure of acceptance, according to the custom of our tithe, that I never conceived tho possi¬ bility of an obstacle to our marriage My love and my pride were equally hurt by her rejec¬ tion The return of Salome from Rome, and the new distinctions of her husband, your grati¬ tude, and the popular applause, made my envy bitterness To change tho scene, I went to Je¬ rusalem I there found the spi ι it of malice active. Your learning and talents had made you obnoxious long before, youı new opulence and rank turned dislike into hatred. Omas,
whose dagger you turned from fhe bosom of the noble Eleazar, remembered his disgrace He headed the conspiracy against you, and no thing but your heroism, and the danng vigour with which you stirred up the nation, could have saved you long since from the last extre mities of faction and revenge My unhappy state of mind threw me into his hands I was inflamed against you by perpetual calum nies My feelings, morbid with fancied wrongs, huiried me into violences of language and wild resolutions, that now strike me with wonder It was even proposed, that I should accuse you before the Sanhednm, of dealing with the powers of darkness Proofs were oflered, which my bewildered and broken reason could scarcely resist 1 was assailed with subtle argument, the latent superstitions of my nature weie sti¬ mulated by sights and scenes of strange import, horrid and mysterious displays, which implicate the leaders ot Jerusalem deeply in the charges laid by our law upon the idolaters Spiuts, or the semblances of spirits, were raised before my eyes, voices were heard in tbe depths and in
the air, denouncing you, even you as the ene m ν of Judea and of man I was commanded, ш the midst of thunders, real or feigned, to de stroy you " Here his voice sank, bis frame quivered, and wrapping his head in his cloak, he remained long silent To relieve him from this painful narrative, I asked for intelligence of my family and of the country " Of your family I can tell you nothing, said he, mournfully, " I shrank from the very men tion of their name During these two years, 1 had but one pursuit, the discovery of your pn son I refused to hear, to think of other things I felt that I was dying, and I dreaded to appear before the great tribunal with the groans from your dungeon rising up to stifle my prayers ' " But is our country still torn by the Ro man wolves ? ' " Its destruction forced itself on my eyes The whole land is ш tumult Blood and horror are under every roof fiom Lebanon to Idumea The Roman sword is out, and it falls with cruel havock, but the Jewish dagger pays it horat ,
and the legions quail before the naked valour of the peasantry. But what are valour or pa¬ triotism to us now ? we are in our grivt '" The thought of my family expost d to the mi¬ series of a ft. rociou·» war, only kindle d înv cagtr- ness to estape from this den of oblivion I rose, it was evemng, and the melaut huly moon threw the old feeble gleam on the wator, which had so long been to me tho only mirror of her countenance I observed the light darkened by a figure stealing along the edge of ihe pool It approached, and the words were whispered " It is impossible to break open the door from without, as the guard are on the watch, but try whether it cannot be openel from within " A crow-bar was pushed into the loop hole , its bearer, the slave, who had escaped by swim¬ ming, jumped down and was gone I left Jubal where ho lay, lingered at the door till all external sounds ceased, und then made my desperate attempt I was wasted by confinement, but the mmd is force I laboured with furious effort at the mass of bolt and bar, and at length felt it begin to give way. I saw
ι star the first for two long years twinkling through the fracture A quarter of an hours labour more unfixed the huge hinge and I felt the night air cool and fragrant on my cheek I now grasped tho list bur and w ıs in the iet of forcing it from the vv ill when the thought of Jubil struck me lhere wis ι struggle of ι moment in my mmd To linger now, might be to give the guard time to intercept me I was ravening for lıbeıty It was to me now what water ш the desert is to the dying caravan It was the sol assuaging of ι fr mtie thirst of a fiery and consuming fever of the soul If every gram of dust undei my feet were dn monds I would have given thein to feel myself treading the dewy grass tha* lay waving on the hilt side before me A tall shadow pissed tlong and compelled me to pause It was th it of a mount tin shep herd spear m hand guarding his Hock fiom the depredations of the wolves He stopped at a short distance from the dungeon and gating on the moon, broke out with ι rude but not un sweet voice into song 1 he melody was wild, a
lamentation over the fallen glories of Judea , " whose sun was set, and whose remaining light, sad and holy as the beauty of the moon, must soon decay " The word freedom mingled in the strain, and every note of that solemn strain vibrated to my heart The shepherd passed along, I tore down the bar, and gazed upon the glorious face of heaven My feet were upon the free ground I returned hastily to the cell, and told Jubal the glad tidings, but he heard me not To abandon him there was to give him up to inevitable death, either by the rage of the guard, or by the less merciful infliction of famine I carried him on iny shoulders to the entrance A roar of wrath, mixed with ridicule, broke on me, аь I touched the threshold The guard stood drawn up in front of the dilapidated door, and the sight of the prisoner entrapped m the very crisis of escape, was the true food for ruihun mirth Staggering under my burden, I yet burst forward, but I was received in a circle of levelled spears Resistance was desperate, yet,
even when sunk upon the ground under my burden, I attempted to resist, or gather their points in my bosom and perish But my feeble efforts only raised new scoffing I was un¬ worthy of Roman steel, and the guard, after amusing themselves with my impotent rage, dragged me within the passage, placed Jubal, who neither spoke nor moved, beside me, blocked up the door, and wished me " better success the next time." I spent the remainder of that night in fierce agitation. The apathy, the protecting scorn ot external things that I had nurtured, as othei men would nurture happiness, was gone The glimpse of the sky haunted me , α hundred times in the course of the night I thought that I was treading on the grass, that I felt its re¬ freshing moistuie, that the air was breathing balm on my cheek, that tho shepherd s song was still echoing ш my eirs, and that I saw lum pointing to a new way of escape from my inextricable dungeon In one of my ramblings I fell ovei Jubal Exasperated at the stern reality round me, I flung the crow bar from my
band. A sound followed, like the fall of large stones into water The sound continued. Still stranger echoes followed, which my bewildered fancy turned into all similitude« of earth and ocean , the march of troops, the distant ro ir of thunder, the d islnng of billows, the cl nnour of battle, the boisterous mirth of В iceh malı ins, the groaning and heaving of masts md ii n gmg tossed by storm The dungeon was dark as death, and I felt my way towards the sound To my surpnse, the accidental blow of the bar had loosened а part of the wall, and made an orifice large tnough to admit the human body. The pale light of morning showed a cavein beyond, n mow and rugged, but into which I was resolved to pe¬ netrate. It hr méhed into а vaııetv of pas bages, some of them fit for nothing but the fox s burrow Two were wider I it turned to the luir of my unhappy companion, and pi evadid on him to follow, only hy the declaration, that if he refused, I must perish by his side My scanty provisions weie gatheied up I led the way, and, determined never to return fo the
place of my misery, we set forward, to tempt in utter darkness the last chances of famine— pilgrims of the tomb We wandered through a fearful labynnth for a period which utterly exhausted us Of night or day we bad no knowledge, but hunger keenly told us that it was long I was sinking when л low groan struck my en I liste ned paiitingly it camt igain It was evidently from some object close beside me I put forth my hand, and pulled away а projecting stone а flash of light illumined the pas igt Another step would have plunged us into а pool а thou sand feet btlow
CHAPTER XV The cavern thus opened to us was large, and seemed to be the magazine of some place of trade It was crowded with chests and bales heaped together in disorder. But life and liberty were before us I cheered Jubal, till his scattered senses returned, and he clasped my feet in humiliation and gratitude We were like men created anew Sudden strength nerved our limbs we forced our way through piles, that but an hour beforo would have been mountains to our despairing strength After long labour we worked our passage to а door It opened into another cavern, palpably the dwelling of some master of extraordinary
opulence Rich tissues were hung on the walls, the t tiling was a Tynan canopy, precious vases stood on tables of citron and ivory. A large lyre superbly ornamented hung in an opening of the rock, and gave its melancholy music to the wind But no human being was to be seen Was this one of the true wonders that men classed among tbe fictions of Greece and Asta ? The Nereids with their queen could not have sought a more secluded palace Still onward were heard the sounds oi ocean. We followed them, and saw one of those scenes of grandeur which nature creates, as if to show the littleness of man An arch three times the height of the lof tiest temple, and ribbed with marble, rose broadly over our heads Innumerable shafts of the purest alabaster, rounded with tbe per¬ fection of sculpture, rose in groups and clusters to the solemn roof wild flowers and climbing plants of every scent and hue gathered round the capitals, and hung the gigantic sides of the hall with a lovelier decoration than ever was wrought in loom The awful beauty of this
ocean-temple bowed the heart in instinctive homage I felt the sacredness of nature But this grandeur was alone worthy ot the spectacle to which it opened. The whole mag uificence of the Mediterranean spicud befoie our eves, smooth as polished silver, and now leflecting the glones of the west The sun lay on the horizon in the midst ol crimson clouds, like a monarch on the funeral pile, sink¬ ing in conflagration that lighted earth and ocean But at this noble portal we had reached our limit The sides of the cavern projected so far into the waters as to make a sma 11 anchorage. Access or escape by land was palpably impos¬ sible Yet heie at least wo were mastcis No claimant presented himself to dispute our title The provisions of our unknown host wert ample, and, to our eager tastes, dangerous fiom their luxury The evening that we passed ov er our repast a f the entrance of the cave, exhila¬ rated with the first sensation of liberty and enjoying every aspect and voice oi the lovely sceno with the keenness of the most unhoped-
for novpîty, was a full recompense for the toils and terrors of the labyrinth. Wl before us was peace —The surge that died at our feet murmured peace, the wheeling seu birds, as their long trams steered homeward, pouring out from time to time u elan^oi ot wild sounds that descended to us in harmony, tht httle white-sailed vessels, that skimmed along the distant waters like flies , the biee¿e waving the ivy and arbutus that festooned oui banquet- hall , alike spoke to the heart the language oí peace " If, ' said I, " my death-bed were left to my own choice, on the veige of this c ivern would I wish to take my last farewell " " To the dying all places must be nidifièrent, replied my companion " when Death is at hand, his shadow fills the mind. Wh it mat tei s it to the exile, who in а íew moments must leave his country for ever, on what spot of its shore his last step is planted ' Pei Imps the love liei that spot, the moie painful the parting If I must ΐΜλβ my choice, let me die in the dungeon, or in battle, in Mie chain that makes
me h ito the earth, or in the struggle that makes it be forgotten ' " Yet, even for battle, if wo would acquit ourselves as becomes men, is not some pievious rest almost essenti il' and for the sterner con¬ flict with that mighty enemy, before whom our strength is vapour, is it not well to prepare with the whole means of mental fortitude ' I would not perish in the irritation of the dungeon, in the blind fury of man against man, nor in the hot and giddy whirl of human cares. Let me lay my sinking frame where nothing shall intrude upon the nobler business of the mind. But these are melancholy thoughts Come, Jubal, fall to the speedy deliverance of our country " " Here, then, to her speedy deliverance, nud the glory of those who fight her battles ' ' The cup was filled to the brim, but just as the wine touched his lips, he flung it away. " No, ' ex- clauned he, in bitterness ot soul, " it is not for such as I to join m the aspirations of the patriot and the soldier Prince of Naphtah, your ge nerous nature has forgiven me, but there is an accuser here, ' and he struck his withered hand
wildly upon his bosom, " that can never be silenced Under the delusions, the infernal de¬ lusions of your enemies, I followed you through a long period of your career unseen Every act, almost every thought, was made known to me, for you were surrounded by the agents of your enemies I was urged hy the belief that vou were utterly accursed by our law, and that to dnve the dagger to your heart was to redeem our cause But the act was against my nature, and in the struggle my reason failed. When I stood before you on the morning of the great battle, you saw me in one of those fits of frenzy that always followed a new command to murder The misery of seeing Salome's husband once more tnumphant finally plunged me into the Roman ranks to seek for death I escaped, followed the aimy, and reached Bethoron tn the midst of the assault. Still frantic, I thought that in you I saw my rival victorious, and sprang upon the wall It was this hand, this parricidal hand, that struck the blow— " He covered his face, and sighed convulsively The mystery of iny captivity was now cleared
up, and feeling only pity and forgiveness for the ruin that rémoise hid made I succeeded it last m restoring lum to some degree of ( ilmness I even ventured to cheer hmi with the hope ot better days, when in the palace of my fathers I should acknowledge my delivcicr With a pressure of the hand, and a mel neholy smile, "I know," said he, "that I luve not long to live But if any prayer ol mine is to be answered by tbe Power that I have so deeply offended, it would be to die in some act of ser¬ vice to my pnnce and generous benefactor But hark ' ' A groan was uttered close to the spot where we sat I perceived for the first time an opening behind some furniture, entered, aud saw lying on a bed a man apparently in the last stage of exhaustion He exclaimed, "Thiee days of misery,—thiee days lett alone, to dit ,—without food, without help, abandoned by all But I have deserved it Tiuitor and villain as I am, I have deserved a thousand deaths ' I looked upon this as but the raving of pain, and brought hint some wine He swallowed it

effort of nature, and with furious execrations at the tardiness of death, he tore off the bandage which covered a wound on his forehead The blood streamed down, and made him a ghastly spectacle " Aye, ' cned he, as he looked upon his stained hands, " this is the true colour, the traitor s blood should cover the traitor s hands Years of crime, this is your reward The be trayal ° my noble moster to death, the ruin of his house, the destruction of his name, these weie the right beginning to the life of the rob ber." A peal of thunder rolled over our heads, and the gush of the rising wuves roared through the cavern "Aye, there is your army,' he cried, "coming in the storm. I have seen your angry visages at night in the burning village, I have seen you m the shipwreck, I have seen you in the howl¬ ing wilderness, but now I see you in shapes more terrible than all " The wind bursting through the long vaults, forced open the door. " Welcome, welcome to your prey," he yelled, and drawing a knife from
his sash, dai ted it into his bosom. The act was so instantaneous, that to arrest the blow was impossible He fell, and died with a brief, fierce struggle " Horrible end," murmured Jubal, gazmg on the stiffened form,—"here is theory an¬ swered at once, happier for that wretch to have perished in the hottest strife of man or nature, tiampled in the charge, or plunged into the billows ' But, save me from the misery of lonely death ' ' " Yet it was our presence that made him feel He was guilty of some crime, perhaps of many, that the sight of us strangely awoke to torment his dying hour He gazed upon me with evident alarm, and, not improbably, my withered face, and those rags of my dungeon, startled him into recollections too strong for his decaying reason " " Have you ever seen him before ? " " Never ' I gave a reluctant look to the hideous distortion of a countenance still full of the final agony " Now, to think of ourselves We shall
have soon our own experiment fairly tried A few diys must exluust our provisions The singes roll on the one hind on the other wc h ive the lock But we sh ill die it least in pomp ISo king of Asu will he in a nobler vault nor even have sinctrer rejoicings at his end the ciows md vultures are no hypocrites, sud Jubal with a melancholy smile The de id mans tmbin had fallen ofl in his last violence md I peiceived the corner of α letter in its folds Its intelligence startled me It was from the commandant of the Roman fleet on the co ist mentioning th it a squadron w as in leadiness to ittack the pn ates in their cavern A he ivy sound as if something of immense weight h ul rushed mto the entr mee of the arch and then the echo of many voices stopped our convers ition The Romans have come, said 1 and you will be now indulged with your wish our lives are forfeited , for never will I go back to the dungeon " I hear no sound but that of laughter, said Jubal, listening, " those invaders are the mer
nest of cut throats But, before we give our selves actually into their hands, let us see of what they are made ' We left the chamber, and returned to the recess from which we had originally emerged Its position commanded a view of the chief avenues and chambers of the cavern, and while I was busy below m securing the door, Jubal mounted the wall, and reconnoitred the enemy throuc,u a fissure " Those are no Romans ' whispered he, " but a set of the most jovial fellows that e er robbed on the seas They have clearly been driven in by the storm, and are now preparing to feast Their voyage has been lucky, if I am to judge by the bales that they are hauling in, and it vine can do it, they will be in an hour or two drunk to the last man " Then we can take advantage of their sleep let loose one of their boats, and awaj ' I mounted, to see this pirate festivity In thevanous vistas of the huge cavern, groups of bold faced and athletic men were gathered, all busy with the bustle of the tune some piling __ VOL II
fires against the walls, and preparing provisions some stripping oft their wet garments, and bring¬ ing others out of heaps of every kind and co lour, from recesses in the rock some furbish ing their arms, and wiping the spray from rusty helmets and corselets The hollow vaults rang with songs, boisterous laughter, the rattling of armour, and the creaking and rolling of chests of plunder The dashing of the sea under the gale filled up this animated dissonance, and at intervals the thunder bursting directly above our heads, overpowered ail, and silenced all
CHAPTER XVI. ΓιΐΕ chamber, whose costly equipment first told us of the opulence of its masters, was set apart for the chief rovers, who were soon seated at a large table m its centre, covered with luxury Flagons of wine were brought from cell irs known only to the initiated , fruits piled in silver baskets blushed along the board, plate of the richest workmanship, the plunder of palaces and temples, glittered in every form, tripods loaded with aromatic wood threw α blaze up to the marble roof, and from the cen tral arch hung a superb Greek lamp, shooting out light from a bu udred mouths of serpents twined m all possible ways. The party before
me were about thirty, as fierce looking figures as ever toiled through tempest some splendidly attired, some m the rough costume of the deck, but all jovial, and determined to make the most of their tune Other men had paid for the banquet, and there was probably not a vase on their table that was not the purchase of personal hazard. They sat, conquerors, m the midst of their own trophies, and not the most self indulgent son of opulence could have more luxuriated in his wealth, nor the most exqui¬ site student of epicurism have discussed his luxuries with more finished and fastidious science Lounging on couches covered with embroidered draperies, too costly for all but princes, they lectured the cooks without mercy the venison, pheasants, sturgeon, and α multitude of other dishes, were in succession pronounced utterly unfit to be touched, and the wine was tasted, and dismissed with the scorn of palates refined folhe highest point of delicacy л \e sea air was not to be trifled with and a succession of courses appeared, and were despatched with a diligence that prohi-
bited all language, beyond the pithy phrases of delight or disappointment. The wine at length set the conversation flow¬ ing, and, from the merits of the various vintages, the speakers diverged into the general subjects of politics and their profession, on tbe former of which they visited all parties with tolerably equal ridicule, and, on the lattei, declared unanimously, that the only cause worthy of a man of sense was the cause for which they were assembled round that table. The next stage was the more hazardous one oi personal jocularity, yet even this was got over, with but a few murmurs from the parlies suffering Songs and toasts to themselves, then loves, matron and maid, withm the shores of the Mediterranean, and their enterprises in all time to come, relieved the drier topics, and all was good fellowship, until one unlucky goblet of spoiled wme soured the table. " So, this you call Chmn," exclaimed a broad built figure, whose yellow hair and blue eyes showed htm a son of the north, " may I be poisoned,' a id he made a hideous grimace, "if
more detestable vinegar ever was brewed let me but meet the merchant, and I shall t с tu h him a lesson, that he will remember when next he thinks of murdering men at their ne als Here, baboon, take it, it is fit only for such us you Ho flung tht goblet point blank at the head of a negro who escaped it only by bound ing to one side with the agility of the ape, that he much resembled " Bad news Vladomn, for our winters stock, for half of it n> Chum, said a d ırk featured and brilliant eyed Arab, who sat at the head of the table " Ho ' Syphax, fill round from that flagon, and let us hold a council of war upon the delinquent v\ ine The slave dexterously changed the wine, it was poured round, pronounced first rate, and the German was laughed at remorselessly " I suppose I am not to believe my own senses, remonstrated Vladomir * Oh ' by all means, as long as you keep them," said one, laughing " Will you tell me, that I dont know the difference between wine and that poison. '
Neither you nor ony man, friend Vlado mır, cun know much upon the subject uftei his second dozen of goblets," sneered another it the German s nation il propensity " You do him injustice,' said a subtle- v isaged Chiote ut the opposite side of tho table " He is as much in his senses this moment as ever he was There ure mains of that happy constitu¬ tion, which defies alike reason and wine " Well, I shall say no more," murmured the German sullenly, " than, confound the spot on which that wine grew, wherever it lies, the hungriest vineyard on the Rhine would be ishamed to show its equal. By Woden, the vt ry taste will go with me to my grave ' ' Perhaps it may," said the Chiote, irritated for tbe honour of his country, and significantly touching his dagger. " But were you ever m the island ? ' " No, nor ever shall, with my own consent, if that flagon be from it, growled the German, with his broad eye glaring on his adversary " I have seen enough of its produce, alive and dead to-night "
The wind roared without, and a tremendous thunder peal checked the angry dialogue There was a general pause " Come, comrades, no quarreling, cried the Arab " Heavens, how the storm comes on ' Nothing can ride out to night Here s the captain s health, and safe home to him ' The tups were filled, but the disputants were not to be so easily reconciled " Ho ' Memnon, cried the naster of the table to а sallow Egyptian richly clothed, and whose scimitar and dagger sparkled with jewels. He was engaged in close council with the rover nt his side " Lay by business now, you don t like the wine, or the toast 7 ' The Egvptmn startled from his conference, professed his perfect admiration of both, and bippmg, returned to his whisper " Memnon won t drink, for fear of letting out his secrets, for instance, where he found that scimitar, or what has become ot t'ie owner,' said a young and handsome Idumean, with a smile " I should like to know fcy wuat authority
you ask me questions on the subject If it had been in your hands, I should have never though·. any necessary," retorted the scowling Egyptian " Aye, of course not, Memnon my way is well known —right rather than steal, plunder rather than cheat, and, after the affair is over, account to captain and crew, rather than glitter in their property," was the Idumean' s answer, with α glow of indignation reddening Ins striking features " By the bye," said the Arab, in whose eye the gems flashed temptingly " I think that Memnon is always under a lucky star We come home in rags, but he regularly returns the better for his trip why, Ptolemy himself has not a more exquisite tailor. AH depends, however, upon a man's knowledge of navigation in this world ' " And friend Memnon knows every point of it, but plain sailing," said the contemptuous Idumean. The Egyptian's sallow skin grew livid. " I may be coward or liar, or pilferer, or what yon will," exclaimed he, " but, if I were the whole
three, I could stand no chance of being dis¬ tinguished in the present company " " Insult to the whole profession,' exclaimed the Arab " And now I insist, m the general name, on your giving a plain account of the pioceeds of your last cruise You can be at no loss for it " " No, for he has it by his side, and in the most brilliant arithmetic, said Hanno, a satin cal visagetl son of Carthage " I must hear no moie on the subject, bitteily pronounced the Egyptian " Tbose dian onds belong to neither captain nor crew I purchased them fairly, and the seller was, I will undertake ίο say, the better off of the two " Yes, I will undertake to say, laughed the Idumean, " that you left lnm the happiest dog in existence It is care that makes us all miserable * and the less we have to care for, the luckier we are I have not a doubt you left the fellow at the summit of earthly rapture ' " Aye '" added the Arab, " without a sorrow or a shekel in the world."
Boisterous mirth followed the Egyptian, as he started from his couch and left the hall, casting fierce looks in his retreit, like Parthian arrows, on the carousal The German had in the mean time, f illen back in a doze, from which he was disturbed by the slaves refilling his goblet " Aye, that tastes hke wine said he glancing at the Greek, who had by no means forgotten the controversy " Taste what it may it is the very same wine that you railed at half an hour ago,* returned the Chiote the truth is, my good Vladomir, that the wine of Greece is like its language, both are exquisite and unrivalled, to tbose who understand them But Nature wisely adapts tastes to men, and men to tastes I am not at all surprised, that north of the Danube they prefer beer The German had nothing to give back for the taunt, hut the frown that gathered on his black brow The Chiote pursued his triumph, and with α languid, lover like gaze on the wine, which
sparkled in purple radiance to tho brim of its enamelled cup, he apostropluz d the produce of his fine couiitiy " Delicious grape—essence of the sun shine and of the dew—what v ales but the vales of Chios ι ould have produced thee' What fint of heaven is brighter than thy hue , what frigrance of earth, richer than thy per fume ' He lightly sipped a few drops from the edge, like a libation to the deity of taste. ' Exquisite draught,' breathed he, "un¬ equalled but by the rosy hp and melting sigh of beauty Well spoke the proverb—* Chios, whose wines steal every head, and whose women, every Heart' ' You forget the rest,' gladly interrupted the Gei man —"And whose men steal every thing ' A general laugh followed the retort, such as it was " Scythian '' said the Greek, across the table, m a voice made low by rage, and preparing to Strike " Liar ' ' roared the German, sweeping a blow of his falchion, which the Chiote es-
caped only by flinging himself on tlie ground *.he blow fell on the table, where it caused wide devastation AU now started up, swords were out on every side, and nothing but forcing tho antagonists to their cells, prevented the last perils of a difference of palate The storm bellowed deeper and deeper " Here's to the luck that sent us back before tins Northwester thought of stirring abroad," said tho Arab " I wish our noble captain were among us now Where was lie last " Steering westward, off and on Rhodes, looking out for the galley that earned the Piocurator s plate But this wind must send lnm ш befort morning,' was the answer of Hanno " Or send him to the bottom, where many as bold a fellow has gone before him," whispered a tall haggard looking Italian to the answerer " That would bo good news, for one of us at least,' said Hanno " You would have no reckoning to settle Your crew made α hand¬ some affair of that Alexandrian priz^ And
the captain might be looking for returns, friend Tertullus ' " Then let him look to himself His time may be nearer than he thinks His haughti¬ ness, and trampling upon men as good as him self, may provoke justice before long," growled tbe Italian, indignant at some late discipline " Justice '—is the man mad ' The very sound is high treason in our gallant company Why, comrade, if justice ever ventured here, where would some of us have been these last six months '" The sound caught the general ear, the allu¬ sion was understood, and fhe Italian was dis pleased " I hate to be remarkable, said he " with the honest, it may be proper to be honest, but beside you, my facetious Hanno, a man should cultivate a little of the opposite school, in mere compliment to his friend You had no scruples, when you hauged the merchant the other day " A murmur rose in the hall. " Comrades," said Hanno, with the air of an orator, " hear me too on that subject three
words will settle the question to men of sense The merchant was a regular trader Will any man who knows the world, and has brains an atom clearei than those with which Heaven m its mercy has gitted my virtuous friend, believe that I, a regular liver by the merchant, would extinguish that by which I hve ? Sensible phy¬ sicians never kill a patient, while he can pay, sensible kings never exterminate a province, wheu it can produce any thing in the shape of α tax sensihle women never pray for the ex¬ tinction of the male sex, until they despair of getting husbands, sensible husbands never wish their wives out of the world, while they can get auy thing by their living so, senwhle men of our profession will nevei put a merchant under water, until they can make nothing by his remaining above it 1 have, for instance, raised contributions on that same trader every summer these five years, and, by the blessing of fortune, hope to have the same thing to say for five times as many years to come No, I would not see any man touch a hair of his head. In six months he will have a cargo again, and I
shall meet hım with as much pleasure as ever The Carthaginian was highly applauded "Malek, yon dont drink,' cried the Arab to а gigantic Ethiopian towards the end of the table " Here, I pledge you m the very wme that was marked for fhe Emperors cellar " Malek tasted it, and sent back a cup in re¬ turn "The Emperor's wme may be good enough for him," was the message —" But this cup contains the wme marked for the Emperors butler " The verdict was fully in favour of the Ethio pian " In all matters of this kind," said Malek, with an air of supreme taste, " I look first to the stores of the regular professors—the science of life is in the masters of the kitchen and the cellar Your Emperors and Procurators, of course, must be content with what they <an get But the man who wishes to have the first rate dinner, should be on good terms with the cook and the butler I caught this sample
on mv last voyage after the imperial fleet Nero never had such wme on his table " He indulged himself in a long draught of tins exclusive luxury, and sank on Ins couch, with his hand clasping the superbly embossed flagon, α part of his prize " The black churl,' said a little shrivelled Syrum, " never shares he keeps his wine, as he keeps his money ' " Aye, he keeps every thing but his charac¬ ter," whispered Hanno " There you wrong him,' observed the Sy- iim, "no man keeps his character more stea¬ dily By Beelzebub ' it is like his skin, neither will he blacker the longest day he has to live " A roar of laughter rose round the hall " Black or not black," exclaimed the Ethio¬ pian, with a sullen grin, that showed his teeth like the fangs of a wild beast, "my blood's as red as yours " " Possibly,' retorted the little Syrian, " but, as I must take your word on the subject till I shall have seen a drop of ft spilt in fair fight, I ouly hope I may live and be happy till then, and
I cannot put up a better prayer for a merry old age." " There is no chance of your ever seeing it, ' growled the Ethiopian, " you love the baggage and the hold too well to leave them to acci¬ dent, be the fight fan or foul " The laugh was easily raised, and it was turned against the Syrian, who started up, and declaimed with α fury of gesture, that made the ridicule still louder. " I appeal to all," cried tbe fiery orator. " I appeal to every man of honour among us, whe¬ ther by night or day, on land or water, I have ev er been backward '" " Never at an escape," interrupted the Ethiopian ' ( Whether I have ever broken faith with the band ? " " Likely enough where nobody trusts, wc may defy treason " " Whether my character and services are not known and valued by our captain ? " still louder exclaimed the irritated Syrian. " Aye, just as little as they deserve."
Silence, brute, screamed the diminutive adversary, casting his keen eyes, that doubly blazed with rage, on the Ethiopian, who still lay embracing the flagon at his ease " With heroes of your complexion I disdain all contest If I must fight, it shall be with human beings, not with savages—with men, not monsters The Ethiopian s black cheek absolutely grew red this taunt was the sting At one prodi gious bound he sprang across the table, and darted upon the Syrians throat with the roar and the fury of a tiger All was instant confusion lamps, fligons, fruits, were trampled on, the table was over thrown , swords and ponnrds flashed m all hands The little Sjnan yelled, stiauglmg in the grasp of the black giant, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he could be rescued The Arab, a fine athletic fellow, achieved this object, and bade lum run for his life а com mand with which he complied unhesitatinglv, followed by а cheer from Hanno, who swore that if all trades failed, he would make his fortune by his heels at the Olympic games."
Our share of the scene was come The fugi tive, naturally bold enough, but startled by the savage ferocity of Ins antagonist, made his way towards our place of refuge The black got loose, and pursued I disdained to be dragged forth as a lurking culprit, and flinging open the door, stood before the crowd. The effect was marvellous The tumult was hushed at once Terror seized upon their boldest Our haggard forms, seen by that half intoxication which bewilders the bram before it enfeebles the senses, were completely fitted to startle the superstition that lurks in the bosom of every son of the sea, and for the moment, they evidently took us for something better or worse than man
CHAPTER XVII Вит the delusion was short lived, my voice broke the spell , and perhaps the conscious¬ ness of their idle alarm increased their rage ' Spies ' was then the outcry, and this dreaded sound brought from their beds and tables the whole band It was in vain that I attempted to speak, the mob have no ears, whether m cities or caves, and we were dragged forward to undergo our examination Yet what was to be done in the midst of a host of tongues, all questioning, accusing, and swearing together ? Some were ready to take every star of heaven to witness, that we were a pair of Pa- phlagonian pilots, and the identical ones hired
to run two of their ships aground, by which the best expedition of the year was undone Others knew us to have been in the regular pay ot the Procurator, aud the means of betraying their last captain to the axe But the majority honoured us with the character of simple thieves, who had taken advant ige of their ab sence, and been driven to hide among the bag gage The question next arose, "how we could have got in ? and ior the first time the carousers thought of their centinél. I told them what I had seen They poured into his chamber, and their suspicions were fixed in inexorable reality— "We had murdered him ' The speediest death for us was now the only consideration Every man had his proposal, and never were more curious varieties of escipe from this evil world offered to two wretches already weary of it but the Arab's voice carried the point " He disliked seeing men tossed into the fire, ropes were too useful, and the sword was too honour able, to be employed on rogues But, as by water we came, by water we should go
The sentence was received with a shout, and amidst laughter, furious cues, and threats of vengeance, we were dragged to the mouth of the cave The sternest suicide must die in his own wav or ho will shrink I was reckless of life but I had not prepared myself for this midnight divorce from the world The tempest was ap palling The waves burst into the anchorage m huge heaps, dashing sheets of foam up to its roof The wind volleyed in gusts that took the strongest off their feet tho galleys were tossed, as if they were so many weeds on the surface of the water Limps and torchesweio useless and the only light was from the funereal gleam of the billows, and the sheets of sulphurous fire that fell upon the turbulence of ocean be vond Even the hardy forms round me were disheartened , and I took idv antage of а furious gust that swung us all aside, to struggle from their grasp and seizing a pike fight for my life Jubal seconded me with the boldness that uo decay could exhaust, and setting our backs to the rock, we for a while baffled onr execu
tioners But this could not last against such numbers as poured to their assistance Our pikes weie broken, we were hemmed in, and finally dragged again to the mouth of the ca vern, that, with its foam and the howl of the tumbling billows, looked like the jaws of some huge monster ready for its prey Enfeebled, bruised, and overpowered, 1 was on the point of denying my murderers their last indulgence, and plunging headlong, when a trumpet sounded The pirates loosed their hold , and in a few minutes a large galley with all her oars broken, and every sail torn to frag ments shot by the mouth of the cavern A joyous cry ol ť The captain ' the captain ' echoed through the vaults The galley, dis abled by the storm, tacked several times before she could make the entrance, but at length, by α masterly manœuvre, she was brought round, and darted right in on the top of a mountainous billow Before the galley touched the ground, the captain had leaped mto the arms of the band, who received him with shouts His quick eye fell upon us at once, and he de
manded fiercely, " what we were 7 " "Spies and thieves," was the general reply " Spies ' * he repeated, looking contemptuously on our habiliments " Impossible —Thieves, very likely, and very beggarly ones —Yet, do you think that such wretches would dare to come, of themselves, within our claws ' ' I denied both imputations alike He seemed struck with my words, and said to the crowd, " Tolly ' Take them away, if it does not require too much courage to touch them, and let them be washed and fed, for the honour of hospita¬ lity and their own faces The two poor devils have doubtless been driven m by the rough night, and it is rough enough to make a man wish to be any where but abroad Here, change my clothes, and order supper " «« We cannot bo too cautious They may still be spies, said the Egyptian, who had just arnved from his slumbers I attempted to explain how we came " Of course—of course/ said the captain, pulling off his dripping garments, and flinging his cloak to one, his cuirass to another, and his VOL.

cap to a third "Your rags would vouch for you in any port on earth Or, if you carry on the trade of treachery, you are very ill paid Why, Memnon,look at these fellows, would you give a shekel for their souls and bodies' Not α mite When I look for spies, I expect to find them among the prosperous The rogues who deal in «ecret intelligence, take too good care of themselves Embroidered cloaks and jewel hilted scimitars are α safer sign than naked skins at any time However, if you turn out to be spies, eat drink and sleep your best to night, for you shall be hanged to morrow ' He hurried onwards, and we followed still ш durance The banquet was reinstated, and the principal personages of the band gathered round to hoar the adventures of the voyage " All has been ill luck, said he, tossing off α bumper " The old procurator s spirit was, I think, abroad, either to take care of his plate, or to tonnent mankind, according to his custom We were within a boat s length of the prize, when the wmd came right in our teeth Every thing that could, ran for the harbour some

' Ha 1 ' exclaimed the Arab, "how could I hive forgotten that' I left Titus, or by what ever of his hundred names he chose to be culled, on guard at his own request, the day I steered for the Nile Ho was sick, or pretended to be so, and, as I gave myself but α couple of days for tho voyage, I expected to be back in time to snve lum from the horrors of his own i ompany But the wind suid otherwise—the two days were ten, and on my return, we found the wretched fellow a corpse,—whether from being taken ill, and unable to help himself, or from the assistance of those worthy persons here, whom we discovered in attendance ' "On that subject, I have no doubt what ever/ interposed the Egyptian " those villains murdered htm * " It is possible, mused the captain *' But I cannot foresee what they were to get by it A question that you at least will acknowledge to be of considerable importance, said he, with a careless smile at the Egyptian, whose avarice was proverbial The object of the satire was stung, and to
get rid of the dangerous topic, he affected wrath, and said impetuously, " Let it he so, let oui blood go for nothing Let treachery thrive Let our throats be at the mercy of every wan dering ruffian, and let us have the consolation that our labours and our sacrifices will be ho¬ noured with u sneer " He turned to the crowd waiting round us "Biave comrades 1 ' ex¬ claimed he, " henceforth understand that you are at every dugger's mercy, that, if you are left behind, you may be assassinated with im¬ punity as, if you are tuken out upon our foolish expeditions, your lives may be flung away upon the whims and follies of would-be heroes." The crowd, fickle, and inflamed by wine, gave a huzza for the "sailors friend" The Egyptian encouraged, and having a long load of gall upon his memory, made the desperate venture of at once disowning the authority of the captain, und ordering in his own name that we should be delivered over to execution The captain listened, without a word, but his hand was on his scimitar, and his cheek burned, as he fixed his eyes on the livid accuser. The
crowd pressed closer upon us, and I saw the dagger pointed at my breast—when I recol¬ lected the letter, I gave it to the captain, who read it in silence, and then with the utmost composure, desired it to be handed over to the Egyptian " Comrades," said he, " I have to apologize for a breach of the confidence that should al¬ ways subsist between men of honour. I have hei e accidentally read a letter which the cipher shows to have been intended for our trusty friend Memnon, but, since the subject is no longer confined to himself, he will doubtless feci no objection to indulging us all with the correspondence." The hand thronged round the table, expec¬ tation sat on every face, and its various ex- piession in the crowded circle of tbose strong physiognomies—the keen, the wondering, the angry, the contemptuous, the convinced, the triumphant— would have made an incomparable «tudy for a painter The Egyptian took the letter with a trembling' hand, and read the fatal words.
" The fleet will be off the northern promou tory by midnight You will light a signal and be ready to conduct tho troops into the cavern ' The reader let the fatal despatch fall from Ins hands An outcry of wrath rose on all sides and the traitor was on the point of being sacrificed, when the young Idumean generously started forward " It is known, I believe, to every man here, ' said he, " that I dislike and distrust Memnon as much as any being on earth I knew him to be base and cruel, and therefore hated him I have long suspected him of boing connected with transactions, that nothing but the madness of avarice could venture upon, and nothing but death atone But he must not pensh without trial Till inquiry is made, the man who strikes him must strike through me He placed himself before the culprit, who now taking courage, long and dexterously insisted that the lotter was a forgery, invented by " as sassins and those who employed assassins ' The tide of popular wisdom is easily turned,
opinion was now raging against me, and the Egyptian stood a fair chance of seeing his re¬ putation cleared va my blood "Come," said the captain, rising, "as we are not likely to gain much information from the living, let us see whether the dead can give us any lead on, prisoners J led the way to the recess The dead man lay untouched, but, in the interval, tbe features had returned, as is often the case in death, to the expression of former years I uttered an exclamation, he was the domestic that had be trayed me to the Procurator " Conscience ,w cried the Egyptian *' Conscience ' ' echoed the crowd The captain turned to me ' Did either you or your companion commit this murder 7 I will have no long stories They will not go down with me The fellow was α villain , and if he had lived till my return, he should have fed the crows within the next twelve hours One word —yes or no " I answered firmly " I believe you/ said the captain He took
the hand of the corpse, and called to the Egyp tian " Take this hand, and swear that you know nothing of the treason But, ha ' what have we here ? ' Ashe lifted the arm, the sleeve of the tunic gave way, and a slip of papyrus fell on the bed He caught it up, and exclaiming, " What ' to night ? pernicious villain,' —turned to the astonished band " Comrades, there is the blackest treachery among us We are sold—sold by that accursed Egyptian Strip tho slave, and fling him mto the dungeon until I return, no—he snail come with us, in chains Call up the band Every galley must put to sea instantly, if we would not be burned m our beds The trumpets sounded through the cavern, and rapid preparations were made for obeying this unexpected command The fires blazed aga η , arms and armour rang, men were mustered, and the galleys swung out from their moorings in the midst of tumult and volleys ot execrations against the treachery, that " could not wait for daylight and fair weather ' " And now,' said the captain, " while our
lads are gettmg ready, I think that it ıs time for me to sup Sit down and let us hear ov er our wine what story the prisoners have to tell' I briefly stated our escape from the dungeon " It may be a lie, yet the thing hangs not budly together Your wardrobe speaks prodi gi ou sly in favour of your veracity Ho' Ben Ah, see that the avenue into the warehouse is stopped up We must have no visits from the garrison of the tower And now, hear my story of the night —As I was lying off and on, waiting to catch tbat cursed galley, a corre »pondent on shore Lt me partly into the secret of that Egyptian dogs dealings Rich as the knave was,—and how he came by his money, Tartarus only knows,—Roman gold had charms for htm still In fact, he had been carrying on α very handsome trade in information during the lust six months, which may best account for the escape of the two fleets from Byzantium, and not less for the present safety of tbe procurator's plate ţ which» however, I hope, by the blessing of Neptune» to see, before another week, shining
upon this table. Your discovery was of infinite use That an attack upon us was intended, I was aware, but the how and when were tht difficulty The time of the attack was an¬ nounced in the papyrus, and but for the storm, we should probably be now doing other things than supping " " The sea is going down already, and the wind has changed," said the Arab " We can haul off the shore without loss of time " " Then, the sooner the better We must seal up the Romans in their port, or if they venture out on such a night, give them sound reason for wishing that they had stayed at home Their galleys, if good for nothing else, will do to burn " This bold determination was received with л general cheer the leaders rose, and drank to the glory of their expedition, and all rushed towards the galleys, which, crowded with men, lay tossing ut the edge of the arch I followed, and demanded what was to be our fate. " Here we will not stay put us to
death at once, rather than leave us to perish here " " Well then, what will you have'" " Any thing but this desperate abandon¬ ment Let us take the chances of your voyage, and be set on shore ut the first place you touch " " And sell our secret to the best bidder ' No. But I have no time to make terms with you now. One word for all ragged as you both are, you are strong, and your faces would do no great discredit to our profession You pro¬ bably think this no very striking compliment, ' said he, laughing. " However, I have tuken a whim to have you with us, and offer you pro¬ motion Will you take service with the noble company of the Ггее -trade ? " Jubal was rashly indignant, I checked him, and merely answered, that I had purposes of extreme exigency which preheated my ac cepting his offei " Ha 1 morality," exclaimed he, " you will not be seen with rogues like us 7 " H*- u -shed
aloud "Why, man, if you will not live, eat, drink travel, and die, with rog ies, where upon earth can you expect to live с die ? The dif ference between us and the world is, that we do the thing without the additional vice of hypocrisy ' The leaders, who waited round us, te't for the honour of their rulling , and, but for their awe of the captam, we stood but slight chance of living even to hear the question settled " A pike might let d little light into their understandings, ' said one " If they would not follow on the deck, they should swim at the stern/ said another " The hermits should be sent back to their dungeon to study philosophy," said a third The boat was run up on the sand " Get in," said the captain " I have taken it into my head to convince you by fact, of the honour, dignity, and primitiveness of our profession which is, in the first place, the oldest, for it was the original employment of human hands In the next place, the most universal, for it is the principle of all trades,
pursuits, and professions, from the emperor on his throne, down through the doctor, the law¬ yer, and the merchant, to the very sediment of society A loud " bravo" echoed through the cavern. "Are you not convinced yet 7 " said the captain " The Free trade is the very essence of the vir¬ tues , all the teachers of your philosophy are dumb to it. For example, I meet a merchant¬ man loaded with goods—for what is the cargo meant ? To purchase slaves, to tear fathers from their families—husbands from their wives, to burn villages, and bribe savages to murder each "ther —I stnp the hold the slave-mar¬ ket is at an end and no one suffers, but а fellow, who ought to have been hanged long ago" The captain's doctrine was more popular than ever " I meet a rich old rogue," continued he, " on his voyage between the islands. What in h° going to do 7 To marry some pretty crea¬ ture, who has a young lover, perhaps a dozen. The marnage would break her heart, and raise

I will turn the hard hearted tyrant into tenderness from top to toe His treatment of the crew of the Hytena was infamous, and by Jupiter, what I owe him shall be discharge^ m full Now, on board, my heroes, and may Neptune take care of you The trumpets flourished, the people cheered, the boats pushed off, the galleys hoisted every sail, and in a moment we found ourselves rushing through the water, under the wildest canopy of heaven
CHAPTER XVIII We stretched out far to sea, for the double purpose of falling by surpnse upon the Roman squadron, and avoiding the shoals The wind lulled ut intervals so much, that we had re course to our oars, it would then burst down with a violence, that all but hurled us out of the water I now saw more of the captam, and was witness of the extraordinary energy, acti vity, and skill, of this singular young man Never was there a more expert seaman For every change of sea or wnid, he had a new expedient, and when the hearts of the stoutest sank, he took the helm into his hands, and earned us through the chaos of water, foam,
whirlwind, and lightning, with the vigour and daring of one born* to sport with the storm As I was gazing over the vessels side, on the phosphoric gleams that danced along the ridges of the billows, he came up to me " I am sorry," said he, " that we have been compelled to give you so rough а specimen of our hospitality, and this is not altogether а sum¬ mer sea, but you saw how the matter stood The enemy would have been upon us, and the whole advantage of our staying at home would be, to have our throats cut m company " Odd and rambling as his style was, there was something m his manner and voice that had struck me betöre, even m the boisterous- ness of the convivial crowd But now, in the solitary ocean, there was α melancholy sweetness in his tones, that made me stmt with sad recollection. Yet, when by the lightning I attempted to discover in his features any clue to memory, and saw but the tall figure wrapped in the sailor's cloak, the hair streaming over his face m the spray, and every line of his powerful physiognomy at its full stretch m the
agitation of the time, the thought vanished agam " 1 hinted, ' said he, after an interval of silence, " at your taking chance with us If you will, you may But the hint was thrown out merely to draw off the fellows about me , and you are at full liberty to forget it " Tt is impossible to join you, was my an¬ swer, ' my life is due to my country ' " Oh' for that matter, so is mine, and due a long time ago my only wonder is, how I have evaded payment till now But I am a man of few words I have taken α sort of liking to you, and should wish to have α few such at hand. The world calls me villain, and the ma¬ jority of course carries the question For its opinion, I do not care а cup of water α bub¬ ble of this foam would weigh as heavy with me, as the rambling, giddy, vulgar judgment of a world, in which the first of talents is scoundrel- ism I never knew a man fail, who brought to market prostitution of mind enough to make him a tool, vice enough to despise every thing but gam, and cunning enough to keep himself
out of the hands of the magistrate, till opulence enabled him to corrupt tho law, or authority to defy it But let this pass. The point between us is, wilt you take service ? " " No '—I feel the strongest gratitude for the manliness and generosity of your piotection You saved our lives, and cur only hope of i e visiting Judea m freedom ıs through you But, young man, I bave a great cause in hand I have risked every thing for it Family, wealth, rank, hfe, are my stake, and I look upon every hour given to other things as so far a fraud upon my country ' I heard him sigh There was silence on both sides for a while, and be paced the deck , then suddenly returning, laid his hand on my shoulder " I am convinced of your honour," said he, " and far be it from me to betray a man who has indeed a purpose worthy of man¬ hood, into our broken and unhappy—aye, let the word come out, infamous career But you tell me that I have been of some use to you, I now demand the return You have refused
to take service with me —Let me take service with you ' ' I staled at lnm He smiled sadly, and said, " You will not associate with one stained hke me. Aye, for the robber there is no repent ance Yet why shall the world, ' and his voice wis full of anguish, "why sh ill the ungenerous and misjudging world bo suffered to oxpel and keep for t vt г it α dist mee those w hom it has first betrayed ' ' His emotion got the better of him and his voice sank He again approached me " I am weary of this kind of life Not that I have rt ason to complain of the men about me, nor that I dislike the roaming and chances of the sea, but, that I feel the desire to be some thing better·—to redeem myself out of the number of the dishonoured, to do something which, whether I live or die, will satisfy me that I was not meant to be—the outcast that I am " " Then join us, if you will," said I " Our cause demands the bold , and the noblest spirit that ever dwelt m man, would find its finest
field in the deliverance of our land of holiness and glory But can you leave all tbat jou have round you here ? Not without α struggle I have an infinite delight in this wild kind of existence I love the strong excitement of hazard I love the ţ erpetu il bustle of our career I love even the capntiousness of wind and wave I have wealth m return for its perils and no man knows what enjoyment is l ut he who knows it through the ftvtigue of a. sulors Ufe AU the banquets of epicurism are not half so delicious as even the simple st me il to his hunger nor tho softest bed of luxury h ılf so refreshing as tht bare deok to his weariness But I must breuk up those h ıbıts and whether beggar and slave or so! dier and obtaining the distinction of a soldiers succi se I am determined on trying my chance among mankind A shtet of lightning covered the whole horizon with blue flame and a huge bull of fire springing from tho cloud, after a long flight over the waters split upon the shore
Tho keenness of the sailor's eye saw what had escaped mine. " This was a lucky sea- light for us, said he " The Romans are lying under yonder promontory, driven to take shelter by the gale, of course —but for that fireball, they would have escaped All hands were summoned upon deck, sig nals made to the other galleys, the little fleet brought into close order, pikes, torches, and combustibles of all kinds gathered upon the poop, the sails furled, and with muffled oars we glided down upon the enemy. The Roman squadron, with that precaution which was the essential principle of their match less discipline, were drawn up in order of battle, though they could have had no expectation of being attacked on such a night. But the roai of the wind buried every other sound, and we stole round the promontory unheard. The short period of this silent navigation was one of the keenest anxiety All but tho=- necessary for the working of the vessel were
lying on their faces, we feared lest the very drawing of our breath might give the alarm, not a limb was moved, and, like a galley of the dead, we floated on, filled with destruction We were yet at some distance from the twink hug lights that showed the prefect's trireme, when, on glancing round, I perceived а dark object on the water, and pointed it out to the captain He looked, but looked in vain " Some lurking spy," said he, " that was born to pay for his knowledge With а sailor s promptitude, he caught up ι lamp, and swung it overboard It fell beside the object a small boat as black as the waves themselves " Now for the sentinel, ' were his words, as he plunged into the sea The act was rapid as thought I heard a struggle, a groan, and the boat floated empty beside me on the next billow But there was no time for search We were within an oars length of thf» anchorage To communicate the loss of their captain, (and what could human struggle do among the mountain waves ofthat sea ? ) might be to dispirit the crew, VOL II N

points of the land The sight re-uniniatt d me, I climbed up tht side of the trireme, torch in hand, unti with my higgard countt nance, made still wilder by the wild work of the night, looked α formidable apparition to men alicady harassed out of all courage They plunged overboard, and I was monarch of the finest war galley on the co ist of Syria. But my kingdom w ıs without subjects None of my own crew had followed me I siw the pirate vessels bearing down to complete the de¬ struction of the fleet, and hailed them, but they all swept far wide of the trireme. The fne had taken too fast hold of her to make approach safe I now began to feel my situation Tho first triumph was past, and I iound myself de¬ serted. The deed of devastation was in the mean while ripidly going on 1 saw the Ro¬ man ships successively boarded, almost without resistance, and in α blaze The conflagration rose in sheet and spires to the heavens, and colouied the waters to an immeasurable extent with the deepest dye of gore I heard the victorious shouts, and mine rose
spontaneously along with them In every ves sel burned, in every toich flung, 1 rejoiced m а new blow to the tyr mts oi Judea But my thoughts weie soon f uu fully brought home The fire reached tht uibus, the trireme, plunging and tossing likoa living creature in its last agony, buist away from her anchors the wind was off the shore, а gust, strong as the blow of а battering ram, sttuck her, and, on the back of а huge refluent w av<, she shot out to sea, a flying pyr unid of lire.
CHAPTER XIX Never was man more indifferent to the re suit than the solitary voyager of the burning Trireme What had life for me ' I looked at pain with instinctive dread but the wavts offered а ready refuge from the more hideous suffering and a single plunge in the whirling foam at my side would bt the complete and ш stant cure of all tho pangs that besiege the flesh I gazed round me The element of fire reigned supreme The shoie—mount mi vale, and sand—'Was bright as daj fiom tlu blaze of the tents and flouting fragments of the galleys The heavens were úíi arch of angry splendour—every stooping cloud swept along
reddened with the vanous dyes of the conflagra¬ tion below The sea was a rolling abyss of the fiercest colour of slaughtt r The blazing vessels, loosened from tho shoie, rushed madly beloro the stoim sheet and shroud shaking loost abroad, like vast wings of llame At length all disappeaied, the shoit faded tar into a dim line of light, the galleys sank or weie consumed , the sea grew dark again, the lightnings were the only blazo of heaven But the trireme, stiongly built, and of immense size, still fed the flamt, and still shot on through the tempest, that fell on her moro furiously as she lost the cover of the land The wuves rose to a height that often baflled tht wind, and left me floating m a sti unge culm between two black walls of water, reaching to the clouds, and on whost. smooth sides the image of the burning vessel wah reflected as stiongly as m a minor. But the ascent to the summit of those fearful barriers agat ι let tu the storm in its rage , the tops of tho billows wore whirled off in sheets of foam, the wind tore mast and nail away, and
the vessel was dashed forward like a stone dis¬ ellai ged from an engine 1 stood on the poop, which the spray and the wind kept clear of flame, »ud contemplated, with some feeling of tho fierce ideur of the spectucle, the fire rolling ovei orward part of the vessel in u thousand shapes und folds While I was thus tareenng along, like the genius of fire upon his throne, 1 caught α glimpse of sails scattering in eveiy direction before me—I had rushed into the middle oi one of those small trading fleets that coasted annually between the Euxine ond the Nile They flew as if pin sued by α fiend But the same wind that bore them boie me, and then screams, as the tnreme bounded from billow to billow on their track, were audible even through the roarings of the storm They gradually succeeded in spie iding them selves so fur, that the contact with the flame must bo pai tial But, on one, the largest and most crowded, the trireme bore inevitably down The hunted ship tried every mode of escape in
\T.m it manoeuvred with extr lordmary skill but the pursuer, lightened of every burthtu iiishcd on hke a messinki r of vengo ince I could distinctly see the confusion and misery of tho crowd tnat covered the detk, men and women kneeling weeping, dying, or, m the fierce not of despau, stiugghng foi some wietched spoil, or equally wit tched indulgence tint a few moments moie must tear from all alike But iniong the fearful mingling of sounds one voice 1 heard that struck to my soul 14 alune roused me from my stern scorn of hu nun sulleiing I no longer looked upon t! ose beings as upon inset ts that must be crushed in fhe revolution of the gre it wheel of f ite The heut the living hum in heart, pilpitated within me I lushed to the side of the trireme, and with voice and hand mude signals to the crew to take me on board But at my call a cry of agony echoed through the vessel All fled to its further pai t, buta few, who, unable to move, were seen dropt on their knees and m the attitudes of preternatural fear, imploring every power of heaven Shocked
by the consciousness that, even in the hour when mutual hazard softens tho heart of man, I was an object of horror, I shrank back I hea T the voice once more, and once mor* resolved to make an effort for hfe, flung а burning fragment over the side, to help me through the waves But the time was pust The fragment had scarcely touched the foam, when a sheet ot lightning wrapped sea and sky, tho flying ves¬ sel was gone My eye looked but upon the wilderness of waters The flash was fatal to both It had struck the hold ol the tnreme, in which was stowed a large freightage of the bitumen and nitre of the desert A column of flame, white as silver, rose straight and steadily up to the clouds, and the huge ship, disparting timber by timbei, reeled, heaved and plunged headlong into the bosom of the I rose to the surf ice from a prodigious depth 1 was nearly breathless My hmbs were wasted wit'i famine and fatigue, but the tossing of the surges sustained and swept me on The
chill at last benumbed me, and my limbs were heavy as non , when а broken mast rolling by entangled mo in its cordage It drove tow irds ι point of land round which tht current swept Strongly netted in the wreck I was dragged along sometimes above the water som times btlow Buta violent shock releused me and with α ut vv terror of the death that 1 had so long resisted I felt myself go down I wis ingulfed m the whirlpool ' Every sensation was horridly vivid I h id the full consciousness of hie and oi the unfa thomable depth into which I was desctnding I heard tho ro ir and rushing of the vv iters round mc the holding ol my breath was tor ture 1 str lined struggled tossed out my uuns giasped m idly around us if to t ateh so nethiug that might retard my hideous descent My eyes wt re open I nt ver was less stunned by shock or lear İhı solid darkness the sulfoca tion the furious whirl of tho eddy tint spun mo round its huge urclc like an utom of sand every sense of drowning passed through my
shattered frame with an individual and succes¬ sive pang I at last touched something, whether living or dead, fish or stone, I know not, but the im¬ pulse changed my direction, and I was darted up to the sui face The storm bad gone with the rapidity of the south The stars burned brightly blue ibove my head The pleasant breath of groves and flowery perfumes came on the waters A dis tant sound of sweet voices lingered on the air Like one loused from a frightful dream, I could scarcely behe\c that this was reality But the rolling wateis behind gave me sudden evidence A billow, the last messenger of tbe storm, hurst into the little bay, ñlied it to the brim with foam, and tossed me far forwaid It rolled hack, dragging w ith it the sedgo and pebbles of the beach, with an enormous noise I grasped the trunk of an olive, rough and firm as the rock itself The retiring wave left me , I felt my way some paces among the trees, cast myself down, and, worn out with fatigue,
had scarcely touched the eaith when I fell into that profound sleep which is the twin bio ther of death I awoke in the decline of the day, as I could perceive by the yellow and otange hues tint coloured the thick branches above me I w is lying in α delicious recess crowded with fiuit frees my bed was the turf but it was soft as down а sohtaty nightingale above my head was sending foi fh snatches of that melody which night prolongs into the very voice of sweetness and sorrow and α balmy air from tlie wild thyme and blossoms of the rose breathed sooth ingly even to the mind I liad been thrown on one of the little isles that lie off Anthoidou a portion of the Philis tine territory before it was won by our heio Maccabæus The commerce winch once filled the arm of the sea near G iza perished in the change of masters and silence and seclusion reigned in a spot formeily echoing with the tu mult of merchant and manner The httle isle the f ivounte retreat of the opulent Greek and Syrian traders in the overpowering heats of
summer, and cultivated with the lavish expen diture of commercial taste, now gave no proof of its ever having felt the foot of man, but in the spontaneous pouring out of flowers, once bi ought from every region of the East and West, and the exquisite fruits that still enriched its slope« and dells In all things else, nature had resumed her rights, the pavilions, the temples of Parian and Numidian stone, were m ruins, and buried under a carpet of roses and myrtles The sta tues left but here and there a remnant of them selves, a sublime relic wreathed over in fan tastic spirals by the clematis and other climbing plants The sculptured fountain let its waters loose over the ground, and the guardian genius that hung in marble beauty over the spring, had long since resigned his charge, and lay mutilated and discoloured with the air and the dew But the spring still gushed, bounding bright between the gray fissures of the cliff, and marking its course through the plain by the richer mazes of green To me, who was as weary of existence as
ever was galley slave, this spot of quiet loveli ness had a tenfold power My mmd, like my body, longed for rest Through life I had walked in a thorny path I had w 1 nged a tempestuous atmosphere Use¬ less uazards, wild projects, bitter sufferings, were my portion My affections, those feelings in which alone I could be said to Uve had been made inlets of pain The love which nature and justice won from me to my family, was per petually thwarted by a chain of circumstances that made me a wretched, helpless, and solitary man What then could I do better than aban don the idle hope of finding happiness among mankind, breik off the trial which must be pio longed only to my evil and elude the fate that destined me to be an exile in the world ' Yes ' I would no longer be a man of suffering in the presence of its happiness , a wretch stripped of an actual purpose or а solid hope in the midst of its activity and triumph, the abhorred ex ample of α career miseiable with defeated pur suit, aud tantalized with expectations, vain as the bubble on the stream '
In this stern resolve, gathering a courage from despair,—as the criminal st inding ou the scaffold scoffs at tho world that rejects him,—I determined to exclude recollection The spot round me was to fill up the w nole measuie of my thoughts Wife, children, friend, country, to me must exist no more I imaged them in the tomb, I talked with thein as shadows, as the gract ful and lovely existences of ages past, but laboured to divest them of the individual features that cling to the soul Lest this mystic repose should be disturbed by anv of the sights of living man, I withdrew deepei into the shades which first sheltered me It was enough for me that there was a canopy of leaves above to shield my limbs from the ca sual visitations of a sky, whose sapphire looked scarcely capable of a stain, and that the turf was soft for my couch Fruits, sufficient to tempt the most luxurious taste, were falling round, and the waters of the bright rivulet scooped in the rind of citron and orange, were a draught that the epicure might envy I was utterly ignorant on what shore of the Mediterra-
nean I was thron n, further than that the sun rose behind my bower, and threw his western lustre on the waveless expanse of sea that spread before it to tbe round horizon.
CHAPTER XX Вит no man can be a philosopher against nature With my strength thedebireofex ertion returned My most voluptuous rest became irkioine Memory would not be re strained the floodgates of thought opened once more and to resist the passion f r the world I was driven to the drudgery ol the 1 ands I gathered wood for the winters fuel in the midst of days when the sun poured fire from the heavens I attempted to build α hut beside grottos that a hermit would love I trained trees and cultivated flowers where the soil threw out all that was neb in both with ex haustless prodigality
But no expedient would appease the passion for the absorbing business of the world My bower lost its enchantment, the delight of lying on beds of violet, and, with my eyes fixed on the heavens, wandering away on the wings of fantastic illusion, palled upon me, the colours of the vision giew dim I no more imaged shapes of beauty winging the λ way through the celesti d azure, I heard no harmonies of spirits on the midnight winds, I followed no longer the sun, rushing on his golden chanot- vvheelb to lands unstained by human step or plunged with Inni into the depths, and ranged the secret wonders of ocean Labour, in its turn, grew irksome I re¬ proached myself foi the vulgar existence, which occupied only the inferior portion of my nature ! ving only for food, sleep, and shelter, what was I better than the seals that basked on the shore at my feet ? Night too,—that mysterious rest, interposed for purposes of such varied be¬ neficence—to cool the brain fevered by the bustle of the day—to soften mutual hostility by α pause, to which all alike must yield—to re-
mind our forgetful nature, by α perpetual sem¬ blance, of the time when all things must pass away, and be silent, and change—to sit m judg¬ ment on our hearts, and, by α decision which no hypocrisy can disguise, anticipate the pu¬ nishment of the villain, as it gives the man of virtue the foretaste of his reward,—night be gan to exert its old influence over me, and, with the strongest determnulioi to think no more of what had been, I closed mv eyes but to let 111 the past I might have said, that my tiue sleep was dunng the labours of the day, and my waking, when I lay with my senses sealed, upon my bed of leaves It is impossible to shut up the mmd , and I at last abandoned the struggle The spell of indolence once broken, I became as restless as an eigle ш α cage. My fust objet t was to discover on what corner of the land I was thrown Nothing could be briefer than the circuit of my island, and nothing less explana¬ tory It was one of those little alluvial spots that grow round the first rock that catches the vegetation swept down by rivers. Ages had
gone by, while reed was bound to reed, and one bed ot clay luid upon another The ocean had thrown up its pebbles on the shore, the wind had sown tiee and herb on the naked sidea of the tall rock, the tree hid driwn the cloud, and from its roots let loose tht, spring Cities and empires prmbed while this little island was foinung mto loveliness '1 hus nature perpetually builds, while decay does its work with the ротрь of mm From the shore I saw but а long line of yellow sind across а bioaJbtlt ot blue waters No sight on eaith could less ittract the eye, or be less indicative oi m in and tbe delights of civilised life Yet within that s indy b n ner, what wild and wondrous acts were doing and to be done' My mind, with a wing that no sorrow 01 bond age could tamo, pdssed over the desert, and saw the battle, the siege, the bloody sedition, the long md heait broken banishment, the fierce conflict of passions mestrainable as the tun pest, the melancholy ruin of my country by α
judgment powerful as fate, and dreary and re turnless as the grave. But the waters between me and that shore were an obstacle that no vigour of imagination could overcome I was too feeble to attempt the passage by swimming The opposite coast appeared to be uninhabited, and the few fishing- boats that passed lazily along this lifeless coast, evidently shunned the island, as I conceived, from some hidden shonl I felt myself a prisoner, and the thought irritated me That ancient disturb ance of my mind, which rendered it so keenly excitable, was born again, I felt its coining, and knew that my only resource was to escape from this circumscribing paradise, that was become my dungeon Day after day I paced the shore, awaking the echoes with my useless shouts, as each distant sa 1 glided along close to the sandy lino that was to me the unattainable path of hap piness I made signals fiom the hill , but I might as well have summoned the vultuies to stop, as they flew screaming above my head to feed on the relics of the Syrian caravans.
What trifles οαη sometimes stond between man nnd enjoyment ' Wisdom would have thanked Heaven for the hope of escaping the miseries of hfe in the little enchanted round, gu tided by that entrenchment of waters, filled with every production that could delight the sense, und giving to the spirit weary of ill that the world could offer, the gentle retirement in which it could gather its remaining strength, and make its peace with Heaven I was lying, during а fiery noon, on the edge of the island, looking towards the opposite coast, the only object on which I could now bear to look , when in the stillness of the hour I heard a strange mingling of distant sounds, yet so totally indistinct, that after long listening I could conjecture it to be nothing but the ripple of the water It died away But it haunted me, I he ird it m fancy It followed me in the twilight, when earth and heaven were soft and silent as an infants sleep—when the very spirit of tran¬ quillity seemed to be folding his dewy wings over the woild VOL II О
Weaned more with thought than with the daily toil that I imposed on myself for its cure, I had lam tlown on my bed of turf under the shelter of those thick woven boughs that scarcely let in the glimpses of the moon The memory of all whom later chances brought in my path, passed before me The fate of my gallant kinsmen in Masada , of the wily Ishmaelite, of the pirate captain, of that unhappy crew, whose danger was my involuntary deed, of my family, scattered upon the face of the world Arctu rus bending towards the horizon, told me that it was midnight, when my reverie was broken by the same sounds that had disturbed my day But they now came full and distinct I heard the crashing of heavy axles along the road, tae measured tramp of oavalry, the calls of the clarion and trumpet They seemed be¬ stie me I started from my bed but all around was still I gazed across the waters They were lying, like another sky, reflecting star for star with the blue immensity above, but on them was no living thing I had heard of phantom armies traversing
the air, but the sky was serene as crystal I climbed the mil, upon whose summit I recol¬ lected to have seen the ruins of an altar, ga¬ thered the weeds, und lighted a beacon The flame threw a wide and ruddy reflection on the waters and the sky I watched by it till morn But the sound had died as rapidly as it came And when with the first pearly tinge of the east the coast shaped itself beneath my eye, I saw with bitter disappointment but the same solitary sand The idea of another day of suspense was in¬ tolerable. I returned to my place of refuge, gave it that glance of mingled feehng, without which perhaps no man leaves the shelter which he is never to see again, collected a few fruits for my sustenance if I should reach the shore of Palestine, and, with a resolution to perish, if it so pleased Providence, but not to return, plunged into the sea The channel was even broader than I had calculated by the eye My hmbs were still en¬ feebled but my determination was strength I was swept by the current far from the oppo·
site curve of the shore, yet its force spired mine, and at length I felt the ground under my feet. I was overjoyed, * lough never was scene less fitted for joy To ihe utmost verge of the uew, spread the desert, а sullen heibless waste, glowing hke a sheet of brass m the almost ver¬ tical sun But I was on land I had accomplished my purpose Hope, the power of exertion, the chances of the glorious future were before me I was no longer a prisoner within the bordcis of a spot, which for the objects of manly life might as well have been my grave I journeyed on in the direction of Masada , there at least I should be no fugitive Yet, what fearful reverses, in this time of confusion, might not lnve occurred even there ? what certainty could I have of being spared the bitterest losses, when sorrow and slaughter reigned through the land ? Was I to be protected from the storm that fell with such promiscuous fury upon all ' I too, the marked, the victim, the example to mankind '—I looked wistfully back to the isle, that isle of oblivion 1
While I was pacing the shore, that actually scorched my leet, I heard а cry of alarm, and saw on a low range of sand lulls, at some dis*· t mee, α figure making violent gestures Friend or enemy, at least here was man, and I did not deeply care for the consequences even of meet¬ ing man in hts worst shape My life was not worth the taking Hunger ind thirst might be more formidable enemies in the end, and I advanced towards the half naked savage, who, however, ran down from the hill, crying out louder than ever I dragged my weary limbs after lum, and reached the edge of a little dell, in which stood a circle of tents I had fallen among the robbers of the desert but there was evident confusion in this frig- ment of a tribe The camels were in the ac» of being loaded, men and women were gather ing their household utensils with the haste cf terror, and dogs, sheep, camels, and children, set up their voices in a general clamour. Dreading that I might lose my only chanee of refreshment and guidance, I cned out with all my might, and ran down towardb them , but the
sight of me raised an universal scream nnd every living thing t ok flight the wainors cf the colony gallantly loading the way with a speed that soon left the pedestrians far in the rear But their invader conquered only for food I entered the first of the deserted tents and indulged myself with a full feast of bread dry and rough as tbe sand on which it was baked and of water only less bitter than that through which I had swum But all luxury is relative To me they were both delicious and 1 thanked at once tho good fortune which had provided so prodigally for those withered mo narchs of the sands and had invested me with the salutary terroi that gave the fruits of tn umph without the toil At the close of my feast I uttered a few custo n iry words of thanksgiving a ciy of joy rang in my ears I looked round saw to my suipnse a bale of carpets walk forward from a coi nei of the tent and heard a Jewish tongue imploring for life and freedom I rapidly de veloped the speaker, and from this repulsive coverture came forth one of the loveliest young
females that I had ever seen Her story was soon told She was tho grand daughter of Ana mis the 1 ite high priest one of tho most distili guished of bis n itu n for every lofty qtmhty but he had fallen on evil days llis resistance to faction sharpened the dagger t gainst him and he perished in one of the merciless feuds of the city His only descendant was sent to claim the protection of her relatives in the south of Julea But her escort was dispersei by an attack of the Arabs and in the division of the spoil the Sheik of Ibis little encampment ob tamed her as Ins share lhe robber merchant was on his way to Ce sarea to sell his рпте to the Roman povernor when my amval put his army to the rout To my inquiry into the cause of this singular sue cess the fair girl answered that the Arabs had taken me for a supernatural visit ıtır pro bably come to claim some act ount of their pro ceedings in the late expedition They had been first startled by the blaze in the island which from a wild tradition was supposed to be the dvellmg of forbidden beings The passage ot
the channel was seen and increased the won der my daring to nppear alone among men whom mankind shunned completed the belief of my more th m mortal prowess and the Arabs com age abandoned a contest, m which the least th it could h ippen to them was to be swept into the ocean or tost piecemeal upon the winds To prevent the effects of their returning in tiopidity no tun*" wis to be lost in our escape But the sun which would have scorched any thing but a lizard oraBedovveen to de ith kept us prisoners until evening W e were actively employed in the mean while The plunder of the horde was examined with the curiosity that makes one of the indefeasible qualities oi the fair m all climates and the young Jewess had not been an inmate of the tent nor possessed the brightest eves imong the daughters of wo men ior nothing With an air between play and revenge she hunted out every recess in which even the art of Arab thievery could dispose of i s produce md at length rooted up from α hole in the very
dai kest coiner of the tent, that pincions deposit for which the Sheik would have sacrificed all minkind, and even the last hair of his beard— a bag of shekels She danced with exultation, tis she poured its shining t -ntents on the ground before me ( If evei Ai ab regretted biscipture, Mid bin?, " this most unlucky oí Sheiks shall have cause But I shall teach hıra а least one virtue , repentance to the last hour o f his life. I think that I see him at this momen* fııglıt- ened into a philosopher, and wishing from the bottom of his soul, that he had, for once, re¬ sisted the temptations of his trade " But what will you do with the money, mv pretty teacher of virtue to Arabs ? ' " Give it to my preserver,' sud she, ad vancing, with a look suddenly changed fiom spoitiveness to blushing timidity, " give it to him, who was sent by Providence to ieşene a daughter of Israel from the hands of Pagans ' In the emotion of gratitude to me theie was mingled a loftier feeling, never so lovely as in youth and woman, she threw up a single glance
to heaven, and α tear of piety and gratitude filled her sparkling eye " But, temptress and teacher at onr*e by what right am I to seize on tb.» öheiks trea¬ sury ? May it not dummsr my supernatural dignity with the tribe, to be known as a plun¬ derer v> " Ha' ' said she, ■'nth a rosy smile , " who is to betray you bi ι your accomplice 7 Besides, money is reputation and innocence, wisdom and virtue, all over tho world Be rich, and man¬ kind are too rational to inquire how you became the happy possessor of that which mankind worship in their soul But listen, and let us state the case fairly " Touching with the tip of one slender finger my arm as it lay folded over my bosom, she waved the other hand m attitudes of untaught persuasion* " Is it not true," pleaded the pretty creature, " that next to a crime oi our own, is the being a party to the crime of others 7 Now, for what conceivable puipose could the Arab have col¬ lected this money ? Not for food or clothing,

exquisite production of the summer hours of life it would be idle to deny her influence in making even those summer hours sweeter But, as the companion of the mind, as the very model of a friendship that no chance can shake as the pleasant sharer of the heart of heart, the being to whom man returns after the tumult of the day, hke the worshipper to а secret shrine, to revive his nobler tastes and virtues at a source pure from the evil of the ex tentai world and glowing with a perpetual light of sanctity and love, where shall we find her equal ' or what must he our feeling towards the mighty Disposer of earth and all that it inhabit, but of admiration and gratitude to that disposal which thus combines our highest happiness with out purest virtue'

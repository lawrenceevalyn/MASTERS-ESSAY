CHAPTER I. The winter of 1633 had set in with unusual severity throughout Suabia and Bavaria, though as yet scarcely advanced beyond the first week of November. It was, in fact, at the point when our tale commences, the 8th of that month, or, in our modern computation, the 18th; long after which date it had been customary of late years, under any ordinary state of the weather, to extend the course of military operations, and without much decline of vigour. Latterly, indeed, it had become apparent that entire winter campaigns, without either formal suspensions of hostilities, or even partial relaxations, had entered professedly as a point of policy into the system of warfare which now swept over Germany

But in the ancieut city of Klosterheim it might have been imagined that nobody participated in these feelings. A stir and agitation amongst the citizens had been conspicuous for some days ; and on the morning of the 8th, spite of the intense cold, per¬ sons ofevery rank were seen crowding from an early hour to the city walls, and returning homewards at intervals, ■ with anxious and dissatisfied looks. Grbups'of both sexes were coHected at every comer of the wider streets, keenly debating, or angrdy pro¬ testing ; at'one time denouncing vengeance to some great enemy ; at another, passionately lamenting some past or half-forgotten calamity, recalled to their'thoughts "whUst anticipating a similar catas¬ trophe for the present day, AboVe all, the great square, upon which the an¬ cient castellated palace or scJiloss opened by one of its fronts", as'weU as a principal convent of the city, was the resort' of many turbulent spirits. Most of these were young men, and amongst them many students of the university*: For the war, which had thinned or'totally dispersed some of the greatest universities in Germany,* under the particular cir- cumstan'de^'of its' situation 'had greatly incieused that of Klosterheim. Judging by the tone which
prevaUed, and the random expressions which? feU upon the ear at intervals, a stranger .might conjec¬ ture that it was no empty lamentation over'im¬ pending evils which occupied this crowd, (butisomp serious pieparation for meeting or redressing thein. An officer of some distinction had been'&r, some timo observing them from the antique portals pfthe palace. It was probable, However, that'Httle, more than their gestures had reached hum; for atilepgth he moved nearer, and gradually insmuated,himself into the .thickest part of thejmob, with,|the ( air of one who took no further concern ,in their,proceed¬ ings, than that of simple curiosity. But this martial air and his dress allowed hinvna means of .covering his purpose. With more warning and Jeis,ure %( to arrange his precautions, he might have ( passed as an indifferent spectator; as it wa?, his jewel-HUted sabre, the massy gold chain, depending in front from a costly button and loop which seoured it Half ,way down,his back, andi his broad crimson gcarf^embroidered^in a style of pe^uHar, splendour, announced hm> as a favoured officer of tho Lqndgrave, whose ambitious pretensions, and tyrannical mode of supporting,them, were just now the objects of .general abhorrence^in Klosterheim.

Those who were in the outermost circles, and beyond the distinct hear¬ ing of,what he said, had been discussing ivith heat the alarming confirmation of their fears in respect to Holkerstein, or listening to the impassioned nar- \rative of a woman, who had already seen one of her sons butchered by,this ruffian's people under the walls of tbe city, and was now anticipating the same fate .for, her last surviving son and daughter, in case they should Happen to be amongst the party now expected from Vienna. She had just recited the tragical circumstances of her son's death, and had worked powerfuUy upon the sympathizing passions of the crowd, when, suddenly, at a moment so unsea- sonable/or the officer, some imperfect repetition of his words about the Provost Marshal and the rope,
passed rapidly from mouth to mouth. It was said that he had threatened every man with instant death at the drum-head, who should but speculate on assisting his friends outside, under the heaviest extremities of danger or of outrage. The sarcastic bow, and the inflamed countenance of the officer, were seen by glimpses farther than his words ex¬ tended. Kindling eyes and lifted arms of many amongst the mob, and chiefly of those on the out¬ side who had heard his words the most imperfectly, proclaimed to such as knew Klosterheim and its temper at this moment, the danger in which he stood. Maximilian, the young student, generously forgot his indignation in concern for his immediate safety. Seizing him by the hand he exclaimed,—■ " Sir, but a moment ago you Avarned me that I stood on the brink of treason,—look to your own safety at present; for the eyes of some whom I see yonder are dangerous." " Young gentleman," the other replied contempt¬ uously, " I presume that you are a student; let me counsel you^to go back to your hooks. ' There' yoti will be in your element. For myself, I am familiar with faces as angry as these—and hah'ds 'something more formidable. Believe me, I see nobody here,"
and'<he affected>to speak with'imperturbable cool¬ ness? bufc*>his v voice became tremulous with passion, f« whomiI"can , even esteem worthy of a soldier's consideration-" - ? "* j l K^t^And^yet," Colonel von Aremberg, there is at least' one man here who has had the honour of com¬ manding men i as elevated as yourself." Saying which,' he"hastily drew frora his bosom, where it hung suspended from his neck, a large flat tablet of remarkably beautiful onyx, on one side of which was" sculpttued'a very striking face ; but on the other, which he presented to the gaze of the Colo¬ nel, wasti fine representation ofan eagle grovelling on the'dust,' ond beginning to expand its wings— ivith the single xvoY&^Resurgam by way of motto. Never was revulsion of feeling so rapidly ex¬ pressed -on* any man's countenance. The Colonel looked but once—he caught tho image of the bird traUing its pinions in the dust—he heard the word JResurgam audibly 1 pronounced—his colour fled— his lips grew Hvid with passion—!and> furiously un¬ sheathing his sword, u he sprung, with Headlong for¬ getfulness of time; and'place, tipcwhis calm'antago¬ nist. With the advantage of perfect self-possession, MasimiHanfoiind'it'easy to parry the tempestuous
blows of the Colonel; and he would perhaps have found it easy to disarm him. But at this moment the crowd, who had been with great difficulty re¬ pressed by the moro thoughtful amongst the students, buret through all restraints. In the violent out¬ rage offered to their champion and leader, they saw naturally a full confirmation of the worst impres¬ sions they had received as to the Colonel's temper and intention. A number of them rushed forward to execute a summary vengeance; and the foremost amongst these, a mechanic of Klosterheim distin¬ guished for his Herculean strength, with one blow stretched Von Aremberg on the ground. A savage yell announced tho di-eadful fate which impended over the faUen officer. And, spite of the generous exertions made for his protection by MaximiHan and his brother students, it is probable that at that moment no human interposition could have availed to turn aside the awakened appetite for vengeance, and that he must have perished, but for the accident which at that particular instant of time occurred to draw off the attention of the mob. A signal gun from a watch-tower, which always in those unhappy times announced the approach of strangers, had been .fired about ten minutes before;

The courier i had broughtt ti largei budget of. letters to private^individuals (throughout/Klosterheim; many of these were written by children unacquainted with
the dreadful catastrophe which threatened them. Most of them had been long separated* by the fury of the war, from their parents. They hdd 1 assem¬ bled, from many different quarters, at Vienna,'in order to join what might be called, in Oriental phrase, the caravan. Their parents had also, in many in¬ stances, from places equally dispersed, assembled at Klosterheim,—and,-after great revolutions'of'for¬ tune, they were now going- once more to rejoin'each other. Their letters expressed the feelings of >hope and affectionate pleasure' suitable to the'''occasion. They retraced the perils they had passed during the twenty-six days of their journey,—the great towns, heaths, and forests they had traversed since leavin'r the gates of Vienna; and expressed^ in the innocent terms of childhood, the pleasure they felt in* having come within two stages of the gates of Klosterheim. " In the forest," said they, «there will be no more dangers to pass; no soldiers; nothing worse than wild deer." ■ u i < Letters written in these»terms, contrasted,'with the mournful realities of 1 the case,'Sharpened(the anguish (of fear "and r suspense"throughout nthe whole city ;'and Maximilian with hisifriebds,'unable to bear the -loud expression of the public feelings,

It was now nearly a month since they had taken their de¬ parture from Vienna, at which point considerable numbers had assembled from the adjacent country to take the benefit of their convoy. Some of these- they had dropped at different turns in their route, but many more had joined them as they advanced ; for in every considerable city they found large accu¬ mulations of strangers, driven iu for momentary shelter from the storm of war as it spread over one district after another; and many of these were eager to try the chances of a change, or, upon more con¬ siderate grounds, preferred the protection of a place
situated Hke Klosterheim, in a nook as yet unvisited by*the'Scourge of miHtary execution. Hence it happened,'that from a party of seven hundred and fifty, with an escort of four hundred Yagers, which was the amount of their numbers on passing through the gates of Vienna, they had graduaUy sweUed into a train of sixteen-hundred, including two companies of,'dragoons who'had joined them by the Emperor's orders at one'of the fortified posts. ' ■'" r '.Itrwas felt> as a circumstance of noticeable singu- larityy'byfmost of the party, that,'after traversing a large ipart of'Germany nvithout encountering any very imminent perii^they should 'be first summoned to "unusual vigilance, and aU'the most jealous pre¬ cautions-of-fear,) at ithe very termination of their journey. In aU -parts of their route they had met with columns of troops pursuing itheir march, and now and'then "with roving bands of deserters, who were formidable to the unprotected traveUer. > Some , they "had overawed >by theiri display of miHtary strength;,from others,-in the Imperial service, they had'received-cheerful assistance;'and any Swedish cprps,-which-rumour'had presented as formidable by tbeir numbers, they had, with > some exertion of forethought -.and -contrivance, constantly evaded,
either by a little detour, or by a temporary halt in some place of strength. But now it was univer¬ sally known that they were probably waylaid by >a desperate and remorseless freebooter, who, as he put his own trust exclusively in the sword, allowed no¬ body to hope for any other shape of deliverance. ' Holkerstein, the military robber, was one of the many monstrous growths which had arisen upon the ruins of social order in this long" and unhappy, war. Drawing to himself all the molecontentsof his own neighbourhood, and as many deserters from the re¬ gular armies in the centre of Germany as he could tempt to his service by the license of unlimited pil¬ lage, he had rapidly created a respectable force—had possessed himself of various castles in Wirtemberg-, within fifty or sixty miles of Klosterheim—had at¬ tacked and defeated many parties of regular'troops sent out to reduce him—and by great activity and local knowledge, had raised himself to so much con¬ sideration, that the terror of his name had spread even to Vienna; and the escort of Yagers had been granted by tho Imperial government as much on his account as for any more general reason. A lady, who was in some way related to the EmperorVfa- raily, and, by those who were in the secret, was re-

Youth and health sleep well; and with all the means and appliances ot the Lady Paulina, wearied besides as she had been with the fatigue of a day's march, performed over roads almost impassable from roughness, there was little reason to think that she would miss the benefit of her natural advantages. Yet sleep failed to come, or came only by fugitive snatches, which presented her with tumultuous dreams—sometimes of the Emperor's court in Vienna, sometimes of the vast succession of trou¬ bled scenes and fierce feces that had passed before her since she had ..quitted that city. At one mo¬ ment she beheld the travelling equipages and far- stretching array of her own party, with their mili¬ tary escort filing off by torchlight under the gate¬ way of ancient cities; at another, the ruined villages, with their dismantled cottages—doors and windows torn off, .walls scorched with fire, and a few gaunt dog-s, ivith o wolf-like ferocity in their bloodshot eyes, prowling about the ruins,—objects that had really so often afflicted her heart. Waking from those distressing spectacles, she would fall into a fitful dose, whick presented her with remembrances still more alarming; bands of fierce deserters, that eyed her travelling party with a savage rapacity which
did not confess any powerful sense of inferiority; and in the very fields which they had once cultivated, now sUenttund tranqml from utter desolation,'-the moddering bodies of the unoffending peasants, left imhonoured with the rites of sepulture, in .many places from the^snere e^ennination of the.whole rural population 6f their ndghbourhood. -To these succeeded a wUd chaos of figures, in which the dress and tawny features ,of< Bohemian -gipdes v conspicu- oudy prevailed,'just as .she Had seen? thein of late making war on dl parties dike-; and,, m'the person of their leader,<her fancy suddeuiyrestored to-her a vivid resemblance of i their, suspidoua, host at their present quarters, and of the mdicious gaze with which* He had disconcerted her. , -, , - , , A sudden,movement of thei carriage awakened her, and, by the Hght of a lamp.suspended from a projecting bough of j a tree, Bheibehdd, on looking out,-the sallow countenance of the very man, whose image Hadf^o^recently'infestedvher dreame.,, 3The Hght;being;Considerably nearer^td him,thon to her- 8elf,> n 8hfli,CQuld^see, without tHdqgf^istinctly, seen; and, jb#vwg J an;eady.h v e£^ tions flgdnf^lthi^iniap.'s.bqnea^t.wHich'Hrid been urged by the officer, undTrithout reply from the sus¬ pected party, she now determined to watch him. c

There was no time to be lost; the officer instantly withdrew his yagers from'the'wood, posted a'strong (guard at the wood side,' 1 J bounded the' darm throughout the camp, agreeably to' the system of signals previously con- certedi mounted about thirty men) whose Horses and themselves were kept in perfect equipment du¬ ring 'each' of 'the'might'watches, and then advancing to the'tfea'd of tHe 1 barriers, prepared to receive the party of strariger's'in whatever character th'ey should happen to present themselves. ' AU this'had been' 'done with's'o much promptitude and'decisibni'that 1 on 1 reaching the barriers, the officer found the'strangershot yet come up. In fact, they had halted at'a'strong'outpost about a quarter of a mile in' advance of Waldenhausen"; and though one or two patrollers came' dropping' in'from by-roads on the fdWsVheafch, who'reported tneinas enemies, from J tKe^indistinct'view they had' caught'of their eqdpments,' it 'h'ad'afreaay''hecome J doubtful from their movem'entswheth'er they would really prove' so. Two of their party were now descried upon the
road, and nearly close up with the gates of Walden¬ hausen ; they were accompanied by several of jthe guard from the outpost; and, immediately on bdng haUed, they excldmed, " Friends, and from.Klos¬ terheim !'' i < ■ , He who spoke was a young cavaHer, magnificent dike in his person, dress, and style of his appoint¬ ments. He was superbly mounted, wore the deco¬ rations of a major-general in the Imperial service, and scarcely needed the explanations which he gave to exonerate himself froni the,suspi,cion of, being a leader of robbers under Holkerstein. s Fortunately enough dso, at a period when officers of, the most distinguished merit were too qften unfdthful to their engagements, or passed with so much, levity from-service to service, as to justify ^n indiscrimi¬ nate jealousy of aU who were not in the pul^Hc eye, it happened that the officer of the watch, formerly, when mounting guard at the Imperid palace, had been famiHar, with the personal appearance of the cavaher, and could speak, of His own ( knowledge to the.favour.ivhichhe had enjoyed at the v Emperor's court. After short explanations, therefore, he, was admitted, and thankfully welcomed,,in i the,camp;

And hence, not less than from the noble ingenuousness of their natures, the martial young cavaHer, and the superb, young beauty of the Impe¬ rial, (house, on recovering themselves from their first transpqrts, found,no motives tp any feelingvof false shame, either,in,the.ir ri own consciousness* or in the reproving t looks, of ; any whoistood [around them. On the contrary, as the grown-up spectators were
almost exclusively female, to whom the evidences of faithful love are never other than a serious sub¬ ject, or naturally associated with the ludicrous; many of them expressed their sympathy with the scene befoie them by tears, and all of them in some way or uther. Even in this agVof more fastidious manners, it is probable that the tender interchanges of affection betw , een l *a young couple' rejoinmg each other after deep 1 calamities/and ^s'tandi^'g , on 4 the brink of fresh,''perhaps ertdlcss soparation^fwotild meet witlnsomething of'the same'indulgence from the least interested witnesses. ** ^< * **.mrU. Hence the hews was' diffused through tne 'camp with general'satisfaction,' that a noble 1 'and*accom¬ plished cavaHer, 1 the favoured Id ver of theii 1 beloved young mistress, had joined them from'Klosterheim with a chosen band'of'volunteers, upon whose fideHty in action'tHey might entirely depend.'

The elite of then' own men might be superior to most of his, though count¬ ing amongst'thcir-number many deserters from ve¬ teran TOgiments ; but the horses of tlieir own party were in general poor and'out of condition,—and of the 1 whole'train, whom Maximilian had inspected <it starting, not two hundred could be pronounced -fit for making or sustaining a charge, i It ivas true, that by mounting some of their picked troopers upon ,the superior horsesof the mostdistinguished amongst the travellers, who had willingly consented to an arrangement of this nature for the general benefit, % some partial remedy hadlbeen applied to their weak¬ ness in that'one particular.!' But'tbere were others in'ivhichiHolkerstein had even greater advantages; more i especially, the i [equipments i of his partisans were entirely'new,' having been' plundered from an ill-guarded armoury near Munich, or from convoys which he had attacked. ," Who would be a gentle¬ man," says an old proverb, " let him storm a town,"

Manyiinterestingt anecdotes were connected with the history of this buttding; and the beauty of the forest scenery, was conspicuous even<in'winter, enUvened
as the endless woods continued to be'by the scarlet berries of mountain-ash, or the dark verdure'of the hoUy and 'the ilex. 1 Under her present frame 'of pensive feeling, the quiet lawns and long-withdraw¬ ing glades of these vast woods, had a touching effect upon the feehngs of PauHna; their'deep'silence, and the fa"anquiIHty which'reigned amongst them, contrasting in her remembrance'with 1 the'hideous scenes of carnage and desolation through 1 which her path had too often lain.' With these'predisposing influences to aid him, Maximilian found it easy to draw off her attention from the 'dangers which pressed upon their situation. Her sympathies were so quick with those whom she loved, that she'rea- ddy adopted their apparent hopes or' their 'feats; and so entire ivas her confidence' in the superior judgment, and the perfect gaUantry of'her lover, that her countenance reflected immediately the'pre¬ vailing expression of his. * " ' ' '' Under these impressions ''MaximiHan' suffered her to remain. It seemed cruel'to'disturb her'with the truth. He was sensible that continued anxie'ty, and dreadful or afflicting spectacles,'had ivith her, as with'most'persons iof'her sex'in Germany at-that time', i unless'protected by « singular insensibiHty,
somewhat impaired the firm tone of her mind. He was determined, therefore, to consult her comfort, by disguising or palliating their true situation. But for his own part, he could not hide from liis convic¬ tion tbv extremity of their danger; nor could he, when recurring to the precious interests at stake upon the issue of that and the next day's trials, face with any firmness the afflicting results to which they tended, under the known barbarity and ruffian cha¬ racter'of their unprincipled enemy. air 1 ' . i .11, i.

The chateau of Falkenberg, which the traveUers reached with the decline of light,,had the usual dependencies of offices and gardens, uhich ,may be supposed essential to a prince's hunting establish¬ ment in that period.

The great central pile of the building was dis¬ mantled of furniture ; but the tmvelleis tarriod v/ith them, as ivas usual in tho heat of war, all the means of fencing against tbe cold, and giving even a luxu¬ rious equipment to their dormitories. In so large a party, the deficiencies of one were compensated by the redundant contributions of another. And so long as they were not under the old Roman interdict, excluding them from seeking fire and water

Even the worthless and insolent Earl of Leicester, 5
with his gaUant nephew—that xtltimus Romanorum in 'the roUs of chivalry—were not excluded, though it was pretty evident that a CathoUc zeal Had pre¬ sided in forming tho coUection, For together with the 'Prince-of Orange, and Henri Quatre, wero to be seen their vile assassins'—portrayed ivith a la¬ vish ostentation of ornament, and enshrined in a frame so gorgeous, as raised them in some degree to the rank of consecrated martyrs. . 4 > t Frora these past generations of eminent persons, who retained only a traditional or legendary import¬ ance in the eyes of most who were now revieiving them, aU turned back with deHght to the active spirits of their own day, many > of them yet Hving, and as warm with Hfe and Heroic aspirations as their inhnitable portraits had represented them. Here was TiUy, the " little corporal," now recently stretched in a soldier's grave, »with his wily and in¬ flexible features. Over against liim was his great enemy, who had first taught i him -the hard lesson of retreating, Gustavus Adolphus, with His colossal bust,' and « atlantean shoulders, fit to bear the weight i of'mightiest monarchies" He also had perished, and too probably tby the double'crime of assassination and private treason ; but the pubHc glory of his E
short career was proclaimed in the ungenerous ex¬ ultations of Catholic Rome from Vienna to Madrid, and the individual i heroism in the lamentations of soldiers 5 tmder every banner which now floated in Europe. Beyond him ran the long line of Imperial generals—from i Wallenstein, the magnificent and the imaginative, with Hamlet's infirmity of pur¬ pose, De Mercy, &c, down to the heroes of pauisan warfare, Hoik, the Butlers, and the noble Papen- heim, or nobler Piccolomini. > Below them were ranged—.Gu^ovus Horn, Banier, the' Prince of Saxe-Weimar, the Rhinegrave, and many other Protestant commanders, whose names and military merits were familiar to Paulina, though she now beheld their features for the first time. Maximilian was here the best interpreter that bhe could possi¬ bly have met with. For he had not only seen the greater part of them on the field of battle, but as a favourite and confidential officer of the Emperor's, had personally been concerned in diplomatic trans¬ actions with the most'distinguished'am jngst them. Midnight 'insensibly surprised them Avhilst pur¬ suing the many interesting historical remembrances which the portraits called up. Mo3t of the com¬ pany upon this warning of the advanced hour began
to drop off; some to rest, and some upon the sum¬ mons, of the mditary duty which awaited them ? in their turn, n In this way, 'MaximiHan and PauHna wore graduaUy left alone, and nowiat length found a time which 'had not 'before offered for communi¬ cating freely aU that pressed upon thdr'hearts. Maximilian, on this part,' 'going back to the period of their last sudden separation, expldned his own sudden disappearance from Vienna. At a moment's warning he had been sent off'with seded orders from the Emperor, to bo first opened in Kloster¬ heim : tho mission upon which he had. been dis¬ patched was of consequence to the Imperial interests, and through his Majesty's favour would evcntuaUy prove so to his own. Thus it was that he had been peremptorily cut off from aU opportunity of commu¬ nicating to herself the purpose and direction of his journey previoudy to His departure fromVienna; and if his Majesty had not taken that' carei upon liimself, but Had contented himself in the most general terms with assuring PauHna that'MaximiHan'was absent on a private mission, doubtless liis liutention-'had been* the'land I one of procuring! her a more dgnd surprise of pleasure upon his own sudden return. Unfortunately, ! however, tliat 1 return had become
impossible: things had latterly taken a turn, which embarrassedi himsdf, and continued .to require his presence. These perplexities had been for some time knoivn ,to f the Emperor ; and upoja reflection, he doubted /not,i that ,Her own, journey, .undertaken before^his,Majesty coidd be aware of the dangers which.wpuild beset/its latter end, must i,n some way be connected r with the remedy which tHe Emperor designed for,this, difficult affair. JBut doubtless she herself was'the .bearer, of sufficient explanations from tb.e, Imperial ministers on that head. FinaUy, whilst assuring her that his own letters to herself had been as , frequcnti as in any former, absence, Maximilian confessed ithat he did not, fed greatly astonished at the fact of none atinU having reached her, when He recoUected.that.to the usual adverse accidents of war,j daily, intercepting aU messengers not powerfuUy escorted? were to be added, in tliis case^ the express efforts of private malignity in com¬ mand of nU the forest.passcs. , ( lit > ' o i , This explanation, recdled PauHna to ,a very pdn- ful sense of, the crjticd importance which might be attached to the papers .which she Had lost. As yet, she had found no special opportunity, or, believiDg it of less importance, Had neglected it, for communi-
coting more than the general fact of a robbery. She now related the case moie'circumstantiaUy; and both were struck with it, as at this moment a'very heavy misfortune.' Not'only might her own perilous journey] and the whole purposes dT the' Emperor embarked upon it, be thus rendered abortive; but their common enemies woidd by this time'be pos¬ sessed of the ivhole information which had been so critically lost to their own party, and perhaps would have it in their power to make use of themselves as instruments for defeating their own most important hopes. ' MaximiHan sighed as he reflected on the proba- bUity that a far shorter and bloodier event might defeat every earthly hope ivithin the next twenty- four Hours. But He dissembled his feeHngs; re¬ covered even a tone of gaiety; and, begging of Pau¬ Hna to dismiss this vexatious incident from her thoughts, as a matter that after dl wodd probably be remedied by their first communication ivith the Emperor, and before any evil had resdted from it, he accompanied her to the entrance of Her own smte of chambers^ and then returned to seek a few hours' repose for himself on one of the sofas he had ob-
served in one of the small anterooms attached to the library, - Uf • > ! 1 >'The' particular room which he selected for his purpose",' orf account of its small size, and its warm ap- 'pearance ( in other respects, was furnished under foot with layers 6f heavy Turkey carpets, one laid upon another '(according to a fashion then 'prevalent in Germany)/ and on the walls with tapestry. In this mode of hanging rooms, though sometimes heavy and sombre, there was a warmth sensible and ap- paient'as well as real, which peculiarly fitted it for winter' apartments, and a massy splendour which accorded'with the style of dress and furniture in that gorgeous age. One real disadvantage, however, it had as often employed ; it gave a ready conceal¬ ment tointniders with evil intentions; and under the protecting screen of tapestry many a secret had been discovered; many robberies facilitated; and some ce¬ lebrated murderers had been sheltered, with circum¬ stances ofmystery that for ever baffled investigation. 1 ' Maximilian, smiled as the sight of the hangings, •■with' their rich colours glowingf in the fire-hght, brought back to his remembrance one of those tales whibh'in the'preceding winter'had made a great nbise in Vienna. With a soldier's carelessness, he
thought Hghtly of, ,all? dangers that could arise within four walls ; and having- extinguished the Hghts which burned upon a table,!and,unbuckled his sabre,'he threw himself upon aisofa .which, he drew near to jthe fire ; and then enveloping liimself in t a large horseman's cloak, he courted the approach of sleep. The fatigues of the day, and of the pre¬ ceding night, had made this in some measure needful to him.., But weariness is not always the best pre¬ face to repose ; and the irritation of many busy anxieties continued for 6ome time to keep him in a most uneasy state of vigilance. As he lay, he could see on one side the fantastic figures in the fire com¬ posed of wood and turf; on the other side, looking to the tapestry, he i saw thei wild , forms, and' tbe melee, Httle less fantastic, of human and'brute fea¬ tures in a chase—a boar, chase in (front, and a, stag chase on ihis left hand. .These, as they rose fitfully .in bright.masses of colour andi of savage expression under ithelambent flashing of the fire, continued.to excite hisiirritable 6tate<of feehng ; and it/ivi" not ifor someitime that he felt>,this jineasy,condition give way to exhaustion. ,uHe was at (length puthe veryipomti of falHng asleep, or perhaps had already tfidlen into its yery Hghtest and earHest stage, when

him with." some* uneasiness. But overpowering weariness gave'him a strong- interest in dismissing them.'i And a soldier, with the images of fifty com¬ bats fresh in his'mind, does not willingly admit the idea of dagger from a single arm, and in. a situation of household security. Pshaw! he exclaimed, with some disdain,' as these martial remembrances rose up before him, especially as the silence had now continued undisturbed for a quarter of an hour. In five minutes more he had fallen profoundly asleep; "and Jin less than'one half hour, as he afterwards "judged, he was suddenly awakened by a dogger at his throat. " <- i - i > ■< > ' > »<'At one bound he sprung 'upon 'his feet. The cloak, in which he had been enveloped, caught upon some of the- buckles or ornamented work of his appointments, and for a moment embarrassed his raotions-TiThere was no light, except what came from the sullen and intermitting gleams of the fire. •But even this was sufficient to showhim the dusky outline of two figures.' With the i foremost he grappled, and, raising him in his arms, threw him powerfully upon the floor, with a force that left him stunned andjhelpless. ■ 'The other had endeavoured .to pinion his arms from behind;'for the body
armour, which MaximiHan had not laid aside for the night, under the many anticipations of service which their situation suggested, proved a sufficient protec¬ tion against the blows of the assassin's poniard. Im¬ patient of the darkness and uncertainty, MaximiHan rushed to the door and flung it violently opsn. The assassia stiU clung to his arms, conscious that if he once forfeited his hold until he had secured a retreat, he should be taken at disadvantage. But Maximilian now drawing a petronel .which Hung^at .liisibelt, cocked it as rapidly as his embarrassed, i motions aUowed him. The assossinifaltwed, conscious that a moment's relaxation of grasp would enable His antagonist to turn the muzzle over His shoulder. Maximilian, on the other hand, now perfectly awake, and with the'benefit of that self-possession which the other so entirely wanted, felt the nervous tre¬ mor iu the viUain's hands; and profiting-by; this moment t of indecision, made a desperate i effort, released one arm, which he used with so much effect as immediately to Hberate the other, and then inter¬ cepting the-passage to the stairs,, wheeled) round upon his murderous) enemy* and, presenting' the petronel to His breast, bad him surrender His arms if He Hoped for quarter. t <> u ,
The man was an athletic, and, obviously, a most powerful ruffian.\ ( On his face he carried more than one large glazed cicatrix, that assisted the savage expression, of-maHgnity impressed by nature upon his feature^. And his .matted black hair, with its elf locks,'completed the picturesque effect of a face, that i procldmed, ■'in,.every lineament,) a .reckless abandonment11to icruelty .and ferocious passions. MaximUian iliimsdf,'iamiliar as He was i ivith the faces of"milit;aryibutchers in-the'dreadful hours of sack and carnage,, recoiled for one instant from this hideous ruffian, who had -not' even the palliations of youth-in Hisfavour' for hd seemed fifty at,the least. AU'this had passed in an instant of time ;and now, as he recovered himself from ihis momentary shock at so'hateful.an expression of evU passions,' great was MaximiHan's astonishment to perceive his anta¬ gonist apparently r speechless,'- and istruggUng with some over-mastering senseof horror, that convulsed his features,' and for.a-momcnt glazedhis eye. - MaximUian lookediaroundtlfor-the'object of his darm; butrimvdn.f Inirealitydtiwas Himself, in connexion with somertoo dreadful remembrances, now suddenly awakened, 1 that had thus overpowered the man's nerves. THe brilHant Hght of a large
chandeHer which overhung the staircase, feU strong¬ ly upon MaximiHan's features ;'and the excitement of the moment gave to them the benefit of their fuUest expression. ' Prostrate'on the tground,'and abandoning his dagger without'inveffort at retaining it, the man gazed, as if under a rattlesnake's fasci¬ nation, at the young soldier before hira. 1 1 Suddenly he recovered his voice; and, with a piercing cry of unaffected terror, excldmed, "'Save me,'save one, blessed Virgin !—Prince, noble prince,' forgive me! —WiU the'grave not hold its own?—Jesu Maria! who could'have'believed it?" I "I" i ' i'ii> ' <-'"' ■' "Listen, fallow!" interrupted Maximilian; "What princo is it you speak of?—For whom do you tdte me ? speak trdy, and abuse notjmy forbearance." " Ha I and his own voice too I—and here on'this spot!—God is just I—Yet do thou, good patron, holy St Ermengarde, deliver me from the avenger!" " Man, you rave !>—Stand up, recover yourself, and unsner me^to whatilishaU ask theei speak truly, and'thoujshaltihavethyvHfe. mWhose 'gold was'it that armed,thy hand against one'who had injured neither thee nor thino ?1V » d " / But he spoke ito one avho codd no longer hear The man groveUed on the ground, and hid His
face from a being, c whom, in some incomprehensible way, he'regarded as an npparition from the other world. " ,r < Multitudes of persons'had by this time streamed in; summoned by the noise of the struggle from all parts of the'chateau. 'Some fancied that, in the frenzied assassin on the ground, whose panic too manifestly attested itself as genuine, they recognised one ofi those who had so obstinately dogged them by side-paths in the forest. Whoever he were, and upon whatever mission employed, he was past aU rational examination; at the aspect of MaximiHan, he relapsed into convulsive horrors, which soon became -too 'fit for medical treatment to aUow of any useful judicial enquiry; and for the present he was consigned to the safe-keeping of the Provost- Marshal. • ' " His companion, meantime, 'had profited by his opportunity, and'the general confusion, to effect his escape. Nor was this 1 difficult. Perhaps in the consternation of the'first moment, 'and'the exclu¬ sive attention that settled 'upon the 'party in the corridor, he might even' have mixed'in the crowd. But this was 1 not necessary.' For, on raising 1 the tapestry, a door ivas discovered which opened into
a private passage, having a general communication with the rest of the rooms on that floor. Steps were now taken, by sentries disposed through the interior of the mansion at proper points, to secure themselves from ithe enemies who lurked iwithin, whom hitherto they had too,much,neglected for the avowed and more military assailants who me¬ naced them from without. Security was thus restored. But a deep impression accompanied the party to theii- couches, of the profound pohtical motives, or (in the absence of those) of the ran¬ corous personal malignity, which could prompt such obstinate persecution; by modes also, and by hands, which encountered so many chances of failing; and which, even in the event of the very completest success for the present, could not be expected, under the eyes of so many witnesses, to escape a final ex¬ posure. Some enemy, of unusual ferocity, was'too obviously working in the dark, and iby agencies as mysterious as'his own purpose. Meantime, in the city of ,Klosterheim the gene¬ ral interest in the fortunes of the approaching tra¬ vellers had suffered no abatement, and some circum¬ stances hadoccurredto increase the popular irritation. It was known that Maximilian had escaped with a
strong tparty of friends from the city; but how, or by whose connivance, could in no way be discovered. This had 'drawn upon dl persons who were known as active partisans.against the Landgrave, or Hable to suspidon.as friends of MaximUian, a vexatious persecution from the military poHce of'the town. Some had been arrested; many coUediupon to give security for their future behaviour; and aU had been threatened or treated with' harshness.! 'Hence, as weU as from previous irritation and darm on account of the party frora Vienna, the whole town 1 was in a state of extreme agitation, , tJ , v • ' * Klosterheim, in the main features of its poHticd distractions, reflected, almost as in a representative picture', the condition of many another German city. At that period, by veiy ancient ties of reciprocal ser¬ vice, strengthened by treaties, by reHgious fdth, and by persond attachment to individuals of "the Impe¬ rial house, this ancient and'sequestered city was'in- aHenably/bound to the interests of the Emperor. -Both the dty and the university were CathoHc. •PrinceS'of theJmperid family, and-Papd.commis- doners, who had secret motives for not appearing at'Vienna, hadnnore than once-found'a hospitable reception .within the iwaUs.-j*'And,,famongst many 1
acts of grace by which the Emperors had acknow¬ ledged these services and marks of attachment,'one of them had advanced a very large sum of money to the city chest for an indefinite time; receivings in re¬ turn, os the warmest testimony of confidential gra¬ titude which the rity could bestow, that jus ■liber i ingressds', which entitled the Emperor's armies to a free passage at oU times, and, in cases of extre¬ mity, toth& right of keeping the dty gates and maintaining a garrison in the citadel. Unfortunate¬ ly, Klosterheim was not sui juris, or on the roU of free cities of the Empire, -but of the nature of an appanage in the family of the Landgrave of X -----; and this circumstance had produced a double per¬ plexity in the poHtics of the city;—for the late Landgrave, who had-been assassinated m>a very mysterious manner upon a hunting party, benefited to the foUest extent both by the poHtical and reH¬ gious bias of the city—being a personal friend of the Emperor's, a CathoHc, amiable in his deportment, and generaUy beloved by His subjects. But the Princo who had succeeded him in the Landgraviate as the next.heir, was every where odious for the harshness of his government, no less than for the gloomy austerity of his character; and to Kloster- E
heim,' in particular, which had been pronounced by some of the first jurisprudents a femde appanage, he presented himself under the additional disadvan¬ tages of a very suspicious title and a Swedish bias, too notorious to be disguised. At a time when the reHgious and poHtical attachments of Europe were brought into colHsions so strange, that the foremost auxiliary of the Protestant interest in Germany was redly the most distinguished Cardinal in the Church -of Rome, it did not appear inconsistent with this strong leaning ,to the King of Sweden, that the Landgrave was privately knoivn to be a CathoHc bigot, who practised the severest penances, and, ty¬ rant as he sHowed himself to all others, gi'oveUed himself as an abject devotee at the feet of a haughty confessor. Amongst the populace of Klosterheim, this featureiof his character, confronted)uith the dauy proofs of his entire vassalage to the Swedish interest, passed for. the, purest hypocrisy; and he had credit for no religion at aU with the world at large. But the fact, was otherwise. Conscious from the first that he held even the Landgraviate by a slender title (for Ho was no more than cousin pnce removed to his immediate predecessor), and that his pretensions upon Klosterheim Had separate
and peculiar defects, sinking of course i with nthe failure of his cldm as Landgrave, buttnot'therefore prospering ivith its success,—he was>aware thatiione but the most powerful arm could keep his princely cap upon his Head. The competitors for anyi part of his possessions, one and aU, had tthrown them¬ selves upon the Emperor's protection. "This, if no other reason, woidd have thrown him into the'arms of Gustavus Adolphus; and with this,'as'it'hap¬ pened, other reasons'of loed importance had 'then and since co-operated. Time, asitadvanced'Tirought increase of weight to all these motives. ' Rumours of a daik and ominous tendency, arising no''one knew whence, nor by whom encouraged, pointed'in- juriously to the past history of tho Landgrave, rind to some dreadful exposures which were hanging over his head. A lady, at present in 1 obscurity, was alluded to as the agent of redress to others, through her own heavy wrongs; 'and these rumours ivere the more acceptable to the people of' Klosteiheim, because they connected tho impending punishment of the hated Landgrave with the restoration of the Imperial connexion; for it was 'still £ insinuated, under eveiy version of these mysterious 1 reports, that the Emperor was the ultimate supporter, in the
last resort, of the lurking claims now on the point of coming forward to challenge public attention. Under these alarming notices, and fully aware that sooner or later he must be thrown into collision ivith the Imperial court, the Landgrave had now for some time made up his mind to found a merit with the Swedish chancellor and general officers, by precipi¬ tating an uncompromising rupture with liis Catholic enemies, and thus to extract the grace of a volun¬ tary act, from what, in fact, he knew to be sooner or later inevitable. j Such was the positive and relative aspect of the several interests which were now struggling in Klos¬ terheim. Desperate measures were contemplated by both parties; and, as opportunities ^should arise, and proper means shoidd develope themselves, more than one party might be said to stand on the brink of great ? explosions. , Conspiracies were moving in darkness, both in the councd of the burghers and of the university. Imperfect notices of, their schemes, and, sometimes delusive or misleading notices, had reached the Landgrave. The city, the university, and the numerous convents, were crowded to excess with refugees. ( Malecontents of every denomina¬ tion and every shade,—emissaries of all the factions
which then agitated Germany,—reformado roldiers, laid aside by their original employers, under new arrangements, or from private jealousies of new commanders,—great persons with special reasons for courting a temporaiy seclusion, and preserving a strict incognito,—misers, who fled with their hoards of gold and jewels to this city of refuge,-— desolate ladies, from the sm'rounding provinces, in search of protection fov themselves, or for the honour of their daughters; and (not least distin¬ guished among the many classes of fugitives) pro¬ phets and enthusiasts of every description, whom the magnitude of the poHtical events, and their reHgious origin, so naturaUy caUed forth in swarms; —these, and many more, in connexion with their attendants, troops, students, and the terrified pea¬ santry, from a circle of forty idles radius around the city as a centre, had sweUed the city of Klos¬ terheim, from a total of about seventeen, to six or seven-and-thirty thousand. War, ivith a sHght reserve for the late robberies of Holkerstein, had as i ; yet spared this favoured nook of Germany. The great storm had whistled and raved around them; but hitherto none had penetrated the sUvan sanc¬ tuary, which on every sido invested this privUeged
city." The ground seemed charmed by some secret spells, 'and consecrated from intrusion. For the great' tempest had often swept directly upon them, and'yet still had wheeled off, summoned away by "some momentary caU, to some remoter attraction. But now at length all things portended, that, if the war should revive in strength after this brief sus- 'pehsion, it woidd fidl with accumulated weight upon tHis yet u'nravaged district. '"Tliis was the anticipation which had governed tHe' Landgrave's poHcy in so sternly and barbarously 'interfering ivith the generous purposes of the Klos- 'terlieimers, for carrying over a safe-conduct to their friends and visitors, when standing on the margin of the forest. Tho robber Holkerstein, if not expressly 'countenanced by the Swedes and secretly 'nursed'up to his present strength by Eichelieu, ivas 'at any rate embarked \ipon a system of aggression 'which 'would probably terminate in connecting him r with' one or other of tliose authentic powers. In any 1 case, he stood committed to a course of conti¬ nued offence 'upon the Imperial interests; since in that quarter his injuries and insults were already 'past forgiveness. ' The interest of Holkerstein, then,' ran in the 1 same channel ivith that of the
Landgrave. It was impohtic to weaken him. It ivas doubly impolitic to weaken him by a measure which must also weaken tho Landgrave; for any deduction from his own military force, or from the means of recruiting it, was iu that proportion a voluntary sacrifice of the weight he shodd obtain with the Swedes on making the junction, which he now firmly counted on, with their forces. But a result which ho still more dreaded from the co-ope¬ ration of the Klostci'hoimcrs with the caravan from Vienna, was the probable overthrow of that supre¬ macy in the city, which even now was so nicely balanced in his favour, that a slight reinforcement to the other side ivould tuvn tbe scale against him. In all these calculations of policy, and the cruel measures by which he supported them, he was guided by the counsels of Luigi Adorni—u subtle Italian, whom He had elevated from the post of a private secretary to that of solo minister for the conduct of state affairs. This man, who covered a tempera¬ ment of terrific violence with a masque of Venetian dissimulation and the most icy reserve, met with no opposition, unless it were occasionally from Father Ansdm, the confessor. He delighted in the
refinements of intrigue, and in the most tortuous labyrinths of poHtical manoeuvring, purely for their own sakes; and sometimes defeated his own pur¬ poses by mere superfluity of diplomatic 6ubtloty; which hardly, however, won a momentary concern from him in the pleasure he experienced at having found an undeniable occasion for equal subtlety in unweaving liis own webs of deception. He had heen confounded by tho evasion of Maximilian and his friends from the orders of the Landgrave j nnd the whole energy of his nature nas bent to the dis¬ covery of the secret avenues which had opened the means to this elopement. There wero,-in those days, as is weU known to German antiquaries, few castles or fortresses of much importance in Germany, which did not com¬ municate by subterraneous passages with the exte¬ rior'country.' In many instances these passages were of surprising extent, first emerging to the Hght in Borne secluded spot among rocks or woods, at the distance of two, three, or even four mUes. There were cases even in which they were carried below the beds of rivers as broad and deep as the Rhino, the Elbe, or the Daaube. Sometimes there were several of such communications on different
faces of the fortress; and sometimes each of, .these, branched, at some distance from tb.e, building, intp| separate arms, opening at .intervals, widely, apart.' And the uses of such secret communications with the world outside, and beyond a besieging .enemy, in a land like Germany, ivith its prodigious snbdi-, vision of independent states and free cities, were far' greater than they could have been in any one great t continuous principality. In many fortified places these passages had existed i from the middle ages. In Klosterheim they had possibly as early an origin; but by this period it is very probable that the gradual accumulation of rub-, bish, through a course of centuries, would have unfitted them for use, had not the Peasants' War,s in the time of Luther's reformation, little more , than one hundred years before, given occasion for , their use and repair. At that time Klosterheim had, stood a siege, which, from the defect of artillery, was at no time formidable in a military sense; but as a blockade, formed suddenly when the citizens were slendeily furnished ivith provisions, it would'f certainly have succeeded, and delivered up the vast' wealth of the convents as a spoil to the peasantry*' bad it not been for one in particular of these sub-
terraneous passages, which opening on the opposite side of the Httle river Iltiss, in a thick boccage, where the enemy had estabHshed no posts, furnished the means of introducing a continual supply of fresh provisions, to the great triumph of the garrison, and the utter dismay of the superstitious peasants, who looked upon the mysterious supply as a provi¬ dential bounty to a consecrated cause. So memorable a benefit had given to this one passage a pubhcity and an historical importance which made all its circumstances, and amongst those its internal mouth, familiar even to chUdren. But this was evidently not the avenue by which Maxi¬ miHan Had escaped into the forest. For it opened externaUy on the ivrong side of the river, whilst every body knew that its domestic opening was in one of the chapels of the schloss ,* and another cir¬ cumstance equaUy decisive was, that a long flight of stairs, by which it descended below the bed of the river, made it impassable to horses. Every attempt, however, faded to trace out the mode of egress for the present. By his spies, Adorni doubted not to find it soon ; and in the meantime, that as much as possible the attention of the pubHc might be abstracted from the traveUers and their
concerns, a public proclamation was issued forbid¬ ding all resorts of crowds to the woUs. These were every where dispersed on the 9th; and for that day were pnrtiaUy obeyed. But there was little chance that, with any fresh excitement to the po¬ pular interest, they would continue to command respect.
CHAPTER VI. The morning of the 10th at length arrived—-that day on which tho expected travellers from Vienna, and all whom they had collected on their pro¬ gress, ardently looked to rejoin their long separated friends in Klosterheim, and by those friends were not less ardently looked for. On each side there were the same violent yearnings, on each side the some dismal and overpowering fears. Each party arose with palpitating hearts : the one looked out from Falkenberg ivith longing eyes to discover tho towers of Klosterheim; the other, from the upper windows or roofs of Klosterheim, seemed as if they could consume the distance between themselves and Falkenberg. »But a little' tract of forest ground was interposed between friends and friends, parents and children, lovers and their beloved. Not more than eighteen miles of shadowy woods, of lawns, and silvan glades, divided hearts that would either have
encountered death or many deaths for the other. These wero regions of natural peace and tranquil¬ lity, that in any ordinary times should have been peopled by no worse inhabitants than the timid hare scudding homewards to its form, or the wild deer sweeping by with thunder to their distant lairs. But now from every glen or thicket armed maraud¬ ers might be ready to start. Every gleam of sun¬ shine in some seasons was reflected from the gHt¬ tering arms of parties threading the intricacies of the thickets ; and the sudden alarum of the trumpet rang oftentimes in the nights, and awoke the echoes that for centuries had been undisturbed except by the hunter's horn, in the most sequestered haunts of these vast woods. Towards noon it became known, by signals that had been previously concerted between Maximilian and his coUege friends, that the party were advanced upon their road from i Falkenberg, and. therefore must of necessity on this day abide the final trial. As this news .was dispersed abroad, the 'public anxiety rose to so feverish a point, that' crowds rushed from every quarter to the walls; and it .was not judged prudent to measure the civic strength against their enthusiasm. For an hour or two the
nature of tho ground nnd tho woods forbade any view of the advancing party: but at length, some time before the light failed, the head of the column, and soon after the entiro body, was descried sur¬ mounting a little 'hill not more than eight miles .distant. The black mass, presented by mounted tra¬ vellers and baggage waggons, was visiblo to piercing- eyes : and the dullest could distinguish the glancing of arms which at times flashed upwards frnm the more open parts of the forest. Thus far, 'then, their friends had'made their nay without injury : and this point was judged to be within nine miles distance. But in thirty or forty minutesjiwhen they had come nearer by a mile and a half, the scene had somewhat changed.! A heathy tract of ground, perhaps two miles in length, opened in the' centre of the thickest- ivoods, and formed a little island of clear ground where all beside was tangled and .crowded'with impediments. 'Just as the travelling (party .began'to deploy'out'of the ivoods upouithis.area at its further extremity, a consider¬ able .body of mountedwtroops 'emerged from the forest, wliich had hitherto concealed'them, at the point nearest,to Klosterheim.- They made way rapidly ; and in less than half a minute it became
evident, by the motions of the opposite perty, that they had been descried, and that hasty preparations were malting for receiving them.' A dusky mass, probably the Black Yagers, galloped up rapidly to the front and formed: after which it seemed to somc eyes that the whole party again advanced, but still more slovly than before. Every heart upon tho walls of Klosterheim palpi¬ tated with emotion, as the two parties neared each other. Many almost feared to draw their breath, many writhed their persons in the anguish' of rueful expectation, as they saw the moment approach when the two parties would shock together. At length it came ; and to the astonishment of the spectators, not moro perhaps than of the travellers themselves, the whole cavalcade of strangers! swept by, without halting for so much as a passing salute or exchange of news. . ! ' m ' i i The first cloud, then, which had menaced their friends was passed off as suddenly as it had gathered. But this by some i people twas thought' to bear no favourable construction. >To ride past a band of tra¬ vellers from remote parts on Buch uncourteous terms argued no friendly spirit i and many motives might be imagined perfectly consistent with, hostile jnten-
tions for passing- the travellers unaosoiled, and'thus gaining the means of coming at any time upon their rearms Prudent persons'shook their heads rand the issue'of an*affair anticipated with so much'anxiety certainly*did'not diminish'it. ,J < « .

' ' ' 5 ,J •" <■ "' Soon after this, and just before the daylight faded, the travellers reached the nearer end'of the 'heath, and again "entered' the Hvoods." The cold and the darkness were now' becoming! greateriat every in¬ stant, and it might have 'been 'expected that the great moss of the spectators would'leave their sta¬ tion ; but such was the'intensity of the .public inte¬ rest, 'that'few quitted the'walls'except 8 for the pur¬ pose ofreinforciog*their v ability>to''stay''and watch theprogress of their 'friends. " Tin's- cotild >be • done with even greater effect as the'darkness deepened,
for every second horseman carried a torch; and a«i much perhaps by way of signal to their friends in, Klosterheim, as for their own couyenience,i prodU gious flambeaux were borne aloft on halberds. 'These ros^s to a height wliich surmounted all the lower. bushes, and were visible in all parts of the woods,— even the smaUer Hghts, in the leafless state of the trees at this season of the year, could be, generally traced without difficulty; and composing a brilHant chain of gHttering points, as it curved and humoured the road amongst the labyrinths of the forest, would have produced a singularly striking .effect to eyes at leisure to enjoy it. Jj,, i , , i > 1 In tlus way, for about three hours, the traveUers continued to advance unmolested, and to be tracedby their friends in Klosterheim. It was'now consider¬ ably after seven o'clock, and perhaps an hour, or at most an hour and a half, would bring them to the city gates. All hearts began to beat high with ex¬ pectation, and hopes were, loudly and (confidently expressed through every port of the crowd that the danger might now be considered as past, s Suddenly as if expressly to rebuke the too presumptuous con fidence of .those who were thus thoughtlessly san¬ guine, the blare of a trumpet was heard.from a diffe-
G
rent quarter of the forest, and about two miles to the right of the city. > Every eye was fastened eagerly upon the spot from which the notes issued. Pro- bably the signal had proceeded from a small party in advance of a greater; for in the same direction, but at a much greater distance, perhaps not less than three miles in the rear of the trumpet, a very large' body of horse was now descried coming on at a great pace upon the line already indicated by the trumpet. The extent of the column might be estimated by the long array of torches, which were carried apparently by every fourth or fifth .man; and that they were horsemen, was manifest from the very rapid pace at which they advanced. At this spectacle a cry of consternation ran along the whole walls of Klosterheim. Here then at last were coming the spoilers and butchers of their friends; for the road upon which they were advan- cing issued at right angles into that upon which the travellers,' apparently unwarned of their danger, were moving. The hideous scene of carnage would possibly pass immediately below their own eyes; for the point of junction between the two roads v/as directly commanded by the eye from tho city walls; and upon computing the apparent proportions of
speed between the two parties, it seemed Hkely enough that upon this very ground, the best fitted of any that could have been selected, in a scenical sense, as a stage for'bringing a spectacle below the eyes of Klosterheim, the most agitating of specta¬ cles would be exhibited,—friends and'kinsmen en¬ gaged in mortal struggle with remorseless free¬ booters, under circumstances which denied to them¬ selves any chance of offering assistance. Exactly at this point of time arose a dense mist, which wrapped the ivhole forest in darkness, and withdrew from the eyes of the agitated Kloster¬ heimers friends and foes aHke. They continued, however, to occupy the walls, endeavouring to pene¬ trate tho veil which now concealed the fortunes of their travelling friends, by mere energy and inten¬ sity of attention. The mist meantime did not dis¬ perse, but rather continued to deepen; the two parties, however, graduaUy drew so much nearer, that some judgment coidd be at length formed of their motions and position merely by the ear. From the stationary character of the sounds, and the con¬ tinued recurrence of charges and retreats sounded upon the trumpet, it became evident that the tra¬ veUers and the enemy had at length met, and too

The most hopeful began to despond; andi general lamentations prevaUed throughout'Klosterheim ju , Suddenly, however, a 1 dull isound arose ivithin.a quarter iof a mile from the city gate,'as oft some feeble attempt to blow a blastiupoma trumpet. nln five minutes more a louder blast»was,Boundediclose to the gate.

The spectacle was hideous, whioh the long caval¬ cade exhibited jasdt iivbundfup i tliei steep streets which ledto the'market-place. .-Waggons fractured and (Splintered urn eveiy (direction,? upon whichiwere stretched numbers ofigaUant soldiers,: with wounds hastily dressed,'from which;the,blood had.ppured in : streams uponltheirlgay. habiHments';'horses,uwhose ,Hmbs.had been mangled by theuSabre ,*i and coaches or calecliea loadedivithbm'thens/ofi dead and dying; these ,were amongstjthe objects,whichtoccupiod the ,van in the Une of march, as the traveUers defiled
through Klosterheim. The vast variety of faces, dresses, implements of war, or ensigns of rank, thrown together in the confusion of night and re¬ treat, Uluminated at intervds by bright streams of light from torches or caiidles in the streets, or at the windows of the Houses, composed a picture which resembled the chaos of a dream, rather than any ordinary spcctade of human Hfe. In the market-place the whole party were gradu¬ aUy assembled, and there it was intended that they shodd recdve the billets for their several quarters. But such was the pressure of friends and relatives gathering from dl directions, to salute and welcome tbe objects of thdr affectionate^ anxiety, or to en¬ quire after their fate; so tumultuous was the con¬ flict of grief and joy (and not seldom in the very same group), that for a long time no authority codd control the violence of pubHc feelmg, or enforce the arrangements which had been adopted for the night. Nor was it even easy to learn, where tho questions were put by so many voices at once, what had been the history of the night. It was at length, however, coUected, that they had been met and attacked with great fury by Holkerstein, or a party acting under bne of His Heutenants. Their own march had been,
so warily conducted after nightfaU, that this attack did not find them unprepared. A barrier of coaches and waggons had been speedUy formed in such an arrangement as to cripple the enemy's movements, and to neutraHze great part of his superiority in the quaHty of his horses. The engagement, however, had been severe; and the enemy's attack, though many times Haffled, had been as often renewed, until at length, the young general MaximiHan, seeing that the affair tended to no apparent termination, that the bloodshed was great, and that the horses were beginning to knock up under the fatigue of such severe service, had brought up the very elite of his reserve, placed liimself at their head, and making a dash expressly at their leader, had the good fortune to cut him down. The d?sperateness of the charge, added to the loss of their leader, had intimidated the enemy, who now began to draw off as from an enter¬ prise which waa Hkely to cost them more bloo'd than •a final success could have rewarded. Unfortunately, however, MaxhniHan, disabled by a severe wound, and entangled by his horse amongBt the enemy, had been carried off a prisoner. In the course of the battle aU their torches had been extinguished; and this circumstance, as much as the roughness of the
road, the ruinous condition of their carriages and appointments, and their own exhaustion, had occa¬ sioned their long delay in reaching Klosterheim, after the battle was at an end. Signals they had not ventured to make; for they were naturally afrdd of drawing upon their track any fresh party of mau- rauders by so open ! a warning'of their course as the sound of a trumpet.

'"iiiini it ,■ hi ii.in .-. : The city of Klosterheim. was,now,,abandoned to itself, andstrictlyishut.up within i1;s,own,wa^l,s.^All roaming/beyond, those limitS[.was now indeed,for¬ bidden even mpre,effectually by,the s^prd,pf ,^he enemy than by the edicts of the Landgrave. War^vfis manifestly, gathering,in its ; neighbourhood,, / Little toM'ns and castles within a range, of seyeuty .miles, on almost: every,side,, were now daily; occupied by Imperial or.-S>vedish ,troops. ; ,, Not,a week, passed without some news.of fresh military, accessions, or of slui-mishes between parties of .hostile fpragers. Through .the, whole-.adjacent .country, spite, of the severe weather, bodies of armed imen were, weaving- to and fro, fast as a weaver's shuttle. The forest rang with alarums, and sometimes under gleams of sunshine, the leafless woods seemed on fire with the restless splendour of spear and sword, morion and
breast-plate, or the gHttering equipments of the Imperial cavalry. Couriers, or Bohemian gipsies, which latter were a class of people at this time employed by all sides as spies c* messengers, con- tinuaHy stole in ivith secret despatches to the Land¬ grave, or (under the colour of bringing pubHc news, and the reports of miHtary movements) to execute some private mission for rich employers in town; sometimes making even this clandestine business but a cover to other purposes, too nearly connected with treason, or reputed treason, to admit of any but oral communication. r 'What were the ulterior views in this large accu¬ mulation of miHtary force, no man pretended to know. A great battle, lor various reaeons, wns not expected. But changes were so sudden, and the counsels of each day so often depended on the acci¬ dents of the morning', tbat an entire campaign might easily be brought on, or the whole burthen of war for years to come might be transferred to this quar¬ ter of the land, without causing' any Yery great surprise. Meantime, enough was done already to give a full'foretaste of war and its miseries to this sequestered nook—so long unvisited by that hideous scourge.
In the forest, where the inhabitants were none, excepting those who Hved upon the borders, and smaU estabHshments of the Landgrave's servants at different points, for executing the duties of the forest or the chase, this change expressed itself chiefly by the tumultuous uproar of the wUd deer, upon whom a murderous war was kept up by parties detached daUy from remote and opposite quarters to coUect provisions for the half-starving garrisons, so recently, and with so Httle previous preparation, multipHed on the forest skirts. For though the country had been yet unexhausted by war, too large a proportion of the tracts adjacent to the garrisons were in a wild silvan condition, to afford any conti¬ nued suppHes to so large and sudden an increase of the population; more especioUyas, under the rumours of this change, every waUed toivn in a compass of one hundred miles, many of them capable of resist¬ ing a sudden coup-de-main, and resolutely closing their gates upon either party, had already possessed themselves by purchase of aU the surplus supplies which the country yielded. In such a state of things, the wUd deer became an object of vduable consider¬ ation to aU parties, and a murderous war was made upon them from every side of the forest. From the
city walls they were' seen in sweeping droves, flying before the Swedish < cavalry for a course of ten, fifteen, or even thirty miles, until headed, and com¬ pelled to >turn by another party breaking buddenly from aicovert'whcreithey had been waiting their approach* i Sometimes! it would happen that this second .party proved to be a body of Imperialists, whonwere carried by the ardour of the chase into thei very centre iof their enemies before either was aware of any hostile approach. Then, according to circumstances, came isuddeni flight or tumultuary skirmish; the woods rang with the hasty summons of the trumpet;, the deer reeled off aslant from the furious ishock, and. benefiting for ithe moment by those fierce (hostilities, originally the cause of their persecution, fled iar away from'the scene of stiife; and not .unfrequently came thundering! beneath the city walls,-andireporting toithe spectators above, by their agitation and affrighted eyes, those tumultuous disturbances. an I sopae j remoter part ■ tof ,the forest, ivhichihad,already! reached)them.in an imperfect way, by theiinterrupljed and^ourring echoes of the points of war—charges, or retreats—sounded upon the trumpet. ."u > -ut s. r ,, 'But, whilst'on the outside of her walls Kloster-

preponderant party in the neighbourhood; they had fortified the chateau of Falkenberg, and made it a very strong miHtary post; at the same time, how¬ ever, sending in" to Klosterhdm whatsoever was vduable amongst the furniture of that estabUsh- ment, with a care which of itself proclaimed the footing upon which they were anxious to stand ivith the Landgravei * Encouraged by the vicinity of his miHtary friends, that Prince now began to take a Harsher tone in Klosterheim. The minor Princes of Germany at that day were aU tyrants in virtue of their privi¬ leges ; and if in some rarer cases ihey exercised these privileges in a forbearing spirit, their subjects were weU aware that they were indebted for this extraordinary indulgence to the temper and gracious nature of the individud, not to the firm protection of the laws. But the most reasonable and mildest of the German Princes had been Httle taught at that day to brook opposition. And the Landgrave was by nature, and the gloominess of his constitutiond temperament, of dl men the last to learn that lesson readily. He had already met with just sufficient opposition from the civic body and the university interest to excite his passion for revenge. Ample
indemnification he determined upon for his wounded pride; and he believed that the time and circum¬ stances were now matured for favouring his most vindictive schemes. Tho Swedes were at hand; and a sh'ght struggle with the citizens would remove aU obstacles to their admission into the garrison; though, for some private reasons', he wished to abstain from this extremity, if it should prove pos¬ sible. MaximiHan also was absent, and might never return. The rumour was even that he was killed; and though the caution of Adorni and the Land¬ grave led them to a hesitating reHancc upon what might be a poHtical fabrication of the opposite party, yet at aU events he was detained from Klosterheim by some pressing necessity; and the period of his absence, whether long or short, the Landgrave resolved to improve in such a way as should make his return unavaiHng. Of MaximiHan the Landgrave had no personal knowledge; he had not so much as seen him. But by his spies and intdUgencers he was weU aware that he had been the chief combiner and animater of the Imperial party against himself in the univer¬ sity, and by his presence had given Hfe and confi¬ dence to that party in the dty which dlt* not ex-
piessly acknowledge him as tlieir Head. He was aware oftlje favour which MaximiHan enjoyed with, the Emperor, and knew in general, from public report, tho brUHancy of those military services on which it had been buUt. That he was Hkely to prove a formidable opponent, had He continued ia Klosterhdm, the Landgrave knew too weU; and upon the advantage over him which he had now gained, though otherwise it shodd prove only a temporary one, he determined to found a permanent obstncle to the Emperor's views. As a preHminary stop, he prepared to crush dl opposition in Kloster¬ heim; a purpose.which was equdly important to his vengeance and His policy. This system he opened with a series of tyranni¬ cal regulations, somc of which gave the more offence that they seemed whoUy capricious and insulting. The students were confined to their coUege bounds, except at stated intervals; were subject to a miH¬ tary muster, or calling over of names, every even¬ ing; were required to receive sentinels within the extensive courts of their own coUege, and at length a smaU court of guard; ivith numerous other occa¬ siond marks, as opportunities offered, of princely discountenance and anger. , ?
In the university, at that time, from locd causes, many young men of rank and family were coUected. Those even, who had taken no previous part in the cause of the Klosterheimers, were now roused to a sense of persond indignity. And as soon as the Hght was departed, a large body of'them coUected at the rooms of Count St Aldenheim, whose rank promised a suitable countenance to their purpose, whilst his youth seemed a pledge for the reqmsite activity. > < i ! ' ' The Count was a younger brotherof the Palsgrave of Birkenfeld, and maintdned a sumptuous estabHsh- ment in Klosterheim. Whilst the state^of the forest had allowed of hunting, hawking, or other amuse¬ ments, no man had exhibited so fine a stud of horses. No man had so large a-train observants; no man entertained his friends with such magnificent hos- pitaHties. His generosity, his splendour, his fine person, and the courtesy ivith which he reHeved the' humblest people from'the oppression *of His rank, had given 'him a popularity amongst the students.

And, so saying, he hastily rushed after the party, whom he found already on the steps of the portico. Seiz¬ ing the hand of the leader, he whispered,— " Friend I do you know me so little, as to appre¬ hend my jesting in a serious sense ? Know that two of those, whom you saw on my right hand, are

[ Much, stormy discussion arose upon,two,points,;>fir^t, () uppn the ( particular means by, whicH f they, were. ,to, pw;^ue,, ap, ( end /upon. which iall were .unanimous* lUpQn, ,tHat,,,hqwever, they were able for the present,'to, .arrive at a preH- miiiary, arrangement ivith sufHden^t Harinony.. ( This was, to repair, ini a. body, with,, Count St, Aldenheim' at their head, to the castle, and there to demand an andience of the Landgrave, at which a strong remon¬ strance was to be laid before his highness, and their determination avowed to repel the indignities thrust upon them, with their united forces. On the second they were more at variance. It happened that many of the persons present, and amongst them Count Sfc Aldenheim, were friends of MaximiHan. A few, on; the other hand, therewere,who, either from jealousy
of his distinguished merit, hated him; or as good citizens of Klosterheim, and connected by old family ties with the interests of that town, were disposed to charge Maximilian with ambitious views of pri¬ vate aggrandizement at the expense of the city, grounded upon .the Emperor's favour, or upon a supposed marriage with some lady of the Imperial house. For the story of Paulina's and Maximilian's mutual attachment had transpired through many of the travellers; but with some circumstances of fic¬ tion. In defending Maximilian upon those charges, his friends had betrayed a natural warmth at the injustice offered to his character; and the liveliness of the dispute on this point, had nearly ended in a way fatal to their unanimity on the immediate ques¬ tion at issue. Good sense, however, and indignation at the Landgrave, finally .brought them round again to their first resolution; and they separated ivith the unanimous intention of meeting at noon on the following day, for the purpose of carrying' it into effect. But their unanimity on this point was of little avail; for ot an early hour on the following 1 morn¬ ing, every one of those who had been present at the meeting, was arrested by a file of soldiers on a charge
of conspiracy, and marched off to one of the city prisons. The Count St Aldenheim was himself the sole exception; and this was a distinction odious to his generous nature, as it drew upon him a cloud of suspicion. He was sensible that he would be sup¬ posed to owe his privilege to some discovery or net of treachery, more or less, by which he had merited the favour of the Landgrave. The fact was, that in the indulgence shewn to the Count, no motiye had influenced the Landgrave but a politic consideration of the great favour and influence which the Count's brother, the Palsgrave, at this moment enjoyed in the camp of his own Swedish allies. On this prin¬ ciple of policy, the Landgrave contented himself ivith placing St Aldenheim under a slight military confinement to his own house, under the guard of a few sentinels posted in his hall. - i For him, therefore, under the powerful protection which he enjoyed elsewhere, there was no great anxiety entertained. But for the rest, many of whom had no friends, or friends who did them the ill ser¬ vice of enemies, being in fact regarded as enemies by the Landgrave and his council, serious fears were entertained by the whole city. Their situation was evidently critical. The Landgrave had them in his
power.' j He was notoriously a man of gloomy and malignant passions; 'had» been educated, as aU Euro¬ pean-princes themwere, dn tho notions of a plenary and despotic'right i over the lives of his subjects, in anp case where they'lifted their presumptuous thoughts >to the i height. of controlling the Sove¬ reign { andj even in circumstances which to his own judgment might'seem>to confer"much less discre- ti6naiyl power over ithe'rights of iprisoners, he had been^BUBpeotediof directing the course of law and of punishmerit'into channels that would not brook the public knowledge.'" Darker dealings were imputed to him'dn Jthe'popular opinions Gloomy suspicions »were muttered at the fireside,! which 'no man'dared openly ito avow;' 1 and-- in ithe present instance ithe 'conduct'-pf the Landgrave was every way fitted'to 'fall' in 'with* 4he l worst of'the ! public fears; Atone time 1 he talked ! of'bringing his^ prisoners to a trial; af'ttnothery'-hen countermanded > the' preparations which he'had'^made-Jwith thafc<view l .i- 'Sometimes l he spoke" l 6f banishing' them >iri >a 'body { and' again ! he 1 avowed-his'intention 1 to»'deal with-their'crime 'as 1 treasolai *The>resiilt7'of thisimoody and'capricious tyranny'was 1 to inspire the most'Vague and 'gloomy apprehensions into the'minds of theJprisoners, and

In half an I hour the news ran over the town, and the university; multitudes has¬ tened to the.coUege, anxious to-congratulate.'the prisoners on their deHverance.from the,double afflic¬ tions ofi a> dungeon l and, of i continual .insecurity.

joyous uproar, when suddenly a file of the city guard> commanded by an officer, made their way rudely and violently through the crowd, advancing evident¬ ly to the spot where the Hberated prisoners were coUected in a group. At that moment the Count St Aldenheim was offering His congratulations. The frisnds to whom he spoke, were too confident in his honour and integrity to have felt even one moment's misgiving upon the true causes which had sheltered him from the Landgrave's wrath, and had thus given him a privflege so invidious in the oyes of those who knew him not, and on'that account so hateful in his own; 1 They knew his unimpeachable fideHty to the cause and themselves, and were anxiously expressing theii' sense of it by the warmth of their salutations at the very moment when the city guard appeared. The Count, on his part, was gaily reminding them to come that evening and fulfil their engagement to drink his aunt Pf jovial memory in her own Johannisberg, when the guard, shoulder¬ ing aside the crowd, advanced, and, surrounding the group'of students, in an instant laid the hands of summary arrest' each upon the gentleman who stood next him. The petty officer who commanded, made a grasp at one of the most distinguished in
dress, and seized rudely upon the gold chain depend¬ ing from his neck. St Aldenheim, who happened at the moment to be in conversation with this indi¬ vidud, stung with a sudden indignation at the ruffian eagerness of the men in thus abusing the privUeges of their office, and unable to control the generous ardour of his nature, met this brutal outrage with a sudden blow at the officer's face, leveUed with so true an dm, that it stretched him at his length upon the ground. No terrors of impending vengeance, had they been a thousand times stronger than they were, could at this moment have avdled to stifle the cry of triumpbiuit pleasure—long, loud, and unfaltering—whicli indignant sympathy with the oppressed extorted from the crowd. The pdn and humiUation of the blow, exdted into a maddening intensity by this popdar shout of exultation, quick¬ ened the officer's rage into an apparent frenzy. With white Hps, and hdf suffocated with the sudden re¬ vulsion of passion, natural enough to one who had never before encountered even a momentary over¬ ture at opposition to the authority with which be was armed, and for the first tune in his Hfe found his own brutoHties thrown back resolutely in his teeth, the man rose, and by signs rather than the
inorticiUate sounds which he meant fo? words, point- «d'ithe J tviolenco'of 1 his'party upon the'Count St Alde'nhdm.^' , With , hdberds'bristling around him, the'gaUtfnt T 'youWg nobleman wos loudly summoned to surrender ji but'he protested indignantly^ drawing his'sword and'placing'himself in an attitude of de¬ fence, thdt he would die ft thousand deaths sooner thah feurrenderthe swordof His father, the 1 Palsgrave, a'Pririce'bfithe'EmpireJiof unspotted honour, and mosfancierit' descent, iinto|tho hands of & jailor.

Sometimes, even,.thoy|ivefeactuaUy detect¬ ed, claimed, and giveniup to i tho pursuit of justice, when it happened that the subjects of their criminal acts were weighty enough to sustdn an i energetic enqmry. Hence their reputation became worse than scandalous : ithe' 'mingled linfamyt of.their calling, nnd the Houseless,condition of wretchedness.which had made it worth thdr acceptance, 'combined to overwhdm them wiihipubHo scorn ;>and this (pub¬ lic .abhorrence, which at any^rate* awaited them, mere desperation led them too often to countenance and justify by fthdr conduct, in i ,' ' l . i < o "Captain of jailersji dot your worst, .1 say," again ejucdated St Aldenheim. ..Spite of his- Wind¬ ing passion, the officer hesitated to-precipitate Him¬ self into .a persond struggle with the, Count, and thus perhaps afford his antagonist an occasion for
a further triumph. But loudly and fiercely he urged on his followers to attack Him. These agdn, not partaking in the persond wrath of their leader, even ,■ whilst, pressing more and more closely upon St Aldenhdm, and caUing .upon him to surrender, scrupled ;to inflict a wound, or too marked an out¬ rage,,, upon a cavaHer whose rank was known to the whole city, and of late most advantageously known for his, own interests, by the conspicuous immunity wliich it had procured him from the Landgrave. In yain did the commanding-officer insist, in vain did the Count defy,—menaces from neither side avdlecl to urge the guard into any outrage upon the person of one who might have it in his power to retaHate so severely upon themselves. They continued obsti¬ nately at a t stand, simply preventing his escape, when suddedy the tread of horses' feet arose upon the ear, and through a long vista were discovered a body of cavalry from, the castl? coming up at a charging pace to the main entrance of, the coUege. Without jiuUing up on the outside, as hitherto they Had dways done, they expressed sufficiently the altered tone of the Landgrave's feeHngs towards the old chartered inteiesth of Klosterheim, by plunging through the great archway of the coUege-gates;
md then making way at the same furious pace through the assembled crowds, who broke i rapidly iway tp the right and to the left, they reined up lirectly abreast of the city guard and their prisoners. " Colonel Von Aremberg 1" said St Aldenheim, !< I perceive your errand. To a soldier I surrender myself; to this tyrant of dungeons, who has betray* ed more men^ and cheated more gibbets of their due than ever he said aves, I will never lend an ear, though he should bear the orders of every Land¬ grave in Germany." . ■ • " You do well," replied the Colonel; " but for this man, Count, he bears,no orders from any Land¬ grave, nor will ever again bear. orders from the Landgrave of X ----- . Gentlemen, you are all my prisoners; and you will accompany me to the castle. Count St Aldenheim, I am sorry that there is no longer an exemption for yourself. Please to advance. If it will be any gratification to you, these men" (pointing to the city guard) " are prisoners also."; Here was a revolution of fortune that confounded eveiy body. - The detested guardians of the city jail were themselves to tenant it; or, by a worse fate sti|I, were to be consigned unpitied, and, their case
.
unjudged, to the dark and pestilent dungeons whicb lay below the Landgrave's castle. .A few scattered cries of triumph were heard from the crowd; but they were ,drowned in a tumdt of conflicting feel¬ ings. As Human creatures, fdlen under the dis¬ pleasure of a despot with a judicial power of torture to enforce His investigations, even ihey cldmed some compassioli. But there arose, to cnU off attention from these loss dignified objects of the pubHc inte¬ rest, a long train of gaUant' cavaHers, restored so capriciously to Hberty, in order, as it seemed, to give the greater poignancy and bitterness to the instant renewal of their captivity. .This was the very frenzy of despotism in its very moodiest state of excite¬ ment. Many began to think the Landgrave mad. If so, what a drcadfid fate might be anticipated for the sons or representatives of so many noble famiHes, gaUant soldiers the greater part of them, with a nobleman of princely blood at then-head, lying under the displeasure of a 'gloomy and infuriated tyrant, with unHmited means of executing the bloodiest suggestions of his vengeance. ' Then, in what way had the guardians oi the jails come to be connected with any even imaginary offence ? Supposing the
Landgrave insane, his agents were'not so; Colonel Ven Aremberg was a man of shrewd and penetrating understanding; and this'officer liad'dearly spoken in the tone of one, who, whilst announdngthe sen¬ tence of another, 'sympathizes entirely with the justice and necessity of its harshness. 1 ' ■" "i 1 ' 1 ' Something dropped from the miserable leader of the city guard, 1 in his first confusion and attempt at self-defence, which rather increased than expldned the mystery. "The Masque I the Masque'!" This was the word which fell at intervds upon the ear'of the Hstening crowd, as he sometimes' directed his words in the way of apology and deprecation to Colonel Von Aremberg, • who did not'vouchsafe to Hstcn, or of occasiond 'explanation and discussion, as it was partiaUy kept up between himself and one of his nearest partners in the imputed transgression. Two or three there might be seen in the crowd, whose looks avowed somo nearer acqudntance with this mysterious'dlusion than-it would have been safe to acknowledge. jButi for the great body *of spectators who accompanied the prisoners and their escort to the gatesiof theicastle,"it was pretty evi¬ dent by their enquiring looks, and the fixed expres-
sion of wonder upon their features, that the ivhole affair, and its circumstances, were to them equaUy a subject of mystery for what was past, and of bHnd terror for what was to come.
CHAPTER IX. The cavdcade, with its charge of prisoners, and its attendant train of spectators, bdted at the g'ates of the schloss. This vast and antique pUe Had now come to be surveyed with dismd and revolting feel¬ ings, as the abode of a sangmnary despot. The dungeons and labyrinths of its tortuous passages, its gloomy balls of audience, with the vast corridors which surmounted the innumerable flights of stdrs —some noble, spacious, and in the Venetian taste, capable of admitting the march of an army—some spiral, steep, and so unusuaUy narrow as to exclude two persons walking abreast; these, together with the numerous chapels erected in it to different sdnts by devotees, male or femde, in the famiHes of for¬ gotten Landgraves through four centuries back; and finaUy the tribunals, or gericht-kammern, for dispensmg justice, crimind or civil, to the city and territorid dependencies of Klosterheim;—all
united'to 1 compose-a 'body'of impressive images, haUoWed-by'great historical 1 remembrances, or tra¬ ditional' stories^that from infancy to age dwelt upon the ^feehngs-of the Klosterheimers. Terror and superstitious dread predominated undoubtedly in the total f impression; but the gentle virtues exhibited by a series of princes, who had made this their fa¬ vourite residence,' naturaUy enough terminated in mellowing the sternness of such associations into a reUgious- awe, -not*without its own^pecuKar attrac- tions.i'' But atipresent,' under the harsh and repulsive character' of'the reigning Prince, every thing took a new colour from his ungenial habits. The super- stitioufl-legfends, which had so immemoriaUy peopled the schloss* with!spectral'apparitions, now revived in its earHest 'Strength.' Never was Germany more dedicated to superstition in every shape than at this period." The wild tumultuous times, and the sHght tenure-upon which'aU men held their Hves, natu¬ raUy threw) their thoughts much upon the other world; and communications with that, or its burthen of secrets,' by every variety of agencies, ghosts, divino- tion^natural magic,- palmistry, or astrology, found in every city of the land more encouragement than ever. It cannot^ therefore, be surprising that the weU-
f nown apparition of the White Lady (alegend which tffected Klosterheim through,the (fortunes 1 of,its Landgraves, no less than several, othert princely aouses of Germany, descended from .the same'origi¬ nal stock), should about this, time have been> seen tn the dusk of the evening at some of thei upper ivindows in the castle, and once in a lofty gaUery of the great chapel during the vesper service, t This lady, generally known by the name of. the .White Lady r Agnes, or Lady Agnes of' Weissemburg, is supposed to have Hved in the .13th or, l^th century, and from that time, even ito our. own days, 1 .the cur¬ rent beHef is, that onithe eve of anyigreat crisis of good or evil fortune,impending over .the ithree or four illustrious, houses of Germany whiebjtrace their origin from her, she makes her appearance iti some conspicuous apartment, great baronial hall or chapel, of their several palaces, [Sweeping along, in white robesanda voluminous,'train. . Hert appearance of late in the schloss of, Klosterheim, confidently:be- Heved by the great body of ithe people, ( was hailed ivith secret pleasure,vas forerunning, sopie-great change in the Landgrave's ■family,—which.was but another name,for,better,days to,themselves,/whilst of necessity it menaced some great evil to the Prince
himself.' Hope, therefore, was predominant in their ■.prospects,* and .in 1 .the' supernatural intimations of ccmingl changes;—yet awe and deep religious feeli ing^mingled''with-4heirnhope. > 'Of'*chastisement approaching 1 to-the' Landgrave theyifelt assured,— some dim religious judgment, like that which brood¬ ed over tha, house of)CEdipus, was now at hand,— > that twas the universal impression. >His gloomy asceticism of ""life (seemed to argue secret crimes,—. these were to be brought to h'ght;—for these,' and for his recent tyranny, prosperous os it had seemed for a moment, chastisements were now impending; and something- of the awe/tvhich belonged to a prince So marked out for doom and fatal catastrophe, seemed to attach itself to his mansion,—more especially, as it was there only that the signs and portents of the coming wo^ had revealed themselves in the'appari¬ tion of the White Lady.< . i< ' t - v Undet this superstitious i impression, many of the spectators paused at the entrance, ofi the castle, and lingered'ini the portal, 1 though'presuming that'the chamber of justice, according to theifrankoldiusago of Germany, was still opem to.allicomen?.. <Of this notion they were speedily disabused by the sudden retreat of the few who had penetrated into the first
mtechamber. ' These persons were harshly repeUed n a contumeHous manner, and readvo the astonished atizens another, lesson upon the new^orts of dark¬ less and concealment, with .which' the 'Landgrave Found it necessary to accompany his tnew acts > of ty¬ ranny. •', ',! "iljll •>.!(..t. ',' . .,, Von Aremberg and his prisoners, thus left alone in one of the antechambers, ^waited no'long time before they were summoned.to the presence of the Landgravo. " ' (<,!'< r . >• <\ m ,-, After pacing along a number, of corridors, aU carpeted so as to return no sound .to their footsteps, they arriyed in a little hall, from,which a door sud¬ denly opened, upon a noiseless 'signal exchanged ivith an usher outside, and displayed before'them a long gaUery,'with a table andia few.seats arranged at the iurther end. -Two gentlemen were seated at the table, anxiously examining, papers ; in one of whom it was easy -to recognise the' wUy glance of the ItaHan minister,'the other was the Landgrave. This Prince was, now< on the verge 'of fifty, stri¬ kingly -handsome!in his'features, and of imposing presence, from the uniomof a fine person with mam ners unusuaUy dignified. No man understood bettei the art of restraining his least governable impulse!
of anger or maHgnity within the decorums of his rank. And oven his worst passions, throwing a gloomy,'rather than terrific air upon his features, served less to alarm and revolt, than to impress the sense of secret distrust. . Of late indeed, from the too evident indications of tho pubHc hatred, his sal¬ lies of passion had become wilder and more ferocious, and liis &elf-command less habituaHy conspicuous. But in general, a gravity of insidious courtesy dis¬ guised from aU but penetrating eyes the treache¬ rous purpose of his heart. The Landgravo bowed to the Count St Alden¬ heim ; and, pointing to a chair, begged him to un¬ derstand that he wished to do nothing inconsistent with his regard for the Palsgrave his brother ; and would be content with his parole of honour to.pur- sue no further any conspiracy against himself, in which he might too thoughtlessly have engaged, and ivith his retirement from the city of Klosterheim. The Count St Aldenheim. replied, that he and aU the other cavaHers present, according -to his beHef, stood upon tha same footing: that they had harboured no thought, of conspiracy, unless that name could attach to a purpose' of open expostula¬ tion with his Highness on the outraged privileges
of their corporation as a university : that he wished not for any distinction of treatment in a case when aU were equd offenders, or none at aU: nnd finaUy, that he beHeved tho sentence of exUe from Kloster¬ heim would be cheerfuUy accepted by aU, or most of those present. Adorni, the minister, shook his head, and glanced significantly at the Landgrave during this answer. The Landgrave coldly repHed, that if he could sup¬ pose the Count to speak sincerely, it was evident that he was Httle aware to what length his com¬ panions, or some of them, had pushed their plots. " Here are the proofs 1" and he pointed 1 to the papers. " And now, gentlemen," sdd He, turning to the students, " I marvel that you, being cavaHers of fa- mUy, and doubtless holding yourselves nien'of ho¬ nour, shodd beguUe these poor knaves'into certain rdn, whilst yourselves could reap nothing but a brief mockery of the authority which you codd not hope to evade." ' ' f J Thus caUed upon, the students'and the city- guard told their tde ; in which no'contradictions could be detected. The city prison was not parti- cdarly weU secured agdnst attacks from without.
To prevent, therefore, any sudden attempt at a re- scuej the guard kept watch by turns. One man watched two hours, traversing the different passages of the prison ; and was then reHeved. At three o'clock on the preceding night, pacing a winding lobby, brightly iUuminated, the man who kept that watch was suddenly met by a person wearing a masque, and armed at dl points. His surprise and consternation were great, and the more so as the 6teps of The Masque were soundless, though the floor was a stone one. The guard, but sHghtly pre¬ pared to meet an attack, would, however, have re¬ sisted or raised an darm; but THe Masque instantly leveUing a pistol at his head with one hand, with the other had thrown open the door of an empty ceU, indicating to the man by signs that he must enter it. With this intimation he had necessarily compHed; and The Masque had immediately turned the key upon him. Of what foUowed he knew nothing, untU aroused by his comrades setting him at Hberty, after some time had been wasted in searching for him. The students had a pretty uniform tde to report. A Masque, armed cap-a-pie as described by the guard, had visited each of their cells in succession ;
had instructed them by signs to dress; and then, pointing to the door, by a series of directions all communicated in the same dumb show, had assem¬ bled them together, thrown open the prison door, and, pointing to their college, had motioned them thither. This motion they had seen no cause to disobey, presuming 1 their dismissal to be according to the mode whicli best pleased his Highness ; and not ill-pleased at finding go peaceful a termination to a summons which at first, from its mysterious shape and the solemn hour of night, they had un¬ derstood as tending to some more formidable issue. It was observed that neither the Landgrave nor his minister treated this report of so strange a trans¬ action with the scorn which had been anticipated. Both listened attentively, and made minute enqui¬ ries as to every circumstance of the dress and ap¬ pointments of the mysterious Masque. What was his height ? By ^ what road, or in what direction, had he disappeared ? These questions answered, his Highness and his minister consulted a few minutes together; and then, turning to Von Aremberg, bade him for the present dismiss the prisoners to their homes, an act of grace which seemed likely 5
to do him service at the present crisis ; but at the same time to take sufficient security for their re¬ appearance. This done, the whole body were Hbe¬ rated.
CHAPTER X. All Klosterheim was confounded by the story of the mysterious Masque. For the stoiy had been rapidly dispersed; and on the same day it was made knoivn in another shape. A notice was affixed to the waUs of several pubHc places in these words:— " Landgrave, beware I henceforth not you, but I, govern in Klosterheim. (Signed) " The Masque." And this was no empty threat. Very soon it became apparent that some mysterious agency was reaUy at work to counteract the Landgrave's de¬ signs. Sentinels were carried off from soHtary posts.. Guards even of a dozen men were sdently trepanned from their stations. By and by, other attacks were' made, even more alarming, upon domestic security. Was there a burgomaster amongst the citizens, who
had made himself conspicuously a tool of the Land- gravey or had opposed the Imperial interest ? He was carried off in the night-time from his house, and probably from the city. At first this was an easy task. Nobody apprehending any special danger to himself, no special preparations were made to meet it. But, as it soon became apparent in what cause The Masque was moving, every person who knew himself obnoxious to attack, took means to face it.' Guards were multipHed; > arms wero re¬ paired in every house ; l alarm'beUs were hung. For a tune the danger seemed to diminish. The attacks were no longer so frequent. StiU, wherever they were attempted, they succeeded just as before. It seamed, in fact, that all the precautions taken had no other effect than to warn The>Masque of his own danger, and to place him more vigilantly on his guard. Aware of new defences raising, it seemed that he waited to see the course they would take; once master of that, he was ready (as it appeared) to contend with them as successfully as before. Nothing could exceed the consternation of the eity. Those even, who did not fall-within the apparent rule which governed the attacks of The Masque, felt a sense of indefinite terror hanging over
them. Sleep was no longer safe ; the sedusion of a man's private hearth, the secrecy of bedrooms, was no longer a protection. Locks gave way, bars feU, doors flow open, as if by magic, before him. Arms seemed useless. In Borne instances a party of as many as ten or a dozen persons Had been re¬ moved without rousing disturbance in the neigh¬ bourhood. Nor was this the only circumstance of mystery. Whither he could remove his'victims, was even more incomprehensible than the means by which He succeeded. AU vvas darkness and fear; and the whole city was agitated with panic. It began now to be suggested that a nightly guard should be established, having fixed stations or points of rendezvous, ond at intervals parading the streets. This was cHeorfuUy assented to ; for, after the first week of the mysterious attacks, it began to be ob¬ served that the Imperial party were attacked indis¬ criminately with the Swedish. Many students pub¬ licly declared that they had been dogged through a street or two by an armed Masque; others had been -suddenly confronted by Him in unfrequented ports of the city in the dead of night, and were on the point of being attacked, when some alarm, or the ap¬ proach of distant footsteps, had caused him to dis- K
appear. ..The students, indeed, more particularly, seemed objects of attack; and, as they were pretty generaUy attached to the Imperial interest, the mo¬ tives of The Masque tvere no longer judged to be poHtical. Hence it happened that the students came forward in a body, and ^volunteered as members of -the nightly guard. Being young, military for the most part in their habits, and trained to support the hardships of night-watching, they seemed pecuHarly fitted for the service; and, as the case was no longer of a nature to awaken the.suspicions of the Land¬ grave, they were generaUy accepted and enrolled ; and with the more readiness, as the known friends of that Prince came fonvard at the same time. A night-watch was thus estabHshed, which pro¬ mised security to the city, and a respite from their mysterious alarms. It was distributed into eight or ten divisions, posted at different points, whilst a central one traversed the whole city at stated periods, and overlooked the local stations. Such an arrange¬ ment was wholly unknown at tbat time in every part of Germany, a^d was hailed with general applause. . To the astonishment, however, of every body, it proved wholly ineffectual. Houses were entered as
before; the coUege chambers proved no sanctuary; indeed, they were attacked with a peculiar obstinacy, which was understood to express a spirit of retalia¬ tion for the alacrity of the students in combining for the pubHc protection. People were carried off as before. And continual'notices affixed to the gates of the coUege, the convents, or the schloss, with the signature of The Masque, announced to the pubHc his determination to persist, and his contempt of the measures organized against him. > - The alarm of the citizens now became greater than ever. The danger was ono which courage could not face, nor prudence make provision for, nor wUyness evade. AU aUke, who Had once been marked out for attack, sooner or later fell victims to the obstinacy of this mysterious foe. • To have received even an individual warning,- availed them not at aU. Some¬ times it happened, that, having received notice of sus¬ picious circumstances indicating that The Masque had turned his attention' upon themselves, they /would assemble round their dweUings, or in their very chambers, a band of armed men sufficient to set the danger at defiance. But no sooner Had they relaxed in these costly and troublesome arrange¬ ments, no sooner was the sense of peril luUed;
imd an opening made for their unrelenting enemy, than He gHded in ivith his customary success; and in a morning or two after, it was announced to the city that they also were numbered ivith his victims. Even yet it seemed that something remained in reserve'to augment the terrors of the citizens, and push them to excess. Hitherto there had been no reaspn i to think that any murderous violence had occurred»in the mysterious rencontres between The Masque and His victims. But of Jato, in those houses, or coUege chambers, from which tho occupiers had disappeared, traces of bloodshed were apparent in some instances, and of ferocious conflict in others. Sometimes a profusion of hair was scattered on the ground;i sometimes fragments of dress, or splinters of weapons. Every thing marked that on both sides, as this mysterious agency advanced, the passions ' increased in intensity; determination and murderous maHgnity on the one side, and the fury of resistance on the other., , , ' , , At length the last consummation was given to the pubHc panic; for, as if expressly to put an end to aU doubts upon the spirit in which he conducted His warfare, in one House where the bloodshed had been so great as to argue some considerable loss of
life, a notice was left behind in the foUowing. terms : " Thus it is that I punish resistance ; mercy to a cheerful submission; but henceforth'death to the obstinate!— The MasqiW '• >' What was to be done ? Some counseUed a pubHc deprecation of his wrath, addressed to, Tlie Masque. But this, had it even offered any chance of succeed¬ ing, seemed too abject an act of abasement to become a large city- Under any circumstances, it was too humiUating a confession, that, in a struggle ivith one mau (for no more had avowedly appeared upon the scene), they were left; defeated and at 'his mercy. A second party counseUed a treaty; wodd it not be possible to learn the ultimate objects of The Masque; and, if such as seemed capable of being entertained with honour, to concede to him his demands,'in ex¬ change for security to the city, and immunity from future molestation ? It was true, that no man knew where to seek him : personaUy he was hidden from their reach; but every body knew How to find hira: he was amongst them; in their very centre; and whatever they 'might address to him in a public notice, would be sure of speedily reaching his eye. After some deliberation, a summons was addressed to The Masque, and exposed on the college gates,
demanding of him a declaration of his purposes, and tho price which he expected for suspending them. The next day an answer appeared in the same situ¬ ation, avowing the intention of The Masque to come fonvard with ample explanation of his motives at a proper crisis, tiU which, " more blood must flow in Klosterheim."
CHAPTER XL Meantime the Landgrave was himself perplexed and darmed. Hitherto he had beHeved himself possessed of aU the intrigues, plots, or conspiracies, which threatened his influence in the city. Among the students and among the citizens He had many spies, who communicated to him whatsoever they could learn, which was sometimes more than the truth, and sometimes a good ded less. But now he was met by a terrific antagomst, who moved in dark¬ ness, careless of his power, inaccessible to his threats, and apparently as reckless as himself of the quaHty of his means. Adomi, ivith oU his Venetian subtlety, was now as much at fault as every body else. In vain hud they deUberated together, day after day, upon his probable purposes; in vdn had they schemed to intercept his person, or offered high rewards for tracing his retreats. Snares Had been laid for him
in'vairf;'every wile ! had proved abortive, every plot had'bfeen'cotnftorpldtte'd.'' Arid'both involuntarily confused that they had now met ivith their master. "Vexed and confounded, fears for the future strug¬ gling-with mortification for the past,'the Landgrave was sitting, late at nigHt, in the long gallery where he 1 -usually"held'his councils. He was reflecting ivith anxiety on tlie pecuHarly unpropitious moment at which his new enemy had come upon the stage— the very crisis of the 'struggle between the Swedish and Imperial interest in Klosterheim, which would ultimately determine his own place and value in the 1 'estimate of his new nlHes. He was not of a character to 1 be easily duped by mystery.' Yet he could'not"but acknowledge to himself that there was something calculated' to impress awe and the sort'of fear which is connected ivith'the superna¬ tural, in'the sudden appearances, and vanishings os sudden, of The Masque. He came ud one could guess whence, retreated no one could guess whither; ivas intercepted, and 1 yet eluded arrest; and if half the stories in circulation could'be credited, seemed inaudible in his steps, at pleasure to make 'himself invisible and impalpable to'the'very hands stretched out to' detain 'him. " Much of this, no doubt, was
wilful exaggeration, or ,, the (fictions, of; .fears (i self- deluded.'^ But enough remained,\afte.r ll eYery,allow¬ ance, to justifysianr extraordinary,,interest, Jn,, ,so singular a ibeingi;. and the, Landgrave .could not avoid wishing ithat, chance might pffer n ftn opportu¬ nity to himself of observing ihun. ■., , i ,__,, ,,„. , , . Profound .silence had for some,,time,[reigned throughout the castle. , A clock which stood in the room, broke it for a moment by striking,the quar¬ ters ; and, raising his eyes, the Landgrave perceived that it was pastitwo.i ,He rose,to,.retire Jinr,the night, and stood .for a moment .musing with one hand resting upon the table. A momentaiy,feeling of awe came across him, as his eyes travelled through the gloom, at the, lower, end .of the room,, on the suddeni thought—that a, being so mysterious, and capable i of piercing through so many, impediments to the interior of every mansion in Klosterheim, was doubtless likely enough to visit the castle; nay, it would be ,no iways improbable that he should penetrate to this .very room, , What bars had, yet been found sufficient to repel him ? And, who pould pretend,to,calculate ,the ,hour of his visit ? ,,'This night even might be the time which he would select. ■Thinking thus, the Landgrave was suddenly aware
of a dusky figure entering the room by a door at the lower end. The room Hod tho length and gene¬ ral proportions of a gaUery, and the further end was so remote from the candles which stood on the Landgrave's table, that the deep gloom was but slightly penetrated by their rays. Light, However, there was, sufficient to display the outUne of a figure slowly and inaudibly advancing up tho room. It codd not be said that the figure advanced stealth¬ ily ; on the contrary, its motion, carriage, and bear¬ ing, were in the Highest degree dignified and solemn. But the feeUng of a stealthy purpose was suggested by the perfect sdencdof its tread. The motion of a shadow codd <not 'be more noiseless. And this circumstance confirmed the Landgrave's first impres¬ sion, that now He was on the point of accompUsbing his recent wish, and meeting that mysterious being who waa tho object of so much awe, and the author of so far-spread a panic. - < He was right; *it was indeed The Masque, armed cap-a-pie as usual. He advanced with an equable and determined step in the direction 1 of the Land¬ grave. Whether he saw his iHighness, who stood a Httle in the'shade of a large cabinet, could not be known; the Landgrave doubted not that He did.
He was a princo of firm nerves by constitution, and of great intrepidity,-—yet, as ono who shared in the superstitions of his age, ho could not bo*expected entirely to suppress an emotion of indefinite appre¬ hension as he now beheld the solemn approach of a being, who, by some unaccountable means, bad tre¬ panned so many different individuds from so many different houses, most of them prepared for self-de¬ fence, and fenced in by the protection of stone walls, locks, and bars. - > • • > - " The Landgrave, However, lost none of-his pre¬ sence of mind; and in the midst of his discomposure, as his eye fell upon the habiHments of -this myste¬ rious person, and the 'arms and miHtary accoutre¬ ments which he bore, naturally his thoughts settled upon the more earthly means of annoyance which this martial apparition carried ■ about -Him. The Landgrave was himself unarmed,—he had no arms even within reach,—nor was it possible for liim in his present situation very speedUy to summon assist¬ ance. ■ With'these thoughts passing rapidly through his mind, and sensible that, in any view of his nature and powers, thei being now in liis presence was a very formidable antagonist, the Landgrave could not but feel reHeved from a burden of anxious tremors,
vhen he saw,Tho Masque suddenly turn towards a Ippr which opened about half way up the room, and ead auto a picture-gallery at right angles with the •ooni mi which they both (were. ilnto the picture-gallery The Masque passed at the same solemn ipace, without apparently looking at the Landgrave. This movement seemed to argue, either that he purposely decHned an interview with the Prince, 'and! tliat might argue fear, tor that he had not been aware of his presence;—either suppo¬ sition, as i implying 1 , something, of ihuman infirmity, seemed lincompatible tivith supernatural faculties. Partly upori this consideration, and partly perhops because he suddenly recollected that the road taken by'The Masque woulddead him tdirectly past the apartments o£>the* old'seneschal, where assistance might be summoned, the Landgrave found his spirits at this moment revive. The consciousness of rank and birth also came to his aid, aud that sort of dis¬ dain of the aggressor, which possesses every man— brave or cowardly alike-Mvithin this walls if his own dwelHng:—unarmed as he was, he determined to pursue, and perhaps to speak. The restraints of high breeding, and the ceremo¬ nious decorum of his rank, involuntarily checked the
L'ffldgrave from pursuing with 1 a hurried pace. He advanced with his'habitual gravity of istep, r so that The Masque was half way down the gallery ^before ' the Prince entered it. This gaUery, furnished on each side with pictures, of which some were portraits, was of great length. The Masque and the Prince continued to advance, preservings pretty equal dis¬ tance. It did not appear by (mysigni or'gesture that The Masque was aware of the Landgrave's pur¬ suit. Suddenly, however, he paused—drewhis sword —halted; the Landgrave also halted; then turning half round, and waving with his hand to the Prince so as to solicit his attention, slowly The Masque ele¬ vated the point of his 'eword to tho level of a picture —it was tho portiait of a young cavaHer in a'hunt- ing dress, blooming with youth and youthful energy. The Landgravo turned prle, trembled, land was rue¬ fully agitated, i The Masque kept his sword in its position for half a minute; then dropping it, shook his head^ and raised his hand with a pecuhar solem¬ nity of expression. "iThe Landgrave recovered him¬ self—his features sweUed with passion—ho quicken¬ ed his step, and again foUowed'in pursuit, t * The Masque, however, had by this time turned out of the gaUery into a passage, which, after a single
curve, terminated in the private room of the seie- echal. Beh'eving that his ignorance of the locahties was thus leading him. on to certain capture, the Landgrave pursued more deisurely. > The passage ,was dimly lighted; every image floated in a cloudy obscurity I and, upon reaching the curve, it seemed to the Landgrave that The Masque was just on the -point of entering the seneschal's room. No other door was heard to open; and he felt assured that he- had seen the lofty figure of Tho Masque gfiding into ihat apartment. He agdn quickened Iiis steps ; a light burned within, the door stood ajir; quietly the Prince pushed it open, and entered with the ■ftdlest assurance that he should here at length over¬ take the object of his pursuit. ' Great was His consternation upon finding in a room, which presented no outlet, not a Hving crea¬ ture except the elderly seneschd, who lay quietly sleeping in his arm-chdr. The first impulse of the Prince was to awaken him roughly, that he might summon dd and co-operate in the search. One glance at a paper upon the table arrested his Hand. He saw a name written there, interesting to his fears beyond aU others in the world. His eye was* riveted as by fascination to the paper. He read one
astant. That satisfied him that the old seneschal nust be overcome by no counterfeit slumbers, when le could thus surrender a secret of capital^import- mce to the gaze of that eye from which/above all ithers he must desire to/screen it..- One, moment ae deliberated with" himself; the old < man' stirred, ind muttered in his dreams; the Landgrave seized the paper, and stood irresolute for on instant whether to await his wakening, and authoritatively to claim what so nearly concerned his own interest, or, to re¬ treat with it from the roombefore the oldman should be aware of the Prince's visit, .orhis ownloss. But the seneschal, .wearied perhaps with some unusual exertion, had but moved in his chair; again he composed himself to deep slumber,'made deeper by the warmthi of a hot ffire.. The raving of the wind, as it whistled round this angle of the schloss, drowned all sounds that .could'have disturbed him. The Landgrave secreted the paper;*nor did any sense of iiis rank and character interpose to check him in an act so unworthy, of an honourable cava¬ lier. Whatever crimes he had hitherto committed or authorized, this was perhaps the first instance in which he had offended by an instance of petty kna¬ very. He retired with the stealthy pace of a robber
anxious to evade detection; and stole back to his own apartments with an overpowering interest in the •discovery he Had made so occidentdly, and with an anxiety to investigate it farther, which absorbed for the time dl other cares, and banished from his thoughts even The Masque himself, whose sudden appearance and retreat had in fact thrown into his hands the secret which now so exclusively disturb¬ ed liim.
' i ' i f/t '-■ J \. i< f ^ » n i i t' ' ? t > ' CHAPTEB, XII. Meaniime The Masque continued to harass the Landgrave, to baffle many of his wiles, and to neu¬ tralize his most politic schemes. In one of the many placards which he affixed to the castle gates, he de¬ scribed the Landgrave as ruling in Klosterheim by day, and himself by night. Sarcasms such as these, together with the practical insults which The Masque continually offered to the Landgrave, by foiHng his avowed designs, embittered the Prince's existence. The injury done to his political schemes of ambition at tliis particular crisis ivas irreparable. One after one, all the agents and tools by whom lie could hope to work upon the counsels of the Klostf rheira autho¬ rities, had been removed. Losing their influence, he had lost every prop of his own. Nor was this all; he was reproached by the general voice of the city as the original cause of a calamity, which he had since shown himself impotent to redress. He L
it was, and his cause, which had drawn upon the people, so fatally trepanned, the hostility of the mysterious Masque. But for his Highness, all the burgomasters, captains, city-officers, &c, would now be sleeping in their beds; whereas the best fate which could be surmispd for the most of them, was, that they were sleeping in dungeons; some perhaps in their graves. And thus the Landgrave's cause not merely lost its most efficient partisans, but through their loss determined the wavering against him, alienated the few who remained of his own faction, and gave strength and encountgement to the general disaffection which had so long prevailed. Thus it happened that the conspirators, or sus¬ pected conspirators, could not be brought to trial, or to punishment without a trial. Any spark of fresh irritation falling- upon the present combustible tem¬ per of the populace, would not fail to produce an explosion. Fresh conspirators, and real ones, were thus encouraged to arise. The university, the city, teemed with plots. The government of the Prince was exhausted with the growing labour of tracing aud counteracting them. And, by little and little, matters came into such a condition, that the control of the city, though still continuing in the Land-
grave's hands, was maintained by mere martial force, and at the very point of the sword. Andjm no long time, it was feared, that with so general a principle of hatred to combine the populace, and so large a body of military students to head them, the balance of power, already approaching to an equipoise, would be turned against the Landgrave's government. And, in the best event, his Highness could now look for notliing from their love. AU might be reckoned for lost that could not be extorted by force. This state of things had been brought about by the di'eadful Masque, seconded, no doubt, by those whom he had emboldened and aroused ivithin; and, as the climax and crowning injury of the whole, every day unfolded more and more the vast import¬ ance which Klosterheim would soon possess as the centre and key of the movements to be anticipated in the coming campaign. An electoral cap would perhaps reward the services of the Landgrave in the general pacification, if He coidd present himself at the German Diet as the possessor de facto of Kloster¬ heim and her territorial dependencies, and with some imperfect possession dejure; still more, if he could plead the merit of having brought over this state, so important from local situation, as a willing aUy
to the Swedish interest. But to this, a free vote of the dty was an essential preHminary ; and from that, through the machinations of The Masque, he was now further than ever. The temper of the Prince began to give way under these accumulated provocations. An enemy for ever aiming his blows with the deadHest effect; for ever stabbing in the dark; yet charmed and consecrated from aU retdiation; dways met with, never to be found! The Landgrave ground his teeth, clenched his fists, ivith spasms of fury. He quarreUed ivith his ministers; swore at the officers; cursed the sen¬ tinels ; and the story went through Klosterheim that he had kicked Adorni. Certain it was, under whatever stimulus, that Adorni put forth much more zeal at last for the apprehension of The Masque. Come what would, he pubhcly avowed that six days more should not elapse without the arrest of this " ruler of Kloster¬ heim by night." He had a scheme for the purpose, a plot bdted for snaring him; and he pledged his reputation'as a minister and an intriguer, upon its entire success. On the foUowing day, invitations were issued by Adorni, in his Highness's name, to a masqued baU
^on that day week. The fasliion of masqued enter¬ tainments had been recently introduced from Italy into this sequestered nook of Germany; and here, as there, it Had been abused to purposes of criminal intrigue. Spite of the extreme unpopularity of the Land¬ grave with the low and middle classes of the city, among the highest his Httle court stiU continued to furnish a' central resort to the rank and high blood, converged in such unusual proportion within the waUs of Klosterheim. The schloss was still looked to as the standard and final court of appeal in aU matters of taste, elegance, and high breeding. Hence it naturally happened that every body, with any claims to such an honour, was anxious to receive a ticket of admission;—it became the test for ascer¬ taining a person's pretensions to mix in the first circles of society; and ivith this extraordinaiy zeal for obtaining an admission, naturaUy increased the minister's rigour and fastidiousness in pressing the usual investigation of the claimant's quaHfications. Much offence ivas given on both sides, and many sneers hazarded at the minister himself, whose pre¬ tensions were supposed to be of the lowest descrip¬ tion. But the result was, that exactly twelve hun-
dred cards were issued; these were regularly num-r bered, and bdow the device engraved upon the card was impressed a sed bearing the arms and motto of the Landgraves of X------. Every precaution was taken for carrying into effect the scheme, with aU its details, as concerted by Adorni; and the third day of the following week was annoimced as the day of the expected fete.
CHAPTER XIIL The morning of the important day at iengtn arrived, aud all Klosterheim was filled with expec. tation—even those who were not amongst the in¬ vited shared in the anxiety ; for a great scene was looked for, and perhaps some tragical explosion. The undertaking of Adorni was known; it had been published abroad that he was solemnly pledged to effect the arrest of The Masque ; and by many it was believed that he would so far succeed, at the least, as to bring on a public collision with that extraordinary personage. As to the issue, most people were doubtful, The Masque having- hitherto so uniformly defeated the best-laid schemes for liis apprehension. But it was hardly questioned that the public challenge offered to him by Adorni would succeed in bringing him before the public eye. This challenge had taken the shape of a public notice, posted up in the places where The Masque had
usuaUy affixed his own; and it was to the foUowing effect:—" That the noble strangers now in Kloster¬ heim, and others invited to the Landgrave's^efe, who might otherwise feel anxiety in presenting them¬ selves at the schloss, from an apprehension of meet¬ ing with the criminal disturber of the pubHc peace, known by the appeUation of The Masque, were re¬ quested by authority to lay aside aU apprehensions of that nature, as the most energetic measures had been adopted to, prevent or chastise upon the spot any such insufferable intrusion; and for The Masque Himself, if He presumed to disturb the company by his presence, he would be seized where he stood, and without farther enquiry committed to the Provost- Marshal for instant execution;—on which account, aU persons were ^warned carefuUy to forbear from intrusions of simple curiosity, since in the huny of the moment it'might be difficult to make the re¬ quisite distinctions." It was anticipated that this insulting notice would not long go without an answer from The Masque. Accordingly, on the foUowing morning, a placard, equaUy conspicuous, was posted up in the same pubHc places, side by side -with that to which it repHed. It was'couched in the foUowing terms;—
" That he who ruled by night in Klosterheim, coidd not suppose himself to bo excluded from a nocturnal fete given by any person in that city. That he must be aUowcd to believe himself invited by the Prince, and would certainly have the honour to accept his Highness's obh'ging summons. With regard to the low personaHties addressed to himself, that he could not descend to notice any thing of that nature coming from a man so abject as Adorni, until he should fii 1 have cleared himself from the imputation of having been a tailor in Venice at the time of the Spanish conspiracy in 1618, and banished from that city, not for any suspicions that could have settled upon him and his eight journeymen as making up one conspirator, but on account of some professional tricks in making a doublet for the Doge. For the rest, he repeated that he would not fail to meet the Landgrave and liis honourable company." AU Klosterheim laughed at this pubHc mortifica¬ tion offered to Adorni's pride; for that minister had incurred the pubHc disHke as a foreigner, and their hatred on the score of private character. Adorni himself foamed at the mouth with rage, impotent for the present, but which he prepared to give deadly
effect to at the proper time. But whUst it laughed, Klosterheim also trembled. Some persons indeed were of opinion, that the answer of The Masque was a mere sportive effusion of maHce or pleasantry from the students, who had suffered so much by his annoyances. But the majority, amongst uhom was Adorni liimself, thought otherwise. Apart even from the reply, or the insult which had provoked it, the general impresdon was, that The Masque would not have failed in attending a festivd, which, by the very costume which it imposed, offered so favourable a cloak to his own mysterious purposes. In this persuadon, Adorni took dl the precautions which persond vengeance and Venetian subtlety could suggest, for avaiHng himself of the single opportunity that would perhaps ever be allowed him for entrapping this pubHc enemy, who had now become a private one to himself. These various incidents had furnished abundant matter for conversation in Klosterheim, and had carried the pubHc expectation to the Highest pitch of anxiety, some time before the great evening arrived. Leisure had been dlowed for fear, and every possible anticipation of the wildest character, to unfold themselves. Hope, even, amongst many,
was a predominant sensation. Ladies were prepa¬ ring for hysterics. Cavaliers, besides the swords which they wore as regular articles of dress, were providing themselves with stilettoes' against any sudden rencontre hand to hand, or any unexpected surprise. Armourers and furbishers of weapons were as much in request as the more appropriate nrtists who minister to such festal occasions. These again were summoned to give their professional aid and attendance to an extent so much out of pro¬ portion to their numbers and their natural power of exertion, that they were harassed beyond nil physical capacity of endurance, and found their ingenuity more heavily taxed to find personal substitutes amongst the trades most closely connected with their own, than in any of tho contrivances which more properly fell within the business of their own art. Tailors, horse-milliners, shoemakers, friseurs, drapers, mercers, tradesmen of eveiy description, and servants of eveiy class and denomination were sum¬ moned to a sleepless activity—each in his several vocation, or in some which he undertook by proxy. Artificers who had escaped on political motives from Nuremburg and other Impenal cities, or from the sack of Magdeburg, now showed their ingenuity,
and their readiness to earn the bread of industry; and if Klosterheim resembled a hive in the close- packed condition of its inhabitants, it was now seen that the resemblance held good hardly less in the industry which, upon a sufficient excitement, it was able to develope. But in the midst of aU this stir, din, and unprecedented activity, whatever occupa¬ tion each man found for his thoughts or for his hands in his separate employments, aU hearts were mastered by one domineeringinterest—the approach¬ ing collision of the Landgrave, before his assembled court, with the mysterious agent who had so long troubled his repose,
CHAPTER XIV. The day at length arrived; the guards were posted in unusual strength ; the pages of honour, and ser vants in their state-dresses, were drawn up in long and gorgeous files along the sides of the Yost gothic halls, which ran in continued succession from the front of the schloss to the more modem saloons in the rear; bands of mUitaiy music, coUected from amongst the foreign prisoners of various nations ut Vienna, were stationed in their national costume— Italian, Hungarian, Turkish, or Croatian—in the lofty galleries or corridors wliich ran round the HaUs; and the deep thunders of the kettle-drums, reHeved by cymbals and wind-instruments, began to fill the mazes of the palace as early as seven o'clock in the evening ; for at that hour, according to the custom then estabHshed in Germany, such entertainments commenced. Repeated voUeys from long Hnes of musketeers, draivn up in the square, and at the other
entrances of the palace, with the deep roar of artil¬ lery, announced the arrival of the more distinguished visitors ; amongst whom it was rumoured that seve¬ ral officers in supreme command from the Swedish camp, ah-eady coUected in the neighbourhood, were this night coming incognito —avaiHng themselves of their masques to visit the Landgrave, and improve the terms of their aUiance, whilst they decHned the risk which they might have brought on themselves by too open a visit in theii' own avowed character and persons, to a town so unsettled in its state of feeling, and so friendly to the Emperor, as Kloster¬ heim had notoriously become. From seven to nine o'clock, in one unbroken Hue of succession, gorgeous parties streamed along through the haUs, a distance of fuU half a quarter of a mile, untQ they were checked by the barriers erected at the entrance to the first of the entertain¬ ing rooms, as the station for examining the tickets of admission. This duty was fulfilled in a way which, though really rigorous in the extreme, gave no inhospitable annoyance to the visitors—the bar¬ riers themselves concealed their jealous purpose of hostiHty, and in a manner disavowed the secret awe and mysterious terror which brooded over the even-
ing, by the beauty of their externd appearance. They presented a triple Hne of gilt lattice-work, rising to a great altitude, and connected with the fretted roof by pendent draperies of the most magnificent velvet, intermingled with banners and Heraldic trophies suspended from the ceiling, and at intervals slowly agitated in the currents which now and then swept these aerid heights. In the centre of the lattice opened a single gate, on each side of which was stationed a couple of sentinels armed to the teeth; and this arrangement was repeated three times, so rigorous was the vigilance employed. At the second of the gates, where the bearer of a forged ticket ivould have found himself in a sort of trap, with absolutely no possibihty of escape, every individual of each successive party presented liis card of ad¬ mission, and, fortunately for the convenience of the company, in consequence of the particular precau¬ tion used, one moment's inspection sufficed. The cards had been issued to the parties invited not very long before the time of assembHng; consequently, as each was sealed with a private seal of the Land¬ grave's, sculptured elaborately with his armorial bearings, forgery wodd have been next to impossi¬ ble.
- These arrangements, however, were made rather to reHeve the company from the too powerful terrors which haunted them, and to possess them from the first ivith a sense of security, than for the satisfac¬ tion of the Landgrave or his minister. Tliey were sensible that THe Masque had it in his power to com¬ mand an access from the interior—and this it seemed next to impossible dtogether to prevent; nor was that indeed the wish of Adorni, but rather to faciU- tate his admission, and afterwards, when satisfied of his actual presence, to bar tip aU possibihty of retreat. Accordingly, the interior arrangements, though perfectly prepared,'and ready to close up at the word of command, were for the present but negligently enforced. Thus stood matters at nine o'clock, by which time upwards of a thousand persons Had assembled; and in ten minutes more an officer reported that the whole twelve hundred were present without one de¬ faulter. The Landgrave had not yet appeared, his minister having received the company ; nor was he expected to appear for an hour—in reaHty, he was occupied in poHtical discussion with some of the Ulustrious in¬ cognitos. But this did not interfere ivith the pro- 2
gress of the festival; and at this moment nothing could be more impressivo than the far-stretching splendours of the spectacle. In one immense saloon, twelve hundred cavaliers nnd kdies, attired in the unrivalled pomp of that age, were arranging themselves for one of the mag¬ nificent Hungarian dances, which tho Emperor's court at Vienna had transplanted to the camp of Wallenstein, and thence to all the great houses of Germany. Bevies of noble women, in every variety of fanciful costume, but in each considerable group presenting deep masses of black or purple velvet, on which, ivith the most striking advantage of. ra¬ diant relief, lay the costly pearl ornaments, or the sumptuous jewels so generally significant in those times of high ancestral pretensions, intermingled with the drooping plumes of martial cavaliers, who presented almost universally the soldierly air of ' frankness wliich belongs to active service, mixed with the Castilian grandezza that still breathed through the camps of Germany, emanating origin¬ ally from the magnificent courts of Brussels, of Madrid, and of Vienna, and propagated to this age by the links of Tilly, the Bavarian commander, and Wallenstein, the more than princely commander for M
t the Emperor. Figui'es and habiHments so command¬ ing- were of themselves enough to fiU the eye and occupy the imagination; but, beyond aU this, feel¬ ings of awe and mystery, under more shapes than one, brooded over the whole scene, and diffused a tone of suspense and intense excitement throughout the vast assembly. It was known tbat illustrious strangers were present incognito. There now be¬ gan to be some reason for anticipating a great battle in the neighbourhood. The men were now present perhaps, the very hands were now visibly displayed for the coming dance, uhich in a few days or even hours, (so rapid were the movements at this period,) were to wield the truncheon that miglit lay the CathoHc empire prostrate, or might mould the des¬ tiny of Europe for centuries. Even this feeling- gave way to one still more enveloped in shades— The Masque I Would he keep his promise and ap¬ pear? might he not be there already? might he not even now be moving amongst them ? may he ■not, even at this very moment, thought each person, secretly be near me—or even touching myself—or haunting my own steps ? Yet again thought most people, (for at that time hardly any body affected to be incredulous in matters
allied to the supernatural), was this mysterious be¬ ing liable to touch ? Was he not of some impassive nature, inaudible, invisible, impalpable ? Many of his escapes, if truly reported, seemed to argue as 1 much. If then connected with the spiritual world, was it with the good or the evU in that inscmtable region ? But then the bloodshed, the torn dresses, the marks of deadly struggle, which remained be¬ hind in some of those cases where mysterious dis¬ appearances Had occurred,—these seemed undeniable arguments of miu'der, foul and treacherous murder. Every attempt, in short, to penetrate tho mystery of this being's nature proved as abortive as the at¬ tempts to intercept his pprson ; and aU efforts at applying a solution to the difficulties of the case, made tbe mystery even more mysterious. These thoughts, however, generaUy as they per¬ vaded tho company, woidd have given way for a time at least to the excitement of the scene; for a sudden clapping of hands from some officers of the house¬ hold, to enforce attention, and as a signal to the orchestra in one of the gaUeries, at this moment proclaimed that the dances were on the point of com¬ mencing in another half minute, when suddenly a shriek from a female, and then a loud tumultuous
ciy, from a multitude of voices, announced some fearful catastrophe; and in the next moment a shout of ">Murder!" froze the blood of the timid amongst the company.
CHAPTER XV. So vast was the saloon, that it had been impos- siblo, through the maze of figures, the confusion of colours, and the minghng of a thousand voices, that any thing should be perceived distinctly at the lower end of aU that was now passing at the upper. StiU, so awful is the mystery of life, and so hideous and accursed in man's imagination is every secret extinc¬ tion of that consecrated lamp, that no news thrills so deeply, or travels so rapidly. Hardly could it be seen in what direction, or through whose. commu¬ nication, yet in less than a minute a movement of sympathizing horror, and uplifted hands, announced tliat the dreadful news had reached them. A mur¬ der, it was said, had been committed in tho palace. Ladies began to faint; others hastened away in search of friends; others to learn the news more accurately; and some of the gentlemen, who tliought themselves sufficiently privileged by rank, hurried
off with a stream of agitated enquirers to the interior of tho castle', in'search of the scene itself. A few only passed the guard in the first moments of con« fusion, and penetrated with the agitated Adorni through the long and winding passages, into the very scene of the murder. A rumour had prevailed for a moment that the Landgrave was himself the vic¬ tim ; and as the road by which the agitated house¬ hold conducted them took a direction towards his Highness's suite of rooms, at first Adorni had feared that result. Recovering his self-possession, how¬ ever, at length, he learned that it was the poor old seneschal upon whom tho blow had fallen. And he pressed on with move coolness to the dreadful spectacle. The poor old man was stretched at liis length on the floor. It did not seem that he had straggled with the murderer. Indeed, from some appearances, it seemed probable that he had been attacked whilst sleeping; and though he had received three wounds, it was pronounced by a surgeon that one of them (and that, from circumstances, the first) had been sufficient to extinguish life. He was discovered by his daughter, a woman who held some respectable place amongst the servants of tho castle; and every
presumption concurred in fixing tlm timo of the dreadful sceno to about ono hour before. " Such, gentlemen, are the acts of this atrocious monster, this Masque, who has so long been the scourge of Klosterheim," said Adorni to tho strangers who had accompanied him, as they turned away on their return to the company; " but this very night, I trust, will put a bridle in his mouth." " God grant it may bo so !" said some. But others thought tho whole case too mysterious for conjec¬ tures, and too solemn to be decided by presumptions. And in the midst of agitated discussions on the scene thry had just witnessed, as well as the whole history of Ihe Masque, the party returned to the saloon. Under ordinary circumstances, this dreadful event would have damped the spirits of the company; ns it was, it did but deepen the gloomy excitement which already had possession of all present, and raise a more intense expectation of the visit so pub¬ licly announced by The Masque. It seemed as though he had perpetrated this recent murder merely by way of reviving the impression of his own dreadful cha¬ racter in Klosterheim, which might have decayed a little of late, in all its original strength and fresh¬ ness of novelty; or, as though he wished to send
immediately before him an act of atrocity that should form an appropriate Herald or harbinger of bis own entrance upon the scene. Dreadful, however, as this deed of darkness was, it seemed of ;too domestic a nature to exercise any continued influence upon so distinguished an assem¬ bly, so numerous, so splendid, ond brought together nt so distinguished a summons. Agdn, therefore, the masques prepared to mingle in the dance; agdn the signd was given; again the obedient orchestra pre¬ luded to the coming strains. In a moment more, the full tide of harmony swept along. The vast sdoon, and its echoing roof, rang with the storm of music. The masques, with their floating plumes and jowdled caps, glided through the fine mazes of the Hungarian dances. All was one magnificent and tempestuous confusion, overflowing ivith the luxury of sound and sight, when suddenly, about midnight^ a trumpet sounded, the Landgrave en¬ tered, and aU was hushed. The gHttering crowd arranged themselves in a half circle at the upper end of the room; his Highness went rapidly round, sa¬ luting theicompany, and receiving their Homage in return. A signd was again made; the music and the dancing were resumed; and such was the animation
and the turbulent deHght amongst the gayer part of the company, from the commingling of youthful blood with wine, Hghts, music, and festal conversa¬ tion, that, ivith many, dl thoughts of the dreadful Masque, who ■<« reigned by night in Klosterheim," had faded before the exhilaration of the moment. Midnight Had come; the dreadful apparition had not yet entered; young ladies began timidly to jest upon the subject, though as yet but fdntly, and in a tone somewhat serious for a jest; and young cavdiers, who, to do them justice, had derived most part of their terrors from the superstitious view of the case, protested to their partners that if The Masque, on making his appearance, shodd conduct himself in a manner unbecoming a cavaHer, or offensive to the ladies present, they shodd feel it their duty to chas¬ tise him; " though," sdd they, " ivith respect to old Adorni, shodd The Masque think proper to teach him better manners, or even to cane him, we shaU not find it necessary to interfere." Several of the very young ladies protested that, of aU things, they should Hke to see a battle between old Adomi and The Masque, " such a love of a qdz that old Adorni is I" whUst others debated whether THe Masque would turn out a young man or an old
one"; and a few elderly maidens mooted the point whether he were Hkely to be a " single" gentleman, or burdened ivith a ct wife and family." These and similar discussions were increasing in vivacity, and kindling more and more gaiety of repartee, when sud¬ denly, with the effect of a funeral knell upon their mirth, a whisper began to circulate, that there ivrs one Masque too many in company. Pei-sons had been stationed by Adorni in different gaUeries, with instructions to note accurately the dress of every person in the company; to watch the motions of eveiy one who gave the sHghtest cause for suspicion, by standing aloof from the rest of the assembly, or by any other pecuHarity of manner; but, above aU, to count tbe numbers'of the total assembly. This last injunction was more easily obeyed than at first sight seemed possible. At this time, the Hungarian dances, which required a certain number of partners to ' execute the (movements of'the figure, were of themselves a sufficient register of the precise amount of persons, engaged in them. And, as "these dances continued for a long time undisturbed, this calcula¬ tion once made,'left no'further computation neces¬ sary, than simply to take' the account of oU who stood otherwise,engaged. This Hst being much the
smaUer one, was soon made; and the reports of several different observers, stationed in different gal¬ leries, and checked by each other,'aU tattied in re¬ porting a total of just twelve hundred and one per¬ sons, after every aUoivance was made for the known members of the Landgrave's suite, who were oU un- masqued. This report was annoimced with considerable tre¬ pidation, in a very audible whisper to Adorni and the Landgrave. The buzz of agitation attracted in¬ stant attention ; the whisper was loud enough to catch the ears of several; the news went rapidly kincUing through the room that the company was too many by one': all the ladies trembled, their knees shook, their voices failed, they stopped in the very middle of questions, answers halted, for their conclusion, and were never more remembered by either party ; the very music began to falter, the lights seemed to wane andsicken; for the fact was now too evident—that THe Masque Had kept lus appoint¬ ment, and was at this moment in the room, " to meet the Landgrave and His Honourable company." Adorni and the Landgrave' now walked apart from the rest of the household, and were obviously consulting together on the next step to b,e taken,
or on the proper moment for executing- one which had already been decided on. Some crisis seemed approaching, and the knees of many ladies knocked together, as they anticipated some cruel or bloody act of vengeance. " Oh, poor Masque I" sighed a young lady it her tender-hearted concern for one who seemed now at the mercy of his enemies; " Do you think, sir," addressing her partner, " they will cut him to pieces?"—.« Oh, thatwickedold Adorni 1" exclaimed another; « I know he will stick the poor Masque on one side, and somebody else will stick him on the other; I know he iviU, because The Masque caHed him a tailor: do you think he was a tailor, sir ?"—" Why, reaUy, madam, he walks like a tailor ; but then he must be » very bad one, con¬ sidering how ill his own clothes are made; and that, you know, is next door to being none at all. But see, his Highness is going to stop the music." In fact, at that moment tho Landgrave made a signal to the orchestra; the music ceased abruptly; and his Highness advancing to the company, who stood eagerly awaiting his words, said—" IUus- trious and noble friends! for a very urgent and special cause I will request of you all to take your seats."
The company obeyed, every one sought the chair next to him, or if a lady, accepted that which was offered by the cavalier at her side. The standers continually diminished. Two hundred were left, one hundred and fifty, eighty, sixty, twenty, till at last they were reduced to two,—both gentlemen, who had been attending upon ladies. They were suddenly aware of their own situation. One chair only remained out of twelve hundred. Eager to exonerate himself from suspicion, each sprang fu¬ riously to this seat; each attained it at the same mo¬ ment, and each possessed liimself of part at the same instant. As they happened to be two elderly cor¬ pulent men, the younger cavaliers, under all the restraints of the moment, the panic of the company, and the Landgrave's presence, could not forbear laughing; and the more spirited amongst the young ladies caught the infection. His Highness was little in a temper to brook this levity ; and hastened to relieve the joint occupants of the chair from the ridicule of their situation. " Enough !" he exclaimed, " enough'! all my friends, are requested to resume the situation most agreeable to them; my purpose is answered."—The Prince was himself standing with all his household,
and, as a point of respect, all the company rose. («' Ai you tvere," whispered the young soldiers to their fair companions.) Adorni now came forward. " It is known," said he, " by trials more than sufficient, that some in¬ truder, with the worst intentions, has crept into this honourable company. The ladies present niU there¬ fore have the goodness to retire apart to the lower end of the saloon, whilst the noble cavaliers will present themselves in succession to six officers of his Highness's household, to whom they wUl pri¬ vately communicate their names and quaHty." This arrangement was compHed with, not how¬ ever without the exchange of a few flying jests on the part of the younger cavaliers, and tlieir fair part¬ ners, as they separated for the purpose. The cava¬ Hers, who were rather more than five hundred in number, went up as they were summoned by the number marked upon their cards of admission, and privately communicating ivith some one of the ofli¬ cers appointed, were soon told off, and filed away to the right of the Landgrave, waiting for the signal which should give them permission to rejoin their parties. AU bad been now told off, ivithin a score. These
were clustered together in a group ; and in that group undoubtedly was The Masque. Every, eye was converged upon this smaU knot of cavaHers ; each of the spectators, according to his fancy, se¬ lected the one who came nearest in dress, or in per¬ sonal appearance, to his preconceptions of that mys¬ terious agent. Not a word was uttered, not a whis¬ per ; hardly a robe was heard to rustle, or a feather to wave. The twenty were rapidly reduced to twelve, these to six, the six to four—three—two; the tale of the. invited was complete, and one man remained behind. That was, past doubting, THe Masque!

announced that the ceremony was closed, that he only remained to answer for himself, and upon pal¬ pable proof—evidence not to be gainsayed—inca¬ pable of answering satisfactorily ; when in fact it was beyond dispute that here was at length revealed, in bodily presence, before the eyes of those whom he had so long haunted ivith terrors, The Masque of Klosterheim,—it was naturally expected that now at least he would show alarm and trepidation; that he would prepare for defence, or address himself to instant flight. Far otherwise!—cooler thou any one person beside in the saloon, he stood, like the marble column against which ho had been reclining, upright—massy—and imperturbable. Ho was enveloped in a voluminous mantle, which at this moment, -with a leisurely motion, ho suffered to fall at his feet, and displayed a figure in which the grace of an Antinous met with the columnar strength of a Grecian Hercules, —presenting, in its taut ensemble, the majestic pro¬ portions of a Jupiter. He stood—a breathing statue of gladiatorial beauty, towering above all who were near him, and eclipsing the noblest spe¬ cimens of the human form which the martial assem¬ bly presented. A bnzz of admiration arose, which N
in, the,foHoyving moment-wos suspended by the dubious recqllections investing his past appearances, and the terror, which waited- even on his present movements, j ,He was,armed to the teeth; and he was obviously preparing to move. Not a word had yet been spoken; so tnmultuous was ,tb.e succession of surprises, so mixed ond con¬ flicting the. feelings, so intense the anxiety. The arrangement of the groupes was this:—at the lower half of the room, but starting forward in attitudes of admiration or suspense, were the ladies of Klos¬ terheim. At the upper end, in tho centre, one hand raised to. bespeak attention, ivas The Masque of Klos¬ terheim. „, To bis left, and a little behind him, ivith a subtle Venetian countenance, ono hand waving back a half file of musketeers, and the other raised as if to arre,st the arm of The Masque, was the wily minister Adorni—creeping nearer and nearer with a stealthy stride. To his right was the great body of Klosterheim cavaliers, a score of students and young officers pressing forward to the frpnt; but in advance of the whole, the Landgrave of X------, haughty, lowering, and throiving out looks of defiance. These were the positions and attitudes in which the first discovery of The Masque had surprised them; and
these they still retained. Less* dignified spectators were looking downwards from the galleries! '' " Surrender 1" was the first word by which silence was broken; it came from the Landgrave!'''" " Or die!" exclaimed Adorni! * '' ' " He dies in any case," rejoined the Prince. ' The Masque still raised his hand with the action of one who bespeaks attention'. Adorni he deigned not to notice. Slightly inclining his head'to the Landgrave, in a tone to which' it might be the head-dress of elaborate steel-work that gave a sepul¬ chral tone, he rephed,— ' " The Masque, who rules in Klosterheim by night, sm'renders not. He can die. But first he will complete the ceremony of the night, he will reveal himself," " That is superfluous," exclaimed Adorni; " we need no further revelations.—Seize him, and lead him out to death' 1" ' " Dog of an Italian!" replied The Masque, draw¬ ing a dag* from his belt, "die first yourself 1" And so saying, he slowly tunied'and levelled the barrel
* JDag, a sort of pistol or carbine.
at Adorni, who fledwith two bounds to the soldiers in the rear. Then, withdrawing the weapon hastily, He added in a tone of cool contempt, " Or bridle that coward's tongue." h ' il • iButthisiivasnottheminister'sintention. "Seize him I" i he cried'again impetuously to the soldiers, laying his hand on the arm of the foremost, and pointing them forward to their prey. ■ li" No IR said the Landgrave, with a commanding voice; " Halt I «'I bid you." Something there was in the' tone, or itimight be that there was something in his private rccoUections, or something in the. general mystery, 'which promised a discovery that he'fear,ed tolose by the too precipitate vengeance of the ItaHan. .'•" What is it, mysterious being, that. you"Wonld reveal?" iOr who is lit .that you mow believe interestedinyour revelations?'* f ' .!" iXburself.—Prince, it would seem thatyou have meat your mercy: wherefore then the coward haste of this Venetian hound ?

Such I am; and neither mnagato from a 'foreign land ; nor"—turning to Adorni—" a base mechanic." i
" But a murderer!" shrieked Adorni: « but a murderer; and with hands yet reeldng from inno¬ cent blood 1" f " Blood, Adomi, that I will yet avenge.—.prince, you demand the nature of my revelations." I wdl reveal my name, my quahty, and my mission," " And to whom ?" ' ' " To yourself, and none beside. And, as a pledge' for the sincerity of my discoveries, I will first of all communicate a dreadful secret, knowni as you fondly believe, to none but your Highness. Prince,' dare you receive my revelations ?" f ' Speaking thus, The Masque took one t step to the rear, turning his back upon the room, and by a gesture, bignifiod his wish that the Landgrave should accompany him. But at tins motion, ten or a dozen of the foremost among the young cavaHers started forward in advance of the Landgrave, in part forming a half circle about his person, and in part command¬ ing the open door-way. ' ' * ( ! * ^ ' f 1 « He is armed 1" they exclaimed; " 'and'trebly armed':''nill your r Highness 'approa'ch ihim too nearly ?''' \ i\ i" 1 i l\ ? < f Uu 1 " I fear him not," said'the Landgrave, with some-'' thing of a contemptuous 'tone.""
*' Wherefore shoidd you fear me ?" retorted The Masque, with a manner so tranquil and serene as involuntarily to disarm suspicion: '* Were it possi- bletha't' I 'should seek the life of any man here in particular,' in that case, (pointing to the fire-arms in his 1 belt,) why should I need to come nearer ? Were it possible that any should find in my con¬ duct here'a motive to a personal vengeance upon myself, which of you is not near enough ? Has your Highness the courage to trample on such terrors ?" * ■ ' ■ Thus challenged as it were to a trial of his cou¬ rage before the assembled rank of Klosterheim, the Landgrave waved off all who would have stepped fonvard officiously to his support. If he felt any tremors, he was now sensible that pride and princely honour called upon hira to dissemble them. And probably, that sort of tremors, which he felt in reality, did not point in a direction to which physi¬ cal'support, such as was now tendered, could have been available. He hesitated no longer, but strode fonvard to meet The Masque. • His Highness and The' Masque met near the archway of the door, in the very centre of the groups.
With a thrilling tone, deep-ipiercing-J-full of alarm, The Masque began thus:— i'n./ -n^i,!/; " To win your confidence} for ever Ito establish credit with your Highness, I'willifirst of I all reveal the name of that murderer, who this night dared to pollute your palace with an old man's blood, i Prince, bend your ear a little this way.? >i'i',i[ i .<> ,7 Witb a shudder, and a visible effort of self-com¬ mand, theLandgraveinclinedhis ear to The Masque, who added,— < ., , ,,,1,,*! ,, J( t " Your Highness will be shocked to hear it:" then, in a lower tone, " Who could have believed it ?—It was-------- ■•" -All was pronounced clearly and strongly, except the last word—the iname of the murderer: that was made audible only,to the Landgrave's ear. , , . . .. n . i Sudden 1 and tremendous was the effect upon the prince: he reeled a few paces off; put his hand to the hilt of his sword; smote his forehead; - threw frenzied looks upon The Masque,—now half implo¬ ring, now dark with vindictive wrath. . iTheni suc¬ ceeded a pause of profoundest silence, during .which all the twelve hundred visitors, whom he had himself assembled, as if expressly to .make them witnesses of this extraordinary scene, and of the power with

of smoke arose, ^nobody knew whence' Kepeated discharges of fire-arms were heard >resounding from the doorway and tho-passages; these increased the smoke iand the' confusion. > .Trumpets sounded through the corridors. The whole archway, under which The Masque and the Landgrave had been standing,' became choaked up with soldiery, sum¬ moned by the furious alarms that echoed through the palace. 1 ^ All ivas one uproar and chaos of masques, plumes, i helmets* -halberds, trumpets, gleaming sabres, and the fierce faces of soldiery forcing them¬ selves through the floating drapery of smoke that now filled the whole upper end of the saloon. Adomi was seen in the midst, raving fruitlessly. Nobody heard: nobody.Hstened. Universal panic had seized the household, the soldiery, and the com¬ pany. Nobody understood exactly for what purpose the tumult hadi commenced—in what direction it tended. Some tragic catastrophe was reported from mouth to mouth : nobody knew what. Some said— the Landgrave had been assassinated; some—The Masque; some asserted that both had perished under reciprocal assaults. More beUeved that The Masque had proved to be of that supernatural order of beings, with which the prevaiHng opinions of Klosterheim
had long classed him; and that, upon raising his disguise, he had revealed to the Landgrave the fleshless skull of some forgotten tenant of the grave. This indeed seemed to many the only solution that, whilst it fell in ivith the prejudices and supersti¬ tions of the age, was of a nature to account for that tremendous effect which the discovery had produced upon the Landgrave. But it was one that naturally could be little calculated to calm the agitations of the public prevailing at this moment. This spread contagiously. The succession of alarming events,— the murder, the appearance of The Masque, his sub¬ sequent extraordinary behaviour, the overwhelming impression upon the Landgrave, which had formed the catastrophe of this scenical exhibition,—the consternation of the great Swedish officers, who were spending the night in Klosterheim, and rea¬ sonably suspected that the tumult might be owing- to the sudden detection of their own incognito, and that, in consequence, the populace of this Imperial city were suddenly rising to arms; the endless dis¬ traction and counteraction of so many thousand persons—visitors, servants, soldiery, household— all hurrying- to the same point, and bringing assist¬ ance to a danger of which nobody knew the origin,
nobody the nature, nobody the issue; multitudes: commanding where aU obedience was forgotten, all •subordination had gone to wreck;—these ciicum¬ stances of distraction tmited to sustain a scene of nbso^te frenzy in the castle, which, for more thnn half an hour, the dense columns of smoke aggravated alarmingly, by raising, in many quarters, additiond tgrrpr^pf { fiie.

' » r '' iU " i i 'i } i ',u .1 i' ii Meantime the Lady PauHna had spent her tifrie in secret grief, inconsolable for the supposed tragical fate of Maximilian. It was beHeved that'heliacl perished. This opinion had prevailed equally amdngst Ins fnends, and the fen enemies whom 'circumstances had made him. Supposing evei^ that he had escaped with life from the action, it seemed inevitable tliat he should have fallen into the hands of the' bloody Holkci'atein ; and under circumstances which would point Him out to tho vengeance of that cruel ruffian i—as having been the leader in the powerful resist¬ ance which had robbed him of his prey. Stung with the sense of her irreparable loss, and the premature grief which had bUghted her early hopes, Paulina sought her refuge in soHtude, and her consolations in religion. In the convent, where she had found a home, the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic service were maintained with the strictness 5
and the pomp 1 suitable to its ample endowments. The Emperor had himself, as 11 ell as several of his progenitors, been a liberal benefactor to this esta- bHshment. And a lady of his house, therefore, re¬ commended by a special introduction from the Em¬ peror to the attentions of the Lady Abbess, was sure of meeting kindness and courtesy in every possible shape which could avail to mitigate her sorrow. The Abbess, though a bigot, was a human being, with strong human sensibilities; and in both cha¬ racters she was greatly pleased with the Lady Pau¬ Hna. On the one 'hand, her pride, as the head of a reHgious estabHshment, was flattered by the extreme regularity of the Lady Paulina in conforming to the ritual of her house ; this example of spiritual obe¬ dience and duty seemed peculiarly edifying in a person of such distinguished rank. On the other hand, her womanly sensibiHties were touched by the spectacle of early and unmerited sorrow in one so eminent for her persond merits—for Her extreme beauty, and the winning sweetness of her manners. Hence she readdy offered to' the young Countess dl the attentions and marks of sympathy which her retiring habits permitted, and every species of indd- gence compatible ivith the spirit of the institution.
THe whole convent, nuns as i well as strangers, taking their tone frora the Abbess, vied, with each, other in attentions to PauHno. But, whilst ac¬ knowledging their kindness, she continued to shrink from all general intercourse with the society about her. Her attendance was constant at the matins and at vespers ; not unfrequently even at the mid¬ night service; but dejection was too rooted in her heart, to aUow her any disposition to enter into the amusements or mixed society which the convent at that time offered. , Many noble strangers had been aUowed .to take up then- quarters in the convent, i With some of these the Abbess was connected'by blood, ivith others, by ties of ancient friendship. Most of this party composed a little society apart from the rest, and continued to pursue those amusements or occu¬ pations which properly belonged to their stations and quality, but by their too worldly nature, were calculated to exclude the reHgious members of the institution from partaking in them. To this society, PauHna received frequent invitations, which, how¬ ever, she decHned so uniformly, that at length all efforts ceased to draw her from the retirement which she so manifestly adhered to.from clioice. The mo-
tives of her dejection became known throughout the convent, and were respected; and it was now report¬ ed amongst them, from her aversion to society as well as her increasing devotion, that tho Lady Pau¬ lina would/soon take the veil. i Amongst the strangers was one, a lady of mature ag«s, with beauty still powerful enough to fascinate all beholders, who seemed to survey Paulina with an interest far beyond that of curiosity or simple admiration. Sorrow might be supposed the tom- mon bond which connected them ; for there were rumours amongst the sisterhood of St Agnes that this lady had suffered afflictions heavier than fell to an ordinary lot in the course of the war which now desolated Germany. Her husband, (it was said,) of whom no more was known than that he was some officer of high rank, had perished by the hand of vio¬ lence ; a young daughter, the only child of two or three who remained to her, had been carried off in in¬ fancy ; and no traces remained of her subsequent fate. To those misfortunes was added the loss of her estates and rank, which, in some mysterious way, were sup¬ posed to be withheld from her by one of those great Oppressors whom war and the policy of great alhes had.aggmndiued. It was supposed even that for tlie

means of subsistence to herself, and a few faithful attendants, bHo was indebted to the kindness of the Lady Abbess, with whbm'she was closely connected by ancient friendship. f > > »■ <• >.!'•? In this tale there were many inaccuracies mix!ed up with the truth. It was true that, in some' one pf the v many dire convulsions which Had passed froni land to land since the first outbreak of the Bo¬ hemian troubles, in 1618, and which Had covered with a veil of poHtical pretexts'so many local acts of private family feud and murderous treason, this lady had been deprived of her husband by a'violent death under circumstances 'which stiU seemed 1 mys¬ terious. But .the fate of her chUdren, if any had survived the calamity which took off her husband, was unknown to eveiy body except her confidential protectress the Lady Abbess. By permission of this powerful friend, who had known her from infancy and jthrough the whole course of her misfortunes, shoiivas permitted to take up Her abode in-the con*- vent, under.special privileges^ and was there known by the name of Sister MadeHne. * - * ' > '»'> The intercourse of the Sister MadeHne with the Lady Abbess was free and unreserved. At aU hours they entered each other's rooms with the famiHa- o
nty of sisters; nnd it might hav o been thought thut- in^tjvery respect they stood upon the equal footing of near relatives, except that occasionally in the manners of tho, Abbess was traced or imagined a secret air of deference towards the desolate Sister Madeline, which, as it was not countenanced at all by their present relations to each other, left people ut liberty to build upon it a large superstructure of lomantic conjectures. Sister Madeline n as as regular in her attendance upon prayers as Paulina. There, if nowhere eke, they were sure of meeting; and in no long time it became evident that the younger lady «.is an object of particular interest to the elder. When the sub¬ lime fugues of the old composers for the organ swelled upon the air, and filled the vast aisles of the chapel u ith their floating labyrinths of sound, atten¬ tion to the offices of tho church service being sus¬ pended for tho time, tho Sister Madeline spent the interval in watching the countenance of Paulinu. Invariably at this period her, eyes settled upon the young Countess, and appeared to court some return of attention, by the tender si mpathy which her ov n features expressed with tlie grief too legibly inscribed 1 '■ i > ■ p Tt 11 'lilt iTi ( D H II -U! 1° ' upon PauHna's. For some time Paulina, absorbed i , ,] , i nt.
KLOSTE2MIEIM." by tier own thoughts, failed to notice this'very'paV- ticular expression of attention and interest. Accus¬ tomed to the giue of crowds, as well on account' of Her beauty as her connexion ivith "the Imperial house, she found nothing new or distressing in 1 this attention to Herself. After some 'time, however, observing herself still haunted by tho sister's furtive glances, she found hor own curiosity'someuhnt awakened in return. The manners of Sister Made¬ line 11 ere too dignified, and her faco expressed too much of profound feeling, and traces too inextin¬ guishable of the trials thi'ough which she had passed, to allow room for any belief that she was under the influence of an ordinary curiosity. Paulina was struck with a confused feeling,—that she looked upon features whicli had already been faimliar to her heart, though disguised in Sister MadeHne by age, by sex, and by the ravages of grief; she Hud the appearance of having passed her fiftieth year; but it uns probablo that, spite of a brilliant complexion, secret sorrow hud worked a natural effect in giving to her the appearance of age more advanced by i < . i .... i seven or eight years than she had really attained. Time at aU events, if it had carried off for ever her youthful graces, neither hail nor seemed'likely to
destroy the impression of majestic beauty under Eclipse and wane. No one could fail to read the signs by which the finger of nature announces a great destiny, and a mind^born to command. Insensibly the two ladies had estabHshed a sort of intercourse by looks; and at length, upon finding th^t the,sister Madeline mixed no more than her¬ self in the general society ,of Klosterheim, PauHna had resolved to sp,ek the acquaintance of a lady whose department announced that she would prove an interesting acquaintance, whilst her melancholy story and the expression of her looks were a sort of pledges that she would be found a sympathizing friend. She had already taken ^some steps towards the attainment of her^ wishes, when unexpectedly, on coming out from the vesper service, ^he Sister Ma¬ deline iplaced herself by the side of PauHna, and they walked f down one of the long- side aisles to¬ gether. , The saintly memorials about them, the re¬ cords of everlasting peace which lay sculptured at their fee^t, and the strains which stiU ascended to heaven from the organ and ( the white-robed choir,— all speaking; of a res^froin trouble so httle to be found on earth, and so powerfuUy contrasting with
the desolations of poor harassed Germany,—affected them deeply, and both burst into tears. At length. the elder lady spoke. " Daughter, you keep your faith piously ivith him whom you suppose dead." Paulina started. The other continued— " Honour to young hearts that are knit to-' gether by ties so firm 1 that even death has no power to dissolve them ! Honour to the love which can breed so deep a sorrow I Yet, even in this' world, the good are not ahvays tho unhappy.' I 'doubt not that, even now at vespers, you forgot" not'to pray for hira that would wiUingly have died for you." " Oh, gracious lady I' when—when have I forgot that ? What other prayer—what other image—is ever at my heart ?" s ' " Daughter, I could not doubt it; and Heaven sometimes sends answers to prayers when they are least expected; and to yours it sends this through ™«" ii. ■ me. j With these words she stretched out a letter to Paulina, who fainted with sudden surprise and de¬ Hght on'recognising" tHe Hand df MaximiHan'.' * •I "■ ' U* n'.M ' •)( " " t ^iiil t 1 I' I'll i

But she felt that, in this ^-superfluous expression of authority, the Landgrave was ^ at the same time > infringing the rights of hospitaHty, and her own privileges of sex. Indignation at his unmanly conduct gave Her spirits to face Him, though she apprehended a scene of vio¬ lence, and,had the more reason to feel the trepida¬ tions of uncertainty, because she very imperfectly comprehended his purposes as respected herself. These were not eadly expldned. iShe found the Landgrave pacing the room with violence.

The personal'presence of a lady,'so distinguished'in Her appearance as the Lady PauHna, at any resort of conspirators or in¬ triguers, would have pubfished too much the suspi- ~ cions to which' such b countenance would be Hable. But in* ivriting, have you' dispersed nothing calcula¬ ted to alienate the attachment of my subjects ?" 1 The Lady PauHna shook her head; she knew not oven in what direction the Landgrave's suspicions pointed. ' ' " As, f<r example, this—does the Lady Paulina recognise this particular paper ?" ' " Saying tliis, he drew forth from a portfolio a letter or paper of instructions, consisting of several sheets, to which a large official seal was attached. The ' -Countess glanced her eye'Pver it attentively ; in'one 'or two'places the wprds 'Maximilian 'and Kloster¬ ¬heim attracted ber attention;'but she felt satisfied •at'once that'she now saw it for the first time. '* " Of this paper," jshe said at length, in a deter-
mined i tone, ," I know nothing. , The handwriting I believe I may have seen before, i It resemble^that of one of the Emperor's secretaries. ^Beyond that, I have no means of even conjecturmg ( its origin.!',' " Beware, madam, beware how far you (commit yourself. .Suppose now this paper were actually brought in one of your ladyship's .mails, amongst your own private property." , i i < i •' That may very well be," said Lody Paulina, " and yet imply no falsehood on my part., False¬ hood I I disdain such an insinuation; your Highness has been the first person who ever dared tojnake it." At that moment she called to mind the robbery of her carnage at Waldenhausen. Colouring deeply i\ith indignation, she added, « Even in the case, sir, which you havo supposed, as unconscious bearer of this or any othe. 1 paper, I am still innocent of the intentions which such an act might argue in some people. I am as incapable of offending in that way, a3 I shaU always be of disavowing any of my own acts, according to your ungenerous insinuation. But now, sir, teU me Jiow far those may be innocent who Hays possessed themselves of a paper carried, as your Highness aUeges;, among my private baggage 3 Was « ii i i i .hi ' In i- i s t ii v
it for a Prince to countenance a robbery of that na¬ ture] or to appropriate its spoils ?" •> The blood rushed to the Landgrave's temples. « In i these times, young lady, petty rights of indi¬ viduals give way,to state necessities. Neither aie there any such rights of individuals in bar of such an inquisition. They'are forfeited, as I told you before, when the guest forgets his duties. But," v (and here he frowned) " it seems to me, Countess, ~ that you are uow forgetting youi' situation; not I, remember, but yourself, are now placed on trial." " Indeed I" said the Countess, " of that I wns certainly not aware! Who, then, is my accuser, who my judge ? Or is it in your Serene Highness that I see both?" ( " Your accuser, Lady Paulina, is the paper I have shewn you, a treasonable paper. Peihaps I have others to bring forward of the same bearing. Perhaps this is sufficient." r The Lady Paulina grew suddenly sad and thought¬ ful. Here waa a tyrant, with matter against her, which, even to an unprejudiced judge, might really wear some face of plausibility! The paper had per haps 'really been one of those plundered from her carriage. ' It might really contain matter fitted to
excite disaffection: agdnst the^andgrave's govern¬ ment. Her own innocence of dl participation, in the designs which it purposed to abet might findmo credit; or might avdl.her not at all in a situation so far removed from the Imperid protection. She had in fact unadvisedly entered a city, ivHich, at the. time of Her entrance, might be looked uponjas neu¬ tral, but since then had been forced into the ranks of the Emperor's enemies, too abruptly to aUow ofi warning or. retreat. This was Her, exact situation. She saw her danger ; and again apprehended that, at the i ery moment of recovering her lover from the midst of perils besetting his situation, she might i lose him by the perils of Her own. •„ i t , Tlie Landgrave watched the changes of her coun-, tenance, and read hei' thoughts.. , ^ " Yes," he said,iat length, " your situation is one of peril. But take courage. Confess freely, and you. i have every thing to hope for froimmy clemency.". " Such clemency," said a. deep .voice, from! some remote quarter, of the* room, « as the wolf shews to the Iamb." t ii.p.i PauHna started, and the Landgrave lookeiLangry and perplexed., i e Within there I" he cried loudly to the attendants in the next room. " I wiU no more
endure these insults," he'exclaimed. " Go instantly* takd a file of soldiers; place them at all the outlets, and 1 search the rooms adjoining—above, ond below. Such mummery is insufferable." ' The voice replied again, "Landgrave, you search in vain. Look toyourself 1 young Max is upon you 1" « This babbler," said the Landgrave, making an effort to recover his coolness, " reminds me well; that adventurer^ young Maximilian—Who is he, whence comes he ? by whom authorized ?" Paulina blushed; but, roused by the Landgrave's contumelious expressions applied to her lover, she replied—" He is no adventurer; nor was ever in that class ; the Emperor's favour is not bestowed upon such." " Then, what brings him to Klosteiheim ? For what is it that he woidd trouble the lepose of this city ?" Before Paulina could speak in rejoinder, the voice, from a little further distance, replied audibly—" For his rights I See that you, Landgrave, make no re¬ sistance." The Prince arose in fury; his eyes flashed fire, he clenched his hands in impotent determination. The same voice had annoyed him on former occasion&,
but never under circumstances wluqh mortified him so deeply. Ashamed that the youthful Countess should be a witness of the insults put upon him, jtnd seeing that it ivas in vain to pursue his conver¬ sation with her further in a situation which exposed him to the sarcasms of a third person, under no re¬ straint of fear or paitiaHty, he adjourned the further prosecution of his enquiry to another opportunity. and for the present gave her leave to depart; a li¬ cense which she glady avaded herself of, and retired in fear and perplexity.
CHAPTER XIX. It was dark as Paulina returned to her convent. Two servants of the Landgrave's preceded her with torches to the great gates of St Agnes, which was at a very short distance. At that point she entered within the shelter of the convent gates, and the Prince's servants left her at her own request. No person was now within call but a little page of her own, andperhapsthe porter at the convent. But after the first turn in the garden of St Agnes, she might almost consider herself as left to her own guardian¬ ship ; for the little boy, who followed her, was too young to afford her any effectual help. She felt sorry, as she surveyed thelongavenue of ancient trees, which was yet to be traversed before she entered upon the cloisters, that she should have dismissed the servants of the Landgrave. These gardens were easdy scaled from the outside, and a ready communication ex-
isted between the remotest parts of this veiy ave¬ nue, and some of the least reputable parts of Klos¬ terheim. The city now overflowed with people of every rank; and amongst them were continuaUy recognised, and occasionaUy chaUcnged, some of the vdest deserters from the Imperid ca.mps. Wdlen- stein himself, and other Imperid commanders, but, above aU, Hoik, had attracted to their,standards the very refuse of the German jdls; and dlow- mg an unHmited Hcense of plunder dming some pe¬ riods of their career, had themselves evoked a fiend¬ ish spirit of lawless aggression and spoHation, which aftenvards they Had found it impossible to exorcise ivithin its former limits. People were every where obliged to be on theirguard, not alone (as heretofore) against the miHtary tyrant or freebooter, but also against the private servants whom they hired into their service. For some time back, suspicious per¬ sons had been seen strolHng at dusk in the gardens of St Agnes, or .even intruding into the cloisters. Then the recoUeetion of The Masque, now in the very height of his mysterious career, flashed upon PauHna's thoughts. Who knew his motives, or the principle of his mysterious warfare—which at any p
rate, in its mode, had latterly been marked by blood¬ shed ? As these things came rapidly into her mind, she trembled more from fear, than from the wintry wind, which now blew keenly and gustily through the avenue. • The gardens of St Agnes were extensive, and Paulina yet wanted two hundred yards of reaching the cloisters, when she observed a dusky object steah'ng along the margin of a Httle pool, which in parts lay open to the walk, whilst in others, where the walk receded from the water, the banks were studded with thickets of taU shrubs. Paulina stopped and observed the figure, which, she was soon satis¬ fied must be that of a man- At times he rose to his full height; at times he cowered downwards 'amongst the bushes. That he was not merely seek¬ ing a retreat, became evident from this, that the best road for such a purpose lay open to him in the ■opposite direction;—that .he was watching herself also, became probable from the way in which he -seemed to regulate his own motions by hers. At length, whilst PauHna hesitated in some perplexity whether to go forward, or to retreat towards the porter's lodge, he suddenly plunged into the thickest
belt of shrubs,' and left'the road clear. ' PauHna seized the moment,' arid'with'a 'palpitating heart qdckened her steps towards 1 'the cloister.' 1 ' She had cleared about'one'holf of the way with¬ out obstruction, when suddenly a powerful 'grasp seized her by the shodderi ' ''" '' s l " Stop, lady 1" said a deep'coarse voiced " stop ! I mean no harm. Perhaps I bring your ladyship what wUl be welcome news." " But wliy here ?" exclaimed PauHna; " where¬ fore do you alarm me' thus ? Oh I heavens ! your eyes are wild and fierce ;' say, is it money that you want ?" " Perhaps I do.' To the'Hke of me, lady, you may be sure that money never comes amiss;—but that is 'not my errand. Here is what'wiU make aU clear;"—and, as he spoke, he thrust his hand into the huge pocket within the horseman's cloak which enveloped him. Instead of the pistol or dag, which Padina anticipated,' he drew forth a large packet, carefully sealed!"' PauHna felt so much relieved at beholding this pledge of the man's pacific intentions, that she eagerly pressed her purse into his hand, and was hastening to leave him, when the mnn
stopped her to deliver a verbal message from his master, requesting earnestly that, if she concluded to keep the appointment arranged in the letter, she would not be a minute later than the time fixed. " And who," sdd Paulina, " is your master ?" " Surely the General, madam—the young Gene¬ ral MaximiHan. Many a time and oft have I waited on him when visiting your ladyship at the Warte- brunn. But here I dare not show my face. Der Henker! if the Landgrave knew that Michael Klotz was in Klosterheim, I reckon that aU the ladies in St Agnes could not beg him a reprieve tiU to-mor¬ row morning." " Then, villain I" sdd the foremost of two men who rushed Hastily from the adjoining shrubs, " be assured that the Landgrave does know it. Let this be your warrant I" With these words He fired, and, immediatdy after, his comrade. Whether the fugi¬ tive were wounded could not be knoivn; for he instantly plunged into the water, and, after two or three moments, was Heard upon the opposite margin. His pursuers seemed to shrink from this attempt, for they divided and took the opposite ex¬ tremities of the pool, from the other bank of which
they were soon Heard animating and directing each other through the darkness. PauHna, confused and agitated, and anxious above all to examine her letters, took the opportunity of a clear road, and fled in trepidation to the convent.

The nccompanyingiletter sufficiently!explained its purpose.' "i iii l jiff on di i">' iui If »,i It was in thei handwriting, andilbore thei signa¬ ture, of Maximilian. ; iln>a few, words.-he ( told,her that a sudden*communication,(but fronx a quarter entirely to be depended ion? laad reached him of a
great danger impending over her from tho Land¬ grave ; that in the present submission of Kloster¬ heim to that Prince's will, instant flight presented the sole means of delivering her; for which purpose he would himself meet her in disguise on the foHow- ing morning, as early as four o'clock; or, if that should prove impossible under the circumstances of the case, would send a faithful servant;—that one or other of them would attend at a particular station, easily recognised by the description added, in a ruinous part of the boundary waU, in the rear of the convent garden. A large traveUing cloak would be brought to draw over the rest of her dress; but meanwhile, as a means of passing unobserved through the convent grounds, where the Landgrave's agents were continually watching her motions, the nun's veil was almost indispensable. The other circum¬ stances of the journey would be communicated to her upon meeting. In conclusion, the writer im¬ plored Paulina to suffer no scruples of false delicacy to withhold her from a step which had so suddenly become necessary to her preservation; and cautioned her particularly against communicating her inten¬ tions to the Lady Abbess, whose sense of decorum
might lead her to urge advice at this moment in¬ consistent with her safety. Againiand again did Paulina read this agitating letter; again and again did she scrutimze the hand¬ writing, apprehensive that she might be making him¬ self a dupe to i some hidden enemy. The hand¬ writing,, undoubtedly, had not all the natural i free¬ dom "which'characterised that of MaximUian—it was somewhat stiff in its movement, but not more so than that of his previous letter, in which he had accounted for the slight change from a wound not perfectly healed in his right hand. In other respects, the letter seemed Hable to no just suspicion. The danger apprehended from the Landgrave taUied with her own knowledge. The convent grounds were certdnly haunted, as the letter dleged, by the Land¬ grave's people,—of that she had just received a con¬ vincing proof; for, though the two strangers had turned off in pursdt of the messenger who bore MaximiHan's letter, yetudoubtless their origind object of attention had been herself; they were then posted to watch her motions, and they had avowed themselves in effect the Landgraves people. That part of the advice, agdn, which respected the
Lady Abbess, seemed judicious, on'considering the character of that lady, however much at first sight it might warrant some jealousy of the writer's pur¬ poses, to find him warning her against hen best friends. After all, what most disturbed'the con¬ fidence of Paulina was the countenance of the man who presented the letter; if this man were ta be the representative of Maximilian on the following morning, she felt, and was persuaded that she would continue to feel, an invincible repugnance to com¬ mit her safety to any such keeping. 'Upon"the whole, she resolved to keep the appointment, but to be guided in her further conduct by circumstances as they should arise at the moment. ■ i "»' ' That night Paulina's favourite female attendant employed herself in putting into as small a compass as'possible the slender wardrobe which they would be able to carry with them. The young Countess herself spent the hours in ivriting to the Lady Abbess and Sister Madeline, acquainting them ivith all the circumstances of her interview with the Landgrave,—the certain grounds she had for ap¬ prehending some great danger in that quorter,—and the proposals so unexpectedly made to her on the
part of MaximiHan for evading it. To ask that they should feel no anxiety on her account, in times which made even a successful escape from danger so very hazardous, she acknowledged would be vain ; but, in judging of the degree of prudence which she had exhibited on this occasion, she begged them to reflect on^the certain dangers which awaited her from the Landgrave; and finally, in excuse for not having- sought tho advice of so dear a friend as the Lady Abbess, slie enclosed the letter upon which she had acted. < These preparations were completed by midnight, after which Paulina sought an hour or two of re¬ pose. At three o'clock were celebrated the early matins, attended by the devouter part of the sister¬ hood, in the chapel. Paulina and her maid took this opportunity for leaving their chamber, and sUpping unobserved amongst the crowd who were hurrying on that summons into the cloisters. The organ was pealing solemnly through the labyrinth of passages wliich led from the interior of the convent; and PauHna's eyes were suffused with tears, as the gen¬ tler recollections of her earlier days, and the peuce which belongs to those'who have abjured this world
and its treacherous promises, arose to her mind, under the influence of the subHme music, in power¬ ful contrast with the tempestuous troubles of Ger¬ many—now become so comprehensive in their deso¬ lating sweep, as to involve even herself, and others of station as elevated.
CHAPTER XXI. The convent clock, chiming the quarters, at length announced that they had reached the ap¬ pointed hour. Trembling with fear and cold, though mufHed up in furs, PauHna and her attendant, with their nuns' veUs draivn over their head-dress, sal- Hed forth into the garden. AU was profoundly dark, and overspread \\ ith the stiUness of the grave. The Hghtt* within the chapel threw a rich glow through the painted ivindows; and here and there, from a few scattered casements in the vast pile of St Agnes, streamed a few weak rays from a taper or a lamp, indicating the trouble of a sick-bed, or tho peace of prayer. But these rare lights did but deepen the massy darkness of aU beside; and Paulina, with her attendant, had much difficulty in making her way to the appointed station. Having reached the waU, however, they pursued its windings, certain of meet-
ing no'important obstacles, until they attained a part where their progress was impeded by frequent dilapidations. Here they halted, and in low tones communicated their doubts about the precise locality of the station indicated in the letter, when suddenly a mau started up from the ground, and greeted them with the words, " St Agnes t all is right," which had been preconcerted as the signal in the letter. This man was courteous and respectful in his man¬ ner of speaking, and had nothing of the ruffian voice which belonged to the bearer of the letter. In rapid terms he assured Paulina, that " the Young General" had not found cnxnmstances favourable for venturing within the walls, but that he would meet her a few miles beyond the city gates; and that at present they had no time to lose. Saying this, he unshaded a dark lantern, which showed them a ladder of ropes, attached to the summit of a wall, wliich at this point was too low to occasion them much uneasiness or difficulty in ascending 1 . But Paulina insisted previously on hearing something more circumstantial of the manner and style of their escape from the city walls, and in what com¬ pany their journey would be performed. The man
had dready done something to concUiato PauHna's confidence by the propriety of his address, which indicated a superior education, and habits of inter¬ course with people of rank, Ho explained as much of the plan as seemed necessary for the immediate occasion. A convoy of arms and miHtary stores ivas leaving the city for the post at Falkenstein. Several carriages, containing privileged persons, to whom the Landgrave or his minister hod granted a license, were taking the benefit of an escort over the forest; ond a bribe in the proper quarter had easUy obtained permission, from the officer on duty at tbe gates, to suffer an additional carriage to pass as one in a great lady's suite, on the simple condi¬ tion that it shodd contain none but fomales ; as persons of that sex wero liable to no suspicion of being fugitives from the wrath which was now sup¬ posed ready to descend upon the conspirators against the Landgrave. This explanation reconcUed PauHna to the scheme. SUe felt cheered by the prospect of Having other ladies to countenance the mode of her nocturnal journey; and at the worst, hearing this renewed mention of conspirators and punishment, which
easily connected itself with all that had passed in her interview with tho Landgrave, she felt assured, nt any rate, that the dangers she fled from, tran¬ scended any which sho was Hkely to incur upon her route. Her determination was immediately taken. She passed over the wall with her attendant; and they found themselves iu a narrow lane, close to the city ivalls, with none but a few ruinous outhouses on either side. A low whistle from the man ivas soon answered by the rumbling of wheels; and from some distance, as it seemed, a sort of calecho advanced, drawn by a pair of horses. PauHna and her attend¬ ant stepped hastily in, for at the very moment when the carriage drew up, a signal gun was heard; which, ns their guido assured them, proclaimed tha c .the escort and tbe ivhole train of carriages were ai that moment defiling from the city gate. The dri7er, obeying the directions of the other man, drcve off as rapidly as the narrow road and the darkness would allow. A few turns brought them into the^great square in front of the schloss } from which, a few more open streets, traversed atfuU gallop, soon brought them into the rear of the convoy,.which had been unexpectedly embarrassed in its progress
to the gate., From the rear, by dexterous manage¬ ment, they gradually insinuated themselves into tho centro; and, contrary to then: expectations, ampngst the press of baggage-waggons, artillery, and travd- ling equipages, dl tumultuously clamouring to push on, as the best chance of evading Holkerstein in the forest, their own unpretending vehicle passed with¬ out other notice than a curse'from the officer on duty; which, however, they, could not presume to appropriate, as it might be supposed equitably dis¬ tributed amongst dl who stopped the road at the moment. > ' 'PauHna shuddered as she looked out upon the line > of fierce faces, Uluminated by the glare of torches, and mingling with Horses' heads, and the gleam of sabres;, all around her, the roar of artillery wheels; above her head, the vast arch of the gates, its broad massy shadows resting below; and in the vista beyond, which the archway defined, a mass of blackness in which she rather imagined than saw the ^terminable soHtudes of the forest. Soon the gate was closed ;> their own. carriage passed the tardier parts of the convoy; and, ivith a dozen or two of others, surrounded by a squadron of dra-
goons, headed the train. Happy beyond measure at the certainty that she had now cleared the gates of Klosterheim, that she was in the wide open forest —free from a detested tyrant, and on the same side of the gates as her lover, who was doubtless advan¬ cing to meet her—she threw herself back in the carriage, and resigned herself to a slumber, which the anxieties and watchings of the night had made more than usuaUy welcome. The city clocks were now heard in +he forest, solemnly knelHng out the hour of four. Hardly, hoivever, had PauHna slept an hour, when she was gently awaked by her attendant—who had felt it to be her duty to apprise her lady of tho change, which had occurred in their situation. They had stopped, it seemed, to attach a pair of leaders to their wheel horses; and were now advancing at a thundering pace, separated from the rest of the con¬ voy, and surrounded by a small escort of cavalry. The darkness was still intense; and the Hghts of Klosterheim, which the frequent windings of the road brought often into view, were at this moment conspicuously seen. The castle, from its command-. ing position, and the convent of St Agnes, were, Q
both easily traced out by means of the Hghts gleam¬ ing frpm,their longiranges of upper windows." A particular^ turret, which sprung to aa almost aerial altitude above ( the rest of x the building, in which it was generally reported that the Landgrave slept, was more distinguishable than any other port of Klosterheim, from one briUiant lustre which shot its rays'through a large oriel window. There at this moment was sleeping that unhappy prince, tyrannical and self-tormenting, whose unmanly fears had menaced her. own innocence ivith so much in¬ definite danger ; whom, in escaping, she knew not if she had escaped; and whose snares, as a rueful misgiving began to suggest, were perhaps gathering faster about her, with every echo which the startled forest returnedto the resounding tread of their flying cavalcade^ She leaned back again in the carriage; again she'feU asleep ; again she dreamed. But her sleep was unrefreshing; her. dreams were agitated, confused, and haunted by terrific images. And she awoke repeatedly with her cheerful anticipation con^ tinuolly decaying of speedily (perhaps ever again) rejoining her gaUant Maximilian. There was in¬ deed'yet a possibiHty that she might be under the

superintending care of her lover." But she'secretly felt that she was betrayed. And sKe wep'twHeti'sHe' reflected that her own precipitance' had fucilitate'd! the accomph'shment of the plot which hdd'perHap's' for ever ruined her happiness.'" '■ *' ! ''' <''' ' >
CHAPpR XXL, Meantime, Paulina awoke from the troubled slum- bers inlo which her fatigues had thrown her, to find herself stil^flying along as, rapidly as, four powerful horses could,draw,their h'e-ht burden, and still escort- ed by a, considerable body of the .Landgrave's dra- ' (• * I l<W '.!■ >l)l I I )1 * i (j I O goong. | She,wfjs undoubtedly separated from all the rest of the conyoy, with whom she had left Kloster¬ heim.

Certainly the dangers from which she, fled .were great and immi- O ^t(i~ A , r v ■ ' i-iVif I ,l I i°ili|/ i i ' nent5je^,still, { in Klosterheim, ; she ^erived some protection, from the favour ,of the. Lady j Abbess. That lady had great powers of a legal nature throughout the city, and still greater.influence with a Roman Catholic populace at this particular period,
when their Prince had laid himself open to suspicions of favouring Protestant allies; and Paulina bitterly bewailed the imprudence, which, in removing her from the convent of St Agnes, had removed her from her only friends. It was about noon, when the party halted at a solitary house for rest and refreshments. Paulina had heard nothing of the route which they had hitherto taken, nor did she find it easy to collect, from the short and churlish responses of her escort to the few questions she had yet ventured to pro¬ pose, in what direction their future advance would proceed. A hasty summons bade her alight; and a few steps, under the guidance of a trooper, brought her into a little gloomy wainscoted room, where some refreshments had been already spread upon a table. Adjoining was a small bed-room. And she was desired, with something more civility than she had yet experienced, to consider both as allotted for the use of herself and servant during the time of their stay, which was expected, however, not to exceed the two or three hours requisite for resting the horses. But that was an arrangement which depended as
riiiich ! 'Upori J others as' themselves/ And in fact a small'fVity, 1 whom ; the main body of the escort 1 had sent^on'to'potrole'the roads in advance, soon re¬ turned with'the unwelcome news that a formidable corps I of 'Imperialists were ! out reconnoitring in a direction which ^might probably lead them across their clwW-line of 'march, in the 1 event of their pro- ceedirijr 1 'instantly. lS The 1 orders already issued for advance were therefore countermanded 1 ; and a reso¬ lution was at 'length adopted by the leader of the party for lakihgiip their abode 'during 'the'night in their present'very tolerable quarters. Paulina, weariedjmd dejected, and recoihng natu¬ rally'from the indefinite prospects df danger before her,'was riotffche 'least rejoiced tat this change'in the original plan 1 , by'which she 'benefited at any rate to the l 'e'itent of a 1 quiet'shelter for one night more, a blessing*'which the'next day's' adventures might deny ieri ( aftd still more by tliat postponement of inip'eliding^evil whicli ia so' often welcome to the verj^firme'sfc minds" when exhausted b'y toil and affliction'.'' 'Having 'thikcertairity,' however, of one night's 'continuance ra her present abode, she re¬ quested td'haVe the .room made a little more com-

No evil would arise to any party from their present detention in a place'where they were little 'Hkely to'' attract notice from any body,'but the old lady in her ministries upon'the fire.' Suspicion would be'dso turned aside from herself in appropriating the few papera which re-
moined. ' These contained too (frequent mention of amameuearto Herself, not ito have a considerable value in I her eyes; 'she was resolved, if possible, to carry them off Sby. concealing them within her bo¬ som ; but at aU events, iin preparation for any mis¬ fortune that might ultimately compel her to resign tbem, she determined without loss of time to make herself mistress of their contents. ' > One, and the most important of these documents, was a long, and confidential letter from the Empe¬ ror to the Town-Council and the chief Heads of con¬ ventual houses in' Klosterheim. It contained a ra¬ pid summary of'the principal events in her lover's life, ( from His infancy, when some dreadful domes¬ tic tragedy Had* thrown him upon the Emperor's protection,' to his present period of'early manhood, when his own sword.and distinguished talents had raised him to a- briUiant name and a high miHtary rank in the Imperial service. What were the circum¬ stances of that'tragedy, as d case sufficiently! well known to those whom.'he addressed, or to (be col¬ lected from accompanying papers,'the Emperor did not say. But he lavished every variety of praise upon Maximilian, .with a Hberality that won tears
of deHght from the solitary young lady, as she now sat at i midnight looking over these gracious testi¬ monies to her lover's merit. A theme, so deHghtful to PauHna, could not be unseasonable' at any time; audi never did her thoughts revert to him more fondly than at this moment, when she so much needed his protecting arm. Yet, 4he Emperor, she was aware, must have some more'special motive for enlarging upon this topic, thau his general favour to 'Maximilian. What thisi could be iin a case so closely connecting the parties to the 1 correspon¬ dence on both sides with Klosterheim, i a Httle in¬ terested her curiosity, i And, pm looking more nar¬ rowly at the accompanying documents, in one which had been most pointedly ^referred to by the Empe¬ ror, she found some disclosures on the subject of her lover's early misfortunes, which,, whilst they filled her with horror and astonishment, elevated the na¬ tural pretensions of MaximiHan in point of birth and descent more nearly to a level with the splen¬ dour of his self-created distinctions; and thus crowned him, who already lived in her apprehen¬ sion as the very model of a hero, with the only ad¬ vantages that he had ever been supposed to want—
the interest which attaches to unmerited misfor¬ tunes, and the splendour ofan illustrious descent. As she thus sat, absorbed in the story of her lover's early misfortunes, a murmuring sound of talking attracted her ear, apparently issuing from the closet. Hastily throwing open the door, she found that a thin wooden partition, veined with numerous chinks, was the sole separation between the closet and an adjoining bed-room. The words were startling, incoherent, and at times raving. Evi¬ dently they proceeded from some patient stretched on a bed of sickness, and dealing with a sort of hor¬ rors in his distempered fancy, worse, it was to be hoped, than any which the records of his own re¬ membrance could bring' before him. Sometimes he spoke in the character of one who chases a deer in a forest; sometimes he was close upon the haunches of his game; sometimes it seemed on the point of escaping him. Then the nature of the game changed utterly, and became something human; and a com¬ panion was suddenly at his side. With him he quarreUed fiercely about their share in the pursuit and capture. " Oh, my lord, you must not deny it. Look, look! your hands are bloodier than mine.
Fie ! fie! is there no runmng water in the forest ? —So young as He is, and so noble I—Stand 'off! he ivUl cover us oU ivith 'his blood P-Oh, what a groan was that 1'It iviU have''broke'somebody's heart-strings I think! It ivould Have' broken mine when I was younger. But these' wars make us'aU cruel.' Yet you are worse'than lam."' Then again, after a pause, the patient seemed to start up"in bed, and he cried out convulsively— '-" Give me my share, I say. Wherefore'must my share'be so'smdl?— There he comes ipast again.' 1 Now strike/tiow,' ^ow, now I Get his head down,'my lord. 1 —He's'off, by G—! Now, if he*gets out 'of the 'forest,- two 'hours will take him' to Vienna, i And we mu3t go td Rome; where else could'ive'get absolution? 'Oh, Heavens! the forest is'full'of bloody weU-mayour Hands be bloody, f I see flowers all theiway to Vienna:' but there is blood 'below t- oh, what a depth! what a depth I—Oh I-Heart, hedrtrt—See Howlie' starts up from his ldr!—OK! your 'Highness' ( has deceived mo ! Thpre are a thousand upon one man !" In such terms he continued to rave, untU Pau¬ lina's mind ivas so much harassed with the constant succession of dreadful images, and frenzied ejacula-
tions/ all making- report of a Hfe passed in scenes of horror,* bloodshed, and violence, that at length, for her'own relief, she was obliged to close the door; through which, however, at intervals, piercing shrieks or half-stifled curses stUl continued to find their way. It struck her as a remarkable coinci¬ dence, that something Hke a slender thread of con¬ nexion might be found between the dreadful story narrated in the Imperial document, and tho deH- rious ravings of this poor wretched creature, to whom accident had made her a neighbour for a single night. Early the next morning, PauHna and her ser¬ vant were summoned to resume their journey; and three hours more of rapid travelling brought them tothe froivning- fortress of Lovenstein. Their escort, witH any one of whom they had found but few opportunities of communicating, had shown them¬ selves throughout gloomy and obstinately silent. They knew not, therefore, to what distance their journey extended. But from the elaborate ceremo¬ nies ivith which they were here received, and the formal receipt for their persons, which was draivn
up and delivered by the governor to the officer, commanding their escort, Paulina judged that.the- castle of Lovenstein would prove to be their final destination.
CHAPTER XXII. Two days elapsed without any chauge in Pau¬ lina's situation, as she found it arranged upon her first arrival at Lovenstein. Her rooms were not in¬ commodious ; but the massy barricades at the doors, the grated windows, and the sentinels who mounted guard upon all tho avenues which led to her apart¬ ments, satisfied her sufficiently that she was a pri¬ soner. The third morning after her arrival brought her a still more unwelcome proof of this melancholy truth, in the summons which she received to attend a court of criminal justice on the succeeding day, c mnectcd ivith the tenor of its language. Her heart died ivithin her as she found herself called upon to answer as a delinquent on a charge of treasonable conspiracy with various members of the university of Klosterheim, against the sovereign prince, the
Landgrave of X------. Witnesses in exculpation, whom could she produce ? Or how defend herself before a tribunal where all aHke, judge, evidence, accuser, were in effect one and the same mah'gnant enemy ?—In what way she could have come to be connected in tho Landgrave's mind with a charge of treason against His princely rights, she found it difficult to oxpldn, unless the mere fact of having earned the Imperial despatches in the trunks about her carriages, were sufficient to impHcate Her as a secret emissary or agent concerned in the Imperial diplomacy. But she strongly suspected that some deep misapprehension existed in the Landgrave's mind; and its origin, she fancied, might be found in the refined knavery of their ruffian host at Wdden- hausen, in malting his market of the papers which he had purloined. Bringing them fonvard sepa¬ rately and by piece-meal, he had probably hoped to receive so many separate rewards. But, as it would often happen that one paper was necessary in the way of explanation to another, and the whole, per¬ haps, were dmost essential to the proper under¬ standing of any one, the result would inevitably be —grievously to mislead the Landgrave. Further R
communications, indeed, would have tended to dis¬ abuse the Prince of any delusions raised in this way. But it was probable, as PauHna had recently learned in passing through Wddenhausen, that the ruffian's iUness and delirium had put a stop to any further commumcation of papers; and thus the misconcep¬ tions, which he Had'caused, were perpetuated in the Landgrave's mind. < ' It was on the third day after Paulina's arrivd, that she was first placed before the court. The predding officer in this tribunal was the governor of the fortress, a tried soldior, but a ruffian of low habits and cruel nature. He had risen under the Landgrave's patronage as an adventurer of desperate courage, ready for any service, however disreputable, careless aHke of peril or of infamy. In common with manyportisan officers, who had sprungfromthe ranks in this adventurous war, seeing on every side and in the highest quarters, princes as weU as supreme commanders, the uttermost contempt of justice and moral principle,—he had'fought his way to distinc¬ tion and fortune, through every species of ignoble cruelty. He had passed from service to service, as He saw an opening for his own pecuHar interest or
ment, everywhere valued as a soldier of j desperate enterprise, everywhere abhorred as a man*. jBy birth u Croatian, he had exhibited himself as one of' the most saiage leaders of that order* ofnbarbarians in the sack of Mcgdeburgh, where r he served ^under TiUy: but, latterly, he had)taken service again under his original patron the Landgravo,'who had lured him back to his interest by the rank of general and the governorship of Lovestein.i >" i This brutal'officer, who) had 'latterly<Hved in u btate of continual intoxication, ivas the judge 'before whom the lovely and'innocent'PauHna wasf now arraigned on a charge'affecting'her life.' In fact, it became obvious that the process was not designed for any other purpose than to save appearances,—and, if that shouldiseem possible,<to extract further dis¬ coveries from Jhe prisoner. > The .general acted as supreme^ arbiter in everyi question of rights and power that arose /to tho court in, the administration of their almost lunHmitedi functions, i Doubts he allowed ofjnonej; andicut every knot of 'jurispru¬ dence, whether! form or substance, by his Croatian sabre. Two assessors, however, he wiUingly recei¬ ved upon his bench of justice, to relieve him from
the fatigue nnd difficulty of conducting a perplexed examination. These assessors were lawyers of a low class, who tempered the exercise of their officiid duties with as few scruples of justice, and as little regard to the restraints of courtesy, as their military principal. The three judges were almost equally ferocious, and tools equally abject of the unprincipled sovereign whom they served. A tovereign, however, he was; and Paulina was well aware that in his own states he had the power of life and death. She had good reason to see that her own death was resolved on; still she neglected no means of honourable self-defence., In a tone of mingled sweetness and dignity she maintained her innocence of all that was alleged against her; pro¬ tested that she was unacquainted with the tenor of any papers which might have been found in her trunks; and claimed her privilege, as a subject of the Emperor, in bar of all right on the Landgrave's part to call her to account. These pleas were overruled, ' ! lit i , and when she further acquainted the court that she was a near relative of the Emperor's, and ventured to hint at the vengeance with which his Imperial
Majesty would not fail to visit so bloody a contempt of justice, sho was surprised to find this menace treated with mockery and laughter. In reaHty, the long habit of fighting for and agdnst aU the Princes of Germany, had given to tho Croatian general a disregard for any of them, except on the single con¬ sideration of receiving his pay at the moment; and a single circumstance unknown to Paulina, in the final determination of the Landgrave, to earn a merit with his Swedish alHes by breaking off all terms of reserve or compromise ivith the Imperial court, impressed a savage desperation on the tone of that Prince's poHcy at this particular time. The Landgrave had resolved to stake his aU upon a single throw. A battle was now expected, which, if fa¬ vourable to the Swedes, would lay open the road to Vienna. The Landgrave was prepared to abide the issue; not, perhaps, wholly uninfluenced to so ex¬ treme a course by the very paper which had been robbed from PauHna. His policy was knoivn to his agents, and conspicuously influenced their manner of receiving her menace. Menaces, they informed hor, came ivith better grace from tliose who had the power to enforce
them; and with a brutal scoff the Croatian bade Her merit tbdr indulgence by frank discoveries and voluntary confessions. Ho insisted on knowing the nature of the connexion wliich the Imperial Colonel of horse, MaximiHan, had mdntained with the students of'Klosterheim';' and upon other dis¬ coveries, with respect to most of which PauHna was 'too f( imperfectly informed Herself to be copable of , giving"ariy ) H'ght. l!l> Her l earnest declarations to this ' 'effect were 1 treated With disregard. * She was dismissed f; for'the present;'but'ivith'an intimation that on the ' moi'iw'she'must prepare herself with' a more com- 'plying'temper/'or ivith'a'sort'of'firmness in mdn- l! taining" Her resolutioni' which" would not perhaps 'long resist'thW ineans which'the' Whad placed •^at'their dispbsd'fbr'dealing with fhtf refractory and 'obstinate.'
CHAPTER XXIII. Paulina meditated earnestly upon the import of this parting threat. The more,sho considered it, the less could she doubt that these fierce inquisitors had meant to threaten,, her, with [torture. r She felt the whole indignity >q£ such a threat, though she could hardly bripg herself tq believe them in earnest. Ou the following,morning she was summoned early before her; judges. They had'not yet assem¬ bled; but some of the lower, officials were pacing up and down, exchanging unintelligible jokes, look¬ ing sometimes at herself, sometimes at an iron ma¬ chine, with a complex arrangement of wheels and screws. Dark were the suspicions which assaulted Paulina as this framework, or couch of iron, first met her eyes—and perhaps some of the jests circu¬ lating amongst the brutal ministers of her brutal judges would have been intelligible enough, had
she condescended to turn her attention in that direc¬ tion. Meantime her doubts wero otherwise dispersed The Croatian officer now entered tho room alone, his assessors having probably decHned participation in that part of the horrid functions which remdned under the Landgrave's commission. This man, presenting a paper with a long Hst of interrogatories to PauHna, bade her now rehearse verbaUy the sum of tho answers which she designed to give. Running rapidly through them, PauHna repHed with dignity, yet trembhng and agitated, that these were questions which in any sense she could not answer—many of them referring to points on which she Had no knowledge, and none of them being consistent with the gratitude and friendship so largely due on her side to the peisons impHcated in the bearing of these questions. ** Then you refuse ?" " Certainly; there are three questions only which it is in my power to answer at dl—even these im¬ perfectly. Answers such as you expect would load me ivith dishonour." " Then you refuse ?" " For the reasons I have stated, undoubtedly I do."
" Once more—you refuse ?" " I refuse, certainly; but do me the justice to re¬ cord my reasons." ' " Reasons I—ha! ha I they had need to bo strong ones if they will hold out against tho arguments of this pretty plaything," laying his hand upon the machine. " However, the choice is yours, not mine." So saying, h s made a sign to the attendants. One began to move the machine, and work the screws or raise the clanking grates and framework, ivith a savage din,—two others bared their arms. PauHna looked on motionless with sudden horror, and pal¬ pitating with fear. The Croatian nodded to the men ; and then in a loud commanding voice exclaimed—" The question in the first degree !" e At this moment Paulina recovered her strength, which the first panic had dispelled. She saw a man approach her with a ferocious grin of exultation. Another, with the same horrid expression of coun¬ tenance, carried a large vase of water. The whole indignity of the scene flashed full upon her mind. She, a lady of the Imperial house,
threatened ivith torture by the base agent of a titled ruffian !' She .who owed Him no duty—had violated no cldm of hospitaHty, though in her,own person dl had been atrociously'outraged! , , Thoughts Hke these flew rapidly .through her brain, when suddenly a door opened behind her. It was an attendant with some implements for tighten¬ ing or rdaxingi bolts. The bare-armed ruffian at this moment raised his arm to seize hers. Shrink¬ ing from the poUution of his accursed touch, PauHna turned hastily round, darted through the open door, and fled, Hke a dove pursued by ndtures, along the passages which stretched before her. .Already she felt their hot breathing upon her neck, already the foremost had raised his handlto -arrest Her, when a sudden turn brought her fuU upon a band of young women, tending upon one of superior rank, mani¬ festly their mistress, i <' v u it, oii i , i ■". Oh, madam I" exclaimed Paulina, "save me I save'me 1"—and with these words feU exhausted at the lady's feet. , * i u •< (u », - > i ^ir < This femde—young,»beautiful, nnd with a touch¬ ing pensiveness of manners—raised Her tenderly in Her arms, and with,a sisterly<tone of offec-
tion bade her fear nothing;—and'the'respectful manner in which tho officials retired at her com¬ mand, satisfied Paulina that she stood in' some very near relation to the Landgrave—in reaHty she soon spoke of him ns Her father. "Is it'possible," thought PauHna to herself, <« that this innocent and lovely child" (for she was not more than seventeen, though with a prematurity of womanly person that raised her to a level ivith PauHna's height) « should owe the affection of a daughter to a tyrant so savage as the Landgrave ?"" ! - '"" I.- 1 ■ She found, hoivever, that the gentle Princess AdeUne owed to'her own childlike simpHcity the best' gift that one so situated could have received from the bounty of Heaven. * THe barbarities exer¬ cised by the Croatian governor, she charged entirely upon his own'brutal nature; and so confirmed was she in this view by PauHna's own'case, that she now resolved upon' executing a resolution she had long projected;' Her father's confidence was basely abused; this she said, and devoutly beUeved. " No part of the truth ever reached 'him; her own letters remained disregarded in in way which was irrecon¬ cilable with the testimonies of profoimd affection
to herself, ddly showered upon her by'his High¬ ness." In reaHty, this sole child of the Landgravo was dso the one sole jewel that gave a vduo in his eyes to hia else desolate life. Every thing in and about the castle of Lovestein was' placed under her abso¬ lute control; even the brutd Croatian governor know that no plea or extremity of circumstances would atone for one act of disobedience to her orders, —and hence it ivas r hat the ministers of this tyrant retired with so much prompt obedience to her com¬ mands. Experience, however, had taught the Princess that, not unfrequently, orders apparently obeyed were aftenvards secretly evaded; and the disregard paid of late to her letters of compldnt, satisfied her that they were stifled and suppressed by the governor. Paulina, therefore, whom a few hours of unrestrain¬ ed intercourse had made interesting to her heart, she would not suffer even to deep npart from her¬ self. Her own agitation on the poor prisoner's be- lidf became greater even than that'of PauHna; and as fresh circumstances of suspicion daily arose in the savage governor's deportment, she now took in
good earnest those measures for escape to Kloster¬ heim which sho had long arranged. In this pur¬ pose she was greatly assisted by the absolute autho¬ rity which her father had conceded to her over every thing but the mere miHtary arrangements in the fortress. Under the colour ofan excursion, such as she had been daUy accustomed to take, she found no difficulty in placing PauHna, suffidentlydisgmsed, amongst her own servants. At a proper point of the road, Paulina and a few attendants, with the Princess herself, issued from their coaches, and bid¬ ding them await their return in half an hour's in¬ terval, by that time were far advanced upon their road to the miHtary post of Fdkenberg.
CHAPTER 5 XXIV„ , In ,twenty days the Myterious Masque had sum¬ moned the Landgrave « to^answer, foricrimes un- atoned, before a tribunal where no power but that of innocence could'avail him." .These days .were nearly expired. The morning of,the Twentieth had arrived.,, , r u <, , t «,. u) , , , t < There were two interpretations of this summons. By many it was believed that the tribunal contem¬ plated was that of the Emperor;, and thatj by some mysterious plot, jWhich could^not be more diffi¬ cult of execution than others which, had actually been accomplished by The Masque, ,on this day the Landgrave would be carried off to Vienna., Others, again, understanding by ithe tribunal, in the same sense, the Imperial chamber of criminal justice, be¬ lieved it possible to fulfil the summons in some way less liable to dslay or uncertainty, than by a long
journey to Vienna, through a country beset ivith enemies. But a third party, differing from both the others, understood by the tribunal where inno¬ cence was the only shield—the judgment seat of heaven; and beUeved that on this day justice would be executed on the Landgrave, for crimes known and unknown, by a pubHc and memorable death. Under any interpretation, however, nobody amongst the citizens codd venture peremptorily to deny, after ' the issue of the masqued baU, and of so" many other pubHc denunciations, that The Masque would keep his word to the letter. > ' It foUowed of necessity that every body was on the tiptoe of suspense, and that the interest hang¬ ing upon the issue of this night's events swaUowed up dl other anxieties, of whatsoever nature. Even the battle, which v -is now daily expected between the Imperid and Swedish armies, ceased to occupy the hearts and conversation of the citizens. Domes¬ tic and pubHc concerns aHke gave way to the coming- catastrophe so solemnly denounced by The Masque. The Landgrave alone maintdned a gloomy re¬ serve, and the expression of a haughty disdain. He had resolved to meet the summons with the Hve-
liest expression of defiance, by fixing this, evening, for a second masqued baU, upon a greater scale than the first. In doing this He acted advisedly, and with the counselor" his Swedish^Uies. They represented to him that the issue of the approaching battle might be reHed upon as pretty nearly certain; aU the indi¬ cations were indeed generaUy thought to promise a decisive turn in their favour; but in the worst case, no defeat of the Swedish army in this war had ever been complete; that the buHc of jthe retreating army, if the Swedes^should be obliged to retreat, would take the road to Klosterheim, and would fur¬ nish to himself a garrison capable of holding the city for many months to come, (and that would not fail to bring many fresh chances, to aU of them,) whilst to his new and cordial aUies this course would offer a secure retreat from pursuing enemies, and a satisfactory proof of his own fideHty. This even in the worst t case; whereas in the better and more pro¬ bable one, of a victory to the Swedes, to maintain the citybutfor aday ortwolonger againstinternal conspi¬ rators, and the secret co-operators outside, would be in effect to ratify any victory which the Siv edes might
gain by putting into their hands at a critical moment one of its most splendid trophie3 and guarantees. These counsels feU too much into the Land¬ grave's own way of thinking to meet with any de¬ murs from him. It was agreed, therefore, that as many Swedish troops as could at this important mo¬ ment be spared, should be introduced into the halls and saloons of the castle, on the eventful evening, disguised as masquers. These were about four hun¬ dred ; and other arrangements were made, equaUy mysterious, and some of them known only to the Landgrave. At seven o'clock, as on the former occasion, the company began to assemble. The same rooms were thrown open; but, as the party was now far more numerous, and was made more comprehensive in point of rank, in order to include all who were in¬ volved in the conspiracy which had been some time maturing ia Klosterheim, fresh suites of rooms were judged necessary, on the pretext of giving fuller ef¬ fect to the princely HospitaHties of the Landgrave. And, on this occasion, according to an old privilege conceded in the case of coronations or gdas of mag¬ nificence, by the Lady Abbess of St Agnes, the par- s
titioa walls were removed between the great hall of the schlossy and the refectory of that immense con¬ vent;} so that the ,two,vast establishments, wliich on^ one .side were contiguous to each other, were thus laid .into one. Tho company had now continued to pour in for two hours. Tho palace and the refectory of the con¬ vent were now overflowing ivith hghts and splendid masques; the avenues and corridors rang: with mu¬ sic ; and, though every heart was throbbing with fear and suspense, no outward expression was want¬ ing of joy and febtal pleasure. For the present, all was calm around the slumbering volcano. Suddenly the Count St Aldenheim, who was standing with arms folded, and surveying the bril¬ liant scene, felt some one touch his hand, in the way concerted amongst tho conspirators as a private signal of recognition. Ho turned, and recognised his friend, the Baron Adekrt, who saluted him with three emphatic words—"We are betrayed!"—Then, after a pause, « Follow me." . St Aldenheim made his way through the glitter¬ ing crowds, aud pressed after his conductor into one of the most private corridors.
» Fear not," said the other, «that we shall be watched. Vigilance is no longer necessary to our ciafty enemy. He has already triumphed. Every avenue of escape is barred and secured against us: every outlet of the palace is occupied by the Land¬ grave's troops. Not a man of us will return alive." " Heaven forbid we should prove ourselves such gulls! You are but jesting, my'friend." " Would to God I were 1 my information is but too certain. Something I have overheard by ac¬ cident ; something has been told me; and some¬ thing I have seen. Come you also, Count, and see what I will show you: then judge for yourself." So saying, he led St Aldenheim by a little circuit of passages to a doorway, through which they passed into a hall of vast proportions; to judge by the ca¬ tafalques, and mui-al monuments, scattered at inter¬ vals along the vast expanse of its walls, this seemed to be the ante-chapel of St Agnes. In fact it was so; a few faint b'ghts glimmered through the gloomy extent of tliis immense chamber, placed (according to the Catholic rite) at the shrine of the saint. Feeble as it was, however, the light was powerful enough to display in the centre a pile of
scaffolding covered with black drapery. Standing at tho fbot/they could trace the outHnes of a stage a* the summit, fenced in with a raih'ng, a block, und the other apparatus for the solemnity of a'pub- hc execution, whilst tHe saw-dust below their feet ascertdned the spot in which the heads were to fdl. ** Shdl we ascend and rehearse our parts ?" asked the Count:' ""for'methinks every thing is prepared, except the headsman and the spectators. A plague on the inhospitable knave I" l ' " Yes, St Aldenheim, dl is prepared—even to the sufferers. On that Hst,'you stand foremost. Be¬ lieve me, I speak with knowledge; no matter where gained."It'iscertdn." " ' |! '" * ' J -" WeU, necessitas non'habet legem' 1 ; »and he that dies on Tuesday irill never catch cold 1 on Wednes¬ day.' But stiU, that comfort is^sbmething of the coldest. Think you that none better'could be had ?" '« As how?" i U > 'i* hi ' ti. -I> . i " Revenge, 1 pat* exemple ; a Httle revenge.

That is, we might die sword in hand; but " - i , , " Enough! I ask no more. Now let us go.- We will separately pace the rooms, draw together as many of our party as wo can single out, and then proclaim ourselves. Let each answer for one victim. I'll take his Highness for my share."' With this purpose, and- thus [forewarned of the dreadful fate at hand, they f left the gloomy ante¬ chapel, traversed the long suite iof entertdning rooms, and collected as many as could eosUy be de¬ tached from the dances without! too much pointing out their own motions to the attention of aU present. Tho Count^St Aldenheim was seen rapidly expldn- ing to them the circumstances of their dreadful si¬ tuation ; whilst hands uplifted, or suddenly appHed to the Hilt of the sword, ivith other gestures of sudden emotion, expressed the different impressions of rage or fear, which, under each variety of character, im¬ pressed the several hearers. Some of them, how-
ever, were too unguarded in their motions; and the energy of their gesticulations had now begun to at¬ tract the attention of the company. The Landgrave himself had his eye upon thenu But at tlus moment his attention was drawn off by an uproar of confusion in an antechamber, which argued some tragical importance in the cause that could prompt'so sudden a ■ disregard for the re¬ straints of time and'place.
CHAPTER, XXV. His Highness issued from the room,in conster¬ nation, followed by many of the company.-■ In the very centre of the anteroom, booted and spurred, bearing aU the marks of extreme haste, panic, and confusion, stood a Swedish officer, dealing forth hasty fragments of some heart-shaking inteUigence. " AU is lost!" sdd he, " not a regiment has escaped I" '* And the place?" exclaimed a press of enquirers. " Nordlingen." " And which way has the Swedish army retreated ?" demanded a masque behind him. " Retreat!" retorted the officer, «I teU you there is no retreat. AU have perished. The army is no more. Horse, foot, artiUery—aU is ivrecked, crashed, annihilated. Whatever yet lives, is in the power of the Imperialists." At this moment the Landgrave came up, and in every way strove to check these too liberal commu-

' ^ lr > fl "» , '" ,f 'l '->" As the 'dock 'struck''eleven/'the''drchestra J had'' suddenly become silent; and; as l no buzz of conver- ' sation succeeded, the anxiety of expectation became'' ' more painfully irritating. "Thcwhole vast assem- ' blage was hushed,'gazing at'the doors—at each !
other—or watching, stealthily, the Landgrave's countenance. Suddenly a sound was heard in an anteroom: a page entered with a step hurried and discomposed, advanced to the Landgrave's seat, and bending downwards, whispered some news or mes¬ sage to that Prince, of which not a syllable could be caught by the company. Whatever were its import, itcould not be collected, from ony very marked change on the features of him to whom it was addressed, that he participated in the emotions of the messen¬ ger, which were obviously those«of grief or panic— perhaps of both united. Some even fancied that a transient expression of malignant exultation crossed the Landgrave's countenance at this moment. But, if that were so, it was banished ns suddenly; and, in the next instant, the Prince arose with a leisurely motion; and with 'a very successful affectation (if such'it were)'of extreme tranquillity,'he moved forwards to one of the anterooms, in which, as it 'now appeared, some'person was awaiting his pre¬ sence, ' i " '" « i Who, and on what errand ?—These were the questions which now racked the curiosity of those among the company who had least concern in the
find event, and more pdnfuUy interested others whose fate was consciously dependant upon the ac¬ cidents which the next hour might happen to bring up. Silence stiU continuing to prevail, and, if pos¬ sible, deeper sUence than before, it was inevitable that aU the company—those even whose honourable temper wodd least have brooked any settled purpose of surprising the Londgrave's secrets—shodd, in some measure, become a party to what was now passing in the anteroom. The voice of the Landgrave was heard at times— briefly and somewhat sternly in reply—but appa¬ rently in tho tone of one who is thrown upon the necessity of self-defence. On the other side, the speaker was earnest, solemn, and (as it seemed) upon an office of menace or upbraiding. For a time, however, the tones were low and subdued; but, as the passion of the scene advanced, less restraint was observed on both sides; and at length many beHeved that in tho stranger's voice they'recognised that of the Lady Abbess; and it was some corroboration of this conjecture^ that the name of PauHna began now frequently to be caught, and jin connexion ivith ominous words, indicating some dreadful fate sup¬ posed to have befaUen her.
A few moments dispersed all doubts. The tones of bitter and, angry reproach rose louder than be¬ fore ; they were, without doubt, those of the Abbess. She charged the blood of Paulina upon the Land¬ grave's ( head,; denounced the instant vengeance of the Emperor for so great an atrocity; and, if that could be evaded, bade him expect certain retribution from Heaven for so wanton and useless an effusion of innocent blood, , The Landgrave replied in a lower key; and his words were few and rapid. That they were uords of fierce recrimination, v/as easily collected from the tone ; and in the next minute the parties separated with little ceremony (as was sufficiently evident) on either side,-and with mutual wrath. The Land¬ grave re-entered the banqueting-room—liis features discomposed and inflated with passion; but such was his self-command, and so habitual his dissimulation, that, by the time he reached, his seat, all traces of agitation had disappeared,; his countenance had re¬ sumed its usual expression of stern serenity, and his. manners their usual air of perfect self-possession.
The clock of St Agnes struck twelve. At that
sound the Landgrave rose. " Friends, and iUus- trious strangers !" said he, " I Have caused one seat to be left empty for that blood-stained Masque, who summoned me to answer on this night for 'a crime which he could not name, at a bar which no man knows. His summons you heard. Its fidfilment is yet to come. But I suppose few of us are « eak enough to expect"------ ' " That The Masque of Klosterheim will ever break his engagements," said a deep voice, suddenly inter- mptmg the Landgrave. AU eyes'were directed to the sound; and behold! there stood The Masque, and seated himself quietly in the chair which had been left vacant for his reception. " " It is weU I" said the Landgrave; but the air of vexation and panic with which he sank back into his seat 'beHed his words. Rising again, after a pause, with some agitation he said, " Audacious criminal! since last ive met, I have learned to know you, and to appreciate J youi* purposes. It is now fit they should'be knoivn to Klosterheim. A scone of justice an tuts you at'present, whicli will teach this city to understand the delusions lvhich could build anypart of her hopes upon yourself.—Citizens and
friends; not I, but these dark criminals and interlo¬ pers whom you will presently see revealed in their time colours, are answerable for that interruption'to the course of our peaceful festivities, which will presently be brought before you. Not I, but they are responsible." So saying, the Landgrave arose, and the whole of the immense audience, who now resumed their masques, and prepared to follow whither bis High¬ ness should lead. With the haste of one who fears he may be anticipated in'his purpose, and the fury of some bird of prey, apprehending that his strug¬ gling victim may be yet torn from his talons, the Prince hurried onwards to the antechapel. Innu¬ merable torches now iUuminated its darkness; in other respects it remained as St Aldenheim had left it. The Swedish masques had many of them with¬ drawn from the gala on hearing- the dreadful day of PxordHngen. But enough remained, when strength¬ ened by the body guard of the Landgrave, to make up a corps of nearly five hundred men. Under the command of Colonel Von Aremberg, part of them now enclosed the scaffold, and part prepared to seize the persons who were pointed out to them as con-
spirators. Amongst these stood foremost The Masque. Shaking off those who attempted to lay hands upon him, he strode disddnfully ivithin the ring; and then turning to the Landgrave, he said—. « Prince, for once be' generous; accept me as a ransom for the rest." The Landgrave smiled sarcastically. « That were an unequal bargain, methinks, to take a part in exchange for the whole." « The whole ? And where is then your assurance of the whole?" " Who should now make it doubtful ? There is the block; the headsman is at hand. What hand can deliver from this extremity even you, Sir Masque ?" " That which has many times delivered me from a greater. It seems, Prince, that you forget the last days in the history of Klosterheim, He that rules by night in Klosterheim, may well expect a greater favour than this when he descends to sue for it." The Landgrave smiled contemptuously. " But again I ask you, sir, will you on any terms grant immunity to these young men ?"
" You sue as vdnly for others as you wodd do for yourself." " Then dl grace is hopeless ?" The Landgrave vouchsafed no answer, but madii signds to Von Aremberg. , *' Gentlemen, cavaHers, citizens of Klosterheim, you that are not involved in the Landgrave's suspi¬ cions," said The Masque appealingly, " wiU you not join me in the intercession I offer for these young friends, who are else to perish unjudgcd, by blank edict of martid law ?" The citizens of Klosterheim interceded ivith in- effectud suppHcation. " Gentlemen, you waste your breath; they die without reprieve," repHed the Landgrave. ■ , " WiU your Highness spare none ?" " Not one," he exclaimed angrily, " not the youngest amongst them." " Nor grant a day's respite to him lvho may appear on examination the least criminal of the whole ?" * " A day's respite? No, nor half an hour's.— Headsman, be ready.—Soldiers, lay the heads of the prisoners ready for the axe." 3
« Detested Prince, now look-to your own !" With a succession of passions flying over his face, rage, disdain, suspicion, the Landgrave looked round upon The Masque as he uttered these words, and with pallid, ghastly consternation, beheld him raise to his lips a hunting horn which' depended from his neck. He blew a blast, which was immediately answered from within. Silence as of the grave en¬ sued. All eyes were turned in the direction of the answer. Expectation was at its summit; and in less than a minute solemnly uprose the curtain, which divided the chapel from the ante-chapel, revealing a scene that smote many hearts with awe, and the consciences of some with as much horror as if it had really been that final tribunal, which numbers be¬ lieved The Masque to have denounced.
CHAPTER XXVI. , ^The, great ,ch,apel ofjSt Agnes, the immemorial hall of coronatiop for ,the Landgraves of X------, was^capqblp^f,containing ,with ease fiom seven to eight thousand spectator. ^Nearly that numbqr was now collected in the galleries, which, on the recur¬ rence, ofj that grea^; pccasion, pr of a royal marriage, were usually assigned to the spectators.

or ambassador. This nobleman advanced to the crowd of Klosterheimors, and spoke thus:— " Citizens of Klosterheim, 1 bring you from the Emperor your true and lawful Landgrave, Maximi¬ han, son of your last beloved Prince." Both chapels resounded with acclamations; and the troops presented aims. " Show us our Prince! let us pay hiin our ho¬ mage !" echoed from every mouth. " This is mere treason 1" exclaimed the Usurper. " The Emperor invites treason against his own throne, who undermines that of other Princes. The late Landgrave had no son; so much is known to you all." " None that was known to Iiis murderer," replied The Masque, " else had he met no better fate than his unhappy father." ' ' " Murderer!—And what art thou, blood-polluted Masque, with hands yet reeking from the blood of all who'refused to join the conspiracy against your'lawful Prince'?" ''*'"' ' • * ■''" Citizens of Klosterheim," said the Legate, "'first let'the Emperor's' friend be 'assoile'd' from "all inju¬ rious 1 thoughts. ,Li Thdse whom' ye beHe've to 'have

A race of passions had ^traversed hig countenance, chasing each other in fly¬ ing succession. . But by a prodigious effort he recdled .himself to the,scene before him; and, striding up to -t^he .crowd,, of, wHJch the .Legate was the central , figure, he rdsqd his, arm .with a gesture of indigna-
tion, and protested vehemently that the assassination of Maximilian's father had been iniquitously charged upon himself:—« And yet/' said 'he, <* up'on' that one'gratuitous'assumption'have been built all the other fonl suspicions directed against my persott.''" " Paidon me, sir," replied the Legate, "the evi¬ dences were such as satisfied the Emperor and his Council; and'he showed it'by the vigilance with which he watched over the Prince Maximilian,'and the anxiety with which he kept him from' approach¬ ing your Higlmess, until his pretensions' could 1 be established by arms. But, if more direct' evidence were wanting, since yesterday we have'had it iri the dying confession of the very agent employed td strilte the fatal blow.

This precaution he had .adopted in part to intercept any denunciation of the Emperor's vengeance which Paulina might address to the officer. As a rude soldier, accustomed to obey the letter of his orders, this commandant had executed his com¬ mission ; and tho gentle Adeline, who had naturally hastened to the protection of her father's chateau, ' surrendered her breath meekly and with resignation to what she believed a simple act of miHtary vio¬ lence ; and this she did before she could know a syUable of her father's guilt or His faU, and without any the least reason for supposing him connected with the occasion of her early death. <. • i i < At this moment PauHna made her appearance un¬ expectedly, to reassure the young Landgravo by Her presence, and to weep-over her, young friend,'whom she had lost dmost before sh^ Had come to,know!ier.

To reconcde aU claims, therefore, on finding this bar in ithe nay, the Emperor had resolved to promote a marriage for Maximilian with P;auhna, who stood equally related to the Imperial house 'and to that of her lover.' In this view he had despatched PauHna to Klosterheim, with proper do¬ cuments to supportithe ck'ms of both parties. "Of these documents i she hud. been robbed atf Walden-' hausen; and the very letter, Avhich was designed to introduce MaximiHan as « the child and sole re¬ presentative of the late murdered Landgrave," fall¬ ing in this surreptitious way into the usurper's hand, had naturally misdirected his attacks to' the >person of PauHna. „ [ \ U t i.. i i in v"t ' ' < ( For the rest, as regarded'thei'mysterious move¬ ments of The Masque, these were easily explained.

This explanation of the else unaccountable hor¬ ror manifested by the Ex-Landgrave on the sudden exposure of The Masque's features, received a re¬ markable confirmation from the confession of the miserable assassin at Waldenhausen. This man's illness had been first brought on by the sudden shock of a situation pretty nearly the same, acting on a conscience more disturbed and a more super¬ stitious mind. In the very act of attempting to as- " sassinate or rob Maximilian, he had been suddenly dragged by that Prince into a dazzling Hght; and this settling full upon features which too vividly re¬ called to the murderer's recoUeetion the last unhappy Landgrave, at the very same period of blooming man¬ hood, and in his own favourite hunting palace, not far from which the murder had been perpetrated, na¬ turally enough had for a time unsettled the guilty man's understanding, and terminating in a nervous fever, had at length produced his penitential death. ' A death, happily of the same character, soou over¬ took the deposed Landgrave. He was laid by the side of his daughter, whose memory, as much even as his own penitence, availed to gather round his final resting-place the forgiving thoughts even of
KLOSTlMHlflMY 3^' those who''had sliffer'ed most J from'"his'" , crimes. Klosterheim'in the next'age flourished 'greatly} be f - ing one of those cities which'benefited by the pedbe of (Westphalia.'"'Many dhailges 'took 'place in con-' sequence, greatly affecting-the architectural charac¬ ter of the town and'its picturesque antiquities; but, amidst all revolutidns of this nature^'the secret pas¬ sages still survive} and to this day 1 arc shewn occa- sionaUy to strangers of' rank arid consideration, by which, more than by any other of the advantages at his disposal, The Masque of Kloslerheim was en¬ abled to replace himself in his patrimonial rights, and at the same time to hberate from'a growing- oppression his own compatriots and'subjects.

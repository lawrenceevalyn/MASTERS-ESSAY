TRAVELS
OF ST. LEON.
CHAP. I. J. HE firft employment in which I purpofed to engage my new-found li¬ berty and youth, was a vifit to my daugh¬ ters. I now carried a difguife perpetu¬ ally about with me, that woultl render my journey incapable of proving in¬ jurious to tliem. My daughters were all thai remained, if indeed they ftill remained, of my once idolifcd family. For twelve yeais I had cuiitiniicd totally ignorant of their fortune and even of their exidence. Part of the Vol. JV. В ^' plan
plan I hid adopted for their advantage, neceffanly precluded me from all coi- refpondence or communication with them or any one near them, that might fatisfy and tranquillife the anxieties of a father If it had been otherwife, depnved, as I h.d been, of the com¬ mon benefits of light and air, and cad out from the fociety of mankind, I could hive obtained no intelligence of their welfare In vifiting, I determined not to make my felf known to them, yet, notwithdanding the greatnefs of this dif- advantage, I felt that one of the mod ex¬ quifite gratifications the earth could afford ine, w as to behold my children What a multitude of adventures and incidents might they not have encountered m the fpace of twelve years ? Imagina tion and affeflion dwell impitiently on the interval, nor can any thing quiet the conjeflures of him that love», ihort of the mod complete information What
What a difference muft twelve years have produced in the very perfons and figures of creatures fo young t With what mingled and exquifite emotions does the father contemplate his daugh¬ ter, whom he left a child, grown up into a woman ? He fees her with aftonifhment and rapture, dilplaying maturer beauties, difcovenng in liei countenance new traces of knowledge and fentiment, and m her geflure and manners a character finiflied, mation y and fedate The very circumftance, that I (liould vifit them unknown, and converfe intimately with them without being difeovored, while it cut me off from many pure and ingenuous plea- fures, added in fome refpefls a new relidi to the indulgence, for it gave it a character, fmgular, and peihaps unprecedented, in the hiftory of min kind I anticipated with eager tranf- port the hour at which I ihould revifit В 2 the

My fituation was fìmilar to this I hid long known, as far as refleflion tould aflure me of it, that I poflefled the elixir of immortality But never till now had I felt the julep tingling in my veins, and known the effefls of it in every joint and articulation of my frame I before believed, I now felt, that I wis immortal fhe confe¬ quence of this intimate perfuafion vv a» not without its portion of melancholy I ftill bore the figure and lineaments of a human creature, but I knew that I was not what I feemed 1 here was ι greater diftance between me and the heft conflrufttd and moft confummate ot the human fpecies than there is between him and an ant or a mulkito, crufhed by the fiift accidental tread, or confumed by the fird fpaik wafted bv the wind I can no longer cheat my fancy, I know that I am alone Ihe creature does not exid with whom I have
I have any common language, or any genuine fympathies. Society is a bit¬ ter and galling mockery to my heart ; it only fliows in more glaring colom» my defolate condition. The neaier I attempt to draw any of the nomi¬ nal ties of our nature, the more t!"ey dart and (brink from my grafp. From this moment I could not fliake off the terrible impreffion of my lonclinefs, no not for an hour. Often docs this impreflion induce me to regaid my immortality with loathing indefciib- able, often tlo 1 vvifli to flieltei myfelf from it in the fvvect oblivion of the grave. From this hour I had no paf- fions, no inteiells, no affeflions, my heart has never expanded with one na¬ tuial emolion ; I have never delivered myfelf up to the repofe of one genuine amufement. If at any time I have had a glimpfe of pleafure, it has 'tritateci, only to deceive ; it ha» increafed the appetite, while it difplayed in drongcr В 5 colours

lady, which would otherwife have been confiderable, as entirely alienate and annihilated by this flaw in the title But wbat wis more material, it by no means accorded with In» idea» of nobility and honour, that the father m law of his only fon ihould be a fugitive and a w anderer, with whofe refidence no one was acquainted, and of whom no one could tell whether hc were living or dead The manner m which the ladies had entered into the repoffeifion of their paternal ef tate, when minutely invedigated, was thought to have fomething in it of an ambiguous and unpleafant nature It was well known that monfieur St Leon had left the country in confequence of his having ruined himfelf by the vice of gammg furely, faid fome, it is a little myftenous, how his children came, after an interval of nine years, to be able to repurchafe all be ever poflefled
poflefled. In fliort, the more the old vicomte was reafoned with, the more furious he grew. At length he made ufe of the power which the govern¬ ment of France veils in the father of a family, and fhut up his fon in one of the royal priions. This was a fatal blow both to the chevalier and his miftrefs. Difappointed in the objefl of hi» warmed affeflions, maltreated and difgraced by the feverity of a fa¬ ther, his heallh fenfibly declined. Norhihg' however could fliake the in¬ flexibility of the vicomte ; he would releafe his fon upon no other terms than a renunciation of his love, terms whith the fehfe ef dignity and honour in the young gentleman, equally with his paflion^ forbad him to accept. To Sill reprefênlations of the neceflity of granting liberty to his fon, if he w ould 'not"make himfelf anfwerable for hi» death,' the vicomte flernly replied, that

By the populace, who now experienced the unfatisfied cravings of hunger, and in whom my proceedings had excited hope, only to be followed by a more cruel difappointment, they were greedi¬ ly credited Many who knew their falfliood, were yet zealous to propagate them Short as had been my re fidence in Hungary, I had made many enemies It is to be feared that no man cm be ifliduous and in¬ defatigable m the ferviee of others, ivitnout incurring that confequence I employed ι gre it number of work¬ men, every one whom for whatever reifon I refufed to employ, every one who, being unqualified for the ferviee I requned, looked with in envious eye on the better fortune of his neighbour, w a» well difpofed to be my enemy Perfons of m contemptible account m the community, had been excited by expeflations of profit to engage ω the Ľ 2 importa-

the morning they had refufed to earn, and were therefore now unable to pur chafe I had already had fome ex¬ perience m the nature of popular tu¬ mults, 1 had now no marchefe Γ1Ι0- fanto at hand to perfuade me of then mefficacy, and, if I had, I fliould no longer have lent an eir to his ferene and unfufpicious generality I felt the reality of the danger, I faw the floral as it blackened in my horizon, and was deeply convinced what it would be if it burft upon my head It may be imagined wjth what feeU mgs I viewed my whole defignon the point to be fubverted, by the unruh nefs of thofe for whofe benefit it had been planned It is true 1 had now no darling relations to be involved in my fate, no incomparable wife, no daugh¬ ters illuftnous in innocence and beauty, yet my feelings were fcarce¬ ly lefs pungent than they had been at the
the period of my cataftrophe at Pifa I 1 ad blamed my r elf in review, that, m irv experiment» at Confiance, at Drefden, at Pifa and at Madrid, I had not commenced upon a fufliciently ample fcale, but had fuffered mvfelf to be fiuffratcd by the inglorioiifnefs of my piecautions That had not been mv erroi m the prefent inllance, yet my fuccef» now promifed to be fcarcely moie flattering than upon former oc¬ cafions I had looked fcr happinefs as the refult of the benevolence and philanthropy I was exerting, I found only anxiety and a well grounded fear even for my perfonal fafety Let no man build on the expefled gratitude of thofe he fpends hi» ftrength to ferve ' Let him be beneficent if he w ill, but let him not depend for his happinefs on the conviflion of his ìeflitude and virtue that is to be miprefled on the mmds of others 1 There is a pimuple E i m
in the human bread, that eafily induces them to regard every thing that can be done for them, as no more than their due, and fpeedily difcbarges them fiom tbe oppreffive confeioufnefs ot obligation There is a levity in the geneialityof men, that entails on them a continual obhvion of pail benefits, and makes one recent difappointment of more importance m their eyes, than an eternity of kindneffes and con- defcenfion I (hall have other in« (lances of ingratitude to difplay in what yet remains to be related of my ftoiy My nights were refllefs, my thoughts were in arms What was it that it be¬ came me to do in the prefent emer gency ? Sometimes, m the bitternefs of my heart, hating myfelf, hating the endowments of the firinger, hating a race of beings who denied all credit to the mod unheard of exertions for their advantage,
advantage, I determined to withdraw unobferved from my attendants and clients, and bid adieu to Hungary for ever. But whither was I tolly? What was I to do next? What experiment could I make of tlie purpofes to which to apply the philofopher's ftone, that I had not already made ? Thefe quef- tions, to none of which I could give a ratisfaflory anfwer, checked the ca¬ reer of my paflion, and gave paufe to my thoughts. Whatever I did, I was determined to do nothing raftily, nor to quit a great experiment without its having 1 been fully tried. It was no light con¬ cern, no trivial child's-play in which I had embarked. I had taken the wel¬ fare, perhaps the exiftence, of a great and heroic nation under my proteflion. In this glorious vocation it did not be¬ tome me to be lightly dîfcouraged. What if thofe I ferved and faved did Г. 5 not
not fliew thenifelves fufficiently fenfi- ble to the exertions I made for them ? I ought to purify my bofom, on an oeeafion like this, from bafe and igno¬ ble motives, and to deem myfelf fuf¬ ficiently recompenfed by my confeioue virtue. What if the ferviee in which I had engaged now appeared to be a ferviee of hazard and peril? Is there any great undertaking that can be fe- parated from this condition? If hafti- ly, from cowaidice, from pique, or ftom any other motive, I dcferted the. bufinefs on which I had entered, what was to become of my miftaken indeed, but in that cafe moil unfortunate clients? The greater was the crifts to which they were expofed, the more were unremitted vigilance and uncommon powers neceffary to guide them amidft its roejís and its quick- fands. I faw thoufands of men who for feveral weeks had fed, as it were, from
from the (lores of my bounty. By a propenfity infeparable from the human heart, I became attached to the work of my meditations, and the labour of my thoughts. All their ficklenefs, their injullice, even the atrocious calumnies they admitted and propagated againd me, could not wean my attachment from beings, a great poi tion of whom, but for n y interference, would, I be¬ lieved, long ere this have expired of hungei. In the peculiar and urgent circum¬ ftances in whieh I found myfelf, no expedient was fo obvious, as that of calling in the interference of the go¬ vernment under which I lived. It was neceffary that the refources of national fubfiftence (hould be defended from the wanton fpoil of thofe who, when they were annihilated, muft inevitably perifli. It was neceffary thai the be¬ nefaflor of Hungary, who, I flattered E 6 myfelf,
myfelf, was flill able to watch effec¬ tively for her advantage, fhould be protefled from her mifguided refent¬ ment. The alternative was fingularly painful to my feelings. The pride with which my unparalleled endow¬ ments infpired me, was deeply wound¬ ed, when I was compelled to confefs, that I was not alone equal to the taik I had undertaken, and that I muft fubmit to call in a foreign auxiliary. I augured little favourable from the interference of government, which, if I implored, I could fcarcely expefl to guide, which was not likely to fubmit to my principle of rendering ¡ts inter¬ ference the mildeft and fmalleft that the nature of the cafe would admit, but, puffed up with prefumption, and intoxicated with authority, would pro¬ bably leave no concern of the pub¬ lic welfare uninvaded. Leaft of all, could I anticipate much of good from a TurkiŰi
a Turkifh government But what could I do ' I could difcover no other expe dient Influenced by the view s I have recited, I had hitherto kept myfelf as fai from the obfervation of the pohti cil direftors of the fiate as I could But my eiutioufnefs and referve were now at an end With my eyes open I expofed myfelf to all the evils that might attend on rn) proceeding I determmed to apply to the baihaw of the province Previoufly to my tiking this flep I bad the precaution to enquire his charafler He was the· genuine offspring of the Turkifli fyf¬ tem of government His name was Muzaffer Bey He was ongmally a Circaflian flave , then a Jamflary, and, nfing by infenfible gradation, had at length been appointed baihaw of Buda, which, as being the immediate fron¬ tier between Audna and the Porte, was at this time the moft arduous fitu¬ ation

This is really a very extraordinary cafe; your merit i» unprecedented; I do not feel myfelf competent to levvard it. I anfwered that I laid no claim to uncommon merit, that every temper had its particular gratifications; and that I found as real a luxury in the pro¬ ceeding» he had remarked, as other men did ; n the excedes of the table, or the promifcuous enjoyments of the harem. ,It is out of my power, continued he, tp remunerate you as you deferve; I muft fend you ta^Conflantinople. I perceived that this was tbe firft effay of his artifice. I informed him, which I have no doubt he knew well enough before, that I had no defire to go to Conflantinople. I wiflied to re¬ main where I was, and to fimfli what I had begun. What,
What, you have not done then ? fuddenly and with an abrupt voice ex¬ claimed the bafliaw. By Mahomet, a man of a reafonable appetite in your place, roiglit be fatisfied.

Myftery was the great and unconquer¬ able bane of my fituation, and from the poifonous influence of myftery the moil regular fyftem of government was not competent to protefl me. It would be idle to imagine that, in any country on earth, a ftranger would be permitted.to launch into fuch expences as thofe in which I w a» engaged, with¬ out becoming an objefl of fufpicion, and being made liable to continual in¬ terruption in his meafures. Yet, unlefs allowed to ufe the refources I poflefled, of what advantage was it to be the de¬ pofitory of wealth without a bound ? Was it to be wiflied for a man under my circumftances, to have a family, or to be without a family ? When I had one, I found the legacy of the ftranger robbing me of every comfort of that fort with the moil calamitous aggravations. When I was dripped of wife
wife and children, though no man could prize thofe benefits more dearly than I prized them, I took to myfelf the confolation, that at lead now I fliould nik no one s happmefs but my own, and that, for a perfon exercifing my endowments, it was perhaps requi- fite to be free from every (hackle and incumbrance I found however the topic from which I had confoled my¬ felf, m reality the fource of a new mis¬ fortune I had the wealth of a noble¬ man, but I was deprived of his adven¬ titious attributes I had no illuftnous ancefiry to boaft, I hid neither lineage nor parent, I had neither wife nor children, m whom mutually to refle£l and fee reflefled the elevatednefs and generofity of my dation I hid not even the ordinary advantage, which is withm the reach of almod eveiy man, of connections and acquaintance, friende handed down to me ,is a branch ot
of my patrimonial Inheritance, friends whofe Value experience enabled me to afcertairi, and friends with whom long habits of familiarity had giveh birth to reciprocal endearment. The bafliaw had imputed to me the defign of forme ing á party. Alas I thefe, which are the great materials for cementing party-attachments, weie totally denied rhé. I had no bonds of alliance bul thafe which money afforded, the coarf- eif, the meanefl, the leaft flattering, and the mod brittle of thofe ligatures, that afford the femblance of uniting man with man.

CII\P VI WHILE Bethlem Gabor every day bei ame more confirmed m h s antipa¬ thy againd me, I repofed m him an unfufpe£ling confidence, a confidence more extenfive than I had, fince the ungular and fatal acquifition I had made, repofed in any other man 1 rcquently tor a confiderable time to gether he refided under my roof, fie¬ quently we went forth together in thofe excurfions which either my pro- jefls or his views rendered it neceflary for us to make In his charafler of ι nobleman of great confederation in his native country, he wa» now nfing like a phcemx from its afhes His caftles wete

anxious to piy hım every mark of attention and refpeil, I fet out to meet htm It was fcarcely fafe, dur¬ ing the exiftmg hoflihties between the Auftnans and the Turks, to travel any where w ithout a guard, I had the precaution in the prefent inllance to take with me an attendance of twenty men It was after having partaken of a flight and eaily dinner that I fct out on my excurfion Ihe feafon was re¬ markably fine, and the air genial and balfamic I fcircely ever commenced any tour with moie agreeable fenfa¬ tions The hirveft was already ripe, and, as I pifled along, I faw reapers from time to time entering upon the firft effiy of their interefting occupa¬ tion I felt that I hid at length fur- mounted one of thofe difficulties, with which I hid been fo ftrongly affailed, and
nnd to which I had refufed to yield. If I were not free from appréhendons from the arbitrary nature of the go¬ vernment under which I lived, I be¬ lieved however that I had nothing further to dread from the mifconflruc- tion and animofity of the nation f preferved. My anxiety as to whether I ihould be able to fubftantiate the benefit ï had fought to confer, was at an end ; and I had little doubt that, with the plenteous crops which were on the point of being gathered, my popularity would 'return, and the gratitude of my clients become more ardent than ever. It was a delicious enjoyment that I now experienced; the pleafutes that the eye unavoidably takes in from the fpeflacle of a luxu¬ riant autumn, became blended in my mind with the ideas of famine put to flight, my own reñitude vindicated, and
and the benevolent purpofes tealìfed, the profecution of which had cofl in« fo profound a heart-ache. We at length pafled the lines of the foldiers planted for the defence of the foil againft the depredations of the enemy. I had calculated that I Ihould meet my gueft a few leagues from Budas I was deceived in my edimate. The day however of his arrival was fixedj I could not be miftaken in his route ; I refolved not to turn badk without meeting him. The road I took led upon the borders of that part of Hun¬ gary which owned the Auftrian yoke} the fliades of night were fail gathering found us, and we heard,at a diftance the alarm-guns and the drums of the enemy. I was not however ,a novice in the appearances of a country, the feat of military excurfions and war; and, if my mind were not wholly free frooi perturbation and uncertainty, I at
at lead refolved not to be turned afide from my purpofe We travelled two hours longer (till no notice of the ap proach of Bethlem Gabor At length a queftion was ftarted whether we were (Ы1 m the right road, and I thought it advifable to hold a fort of council of war to deliberate refpefling our fur ther proceedings Having affembled my attendants for that purpofe, I was now firft ftruck with the apprehenfions and timidity which they unammoufly betrayed They had been drawn out rather for (how, and to keep accidental ftragglers in awe, than with the ex peflation of aftual ferviee I became fenfible that nothing was to be hoped from their refiftance in the event of an aflion, and the utmoft I could aim at was ш the mean time to hold them to gether by the fentiment of a common danger It
It was refolved to return; I began to be apprehenfive that Bethlem Gabor had been prevented by fome unexpeñed occurrence from obferv- ing his appointment. Scarcely had we faced about, before we heard a body of cavalry approaching us. I called to my party to halt. I foon dif- cerned, from fymptoms not difficult to be remarked by a careful obferver, that the party at hand was compofed of Auftro-IIungarians. We had every thing to fear from them. I held my¬ felf bound under thefe circumftances firft to make experiment of the fleet- nefs of our horfes. I however charged my people to keep together, and not to fuffer the enemy, by means of our inadvertence and folly, to make an eafy prize of us one after another. In a fliort time I found that our purfuers fenfibly gained ground upon us. I was mounted upon an excellent beail,

a ferocious countenance I thought I had never feen fo tremendous a band To me they were every one of them ftrangers, of all the pei fons that fur- rounded me, the only one of whom I had the flighted knowledge was Beth¬ lem Gabor himfelf I know not why it was, but I no fooner beheld my fitua tion than I was druck with alarm I faw myfelf completely in the power of a man who three months before was ignorant even of my exidence I had not a fingle attendant of my own, not an individual и ith me over whom I had peifonal authority or comnund I had no reafon to diftruft my hoft , towards me Ins demeanour had ever been frank, confidential and manly, I had eveiy imlgmable claim upon his generofity .and his gratitude But our fenfes are often the mailers of our mmd, and iea- fon vainly oppofes itfelf to the livtli- Voi.

natural, but there wis a myftenous gloom, at leaft as I thought, in the tone in which he fpoke, that elec¬ trified me The hall m which we flipped w as fpacious and lofty, the naked walls and niters were lm- browned with age Though it was da) break as we entered, the windows were ftill darkened, and the apirtment was illuminated only bv the partial glue of lamps depending fiom the roof As I fat at table with the troop of my hoft, 1 appeared to myfelt as if mclofed in a cavern of banditti Though ex¬ cellent partifans, ikilful in execution, and perfefl in their difciplme, they were unpoliflied in their manneis and brulli m then converfation I bad been mured from infancy to all the lelinement that the age m wh eh I lived had any where to boaft, and, amidft the various evils I bad fuffered, thit of being affouated with the vul- H 2 gar

CHAP VII A SUCCESSION of gloomy thoughts revolved in my mind for fome time after I wis left to myfelf I was however overcome with fatigue, and, after an interval of harrafling medita¬ tions, lnfenfibly fell afleep I was awaked after some hours repofe, by the prefence of Bethlem Gabor ftanding by the fide of my couch He invited me to rife, and, when I had attired my felf, flarted the plan of our vifitmg to gether the various apartments of the caftle, a fmall part of which only had been feen by me when I was lad at this place Among other thing», he told me, there was a fubtenanean of mod wonderful extent, mteifperfed with a H 3 variety
variety of cells and lurking places, of which no man had to his knowledge ever afcertained the number The fame dreary complexion of thought followed me to day, which had been firft produced in me upon my reception into the troop of Bethlem Gabor the preceding night My fen¬ fations were of the moft deprefling and difcomfiting nature, I felt as if I were the (lave of fome dark, myftenous ty¬ rant, and dragged along fiipinely wherever he motioned me to go I Itaiked myfelf fenoufly , I reafoned with myfelf I felt that it was no idle and every day part that I was called to fuf¬ tain, and 1 refolved that I would not be ruined by my own lnaflivity and cowardice Ytt, when I examined he q ledi on difpadionately, I could not find that I had any oeeafion for courage, and I confeffed that it was not lefs cenfurable, to difcover a ufeiefs 2 fpmt

ftrong feelings indeed, of capacious thought, but rugged, ferocious, brutal, and inacceflible to prayer I had chofen lum for my proteflor and ally, I had never intended to put myfelf n hie power There was a myftery in his carnage, а fomething not to be ex¬ plained, a fliell that no human forces could penetrate, that was mortal to confidence, md might quail the flouted I thought there would be no end to our pilgrimage At length we came to a drong door, crofs barred and fe cured witfc a frame of iron Bethlem Gabor unlocked it We had no fooner entered, than it impetuoufly clofed behind us What is that' faid 1, dartled at the loudnefs of the report Come on, cried my hod, it js orly the wind whiftling through the caverns the fpnng bolt is (hot, but I have the key in my hand I—At the op¬ pofite end of the apartment was ano II5 ther

hearts of the whole Turco-IIunganan nation Yeflerdav, as I rode forth on this fatal excurfion, I beheld the food of a mighty people, mature for con- fumption, and the growth of my exer¬ tions, and it will not be thought fur¬ prifing that my heart leaped within me at the fight Who would not have envied the unparalleled emmenée at which I had arrived ' My triumphs were attended w ith no melancholy ex¬ ceptions to damp their joy They were the children of no intrigue, they were manly, frank, ingenuous and honoui¬ able My laurels were flamed With no diop of blood, were tarmflied with no tears of the widow and the orphan How much moie noble to refcue man kind from finirne and death, than to violate the honefl pride of then nature with the exhibition of viflones and tiophies' Yet, truly confidered, there was no- II b thing
thing abrupt in the reverfe under which I was now differing Tlie whole was a chain, every link of which wa« in diffolubly connefled from one end to the other My attempt to refcue a peo pie from the horrors of famine neceffa niy expofed me to unfavourible ac¬ cidents and nufcondruflion It in¬ evitably led to my apphcition to the government for its aid It could not fail to excite the alarms and jealoufies of government as to the tendency of my proceedings By exhibiting me as the pofleflbr of immenfe wealth, with very limited means for the proteflion of that wealth, it marked me a prey to a rapaciou» viceroy or his more defpotic mader When I became fen¬ fible of the precarious fituation in which I flood towards the powers of the date, could I have fallen upon a more natural expedient, than the en¬ deavour to cover myf Jf with the flııeld of
of friendihip and gratitude m the per¬ fon of one of its nobles ? But this ex¬ pedient would almoft infallibly guide to the placing myfelf foonei or later in the power of the man whofe fiiend¬ fhip I fought I had done fo, and this wis the termination of my views and my projects I I now well underftood the purpofe of thit inattention and neglect with which Bethlem Gabor hid treated me the preceding evening, the tmeafinefs refultmg from which I had bhmcd m myfelt at the tune, as the diflate of weiknefs ind unworthy fufpicion Yel ter y I had been placed under the fiftgu id of ι nation every man in Buda and its environs'was familnr with my perfon, every min would have been ready almoft to ficrifice his life to procure my fifety No I was far from the fcene of my philanthropical exertions, no one in the troop of Beth lem
lem Gabor knew who I was, he had appeared to treat me the preceding evening with indifference and con¬ tempt, if they faw me no more, no cunofity would by that circum¬ ftance be excited m their minds My clients on the other hand in the vicinity of the metropolis, however great an intereft the- might take m my fortune, had no clue that could lead (hem to the knowledge of it They muft fuppofe me a prifoner with the Auftnans, or that I had been killed in refiding to become their prifoner I was cut off from all afliftance and dif¬ eovery, and left as much in the power of my treacherous ally, a» if I had been alone with him, oppreffed with the ut¬ mod difparity of perfonal force, in the remotefl illand of the Pacific Ocean buch weite the refleflions that early fuggefled themfelves to my mind m the folitude and darknefs in which I was thus
thus unexpectedly involved Mean¬ while one tedious hour fucceeded to another, and I remained unmtruded on and unnoticed I could form no con- jeflure as to the objefl of Bethlem Gabor in the atrocious perfidy he had committed Could he have any re¬ fentment againft me, and did he medi tate revenge' He had received from me nothing but benefits Did he cm ploy reftraint on iny perfon as the means of extortion ' I could not ceti¬ cei e that he could have any clue lead¬ ing him to the difeovery of my grand fecret, and, fliort of this, my bounties bad been fo exuberant, as, I imagined, left him nothing to wifli In tlus wíl dernefs of conjeflure I however fixed upon extortion as a motive lefs mere dible than revenge I impatiently waited, till the appearance of my ty rant ihould free me from fome part of my prefent uncertainty lb

peremptory was my fummoner, the more obftinately I clung to the worth- lefs toy At length I laid myfelf down on the floor, and, if I occafionally Mened, I no longer ran to the walls and the doers to catch the uncertain founds Ihe gnawings I now felt within were intolerable They were at one period fo fevere, that I can compare them to nothmg, but the fenfation of having fwailowed a glowing ember Afterwards, the weaknefs of nature would no longer feed this excruciating pain, and it fubfided into a darting and convulfive throb, the pain was diverfified with intervals of a death¬ like and mfupportable ficknefs—But, no I will not attempt to defcnbe the horrors of hunger fubhmed by de¬ fpair, where the torture of the mind gives new pungency and uproar to the corporeal anguifli The image, is it now
how ptefents itfelf to my recollection, is too dreadful. At laft I funk into a flate of infenfi- bility; and the agony I had fuffered feemed drawn to its final ciufe. The bufy turmoil, the ßvenfli dream of human exiftence was at an end I (hut my eyes, and I believed I ihould open them no more.

to thofe who held me in durance, if my faculties were not lethargied into death Bethlem Gabor poffeued no fliare of their apathy, his malice was ever alive, his hatred ever ingenious and new m it* devices He had a purpofe to anfwer, to extort from me the fupply of his ne ceflìttes and projefls It was not fo much pethaps that he ftood in need of tìlie, as that he placed a pnde in it, and bad fiercely refolved to (how me that I was unrefervedly his (lave His ammofitji agamft me was fo fixed- and mfatiable, that nothmg that was pain to me was indiffèrent to him Ii at any time he faw me fubfidmg into infenfibihty, he failed not to exert himfelf to fling me into life again The confequence of this was fome what different from what Bethlem Gabor expefled Defpondmg as I was, weary of life, and ilmoft finally alienated from the all coveted gift of the philofopher s ftone, if he had left mc

He embraced me with ardour ; he made a lign to me to follow him. I felt that I had feen him fomewhere, that he had been my intimate friend. Yet all the efforts I made in deep, or afterwards when I was awake, were unavailing to remove the myftery that hung upon his features. I rofe to obey him ; the ground trembled under my,feet like an earthquake. Prefently, with the in- cohereney ufuallyattendant ona dream, the figure changed to that of a female of unblemiihed grace and beauty; it unfolded a pair of radiant wings; we afcended together in the air; I looked down, and faw the caftle of Bethlem Gabor a prey to devouring flames.—Here ended my dream.

CHAP ГХ 1 HAD now continued hei e for feveral months, and in all that time had ìe- ceived no external impreflions but fuch as related to the cell I inhabited, and the mifanthropical favage by whom it was vifited One evening that Bethlem Gabor entered my dun¬ geon, I obferved in him an air of un¬ ufual difturbance Where apathy reigns, the intereourfe between thofe over whom it prefides w ill be matked with a death like uniformity, but wherever the funous paflion» t ke their turn, they will occafionally fub- fide into a femblance of familiarity and benevolence There was fome¬ thing in the countenance of my tyrant К 3 that
that made me for a moment forget the complicated injuries I had receiv¬ ed from him. What is it that has difturbed you? cried I. There was no anfwer. There was a knitting in his brow, and a contraction in his features, that (bowed me his filence was an affort. He departed however, and had already paffed the threfhold of my dungeon. The door was in his hand. He returned. Chatillon, faid he, perhaps you will never fee me more! My caftle is befieged. Ihave pafled through dangers of a thoufand names, and I ought not to be made ferious by that which now affails me. But a gloomy prefentiment hangs upon my mind. The bufy phantom of life has laded too long, and I am fick at heart. Io the worft event I will not be made a prifoner ; I will die fighting. I feel as if this were the iaft day of rqy
my exiftence, and, upon the brink of the grave, animofity and ferocioufnefs die away in my foul In this folemn moment, my 01 iginal character returns here (ftrikuig his heart) to take pof- fetfion of its native home, a charaftei, (lem ind ferious, if you will, but not fanguinary, nor cruel, nor treacherous or unjuft Between you and me there и a deadly antipathy, but you did not make yourfelf, you intended me friendihip and advantage, the fuffer- mgs you have experienced from me in return have been fufhciently feiere If I die defending my wall», and you remam thus, you will pe i(h with hunger I had intended U ihould be fo, but I am now willing to remit this pait of your fate I will enter mto a compromife with you, I will tftifl to your fidelity, and your ho¬ nour I will take off your chains, I will bring you a time piece and К 4 toi ches ,

not how tlie reader will decide upon the morality of my condufl, but I own I hid not the force, I believe I may call it the infenfibihty, to remain in my dungeon any longer There wis no doubt that, if Bethlem Gabor returned a conqueror, the term of my impnfonment would be renewed, and ill his former menaces conhnued in force What fhould I deferve to have thought of me, if I could fit down idly, and tamely wait the return of my jailor? No 1 liberty is one of the rghts that I put on when I put on the form of a man, and no event is ot power to diffolve or ibdicate that right Of what validity wis the pro mife tliat Bethlem Gabor extorted from me by compulfion, and as the condition of that which he had no title to withhold' What gratitude did I owe to this man, who treated me with every contumely, and flirunk from nothing but the thought of cau а fing
iing me to penili with hunger ' What¬ ever became of my attempt to efcape, I could it kail ш this vift fubter ranean hide myfelf from the rice of him who had injured me I had a provifion of phofphorus in my cheft, and could th ícbre extmguifli my torch upon the flighted alarm, and relume it at pleafure What was the value of life, fituated as I was fituated? It was better to pendi in the attempt to efcipe, than linger on for ever m perpetual impnfonment As a further refource I left a billet in my dungeon (for for this alfo I had implements) mtreating Bethlem Ga bor by every motive of compaffion and humamtv, to provide for me the meins of fudenance as ufual Hiving taken theie precautions, I lighted a frefli toich, and, unlocking the door, and thrufting the key into my girdle, fet out upon my expedition I hough Bethlem Gabor had flipulated for twenty fojr К 6 hour»,
hours, the fiege might even now be over, and I trembled every inftant left my jailor ihould return I wandered for a confiderable time among the alleys and w nidings of this immeafurable cavern I had the pre¬ caution to mark the fides of the vault with characters and tokens as I piffed, that, if neceffary, I might be able to find the way back to my dungeon thi» might prove an mdifpenfible re¬ fource, to prevent me from periflung with hunger Once or twice I changed my route, infen ing from a companion of circumftances, the beil I could make, that I was not in the direflion of the caftle from which Bethlem Gabor had led me to my impnfonment In all this wandering I had feen nothing, I had heaid nothing, which could de¬ montirate to me that I was approach¬ ing the habitation of man I had groped my way for near two hours, when on a fudden I heard a loud and tie-
tremendous fliout that almoft ftunned me, and that from its uncommon (hock could be at no great didance from the place where I dood This was fuc- ceeded by a terrifying glare of light I extinguiflied my torLİı, both that I might be better qualified to obferve, and that I might be lefs in danger of difeovery, by any one who ihould ap¬ proach me unawares The fliouts were feveral times repeated The light I found to proceed from that end of the vault towards which I had been ad¬ vancing, and, by the bed conjeflures I could form, I concluded the outlet into the cadle to be at no gieat didance I heard the crackling of the flames, and the fall of rafters and beam» Prefently I difcerned a volume of fmoke approach¬ ing me, and found that, if I remained long in my prefent dation, I fliould in¬ cur the nlk of being fuffocated I formed my refolution I concluded that Bethlem Gabor's caille was taken, and fot
fet on fire by the Auflrians. I believed that my perfecutor was already no more : to this faith I was undoubtedly prompted by the prefentiment which he had communicated to me. I faw that it would be impoflible for me to emerge ¡nto light, till the flames fliould abate. I once more therefore lighted my torch, and returned, by the ftraiteft road I could find, to my dungeon. An ived there, I propofed to pafs tbe interval quietly, in the cavern where I had fo long felt the weight of the Hungarian's, chains. Suddenly however the fuggef- tion occurred to me, May not my con¬ jeflures be falfe? May not Bethlem Gabor yet repel the enemy, and return to me ftom amidft the rums of his fall¬ ing caflle? The thought was ficknefs and extinction to my heart. Hope ' beautiftil as are thy vifions, in how much anguifh and agony do they clothe, the terrors of difappointment ' Never had Bethlem Gabor been half fo dreadful to
to me as now I flirunk away, I took w ith me the fragments of provifion that yet remained, I hid myfelf, I deemed no cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhuman perfccution of my tyrant I contmued in the fubterranean all that diy and all the fucceedmg night Once in this period I attempted to re- connoitie the avenue of my efcipe, but I found the fituation (till fo heated and fuflocating that I did not venture to proceed At length I came forth from this den of honors, md igun beheld the light of the fun The pith had al ready been fufficiently explored by me, and I no longer found any material obftacles I now fiw that my conjee- tuies were true the caftle of my fero¬ cious ddvcrfary wis a pile of ruins The walls indeed tor the mod part re mained but choaked with fragments of the falling edifice, blackened with the flames,

his cage, as long as Bethlem Gabor exifted, and that, when he died, I fliould perifli, unheard, unknown, no creature thet lived fufpefling my fitua¬ tion, qo lapfe of ages ever bringing to light my difmal cataftrophe. The re¬ morfe and relenting of Bethlem Gabor towards me, feemed fo little to accord with any thing that I had perfonally witneffed of bis habits and his mind, that even now I feel myfelf totally un¬ able to account for it. As it was how¬ ever, I was once again free. From the (late of an outlaw imprifoned for life, I fuddenly faw myfelf rt large, infpi- rited by the light of .ie fun, and re- frefhed by 'his genial rays, in the full poffcflion of youth and all its faculties, enabled to return amidft my clients of Buda, or to feek fome new adventure, in any corner of the earth to which my inclination led me. There is no man, however overwhelmed with calamities, however
however perfecuted with endlef» difap¬ pointment, however difguftcd with life and all its fpecious allurements, to whom fo fudden and admirable a change would not convey fome portion of elaf¬ ticity and joy But there was one thought that entirely occupied me I cannot de¬ fcnbe how my foul yearned towards this my only fon the fentiment, even now as I write, is an oppreflion I am fcircely able to fuftain Willingly, moll willingly, would I have traverfed every region of the globe, if fo I might have difcovered his unknown retreat and now, (uddenly, without the fmalleft; effort on my part, he was placed before me His lall folemn parting, hi» ab- luration of my fociety and inteicourfe for evei, rofe to my memory, and gave a zeil mexpreffible to our prefent en¬ counter At the thouglit that my foa was in the neighbounng tent, all eat th¬ iy

tered mto a folemn engagement with myfelf, that I would forget and tram¬ ple upon every perfonal concern, and be the viflim and the faenfice, if need were, of the happinefs of my child Difmifling my projefl of becoming a fiflor for the Hungarian people, I determined to hy afide the name of Chatillon, ind cut off every indication that might connefl my prefent exift¬ ence with that of the rich ftranger of Buda One of the advantages I pof- feffed for that purpofe, was, that no creature in Hungary had the flighted fufpicion that the fieur de Chatillon had ever been the prifoner of Bethlem Gabor Having thus arranged my thoughts, I now called for the garments that had been afligned me They were fupphed me from the dock of my fon, and, when I had put them on, I overheard the attendants whifpenng to each other
other their aftomfliment, at the (hiking refemblance between their mailer and myfelf. When I came once moie mto the tent of their captain, and (lood as in the former inllance before his ihield, I did not wonder at their remark. The coincidence of our features was fo great, that, had we paffed through a drange place in each other's com¬ pany, I fliould infallibly have been regarded as his younger biother. Yet there was fomething of Marguerite in the countenance of Charles that I wanted. When I recovered, as in a fliort time afterwards I did, my vigour and heallh, I was more blooming than he ; but there was fomething graceful, ingenuous and prepoflefling in his af- peft, which I could by no means boaft in an equal degree, and which might have carried him unhurt and honoured through the world. We (hall fee fome L 2 of
of the effens of this in what I ihall prefently have oeeafion to relate. When my fon required of me to de¬ clare who I was, I told him, as I bad already determined to do, that I was ä cadet of the houfe of Aubigny in France; that, after having pafled through (everal other countries, I had come into Poland with the floating and half-formed purpofe of entering as a volunteer againft the Turk; but that, before my plan was compktely arranged, having been led, by nty ju¬ venile ardour in a hunting party, far Within the frontier of Hungary, I had been fò unfortunate as to become a prifoner to the troopers of Bethlem Gabor. I added that, when introduced to their chief, I had given him fo much offence, by the firmnef» of my man¬ ner, arid my refilling to comply with certain propofitions he made me, that Jie had thruft me into a dungeon, from which,
which, but for the gallant exertions of the prefent detachment, I (hould never have come out alive. Charles heard my (lory with atten¬ tion and intereft. He called on me to refume my courage and my hopes, and to be confident that my fufferings were now at an end. He told me, that he was a Frenchman as well as myfelf, and, like myfelf, had been a foldier of fortune. He felt, he faid, a powerful fympathy in my taiej there was fomething in my counte¬ nance that irrefiltibly won his kind- nefs ; and,, if I would put. p „myfelf un¬ der his proteition, he dir) "not- doubt to be the means of my future fuccefs. He fpoke with great afperity of Beth¬ lem Gabor, who, as an inţjepid, in¬ defatigable and fanguinary partifan, »iad been the author of greater mif- ehiefs to the Chriftian caufe, than any of tlie immediate fervants of the. faltan LS ...... of
of dnílantinople. He congratulated hirafelf, that the fame aQion that had delivered the world fiom fo murder¬ ous a renegado, had rendeied lnm the preferver of a youth of fo much enter- piife and worth, as he doubted not I Ihould prove. Ile faid, there was but one other man in Hungary, who had been fo effeñual an enemy to the caufe of truth and Chriftianity as Bethlem Gabor. The name of this man he underftood was Chatillon, and he giieved to fay that he bore the appellation of a frenchman. To the eternal difgrace of the nation that gave him birth, he had joined the Turkifh ftandard, and, by exertions difficult to be comprehended, had refcued the "infidels ftom famine at a time, when, ■but for his inaufpicious interférence, Buda, and perhaps every ftrong town in Hungary, vtere on thejioint of fall¬ ing into the hands of the Chriftian». "It was
was this fame man who had revived the refources of Bethlem Gabor, after they had once before by his own fortunate exertions been rooted out, and whom I might therefore in fome fenfe confider as the author of my calamities, as well as the inveterate foe of Chnftendpm Such a wretch as this was fcarcely m- titled, to the common benefit of the lav/s of war, and he would not anfwer for himfelf, if Chatillon had fallen in¬ to his power, to what extremity his holy refentment againft this degenerate fellow countryman might have hur¬ ried him Providence however had overtaken him in his impious career, and he had fellen obfeurely, as he had lived bafely, in a night fkirmifti with a party of marauders from the Auftrian camp— lhe reader may believe that I did not a little lejoice that, m an¬ nouncing myfelt a few moments be¬ fore, I had taken the name, not of L 4 Chatil-
Chatillon, but D'Aubigny, What I heard however occafioned in me a pro¬ found refleflion on the capticioufnefs of honour and fame, and the drange contrarieties with which oppofite pre¬ judices caufe the fame aflion to be viewed. I could not reprefs the ve¬ hemence of my emotions, while I was thus calumniated and vilified for ac¬ tions, which I had (irmly believed no malice could mifreprefent, and fondly fuppofed that all fefls and ages, as fai as their record extended, would agree to admire. In another point of view the invec¬ tive which my fon thus unconfciouflj· poured in my ears, had the effefl of making me regard with a more com¬ placent fatisfaflion the plan I had formed of devoting myfelf to bis fer¬ viee. Here I purfued no delufive meteor of fame, the very effence of my projefl lay in its obfcurity. Kings and
and prelates, armies and churche», would no longer find an intereft in difputmg about my meafures, I ihould indulge the fecret promptings of my foul, undifturbed alike by the cenfure of the world, and its applaufe It was thus that, under every change of for¬ tune, I continued to foothe my foul with delufive dreams Meanwhile my projeñ went on with the happıeft aufpices The friendihip between me and Charles continued hourly to mereafe As a Frenchman, whom chance had introduced to his acquaintance in a diftant country, it was natural that he ihould feel a ftrong bias of affection towards me But that fort of fraternal refemblance which the moil inattentive fpe£tator re marked m us operated forcibly to the uicreafe of Charles s attachment He would often, m the ingenuous opening of his foul towards me, call me L 5 his
hi» brother, and fwcar that I -fliould for eVer experience from him a brother's love. Charles had by this time com¬ pleted the thirty-fecond year of his age ; I was, in appearance, at lead ten year» younger than he. There is fome¬ thing in this degree of difparity, that greatly contributes to the cultivation of kindnefs, and is adapted to the en¬ gendering a thoufand intereding len¬ timents. Frequently would he ex¬ claim, Our fortunes, my dear Henry, that was the name I affumed, have been ip a confiderable degree iimilar : we were both of us early caft on the world, I indeed at the immature age of feventeen. I entered the world' without an advifer or a friend, but my dediny was favourable, and I ef¬ eaped its quickfands and its rocks, I have now by a concurrence of happy circuindances obtained a place among honourable men and foldiers, and for ' what

Nothing could be more giatifying to me than to fee the (hoots of affi dhon thus fpnngmg up fpontancoufly in Charles's bofom I willingly humoured the generous deception that he wa» put¬ ting on himfelf, and heard with tianf- ports inconceivable Ins aflurances of kindnefs and proteflion We iode, and wc walked together, we weie in a manner lnfepanblc AV hen he went out to rcconnoitie, I was his chofen companion, when he mfpefled the difciplme and condition of his foldiers, L 6 he
he applied that opportunity to initiate me m the fcience of war, when he ex¬ pefled to encounter the enemy, he placed me immediately by his fide Sometimes he would open his heart to me, and dwell with a melancholy delight upon his fecret forrows It is no wonder, my Henry, he would fay, that I feel this uncommon at¬ tachment to you I am alone in the world I have no father, no mother and no brethren I am an exile from my country, and cut off for ever from thofe of my own lineage and blood It is with inexpieflible delight that I thus cheat the malice of my fate, and hold you to my bofom as if you were indeed ny brother I would not pait w ith the fiflion for the mines of Peru , and I know not whether I do not cul¬ tivate it more afliduoufly, and regard it with a fentiment of more anxiety and zeil, becaufe it is a fiflion, than I fliould
Ihould do if it were a reality. I had indeed, added Charles, a mother ! ------ And, when he had flatted this theme, he would dwell for eyer on her praifes. I eafily faw that never fon loved a mother more cordially, than Charles loved the all-accompliflied Margue¬ rite. With what fentiments did I hear her eulogium ? I could not join in her praifes j I could not be fup¬ pofed to know her. I flood there, as the (tatue of Prometheus might have done, if, after being informed with a living foul, the Gods had feen fit to chain its limbs in overlading marble. The paflion within me panted and la¬ boured for a vent j but I was invinci¬ bly filent. With what fentiments did I hear her eulogitmi? Every word of it was a dagger to my hearts every word feid, " And thou, villain, wert not thou her murd^ier?" moré pain¬ fully,
fully, than the fierceft reproaches could have done. ■ When Charles had celebrated with an eloquence tiuly divine this in¬ comparable mother, a fudden pang of memory would make him flart into rage. ------And this mother I left! Of this mother I cannot tell whether (lie is alive or dead ! M'hat fliall I fay ? •the crime, or the not lefs fatal error of my father feparated me fiom this mother! I loved my father: I loved him becaufe he was my father; I had great obligations to him ; lie once had virtues. But my mother,—if I could have found her in the wildeft defcrt of Africa, and have known her vir¬ tues, a ftrangei to my blood, defcended from the remotefl tribe of the human race, I fliould have chofen her for my friend, my preceptrefs and my guide, beyond all that youth and beauty, with their
». ST. ľ their mod radiant charms, could ten¬ der to my acceptance I Thus tmconfeioudy, yet ingenioufly, did my dear fon from time to time torture his father's heart. I could not even deliver him from the gloomy and wretched uncertainty, whether this mo¬ ther were alive or dead. With one word I could have compofed his foul into a fober grief, I could have faid, Your adoiable mother at length reds from her forrows, die is no longer the viflim of amifguidcd and a cruel father; you have no longer oeeafion to brood over that mod difuinfolate of refleflions, " I know not what anguifli may be at this moment fuffertd < by her who is en¬ titled to all my duty and all my affeflion," With one word I might have told thisj and that word I dared not utter.
CHAP.
CHAľ. XT. MY fön related to me his hiftory, and made me the depofitory of his feelings and refieílions. The name of St. Leon indeed never pafied his lips ; I felt tbat he had configned that to in¬ violable oblivion. The appellation he bore in the army was the chevalier de Damville. Soon after he abandoned me at Drefden, he had entered as a volunteer in the imperial army. Charles the Fifth was at that time aifembling forces to encounter the confederates of the league of Smal- calde. In this fituation my fon was eminently fortunate. He 'was diftin- guifhed for uncommon enterprife and courage in fome of the firft actions of the
the war, and early attracted the notice of Gian-Battifta Caftaldo, count of Piadena, who held an eminent com¬ mand under the emperor In tins army my fon was a parly to the deei- five battle of Muhlberg in April 1047. Tour years afterwards Cadaldo was appointed commander m chief agamft the Turks in Hungary, and the French chevalier accompanied his patron to this new kerte of military enterprife, Charles had felt diffatisfied with the grounds and motives of war between the Catholics and Proteftants of Ger¬ many, men worflnppmg the fame fa- viour, and appealing to the fame author rities, but many of them at leaft» firom the mod upright and ingenuous fcraples, differing m their interpretation of thofe authorities But, in the contentions be¬ tween the crefcent and the crofs, he en¬ tered with unbounded enthufiafm mto all the feelings that conftitute a champion or
or a martyr He conceived that what¬ ever was dear to the human race m Uns world or the next, hung on the iffue > he regarded the grandeur of the caufe as purifying his efforts and confecrat- lng his name, and, when he lifted his fword m vindication of an expiring God, he felt himfelf fteeled with more than mortal energy My fon dwelt on the merits of his patroh with a degree of veneration and love that knew no bounds Caflaldo was ranked by the confentmg voice of mankind with the mod accompliihed generals of the age in which he lived I knew him, faid Charles, in his moil private hours, and I flood next to and obferved him m the greateft and moil cntical occafions of his life It was the lead of hi» merit» that he didin- guifhed me, that he took me up fnend- lefs and an orphan, that under every circumftance he was more than a fa¬ thei
ther to me, that he correfted my f lulls, that he guided me with his advice, that he mftruítcd me with his wifdom, ind fupporfed me by his countenance Cailaldo was the mod pcrfevermg and mdefatigible of mankind, no difficul¬ ties could undermine his apparent fe- renity, no accumulation of dangers could appal or perplex him Victory never robbed hnn ol his caution, mis¬ fortune and defeat never deftroyed the grandeur ind elafticity of his foul I firmly believe that no general had ever a more difcouraging variety of coun- teraclions to druggie with The ene¬ my was barbarou and fanguinary, yet firm and undifmayed, in the full vigour of their political health, under the rule of the ableft of their fovereigns The noble, of the country Cailaldo had to defend, hid alinoli all of them been ilienated, one after another, by the tricking and ill judged polities of the houfe
houfe of Auflria. The nation was ruined, houfelefs and (larvbg. Many of the officers who ferved under my general were the bafeft of poltroons; but they were impofed upon him by his court; he was compelled te> place them in important trufls; and, even when in the mod dadardly way they betrayed thofe trufts, they were by fome pitiful intrigue ibeltered ftom his dvfcipline and his juftice· The, forcei of Caftaldo were mutinous »ud ungovernable ; and he was almofl савйапйу denied tie funds requifite for their pay. For two years the count of Piadena ûruggledwith thefe complicated diffi¬ culties. When he had obtained a hard-earned advantage at one extremi¬ ty of the kingdom, he found it ren¬ dered ufeiefs by fome treachery or in¬ capacity in the other extremity, which it was inftantly neceflary he fliould haden
haften to repair He quelled four alarming mutinies by his flrmnefs, his refources, and the prudent combina¬ tion of his calmnefs and feventy In the roidft of one of his moil arduous fituations he fuddenly received i" Hi· gence that the dates of Hungary, which were at that time affembled, were debating whether they ihould enter into a treaty with Solyman for the purpofe of placing their coun¬ try under the Turkifli fceptre He immediately flew to the place of coun¬ cil, the decifion in favour of Solyman was drawn up and ready to be adopt ed , but Caftaldo, by his prefence, his authority and his eloquence, recalled the flates to their duty, and prevented them from eternally ftainmg the Chrif¬ tian name Surrounded with thefe difficulties, oppofed to an enemy many times more numerous than the forces he could bring againft tliem, and whofe
whofe wants were all plentifully fup- plied, Caftaldo by his fingle abilities kept the balance even, or rather caufed it to incline in favour ot the Chriftian fcale. But what, added Charles, avails the moft confummate merit? How may the moil inceffant and undaunted exertions be fhadowed by the veil of obfcurity ? The world judges by events; fuccefs is neceffary to procure the palm of fame. After two years of fuch labours as I wit¬ neffed and glory to defcribe, a mutiny broke out among the mercenary troops, more formidable than any that preced¬ ed ; it was no longer even in the abi¬ lities of Caftaldo to quell. We ho¬ nour and refpefl you, faid the mu¬ tineers, but we will no more ferve without pay ; we have been baffled two years ; we will march to the gates of Vienna, and demand from Ferdinand, our fovereign, why we are thus denied the
the arrears that ire due to us They chofe leaders for this expedition imong themfelves The great Caftildo, whofe peculiar tilent it is to accom- modite himfelf to events mel never by my misfortune to be deprived of his invention and refources faw what it was that became him I lav ng in vain tried every method for retaining his troops in Hungary, he offered himfelf to leid them to Λ lenni Ihen was feen the tiue ifcendancy of a noble mind Goaded with want and diftrefs, they hid lieen deaf to the remonftiances of their B cneral when he fought to direct them againft the enemy But when they faw him fubmittmg himf If to their rage in 1 impatience, and fearlefslv inti lifting his fafety to thofe who hid before refufed even to hften to him and who had re ifon to feir his retribution as their accufer and judge, they were awed
awed and fpeechlefs They almofl lepented of their frenzy, and were half determined to return to their duty Their remorfe indeed was Im¬ perien and ineffectual, but Cailaldo led this band of mutineers through the heart of the kingdom, with as many fymptoms of regularity, modefty and Older, as if they had been the bell paid, the piompteft and mod loyal army m the world My fon fpoke m terms of the wann¬ ed enthufiafm of the defence of Eilor in the period of Caftaldo's laft and moft arduous campaign againft the Turks In refpefl of fortifications the town was fcarcely competent to refill the feebleft enemy, but its de ficiency m this point was fupphed by the conftancy and valour of its gam fon and inhabitants 1 he very women difplayed an enterprife, that the more vigorous fex have feldom exhibited In 2

Shall I join. myfelf to the re¬ negado Bethlem Gabor, and the exe¬ crable Chatillon? No; fuch virtue as I have defcribed never could have been conceived, but in the bofom of truth !

Such weie the adventures and fuch the fentiments of the gallant chevalier de Damville. I bad been a war¬ rior in my youth, and the difcourfe he 'held was fufficiently congenial to my earliefl propenflties. I faw indeed M 5 that
that he had gained, in the zeal of a foldier of the crofs, a fource of martial heroifm, to which my military hiftory had been a ftranger. But, though I could not entirely enter into this fen¬ timent of his, and indeed regarded it as an infatuation and delufion, I did not the lefs admhe the grandeur of foul with which this heroic fable in¬ fpired him. There was no prefent propenfity in my heart that led me to delight in deeds of blood and war; I faw them in their genuine colours without varnifh or difguife; I hated and loathed them from my very in- mod foul ; but, notwithftanding this, I was fenfible to the luftre which military zeal caft round the cha¬ rafler of my fon. Nor is this incre¬ dible or abfurdj the qualities of a generous and enterprifing champion are truly admirable, though the direc¬ tion
tion they have received fliould be wor¬ thy of eternal regret Charles de Damvillc was my friend, and, when I fay this, I einnot help flopping a moment for the indulgence of reflecting on the contiaft between my prefent intereourfe with my fon, and my lite connection with Bethlem Gaboi I hid fought the frieiidfliip of the Hungarian partifan, partly be¬ caufe I wanted a protector and in ally, but partly alfo becaufe m my foul I looked up to and idmired the man I cilled Bethlem Gabor my fncnd r J perfuidcd myfelf tint I nad cogent rea fons foi calling him fj But theie wa» little fvmpithy between us, he wis wrapped up in hi» own contempli tions, he was w ithered by his own cahmitics, our foul» fcircely touched in a fingle point No, no, this is not fiicndflnp M 6 friend.
Friendihip is a neceflity of our na¬ ture, the ftimulating and refllefs want of every fufceptible heart How wretched an impoflure in this point of view does human life for the mod part appear ' With boyifh eyes, full of fanguine fpmts and hope, we look round us for a friend, we fink mto the grave, broken down with years and infirmities, and ftill have not found the objefl of our fearch We talk to one man, and he does not un¬ derfland us, we addrefs ourfelvcs to another, and we find him the unreal fimilitude only of what we believed him to be We ally ouifelves to a man of mtellefl and of worth, upon further experience we cannot deny him either of thefe qualities, but the more we know each other, the •lefs we find of ïefemblancc, he is cold, where we are warm, 1 e ıs harfli, where we are melted into the tendeieft fympathy, I
fympathy, what fills us with rapture, is regarded by lnm with indifference, we fimfli with a didant refpefl, where we looked for a commingling foul, this is not triendflup We know of othei men, we have viewed their countenances we have occafionally fit in their fociety we believe it is impofliole we fliould not find m the n the object we fought But difparity of fituation and diflimilitude 01 con neflions prove as effefltnl a barrier to mtimicy, is if we were inhabitants of different planets It is one of the moft linking chi rafleriftics of the nature of man, that we are eternally apt to grow dead and infenfible to the thing we hive no! Half our faculties become palfied, be fore we ire m the flighted degree awire that we ire not what we were, md what we might be There re philofopheis who regard this as the peculnr
peculiar privilege of man, a wife pro¬ vifion of providence to render us con¬ tented and eafy with our lot in exift¬ ence. For my part, I do not envy, and I have never afpired to, the hap¬ pinefs of ignorance and dupidity. But, be it a blefling or a curfe, the phe¬ nomenon is undoubted. Prefent me with fome ineftimable benefit, that my nature fitted me to enjoy, but that my fortune has long denied me to partake, and I inftantly rife as from an oppreffive lethargy. Before, it may be, I felt myfelf uneafy ; but I knew of no remedy, I dreamed it was my nature, I did not put forth a finger for relief. But now, that I have drawn the unexpefled prize, I grow aftonifhed at my former blindnefs; I become fuddenly fenfible of my pow¬ ers and my worth; the blood that flept in my heart, circulates, and dif- tends every vem; I tread on air; I feel
feel a calm, yet raviflimg delight, I know what kind of an endowment life is, to a being in whom fentiment and affection are awakened to their genu¬ ine action This was the effefl of the mutual attachment produced between me and Charles I looked mto him, and faw a man, I faw expanfive powers of ìn- tellefl and true fenfibihty of heart To be efteemed and loved and pro¬ tected by fuch a man, to have him to take one by the hand, to enquire into one's forrows, to intereft himfelf in one's anxieties, to exult in one's good fortune and one'» joys, this and this only deferves the name of exift¬ ence I had however a painful drawback upon my fatisfaflion It was my fate, fince the vifit of the ftranger of the lake of Confiance, to rejoice for mo¬ ments, and to lament for years I could
could not at firft afcend to that purity and eminence of fiiendfhip, to forget myfelf; I could not but painfully feel the contrail between me and my fon. How happy was Charles, how refpeft. able, how felf-appioving, hovv checi- ful of heart: I ihall prefently have Oeeafion to fpeak of a itili further ad. dition to his happinefsi I looked in¬ deed young, fair and blooming, a (franger to care: but I had a fecret worm gnawing at my vitals. This very deteitfulnefs of my countenance, was a bitter aggravation to my remorfe, I never faw my features reflected in the poliflied ihield, without feeling ■myfelf ftruck to the core. Charles had walked right onward in the paths of lionoUr; he feared no detection; he .bad «β feciet confeioufnefs that gavé íhfc lie to the voioe of applaufe, paiv ■tiality "and friendihip.

I could not bear that, where (he appeared, every eye fliould not be turned to her with reve¬ rence and honour. My paflion, I con¬ fefs it, is that of a difciple of liberal arts and a nobleman, not that of an Arcadian. The period of the campaign now drew to an end, and Charles, having requefted me to accompany him, fet out for his ufual winter-retreat in the city of Prefburg. I faw Pandora. Never in my life had I beheld any thing fo fweetly fimple. I had always been an admiier of the fex ; but the perfeflions of Pandora were of a nature that I had not obferved in any other woman. Her fymmetry was fo per¬ fect, the pearly lufire of her flcin fo N 2 admirable,
admirable, ind her form and carriage fo light and ethenal, that at fird view it was difficult to perfuade one s felf that (lie w as frimed of the fame grofs mitenals is the red of the fpecies She feemed not condrufled to endure the fhocks of the world, and the rude aflaults of ill humour or neglefl, of cenfure or adverfity Her voice was of the fwecteft, the cleared and foft eft tone I ever heard There was a peculiar naivete in her accents, that riveted your foul in irrefiftible fetters Her converfation, for m the fequel I enjoyed much of her converfation, had a very uncommon zeft She feemed to have no art, and what (he uttered appeared as if wholly unchecked by cőnfideration or referve You were perfuaded that (he always delivered without reflraint the firft thing that occurred to her mind, yet m what flie faid there was fo much good fenfe, fo much 2
much true feeling, and, as the occa fion allowed, fo much whim and imagination, that you could not difco- ver how any of her words eould be changed but for a worfe This ur cumftance flnkingly contrafled with the chilchfh fimphcity, or rathtr tlie feminine foftnefs and fylph like dclica cy of her manner ind her tone lhe oppofition of appearance betwt en her and my fon made a ftrong impreflion upon me He was a perfefl foldier, with an ample cheft, bro d flioulders, and ι figure, though graceful mi well proportioned, yet fo ftrong, that it feemed fiamed to contend with ard to conquer the wreftlers in the Grecian games His complexion, (haded with luxuriant cuils of manly hair, was it felf made brown with the rigours of climate Pandora was fo heavnly fair, fo fwectly delicate and Ilender, tliat you would have thought flie w ould N3 be
be withered and dedroyed in his em¬ brace, like the frailed ornament ot the garden before the northern breeze But courage to choofe what is ragged and manlike, is often charaftenflie of the fofteft of hei fex I fpeedily contrafled an intimite commerce with the beautiful Pandora I was naturally defirous to be as con- fummate a judge as poflible of thofe perfeflions, which I believed fated to determine the future happinefs of my fon When fufficiently fatisfied in that refpefl, I L·,! continued the indul¬ gence, and found a pure and ex¬ quifite pleafure in the daily contem¬ plation of accompliihments that were to prove the materials of his gratifica¬ tion and delight, whofe gratification I preferred to my own I had a dill further view in this commerce I was anxious to be perfeflly informed of the connections and family of Pandora, that
that upon them I might build a pro¬ ject I had deeply at heirt, of be¬ llowing on her, in the lead quedion- able and exceptionable manner, а dowry, that diould place her upon an equality with her coufms, the daugh¬ ters ot Nadadi, ind del ν er my fon from all apprehenfion of the ui pleaf mg confequences to lefult from the refentment of the great palatine Na¬ dadi was opulent, and the portions of his daughters very confiderable, and, however inclined, I could not exceed this limit without noting the entu e mifearriage of my projefl Charles thought nothing too rich ei¬ ther in fituation or income to do ho¬ nour to the miftrefs of his foul, but, feparately from this cnthufiaftic fenti ment, both he and Pandora had too juft a tafte, not to prêter the fimple majedy of ancient nobility, to the ex N 4 penfive
penfive oííentations of modem refine¬ ment. Having digefted my plan I was obliged to travel as far as Venice for the execution of it. The mother of Pandora had been a Venetian, and the uncle of her moJier was one of the ad¬ venturers who had failed with Pizarro for the conqueft of Peru. He had died before the completion of that bufinefs, and had left behind bim no relative fo near to him in blood as the lovely Pandora. By a Angular piece of good fortune, I encountered at Venice an individual who had failed in the fame fhip with the young lady's uncle. The uncle having died prematurely, the fliare lie might otherwife have ob¬ tained of the fpoils of Peru was funk in the (hares of the reft, and nothing was allowed to remain that might have defcended to his heirs. His friend aud countryman I found, though once
once rich with the booty he made, had by a fenes of calamities, before he reached his native home, been re- 'uced to a (late of poverty The vl- ciflitudes he experienced had produced m hım the effeft of a very uncommon eagernef» for acquifition This mm I fixed on for my lnftrument, I open ed to him my plan, and offered him a very ample gratification, provided he afled fuccefsfully the part 1 afligned him In concert with each other we digefted and forged the various doeu ments that were bell calculated to give credibility to the tale Hiving completed our arrangement, I fct out for Preiburg without a moments de lay, and direfled my Venetian not t ì follow till after a flipulated· uitu vai He was not to enter into full poffeflion of his reward, till hc had completed the taflc he hid undertaker» It was fixed that no perfon in llun- N 5 gary
gary fliould be acquainted with my viiit to Venice, but only be allowed to underfland generally, that I had been engaged for a certain time in an ex curfion of amufement So hard is the fate of the pofleflbr of the philofopher s ftone, and fo limited his power, as to have rendered all thefe precautions on my part mdifpenfibly neceflary Had not the variou·· circumftances concur red the detail of which is here ftated, the birth of Pandora s mother in a maritime (late, the expedition of Pi zarro to Peru, her uncle s engaging in this expedition and dying before it was completed, ind my own cafual rencounter with his compagnon du voy age, my projefl would too probably have been baffled A direct gift of the for tune I defigned would never have been admitted of, and had not the cornei flence been eminently favourable, even though I fliould have fucceeded in mif leading
leadmg every other party, I could not hope to have eluded the perfpicacity and jealous honour of my fon When I returned to Preiburg, I again renewed my intereourfe with Pan¬ dora The paffion entertained by Dam- ville for the beautiful orphan was a fe¬ cret to every perfon at court, they had managed fo difereetly as to have avoided every hint of fufpicion, and, as it was univerfally known that the great palatine had an eye on this gal¬ lant foldier for one of his daughters, few perfons entertained a doubt that my fon would fpeedily declare his eleQion among the co heireffes of Na- dafi On the other hand, in the fnendly intereourfe between me and Pandora, neither fhe nor myfelf felt that there was any thing to conceal, and it was therefore a matter of com¬ plete notoriety My blooming youth of appeaiance w ıs remaıked , by the N о majority
majority of byftanders we were judged formed for each other, and, before I was aware, the beautiful Hungarian was awarded to me by the general voice as my deilined bride. When however I became acquainted with the rumour, I was contented to fmile at it j the confeioufnefs m my own bread how far the public fagacity had wan¬ dered in its guefs, gave to that guefs in my apprehenfion a eertain air of whim- fical and amufing.

CHAP. XIII. OUCH was the fituation of the affair of Pandora, and I daily looked for the arrival of my Venetian confederate, when fuddenly I remarked an alteration in the carriage of my beautiful ally. She had hitherto on all occafions fought my converfation ; ihe now appeared feduloufly »o avoid me. Her manner had been charaflerifed by the gaiety, the fpritelinefs and general good-hu¬ mour, incident to her age, and conge¬ nial to her difpofition. She was now melancholy. Her melancholy affumed a tone correfpondent to the habits of her mind, and was peculiar and indi¬ vidual. It had an ingenuous and de¬ fencelefs air, inexpreflibly calculated to
to excite intereft. It feemed to alk, what have I done to deferve to be me¬ lancholy? You felt for her, as for a fpotlefs lily deprefied by the unpitying dorm. You faw, that thofe enchant¬ ing features were never made for a face of forrow, and that that bewitching voice ought never to have been mo¬ dulated into an expreflion of heavi- nefie. I was in the higheft degree anxious to learn the caufe of this revolution, and was the furthefl in the world from fufpefling its real foundation. I pur¬ fued Pandora with fo much importu¬ nity, and demanded an interview with fuch irrefiftible eameftnefs, that (he at length confented to grant it. We met in a remote part of tlie garden. Why, Henry, faid ibe, do you thus perie- cute rae? You are my evil genius, the caufe of the greateft calamity that could ever have overtaken me. I darted.
I darted For heaven's fake, beau¬ tiful Pandora, what do you mean ? I love the chevalier de Damv ille I have loved hnn long, he is dearer to me than life, and he has caft me off for ever ' And am I the caufe ? Yes, you, and you alone I had for fome time obferved a change in his be¬ haviour, that he wa» uncommonly grave, ferious and referved I endea¬ voured to foothe him, I redoubled my blandiftlments in our next feafon of unreferved difcourfe, I tenderly en- quned into the fource of his grief For a long time he refilled my im¬ portunity At length, Taithlefs girl, faid he, have you the cruelty to afk the meaning of my depreflion ? This is the extremity of infult. Is it not enough that I know your incoiiflancy ' Is it not enough that I have found you, hke the reft pf your frivolous fex, the mei e
mere flave of your fenfe of fight, re- gardlefs of vows, regardlefs of an af¬ fection wluch defpifed all intereils but that of tendernefs and love, caught by the firft appearance of fomething younger, fofter and more courtly, than I pretend or defare to be ? Will nothing fatisfy you but the confeffion of my unhappinefs ftom my own mouth ? Do you require expoftulation, intrca- ty and defpair from your difcarded lover, to fill up the meafure of your triumph ? For a long time I was totally at a lofs to apprehend my dear chevalier's meaning. No, continued he, I am not jealous. There is no temper I hold in fuch fo- vereign contempt, as jealoufy. I am not of a difpofition eafily to conceive embrage, or lightly to doubt the pro- teftations of the woman I adore. I bave been blind too long. But I fee that
that you are etermlly together I fee that you take advantage ot the diftance at which the defpotic temper of Na- difti keeps us from each other, to pwe all your time to my favoured rival ^ ou feem never to be happy out of his fociety I was firft led to throw oft the dulnefs of my unfufpefling fecu nty, by the general voice of the pub¬ lic The whole court gives you to each other Not a creature it holds, but has difcerned that paflion, which you have the infolence to expefl to conceal from me Since I have been awakened from my fecunty, I have feen it a thoufand times I have feen your eyes feek and encounter each other I have feen them fuddenly lighted up by your interchanging gla ices I h we feen the figns of your mutual intelligence I have feen with what impatience, the moment you could efcape from the crow ed cuele, you
you have joined each other, and re¬ tired together. Ungenerous Pandora ! But do not imagine I will enter the lifts with the gaudy butterfly who has now attrafled your favour. I have told you already that I am not formed for jealoufy. I am not the fort of man you have fuppofed me to be. I have loved you much; I bave loved you bng. But I would tear out my heart from my manly breaft, if I believed it yet retained an atom of paffion for you. I know what it was I loved ; I loved 3 charafler of franknefs, of ingenuouf. nefs, of fimpticity, which I fondly imagined was yours, but whicb I now find was tbe creature of my own fancy. The Pandora that ftands before me j. the» child of art ; the bafe wretch that coulii take advantage of my forbearance in regard to her uncle, which was adopt¬ ed purely out of love to her ; the un¬ feeling coquette tliat would wiih to retain

I endeavoured, continued Pandora, by every imaginable protedation to convince my late faithful tover of his midake. But it was to no purpofe ; all I could fay only tended to fwell the tide of his fearful refentment* Be filent, cried he. Add no fur¬ ther to the catalogue of your wanton and caufelefs delufions. Do not make me hate too much what I once fo Mindly and ardently adored. I feel that I have an enemy within me, that would fain co-operate with your de¬ ceptions and hypocrify. I find that man, treacherous to himfelf, is formed by nature to be the fool of your artful fex. But I will fubdue this propenfity in me, though I die for it. I may be wretched j but I will not defpife my¬ felf. Have I not feen your fallliood ? Have not all my fenfes been wit- nefles of your guilt ? The miracle is that I could have been duped fo long.

that was mod interefting to me bung upon our interview. Ihe pre pal ations however of my journey, though fol- Jowedwith aidour, inevitably reduced me to the being fome hours in the íear of my fon. I was continually in his track, but could not come up with him : to judge from events, you would have fuppofed that he had as flrong a mo¬ tive to fly, as I had to purfue. He led me along the couife of the Danube, to the fource of that far-famed and mu¬ nificent river. I reached the paffage of the Rhine, and was on the point of eroding into Alface. But here I Iod all no¬ tice of Charles, no enquiiy I could make was effeflual to piocure mc the flighteft intelligence'. He had not crofled the river, he had proceed¬ ed neither to the right nor the left along ¡ts banks. I was difappointed, morti¬ ced and didreffed. What was I to do 1 next?
r.ext? Could I return to Pandora? What tale muft I relate to this adorable creature, whom I had urged to depend upon my exertions ? Cotfld I leave her however to the anguifli and uncertamty that mud follow upon her hearing no more either from her lover or my¬ felf' I think I never felt more truly de¬ prefied than in this conjunflure. Moft amply, molt critically did the curfe of the opus magnum attend upon my pro- jefls, and render all my exertions abor¬ tive. It was the fame, whether myj plans were formed upoţi a larger or a. fmaller fcale. When I endeavoured to live in total obfcurity in Madrid, when I undertook to be the ftewaid and the father of the people of Hungary, and now that, with a chaflued am¬ bition I fought, what is permitted to all other human creatures, to pio- vide
vide for the honourable fettlement of my only fon, dill, ftill my evil genius purfued me, and bhfted every concern in which I prefumed to mterfeie I had intruded between two faith¬ ful lovers unfortunate they had been indeed, and confiderable obftacles were interpofed to their felicity, but ob- flacles are commonly found to yield to firmnefs and conftancy, and, with ut my fatal interference, Charles and Pan¬ dora would one day have been happy If by adverfe fates they had hitherto been kept afunder, ftill thev under¬ ftood each other, and rejoiced in their mutual confidence and attachment This, the confolation of ill their for¬ rows and difappointments, it v\ as mine to have deftroyed The globe, for aught I knew, would fpeedily be inter¬ pofed between them, and hc re I flood in the middle point, like one of thofe m-
invincible repulfive powers hid in the ftorehoufe of nature, forbidding to them all future retrogreflion to each other.

1 HE piflure which my diffracted fancy thus fet before the eye of my mind, was not altogether verified m the event After a thoufand fiuitlef» enquiries and perquifitions, I found, to my utter aftomfliment, that Charles, arreftmg his career at the town of Fri¬ bourg, had returned upon his fteps, and fought a fécond time the metro¬ polis of Auftrian Hungary This was of the clafs of thofe events which we fometimes meet with in the world, that baffle all calculation, and ftnke us like magic, or like madnefs, in their authors I had nothing to do, as I conceived, on this oeeafion, but to follow the ex ample
ample of my fon, and like hım to re- fume the route of Prefbuig I yet hoped to w ıtncfs, if not to co operate in, the reconciliation of Chirle» ind Pandora My fpints in this refpefl were revived, and my profpefls made brighter, by the thoughts that thefe v ír- tuous and meritorious lovers were at lad likely to be once again mclofed within the cinflure of the fame city Add to which, my Venetian confede rate had not yet made hi» app arince atPrefburg, antl, not only was lunder engagements to give him the meeting there, but it was alfo cleir that his er rand could not be brought to its proper clofe without my aflidance I once more entered the city to which Pindora owed her birth Charles de Damville had preceded my arrival feveral days I fliould without delav have repaired to his apartments, but that I found at my own lodgings a let¬ ter

This moining I confented to the reprefentations of count Bathori, and agreed that you ihould be deli¬ vered up to juftice Why then are you not in cuftody ? When I confider the myftery and mfcrutablenefs of your charafler, I am loft in conjeflure You are faid to be a magician, a dealer in the unhallowed fecrets of alchemy and the t Inn iitæ In cafes like this all the ordinary rules of human iagacity and prudence aie fuperfeded, the wifeft man is a fool, ind the nobleft fpirit feels the very ground he ftood on ftruck from under his feet How can I know that the feduflion of Pandora's affeflions i» not owing to magical incantations, who in that cafe is rather an objefl for com paflion than for ccnfuie ' How can I tell
tell that the fraternal refcmbhnce borne by y our features to my own, ind the fudden and aident partiality thit rofe in mv breaft when firft I faw you, have not been produced by the moil detened irts ' Magic diffolves the whole prin uple ind arrangement of human ic tion, fubverts all generous enthufiifm and dignity, and renders life itfelf loathfome and intolenble This is to me the mod painful of all fubjefls I had a fithtr whom I ifleflionitely loved he became the dupe of thefe infernal arts I had a mother the piragon of the creition that father murdered her All the anguifli I ever felt, has den cd its fource from alchemy and magic While the infamous Chatillon thus ilands betöre me, I feel all the long forgotten wounds of my heart new opened, and the blood burftmg afteih from every vein I hive refted and been
been at peace. And now the red and tenomed plague, that tamifhed the years öf my opening youth, returns to blaft me. Begone, infamous, thrice- damned villain, and let me never fee thee more ! Wretch that you are, continued Charles, for he faw mc motioning to withdraw I felt that all further expof- tulation and difcuffion oft my part was ufeiefs,—Wretch that you are, what is it that you are about to do? Think net to efcape my vengeance ! In the midft of all the tumultuous paflions you waken in my bread, I flill feel in myfelf the foldier and tihe man of honour. I am not a rtlief-taker or a bailiff. You are within my power, and that is yoar prefent pro- teñion. I will not now deliver you •up to ťhe juftice of the flate, but will miri againft you my perfonal defiance. I am willing to meet you man to man ; I thiift
I third to encounter you as my Worii and mod mortal foe, who has perpe¬ trated againft me the bafefl injuries, and excited in my bofom the mod hateful fenfations. Though you Were fenced with all tho legions of hell, I fear you not ; and, feeing that, after all that is pad, you have once again in¬ truded into my prefence, I hei e bind myfelf by all that is facred to purfue you to the death. What could I anfwer to fuch an at¬ tack ? I faw at once that the cafe, as to all futuie harmony between me and my fon, was defperate and irremediable. What hope could I entertain further ? What had hitherto been the refult of our ill-fated intereourfe ? Every offence and prejudice that can gall tlie humin mind, had been brought forward in it in turn. I had wounded Damville in the mod fenfible point of private life, and had Mailed his hopes there where he
he doied them all I had offended lus mod rooted political prepoffedions, by aiding the Turk, and feeding a na¬ tion that penflied with hungei I was an equivocal charafler, affummg diffe¬ rent names, and wandering over the world with different pretences Lad of all, I had revived in his mmd the images of his father and his mother, all that had once been mod dear, and now was mod painful to his recollec¬ tion , and had tortured his fancy with namelefs horrors The r e fentiments could never be removed All the ex. planations m the world could never re- concle me to his mmd And I felt that I had that within, which, in what was to come, as it had m what was paft, mud for ever annihilate all confidence between us At once therefore I ac¬ cepted his challenge, arranged with him the terms of a hodile encounter on the following mommg, and, imme¬ diately
diately after, bid adieu to Pieiburg, and to the fight of every foul contained within its walls, for ever Tins is, I powerfully teel, the lail adventure, that I fliall ever have the couiage to commit to wilting A few minutes more, and I will lay down my pen, and refolve in the moll folemn and ficied manner never to compofe another line Indeed all otlıeı adven¬ tures muft neceffanly be frigid and un- ıntereflıng, compared with that which I have now defcnbed Great God, what a fate w as mine ' Anxious as I hid been to prove myfelf in the mod mo¬ mentous refpefls the benefaflor of my fon, difmiflmg all other thoughts and cares from my mmd, journeying, with this fole objefl in view, from Prefburg to Venice, md from Venice to Pref¬ burg, from Hungary to the banks of the Rhine, and from the banks of the Rhine back agam to Hungary,—the whole

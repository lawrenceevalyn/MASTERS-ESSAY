CHAPTER I ' Tarry thou till ι come' The words shot through me—-I felt th^m like an arrow m my heart—my brain whirled—my eyes grew dim The troops, the priests, the populace, the world, passed away from before my senses like phantoms But my mind had a horrible clearness As if the veil that separates the visible and invisi¬ ble worlds had been rent m sunder, I saw shapes and signs for which mortal language has no

Wild songs, furious execrations, the rude uproar of my¬ riads stured to the heights of popular passion, filled the air still through all 1 heard tht pur suing «entence, " Tarry thou, till I come," and felt it to be the sentence of incurable agony' I was never to kuow the shelter of the giave ' Immortality on earth '—The perpetual com¬ pulsion of existence in a world madefor change, to feel the weariness of thousands of years bowing down my wretched head, alienated from all the
hopes, enjoj ments, and pursuits of man, to bear tho heaviness of that existence, which palls even wtth all the stimulanta of the most vivid careei of man, life passionless, exhausted, melan eholy, old I would rather have bee ι blown about on the stoims of every region oi the uni¬ verse I w ıs to be a wild beast, and a wild bt ast condemned to pace the same ete»nal cage ' A criminal bound to the floor of his dungeon foi ever' Immortality on earth ' —I was now in the vigour of life , but must it be always so ?

great day was temhle to lum «ho had passed Imt through the common measure of existente, what must he its terrois to the wretch who wat to appear ioidf d with the accumulated guilt of ι thousand lives ' Overwhelmed with despair, I rushed through Jernsalem, with scarcely a consciousness of whither I was going It was the time of the Passover, when the city was crowded with the multitude come to the great festival of the ye ir I felt an instinctive horror of the human coun¬ tenance, and shunned every avenue by which the tribes came in I at last found myself at the Gate of Zion, that leads southward into the open country I had then no eyes foi that wondrous portal which had exhausted the skill of the most famous Ionian sculptois, the master- work of Herod (he Great But I vamly tried to force my w nd way through the crowds *hat lingered on their maich to gaze upon its match¬ less beauty, portal, alone worthy ot the won¬ ders to which it led, like the glory of an even mg cloud opening to lead the eye upwards to the stais
On those days the Roman guard were with drawn, I asc nded the battlements to seek another escape, but the concourse gathered there to look upon the entrance of the tribes, fixed me to the spot Of all the strange and magnificent sights of Earth, this entrance was the most fitted to swell the national pride of com try and religion The dispersion 01 darned by Heaven for judgment on the crimes of our idolatrous kings, had, in that wonder working power by which good is brought out of evil, planted our law in the remotest extremities of the world Among i*s proselytes were the mighty of all regions, the military leaders, the sages, the kings, all, at least once in their hv es, coming to pay homage to the great central ity of the faith, and all coming with the pomp and attendance of their rank The procession amounted to a number which tin ew all aftertimes into the shade Three millions of people have been counted at the Passover The diversities of the multitude were still more striking Every race of mankind in its most marked peculiarities, there passed beneath the eye
Theie came the long tram of swarthy slaves and me-amls round the chariot of the Indian prince, clothed m the silks and jewels of tne, regions beyond the Ganges Upon them pressed the troop oí African hon-hunt eis hilf na\ed, but with their black limbs wreathed wtth pearl and fragments of -in¬ wrought gold Behind them moVed on their с imels α patriarchal group, the Arab Sheik, a venerable figure with his white locks flowing from beneath his turban, leading his sons, like our father Abraham, from the wilderness to the Mount of Vision Then rolled on the glit¬ tering chariot ofthe Assyrian chieftain, a regal show of purple and gems, and convoyed by horse¬ men cove.ed with armour The Scythian Jews, wrapped m the furs of wolf and bear, iron men of the north, the noble Greek, the perfection of the human form, with his countenance beaming the genius and beauty of his country, the broad and yellow features of the Chinese rabbin* , the fair skins and gigantic forms of the German tribes, strange clusters of men unknown to the limits of Europe or Asia, with then black
locks, complexions of the colour of gold, and slight yet sinewy limbs, marked with figures of suns utel staru struck into the flesh, marched trowd on crowd, and in strong contrast with ill, the Italian on the charger or in the chariot urging the living stream to the right and left with the haughtiness of the acknowledged maj ter of mankind. The representative world was before me But all those distinctive marks of countiy and pursuit, though palpably ineradicable by human mears, were deeply overpowered and mingled by the one grand impression of the place and the tune In their presence was the City of Holiness, the Hill of Zion lifted up its palaces, above it ascended, like another city, in a higher region of the air, that Temple to whose majesty the world could show no equal, to which the eyes of the believer were turned from the uttermost parts of the earth in whose courts Solomon, the king of earthly kings for wisdom, had called down the blessing of the Most High, and it had descended on the altar Ín fire, in whose sanctuary the Lord, whom
heaven and the hea\ en of heavens cannot con¬ tain, was yet to make his throne, and give glory to his people Oh Jeiusalem, Jerusalem' when I think of what I saw titee then, and ot what I have suite seen thee, the spoiled, the desolate, the utterly put to shame, when I have seen the Roman plough driven through the soil on which stood the Holy of Holies, the Saracen destroying even its rums, the last, worst devastator, the barbarian oí the Caucasus, the ruffian Turk, sitting m grim scorn upon the towers of the city of Da¬ vid , violating the tombs of the prophet and the king, turning up for plunder the soil, every blade of whose grass, every atom of wh »se dust, was sacred to the broken people of Israel, trampling with savage crueltv, and the eletper torture of infidel insult, my countrymen that hn gered among its walls only that they might seek a grave in the ashes of the mighty, I have felt my spirit uproused, and maddened within me 1 have made impious wishes I have longed tor the lightning to blast the tyrant I still start from my bed when I hear the whirlwi id, and send
forth fierce prayers that its rage may be poured on the tents of the oppressor I unconsciously tear away my white locks and scatter them m bitterness of soul towards the east in the wildness of the moment, I have imagined every cloud that sailed along the night a minister of the descending vengeance I have seen it ι throne of terrible shapes flying on the wings of the wind, majestic spirits and kings of wrath hunyiug thiough tho heavens to poui down sulphurous h ul and fire, as upon the cities of the Dead Sea Τ have cried out with our pio phet, as the vision swept along, "Who is he that cometh from Edom ? with dyed garments from Bozia ? he that is glonous m his apparel, ùavtUmg m the gteatness of his stieugth* Wheiefore irt thou red in thme apparel, and thy gaiments, like him that trtadeth the wme piess ' and I have thouglit that I heard the answer "I, that speak m righteousness mighty to save' I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them m my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stam all my raiment, for the day oí
vengeance ıs ш mine heart, and the year of my ledeeraed is come 1 " Then, when the impulse passed away, and my heart withered within me, my eyes have turned into fountains of tears, and I have wept until moining came, and the sounds ot the world called back its recollections, and for the sacred lulls and valleys that I had imaged in the da/k- nes«, I saw onlj the roofs of some melancholy city, m which I was a forlorn fugitive, or a wil¬ derness, with bat the burning sands and the ıobber before me, or found myself tossing on the ocean, not more fruitless than my heart, nor moi e restless than my life nor more unfathom¬ able than my woe Yet, to the last will I hopt and love Oh Jenmlem ■ Jerusalem ' even m my mirth, if I forget thee ' But those were the thoughts of aftertimes On that memorable and dreadful day, I had no perception but ot some undefinable fate which was to bahati me from mankind ï at length forced mv way through the pressure at the gate, turned to none ofthe kinsmen who railed to me as I passed their chariots and horses, overthrew wtth
desperate and sudden strength atl trho impeded my progress, and scarcely felt the ground till I had left the city behind, and had climbed up through rocks and ruins the mountain that rose drearily before me, like α bârnei shutting out the living world
CHAPTER II. Terror had exhausted me , and throwing myseli on the ground, under tho shade of the stunted grove of palm-trees that thinly crowned the summit of the hill, I fell mto an almost in¬ stant slumber. But it was unrefreshing and disturbed The events of the day agam came before me, strangely mingled with those of my past life, and with others oí which I could form no waking remembiance. I saw my¬ self sometimes debased below man, like tht great Assyrian king, driven out to feed upon the herb of the torest, and wander for years exposed to the scorching sun by day, and the dews that sank chilling upon my naked frame
by night I then seemed filled with supernatu¬ ral power, and rose on wings till earth was di¬ minished beneath me, and I felt myself tear¬ fully alone. Yet there was one predominant sensation, that all this was for punishment, and that it was to be peipetual At length, in one ofmy imaginary flights, I found mjself whirled on the wind, like a swimmer down a cataract, in helpless terror into the bosom of a thunder¬ cloud I felt the weight of the rolling vapours round me, I saw the blaze, I was stunned by a roar that shook the firmament. My eyes suddenly opened, yet my dream appeared only to be realised by my waking Thick clouds of heavy and heated vapoui were rapidly rolling up from the piecipices below, t>nd at intervals a sound that 1 tould not Uisunguish from distant thunder, burst on the wind But the sun was bright, and the ho¬ rizon was the dazzling blue of the eastern heaven. As my senses slowly returned, for I telt like a man overpowered with wine, and a sudden rush of blood across my sight made me dread that I was growing blind,
I was enabled to discover where I was The discovery ¿tse'* was terror I had in my dis¬ traction fled to the mountain on whieh no Jew ever looked without shame and sorrow for the crimes of the greatest king mto whose nos tnis the Almighty ever poured the spirit of life, but on which a Jewish priest, as I was, could not touch without being guilty of defilement I sat on the Mount of Corruption, so called from its having once witnessed the idolatnes of our mighty Solomon, when in his old age he gave way to the persuasions of his heathen wives,—-that irreparable enme for chicli the kingdom was rent, and the strength of Israel scatt°red I saw in the hollows of the hill the spaces, still bearing the marks of burning, and barren for ev*°r, on which the temples of Mo¬ loch, Chemosh, and Ashtaro*h, had lifted their impious magnificence m sight of the House of the living God The very palm trees under which I had snatched that wild and bitter sleep, were the remnant of the groves m which the foul rites of the goddesses of Phoenicia and Assyria once filled the air with midnight abo-
mination, with horrid yells of human sacnfict, almost made more fearful by their mingling with the roar of barbarım revel, the wild dissonance ot tımbıel and horn, the Bacchanalian chorus ol the priesthood and people of impui ity The vapours that rose hot and sitkly before me, were the smokes from the fires kindled m the valley of Hinnom, where the refuse of the animals slaughtered for the use of the tity, and the other pollutions and remnants of things abominable to the Jew, were daily burned. The sullen and perpetual fires, the deadly fumes, and the aspects of the degraded and excluded beings, chiefly public cnmmals, who were employed in this hideous task, gave the idea oí the place of final evil Our prophets, m then threats against the national betrayers, against the proud and the self-willed, the pol luted with idols, and the polluted with that still darker and more incurable idolatry, the worship of the world, pointed to the valley of Hinnom ' The Pharisee, when he denounced the unbelief and luxury of the lordly Sadducee, pointed to the valley of Hmnom ' All,—the Pharisee, the
Essene, the Sadducei in the haughty spirit that forgot the fallen state of Jerusalem, ano the crimes that had lowered her,—the hypo« ite, the bigot, and the sceptic, alike mad with hope less revenge, when they saw the Roman cohorts triumphing with their idolatrous ensigns through the paths once trod by the holy, or were driven aside by the torrent of cavalry, and the gilded chanot on which sat some insolent proconsul fresh from Italy, and looking down on the noblest of our people as the beaten slaves of the stranger, —pointed to the valley of Hmnom ' How often, as the days of Jerusalem hurried towards their end, and by some fatality tht violences of the Roman governors became more frequent and intolerable, have I seen the groups of my countrymen, hunted into some by-wav of the city by the hoofs of the Ro¬ man horse, consuming with that inward wrath which was soon to flame out in such horrors, flinging up their wild hands, as if to upbraid the tardy heavens, gnashing their teeth, and with the strong contortions ofthe Onental coun¬ tenance, the stormy brow and flashing eye, and
hp scareely audible from the force of its own convulsion, muttering conspiracy Then, in despair of shaking ofl that chain which had bound the whole earth, they would appeal to the vengeance of tho endless futuie, and shrouding their heads in their cloaks, stand, like sorcerers summoning up tlemons, each with his quivering hand stretched out towards the accursed valley, and every tongue groaning ' Gehenna '' While I lay upon the summit of the moun¬ tain, m a state which gave me the deepest impression that I had ever conceived of the parting of soul and body, I was startled by the sound of а trumpet It was fiom the temple, which, as the fites below sank with the growing heat of the day, was now visible to me The trumpet was the signal of the third hour, when the first daily satrifice was to be ofiered It was the week of the class of Abiah, of which I was, and this day's service fell to me Though I would have given all that I possessed on eaith to be allowed to rest upon th it spot, polluted as it was, and there moulder away into the dust
and ashes that I had maele my bed, I dared not shri ik from the most solemn duty of the pnesthood. I rose, but it was not till aftei many efforts that I was able to stand, my limbs hud a stony weight and insensibility. I struggled along the summit of the ndge, holding by the stems ofthe palm-trees The second trumpet sounded loudly, and was re echoed by the cliffs I had now no time for delay, and was about to spring down¬ wards towards a path which wound round the head of the valley ant¡ beyond the fires, when my ears were again arrested by the peal that had disturbed me ш my sleep, and my glance, which commanded the whole circuit of the hills round Jerusalem, involuntarily looked for the thun¬ dercloud The sky was without л stam, but the eminences towards the west, on whose lovely slopes of vineyaid, rose, aud oiange grove my eye had so often reposed as on a vast Tynan tarpet tissued with purple and gold, were now hung with gloom, a huge and sullen cloud seemed to bo gathering over the heights, and flashes and gleams of malignant
lustre burst fiom its bosom The cloud deep¬ ened and the distant murmur grew loudei and more continued I hurried to the tity gate Г) mv astonish meut I found the road that I had left so choked up with the multitude almost empty The camels stood tethered in long trains under the trees with scarcely an owner The tents were deserted except by children and the few old persons necessary for their tare The mules and horses grazed through the fields without a keeper I saw tents full of the animals and othei oflerings that the tribes brought up to the great feast, almost at the mercy of any hand that would take them away Where could the myriads have disappeared that had coveied the land a few hours before to the very v erge of the horizon ? The city was still more a subject of astonish ment A panic might have driven away the concourse of strangers in a time when the νιο lences of the Roman sword had given every Jew but too frequent cause for the most sensitive alarm But all within the gate was
equally deserted The stieets were utteily siiipped of the regular inhabitants What but a pestilence or a massacre could have thus ex¬ tinguished the look of hfe m one of the most attive antl populous cities of the east ? The Roman guards were almost the only bungs that I could discover in my passage of the long streets fiom the foot of the upper city to the mount of the temple All this was favourable to my extreme anxiety to escape every eye of my country¬ men, yet I cannot tell with what a throbbing of heart, and variety of fevensh emotion, I at length reached the threshold of iny dwelling Thouglı young, I was a husband and a father What might not have happened since the sun set of the ev enmg before ? for my evil doings, foi which may He, with whom mert y lies at the nght hand and judgment at the left, have mercy on me, had fatally occupied the night I listened at the door, with my heart upon my lips I dared not open it My suspense was at length relieved by my wife s voice, she was weeping I fell on my knees, and thanked Heaven that she was ahye
But my infant' I thought of the sword that smote the first-horn ш the land of bondage, and felt that Judah, guilty as Egypt, might well dread its punishment Was it for my first born that the sobs of its angel mother had arisen m her loneliness 7 Another pause of bitter sus pense— and I heard the laugh of my babe as it awoke in her arms The first human sensation that I had felt for so many hours, was almost overpowering, and, without regarding the squahdness of my dress, and the look of famine and fatigue that must have betrayed where I had been, I should have rushed into the chamber But at that moment the third trumpet sounded I had now no time for the things of this world I plunged mto the bath, cleansed myself from the pollution of the mountain, hastily girt on me the sacerdotal tunic and girdle, and with the sacred fillet on my burning brow, and the censer in my shaking hand, passed through the cloisters, and took roy place befoie the altar
CHAPTER III Oi all the labours of human wealth nnd power devoted to wois! ip, the ttmple within whose courts I then stood was the most mighty In my aftti yeais, the yeais of my unhappy wander¬ ings, fai from the giaves ofmy kindred, I have seen all the most famous shrines of the gieat kingdoms ol ulolatiy Constrained by ciuel tn cumstance, and the still stemei cruelí\ of man. 1 Ьале stood before the altar of tht Ľphesian Ulana, the master piece of Ionian splendour, I have straved through the woods of Delphi, and bctn madeaieluetaut witness of the superb mysteries of that chief of the oracles of impos¬ ture. Dragged in chains, I havt been forced vol i. и

At the distance of almost two thousand jeais, I have its image on mv mind's eye with h ting- and painful fulness I see the court, of the Gentiles circling the whole, a fortress of the whitest marble, with its wail rising six hundred ieet from the valley, its kingly entrance, worthy of the fame if Solomon, its innumerable and stately dwellings for the priests and officers of the temple, and above them, glittering like a succession of diaden^ those alabaster porticoes
and colonnadts m which the chiefs and sages of Jerusalem sat teaching the people, or walked, breathing the puie au, and gazing on the gran¬ deur of a landscape wluth swept the whole amphitheatie of the mountains I see, using above tlus stupendous bound uy, the court ot the Jewish women separated by its poiphvry pill irs and richly sculptuied wall, above this, the separated couit of the men, still higher, the court of the pnests, and highest, the crown¬ ing splendour of all, tlie central temple, the pi ite of the Sanctuary, and of the Holy of Holies, covered with p'ates of gold, its roof planted with lofty spear-heads of gold, the most precious maibles and metals every where flash ing b itk the day, till Mount Mornh stood forth to the eye of the strangei approaching Jerusa¬ lem, what it had been so often descnbed by its bauls and people, a " mountain of snow studded with jewels.'

The sun, which I had seen like а fiery bueklei hanging ovei the tity, was utterly gone. While I looked, the darkness deepened, and the blackness of night, of night without a stai, fell fai and wide upon the horizon It has been my fate, and a fearful part of my punishment, always to conceive that the cai imi ties of nature and nations were connected with my ctime. I have tried to reason away tins impression, but it has clung to me like an iron chain, like tlie shut of the Centaur, notlung
could teir it away that left the life I have felt it hanging ovei my bram with the weight ot a thundercloud, ¿sl ghnced mto the gloom, tht thought smote me, that it was I who had bi о light tins Egyptian plague, this horrid pn- vation of the first element oi hfe upon my touu- tiy, perhaps upon the world, peihaps never to bt relieved, for it came condensing depth on depth, till it seemed to have excluded all possi bihty of the existence of hght, it was like that of our old oppressors, daikness that might be ftlt, the daikness of an universal grave. I formed my fierce deteinunation at once, and lesolved to fly fiom my priesthood, írom my kindled, fiom my country, to linger out my days, my bitter, banished, blasted days, ш some wilderness, where my presence would not be a curse, where but the lion and the tig^r should be »ny fellow dwellers, where the sands could not be made the moie barren for my fatal tread, nor the fountains more bitter for my desperate and eteinal teais.

The voice Τ knew at once— it was Lunam s But in the disorder ofmy bram, and the strange ciicumstances which had fille л the late days, m that total feebleness too in which I could not mov e α limb or utter a woid, a persuasion seizetl me that I was already beyond the final boundary of mortals All before me was like that paradise from which the crime of our gre it foicfuther had driven man into banishment I remembered the con¬ vulsion ofthe earth in winch I had sunk, and asked myself, could man be wrapped in the flame, and the whulwind that toie up moun¬ tains like the roots of flowers, and yet live' Stil' it was pain to me to think that the lovely

bj tears and sighs of delight With the buist of the earthquake, the supernatural daikness was cleared away I was flung undei the shelter of one of those eaves which abound in the gorges of the mount tins round Jerusalem Miriam, and her infant were flung by my side, yet unhurt. While I lay insensible in her i.rnis, she, by singular good foitune, tound her¬ self surrounded by a troop of our kinsmen, re¬ turning from the city, wheie terror had suffered but few to remain They placed her and her infant on their camels Me they would have consigned to the sepulchre of the priests, but Miriam was not to be shaken m her purpose to watch over me until all hope was gone. I was thus earned along , and they were now thiee days on their journey homewaids The land¬ scape before me was Samaria My natuial destination would have been the titles of the priests, vvhich lay to the south, boi denng upon Hebtou In those thu teen opulent and noble residences allotted to the higher nnnistiy of the temple, tbey enjoyed all that could be offered by the munificent wis-
dom of tho state,—wealth, that raised them above the pressures of life, yet not so great as to extinguish the power of uitellet tual distinc¬ tion, οι the love of the loftier virtues — The means of mental cultivation were provided fot them, with more than royal liberally Copies of the sacred books, multiplied in every form, ond adorned with the finest skill of the pemil and the sculptor in gold and other preuous materials, attested at once the re¬ verence of the nation tor its law, and the perfection to which it had brought the deco¬ rative arts The works of strangers, eminent for genius or knowledge, or even for the sin gulanty of their subject, were not less lo be found in those stately tieastue houses of mind There ihe priest might relax his spirit from titt sublimer studies of his countrj, by the bold and brilliant epic of Gieece, the fantastic pas¬ sion, antl tigurtd beauty of the Ptisian poesy , or the alieniate severity and sweetness of the Indian drama —that startling union of all lovely images oi natine, the bloom and fragrance of flowers, the hues of the oriental heaven, and the
perfumes of isles of spice and cinnamon, with the grim and subterranean terrors of a gigantic idolatry. Uiere he might spread the philoso¬ phic wing from the ghttenug creations of Gre¬ cian metaphysics, to their dark and early ora¬ cles in the East, or, stopping in his central flight, plunge into the profound of Egyptian mystery, where science lies, like the mummy, w rapped in a thousand folds that preserve the form, but preserve it with the living principle gone. Music, of all pleasures the most intellectual, that glorious painting to the ear, that rich mas¬ tery of the gloomier emotions of our nature, was studied by the pnesthood with a skill that influenced the habits of the countrj How often have my fiercest perturbations sunk at the sounds that once filled the bieezes of Juelea' How often, when my bram w as burning, and the blood ι an through my vems like molten brass, ha\e I been softened down to painless tears, by the chorus fiom our hills, the mellow har¬ monies of harp and horn, blending with the voices of the jouths and maidens of Israel 1
How often have I in the night listened, while the chaunt, ascending with a native nchut ss to wind nt skill of other nations was disso nance, fbated upwdids like a cloud oi incense bearing the aspuations of holiness and gi ttitude to tbe throne of Hnn whom man hath not seen, But those times are sunk deep in the great gulf, that absorbs the happiness ¡md genius of man I h tv e s nee traversed my countiy in its length and bieadth , I have marked with my weary feM: every valley, and made my lestless bed upon tvery hiUfrom Idumea to Lebanon, and from the Assyrian sands to the waters of the Mediterru em, yet the harp and voice were dead I he ud sounds on the hills, but they were the cries of the villagers flying befoie some tyrant gatherer of a tyrant s tribute I heard sounds m the midnight, but they were tht howl of the wolf, and the yell of the hy -тзпа, revelling over the naked and dishonouied graves which the luik had given m his scorn to the people of my fathers But the study to which the largest expendí-
tuio of Avealth and labour was devoted, was, as it outjht to be, that of the sacred books of ísiael It only makes ine rebellious against the tleciees of fate, to thmk of the incomparable nchness and immaculate character of the vo lumes over which I have so often i ung , and look upon the diminished and degraded exterior in which their wisdom now lies befoie man Wheie iie now tbe cases coveied with jewels, the clasps of topaz and diamond , the golden aiks in which tlie volume of the hope of Israel lay, too pre cious not to be humiliated by tbe contact with tven the richest treasure of earth } Wheie are the tissued curta ns, that hid, os in a sanctuary, that mighty roll too sacred to be glanced on by the casual eje ?

CHAPTER V The countiy through which we passed, aftei leaving the boundaries of Smnaria—where, with all its peice, no Jew could tread, but asm ι land of strangers—was new to ine My hfe had been till now spent in study, or in serving the aitai , and I had heard, with th n usual and unwise indifference of men devoted to books, the praise of the picturesque and stately provinces that still ıemaıned to om People I was now to see ior myself, and be compelled, as we advanced, to leproach the idle prejudice that had thus long deprived me, and might for ever depnve so many of my consecrated brethren, of an enjoy¬ ment cheering to the human heart, and full
of lofty and hallowed memory to the man of Israel. As we passed along, less travelling thin wandering at pleasure, through regions where e\eiy winding of the marble hill, oi ascent of the lovely and fruitful valley, showed us some sudden and romantic beauty of lmdscape, my kiusmen took a natural pude in pointing out the noble features that made Canaan a living his toıy of Pıovıdence What were even the trophy coveied hills ot Gieece, or the monumental plains of Italy, to the hills and plains where the memorial told of the miracles, and the presence ofthe Supreme " Look to that rock,' they would exclaim, ' there descended the angel of the Presence ' On the summit of that cloudy ridge stood Ezekitl, when he saw the vision of the lattei days Look to yonder cleft in the mountains— theie fell the lightning from heaven on the Philistine " In our tiavel we reached a valley, a spot of singular beauty and seclusion, blushing with flowers, am) sheeted with the olive from its
edge down to a stream that rushed brightly through its bosom There was no dwelling of man in it, but on а gentler slope of the decli¬ vity stood а gigantic terebmth-tree. More than curiosity was attracted by this delicious spot, for the laugh and talking of the caravan had instantly subsided at tbe sight All, by a common impulse, dismounted from their hoises and camels, and though it was still far from sunset, the tents were pitched, and preparations made for pi ayer The spot reminded me of the valley of Hebron, sacred to the Jewish heart as the buml place of Abraham, Sarah, aud Isaac,— may thty sleep in the bosoin of the Lord ' The terebinth tree, under which the greatest of tbe patnaichs sat and talked with the angels— the fountain—the cave of Macpelah, in which his moital remnant returned to the earth, to come agam in glory, appeared to lie befoie me From the day of my unspeakable crime, I had never joined m prayer with my people I was still a believer m the faith of Isıa û l I even clung to it with the nervous violence of one
who, in a shipwreck, feels that his only hope is the plank in his grasp, and that some moie powerful hand is tcaiing even that plank away But the sight of hum in beings enjoying the placid consolations of prayer had fiom the first moment overwhelmed me with so keen a sense oí my misfortune—the pious gentleness of atti¬ tude and voice—the calm uplifted hand, and low and solemn aspiration, were so deep a contnst to the involuntary wildness and broken utter- mgs of a heart bound in more than adamantine chains, that I shrank from the rebuke, and howled m solitude I went forth into the valley, an X was soon lost ш its thick vegetation The sound or the hymn that sank down m mingled sweetness with the murmuring of the evening air through the leaves, and the bubbling ofthe biook below alone told me that I was near human beings I s it upon a fragment of turf, embroidered is never was kmgly footstool, and with my hands cl isped on my eyes, to remove from me all the images of life, gave way to that visionary and wasteful mood oí mind, m which ideas come
and pass m crowds without shape, and leaving no more impression thau the drops of α sun- shower on the trees. I had remained long in this half-dreaming confusion, and had almost imagined myself transported to some interme¬ diate realm of being, where a part of the mflic tion was that of being startled by keen flashes of light from this upper world, when I was roused by the voice of Eleazer, the brother of Miriam, at my side His manly and generous countenance ex¬ pressed mingled anxiety and gladness at dis¬ covering me. "The whole camp," said he, " have been alarmed at your absence, and have seaiched, foi these thiee hours, through eveiy pait of oui day s journey. Minam's distraction at length urged me to leave her, and it was by her instinct th it I took my way down the only path hitheito unsearched, and where, m deed, from feai or reveience of the place, few but myself would have willingly come ' He called to an attendant, and sending lnm up the side of the valley with the tidings, we followed ■elov'y, for I was still feeble As we emelgeti
into an openei space, the moon lying on masses of cloud, hke a sultana pillowed on couches of bilver, showed me, in hei stiong illumination of the forest, the fl.isb.es wli ch had added to the bewildered pain of my levtite While I talked With natuial animation oí the splendour of the heavens, and pointed out the lines and figures on the moon's disk, which made it probable that it was, like earth, a place of habitation, he suddenly pressed my hand, and stopping, with his eyes fixed on iny face, " How," said he, " does it happen, my friend, my brother, SahtlueP"------1 started, as if my name, the uame of my illustnous ances¬ tor, direct m descent from the father of the faithful, were an accusation He pioceeded With but a moie ardent pressure of my quiver¬ ing hand— " How is it to be accounted for, that you, with suth contemplations, and the knowledge that gives them the dignity of science, can yet be so habitually given over to gloom ? — Sei ious crime I w ill not believe in you, though the best of us are »timed But your character is pure 1 know your natuie to be
too lofty for the degenerate indulgence of the passions, aud Miriam's love for you, a love passing that of woman, is, of itself, a seal of virtue Answer me—Can the wealth, power, or influence of your brothei and his house, nay, of his tribe, assist you ? " I was silent He paused, and we walked on awhile, without a sound but that of our tread among the leaves but his mmd was full, and it would have way " Salathiel," said he, "you do injustice to yourself, to your wife, and to 5 our fnends This gloom that sits eternally on your foretiead, must wear away all your uses in society it bathes your incompaiable wife's pil¬ low in tears, and it disheartens and distresses us all Answer me as one man of honour antl integrity would another Have you been disap pointed in youi ambition ? I know your claims.— You hav e knowledge surpassing that of a multi¬ tude of your contemporaries,—you have talents that ought to be honoured your character is unimpeached antl uuunpeac hable. —Such things ought to have already lifted you to eminence. Have you found youiself thwarted by the com-
mou tiickery of oflicial Ufe ? Has some paltry sycophant crtpt up before you by the oblique path that honour disdains ? Or have you felt yourself an extluded and marked man, merely lot tiie display of that manlier vigour, richer genius, and moie generous antl sincere impulse of heait, which to the conscious inferiority of the rabble of understanding, is gall and worm¬ wood ? Or have you taken too deeply into y our resentment, the common crimini! negligence that besets common minds in power, and makes them carelessly fling away upon incapacity, and guiltily withhold from worth, the rewards which were intrusted to them, as a sacred deposit, for the encouragement of the national ability and virtue ? ' I strongly disavowed alî conceptions of the kind, and assured lum that I felt neither pe cubai merits noi peculiar injuries I had seen too much of what ambition and worldly success weie made of, ti allow hope to excite, or failure to depiess me. ' I am evei," added I, " so fai from being the slave of that most vulgar in temperance of a deiaiiged heart, the diseased
craving for the miserable indulgences of worldly distinction, that wouh 1 to Heaven I might never agam enter the gates of Jerusalem " He started back in surprise The tontts- sion had been altogether unintended, and 1 looked up to see tho burst of Jewish wrath descending upon me —I saw none My kins- mau s fine countenance was brightened with a lofty joy ' Then you have renounced.—But no, it is yet too soon —At your age, with your prospects, can you have lenounced the caieer ofiered to you among the rulers et Israel'' ' I ltave renounced ' " Sincerely, solemnly, upon conviction*" " From the bottom of my soul , now, and AVe had reached the open spite ш fiont ot the terebinth tiee that stood in majesty, extending its stvtely branches ovei a spice tieaied of all othei tiees, а sovereign of the forest. In silence he led me undei the shade to a smill tomb on wlneh the light fell with broken lustie ' 'Ihis, ' said he, ' is the
tomb of the gieatest piophet on whose lips the wisdom oí Heaven evei burned Thtt e sleeps Isaiah '-Tht-e is silent the voice that foi fifty years spoke more than the thoughts of man in the eais of a guilty people —There are cold the hands that struck the harp of more than moital sounds to the gloiy of Him to whom earth and its kingdoms aie but as the dust of the balance —Thei e lies the heart whicli neithei the desert nor the dungeon, nor the teeth of the lion, nor the saw of Manasseh, could tame —the denouncer of our crimes—the scourge of our apostasy— the prophet of tbat desolation which was to bow the grandeui of Judah to the grave, as the tree of the mountain iu the whulwind Saint and martyi, let my life be as thine, and if it he the will of God, let my death be even as thine ' He threw himself on his knees, and remained in prayer foi a time I knelt with hmi, but no prayet would issue from my heart He at length rose, and leading ine mto the moon-iight, said, in a low voice—"Is there not, where the holy sleep, a holiness m the very ground ·* I waive alt the superstitious feelings of the idolater,
woi shipping the dust of the creatuic, for tho king alike * I ill I pass over the natural human homage for the memory of those who have risen above us by the great qualities of their being. But if there are superni?! influences acting upon the mmd of man, if the winged spirits that mimster before the throne still descend to eaith on missions of mercy, I will believe that theu loved place is round the grave where sleeps the mortal poition of the holy. In all our journeys to the temple, it has been +he custom of our shattered and humiliated tribe to pause beside this tomb, and offer up our homege to tbat Mightiest of the mir^hty, who made such men for the lights of Isiael ■" He earnestly repeated the question—" Have you abandoned jour oflice ? '—"Yes," was the answer, " totally, with full purpose never to re¬ sume it In your mountains I will live with you, antl with you I will die * Memory smote me as I pronounced the word the refuge of the grave was not for me' "Then," sud he, "you have relieved my spirit of a load you aie now my more than
brother " He clasped me m his arms " Yes, Salatluel, I know that your high heart must have scorned the piejudiees of the Scribe and the Phansee, you must have seen through and loathed tho smiling hypocrisy, the rancorous bigotry, the furious thirst of blood that are hourly sinking us below the lowest of the heathen Hating the tyranny of the Roman as I live tms hour, I would rather see the citv of David inhabited by none but the ulolater, 01 delivered over to the curse of Babylon, and made the couch of the lion and the serpent than see its courts filled with thojc impious tiaitors to the spirit of the law, tliose 1 1 uel extortioners under the mask oí self denní, those malignant levellers m human torture undei the name of insulted religion , whose joy is crime, and every hour of whose being but wearies the long suffering of God, and precipi tates the nun of my country He drew from his bosom, ind unrolled in the moonlight, a small copy of the Scnptures My brothei, said he, " have you read the holy prophéties of him by whose 0 iave we
stand" My only answer was a smile, they were the chief study of the priesthood. "True, ' said he, "no doubt, you have read the words oí the prophet But Wisdom is known of her children, and of tbem alone Rtatl heie" 1 read the famous Haphtorah " Who hath believed oui report, and to whom is the aim of the Lord îeveaWl ?

took the roll with a sigh, and replaced it m his robe, then with his hands clasped iciosa his bosom, and his head bowed, he led our «lient way up the side of the valley

We soon reached the hill country, and our load passed thiough what were once the al¬ lotments of Issachar, Zebulon, and Asher, but bj the Roman division, was now Upper Galilee My health had been rapidly restored by the exercise and the balmy air My more incu- ıabîe disease was pievented by the lourney from peihaps totally engrossing my mind. Oí all the antagonists to menial depression, travel¬ ling is the most vigorous not the flight from place to place, as if evil was to be outrun , nor the enclosure of the weary of life in some nar¬ row vehicle that adds fever and pestilence to heaviness of heart, but the passing at our ease
through the open air and bright landscape of a new country. To me the novelty and loveliness of tho land were combined with the memory of the most striking events in human record I had, too, the advantage of a companionship, wluch would have enlivened travel through the Wilder¬ ness—brave and cheerful men, and women on whose mmds and forms Nature laid her finest stamp of beauty. The name of Jew is now but another title for humiliation Who that sees that fallen thing, with his countenance bent to the ground, and his form withered of its comeli¬ ness, tottering through the proud streets of Europe m some elegrading occupation, and clothed ш the robes of the beggared and the de spised, could imagine the bold figures, and gal¬ lant bearing of the lion-hunters, with whom, in tbe midst of shouts and songs of careless joy, T spuired my barb up the mountain paths of Galilee ' Yet, fallen as he is, the physiognomy of the Jew retains a shine of its original beauty, suffi¬ cient to estabhsh the claim ofthe people to have
1 een the h indsoniest race on earth Ii dividuals of superur comeliness may often be found among the multitutles of mankind But no nation nor distmtt part of any nition can rival an equal number of the unhappy exiles of Israel in the onginal impress of that hand which made man only a little lower than the angels Tev conceive the Jew as lie was we should conceive the stern a id watchful con traction of tbe dark eye expanded the fierce and ridgy brow 10 Ting no more the hp no longei gathcied in h ıhı uil feai or scorn the cheek no longer sail w with want or pining and the wliole man ele ated by the leturning consciousness that he has a rank ^ong n itions All his elefonntties 1 tve been the birth of his misfoi tunes What beauty can we demand from the dungeon ? —what dignity oi aspect from the hewers of wood and dr twers of w ater for mani niel Wheie sh ill we seek the magnificent form and illumined countenance of tht hero and the sage —from tht htart tanktrtd by the chain from the plundtie 1 tht cnshveel tht persecuted of two thousan I ye irs ?
Of the daughters of my country I have never seen the equals m beauty Our blood was Arab, softened down by various changes of state and climate, till it was finally brought to perfection in the most genial air, and the most generous soil of the globj The vivid features ofthe Arab countenance, no longer attenuated by the desert, assumed, in the plenty of Egypt, that fulness and fine proportion which sull be¬ longs to the dwellers by the Nile, but the true change was on our entrance into the promised land Peace, the possession of property, days spent among tlte pleasant and healthful occu¬ pations ot rural life, are m themselves pro¬ ductive ofthe finer developements of the human form, a foim whose natural tendency is to beauty But our nation had an additional and unshared source of nobleness of aspect, it was free The state of man in the most unfettered republics of the ancient world was sl ivery, com¬ pared with the magnanimous and secure esta bhshment of the Jovvish commonwealth During the three hundred goldeu years, from Moses to Samuel,—before,for oursins, we were givenover
to the madness of innovation, and the demand of an earthly diadem,—the Jew w as fiee, in the loftiest sense of freedom, free to do all good, restricted only from evil, evtry m.m pursuing the unobstructed course pointed out by his genius oi his fortune , eveiy man piotected by laws inviolable, or whose violation was instantly visited with punishment by the Eternal So vereign alike of ruler and people. Freedom ' twin sister ot Vntue, thou bright est oí aH the spirits that descended m the train of Religion iiom the throne of God, thou that leadest up man again to the early glories of his being, angel, fiom the cncle of whose presence happiness spieads like the sun-hght ovrr the darkness ot the lund , at the waving of whose sceptre, knowledge, and peace, and fortitude, and wisdom, stoop upon the wmg, at tht voice of whose trumpet the more thun giave is broken, and slavery gives up her dead, w hen shall I see thy coming ' Wh ίι shall I hear thy summons upon the mountains ofmy country, and îejoice in the regeneration and glory of the sons of Judah * I have traversed nations, and as I set my
foot upon their boundary, I have ч ud, Fieedom is not here l I saw the naked lull, the morass steaming with death, the field covered with weedy f illow, the sickly thicket encumbering the land ,—I saw the still more infallible signs, the downcast visage, the form degraded at once by loathsome indolence and desperate poverty, the peasant cheerless and feeble in his field, the wolfish robber the population of the cities crowded into huts and cells with pestilence for their fellow ,—I saw the contumely of man to man, the furious vindictiveness of popular rage, and I pronounced at the moment, This people is not fiee In the republics of heathen antiquity, tho helot, the client sold for the extortion of the patron, and the bora bondsman lingering out hfe m thankless toil, at once put to flight all conceptions of freedom In the midst of altars fuming to liberty, of harangues glowing with the most pompous protestations of scora for servitude, of crowds inflated with the presump tion that they disdained a master, tho eye was insulted with the perpetual chain The
temple of Liberty was built upon the dungeon Rome came, and unconsciously avenged the in suited name of freedom, the master and the slave were bowed together, the dungeon was made the common dwelling of all In the Italian republics oí after ages, I saw the vigour that, living in the native soil of em pne, has always sprung up on the first call The time was changed since Italy pouied its legions over the woild The volcano was now aVeping, yet the fire still burned within its womb, and threw out in its invisible strength the luxuriant qualities ofthe land of power Tbe innate Ro¬ man passion for sovereignty was no longer to find its triumphs in the field , it rushed up the paths of a loftier and more solid glory with a speed and strength that left mankind won denng below The arts, adventure, legislation, literature in all its shapes, of the subtle, the rich and the sublime, were the peaceful triumphs, whose laurels will entwine the Itahan brow, when the wreath of the Cæsars ıs remembered but as a badge of national folly and crime But those republics knew freedom only by
the name All, within a few years from then birth, abandoned its living principles—justice, teuperance, and truth I saw the soldiery of neighbour cities marching to mutual devas tation, and I said, Freedom is not here' I saw abject privation mingled with boundless luxury, in the midst of the noblest works of architecture, the hovel, in the pomps of citi zens covered with cloth of gold, gazing groups effaces haggard with beggaiy and sin , I saw the sold tribunal, the inexorable state prison, the established spy, the protected assassin, the secret torture, and I said, Freedom is not here ' The pageant filled the streets with more than kmgly blazoniy, the trumpets flounshed, the multitude shouted, the painter covered the walls with immortal emblems, in honour of free dom , I pointed to the dungeon, the rack, and the dagger ■ Bitterer and deeper sign than all, I pointed to the exile of exiles, the broken man, whom even the broken trample, of all the un done the most undone, my outcast brother in the Dİood of Abraham - I am not about to be his defender, I am
not regardless of his tremendous crime, I cannot stand up alone agamst the voice of universal man, which has cned out that thus it shall be, but I say it from the depths of my soul, and as I hope for rest to my miseries, that I never saw freedom survive in tuat land which loved to mite the Jew - I saw one republic more, the mightiest and the last, for the justice of Heaven on the land, the most ternble for the mercy of Heaven to mankind, the briefest in its devastation But there all was hypocrisy that was not open horror, the only equal rights weie those oí the equal robber, the sacred figure of Liberty veiled its face, and the offering on its violated slume was the spoil cf honour, bravery, and \ irtue The daughters of our nation, sharing in the rights of its sons, bore the lofty impression that virtuous freedom always stamps on the human features But they had the softer graces öf their sex in a degree unequalled in the ancient world While the woman of the East was im¬ mured behind bolts and bars, from time imme VOL I D
niorial a piisoner, and the woman of the West was a toy, a savage, or a slave, our wives <*»d maidens enjoyed the intercourses of society, which their talents were well calculated to cheei and adorn They were skilled on the haip, their sweet voices were tuned to the liehest strams of earth they were graceful in the dance, the writings of om bards wtre m theu hands, and what nation ever possessed such illustrious founts of thought and vntue 9 But there was anothei and a still highei ground foi that peculiar expression whicli makes their countenance still lighten before me, as some¬ thing of more than mortal beauty The earliest consciousness of every Jewish woman was— hat she might, in the hand of Providence, be the sacred source of a blessing and a glory that throws all imagination into the shade , that of her might be born a Being, to whom earth and all its kings should bow ' the more than man ' the more than angel' veiling for a httle time his splendours in the form of man, to raise Israel to the sceptre of the world to r use that w orld into a renewed paradise, and then to ι e-
sumo lus οι igmal glory, and be Sovereign, Crea¬ tor, God—all ш all * This consciousness, however dimmed, was never forgotten, the misfortunes of Judah never bieaking the strong link hy whicli we held to the future The reliance on predictions per¬ petually renewed, and never more vividly re¬ newed than in the midst of our misfortunes, л reliance commemorated in all the gieat ceremo¬ nies of our nation, ш our worship, m oui fes¬ tivals, m every baptism, in every marriage, must have filled л large space in the susceptible mind of woman What but the mmd forms the countenance ? and what must have been the moulding of that most magnificent and elevating of aU hopes, for centuries, on the most plastic and expressive features in the world ' Sacredly reseived from intermixture with the blood of the stranger, the hope was spread throughout Israel The line of David was pure, but its connexion had shot widely through the 1 uid It was like the Indian tree taking root through a thousand trees. Every Jewish woman might hope to be the living altar, on
which tht Light to lighten the Gentiles was to descend ' The humblest might be the blesstd among women ' the mother of tho Messuili ' But all is gone Ages of wandering, woe, poverty, contumely, and mixture of blood, have done their work of evil The loveliness may partially remain, but the glory of Judah s daughters ıs no more
CHAPTER VII Wr continued ascending through the defiles of the mountain range of Carmel The gorges of the lulls give us alternate glimpses of Lower Galilee and of the great sea which lay bound¬ ing the western horizon with azure The morn¬ ing breezes from the land, now in the full vegetation of the rapid spring of Palestine, scarcely ceased to fill the пеатепз with fra¬ grance, when the sea-wind sprang up, and, with the coolness and punty of a gush of fountain waters, renewed the spirit of life m the air, and made the whole caravan forget its fatigue Our bold hunters spurred down the valleys, and up the hills, with the wildness of superfluous vigour,
tossed their lances into the air sang their mo intain songs and shouted the cries of the chase and the battle On one eventful day a wolf was started from its covert tnd every rein was let ioose m а moment nothing could stop the feailess ness of the riders or exhaust the fire of the steeds The caravan coming on slowly with the women and children, and lengthening out among the passes was forgotten I scoi ned to be left behind and followed my d mug com panions at full speed The wolf led us a long chase, and on the summit of a rock still blazing in the sunlight like a beacon while the pi un was growing dim he fought his last fight and, transfixed with a hundred lances died the death of a hero But the spot which wc had reached supplied statelier contemplations we were on the sum mit of Mouut Tabor the eye wandered over the whole glory of the Land of Promise To the south extended the mountains of Samaria their peaked summits g'owing in the sun with the co loured brilliancy of a chain of gems To the east
lay the lake of Tiberias, a long line of purple Northwaid, like a thousand rainbows, ascend¬ ed, lit by the western flame, the mountains of Gilboa, those memorable hills on which the spear of Saul was broken, and the first cui se of our obstinacy was branded upon us in the blood of our first king Closing the superb tírele, ascended step by step the Antihl anus, soaring into the very heavens Of all the sights that nature offers to the eye and mind of man, mountains have always stirred my strongest feelings I have seen the Ocean when it was turned up from the bottom by tempest, and noon was like night with the conflict of the billows and the storm that tore and scattered them in mist and foam across the sky I have seen the Desert rise around me, and calmly, in the midst of thousands uttering cries of horror and paralysed by fear, have contemplated the sandy pillars coming like the advance of some gigantic city of conflagration flying across the wilderness, every column glow¬ ing with intense fire, and every blast death, the sky vaulted with gloom, the earth a furnace
But with me, the mountain—in tempest or in calm, the thione of the thundei, or with the evening sun ρ tinting its dells and declivities m colours dipt m heaven—Ins been tlte source of the most absotbmg sensations —there stands magnitude giving the instant impiession of a power above man—grandeur that defies decay —antiquity that tells oí ages unnumbered— beauty that the touch of time makes only more beautiful—use exhaustless for the ser¬ vice of man—strength imperishable os the globe,—the monument of eternity,—the truest earthly enuVem of that overliving, unchange able, irresistible Majesty, by whom and for whom all things were made ' I was gazing on the Antilibanus, and peopling its distant slopes with figures of other worlds ascending and descending, as in the patriarch's dream, when I was roused by the trampling steed of one of my kinsmen returning with the wolfs head, the trophy of his supenor prowess, at his saddle bow " So, said he, " you dis¬ dained to share the last battle of that dog of the Gahlees? But we shall show you something
better worth tho chase, when we re ch home The first snow that drives the lions down from Eebano.1, or the first hot wind that send' the panthers flying before it from Assyria, will have all our villages up in arms, every man that can draw a bow, or throw a lance, will be on the moun tains , and then we sliall give you the honours of a hunter in exchange for your philosophy He uttered this with a jovial laugh, and a hand grasping mine with the gripe of a giant ' ' Yet, ' said he, and a shade passed over Ins brow, " I wish we had something better to do , you must not look down upon Jubal, and the tribe of your brother Lleazar, as mere rovers after wolves and panthers ' I willingly declared my respect for the intre¬ pidity and dexterity which tho mountain life ensured I apphuded its health, activity, and cheerfulness " Yet, ' interrupted Jubal sternly, "what can be done while those Romans are everywhere round us 7 ' He stopped short, reined up his horse with a sudden force, that made the animal spring from the ground, flung his lance high in air, caught it in the fall,
and having thus relieved his indignation, re¬ turned to discuss with me the chances of Ro¬ man war " Look at those," said he, pointing to the horsemen who were now bounding across the declivities to rejoin the caravan, " their horses are fiarae, their bodies are iron, and their souls would be both, if they had a leaeler "— " Eleazar is brave," I replied " Brave as his own lance," was the answer, " no warmer heart, wiser head, or firmer arm, moves at this houi within the borders of the land But he despairs "—" He knows," said I, " the Roman power and the Jewish weakness " " Both, both, too well'" was the reply "■ But he forgets the power that is m the cause of a people fighting for their law, for their rights, in the midst of glorious remembrances, nay in the hope of a help greater than that of the sword Look at the tract beyond those linden trees " He pointe l to a broken extent of ground, darkly distinguishable from the rest of the plain " On lhat ground, to this moment wear rog the look of a grave, was drawn up the host
of Sisera, under that ground ıs their grave. By this stone," and he struck Ins lance on a ïough pillar defaced by time, " stood Deborah the prophetess, prophesying against the thousands and tens of thousands of the heathen below. On this hill were drawn up the army of Barak, as ι drop in the ocean, compared with the infi¬ del multitudes They were the ancestois of the men whom you now see trooping befoie you, the men of Naphtali, with their brothers of Zà¬ bulon On this spot they gathered their might like the storm of Heaven From this spot they poured down like its whirlwinds and lightnings upon the taunting enemy God wa their leader They rushed upon the mne hundied scythed chariots, upon the mailed cavalry, upon the countless infantry Of all, but one escaped fiom the plain oí Jezreel, and that one only to pensh in his flight by the degradation ofa wo¬ man's hand ■ ' He wheeled round his foaming horse, and appealed to me " Are the Roman legions more numerous than that host of the dead ' Is Israel now less valiant, less wronged, or less indignant' Shall no prophet arise among
us again 7 Shall it not be sung agam, as it was then sung to the harps of Israel—' Zebu¬ lon and Naphtali were a people that jeopardied their lives unto tho death ш tbe high places of the land' í I looked with involuntary wonder at the change wrought in him by those proud recollec¬ tions The iude and jovnl hunter was uo more, the Jewish warrior stood before me filled with the double impulse of generous scorn of the oppression, and of high dependence on the fates of his nation His countenance was en¬ nobled, his form seemed to dilate, his voice grew sonorous as a trumpet A sudden burst of the declining sun broke upon his figure, and threw a sheet of splendour acioss the scarlet turban, the glittering tunic, the spear-point lifted in the strenuous hand, the nchly-capansoned fron and sanguine nostril of his impatient charger. A Gentile would have worshipped Inm as the tutelar genius of wai I saw in him but the raau that our history and our law were ordained, beyond all otheis, to have made,—the native strength of character raised into heioisin by
the conviction of a guiding and protecting Providence The conveisition was not forgotten on either side and it \ 01 e fi uit fe wfrn fruit, in time We had reached on our return α command ing point from which we looked into the depths already filling with twilight and through whose blue vapours the caravan toiled slowly along like a weaned fleet in some billowy sea Sud denly a tumult was perceived below cries of confusion and terror rose and the whole caravan was seen scattering in all directions thiough the passes I or the first moment we thought that it had been attacked by the motmtam robbers We grasped our lances and galloped down the sidt of the hill to charge them when we were stopped at once by a woman s scream from the ridge whi h wt had just left It stiuck through my heart—the voice was Mínam s To my unspeakable horror I saw her dromeelary mad with fear and pouring blood rush along the edge of the precipice I saw the figure clinging to his neck The light forsook my eyes, and but for the grasp of Jubal I must
have fallen to the ground —His voice aroused me When I looked round again the shouts had died the troop had disappeared— it seemed all a dream ' But again the shouts camo doubling upon the wind and far as the eye tould pierce tin ough tht dusk I saw the white robe of Miriam flying ilong like α vapour I tlnew the reins on my horses neck·—I loused him with my voice —I rushed with the fearlessness of despair througli the hills—I overtook the troop—I out stripped them —still tht vision flew befort me At length it sank—The dromedary had plunged down the precipice a depth of hideout daikness —A torrent roared below I stiuck in the spur to follow —My horse wheeled round on the edge while I strov e to force him to the leip my kinsmen tamt up with Eleazer at their head —Bold as they weie they ill recoiled from the frightful depth Lven in that wild moment I h td time to feel that tins w ıs but the bt ginning of my inflictions and that I was to wieck the nu» of ill that belonged to mc Γη consciousness unspeakalle, I sprang Írom my
startled steed, antl before a hand could check me, I plunged m —A cry of astonishment and honor rang in my ears as I fell —The roar of waters was then aiound me —I struggled with tho torrent, gasped, and heard no moie. This desperate effort saved the life of Miriam. We were found apparently dead, clasped in eath other's arms, at some distance down the stream The plunge had broke the band by whicli she was fixed on the saddle She floated, and we were thrown togethei by the eddy. After long effoit, we were restored. But the lamenta tions of my matchless wife were resti ained be side my couch, only to burst forth w hen sht was alone —We had lost our infant. The chase of the wolves in the mountain, had dnven them across the march of the cara¬ van. One of those savages sprang upon the flank of the dromedar j The animal, in the agony of its wounds, burst away its proverbial fleetness bafiled pursuit , antl it was almost fortunate that it at length bounded over the precipice, as, in the mountain country, its pre tious buiden must have perished by the lion oi
by famine Mmam held her babe with the strong giasp of a mother, hut in the torrent that grasp was dissolved All our search was in vam. My wife wept —but I had in her rescued my chief treasure of earth, and was consoled by the same deep feehng which pronounced that I might have been punished by the loss of all.

The wisdom, which even my gient misfortune might have forced upon me, was withheld, and the being who, m the conviction of his myste¬ nous destiny, must have looked upon earth and its pursuits, as man looks upon the labours and the life of flies,—as the atoms m the sunshine— as measureless emptiness and trifling,—was given over to be disturbed by the impulses of gene¬ rations on whose dust he was to sit, and see othei generations rise round lum, thtmselves to sink alike into dust, while he still sat an image of endurance and warning imperishable But there was a season in each year when those recollections returned with overwhelm¬ ing vividness If all other knowledge of the approach of the passover could have escaped me, there were signs, fearful signs, that warned me of lhat hour of my woe A periodic dread of the sight of man, a sudden, gloomy sense ofmy utter sepaiation fiom the mteiests of the transitory beings round me, wild dreams, days of immoveable abstraction, yet filled with the breathing picture of all that I had done on the day of my guilt in Jerusalem, rose before me
w ıth such intense reality, th it I lived through the set ne The successive piogress of my crime—the swift and stinging consciousness of condemnation—the flash of fearful know ledge, that showed me futurity,—all—all were felt with tie keenness of a being fiom whom his fleshly nature had been stripped away, and the soul bared to every visitation of pain —I stood like a disembodied spirit in suflering Yet I could not be restrained from following my tribo on their annual progress to the Holy City —To see from afar the towers of the tem¬ ple, was with me like a craving for Ufe —but I never dared to set my foot within its gates On some prêtent e or other, and sometimes thiough real powerlessness, arising fiom the con¬ flict of my heart, I lingered behind, yet within the distance from which the city could be seen —There unong the precipices I wandered through the day, listening to the various up¬ roar of the mighty multitude, or wistfully catch ing some echo oí the hymns in the temple —sounds that stole from my eye many a tear—till darkness fell, the city slumbered,
and tho blast of the Roman trumpets, as thev divided the night, reminded me of the fallen glonts of my country. In one of tliose wanderings, I had followed the course of the Ked rou, which, from α hi ook under the walls of Jerusalem, swells to л nver on its descent to the Dead Sea —The blood of the sacnfices fiom the conduits of the altars curdle 1 on its suifitt, and stained the sands purple —It looketl like a w ounded \ em fi om the mighty lieart above I still strayed on, wrapt in std forebodings of the hour when its stains might be of more than sacrifice, until I found myself on the edge ot the lake Who has ver seen that blatk expanse without a shudder?— There were the mgnlphed cities Around it hfe was extinct—no ammal bounded—no bird hoveiod —The distant rushing of the River Jordan, as it foiced its cm rent thiough the heavy waters, or the sigh of the wind through the reeds, alone broke the silence of this mighty grave Of the melancholy objects of nature, none ь more depressing than a large expanse of stagnant vaters No gloom of forest, no
wildness of mountain, is so overpowering, as tins dreary, unrelic\ed flatness —the marshy bord r —the sickly \egetatmn of the shore—the leaden colour which even the sky abo\e it wears, tinged by its sepulchral atmosphere But the waters betöre me were not left to the dreams oi a saddened fancy —they weie a sepulchre — Myriads ot human beings lay bene ith thein, en¬ tombed in sulphuious beds —The wrath of Heaven had been there The day of destruction seemed to pass again befoie my eyes, as I lay gazing on those sullen depths I saw them once more a plain coveied with richness, cities glittering in the morning sun, multitudes pouring out from thtn gates to sports and festivals the laud exulting with life and luxuriance —Then a cloud gathered above — I heard the voice of tlie thunder,—it was answered by the earthquake*—Fne burst from the skies,—it was answered by a thousand founts of fire spouting from the plain —Th^ distant hills blazed, and threw volcanic showers o\er the citie*- —Round them was a tide of burning bitumen — The earthquake heaved
again—All sank into the gulf—I heard the roar of the distant waters —They rushed into the bed of fire , the doom was done the Cities of the plain were gone down to the blackness of darkness for e\er. I was idly watching the buists of suffocating vapour that shoot up at intervals fiom the rising masses of bitumen, when I was startled by a wild laugh and wilder figuie beside me I spring on my feet, and prepaied fot defence -.villi my poniard the figure waved Ins hand ш sign to sheathe tbe unnecessary weapon, and said, in a tone stiangt and melancholy, " You are m my power, but I do not come to injure you I have been contemplating jour countenance for some time —I have seen yout featuies deeply disturbed—your wnnging hands—your con¬ vulsed form —are you even as I am v The voice was stugulaity mild yet I never heard α sound that so keenly pierced my brain The speaker was of the tallest stature of man—every smew and muscle exhibiting gigantic strength, yet, with the symmetry of a Greek statue But his countenance was the true
wonder —it was of tlie finest mould of manly beauty the contour was Greek, hut the hue was Svi iun —yet the dark tinge of country gave way at times to a more than corpse like paleness I had full leisure for the view, for he stood gazing on me without a woid, and I remained fixed on my defence " At length, he said, " put up that poniard ' You could no more hurt me, than you could resist me —- look here' ' He wrenched a liuge mass of rock from the ground, and whirled it far into the lake, as if it had been a pebble I gazed with speechless astonishment "Yes," puisued the figure,—they throw me into their pnsons—■ they lash me—they stretch me on the rack— they burn my flesh " As he spoke, he flung aside bis robe, and showed his broad bieast coveied with scars " Shortsighted fools' little they know him who sufiers, or him who commands If it weie not my will to endure I could crush my tormentors as I crush an insect They ohmii me too,' said he with a laugh of scorn —He drew out the arm which had been hitherto wrapped in his robe —
It was loaded with links of iron of prodi¬ gious tlutkness He giasped one of them ш his hand, twisted it ofl with scarcely m effoit and flung it up α sightless distance m tht air "Such are b its and bolts tome' When ni} time is come to suffer, I submit to be toi tuied ' AVhen my time is past, I tear away fiieii fetteis, huist then dungeons, and walk iorth trampling their aimed men " I she tilled the dagger " Does this strength amaze you ** ' said the being " look to yondei dust, ' and he pointed to a cloud of sand that с une flying along the shore " I eould outstrip tint whirlwind,—I could plunge unhurt mto the depths of that sea,—I could ascend that mountain swifter than the eagle,—I could nde that thundei-cloud." As he tlnew himself back, gazmg upon the sky—with his grand foim buoyant with vigour, and Ins arm exalted—he looked like one to whom height 01 depth could offer no obstacle His mantle flew out along the blast hke the unfurling of a mighty wmg Theie vvas some¬ thing* in his look and voice that gave irre-

fresh wound " Here," howled he, " sat the diadem —I was Epiphanes " " You, Antiochus ' the tyrant—tho per«e cutor—the spoiler—the accursed of Israel - ' I bounded backwards ш sudden horror I saw befoie me one of those spiuts of the evil dead, who are allowed from time to time to re appear on earth in the body, whether of the dead or the living For some cause tbat none could unfold, Judea had been, within the last few years haunted by them more than for centuries Strange ntes dangerously bor¬ rowed from the idolaters were reported to for our íehef from this new terror the pulling of the mandrake at the eclipse of the moon— incantations—midnight offerings—the root Ba aras, that w as said to flash flame, and kill the ammal that drew it from the ground Our Sadducees and sceptics, wise in their own con teit, declared that possession was but a human disease, a wilder insan ty But, with the rage and misery of madness, there were tremendous distinctions that raised it beyond all the ravages of the hurt mind, or the afflicted frame —the
look, the language, tlie horror ofthe possessed, were above man They defied human restraint, they lived in wildernesses where the veiy in¬ sects died, the fiery sun of the East, the incle¬ mency of the fiercest winter, had no power to break down their strength —But they had stronger signs,—they spoke of things to wluth the wisdom of the wisest was folly—they told oí the íemotest future wi*h the forte of pro phecy—they gave gbmpses of a knowledge biought from realms of being inaccessible to living man—last and loftiest sign, they did homage to his coming, whom a cloud of darkness, the gıul'y and impenetrable daikness of the heart, hatí veiled fiom my unhappy nation—But their worship was terroi—they b lieved and trembled " Power—' «aid the possessed, and his large and unmoving eyes seemed lighting up witn fire from within—" Power you sliall have, and hate it, wealth you shall have, and hate it, life you shall have, and hate it yet you shall know the depths of the condition of man —You shall be the worm among a nation of worms—you

Israelite fighting in sight of the profaned Tem pie y The n itive frame exercised by the ha bits of our temperate and agncultur il life was one of bui pissing muscular strength and man for man thrown aked into the field we could have torn the Roman ganison into frigments for the fowls of the ur But their arms, aud tho help vvhich they received from the nature ofthe ground, weie too strong for the assault of men fighting with no shield but their cloaks and no arms but a pilgrims staff, or some weapon caught up írom a dead enemy \et to ne there came a wild impiession, tl at tl is n gl t was to m tke or unmake me an u lefi ed feeling that in the shedding of my blool m s gl t of the Temple, there might be some p dilative some washing away of my ci ime I sprang furw ard betv een the combatants and elefied the boldest of the legion aies, the battle paused for an instaut, and my name was shouted in exultation hy the voices of my tribe A shower of arrows from the battlements was poured upon me I felt myself wounded, but the feeling only roused me to bolder daring
Feai ing off my gory mantle, I lifted it on the point of my javelin, and with the ponuud m mv right hand, aloud devoted the Rom ins toruin m the name of the Temple The enemy, m their native superstition, shrank fiom a being who looketl tht mes¬ senger oi angry Heaven Tİıc inked fidine, the blood streaming from my vv ounds, the wild antl mystic sound of my words, rt minded them of tht diviners that had often чЬоок their souls in then own land I luust into the cncle of spears, waving my stand ird, uid culling on my nation to follow I smote to the nght and left The entrance that I had made in the iron bulwark was nist intly filltd by the multitutlt All discipline gave way '1 he weight of the Roman armom was ruinous tt» men grappled hand to hand by the light and sinewy agility of the Jew Wt rushed on, trampling down cuirtss antl buckle ι till we diove the enemy like sheep b-*ore us t j the hist gate of the Towei of Automa An ows, lanets stones, in showei s from the battlements, could not stop the tnumphant valour of the people
We rushed on to assault the gate. S ïbmus, the tribune ofthe legion, rallied the remnant of the fugitives, and under cover of the battle¬ ments, made a last attempt to change the for¬ tunes of tho night. Ľxhausted as I w as, bruised and blteding, my feet and hands lacerated with the burning îuins, my tongue cleaving to my mouth with deadly thirst, I rushed upon him He had been cruelly known to the Jews, a tyrant, and plunderer, iur the many years of his command. No trophy of the battle could have been so cheering to them as his head But he had the bravery of his country, and it was now augmented by rage The despair of being able to tie ir himself befoi о imperial jealousy for that night's disasters, must have made life worthless to lnm He bounded on the drawbudge at my e ıy Oui meeting was brief my poniard broke on his cuirass his falchion descended with a bfjw tint would have cloven α head piece of steel. I spnng aside, and caught it on the shaft of my javelm standard, which it cut right m two I returned the blow with the fiagment The non pierced ¡is throat he flung up his
hands, staggered hack, antl dropped dead The roar of Israel rent the heavens Startely moie alive than the trunk at my feet, I fell back among *ho thiong But what¬ ever mav be the envy of courts, no injustice is done iu the field Tho successful leader is sure of his reward from the gallant spirits that he has conducted to victory I w as hailed with shouts of congratulation—I was lifted on the shoulders of the multitude , the men of Naphtali proudly claimed me foi their own, antl when I clasped the hand of my brave friend Jubal, whom I found in the foremost rank, covered with dust and blood, he exclaimed, " Remember Barak , remember Mount T«bor " But I looked round in vam for one whom I had parted with but a few days befoie, and without whom I scarcely dared return to Mi¬ riam Her noble biother was not to be seen , had he fallen ? Jubal understood my counte nance, and mournfully pointed to the citadel, which rose above us, frowning down on our impotent ìage "Eleazar is a prisoner-" I interrogated. "Theie can be no hope for him
fiom the hypocritical clemency of those bai ha¬ mns of Italy," was the answer, "Itwaswith lum that the insurrection began He had gone up to lay his offenng on the altar —some new Roman insolence commanded that our people should ofler a sacnfite to the image of the emperor, to the polluted, blood thirsty tyrant oi Roine and mankind Eleazir shiank fiom this act of hoi ror lhe tribune, even that dog of Rome, whose tongue you have silenced— so may perish all the enemies of the Holy City 1 —commanded that our chieftain should be scourged at the altar The cords were round his arms, the spearmen were at Ins back, they mirched him thiough the streets, calling on all the Jews to look upon the punishment that was equally ie&ervcd for all Our indignation burst iorth in groans and piayers 1 hastily gathered the miles of our tribe —we snatthed up what arais we could, and weie rushing to Ins rescue when we siw lum sweeping the guaid before him He h id broken his bands by a desperate effort We fell upon tho pursuers, and put them to the swoid Blood was now drawn,

I whirled it Tbe archer dropped dead, with tho arrow still on his bow To those who had not seen the cause, the cÏfect was almost a miracle. The air pealed with acclamation, a thousand slmgs instantly swept the estovt from the battlements, the walls were left naked,—ladders were raised,—ropes were slung,—axes were brandished , the activity of our hunters and mountaineers availed itself of every crevice and projection of the walls , they climbed on each other's shoulders, they leaped from point to point, where the antelope could have scarcely found footing, they ran over nar row antl fenced w alls and curtains, where, in open daylight, and with his senses awake to the dan¬ ger, nornan could have moved Torches without number showered upon all that was combustible At length, the central magazine took fire We now fought no longer in daikne«s, the flames rolled sheet on sheet above our heads, throwing light over the whole horizon W -с were soon inno w ant of soldiers, the *nbes poured in at the sight of the conflagration , and no valour could resist their enthusiasm. Some cried out,
tuat they saw beings mightier than man de¬ scending to fight the battle of the favoured na¬ tion — some, that the day of Joshua had re turned, and that a light of more than earthly lustre was visible in the burning 1 Bu* the battle was no longer doubtful The Romans, reduced in number by the struggle in the stritts, exhaust ed by the last attack, and aware, from the de¬ struction of their magazines, that their most successful resistance must be ended by famine, called out for terms I had but one answer— " The life of Eleazar." The drawbridge fell, and he appeared ,—-the next moment he was in my arms' The garrison marched out I restrained the violence of their conquerois, irritated by the memory of years of insult. Not a hair of a Roman head was touched. They were led down to the valley of Kedron, were disarmed, and thence sent without delay untler a safeguard to their countrymen in Idumea In one night the Holy City was cleared of every foot of the idolater.
CHAPTER IX. Вит while the people were in a state ofthe wildest triumph, the joy of their leaders was tempered by many formidable reflections The powei of the enemy was still unshaken the surpnse of a single garrison, though a distin¬ guished evidence of what might be done by na¬ tive valour, was Inviai on the scale of a war fhat must be conducted against the whole power of the mistress of the civilised world The policy of Rome was known she never gave np a conquest while it could be retained hy the most lavish and persevering expenditure of her strength Her treasury would be stripped of every talent, and Italy left without a soldier,
before she would smrender the most fruitless spot, an atre oí sand, or a point of rotk, in Judea I went forth, but not among the leaders, nor among the people, I turned away equally from the council and the triumph A deeper feeling urged me to wandei round those courts where my spirit so often turned in my exile. The battle had íeached even there, and the pollution of blood was on the conseciated ground The Roman ? »ldiers had, in their ad vaute, driven the people *o take refuge m the cloisters of the temple, and the dead ijing thickly among the columns, showed how fierce even that brief and partul struggle had been With a toith in my hand I trod through those heaps oi what once was man, to have on" part mg look at the scene where I had passed so many happy and innocent hours I stood be¬ fore the porch of iny cloistei, almost listening for the sound oi the familiar voices within The long inteivai of time was compressed into an instant I awoke from the revene, with a tmile at VOL. í F
the idleness of human fancy, and struck upon the door —There was no answer, but the bolts, loosened by time, gave way, and I was again the master of my mansion — It was umn habited sinto my flight, why, I could not con ceive —But, as I passed from room to loom, I found them all as il they had been left but the hour before The embroidery, which Miriam w rought with a skill distinguished even among the daughters of the temple, was still fixed ш its frame before the silken couch, theie lay the Imp that leheved her hours of graceful toil The tissued sandals were waiting for the delicate feet —The veil, the vermilion mantle that de signated her rank, the tabret, the armlets and necklaces of precious stones, still hung upon the sofas, untouched of the spoiler There was but one evidence of time among them—but that bore its bitter moral It was the dust, that hung heavy upon the cuitains of precious needlewoik, and dimmed the glitter of the gems, and ehilltd the richness ofthe Tynan purple,—dttay, thut teacher without a tongue, the lonely emblem of what the bustle of man
kind must come to at last the dull memori 1 of the proud the beautiful tho brave' Ml was the silence ofthe tomb ' With the torch m my hand throwing its red reflection on tl e walls and rich remembrances round me I sat like the mummy of an Egyptian king in the sepul clue —in the midst of the things that I had loved yet divorced from thtm by m irresistible 1 iw foi ever ' I impatiently broke iorth into the open ur — The st irs wtre waning a gray strt tk of dawn w ıs whitening the summit of the Mount of Ohv es As T passed by Htrod s palate an I lifted my eyts in wonder at tho unusual sight of t group of Jews keeping watch where but the day belore tht Roman governor lorded it ind none but tho Roman soldier durst st ind 1 saw J ib il hurrying out and making signs to ine through the trowd fiom the esplanade above I was nist intly retognisctl ind ill made way foi my ascent up those gorgeous and almost count les« steps of porphyry that formed ono ofthe wondeis of Jerusalem We have been m alarm about you, said he
hastily but come to the council we have wasted half the night in pei plexing ourselves Some ore timid and call out for submission on any terms some are rash and would plunge us unprepared into the Roman camps There are obviously many vvho without regard for the hope of freedom or the holmess of our cause look upon the crisis only as a means of personal aggi and ïsement And lastly we are not with out our traitors who confound all opinions anu who are making work for Roman gold and iron Your voice is entitled to weight —Speak at once and speak voir mind your tribe will support it with their lives The council was held in the amphitheatre of the palace —The heads of families and pnn cipal men of the people had crowded mto it until the council instead of the privacy of а few chieftains assumed the look of a great popular assembly Thirty thousand had forced themselves mto the seats every bosom re sponding to every accent of the orator a mighty instrument vibrating through all its strings to the master s hand Accustomed as I
was, by the festivals of our nation, to the sight of great bodies of men swayed by a common impulse, I stopped in astonishment at the en¬ trance of the colossal circle. Three fourths of it were almost totally dark, giving a shadowy intimation of human beings but by the light of a few scattered torches, or the rising dawn tliat rounded the extreme height with a nng of pale and moon-like rays But in the centre of the arena a fire blazed bnght, and showed the leaders of the deliberation seated in the splendid chairs once assigned for the Roman governors and legionary tribunes Eleazar filled the temporary throne The chief man of the land of Ephraim was haranguing the assembly as I entered. " Go to war with Rome 1 ' pronounced he, "you might as welt go to war with the ocean, for her power is as wide, you might as well fight the storm, for her vengeance is as rapid, you might as well call up tlte armies of Judea against tlie pestilence, for lier sword is as sweeping, as sudden, and as sure Who but madmen would go to war without allies' and where are yours to
be looked for ' Rome is the mistress of all nations Would you make a war of fortresses -* Rome has in her possession all your walled towns Every tower from Dan to Beersheba has a Roman banner on its battlements Would you meet her in the plain ? Where are your horsemen ' The Roman cavalry would be upon vou before you could draw your swords, and would trample your boldest mto the sand Would you make the campaign m the moun¬ tains ' Where are your magazines 7 The Roman generals would disdain to waste a drop of blood upon you, they would only have to block up the passes, and leave famine to do the rest Harvest is not come, and if it were, you dare not descend to the plains to gather it You are told to rely upon the strength of the country—Have the fiery sands of the desert, or the marshes of Germany, or the snows of Scythia, or the stormy waters of Bntain, de¬ fended them ? Does Egypt, within yonr sight, give you no example 7 A 1 ind of inexhaustible fertility, crowded with seven millions nnd a half of men passionately devoted to their coun
try, opulent, brave, and sustained by the countless millions of Africa, with a country defended on both flanks by the wilder ness, in the rear inaccessible to the Roman, exposing the narrowest and most defensible front of any nation on earth yet Egypt, in spite of the Lybian valour, and the Greek ge mus, ıs garrisoned at this hour by a single Roman legion' The Roman bird, grasping the thunder in its talons, and touching with one wmg the sunnrø and with the other the sun iet, throws its shadow over the world Shall we call it to stoop upon us ' Must we spread for it the new banquet of the blood of Israel' ' How different is the power of the orator upon men sitting in the common, peaceful circum stances of public assemblage, from its tyranny over minds anxious about their own fates' All that I had ever seen of public excitement was stone and ice, to the burning interest that hung upon every word of the speaker The name of Omas was famous m Judea, but I now saw hnn for the first time His had been a life of am-
bition, compassed often by desperate means, and woe be to the mau who stood between him and power By the dagger, and by sub¬ serviency to the Roman procurators, lie had risen to the highest rank below the throne In the distractions ofa timo which broke off the Tegular succession of the sons of Aaron, Omas had even been high priest, but Eleazar, head¬ ing the popular indignation, had expelled him from the temple, after one month of troubled supremacy I could read his history in the haughty figure, ond danng, yet wily, visage, that stood in their bold relief before the flame But to the assemblage, his declamation had infinite power they listened is to the words of life and death , they had come, not to dehght their ears with the periods of the orator, but to hear what they must do to escape that inex¬ orable fury, which might within a few days or hours be let loose upon every individual head All was alternately the deepest silence, and the most tumultuous agitation At his strong ap¬ peals, they writhed their athletic forms, they gnashed their teeth, they tore their hair, some
crouched to the ground with their faces buried m thetr hands, as if shutting out the coming horrors, some stai ted upright, brandishing their rude weapons, and tossing their naked limbs in gestures of defiance , some sat bending down, and throwing back their long locks, that not n syllable might escape, others knelt, with their quivering hands clasped, and their pallid coun tenanoes turned up in agony of prayer Many had been wounded, and their foreheads and limbs hastily bound up were still stained with gore Turbans and robes rent and disco loured with dust and burning were on every side, and the whole immense multitude boi e the look of men who had but just struggled out of some great calamity, to find themsel *s on the verge of oae still more irremedi-b't The orator found that his impression was made, and he hastened to the close Γοι this he reserved the sting If it be the desire of those who seek the downíall oí Judah, that we should go to war, let it be the first wisdom oí those who seek its safety, to disappoint, to defy, and to denounce them ' The words were foi
lowed by a visible agitation among the hearers " Let an embassy be instantly sent to the pro consul, said he, " lamenting the excesses of tio night, and offering hostages for peace The silence grew breathless the orator wrapped in his robe, and bending his head like a tiger crouchmg waited for the work of the passions, then suddenly starting up, and fixing his stormy gaze full on Eleazar, thundered out, * And at the head of those hostages, be sent the incen diary who caused this nights havoc, and sent m chains ' The words were received with fierce applause by the assemblage, and crowds rushed into the arena to enforce them by the seizure of Elea zar I glanced at him, his life hung by a han, but not а feature of his noble countenance was disturbed, I sprang upon the pavement at the foot of the throne, every moment was precious, the multitude were raging with the fury of wild beasts My voice was at length heard, the name of Salathiel had b n come powerful, and the tumult partially subsided My words were few, but they came from the heart I asked
them, was it to be thought of, that men should dehver up men of their own nation, of their purest blood, the last scions of the mightiest families of Israel, into the hands of the idolater ' and for what crime ' For an act which every true Israelite would glory to have done, for rest umg the altar of the living God from pol¬ lution I bade them beware of dipping their hands m righteous blood for the gratification ofa revenge, that had for twenty years poisoned the breast of a hoary traitor to his priesthood and his country " We were threatened with the irresistible power of Rome Were we to forget that Rome was at that moment torn with internal miseries, her provinces in revolt, her senate decimated, her citizens turned into a mass of jailors and prisoners, and, darkest sign of degrad-rtion, that Nero was upon her throne ? ' "Whom," said I, "have we conquered this night' a Roman army Where have we conquered them ' in the midst of their walls and machines. By whom was the conquest

CHAPTER Χ The result of our deliberation was, that Israel should be summoned to make a last grand effort, that Jerusalem should be left with a strong garnson as the centre of the armies, and that every chieftain should set forth to stir up the energies of his people Eleazar and his kinsmen were instantly upon the road to the mountains , and all was haste and that mixture of anxiety and animation which makes all other life tasteless and colour¬ less to the warrior With what new vividness did not the commg conflict invest the varied and romantic country, through which we had already journeyed so often ! The bill, the mar-
ble ravine, the superb sweep of forest, that we once looked on but with the vague indulgence of a picturesque eye, now filled us with the vision of camps and battles Hunters of the lion, we had felt something of this interest m tracing the ground where we were to combat the kmgly savage But what were the triumphs of the thase, to the mighty chances of that struggle in which α kingdom was to be the field, and the Roman glory the victim ' Man is belligerent by nature, and the thought of war summons up sensations and even facul¬ ties within him, that m the common course of life would have been no more discoverable than the bottom of the sea, the moral earthquake must tome to strip the bosom to our gaze Even Eleazar's calm and grave wisdom felt the spirit of the time, and he reasoned on the probabili¬ ties of the struggle, with the lofty ardour of a king preparing to win a new throne Jubaľs sanguine temper was irrestrainable, he was the war horse in the sight of the banners , his bronzed cheek glowed with hope and exulta- t on, he saw in every cloud of dust a Roman
squadron , and grasped his Ianoe and wheeled his foaming charger, with the eager joy of a soldier longing to assuage his thirst for battle The weight on my melancholy mind was beyond the power of chance or time to remove , but a new strength was in the crisis The world to me was covered with clouds eternal, but it was now brightened by a wild and keen lustre, I saw my way by the lightning An irresistible conviction still told me that the last day of Israel was approaching, and that no sacnfice of valour or virtue could avert the rum In the midst of the loudest exhilaration of the fearless hearts round me, the picture of the coming ruin would grow upon my eyes I saw my generous fnends perish one by one, my household desolate, every name that I ever loved past away When I bent my eyes round the horizon luxuriating in the golden sun-shine of the east, I saw but a huge altar, covered with the fatal offerings of its slaughtered people And this was seen, not with the misty un certainty of a mind prone to dreams of evil, but with a clearness of foresight, a distinct and
defined reality, that left no room for conjecture Yet, and here was the bitterest part of my me ditation, what was all this ruin to me ? What were those men and women, and households and lands, but as the lea* es on the wind, to me - I might stnve in the last extremities of their struggle I might undergo the agonies of death with them a thousand times, and I inwardly pledged myself never to desert their cause, lovely and generous as it was, while through раш or sorrow I could cling to it, but this, however protracted, must have an end I must see the final hour of them all, and more un¬ happy, more destitute, more undone than all, I must be depnved of the consolation of making my tomb with the righteous, and laying my weary heart m the slumbers of their grave ' Yet I experienced, strangely mingled with the deenest despondency of the future, more than the keenest fervour of the impulse which was now burning around me With me it was not kmgly care, nor the animal ardency of the soldier It was the high, disturbing stimula¬ tion of something like the infusion of a new
principle of existente I felt as if I had become the vehicle of a descended spirit. A ceaseless current of thought ran through my brain. Old knowledge, that I had utterly forgotten, revived in me with spontaneous freshness. Casual im¬ pressions and long past years arose, with their stamps and marks as clear, as if a hoard of medals had been suddenly brought to light, and thrown before me I ran over in my recollec¬ tion persons and names with even painful ac curacy The feeble claims and conceptions of those for whom I once felt habitual deference, were now seen by me in their nakedness AU that was habitual was done away, I saw in¬ tuitively the vamiy and giddiness, the inconse¬ quential reasonmg, the heavy and bewildering prejudice, that made up what in other days I had called the wisdom of the wise. As I threw out in the most unpremeditated language the ideas that were glowing and struggling for escape, I found that the impres¬ sion of some extraordinary excitement in me was universal Accustomed to be heard with the attention due to my rank, I now saw the ears and eyes of my fellow-travellers turned on me
with an evident and deferential surprise. When I talked ot* the hopes of the country, of tha resources of the enemy, of the kingdoms that would be ready to make common cause with us against the galling tyranny of Nero, ofthe glory of fighting for our altars, and of the imperish¬ able honours of those whose blood earned peace for their children ; they listened as to some¬ thing more than man. " Was I the prophet, delegated at last to lead Judea to her glory V' At those discourses, bursting from my lip with unconscious fire, the old men would vow the remnant of their days to the field ; the young would sweep over the country performing the evolutions of the Roman cavalry, then return brandishing their weapons, and demanding to be let loose on the first cohort that crossed the horizon. With me every pulse was war. The interest which this new direction of our minds gave to all things, grew perpetually more intense. We spurred to the barren heath ; it had now no deformity, for upon it we saw the spot from which battle might be offered to an army ad¬ vancing through the valley below. The marsh
that spread its yellow stagnation over the plain, might be worth a province for the protection of oui camp The thicket, the broken bank of tne mountain torrent, the bluff promontory, the rock, the sand, every repellent feature of the landscape, was invested with the v due of a thmg of life and death, a portion ot the great stake in the game that was so soon to be played for restoi ation or nun Those are the dehghts of soldieiship, the ín- tlescribable and brilliant colounngs which the sense oí danger, the desire of f ime, and the hope of triumph, thiow over life and nature. Yet if war was e\er tobe forgiven for its cause, to be justified by the high remembrances and elesperate injuries of a people, or to be en couraged by the physical strength of а country, it was the final war of Israel In ai. my wan derings I have seen no kingdom, for defence, equal to Judea It hv l m the highest degree the three grand essentials, compactness of territory, density of population, and strength of frontier If I were at this hour to be sent forth to select from the earth a king dom, I should say, even extinguishing the
recollections oi my being, and the love which I bear to the very weeds of my country, for beauty, for climate, for natural wealth, and for invincible security, give me Judea The Land of Promise had been chosen by the Supreme Wisdom for the inheritance of а peo pie destined to be unconquerable while they continued pure It was surrounded on all sides bui ulíc by mountains and deserts, and that one was defended by the sea, which at the same time opened to it the mteı course with the nthest countries of the west On the north, rendered hazardous by the vast population of Asia Minor, it was protected by the double range of the Libanus and Antilibanus, a region of forests and defiles, at all seasons nearly impassable to the ancient chariots and cavalry, and, during winter, barred up with torrents and snows The whole frontier to the east and south was a wall of mountain rising from a desert , α durable barrier over which no enemy exhausted by the privations of an Asiatic march, could force their way against a brave army waiting fre&h within its own confines But even if the Syrian wastes of sand, and the fiery soil of Arabia, left the in>-
vaders strength to master the mountain de¬ tentes, the whole interior was full of the finest positions for defence that ever caught the sol¬ dier's eye All the mountains sent branches through the champaign. As we spurred up the sides ot Carmel, we saw an honzon covered with hills like clouds Every city was built on an emi¬ nence, and capable of bemg instantly converted into a fortress. But while an army kept the field, the larger operations of stiategy would have found matchless support in the course oí tht Jordan, the setond defence of Judea, ahne passing through the whole central country from north to south, with the lake of Tiberias and the lake Asphaltites at either extreme, at once de¬ fending and supplying the movements ш fiont, flank, and rear The territory thus defensible had an additional aud supenor strength in the character aud habits of its population In a space of two hundred miles long by a hundred broad, its inhabitants once amounted to nearly six millions, tillers of the ground, bold tribes, invigorated by their
life of industry, and connected -л -ith each other by the most intimate nnd frequent intercourse under the divine command By the law of Moses,—may lie rest in glory '—every man from twenty to sixty was hable to be called on for the general defence , and the customary arma ment of the tribes was appointed at six hundred thousand men ' The munitions of war were in abundance AU the varieties of tioops known in the ancient armies wert to be found in Judea in the highest discipline, from the spearsman to the archer and the slinger, from the heavy armed soldier oí the fortress to the ranger of the desert and the mountain Cav ihy were prohibited , for the purpose of the Jewish armament was defence The spirit of the Jewish code was peace By the prohibition of cavalry, no conquests could be made ou the bordering kingdoms of interminable plains The command that the males of the tribes should go up thnce in the year to the great festivals of Jerusalem, was equally opposed to encroachments on the neighbouring states It was not till Israel abandoned the purity of the
original Covenant with Heaven that the evils of ambition or tyi tnny weie felt within her borders Her whole polity was undei а divine sane ton and her whole pieserv ition was dıştın ¿nished bv the perpetual agency of miracle for the obvious purpose of compelling the people to know the God of their fathers But the physical stiength of such a people m such α territory was ι îcalculable Severity of chmate wíl' not ultimately repel an invader for that severity scatters and exh tusts the po pulation Difficulties of country have been peipetnitly overpassed by a daring invader m the ittack ofa feeble or negligent people To wlnt nation were their snows their marshes or their sands α barrier against tlie great armies of the ancient or the modern world' The Alps and the Pyrenees have been passed as often as they have been attempted But no empire can conquer a nation of six mil hoi ι of m η determined to resist no army tint could bt thiown across the frontier would hnd the means ot penetrating through a com pact population of which every man was α лоь ι G
loldier, and every man was fighting for his own The Jew was, by his law, a free proprie tot of the soil He was no serf, no broken vassal He inherited his portion of ihe land by an »nevocabie title Debt, misfoi tune, or time, could not extinguish his right Capable of bemg alienated from him ior a few years the land returned at the Jubilee He was theo once more a possessor, the master of com petence, and restored to his rank amongst his fellow men. This bond, the most bene volent and the strongest thit ever bound man to a country, was the bond of the Covenant If Israel had held the institutions of her Lawgiver inviolate, she would have seen the Assyrian, the Egyptian, and the Roman, with all their multitudes, only food for the vulture But we weie a rebellious people, we sullied the purity of the Mosaic ordinances, we ab m doned the sublime ceremonial of the divine worship for the piofligate rites of paganism, we rejected the Lord of the Theocracy for the pomps of an earthly king. The mighty
protection that had been to us as eagles wings and as а wall of fire wis withdrawn Our first punishment was by our own hind the union of Isriel wis α band of fl ix in tht flame The tubes revolted Then was the tune for the hostile idolater to do his work We were overwhelniea by enemies in alliance with our own blood Tbe banners oí the sons of Jacob were seeu waving beside the binners of the worshippers of Ash taro th and Apis An opening was made into the bosom of the I md for ill invasion the barriers of the mountain aud the desert were in vain the proverbial bravery of the Jew only rendered his cham moie seveie and the polity that of old united the highest wisdom with the puiest truth ind the most benevolent mercy was at once the scoff and problem of the pagan world But opulence salubrity and vaiiousness of production belonged to the <nte of the land of Israel It lay centi al between the richest re gions of tlie world It was the natural road of the traffic of India with tho west that traflie which raised Tyre and Sidon from rocks and
shallows on a fragment of the shore of Judea into magnificent cit es , and which was yet to raise into political power and unnvalled wealth, the rocks and shallows ofthe remotest shore of the Mediterranean Our mountain ranges tempered the hot winds from the wilderness The sea cooled the sum¬ mer heats with the Ил ing breeze, and tempered the chill of winter Our fields teemed with perpetual fiuits and flWeis The extent or the hnd though narrow, con trasted with th it of tho sunounding kingdoms, was yet not to be measured by the lineal bound¬ aries, a country inteisected every where with chuns of hills capable of cultivation to the summit ¡alike multiplies its surface, and vanes its chmate We had at the foot of the hill the products of the toi nd zone, on its side those oi the temperate , on its summit the robust vege tation of the north The ascending circles of the orange grove, the vineyaid, and the forest, covered it with perpetual beauty This scene of matchless productiveness is iair and fertile no more Гог ages before my
eyes opened on the land of my fathers, the na tional misfortunes had impaired its original loveliness Tlie schism of the tribes, tbe ra vages of successive invaders, and still more the continued presence of the idolater and the alien in the heart of the land, turned laige por tions of it mto desert The final lall almost destroyed the traces of its fiuitfulness What can be demanded from thj soil 'ordsd over by the tyranny of the Moslem, strippen of its po pulation, and given up to the mendicant, the monk, and the robber' But more than human evil smote my un¬ happy countiy The curse pronounced by our great prophet three thousand vears ago, has been dteply fulfilled —" The stianger that shall come fiom a far land shall say, when he beholdeth the plagues of the land, and the sick¬ nesses that the Lord hath laid upon it, the land bnmstone and salt and burning, even all nations shall soy — ' Wherefore hath the Lord done this unto this land' What meaneth the heat of this great anger' Then men shall say—' Because they have forsaken the cove¬ nant of the Lord God of their fathers '' "

the scriptural lights perpetually beaming from Judea, of the living palpable happiness of obedience to the Supreme, of the perpetual security of the land in the divine protection, of the internal peace health, plenteousness, and freedom ' Man is weak and passionate, but no blindness could have hid from his contempla tions this proof of the human valne of virtue We must add to this the direct influence of a governing people, placed in its raak foi the express purpose of а guide to nations Combining the sacred impulses, knowleilge, and devotedness, of a priesthood, with the actual power and dignity of kings, by its own con stitutrøn as safe from all encroachment, as pro hibited from all aggression, informed by the immediate wisdom, and sustained m its gene rous and hallowed enterprise by the unco vered arm of Omnipotence, Judea might have changed the earth into a paradise, and raised universal man to the highest happiness, know ledge, and dignity of his human nature
CHAPTER XI We reached the hills of Naphtali at the close of one of the most delicious days of sum¬ mer. All nature was clothed with its robe of genial beauty, Uie olives on the higher grounds had put forth iheir first green, and with every slight gust that swept across them, heaved like sheets of emerald, the birds sang m a thousand notes from every bush, the sheep and camels lay in the meadows visibly enjoying the cool air, the shepherds sat gathered together on the side of some gentle eminence, talking, or listening to the songs ot the maidens that came in long lines to the fountains below The heavens gave prospect of a glonous day, in the
colours shown only to the Oriental eye, hues so brilliant, that many a traveller stops on the verge of the valleys, airested, m his haste home¬ ward, by the glow and pomp above All was the loveliness and joy of pastoral life, in the only country wheie I ever found it realised. The mind is to be medicmed by natural love liness, and mine was cheeied To return to our home is at all times а delight, but the new con¬ juncture, the high hopes of the future, and the consciousness that a career of the most distin¬ guished honours might be opening before my steps, made this return moie vivid than all the past, and when we reached the foot of the loDg ascent from which my dwelling was visi¬ ble, I felt an impatience beyond restiamt, and spuired up the hill alone How fine the ear becomes, when it is quickened b, the heart! As the broken mountain road, now made more difficult by the darkness of the wild pmes and cedars that crowned the summit, compelled me to slatken my pace, I thought that I could dis¬ tinguish the household voices, the barking of my hounds, and the laugh of the retainers and
peasantry, tbat during the summer crowded my doors. I pictured the dearer group, that had so often welcomed me The early and cruel loss of my son had not been repaired I was not destined to be the father of a race , but, two daughters were given to me, and, m the absence of all ambition, they were more than a recompense Salome, the elder, was now approaching to womanhood, she had the dark eyes and animated beauty of her mother, the foot of the antelope was not lighter, and her wreathed smile, her intellectual sportiveness, her laugh of innocence, and buoj ancy of soul forbade sorrow in her sight Oh, what I afterwards saw that face of living joy ' What floods of sorrow bathed those cheeks, that shamed the Persian rose ' The younger was scarcely more than α child , her mind and her form were yet equally m the bud but she had an eye of the deepest azure, a living star, and even in her playfulness theie was an elevation, a lofty and fervent spirit, that made me often forget her years She was mistress of music almost by nature, and the cadences
and rich modulations that poured from her harp under fingers slight and feeble, as if the stalks of flowers had been flung across the stringa, were like secrets of harmony treasured for her touch alone Our prophets, the true masters of the sublime, were her rapturous study Then truths might be veiled, but their genius blazed broad upon her sensitive soul I imaged my children hastening through the portal, twined hand in hand with their noble mother, still ш the prime of matron beauty nnd still grown dearer to my heart, to give me welcome The light thickened, and the mtn caty of the forest impeded me At length, wearied by the delay, I sprang from my horse, left him to make his way as he could and urged my path through а thicket which crept round the skuts of the forest, and which alone ob¬ structed the view of the spot that contained all that earth held precious to me As I struggled onward, hstenmg with sharpened anxiety for every sound of home, I caught a sound hke that of a wild beast rustling close at my side The thicket was utterly dark My eyes were useless.
I drew my scimitar, and plunged it straight be¬ fore me The blow was instantly followed hy a shriek Fuend or enemy, silence was now im¬ possible, and I demanded who was nigh I was answered but by groans, my next step was on a body Shocked and startled, I yet lifted it m my arms, and bore the dying man to an open space where the moonlight glimmered To my unspeakable horror, he was one of my most favoured attendants, whom I had left in the principal charge of my household I had slain him I tore up my mantle to stanch his deadly wound, but he fiercely repelled my hand In an undefined dread of some evil to my family I commanded him to speak, if but one woid, and tell me that all was safe He buried his face in the ground In the whirlwind of my thoughts I flung him from me, that I might go forward, and know the good or evil, but he clung rotind my feet, and exerted his last breath to implore me not to leave him to die alone " You have killed me, said he, in broken accents " but it was not your hand, but the hand of the Avenger. I was corrupted by gold You have
terrible enemies among the leaders of Jerusa¬ lem a despeiate deed has been done " My suspense amounted to agony I made another effoit to cast off the trammels of the assassin, but he still imploied " Evil things were whis¬ pered against you I was told that you had been convicted of a hoinble crune' The sound ¿hot thiough my senses he must have felt the trembling of my frame, for he, for the first time, looked upon my face " My eyes are gone," groaned he, and fell back I dared not meet the glance even of his clouding eyes " They said that yoa were condemned to an un¬ speakable punishment, and that the man who swept the woild of you and yours, did God service. In my houi of sin the tempter met me, and this day from sunrise have I lurked on your road, to strike my benefactor and my lord In the dark I lost my way m the thicket, but v en¬ geance found me."—" My family, my wife, my children, are they safe 7 ' I exclaimed He quivered, Telaxed bis hold, and uttering, " For¬ give," two or three times, with nervous agony, expired.
A single bound from this spot of death placed me on a point of rock, from which I had often gazed on my little world in the valley The moon was now bright, and the view unob¬ structed I looked down —Were my eyes dim * There was no habitation beneath me the grove, the garden, were there, sleeping in the moon light, but all that had the semblance of life was gone ' I rushed down, and found myself among ruins and ashes still hot. I called aloud— ш terror and distraction I yelled to the night, but no voice answered me My foot struck upon something m the grass, it was a sword,black with recent blood There had been burning, plun¬ der, slaughter here, in this treasure house of my heart, desolation had been busy m the centre of what was to me life, more than life I rav ed , I flew thiough the fields, I rushed back to con vmce myself that I was not labouring under some fnghtful dream What I endured that night, I never endured again, that conflict of fear astonishment, love, and misery, could be con tained but once even in my bosom in all others it must have been death In the mo
ment of reviving hope, I had been smitten While my spirit was ascending on the wings of justified ambition and sacred love of country, I had been da ' td down to earth, a desolate and desperate man What I did thenceforth, or how I passed thiough that night, I know not, but I was found m the morning with my robe fantastically thrown over me like a rojal mantle, and a frag¬ ment of half burnt wood for a sceptre in my hand, performing the part of a monarch, giving oiders for the rebuilding of my palace, and marshalling the movements of an army of shrubs and weeds I was led away with the lofty re¬ luctance of a captive sovereign to the household of Lleazar The wrath and gnef of my kinsmen were with¬ out bounds Every defile of the mountains was searched—every straggtei seized messengers were despatt lied across the frontier with offers of ransom to the chiefs of the desert, in case my family should have escaped the sword Threats of severe retaliation were used by the Ro mau governor of the province, all was in vam
The only glimpse of intelligence was from α shepheid who two nights before had seen a troop which h-p supposed to be Arabs nde swiftly by tho gates of Kuuathim our nearest city but this intelligence only added to the misfoitune The habits of those robbers were proverbially savage they attacked by the torch and the swoid they slaughtered the men with out meicy the females they generally sold into a returnless captivity To leave no trace of their route they slaughtered the captives whom they could not carry through their hurried marches To leave no trace of what they had done they burned the place of massacre —But this ruin was fiom other and more malignant hands

The sun decayed Twihght fell, shade on shade, on tower and column , until tot û darkness smouel- ed the scene of glory Yet, as if a new faculty of sight were given to me, the thickest dark¬ ness did not blunt the eye I still saw all things—ihe minutest figures of the architec¬ ture, the finest carving of the airy castle-š, whose height was, even m the sun shine, almost too remote for vision Suddenly, there echoed the murmur of many voices, the trooping of many feet, the colossal gates opened, and a
procession of forms innumerable entered, they were of every period of life, of every pursuit, of every rank, of every country AU the vari¬ ous emblems of station, all tho weapons and implements of mankind, all costumes, rich, and strange, civilised and savage, all the attributes and adjuncts of the occupations of society moved in that mighty train. The monarch, sceptred and crowned, passed on his throne, the soldier reining his chargei, the philosopher gazing on bis volume, the pneat beanng the instruments of s icriíice. It was the triumph of a powei i uling all mankind , but ruling them when the woild has passsed away— Death ' While I ga¿ed in breathless awe, I found myself involved m the procession. Resistance was vain I was conscious that I might as well have stiuggled against tlie tides of the ocean, or thought to stop the revolution of tho globe We advanced through the place of darkness by millions of millions, yet without crowding the mijestic avenue, or reaching its close I rapidly lecognised a multitude of faces, which I had known fıoın the models and

CHAPTER ХШ. Ат length the past returned to my mind. Dim recollections, shadows that alternately advanced and eluded me, sketches of forms and events, like pictures unfinished by the pencil, lay before me colourless and undefined. But day by day tho outlines grew more com¬ plete, the figures assumed a body they hved— they moved—they uttered voices, and while to other eyes I was a solitary and hopeless fugi¬ tive from human converse, to my own I was surrounded with a circle of all that I loved yet, with a continued sense of privation, a mysterious feeling of something imperfect in the indulgence, that dashed my cup with bit¬ terness.
With the increase of iny strength, I be- came a wanderer to great distances among the mountains No persuasion of my kinsmen could restrain me from those excursions The mildness of a climate in which the population sleep m the open air, and the abundance of fruits, met the two chief difficulties of travel Img I felt an irresistible impul e to pene trate the mountain ranges, that rose m chains of purple and azuie before me With the artifice of the diseased mind, I made my few preparations in secret, and with but scrip and staff, marched forth to tread hill and valley, city and desert, to the last limit of the globe Thiough what diversities of scene, or impedi¬ ments of road I long passed, no memory rests upon me The same instinct which guides the bird, led me to the fruit tree and the stream, taught me where to shelter for the night, and gave me sagacity for the avoidance of the habitual dangers of a route seldom tried but by the wolf and the robbei But my frame, gradually invigorated by exercise, bore me through, and I scaled the chain of Libanus with an unwearied foot
There I reached the skirts of a region wheie the snow scarcely melts even m the burning summer of Syna The falling of tho leaf and the furious blasts that burst through the ravines told me that I hud spent months in my pilgrimage and that I must bravt winter on its throne Still I persevered I felt a new excitement in the new difficulty of the season I longed to try my power of endurance against the storm to wrest'e with the whirl wind to biffle tl e torrent The very sight of the snow as it began to sheet the sides of the lower hills gave me a vague idea of α brighter realm of existence it united the pinnat les with the clouds the noble promontories and forest covered eminences no longer rose m stein con trast with the sky they were dipt in celestial blue thev woi e the silvery and sparkling lustre of the morning skies they blushed in the eiful gence of the sunset with as rich ι erim on as the cloud that crowned them But all was not fantastic vision From the summit of one of those lulls I saw what was then worth a pi grimage thiough half
the world to see, the cedar grove of Leba¬ non After a day of unusual fatigue and perplexity, I had found my path blocked up by a perpendicular pile of rock. To all but myself, the difficulty might have been im¬ practicable, but my habits had given me the spnng and muscle of a panther, I bounded against the marble, and after long effort, by the help of the weeds, and scattered roots of the wild vmes, climbed my perilous way to the summit An endless range of Syria lay be¬ neath , the sea and the wilderness gleamed on my left and right, and a rich succession of dells, crowded with the date, the olive, and the grape, in their autumnal dyes, spread out befoie me, as far as the eye could reach in a land whose air is pure as crystal A sound of trumpets and wild harmonies arose, and I discovered, at an almost viewless depth below, a concourse of people moving thiough the hollows of the mountains The tendency of man to man is irresistible, and that unexpected sight, where but the wild beast and the eagle were to have been my
companions, gave me the first sensation of pleasure that I had long experienced Bound¬ ing from rock to rock with a hazardous rapidity wh'ch arrested the crowd m astonishment and alarm, I joined them just in time to see the shafts and slings laid tlown, which they had prepared for my coining, ш the uncertainty whether I were a wolf or a mountain robber They formed one of the many caravans that anpualiy gathered from the shores of the Medi¬ terranean to worship at Lebanon The homage to sacred groves had been transmitted from the earliest antiquity, and was umveisal in the realms of paganism To the Jew, worship on the hill antl under the tree was prohibited, but the foiest that Solomon had chosen, the trees of which the fiist Temple was built, the foliage which shaded the first planters of the earth, must to the descendant ef Abraham be full of reverent interest The ground was scriptural, the fiery string of the prophet Ezekiel had been struck to its praise, the noblest raptures of our poets celebrated tbe glory of Lebanon, the names of the surrounding landscape re-
called lofty and lovely memories, the vale ot Eden led to the mountain of the Cedars ' lo my fellow travellers traditions tinged by the fervid colouring of the orient il fancy height ened the native power of the spot On tlte sum mits of the trees were s ud to descend at ap pointed tunes those ministering spirits whose purpose is to rectify tiie crimes of m tn There stoo] ed on the wmg the be irers of the swoid against the heads of evil monarchs there biood ed the angel of the tempest there the invisible ruler of the pestilence blew with his breath and nations sickened there in night and in the inter val of storms was hear 1 the trumpet that before kings dreamed of qiianel announced the col hsion of guilty empires ioi their mutual rmn The violation of the grove was supposed to be visited with the most ine\oiabIe calamity the hand that cut down a tree for any ordinai y use witlieied from the body alt misfortunes tell upon the man his wealth dissolved away his cattle perished his children died in their prime if life was suffered to linger ι himself it was only to perpetuate the warning of the punish nent But
there were gentler distinctions mingled with those stern attnbutes Above the lull was the pagan entiance to the skies Once in the year the celestial gate rolled back on its golden hinges with sounds surpassing mortal music, tlie heavens dropped balm, the prayer offered on that night reached «it once the supreme throne, the tear was treasured m the volume of hght, and the worshipper who died before the envious coming of the morn, ascended to a felicity, earned by others only through the tardy trial of the grave The river which ran lound the mountain's foot, bore its share ot virtue, its water, unpolluted by the decay of autumn, or the turbidness of winter, showed the preservative power of a superior bemg it was entitled the Holy Stream, and sealed vessels of it were sent even to India and Italy, presents of health and sanctity to kings, and woi thy of kings As we entered the last defile, the minstrels and singers of the caravan commenced a pæan Altars fumed Irom various points ofthe ciiasm above, and the Syuan priests were seen in their
robes performing the empty rites of idolatry. I turned away from this perversion of human reason, and pressed forward through the linger¬ ing multitude, until the forest rose m its ma¬ jesty before me. My step was checked in solemn admuation. I saw the eailiest produce of (he earth—the patriarchs of the vegetable world The first generation of the reviving globe had sat be¬ neath these green and lovel} arches, the final generation was to sit beneath them No roof so noble ever rose above the heads of mon¬ archs, though it were covered with gold and diamonds The forest had been greatly impaired m its extent and beamj b} tho sacrilegious hand of war. The perpetual conflicts of the Syrian ond Egyptian dynasties laid the axe to it with remorseless violation ï once spread over the whole lange of the moi iiiains, its dimi¬ nished strength now, like the relics of a mighty army, made its stand an ong the central for¬ tresses of its native region, and there majes¬ tically bade dedalici to the further assault of
steel and fiie The forms of the trees seemed made for duration, the trunks were of prodi¬ gious thickness, smooth and round as pillars of marble, some using to а great height, and throwing out α vast lei el ro f of foliage, some dividing into a cluster of trunks, and with thpir various heights of branch and leaf, making a succession of veidurous caves, some propaga ting themselves by circles of j oung cedars, risen whrre the fruit had dropped upon the ground the whole bore the aspect of a colossal temple of nature—the shafted tohinan, the deep arch, the solid buttresses branch ig off mto the richest capri es of oriental architecture, the solemn îoof high ibove, pale, yet painted by the strong sunlight through the leaves with transparent and tessei \ted dyes nth as the colours of the Indian mine In the momentary feehng of awe and wonder, I could compiehend why pagamsm loved to worship under the shade of forests, and why the poets of pigamsm filled that shade with tbe attributes nnd presence of deines The airy whisperings, the loneliness, the neh twi
light, were the very food of mjstery Even the forms that towered befoie the eye, those ancient trees, the survivors of the genenl law of mortality, gigantic, hoary, covered with their weedy robes, bowing their aged heads m the blast, and uttering strange sounds and groanmgs in the struggle, gave to tbe high wrought su¬ perstition of the soul the images of things un¬ earthly , the oracle and the God f Or was this impression but the obscure revival of one of tliose lovely truths that shone upon the days of Paradise, when man drew knowledge from its fount in Nature, and all but his own passions was disclosed to the first born of creation The caravan encamped in the bottom of the valley, and the grove was soon crowded with worshippers, m whose homage I could take no share Fires were lighted on the large stones, which had for ages served the purpose of altars, and the names of the Syrian idols were shouted and sung m the fierce exultation of a worship but slightly purified írom its original barbarısın As the night fell, I withdrew to the entrance of the defile, and
ga\e a last glance at Lebanon In the giove filled with fires, and echoing with wild music and dances of not, I saw the emblem of my fallen country the holiness, old as the oldest memory of nations, profaned, yet the existente preseived, aud still to be preserved Israel once throned upon its mountains, now di minished of its beauty, to be yet more di nnmshed, but to live, when all else perished, to be restored, and to cover its native hills agam iuth glory I buned my face in my robe, and thi owing myself down by the skirt of one of the tents, gave way to meditations sweet and bitter. They passed into my sleep, and I was once more in the bosom of my family I heard my name pronounced , I listened, the name of my wife followed. I looked to the sky, to the forest, to convince me that this w ıs no mockery of the diseased mind I was fully awake I lifted up the corner of the tent Savage figures were sitting over their cups, inflamed into quarrel, and in the midst of high words and execrations I heard then story They were robbers from Mount Ama-
nus , come, equally, to purify their hantts by offering sacrifice at Lebanon, and to recom¬ pense themselves for their lost time by robbing on the way home. The quarrel had arisen from the proposal o f one of them to extend their expedition into Judea, a proposal which he sustained by mentioning the success of his pre¬ vious enterprises My name was again sent from mouth to mouth, and I found that it was inscribed on some jewel which lormed a part of his plunder The thought struck me that this might afford a clue I burst into the tent, and demanded my wife and children The ruffians started as if they were m the presence of a spectre " Where, ' I repeated, "are my family' I am Salathiel 1 " "Safe enough," said the foremost " Are they alive ? " I cried, " lead me where they are, and jou shall have what ransom you desire " The îuffian laughed " Why, as for ransom, all the money has been made by them, that is likely to bt made for some time, unless the Greek that bought them repents of his bargam ' The speech was recen ed with loud laughter. I grew furious.
" Villains, you have murdered them Tell me the whole, show me where they Ue, or t will dehver you up to the chief of the caravan as robbers and murderers They were appalled, with а single stride I was at the throat of the leading ruffian and seized the jewel it was my brida' piesent to Miriam! My hand trem¬ bled my eyes grew dim at the glance In the next moment I found myself pmioned, a gag forced into my mouth, а cloak flung over me, and was left to listen to the discussion, whether I was to be stabbed on the spot, left to die of famine, oi have my tongue cut out, and, thus unfitted for telling secrets, he turned to gain, and sold for a slave But my preservation was not distant The quarrel of the banditti increased with their wine, blows were given, the solitary lamp was thiown down in the conflict, it caught some combustible matter, the tent was in a blaze By a violent exertion I loosened the cords from my arms, and in the confusion fled unseen The fire spread, and my last glance
at the valley showed the encampment turned mto а sea of fire Alone in pain and exhausted with deadly fatigue I yet had but one thought that of seeki щ my family thiough the world I wan dered on through the vast range of wild country that guards Syria on the side of the desert I was parched by the burning noon I was fiozen by the keen winds of night I hungered and thirsted yet the determination was strong is death and I persevered I at length reached the foot of Mount Amanus tiaversed the chain saw from it the interminable plains of Asii Minor the desert of Aleppo the shores of Tripoli and was then left only to choose in which I should again commence my hopeless pilgrimage There is something in great distress of mind that throws a strange protection round the sufferer I passed the Romun guards un questioned—the robber left me without in quiring whethei I was woith his dagger — Tí t wolves driven down by famine and devouring all else that had life neglected the banquet
that I might have supplied —Yet I shrank from none of the e ils but n arched on through garnson cave and forest But one evening the sky w s loaded with a tempest that drove even me to seek for shelter I found it in one of the promontories that so often stare the man ne·· s eye on the iron bound shore of Cilici ι Fatigue soon threw me into α heavy slumber But the weight of the tempest towards mid night roused me and from the mouth of the tavelgi?ed on the lightnings that red with resistless rage disclosed at every explosion immense tracts of sea rolling in foaming ridges before the gale In the intervals of the guats I heard to my surpr 0 e the murmur of many voices apparently in prayer close beside me But all my interest was suddenly fixed on the sea by the sight of a large war galley running before the wind She had neither sail nor oar Her masts were gone by the board and but for the crowd of people on her deck whose distracted attitudes I could clearly see by the fl ishes she looked a floating tomb
To summon whatever assistance might be at hand, I cried aloud to warn the galley of the hazards of the shore, I gathered the brushwood at the mouth of the cavern, and set it on fire A shout fiom tho crew told me that my signal was understood, and I rushed down the bed of a stream that fretted its way through the precipice Befoie I reached the shore, I saw various fires blazing above, and many figures huirying down on α purpose like my own We had not arrived too soon The galley after desperate efforts to keep the sea, had run for an inlet of the rocks, aud was embayed, surge on suigt, each higher than the one before, rolled over the ill fated vessel and each swept some portion of bei ci e w mto the deep We rushed into the waves, and had succeeded in drawing m ıny to shore, when a broader burst tho concentrated force of the tempest, thundered on the gil ley, she was broken mto splinters Stunned and half suflocated with the surge I grasped, m the mere instinct ot self preser vation, at ^hate\ei was nearest, and through mfinite hazard leached the shore with a body
m my arms Need I tell the keen succession of terror, anxiety, hope, and joy, when I found that this being whom I saw lifeless, and at length breathing, mo\ ing pronouncing my name, falling on my neck, was Miriam ' My daughters, too, wtre rescued The neai ness of the shore saved the crew, who, until they saw the beacon on the rocks, had given them selves up to despair The chance of help led them to steer close in land, ind I was congra tuhttd as the general preserver Miriams story was brief Our dwelling had been sur rounded by α troop of ι obbers The household were surprised in their sleep Resistance was vain, the rest was plunder and ciptivity The robbers, fearful of pursuit, took the road to the mountains at full speed My wife and diugh¬ ters were treated with unusual care, lest their beauty should be injured, and thus their value m the sl wefmarket of Tripoli impaired As the ıobber told me, they had been purchased by a Greek merchant of Cyprus, ind by him con leyed to his island, to be sold to some more VOL 1. I
opulent master. There they were redeemed by an act of equal generosity and valour, and were returning to Judea when the storm over¬ took them.
CHAPTER XIV. When the first tumult of our spirits was past, I had leisure to see what changes the in¬ terval had made in faces so loved Miriam's betrayed the hours of distress and раш that she must have passed, but her noble style of beauty, the emanation of a noble mmd, was as conspi cuous as ever I even thought, when her large eye tell on me from time to tune, that it shone with a loftier intelligence, as if mis foi tune had raised its vision above the things of our trivial world. My daughters' forms had matured, but Salome, the elder, wore л portion of her mother's look, her laughmg glance still beamed, yet she was often lost ш
meditation and the rapid changes of her cheek from the deepest crimson to the paleness of snow alarmed me with menaces of early dec iy Esther too had undergone her révolu imn But it was of the brightest texture The s-oas the skies the mountains of Greece filled her glowing spirit with mages of new life She had listened with boundless dplight to the traditions of that most brilli mt of all peo[ Ie the works of the pencil and the tinsel Ι α I met her eye m a profuseness and perfection that she had never contemplated befoie her harp echoed to names of romantic valour and proud patriotism and as I gazed on her in those hours when in the feeling that she was unobserved she gave way to the rich impulses of her soul I thought alternately of the pro phetess and of the muse The shipwreck converted the solitary shore nto a httle village the sailors collected the fragments of the vessel and formed them into huts the caves that ran along the level of the sands supplied habitations of themselves and by the assistance of those dwellers on tl e pre
cipice who had so unexpectedly staïted to hght, the first difficulties of a wild coast were sufii ciently combated The bustling activity of the Greek mariners, and the adroitness with which they availed themselves of all contrivances for passing tho heavy hour, their sleights of hand, sports, and dances, their recitations of popular poems and their boat songs, kept the spot in continual animation This was roy first oppov tunity of contact with the actual people, and 1 acknowledged their right to have been distin¬ guished among the most showy disturbers of mankind. The evil of the character too was displayed without much trouble of disguise They habitually gamed, till they had no better stake than the fragments of their own clothing, but they would game for a shell, fur a stone that they picked up on the sands, for any thing They quarrelled with as perfect facility as they gamed the knife was out quick as lightning , but to do them justice, their wrath was as brief The combatants embraced at a wortl, danced, kissed, and wept, then drank, gamed, quarrelled, and were sworn brothers
again But this was Greece ш its lowest rank Constantius, the commander of tho galley, was a specimen of the land whtcb produced a Plato and a Pericles When 1 first saw him led by Miriam, as the generous champion who had restored her and her chüdren to happiness, I saw virtue and manliness of the highest ordec ш his features He was stdl ш his prune, but a scar across his forehead, and the seventies of martial life, gave early seriousness to his countenance But his conversation had the full spirit of the spnng time of life It was in¬ comparably rich, various, and animated, alto¬ gether free from professional pedantry, it had the interest that belongs to professional feel ings Military adventure, striking traits of war hke intelligence, the composition of the fleets and armies of the various states that fought under the wmg of the Roman eagle, with then old valour invigorated by their new discipline, were topics on which his fire was exhaustless.. On those I listened to him with the itrong sympathy of one to whom war must henceforth he the grand pursuit, war for national freedom,
war purified of its evil hy the most illustrious cause that ever summoned the sword. But Gonstantms had conversation for us ill His intercourse with the ruling lande of the earth, gave him a copious store of recollée tions, picturesque, superb, and strange Esther combated and r estioned the traveller Salome listened to the warnor—listened, and loved He had higher topics, of which I was yet ta hear In the inhabitants of the precipice he found a little colony of his countrymen, fugi¬ tive Christians, driven out by persecution to make their home ω the wilderness of nature The long range of caverns which perforated the rock, gave them a roof The fertility of the soil and the occasional visit of a bark sent by their concealed friends, supplied the necessaries and some of the conveniences of life, and there they awaited the close ofthat ferocious tj ranny which at length roused the world against Nero, or awaited the close of til suffenng in tho grave A succession of stt s rendered travelling im¬ possible, and detained us among those hermits for some days I found them intelligent, and
in general men of the higher ranks of know ledge mil conelition Some were of celebrated families and htd l°ft behind them opulence and authority A few were peasants But misfortune and still more principle extm guished ill that wai abrupt in the meqiiility of ranks without leaving license in its stead Jew as I was and steadily bound to the cus toms of my country I yet did honour to the patience the humility and the elevotedness of those exiled men I even once attended their worship on the first day of the week assured tint the abomination of idols was not to he found there and that I should hear nothmg insulting to the name of Isriel The ceremonial was simple Those who had witnessed the heaven commanded magnificence of the Temple might smile at the bareness of tho walls of rock figured only with the wild herbage or those who had borne to see tht extiavagant and complicated rites of paganism might scorn the few and obvious forms of the homage But there was the spirit of strom· prayer—the breathing of the heart—the un
answerable sincerity Every violence of the mere animal frame was unknown I siw no pag in convulsion—no fitrctness of outcry and gesture—not even tht vehement solemnity oí the Jew AH wis calm teirs stolo down but thty stole in silence knees were bowed, but theie was no prostration prayers fervent and lofty weie poured forth but it was in accents utteied less from the lip tlnn from the soul appeals of hallowed confidence to α Being that was sure to hear, the voice of children to a Father and a God who, wherev er two or three were gathered ogether was in the midst of them At length the storms cleared away ind the sky wore the native azuie of the ehm ite A messenger despatched to Cyprus, returned with a vessel for the embarkation of the Greeks С imels and mules were piocuied from the neighbouring countiy for oui journey and the morning was fixed on which we were to sepa i ite Yet with so much reason for joy few resolutions eould have been received with less favoui Constantius almost shunned sotiety 01 shared in it with ι silence and depiession
that mtylp, his philosophy more than question able Miriam was engaged m long confer¬ ences with Salome, from which they both came sad Esther was thus my chief companion, and she talked of the shore, the sea, and even of the tempests, with heightened interest The Greeks, sailor and soldier ahke, loved too well the romantic ease and careless adventure of thé place, to look with complacency on the little vessel in which they were to be borne once more into the land of restraint The fugitive colony were not the slowest in their regrets They had been deeply prepared for human vicissitude, and had humbled themselves to all things, yet, such is the strong and natural connexion of man with man, they lamented the solitude to which they must again be left, like the com inencement of a new exile There are few things more sıngulaı than the blindness which, in matters of the highest im portanee to ourselves, often hides the truth that is plain as noon to all other eyes The cause which deprived Constantius of his eloquence, and Salome of her animation, was obvious to
every one but me Nor was the mystery yet to be disclosed to my tardy knowledge. I had strayed through the cliffs, as was my custom after the heat of the day, and was takmg a last look at the sea from one of the thickets on the edge of the precipice. The sands far below me were covered with prepara¬ tion for the voyage, which, like our journey, was to commence with the rising sun The little vessel lay, a glittering toy, at anchor, with her thread like streamers playing m the breeze. The sailors were fishing, preparing their even¬ ing meal, heaving water and provisions down the rocks, or enjoying themselves over flagons of Syrian wine round their fires, all was the activity of a sea port, but, from the height on which I lay, all was but the activity of a mole hill " And is it of such materials," mused I, " that ambition is made ? is it to command, to be gazed on, to be shouted after by such miť-vs and atoms as those, that life is exhausted m watching and weariness, that our true en joyments are sacrificed, that the present and the future are equally cast from us, that
the hand ıs dipped in blood, and tlie earth deso lated ' What must Alexander s tnumph have looked, to one who saw it from the towers of Babylon 7 a triumph of emmets'" I smiled at the moral of three hundred feet of precipice A step in the thicket put philosophy to flight My wife stood before me, and nevei saw I even her beauty more beautiful The exertion of the ascent had coloured hei cheek tlie breeze had scattered her raven locks across a forehead of the purest white, her hp wore the smiles so long absent, and there was alto¬ gether an air of hope and joy in her counte nance, that made me instinctively ask of wh it good news she was the bearer W thout ι word she sat down beside me, and pressed my hand between hers, she fixed her eyes on mme tned to speak, and failing, fell on my netk and burst into tears Alarmed at hci sobs and the wild beating of her heart I was ibout to rise for assistance, when she detained mt and the smile returned, she bared her fore head to the breeze, and recovering, disbur thened her soul
" How many billows," said she, gazing on the soa, " will roll between that little bark and this shore to morrow ' There is always some¬ thing melancholy in parting Yet, if that vessel could feel, with what delight would she not wing her way to Cyprus lovely Cyprus 7 " I was surprised' " Miriam' this from you ? Can you regret the place of paganism-—tlie land ofyour captivity'" " No," was the answer, with a look of lofty truth, " I abhorred the guilty profanations of the pagan, and who can love the dungeon ' Even were Cyprus a paradise, I should have felt unhappy in the separation from my country and from you Yet those alone who have seeu the matchless loveliness ofthe island—the per petual animation of life in α climate, and in the midst of scenes made for happiness—can know the sacrifice that must be made by its people in leaving it, and leaving it perhaps for ever " " The crew of that galley are not to be tried by long exile In two days, at furthest, they will anchor in their own harbours ' " And how deeply must the sacrifice be,
enhanced by the abandonment of rank, wealth, professional honours '—and this is the sacrifice on which I have been sent to consult my husband " I was totally at a loss to conceive of whom she spoke " Our friend—our deliverer from captivity or death—the generous being, who, through infinite hazards, restored your wife and children to happiness and home— ' " Constantius ! impossible —At the very age of ambition, with his talents, his knowledge of life, bis prospects ofthe highest distinction'— " Constantius will never return to Cyprus in that galley—Wtll nevtr draw sword for Rome ıgaın —will llover quit the land given by Heaven to our fathers, if such be the will of Sala- thiel " Strange —■-But his motives' he is superior to the fickleness that abandons an honourable course of life through the pure love of novelty or is he weary of the absurdities of paganism ' ' " Thoroughly weary—more than weary, he has abjured them for ever and ever '
** You rejoice me But it was to be expected from his manly mmd You have brought an illustrious convert, my beloved, and if your captivity has done this, it was the will of Heaven Constantius shall be led with distinction to the temple, and be one of our¬ selves Judea may yet require such men Our holy religion may exnlt m sneh conquests from the darkness ofthe idolatrous world " The voice of the hermits at their evening prayer now arose, and held us in a silence, which neither seemed inclined tc break. Many thoughts pressed on my mind , the addition *v oui circle of a man whom I honoured and esteemed, the accession ofa practised soldier to our cause, the near approach of the hour of con flict, the precarious fate of those I loved, in the great convulsion which was to rend away the Roman yoke, or leave Judea a tomb I acci¬ dentally looked up, and saw that Miriam had been as abstracted as myself But war and policy were not in the contemplations of ttie beaming countenance, nor their words on the hps that quivered and crimsoned before me
Her eyes were fixed on the sky, nnd she w as m evident prayer, which I desired not to dis¬ turb Sae at length caught my glance, and blushed like one detected, but quickly reco¬ vering—said, m a tone never to be iorgotten, " My husband ' my lord ' my love ' would that I dared open my whole spirit to you ' would that you could read for yourself the truths written m my heart '" " Miriam '" " This is no reproach But I know your strength of opinion,—your passion for all that concerns the glory of Israel,—your right, the right of talents and character to the foremost lank among the priesthood, and those things repel me " " Speak out at once We can have no conceal ments, Miriam, candour, candour m all things " You have heard the prayers of those exiles you acknowledge their acquirements ana under¬ standings, they have sacrificed much, every thing—friends, country, the world Can such men have been imposed on' can they have imposed on themselves' Is it possible that
their sacrifices could have been made for a fiction } ' " The question is difficult We are strangely the sl ives of h ihit and impulse Men every day abindon the most obvious gootl for the most palpable follies Enthusiasm is α minor m idness ' But are those exiles enthusiasts' They are grave men, experienced in life, their language is totally pure from extravagance they reason with smgul ir cle iiness, they live with the most stuking command ovei the Inbits of then original condition Greeks, you see no haste of temper no violence of language among them Once idolaters, they shrink from the thought of idols Now fugitive and persecuted, they pray for then persecutors, sharing the lair of wild beasts, and driven out from all that they knew and loved, they utter no complaint—they even rejoico m their cilamity, and offer up praises to the meicy that shut the gates of earth upon their steps, only to open the gates of heaven "lam no persecutor, Miriam Nay, I ho
nour the self denial, as I doubt not the sincerity of those men But if they have thrown off a portion of their early blindness, why not desire the full illumination' Why linger half way between falsehood and truth ? It is not, ач you know, our custom to solicit pToselytes But such men might be not unworthy of the hope of Israel " " It is to the hope oi Israel that they have come, that they cling, that they look np for a recompense, a glorious recompense for their sufferings." " Let them then join us at sunnse, and come to our holy city " 11 Salatliiol, the time is declared, when men shall worship not m that mountain alone, but througli aU lands, when the yoke of our law shall be lightened, and the weary shall have rest, when the altar shal' pass away, as tbe illustrious victim has passed, and *he wisdom of Heaven shall be the possession of all man¬ kind " ï looked at her in astonishment " Мшат,
this from you ' from α daughter of the blood of Aaron ' from tho wife ofa servant of the Tern pie ' have you become a Christian ΐ ' " I have done nothing in presumption I have prayed to the Source of light that he would enlighten my understanding, f have night and day examined the law and the piophets Bear with my weakness, Salatluel, if it be proved weakness But if it be wisdom, know ledge, and truth, I implore you by our love, by the higher interests ofyour own soul, to follow my example " It was impossible to answer harshly to a remonstrance expressed with the overflowing fondness of the heart I could only remind her of the unchangeable promises made to Judaism " But it is of those promises I speak, urged she, " we have seen the day that our faiher Abraham longed to see, that mighty Being, the Lord of eternity, ihe express image of the glory of the Invisible, the hope of the patriarch, the promise of the prophet, has come " " Yet Israel is divided and enslaved, torn by
capncious tyra my and hurrying to the common convulsions and common ruin of doomed na tions Is this the triumphant kingdom of pro phecy ? I have doubted like you » but I have been at length convinced out of tho mouths of the prophets themselves Have they not declared that Israel should sufler before it triumphed and suffei too for a period that strikes the mind with terror that the King of Israel should be excluded from his king dom —nay take upon him the form of α servant —my die and die by α death oí pain and shame the death of а slave and en mmol ? It is so written But it is beyond our power to reconcile Pray then for the power and it will be given to you Ask for the spirit of holy intel ligence and it will enlighten jou Pride is tit crime of our nation Humdity the righteous resolution to follow truth and leave prejudice to its fate w ould take the film from the eye of our people Salathiel my lord the being trea
smed in my heart Read the Scriptures I have prayed for you —Read*—- " " But how can the promise of the kingdom be lesisted-* it fills the whole volume of prophecy It is the theme first, last, and without cud, of all the inspired masters of Israel What splen¬ dour and reality of history was ever more vivid and real than the glorious promises of Isaiah 7 " But what force and minuteness of pic tuung ever excelled Isaiah's description of the lowliness, the obscurity, the rejection, the ago¬ nies, and the death ofthe Messiah '' Why shall we suppose that the one description is true and the other false ? Has not the same inspiration given both' Why shall we conceive that the Messiah and his kingdom must appear together' We see the time of his first coming defined to a year by our great prophet Daniel But where do we see the time of the triumphant king¬ dom defined ? Why may it not follow at a distance of ages ? We know that we shpll stand at the latter day upon the earth, and in our flesh shall see God Why shall not the triumph be reserved for that day of glory 7 Are
our people now fit to be a nation of kings ' Or are the best of us, in our present imperfection, in the mortal feebleness of our nature, fit to share m α triumph in which angels ore to minister ' fit dwellers ofa city from which error and evil are to be excluded, in which there is to be no tear, no human suffering, no remembered bitterness, * a city whose builder and maker is God, within whose walls Uve holiness, power, sublime intelligence, and imperishable virtue, on whose throne sits in light the Ommpo tent' Sensations to which ï dared not give utter¬ ance oppressed me my enme, my fate, rose up before the mental eye I had no answer to this admirable woman. Her pure and fer vid zeal, her love, and holiness of heart, touched every chord in mme But the veil was dark upon my mmd Let no man blame the stub bornness of the Jew, till he has weighed the in¬ fluence of feelings born with a people, strength¬ ened by their history, reinforced by miracle, and authenticated by the words of inspiration That J idaism was purity itself to the worship
and morals of the pagan world, that it was the continued object of a particular Providence, that it alone possessed the revelations of God , were facts that defied doubt. And that those high distinctions should be made void, and the slavish and profligate mmd of paganism be ad¬ mitted into our privileges, still more, that it should be admitted, to the exclusion of the chosen line, seemed to me a conclusion that no reasoning could substantiate, a fantastic and airy fiction, to which no reasoning could be applied The moon ascended in calm glory, and her 01 b, slightly tinged by the many-coloured clouds that lay upon the horizon, threw a famt silver upon the precipice The sounds below were hushed , the moving figures, the vessel, the sea, the cliffs, were totally veiled m purple mist We tould not have been more alone if we were seated on a cloud and the beauty, the exalted gestme, and the glowing wisdom of the being before me, were like those that we conceive of spints delegated to lead the disembodied mind upwards from world to world
A sea bird, winging its way above our heads, broke the reverie I reminded my teacher that it grew late, and our absence might produce anxiety " Salathiel,' said she, with mmgled fervour and softness,—" you know I love you , never was heart more fondly bound to another than mine is to you I am grateful for your per mission to receive Constantius into our tribe But one obligation, infinitely deaier, you can confer on me,—read this scroll ' She drew from her bosom a letter, wntten to his church by one of the Christian leaders in Asia " I de¬ sire not to oflend your convictions, nor to hasten you into a rash adoption of those of others But m this scroll you will find philosophy with out its pride, and knowledge without its guile, you will find more, the disclosure of tliose mysteries which have so long perplexed our people read, and may He who can bring wis¬ dom out of the lips of babes, and make the wisdom of the wise foolishness, shed his light upon the generous heart of my husband '" At another tune, I might have started in
horror fiom this avowal of her faith Butthe scene, the tire unis tances, atı unaccountable ut terimi impression—a voice of the soul, probi luted me I took her tiemblmg haud, and, with¬ out a word, led her down to our dwelling.
CHAPTER XV No tidings sooner make themselves kimnn than those of the heart We found bui daughters waiting anxiously at the entrance ol the cave, which had been fitted up for our temporary shelter Before a word could be exchanged a glance from Miriam told the sue tess of her mission, and sorrow was turned into dehght Esther danced round me and was eloquent in her gratitude Salome shed silent tears, and when I attempted to wipe them away fell tainting into my arms Wt spent a part of the night m the open air the last wine and fruits of our store were brought out the Cypriot exilée came down
from their rocks the crew of the galley al reatíy on board danced sang md drank to the success ofthe voyage md it was not till the moon our only I imp was about to be ex tinguished in the waters tint we thought of closing our final night on the Syn n shore We travelled along the co st as f r as Be rytus then turning to the e istw rd crossed the Libanus ind the mountain country th t branches into Upper Galilee Ourtoining lmd been long announced and we found Lltazai Jub il ai d our chief kinsmen w nting at one ot the passes to lead us home in tnumph Tfie joy of our tribe was honest it it wis tumulti! ous and many a shout disti rbed the solitude as we moved along My impatience increased when we reached the well known lulls that sheltered what was once my home Yet I remembered too keenly the shock oí seeing its desol ition not to dread the first sight of the spot ind rode aw iy from the group at full speed that my nervousness might have time to subside bef ure their arriv I But at the foot of the last ascent I diew tlie
rem. Every tree, every bush, almost every stone, hnd been familiar to me in my wander¬ ings , and were now painful memorials of tlie long malady of my iniud. Eleazai, vţho watched me during the lutter part ol the journey with something of a con¬ sciousness of my thoughts, put spurs to his horse, and found me standing, pale and palpi¬ tating. " Come," said he, " we must not alarm Mmam by thinking too much of the past, let us try if the top of the hill will not give us a bettei prospect th tn the bottom." I shrank írom the attempt " No 1 ' said I, 1 the horror that the prospect once gave me must not be renewed. Let us change tbe route, no matter how far round, the sight of that ruin would distract me to the last hour of my hfe." He only smiled m reply, and catching my bridle, galloped forward. A few seconds placed us on the summit ot the hill. Could I believe my eyes ' All below was as if rapme never had been there The gardens, the cattle, the dwelling, lay a fairy picture under the eye.
' 4 This ıs miracle ' I excluimed " No, or it is but the miracle of a little activity, alid а great deal of goDd-will," was the answer " Your kinsmen did this at the time when yon were slumbering with the wolf and bear in the Libanus Nature did her part m cover¬ ing your fields and gardens, and those sheep nnd cattle are a tribute of gratitude from your brother, for the preservation of his life " Our troop now ascended the height. The land lav beneath them in the richness of summer They were anient in their expres¬ sions of surprise and pleasure We rushed down the defile, and I was once more mastei of u home Public events had rapidly npened in mf absence. Popular wrath was stimulated by incieased exaction Law was more palpably perverted into insolence and injury Order was giving way on all sides The Boman gat*- risotii, neglected and ill paid, were adopting the desperate habits of the populate, and ш the general scorn of religion and right, the country was becoming a horde of robbers.

pressing thoughts at a distance. My wife and daughters returned to their gnceful pursuits, with the added pleasure of novelty, after so long a cessation I hunted through the lulls with Constantius, or, traversing the touutry wluth might yet be the scene of events, availed my¬ self of the knowledge of a mastei of the whole science of Roman war At home, the v iks of the great poets of the west, with whom our guest had made us famdiar, v ant J the hours , but I found a still more stiri nig and tongenial interest in the histories of Gieek \a- lour, and ш the study ofthe mighty nmids that made and unmade empires With the touch¬ ing and picturesque n irrative of Hei odotus in my hand, I pantingly followed the adven¬ tures of the most bnlliant of nations Γ fought the battle with thein against the Per¬ sian, I saw them gathered m httle startled groups on the hills, flying in their little gal¬ leys from island to island, the I ind deserted, the sea covered with fugitives, the Persian fleets, loaded with Asiatic pomp, darkening the waters hke a thunder-cloud, and in a moment

been permitted, merely to blunt the edge of incurable misfortune Incessant suffering would have made a double miracle essential to my existence I was permitted at intervals to re cruit the strength, that was to be tried till the end of time I was one day immersed in Polybms, with my master ш soldiership at my side guiding me by his living comment through the wonders of the Punic campaigns, when Eleazar entered, with a look that implied his coming on a matter of importance Constantius rose to withdraw " No, said my brother, " the subject of my mission is one that should not be concealed from the preserver of our kindred. It may be one of happiness to us all Salome is arrived at the age, and more than the age, when the daugh ters of Israel marry She must give way to our general wish, and play the matron at last ' He turned with a smile to Constantius, and asked his assent to the opinion he received no answer The young Greek had plunged more deeply than ever into the passage of tlie Alps

handsome steeds The group before me might have made a body-guard for a Persian king. Jubal had long looked on my daughter with the admiration due to her singular beauty, it was the custom to wed within our tribe he was the favourite and the heir of her uncle, she hnd never absolutely banished him from lier pre- вепсе, and in the buoyancy of natural spirits the boldness of a temperament born for a sol· dier, and perhaps in the allowable consciousness of a showy form, he had admitted none of tlie perplexities of a trembling lover Salome was at length announced, aud the proposed husband w as left to plead his own cause
CHAPTER ΧΛΙ Wr received tht fntnds of our uitendtd son witli the accusi imed hospitality, but to me the tumult of many voices, and even the sight ofa crowd, however happy, still excited the old dış¬ tın b mees ofa shaken system I leit my guests to the с ire of Eleazar, and gilloped into the fields to gather compostile fiom the air of fruits and flowers A home¬ ward glance showed me, to my Γ ι prise, the whole troop mounted , and in another moment it speed across the hills I hastened back Mmam met me My kinsman had openly dis ttaimed my alliance Indignant and disappointed, I prepared to
follow and demand the cause of this insult As I passed under а vine that shadowed one of tbe pavilions, my daughters voice anested me She was talking with Constantius, and m tears Scorning mere curiosity, I yet was anxious for sincere explanation I felt that if Salome had a wish which «lie feored to divulge to hei father, this was my onlv hope of obtaining the knowledge The voices were feeble, and I tould for α while catch but a broken sentence. " I owed it to lum,' said she, " not to de ceive bis partiality He offeied all that it could have done a Tewish maiden honour to re ceive,—his heart, hand, and fortune ' " And you rejected them all ' said Constan tius " Have you no regrets for the lover— no fears of the father 7 ' " Гог Jubal I had too high an esteem, to give him a promise which I could not keep I knew Ins generous nature I told him at once, that there was an invincible obstacle '" " ï should like incomparably to know^ what that obstacle coulel be " said Con stantius
The natural playfulness oí this sweet and fighi heaited girl had already superseded the tear, ind she replied—" That a philosopher ought to know all things without questioning " But there is much in the world that defies philosophy, my fair Salome, and of all its pro bltms, the most perplexing is the nund of woman*—■ of young, lovely, dangerous wo man - " Now, Cons tau it us, you abandon the plulo sopher, and talk the language of the poet ' ' Yet without the poets imagination No, I need picture no beauty from the clouds—no nymph from the fountains—no loveliness that haunts the trees, and breathes moie than mm t il melody on the ear Salome' my muse is be¬ fore me ' " You are a Greek," said she, after a slight interval, " and the Greeks are privileged to talk, and to deceive " " Salome f I am a Greek no longer What I shill yet be, may depend upon the fairest årtiet that ever fashioned the human mind But mine are not the words of inexperience I am

Farewell, phi losophy "
" Then farewell philosophy, said Constan tius and caught her hand, as she was htly moving from the pavilion He led her towards tlie casement " Then farewell philosophy, my sweet and welcome truth, virtue, and lăture I loved you m your captivity, I loved you m your freedom, on the sea, on the shore, in the desert in your home, 1 loved you.

more " I tore the faintmg girl from his arms He made no resistance—no reply Salome re¬ covered with a gush of tears, and feebly pro¬ nounced his name "Iara with you otdl, my love," he pronounced in an unaltered tone. She looked up, and, as if she had then first seen me, sprang forward with a cry of terror " Go, ' said I, " go to your chamber, weak girl, and on your knees atone for your disobedience —for (do I live to say it ? ) your abandonment of the faith of your fathers But no, it is im¬ possible , you cannot have been so guilty this Greek—this foreign bringer m of fables— this smooth intruder on the peace of families, cannot have so tnumphed over your under¬ standing " ** I have been rash, Sir," said Constantius loftily, " I may have been unwise too in my language, but I have been no deceiver.

presence the sight of the ungrateful sickens me Go, and pervert others—hypocnte, or rather, take my contemptuous forgiveness, and repent, in sackcloth and ashes, the basest crime of the basest mind Come, daughter, and leave the baffled idolater to think of hie crime " I wab leading her away—she struggled, and I cast her from me Constantius, with his cheek burning and his eye flashing, approached her My taunts had at length roused hnn *' Now, Salome,' said he, haughtily glancing on me, (I injured as I am, I disclaim all idle deference for an authority used only to give pain You are my betrothed, you shall be my bride· Let us go forth, and try our chante together through the world " She was silent, and wept oidy more violently But, with one hand covering her face, she repelled him with the other " Then you will be the wife of Jubal*" said he. " Never ' ' she firmly pronounced " So help me Heaven, never ' *' Retire, girl," I exclaimed, " and weep
tears of blood for your rebellion Go, stranger — ingrate — seduter — and never darken my tlneshold more Aye, now I see the cause of my brave kinsman's departure He was circum¬ vented A wilier tongue was here before him.

on his manner and his countenance Jubal was ra the apartment, whith he traversed backwards and forwards in high indignation He made no return to my salute, but by stopping short, and gazing lull on mo with a look of mingled anger and surprise " Jubal, ' said I, " kinsman, we must be friends " I held out my hand, which he took with no fervent pressure. " I am here only to explain this idle offence ' " It requires no explanation," interrupted Jubal, sternly " I, and I alone, am to blame, if there be any one to blame in the matter The offer may have been precipitate, or un welcome, or unpardou ible, from one still lie- pendent, still without rank m the tribes it may have been fit tbat I should be haughtily rejected by the family of the descendant ot Aaron, but," said he, pressing his strong hand upon his throat, os if to keep down a burst of passion, " the subject is at an end, now and lor ever at an end " He recommenced his striding through the chamber " Let us hear all, my friend," said I "I
know that Salome tiunks highly of your spirit, antl your heart Was there anv palliation of fered 7 Did she disclose any secret reason for a conduct so opposite to her natural gentleness, to her natural regard for you, and which she must feel so oflensive to me 7 But, insult from my family, impossible' ' Hear, then I had not alighted from my horse, when I saw displeasure written in the face of every female in your household From the very handmaids up to their mistress, they had, with the instinct of woman, discovered my object, and, with tbe usual deliberation of tht sex, had made up their mmds without hearing a syllable Your wift received me, it is true, with the grace and tourteousness that belong to her above women, but she was visibly cold Esther absolutely shrank from me, and scoi ned to ıetum a word Salome fled As for tho attend mts, they frowned and muttered upon me in all directions, with the most candid wrath possible In short, I could not have fared worse, had I been a Roman, come to
take possession, or an Arab, riding up to rifle every soul m the house ' " Ominous enough 1 ' said Eleazar, with his grave smile. " The opinions of the sex are irresistible With half my knowledge of them, Jubal, you would Ьале turned your hoise s head homewaids at once, and given up your hopes of a bride, at least till the next day, or the next hour, or whatever may be the usual time for the sex s changt of mmd Cheer up, kms man, we will caparison ourselves in another dress, let time do its work, ride over to Sala thiels mansion to morrow, and find a smile for every frown of to day " But you saw Salome' said I " I am im patient to hear how she could have \ entured to offend Could she dare to refuse my brother s request without a reason 7 ' " No, her conduct was altogether without disguise She fust tried to laugh me out of my purpose, then argued, then wept, and, finally told me that our alliance was impossible " Rash girl, but she has been led into this
folly by others yet the chief folly was my own. Aye, my eyes were dim, where a mole would have seen In my fteble negligence, m my contemptuous disregaid for the common piudence of mankind, I suíľcied ar alien, ι subtle, showy, plausible villam to remain undei my roof, till he has, by what arts ΐ know not, wiled away the duty and the understanding— nay, I tremble to pionounce the word, tht religion of my child " I smote my breast in sorrow and hunnh ıtıoıı Jubal burst from the apartment, and ie turned with his lance in a hand quivering with wrath " Now, all is cleared," tried he, " the true cause was the magit, the cunning superstition, of that idolater I know the ar s of paganism to bewitch the senses of woman , the incantations, the perfumes, the midnight fires, and images, and songs But let him come within the throw of this javelin, and then try whether all his magic can shield him." Eleazar grasped his robe, as he was again rushing out " Stop, madman. Is it with hands dipped in blood, that you are to solicit the heart
of Salome' Give me that horrid weapon, and vou, Salatluel, curb your wild spirit, and listen to a brother, who can have no interest but in the happiness of both and all If Salome, whom I loved an infant on the knee, and love to this moment, the mobt ingenuous and h ıppy hearted being on earth, has been betrayed into a fondness for this stianger, how have we the light to force her inclinations ? But I know the depth of understanding that lies under her play fulness, can she have been deceived, and least of all by those idle arts ? Impossible ' — It she have sacrificed her obedience to the noble form and high accomplishments of the Greek we can only lament hei exposuie to a captiva tion made to subdue the heart of woman since the world began Jubal,' interrupted I, give me that manly and honest hand Eleazar s wisdom is too calm to understand a father or a lover You shall return with me you shall be my son Salatluel has no other This foolish girl will be sorry for hei folhes, and rejoice to re ceive you Tht Greek is driven from my house
And let me see who there will henceforth dis¬ obey " The lovei's face brightened with joy. " Well, make your experiment," said Eleazar, rising " So end all councils of war, m more confusion than they began But, if I had a wife and daughters----- -" " Of course, you would manage them to per¬ fection. So say all who have never had either." Eleazar's cheek coloured slightly, but with his recovering smile of benevolence, he followed us to the porch, and wished us success in our expedition. We found the household tranquilhsed again Miriam received me with one of those radiant smiles, that are a husband s ht st vv elcome home She had succeeded in с duung the mmds of hei daughters, and, a much more difficult task, ш suppressing the wrath of the numerous female domtstics, who had, as usual, constructed out of the graces of the Greek mid the beauty of Salome, a little romance of their own In the whole course of my life, I never met ι iemale, from the flat nosed and ebony-colouied
monster of the tropics, to the snow-white and sublime divinity ofa Greek isle, without a touch of romance, repulsiveness could not conceal it, age could not extinguish it, vicissitude could not change it I have found it in all times and places, like a spring of fresh waters starting up even from the flint, cheering the cheerless, softening the insensible, renovating the withered, a secret whisper in the ear of every woman alive that, to the last, passion might flutter its rosy pinions round her brow The strong prejudices of our nation gave way before female fondness for love adventure rebellion was but hushed, and I was warned by many a look, of the unwelcome suitor whom I brought among them But, from Sa lome there was no remonstrance I should have listened to none The consciousness of my own want of judgment in suffering a man so calculated to attract the eye of innocent youth, to become an inmate in iny house, the vexation wluch I felt at the dismissal of my brother's heir, and, last and keenest pang, the înioad made in the faith of a daughter of
Israel, combined to exasperate me beyond the bounds of patience I loved my child with the strongest affection of a heart rocked by all the tides of passion but I could bear to look upon the pale beauty of her face, and hear her deep sighs—nay, in thewiath ofthe hour, could have seen her borne to the grave— rather than permit the command to be disputed, by which she was to wed m our tnbe To shorten a period of which I felt the full bitterness, the marriage was burned on Never w as the ceremony anticipated with less joy we were all unhappy Lleazar remon strated, but in vain Jubal retracted, but I compelled him to adhere to his proposal Mi nam was closeted perpetually with the be trothed , and of the whole household Ľsther alone walked or talked with me, and it was then only to burst out mto descriptions of her sister's misery, or to pursue ine througli the endless mazes of argument on the hardship of being forced to be happy The marriage preparations proceeded The piece of silver was given, the contracts were
signed Tha presents of both families wert made The portion was agreed upon It was not customary to require the appearance of the bride until the celebration itself and Salome was invisible during those days of activity, in which however I took the chief interest, for nothing could be further from ¿eai than the conduct of the other agents Jubal alone excepted He had recovered the easily recovered con fidence of youth and perhaps prided himself on the triumph over a rival so formidable Two oi three petitions for an interview came to me from my daughter But I knew their purport and steadily determined not to hazard the temptation ot htr te irs The day came and with it the guests our dwelling was full of banqueting The even ing came when the ceremony was to be per formed, and the bride led home to her hus bands house in the usual tnumph One ot our customs was that а procession of the bride groom ь younger friends male and female, should be formed outside the house to wait for the coming forth of the marned pair The
ceremony was borrowed by other nations but in our bright climate and cloudless nights the profusion of lamps and torches the burning perfumes glittering dresses and fant tstit joy of the dancing and singmg crowd n id une quailed liveliness and beauty I remained at my casement gazmg on tie brilliant es-coit that as it gathered and arranged itself along the gardens looked like α flight of glow worms But no marnale summons came I grew unpa tient My only answer was the sight of Jubal rushing from the house and an outcry among the women Salome was not to be found She had been left by herself for a few hours as was the custom to arrange her thoughts for a ceremony which we considered religious in the highest degree On the bridegroom s arrival she dibappeared The blow struck me deep Had I driven her into the arms of the Greek by my severity ? Had I driven her out of her sensea ? or out of life 7 Conjecture on conjecture stung me í reprobated my own cruelty refused consola
tion, and spent the night in alternate self-up- braidings and prayers for my unhappy child Search was mdefatigably made. The jea¬ lousy of Jubal, the manly anxiety of Eleazar, the hurt feelings ot our tribe, insulted by the possibility that their chieftain's heir should have beeu scorned, and that the triumph should be to an alien, were embarked in the pursuit. But search was hopeless and after days and nights of weariness, I returned to my home, there to be raet by sorrowing faces, and to feel that every tear was foi ced by my own obstinacy. I shrank info solitude. I exclaimed that the vengeance, the more than vengeance of the dreadful day of Jerusalem, had struck its hea¬ viest blow on me, ш the loss ofmy child ·
CHAPTER XVII I was in one of those fits of abstraction, re¬ viving the misery in which my beloved daugh¬ ter might be, even in that moment, if indeed she were m existence, when the door of my cham¬ ber opened softly, and one of my domestics appeared, making а sign il of silence This was he whom I had detected in correspond¬ ence with the Roman agent, and forgive n through the entreaties of Miriam The man had since shown remarkable interest in the recovery of my daughter, and thus completely reinstated himself He knelt before me , and, with more humility thau I desired, implored
my pirdon for having again held intercourse with tht Roman. " It was my zeal," said he, " to gain intel ligcnce , for I knew that nothing passtd m the pioviuces a secret from him. This letter is his answer, and perhaps I shall be forgiven for the s ike of what it contains " I read it with treni bhng avidity It was mysterious, described two fugitives who had made their escape to Cttsarea, antl intimated that, as they were about to fly mto Asia Minor, the pursuit must be im¬ mediate, and conducted with the utmost se crecy I was instantly on horseback. Dreading to disturb my fimily by false hopes, I ordered out my hounds, ranged the hills in sight of my dwelling, and then turning off, struck in the spur, antl, attended only by the domestic, went full speed to Cæsarea Trom the summit of Mount Carmel, I looked down upon the city and the broad Mediterranean But my eyes then felt no dehght in the grandeur of art or nature The pompous structures on which Herod the Great had expended a treasure be-

settle the matter with the Emperor The fact ts, that I am too tender-hearted to govern such t nation ot dagger bearers So, to Nero' If we cannot send the Lmperor money, we will at least send him men " He laughed vehemently it the conception, ordered the singing and dancing slaves to return, called for wme, and plunged again into his favourite cup Septi¬ mms rose, and led me into another chamber I ìemonstrated against the injustice ofmy seizure He lamented it, but said that the ordeis from Rome were stnct, and that I was denounced by some of the chiefs in Jerusalem as the head of the late insurrection, and the projector of a new one The procurator, he added, had been for some time anxious to get me into his power w ithout raising a disturbance among my tribe, the treachery of my domestic had been em¬ ployed to effect this, and "now," concluded he, " my best wish for you—a wish prompted hv motives of which you can form no con¬ jecture, is, that you may be suit to Rome Every day that sees vou in Cæsarea sees you

The huge silver chandelier, that threw a blaze ov er the fretted roof, began to twinkle before me, tbe busts and statues gradually mingled, and I was once moie m the land of visions Home was before my eyes I was suddenly tossed upou the ocean I stood befoie Nero and was addiessmg him with a formal harangue, when the whole tissue was broken up, by α sullen voice commanding me to rise A soldier, sword in hand was by the couch he pointed to the door, where an armed party were in attendance, and informed me that I was ordered for immediate embarkation It was scarcely past midnight, the stars were stdl m their glory, the pharos threw a long Ime of flame on the waters, the city sounds were hushed, and silent as a procession to the grave, we moved down to where the tall vessel lay rocking with the breeze At her side a Nubian slave put a note into my hand, it was from the young Roman, requesting my acceptance of wine and fruits fiom the palace and wishing me a prosperous result to my voyige The
sails were hoisted, the stately mole, that even m the night looked a mount of marble, was cleared, the libation was poured to the Tritons foi our speedy passage, and the blazing pharos was ι apidly seen but as a twinkling star
CHAPTER XVIII Ouït tnreme flew befoie the wind By diy breik the coast wis but а pale line along the waters but Carmel still towered proudly eminent and with its top alternately clouded and glittering in the sun might lı ive been taken for a gigantic beacon throwing up alter nate smoke and llame With what eyes did I continue to look until the mighty hill too sank m the w iters' But thought still lingered on the shore I saw with a keenness more thm of the eye tnt familj circle through mauy an hour of gazing on the waters I was all but standing in the midst of those walls which I might never more see listening to the uncom
plaining sighs of Minam, the impassioned re¬ monstrances of my sole remaining child, and busied in the still harder task of finding out some defence against the solf accusation that laid the charge of rashness and ciuelty heavy upon my soul But the scene round me was the very reverse of moody meditation The captain was a thorough Italian tnerarch, osten¬ tatious, gay, given to superstition, antl occa sionally a little of a freethinker His ship was to lum child, wife, and world, and at every manoeuvre he claimed from us such tribute as a father might for the virtues of his favourite offspring perpetual luck was in every thing fhat she did she knew every headland from Cyprus to Ostia a pilot was a mere supernu- meiary she could run the whole course without the helm, if she pleased. She beat the Li burman for speed, the Cypriot, for comfort the Sicilian, for safety, and every other \essel on the seas for every other quality. "AH he asked was, to live in her, while he lived at all, and to go down in her, when the Fates were at last to cut his thread, as they did those of all captains whether on sea or land '
The panegyric of the good ship Ganymede was m some degree merited she carritd us on boldly Γ r a sea in which the winds are constant when they come, but in winch the calms are as constant as the winds nothing could have been more adapted than the an cient galley The sail or oir never failed If the gale arose the ship shot along like the eagle tint bore the Trojan boy light strong with its white sails full of the breeze and cleaving the surge with the rapidity of m urow If the wind fell we floated in a pa vihon screened from the sun refreshed with perfumes I timing on poop prow and masts surrounded with gilding an' the carvings md paintings oí the Greek artists dnnl mg tie licious wines listening to song and story and in all this enjoyment gliding insensil ly along on a lake of absolute s ipplure enon led and v tried by the most picturesque and lovely islands in the world The G inymede had been under especial or ders from Rome for my" transmission but the capt un felt too much respect for tho procmator not to trespass on the letter of the law so far as
to fill up the vacancies of his hold with merchan¬ dise, in which Florus drove a steady contia- baud trule Hiving done so much to gratify the governors distinguishing propensity, he next provided for Ins own , and loaded his gal¬ lant vessel mercilessly with passengers, as much prohibited as his merchandise While we were still m sight of land, I walked a lonely deck, but when the salutarv fear ol the galleys on the station was past, every corner of the Ganymetle let loose a living caigo Γοι the Jewish tlneftain going from Florus on amission to the Empcroi, as the captain con¬ ceived me and iny purpose to be, a separate portion of the detk was kept sacred But I mingled from time to time with the crowd, and thus contnved to preserve it once my respect and iny popularity Never was thtre a inore miscellaneous collection We transported into Europe a Chaldee sorcerer, an Indian gymno- soplust, an Arab teacher of astrology, а magmn fiom Persepolis, antl a Platomst from Alexan¬ dria. Such were our contributions to Onent il science We had, besides, a dealer in sleight
of hand from Damascus, an Egyptian with tame monkeys and α model of a pyramid, a Syrian serpent teacher, an Idumean maker of amulets against storm and calm, thirst and hunger, and everj other disturbance and distiess of life, an Armenian discoveier of the stone by which gold mines were to be discovered, a Byzantine inventor of the true Oriental pearls , α dealer from the Caspi m in gums superseding all that Arabia ever wept, an Epicurean philosopher, who professed indolence, and, to do him justice, was a striking example of his doctrine , and a Stoic, who having gone his rounds of the Roman garrisons as a teacher of dancing, a curer of wines, and a flute player, hid now risen into the easier vocation of a philosopher Of course, among those professors, the disco¬ verer of gold was the most moneyless, the maker ot amulets against misfortune the most miserable, and the Stoic the most impatient. The Epicuiean alone adhered to the spirit of his profession But the unstable elements round us weie α severe trial for any human philosophy but that
of a thorough Optimist Wind and water, the two most imperious of things, were our «meters and a calm, a breeze, or even a billow, often tried our reasoners too roughly for the honour of tempers so saturated with wisdom On those occasions the Platomst elefended the antiquity of Egypt with double pertinacity, the Chaldee derided its novelty by the addition of a hundred thousand years to his chronology of Babylon, the Indian with increased scorn, wrinkling his brown visage, told them that both Babylon and Egvpt were baubles of yesterday, compared with the million years of India The dagger would have silenced many a discussion on the Chief good, the ongin of benevolence, and the beauty oí virtue but for the voice of the captain, which, like thunder cleared the air He, I will allow, was the truest philosopher of us all The Trie rarch was an unconscious Optimist , nothing could touch him with shape of misfortune, for, to lum it had no existence If the storm rose, " we should get the more rapidly into port, if the calm came to fix us scorching on the face of ocean, nothing could be safer If our provi-
sions fell short, " abstemiousness now and then was worth a generation of doctors If the sun burned above us wtth the fire of ι ball of red hot iron, it was the test oí fair weather, if the sky was а mass oí vapour, " we escaped being roasted alive ' His maxims on higher subjects were equally consoling " If man had to struggle through life, struggle was tho nursing-mother of great ness If he were opulent, he had gained the end without the trouble —If man had disease, he learned patience and fortitude, essentials for sailor, soldier, and philosopher alike If he en¬ joyed health, who could doubt the blessing ·*—If he lived long, he had time for enjoyment, if he died early, he escaped the chances of the tables' turning The Optimist applied his principle to me, by gravely informing me that, ' though it depended on the Ľmpfror s state of digestion, whether I should or should not carry back my head from his presence, yet, if I lived, I should see the games of the Circus, and if I did not, I should m all probability care but little about the matter '
Nothing m the variety of later Europe gives mo a parallel to the distinctions of rank and profession, style of subsistence, and physi¬ ognomy, of the ancient world. Human na¬ ture was classed m every kingdom, province, and city, almost as rigidly as the differ¬ ent rates of mankind The divisions of the slave, the ireedman, the citizen, the artist, the priest, the man of literature, the man of public life, were marked with a ploughshare, whose fui rows wero nevei filled up but by the rarest chance. Life had the curious mixture of cos¬ tume, the palpable diversity of purpose, and the vivid intricacy ofa diama. Our voyage was rapid, but even a lingering transit would have bten t litered by the ani¬ mation of the innumerable objects oi beauty antl renown, which rise on every side in the passage through a Gietian sea The islands were then untouched by tht spoiler, the opulence of Rome had been addtd to Attic taste, and temples, theatres, and palaces, starting from groves, or studding the sides of stately hills, and reflected m the mirror of bays, smooth and bright as
polished steel, held the eye a continual captive On the sea, flights of vessels, steering in all di¬ rections, glittering with the emblems of their nations, the coloured pennants, tho painted prows, the gilded images of the protecting idols, covered the horizon with life Wo had reached the southern С ipe oí Grtete and were, wtth a boldness unusual to ancient navigation, stretching across in a starlees night, for the coast of Italy, when we caught a sound of distant music, that recalled the poetic dreams of nymphs and tritons The sound swelled and sank on the wind, as if it came from the depths of the ocean, or the bosom of the clouds As we parted from the land, it swelled richer, until it filled the midnight with pompous harmony To sleep was profanation, and we all gathered on the deck, exhausting nature and art in con¬ jectures of the cause The harmony approached and receded at in¬ tervals, grew in volume and richness, then stole away in wild murmur", or died, to revive with still more luxuriant sweetness Night passed away in delight and conjecture Morn-
ing alone brought the solution Tull in the Ыаге of sunrise steered the imperial fleet, re turning in triumph from the Olympic games with the Lmperor on board We had uncon sciously approached it during the darkness The whole scene wore the aspect of a vision summoned by the hand of an enchanter The sea was covered with the fleet in order of battle Some of the galleys were of vast size and all were gleaming with gold and decorations silken sails garlands on the masts trophits hung over the sides, and embroidered streamers of every shape and hue, met the mormng light We passed the wing of tho fleet close enough to see the sacrificial fires on the poop of the imperial quinquereme A crowd in purple and military habits were standing round a throne, above which proudly waved the scarlei /lag of command A figure advanced all tore heads were bowed, acclamations rent the air the trumpets o f the fleet flounshed and tht lofty and luxuriant harmonies that had charmed us in the night, agmn swelled upon the wind and followed us long after the whole float
íng splendour had dissolved into the distant blue. At length, the headlands of the noble bay of Tarentum rose above the horizon. While we were i linning with the speed of a lapwing, the captain, to our suiprise, shortened sail. I soon discov ered that no philosophy was perfect, that tven the Optimist thought that daylight might be woi so than useless, and that a blot had been left m creation in the shape of a custom-house ofiicer. Night fell at last, the moon, to which our captain had taken a sudden aversion, was as cloudy as he could desire, and we rushed in between tho glimmering watch-towers on the Japygmn and Lacmian promontories. The glow of light along the waters soon pointed out where the luxunous citizens of Tarentum were enjoy¬ ing the banquet m their barges aad villas Next came the hum of the great city, whose popular boast was, like that of later times, that it had more holidays than days m the year. But the Tnerarch's often-painted delight at hnding himself free to rove among the indul-
genees of his favourite shore had lost its poign tnty and with а firmness wluch stt the Ston m α ι ige tht I pituiean in a state of rebellie n and the wliole tribe of our sages in a temper of mere mort il remonstrance hc ι esisted dike tht remonstrance ind the allurement and sulltiily t ist anchor in the centre of the bay It was not until song and feast had died and nil was hushed that ht stole with the slightest possible noise to the back of the mole and sending us below disburthep Q d his conscience and the good ship Ganymede I 1 id no tune to give to the glories of Ta renturn Neros approach huiried my dtpar tme The centurion who had me in charge trcmbltd it tbe idea of delay and we rode thiough tho midst of three hundred thousand sleepers ш streets of mat ble and ranks of tro plues ıs silently and swiftly as if we had been the ghosts of their ancestors When the day broke we found ourselves among the Lucanian hills then no desert but living with population and bright with the memorials of Italian opu lence and taste From the inn where we halted
to change horses, the Tarentine gulf spread bro id and bold before the eye The city of luxury and of power once the lulei of southern Italy, and mistress of the seas that sent out armies and fleets worthy to contest the supremacy with Pyrrhus and the Carthaginian, was, from this spot sunk, like all the works of man, into littleness But the gulf like all the works of nature grew in gran deur Its circular shore edged with thirteen cities the deep azure of its smooth waters, m 1 ud with the flashes of sunrise, and traversed by fleets, diminished to toys, reminded me of one of the magnificent Roman shields wuh its centre of -sanguine steel, the silver incrustation of the rim, and the stoned sculpture We passed at full speed through the Luca man and Samman provinces, fine sweeps of cul tivated country, interspersed with the hunting grounds of the great patricians , forests that had not felt the axe for centuries, and lulls sheeted with the wild vine and rose But on reaching the border of Latium I w is already m Rome I travelled α day s journey among
streets, and in the midst of a crowded and hur¬ rying population. The whole was one huge suburb, with occasional glimpses of a central mount, crowned with ghtterngand gilded struc¬ tures "There ' ' said the centnrton, with some- whatof rthgiousreverence, "Behold theetemal Capitol''—I entered Rome at night, passing through an endless number of narrow and in¬ tricate streets, where hovels, the very abode of want, weie mingled with palaces blazing with lights and echoing with festivity. Tbe centu- l ion's house was at length reached. He showed me to an apartment, and left me, saying, ' that I must prepare to be brought before the Ľmperor immediately on his arnval," I am now, thought I, in the heait of the lieart of the world, in the midst of that place of power, from which the destiny of nations issues, in the great treasure-house to which men come fiom the ends of tlie earth for know¬ ledge, for justice, for wealth, honour, thrones ' md what am I '—a solitary slave '

the eartli, the pageants of the kings of tho east and west, coming to solicit diadems, or to de¬ precate the irresistible arms of Rome, vast theatres, pubho games, that tasked the whole fertility of Italian talent, and the most prodigal lavishness of imperial luxury ; were the movers that among the three millions of Rome made life a hurricane I saw it in its full and joyous commotion, I saw it in its desperate agony, I saw it in its frivolous revival, and I shall see it iu an hour, wilder, weaker, and more terrible than all. By an influence of whioh I was then igno lant, I was permitted to be present at some of those displays, under the charge of the cen¬ turion. No man could be better fitted for a state jailor Civility sat on his lips, but caution the most profound sat beside her. He professed to have the deepest dependence on my honour, yet he never let me beyond his eye But I had no desire to escape The crisis must come, md I was as well inclined to meet it then, as to have it hanging over me Intelligence ш a few days arrived from
Biuiiduiium ofthe emperors landing, and ol lus intention to remain at Antium, on the road *o Rome, until his triumphal entry should bt prepared My fate now hung in the scale I was ordered to attend the imperial presence At the vestibule of the Antian palace my care ful centurion deposited me in the hands ofa senator As I followed him through tbe halls a young female richly attired, and of the most beautiful face and iorm, crossed us, light and graceful as a dancing nymph The senator bowed profoundly She beckoned to him, and they ex ch uiged a few words I was probably the subject, for her countenance, sparkling with the animation of youth and loveliness, grew pale at once she clasped both her hands upon her eyes nnd rushed into an inner chamber. She knew Nero well, and dearly she was yet to pay for her knowledge The senator, to my inquiring glance, answered in a whisper, "The Empress Poppœa ' A few steps onward, and I stood in the pre sence of the most formidable being on earth. Yet, whatever might have been the natural VOL ι N

horses' feet m the court-yards below, trumpets sounded, there was confusion in the palace, the troops hurried under arms, and I saw a squadron of cavalry set off at full speed. As I was gazing on the spectacle before me, which perpetually became more menacing, the door of my cell slowly opened, and a masked figure stood ироп the threshold. I had made up my mind, and demanding if he was the executioner, told him " that I was ready." The figure paused, listened to the sounds below, and after looking for ι while on the troops ш the court¬ yard, signified by signs that I had a chance of saving my life The love of existence rushed back upon me I eagerly inquired what was to be done He drew from under his cloak the dress of a Roman slave, which I put on, and noise¬ lessly followed his steps through a long succes¬ sion of small and strangely intricate passages. We found no difficulty from guards or domes¬ tics The whole palace was in a state of ex¬ traordinary confusion Every human being was packing up something or other rich vases, myrrhine-cups, table-services, were lying m
heaps on the floois, books costly dresses uisti u ments oí music, all the appendages of luxury were flung loose m every direction from tlie sudden breaking up of the coin t I might have plundered the value of a province with impu nity Still we wound our hurried wav In passing along one ofthe corridors, the voice of complaining struck the ear, my mysterious guide hesitated, I gl meed through the slab of crystal that showed the chamber withm It was the one in which I had seen the Emperor, but his place was now filled by the form of youth and beauty that had crossed me on my arrival She was weeping bitterly, and reading with strong but sorrowful indignation а long list of names, probably one of those rolls m which Nero regis teied his intended victims, and which in the con fusion of departure he had left open A second glance saw her tear the paper into а thousand Iragments, and scattei them in the fountain th it gushed upon the floor I left tlus lovely and uuhappy creature, this dove in the vulture s talous, with almost а pang A fe-i"· steps more brought us mto the «pen air,
hut among bowers that covered our path with daikness At the extremity of the gardens my guide struck with Ins d igger upon a door, it was opened we found horses outside, he spiang on one, I sprang on its fellow, and palace, guards, and death were left far behind lie gtlloped so furiously, that I found it im possible to speak, and it was not till we had ι eached an eminence a few miles from Rome, where we breathed our horses, that I could ask to w hom I had been indebted for my escape But I could not extract a word from lum He made signs of silenco, and pointed with wild anxiety to the scene that spread below It was of a grandeur and terror indescribable Rome w ıs an ocean of tlame Height and depth were covered with red surges, that lolled before the blast hke an end less tide The billows burst up the sides of the hills, which they turned into instant volcanoes ex ploding volumes of smoke and fire, then plunged into the depths m α hundred glowing cataracts, then climbed and consumed again The distant sound of the tity in her convulsion wtnt to the soul. The air was filled with the steady roar oí
the advancing flame, the crash of falling houses, and the hideous outcry of the myriads flying through the streets, or surrounded and perish¬ ing in the conflagration Hostile to Rome as I was, I could not re strain the exclamation " There goes the fruit of conquest, the glory of ages, the purchase of the blood of millions' Was vanity made for man ' ' My guide continued looking forward with intense earnestness, as if he were perplexed by what avenue to enter the burning city I demanded who ho was, and whither he would lead me He returned no answer A long spire of flame that shot up from a hitherto un¬ touched quarter engrossed all his senses He struck m the spur, and making a wild gesture to me to follow, darted down the hill I pur¬ sued , we found the Appián choked with wag¬ gons, baggage of every kind, and terrified crowds hurrying into the open country To force a way through them was impossible All was clamour, violent stiuggle, and helpless death Men and women of the highest rank were on foot, trampled by the rabble, that had then lost all respect of conditions One dense
mass of miserable life, irresistible from its weight, crushed by the narrow streets, and scorched by the flames over their heads, rolled through the gates, like an endless stieam of black lava. We turned back, and attempted an entrance through the gardens of some of the villas that skirted the city wall near the Palatine. All wero deserted, and after some dangerous leaps over the burning ruins, we found ourselves in tho streets. The fire had originally broken out upon the Palatine, and hot smokes that wrapped and half blinded us, hung thick as night upon the wrecks of pavilions and palaces, but the dexterity and knowledge of my inexplicable guide carried us on. It was in vain that I insisted upon knowing the purpose of this ter¬ nble traverse. He pressed his hand on his heart in re-assurance of his fidelity, and still spurred on. We now passed under the shade of an im¬ mense range of lofty buildings, whose gloomy and solid strength seemed to bid defiance to chance and time. A sudden yell appalled me.—A ling
of fire swept roand its summit, burning cordage, sheets of canvas, and a shower of all thmgs combustible, flew into the an above our heads Au uproar followed, unlike all that I had evei heaid a hideous mixture of howls, shrieks, and groans The flames r olled down the nairow street before us, and made the passage next to impossible While we hesitated, a huge frag¬ ment ofthe building heaved, as if in an earth quake, and fortunately for us fell inwards The whole scene of terror was then open The gieat amphitheatre of Statibus Taurus had taught fiie, the stage with its inflammable furmtuie was intensely blazing below The flames were wheeling up circle above circle, through the seventy thousand seats that rose from the ground to the roof I stood in unspeakable awe and wonder on the side of this colossal civern, this mighty temple ofthe city of fire At length a descending blast cleared awav the smoke that covered the arena The cause of tliose horrid cries was now visible The wild beasts kept for the games had brok^ fi om then dens Maddened by affright and раш, lions
tigers, panthers, wolves, whole herds of the monsters of India and Africa were enclosed m an impassable barrier of fire They bounded, they fought, they screamed, they tore, they ran howling round and round the circle, they nade desperate leaps upwards through the blaze they were flung back, and fell only to fasten their fangs in each other, and with then parching jaws bathed in blood, die raging I looketl anxiously to see whether auy humaii being was involved in this fearful catastrophe To my great relief, I tould see none The keepeis aud attendants had obviously escaped As I expressed my gladness, I was startled by α loud cry from my guide, the first sound that I had heard lum utter He pointed to the oppo ¡site side of the amphitheatre Theie indeed sat an object of melancholy interest a man who had either been unable to escape, or had determined to die Escape was now impossi bl —He sat in despeiate calmness on his fune ral pile He was a gigantic Ethiopian slave, entirely naked He had chosen his place us if in mockery on the imperial throne, the fire
was above hım and around hım and under this tremendous ca ору he gazed without the inovp ment of h muscle on the combat of the wild beasts below a solitary sovereign with the whole tremendous game played for himself and inaccessible to f he power of man I was forced away from this absorbing spec tacle and we önce more tl readed the long and intricate street» of Rome As we ap proached the end of one of those bewildering passages scarcely wide enough for us to ride ■abreast I was startled by the sudden illumina tion of the sky immediately above and rei dered cautious by the experience of our hazards railed to my companion to return He pcm ted behind me and showed the fire bursting out in the houses by which we had just galloped I followed on A crowd that poured from the adjoining streets cut off our retreat Hui dreds rapidly mounted on the houses m front m the hope by throw ng them down to check the con flagration The obstacle once removed we saw the source of *he light—spectacle of horror ■ The great prison of Rome was on fire Nevtr
can I forget the sights and sounds—the dis¬ may—the hopeless agony—the fury and frenzy that then overwhelmed the heart The jailors had been forced to íly before they could loose the fetters, or open the cells oí the prisoners We saw tliose gaunt and wo begone wretches crowding to their asements, and implonng impossible help, clinging to the heated bars, toiling with then impotent grasp to tear out the massive stones, some wringing their hauds, some calling on the terrified spectators by every name of humanity to save them, some venting their despair in execrations and blasphemies that made the blood run cold, others, after many a wild effort to break loose, dashing their heads agamst the walls, or stabbing them¬ selves The people gave them outcry for out¬ cry , but the flame forbade approach Before I could extncate myself from the multitude, a whirl of fiery ashes shot upwards from the fall ing roof, the walls rent iato a thousand frag¬ ments, and the huge prison, with all its mise¬ rable inmates, was a heap of red embers Exhausted as I was by this restless fatigue,
and yet more by the melancholy sights that surrounded every step, no fatigue seemed to be felt by the singular being that governed iny movements He .sprang through the burning ι urns—he plunged into the sulphurous smoke^— he never lost the direction that he had first taken, and though bafiled and forced to turn back a hundred times, he again rushed on his track with the directness of an arrow For me to mate my way back to the gates, would be even more difficult than to push forward My ultimate safety might be ш following, and I followed To stand still, and to move, were equally penlous The streets, even with the improvements of Augustus, were still scarcely wider than the breadth of the little Italian carts that crowded them They were crooked, long, and obstructed by every impedi¬ ment of a city built in haste, after the burning by the Gauls, and with no other plan than the caprice of its hurried tenantry The houses were of immense height, chiefly wood, many loofed with thatch, and all covered or cemented with pitch The true surprise is, that it had
not been burned once a year from the time of its building The memory of Nero, that hereditary con¬ centration of vice, of whose ancestor's yellow beard the Roman orator said, " No wonder that his beard was brass, when his mouth was iron and his heart lead," the parricide and the poisoner, may yet be fairly exonerated of an act, which might have been the deed of а diunken merdicant in any of the fifty thousind hovels of this gigantic aggregate of every thing that could turn to flame We passed along through all the horrid va rieties of misery, guilt, and not, that could find their place in a great public calamity gi oups gazing in woe on the wieck of their fortunes, rushing off to the winds in vapour and fire, groups plundering in the midst of the flame, groups of rioters, escaped felons, and mur derers, exulting in the public rum, and dancing and drinking with Bacchanalian uproar gangs of robbers trampling down and stabbing the fugitives to stnp them of their last means revenge, avante, despair, profligacy, Ict loose
naked, undisguised demons, to swell the wretch¬ edness of this tremendous infliction upon и guilty and blood covered empire Still we spurred on, but our jaded horses at length sank under us, and leaving them to find their way into the fields, we struggled forward on foot The air had hitherto been calm, but now gusts began to rise, thunder growled, and the signs of tempest thickened on We gained an untouched quarter of the city, and had explored our weary passage up to the gates of a large patrician palace, when we were startled by a broad sheet of flame rushing through the sky The storm was come ra its rage. The range of pubho magazines of wood, cordage, tar, and oil, ш the valley between l e Cœlian and Palatine hills, had at length involved ш the conflagration All that we had seen before was darkness to the fierce splendour of this burning The tempest tore off the roofs, and swept them like floating islands of fire through the sky The most distant quarters on which they fell were instantly wrapped in flame One broad mass whirling from an immense
height, broke upon the palace before us A cry of terror was heard within, the gates were flung open and a crowd of domestics and persons of both sexes, attired for a banquet, poured out into the streets The palace was wrapt 11 flame My guide then foť the first time lost his self- possession He staggered towards me with the appearance of a man who had received a spear head in his bosom I caught him before he fell, but his head sank, his knees bent under him, and his white hps quivered with unintelli¬ gible sounds, I could distinguish only the words ■—" gone, gone for ever 1 ' The flame had akeady seized upon the pnn cipal floors of the palace, and tht volumes of smoke tbat poured through every window and entrance, rendered the attempt to save those still within a work of extreme hazard But ladders were npidly placed, ropes were flung, and the activity of the attendants and retainers was boldly exerted, till all were presumed to have been saved and the building was left to burn My overwhelmed guide was lying on the
ground, wheu a sudden scream was htard and a figure, in the robts and with the rosy trowu of tho binquet, ¿trange contnst to her fearful situation, was seen flying fiom win¬ dow to window m the upper ρ irt of the muu sion It was supposed that sht had fainted in the first terror and betn forgotttn Tlie height, the fierceness of the flume whith now com pletely mastered rtsistance, the volum- of smoke that suflocated every man who ap proached, made the chance ot saving this un¬ fortunate being utteily desperate in the opinion of the multitude My spirit shuddered at the horrors of this desertion I looked round at my companion he was kneeling, щ helpless agony, with ins hands lifted up to heaven Anothtr stream, wilder than ever, pierttd my senses I seized an axe from one of tlie domestics, caught a ladder from another, and in a paroxysm of hope, iear, and pity, scaltd the burning wall A shout from below followed me I entered at the first window that I could reach All before me was cloud I rushed on, struggled, stumbled
ovei furniture and fragments of all kinds, fell ıose again, lound myself trampling upon pre cious things, plate and crystal, and still axe m hand, forced my way I at length reached the banqueting room Fhe figure had mushed Λ strange suptrstition of childhood а thought tint I might have been lured by some Spint of evil into this pi ice of rum, suddenly came over me I stopped to gather my faculties I leaned against one of the pill irs, it was hot, the floor shook and crackled under my tread, the w ills heaved, the flime hissed below, and over heid roaied the whulwind and burst the thunder peal My brain was fevered The immense golden i imps still burning tht long tables disoidtred yet glittering with the tostly orn tments of pa triu m luxury the se ittered Tyri m couches, the sc trlet e inopy th it coveied the whole r mge of the tables, and gav e the h tU the aspect of an imperial pavilion, p irti illy torn down in the confusion of the İlı 0 lıt, ill assumed to me a hoi rid and bewildered splendour 'Ihe smokes were already rising tluou 0 h the crevices of the
floor, the snell of flame was on my robes, a huge volume of yellow vapour slowly wreathed and nrched round the chair at the head of the banquet I could have imaged a fearful lord of the feast under that cloudy veil ' Every thing round me was marked with preternatural fear, magnificence, and ruin A low groan broke my reverie I heard tlie voice of one ni despair I heard the broken words, " Oh, bitter fruit of disobedience '—Oh, my mother, shall I never see your face again' —For one crime I am doomed —Eternal mercy, let my crime be washed aWay—let my spirit ascend pure —Farewell, mother, sister, father, husband '' With the last word I heard a fall, as if the spirit had left the body I sprang towards the sound I met but the solid wall '* Hoinble illusion," I cried—" am I mad, or the victim of the powers of dark ness' I tore away the hangings—a dooi was before me ï burst it through with a blow of the axe, and saw stretched on the floor, and in¬ sensible—Salome ' I caught my child in my arms, I bathed her
forehead with my te irs , I besought her to look up, to give some sign of life, to hear the full forgiveness of my breaking heart. She looked not, answered not, breathed not. To make a last effort for her life, I carried hei into the ban¬ quet room But the fire had forced its w ay there, the wind bursting in, had carried the flame through tht long galleries, and flashes and spires of lund hght already darting through the doors, gave fearful evidence that the last stone of the palace must soon go down I bore my unhappy daughter towards the window, but tho height was deadly, no gestme could be seen through the piles of smoke, the help of man was in vain To my increased misery, the current of air revived Salome, at the inst mt when I hoped that by insensibility she would escape the final pang She breatned, stood, and, opening her eyes, fixed on me the \ atant stare of one scarcely aroused from sleep. Still clasped ш my arms, she gazed again, but my wild face covered with dust, my half-burnt hair, the axe gleaming m my hand, terrified her,
she uttered a scream, and darted away from me headlong nto the centre of the burning I rushtd aftei hei, calling on her name A column of fire shot up between us, I felt the floor smk , all was then suffocation— I strug gled, and fell. ------
CHAPTER XX I awoeíf with a sensıtıoıı of pam m every lunb A female voice was singmg a faint song near me But tlie past was like л dıeam. I involuntaiily looked down for the gulf on wluch I had tiod—I looked upward foi the bui mug rifters I saw nothing but an earthen floor, and a low roof hung with dned grapes and herbs I utteied a cry. The singer ap¬ pioached me But there was nothing m her aspect to nurtme a diseased imagination, she was an old and emaciated creatuie, who yet benevolently rejoiced in my restoration. She in turn с tiled her husband, a venerable Jew, whose first act was to offer thanksgrv mg to the
God of Israel for the safety of a chief of his nation. But to my inquiries for the fate of my child, he could give no answer, he had dis covered me among the rums of the palace of the Æmihi, to which he with many of his countrymen had been attracted with the object of collecting whatever remnants of furniture might be left by the flames. I had fallen by the edge of a fountain which extinguished the fire m its vicinage, and was found breathing. During three days I had lain insensible The Jew now went out, and brought batk with lum some of the elders of our people, who, after the decree of the Emperor Claudius, remained in Rome, though m increased privacy. I was carried to their house of assemblage, concealed among groves and vineyards beyond the gates, and attended to with a care which might cure all things but the wounds of the mind. On the great object of my solicitude, the fAe of my Salome, I could obtain no relief. I wandered over the site of the palace, it was now a mass of ashes and charcoal, its ruins had been probed
by hundreds, but search for even a trace of wlnt would have been to me dearer than a mountain of gold, was m vain The conflagran m tontmued six days, and evtry day of the number gave birth ю some monstious report of its origin Of the fourteen districts of Rome, but four remained Thot' «ands had lost their lives tens of thousands weie utterly undone The wh ie empire shook under the blow Then came *he still deeper borror Fear makes the individual feeble, but it makes the multitude ierocious An universal cr\ arose foi revenge Great public misfortunes give the opportunity that the passions of men and sects love, iind tlie fiercest satufites oi selfishness are justified under the name of îetri- bution But the full storm burst on the Christi ins, then too new to have roihiiul themselves in the national prejudices if tliey woultl have suflered the alhance, too pooi to reckon any powerful protectors, and too uncompromising to palliate their scorn of the whole public
system of morals, philosophy, and religion The emperor, the pnesthood, and the populace, con¬ spired agunst them, and they were ordered to the slaughter I too hid my stimulants to hatred Where was I ' m exile, m despeiate hazard,—I had been lorn from home, robbed of iny child, made miserable by the fear of apostacy in my house, and by whom was this comprehensive evil done ' The name of Chris tian was gall to me I heard of the popular vengeance, ..nd called it justice, I saw the distant fires in which the Christians were consuming, and calculated how many each night of those horrors would abstiact from the guilty number Man becomes cruel by tht sight of cruelty, and when thousands and hundreds of thousands were shouting for ven¬ geance, when every face looked iury, and every tongue was wild with some new accusation when the great, the little, the philosopher, the ignorant, ruisul up one îoai of repiobation against the Christians, was the solitary man of meicy to be looked for in one bleeding fr m head to foot with wiongs irreparable '
During one of those dreadful nights I was gating fiom the house top on the fut foicing its way through the remaining quarters , the melancholy gleams through the country, showing the extent oí the flight, and in the midst of the blackened antl dieaiy wastes of Rome, Uie spots of livid flame, where the Christians weie perishing at the pile, when I was summoned to a consultation below. One of our people hid leturned with an imperial edict piocluming pardon of all offences to the discoverei of Christians. I would not have purchased my life by tho life of a dog. But my safety was impoitant to the Jewish cause, and I was pressed on evety side by arguments on the wisdom, ıı iy, the public duty of accept¬ ing fieedom on any terms And what was to be the piice ? the life of cinmnals long ob¬ noxious to the laws, and now stained beyond mei су I lo ithed delay, I loathed Rome, I was wild to ι eturn to the great cause of my country, which never could ïnve a faner hope than now. An emissary was sent out, money soon effected the distovery of a Christian assemblage I ар-
peared before the piætor with my documents, and brought back in my hand the imperial pardon, given with the greater good-will, as the assemblage chant ed to comprehend the chiefs of the heiesy They were seized, or¬ dered forthw ith to the pile, and I was ordered to be present at tlus completion of mv national service. The executions weie in the gardens of the imperial palice, whith hid been thiown open by Neio, ior the double purpose of popu¬ larity, and of indulging himself with the display oí death at the slightest personal im ornemente The ciowd was prodigious, and to ¿i atıf y the greatest possible number at once, those mur ders were carnet! on in diíUrent parts of the gardens In the vmey-ntt, a certain poition were to be crucified, in the oiangery, another portion were to be burnt, in the pleasure- ground, another were to be torn by lions md tigers, gladiators were to be let loose, and when the dusk came on, the whole of the space was to be lighted by human torches, Christians wrapped m folds of Imen covered with pitch and bitumen, and thus burning
down fiom the heul to the ground I was horrot strick, but escape wis impossible, and I must go through the whole hideous round W'th my flesh quivenng, my tars ringing, my tyes dun, I wis forced to see miserable beings, men, nay women, nay nifuits, sewed up in skins of beasts, hunted tnd toni to pieces by dogs, old men, whose hotrv h ui c nugat ha\e demanded reverence of sav iges, scourged, racked, and nailed to the tiees to tho, lovely young females, creatures ot guileless heaits and innocent be uity, flung on ilumng se iflokls And this was the work of man, civilised man, in the highest civilisation of tht irts, the manners, and the learning ofthe ancient woi Id But the grand displ iy was piepared for the lime, when thost Christians, who had bten tie nounted on my discovery, were to he executed an exhibition at which the Emperor himself testifitd Ins intention to be present The gieat Cu cus was no more, but a temporary ampin theatie of the turf had been elected, in which the usu il games were exhibited during the early part of the day At the hour of my

he had long since been prohibited), and awake to a period of discord and of bon¬ dage—a period of wo and turmoil-—of secret apprehension for all, and tribulation especially for those of his humble state- is fixed the era of the ensuing narrative. It was an era of torment and of massacre, of real fanaticism and hypocrisy. Few families of distinction, resident in certain parts of the holy and other lands, were fortunate enough to escape the endurance of some heavy calamity, amid those pe¬ rilous times, inflicted, it is probable, as a suitable penance for their shameful ac¬ quiescence in the absurd and barbarous misconception of a faith whose precepts, such as are unperverted by over-zealous b 3 churchmen,
the inferior orders a ; the motto of the t, aqmhi mm capim deemed consistent with
wis\ under the guise of leaders and in- quisitors, made no scruple of depopulating provinces (Mxoe of whose inhabitants, it must be acknowledged, well merited such severity, for their hypocritical assumption of sanctity), in the profane furtherance of the* own pnaeoded holy, but diabolical purpose. About this period, and even at a much later epoch, the tongues of the brother¬ hood of almost every holy order in exist¬ ence were remarkably active in propaga¬ ting various absurd traditions respecting their monasteries, the miracles performed by their saints, or the unhallowed myste¬ ries of their polluted cloisters; and to a little better than grotesque fabrication of the latter kind, we shail have occasion fre¬ quently
quently to allude during ^ie progress of the succeeding ■/** tmgyvd hystorye. w The thunder »ow rolfed heavily over the awM crap and towering precipices of the romantically-situated and renowned Montserrat, whose every giddy chasm and pine-clad promontory sullenly reverberated the discordant sound, adding thereto a thousand different and gradually deepen¬ ing echoes, which served still further to heighten the apprehensions of the listener, and aggravate the solemnity of the scene. On every side the prospect was rugged and appalling in the extreme; the vivid lightning, bursting at intervals from the lowering firmament, flashed hastily across the uneven path, revealing little to the startled and disordered eye of the be¬ nighted pilgrim, save huge dusky masses of earth or stone, and rendering the awful aspect of the surrounding atmosphere yet more terrifically visible. In another mo¬ ment all was silence and obscurity—anon fresh sheets of pale electric fire issued from b 4 the
the' scowling horizon, iMumining with a skdkly sort of radiaiM^ the affrighted waste, or Reaming horribly upon tbe rocky pro¬ montories, which skmm: diversmed tlie dreary and comfortless view; and now, perciiMM^, toitiy exhibiting a variety of distant cones, or acclivities of a pyramidal tern, each of which is a separate moan- tain : again tim awakened thunder growled defiance from the gloomy and gathering cloud which overhung the whole; and again was its solemn roar reechoed and redoubled by the multiplying voices of many a surrounding solitary dingle. The rain had not commenced; but the intense and still increasing murkiness of the angry sky, accompanied by a low, fitful breeze, which swept occasionally over the roman¬ tic surface of the adjacent country, toge¬ ther with the signs already mentioned, gave unerring presages of an approaching and violent storm. Amid this appalling conflict of the ele¬ ments, in dread of being assailed at every instant
instant by the accumulated deluge which seemed ready to descend, was at intervals observed intrepMly ascending tbe dark mountain, a handsome, well-proportioned youth, indifferently habited in a plain Spanish garb, supporting on his arm the form of a fair female, who seemed almost fainting from excess of terror and fatigue They were preceded by a stout muleteer, who evidently officiated as guide, although the timidity expressed in his countenance did not announce him to be a conductor likely to impart any considerable degree of encouragement to the youthful pair who followed him ; neither did the reluc¬ tance and irresolution he displayed be¬ speak him a guide on whom much depen¬ dence might be placed. His attire con¬ sisted of a dirty brown habit, made in tlie fashion of the country, surmounted by a red woollen cap, which fell forwards over the countenance, after the custom of the poorest natives of Catalonia. To corre¬ spond with this drooping tiara (the un- B 5 graceful
gj^aeefal headdress of the humblest class, who struggle io obtain a precarious suJb- ©steoce by driving mules over the adja¬ cent country), he wore on his ieg?s a wretched imitation of buskins, fornaed with pieces of leather wrapped carelessly round the feet, and fastened with cords above the ancles. In this low garb, and with evident trepidation, he preceded the two travellers towards the summit of the mouatafe, where, built midway up the steep and dangerous ascent, stood that ve¬ nerable sanctuary to belated wanderers, the fan-lamed monastery of Montserrat; while often as the muleteer laboured on¬ wards, in the direction of the sacred edi¬ fice, his eyes were cast in wild affright upon the calmer visage of the youth, and the languid, but equally beautiful features of the maiden who followed his wary and irresolute footsteps, as if to gather thence some portion of that courage by which he perceived them to be animatedi In addition, moreover, to the group al¬ ready
ready described, must be mentioned a pale and shivering female, who apparently act¬ ed in the capacity of an attendant, and was* at the present juncture, closely pur¬ suing the form of her almost sinking mis¬ tress ; since (whatever might have been her deficiency in point of courage, or for¬ titude displayed in the vicissitudes she had yet to endure) the steady attachment and unshaken integrity of the faithful Inez de¬ serve better at the hands of her biographer than to be overlooked, or even slightly commended. An unbroken silence had heretofore reigned over the whole party for several minutes, which not even an exclamation of weariness from the affright¬ ed females was suffered to interrupt or dissipate: at length the youth, slowly rais¬ ing his fine dark eyes to the prospect be¬ fore him, and perceiving that he was yet unable to penetrate the gloom which en¬ veloped it, turned them in disappointment upon his trembling guide, and began to interrogate him respecting the distance B 6 they
Aqr, had still to traverse.—- a May our lady d^d us r ex claimed the young cavalier, ill an inti-epid although not ori gen tie tone —»** may our good lady of Montserrat shield us! fcr this is a perilous night—Art thou sure, gentle knave, that thou hast not wandered from the track ? Methinks we appear to have journeyed over a space of wmmy leagues.** " The elevation, senor, ,, returned the guide, with greater discernment than they had hitherto given him credit for possess¬ ing, ** the elevation of the monastery ren¬ ders the path more toilsome, and length¬ ens out the distance, as many a weary pilgrim who has bathed its pebbles with his bleeding feet can testify. We have not yet reached the crucifix of skulls, nor the eminence from whence it can be dis¬ cerned ; but feel you not, as you trail your steps over this fearful mound, the sward sink under you ? beneath us is the grave of the suicide; and yonder is the bloody pool* created by Heaven's own agency, upoa
Upou the spot where ©nee a holy abbot yielded his innocent breath beneath tlie ftirious daggers of leagued ruffians." A flash ®£ lightning at that moment chanced to illumine tlie surrounding ob¬ jects, and the speaker shuddered visibly, as his eye glanced over a small pond of liquid, which the transitory glare of the sulphureous element distinctly revealed to be of the colour of blood! The mind of the stranger was far too noble to be even for an instant affected by superstitious fears; but the females, who also witnessed the appalling spectacle, nowevidently par¬ took of their conductor's consternation. After an involuntary pause of silent horror and amazement, during which they continued to ascend the precipice, which soon became so steep, as to seem almost inaccessible, the youthful interrogator, whom we shall call Fernandez, and to whom the incredible relation which per¬ tained to the unsolid earth and bloody- mantled pool seemed a narrative by no means

It appeared by the reply, which how- ever was scarcely intelligible, owing to the apparent reluctance of the speaker to in¬ terfere with what he termed spiritual a& fairs, that father Geronimo was a subor¬ dinate member of the adjacent monastery, whose office in particular was to attend to the reception of strangers, regulate their apartments, and provide for their enter*. tainment; and as the hospitality of the institution was justly renowned all over the vicinity, whence numerous parties of mendicants and others were accustomed to visit the edifice, this situation was no sinecure. The inferiority of his station among

If sible pinnacle of tiie neighbouring sum¬ mit, whence issuing their commands with unparalleled audacity, they kept the sur¬ rounding peasantry in awe, and not un* frequently, it is said, compelled even tbe monks themselves to pay them tribute; threatening, if they refused, to demolish their sanctuary, by hurling from their efe- vated abode, which overhung the convent, huge fragments of rock, that were kept piled together for that purpose. On these occasions, moreover, it is averred, the pu¬ sillanimous brotherhood were in the habit of passively restoring unanimity, by grant¬ ing their desires, even at the expence of impoverishing their order. Having thus far premised, we must now return to the terrified muleteer, who trem¬ bled palpably as he approached their fast¬ ness, and heartily wished himself in his own solitary cabin, near the environs of Barcelona, on the seashore, where his coarse pallet, over which skipped innu¬ merable kinds of vermin, invited him to slumber,
anamig the monks, and tiie correspondent humility of their guide's condition in so- caety, had brought them acquainted; arid fei tint worthy confidant it was plain, fatiier Geronimo had whispered his conjectures of & spiritual compact having been entered into by the leader of a bloody and coura¬ geous band of outlaws, which infested the neighbouring mountain. Such was the garbled communication of the guide, intermingled occasionally with many a significant repetition of the words ** yellow horde," and ** yellow de¬ mon,** rendered sufficiently conspicuous by tbe tone of horror and dread in which they were uttered. Of this savage ban¬ ditti, and its enterprising chief, it will be hereafter needful to say much; but the period of their interference with the theme of our narrative is not yet come; suffice it, therefore, at present to observe, respect¬ ing the terrible Roldan and his atrocious confederates, that they comprised a formi¬ dable force, inhabiting the loftiest acces¬ sible
limber; while the monotonous murmur of the w&veii soothed and lengthened his repose* From a confused reverie of this unplea- sing kind, he wm presently awakened by a sudden start, and exclamation of terror, from the females of the party, whose coral lips tlie imposing aspect and influence of the scene had hitherto closed in silence. He raised his eyes, and beheld at a short distance before them, now glittering be¬ neath a succession of bright flashes, which seemed appropriately to illuminate its hollow eyeless sockets, the crucifix of skuBs* which he knew to be erected wer the site of the monastery. This strange and truly appalling sight, revealed at such an instant amid the dismal raging of the tempest, their conductor now discovered had filled the fair Isabel, and her timid attendant Inez, with apprehension and dismay; tame ceeded

This well-timed explanation somewhat reassured the trembling Isabel, who now recollected having formerly heard of the circumstance; and failed not also to arouse Fernandez, who after calming the emo¬ tion of his agitated companion, and gently reprobating that of her attendant, had suffered himself unwittingly to sink into a contemplation of the singular although reverential object which had arrested their attention. He found, on gazing around the level plain which now gradually open¬ ed upon his wondering sight, that their reluctant guide, whose apprehensions in¬ deed
deed seemed somewhat abated, had spo¬ ken the truth, and that they had now in view the end of their journey; for as the ruddy lightning burst forth again with increased brilliancy, he could plainly dis¬ tinguish the sable walls of the convent peeping above the few small intervening crags, or promontories, they had yet to scramble over, which he perceived to his gratification were wholly insignificant, when compared with those they had al¬ ready surmounted. And now, as he turned his visage upwards, in thank¬ fulness to that divine Protector, who, more essentially than the half-clad beg¬ gar who conducted them, had contri¬ buted to their safe and speedy arrival, he felt upon his features the early drops of an approaching shower; which circum¬ stance tended still further to heighten his satisfaction at having gained the hospi¬ table entrance, ere the storui had poured it» fury on the unskeltered heads of his o^i^ionsl^^ y:^\y iy-'i';^ b0&y-; v y ■ 'They
They now, amid tremendous sheets of vivid lightning, and furious peals of long- continued thunder, arrived at the monas¬ tic edifice, which was a large square build¬ ing, walled round on every side, and over¬ hung by many gigantic precipices, on one of which was affixed the emblem of divi¬ nity and death already mentioned. An¬ other, which peered far above the pre¬ ceding, and whose lofty brow seemed lost in the shadowy thunder-cloud which enveloped it, was known to be the haunt ofthe banditti, whom many attempts had been made by the surrounding grandees, but in vain, to annihilate, or dislodge from their secure abiding-place. On each side of the gigantic portal stood a pair of somewhat dilapidated but colossal statues, before one of which the guide now pro¬ strated himself, with real humility and unaffected gratitude; while Fernandez, secure of a kind reception from the hos¬ pitable fraternity, having given the accus¬ tomed signal, endeavoured to animate the declining
*dB»1ng spitto of bis almost femting charge. Iu a few moments they observed lig^lt Uttitig past the iminted easements of the venerahte stmctur^^ a coiM%sed noise within, as of approaching footsteps, wiiich sound was presently aug¬ mented by the murmur of several voices, to the great joy of Fernandez, who (chiefly on account of his drooping feUow-travel- lem^ waited for admittance with impati¬ ence and anxiety.

CHAPTER II. " Not here unwelcome, though wokaown— Enter aud rest," the friar said. The moon that through the portal shone, Shone on his reverend head. Spanish Ballad. After a brief interval, the door was opened by a meagre-looking personage, in a monk's habit, who presently ushered them, with a low reverence, into the outer hall of the convent; and here, after wel¬ coming them in a whining tone, was pro¬ ceeding to congratulate them upon having escaped the storm, when he was interrupt¬ ed by the guide, who having by this time muttered his thanks for the protection al¬ ready experienced, and recommended him¬ self, on his return, to the especial care of the saint, came running, in order to re* ceive his recompence. Perceiving, how¬ ever,
ever, on his entrance, the holy man, with whom they appeared engaged, he forbore to press his claim on their liberality, until he had prostrated himself a second time before the friar, and in due form received his blessing; for so superstitious are the lower orders of Catalonia—among which priest-ridden, but not otherwise ignorant, community, might truly be reckoned our worthy muleteer—that they regard even the hem of a monk's garment, or any other relic of his sacred attire, as worthy of being idolized and worshipped in their unenlightened -enthusiasm. This duty therefore being first accomplished, which the; reverend father very willingly per¬ formed, guessing most probably, as he spoke the benediction, at the amount of the largess which must follow, the newly- sanctified guide arose with renovated Faa- crity, and doffing his cap, extended it to¬ wards Fernandez, with a supplicatory ex¬ pression of countenance which it was im¬ possible to mistake. The gratefu 1 youth, yy,yy . with
with a significant smile, drew forth his purse, which the monk contented himself with surveying askance, over the shoulder of the sinking Isabel, who was reclining in the arms of her attendant, but at sight of which the eyes of the needy, starved muleteer glistened in an unwonted man¬ ner with joy and expectation. While this was passing, unobserved by Fernandez, the latter spoke with delibe¬ ration and dignity.—" Thou hast indeed, honest fellow," said he, addressing the overjoyed muleteer, ** well merited thy recompence, which has been right valiant¬ ly earned, considering thou art neither sol* dier nor exorcist, and which shall now be doubled, in token of my gratitude for thy services and fidelity; for much as I have heard of these renowned walls, 1 knew not the road hither; and but for thy hu¬ mane assistance—I speak it to thy praise, in presence of this holy father here—we might have perished on the outside of yonder miserable posada, whose inhos- vol. i. c pitable

Oh tlie table stood an hourglass, the sand of which seemed almost exhausted; and ahbve the hearth, where blazed a cheerful fire, for the sole benefit as they conjectured, of travellers who might chance to arrive during the tempest, was placed a marble image of the Virgin, before which were suspended a couple of small brazen lamps. While yet they gazed on these plain symbols of de¬ votion, which their wily conductor allow¬ ed them sufficient time to admire, the mingled rain and hail began to clatter vio¬ lently against the lofty casement, and they distinctly heard the deep bell of the mo¬ nastery announce the eleventh hour of the night. But it now becomes necessary to digress for a short period, in order to render some more particular account of the characters newly arrived at the convent, as well as the origin and object of their hasty and cl unseason-

Alfieri de Gracy was an opulent farmer residing in the neighbourhood of Barcelo¬ na, around which famous city his domains extended to a considerable distance. He had an only daughter, of whose innocent endearments and enlivening society he was so excessively fond, as seldom to suffer her, for any lengthened period, from his sight. Her mother had died of the plague a few years antecedent to the commencement of our narrative, which had cruelly ravaged Spain and the adjacent territories, some¬ times sweeping off whole families in its c 5 destructive

But this state of tranquillity, at least, and therefore of Comparative felicity, was not long toendure; the time approached when Isabel would seek some other, and (in the eyesof a Spanish virgin possessed of beauty and accomplishments) far tenderer ties than those of paternal affection, however ardent and gratifying such might be; and this was the period fixed upon by fortune for the temporary subversion of their hap- pinesSi Velasquez de Leon was another weal¬ thy husbandman* whose lands were scarce¬ ly inferior to the spacious possessions of Alfieri in extent, and whose residence was in the immediate vicinity of that person's, each being situated at the respective boun¬ daries of their separate demesnes, which were divided only by the beaten road that conducted from Barcelona to the monas¬ tery. Now it chanced that Velasquez and Alfieri had a quarrel about a small portion of barren ground, of little service to either, c 6 but
kitid of peril, ahd, returned unharmed te^his uncomfortat4e residence. Thus did tie ^strijnin^ Fernandez pass several te- ^otts^d^ihprd^^ lamentatiob times did he cursear^ deprecate the o stinate maMce of de Gracy, whose suocessj h# douhted^ not, had driv father to srich a singular mode of avoiding au reth^ihbra^ haps r^W selivdestructionr but th of ^ief was soon to be supplanted in his rfe^^^a^^^ it is true^ but no less uneontrollaole^ inhabitan t^-that of love* It was while enga^d in the pursuance Of hisi accustomed m <his rustic occjupatibns having been wholly neglected by him since the strange disap- pearance of his only surviving relative), that Fernandez deL tal glimpse ot the divine Isabel, the very first sight of whose unrivalled perfections, notwithstanding he knew her to be the cherished daughter of his other's invete- rate

Accordingly on the concerted evening, Alfieri de Gracy being absent from his home, a circum¬ stance which very rarely happened, had intrusted the charge of his domestic af¬ fairs for a few hours to his daughter, and a principal

A somewhat lengthened interval had elapsed before fhe meagre monk who es- corted the^ weary coh^e to their present apartment (accompanied as aforesaid by their attendant Inez, who had chosen to elope^ with her ybung mistress) again made his appearance; at length he returned with one who; by his garb, was a holy brother of their order, but whose station was evidently much inferior to his own. To him he briefly committed the care of the guests, and desired that he would look to their instant accommodation in every respect, adding, that himself would be re- sponsibk for the str^ and
and devotion to their saint; this said^ he slowly, and with a low reverence, retired. F'ernandez failed not to remark the sig¬ nificant termination of this speech, andhis disgust was excited accordingly against the hypocritical speaker: he looked on it as an appeal to his generosity, where none such ought to have been made; for was he not entitled to the three days' largess, in- common with the poorest pilgrim who sought admittance to their shrine* ? These thoughts, concurring with his recollection of the muleteer's inhospitable treatment, determined Fernandez to despise at least one member of the holy sanctuary in which he found himself for the present immured. These and similar reflections he could hardly conceal from the penetration and sagacity of the monk now left behind, who, to do him justice, appeared a per¬ sonage from whom a very different sort of conduct

This circumstance again did not escape unnoticed by the observant youth, who could not avoid thinking that a strange degree of irregularity (attribu¬ table perhaps to the partial thraldom in which the holy brotherhood were held by " : yyyytMe.:
tiie banditti) seem to pervade even this renowned estahlishment. And now, as they en tered the aforesaid chaniber, which appeared set apart for the convenience of travellers, their ho rightly surmising the cogi^ guest, shook his head mildly, and the door with caution, exclaimed in a low tone, expressive of severe disappointment and contritition-H^* Ah, sqn, son, all is not as it should be, even in the convent of Montserrat.

that night to receive the final sacrament t^^^^l^aiiax; jtopoii^^j^^m<>ny*v he said* was generally performed in presence onfy of the assembled brotherhood; but added, that on the present occasion, it might surely be presumed the awe-in¬ spiring conflict of nature would palliate their intrusion on the solemn and affecting scene. The concluding remark determined the youth and his trembling companions to attend and witness the appalling tions for eternity. Fernandez inquired the sick monk's name; it was father Au¬ gustine, was theanswer; and they instant¬ ly arose to accompany the good-humoured Geronimo to the chapel of the monastery. The solemn pealings of the majestic organ reverberated along the torch-illu mi¬ ned aisles, as they proceeded, and con¬ tended with the hoarsely-echoing thunder for predominance. One minute the faint sound of a distant choir Informed them the chanting had already commenced-— ; another
sribtlier minute succeeded, and all was un- interrupted silence; the hiext a dismal and discordant sound, which much resembled the roaring of baited bulls *, reminded theni again of the^ storm^ which beat with¬ out; and filled their wondering bosoms with mingled emotions of gratitude, devo- tionV arid dismay^ Fernandez and Isabel looked anxiously at each other, without uttering a^syllable; Geronimo, as he pro¬ ceeded onwards, numbered his beads in apparent consternation; and Inez, not having a rosary, counted her fingers. As they drew nearer to the illuminated chapel, the lengthened train of monks^— the glare of innumerablelamps and tapers —the rising chorus borne by a hundred voices—the full swell of the harmony, and the fragrance of the waving censers, all powerfully combined to wrap the soul in delicious ecstacies, and render the mind b 3 insensible

This singular-looking personage, whose remarkable figure, once beheld, was not easily to be forgotten, seemed pale in his complexion, even to sickliness, but gigantic in his stature, and in his deportment haugh¬ ty and unbending ; at least the attitude in which he first caught their vision, one of fiery impatience and fiercely conflicting passions; might ■'■;\weir' ! iiaye bespoke a mind of such description; but when they 0^y^f-y, ^ D 5 ...; S aw

saw him turn his languid visage towards the shrine he had just quitted, and marked his restless eye pause for a solitary instant upon the bier before it, with an expres¬ sion of inward melancholy, which seemed to say—" 1 would it were mine own!" they were fain to abandon their suddenly- conceived aversion, and pity him for the misfortunes he seemed to have endured. Again, however, his slow wandering glance would fix^ itself wildly upon the kneeling pah, and his looks again would gather a degree of sternness, almost a- mounting to ferocity, until they a second time dreaded one whom it ^etued impos¬ sible to compassionate^ and shrunk with new and terrible aversion from his scru¬ tiny. They would have found it, perhaps, extremely difficult to have analyzed the true nature or origin of the shuddering sensations they experienced, while gazing upon -his now livid countenance and mo¬ tionless figure, for his form, though tall, was exceedingly well proportioned; and his features
Matures (when divested ofthe moroseness and despondency which occasionally over¬ shadowed them) were more than com¬ monly handsome. He appeared about the age of thirty-five—it might be rather more; but a life of the strictest discipline and abstinence, added to an almost inces¬ sant state of mental inquietude, had done that for him which his years could not pos¬ sibly have accomplished—stamped his cheek with furrows, and his brow With gloom. It has been said already, that hitherto Fernandez had encountered nothing in the monastery, since his arrival, of suffi¬ cient interest to excite his curiosity-—but the case was now widely different; affect¬ ed in a peculiar manner by the unpre¬ possessing appearance df the monk before him, he panted for an opportunity of eli¬ citing from the communicative Geronimo, who he rightly guessed was acquainted with every circumstance, the cause of his do* extremely

The aibbdt Aritbrose was now seated ma¬ jestically near the chancel, or eastern ter¬ mination df the lines formed by such of the brotherhood as retained their ranks, and the whole aspect of the scene was pe¬ culiarly magnificent and imposing. Every eye, save that of the stern Oban- fto, was now fixed upon the litter of the supposed
supposed expiring Augustine, who seem¬ ed, despite the confusion of objects that surrounded him, to have surik intoasort of uneasy slumber fas appeared %y the fre¬ quent, although irregular heavings of the mantle which covered him), from which it was now time he should be awaked; accordingly the abbot slowly arose, and passing round the bier, prepared, with his own hand, as a singular mark of respect to the wretched being whose dying mo¬ ments he disturbed, to withdraw the cowl from his distorted features. *' Holy Mary!" here muttered Geroni¬ mo, whose eyes at that instant had invo- luntarily sought again the countenance of Qbando, " how horribleis his aspect! but observe—Ambrose will lift the cowl—the unction is about to be administered;" and fumbling for his crucifix and rosary, he knelt down, without further ado, beside Fernandez. An awful, and never to be forgotten pause ensued; the chant of the brother¬ hood
hood died gradually aw^ay in cadences, if not the most melodious, at least the most impressive that Isabel and Fernandez had ever heard; the very tempest seemed, at that solemn instant, to abate something of its violence, and became suddenly al¬ layed, as if withheld by some invisible power from interrupting the progress pf the scene. Ambrose the abbot now gent¬ ly drew aside the cowl of Augustine, and discovered a set of features that perfectly astounded Isabel, and rooted Fernandez to the spot where he was kneeling; for beneath that d usky covering was conceal¬ ed a well-remembered, although much-al¬ tered visage, which the frequency of bit¬ ter disappointment had long since taught him to despair of ever again beholding— it was Velasquez de Leon, his long-la¬ mented father! The eyes of Velasquez were closed, as if in death, but the frequent quivering of his parched lips, and the convulsive dis¬ tortions of his lank and varying counte¬ nance,
nance, indicated that his turbulent spirit still inhabited its clay tenement, but that he was then labouring under the frightful influence of some terrific dream. Another instant elapsed, and his body writhed upon its uneasy resting-place—his arms became suddenly uplifted—-distraction aided him, in spite of his debility, to burst the tram¬ mels of Morpheus, and starting from his slumber, he exclaimed—"Ha!—see, it is no delusion! the yellow glistering scales stream horrid light around me! It is not a mockery!—-no, it is real, substantial hor¬ ror. Spare me I —I have kept my oath! Oh, spare me, spare me !"-•• Half rising now, he opened wildly his disordered eyes, and seemed suddenly to have recol¬ lected his situation; whereupon he faintly groaned, and fell backwards upon his pallet. The monks were all amazed, and the abbot seemed no less astonished than the rest, inasmuch as he dashed away the cup of holy wine, which he was about to put to the lips ofthe dying Augustine, and retired
retired in confusion to a distance of so me^ paces. ., y§0$z But the change that quickly spread it¬ self ov|p the surrounding brotherhood was slight, compared to that which now took place in the countenance and demea^ nourrpf Obando; his blood rushed to his> hearts—his breath became suspended with e|it)|i«H|-|^- tured l#sspaleifips^ ceded from his visage* until his towering Sgillpnli^^ nothing so^ faitiifully as a shape of stone, carved in an attitude of eager expectation, or most excruciating agony;* fectionate Fernandez, on discovering, hisv beloved parent in so deplorable a situation of l^dy and^uind*! was gri^ t^ iri the exifeie^ hPw- mm^m unavailing refleptio^ ture, but instantly Quitting the side*2 even? of his adored Isabel* flew forward witli ra* pidity towards the chancel.

No sooner had he spoken, than an aged monk hobbled hastily to the shrine, and presently returned, bringing a silver cup filled with the refreshing element; this was father Geronimo: meanwhile the ab¬ bot crossed his arms meekly upon his bo¬ som, and stood at a little distance, watch¬ ing the event. * After having been plentifully sprinkled with water, which, in addition to the re¬ viving qualities usually attributed to that element, possessed also the extra recom¬ mendation of having been made holy, the faculties of Augustine were gradually re* stored.

During this period, the ceremony was unanimously suspended, and every sound, save the hollow raging of the tempest, had ceased to vibrate on the ears of |he; dying Augustine. While this awful pause con¬ tinued, Fernandez cast for a moment an inquiring glance around him, and per r ceived the lean monk Jacopo, explaiping to the abbot the means by which himself and his companions had gained admit¬ tance to the monastery only a few hours before; which recital having been duly ajttendedito*and ^th^r'Jawpo.havi'ng-rro*. ly advance^ towards tho dying monk and his newly-disc^^ as if hem ■ • toting

Accordingly Ambrose approached them, with a benig¬ nant expression of pity on his countenance, and (for he had already divined their re¬ lationship) ordered the litter, on which lay e2 stretched
stretched father Augustine, to be carried back^to his eell,i whither he also desired Fernandez to accompany him. i This command was instantly obeyed by several of the suddenly-officious brother¬ hood, who, following the example of their abbot, now crowded around the bier, won¬ dering at the pitiful use he made of his authority, while they pretended to ap¬ plaud his condescension. Meantime father Geronimo, having pre¬ sented Fernandez with the serviceable liquid; glided again towards the impatient Isabel and her attendant, requesting per¬ mission to reconduct them to their apart¬ ment, apparently with some apprehension of the probable consequences of his own imprudence, in suffering them to infringe upon the usage of the monastery; or it might be---for Geronimo was as fond pf archly acquiring strange intelligence as of communicating it to others—-with the de¬ sign of eliciting some explanation of the singular and affecting scene he had j ust witnessed.

A fairit suffusion of crimson passed for an instant over the features of the astoriished youth, which was again succeeded by alivid hue, almost as ghastly as that which characte¬ rized the affrighted and death-stricken visage of his sire. Augustine now fell backward, uttering a desponding, heartfelt groan, in a state of insensibility, from which it seemed likely he would never more be aroused. Half frantic at the sight, but unable to render any assistance until thelitter reach¬ ed his cell, Fernandez followed in speech¬ less agony ; and he who had left Barcelona on that evening with the happiest pros¬ pect, was now the most wretched inmate of an abode where wretchedness had grown so familiar, that its aspect was either scoff- ed at or wholly disregarded. At length the sable procession reached the dormitory, and the senseless form of E 4 Augustine
Augustine was borne into his cell, of which the only furniture now appeared to be a crucifix, a mattress, a chair, and a table. Into this wretched habitation they were presently followed by the stately abbot Ambrose, whose curiosity, it is probable, more than any other consideration, had induced him to depart from the general usage of the convent, under the pretext of a peculiar prepossession in favour of Fernandez; and even to wave the admi¬ nistration of the holy sacrament, until some more convenient period. With an expressive gesture of his hand, he com¬ manded the monks to withdraw on his en¬ trance, granting to Fernandez alone per¬ mission to remain—a permission of which, as may be imagined, the youth readily availed himself; and bowing respectfully for the privilege accorded him, prepared to witness, with becoming fortitude, the latter moments of the being from whom he had derived existence. Augustine had been already removed to his
his mattress by two aged monks of the order, with the assistance of Fernandez; and the reverend men had succeeded, more¬ over, by the application of various power¬ ful restoratives, in once more eliciting symp¬ toms of returning life; there remained therefore no excuse to any, not even to those who bore the repute of being skilled in medicine, for disobeying the orders of their superior; and they were obliged un¬ willingly to retire, in spite of that lurking curiosity (by no means excluded from the precincts of a monastery) which would otherwise have certainly induced them to have remained wondering spectators of the scene which followed.

Thecrimeofwhich——start not, nor look amazed, for so our holy code denominates offices of inferior mag¬ nitude—the crime of which you have this night been guilty, that of interrupting our holy ceremony, might well have sub¬ jected you to the severest penance which the mild spirit of our offended lady could desire, or the superior of Montserrat could inflict. But I design to order otherwise. The case of our brother Augustine is, I believe, too desperate to admit of cure; but if, as I conjecture, yours is the mild tone ofa kinsman's voice, the unforgotten glance of a tender friend, or the remem¬ bered touch of some dear relative, I oh. ject not to his perturbed spirit receiving the consolation often communicated by such gentle and unexceptionable means." Fernandez de Leon cast a glance of mingled gratitude and reverence towards the superior, and bending his knee grace¬ fully, replied with much humility,— Bfi "Holy

The youth ceased, and his auditor seem- ed fully occupied in considering how he could best cause the aforesaid providential occurrence to be recorded to the honour of his saint, and of the monastery; at length—*^ Most righteous son," replied the abbot, after musing for several minutes in silence, " moderate thy amazement; and learn from this to estimate truly the beneficence and power of our lady, with whom nothing is impossible. It is not the only miracle she has performed with¬ in these hallowed walls; nor are, indeed, of .late, such demonstrations of her .au¬ thority unfrequent.

I stand before you, there- lore, to solicit the speedy performance of that sacred rite which cannot be dissolved. But first, I have here a duty to accom¬ plish ; a father's consent must now be oh, tained, and a father's spirit soothed into forgetfulness of the fancied wrongs which* I fear, still trouble and afflict it; that task being soon performed^ as I trust it will be, Fernandez de Leon will again become your suitor." As he finished, he again bowed himself submissively before the abbot; and Am¬ brose could not help again admiring in¬ wardly the grace of his deportment, as well as the Ijeeoming adroitness with which he had acquitted himself Iti return, there¬ fore

My protection is already granted thee; nor needst thou dread pursuit on a night so horrible. Farewell, brave youth; I leave thee-for the present, to thy pious purpose. The storm will banish sleep- but should we meet no more until to¬ morrow's sunshine cheers the face of na¬ ture, be sure that in my prayers thou and thy suffering sire shall alike be well re¬ membered." So saying, Ambrose withdrew, leaving Fernandez to thp unmolested enjoyment (if
(if so it might be called) of a private con¬ ference with his strangely-agitated parent, desiring him, as he closed the door of the cell, if brother Augustine should again grow worse, to ring a small bell, which he would find at one end ofthe dormitory, and which would summon some of the elder members of the fraternity, who acted as physicians, to his assistance. On the departure of the abbot, Fernan¬ dez knelt once more beside the lowly mattress, whereon was stretched the wast¬ ed and altered form of the once sprightly Velasquez de Leon, and wept audibly. The tempest still continued to howl with dreadful fury, and the retiring steps of the abbot were soon drowned amid the pelting of the rain, the rushing of the hurricane, and the noise of the thunder; there was, however, an expression on the countenance of Augustine, which boded his having something to communicate—a sort of in¬ decisive gaze, which seemed to import a meaning to the effect of-« 1 will speak presently;"
the disordered monk, whose aspect had be¬ fore so terrified them ; the pensive Isabel (although she knew not wherefore, having yet no real cause to dread his presence) looked paler than before, and Inez found it impossible to quite suppress a shriek, that rose involuntarily to her lips, as she rUshed precipitately into the chamber. Obarido hurried past them, apparently in greater disturbance of mind than he had hitherto exhibited; he Omitted not, however, to cast a fierce look on Isabel, as hereceded from her sight, and the wild glare of his eyes followed her until she dis¬ appeared; with her companions. Oil finding themselves safe within the small commodious chamber, which their aged conductor entered with them, Inez angrily exclaimed—'* Santa Maria defend us! if these be holy men, there is never a ruffian betwixt here and Barcelona, better qualified than a monk to scare a timid maiden out of her senses. And then the tempest
tempest sounds so horrible—the lightning streams so awfully through every long- painted casement—grace defend us! I say again. I would not pass another night in the convent, for the blessing of all the saints in the holy calendar," They now approached the hearth, and Geroriimo motioned in silence for them to be seated. The fire was not extinguished, but instead ofthe cheerful blaze which il¬ lumined the apartment when they left it, the scattered and dying embers alone emit¬ ted a red and dismal glare; these the monk now quickly scraped together, right¬ ly judging the effect the rekindling of the flame would produce upon the drooping spirits of his companions. Meanwhile the females sat pensive, and inclined to sadness, as if oppressed by a sensation of melancholy they neither could nor wished to conceal or disperse; and long and irksome was the unbroken si¬ lence that succeeded; during which Ge¬ ronimo
ronimo busied himself in trimming the lamps, and finally endeavouring, in every possible mode, to enhance their comfort, by bettering their accommodation. <* Where is Fernandez ?" at length de¬ manded Isabel, wholly regardless of the former prattle of her attendant, of which she scarcely knew the subject; " tell me, good father, whither is he gone ?—will he soon return to us?" •*'•■ He is gone to the dormitory," replied Geronimo," and will probably not return again to-night. Your chamber is prepared —but, might I advise," added he, shaking his head significantly, "you should betake yourselves to devotion here, until this tu¬ multuous conflict shall subside, which has already shaken this hallowed edifice to the foundation stone " " It is a terrible night indeed," rejoined Isabel, in a still pensive tone, for her heart was with Fernandez, in the cell of father Augustine; imagination, moreover, pre¬ sented
sented at that moment the picture of her forsaken honie* and she cared not: what she uttered; " who that witnesses those vwid flashes, still visible in spite of the lamps that deaden their hue in vain* can vouch to have seen its equal ?" "That can I, lady," responded Geroni¬ mo, after some little hesitation* as doubt¬ ing whether the story would be agreeable at such a time, " and littie need doth it require of a retentive memory to do so. It was the very night on which father Au¬ gustine took the vows, while yet Obando (whom God preserve, I say* from the like again!) was in his fits of raving, shivering, and rambling about the cloisters. The firmament resembled a sea of sulphur— the rock of Montserrat a devoted Gomor¬ rah, to be ingulfed therein—the aisles shook palpably—the wails seemed every instant to be rent asunder; while Roldan's lofty haunt- -----but he must not be men¬ tioned ; and for my unwary utterance of his

It was seldom strangers arrived so late, and Geroni¬ mo, doubting not that the porter was still asleep, ran as fast as his corpulence would permit him, to receive and welcome his unexpected guests* This was a pause of anxiety to the lis¬ tening Isabel, and of alarm to Inez; the former dreaded the pursuit of her father, and the latter the intrusion of more strange faces, as ugly and forbidding as those she had heretofore encountered; among which Carlossa's was the only one she could deem even

I see a dusk and awful figure rise, Like an infernal god from out the earth; His face wrapped in a mantle, and his form Robed as with angry clouds. Byron. The tempest was now raging at its height; the vivid lightning, assuming a redder hue, and a yet fiercer aspect than it had heretofore exhibited, darted in va¬ rious directions around the blackened ho- rizon, or descending in vast sheets of flame, seemed to sleep for a few moments on the shrubless and desolate tract of ground that surrounded the monastery, de¬ prived of its verdure by the frequent tread of barefooted pilgrims,and levelled to a con¬ siderable distance by the hand of art. At f 2 intervals
intervals the huge dusky walls of the eon- vent were plainly perceptible by the lurid arid dahgerpUs flashes, which revealed thetri in all their pride of ahcient architec- ture-^-in all their sombre state and tower¬ ing majesty; until sinking again into one extended and iriiperietrable chaos, they became totally undiseernible. Ariaid this heart-appalling scene, Un¬ moved by its solemnity* and regardless of the torrents which descended on his unco¬ vered head, now glided a dark figure in a monastic habit* with ar thoughtful and melancholy pace, from a side door of the monastery; arid wrapping his mantle sullenly aroUnd him, entered a gloomy pathway which conducted to the graves of the departed^t was the monk Oban- • '- On his sudderi disappearance from the aisle, it will be remembered his low-whis¬ pered admonition had been overheard by the astonished Fernandez, the conviction i&y'lyr-- v ' ; ic ' l-'y '.'■"•■•••'- /v: '""---of.
of which eireumstance had causedH(Miand^ so extraordinarily to iquicken his paee; In his passage through the cloisters he en¬ countered Isabel* and ^ reached at length an obscure portal of the convent, which opened to the burying-ground, where the monks had permission to walk at any hour* as a relief from their devotional ex¬ ercises; and where, environed by half dilapidated tombstones, and mouldering relics of mortality, he now stalked, regard¬ less of the storm that beat around him, for the purpose of indulging in his gloomy ruminations. "Wretch, did she term me?" he thoughtfully exclaimed, as the words of Isabel recurred to his recollection; "daugh¬ ter of innocence! thou divinest not—thou canst not have divined half the extent of the internal anguish which consumes-^ the misery which oppresses me. Wretch, did she term me ?—lam a wretch indeed! and yet how little knew the delicate lips that deemed me so, crimsoned and glow- f3 ing

Well do they call me malecontent—'Well dp; they deem me miserable! for twice three years I have scarcely enjoyed a slum¬ ber that has not been rendered halcyon by :-: : yyy\ '..dreams;

Marco, my brother, thou too hast abandoned me: couldst thou behold thy brother in his wretchedness, then would thy heart's worst spleen be gratified; and surely better were it for Obando still to endure thy persecuting hate, than sink beneath the weight of a detested, because guilty and monotonous existence. Accursed be the hour I took the fatal vows! perhaps too, even at this very moment, Augustine with his dying breath betrays my guarded secret! Oh! let him not, ye powers invisible—of dark¬ ness or of glory, I care not where ye dwell—or good or evil, so ye but aid me now—oh! let him not confess, ye who have heard me oftener than I wished, if f5 ever

" Like an ethereal night, where long whire ciouds Streak the deep purple, and unnumber'd stars Spangle the wonderful and mysterious vault, With things that look as if they would be suns." Such was the object which now met the sight of the conscience-stricken and ap? palled Obando, who stood fixed to the spot with involuntary trepidation; while his eyes wandered alternately over the fiery form and terrific aspect of the inexplicable being before him. His shape was that of a monster—half brute, half serpent; his strangely-proportioned body—his shaggy, sparkling crest—his worse than the worst of human visages—bespoke him neither God, nor devil, nor angel, nor man; and yet with this horrible phantom did the monk Obando appear not wholly unac- F 6 quainted;
quainted; for although his very soul seem¬ ed pierced with agony, and every limb now quivered as if struck with a sudden palsy, on his countenance was depicted more of terror than astonishment at its unrequired appearance.

No sooner did the horror which, as before described, pervaded his whole frame to shuddering, in some degree subside, than the now doubly-furious Obando prepared to address, in a becoming and peremptory manner, his awfully-collected visitant, and request to be made acquainted with the cause of his presence. It was not, how¬ ever, until after a protracted struggle with the choking emotion of mingled rage and apprehension, which effectually deprived him
him of tiie po^ of utterance, that he succeeded in demanding his purpose; whicli finding himself at length able to efffect, the following verbal altercation took place betw^ri tiierii/ "Hal thing of darkness V* exclaimed the monk, in a voice of fury, " say what hath brought thee here ? w " Thy own wish*" readily returned the demon, in a shrill clear tone; " Unless thou hadst required my presence, I could not have stood before thee.

Obando here ceased speaking, and wrung his hands in a paroxysm of the bitterest dread and agony. "Thou art deceived, Obando," now re¬ turned the arch seducer^ already half tr> umph ant

Obando stood aghast at this third repe¬ tition of the proposed infernal league he had indeed with difficulty twice before rejected: the time too was awfully apt for acceding to such a proposition; the tempest raging violently—Augustine on his deathbed*—the monks in consternation* whispering strange conjectures of the cause,
cause, in which he knew the malecontent Was top often implicated: he shuddered, and exclaimed— . <f Fiend, or wiiatever thou art—-I know not what thou art, yet deem thee, oh, most evil!—to a proposi¬ tion, however artfully urged, of which the conditions are so horrible, Obando can have no other answer than such as he has already given thee.f I say again, there¬ fore, thou insidious monitor—avaunt! avoid my sight—thou art answered." "Beware," rejoined the demon, and as he spoke the convent clock struck two— "beware, Obando, how you reject my services a third time. Even at this in¬ stant, although thou knowest it not, the pallet of Augustine is surrounded by his kindred and his friends; the abbot stands amongst them—I see the holy cross up- lifted—they adjure him to confess—he speaks not yet; give me some token that thou wilt be mine, and receive the pledge of one whom holier powers permit not to use
use falsehood, that ere thou dost retprn unto thy cell, the deathbell shall inform thee his lips are sealed for ever." At this iriformatiori Obando hesitated, arid becanae^a was the couch of Augustine indeed surrounded by such potent intercessors; and were they indeed entreating hira tP disclose the horrid secret %hich* it was suspeeted* had long preyed upon his •iriifi6S-^arid ; -'so^e^ times driven him almost to frerizy? then what would shortly■'••fe'^tKe^'^r^feHecl Obando ? a prisoner to the Iriquisitiori at Barcelona—doomed to endure its torments -^-subjected to its merciless authority. He could not bear to think of it; but his thoughts recurred anon to the after state of torture which must follow his acquies¬ cence with the yellow spirit's proposal; he started, and again exclaimed—."

For Obando had striven in vain so far to forget the world and its temptations* as to become insen¬ sible to the charms of female beauty, or the almost equally powerful allurements of OUtward grandeur and parade: and to these unextinguished passions perhaps may justly be attributed that perpetual gloom
gloom and discontent, which had long characterized his demeanour, and distin¬ guished him from the rest of the brother¬ hood. He had also long aspired in se¬ cret to the office of superior, to which the fraternity had lately exalted Am¬ brose; but although their abbots had of late been frequently deposed, or sacri¬ ficed to the rage of the banditti, who held sway over them, there were still so many monks better beloved in the fra¬ ternity, that small chance remained to the despairing malecontent of accession to that honourable station. The volun¬ tary offer, therefore, of a boon so de¬ sirable, affected Obando extremely; and, perhaps more than any other considera¬ tion/staggered his resolves, and induced him to accept the yellow spirit's proposal: albeit the charms of the devoted Isabel, it must be confessed, had their share in his sudden conversion; as well as the dread he entertained of a discovery being made
made by the expiring Augustine, of the communion he had held with a monster so unholy.

therhood all hate the malecontent, and will never make me their superior.—To possess the beauteous maiden whom I saw at vespers, would be a happiness which it is not my destiny to enjoy." "Think not so lightly of my power," replied the spirit, rather haughtily; " thou shalt reign abbot over them, as surely as thou liyest. Augustine shall be silenced, and Isabel be thine." "Quick then, lest I repent," rejoined Obando, with an air of distracted resolu¬ tion in his manner—" quick then, lest I repent. It is but one desperate effort, and the worst is over! Obando shall reign abbot—Isabel be Obando's—and the dreaded, loathed Augustine, be consigned to the abode of worms. Spirit of ill, for such I know thou art, yet mean no longer to resist thy ordinances, direct me—I am thine; what shall I do ?" " Meet me again at midnight in the chancel," returned the yellow demon, after g 2 a brief
a hrief but solemn pause of deliberation -^" meet me again at midnight in the chancel, before thy holy shrine, which I neither can nor dare approach, nor even gaze upon, unless summoned thither by a member of thy blessed fraternity. There shall our covenant be completed; and yourself, Obando, learn more fully to ap¬ preciate and confide in my capability to increase your happiness. Before thy sa¬ cred altar, and at midnight, shall our com¬ pact be concluded " } -* f And why not here, and now?" de¬ manded Obando, sulkily. "Because I have already overstaid my hour," returned the spirit, coolly, "and because thy unexampled waywardness hath merited a more protracted ordeal. When the monks have retired from the chapel, vespers being concluded, remain thou near the chancel; and when thou art assured they have sought their cells, then .^then, Obando, tberi——" "Then
> " Then will I surely meet thee!" here hastily interrupted his troubled but deter¬ mined auditor. *' Swear thou wilt meet me!" cried the fiend, triumphantly; "swearit; and receive thou, in return, my promise to silence the accusing voice of one whose parting word might crush thee at once into a wretch—a tortured, guilty wretch—Augustine!" " I swear!" vociferated Obando, with violent emotion, it is true, but in a reso^ lute tone—" I swear to be punctual! But by what token shall I be assured that tliou, terrific being, wilt be equally observant of thy promise ?" To this the yellow spirit now solemnly replied:—-" I have already informed thee, dauntless Obando, that without an espe¬ cial summons from one of the brother¬ hood, I dare not (even invisibly) approach a place so sacred as thy blessed shrine, be¬ fore which the holy tapers are never suf¬ fered to expire, and the sanctified incense g 3 burns

Remember, monk, thou hast sworn—be it accomplished !** Ak the spirit concluded, the extreme brilliancy of the fiery scales becaihe per¬ ceptibly diminished, and his body again began to assume the appearance of a spreading flame, whose extremities were presently indistinct; arid which being, as it grew paler, gradually overpowered by eventually until it

Fernaridez had not long remained alone with Augustine, ere a feint trem¬ bling of his lips* in addition to the other symptoms already mentioned, indicated that he was about to speak ; and that the kirid of dread which had heretofore re¬ strained him, grew weaker as he became more perfectly assured that they were without witnesses. Accordingly, after once or twice rolling his languid eyes wildly round the apartment, and then fixing them again upon the visage of his afflicted son, he suddenly broke the si¬ lence which hitherto the growling of the tempest had alone interrupted, and ad¬ dressed him as follows:—"My son!" he exclaimed, in a voice broken by exces- g 4 sive

He, however, be¬ sought his sire, with much humility, to compose himself, and then to explain more fully the particular circumstance to which he alluded; and conjecturing now (as well indeed he might) that the conscience of Velasquez was troubled with the recollection of some heinous crime, failed not to remind him ofthe promised salvation, through the grace of the Re¬ deemer, as well as of the undisputed in¬ fluence of the saint to whose service he had voluntarily devoted the latter portion of his existence. These consoling sugges¬ tions, however, appeared to have but little weight with the despairing object before him, but rather seemed to increase his agonies, which Fenandez observing, de- g 5 termined

CHAPTER XII. An oath, au oatht—I have an oath in heaven! Slall I lay perjury upon my soul ? Shakespeare. At length Augustine, having again re¬ covered himself sufficiently to resume, feebly grasped the hand of his attentive auditor, and thus continued his singular disclosure.—" Alas! Fernandez," he now added, in return for his religious consola¬ tions, " it is that very knowledge of our saint's commanding influence (strange as it must appear to you) that most depres¬ ses me—drives me to desperation, and stretches me thus early on a deathbed. Brief as has been my sojourn in her holy g6 sanctuary^
sanctuary, I have seen its walls polluted —witnessed its cloisters defiled with hel¬ lish intercourse-—arid, worse than all, have sworn to bury in eternal secrecy what I ought to have instantly divulged to our superior. Talk not of voluntary service : my devotion is but mockery—-my wor¬ ship is mere hypocrisy, and will not be, accepted. I am an outcast—-hopeless- lost—abandoned: but what is he who made me so? He, the foul worshipper —he, the malecontent—I shudder wheri I think upon his destiny ! But my oath, my oath! It was a solemn one. I must revere my oath!" The listening Fernandez was now again struck with amazement at this involun¬ tary mention of the malecontent, and he hastily exclaimed—"Oh Heaven! if thou hast aught to do with that terrific being, whose muttered caution reached my asto¬ nished ear as we passed through yonder gaUery-r-if tbpu art in aught connected with
with that man of my stety and terror, fly to absolve, retrieve^~--' ? "Ah, thou didst hear it then!" inter¬ rupted Augustine, suddenly—"thou didst hear that awfol admonition, breathed so often in my sickening ears, by him whose interest it may well be deemed to guard me against perjury!—-thou knowest, then, that there exists between us a deadly se¬ cret—a fatal promise too—wrung from me unawares, and in an evil hour!—but I am in¬ nocent of the horrid transgression to which 1 became an involuntary witness — that guilt is all his own—so let him answer it! I sought not what I saw—I partook not of their horrible communionr-but fled from what I loathed, yet fled too late. See—be appears again! that worse than monster—that yellow, pestilent adviser— that breathing compoi?jjid of all hideous- ness! Oh, save me from his glance !—it curdles—chills me! save me, Fernandez t save—" Here
Efere his exclamations ^0^-^)^&'.'. rageous, that Fernandez was fain to sooth and pacify him again in the best manner he was able. He spoke to him* therefore, of absolutions granted by the abbot to de- linquents—of requiems, to be sung or said for the souls of the departed—and, above all* of erecting a holy edifice to his memo¬ ry* and thus sacrificing a by no means in^ considerable portion of the remaining es¬ tate to the washing away of his sins. All tiiisv however, was insufficient to assure tiie wretched and despairing monk of his final exemption from the destiny of the damned, whether he kept or violated his injudicious oath. In this state he continued, until wearied out with his own incoherent ravings of perdition; and of purgatory/ his voice grew weak, his aspect became more ghast¬ ly; and his frame sunk strengthless and exhausted on his pillow, as if unable any longer to contend with the overpowering violence
violence cf his foelirigs. Animation was now evidently drawirig towards a close— his soul seemed trembling on the verge of eternity. Fernandez, in his alarm* forgot the bell, of which the father abbot had spoken* but called out, however, lustily for assistance; which summons, notwithstanding its vehe* menee, the elders of the convent either could not, or did not choose to hear. His voice, nevertheless—his well-remembered voice, albeit it awakened not the brother¬ hood, failed not once more to arouse the fleeting faculties of Velasquez, and induced him again to open his dim desponding eyes; he gazed dejectedly, for an instant, upon the graceful figure of his kneeling son, and then mournfully articulated, in broken words, the following scraps of intelligence —"Fernandez! oh, Fernandez! thy fa¬ ther falls the victim of—yon haggard monk, Obando! he, he it was whose mut¬ tered warning met thine astonished ear, as we
we passed through the corridor!— -He falls the dupe of a designing fiend^-and J the victim of a fatal curiosity !—Bless thee, boy!—may Heaven accord thee length of days with Isabel!—Say to De Gracy that I freely pardon him, and trust he will sanc¬ tion your happiness, when I am in the grave.—It was a dreadful night," he add¬ ed, faintly, in a half-delirious and uncon¬ nected strain; "it was a dreadful night- much like the present; the thunder echo¬ ed awfully through the cloister-a yellow shape of horror—I saw it clearly, and the hideous recollection has preyed upon my memory ever since ! that scaled and fiery aspect—the malecontent Obando—I ob¬ served him-—mark, my son—observe Oban¬ do— observe——" A cold, damp shiver¬ ing now seized and shook his debilitated frame in an alarming manner—his accents became unintelligible—a ghastly change succeeded-r-and his soul took its flight to the regions of eternity. At
At this fatal moment the distracted youth, recollecting suddenly the neglected admonition of Ariibrose, burst open the door of the cell, and flew to the little bell at the extremity of the dormitory, which he now rang violently. In an instant the pallet of the departed Augustine was surrounded by an anxious group, among whom the astonished Fer¬ nandez, to his utter consternation, disco¬ vered the faces of Alfieri de Gracy and several of his principal domestics, who guessing, by means of the information al¬ ready obtained from Isabel, the cause of the present alarm, had hastened to witness the expiring moments of 'Velasquez de Leon; and it might be, to exchange for¬ giveness with the father of him whom now (should such an unexpected issue of their animosity take place) Alfieri secretly determined to accept as a husband for his dearly-cherished daughter, an union of his own domain with that of De Leon hav-
around thP corpse, when the clock of the convent pealed the hour of two. By this account* it will be seett that the yellow spirit spoke more of truth than falsehood to Obando* when he informed him how the couch of Augustine was sur¬ rounded at that moinerit; yet was Oban¬ do (inasmuch as he omitted to mention the fatal change which had taken place in Augustine himself)grievously deceived by what he uttered. Meanwhile, the scene which followed in the cell of the departed monk may be summarily described in a few words. While the abbot was engaged in giving orders that the great bell of the monastery might be duly tolled for the decease of one of the holy brotherhood* Alfieri de Gracy was occupied in attracting the re¬ gard of Fernandez, for the purpose of ad¬ dressing him on the subject of his own pa¬ ternal feelings respecting the rash step he had taken, and Isabel's elopement. As soon,
ing beeni^^fet;- :hi : vhad : : formerly desired, and previous to their unfortunate quarrel would have given much to have seen ac¬ complished. The good abbot also, forget¬ ful a second time of his dignity in the en¬ deavour to be of service, pressed forward among the crowd towards the lifeless mass of day which once was Augustine; and finding that his spirit had already taken his final departure, lamented over him with the rest of the fraternity, of whom some of the most devout had already be¬ gun to count their rosaries for his happy journey. During this period, Fernandez, whose attention to the sudden appearance of De Gracy and his train was only momentary, appeared indeed deeply affected; he even wept aloud* as he thought upon the un¬ finished confession and ambiguous injunc¬ tion of his father. Alfieri drew nearer to the body of his deceased enemy. Am¬ brose and the rest were still gathered around
soon, there^re, as the youths affectionate anguish had somewhat subsided* he drew him gently aside, and reproached him sig- nificanitiy with having endeavoured to ruin hisr -, happiness, by deprivi^^ child. ; , /.;.' -. , To this Fe^ by requesting Alfieri to spare him the vindi¬ cation of his conduct until the morning, assuring him it could be easily justified ; and, in the courseof his answer, desiring, in the presence of her father at least, to speak with Isabel; as a further recom¬ mendation, moreover, to the favour of the justly-incensed sire, he related faith¬ fullythe^^ friendly and conciliatory man¬ ner in which he had j ust before been spoken of by the penitent and humbled Augustine. . Alfieri de Gracy seemed considerably moved by the recital /agreed coldly, at the youth's solicitation, to defer the eclair- cissement until the morning; informed him ■■/ 'that
that Isabel had retired to her apartment for the night, but hinted that a conference on the morrow would not be objected to; and, finally, gave him leave to hope, that after the solemn interment of Augustine, which they knew would take place on the succeeding day, matters would be adjust¬ ed to his perfect satisfaction. The storm had now considerably aba¬ ted, and the swarm of monks, who had arisen hastily from their pallets, for the purpose of witnessing the final departure of a fellow-creature for eternity, began speedily to think of retiring again to re¬ pose. Fernandez, however, requested permission to watch during the night by the corpse of his deceased father, and this privilege was readily granted him by the superior, who deemed his request of such a mournful indulgence, an additional proof of his devotional habits and filial piety. Shortly after Ambrose dismissed the bro¬ therhood to their several cells, and fervent-
ly commending the afflicted youth to the favour and protection of Hejayen* With¬ drew to his own apartment* t^ him his riewry^amved guest, Alfieri de Gracy ; arid leaving behind lum a lively impression of his alniable qujalities, whic^ Fernandez felt neither change nor circum¬ stance could ever obliterate or extinguish in his bosom. No sooner had the receding steps of the superior and his companion died away in the distance, than the sorrowing Fernan¬ dez again betook himself to his humble posture, and poured forth his full soul in mingled prayers and lamentations, breathed for and over the body of him, to whose converse and society he had now bidden adieu for ever. Nor did he arise froni his pious attitude, until the grey light of morning, streaming through thebnajTow, grated lattice, dimmed his pale lamp, and intimated the approach of sunrise; while the Ml rung out for matins,
matins, and the monks were heard, in every direction, hurrying through the cloisters.

And a God whom bis fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and plea¬ sant things. Daniel, chap. xi. verse 38. Fernandez de Leon lingered in the cell of death, until the soft warm sunbeam fully disclosed the wretchedness of the apartment, and played, as if in mockery, over the distorted features of him to whom its radiance could impart life and vivacity no more. That sun saw many important and interesting affairs transacted (as will hereafter be recounted to the reader) du¬ ring his course that day, within the pre¬ cincts of the monastery of Montserrat; among
among which, however, must here be mentioned the committal to its kindred earth of the form of one of its deceased supporters —■ brother Augustine. His body was interred thus early, chiefly on account of his singular conduct—-inas¬ much as he died not in the full odour of sanctity; and although not actually cul¬ pable of any acknowledged offence, had long persisted in denying the efficacy of the holy unction to preserve his immor¬ tal spirit from everlasting perdition—an enigmatical kind of behaviour which the fraternity had veiy little relished. This, and several other transactions of a much more agreeable kind, had the bright orb of day witnessed in his unclouded course over our lady's sanctuary at Montserrat (as the peasantry usually denominated it), through regions of unblemished azure, from which every trace of the dreadful convulsion Of nature that agitated them on the preceding night had totally dis- vol. i. h appeared;
appeared; but now had the sultry Phoe¬ bus long since adorned the golden west with his departing radiance, and left that portion of the world to the mild lustre of a tender sphere, which although not equally magnificent, was far from ap¬ pearing less adorable than his own. It was past midnight; vespers were concluded, and the monks had slowly re¬ tired in order to their cells. The moon was shining brightly through the case¬ ment, and so powerful was Cynthia*s lus* tre on that eventful night, that even the innumerable lamps scattered over the eastern extremity of the chapel, strove vainly to eclipse her mellow radiance; and as it penetrated into the dusky re¬ cesses of many an obscure and shadowy cloister, * The silver light, so pale and faint, Shewed many a prophet and many a saint, Whose image on the glass was dy'd j Full
Full in the midst, his cross of red Triumphant Michael brandished, And trampled the apostate's pride;" while the tapers that burned incessantly before the holy shrine, shed a light so dim and insufficient, that the remoter parts of the edifice were, but for the en¬ livening moonshine which occasionally chequered the lofty pillars, involved in almost total obscurity; as wrapped in me¬ ditation, with gloom and anger depicted on his countenance, Obando paraded the western side of the chapel, half concealed amid the shadows of gigantic columns, and grey colossal shapes of stone, that seemed ready to awaken into life by the dull streaming of the distant lights that revealed them; although, on closer in¬ spection, and by a stronger light, the workmanship of these unwieldy statues was not so inimitable as to warrant such an apprehension. Of these, however, Obando thought not—his thoughts were h2 bent
bent upon the coming interview, and he listened eagerly to the closing of doors still indistinctly heard in the distant dor¬ mitory, that as soon as the monks had entered their cells, he might venture forth, and, secure from interruption, bold¬ ly prosecute his unhallowed purpose. At length he advanced towards the chancel; he listened again anxiously—all was silent as the grave in which he had that day seen deposited the corpse of his greatest enemy—the man upon whose breath his very life had heretofore de¬ pended. Then softly approaching the steps of the altar, with an aspect of rage and impatience, yet softened in some de¬ gree by an air of evident timidity which he strove vainly to disguise, the fallen Obando exclaimed, in a somewhat stern, but smothered tone—" Zatanai!—Zata- nai! M After the deluded monk had thus, for the first time, pronounced the concerted signal,
signal, he remained motionless for some seconds in an attitude of fixed attention and intense anxiety. Brief, however, was the pause which followed; the yellow flame seemed pre¬ sently self-kindled as before, betwixt him and the holy shrine at which he ought to have bowed in supplication, and from which he would then have departed with hope. It gradually waxed brighter, and not only illumined the chancel, or eastern part of the chapel, where the altar was situated, but even extended its brilliance to the western extremities thereof, hither¬ to, as already observed, shrouded in par¬ tial obscurity. To be brief, its beams presently appeared to concentrate into a solid mass of fire, clothed in transparent scales, and the demon again stood before him; the same hideous, yet beautifully luminous appearance, characterized his aspect, and he spoke in the same shrill tone as follows: — " Valiant Obando, h 3 thanks,"
thanks," he began by exclaiming, with a truly demoniac smile of triumph on his countenance-—" thanks for this proof* of thy devotion to Zatanai, and courage in his service! for which, if persevered in, thou shalt assuredly be ranked among the highest of his followers—the proudest and the wealthiest Of the worshippers of Za¬ tanai, each of whom is usually proud or wealthy in proportion to the length they have ventured in obeying his precepts, or adopting his advice. Thus far in courte¬ sy unto thee, as the proselyte of my choice; now I address thee as the cloister¬ ed wretch—the complaining malecontent, who seeks, and long hath sought (in thine own heart thou knowest it), an opportu¬ nity of amending his condition, by such means as I alone have the power or the wish to render prosperous. Having been hither summoned by thy voice, for which again I thank thee, thou thrice-daring mortal, I am constrained to ask thee, be¬ fore
fore we parley further, what thou de- mandest of me? and wherefore thou hast, at this lone, dismal hour, required my presence in this holy place ? Speak—an¬ swer me, Obando! on thy promised alle¬ giance answer me!" "Oh, spirit Of guile—monster of per¬ fidy!" returned Obando, with real or af¬ fected shuddering—" thou horrible crea¬ tion of my own vile thoughts, which have conjured thee from darkness, to be in¬ vested with a power to beguile me thus! Zatanai, thou hast deceived me. But wherefore should I acquaint thee with thy perfidy ? thou knowest thou hast already bitterly deceived me. Thou knowest that even at the moment I bade thee deliver me from the power of Augustine, that his dying confessions might not hurt my fame, the danger I dreaded had long ceas¬ ed to exist—-Augustine had expired!" A solemn pause ensiled; the aspect of the demon betrayed neither surprise nor h 4 ' concern,
concern, and Obando resumed—" It was a damned artifice—-a subtle fraud, worthy alone of such a hell-sprung beirig, to tre¬ pan me into the utterance of an oath I had else abhorred, and scorned, as hereto¬ fore, to take. Enough—I have reviled thee for thy treachery—-my heart panted for the opportunity, and has enjoyed it. Now, if thou art indeed the creature of my thoughts^- my wishes, since these alone, thou sayest, have hitherto em¬ powered thee to appear before me, depart thou instantly, and let our separation be eternal. I think riot of thee—wish not for thee: quit me, and never see me more!";.' Another pause succeeded, and the de¬ mon spoke.—" Obando," he exclaimed, " thou hast not answered me! the place is holy—the night far gone; we have no time to trifle with each other. If thou art disposed to become mine, and well I know thy yet uncurbed desires are eager for
for the minute %hictvsha^^ say* wherefore Ipst thou suhamoriedpe| and for what purpose dos my presence here ? Are all thy hopes of splendour and supremacy buried in the grave of Augustine ? Have the charms of Isabel faded in thy sight?—or have they not rather increased tenfold in thine estimation?" Obando appeared for an instant thun¬ derstruck at the unexpected termination of this speech: how the spirit should have thus divined his feelings with regard to the beauteous Isabel, appeared to him a mystery perfectly unfathomable; and an additional proof, if any such were want¬ ing* of the speaker's extraordinary ubi¬ quity and power. Atlength, after a few minutes, apparently spent in musing, he seemed to recover the use of his astonish¬ ed faculties, and sullenly responded, in a voice of agony—" Oh, what a thought hast thou awakened!" said he, casting a h5 reproachful

H 6 It
It would be needless, and unentertain* ing prolixity* to relate verbally all that passed upon that fatal night, between the monk Obando and the mysterious yellow phantom of the cloister. Suffice it there- fore to say briefly, that Zatanai persuaded, and Obando was overcome. At first he shewed considerable reluctance to ac¬ quiesce in the slightest degree with the proposals made to him; but when the fiend began glowingly to expatiate on the pleasures of supremacy and the beau¬ ties of Isabel, the resolution of his audi¬ tor vanished gradually, like snow be¬ neath the dissolving sunbeam. He start- edS# shuddered: the demon proffore4 every thing: he confessed himself un¬ happy,and resolved finally to risk the horrible experiment of an infernal league, made too with one who had already de¬ ceived him. Once, on observing him thus waver, Zatanai rejoined—" Thou shalt command my services, Obando, du¬ ring
ririg thy existence—thy desires shallall be gratified: to render their gratification pro* ductive of thy perfect felicity* is, however, what I cannot undertake to perform; triy power is great, but riot unlimited. Am knowiedged as my superior in this world " And thy victim in the next!" mut¬ tered Obando; " but be it so—it is my wretched fate! I can no longer struggle with ray untoward destiny." "There is yet another circumstance af¬ fecting thee, Obando," again rejoined the tempter, somewhat sullenly* " which I may not conceal entirely from thy know¬ ledge ; nor am, on the other hand* permit¬ ted wholly to divulge. It is this : how¬ ever solemnly cemented may have been* our covenant—however willingly it may have been made, or steadily adhered to, there will ever be one possible occurrence, one only which can at any period release thee from my power, and dissolve our ter¬ rible
rible compact into nought.

But to the point at once: tell me, Obando, hast thou, during thy whole earthly pilgrimage, or the long period of thy devotion to that religion which I dare not even name, once tasted of felicity ?" >m No-**tiever!" replied Obando, with vehemence; " never has my soul been calm!—uot even at Jerusalem* during my saafed worship, before thy first appalling visit to me; nor afterwards in holy land -^norhere, has my mind known tranquil¬ lity, or ceased to sigh for indulgences I could not hope to obtain, and ought to have despised! therefore did I (to avoid the

'/■■"'■ Obando riOW prostrated hitriself beforfe the shining fierid, whose terrible aspect brightened palpably as the ceremony pro^ ceeded. He had not knelt long, ere the demon desired him tP loosen the sinall crucifix which depended frorivhis^ girdfe, and
and fetaxiy that^ niitii, by dashin^^ agairist the pavement, at the foot of the shrine. This mandate Obando shudderingly obeyed* and flinging it with desperate force upon the ground, broke it in an in- starit into a thousand pieces, which flew clattering as tif reproachfully around him. The fragments* however, vanished pre¬ sently, and the smallest atom of the shi¬ vered symbol of Ghristianity was no¬ where to be seen; but what surprised him yet more than even this unaccountable circumstance, was his appalling discovery, that, where the crucifix had smitten the marble pavement of the chancel, there re¬ mained distinctly the figure of a cross, which seemed, by some invisible agency, to have been newly tracedin blood!—the horror of Obando was indescribable, at this terrible conviction, yet he resolved not to retract, and he accordingly finished his adoration, by bowing his forehead to the
the dust, in outward humility, and form of reverence Not a word was spoken during this ap¬ palling ceremony; the demon, at its con¬ clusion, laughed triumphantly—thelights upon the altar, thus daringly profaned, burned for a moment of a sickly blue— the wide, sulphureously-illumined aisles resounded with strange noisesj— « W hile through the cloister-galleries small.

After gazing vacantly for some time- first upon the awM memento of his infa¬ my, arid then upon the laughing fiend be¬ side
side him, the latter spoke, in a loud and hurried voice of exultation, to the follow¬ ing purport:—" Enough—thou art mine!" he exclaimed, triumphantly; " thou art mine—-thou ait mine, Obando, and for ever! Behold yon indelible memento of our union!" he added, now pointing to the empurpled cross; "pale and invisible shall it grow before the sunrise; but ever at this hour shall it appear as now, nor will it fade again until thou hast knelt down to worship me. And now the time is waxing brief which I maybe permitted to;spend with thee: mark me, Obando, therefore—do my bidding, and be si- lent!*' " I hear thee, thou dread being!" cried Obando, as if impatient for the event, and apprehensive of the consequences of their protracted interview; " say on—I hear thee!" f Retire then to thy cell," returned the demon ; ** to-morrow night, at this hour, " having
having worshipped as I bade thee, on which yon symbol of the faith thou hast abjured shall fade to the resemblance of untainted marble, repair thou speedily to the pool of blood, as it is falsely termed— pretended by thy brethren to have arisen spontaneously upon that fatal spot, albeit their fears have long informed them other* wise, and assured them it is only a scheme of the banditti, to deter succeeding abbots from treading in the steps of their precur¬ sor — to-morrow night, Obando, while those who might prevent thee are sleep¬ ing, steal thou fearlessly thither—it is Za¬ tanai commands thee!" " And for what purpose?" now hastily demanded Obando, with some show of displeasure at the prolixity of the demon. " Zatanai, thou hast promised that my wildest desires shall be gratified; I will not believe thou wilt violate thy covenant, dearly as I have purchased thy assistance; learn, therefore, now to comprehend them. —I would
—I would rule abbot here—which prefer^ ment thou unasked didst proffer to my acceptance: I would behold again my bro¬ ther Mar^, and endeavour to conciliate his regard; this, if he be still living, is npt impossible unto thee; I would enjoy the blooming Isahel, in spite of plighted vows and vigilant defenders; this too thou hast avouched shall be accorded me. Then wherefore dost thou defer the eonsumma- tion of my hopes^ and avert the hour of my felicity?" ^ And wherefore, monk," said the de¬ mon* calmly* "this needless explanation of thy wishes ?—thinkest thou thine in¬ nermost desires can be now concealed fromZatanai, to whom thy heart was vi* sible, even ere thy lips were opened? for the rest* Obando—I seek not to avert the consummation of thy happinps* as thou shalt surely findV provided thou dost nei¬ ther scorn noriear to foliow my directions. Thou lenowest to-morrow is the festival ':of
v of an enshrined saint* whose blessed appel- latiou (iiuttered inad lips like mine) would, likea sudden earthy quake, arouse each drowsy mmate;Of thy peaceful dormitory*— Speak!—is ; it not, Obando?" - "I think it is the feast of St Sebas¬ tian," said Obando, sullenly, whose de¬ meanour still exhibited some symptoms of apprehension and impatience. " It is," returned the demon; " now mark what I advise. To-morrow eve, as I commanded thee, having first repeated thy nocturnal homage, repair thou daunt* lessly to the bloody pool; there shalt thou encounter the much-dreaded Boidan - ■ Start not, nor gaze upon me thus appalled —-he will not harm thee; there shalt thou meet him. Hark!—the clock strikes again, and warns us now to separate —the cross too has almost vanished, and its appearance must limit the duration of our intercourse. Obandp, thou hast never
neyer tasted happiness—exert thy facul* ties, and obtain it now—thy wishes shall ^he'lfi^ ' j " How?— j ly demanded the petulant Obando. ! " By an interview with Roldan," repli- j ed the yellow spirit, in an impressive tone; "fear not to follow the course prescribed [ for thee by Zatanai; remember the bloody pool—remember, and be punctual!" The massy bell of the monastery, now dismally echoing through the deserted aisles and cloisters, had indeed announced the hour at which Obando knew the day I would break, and the time appointed for ! morning vespers was not far distant. The crucifix, moreover, had faded until it was almost imperceptible; and now, \ while yet the earnest gaze of Obando was | fixed thereon, it totally disappeared. The | monk lifted his wondering eyes towards | the spot, where just before had stood the deceiving spirit—but Zatanai had disap¬ peared
peared also; the latest beam of his dis¬ solving radiance yet shone upon the car¬ ved pillars of the chancel—it flickered, and he was "gone.', : -V; Obando stood for^selleral minutes mo¬ tionless, still gazing on the vacant space his fell adviser had so lately quitted: pre¬ sently he felt his exhausted strength re¬ cede—his sight grew suddenly darkened —his brain swam giddily—he knew that he was sinking to the pavement—an over¬ powering faintness succeeded, and he knew no more.

The convent bells are ringing, But monrnifiiliy and slow ; In the grey square turret swinging, With a deep siftind, ta and fro. Heavily to the heart they go; Byron*
Tis she, that rohber's lovely bride^ De Wilue. " Ho, Pedro!" roared a huge-whiskered ruffian, who seemed to have j ust awa¬ kened from his sleep, " thou drowsy, lop-eared knave! thou hast been slumber¬ ing on thy post again; a pestilence con¬ sume thee for thy negligence!—Sirrah! hast seen our captain ?" Pedro, who was in reality pacing to and
and fro very o^ took nWnotiee of that portion of this ad- dress which charged him with having slumbered, on his watch, inasmuch as he knew it to bethel custom of his worthy lieutenant to charge boldly upon his com¬ rades whatever had been done amiss by himself. Aroused, however, from his re¬ verie, by the hasty interrogatory which followed, he, as snappishly as he dared, replied—"A murrain light on him!" he hoarsely articulated, in a voice almost as terrifying as that of his interrogator; "were he aught save our captain, I should be apt to^-----But he is our captain, so let us say no more about his faults. I have not seen him." "True; and a noble captain we have found him!" rejoined the former speaker carelessly, whose habitual surliness seem* ed somewhat abated, on finding that his nap had passed unnoticed, as he now con¬ jectured must have been the case. 1 2 This
This abrupt dialogue passed hastily be¬ fore the rugged entrance of a romantic cavern* surmounted by an ancient builds ing, in the form of a castie, considerably decayed, and situated ou orie of the rocky eminences which overhung the convent of Montserrat. The scene was wild and picturesque in the extreme; the fall moon was shining in the clear blue fir¬ mament, which alone canopied the heads of those belonging to the horde of ban¬ ditti whose turn it was to be on guard that night, the succeeding eve to that on which Obando had undergone his last de* scribed interview with the yellow demon. Among the other sentinels stationed nightly by the banditti of Montserrat, were two whose ofiice was to watch the priyate retreat, or residence, of their leader, whenever he chose (which hap¬ pened not unfrequently) to seclude him¬ self from the society and observation of his companions* These sentinels, on the
night alluded to, happened to be Sebas. tian, who had long heeri 4^ the title of iieutenarit^ although scarcely superior in vaipur or intellect to the meanest of those whom he coniiriande and Pedro, one of the most sturdy and ferocious of his inhuman cenfederates. The worthy lieutenant, however, pro¬ moted (fipldan alone knew why) to this unmerited distinction, seldom conde¬ scended to watch at all, save on particu¬ lar occasions like the present; and even now, while indolently stretched along the ground, had been overtaken by an ill-timed slumber, which, had justice been administered, ought sans donte to have deprived hini of his office: not so his companion Pedro; his wonted thirst for enterprise had kept him awake, while the expectation of a jovial supper (of which the robbers were accustomed to partake about the hour of sunrise) had induced him to parade before the cave 13 almost

What knowest thou about our captain's secrets? That brother whom thou speakest of would be as heartily re¬ joiced to discover Roldan as Roldan to find him. But, peace, thou driveller- peace! I hear his footstep approach- In this supposition, however, the sa¬ gacious lieutenant was deceived; for after some moments passed in anxious listen¬ ing, the footstep which his ear had first distinguished proved to be only that of a female, who now, with a slow and pen¬ sive gait, emerged from the dusky cave, 14 illumined
illumined only by a single lamp, at the entrance of which they were conversing. * The figure of this female was tall* and rather masculine, her step majestic, and her whole demeanour bespoke superior breeding; but age had done its work upon her countenance, which, neverthe¬ less, it was evident had formerly been handsome. In her hand she carried a few withered branches, the remains of a fagot she had that night consumed in cooking their victuals, which menial of¬ fice it was Corvetta's principal duty to perform: yet this dejected, wretched- looking female, was still called by the members of the banditti their captain's bride, because Roldan had formerly shewn her some slight degree of fevour^ after ravishing her^person, and forcing her from her kindred, to become the unwilling ob¬ ject ofhis lawless love. No sooner did Sebastian and his eager companion discover their mistake, than guessing

" Corvetta!" both eagerly exclaimed, intercepting her descent to the culinary apartment of the horde, ** will our captain share the feast to-night ?" The majestic female looked contemptu¬ ously on each of the querists, but made no answer. ^Charming X^orvetta!" presently re¬ sumed the foremost of her interrogators, Pedro, " tell us if it be only probable ? Thou wilt not? Well," he continued, while his aspect resumed its former ex¬ pression of moroseness, "all men have their antipathies: I hate a poltroon and an idler." i5 "Take * ■ ■
" Take heed/V now exclaimed the dig* nified C^vetta^-r" take heed, lest your captain should chance to overhear you. Roldan is not a poltroon nor anidler: but I like riot either of ye; so fairer speech, good senors, and merrier looks be yours, than aye Corvetta will bestow upon ye." So saying, and waving them aside haughtily with her ban4 she was pre¬ paring to proceed, when Sebastian, in¬ censed at being denied the information be required, again detained her.—" How got you in, foul witch?" he now de- manded; then lowering his voice, mut¬ tered to Pedro—" She must have passed our place of watch, that is certain." " How got I in f- returned Corvetta, with a loud laugh at his perplexity; "by that which will one day get thee out—I mean of Roldan's favour—thy want of vigilance and caution. Thou trusty war r der, thou, who art ever preaching cou¬ rage
rage to the undaunted swordsman, and watchfulness to the wary sentinel; by thine immortal namesake, whose festival they are celebrating yonder," and she . pointed downward to the monastery as she spoke, "I could have struck my dag¬ ger into thee, Sebastian, when I heard thee snore so loudly." Sebastian hung his head, abashed at this welkmerited reproof from one whom he so much despised: the saint invoked too, whose name he was himself proud of invoking in proof of his own prudence, heroism, and consequent fitness for the post assigned him ! it was not to be borne; but he wisely determined to re¬ sent it, by requiting Corvetta for her boldness on some more convenient occa¬ sion. " But silence—no reply!" the latter added, surveying him askance, and pro¬ bably guessing his determination;" here comes one, who, if aware of thy negli- i 6 gence
gence and hypocrisy w^ in a mode better suited to thy crimes." And as Corvetta ceased, she slowly walk¬ ed aside a few paces* as if now provoking¬ ly determined not to leave them till her revenge was gratified. At this moment the sound of an ap¬ proaching footstep again was heard pro¬ ceeding from the cave (which was iri rea¬ lity no other than a subterranean passage to the fortress above), whereupon Pedro suddenly strove to appear indifferently occupied in examining his weapons; and Sebastian, the indolent lieutenant, al¬ though smarting successively with rage and fear, hastily assumed a respectful at¬ titude, in expectation of the arrival of their chief. Presently a stately figure, with a pre¬ possessing countenance, whose whole de¬ meanour evidently bespoke authority, is¬ sued from the cavern; clad in a dark ha¬ bit, which much resembled that of a Spa¬ nish
riish soldier, although much worn and de¬ faced. He wore pistols at his girdle, and a hanger by his side; but that which at once denoted this commanding personage to be no other than the terrific Roldan, was a single long yellow feather* which alone adorned his hat, of the same colour, and partially shaded his handsome coun¬ tenance. This hat, with its ornamental appendages, it was said by the surround¬ ing peasantry, and even by several of the monks themselves, whose credulity was easily worked upon, Roldan had particu¬ lar private reasons for never laying aside; inasmuch as they knew that a familiar of the evil one, said to be of the same re¬ markable colour, had long been reported to infest the cloisters of the monastery, for the purpose of seducing its peaceful in¬ habitants from their fealty to the holy saint they worshipped; and hence, as maybe imagined, arose Geronimo's be¬ lief of - f Roldan's mysterious connexion with
with some evil power, communicated to ihe gppe^ua^ ^ mencement of our narrative, In addition to the accoutrements already described, he wore a pair of yellow buskins, and a kind Pf militaary (oiy according; to the vulgar superatiti of d«no™«5) distinction^ his breast; beneath the dark green man- tie, moreover* which depended gracefully from his left shoulder, the hilt of a small stiletto was also visiblei His gait was firm, arid his deportment haughty, al¬ though his countenance was agitated; after a tnument pause^ of silence, he turn- ed abruptly to Sebastian, and addressed him in a pensive, although firm voicev— "What fe tiie hour?" he haughtily de- manded; to which the deep sound of the convent bell, striking twelve, far beneath tbem, and to which Sebastian now signi¬ ficantly pointed, was a sufficient answer. Roldan paused again, until he had de¬ liberately counted the strokes, and then continued

Meanwhile the stern majestic Roldan* while Gomez and his prisoner were as^ cending the steep mountain, to his oelp^ vated station* turned sullenly aside,ifbr the purpose of indulging ario^er mio- ment in his gloomy ruminations, and stood upon the brink of the tremendous precipice, listening apparently to the loud tinkling ofthe convent hell beneath, which announced the hour of vespers. Sebastian (who was in reality the only confidant of his chief's secret afiliction* and hence the preferences he usually ob¬ tained) would fain have expostulated with him on the folly of giving way to feelings of regret, which time ought to have era¬ dicated, had not the presence of Pedro and Corvetta (who remained still stand- ing at a little distance), together with the consciousness of having already twice of¬ fended, prevented him. And now the heavy clank of approaching chains was heard, which sound proclaimed the ap¬ proach
proach of Gomez with his captive. Pre¬ sently they reaohed the summit; and the gaoler (Gomes) placing his prisoner rudely before the captain, doffed his slouched hat with an air of awkward reverence, and si¬ lently awaited the result "What is your name ?" demanded Roldan, addressing the chained and timid- looking object who stood in dismay before him. " Carlossa T was the unhesitating re¬ ply. " What art thoii?-^-and whither wert thou bound, when my companions seized thee?" again demanded the imperious Rol¬ dan. y ■ u A served muleteer," replied the shrinking Carlossa, whom the reader must have already recognised to be an old ac¬ quaintance* " and on my way to the vil¬ lage of Montrosol—from the monastery of Montserrat, whither I had conducted two females and a cavalier-- who, I thank Heaven, are safe." "Why
*f Why dost thou thank Heaven ?'' here inquired the ^ sneering tone-^" why dost tiiou thank Heaven for a deUverance in which thysetf had no share?" "Because he was : --i^iinG^;&>ymQtik and too high spirited to endure with re¬ signation so base a doom as mine!" re¬ turned Carlossa, shewing his chains as he spoke, and pointing significantly to his forehead (where indeed there were some ugly marks), as alluding to the violence with which, on being captured, they had forced him to their elevated abode* " How knowest thou he was noble?" said Roldan, with evident signs of emo¬ tion. "He paid me nobly for my services," replied the dejected muleteer. "And what didst thou with the mo¬ ney ?" hastily demanded his fierce gaoler, Gomez, advancing towards him with a threatening aspect, and laying rude hold
of his garments* which he'.nearly rent, in endeavouring to search for the pieces he now supposed him to have cunningly con- cealed^ ; ^w ** Ay, what hast thou done with the money ?" reiterated Pedro, seizing him also by the shoulders, and shaking him so violently as to deprive the poor 'mule-' i/^-^'^^i^ih4-'^:'^ took from thee only a few pieces —not enough to pay for the trouble of dragging thy vile car¬ case hither; we must have the remain- der—so surrender it on the instant, and be wise.- ^ ^ The poor Carlossa, whose strength was altogether insufficient to cope with his two powerful adversaries, now loudly eri- treated for assistance; but from whom, among the present ferocious-looking as¬ semblage* who witnessed his appeal to their humanity, was he likely to obtain it? In his distress, however, he east a piteous and imploring look towards that .-.part
part of the eminence Occupied by Corvet¬ ta, as if by nature directed to any thing which resembled the softer sex* in his search for the virtues of compassion and This silent, but expressive appeal ofthe terrified captive to Corvetta/ was neither unobserved nor unheeded; but immedi¬ ately approaching the spot, she command* ed both ruffians to desist, in a voice of au¬ thority which failed not to enforce their unwilling obedience to this unexpected and unwelcome order; since either of these trustworthy guardians knew that Corvetta had it in her power to report their negligence, only a few minutes be¬ fore, in suffering her to pass into the cave unquestioned and unseen, Pedro, accord¬ ingly, shrunk back submissively towards Sebastian; while Gomez stared at her for a moment, and then somewhat relaxed the severity of his hold, " Curse on thee!" he muttered, loud enough
enough to be heard by the dignified C^r- vette, whom each thought himself en- titied to abuse, though none dared to dis¬ obey*—" curse on thee, foul raven ! who art ever croaking evil on our band; What shouldst thou know of this knave's stub- bornness ? stand aside* and let me deal with him—my poniard shall search his heart, if it be only in requital for——" " Peace* brute !*' again exclaimed the stem Corvetta—" what mercy canst thou expect hereafter, who never hast been merciful ?" Then turning mildly to Car- * lossa, she continued, in a tone of gentle¬ ness—-" Stranger, what hast thou done with the trash for which these fellows would deprive thee of thy life ?" ** I gave it to a holy father," exclaimed the terrified Carkissa—^1 gave it fo a holy fatiier, for prayers for my safe return to Montrosol." This answer seemed somewhat to pacify the discontented horde* while Corvetta quietly drew back to her station. "And
" And thPu art pippetly recompensed for thy credulity !" said Roldan, contemp¬ tuously, arranging his accoutrements as he spoke, in order to depart on some m* cursion; " but cease to alarm him, GomcK. -^Pedro, in futiire be not so vjolenti-^his ignorance is n© ptea for thy brutalify, Conduct him to his dungeon.—And mark me, peasant—if after three days' conside¬ ration, which shali be allotted thee, thou dost refuse to become a willing associate of the mighty Roldan, and take the oaths prescribed unto his followers* a dreadful and a lingering death awaits thee.—Go¬ mez, release him from his chains, observe his demeanour, and see that he escapes not.—Pedro, be vigilant on thy post to¬ night, and anon thou shalt have nobler occupation—Prepare our meal; Corvetta, and look that it be ready two hours from hence.—Come, Sebastian," he now whis¬ pered to the lieutenant in an under tone, " gird on thy blade with speed, and follow me»" So
So saying, the robber chief drew his mantle closely around him, and begari with hasty strides to descend the tower¬ ing eminence, on the summit of which his impregnable abode was situated, fol¬ lowed only by Sebastian, who was evi¬ dently his favourite, while Pedro was left to patrolc his solitary station; and Car¬ lossa was remanded to the innermost re¬ cesses of their secluded haunt, there to dragon his weary hours, excluded even from the light of day, until the term of his probation was expired. For Corvetta, the abused, despised Corvetta, she stood watching for a while the nimble descent of the chief and his lieutenant, and then sullenly retired to resume her occupa¬ tion. Meantime this was the night on which the monk Obando had been so strictly enjoined by the demon to visit the pool of blood at a short distance from the mo¬ nastery. Accordingly, having first pro¬ strated
strated himself before the holy cross, which, as the fiend had predicted, faded thereupon to the colour of marble, he se¬ cretly quitted the convent, and proceeded to the appointed place, little aware of the affecting discovery, or subsequent/appal¬ ling and iniquitous transactions, which were to compose the issue of his misdi¬ rected search for happiness.

CHAPTER XVI. For lie was doomed, by a father's will, to wear The sullen eowl—aud was forbid to share The splendour of an elder brother's fate; And therefore came distrust, and bitter hate— And envy, like the serpent's twining coil, Ran round his heart, and fixed its station there. Cornwall. The silver moon shone brightly over the cowled head of Obando, as he pursued his solitary way down the declivity, wrapt in ruminations, half pleasing, half ter¬ rific, as the good or evil he had to ex¬ pect from his unhallowed intercourse with the yellow phantom of the monastery arose to his remembrance. The tender light of Dian failed not, however, as he proceeded, to shed even over the tortured •■'•.■■' mind
mind of the malecontent a softer calm than he had long experienced, and a wa¬ kened in his bosom many melting recol¬ lections of times which were gone by. Among the principal of those objects which now (almost for the first time du¬ ring a period of several years) flitted in retrospection before him, were the forms of his deceased and pious parents; the image of his brother, too, as it now again recurred to his memory, caused the warm tear to trickle down his furrowed cheek— a tender, loving brother, until the unequal division of their patrimony had sown the seeds of rancour and malignity betwixt them ; for the partiality of their sire had left Marco rich—while Obando, on the other hand, was but scantily provided for. They had parted in early youth, owing to a hasty quarrel concerning the wide disparity of their respective fortunes, and ? there seemed not the least probabi¬ lity of their ever meeting again; for Oban- k 2 do
do knew riot whether Marco was alive or dead, nor had long been able to obtain the least intelligence of him; and it ap¬ peared not probable that Marco, the wealthiest, should trouble himself with inquiries about Obando, Yet did the recollection of their former tenderness be¬ dew, at this soft hour, the callous cheek of him whom, perhaps, if shed but yes¬ terday, such tears would have relieved from the burning discontent which op¬ pressed his mind, and prevented the dread¬ ful consequences that must necessarily follow the awful and precipitate course he had adopted. As Obando arrived within sight of the bloody pool, he could not help thinking it was strange that such recollections, at a moment so inopportune, should intrude themselves thus forcibly upon his mind: but finding no human being of any descrip¬ tion whatever awaiting his arrival, on reach¬ ing the brink of the empurpled stream, and
and perceiving not the least visible sign of any one approaching, he gave way to the singularly-pensive mood, which had thus by degrees usurped its dominion over him; and wrapping himself yet closer in his coarse sable garment, he voluntarily continued to indulge in the train of gloo¬ my and yet pleasing reflections into which he had fallen. While yet Obando was standing de¬ jectedly beside the bloody pool, whose clotted surface, of a deep purple hue, lay stagnant at his feet, musing on the de¬ parted scenes of his childhood, a sound resembling the approaching footsteps of more than one person struck faintly on his ear; and he shrunk suddenly behind the first projecting mound of black earth which presented itself, in order to avoid observation, which he judged it prudent to do, at least for the present. It was not long ere he beheld two fi¬ gures, in stature apparently more elevated KB than
than even the tallest of his monastic bre¬ thren (which latter circum stance calriied at least one of hisf apprehensions, inasmuch as it convinced him they were hot of the brotherhood), descend an adjacent emi¬ nence, and direct their course towards the spot he had just quitted. Obando stood trembling with terror and anxiety for the event Having descended the promontory, and arrived within a few paces of the monk's secret lurkirig-place,^^ Obandoobserved hiiri who appeared to fee the principal eriipty a sor£ of bucket (made for the purpose of carrying water to the topmost ridges Of the mountain, where there are no sprmgs, and such as he knew were used by the banditti of Roldan), containing a cririison liquids in substance and appearance niuch resembling coagulated blood, into the aforesaid streamlet, of the same dire aspect and appearance. The awful splash re- souiided for a momerit in the startled ears of
of the monk; the thick waves rolled hea¬ vily for the same short space towards him, and then again subsided into their former apathetic smoothness** Obando, as he gazed in silent horror, felt his veins curdle at the bare supposi- tion that this might in reality be blood, perhaps but yesternight as warm and precious as his own—-the blood of their unhappy victims, with which the banditti had taken this means of appalling the timid monks, in order to obtain supplies of food or money from the convent, as often as they chose to demand them. And yet it was with these very blood- drainers that he had been induced to ven¬ ture thither, for the purpose of holding some unhallowed consultation, the drift, or termination of which could only yet * e .4 be
be surmised; his brain reeled strangely, as before the altar on the preceding night, after the departure of the demon, his heart sickened, and he leant for support against the mound which sheltered him, at this new and horrible suggestion of his conscience. And now, having finished their busi¬ ness at the thus recruited pool, which the heat of the sun's rays on the preceding day they conjectured might have par¬ tially dried up, the two figures aforesaid (now no longer doubted by Obando to belong to the banditti) seemed about to depart in silence; when, just as they turned to retire, the clear moonbeam fell for a moment upon the swarthy features of one of them, which had hitherto been screened from observation, and Obando recognised at once the aspect of his early abandoned, but (as his reflections on that very night, as well as his request to the demon, had sufficiently demonstrated) - not
not yet forgotten brother! Marco—it was Marco; and—" Marco!" was the ex¬ clamation which now fell faintly from the lips of the astonished monk, but so im¬ perfectly articulated, that it resembled a mere expression of surprise, more than the name of him whose altered and un¬ expected appearance had excited it. The robbers turned hastily round, on discovering a human voice so near them, and presently espied the sable cowl and habit of Obando, who, in his mingled horror and astonishment at the scene be¬ fore him, had staggered several paces from the place of his concealment, and now stood fully revealed to the vision of those who instantly resolved to sacrifice him for his temerity, in daring to become a hidden witness of their practices. " Death and fury!" exclaimed the most savage-looking of the pair, " a monk here!—Hell and my stiletto! what is to be done?" z 5 "Down
were vociferated by the transported ban¬ dit, Obando endured his caresses, with a calmness that exhibited a perfect contrast to the wild gestures and extravagant de¬ meanour of his new-found brother. The latter was all hilarity and transport at this unexpected meeting, as might have been anticipated, from the long, anxious, and diligent search, he had caused to be made for his formerly ill-treated and per¬ secuted brother. Obando had been the subject of his dreams—the only remorse that ever touched his bosom was for his unfeeling conduct to the less fortunate Obando; his nights of watchfulness, his days of melancholy, his hours of seclu¬ sion, regret for his early treatment of his portionless brother, and grief for his in- Llity to make atonement, might veri- tably be termed the origin of them all. Marco had sufficient reason, therefore, to rejoice at this encounter; for his wakeful nights had of late been frequent, his mornings
mornings of sorrow many, and his hours of solitude irisupportably wretched. Rut Obando acted, on the present oc¬ casion, otherwise; his visage of thought¬ ful composure spoke him but little inter¬ ested in the present scene, save inasmuch as he deemed it a portion of the yellow spirit's scheme, in order to facilitate the procuration of the promised decisive in¬ terview with Roldan, the chief of the ferocious horde, to which he now doubt¬ ed not his brother belonged. For the feelings of Obando, however singular it may appear, had been more effectually chilled and blunted by the dull monotony of a monastic life, than Marco's by the lawless course in which he appeared to have been revelling; in addition to which, he had perhaps not quite forgotten the indignities he had received, when young, from his then haughty and better portion¬ ed brother. Yet Obando (I think I hear the reader now
how exclaim) had required the demon to procure him an interview with his brother, as ah everit which he imagined would be conducrve to his happiness ; true, reader- hut however this mightbe, he seemed not much affected by the present meeting, which he inwardly resolved should only serve (as it seemed the yellow spirit had designed it) to forward and facilitate the obtainriient of his more important wishes.

CHAPTER XVII. The needy man, who has known better days, One whom distress has spited at the world, Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon To do such deeds as make the prosperous men Lift up their hands, and wonder who could do them. And such a man was I; a man declin'd, Who saw no end of black adversity. Home, During the period of his associate's ex¬ ultation, and Obando's pensiveness, Se¬ bastian, the lieutenant, stood aloof, sur¬ veying them with a mixture of derision and disappointment, as he sullenly sheath¬ ed his unpolluted weapon. After the first ebullitions of his joy were over, the disapproving Marco surveyed, with cha¬ grin
grin he strove not to conceal or qualify, the shorn head arid monastic costume of the altered Obando, each succeeding glance at whose holy appendages seemed to throw an additional shade of gloom over his countenance, until—" What have we here ?" he suddenly exclaimed, while his features waxed gradually sterner as he spoke—" what have we here ? that hood —an arm half bare—a wretched sandal! what may all this mean? thou hast not been so rash, so desperate, as to swear——• yet can I doubt these evidences ? thou art a monk, Obando—a sworn supporter of yonder hatefui fane, which I have sworn to demolish—that is, as soon as its existence ceases to advantage me. Speak! art thou not a sleek, deluded, and delu¬ ding hypocrite? a canting, self-devoted sacrifice? art thou not of the order of Montserrat?" " J am— 'I am!" returned Obando, with emotion* sighing inwardly at the perfect resemblance
resemblance of the picture his brother had drawn—" lam indeed of the loathed order of Montserrat." "And miserable also?" inquired his interrogator, with a semblance of solici¬ tude/.-. "Oh, most unhappy!" replied the weep-* ing Obando, losing all his self-command and caution—" most wretched has been my career from its commencement, and yet more horrible will be its termination. Would that I had ne'er been born, or born in a less evil hour, and to better for¬ tune !" " Blame not thy fortune, Obando," ex¬ claimed the now again exhilarated bandit with vivacity, " it yet shall be amended. I have suffered much compunction since we parted — but away with such dull thoughts! tell me, my pious brother, for so I suppose thou wouldst at least be called, why art thou absent at this unsea¬ sonable hour, when only such as are evil should
should be abroad, and what is it thou seekest here ? ? * " I seek an interview with the famous Roldan," said Obando, glad of an oppor¬ tunity to introduce the subject which oc¬ cupied his thoughts—" I seek an inter¬ view with the famous Roldan—the infa¬ mous, if thou art determined to have it so, as by that haughty frown I half con- jecture; and, brother, I am deceived if it be hot iti thy power to procure me a sight of him whose dreaded name strikes terror iiltb the boldest of our fraternity, and thereby merit my eternal gratitude." , *' Inou seekest an interview with Rol¬ dan, dost thou ?" demanded the other in a haughty tone, gathering his dark mantle proudly around him, and adjusting his plumed hat with an air of lofty indiffe¬ rence. "Ay, and will render him service, if he disapproves riot the conditions," said Obando, with firmness. "Behold
"Behold him^theri!" replied the bandit fiercely* resting his hand upon the mass^ hilt of his huge hanger, with ari air of dignity that might not haVe disgraced a monarch; " thoii art in his presence, monk—speak boldly; Obahdo, and fear nothing." Obando was for a minute thunder¬ struck, arid unable to riiake any ariswer: Ori perceiving him pause astonished, the bandit thus continued—" X am that Rol¬ dan whom thou seek^^ feldfng his arms majestically on his bosom, ** aiid not only will deign willingly to hold a parley with thee, but am ready to acePrn- plish for thee aught that thou canst desire. Say, can my irifliience over the minds of thy hare-hearted brethren in any way ad- vantage theef c,n these/my Jth Ja«d courageous comrades, do thee service ? art thoii a fugitive ? my haunt shall he thy refuge: art thou aggrieved ? my sword shall do thee right: in danger art thou f and
and my band shall rescue thee. Tell me, Obando, what is it Roldan shall perform forsee ?^;^-^ The astonished monk, who by this time had somewhat recovered the use of his internal faculties at least, stood gazing on the form of his altered brother, to which the habit he wore, and the usual appen¬ dages of a robber^chief—a small horn, partly concealed beneath the folds of his mantle, a stiletto, pistols, and the yellow plume (which had hitherto escaped Oban¬ do's observation), gave an air of fierceness and depravity he never recollected having observed him exhibit before. Yet still it was the figure of his brother—tall, mus¬ cular, and in its general outline bearing a strong resemblance to his own, At length he spoke, afi^ endeayouring to subdue his agitation, which had grown insup- pressive, as the reflection crossed his mind, that ere he could ask any direct boon of the impatient ^ieftain, he raust^^i^ avoidably
avoidably disclose to deplorable degree of wretchedriess to which his own rebellious passions had re¬ duced him. "■■"■.; :, ";".'- : ': ■ : - 4t And thou art Roldan!" he exclaimed, as if scarcely able to credit his senses— "thou, my once gentle brother, thou art he at whose appalling name the benighted traveller trembles as he crawls! this dread¬ ful horde, which has so long infested us-— those unsparing wretches, who lately, upon this very spot, sacrificed the life of our superior, thou art their confederate, they are thine, and this damning witness of their depth in iniquity," pointing to the crimson pool at his feet, "this is their work—oh! must I think it thine? alas! I cannot judge otherwise, since but now I saw—*" . "Name not what thou hast seen," here interrupted Roldan; "it is but a harmless device to affright the refractory brother- hood into subordination, and render them subservient

The liquid which thou sawest me but now infuse, is a chemical prepa- ration, well calculated to delude the eyes of vulgar superstition and conventual ig¬ norance.

But let us abandon such dis¬ course, at least for the present* and select some livelier theme to talk upon: the world will ever be scourged by despe¬ rate men, while it practises the enormi¬ ties which drive them to desperation; my deeds have a tincture of olive, biit they paint them sable—my career has not been untarnished, but report has stamped my character with a far deeper and a deadlier dye than mine actions have deserved.

Come on; we^ll quickly find a surer footiWg, And something like a pathway, which ih^ftdrrelat Hath wash'd since winter. Come, ^tis bravely done; You should have been a hunter—follow rae! Byron. Steep and difficult did Obando find it; the innumerable crags which rose one above another, in awful and magnificent succession, until they reached" the outs- posts ofthe banditti, presented themselves as obstacles so formidable to his progress, that at first he was almost induced to deem thein insurmountable. These; las* i* % pediments,
pediments* however, by tlie assistance of Holdari* who mounted the overhanging precipices with a facility scarcely credible, were gradually surmounted; and Obando at length looked down upon his convent, which glimmered in the moonshine far beneath him. But now as they ascended, the path became yet more toilsome and dangerous; the ascent of several project¬ ing points of the rocky mountain, over which the shuddering Obando was in¬ formed by his fearless conductor they had yet to pass, appearing at a distance al¬ most perpendicular. Here, therefore, as they proceeded, a ,_............. - ~.—. ..

those appalling promontories, from which he expected every instant to be precipi- tatedinto the abyss below—dark, dreary, and unfathomable. Such was the effect of the seemingly awful perils he encountered on first at¬ tempting, with his unaccustomed feet, to scale the robbers' territory; but far other¬ wise fared it with his intrepid companion. Like one whom neither peril could daunt, nor difficulties overcome, did the brave Roldan bound from each succeeding petty eminence, and clamber with equal agi¬ lity over every opposing mound or sharp rocky promontory that chanced to inter¬ cept them in their wearying course, paus¬ ing often, as he proceeded, to ridicule the fears ofthe monk, or to lend him his as¬ sistance in scrambling through the thorns* and underwood which now almost inces¬ santly obstructed their progress, and which to penetrate without severely lace¬ rating his body, the flowing garb of l 3 Obando
Obando rendered a task extremely diffi¬ cult tp accomplish; Unlike the stout leather buskins of his companion Hol- dan, the beggarly sandals which covered his tender feet were insufficient to screen them horn the prickly substances by which they were now constantly assailed; his half uncovered limbs too suffered in no slight degree, owing to the rugged nature of the ascent he had so injudi- ciously attempted. These, however, were but secondary considerations^.to an in¬ terview with Boidan the evil spirit had directed him, for the purpose of calming the tumult newly raised in his bosom by the charms of the beauteous Isabel, and an interview with Roldan he was ac¬ cordingly determined to obtain. At length they passed this region of wild briar—this desolate tract: of min¬ gled earth and stone> intersected only witii coarse weeds and teushwoo^ grew whero nought hesjd% would have thriven
thriven to maturity*-:ii^-;a^yeS.'^ti^ view of ::tifeSirf^^^K*e of that tower¬ ing summit where the imjri^nable re* treat of the renowned Roldan was si¬ tuated. Arid now O^ of terror, which he fourid it extremely difficult to conceal, perceived close by his side the ferocious-looking sentmel who held his watch that night upoii the fur¬ thermost outpost of thP marauders' hold, standing half sheltered beneath a sort of hovel, composed entirely of the roots of trees, and erected on the utmost pre¬ cincts ofthe guarded territory* At this moment Roldan, who pre¬ ceded Obando, appeared sunk into a sort of reverie, probably respecting the nature of the business which a brother of the monastery (as he had ascertained Obando to be) could possibly have to transact with him; hut not many seconds elapsed ere he was aroused therefrom by the loud voice of the sentinel, exerted hi the fet* l 4 formance
fomiance of his duty—"Who goes there ?'' he demanded fiercely, levelling his car¬ bine on their approach; " give the word, or Paolo fires [" ^Never—upon his comrade!" said Rol¬ dan jocundly, flinging open his mantle, and tossing his plume backwards as he spoke, which gave his interrogator a mo¬ mentary view of his stern features. " Oh, I ask pardon, captain," said the ruffian, immediately lowering his piece— " I ask pardon for not having recognised you. But seeing a monk so near our rendezvous, I became enraged, and though t " " You have done your duty, brave Paolo!" said the captain, carelessly; "those drones are our worst enemies; but for this member of their soon to be pillaged hive, he is my friend and kins¬ man;" and so saying, he passed on, fol¬ lowed closely by Obando. And now, as they advanced towards .-.' the
the highest pinnacle of the mountain, Obando observed, to his infinite gratifi¬ cation, that the path gradually assumed a different aspect* and that, instead of being, as heretofore, frequently obstruct¬ ed, and almost choked up with weeds and brambles, through which it required some skill to force a passage, the track now wound over a level space, diversi¬ fied only by a few occasional heaps "of scattered pebbles. Across this smooth tract, therefore, they now proceeded with ease and alacrity; and as they swiftly traversed what seemed to be the only in¬ tervening glade betwixt them and the caverned summit, whereon was now dis¬ cerned a ruined edifice, resembling in shape an ancient castle, they resumed their conversation. " No doubt thou hast marvelled much already," said Obando, guessing such to have been the bent of his companion's reflections, " what kind of boon a poor, l5 secluded
secluded wretch, lost to the worM, and a ... " . j - foe to its enjoyments, as thou belevest thy deluded brother (who has indeed foe- sworn, hut not forgotten hfe former re* lish for its forbiddea pleasurea), can have; to request of the lawless leader of such a horde as thine, But, Marco, I was wretched; a dreapi—«a terrible, and yet a welcome dream* bade me to think that Roldan could aid me (although, even at this hour, I scarce know by what means), and ameliorate my misery; fired with this thought, I issued forth to seek him* and, Marco—-—'' ^Thou shalt ftn# hv& willingness to serve theey* answered the bandit* inter¬ rupting Mm hastily***^ thou shalt find Iris willingness to serve thee answer thy expectations. But in the mean time, ONndo,** he added* as a cause for the interruption, " do not, I pray thee, call me Marco b^re. I am Roldan; accus¬ tom thyself to use that appellation, and -: : \- : y-- : :: : ::^
it will soon become familiar to thee; fon* get that sucha being aa Marco was ever in existence. I am no longer that effemi¬ nate, foolish brother of thine, who be¬ haved so harshly to thee; my very heart is changed. I have acquired, moreover, a nobler appellation ; deprive me of it here* amongst my enthusiastic followers, and you dissolve the spell whereby the^ better half of my achievements are aceomplish¬ ed . Vulgar minds, Obando, however mechanically brave in action, are swayed by superstition and circumstance; tliearm of Roldan may have achieved much—but his name is a talisman which does much
more."
As the- chieftain concluded, they arri¬ ved at the entrance of the cave before dev scribed, overhung by the dilapidated for¬ tress, where- Pedro was still found lofter* ing near fn> former station, now gazmg on the wide expanse of country beneath him—now again examining' his weapons* and,
and, as appeared by his sullen demeanour, inwardly deprecating the inactivity of his chief He raised his head in astonishment, however, on beholding him return ac¬ companied by one in a monastic garb, and Roldan hastily addressed him.—" Pedro," said the chief, "go, aid in the preparation of our banquet-chamber: that done, re¬ pair to thy comrades'airy dormitory.—-You see," he added, smiling at Obando, " we make use sometimes of conventual phrases, although we hate conventual discipline, which, I guess, is canopied by the lofty awning nature spreads for them,—Awake the sleepers—I would have all present. And forget not, Pedro, as you pass the refectory, to bid Gorvetta hasten our re¬ past— begone!" Roldan, still closely followed by Oban¬ do, now gaily entered the cave which conducted to his private apartment, while Ifedro sullenly slunk away, to obey the orders ho had received from his comman- : '^^ : r^r : ; .-/ , : der,

After having noted down these elidei ent urLumsťmces the police officer left the convent with his escoit He again pro¬ mised that he would continue to make every possible search ifter the authors of so many horrid plots and after lie had returned to Rosomaski and Hhodiski the diamonds which he had seized at Visti lof he set off foi Zibno with the soldiers who were handsomely rewaided b) Rosomiski the rest then returned to Vistulof but with¬ out repassing the subtei ranean which they traversed Dunng the whole of this visit, the novices had renrantd closely shut up m the work chambei ind consequently had not been ible to know any thing of v h it had passed Mrs Dauvernop hid passed the interval of their absence in impatience at first and ilterwards in feir She was deliberating whether she should summon the domestics to go m seirch of them, when she siw them rett rn She wis delighted at seeing her daughter again end heard with astonish с 3 ment

The sun had already run over two- thirds of the hemisphere, when Mrs. Dau- vernop informed her daughter that it was time to think of returning to Cracow.— Rhodiska pressed them to stay some days, but Mrs. Dauvernop could not consent : The¬ resia, however, promised that she would visit them again, and remain with them some time. They then separated, with an encreasing esteem for each other.' Some of the following days were em¬ ployed by Rosomaski, in causing a strong wall lo be constructed at the two extremi¬ ties of the subterranean, and bars of iron to be applied to the doors of the caverns, by which wise precautions, he flattered himself that he had secured Visţulof against any more such attempts. One day two letters were brought to Vistulof; one of them was addressed to Tlosomaski, antl the other to Rhodiska. The former was written by Mrs. Vendost, who complained

' demanded Ro¬ somaski " You will know thit in proper time," replied Dorothea, '*at present I am going to tell you what caused the ι umbling sound« which you have heaid in the stibtcrianeans There exists a comnuimiition between the caverns of Vistulof, and those wheie the Countess and yourself were tonfined, w'icn you fell into the hinds of Lanfnnro At the time of your deliverance, Lanfianco fled, and as he was afraid that this commu¬ nication would be discovered, he hastily called Cassimir and Zulisko to his aid, and Ihey rolled several fragments of rock, which were destined for that purpose, igainst the door in the wall, which was at the further extremity of the passage, between the ca¬ verns By these mems, the police offit ers were prevented from perceiving the com¬ munication, and left the cavern, persuaded that ihey had no other outlet than that from

to such an accusation, he knew that the truth must be flmlly discovered, but, at least, he should enjoy the certainty ofyour being ignominiously carried to the recep¬ tacle of fhe worst malefactors, and ofyour suffering inexpressible anguish for a while In the refinement of his vengeance, he en¬ joyed moie m knowing that you were wretched, than he could denve fiom seeing you perish, because you would then be be) ond his reath It was Zokalef and my¬ self who contnved to convey, in secret, the trunk which brought Mr Vendost to Vistulof, into the cive where the agents of the police found it, and the other emis¬ saries of your enemy brought the corpse, ^nd plnced it in the trunk When all things were thus prepaied, as we could not much longer hope to escape detection, we fled, and Zokalef went to Zabno with a paper which your enemy had drawn np, contain¬ ing the accusation, and describing the places where the jewels and the corpse »rere
were to be found What ensued is best known to yourself" " At length," said Rosomaski, surprised at the indifference and effrontery with which she acknowledged her guilt, " thy accursed tongue hasrım through the black catalogue of thy infamy Now tell us instantly the name and residence of him who has insti¬ gated thee to all these atrocious acts " Surely," replied Dorothea, " theie can be no need of m) telling you the name of the person who takes so much pleasure m your misfortunes you ought easily to guess it " She had scarcely pronounced these words before Rhodiska entered, wilh a wild and distracted air— " There is some new plot on foot, ex¬ claimed she,— ' all the buddings round the poultrj-yard are on fiie, the flames have already reached the barn, which now pours them out, together with clouds of smoke, on all sides As the wind blows towirds the tastle, all the buildings are in danger — Hasten,
Hasten, Rosomaski and Ludowico, and direct the servants what to dc^—they are running up and down in the greatest con¬ fusion, without knowing where first to di¬ rect their efforts to subdue the devouring clement." Rhodiska instantly disappeared, without observing, in her terror, that Rosomaski and Ludowico held Zokalef and Dorothea, The crackling and hissing of the fire, and clouds of smoke, intermixed with large flakes of flaming matter, which the wind now blew over tbe castle, had such an in¬ stant surprise upon Rosomaski and Ludo¬ wico, that, without bestowing another thought on the wretches in .their custody, they ran to join their endeavours to those of the domestics, in slopping the destruc¬ tive ravages. They had scarcely left the room, before they perceived four men armed, who rushed in, and making a sign to Dorothea and Zokalef, they all disap¬ peared together, before the two friends, divided betwixt the fire and their prisoners, could
could have the presence of mmd to deter¬ mine n bellici they had betler endeivoiir to stop the one or ihe other The fugi¬ tives piofited by their hesitation to reach the gate, where they met with no opposi¬ tion on the part of the portei, who had quitted his post, to give his asustanee in putting out the flames They took out the key, which was on the inside of the gate, und no sooner reached the outside than they locked it, and secured then retieat Rosomaski and Ludowico stared at each other some moments with the utmost sur¬ prise, but the clamours of the domestics soon assailed their eais, and made thein rusten to their assistance In about two hours they began to get the fire under, which raged so long as it could find mate¬ rials to nourish it, and in another hour all danger of its rekindling was prevented The barn, which was filled with grain, as the harvest was just finished, and the te¬ nants had paid their lents m produce, was entirely consumed with its contents, and the
the buildings round the poullry-yird were all levelled to the ground, tit smoakmg ruins When the fire wis totally extinguished, Hosomaski demanded of the portei why he had permitted those four stiangers fo en¬ ter? "They offered their services,' replied the porter, " to help in putting out the fire " Hosomaski had an entire confidence m his por'ei, who had lived with his father, and he would not throw any blame on him, foi fear of chagrining the old man, of whose fidelity he was assured , he . ontent- ed himself with ordering hun for the futuie to admit no stranger, till his business was known Rosomaski had no doubt lhat the fire had been kindled by the irtompbres of Doiothea, who had been ilinned by their outcries m lhe foiest, and suspecting what hid hippened to Ihem, had taken thest means oi eflecting their liberation As Khodiska had paid no a'tcntion to the vol ιι n pnsoners.

ABOUT ten days had elapsed since tht fire, which favoured the escape of Zokalef and Dorothea; Rosomaski and Ludowico 'had made fruitless searches to discover the 'traces of the four banditti, who, by that audacious enterprise, had taken from them their prisoners. They were discoursing on the presumptive causes of that strange 5 event,
event, when thev heard a noise at the gate, and heard the old porter talking in a very loud strain They wilked out to see the cause of it, and the old porter no sooner beheld ihem, than he said— " Count, here are some strangers who desire admittance, but I would not grant it to them, before you were made acquaint¬ ed with their business " " You are right, ' replied Rosomaski Then the ρ jrter opened the wiiket and called out—" Tell me who you are, anei the gate shall be opened to you " " It is Theresia Dauvernop, replied the person , " a friend of the Count and Countess Rosomaski ' " Open the g> te instantly," said Roso¬ maski, " ane) admit the chaise into the area " When those orders were obeyed, Roso- maski saw a young lady alight, accompa¬ nied .by two domestics lhe long black veil which floated over her face, at first d 3 prevented

of Mr and Mre Vendost, as you will hear " The day after my an iv il at Jaroslow, which was ata late hour, I presented myself at the door of Mrs. Vendost They told me that she was not to be seen, and that she had suffered such a lively grief at a late loss, that her health had suffered greatly I asked her waiting-woman the cause of it, and I had no need of repeating the question, to wind up the alarum of her tongue, which did not cease striking tdl it had let me into all the secrets of the fa¬ mily. This is the substance of what she related to me, in a manner infinitely more diffuse " Mrs Vendost is lhe daughter of a petty tradesman, residing in some little village not far from Ciacow, she had been edu¬ cated in the principles of the purest mo¬ rality, and she seconded, by a good natural understanding, the sound education which her parents, who were richer in virtues than in the gifts of fortune, had bestowed upon
upon her But they committed a fault in marr)ing her lo a man of great opulence, as vanity soon choaked every good quality which she possessed This man was IVfr Vendost She would never have obtained his hand, if he had not had a corporeal de¬ fect, which was not well recompensed even by the advantage of a consideiable for¬ tune—he was deaf and dumb, as to the rest, he had every quility of heirt and mind which could render a hushind dear to a wife He was exempt from that stu¬ pidity, which is the usual concomitant of persons in his unfortunate situation, but Mrs Vendost never loved him Some months passed over withoul any mteirup¬ tion ol their haimony, but Mrs Vendost soon began to connect herself with other young females, who idolized dissipation and the tumultuous scenes of high life — She was tired of a husband who knew only how to love, but could not amuse her и ith saying pretty nothings She was not want¬ ing in brauty, and as she was, besides, become very rich, she was soon followed by
by a tiain of admirers who aimed either at her person or her purse The demon of coquetry hastened her defeat Mr Vendost had rivals but she conducted herself alwa)S with so much precaution and myster) that if Mr Vendost tould not flatter himself with being adored by his wife at least he wis ignorant that in secret she was guilty of any infidelities But at list the habit of continuing to dis guise eveiy thing from him wis followed bv a most fitil event —She wis very near being suipnsed by her husband at ι mo ment when she was engaged in a tete a tete with oneof her lov ers who had only just tune to tlnow himself into in adjoining closet to eseapc being seen by him She wis not long in inventing a stntagem to send Mr \ endost out of the way she met himwith an in of concern and give him to understind that an unknown person had just brought word that Mr Novorod was on the point of yielding up his last breath This Mr Novorod was a distant relation and intimate friend ot Mr Vendost his residenc
residence was not at Jaroslow, hut at half a league s distance Mr Vendost no sooner heard the fatal news, than he uttered an ex¬ clamation of grief and surprise, and de¬ parted precipitately, m the hopes of em¬ bracing his fnend before he lost him for ever In the way to hjs house, it was ne¬ cessary that he should cross a rav ine at the foot of the hill It happened that at the moment of Mr Vendost s passing it, the commandant of Jaroslow was exercising the cannoneers, at about four or five hundred paces from the path which he took, which was a bve one and a nearer road, they were .firing at a mark, and all their balls were duected towards the hill, at the foot of which Mr Venejost was to pass He was so emjiloyed in thinking on the situation of his departed friend, that he did not distinguish the cannoneers thiough the thick clouds of smoke which lay between them, and which resembled the mists ansing from a marsh, and he could not hear the voice of the centinél, who called to lum to go back — He
He held on his duect course, and m an in¬ stant was struck with ι ball which neirly cut lum asunder ť It was not long before Mis Vendost wasmadf icquimted with the meiancholv citistrophe of her husbmd she was shock edat it ind could not help reproithmg heiself with the guilty artifice which she hid made use of to send Inm aw y, sud which hid proved the indirect (inse of his deith 1 h trinici! injdent wjs of itself, s i r cieut to (n\e struck her with remorse, but her grief v\as owing to another motive —She regretted hci husbmd less on his account thin hero ι· —she reiletfcd tint U the property bel m^ed to Mi \ endost, ind would fill to I is own fmulv if she should hippen to !< e her only son who is in a veiy declining state Ihis idei so grit ng to a woman who doats on wealth, his plunged her into ι state bordering upon despaii md she had ordered that, ior days to come no person should be per¬ mitted to ci ter her apirtment, nor tven. to be iniiounced voi u e * Though

themselves, and prepare to protect them.

Rhodiska enforced this observation ,* but it was not without difli¬ culty that they prevailed upon Ludowico to retire to his apartment.

wrong, on account of the darkness and coldness of the night, and the abundant* of the rain, which made them ťike the precmtion of putting up the glastes — Their attention was absorbed in interesting conversation, particularly on what could be the cause of Ludowico's detention, which began to give them greit uneasiness, insomuch, that they did not perteive that the coach was far be) ond the place to which they were going—in reality, they were Without the city, and in a bye- road Hosomaski, surprised at their not having yet airived at their place of destination, Was about to make some enquiries of the coachman, when suddenly the carriage stop¬ ped, the doors were opened at once, and on each side appeared a man, armed with a pistol, vvho cried out—" "V ou are dead if you offer to stir ' Paulina im ncdiately funted Rhodiska s attention Was distiacted from the thoughts of the impending danger by her daughter s situation,

which they should lequire Rhodiska and Paulina expressed their thanks in а very forcible manner, and the monk set out wiih them towards the cottage which he had mentioned When they reached it, the monk had no sooner acquainted the cottager wtth the situation of the strangers, than he readily consented to his proposal, to accommodate them to the best of his power The monk Ihen said some words to the cottager, and depai ted The cottager made up hb fire, and placed seats for them befoie it He then left them for nearly an houi, at the end of which time he returned, bunging with him a basket, containing some bottles of wine and an elegant little repast — Having spread the cloth on the table, and placede.eiyotherrequisite on it, the cot¬ tager made signs to his guests to fall to Although the Rosomaskis had not been ill supplied with provisions on the road, yet the thoughts of then situation had deprived them of appetite, they were now at liberty, and then repast was grateful to them— so h 3 true

inquiries concerning her husband ; but no one knew any thing about him : neither was there among their papers the least clue to give her the information which she wanted. Jaroslow seemed to be the only place to which she could direct her inqui¬ ries, and she dispatched a messenger thither, with orders to spare neither trouble nor expence to discover who was Mr. Rugon¬ ner, the husband of Mrs. Vendost. After an absence of near a week, the messenger returned with the news that Mr. Rugonner was a stranger in Jaroslow, and no one could tell whence he came. This circumstance raised a suspicion in the bosom of Theresia, that the unfortu¬ nate Rugonner must have been Ludowico; and she experienced a momentary happi¬ ness, at never having suffered the secret of her attachment to escape her : she would have been excessively mortified to have entrusted it even to the ear of friendship.

JN lhe meati while, flie suspicion of Ln- dowico's treachery preyed upon the vitals of Rosomaski, and rendered him nearly insensible to the approaching horrors of ■want. Rhodiska, who beheld his pangs, and dreaded lest the return of the messen¬ ger whom they had dispatched to Cracow, should bring them acquainted with new misfortunes, began to lose her fortitude. Rosomaski appeared lost in the supposed grave of Ludowico's friendship, and she had now no friend—no Theresia, in whose bosom to pour her anguish. Paulina was in every respect worthy of her love—of her
her confidence ; but she dreaded to in¬ crease the sorrows which the' distress of both her parents had visibly produced in ht*. After a long struggle to conceal her weakness, Rhodiska could not prevent the decline of her health from becoming too apparent. Rosomaski instantly recovered his sensibility : he threw 'his arms about her neck, and intreated her, in the most endearing terms, to endeavour to preserve a life on which his own, and that of their dear Paulina depended. He began to per¬ ceive his error, in having suffered the sup · posed loss of a friend tO' render him for¬ getful of the assured affeetiions of a most amiable wife; and he vowed, from that time, to banish friendship from his heart, and to let his affection for her retain the entire- sovereignty of it. Rhodiska was most sensibly affected at these revived en¬ dearments : she returned her husband's earesses with equal ardour, and affected to smile ; but it was evident that her smites ' m 3 were
nerc on!y. i mask, lo baie heridespondencj and rapid decay. Their whole atocK of money had been expended several days, ind they were com¬ pelled to diaptwe of such «loculi« aa they could spare, to eke out their existence, till the messenger, of whose return they.were in hourly expectition, should arrive.— Ihere was some rent due to the landlord at whose house they lodged, and probably guessing at their reduced situation, he made a demand of it. What wai to be done ? They had disposed of every thing but Ihe cloaths which covered them. Ro¬ somaski ingenuously confessed their situa¬ tion to the landlord, and expressed his hopes that the messenger, whom they had sent to Cracow, would return in a day or two, and not only enable him to pay what was due, but compensate him for his kind¬ ness. The landlord was not to he so satis¬ fied, and Rhodiska's diamond »ing was de¬ posited with him, as a security "for what tfas due. Another week elapsed, during which
which this unfortunate family lived nearly en cameleon, and the avincious and piti¬ less landlord then told them that fhey must seek other lodgings, as he expected on that or the next day a family to tome from the countiy, vvho would take up the whole of his house, and that he could not think of losing such excellent lodgers Roso¬ maski intreated him to spare them one room, if it were only a garret, but the landlord persisted in lus refusal Ue told them, however, that he rented a house adjoining the city walls, which indeed was notso good as his own, but that if there vías a vacant room m it, they should be welcoipe to remain till they should be able to suit themselves, without giving them¬ selve» any trouble about the rent, until ţtţey should be able to pay it without dis- ţiessing themselves IŞosomaskı tljanked him forthisseemmglygenei ous offer, which ţaş, in геаДиу, only intended to get them out of the house. As they did not like to appear in tbe streets by eţay, in the only и ^ undi ess
undress which remained to them, the land¬ lord consented to their remaining till night, when he himself conducted them to 'the place whither they were lo remove. Rosomaski was struck wilh horror and indignation when the landlord stopped at a wretched ruinons habitation, whose extei rior denoted the residence of misery and squalid poverty, and told thein that was the house; but he thought proper to dissemble his feelings, till he should be in a condition to resent this insult. On «ntering the house, the landlord demanded of a womani whose business it was to let out the nume¬ rous apartments to poor people, and to receive fhe rents from them, whether she could not find a room for the gentlefolks whom he brought with him? She answered, that there was only a single room vacant at the top of the house, which she was afraid would not suit gentlefolks. " We will put up with any thing for the day or two that we shall want it," said Ro¬ somaski, assuming a cheerful tone. ■ ' The
The landlord then wished them a good night, and the old woman conducted thetft to the garret, which, with its furniture, baffled all description. Rhodiska, whose tottering frame Rosomaski had with diffi¬ culty supported to this dreary abode, no sooner looked inside it, than she sunk down in a silent agony- Rosomaski de¬ sired her to be comforted, and leaving her to the care of Paulina, instantly vanished, and not long after, returned with a little wine and some btead and cheese, which was a comforting sight to those who had been twenty-four hours without tasting any thing. They then lay down in a state not to be described, almost wishing not U> behold the Kght of the retui ning day The next morning, Rhodiska gave the most alarming symptoms of a violen t fever, and Rosomaski and Paulina absolutely for¬ got the pangs of hunger, to recline over her, in a state of distraction, during the whoie of the day. On the ensuing day,. Rosomaski reflected M 5 that,
that, without food, his beloved wife and 'daughter must bot4i soon inevitably perish before his eyes; and losing all sense of shame at the degrading humiliation which he was about to submit to, in the sense of their dangea·, he sallied out, to endeavour to excite fhe charity of the benevolent.— Most of those whom he solicited, turned a d»af ear to his entreaties ; but some be¬ stowed a trifle, with which he bought some refreshment, and hastily carried it home. Without staying to partake of it, he again left the house, and, thinking he might meet with more attention to his tale of woe in th '' environs, than in the midst of a city full of bustle and noise, he went without the walls, to seek for those whom he deemed not likely to reject his petition. At that time Paulo Giovanna, а very eminent banker, resided in the city of Ge¬ noa. As he Was extremely rich, chance, or .rather the choice of his parents, who wished to guard against,the vices arising from youthfuľ idleness, had determined 3 him
b'im to follow that lucrative profession.— Це was naturally so compassionate, that tjie sight of an unfortunate person never {ailed to produce in him that lively emo¬ tion, which is the source of benevolent actions, and an impulse which cjehcate şoıds cannot resist. Though he was in the very floweri of his age, yet the simplicity ofhisdress, the plainness of his equipage, and the frugality of his table, formed a very striking, and, to him, a very honour¬ able contrast against the insolent pomp of tjie others of his rank. These displayed their magnificence by a tevéé of ignoble noblesse, who submitted to live on terms of intimacy with men whom they ejespiseej and ridiculed Jiehind their hacks, upon condition oţ* haying pecuniary loans, which were never intended to be repaid. Şut Giovanna spurned at consequence ao un¬ worthily obtained. Hé submitted indeed to the visits of some of these noblesse, who wished to partake of his fortune, but he gave them no encouragement; his fol¬ li. 6 , , lowers,
ENEMY. lowers were the indigent and the wretched. they opened their sufferings to him with¬ out hesitation, because they were assured of attention and relief: His domestics, to please him, had none of those insolent airs, which those of people of fortune generally give themselves, It would have been a crime in the eyes of their master, if they rendered less respect to one than to ano¬ ther—if they pushed back poverty to make way for wealth. No inscription could have been more appropriate to the house of Giovanno, than—" This is the asijlum of the poor and destitute." Every moment which was not taken up with business, was employed by Giovanno in making the tour of the city and the sub¬ urbs. His avowed motive fbr these pedes-' trian excursions, was the spring and vigour ivhich the exercise gave to his constitution ; but his real inducement* was the repast which they afforded to his benevolence; by throwing inhisway those objects of dis¬ tress, who too generally disgust the eyes of
of rich men, but whom he sought for, in order to have an opportunity of making that use of his wealth for which Heaven bestowed it upon him. As he was univer¬ sally known throughout the city, his gene¬ rosity was frequently abused by unworthy objects ; for it was a maxim with him, that it is better-to be ten times deceived, than to deny one who wanted and deserved his bounty. In order, however, to prevent; in some measure, the too frequent repe¬ ti lîon of such deceptions, he prolonged his philanthropic walks bejond the walls of the city, and, in one of these, his pe¬ netrating eyes were attracted' by the ap¬ pearance of a middle-aged'man, apparently a foreigner by his dress, which was very ragged, although it betrayed" the remains of tarnished finery. The person of the wearer was perfectly congenial with his garb; it appeared worn out with wretched¬ ness and squalid poverty ; but it was cha¬ racteristic of a man, whothad deserved and had once seen happier days— ite was frank; gentlemanly,
gentlemanlyi andsomewhat martial. Gio- vanno's soul was instantly uiHametl with its unquenchable thirst' of brightening the eye dimmed by sorrow. As the stranger approached Giovanno, he seemed to eye himwith that side-way glance, as if to read bis heart, and inform himself if it were open to distress, and with that timidity which is always apparent in those who are pot professed mendicants, and which arises from a ejreatj of refusa). Giovanno pene¬ trated his thoughts, and he advanced slowiyj and directly in a line towards him»,with a Ipok so full of complacency, tjiat'the un¬ fortunate could not /aij of construing it in bis favour. It was as much'as if he had said —" Fear pot— щу heart is not of flint— Ihe tale of woe which you have to disclose will readily melt it " BOSomaski, who was this stranger, and Giovanne mel in a kind of hesitating man¬ ner, and both stopped, as if by a secret impulse, Rosomaski made a respectfub ¡stinte, which was immediately returned with,
with a polite and affable frankness As Rosomaski seemed not to have sufiiciently recovered his ease, tp know jn wjiat man¬ ner to begin a conyersation, which might- lead to the story of his distress, Giovannp made some common-place observations on the fineness of the weather, antl tltc gay appearance of the surrounding landscape, to which he received such answers, de¬ livered in a manner,to confirm him in his opinion, vvhich the stranger's first apjpear- ance had given birth to, that he Jiad a claim to more than capricious fortune had allotted him. " The noise, tlţe Rustle, and the rte¡v,er- changing objects of the city," said Gio¬ vanne, "¡have driven nie ,ţo seekJOr a lit¬ tle variety in th,e country. I have walked a long way without a,ny refreshment, and should now be glad of some. Do .yo.u know any house of entertainment near at .hand»" " I observed one," replied ^qsomaslţi, "а.Ци)е
" a little farther on the road you are going." " That will do," said Giovanno, " but [ do not like to sit down by myself; if you are not otherwise engaged, I request you will do me the favour of keeping company with me." Rosomaski again bowed respectfully, giving, at the same time, a most significant glance at his apparel. Giovanno read his meaning. " Dress signifies nothing," cried he ; "I never regard the ornamental parts of the outside of a house, but the conveniency and neatness of the furniture within." " "You may command me then," said Hosomaski, a little more assured. "You-will very much oblige me," said Giovanno ; and, without any kind of cere¬ mony, he took the slranger by the arm, and they walked together towards the inn. As they entered it, Giovanno desired the landlord to let them have a room to- themselves. Boniface, eying his customers with.
with a most significant glance, (one of whom was in rags, and the other very plainly dressed, ) answered that he did not suppose their business was of such Impor¬ tance as to demand much secrecy; and that his private rooms were only for such gentlefolks as could afford to pay well for them. There was room enough for them in the kitchen, if they liked that—if not, they were welcome to Walk on, till they could suit tliemselves. Giovanno, who was meek as well as cha- ìitabìe, desired some refreshment in the kitchen, since there was no other room for them, adding, that they would make a shift. "A shift 1 " cries Boniface, " you have made many worse in your lifetime. My kitchen has been thought a very comfor¬ table place by your superiors, and I am much mistaken if there are not such there at this very moment." " Very well," says Giovanno, " then shew

"Ihaveitat all prices," replied Boni¬ face ; " put down that which wdl suit your pockets, and I wi|l wanant you an, enter¬ tainment suitable to it, though you should lay out like princes." Giovanno put into his hand ¡1 gold du¬ cat. Boniface smiled, and cried out—" By tlie hollow, tooth of Şt. Winifred, the thumb of St Agatha, the great toe of St. Bridget, and all the other joints of all the Saints in our calendar, I swear, my masters, that your trade of begging is better thai) ipine of innkeeping ; and ift was sure of meet¬ ing with such success as yourselves, I wpuld willingly exchange yiith you. But come along, Signers, ope man's money is. tjie same to rae as another's : you pay dqvvtj like princes, and you shall be treated as such. Thi? way, Signors,- liy lhe time уоц have finished your repast, (ľ there is Щ empty room !Я 'И hqusg, уоц shall haye it." Boniface
Boniface led the -way to the kitchen, where several tradespeople of Genoa were regaling themselves, Giovanne, who was well known to every person in the city, and beloved by all who knew him, no sooner mado his appearance, than, to the infinite surprise and mortification of Boni¬ face, all the company rose, and offered him their seats, in the most respectful manner. " What, landlord '" cried one of them, " have you no other place than your kitchen, to introduce Signor Oiovanno into?" The name of Gio.anno, which had reach¬ ed much farther thm a knowledge of his person, was like a thunder-clap to Boni¬ face, to whom it «as not strange. He se¬ cretly cursed tht flippancy of his tongue, which had, as he imagined, affronted one of the most opulent men in Genoa. He began, so soon as he had ¡recovered alitile of his native impudence, ta make some apologies».
apologies, which Giovanno instantly cut short, by telling him it was refreshment, and not words that he wanted Boniface insisted upon shewing him mto a private room, and Giovanno seeing that all the company were still standing, out of respect to himself, told them he would go into another room, as he perceived thit he dis¬ turbed them A plentiful entertainment was served up in one of the best rooms, and Boniface, to retrieve his former erior, waited on them m person After the cloth was removed, wine was ordered, but it had not the ef¬ fect of removing a degree of gloom which shaded the stranger's brow Giovanno« heart ached to relieve his too apparent distress of mind —" I thought the wine good, ' said he, " but you do not seem to enjoy it " " It is indeed excellent, Signor," replied Rosomaski, "but do not let me appear ungrateful in the eyes of a person, wh» has
las invited me to partake of a more sump¬ tuous repast than any I have of late been accustomed to, not through any occasion he had of my company, bnt from his be¬ nevolent wishes to relieve my distress.—. Pardon me, Signor, but I already know your heart too well, not to discover its spring of action through the veil you would wish lo throw over it. It is the mask of philanthropy tto enjoy its own sensibility, without hurting that of others who benefit by it The gratefulness of the repast has been infinitely exceeded by your condescension, in thinking me not unworthy of sitting down at the same table with you ; but; alas ! Signor, with what satisfaction can a hus¬ band—a parent, sit down to delicacies, when, at the instant, his wife—his child are perishing for want «f the most common necessaries of life?" " Where?" cried Giovanne, starting up. " Why had you not told me so the first montent you saw me } Rut you have said enough
enough—·list vs weite no more time in words—this hnttnt «onduct me to your abode. Dut-sttvy—younaid thoy were pe¬ rishing through "want—we must Hot go empty-hahded."

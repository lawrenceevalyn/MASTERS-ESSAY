WILD IRISH BOY.
Ï «?? home on fire with emotions I did not understand. No man, or woman, or child, knew less of love than l dui, YV hea I thought of her surpassing beauty, of the intolerable splendour of her wit and grace and manner, of attractions which annihi¬ lated the porter of time, and almost that of humanity; when no other thought vv^s present to me for hours; when my senses seemed all absorbed in mental sight, and th it sight had but one object ; when every place I beheld was the drawing-room of Mon trevor-ilouse, and in solitude and. society I only saw its brilliant enchantress voi , n. n
when amid the incessant and restless scintillations of her w it and her beauty, I still felt that she was unhappy, that her endless strung h for wit and distinction was too Ifbe a struggle to hide inward puin, mul thought of it with auonv and fond- ne.ss, [ still did not know that 1 loved. I owed this fatal ignorance to my inexperi¬ ence of hfe, as well as inexperience of my own heart. 1 did not believe it possible seriously to love a married woman. Of the vices ot soeietv 1 knew but little, and there is a spell shed over the higher duties of life by the imf, finite saci ed iu ss of au¬ thority, which a \ouna mind dreads to break, i abandoned rmseif to the fatal indulgences of thought. 1 believed there was no mure of crime in fixing my whole soul upon lnr h ?? go than upon a picture or a slaluo. and as little danger. I knew not that 1 loud, till the kuo u ] c doe was too hile. 'i hey who expect to hear of impmity
pafiiated and blanched by the pencil of sophistry, or the ties of society dissolved befure the breath of sentiment, should read these pages nofuither. They will neither find guilt justified, nor wretchedness exalted into fantastic and impossible í«bcií\. I avow tny errors, but I avow tbc u to (,e· plore them; 1 exhibit them, b , !

For ih 1 fi ist week 1 d:eaded tosco her; she was one onlv to be seen at in* torvais; a perpetual blaze is only pro¬ ductive of pain and blindness. Hut Mas* seau, with all the adroitmssof a French¬ man, procured admission among the higher servants of Montrevor-1 Jou>e, and then procured such information of the habits of its inmates as could only be interesting to a Frenchman or a lover. I suffered him to tell me of Milords and Mesdemoiselles" (for there wcíC two daughters) domestic habits, of which ï do not remember one Mord; and he theo proceeded without an inquiry fiom me to tell me that Miladi had never been visible to domestic or in¬ mate, or visitor, since her arrival in Ireland, except the day I saw her, on which day, after declining Milords intreatics (by mes- bage) that she would honor thy table be
L n' pHscnee, she thought proper to risc just as lhe ihniicr-bcil was nugmg, and hurry down ? hcrrobe de chambre, hardly allow ing Γ> nuet timo t«> pm ou lier veil. 'Ihe inne before dnd sínre that dd}' she passed almost entirely in bed, suffering no attendance except hom her own woman, who -.»-ave her her laudanum aud corlee, the latter of which she took four times a day; and when Ikunct, who was a woman of some merit and consequence wah her lady, \enuired to expostulate with her on su eli dangerous habits, her lady told her that she had no object in life but to sleep out the remainder, and that she only lamented she could not sleep awav w ha: was past as well as what was to come, u but that,** said she, α neither colice nor laudanum can do for me now.'* The account concluded with lamentations by all the performers for the lost splendours ami luxuries of London, where their lord and lady had outshone all that was splendid ? :)
or luxuriou^, but they comfoitod th« ni¬ sei ves by the observation that it was im- possible that tin ir lord, whose eldest son was (ff such abihres and consequence as to be an embassador at the acre oí six and twenty, whose vouitccst son was one of the most distinguished and populai officers of the ÚA\\ and a peculiar favorite with royalty, and whose three eldest daughters wete mai ried respectively to the Piemier, ä Scotch Marquis, and a commoner of the first talents and influence, should be suf¬ fered with such an host of alliances and connexions, to languish away life in banish¬ ment. To all other parts of die account I was deaf, but of Lady Montrevor. I low- was í witched by the caprice, and exalted by the magnanimity, and touchet! by the real and inward wretchedness î It was evident she knew nothing of domestic happiness; she could not love her bus- band ; he was a man vain and insincere, önd unprincipled; she did not love h^r

J This was very " tragical mirth" to me, I could not en¬ dure it, 1 writhed under it ; this creeping, ingratiating, Joseph-Surface character, was the last in the world that resembled mine, or that 1 wished it to resemble. I strug¬ gled under a fictitious consciousness of mendicant duplicity, with a spirit that despised money, and that would not falsify its sentiments or habits for the wealth (»t the woild.

non; that he,himself, though distinguished bv an illustrious lineage, venerated his ancestors more for thtir virtues than their titles; he concluded by asking De Lacy to take wine with him, with a counte¬ nance of which the composure was easy only to him. The Chieftain was not so easily conciliated; he mixed the wine with water, and observed that the sentiments he had just heard his Lordslup utter on ihe distinction of high descent, were, he believed, not common among the English p'-crs."' 4t Among all of them who pos¬ sess the distinction ] should hope," said his LonLhip, who rudly was proud of his rank.

The Chieftain said tt was easy to remember the dates of recent transactions. <c Recent, my very good sir, do you call the conquest of England by the Duke of Normandy re¬ cent?'* u My Lord," said the Chieftain, u to a Milesian everv thing is recent but his own pedigree/' Whatever was Üe¿ effect of this speech on Lord M. it was impossible to perceive* The Chieftain was too important a man hi the country not to be includeti in les canvassing plans. fíe applied himself more « 1??*1? to my uncle; spoke humbly of the English peer¬ age, and the English cabinet and English îmasues; censured the patched and party- mdtd conquest of Henry the Second; i*>:o< rated ihe memory of Oliver Crom¬ well; and ???.?? with respjet of a work in which it was attempted to prove that Ire¬ land was one of the first countries whi< h ivas inhabited after the deluge. Thv 4-
Chieftain, whose notions of Irish anti* ι ¡nity were indefinitely romantic, seemed not perfectly satisfied with ibis limitation; and llis Lordship, who was not incumbered with too much deference f*»r the Mosaic system, proceeded to obsuvc, that he had bilie doubt that there were nations of ar «ntiquity w Inch might make theology rather jealous if it were examined, ll^rc he was checked by the priest who always attended the Chieftain, who hinter* that he would m ither be pleased nor convinced by m\ thing that impeached the verily of the \ervd writings.

" Here, my lady, here—Oh, bless and tor- give my stupid head, this is not the rouge, this is the box with the Egvptian medal that was on your ladyship's toilet, and in my confusion 1"—" Was it î Oh well— Bennet, I think I have heard you admire that medallion, take it and wear it, or bury it^but Bennet, never while you live, tell any one you saw me shed a tear." Cennet promised with her eyes overflowing; and then related the whole to Mr. Boivin, by whom it was told toMasseau. But after this communication I strictly forbad Mas- scau to seek for or repeat any more ; the sufferings of such a mind were no subject for the curiosity of a domestic. I could not endure to hear her spoken of as un¬ happy ; yet I thought of her unhappincss myself with approbation, even with de¬ light. Her lofty impatience, her .silent
unpublished struggles, the anguish of a mind too proud for complaint, and de¬ spairing of affection, were all indications that her present habits were all forced and unnatural, that her vanity, her levity, her dissipation, were all artificial and irksome ; that she was formed for better things, and was conscious of it, that to other children she might have been an affectionate mo¬ ther, and with another husband, an ex¬ emplary wife. Perhaps the reformation of a veteran woman of fashion by a boy of seventeen will be laughed at as the excess of moral knight-errantry, yet I fed my mind with it in delight, and when it seemed hopeless, 1 still thought how passing beautiful she was. Cards, however, were issued for the ball ; the country was delighted with Lord M/s hospitality. No people are so easily summoned to festivity as the Irish.

reached an early maturity; her attitudes displaying an undulation of youth and a luxury of grace ; her face so beautiful, that the eye which was raised to it, lan¬ guished with its radiance, but could not withdraw itself; her sparkling and ambi¬ tious manner claiming homage from all, and sporting with the homage of all. When I saw her^ this brilliant and bewitching creature, who seemed formed for some peculiar world of splendor and pleasure, w -nere vauin/ was no folly, and dissipation not a crime, when İ saw her wretched, and concealing her wretchedness under the glare of her wit and beauty from every one but herself, my heart was wrung with love and pity, f would have shed its warm¬ est blood to have served and saved her ; but I was carried away like herself by her gaiety and facility, and forgot all pain in the sound of her voice. " This is vastly gay and ridiculous; 1 protest my levee is quite crowded — my levee actually, I have but

I was determined they should have some¬ thing to stare at ; Lady Montrevor in her robe du matin at midnight will last them all their lives, and probably add some years to it ; I can't imagine how I could have gratified them more, except by adopt¬ ing the costume of Grannweal or the Cas¬ tle-Spectre;" I ventured to say that to submit to be gazed at, was only paying the tax on beauty, and was sorry the next moment I had said any thing so foolish and flippant.

tell her there was one who felt she could blush and could weep, one who pitied, who honored, who----------1 dared not have told her that, A considerable circle had now col¬ lected round the door, those who were near enough, listened, and those who were not, stared; but the moment the heat became intense from the crowd, Lady M. declaring she was expiring with cold, and diawing her veil over her face, disappeared in a moment. I remained gazing on the spot where she had stood, and listening to sounds that I thought still floated on the air. I was roused by Sy¬ billa's taking my arm as a kind of protec¬ tion from the persecution of Sir John and the peer, who wore applying their glasses within six inches of her face, and repeat¬ ing to each other—" damn'd good faith—- deve lis h wc dd imbed—rather too flimsy though." I was withdrawing with my eves fix^d on their unmeaning faces yvith an expression they need not have m iscou-
strucd, for I was provoked by a long course of tacitinoli, and a kind of tacit rivalry; but Hammond came up, for the last dance of the set was just commencing, and I again lingered near the door with» ut a single motive, but that it was the last place in which I had beheld her. Sir John and Lc>rd Roschamp lounged there still, tapping their ancles with short switches, and occasionally uttering oaths by way of interjections of ridicule or con¬ tempt, when Lady Montrevor again flashed on us, her whole dress and costume al¬ tered as if by enchantment. The rohe de chambre was thrown ofl, her whole dress was a free ? of the richest white lace over a pink silk vest and pantaloons ; her arms, for sleeves sac had none, were cla>ped at the should* r with pearls, her bosom was hardly varied by a pearl chain, and her shilling hair folded round her head ups suspended in lion t bv an ornament of pearls,-while the richer ornament of her
ringlets fell behind in a cluster as if ac¬ cidentally cseaping from the tuft in w hieb they were· collected. No language can Cijuvey the feeliii'is with vi hich 1 saw her approach; the first I will uigenuouelycon¬ fess was an almost painful sense of bash- fulness: I was a fioy, unused to the dis¬ play of female attractions, and utterly unacquainted with that full and tempting developement that distinguished the mo¬ dern costume; 1 turnul away sick with dt sire and delight; at the second glance, I felt mv eye more steady, and mv cheek less flushed ; at the third, 1 knew not w irat happened, for i know not when it ceased. There was a pomp ο? allur- ment about this hi^h and luxurious beauty, that V- χ/ J inspired more voluptuousness than awe. 1 approached her vviîh U s*, diffidence, every man approaches a woman dì est as she was v. ith diminished ddhdeuce.— " Domine, votlre equipped ib" dancing, am sorrv 1 wore boots,'' said the baronet
and bì^ peer, a^ she approached, viewing her with alw»ut the same inrelli^em-e of pleasure that they would an haunch ot venison or a fresh hntth» <»f Ihirpuiidy. 4 * í önkiit t*> be much obliu* d to you ot vour hoots." said Ladv M. v ' but ! have no intention of dancing." k " Hu» will you not look on the «lanceis ; t h· v had the good forlune to nmus·* y ni tite l.i<r ptr- foiinaiicc, and then* ptiweix or tlie r z* al dt ?? setin at all dniuni&h* d." ?И tl. # was verv ?1".?, hot I s-aid it to withdraw her from the door. I almost ventured to touch her hand as I spoke. She ? id not withdraw it. 4 * Really I am utruui to ven¬ ture too mar them, there is a kí: d of w Id animation m their movements, that makes me strongly suspect they are all under the intlucnee of Uberon's tnauic tìnte, and cannot help what thev are domu ; now I can, unless I venture within the spe L and then 1 should be compelled to i>umboi along wnlnhem.aud then"— 4 ' And what then»"
said I, for her faci li t ν had made me bold. « Why then, perhaps, I might lay hold on jou, and compel you to join me in poetical justice;" t; If that be the con¬ dition, 1 shall tempt you to the very verge of the spell—we are within its influence, do you feel it, or is it not enough in poe¬ tical justice that t should feel it r'' " Oh, perfectly enough, but in civil justice'1 should inform sou, that we are at the end of the set, and that 1 am the most capri¬ cious creature in the world, and that un¬ less you can find some one who would rallier see me dance than herself, which will he sufficiently hard, it is probable I shall i>e in my first sleep by the time you have succeeded to the head of the room." Sybilla was near t lie top, but the moment I hinted Lady. Montrevors wish, every one made room for lier. I led her to tne head of the room ; it was a moment of joy and pi ide, every eye was on us; to have touched her haud but m solitude was
a dream that made me blush even in sleep; but to have and to hold it m the presence of multitudes who envied and wondered —was it a wonder that I was intoxicati d with pleasure and vanity ? Let my age and country, and constitution, be remem¬ bered. Lady M, 4 saw the madia ss rise'—-she felt that one of us was impru¬ dent—no woman ever knew how to laugh offa thing with such levity. " This gen¬ tleman,'* «aid she to the ladies near her, " insists upon my teaching him the itkkIc of dancing in fashion, in the reign when I first went to Court ; he is so good as to dispense with the hoop and lappets, and minuet, and so he will probably with the rest of the ceremonv—we had better ??> off as soon as possible.** I will not at¬ tempt to describe hor dancing, but by its effects ; it was an exercise in which I was said to excel — i was at least sufficiently fond of it; yet all power, except tint of gazing at her exquisite motions, forsook
me; she moved, hke a genius moving his pillions ?? the Confines fif light. An involuntary burst ol admiration ilsind even from the insipid women who had collected about her n ith no oth< r obj et than to wonder at ht r dass. For a \{·\ν moments İ floated in the air. as she seemed to do ; she had hardly glided thiough half the Svt, when she ran abioptly out of it, declaring that whe ucvt would dance again t% till a m \v ?<??? appeared, or the Irish mim irei v<uk\ ¡Any m time, or"—I followed her to catch tee sentence, or her hand, which sht 1 had but half withdrawn ; it was too mik h tbr me, her beauty and her dancing, and her facility, and she ivas one who never abated the lustre of her perfections ; she passed through the rooms, and I still followed lur. Sir John and Lord Koschamp were in the gailery where refreshments were spread ; a part of the entertainment to which they seemed to do justice with infinite satisfaction. u Was

those to utter?" " It is the only one they are accustomed to utter in solitude." I caught at the last word—" This solitude was formed for other sounds—This place may seem for lovers' leisure made."— " Now, instead of pure description, shall we have a little sense/' said she, hastily. " I brought you here, because in this shade your face bears a strong resemblance to a person, a friend, the only one I ever had— one whom I have lost for ever." Her voice was not lost in tears, but a wild and solemn break suspended the sound that thrilled me through. Her beauty, her sorrow, her despair, for her face, darkened by the shade, was fixed by an expression of absolute despair, tore my heart with something above human passion ; she seemed like a fallen angel sitting sadly on the verge of light, and viewing her « c lost estate."' I thought she only wanted a tongue to soothe, an arm to shield, a bosom to
shelter her, t.i be the most exeehVnt of heiuiís: í thought her one whom the world had depraved, and of whom the work! was not worthy. Myriads would I have ¿hen to have restored her to the un- bi· nehed nvïj-sty of her first estate, to tb^ eneture which Nature and Heaven had intended h^r to be. My senses were mfbmed w:th wine and voluptuous motion ; my forehead was throbbing, and my heart too with wild and luxurious emotions of sorrow and love. 1 f ril at her feet : 1 said all that passion, and soli¬ tude, and seventeen, suggested ; 1 im¬ plored but "to be her slave, but to be thought of as one to whom life was nothing, unless it might serve her as one whose heart could feel and bleed, and had felt and would bleed for her, as one whose silent homage never would offend her pride, whose breathless passion never wot/d insult her puritv,** While I was speaking I did not raise my eyes, it was
not necessary, the tone of her voice was enough ; her whole character seemetl to change in a moment; in a moment she was again the vain, volatile, dazzling Lady M. u Vastly well delivered, and not mouthed as mam of our pkuers do; but Mr, B. í must beg you to act so no more, or if you are resolved on a moonlight scene, let it be Lady Randolph and Douglas, not Romeo and Juliet, it will be more in character for Loth of us/' i was Mill kneeling, and &till held her åvc^s ; í was touched by her resentment, but her pride excited my own—*' You know all now, I am leckless of the consequences; you may drive me from you, you may dt spise me, but you never can take from me the recollection of this hour, the daring hour when 1 knelt to you, and told you I loved.'" .She was withdrawing her dress from my urusp, u Λ h ! pardon me: \ know not what 1 say; do with me what you v\il!. m\ heart, my existence, are m
your hands, break or destroy them, cr cheimh them as you will ; I don't ask for pardon ; I know not what í say.*' " Very likely, but as it is necessary for one of us to know what we are doing, I know I shall quit this retreat immediately." This mo¬ ment appeared to me decisive. I was in¬ toxicated with love, and fear, and shame. If she went, and went in anger, 1 saw little that remained to me, but despair. " Stay with me, only stay with ine, and I will but gaze on, but worship vou."'— " Worship the moon rather, ? is there lost wits are preserved, and I wish you a good journey on the next post-griffin."' This cold and ludicrous contempt over¬ came me: I loosed my hold, the tears lushed from my eyes, the burnin* tears of passion and shame. " That you should reject me I could bear, but to heap with contempt one whose vouth vou have blasted, whose heart you will break—you have made life hatt fui tome; I only knelt, VOL, H. i>
and to kneel to you deserved despair/*— She paused, she was touched, 1 felt it from her altered respiration. " Can thi«* he possible ?

If you will prove yoursolf worthy of my regard, you may, by cultivating your own, by suppiessmg a romantic fancy. I am no object of passion"—her voice failed—" but no one . ver shall know that.

the contentions of a man and wife, more than the relations in which they stood to each other, as the master of a family and a gouvernante. On this occasion they were uncommonly acrimonious. No crea- ture could leaf I a more secluded life than Miss P.-she appeared perfectly content with studying in the morning, and wrang ling in the evening; but no sooner w «is the public hall announced, than Miss P. declared her intention of accompanying us to it. My father opposed it strongly, but vainly; every effort at remonstrance drove Miss P. to reasoning, and her rea¬ soning drove him out of the room. When the night arrived, Miss P. appeared pre¬ pared to accompany us. lier appearance 1 was little disposed to notice, till com¬ pelled to it by my father's fretful censures; I «lanced my eye on lier, and thought her dress perfectly «imple and domestic. tí í am sure vou are drosM'd hke nobody said ?? father, peevishly. *· Very likely.
said Miss, with a vivacity which seemetl borrowed from the occasion, " for you know we see nobody here." We set out ; this detail of balls and dinners may perhaps surprize some readers: in Ireland we have little else to tell of. In ail other countries 1 ever visited or read of, to entertain is sometimes the amusement of life—in Ire¬ land it is constantly the busines«;. The middle ranks of life enter into the contest of dissipation with a vain and emulous spirit of expence, of w hieb there is İn England no resemblance. But there is always a balance for the ddect4ofso- ciety—our ce.nmoners are like nobles, and our nobles like commoners. It was an eventful night to me, ? et L had no pre¬ sages but of pleasure. Though the dis¬ closure of my wild passion had produced little consequence, yet I was rej« -iced that it was disclosed; 1 thought i should see something of mutual intelligence, some¬ thing that recalled our communication— d ò

* Badurage is thrown away upon those people,** ??\ Lady M. to me; ih I am thrown away upon them, but admire my knowledge of human nature. ï knew the irood people of this country would not believe their senses if I appeared among them hke a rational creature—an English peeress, and a woman of fashion, a rational creature, impossible! it would be quite unreasonable, quite out of nature, to have am tlun-j: natural about me. Besides I tia\ ? always observed, that when people's ' xp< ι tation* arc excited to observe folhes, ^κ ht r tinn bo disappointed they will give \ou cu'iht for v vt n vice m human nature, «»ι «*. !«wv n. st> l pu ferrod phniiig the tool ? pkc, instili d*, vil - ih.at s, being thought to dd mi, M j, rabo dc ( !ί·υκίί\\ my late ap; earancc, ìtìo*itottt was i.uly a tub to the wh.ale, and the monster seems diverted by U. i say all this because 1 would not have \ou think me the ridiculous being i nuibt have appeared to eviryoire cise.'
I tried to thauk her condescension, but dared not trust mvself with words like softness: 1 prized her penetration with a good conscience,and admitted that nothing could escape it. " No, nothing ; 1 can see every thing, except my own faults. I thought proper, tor instance to-night, to appear iu a public character, very dull and diplomatique, as you see. As it is all acting with mc, the oftcner î change my part the more I amuse the world, and my¬ self. This Roman-matron costume wauld be tolerable if I had ??? jewels to em¬ bellish it, except those in my hair."— " You have a thousand, ÎJ said J, ardently. ** Have you discovered a diamond-mine on the estate,'* said she, laughing. " No, it is all personal property, all your own — beauty, rank, talents, virtues, children/*— " Some of them," eaid she, pursuing the metaphor, ** are false, and some of them unfashionable wear." I tried to check her despondency ; <( No, 4 said she, " no,

I have assumed my part, no matter whether voluntarily or not, and I must go through with it, and I will go through with it ; a full theatre and loud applause for me till the curtain drop?, and the farce or tragedy ends. Besides, if I retreated now, they would call it cowardice, not virtue ; no one would believe it real, the fictitious character was so wei i sup¬ ported. ** " What matter for their opinion or their applause," I spoke with enc^y ; the necessity of suppressing my voice seemed to give mc a kind of inward ibrce; I told her wdiat she might he ; 1 tc'd her of one wdiose advice, whose exampk* m^ht yet make her a wonder to the world and ?

I turned away to request some m^ipid girl to make me happy with her hand» uheil Miss M- whom I was passing, faintly articulated u a^ain—this is too much,"* and fainted, lier fall v\as so sudden and helpless, that she actually fell into my arms. Lady M. flew to as^t her; she recovered rapidly; Deloraine had rushed horn the dance to support her ; she opened her eyes, shrunk from him, and grasped me earnestly. Lady M. had de¬ tached a small essence-bottle f ?? a chain on her neck, and *ent Deloraine for water, yvirh an agitatmn that became her more than any thing she had evei assumed.— Delorame returned, but apparently re¬ pelled by Miss M/s í epu »nance to his as-itance, gave the water to me, and re¬ tired.

age, andan experienced pugilist; but my limbs, though singularly slight, were mus¬ cular, and my stature so much superior to his, that ï felt shame at the violence I had exercised, and stooped to raise him. Lady RL withdrawing her train, on part of which he had fallen, retreated with Deloraine and Miss M The whole room was now in confusion. Hammond, who had been dancing with Sybilla, and had quitted the dance to de¬ fend Ri iss P. from the persecutions of Lord iloschamp, now joined forces with me to protect both the women from the ridicule and insults of the room, and we effected a retreat just as Lord Uoschamp and Sir John were telling of the " damned famous hoax of old Bethel sending his cast-off mistress to matrimomze his son and daughter at an assembly of people of fashion; at least, where we were, damme, that knew her in London, and knew her here too, damme, in spite of her prim
dross, and philosophical jatgjn; damme, it is die most famous blow, the most fa¬ mous blow, bv tleavens, in the woilu* 'lhat big t>oy w ili be whipt, and the girl locked up for sutler mg me to quiz my old acquaintance Sally Percival. Lamme, i knew her as well a> the pave in lond- Street." We returned home iu perfect silence, only broken by Sjbilhls sobs. Miss P. attempted io speak ; I adjured her to he silent; I lnlie\e 1 stamped; 1 know my voice failed as ι *p* !«···; whether my vehemence or my grnf moved her—she was silent. We arrived at Lemon-grove. My father was sitting up, and Masseau was reading Voltaire's Pueelle ι him. He started at seeing us enter. Sybilla was weeding, and I was like a maniac. lie demanded l< What was all this for?" I could not answer him, yet a torrent of words was on my lipa. L took Miss P/s hand; 1 led her to him; 1 fixed my dry and flashing eyes on him. My look asked
but one question. I could say no more; my voice was choaked ; my lips were parched with passion. Mj father ap¬ peared to shrink fromme; I threw Miss IVs hand from me; and taking Svinila with me, left the room without uttering a word. I led Sybilla to her room in silence; I felt as if it was my duty to watch her steps; at her door she throw her arms round my neck, and wept on it from shame and fear. Shame affected me differently; I hardly could bear to look in her inno¬ cent face, after it had appeared as the public ?? upanion of an harlot's, and in the presence of Lady Montrevor. I raised my head indignan tly, wiped her tears from my burn n ? cheek, and rushed into mv own room, where 1 sat unable to sleep, yet unable to bear the thoughts whieh kept me awake. 1 had never inquired for mv mother; I had heard that my fa» ther had many mistresses: that they vveic
dead; and I hoped she was dead amorin them; but now the domestic habits of Miss P. and mv father, the authoritv she assumed, nod the infhence she exercised over him and us—I grew sick with thought. Mv heart was an affectionate one, but it was not made to love vice; I knew 7 I was the child ofshatne, but how horrid tobe the witness, the contented and domestic partaker of parental shame ! At length 1 slept; but my dreams were full of the piereding night. At a latt 4 hour iu the morning I heard a rap at my door. I had determined not to go down to breakfast; and I desired the persot» to enter in no verv invitin·; tone. It was Deloraine; î was glad to see him; I wished for counsel, for I felt all the iluctuation of youth. Deloraine spoke promptly and decisively. * % This is a dreadful situation/" said he, u 1 could hardly think vour father would have exposed you to it. Jie deserves to have the whole consequences of it tall
on himself. This Miss Percival, this woman whom he has made his daughter's governess, and the inmate of his house, has been his mistress, has been a woman of the most shame tulhfe. Lord Koschamp knew her too well; it cannot be denied, but you are perfectly innocent; you have nothing to s -??, or to do in the business/ 1 I fixed my eyes on him — " If that is all, if she be but his mistress, I will buckler her against a million. If 1 have nothing to do in this business, if she is no more than mv father's mistress, she shall be de- fended or dismissed, or—all shall be well. 1 will (xcuse her, or fight for her, or any tiling my father and' the \sorkl may demand. Dut 1 ask one question more ot you, Deloraine. 1 ask it solemnly, seri- ously, as 'd man of honor, as a son; remem¬ ber vour own ir.rents, vou know what 1 would ask—Oh Íj— d, 1 sec anguish and shame in your face, í am undone, she is mine and Sybiih/s mother.** 1 dashed
myself on the bed ; I felt almost stub- rated; Ì wished I were. 1 will wot» I need i.ot, detail my slnmo and sorrow. I could have loved a mother, could have knelt for her blessing, and wept on her honored hand—and tb ?. mother was an barici, branded by the ii* alting and puhlic ieeoçnition of the man Ì *mted ami defied, and m the affronted prvence of the» woman to shield whom hom iubidt I wnulíi have shed my bluod aiul from whoFC pre^ttice the event had probably h-mished me foi' ever. From this shock no being could ??- fer so much as mv>eit. 1 was \ouiv'. with all the innocence, and ignorance, ¡\nd pride of youth; ï knew not how the world palliated those matters, I cared not how. Female infamy was loath¬ some to me; 1 ilk blistered ;md le¬ prous with its contami nation ; I could have sud with Desdemona, 4i it loaths me now di.it I do speak the name ; to dQ V0Ï . u. r.
the act that mi^ht the addition earn, not the whole world should bribe me ° I will not dwell upon this hateful period. Debraine inflamed my resentment, and confirmed mv resolution. He told me there must be a duel, but that I was scandalized for ever if I engaged in it. Λί Let him/' said he, ' ς who has humbled and degraded and injured you by his vices, be exposed himself to the danger of their consequences. There will be a duel, but let vour father be the combatant. You must forgive me, Ormsby, but I never could regard as a friend or a gentleman a man whose life was staked for the de¬ fence of vice—a mere blusterer in a bro¬ mei. It is not impossible but this un¬ happy affair may be concealed even from Lady Mon trevor's knowledge, if you don't act an ostensible part in it ; but if you do, the secret must be disclosed, for who but a relation, who but a son would buckler the purity of his fathers mistress against a million ? Take my advice, I have seen
more of the world : as I value your cha* raeter and your happiness, I charge yotí not to fight. Your father will not, per¬ haps, send a challenge, or if he*does, it will not, perhaps, he accepted, He is xt invalid, and not young ; for you no allow¬ ance can he made on either account ; ii you move in this business you are known» and if you are known you are undone* A man entangled in such a quarrel ;;t the beginning of life, will never extricate him¬ self from its consequences tili its conclu¬ sion. Come with me; we will not stay liere; we will not be seen here; and when we return, all will be tunquil.*' I was miserable and feverous ; I knew not what to do ; í was ready \o accept an omen from the right or kn. I was struck with Deloraiue's representation became it was the first 1 heard, and because it promis« d that all might yet be concealed from Lady M. ï would have sacrificed the world to hide my shame from her. 1 did more—I e 2
sacrificed myself. 1 went out with him, but soon drove him from me; for I could not bear to hear the verv terms in which any allusion was made to the subject, and I thought his face, the face of one known to me, reproached me with the shame of my mother. It ? easy to wander in soli¬ tude in Ireland ; I strayed through field and fen, a long, dark, winter's day, drenched hy rain, and parched fröre by the wind, vet nothing couhl extinguish the burning of my cheek, or cool ?? dry and cleaving lips. All day I wandered without meeting a creature, whom I knew, or who knew me. Towards evening, I saw approaching me a figure resemblimr Mr. Corbett's. He was the lastman in the world I could have borne to meet. I flew from him, and hid myself in a cottage, it was night wh( n 1 ventured to return home. There was something in my return* m its hesitation and concealment, that struck me with a
sense of guilt, and a presage of evil which 1 could not repel. My very step, slow and faultering, was like that of a criminal; the waving of the leafless trees, and the moan¬ ing melancholy wind, seemed to murmur to me reproaches and woe. 1 stopt in the shrubbery ; I looked towards the house ; it was all dark and silent. I would have given any thing for a sight of the meanest domestic in it, for the sound of his voice, for a light twinkling in oue of the win¬ dows: I waited in vain, there was neither sound nor light. I could stay no longer in my concealment, my mind was fever¬ ous and fantastic ; I began to mistake the audible throbbing of my heart for the re¬ spiration of some one near me whom I could not see. I rushed from my con¬ cealment ; 1 heard the feet of horses in the avenue ; 1 shrunk into it again. The surgeon rode past me. I knew him ; he had attended me when I was wounded in the arm. í grew sick ; I wished a bullet E 3
in my brain or my heart. I was faint with famine and weariness; I staggered ín an attempt to follow him, and fell senseless. I suppose I was found by the servant who was attending him ; but I recollect nothing till I found myself in my own room. Masseau was near me. I could not ask him a question ; it was unnecessary ; a Frenchman seldom waits to be questioned. lie poured out upon me without mercy the whole intelligence: that my father had sent for me in the morning to send a chal¬ lenge to Lord Rosohamp; as to Sir John Orberry, he thought being knocked down was enough for him; that his astonish¬ ment at finding I had disappeared was beyond all description ; but the business could not be delayed ; he was determined to fight himself, selon les regles de viehe cour. They ???1 : Lord Roschamp and he were both slightly wounded ; but whe¬ ther from agitation of mind, or motion, he had burst a blood-vessel, and was in the- uttnost danger.
I will not insult any man by telling what 1 felt. My first impulse was to fly to my fathers room, Masseau at¬ tempted to hold me, 1 would not be held. Oh that í had thus contended with Deiomine' I knew all 1 had to encounter. Mv father was irritable and vindictive ; and he was, besides» so immersed in the modes of his former life, that he could Kssign but one motive for declining a duel, and could have but one feeling and name for the man who could dare to decline it. 1 knew all this; yet nothing could keep me from his dying bed—the bed where I had laid him. I rushed to his door; it ivas shut against me; I heard something like a tumult within; I attempted again to enter: the door was but partially shut, yet it was not open enough to admit me. I thought no humiliation too low for the moment; I put in my haudat the door; I fell on my knees; I tried to supplicate; my voice was choaked. lie appeared te ? 4
luar me — " Is he here:" said he, in a voice of inconceivable bitterness.- I an¬ swered only with a cry ol despair and de- speration.—" I)n\e him away, I cannot die m peace if a coward be suffered near me; drive him from the door—does he Mait fur my curst ? He shall have it when 1 neover my breath—Oh this damned snilbcation ' y " Oh, do not curse me/ I groaned, 1 sobbed. " By (Jod m Heaven í am no í ow ard, no deserter of my parents: i will puitaie Lord Koschamp to the ends of the earth; he or 1 shall perish to appease ? ou. I will pour out my blood »í h Hill stop the flowing of jours: only do not curse me. 1 had not a moment to think, or I would have died ten thousand deaths bifore this; you placed me on ? precipice: if I fell from it do not revile me, do not curse me, it is horrible to die cursing, it is horrible to live with ? parent's curse." He attempted to sptak. I heard his throat rattle. 1 blessed heaven it was nor
his curse 1 heard; 1 had crawled iní J the room on my knues i implored Sybilla, who was praying Inside the beu, to pray for me, to mtercouc with him for mc. Mv head 2\'ew indd\. I feli— but 1 lune heard that bed' ! not curse meas lie Uit «L I remember nothing but thut tiiey all swam in blood before me. 1 did uot recover perfect recollection f ? some days: when 1 did, 1 exerted mvstli vigorously to shake off m\ despair: î deter- imm d not to be a cowaid in ui'nd. Ì looked around me; the fair land of youth and life was a desert. 1 never expected to reco¬ ver the blow 1 had received, 1 never wished to recover it; the imputation of cowardice in youth, the blasting of my ieelings and (d ?? character by one fatal instance of defection, admitted in a mo¬ ment of hurry and weakness, 1 submitted to with a gloomy resignation that bore aud braved its shame without wincing, I w »shed uot to hear of consolation, to com* r. ô
promise with misfortune or disgrace, to accept of remnants of clandestine and fu¬ gitive and worthless happiness; all hap¬ piness was beneath me. I took shelter in one line of resolution ; I determined never to plead for my vindication; in pleading there might be deceit, there must be weak¬ ness and degradation. 1 resolved if the world ever kimented its injustice to me, it should only lament it over my early grave. 1 roused myself to act, and look those around me in the face, like a man who could retrieve himself by a word ; the thought of the world's contempt had little in it that was terrible to me, but had ς all my hairs been Words/ I would have com¬ promised for the contempi of all to avoid that of one being—who that being was I need not say. My w 7 eak, violent, boyish conduct on that fatal night, she might have forgiven : but what woman can bear even u suspected coward? I summoned Mr, Covbett, and one or
two others of the most respectable per¬ sons in the neighbourhood. 1 announc¬ ed my intention of opening my fathers will; and till this was arranged, I re¬ fused to see Sybilla, or my mother, or even Hammond. I had applied to my uncle; I expected his answer. I svas proud of it; my own resolution had anti¬ cipated its purport. I knew the high and haughty spirit of the Milesian, vvho never brooked an insult, and who knew but one way of avenging it. My uncle had fought several duels, it was the habit of his coun¬ tiy, his age, his profession. He could make no allowance; lie had no percep¬ tion for any other mode of expressing re¬ sentment, or adjusting differences between men. It was the principle of the Milesian, it was the habit of the soldier. I say thi« merely to exculpate his heart from a san* guiuary or vindictive feeling; it was the gentlest that ever beat within an human breast, Vet, with this heart mv uncle E b
wrote to renounce all connexion with, ail knowledge of me for ever, as caie who had disgraced his family, and blasted his youth with eternal infamy, infamy never attached to an Irishman, the iniiunv of declining a diivl^ or declining the opportunity of a duel. " But I thank Heaven," the letter concluded, " you never bore the name ol De Lacy/* The lines were written with a trembling hand, and these quiverings of humanity and affection were a consola¬ tion, which my heart, chilled and rigid as it was, could not decline. The day ar¬ rived ; every place was searched for the will; Masseati, Miss Percival, every one that knew my father or his habits, assisted in the search: no will could be discovered. í u his cabinet were only found some lines versified from some obscure French poet against the immortality of the sotd. When all search wás allowed to be in Mi'm. 1 addressed those who had employed themselves in it; 1 told them that I was perfectly acquainted with my late lathers
intentions in regard to the disposal of his property ; that a circumstance had occurred which made property, or possession of any earthly thing, of little avail to me. My voice failed, but I extended a paper, en- t i rel v rt signing my share of the property to >li^s Percival und my sister, which I desired to be divided equally between diem, in addition to the respective shares which the law would entitle a wife and daughter to in default of a will. This disposition, I was sufficiently confident, Sybilla (who was now the lawful heir) would imt dispute iu relation to her mo¬ ther, and { requested the witnesses of my declaration to sign and attest it as a legal aud valid instrument. I tore myself from remonstrances, and inquiries, and amaze¬ ment, and (Svbilla's) tears; it was not my object to have my resoletion praised, or canvassed, or deprecated. I ^hut myself up in my room, and thanked 1 haven, like Jaffier, that 1 was not worth a
ducat. 1 had determined to be alone, for there are frames of mind of which you dread the effect to be suspended by the sound of any voice but your own ; but I had hardly retired when Deloraine broke into my room per-force, and cursed his offici¬ ousness, and deplored my obstinacy, and actually shed tears with such violence of honest grief, that afraid of being softened, and ashamed of being consoled, I swore that the next allusion to the subject would drive me from the house to shelter myself in the grotto, or in the river that flowed beneath it. He was at length pacified, and then endeavoured to find out some¬ thing of my future purposes of life. I preserved an utter silence, or answered only in monosyllables. I was proud of my secret, and wished, by my present tenacity, to compensate for my past and fatal flexibility. When he found 1 was neither to be soothed by kindness, or assisted by advice, he rose to departs and
anilin, with a vehemence of affectionate ? -íef, supplicated my pardon for the injury he had done me. " Deloraine," said Ï, * ( you have done me no injury : to advise me to act as a man of honor and a gentle¬ man, as a man whose feehngs instructed him to act Beyond the fixed and settled rules Of honor in the fencing schools, was no injury, but an honor and a kind¬ ness ; the consequences to me have been what the world would call unfortunate ; but nothing can be a misfortune to a man which does not deprive him of his intellect or of his probity ; yet at the age of seven¬ teen, friendless and fortuneless as I am^ diis stern philosophy is solitile the natural complexion of my mind, that I dare not listen to the voice of a friend, I dare not trust myself to hear a sound that would soften me. I require to be i settled and b^nt up'—I feel I require it much—
Heaven knows what may befall me, it knows my heart—its only purpose is to wrest justice for mvself liom the world, to be remembered when 1 am gone with re¬ spect, pei haps with regret. 'Ihe means are all indifferent to me — menns are al w avs so to a dt termined mind, }et, that my determination may not he shaken, you must leave me, 1)------, and you must see me no more. By heaven 1 cannot bear the sight of any thing I have ever loved, while the mark of shame is on mv forehead still/' The very tone of my voice had acquired energy from the harsh and wavwaid scents 1 had lately been hurried through. Delorame retired sadly. 1 would not suf¬ fer myseìt ?» think of his kindness, vet there was a silent and unfelt consola¬ tion in it that 1 could not prevent from creeping about my heart ; at all events 1 was consoled by the thought that my mis¬ fortune had restored him to the Chieftain's
favor, and fortone, who now openly do- elared that his next adopted heir bhouid be n soldier. Few men of my age, dashed at the opening of my lile from opulence, or the expectation of fortune, to actual and abject penury, ever felt so little dis¬ poned to contemplate or comment on their fall. 1 was occupied by other feelings— ' my reputation, my reputation*—1 could have groaned with Cassio. Λ thousand wild projects we**e in my head. When Marshal Schwerin threw his standard among the troops of the enemy, and de¬ termined to die before the eves of the sovereign who suspected his courage or lus fidelity, he did not feel the alternative, the qu'il mourut impulse moro sttongly ihan 1 did that night, w ht η {canine my head against the window, as tho passing * i louds chequered the reflection on the floor with pale and fitful wanderings. 1 thought (»flier whose thought came on my mmd like tho moon trom behind a dark
and stormy cloud, and dreamt that she might sigh when she heard of my being a fugitive and wanderer on the face of the earth ; that she might regret I was com¬ pelled to seek hardship, and peril, and pain ; that she might yet shed a tear over the grave of one who died because he would not be all unworthy of her. I would have dreamt thus till morning, had uot Sybilla rushed weeping into the room with a letter in her hand from my mother who had just quitted Lemon-Grove. Of S\ billa 1 had not vet thought: I felt at Lemon-Grovcj with its present mistiest she must not stay ; but this letter antici¬ pated ail my debates about her—I read it with difficulty, my eyes were dim and burning ; it talked in the jargon which I execrated with more fervency than ever, of the freedom of the human will, and independence of human agency, and the necessity of consulting the general good in opposition to what were called domestic and proximate feehngs ; of her having felt
within herself c the capacity of increasing the happiness of an human being/ and that this capacity might not be unem* ploxed, that she had retired from Lemon- Grove with M. Masseau (with all the per¬ sonal property they could collect) without the appellation or restraint of that odious and degrading monopoly called matrimony. All this was detailed in the cold physical style which writers of that school assume when they try to be profound without rea*· soning» and argumentative without logic, and sentimental without passion. 1 was used to this jargon ; I understood it to be merely an apology for heads that cannot k^h a flimsy attempt to gloss over deter¬ mined depravity by sophistry, to erect vice mto a science and a system, and teach rampant and glaring corruption to assume the steady step, and talk the connected and consequential language of deliberate rectitude: like the day of the d* ifieatìon πι Paris, which offered for the object of
worship a harlot in the costume of a goddcuH. Ibis letter almost drove me mad; it was a eaiMic m my fresh and burn¬ ing wounds. 'Ihe depravity of this un« happy woman seemed determined to perst cute me through life and out of it— alie ? now dead, and 1 cannot speak of lnr w sth the bitterness of recent shame and sorrow«. 1 wish to speak as little of her ?? possible—she was my mother ; but I would only observe that her progress was perfectly accountable and obvious. She ima lived many years in careless pro¬ fligacy ; in this state she had a temporary connection with my father, and bore him two ( hildrcn ; the connection was after¬ wards dissolved ; she lost her health, in the long hours of sickness and seclusion, the idea of reformation was obtruded ou her, but she had no one to give stability to her purposes, or direction to her efforts. Jn this state of mind the writings of the
modern philosophers fell into her hands; she was delighted with a svstem that .«aved her the angu is! ι of repen «ance, and the labour of reformau ai. Vie* 1 and vb'tue ¡die learnt were merely habits acquired, not by a change of heart and principle, but of mode, rendered necessary, not by the will of Providence, and the interests of an immortal sphit but by tiieir ten¬ dency to the general ? -ood, and produced not by the auspicious agency of Heaven, but by the potent and plastic energies of man. Here she learned that to lament former depravity was íoolwh and unphilo- M>phieal, where reformation was so ea^y. where physical necessity, contiolling nìì the actions, rendered vice no ger míne culpable than voluntary, ami where the exclusion of future responsibility deprived the mind of all solicitude for the event, c-ven should its progress terminate in re¬ newed vice. In ι his state of inind she a^ain met my father, who hardly respiring
from the loss of his darling son, and vieu ing society with the spleen of a broken constitution, and a disappointed mind, proposed to Miss P. to retire to Ireland, and live in retirement with the children who yet survived, and who in the mean time had been educated at hisexpence. Tin consented, but in a manner characteristic of her opinions; she derided natural affec¬ tion and parental ties, and determined t» assume no influence, and avow no relation to us, but one merely abstract and intel¬ lectual ; and asked, with ludicrous defi¬ ance, how the general good could be pro¬ moted by her being recognized as our mother?—Perhaps some lingeri tigs e f shame, which the new philosophy had not wholly extinguished, prevented her wish¬ ing to be known to her illegitimate chil¬ dren as their mother. Some such feeling I am sure, operated with my father, when he consented to the plan of her becoming her daughter's governess; but whatevc 1 4
the new school may teach» the habits of vice are not so easily exchanged for those of virtue. Miss P. grew weary of seclusion; she appealed in public, she was soon recog¬ nised, the consequences have been told. The barrier of public shame once sur¬ mounted, every succeeding step was easy ; like the goblin in the tale, the brook once crossed, she assumed her former shape, and collecting all the property she could, she retired with Masseau, whom probably her money bribed to accompany her, and who intended to sustain die incumbrance no longer than he could remove her and himself to his native country. But this event suggested to me the necessity of speedy and vigorous resolution. I had at least learnt the importance and the habit ot tins from my late misfortune. Nothing teaches a man to think with more vigor than having an iielpiess and dependant female to 11 link for. Sybilla was left alone, and left to me; her father was dead, her mother was worse
than dead ; her wealth (for my father had lefi much more personal property than I imagined he possessed) u as only a temp¬ tation, and her softness only an encou- rarement The persons to whom Lemon- Grove had been disposed of, had given us notice to leave it. Her uncle's castle, only inhabited by men, aud by men much averse from female habits, was no as\lum for her. She had besides refused to enter it, since its gates were shut against me. The Moutrevor family had requested her to pass some time with them : from the humanity of the iuvitation 1 was con¬ vinced it came from Lady M., and I urgt d her to accept it, while I pursued my inqui¬ ries after Miss P. and her wretched para¬ mour. With some difficulty I discovered from the servants that they had taken the direction to Lord Uoschamp's, where, to ?? astonishment, 1 learned that Masseau intended to oiler his services as his valet, till he had an opportunity of going' to
France. There was an inveterate and menial depravity in this that stung me to the soul : fallen as she was, I determined to perish before I would see her living in Lord H/s house as his valet's companion. From any other place I might have sup¬ plicated her to return, and spare her un¬ happy children's shame, but in this 1 wis resolved no force should detain her : my spirit rose to defy him. a thousand vexa¬ tions and insults burned on m ν cheek and ht in my heart. I waited with impatieiiee for morning ; when it arrived 1 desired Sybilla immedi- auly to remove to Montrcvor-House, and roue alone to Lord Rosehimm's— i wished for neither attendant nor witness ; 1 knew I had but one part to act. and I determined to act that without the presence of any one who might be expected or impelled to assist me.

I had not released my hold of Masseau—" Lead me this moment to Miss Percival.** The spirit of his countrymen never forsook Masse ? ; he declared, with contorsions of face and figure which would have been lu¬ dicrous at any o'her time, that a lady who had aceepttd hh a ' tentions should never be betrayed by him to the resentment of her family; such treachery would lie idler be-
come l'homme galant, ni lhomme d'honneur. I was compelled to aggravate my resentment to conceal my laughter. I did not want to crive wav to ludicrous feelings, strongly as the object before me excited them ; it was no time, no subject for mirth· I shook the little reptile almost to pieces; I foamed with fury, 1 swore I would be his death, his instant deatn, if he did not bring me to Miss P·— u Vill.tin, \ ermin, 1 did not come to talk with you, to touch \ou ; if vou don't brjm* me where she is, 1 will ^purn you round the house like a ball till I find her/' But though I threatened, 1 could not hurt him, for I Ht him quiver in my ttrasp, and saw his face grow white: he was old, and feeble, and diminutive. 1 did not want to hurt him or even to parley with him. lie found Î would not be parleyed w ith ; he threw open the door of a small room, from v\hich he appeared to have crept on hear- no- me ; ???

Loi d R. now came up vehemently, defy¬ ing me to box him.

I had thrown off my coat. but was told I must part with more. My
antagonist was flourishing his arms in the ab Ifit shame and respect for my un- happy mother ; my cheek glowed with sc mething beside passion. I called out— '· if tliere be a man among you, let him < HKÌuct that lady away, and take care of lier ; ( ldasseau don't approach her, remem¬ ber what 1 told you) to her other insults it it is not necessary to add the presence of half-naked men mangling each other with blows.' ? This excited some commisera¬ tion for one of us; a decent looking old man took charge of her. 1 don't want to repeat Lord R. s vulgar de¬ fiance; he wasa robust muscular man,ahout thirty, and expert in the only science he hail ever studied. I was a mere hoy to him, either in age or proficiency ; his technical and well-planted blows covered my face μ itli blood in a few u imites ; the siiditoí iteravo me the fury of a tiger ; it was ati unequal combat of skill and Mre.uth against a ieiL ing which was almost more than mortal ; ι 5
shame and rage were my right and left hands, and they fought for me. In a few minutes Τ stretched him on the ground with a blow which left him little inclina¬ tion to renew the contest. I hurried on my clothes; I was sore and staggering, it had been a terrible encounter in point of corpo¬ real disparity and suffering ; but my feeling» gave me artificial and vehement strength. 1 took Miss Percival from her protector, who attempted to wipe the blood from me with his handkerchief, but whom I re¬ pelled, for I wished for no kindness there, Sir John was helping up his friend, who said, in an earnest and painful tone,— " Damme, Sir John, I don't wonder at that young fellow's dashing you to the floor in a moment." " Oh, damme," said Sir John, tí Where's the use of mentioning that now/' I was passing then with Miss Per¬ cival; the servants made a kind of confused movement of opposition, that said, " shall we detain them." u No,
no damme," sai/ ir rude and inso¬ ient, but not unftc. τ master; " He has fought for her like a gentleman, and let him have her ; b v G—d it is more than she's worth ; damme I like the young fel¬ low's spirit; I see it is no flash with him ; he set-to like a gentleman, and by heaven's madesome of the fairest blows 1 ever saw, felt I mean, in my life," Masseau was now ordered to get me some wine in a moment; they saw my pale and bloody face, and the feeble steps which I could not make firm ; I rejected it in silence, but without any insolence of gesture. ic Stay for a carriage at least," said Lord Koschamp, ίς my rascais will get you a carriage in a moment, Masseau order a carriage, you cannot take her away with¬ out one." 1 felt this, and paused, still holding her hand, i thought she pressed it at that moment. Masseau obeyed orders with probably the feeling of Haman when he accompanied Mordecai on his pompous f ?
tour through Persepolis, or Suzar. í leaned my head against a pillar of the hall while the carriage was getting ready ; when it was announced, I put Miss P. into it, and mounted mv horse to attend her. I deter- mined not to enter a vehicle of Lord R/s; my determination however was vain ; I grew dreadfully sick and giddy; my scars and bruises grew sore and burning ; I was weary of the harsh and violent part I had been forced to act ; i longed to be near my mother ; I dismounted and got into the carriage. I leant my throb¬ bing head on her shoulder; the tears forced their way through my closed eyelids; I wept like a child. Wc arrived at Lemon-Grove; I attended my mother toher room ; 1 was glad of theab- sence of Sybilla— í wished to speak to her without restraint, and without painful recol¬ lection ; but 1 was too unwell to attempt it then. My mind and body were feverish and weak ; my struggles had been no common
ones. I was compelled t ) throw myself on mv bed, and there, to m\ aston sh- ment, Sybilla appeared, u itti her tears aud her tenderness, as usual. ίς Why ?»? you not at Montrevor- House, Sybtlla : Î ex¬ pected you to have been under the pro¬ tection of that family in my absence. "'-— She hesitated—she assigned twenty causes, and no reason. I thought of the stately and dazzling Lady Mon tre vor, and of S\ hula's timid gentleness, and recent sad¬ ness, and sought for no other reason. 1 had now obtained something like satis¬ faction. The blow [ had reeewed vves : n some measure expiated, yet stili i felt unmitigably a desire of perilous and san¬ guinary disimi ûon, a pride of shame, an impatience of beina' known or even looked at till ] tiiied an high and daring station winch i was determined to reach or perish, My tempt r was much embittered; I had become jealous, and watchful, and fas¬ tidious. Some mischievous and mortal
stro . g!e ao invasion, a battio, would have been a ' bef to me, where I might have rushed i'. ? ward a Ikltenebros, and re¬ covered my name and knighthood, or bur' ed it in blood for ever. This is not the raving of a romantic or ferocious mind : mine was neither, but it was young, ambitious, and dishonored. The wound ï had received, hke that in the Grecian fable, could only be cured by the weapon that inflictc d it. 1 had not much leisure for meditation, my plan required none; it had been determined on from the time of my father's death. it was now sus¬ pended, however, by the intelligence tliat Miss Percival bad again disappeared from Lemon-Grove: in what direction rie one could discover, but it was supposed net unaccompanied, as Masseau had lei 1 Lord Rose ham p*s. I did not give myself time to breathe my passion ; 1 again mom.ted my horse. alone, and in silence, and traversed the
country for four days in every direction that afforded a chance of discovering them—all was in vain; it had been cither so rapid or so secret, that I might as well have pursued the wind. I returned goaded, inflamed, exhausted, my mind burning with shame, aod my frame with fatigue, disposed to contend with every thing, and with myself, to beard evcy man, and execrate every female I met. I returned to Lemon-grove, which we Ind only a few days longer to occupy ; 1 had charged my sister on quilting it, to ??? herself immediately under Lady Äíoii- trevor's protection ; I was agaia surprized, and even provoked, at finding her alone at Lemon grove. My notions in re¬ gard to women had now become fastidious in the extreme, I dreaded disgrace in another shape. Sybilla's gentleness failed to pacify me—I would not be pacified. I demanded, perhaps with too much harshness, the reason of her persisting m
this silent obstinacy. She was easily in¬ timidated. She told me Mr. 1 Jam mond had forbid her, and her face grew crimson as she spoke. " Mr. Hammond forbid y o u , on w i j a t p re t ex t ? by w h atau th ori ty ? when did he see you ? what right had he ? what opportunity had lie to dictate to you r'' " Oh ! don't be angry with me, dear, dear Ormsby ; you look so wild and so weary, it terrifies me to see you; don't speak harshly to me; your kindness is enough to make me disclose my heart and all within it tc you, but 1 feared to add to vour vexation.*' " \ou are adding to it, adding to it inferably. Sybilla, I doi. t want, tobe harsh to you ; I nm worn and weary, you see 1 am, don't hang on me in this manner, 1 cannot bear it, I cannot bear much more, and from you, Sybilla.* 1 — u Oh ! heaven,'* said the weep¬ ing girl, clinging to mc, " if you shed a tear, it will break my heart: I deserve to have it broke if you shed one. Oh î mv

I was provoked and wearied beyond my strength: I was provoked at being reproached with my obstinacy to Ham- Blond. U is advice might have benefited me, if I would have listened to it.— Weariness and anguish, and contradiction, and fear of aggravated shame, and the suspicion which recent suffering teaches, stimulated me to a false and and impotent strengt Iu I mistook mere seventy for de¬ cision· I thought hasty measures and precipitate resentment were necessaiy for even futili e occasion.

mind, and I pleased myself with exerting an unnatural and tyrannical violence over her reelings and my own. She saw me depart with despair ; she sunk from the sofa on the ground, wringing her hands, and calling me " Cruel,"' with a voice choked with sobs. I was not cruel, but I was assuming an ap¬ pearance of it from which my heart recoi'ed, I tried to believe that circumstances made it necessary, and to perform it without shrinking. 1 was like a defeated general, sullen and sad, and stern, till the opportunity of iccovered honor. But at that moment 1 was actually delirious with incessant pio- vocation and fatigue ; my wanderings, my disappointment, the shame of my mother, the fear of my sister operating on a frame slight and sanguine, festering with heat, and giddy with sleepless fatigue, liad made me as wild and irritable, ς * as sudden »u^ quick in quarrel," as if esery being

ciples; it was a short and painful moment. He told me he was ready to justify himself. AH the company (but himself) were partially iutoxicated; they could not have been more highly regaled than with the scene before them ; there was a general roar of mad bra¬ very and Bacchanalian joy. Hammond's father swore he would notstirfrom the room till he saw his son behave like a gentleman. Pistols were easily procured. The room was nearly forty feet in length.— Someone adjusted the distance. I cared not what it was : I cared not if it was muzzle to muzzle; my only wish was to be thought brave by madmen, and to perish. To such a state can * the world a dread laugh urge a young mind, that lives jn a vicious fear of false shame.' I only remember when the gentleman who loaded my pistol gave it to me, I determined mentally if I killed the only man (except Mr. Corbett) whom I loved on earth, to load it again, and turn its contents on
mvself. We fired : í misseil. Hammond fired his p'Stoi bom the window, and de¬ manded if I was satisfied. The whole room answered iu the athrmntive. 1 loudly exclaimed, u No, î have fned at you, I will not be satisfied till you have returned the fire fairly and directly : 1 did not stand hero to see you fire from a window /* The company now interposed, and in¬ formed me that the laws of combat were completely fulfilled : tliat I had a r^hr, if I insisted on it, to fire again myself, but no right to force another to fire at me. Uam- inoud demanded if I chose to avail myself of my right. The question, the circum¬ stances, were too much for me : my head grew giddy: I uttered, faintly, " í am no coward," and recollect nothing further till I saw Hammond beside me, bathing my temples with water. When he perceived me recovering, he said in a firm tone,* " I have complied with Mr. Bethels re¬ quest, it is therefore fair.he should comply
with mine ; 1 request his presence alom for half an hour." The company retired to another room, and renewed their drink¬ ing the lather insisting that his son should be the fust toast. u Damme/' said he, " if I thought that man or woman could make Gorges act m so devilish spirited a style."

I again supplicated his pardon with childish im¬ portunity; I knew not what to say, or how 7 to praise or sooth him. " My dear Ormsby, it is I who should supplicate jour pardon.

But I was delighted to think that there was still a i>')hd foundation for temporal comfort of which he w as ignorant: 1 h a-tened to inform hun of it. I told him, in mv father's desk had been found notes to the amount ol sis: thousand pounds, ahout eight hundred had been applied to the payment oí his debts, (I coneeah'd M «ss Perci vai4 ha', ing taken thrc'v! hundred nmre.) the remainder, I
told him, was fairly and lawfully his wife's fortune, the interest of which would at 'east maintain him without indigence at the Temple. I was proceeding to evade his inquiries about myself by talking of comfort and happiness, when 1 saw Ham¬ mond's face shaded by incredulity. ï paused : there was a question in my silence — fie answered it. " There, are somosub- j» cts you have forbid me to speak of, but \ou must suffer me to allude to them. ? pt rson who was in Tullumore (about twenty-two miles off) three days past, nu t there a man, who was evidently a foreigner, attempting to get change for lirge notes, none of them less than ¿€300, lie bail a great number of them in hi> hand ; he offered them, in his distress, to evtry one near him; the man, who is my fathers shepherd, lookedover them in the stranger's hand, they were indorsed L. 13. your father's initials, I will make no com¬ ments—1 fear the stranger was Masseau —
í fear j ^u or Sybilla have been plun¬ dered." This last blow, this combination of v"et •and cruelty, almost distraeteti me. í would not believe it till I returned to Lemon-Grove, which I prepared to do in¬ stantly. Hammond forced me to swallow motile wine, and accompanied me. When Sybilla saw us return together, she faint e 1* f wished her insensibility to continue ie\ I found myself mistaken. The first thin:; drat struck mc was the evident traces of violeuceon the lock of mv fathoi's door; \ went in; all was dark and silení; 1 trod lightly and fearfully over the floor, with oth^r feelings thau those of recent solili- tade. it was past midnight; í was in the room of my dead fathei ; the wind was wild ami hiirh, and sobbed around the building iu the tones of an human voice in anguish. í held the li^ht Lwv ; thede«k wan in its u.sual place; 1 opeuctl it· iu <iie «urner of it was a box where ί h..d depu« g 4
sited the notes in presence of Mr. Corbett, my »uncle's agent, &c. &e. I saw paper lying at the bottom; my heart beat with delight; it justified my wretched mother in a moment. I examined the papers; they were two debentures for #£100 each. Sybilla's whole fortune was reduced to this. They had pillaged her of every thing else; they had left her with the bare means of subsistence if she were not the wife of the most honorable of men; they had left her in a state that might have tempted indigence to resign her to shame and destitution. 1 hung in moody misery over this discovery ; the Light fell from my h.md; Hammond rushed in, for he thought i had fallen. I did not seek to conceal it from him. I pointed to the empty box ; but 1 con hi not bring myself to utter my mother's name in a voice of rage and bit¬ terness: the voice of the moment. Sybilla entered timidly ; she knew not what had passed; 1 looked at him with a face of •».meal and a'onv· lie answered it like Αι Ov

We sat up the remainder of the night; I listened to them talking of ti eir plans, and revolved my own in silence. From a stock comparatively large, I might have condescended to borrow for an im¬ mediate exigency ; I might have su (Tered the wealthy heiress to equip me for my expedition ; but to live on the scanty pit tance of an indigent sister; to resume my own gift—the idea, even in silence, op¬ pressed my breath, and tinged my cheek with fire. 1 determined to be first " steeped in poverty toth' very lips. 1 ' I determined that in preference " I would try to dig, and to beg would not be ashamed.'" After some deliberation, Hammond determined to remove his wife to an aunt?, who lived «t some distance, a respectable woman» ? Ò
whose' society was decorous, if nol desir* able. They then pressed, with jealous importunity, to learn my plans ; 1 devised .something hke a plausible scheme, and omied ? -ide to conceal the tear their affec¬ tion wrung from me.

But S\ billa wa^ not deceived ; she hung upon me with the ineİiuch'iîy fondness ofone w ho knew I had euncealeJ my purpose, and that purpose was to leave lier. In the morning a note arrived from Lady M. pressing, i u pol i te > but not solicitous terms, her removal to Montrevor-House. Svbiíla kft the room
to answer it in the negative. I was e\* jaiining some papers relating to the umit* satire of Lemons/rove, which we were to give up the following week, but the temi» tation of lines traced by that haml with¬ drew my eye ; they were the last that 1 should probably see of \vi\ 1 took up thi note which by billa liad kft; 1 was alone. í kissed it; as I examined the beautiful characters, 1 perceived the lines were un¬ commonly wide; it suggested a wild thought I had read of h tiers written illegibly without the assistance ef fire. Ï held it to the uve in hope and fear: other characters appeared How 1 devoured these words : c; ? friend of Mr. Hethels is much concerned at the late unhappy circumstance of the family; she ha<* heard much that she laments, and much that she refuses to believe; she entreats Mr. Be¬ thel not to adopt, in future, the wild and fu ιΊ 'Ίο conduct he has done.

She fears he has some intention of quitting the cotmtry; should he require Tortunatus's gifts for bis adventutc, the fairy Good-will can supply him, if he will attend the spot which she visits by moon* light in Montrevor-Park JJ> Precious, pre¬ cious hues! I locked the door with childish jealousy to read them undisturbed. 1 poured over them the first warm and gracious tears that had refreshed my seared eves for many days. To gain the sympa¬ thy, the solicitude of an human being, however remote, however interesting, is balm to the wounds, and down to the weariness of a vexed and struggling spirit; but to be thought of by her, whose thought had never quitted me, to have the heart of feeling beat, the cheek of beauty pale for
me, I could, at that moment, have borne, have dnved anv thing. To a man u^t conscious of pusillanimity, the thought of a beautiful woman gives more than the courage of nerve or constitution : to a man not humbled by vice, the regard of a beautiful woman gives resistless freedom and animation. I could not believe mv- self resigned to evil, yvhile an angel hovered over me, shedding light on my path, and hope on my heart. 1 resigned myself to dreams of feli¬ city and honor : see her I dared not, for I dreaded that it might look like a consent to pecuniary obligation at which she had hinted; 1 dreaded that her fears might prevent my quitting the coun¬ try; above all 1 dreaded that she might know I was rushing into a world of hard¬ ship and adventure, friendless, unaided, unknown» I resolved she should never know it. I shrunk from the weakness of complaint, the degradation of assistance; yet to acknowledge my destitution would
be like complaint, like supplicating assist¬ ance; und if I saw \iei\ it w oidd. be im¬ possible to conceal, lhat of all the chiidru) of peril and ad\ enlme, í was lhe mobt destitute.

When î bid Sybilla farewell for the night, 1 tried
to prevent my voice faultering, in vain; but she was weary and heavy with many days of sorrow, and did not perceiveit. I was glad of it : it was no moment for softness.

Between v, eakucss and supplication he fell to the ground ; he called after me ; I would not hear him; this discovery was so like a vile collusion, a pLa to be brought back, and consoled and pi evaded on to stay ; the thought nave me wun»s, vet still í heard his voice at intervals : it pierced my heart. '* Oh ! don't be cruel to your w eary, affec¬ tionate old friend, who has wandered so many dark, lone miles.*' Iu the pauses
of the I wind, í thought I heard him mention my uncle, and twice I heard him, say " Yon are cruel to yourself—-to vour- .self;*'—but I was soon beyond all re¬ proaches but my own. This incident had compelled me to change my direction : 1 turned from Montrevor-1 louse,from which lights twinkled through the trees. The last look at the walls yvhieh inclosed her> the lingering near her yvindosv ubile light lingered there, the guessing at a shadow, and blessing the spot where its last trace had disappeared, all that I had fed palling love and melancholy with, was now im¬ possible. In this directii«! 1 was again encountered by a figure yv Inch was moving rapidly in the ronl before me. 1 trusted to the darkne^ of the niant to condal me, but it could not conceal it ltom me. It was the re- markable figure l hayo ?И*>?? mentionod the inhabitant of the solitary t*o\cr. \ had Ucmi wild taie^ of bun : 1 Ik ard that he
wandered about the country all night, hke ionie unhallowed and restless thing. llis appearance seemed to realize all that could be told or imagined of him.

spurred my horse. There w T as something about this strange being, that while it in¬ spired terror, inspired confidence. Ila ap¬ peared to hold on his melancholy way through hfe, as he did when I met him, alone and in darkness, without a purpose of evil to any thing human, with nothing human in his purposes. I did feel my spirits quelled. This strange and lonely greeting, the time, the place, the language he held, deepened the melancholy shade of m\ mind almost into terror, yet 1 o\e- pared to follow him more passively under its influence. " You are mounted," said he: "all the speed I could make on foot mighi be fribtle-j , fly to the castle, and save \our uncles life.** llis last wouis relaxed the spell of tenor which was creeping over me. Iherc was an cai nest impulse like humanity iu his words, that dispersed all the \isionary shatlows that flitted round ti« f Öne strung i', cling laugh t within me a* I nbhed along—to
*>nter those doors which 1 was told never to enter, and perhaps at the suggestion of a madman. But every thing vanished at the idea of my uncle's danger, for once I was not the victim of false and vicious shame. The castle was about half a mi!e dis¬ tatiti that distance I had passed as a step. As long as 1 could see any thing, I saw the figure following me. All around the castle was still and quiet: 1 heard nothing but the sighing of the trees that waved to a pale, and wintery moon, and the croak of the raven from the shattered turrets. I crossed the court-yard ; the doo- whom 1 remembered to be uncom- mouly fierce, did not stir. I was sur¬ prized at this, but as I passed him, I ob¬ served he lav motionless, and was wallow- ing m his blood. As 1 approached, no h»ht appeared any where but in Father C'usaeks window; it was a narrow fìothic easement. I saw the light streaming through a few stained compartments in it :
it yvas his oratorv windoyv ; the Cri fiam had assigned him that apartment, because the window yvas coloured yvith th» 1 fiume of his pai nm saint, il is own apartment was just belo vv the colitelo r's, but from tliat there was neither f light nor sound.'— The erreat door í fovmd shut; I was obliired to ero round the building, to enter by another, which, cotmiiunicating with the servants' apartments, was hoquented by strang/ r, and traveller, ai.d mendicant, and always (»pen. The p;^a£e was completely daik, it emh-l in a uanow spiral stairca^- that led to my ?? h: "s room. í -¿s- eeeded li ìi^htly ; the jierfcct sih lice mat le in« 1 í\^, 1, almost unyulhiig to proceed. Th.erc vas ï. ) tiare t f danger or disturb- ance. As 1 paused r-.t the arch* d dour that h d io n.y micie*- room, I began to feel hhame ;ιί the parsii em ss vyith yvhieh 1 had muh naken this Piange commission, and cast a glance of vacant inquiry into the room—it was large and dark j the lighi
burning on a black marble table, scarcely showed the book ami ciucitix on it. and utterly failed to penetrale the recesses into whieh the extremities of the room were hollowed. As I still looked, I thought a sha¬ dow seemed to be projected from one oi them : it was the shadow of aman. I looked intently; it was withdrawn, as if it observed me; I withdrew too; it was the light of shadows. Our motions (if the figure had moved) were accompanied by no sound, and scarcely visible, as dim and iiittiuyr as the licht that struggled faintlv w ith the darkness around us ; but in the next moment deception was impossible. Ihe tall dark figure of a man visibly crossed the room, aud stood bv mv uncle's bed. .Mv breath forsook mc. It was like the gliding of a spectre. 1 advanced into the room. The figure seemed to pause a moment, and then IbrcibK, but silently, threw itself on the bed. I heard mv uncle
groan. I was beside him in a moment. He was scarce awake, and wholly unable to resist. The ruffian had grasped him by the throat with the force and fury of a fiend. The struggle must have terminated in a few moments. His face was black, and his eyes prominent, and his breath suspended already. I had no time for de¬ liberation ; 1 threw myself on the man; I seized him by the throat; I tried to drag him from his victim. The danger of suf¬ focation made him relax his hold, but he turned on me in a moment, lie had the strength of Hercules, ifc fastened on nie with the faints and fierceness of a tia^ur.— By the quickness with which he turned he had completely the superiority. 1 had not consulted my ow n safety in the posture 1 had assumed when í threw mvself on him —1 was entangled in the curtains. X fül; he had me under him in a moment, one knee on my breast, his finders half on my lips, half on my throat: his giant
limbs so twisted in mine, that Ì thought I felt my bones crushing with the weight and motions. The strucclo was now for life, but Τ had no means of struggling. I could not heave his enormous weight fromme; 1rs purpose was evidently to strangle me. It is an horrid termination of life.— í did not lose my faculties: I did not bsv my horror of ihe death ; 1 felt all its bitter¬ ness— die suppression of my breath, the labouring and convulsions of my elusi, the *body flashes that seemed lo dart from my eyes, and lastly, eviry object of the ..icht swimming before mo, and every o'si· wiih blood-streaked ani '»bu 'mu: ? nihat stared on mo; and my tormentor changed mio a f;end, who.*.-» bulk was like that of a mountain, w hose talons were tipped with barn in«?- iion, and who^e monrh aiidru- breathed ilanies into mine— ir ?\? an hor- li i bie airo ην. Long after î was rescued from lrm, vol, ii, ?
and felt that it was my uncle and Father Cusack who were holdi no: my hands, and blessing, and thanking, and weeping over me, I still tried to twist my¬ self from them, and s-iiì. though 1 knew their voices and their touch, 1 implored them to take their fingers from my throat. It is difficult to tell of the confusion of ¡■»ν and terror, and inquiry and wonder. 1 could hear or tell nothing distinctly,— My uncle, though alive, was spcechle·?, and unable to assist himself or me. Father Cusack, who was; at his devotions, had been alai mcd by the noise of my fall, and had hastened down. The rufiian, scared by steps anda light, ^prui;*· from mc wheu Lo ledd almost accomplished his purpose, dud escaped before the servants were roused 10 pursue him.

The assassin escaped, and with him the name of his employer. The Chieftain yvas utterly ignorant of his enemy : he declared he did not know ihat being on earth to whom he had given; citu>e of hatred or revenge, and in the sim¬ plicity of his heart ascribed the attempt made on him to frenzy. i( It was not one of my own people,** said he, shaking his white locks, " that wished to take my hie away; the father of that mis-begotteu ruíhan Murtagh v. as an Englishman, who was hung for /ubbery at Phiiipstown As- s.zes, and his son for pride took his mother's name, I much doubt if e\en her family was -Milesian.

THE When he had sacrificed to his nationality, he sacrificed to his gratitude; he poured out a torrent of the eloquence of gratitude and affection.

My heart warmed to the thought of you, when I heard you had made yourself a beggar for your mother and sister, and the tears ran down my face though I thought ï was hiding them. They were so plea¬ sant to me that I would not deny them. w' But when I heard how you had knocked down that paltry English peer, and fought young Hammond for looking at your stöter, I went to my oratory and kissed the cross upon it that vou should have all

Then my heart felt as light within me as if i was a boy again, or marching to my iirst engagement, or getting the first glimpse of my father's house after my wanderings were over.

De Lacv is red on your cheek, the blood of De Lacy is warm m your heart, and whde mine beats, every vcm of it shall quicken to you as its jov and desire/* When wc had leisure toob-erve intiitfer- cut things, Father Cusack remarked how providential my presener· had been, as Deloraine had been absent fiom v.ie castle on a visit for the last week, lie then, though it was not yet m >???\ doclaicd his intention of visiting the d\mg woman, and learning the name, ???;?? she 1 had refused to disclose but in confession. With him went the stranger, whom, when his tale was told, no impo-.tunities could detain even for a moment, lie declined them, and the gratitude of the Chieftain, to whom his person was unknown, with a kind of sullon ciulity, a melan, holy ab¬ straction of mind that seemed to take no joy in any thing earthly, that paused from ts dark progress but for a moment, and then renewed it ? silence.
The remainder of the night was passed by the servants of ihe castle in raising.the ibl- lovvcrs and tenantry to scour the country, and in examining the passages and doors of the castle through which he liad pro¬ bably entered n n percei ved m the evening, and concealed himself for an opportunity ol'murder: they were dark and winding, and the servants passed along them fear¬ fully even by day. The Chieftain and 1 vit up the remaiuder of the night; over¬ powered by his- affection, the suden re¬ serve which pride and shame and romantic distress had taught me, vanished. 1 told him all my wild purpose 1 told him I was going as a private soldier, to recover the character of courage and spmt which, though I had lost, 1 felt 1 could not live without. His eye kindled while he lis¬ tened, I told him I was going without friend or money or recommendation; among a people who knew nothing of me; who were unfavorable to strangers,
and among whom I expected to undergo all that could be suffered from ignorance and poverty and suspicion, lie wept. But wheu I told him (as I told him the truth) that hardship and poverty and pain and labor severe to a youthful frame, and discipline hateful toa proud and fastidious mind, were all as the dust of the balance when weighed against the hope of ac¬ quired honor, or, at least of vindicated courace; that I could bear to fi«ht in the ranks, that I could bear to perish in them, but could not bear to be thought a coward ; when I told it to a mind congenial to my own, a high, romantic mind, on whose originality the world had not been suffered to encroach, in whom age could not ex¬ tinguish the love of courage, and solitude and pride had fed the wilducss of its spirit—he smote his old and trembling bands together, arid in the language of a part of scripture with which all catholics are ramiliar, exclaimed " The L — rd do 3
so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.*" With the morning arrived the priest and Mr. Corbett; the sick woman was dead be¬ fore the former had rearhed her cabin; the latter, who had received a commission from the Chieftain, had set out on it that eventful night ; his affection would not suffer him to delay it till morning. lie feared the wild and restless spirit that was working within me; he feared what the night might pro¬ duce, after my shaking him ofl* so roughly. He had proceeded to Lemon-Urove, to rouse the servants, and tell them the direc¬ tion I had taken. There S) bi í kts distress detained him till the intelligence of the night, which was dispersed over the coun¬ try by the servants who were in ciiase of the ruffian, had reached and soothed them. With the morning, too, came Deloraine, and Hammond, and Sybilla. In the face of the former, though unconscious of any wrong I had done hii», I blushed to
look. The wavering favor of the ? hieb tain, the misery of a man suspended be¬ tween vicissitudes of opulence and in¬ digence, and plunged into the latter by a concurrence of accidents working in favor of one who appeared remote from- all competition, touched nv> to the ????: vet when 1 rawed my eyes to his face, I saw such a cheerful and unfeigned greeting there, an honest surprize, with¬ out any exaggerated expression of joy, but neither darkened by suspicion nor malevolence, that 1 could hardly forgive myself for the injury I had done in sus¬ pecting such a mind of seìJìshncss and relucíante. That day and many days were devi »ted to domestic fondue««* í l o long interrupted, wo marvellous ? \ί η ^\ ed. Sybilla was the mistres« of our little circle ; Hammond had suspende ' his movements for a few days, that her absence might not diminish our joy, and my uncle appeared as well
^leased with his nephew as he could with one whose grandfather he remembered to have been an English settler,*and steward to the gentleman whose property he had purchased. My uncle, my sister, Ham- nvud, Deloraine, Mr. Corbett, whose tempered maimer, and humble and moni¬ tory joy, threw a chaste and holy light over the warm groupe of \o\e and triumph, and congratulating—what a circle—my heart, chased and * ounded as it had been, ex¬ panded its plumage, and smoothed its down, and warmed its breast among them. Two days past 1 was a wanderer, friend¬ less and destitute, struggling for hopeless distinction, and desiring only to be justified and die. 1 was now the acknowledged heir of an ample fortune, surrounded by all that affection and liberality could pio- *mre ; softened by aßection, exalted by praise, my path strewed with wealth, and my prospects bright with distinction. It would be absurd, it would be falseia
represent myself as unmoved by this splen* did vicissitude ; i was not. I was almost giddy with my elevation, I looked down ai>d saw in early youth, all that ambition toils tor, and age reposes in, spread at my feet. With the ardour of youth I looked on my promised wealth only as the means of procuring happiness to those who need» ed or wno valued it more. I resolved to compensate largely to Debraine for tlie injury 1 had done him, I resolved to assist the firm and proud- minded Hammond, and 1 debated by whtì* expedient best to combine munificence with secresy, and divest my benefactions of ostentation and invidiousuess; but when 1 had scattered wealth and happiuess around me, when in mv mind's eve 1 saw everv face fluslud with jov, and every heart laughing with plenty, I hist began to feel my own mi>ery ; my real and utter misery. For me there was no happiness ; i had no partner to take by the hand; no companion to sit myself down un·
der my vine and fig-tree; no bosom to lean my head on, and whisper the secret of communicated happiness. I was now almost eighteen ; I had ar¬ rived at the ajre when it is impossible not to love : that 1 loved, I felt too well, but Idtd not dare to whisper to myself whom L loved, Λ romantic and unhappy passion unacknowledged, unexplored, and unex¬ tinguished, threw a sombrons and visionary hue upon alî the colours of life. The bright hours of youth were sicklied over with the pale cast of love ; yet still it was rich and lovelv, and wild as the moon- beam stealing through a cloistered window, and tinging the haunt of solitude and me¬ lancholy with lights and forms move vivid and glorious than anv thing reality could show—-as the fairy light which the traveller follows for joy of its solitary beauty along the waste, and to the precipice. í knew the precipice I was approaching ; yet still I told myself there was no danger, or if
there were, it was more than balanced bv the pleasure. 1 tried to assume confidence m mv own resolution ; I tried to have confidence in Lady Montrevor ; her dig¬ nity, her purity, her sudden change of voice and mind and character, her easy vindication of herself, her natural assump¬ tion of real and inherent virtue, all came to my mind, and along with all came her beauty» I struggled and debated, and at last wearied b ν a struggle, which showed me too much the weakness of my mind, determined it would be savage and un¬ grateful to quit the country without thank¬ ing the only one who had thought of me with compassion ; that I must at least offer my thanks or the consideration with which she hacì honoured mc, and xf sin: to whom I was (hus indebted was mcjp beautiful than anv thins; I had ever beheld .; it was no crime in her, nor in me, ii 1 gazed on such beauty, when admitted into her presence.
The opportunity was not long delayed ; Lord Montrevor, the moment he heard of my restoration to my uncle's favor, drove his splendid equipage to the castle to ex¬ press his sincere pleasure at the happy termination of the late events, &c. &c. &c. and ever attentive to forms, her ladyships and Miss Montolieits tickets came to visit m v sister as Airs. Hammond. Even this v' ciicumstance, as if " all the social powers had shed their influence o'er us," seemed to assume the most favourable auspices. Hammond's father, whose fault was not indifference to women, and was captivated by Sybil la's softness, loudly declared his approbation of his son's choice, and swore no marriage ever prospered that there was not a duel or two about it. Alv uncle had announced bis intention of giving an entertainment on declaring me bis heir, to which even the English peers were to he. invited ; but this was anticipated by an invitation from Moutrevor-liouse. The
interval, till its acceptance, was a restless time with me—a time of reproach and congratulation, and hopes and fears. On the eve of it a circumstance occurred, that did not diminish mv agitation. There was a girl at the castle, whom I had often observed not mingling with the rest of the domestics, nor appearing to have any employment but that of sitting in one of the turrets and reading all day. She had ail the beauty of youth and nature, a warm tinge on her cheek, and dark sunny eyes, and a wild animation of expression, such as health and spirits, and iucultivated in¬ telligence give to a face not " taught to look by rule.** I was interested by her appearance, and more by her studious habits. I inquired who she was; I learnt she was an illegitimate daughter of one of the chieftains younger brothers. This description of persons are usually em¬ ployed asservants in the families to which they belong. The Chieftain, however,
hud other notions of family pride, or fe¬ male deficacy. I approached her with more respect, I inquired into her studies; I wished to learn the effect of books on a mind left so much to its own choice and direction. Her answers, in spite of the gaucherie of tone and manner, indicated a mind of no mean powers, wild and play¬ ful, and fantastic ; but with something of delicate and ambitions and recherché, that marked the sex of her mind. A pursuit of fine and fastidious elegance, a pining for something which she had not yet found in the books or conversation she could pro¬ cure ; an aspiration after the beau ideal of a picturesque and plastic mind, made this 101 lorn girl appear to be more interesting than her beauty could have made her. Her style of books was wretched ; some tawdry volumes of Romish lives and le¬ gends, some of the luscious poetry of Charles the Second's time, a great many plays, and no history, no biography, no
travel«, &c. &c. 1 lent her some ????? which Mr. ? bad supplied me with, and of which I requested her to give mean account, Ì was anxious for her improvement— I knew not what I was doing—she w r as too «rrateful to her instructor. 1 was utter- ly unconscious that she preferred my com¬ pany for any reason but that which made me choose hens. Vain men are easily per¬ suaded that they are beloved ; but I could not be vain, for what would have caused vanity to others, was only vexation of spirit to me. My father, who had been eminent for personal advantages in his youth, was emi¬ nent for his jealousy of them in age, and any allusions to my rapid growth or my stature, were sure to tinge his mind with spleen for the rest of the day. When w ? went out he had always some pretext for recommending me to wear boots; 1 could not cross the room, or lean against the wall, or sitin any posture, without some
allusions to au Hercules Farnese, or an Apollo Belvedere; and at dinner i w u«? always desired to remove my chnir, and not amuse myself by contrasting those fine formed limbs, of which I wa«* so vain, with limbs shi¡veiled bv disease. This persecution, though it often mad* 1 me f i el as if I was seated on a ehan of hot iron. had at least one beneficiai teudencA. no one could be more· uneutwmus, or more contendedly so of advantages who^o men¬ tion was always accompanied with pain, í say this merely to account for an insen¬ sibility which might othenviüü appear un¬ accountable I dreamt not of any girl's falling in love with mc because 1 spoke to her in a voire of softness and complacency, because 1 pitied her solitude, and because that soli¬ tude was uninterrupted but by me. There was another security for my indifference ; ï believe, from experience, I believe drat nothing can exalt the mind more vol. π. ι
above the ordinary solicitations of sense, than a concealed attachment to some ob¬ ject lofty and remote, like mine : some¬ thing that renders the feelings fastidious by its exquisiteness, and purifies desire by its dignity. Such was the state of my affections ; and when my pupil would repeat tome passages from poetry 1 supplied her with, 1 never noticed her preference of the im¬ passioned ones, nor the warm and speak¬ ing comment of her eye and her lip. On t\w nicht of mv intended departure, sin di-appeartd from the castle, and was fom davs uiu \ discovered returning voluntarily. s' ? p.t, and díj'Vted ; she gave no account oi ík r absence or its motives, and all uo- t.v'e of it was forgotten in more importan 5 t 'ungs. Several d ?y» after, when my mitul had uspirid from its latt* símales, πι pacing through the cattle, 1 saw h< r i-ealcd in the little tmret. reading as usuah but nei as usual blooming, and wild, and 4
warm : my heart smote mc with the self¬ ishness of my neglect; I wtut m; she was much altered, her hand shook as it held the book; she did not raise her head as I entered, but said in a low voice t ς; You have deserted me thK long while, and ï am dad of it." She inclined her head still more as she spoke ; ï took the hand that was hanging* listlessly beside her; it was cold and damp; she tried to withdraw it ; I saw a tear fall on the book at which, it was evident, >he was noi looking. " I have not deserted you, dearest Mary ; 1 have been υη pleasantly circumstanced ; I have had much to strug« rie with, almost too much ior me, but. now"*—She lucked earnestly at me, and siid -* : Have you —I hcatd vou had—Oh C'hr-sl î what hearts they h id that eould ciake you su fier—il it was such as me, ihey would have been welcome to it a dtuusand and a thousand times; but did *»4ì svi tT r m π ch ?'* sa-M she, her voice i L»

1 could not resist her importunity ; 1 pro¬ mised I would. As 1 left tho turret, she said, " If you should hear me talking to myself as )ou come,don't listen to mo/* The day was a restless one to me, 1 believe there is no man with the feelings of one, to whom an innocent girl con¬ fesses her love for him, that docs not feel pain from the discovery; the d i derence of rank and habits, a thousand circumstances contending with aifcction and gratitude, make it almost impossible to act at once hke a man of honor, and a man of feeling. That whole day 1 dared not repeat the name of Mary to imself ; every eye that I met seemed to reati my mind ; t\ie very consciousness of being: loved trave a dow and a flutter to my frame, that would bave been ridiculous in any one, but one who was told for the first time that a woman lo\cd him. Vow men retain either dieir modesty or their timid and bo\ ish respect for females: till my age. I had t ?
both these qualities in most painful per¬ fection, and a trembling inexperience of danger in what I was doing, that almost obstructed my breath as I reached the ruins. It was evening, the pale light that Alary loved : she was sitting on the tomb¬ stone; she was not singing, not a sound issued bom her lips; she leaned her cheek upon one hand, the other, from which her book had dropped, hung listlessly among the weeds that sprung ibrough the crevices of the stone; she pulled and scattered them to the wind. I had intended to speak to her—to speak to her tenderly and firmly, to reason with her if possible, and if not, at least to sooth her. I had strengthened my mind by the recollection of Hammond's example, and of Mr· Corbe t ts principles; I had in som« mea¬ sure collected my ideas ; I had made some¬ thing hke a speech, but this sight scat¬ tered it. When I saw a sweet and inno¬ cent girl wasting with unhappy passion, becoming melancholy and pale, and wild.
haunting the house of the dead in her sadness, and almost like one of them her¬ self, a gush of pity and sorrow filled my heart and my eyes; I sprung to her side, to her feet— " Mary, dear Mary, if you love me, overcome this melancholy, this dejec¬ tion, it is destroying you, it is making me wretched; what cani do to vanish it? tell me, what I can do ? and raise your head, and smile on me as you used to do*" I spoke from my heart, and from the mo¬ ment, at that moment, I would have thought no sacrifice too great to obtain tranquillity for her : to diffuse over her face one of the smiles with which it was lit in her happy hours of health and quiet. The action and the impulse were so un¬ expected, they must have surprized her ; yet her mind was so intently pursuing the thought that occupied it, that she did not answer me, but herself. " Are you angry with me for reading plays r J ' " I am giad yon have spirits to amuse yourself by %
reading, my love, but there are few plays which 1 would recommend to you : they represent the passions in such exaggerated language." " Particularly love, 0 said she; " they talk as if there was nothing but love in the world, and I believe there is very little—very little true love 1 am sure, don't you think so?" " I—I know nothing of love yet, Mary ; we are too young for love." <c But may n t we speak of it?" " Certainly." iW Well, then, do you think it possible that a woman could die for love, as the plays say ? Here is a book which was borrowed from the ser¬ vants at Montre vor- House, and it tells such a story of a poor girl, a poor ignorant humble girl, who went mad for love, and followed her cruel-hearted love for many a mile, and just came up when he was married, and a king, and great and miser¬ able, for he had been fond of her when he was young, and not proud or high, and bis heart smote him when he found his
neglect had killed her." She took up the hook ; it was Miss Bailie's plays ; she turned to the tragedy of " Kthwald," and ??;??? to read some passages from it with the wildest vehemence of manner and voice. " See here what she says, poor Hertha, and yet, though he was niel, she followed him—followed him r and know him in spite of madness and -orrow—see what she says : ς Γ ve seen ι hee on the gathering clouds of eve, ride with the stately spirits of the storm ; IVe Meard thy voice sound from the dark hill's -de, and followed thee.' Yes, I followed \ou through night and darkness, when I •»«-ard you were going I followed you. I umuot speak like Bertha, but L haveas íme an heart, and I followed with love I we her; and if 1 could havo met yon, I uould have begged to be your servant, »nd i would have served you with such ue and humble love, no one should have \ proached us, or said a poor girl could
not have an high heart. And when I heard you were come back, and in the castle a?ai;i, though I felt it like the blow of death on my heart, I uever shed a tear, or said a word ; for though I would have kept near you in your distress, I shall never go near you now that you are the heir of the great De Lacy : and 1 came home again, and would tell no one why I went away,for fear it would bring shame to you/ 5 Every word she utttered ivas (to use her own words) like a blow on my heart. I knew not what 1 said ; coldness would have been a crime. I soothed, I kissed her: my tears fell warm on her cheek—" Mary, I am not worthy of this tenderness, repress it, for both our sakes ; ît tears me to pieces to think I can make no return, but this kiss; but these dan¬ gerous, dangerous indulgencies —Mary, spare me, let me go, let me die, but spare me your distress—your auction— they injure us, they may injure us beyond
reparation. I can make no return that they deserve, and,"— u No, no, I know you can make no return, no more than the knig when Bertha came and found he was ^oing to be married to a great princess/' She laughed and wept bitterly. " When Hertha saw the princess on her wedding- day, sitting on a throne, and looking like a star in heaven, she says, c thou art a fair dame, and a gay'—she was obliged to praise her beauty, but the« she says she had such a proud and haughty look, and bide her take her eyes off her ; that's just like me ; many a day I watched on the road for her carriage, and watched—and watched till I was cold and shivering with the wind and rain, and still my heart burnimr. within me like a coal of fire ; and at last, when 1 saw her carriage coming, I fixed my eyes upon it till they were dim again looking for her, but when 1 saw her— blessed Virgin—she is the most beautiful creature the sun ever shone on : her
cheeks are like the first roses that blow in the garden ; and her sweet, proud smile, aid her glorious look, oh ! she looked hke a queen on her throne, and I could have shrunk into the turf 1 stood on, and í felt hke a withered weed on it ; vet she has a proud look ; she would not tell her love I am sure to any man ; í am sure she could not love truly, nor patiently, nor hide a broken heart, if it pleased him she loved to break her heart ; no, she CdU make no return. That fine lady you follow ; and the princess in the play did not make the king happy though he for¬ sook his first love to follow her; but some men will not bo warned." IJer words distraete d me, it was Árpiidé of m\ heait that its secret was unknown ; even unui who loves truly is thus proud and afraid of his secret. Her name í never uttered myself: I could not bear that it should be uttered by ordinary mouths. An hiút I could not have borne ; a jest I
: «/aid ??? cr have forgiven, iler image wa£» minsled in mv miud with every idea of ? utility, and purity, and jealous trembling privacy ; and all was disclosed to a jca- \'?-<? whieh nothing couhl escape, and a \'gikmce to which love had giveo sob«* »•ilude. I knew not what to ??? ; 1 would not d '¿¡»honour Lady M. hy i n trea t ing her mercy—1 would not dishonor myself bv concealing the truth. I was proud of my /hulings., though I trembled at their dis¬ covery, " Mary, you perplex, you dis- tress me, by allusions which neither of us understand. I cannot be i u Jove, where I cannot hope. I do not love Miss Mon¬ tolieu ; 1 ought not to lo\e Lady Mon- trevor.*" " Why?" said she, simply— <ς ^'iìe \? d married woman."* Ci And can iionclovo but those uho are married? í have heard my father was never married i.» my mother/ 1 She was leading me toa dangdous explanation; but the feelings e awoke preserved me from danger.

We are both destitute, and fatherless and motherless, why can't we sit down and comfort each other? 1 would not heed the vt hole world if 1 had you. I would have enough if we lived under these ruined walls for ever. But they will take you from me, and never, never iove you as I do.' 1 She was sitting. 1 knelt beside her; I pressed her cold wet cheek tomine ; I wiped away her tears; 1 could only utter inarticu¬ late sounds of soothing ai*d affection.— " This, this," said she, m the softness of the moment, "this is what ruined me.

Whatever flatters mc with a longer stay among my Irish friends, and forms an additional attraction to their society, must be peculiarly gratifying even in specula¬ tion to f iady M. and me. This room, foi instance, which commands a view of t tit.

" Impossible,' 1 said she, turning round, " impossible to live without hearing Mr, Bethels name, or hearing any thing but his name. Mr. Bethel, you would have conferred eternal obligations on the coun¬ try by giving them something to speak of, if vou had «liven them anv thing else to do bui to praise. However, if silence can be elofpjpnre in love, your friends and lovers have done jon ample justice. As lor me, nothing ran make mc silent but the want of language adequate to my feelings—a want which is the first í ever acknowledged with pleasure.** Let any man imagine himself assailed by sucii language from the lips he loves; lan¬ guage so rich with pride and pleasure; and her countenance so radiant with beauty ami benİLoiilv. kindling into eloquence; every glance of her eje, every omul oí" lier voice mighi have made an hou·. Mv heart was filled with awe and animation, as if at tlie sound of a trumpet, i wou'd
have knelt to ht r, Γ would have kissed her hand. Lord M/s voice awoke me from a dream of madness and delight—" No one was more deeply impressed with a sense of Mr. B.'s distinguished conduct on the recent occasion than himself, but he knew that " on beauty's tongue dwelt accents pleasing to the brave and bold/* and he consigned the pleasant oííicc of eulogist to her ladyship." The entrance of more company was useful to us alb A« 1 mixed anions them to pay my respects to M^s Montolieu, 1 was struck by the change in her appear¬ ance; alwavs pale and pensive, she now resembled the princess in the fairy tales, whose heart was buried in a mountain ot snow; so languid, so abstracted, she scarce seemed conscious of the words that stole, like the breathings of the Eolian harp, from her halfopen lips, and the unmixed and bloodless whiteness of her skin p: m- fully contrasted the rouge which, since she ? ;5
appeared in company, she thought it propre to assume. It was late; and as only ihe Argand lamps on the chimney-pieces were lit, the groups that filled the room were indistinct ; 1 hardly could believe my eyes when 1 saw among them Mr. Corbett. I confess the truth, I did not see him with plea¬ sure. 1 had devoted my feelings to an in¬ dulgence which his presence checked and interrupted. I was ashamed he should witness, I was afraid he would discover it. I was in a fairy-land of pleasure, an Island of Calypso, and I wished for one night to be without a Mentor. I dreaded him; for with apostolic simplicity of man¬ ner, and purity of mind, he combined a knowledge of the human heart, a power of observation deep and accurate, beyond what his opportunities or his attention to life seemed to allow. " You are sur¬ prized to see me here; I was equally sur« prized myself when 1 first received a re-
quest to visit MontrevorJIouse. I knew how a Parson Adams usually fared at a squire's house, but when 1 heard that the request Ind originated with you, 1 no longer declined going, and my first recep¬ tion was such as to make me consider vveiy succeeding visit a duty." The shade concealed the flush of pleasure which mounted into my face while I lis¬ tened to him. 1 did not wish him to know how deeply, too deeply, i was inter¬ ested in Ids account. We were now be¬ hind an enormous candelabrum, vvho^e height would have concealed Said. He spoke without reserve—" 1 entered this house with little hope but of preserving myself from contempt, and retiring ; 1 conceived it. my duty, however, for per¬ haps 1 was the only one wdio would repre¬ sent to his lordship the necessitous and deplorable state of the greater part of his tenantry. I knew the liberal and public spirit of many of the English nobility; 1 ? 4·
lv new many of them were then glorious v bent on improving the human soil of theii country; I knew d there were men on earth intent on cultivating the morals and minds of the lower orders, and providing ibr the temporal and spiritual " comforts of lhe poor,*' they were the great people I have mentioned. I hoped one of them might have " wandered heaven-directed 7 to us. I fear 1 was mistaken. Lord M. is a man of the world, and I believe merely a man of the world. His whole heart and soul seem immersed in the mighty littlenesses of vanity and grandeur. 1 fear there is still a darker depth in his character. Few men are so fond of the reputation or ostentation, I should say of virtue, that il tri not feel it necessary to pacify the world or themselves. lie wishes to be considered as a man equally splendid in rank and taste and morals. He showed the utmost impatience when I mentioned the subject to him first: we
were alone. The next day there was a large party at his table; I dmed there; he made me repeat my whole detail again, the ïesult of many wars melancholy ex¬ perience; interrupted me with commenis that at least displayed the whole theory of benevolence; listened to various plans for the relief of the general state of the ???? in this country; then proposed his ou iu which really displayed the perfection of >.'gacity and munificence; ??? when «ill t lie company were breathless with re¬ peated praises of his understanding and his heart, iie observed, with tones as har¬ monious a^ those of a ministering angel, that Mich language was painful, that there ^-ere some subjects best discussed in suìi- h:de, and rewarded, if they deserved rc- w id. in the silen« of conscience; that he was ashamed of having exposed his cru le ideas on a subject of so much impor¬ tau· e, but ivques''*d to defer it tr'i Wi should lue*e the ^leisure of seeing Mr. ? 5
Corbett in his closet, to prosecute his in* quiries, he felt too interesting for generai discussion. Whetberhe felt it too inter¬ esting for private discussion too, 1 know not, but from that moment, though in¬ vited to his tidde every day, 1 have never been admitted to his closet ; and whenever Τ attempt to renew the subject, with (I had almost said) effrontery unairswerable, he entreats me not to oppress him by a mention of the trifling efforts he has made, and presents me visibly with some small sum, which he begs me to apply to the object about which we are so much in- terested. I conceive it to be merely a bribe for silence: however, 1 reflect that when '* vanity relieves in bounty's stead," we may still be thankful for the effect, though we cannot congratulate ourselves much on the cause, and ? apply his paltry donation to the objects he is so much in¬ terested in Thus 1 am still retained ahout him by the hopes of partial good.
and though I am convinced he never will do any ,thmg great in this country, neyer import any English improvements in the art of humanity, yet still such is the misery I am compelled to witness, that 1 am glad of the temporary relief I extort írom Lord Montrevor's vanity There ¡«? a worm 1 am sure at the root of the tree, but í will place my pilgrims under its shadow while I can.** This long detail might have given me breath, yet 1 could hardly utter the n ante of Lady Montrevor at the end of it· u: She is a most extraordinary woman," said Mr. Corbett, and was silent. No silence was ever more unwelcome. All who love delight to listen to the name of the object from every lip but their own. " What makes me fear,** said Mr. Cor¬ bett, " that I never shall succeed with Lord M. is our having no common in¬ terest, no alternate power of seryuig^each ether. When two men of the world^et, ? (î
they have nothing to do but to compare their several objects, and if their alternate points coincide, the indentures are com¬ pletes and the engagement good. But there is nothing like this between me and Lord AL When he first saw me, he in¬ quieti into my preferment, lamented its mediocrity, and censured the establish¬ ment for its neglect of the inferior clergy. lie then talked of his own interest and 'aìcws for me; of his present object being to get the county for his son; that his wish was to engage the most respectable charac¬ ters on his side, and particularly to con¬ ciliate the divines of both communion*; that those who assisted his views (which were entirely for the benefit of ihe coun- trv) should find he was neh ht r iniirrateiui nor incapable ; that his eldest son Air. Montolieu s tutor at Cambridge w<s now an English bishop, &#. &t\ &c. In short, 'he was canvassing as completely as if his dressing-room was the hustings. W hen he permitted me to speak, 1 informed hie.
that I had nothing to lament, and no one to reproach ; that the religion I professed had not promised me wealth, but peace of hie and tranquillity of conscience, and I was satisfied, richlv satisfied, with the com- piomisc, that from the established church, of which 1 was a minister, I had no direct assurances of preferment, and therefore no reason to complain of disappointment, for if it was s jpposed to be administered on worldly principles, I had little chance of success, and if on principles purely spiri¬ tual, tho^e principles certainly would never it ad it to reward its ministers with wealth, lie tried to discover if tins was the lan¬ guage of Millen and querulous pride, lie found it was not. Not to justify myself to him, but to my own feehngs, 1 spoke ot them at length. 1 told what were my hopes and fears, my struggles and my am¬ binoli. 1 told h mi that a Christian whose hair was white, and whose feet trembled on the veige of the goal, who looked back
on a course of threescore vears run in weakness of flesh, but willingness of spirit, and forward with a confidence which his retrospect had augmented, that such a being would not be bribed by a crown, to pause or to turn, except to bid those who offered to throw it aside, and join him. I might have spoken with too much vehe¬ mence : I was vehement. My heart was hot within me, the fire had kindled, and I spcske. ¿3ut I spoke to him in vain. lie .regarded me first asan hypocrite, and then ias a madman. There is no madness more desperate than that which gilds the straws «and paints the walls of a squalid cell to the eye of the lunatic : such is his We ^parted, I believe, with feelings for each other »early the same, lie finds I am unnt for business. Lut as he is not wholly unfit for mine while he continues to make me his almoner, I submit to be »exposed in full canonicals in a drawing- :???1 ¡feefore jdi wJho please to see a live
rørson, a situation to which I should otherwise prefer the pillory, provided I did not deserve to be put there/' To the shame of my better feelings, I only list¬ ened that I might again inquire his opinion, his feelings about Lady Montrevor. At -this moment, however, dinner was announced, Lord M. never waiting later than seven ; and I thought with vexa¬ tion that í might have employed the in¬ terval in gazing on her by the shadowy light, which ifit but half revealed her, but half re vea led me. The dumer party, which amounted to near sixty people, was almost arranged, when Lady M. observing Mr. Corbett re¬ tire to the second table, called to him to *il by her. u 1 am afraid to face this im¬ mense piilaw without your assistance; my lord savs we are to have every thing in the classic costume, and you shall instruct me in the laws of augury, and telime, do these birds omen well/' I took the omen
of her attention to Mr. Corbett as a favor¬ able one ; almost all her conversation was directed to him, yet still, from its flutter and gaiety, all appeared too much intended to distinguish herself, Her vanity, from an impulse, had become an habit. She could say nothing without a determination to be admired ; but never was her beauty more splendid, or her wit more playful than on that day. Every one remarked how amazingly delightful Lady Montrevor could be when she pleased—that is, when she was pleased to be in spirits. The first course was nearly over as usual. when Lord Roschamp and Sir John w un¬ announced. " Oh ! sit close to me, ibi heaven's sake,'' said Lady M. t: They arc all in the majesty of mud, I see, and tí you stir my train will suíler without hi netit of clergy." Lord Roschamp immediately strode up to her— 4 ' I'll give your ladyship twenty guesses, and I'll be damped if jou tell where Orberry and 1 are come írom."
"· If you gave me an hundred, í never eould guess any place but the stable ; but as vou cannot sit on the back of my chair, had not vou better take a «eat bv .Miss Montolieu, unless you prefer a table to vourself and boots and d ne seul like a Chínese. 1 ' 4í Oh damm.'", now thats all wit, and 1 don't understand it all— 'pon my soul, ΙΊ1 punish you, and go tell my lord. My lord, by heavens it was t he- highest thing you ever knew, Orberry and I have spoiled a junketting party moet famously/' " I beg your lordship will sit down first; in this house it is not necessary to be on your legs in order to be heard/' " But I must be on mv lesis, for 1 must shew you how it happened with my whip. Orberry and 1 were coming to dine wbh you at a good moderate hour about, seven, for we had been out shooting, and came home to diess, and fell fast asleep, and just jumped up in our boots as we were,
and came oil to you ; and just on the road before us there yvas an immense caravan of aunts, and grandmothers, and cousins, going to sòme infernal party or other on one of those damned cars that the savages here use; and an half starved, half blind Galway garrón dragging them alonga road that was up to the nave of the wheels. But my lord, the most knowing thing of all was, that the road yvas all full of drains and holes across it—damme if ever I have a road mended near my house, its so fa¬ mously funny—and so, my lord, when¬ ever they approached one of these, and could neither wade nor swim, by heavens the whole troop dismounted, and the dri¬ ver just cracked his whip, and the old spanker leaped completely across with the empty car on his back, and they got round, and so on —so by heavens says I to Or¬ berry I'll put them up to an amazing knowing touch, and he and I rode up, and
ihe very next slough they came to, just as they were all loose in their seats, Orberry and 1 gave a famous crack w ith our whips, and damme but the old hero obeyed the uord of command, and gave such a plunge attempting to leap with the car on his hack, and the whole congregation were as flat in the mire as Dr. Slop was that 1 was reading the other night when I had nothing to do—wasn't it amazinglv famous mv lord ?'* " And, of course, your delay was owing to the assistance you afforded tho mifortunaU; ladies " ? " No, damme, it was owing to my staying to laugh at them , by heavens 1 thought ld have dropped from the saddle, and the fellow ivas damned saucy Ånd devilish impertinent to and cracked i lis whip at us when he saw us laughing.** " 1 hope he did not knock you down, Sir John," said Lady M. with most ludicrous gravity. " No, curse mc, but I rode ¿way and left Koschamp to get out of the
scrape himself; it was his frolic, not mine,*' Lord l\í 0 weary of this etourderie, or oí any thing that interrupted his display of himself, again took occasion to lament the defectiveness of his rooms from the celle* ret not heading the insignia of Bacchus, " and the chimney picce," sud he in a tone of despondency, " the chimney-piece of an eating-room disfigured by the loves of Cephalüs and Aurora, instead of ap¬ propriate groups of genii, with the tri¬ butes of Pomona and Ceres, and"—" and Comusand Ciice, my lord,** said Lady M. who immediately dnected the whole force of her ridicule against the appropriate system. 4C Nothing can be conceived so fortunate in a dearth of ideas as the new system ; I hope tosco it entirely supersede conversation, and answer all the purposes of Mexican history painting ; by emble¬ matic allusions, drawn from our furniture,
we arc conviv ?? ed all double of thought or of employ »nau. To íinish a room with bu- -f writer^, and wreathe the frieze Witti the anciout scrolls instead of books, will uus »ver eveiy purpose of a library, and <-à\e reading, for want of which poor Lord \{. the other night, was obliged to look into Tnstram Shandy Jn a short time, ï am convinced it will be equally gratifying to the góbié to sit iu a room furnished as au eating room with every thing but a table, «s it was formerly í ? sit i- one; and as tor sleep, where Mr. Hope strews poppies, it is impossible not to sleep. Every func¬ tion of life will be performed by the help of imagination, and nobody will have oc- «'asum to livo in the vulgar sense, but the artists of our furniture, if Mr. Mope docs not exterminate them with his pen. We shall know the em ',« /monts of life by tho names of our apartments, as Luculhb did İM' value of his entertainment^. *' \ think the plan cnl\ admitted ono im*

Lord Roschamp, who had drank wine with me at dinner, at length interrupted ihe declamation by demanding whether I had taken lessons from Belcher, or some other boxer, whose name he mentioned. 1 answered in the negative.

" If your lordship will have the goodness to enumerate them, f shall at least undertake the refutation with facility." This was making his lordship tb objector, the very thing he was wish¬ ing to avoid ; his desire was to expose the establishment to obloquy, and its advocat*
to contempt, and when his rancour was sufficiently gratified, he proposed to act die moderator, and ridicule the weakness of a cause which could only be preserved from disgrace by the courtesy of hospita¬ lity, by "his lordship's wish that the esta¬ blishment should be treated with respect at bis lordship s table.** ï le hesitated, and dee!ined 5 and evidently united to give the blow under some one's buckler; but though the company were by W) meansdistinguished for religious feeling, die universal respect for Mr. Corbett had ■Venced them. lie paused for a moment, und then said in his usuai nervous simplicity of manner, 1 am not to understand au v of liiere objections are leveliéi! against Chris¬ tianity itself, but merely against that mode of professing and administering it which the Established Church adopts.

library abounds with books which would render ail that I could say superfluous. 4i With regard to the establishment, no one who admits the truth of religion, will deny that religion must be taught and en¬ forced by ministers and ordinances, for if he takes his system from Scripture. I think he will find that Scripture prescribes posi¬ tive rites, and individuals set apart to solemnize them ; and if he takes his sys¬ tem from his own mind, (exclusive of its being vague and irrational, to wander from authority to impulse) that mind must be strangely constituted to whom its principles and duties never required to be recalled and unfolded ; that needed neither monitor nor counsellor, whose devotion was intirely independent of externals, whose hopes never sought support, and whose doubts never needed illumination. The establish¬ ment has been accused of aggrandizing it¬ self, yet it is known that many of its
members are not wealthy; it has been ac¬ cused o r neglecting those who are not, yet if they are contented with their obscurity, where is the cruelty of neglecting them ? They should be supposed to have a conso¬ lation from the verv nature and exercise of their profession, that acts as a balance to all its inconveniencies. if they want it üiey should not have entered into a profes¬ sion withmu the spirit of it; ii' they have it, they hardly need any other. 1 have ht en always what the world calls poor, but í bave never been dissatisfied.

In the drawing-room the ladies were employed in admiring, and Lady M. in laughing at, their admiration of a splendid edition of Hope's spkndid work on house¬ hold furniture. Equally amused by their exaggerated praises, and their ignorance of the Pagan mythology, she poured out the whole Pantheon on them, and tra¬ versed the whole range of antiquity, from die height of the Acropolis, to the depths oi Herculaneum. Her knowledge was really extensive, and her wit and spirit would have made it appear so, if it had been even superficial. But nothing could stimulate her to exertion but the pleasure of vanity; she conquered only to triumph, and she was satisfied to triumph equally over strength and weakness. Yet, while my heart ached íor powers so distinguished I e

In Dublin, a number of places of en¬ tertainment would be an indication that the natives had quitted their residence there, or at least their national character. The few places of public entertainment there are wretchedly conducted, and, ex¬ cept on the appearance of some local phænomenon, wretchedly attended ; bu^ this cannot be imputed to any discover¬ able defect either in their love of pleasme, or their taste : when present at them, they feel with all the vivid sensibility of their character, and criticise with a taste which has not unfrequently dictated to a London audience in the choice and merit of per¬ formers.

Tho resources which supply this perpetual jet d Vau of pleasure must be deducted from the grneral fertility of the ground. There ? not much wealth in Ireland.

n. neh emulous splendor in familia, and much misery among individuals. '1 hero arc still many point» in which the Indu 'e- 'ndividua's, differ from the Lngb-'h.. An Hnglishmau at sixteen is ? ??? sober, selfish animal, with more desire of his own indulgence, and more skid in combining that indulgence with hi* interest, than an Irishman at any age of the world ; yet an llndishman is a better familv-mau. TI -e Irish are more ardent lovers, the Knuhdi hetter husbands. The irishman is moro exhilarating in soeietv, the KiHishman's comforts are more domestic, Oue is formed to give ???? delight, the oth<c more tranquil and rational happmess to life. The Irishman approaches you with facility, and attaches bimst If to you v, ith ardor; the Englishman it is difueult to conciliate as an acquaio!ance, and morc difficult to obtain for a friend, but once obtained, the prize is beyond all labor» !n talent the Irish are not deficient, but M â
their national talents form a loo^e and eon - fused mass, without analysis and without momentum; it is matter not without spirit, but without * form and void:' in some clarea it is depressed by poverty, in all classes it is defaced bv indolence, aud exhausted by dissipation. He whose ta¬ lents can promote conviviality, seeks for them no higher use or object; he who can please without study, never wishes, by study, to convert pleasure into utility. lie who delights the circle among whom he lives, never dreams of extending his sphere, or enlarging his powers. The visi¬ ble horizon bounds his mental view. Like the first men in Goldsmith's Apologue, lie knows no higher mountains than those he has looked up to from his birth ; beyond them he thinks of nothing, or thinks all is vacancy ; and titis is not from want of knowledge, or want of ambition, it is an insensibility of the mental powers pro¬ duced by the perpetual use of the most 3
exciting stimulants. To a philosopher» the world from a distance, or the world for a moment, may he viewed as an object of curiosity and observation, but if once in passing through the fair, he finds a pleasure 01 a demand for its joys, he ceases to be a philosopher. An irish¬ man's habits of reading are temporary and superficial; Ids efforts of talent are desul¬ tory and eccentric; his study U a banquet¬ ing room; and the presidents of the feast are always the Graces and Venus. iL· may be excited to exertion by [ìride, but he reposes agam in pleasure, The giant, in the fable, acquired new strength every time he touched the earth; thw Irishman seems to derive fresh strength from what would depress and debilitate any other mind; he can assume the port oi' İ 1 erculei when he will, but it is his pleasure to b^ the slave of Ompbalc. The peculiarities of the Irish character are at lea^t eminently favorable to siwui* ? 6
gcrs. In London, or in any other c i ry, unless you adopt the expensive and unso¬ cial resource of public amusements, or arc domesticated with a few private families, you may pass in your utter solitude. Iu Dublin, with the mere advantage of the exterior and habits of genteel life, you may pass every evening in gay and polish¬ ed society, where, if the mind is not much enlarged, the senses at least are amused ; if useful connections are not formed, faci¬ lity is at least acquired; and men forbear to acquire that cold, sei risii, solitary, ta¬ vern-haunting, woman-hating life, of sober intoxication, and comfortless indulgence, in which many Englishmen, married and unmarried, wear out existence. I need not speak of the distinguished dd» vantages of the Irish in the society ; it is easy to suppose» that menso anxious to please, must be peculiarly anxious to please those on whom so much of the pleasure of life depends. The fact is well known : we-
men universally prefer the society of Irish¬ men; they are better acquainted with the modes of pleasing, their minds are more plastic and pliant, their manners are more striking and animated, they flatter with more facility, and trine with more grace, But such success must be attained by ???? sacrifice: the Irishman, who lives in pleasure, and who lives to please, must have less dignity, stabilitv, and force of eharacter, than he who lives for other pur¬ poses, lie is more attractive among wo¬ men, but less eminent among men. The ardor, the levity, and the ductability of the national character, appear in the greater as well as the lesser parts of life. In Ire* land we marry for love, struggle vigor¬ ously against indigence, and when wealth ís attained, squander it; adopt extensive plans of improvement; run in debt at the commencement of them, and leave both obligations unfulfilled. In literature we have more orators than men of learning»
asd more wits (more men of sparkling minds, and ambitious conversation,) than authors, in society more splendor than wealth, and more dissipation than amuse¬ ment—yet with all their errors, the Irish are an amiable people, and will yet be a creat one. 1 have heard a man of hish intellectual powers say of them, c Lhe Irish arc a people who have never had their day, but when they have, what a a people will they be 1' Of the College, the only seminary in Ire¬ land except the Catholic one at Maynooth, I must again express my dissatisfaction. It is not calculated to answer the great pur¬ poses of national improvement. The system was constructed at a time when learning was the privilege of a few who were not willing to communicate it to others, w lien philosophy was not brought down from col¬ leges to dwell among men. There is too' much of the old, monastic, unprofitable^ inaccessible spirit in the system, 1 do not
apeak oí the discipline—the discipline oi' a college cannot be too strict : J speak of their literature». They are eminently skilled in. its more abstiuse parts-; they must bo distinguished mathematicians,, &c.&c.&c.in order to acquire a fellowships lîiit of these sciences the principal use is iu the application to certain parts of life with which the iellow of a college has no concern. A skilful mathematician. may for instance make some improve¬ ment in mechanics, to which I believe no fellow dreamed of applying his· mathema¬ tical knowledge. But they are certainly. not distinguished by classical, erudition, which adds, much to the elegant and. subtle spirit of research iu literature, or by their attainments rn English literatures on which depends, in a great measure, its 'facility, extension, and use in life. Λ mathematician is rarely wanted, but life always requires historians, civilians, poets, *nd orators. I know that these depart
ments, and what should belong to them» are not neglected in the University of Dublin, but I knew the attention paid to them is secondary and unproductive, and must be ?? when distinction in them is rewarded by occasional premiums, and the great prize of a fellowship is reserved for scientific eminence exclusively. I may use the term, when it is remembered that f-if the four days appointed for the exami¬ nation for the fellowships, the three first are consumed m a range of sciences, while ?????, Latin, Hebrew, History, Chro¬ nology. Antiquity, ¿cc. &c. Sec. are com. presseil into the four or two la*»t hours of the competition. I speak of the Uni¬ versity with reverence, for its defects are in the institution, not in the individuals who compose it, who, under happier aus¬ pice?, might and will be c the illustrious men, and ingenuous youths,' which Mr, Grattan, the lover of his country and 01 its institutions, once hailed them, (???
innovation is not to be lightly undertaken, or easily executed, it 'n always difficult, sometimes dangerous,) But I speak ot it also with earnestness, both of feeling and conviction, for I believe in the present, or indeed in any state of the country in the hands of the national instructor o* youth, are the issues almost of national life and death. I again recoil from the remembrance of my mode of life in Dublin. It is, I am afraid, too justly represented in the letters which precede my narrative. They speak (J me indeed ' as lam, and if they set down nothing in malice, they certainly do naught extenuate/ They represent me histly as impelled in a course in which I might otherwise have hesitated by Delo- iorailie's example and praise, (and most powerful of all) his ridicule, I had rushed aito dissipation, seduced by the novelty of the scene, and solicitous to forget one oo whope thought it was madness to dwell;
But when novelty had ceased, and I fouuf no efforts of mirth or spleen could teach me that ς hardest science to forget,* I wa? still forced to rush on, and to forget myself At the termination of my winter iu Dublin, I was seized with a violent fever ; rny constitution was poisoned, my mind was corroded ; no one believed ï could live—· I did not wish to live. When I though* how I had acquitted myself to society, to my uncle, how 1 had lavished the wealth, and defaced the name I was to honor, how I had blazed the meteor of a season, and how soon my blaze was exhausted, and 1 was hastening to darkness, 1 felt my blood slow even bevond the heat of fever ; but when i remembered how little life had fulfilled its promises to me, that í never could· be happy, that to me but one spot on the earth was Eden, and from that í was driven, I took refuge in the danger which thev no lomrer concealed fro*n me, I retain but few traces of my R chugs iii
that time, till I was roused to feeling as by au electtic shock 1 recollect grasping, oven through sleep, the gem which I alwavs wore m m v bosom. ï recollect imploring them to conceal the cause of my death from my uncle ; after that I recollect nothing till a voice said to me, ·* Your uncle, the De Lacy, is arrested, and in Bvrc-court ¡ail for your debts." I started up; tin: word» were repeated by Deloraiue's servant. What would in any other chcumstanec have killed me, re¬ stored me to sensation, to life, at that moment : yet, w idi my ivcolh'Ction per- ftctly awakened, I a< led as if under the impulse of delirium, in the rage of fever; ï threw on my clothes— í sprang into a carriage. I travelled in the depth of \v inter to Connaught; I had barely money, to defray my expenses. My intention uà·-» to implore them to confine me in his place, to let me die in the prison I had deserved. Long before I had arrived, he

My uncle was attended to the castle by hundreds of the gentry and tenantry, and his towers shook with the acclamations of half a county—- hut the blow was struck. The people who arrested him could have had no in¬ dentions of seriously injuring aman whose. property was extensive, and whose tem¬ porary distress must be the result of a combination of fraud and accident: their only object was to arrest him. The con¬ sequence of debt to him must be trifling aud brief; the consequences of the in¬ dignity they hoped would be fatal· ît is not from a contempt, or a savage and wilful blindness to the utility of jurispru¬ dence, tbat its exercise is ati indelible in¬ gu it to a Milesian, it is from a rooted belief of native and necessary aristocracy of character and station, a belief that the
conquests of the English have not reached him, that he is yet a sovereign in his own territory, and accountable only to himself for his actions. The forms of modern policy, that equal distribution of justice which extends to every part of society, he does not despise, or defy\ but he does not understand, or imagine how they can affect him. He hears of them as if they were ili e laws of another country—hears of them, and rejoices that he is a Milesian, and exempt from all restraints but those of his own spirit» Such were my uncle's feelings, and such therefore was his despondency. The malice of the trans¬ action was so obvious, that it was with difficulty the persons who had exe¬ cuted the writ escaped. Λ Connau^ht mob have but indistinct notions of political justice. The event was however orni» neatly favourable to my uncle» He was compelled to look into the state of Ins aflairs. He found them much more favor-
able than he had been allowed to believe by his steward who h^d hitherto been en¬ trusted with their sole inspc .'on. He bad been constantly in the habit of re- ceiving fees from the tenants for abatement of rent, and representations of their dis¬ tress, when no distress existed. Thus the poor wretches confessed themselves in the penitent agony of the moment, when they saw their Chieftain going to jail, a sight which they swore by the immaculate mo- thei of the L-rd thev had lived too long to see, and they the cause of it. ' 4 We are the biegest villains that e\er stood on Ciocls earth, except Neal (ìahagan (tke steward), and he would cheat the devil himself, for he cheated us and you. If vou had scut vour dosr for the cms out of our huadir, you should have had them- — t»irn back, turn back, for the luve oí Christ, and you shall have it all, and w h\ not, and our hearts* blood upon tho back of it : —turn fcack, Ot Lacy, turn back, oi
die stones will leap out of Eyre-Court wall, before they will shut you in." Such was the cry oí hundreds, whose ■affection (with the true Irish levity, and want of principle) submitted to defraud the man, at whose prison door they swore on their knees they would have them sogers heart's blood upon a stone, and the cry of the widow in the house, before morning. When the whole train of fiaiid and peculation was unfolded, my unric exclaimed, he never could have believed any evidence but that of his senses, of Gahagans villainy. " lie was my foster- brother/' said he; " we were nmsed by the same milk ; I never could have be¬ lieved it." ? Π had been adjusted before I reached Commught. 1 was onlv detained a few Cv ν minutes on lhe road by Debraine, who had followed and overtaken me, and locking the door of the room into which he had pursued me, adjured me to pre¬ serve him from the reseufment of his VOL. ir. N
uncìe, an 1 the odium of the business." " You know, Ormsby, it was my regard for you that tempted me to exceed your expenditure. I thought it scandalous that your spirit and indulgences should be checked by such paltry limitations. I never could have checked you. My affection for jou betrayed me into folly— into extravagance. I thought mv uncle's wealth mucii greater than it is. He has deceived me—he has deceived us both he deserves the consequence." I was leaning my head on the table, my face was buried in mv handkerchief. I only raised İt to ???, t * Deloraine, if you would have lue listen to vou— nota word of'—I could not utter my uncle's name. He retracted. he entreated, he remonstrated. I was too wretched to \vi:di to extend the wretch¬ edness î felt. I promised, if ever I was admitted to my uncle's presence, not to accuse him but mvself 1 was careless oí resentment, for I was careless of life, f wished Oiìly to be forgiven and die.
At that time it was indeed probabl·- iaat no solicitude could preserve ¡ny liic: n»y strength was exhaustod, and nr¿ fever iri- rrensing ; the pain and confusion in my head wrre almost intolerable. I rccolh.-t, as in a dream, crossing the court of the castle, not speak »??; to any of the servant? who crowded about mc, for I had a con¬ fused idea that everyone wanted to impede me ; aud placing myself silently at my uncle's door, and sinking donn upon it, when I could stand no longer. í would not pomi it any one to approach or touch mo ; and they could not make me under' 4tand that he wasasiec p. In a few moments Deloraine came up ; to the tonc^ of his voice 1 was always sensible. <4 Oun>b\ *" said he, " you must come awa\ — -v>u will die if you remain h eie in your prtseni *tate/ J 1 smiled when he spoke ot d^ath, u Vour uncle will not sec you; vihyd* \nu distross him, andexhaint v(^inolf bv dé* obstinacy : "* 1 was silent but did x 2
»ot move. 4l Ormsby, dear ?????, listen to me, let me prevail with you," He knelt down beside me—I lay on the floor. " Your blood is heated, your temper is impetuous ; so is De Lacy's—if he comes out, and sees you here, he may be pro¬ voked to some violence ; you may be pro¬ voked by what no man can resist. If he should spurn you away, you will do some rash thing, you will hate yourself for it ever after. Don't stay here to expose yourself to usage which will degrade you if you don't resent it, and which you will repent all your life if you do." Some of the servants who pitied me, in¬ terposed. They declared the De Lacy would never do good till he saw me again : that his heart would warm to the sight of me— that when he lay down the night before, he pronounced rny name twice, and they Jieard him sigh heavily after his curtains were drawn« I heard everv word with the clearest perception. ï clun¿ to the door
with all my strength, and repeated my own name in a voice which, though wild with delirium, he had not forgotten. He came out. He bent over me as I knelt at the door. He fell on my neck and wept. Forsorne months neither my health nor my intellects appeared likely to recover the shock thev had received. To travel seventy miles through a bleak country in the rage of a fever, was a violence to nature from which no force of enthusiasm could protect it. í believe in any other state of mimi it must have been fatal: even in mine it was nearly so. And when I recoyiaec*. my faculties, it was only to look on life with disgust—it had nothing good for me. The sting of early and dis¬ appointed passion throbbed and rankled in my heart's core, yea in my heart of hearts, i became listless and dejected. The deep melancholy of passion baked my blood, and made it heavy and thick. N 3
The dark red spot that burned for ever on tny cheek, was no sîirn of health. í listened to no oue. 1 was interested by nothing, except when a message of in- i|uiry arrived from Montreun* House. I bad no companion. Mr. Corbett had been removed to a small living at a distance , Hammond and his wife yyere in England, With Deloraine I took no counsel. Delo¬ raiue's power was merely that of exciting the spirits in health, and adding to the festivity of mirth, I loved him -loved him unreservedly, f had eivon but too strong proofs of my confidence in him, but there is a species of confidence high, ami delicate, and sad, which í never could re* pose in Deloraine. It was during this melancholy period of astriígele with ill health, in yvhieh I hardly wished to overcome, that my unele, w huse penetration I thought I had eluded, told me, almost ki thelanguage cf a neglected writer» that i l could uot hide my purpose from my
narrow-searching friend. * It wr\s the, first time he ever mentioned, ever alluded to his own passion. I am not going to detail the melancholy confidence of postini*· , mous aílcciion. and of hopeless aifcction. There was little language in our shon dialoiiue, but much intelligence. Neither importunity nor aßee'Jon however drew from me the name of Ladv Alontre vor. 1 still retained m\ dread and shame of a guilty passion. ï ack now ledved I loved—* loved without hope, loved 1 believed to death, but acknowledged no more: till touched bv mv une!< 4 V M>i;c;tude, and ? mdv l)oh»\iH^ I had secui eil unreif by the et nditioiu I told him ï would dis¬ close ihe otiject wheu I had found icysei 1 suiiicientiy benefited by an excursion to the neiohbomhood of ihe ???, to advtrt to ihe subject without an emotion which i then foit too much for me. i le consented ;o ihe eonihium, and hurried my departure. 1 went to the rock on the pía coast, n4
in the neighbourhood. Debraine was still my companion : it was necessary he should be, for my lassitude had ren¬ dered me unfit for the commonest busi¬ ness of life. But in Delorame's society there is no longer any danger. To mo the name of pleasure was loathsome—I bad never known more than the name» I have now been here some week«, and have felt under every change of place that ' the mind is its own place, and vhtre can make a heaven of hell, an hell of heaven;* in mine both are ?? much mingled, the guilt of passion is sootiied by such dreams of pleasure, and that pleasure so shadowed by fear and self-reproach, that if I were confident of ??? 1 in death, I would not wish to live. Such was the account I gave my invisi¬ ble correspondent; I will pursue it for you y\ ithout interruption. From this state of apathy I was roused by a letter from my uncle. To pacify him 1 had bent him
flattering assurances of my health, He believed them, and claimed my promises on it. I was confounded, but could not retreat: with a faultering hand 1 traced these words at the eud of a letter, in which I deprecated all assistance, all con¬ solation,—" The cause of my dejection, the cause, I believe, of my death, when I die, is to be sought in M outre vor JI o use. I never have said or written so much to man before—I never will say or write more "* Yet, when I had written this, I felt relieved, gratified; compassion is sooth¬ ing to the mind in every state ; I deserved compassion, I was sure of my uncles, I was sure of more—of his sympathy. While I was consoling myself for my confession, I received a letter, desiring my immediate presence at the castle. The expressions were remarkably strong. u I have worked wonders i n your favor, come down immediately, you will not believe the joy that is preparing to welcome you ; .N5
, I will tell you no more, come immediatefy to \ouraifeci tonate uncle. M. í)e Lacv." il was written,as usual, bv lather Cusack. but signed by the Chichaiu. i will not tell the state of mind in which ï tia\ elled ; a state of holieitude and hope loo wild and exquisite for description ; m th«· wide range of possibility, what room was there for either? What could be done for me by man? But the \NÌons that floated before me were sweeter frum their shadow v and indefinite forms, from their wanting a local habitation and a name, tïoui their actual imoossibilit v, and fantas- tic realitv. 1 arrived at the Ca«tle, it was- «t dark autumnal evening, in the close of October: as haigas light remained, 1 read and mai ked every character hi my uncle's letter, and expounded it b\ every art in. the cabbala of faucv, and held it to mv h»»art to still its beatings, w lieu I could re/ad no longer. I sprung out of the carriage ; I asked
for my uncle ; he had not expected me till the following night ; he had set out for Montrevor-1 louse, and had left ordtrs that Deloraine and 1 should follow him, in the event of our arrival, which, however, he hardly expected. With all the impatience and restlessness of my feelings I vet could not avoid wish- ing to spare lier the spectacle of my wasted figure —all * travel-stained/ and 1 spent some moment■* at the Castle endeavouring to compose my feehngs, and my appear¬ ance, which wert 1 almost as v. ild as Car- deniers, his rags excepted. We proceeded to Montrevor-1 louse ; it was now night. and Debraine could not see the w<\ soot in mv cheek, which burned hotter than ever. He was silent— u n usu all ν silent ; í spoke to appease my ou n agitation, but my words were almost inarticulate. The cir· cumstanceof mvimclebein^at Montrevor« House gave a kind of domestic confidence lo my feelings, which were again disturbed N G
by the singularity of his bciiiLf there; he had never quitted the castle before, except on an iuvitation to Lemon-Grove. We arrived ; the servants appeared to ex¬ pect our arrival. We were shown into the drawing-room; the family, who bad not vet dined, were collected in it. The lights were blazing w hen we entered, and the company rose to receive us ; my uncle advanced first. The sudden tran¬ sition from darkness and cold, and confine¬ ment in a narrow vehicle, to the glare of light and splendor, and the confusion of figures and voices, scattered the little recollection I had struggled to obtain.— Lord and Lady Montrevor were advancing slowly across the wide draw ing- room to say those conciliating nothings that neverthe¬ less give the stranger breath and time ; but ?? umde, his. natural impetuosity in¬ crease d by his affection and triumph, ex¬ claimed—~ u This ís no time for forms, we are too happy for them ; Ormsby, you are
the first Irishman whose diffidence ever obstructed his happiness ; but no English peer need blush at his connection with my heir, and you may be proud of a prize which it reflects honor ou Ireland,, that one of her native sons should win." As he spoke, he drew Miss Montolieu forward, who appeared sinking to the earth, and placed her cold and trembling hand in mine. í stood motionless for a moment. Had he been pronouncing a spell that converted both into stone, the efiect could not have been stronger. At length, Mits Montolieu, who had vainly struggled to speak, tottered from us, and attempting to reach Lady Moutrevor, sunk into her arms senseless. Nothing but this, and the tu¬ mult; it caused, could have restored me. Lady M. and the gouvernante assisted Miss M. My uncle accused his own ve¬ hemence, Lord M. made a speech suit¬ able to the occasion, and I leaned on Deiomine, unable to speak, unwilling to
think. He whispered to me eagerly— 6; For ('od's sake behave more like a man, a man of honor, a man of feeling ; can you see a girl, a lovely delicate girl, who has avowed her love for vou, sinking into the cai tii with her timidity at the avowal, and disconcert, and distress·, and degrade her bv this oirlish waywardness vourself ?" During tho whisper, a thought hke the consci »n sn ess of this dreadful mistake rushed on me. I remembered the doubt¬ ful expressions of my letter, 1 remem¬ bered mv having said that m v affections· were engaged by an object who resided at Montre vor-I louse. With that weakin ss of the mental e\e which the contemplation of one object causes, I never dreamed that this expression could be interpreted of any other than Lady Montevor, while my uncle, putting the more obvious construc¬ tion on it, had appliid it to Miss M voung, and lovely, and disengagui ; h'» J believed my expressions of despondency
to be merely the fantastic despondency of passion, had pleaded my imaginary cause with all the aulor of affection, and suc¬ ceeded too well. Miss M. was conveyed from the room, md my uncle's solicitude took another direction ; he observed my pale and speech¬ less looks; he approached me, and gav« me some breathing time by lamenting his precipitation, and talking of the fatigue of travel, and the hurried spirits (»fan invalid, I permitted him ro speak without inter¬ ruption. He attempted to loosen my waistcoat ; his hand touched the ribbon to which the cameo that í alwavs wore in my ho^om was suspends!. I ft It it; I was roused ; I 14collected myself; 1 uttered *ome faint words of assent. At this mo¬ ment f .adv M. in accompanvinii her dauuh·· ter, passed me; T turned; 1 touched hef veil ; she passed on, but said in a voice perfectly distinct— ; Volto sciolto, i peti¬ tion btrclf'u U seemed as if she w a*
addressing her daughter. Her voice was a sound that my feelings obeyed almost iustiuctively. Lord M. now recalled his lady to inform her he heard the Bishop of Clonferts carnage, and whispered something about the ceremony being performed as soon a$ possible^ that all the disagreeables might be terminated before dinner. " We need not waste the evening in sentimeli t and swooning ; Miss M. had better try to com¬ pose herself and ¿tay," Lady M. whis¬ pered something to my pale bride, who, aftei a moment's struggle, returned to her seat, leaning on her mother's arm, and when Lady ?1. attempted to resume her chair, she still held her hand, and mo¬ tioned her inabiiit} to be without her. I knew there was nothiuu extraordinary in this ; that fashionable marriages were usu¬ ally coiul ucted with an expedition which was meant to exclude all intrusion from feeling. I felt it was on this occasion, it
was welcome, i t was necessary ; I could not retreat, and the only mercy that could be now shewn me, was in a precipitation that did not compel me to speak, that did not allow me to think, I had no means—uo time—I dared not think. In the tumult of my thoughts something like a gleam of pleasure quivered fitfully. 1 was about to become a relative, an in¬ mate, to sec her daily without interruption and without roproach ; and something hke a security in the solemn event that was about to take place ; something that seemed to place me beyond the reach of danger, but within that of indul¬ gence, pleased, if it did not tranquil¬ lize me. The bishop entered, a man in whose presence it was not easy to feel re¬ straint* Mis address, blending facility with professional gravity, aud his con¬ versation displacing felicity with elegauce, madí3 his appearance a relief welcome to all* Whilo the license was examining,
my uncle, vvho appeared to feel the bene¬ volent disappointment of one who had purposed to heighten pleasure, and only obtained pain, said to me in a voice of constrained cheerfulness—" 1 perceive 1 am too much of a veteran to meddle with manœuvres ; these light modern weapons don't fit my hands at all ; I am too old and too awkward for them. 1 thought í hati prepared a surprise for you that would have reflected honor on my generalship, and instead of that I have only surprised Miss M. and you out of your senses 1 think. immediately on receiving vour letter. 1 he 4 contiuued, drawing me to his chair, v ' [ pvoposed to Lord M. a match between Miss ΛΙ. and vou ; 1 had little fears that he would decline it, though you were so lull of tears about it/' 1 sighed, but he set the sie. h down to the error-side of »he -account again ; " Lord M. ass* ni ed, the lady assented 0 ---and Lady Moutrevor, said 1 tremulously, " Oh, she assented too, though ir 1ì<j ¿cerned somewhat ???? ^ ur-
prised than i could have expected at so natural a circumstance as vour be»»a in love with a very beautiful ¿;irl, and amia¬ ble and interesting too, though ¡she is the daughter of an Englishman.

I have been unskilful, or mitortunate, 1 believe I must say with bear— I am old atid foolish. 1 have only disturbed and distressed where 1 meancd to—to make too happy. The feehngs of a female and an invalid are materials too delicate for mo to deal with. Uut, ???— by, you should remember that blushing and trembling is the privileg oi' lhe urkie> aiot the bridegroom." I struggled to recover .some composai ; yet there is ? kind of solemn und iuiai.- culate pantomime perbrmed on thu.-.c oc-
casions, that intimates all is ready, though ii ? one knows how to say so ; in prefer¬ ence to which I was anxious to encounter the ceremony itself. We stoed up, Lord ML supported his daughter with pompous politeness ; Lady M. drew her veil over the lower part of her face, and stood at some distance, in an attitude whose am¬ bitious elegance spoke too much ease. The ceremony went on ; I had no ring ; my uncle produced one, a large, costly, old- fashioned one, into which two of Athana- sia's fingers might have gone, and gave it with a whispered wish that it might be an auspicious omen; it w r as the ring he had prepared for his own marriage. As the fiat words were pronounc d, Lady M. dropped her veil, her eyes were fixed on me, but their expression was calm and searching, I could have said with Eloisa, 4ί Not on the cross ?? eyes. were fixed, but you." i remember nothing till 1 heard the mur-
???? of congratulation about me ; my pale shrinking bride was consigned to arms that as tbey enfolded her trembled like her own. í led her to her fathers feet with sufficient composure to spare us the repetition of the attitude ; Lady M. advanced as we knelt before her lord^ something between a prayer and a compliment was murmured by both. Lady M. extended her hand to her daughter, I pressed it; there was agony in the pressure ; it was the last im¬ pulse of passion that I obeyed· The examination of papers, êcc. pro· traeteti dinner till past eight. I was im¬ patient for it—I was impatient for wine, which I swallowed in large quantities. 1 gradually acquired a kind of false and heated courage ; I was wounded by the easy hauteur of Lady M.: from the mo¬ ment the ceremony concluded, she had become herself again ; her conversation una maniere wore unusually sparkling ; ihe determined and incessant ???? of her
vt İt was like ?^/?? d' artifice; she talked of the elassVs with the bishop, and of the an¬ cient recime ?? ith mv uncle, who listened to her with delight, and declared she re- minded him of the brightest ornaments of the vielle cour in its brightest period,— '* Tin re \va<i certainly much more dignity in the appearance of v,*omcn in those times ¡n particularly that cf matrons, ît Ís really melanchoìv to sec the distress of our an- tiquatcd belles at present, who imagine thev can renew their vouth like the ser v pent, by casting o tf their cod.

Hut we never know how to remit our claims to admiration ; we lose the substance of re- «.pect attempting to retain our title to vanity, even when no more than its shadow remains.'* 1 knew well what all this meant; it wns «aid to the company, but at me. J conti¬ nued to sit with the centiemen as íoíiq· as they remained in the dining-room. It was late when the bishop and my uncle re¬ tired. Prora that time Lady M. seemed to •rhink exertion no longer necessary. Lord ?? /s maniere diplomatique was of use to us ; he provided cards, as we wore a partie quanto, and as it was en farnillc, and wo conld not be too moderate, mentioned .■.■unicii casino. Athimasia and I lost six¬ teen guineas; as she paid her debt to her farhcr, he drew a beautiful antique from lib tinger, worth double that sum, and
put it on the hand she extended to him, de¬ claring there was a spell in it that ensured success. Lady M. as she rose, said <t Mr. Bethel, you play extremely well, but you shuffle a little too much/' 1 found it was arranged before my arrival, that we should remain a fortnight at Montrevor-House. The mode of living was perfectly with¬ out restraint, and the establishment un¬ comfortably splendid. Breakfast remained on the table from eleven till three—gene¬ rally untouched, for Lord and Lady M, who occupied separate apartments, break¬ fasted in their dressing-rooms, and Miss Montolieu seule with her governess atan earlier hour ; an habit that Athanasia and I, weary of breakfasting in pompous soli¬ tude among a suite of attendants, adopted in a few mornings. Lord M. occupied the whole morning in receiving and answering letters from England—had hardly time to swallow some ham pie, and half a bottle of champagne, before he seut to request
lier ladyship would have the goodness to accompany him in an airing. Her lady¬ ship, for what reason it was difficult to discover, never presumed to decline his requests, though her compliance she en¬ deavoured to make as painful to him as it was evidently to herself. She never rose till this summons, and then hastily throw¬ ing on her morning drcbs and pelisse, and enveloping herself in her veil, she flung herself into the family cage, as she called the carriage, insisted on his lordship's keeping on the poreh opposite to her, took a book alwavs with her to prevent the lea^t appearance oí aí ten lion to her companion, and ï h- n declaring that she was riady to ari ht r pail m the comedy of 4 haise Appeal ?????' ίο the whole 'Ounty, in the true Tin s>ian itinerant -Λ} le;— sat back m iho carnage, and amused hu-soit, eluding dio gazers as th* splendid equipage passed along.

His lady's was e\identl\ to defeat that and every other object as far as she dared; foi he appeared to hold o\er her a secret and powerful influence, with which she strm^led onh io ?\\??\ all the will of resistance, huí only the power of submission.

gratulateci and envied, till I almost began to believe that he whom all the world pronounces happy, ought to try to think himself so. The feminine and fairy beauty of Athanasia, the timidity with which she hung on my arm when op¬ pressed by the gaze of admiration, her helpless and appealing looks,, her silence, that spoke to my heart and told me it wanted love for her, and certain sources of pleasure and confidence which our new state had put us in possession of, filled me with melancholy and delicious sensations towards her. í pitied her, and my pdy was melting into love; yet my anguish was at times insupportable. To be under tiie roof with Lady AL had yet given me no oppert unity of speaking to her; I could only look, and to look was more dangerous than ever ; for, either in honor of her daughter's nup¬ tials, or from some oih#r cause, her beauty was at this period more rich and
resplendent than I had ever seen ii with bodily or e\en mental e>c before.

The day was insufferably tedious ; Lord M. always declamatory, now actu¬ ally raved of the vindication of his honors, and character,, &c. &c. hinted that by this time he believed the cabinet had felt their w 7 ant of him, that no inducement could prevail on him, to quit retirement but that attachment to his country and zeal for her interests, which would not permit him to withdraw his service« at a time that his recai testified their im¬ portance.

If you get into the house, you must distinguish yourself, perhaps if you do not, you may distinguish yourself still more. At all events, in or out you can only be distinguished 'm England ; this is a most important juncture for you and for the country; the ministry has just been changed, the present premier avowed his disapprobation of the union, and is known to be fond of this country, and of every thing belonging to it. I need not tell you that there is even some ¡dea of petitioning under his auspices for a repeal of the act of union ; this is the time for an Irishman to make himself conspicuous, on one side or the other, no matter which, to røe I mean. Principles I know* are very pretty things for those who
Irave them, they should always be the foundation of the political structure, and always be kept out of sight. Now Mr. B. that I have placed you in the \ery centre of the political world, let mc congratu¬ late you and myself on your distinction, and warn you, to render yourself of general consequence. Do not confine your- self to one limited direction, do not appear to be looking for a place, let men be compelled to look for a place for you. If you stoop in your course, to pick up the gilded fruits of profit,, you will in¬ fallibly lose the race.

My lord said, cursing and swearing ina most heathenish, horrid manner,, i( What the devil in hell shall I do, if I go to that damned infernal coun¬ try ?" said my lord. Ci ? f aut cultiver le jardin, comme Candide/'' said my lady as pleasant as possible. ζί Damn the gardens/' said my lord, for he swears dreadfully before my lady and the servants only. " I had rather go to helb than go to Ireland/' fe You may do both, my lord/* »aid my lady in a Toice as sweet as an angel, so my lord did not seem to hear hcr> and gays he, (( And is it possible you will go with me to that cursed country?" (( Ye» sure/* says my lady, ζ< or to Botany Bay, or wherever else it may be necessary for q2
us to go, and I rather imagine a domestic arrangement will be the least troublesome one in the present state of your finances, as I am told your English mistress insists on a settlement for life, and your French mistress laughs at the proposal of accom¬ panying you to a country of savages/* This was-all I recollect of the conversa¬ tion, but my lady wasdreadful! y ill v, hew it was over, and still nothing would make her confess it, she had always sueh a charming high spirit, and she went the verv dav before her new beautiful ha* ronche was sent to be sold, she went in it to London, and visited every one and left her poor dear adieus, which ï am sure nobody in London was worth, at all their doors, just fo vex them, and shew that nothing could subdue her : and so then we came to Ireland, and when my lady is in com¬ pany, I think she is just the same as ever, but alone, Oh Miss Montolieu, she has dreadful hours, and I am sure there m
something heavier at her heart, than the loss of all the wealth and grandeur in the world/' Athanasia, who saw I was interested in these relations, hut did not sec how much, proceeded to tell me that her mother had once given her a sketch half as a monition, half as a caricature., in her own manner. " I wish/' said she, i( I could recollect the very words she employed, it was one evening that she had sent word she was unwell, and could not see company; we were sitting in the dress¬ ing-room, and I was reading one of Lewis's plays, Adelgitha, yes Adeigitha, to her, not the whole play, for she never could endure to hear the whole of any thing, but passages that struck me. She started from thesopha, and said, í¿ Thank· you, thank you, that is enough, or too much rather, now you shall have the fruits of a single error related by me in turn, and as your heroine dies, and mine
is unluckily for herself alive, and as there is much more instruction in life than in death, I expect you'll be vastly edified,'* She proceeded to relate to me passages of her own life, in her own manner»

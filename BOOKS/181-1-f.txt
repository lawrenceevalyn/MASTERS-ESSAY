Nothing could be done without her acquiescence, and every change of amusement was submitted to her cogni¬ zance Pemberton, who takes delight in tormenting the little soul, whispered her the onde elect of our host, and drew such a whimsical description of the hopes and fears, the risks and perplexi¬ ties

LETTER XII. Captain Glenmorris to Mtýor Chester., Rhjdol. b» a cottage, a short hilf mile from the Vineyard, lady Elizabeth Sheffield has humanely established a destitute family,. from whom accident has snatched the means of subsistence. Gratitude dwells in the hear! of old Gilbert, and the cherub lips of his grandchildren are daily taught lo bless the name of their benefactress. Sweet aspirations ! hallowed as the twin- testaments of worth ; for on Ihe page. of benefits received, they transcribe the virtue of acknowledgment ! This col¬ lage is the morning ramble of Madeli¬ na, who, active in the blessed prosecu- K 3 tion
lion of ch.ritj, exi ts but in the distri¬ bution of g iod She sits by the couch of Gilbert, am suffers the little urchins to clamber oi her knee , whilst at entuely listening to his compi unis she gives ι patient car to the detail of restless slum¬ bers, and fev ered stins of pain Grae.ous Heaven I what a contiast to the frivolity of fashion—to the time-killing pursuits of the unthinking diughters of dissipi- tion ' What a heirt doesthat angel bosom enshrine' how sensime, how oin e to every claim of woe ' This morning I almost insensibly followed her accustom¬ ed route. my night had been disturbed, or rather, it had been dev oted to reflec¬ tion, and fear had planted thorns upon iny pillow. The dread of a father's influence, the poaibility of rejection, had ciamped the energies of hope, and depressed my spirits even to melancholy. My eye» mechanically ranged о er the beauties of nature, nor did an 0 ht of my former en¬ thusiasm
fhusiasm prevail every feeling appear ed absoibed in one and Midelim reigned unrivalled fhe mo nent of oui first introduction was revised mil thence fol¬ lowed incidents ilone impollini in the eves of love Yet what was it t feared? Never had a repellent fiewn never had llie slightest ludiiation of displeisure, marked my evident devotion It is tiue no avowal had I made, vet those seduc¬ tive smiles, those I ısı mating blushes that seeming air of consciousness, that almost involuntary interest, bespeaks, without the aid of unity a something warmer than the mère acknowledgment of acquaintance Pardon me Chester, hur¬ ried away bv wild, by ardent hope, I deviate from all the rules of system I began by telling you I had followed the footsteps of Madelina, attend me then within the cottage and trace her excellence even through the infection of love Behold, at her welcomed pre¬ sence, the languid eje of pam animated r i with
with momentary brillnncy, and the downy features of infmcy glowing with the ir- dour of delight ' Yes, every heart nl that cottage bounded to hail a friend, nough none, like mine, so deailj filt the value of her soft perlections I wíj, an unobserved spectator of the scene , Madelina knew not my affinitv , I I ad taken a more circuitous roule than her¬ self, and paused at the garden-gate in time to-nûte her entrance, The sudden exclamation of the children betrayed my position, and the agile bound of Utile Susan, in the same instant, directed the glance of Madelina. Rich was the tide which suffused her fair countenance, evident tbe sudden palpitation of her heart. Ah, gracious Heaven ' how de· lightful was that palpable confusion '— how did every vestige of sadness vanish beneath that smile ! " Kow beautiful'" lisped little Susan, again springing on the lap of Madelina ; and then she held up the full-blown rose
rose she had gathered, and looking air¬ lessly in her face, continued, " My rose is not half so red '" That simple remark, that childish ob¬ servation, heightened the tint, and those downcast eyes, that ingenuous counte¬ mnce, scorning every assumption of dis¬ guise breathed nought but encourage¬ ment yet did my coward heart misgive me—yet did I slumber on in the sweet delirium I feared, through family inter¬ position, to be severed the dingerons charm of her society, and 1 quitted the cottige, 1 traversed the solitude of the lane, without daring to hint my passion She refused not the support of my arm and even when she ac« knowiedged the meeting was unexpect¬ ed, no single indication spoke it un¬ wished " The morning air is, particu¬ larly grateful, I exclaimed, " after the tedious endurance of a sleepless night " Madelina s eyes were raised from the f 5 earth,
earth, and sucha softened interest thnll¬ ed in the tones of her ever magi voice, that the simple obseivation of " I fear you are ill, captain Glenmorns," was worth the unbroken slumbers of ι whole year m existence I admit it selfish, yet I wished to probe the extent of interest —I wished to realize more than the sha¬ dow of idea! hope, and ) idding to the po¬ litic influence, observed, " of whit v ilne is the health of one, whose life would ¡.caree be missed in the aggiegate of so¬ net) ' Norehtiie ties cium the associ¬ ation of love, or adds one link in the chain of nature ' Again her eves viere fixed upon me, mil a ny of divine en¬ thusiasm animatei her whole counte¬ nance " Is it you, ciptim Glenmorns ? — J thought—1 had hoped— and then she paused, and then sweetly blushing, con¬ cluded, " It is conduct, more than the most attenuated fine of consanguinity, which
which slamps the true estimate of in¬ dividuals , for every life is dear to man whicli owns thepiop of virtue " " lrue, mj chirmmgrefoimist, virtue is the peculiar care of Heaven, and life approximates to virtue— ' flie thread of ι election was severed by Rosamond spnnging ovei the stile, exclaiming, " Truants, truants, what a dance have ) ou led me ' I have been all round the field, and down the lane. Lady Elizabeth is waiting breakfast, and I am positnely sttrving." " We have only visited the cottage of old Gilbert," said Madelina " Ah ' but old Gilbert, nor old Gil¬ bert's grandchildren, did not detain you so long," archly replied Rosamond. and playľully addressing me, " I declare, cap¬ tain Glenmorns, if I was commanding officer, I should recall you to head-quar¬ ters " " By what unfortunate oversight," I г ő demanded,

LETTER XV, Captam Glenmorrts to Major Cl ester.

momentary flush betraying the sensitive force of feeling, as her own eyes rested on her third unadorned finger *' Certainly not, but appearances be¬ lie, or a ring would be very becoming in that quarter But what is worse thin all, some woman of supposed chaiacter actually visits nd supports her in her vile and shameless pnctices " I am that woman said Miss Annen¬ dale, using from her scit " AnJ per¬ mit me to ask you madam, whose con duct is the most u ι eproachabic the most active in well doing—her who, 1 hope from habit more than malevolence, ex¬ cites suspicion, propagates scandal, and calumniates the unoffending stringer, or her who, braving the lash of severe virtue, visits the broken heirt, md offers consolation in spite of reproof? lam the friend of the late inmate of dame W ïl- liamss cottige, and in being thit friend, I am the woman of supposed chat actcr, who

superior excellence. Ours was afuewetl visit, and as such, for good-bi/c is a heavy tax upon cheerfulness, our spirits were by no means above par. Since Ihe ar¬ rival of our recall, poor Madelina has vainly strove to rally , I have seen a tear mock the effort of cheerfulness, and 1 hav e heard a sigh contradict the supposed an¬ ticipation of a family meeting 'Tıs wrong to think, much more to say so ; but,however, as sir Owen is your uncle as well asny/ father, I may just hint, that the stately parade of the Manor forms a direct contrast to the liberty-hall at the Vineyard. The one is all ease without show—the othei is much show without a due proportion of ease. Then at the Manor theie are so many ins and outs, and passages, and corridors, and turrets, and staircases, whereas at the Vineyard, every thing is so compact, and so snug, that you may find your way m the dark as well as the light Heigh ho ' the jstring has been clipped so long, that I know
know not how I shall relish a return to dull unsocial state If it wis not for you, my pretty cousin, that frightful old hall, and all the rusty paraphernalia of its decorations, I should wish in the crater of Vesuvius and" yet we have hnd many a gambol in that said hnil, Lmilv, and scared the housekeeper, poor old Ľdwauls, out of her senses. Don't jou remember, when our great, great, greit grandfathers ensque and buckler came rattling on the marble pave¬ ment, how she called upon the saints, and run and shrieked ?

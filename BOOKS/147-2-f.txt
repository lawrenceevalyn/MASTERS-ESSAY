THE 



BRIDAL OF DUNAMORE 



CHAPTER I. 

JL HE next morning, immediately after 
breakfast, she set out for home; and her 
unexpected arrival would have imparted 
no little pleasure, but for the alteration in 
her looks. The maternal fears of Mrs. 
Glenmorlie were all awakened by the lan- 
guor and melancholy visible in her appear- 
ance, though Rosalind did all in her 
power to induce a belief that nothing was 
the matter with her. â€” " And I don't know 
how it is," she said, the morning after her 
return, as they were sitting together by 
themselves, " but I think you have never 
VOL. u. B 



been entirely yourself, Rosalind, since I 
first let you from me, and cannot help, 
therefore, regretting that I ever did so." 

" Nor I," cried Rosalind, involuntarily. 
" Would â€” would that you never had !" 
she added, clasping her hands together. 

Mrs. Glenmorlie started â€” " You alarm 
me," said she. " Tell me, I charge you, 
has any thing occurred that you have con- 
cealed from me ?" 

** No, no !" exclaimed Rosalind, in- 
stantly recalled to recollection, and much 
confused by what she had been so near 
betraying ; ** only, that, blessed with such 
a mother, I cannot help regretting every 
moment I have passed from her as so 
many lost to real happiness; for where," 
throwing her arms round her neck, and 
bedewing her cheek with gushing teai*s, 
" where could I look for such a friend- 
such kindness â€” such affection ?" 

The incident of this morning was of 
service to her, by raiising her to greater 
exertions than she might otherwise have 
made to throw off the dejection that op- 



pressed her, kst otherwise the fears that 
had taken possession of her mother's mind 
might be confirmed. In these she at 
times tolerably succeeded; the amiable 
manners, the engaging person, of lord Ori- 
elton â€” the consequence, the splendour to 
which she should be elevated, as his wife, 
were all dwelt on as a means of reconciling 

o 

her to her destiny, and at times had the 
effect of occasioning a temporary elation 
at the idea of it ; but in the very midst of 
this, a painful recollection, a torturing 
idea, would obtrude, to wring her heart 
again with agony, and make her view 
with contempt and distaste what, the mi- 
nute before, she had been dwelling on with 
pleasure. 

The Woodburnes were still absent, and 
Anna was greatly missed by her at this 
crisis, who, in the habit of passing much 
of her time with her, would, she was con- 
vinced, if now at Dunamore, have been a 
great means of enabling her to divert her 
thoughts from what distressed them. Yet 
b2 



with all her regret for the absence of the 
family at this juncture, she felt that much 
of her wonted cordiality was lost for them, 
through the resentment inspired by the 
deception they had practised relative to 
lord Dunamore. But there were soon new 
causes for regret and agitation ; Mr. Bar- 
ton, the adversary of her father, was in 
possession of a secret that nearly concern- 
ed the Monteagle family, and which, in 
revenge for their having offended colonel 
Glenmorlie, the means of obtaining redress 
he decided on disclosing. 

Mrs. Trelawney, the mother of the 
countess, when very young, was forced to 
give her hand contrary to her inclinations. 
Her husband was a military man, and, in 
the course of time, went abroad with his 
regiment, leaving her, a young and beau- 
tiful woinan, without any protection but 
what she derived from herself, and but too 
much inclined to admiration. Amongst 
those disposed to take advantage of these 
circumstances was Mr. Trelawney, and 
who, through the united advantages of 



person and fortune, shortly succeeded in 
his designs. 

Whatever precautions were previously 
taken to conceal the affair were all ^aban- 
doned on the expected return of her hus- 
band, and a divorce ensued; immedi- 
ately after which, she became the wife of 
Mr. Trelawney. 

In progress of time she had a daughter 
by this her second marriage, on which the 
father doted with the most passionate 
fondness, but for which, strange as it may 
appear, considering her conduct, she by 
no means felt an affection equal to that 
she entertained for the child of the hus- 
band she had abandoned ; and in order to 
have a pretext for seeing which, she con- 
trived to place the little Trelawney with 
the same nurse. 

Mr. Trelawney was unexpectedly called 
to the Continent, by the death of a rela- 
tion there ; and shortly after his little dar- 
ling died of an infectious disorder. 

Mrs. Trelawney had scarcely recovered 
from the shock imparted by her death. 



ere she conceived the idea of imposing her 
own darling on him for the one he had 
lost. They happened to be very like; 
and though there was the difference of a 
year between them, there was not that in 
tlieir appearance. It was a hazardous 
thing to do; however, she persevered, 
and succeeded. The nurse happened to 
be the wife of a confidential servant of 
]Mr. Barton's, and thus the affair became 
known to him. However, it was no con- 
cern of his, and he accordingly remained 
silent about it, more especially as, in the 
course of time, the nurse, betraying to 
Mrs. Trelawney the imprudent communi- 
cation made him by her husband, he re- 
ceived a letter from that lady, imploring 
liis continued secrecy on the subject. 

He had no inducement to the contrary, 
and might for ever have been silent on 
the subject, but for the malignant feelings 
that were aroused, by colonel Glenmorlie 
being enabled, through lord Monteagle, 
to do himself justice. No sooner was he 
aware that he was the person who had 



7 

furnished him with the means of obtain- 
ing redress, than he determined on mak- 
ing him feel what it was to provoke his 
vengeance, by disclosing the secret on 
which depended the validity of his mar- 
riage, and the legitimacy of his son. The 
earPs brother, lord Kenneth Kenmore, 
was the person he wrote to on the subject, 
as most nearly concerned in the matter; 
and he could not possibly have written to 
^ny one more inclined to take advantage 
4dÂ£ any thing that would be for their inte- 
t-est than his lordship. 

Inquiries were immediately set on foot 
*â€” the proceedings usual in such cases in- 
stituted â€” and after a full, though not te- 
dious, investigation, the fact, as stated, 
\vas fully established, namely, that the 
countess had been married under a ficti- 
tious name â€” that her marriage was ac- 
cordingly vend, and her son illegitimate. 

The consternation excited by the affair 
may be easier conceived than imagined; 
even strangers took an interest in it, and 
sympathized with the afflicted family; 



8 

persons who had never seen, or almost 
heard of them before, shed tears of com- 
miseration for the distress in which they 
were involved. But how intermingled 
are good and evil in this life ! At the very- 
moment that colonel Glenmorlie was la- 
menting the distressing termination of the 
affair, he had reason for rejoicing on his 
own account. Every thing was prepared 
for trial, when his opponent, to prevent 
the disgrace of a public exposure of his 
baseness, relinquished the disputed pro- 
perty; and colonel Glenmorlie had at 
length the gratification of taking posses- 
sion of what he had so long been unjustly 
kept out of. 

His happiness at recovering it was en- 
hanced by the power it would afford him 
of evincing his sense of the obligations he 
owed the earl. Though not without am- 
bition, he decided on adhering to the en- 
gagement they had previously entered in- 
to for the alliance of their families ; de- 
lighted to think it was in his power to 
make lord Orielton, or rather Kenmore, 



9 

as in future he must be called, some a- 
mends for what he had lost. But Rosa- 
lind by no means thought or felt as he did; 
had she really loved, the case would have 
been different ; but for a person she enter- 
tained no warmer sentiment than esteem 
for, to give up the rank and splendour 
that had so long delighted her imagina- 
tion â€” nay, even, in a degree, become an 
object of pity to the world, by her union 
with him, was not to be thought of, more 
especially, aware as she was, that with 
him she really loved, all she coveted to 
possess would be obtained. 

Little as, in some moments of recent 
depression, she had thought of rank and 
its advantages, yet now that she was threat- 
ened with their loss, she clung to them 
with a tenacity that convinced her she 
had deceived herself in imagining she 
ever derided them. Yet still she felt, that 
had it been lord Dunamore that had ex- 
perienced this reverse of fortune, she could 
not-^would not have hesitated to forego 
b3 



10 

them all (of his sake; and with this ar- 
dent, this urtabat^, this unchangeable af- 
fection for him, woulil it not be strange 
if she could think of giving him up for a 
person who could no longer make her any 
compensation for their loss ? 

Yet how to avow her determination of 
breaking with Kenmorej or whether she 
should eventually have courage for the 
purpose, she knew not, so gi^at was her 
dread of her father, and so highly she was 
aware she should provoke his displeasure 
by an idea of tile kind ; and there were 
moments, indeed> when it made her ^- 
pear so odious in her own eyes, as almost 
to induce a determination to relinquish it 
altogether : but still loVCj backed by am- 
bition, was too powerful for generosity, 
and she finally decided on persevering in 
it. 

While deliberating how to act, she 
found an Unsealed letter of her father's, 
which he had been suddenly called away 
fram finishing, lying one day on his desk, 
addressed to the earl, on the subject of 



11 

her engagement to his son; and it instantly 
struck her, if she could keep back this, 
and, in place of it, send one to Kenmore 
himself, purporting that all further inter- 
course between them must be at an end, 
through the determination of her father 
not to permit their union, from what had 
lately occurred, all farther anxiety on the 
subject would probably be terminated. 
But to make her father appear in so odious 
a light as she must do by this, she shrunk 
from the thought; yet against keeping 
her engagement to Kenmore, she was re- 
solutely determined ; and finally she suf- 
fered her prindples to be overcome ; but 
so artfully had she worded her substituted 
letter, that whilst all that was indignant 
in the nature of lord Monteagle and his 
son was awakened against her father, she 
herself stood blameless and lovely as ever 
in their eyes ; and in consequence of her 
manner of expressing herself, that her de- 
clining any farther correspondence with 
the latter was owing to the commands of 
her father, not by any means in corifor- 



12 

mity with her own wishes, it was decided 
that he should go over privately to Ire- 
land, and endeavour to prevail on her to 
become his without any farther hesitation. 
Winter had by this time passed away, 
and the spring was far advanced. When 
little aware of the unpleasant surprise that 
was in store for her, for perhaps nothing 
gives a greater shock to the feelings, than 
the unexpected sight of any one we are 
conscious of having injured or deceived, 
Rosalind strolled out early one lovely 
evening, and bending her steps to the 
shore, rambled on till she came to the 
spot where she had once been surprised by 
her indignant father with the then-en- 
couraged Kenmore. Feelings not neces- 
sary to define had latterly made her shun 
it, and she now drew back, as if she had 
expected to encounter there the stern 
visage of reproach, or hear the upbraidings 
of wounded affection ; but she felt tired, 
and after a momentary hesitation, sat 
down to rest herself. All around was the 
solitude and grandeur of nature ; the sea 



13 

spread its green undulating surface in 
front, while behind, and at either side, 
were rifted and unequal rocks, thronged 
with gulls and other aquatic birds, min- 
gling their plaintive cries with the low 
murmur of the rippling waves. The re- 
cess in which she sat was partially covered 
by projecting blocks, streaming with 
weeds, intermixed with tufts of the pur- 
ple sea pink ; and through the interstices 
of this fantastic roof, a chequered light was 
alone admitted to it, while the waves just 
touched the entrance, as if but to peep in, 
and then roll back, to be succeeded by 
others. 

It was a scene calculated to soothe and 
tranquillize the mind, and Rosahnd was 
just beginning to feel its influence, when 
Ken more stood before her. He had seen 
her passing from the house where he was, 
and immediately followed her.â€” "My Rosa- 
lind â€” my own !" he cried, as he rushed in, 
and caught her to his bosom, " what con- 
solation has not your unaltered regard im- 
parted to my wounded spirit ! My will- 



14 

ing hand cannot now place a coronet on 
that beauteous brow ; but ever will it be 
tny fond and grateful study to keep it 
from the contraction of care. Proved as 
has been our mutual regard, how delight- 
fbl must yet be the result of the confi- 
dence its trial has established between us! 
I almost feel Â«s if I had nothing at this 
moment to lament." 

" This is all very idleâ€” very ridiculous," 
said Rosalind, recovering from the shock 
occasioned by his unexpected appearance, 
and struggling to free herself from his 
arms. " Why are you here? or, rather, 
how could you come, after the letter you 
received from me â€” my telling you, you 
tnust think no more of me?" 

"True, you did," replied Kenmore; 
" but when you gave the command," and 
he smiled, with something of his former 
archness^ " did you think I should or 
could obey it ?" 

** Certainly â€” assuredly, else had I been 
more positive in assuring you that dis- 
regarding it would be of no avaiL" 






15 

" Nay, you would not," said Kenmore, 
again attempting to take her hand, for in 
dismay and confusion she had burst from 
him; ** and why indeed should our hap- 
piness be sacrificed to selfishness ? Pardon 
me for speaking in this way of your father; 
but certainly colonel Glenmorlie has, in 
this instance, evinced a total want of feel- 
ing and liberality. No matter, however, 
his conduct has in nowise altered the sen- 
timents of my family with regard to you ; 
and as a daughter, I trust they will have 
the felicity of shortly embracing you." 

Rosalind could not hear of the injury 
she had done her father, in the estimation 
of friends he so highly valued, without 
feelings of the deepest compunction. For 
a moment confusion and remorse over- 
powered her; then a little recovering her- 
self-*-" You have a high opinion of my 
filial obedience then," she said ; " but to 
correct it, know I am not to be induced 
to act contrary to the wishes of my father." 

Kenmore started. There was an aspe- 



16 

rity in her tone, as well as a bitterness in 
her look, that gave a sudden check to his 
feelings. â€” " Let me clearly understand 
you," he said; and seizing both her hands, 
he held them with a firm grasp. 

" That I should suppose not very diffi- 
cult," she said, but trying to avoid, his 
eyes as she spoke â€” " what I wish you to 
understand is, that I hold parental autho- 
rity in too much reverence to be induced 
to disobey it." 

The delusion he had been under vanish- 
ing; Kenmore, at these words, burst into 
a wild laugh of derision. â€” "This to me!" 
he cried. 

" Yes. Why not ?" she angrily de- 
manded. 

" Why not! Why, because this very 
spot, methinks," and he looked signifi- 
cantly round him, " should remind the 
fair Rosalind that she was not always so 
scrupulous â€” so observant of the obedience 
due to parental authority; we were both 
indeed sad rebels to it ; and yet, if I recol- 



17 

lect right, she did not seem at that time 
to think either of us guilty of any great 
offence." 

" But because we have once been in er- 
ror, is that a reason we should always con- 
tinue in it?" 

" To be sure not," replied Kenmore, 
with a smile of deriding scorn curving 
his lip â€” " to be sure not, when we see 
substantial reason for regretting it. No, 
certainly; and changes and chances are 
continually occurring in life to make us, if 
not better, at least wiser. But go," he 
cried, throwing her hands from him ; " go, 
cold, unfeeling girl ! go, rejoin your sor- 
did parents, and with them congratulate 
yourself, that you timely escaped a con- 
nexion that could not ultimately have gra- 
tified the ambition that I now perceive 
alone ever actuated you to think of it." 

" This is insulting," said Rosalind, burst- 
ing into tears of passion, " and I will no 
longer remain to be offended by such lan- 
guage;" and as she spoke, she suddenly 
sprung past him, and bounded up the 



clifft, as the quickest way of making her 
escape. But he pursued her, and seizing 
her arm, forcibly detained her. 

They were near the edge of a steep, 
precipitous cliff at the moment, beetling 
over the sea; and the wildness of his looks, 
the fury that gleamed in his eyes, made 
her tremble with apprehension of his in- 
tentions. She shrieked. â€” " Do you mean 
to destroy me ?" she cried. 

" Destroy you !" he repeated contemp- 
tuously. " No; not even in death would 
I now liave our names united. Yet to 
rid the world of so fair a deception would 
be an act of kindness, for which some cre- 
dulous fool might yet thank me. Yet, 
ere we part, let me indeed see whether 
you are the deception I have called youâ€” 
whether, in your countenance, there is 
not some lineament â€” some indication, of 
the hoUowness of the heart within. But, 
no, all is fair, and smooth, and dazzling, 
as that treacherous element, now tranquil 
as the blushing heavens it reflects." 

As he spoke he again tossed her arm 



19 

from him ; but shocked, astounded, ovef^ 
powered by the bitterness of his reproaches, 
Rosalind had not immediate power to 
move from the spot. Oh, could she live 
under such reproaches ! â€” could she endure 
the thought of being deemed so abjectâ€” 
so heartless? No! impossible! Love him^ 
self could not compensate her for it ! To 
be an object of scorn to others was to bfe 
one to herself She would give up then 
all that she had so lately dwelt on with 
delight â€” she would deprecate his resent- 
mentâ€”she would renew her engagement ; 
honour, gratitude, feeling, all imperiously 
demanded its fulfilment; and she would 
rely on the consciousness of acting con- 
formably to their dictates for the restora- 
tion of tranquillity. 

Wrought up to this determination, she 
timidly approached, and laid her hand 
upon his arm, as he stood leaning, at a 
little distance from her, against a projec- 
tion of the cliff; but, starting at her touch, 
he drew back from it, and darted along. 

Rosalind again became terrified; the 



20 

feelings to which he was wrought made 
her shudder with dread, lest, with injury 
added to injury, disappointment to disap- 
pointment, he might be tempted to com- 
mit a deed of desperation. Oh ! should 
she have to accuse herself of driving him 
.to this, what would be the horrors of her 
guilty conscience ! what must be her por- 
tion, but raging frenzy, abhorred as she 
must then be both by God and man ! She 
shrieked at the frightful â€” the horrible 
idea, and called upon him to return ; but 
he continued to rush on, regardless of her 
cries, and she attempted to pursue him ; 
but the velocity of his movements mocked 
her efforts to overtake him, and she was 
sinking with terror to the earth at be- 
holding him rapidly approaching a ledge 
of rocks, that, broken into frightful chasms, 
the repository of deep whirlpools, required 
the utmost caution in crossing them, when 
the sudden interposition of a stranger ar- 
rested his farther progress, and saved her 
from despair. 

In a transport of gratitude, she dropped 



21 

on her knees, while tears gushed from her 
labouring and relieved heart; they were 
salutary, but still they were not the tears 
of actual repentance. Had they been so â€” 
had she made the rocky point on which 
she knelt an altar on which to vow amend- 
ment, pangs she would have shuddered to 
have anticipated would have been spared 
her; but still the world prevailed, and, her 
fright over, she began to rejoice she had 
not overtaken Kenmore, lest her efforts 
for a reconciliation should have been suc- 
cessful, and thus all hopes of aggrandize- 
ment ended. But how transient was the 
relief she experienced, when, slowly rising 
from her knees, her eyes encountered those 
of Mr. Woodburne, immediately facing 
her, and who, with his family, after a pro- 
tracted absence from home, had returned, 
a few days before, to Dunamore ! 

The intentness â€” the even more, the 
sternness, with which he was regarding 
her, instantly convinced her that he had 
been a witness of the recent scene ; and in 
agony at the thought of being betrayed to 



22 

him â€” him who had so much the power of 
injuring her with lord Dunamore, and 
whose rigid principles, as she considered 
them, would be but too apt to induce his 
doing so, her brain seemed to madden, 
and, after gazing at him for a moment, 
she suddenly started back, and bounding 
to the very summit of the cliff â€” " If 
you do not," she shrieked, " promise â€” 
swear, that you will keep secret what you 
have just witnessed and overheard, I will 
this instant plunge headlong from this 
spot!" 

Mr. Woodburne was not a man to have 
his feelings played on, and he was reply- 
ing to this threat by a smile of contempt, 
when the wildness of her gestures, the 
glaring of her eyes, really alarmed him. 
He hesitated a moment â€” then â€” " Well, I 
promise," he cried; and as he spoke, he 
extended his arms, to assist her in the de- 
scent. 

She came tottering down, and sunk ex- 
hausted into them ; an hysterical passion 
of tears ensued, and â€” " Oh, I am a miser- 



23 

able creature !" she cried, raising her head 
from his bosom. " You despise â€” you 
think me unworthy !" 

" Have I reason to deem you so?" he 
demanded. " The recent scene certainly 
makes against you ; but prove to me that 
the conjectures it has given rise to are er- 
roneous, and you will rejoice me. Who 
is that unhappy young man ? What right, 
or, rather, had he any right, to reproach 
you as he did?" 

Rosalind tried to say no, but felt it im- 
possible to do so ; and in unutterable con- 
fusion she averted her face. 

" You are silent," proceeded Mr. Wood- 
burne; " am I then to suppose that you 
merited the bitterness of his revilings ?" 

" Do not torture me by questions," 
again almost shrieked Rosalind. " Re- 
member your promise. I have a right to 
expect â€” to insist on your keeping it; for 
you â€” yes, you and yours, have been the 
occasion of what I am now enduring; but 
for your deception about lord Dunamore, 



24 

I should not have been entangled in this 
web of inextricable misery ;" and she al- 
most dashed herself, as she spoke, against 
the side of the cliff. 

But we shall not dwell on the scene; 
suffice it, that through her agitation, her 
reproaches, all she wished to have con- 
cealed was betrayed to Mr. Woodburne, 
and with astonishment he discovered the 
conduct she had been guilty of. â€” 'â€¢' Good 
God!" he exclaimed, and his heart was 
wrung at the thought, judging, by his 
own feelings, of what her parents would 
feel, had they made the same discovery. 

He attempted to remonstrate with â€” to 
advise her ; but she started away at the 
first intimation of his wishinoj to be au- 
thorized to interfere between her and Ken- 
more, and endeavour to bring about a re- 
newal of the engagement between them. 
â€” "No," she passionately replied; " the 
tie between us is broken, and never shall 
it be renewed ;" and in the violence of her 
almost-frenzied feelings, she proceeded to 



25 

accaise him of motives he would have 
blushed to have been influenced by for 
his anxiety on the subject. 

He heard lier with calmness, and when 
she had ended her ravings â€” " I forgive 
you," he cried, " your accusations, because 
I know you are not mistress of your rea- 
son at the moment, and that when you 
come to regain it, you will regi'et your 
language to me; I do more â€” I pity you," 

" Pity me !" repeated Rosalind, indig- 
nantly, stung to the quick by the tone in 
which the word was pronounced â€” " pity 
me !" 

"Yes, with all your brilliant advantages 
of youth, and beauty, and fortune, I pity 
you â€” pity you, because I know a being 
under the domination of such feelings â€” 
such headstrong passions, can never be 
happy." 

" I may deserve pity," said Rosalind, 
" but," and she burst into tears, " this cool, 
this contemptuous pity â€” and the next 
thing I suppose you'll do, despising me as 

VOL. II. c 



26 

you now do, is to make your daughter 
give up all further intercourse with me.'* 

" No," said Mr. Woodburne, " I would 
hot deprive you of a friend by whose ex- 
ample you may profit so much." 

" Her example !" and again Kosalind co- 
loured with indignation ; " and had he the 
insolence to set up his daughter, his cold, 
his unimpassioned daughter, tamed, sub- 
dued into insipidity by his rigid, his unre- 
lenting discipline, in competition with her 
â€” her so brilliant, so admired, so much an 
object of general admiration !" This indeed 
was galling, was wounding, and she could 
scarcely forbear aloud execrating the chance 
that had thus offered him the power of 
triumphing over her â€” of insulting her 
feelings. But at length she became ex- 
hausted by the violence of these; and as 
she grew calm, and reflection returned, 
she became fully sensible of the insolence 
and ingratitude she had been guilty of to- 
w^ards Mr. Woodburne; and in the anguish 
inspired by the thought, would have knelt 
to implore his forgiveness for it, but he 



27 

prevented her. â€” "No," he cried, " I do not 
require this humiliation to me; to that 
Being, whose forgiveness can alone restore 
you to tranquillity, humble yourself; and 
in imploring it, implore also assistance to 
enable you to regain the path from which 
you have so widely erred," 



CHAPTER 11. 



Meantime, while this scene of terrible 
humiliation to the proud and haughty 
mind of Rosalind was passing, Kenmore, 
saved from destruction by the interposi- 
tion of the faithful attendant who had ac- 
companied him to Ireland, was quitting 
Dunamore to return to England. The 
state of mind in which he returned home 
was no slight aggravation of the distress 
under which the earl and his mother were 
labouring. Immediately upon the setting 
c 2 



28 

aside of their marriage, it was resolemniz- 
ed ; but her re-establishment in all she had 
so long enjoyed could impart but little 
consolation to the mind of the countess, 
when she reflected on the irrevocable ex- 
clusion of her son from the advantages 
thus restored to her. 

Deprived of all the proud distinctions 
of his family, what joy could she derive 
from her own solitary participation in 
them? â€” oh! none! â€” joy and happiness 
must evermore remain strangers to her 
heart â€” for ever must she pine over â€” must 
she mourn, the blighted prospects, the lost 
claims, of her beloved Frederick. 

A common trial, she believed, she could 
have had fortitude to support; but this 
was out of the course of ordinary sorrows 
â€” one of those heavy inflictions that no 
comfort can I'each â€” no time alleviate. 

The earl felt as acutely what had hap- 
pened â€” nay, if possible, still more at times, 
from the dreadful appreliensions excited 
by what he saw her suffering. â€” " Oh !" 
in agony he would exclaim, folding her to 



29 

liis heart, and pressing her faded cheek 
with his lips, "let me not be stript of every 
comfort; doubly endeared by this trial, 
let your fortitude aid in supporting me 
under it." 

Soothed by his fond endearments, pene- 
trated by his anguish, the countess would 
appear to revive, but quickly again the 
torturing recollection of her son would 
overpower her transient efforts for compo- 
sure; and with hysterical sobs she would 
sink back into all the soul-rending and 
life-consuming anguish of unmitigable 
regret. 

At length her constitution utterly gave 
way, and all was now the wild extrava- 
gance of grief in her so late-happy dwell- 
ing, for even delusive hope could not flat- 
ter. Composed to the last, this angelic 
victim to deception, whenever weakness 
permitted, exerted herself to soothe this 
sorrow, and speak peace to the anguished 
hearts of those around her: But, oh, vain 
attempt! 'tis not when we stand beside 
the deathbed of our dearest friend â€” when 



30 
we behold the grave yawning to entomb 
the form we love â€” the valued of our hearts 
â€” the being long identified with us in 
every worldly interest, and pursuit, and 
feeling, that the anguished bleeding soul 
can listen to the voice of consolation â€” no! 
â€” till nature has had the full relief of tears 
â€” till returning recollection recalls the 
duty of resignation, and then, even then, 
how often will the anguished spirit sink 
back, and relapse into all the bitterness of 
grief, as still, from time to time, the me- 
mory of the past is revived and recalled, 
by that chilling â€” that terrible desolation, 
that is experienced when missing that 
zealous counsel, that ardent solicitude in 
our welfare, that patient endurance of all 
our imperfections, that love-beaming eye, 
that soul- cheering voice, we were so long 
accustomed to, that never yet met the ear 
but in the tones of affection or sympathy. 
But did we retain the friends we love, 
earth, with all its rankling thorns, its 
crosses and vexations, would then be a 
heaven, to which we should cling with 



31 

more than the tenacity of instinctive at- 
tachment. But even if one dear relative, 
one dear friend, be spared, let us bend in 
gratitude to Heaven ; for who can speak 
the desolation of the wretched being who 
feels there is none to receive their last 
sigh ? 

To each the dying countess recommend- 
ed the other, but, in particular, the anguish- 
ed object of her heart's dearest affections, 
to his father. â€” " By the long-cherished 
love that has existed between us," she 
cried â€” " by the touching remembrance of 
past happiness â€” by all that is noble in the 
nature of man, and due to the memory of 
faithful woman â€” your hopes of comfort 
here, and bliss hereafter, be Vv-atchful of 
him ! for a w^ounded spirit who can bear ? 
Let no wild extravagancies of feeling, into 
which he may be betrayed â€” above all, no 
new connexion, estrange you from him. 
You start â€” you are about to protest; but, 
oh, my beloved ! let no rash vow escape 
your lips! Yet but in the meridian of 
life, it is but natural you should form ano- 



32 

ther connexion ; and trust nrie, in this so- 
lemn hour of approaching separation, so 
purified is my love, so abstracted from 
every selfish consideration, that I should 
rejoice at the idea, from my anxiety for 
the re-establishment of your domestic hap- 
piness, not on account of my son : yet in 
your generous nature I will faithfully con- 
fide for him, nor fear then the double 
claims which Nature and misfortune have 
given him will ever be forgotten." 

That Heaven, to which her spirit was as- 
cending, theanguished husband called upon 
to witness, that no dependence, no confi- 
dence she reposed in him, should ever be 
misplaced. But how could she think it 
possible â€” how imagine that he could be cap- 
able of any consolation for her loss, but 
by attending to her wishes, and promoting 
the happiness of those who were dear to 
her? 

At length, after weeks of suffering, her 
gentle spirit took its flight. The expec- 
tation of her deaUi had but little effect in 
lessening the shock it occasioned her fa- 



88 

mily when it actually took place. But 
wild as was the grief of the husband and 
the son, it was exceeded by that of the 
mother : she, in the evening of her days, 
not only saw herself deprived of the only 
connexion on whom she had any positive 
claim for kindness, but had to accuse her- 
self of being the sad cause of her prema- 
ture death ; for to her guilty conduct was 
owing the imposition that, agonizing her 
maternal feelings, gave a shock to her frame 
that could not be got the better of 
This terrible conviction nearly unsettled 
her reason ; scarce could she restrain the 
wild shriek of agony from bursting from 
her heart, when she thought of standing 
alone in life, bereaved of all, yet undeserv- 
ing of aught but detestation. In the 
chamber of death they first met after their 
irreparable loss. Kneeling beside the an- 
gel they had lost, the ravages of time, no 
longer concealed, as had heretofore been 
the case, she presented an image of misery 
to the view it was impossible not to be af- 
cS 



fected by. Her gray hairs, her dim eyes, 
the tears that unconsciously dropt upon 
her withered bosom, pleaded for her. 

Unutterably affected, lord Monteagle 
would have raised her from the ground, 
but she resisted his efforts. â€” " No, no T 
she said, " the posture that best betokens 
heart-rending sorrow and contrition is the 
only one befitting me here; yet truly do 
I feel your compassionate kindness ;" and 
she pressed her ashy lips to the hand she 
continued to retain. " Yes, for all your 
goodness to me and mine, from my inner- 
most soul do I thank you, my lord ; to the 
last moment of erring life will the remem- 
brance of it be impressed upon my sorrow- 
ing heart ; but not much longer shall 1 in- 
trude on it â€” I wait but till the last sad du- 
ties are over, to retire to some solitude, 
where my shame and my sorrows may be 
alike concealed. Long since ought peni- 
tence to have led me to this, but the world 
had cast its spells around me, and in its 
enjoyments 1 sought to stifle the voice of 
conscience; but that voice is now awaken- 



35 

^d, never more to be silenced. The ilia- 
sions of life are over; humbled to the dust, 
I have at length met the punishment of 
my sins; but God is just, and chastens us 
in mercy ; his stripes lacerate the soul, but 
it is too often only by their infliction that 
we are led thoroughly to regret the past, 
and strive to regain the path from which 
tve have strayed. Oh ! had nothing oc- 
curred," and she shuddered fearfully, " to 
recall me to a sense of my misdeeds! 
Blessed therefore be his holy name, who, in 
the midst of judgment, remembereth mer- 
cy ; a broken and a contrite heart, he has 
said, he will not despise; and relying on 
this assurance, perhaps a gleam of peace 
may yet visit my anguished heart." 

Many considerations induced lord 
Monteagle to approve of the determina- 
tion she had avowed. After the discovery 
that had taken place, he was aware she 
could no longer expect to be noticed as 
she had hitherto been. Besides, at her 
period of life, and with her errors to repent 
of, he conceived retirement the only plan 



B6 

for her ; but to do every tiling that could 
evince his approval of it, not proceeding 
from indifference about her, was his gene- 
rous determination. A s the mother of his 
departed angel, she had claims upon him 
that were not to be overlooked ; and ac- 
cordingly she left his habitation amply 
provided with the means of secnring to 
herself every comfort she could desire else- 
where. 

In the first stages of his grief, it was 
only by doing what he conceived would 
have been pleasing to her he lamented, 
that the earl derived any consolation for 
her loss. He knew her fond attachment 
to her mother, and was soothed, according- 
ly, by the idea of having done for her 
what he knew she would have wished. 
But, oh ! busy memory too continually 
pictured to him all he had lost â€” the sad, 
the terrible reverse in his condition, to al- 
low even the calm produced by this to be 
of long duration. But a few weeks before, 
and what a flattering prospect was beheld 
of an accession of felicity 1 how gay, how 



87 

busy, were all in making preparations for 
bridal festivities ! what pageants were 
planned ! what fetes arranged ! â€” now how 
silent and deserted were the magnificent 
chambers that were tlien expected, by this 
time, to have been thronged by brilliant 
crowds ! â€” black ^Melancholy, indeed, seem- 
ed to have taken up her abode within 
them, and thrown around a deathlike si- 
lence and a dread repose. 

But reason at length began to assert its 
influence over the mind of lord Montea- 
gle ; and as the turbulence of his own feel- 
ings subsided, he felt alarmed at the effect 
which sorrow had produced upon the health 
of his son. In the selfish indulgence of 
his own grief, he had allowed him to brood 
over his sorrows without interruption, till 
his altered aspect aroused him to attention. 

With feelings of the liveliest condem- 
nation for his culpable negligence, he im- 
mediately planned an excursion to some 
of the distant counties, believing change 
of scene, and the exertions that must be 
made in going from place to place, would 



38 

have a better effect upon him than any 
thing else that could be devised for the 
purpose. 

Reduced by this time to a state of abso- 
lute inertion, tlirough the feelings he had 
indulged, Ken more wished to have re- 
mained quietly where he was; he could 
not, however, distress his father by declin- 
ing what he had planned for his benefit, 
and they accordingly set out on their cir- 
cumscribed tour; it was not, however, so 
much the feelings excited by the reverse 
in his fortune, as those occasioned by the 
death of his mother, that had reduced him 
to the state he was in. 

The first shock imparted by this reverse 
got over, there was a manly fortitude in 
his soul, capable of enabling him to bear 
up under it with equanimity ; but his mo- 
ther's death was an affliction, aggravated, 
as was his grief for it, by the cause to which 
it was imputable, that was completely 
overwhelming to all his strength of mind. 
No son, indeed, perhaps had ever loved a 
parent more ardently than he had done ; 



39 

so much in the light of an endearing friend 
and companion had she ever appeared to 
him ; but she was gone, and the world did 
not seem capable of affording him any con- 
solation for her loss. 

His body sympathizing with his mind, 
he became so indisposed, the day after set- 
ting out with his father, that they were 
obliged to make a pause in their journey. 
It happened to be in a large town, where 
they had not been long ere they became 
disturbed by clamorous parties parading 
the streets. Inquiring the cause, the earl 
was informed that the election for the 
county was not yet over, a dissolution 
of parhament having, just about this time, 
taken place; and questioning the waiter 
still further, he learned, with equal surprise 
and indignation, that one of the candidates 
was his own nephew, the honourable Mr. 
Kenmore, and who, as the eldest son of 
his brother, lord Kenneth, was now heir- 
presumptive to the honours of the family. 
The place for which he had set up was one 
in which the chief of the earl's interest lay. 



40 

and for which, therefore, but for what had 
occurred, it had been his intention to have 
proposed his own son. That any one of 
the family, more especially one so nearly 
allied to him, should have attempted so 
immediately to profit by the event that 
had prevented this intention being carried 
into effect, was a circumstance to excite 
his liveliest indignation, so unfeeling, so 
indelicate did it appear; yet when he came 
to reflect on the uniform conduct of his 
brother and his family, their evident de- 
monstrations of joy at the occurrences that 
had, to all appearance, destroyed his do- 
mestic happiness, he could not wonder at 
it. 

That Kenmore participated in his feel- 
ings on the occasion may naturally be sup- 
posed; he was indeed so agitated by it, 
that, in alarm, the earl began to conceive 
the idea of his going abroad, till better 
enabled to bear trials of this nature. As 
they pursued their journey, he suggested 
this idea, and Kenmore readily acceded to 
it, believing he should be under less re- 



41 

straint abroad than at home, and feeling, 
besides, that it was utterly impossible to 
think of mixing again in society till the 
wonder and curiosity excited by recent 
events had in a degree subsided; and 
accordingly, on their return to town, pre- 
parations were made for his immediate de- 
parture for the Continent, whither he re- 
paired, w^ith an intention of remaining till 
the earl had made all the requisite dispo- 
sitions for his future establishment in life. 
The indignation of lord Monteagle 
against those who had been the means of 
com}>elling him to give up the consolation 
derived from the society of his son, was too 
great to be concealed, and the utterance 
he gave to it occasioned such anecdotes 
relative to their unfeeling triumph on a 
late occasion, that to indignation was soon 
added invincible dislike, and all intercourse 
ceased between them. But of what tri- 
fling consequence was this to them, if they 
were still allowed to look forward to his 
title and fortune ? and must they be al- 
lowed to do so? must their barbarous ex- 



42 

ultation at his domestic afflictions remain 
unchecked? There was a way of putting 
a stop to it, but he recoiled from the 
thought. How could he think of giving 
another mother to his Frederick, while 
yet his filial heart was bleeding for her he 
had lost ? â€” no, impossible ! and yet there 
was no other way of disappointing the 
selfish hopes of those who triumphed at his 
expence. 

In a state of indecision, desirous of dis- 
appointing these, yet unwilling to think 
of any thing that could argue forgetfulness 
of her he had lost, he went on a visit to 
the house of a particular friend in the 
country. There were other guests besides 
himself, and amongst them a fair widow, 
of the name of Wolstenholme, rather past 
the summer of her days, but still retain- 
ing great loveliness of countenance, toge- 
ther with an elegance and sweetness of 
manners not to be surpassed. But what 
constituted her most attractive charm in 
the eyes of the earl, was an imagined like- 
ness to the deceased countess ; fascinated 



43 

by this, he soon began to distinguish her 
by his attentions, and gradually felt a 
warmer interest than admiration kindling 
in his bosom for her. Her age, her rank 
in life, were suitable, and the graciousness 
of her manner towards him, gave him every 
hope he should not sue in vain. But still 
he wavered â€” still he was withheld yielding 
to his inclination by fear and delicacy, lest 
he should be accused of w^ant of proper 
respect and affection for the memory of 
the deceased, or of growing indifference 
towards his son, when matters were brought 
to a point by the sudden announcement 
of Mrs. Wolstenholme's intended depar- 
ture. He could no longer, on hearing of 
this, refrain from explaining himself, and 
the result was favourable to his wishes. 
Ere the lovely widow took her departure, 
he obtained permission to follow her to 
town, and make preparations for their 
marriage on the expiration of his mourn- 
ing. 

This arranged, he lost no time in ap- 
prising his son of the circumstance, lest 



u 

allowing him to hear it through any other 
means should argue inattention on his side, 
or a wish to have concealed it from him ; 
but with hesitation and reluctance he pro- 
ceeded to the communication, but too well 
aware of the feelings it was likely to ex- 
cite. Of course, nothing that had a ten- 
dency to assuage these, or reconcile him 
to the measure, was omitted. He explain- 
ed his motives for first thinking of it, and 
concluded by repeated assurances of the 
utter impossibility of its making any al- 
teration in his affection for him. 

But in vain were these assurances re- 
ceived, even if Ken more could have con- 
fided in them, which, however, was by no 
means the case; for if his mother could 
so soon be forgotten, how could he hope 
to be remembered in the way he wished ? 
They could not have reconciled him to 
a circumstance he considered so disrespect- 
ful to her memory. Ere yet the tomb 
was well closed upon her â€” ere the weeds 
of sorrow for her loss were thrown aside, 
to have another fixed on to fill her place, 



was a thing he could not bring himself to 
think of with calmness. It had soothed 
him to think of returning home, but there 
was now no pleasure in the thought; for 
how could he endure to find his father oc- 
cupied with a stranger? how to find him- 
self but a secondary object where he h?.d 
been the first, as assuredly would now be 
the case ? In vain his father tried to per- 
suade him to the contrary. In admitting 
a belief, as perhaps he did, that the new 
ties he was about forming Avould not 
vveaken the old, he felt convinced he but 
deluded himself, and tried to deceive him. 

Concealing his real feelings, however, 
lest of any misconstruction of them, he 
simply replied to the earl's communica- 
tion, by thanking him for the pains he had 
taken to prevent his experiencing any dis- 
quietude at it, and expressing his wishes 
for his happiness in the approaching change 
of condition it announced. 

The pleasure he was beginning to taste 
in travel was completely interrupted by 
this communication. ]More restless and 



46 

unhappy than ever, he often wandered 
through the most enchanting scenes with 
a vacant eye, and, as much as possible, 
avoided society. The only person whom 
he seemed to take any pleasure in associat- 
ing with, was a young Englishman of the 
name of Herbert, of apparently frank and 
insinuating manners, who had come over 
in the same vessel with him, passed from 
France into Italy with him, and laid him- 
self out in a way for his acquaintance that 
could not be resisted. They were in Si- 
cily at the time of his receiving his father's 
letter, and a few mornings after, as he was 
sitting with Herbert, the latter, in a laugh- 
ing way, mentioned a billet he had receiv- 
ed from some fair incognita, appointing a 
meeting that evening, and which, under 
the pretext of Avishing to know whether 
Kenmore knew the hand, he said he would 
shew him ; accordingly he took out his 
notecase for the purpose ; in opening it, a 
billet fell out, which, under the idea of be- 
ing the one he intended to shew him, 
Kenmore picked up, and was about open- 



47 

ing it, when the other, snatching it from 
him, exclaimed â€” " No, no ! that is not the 
one, though perhaps not from a much less 
kinder fair." Then, after humming a mi- 
nute or two to himself, as he proceeded in 
his search for the one he pretended he 
wanted to shew, he suddenly paused ; and 
turning his eyes full upon his companion, 
demanded, in a very significant tone, whe- 
ther he had ever heard of a lady of the 
name of Wolstenholme ? 

Ken more hesitated to reply. â€” " Why 
do you ask ?" he demanded. 

" Why !" repeated the other â€” but you 
will think me a puppy if I say â€” " but, 
faith ! the fact is, that very billet I snatched 
from you was from that same INIrs. Wol- 
stenholme ; but come, let the subject drop 
â€” I have spoken au de pourvu." 

" Pardon me," cried Kenmore â€” " I can- 
not let it drop. If the Mrs. Wolsten- 
holme I have heard of be the same you 
know, I have the most urgent reasons for 
questioning you about her." 

" Well, that is easily ascertained," said 



48 

Herbert, and accordingly proceeded to 
give particniars, which soon succeeded in 
satisfying Ken more they were the same. 

" To explain then," said Ken more, on 
ascertaining this, " the reasons I have just 
alluded to, for questions you might other- 
wise deem impertinent, know that a par- 
ticular friend of mine has proposed for 
this Mrs. Wolstenholme, and that I am 
consequently anxious, in the extreme, to 
know whether she is worthy of his re- 
gard." 

Herbert shook his head. â€” " It is an af- 
fair delicate," he said, " speaking on these 
matters; interested in the subject, how- 
ever, as you are, I cannot be silent; what 
honour on one account would induce the 
concealment of, honour on another oblig- 
ing to be disclosed. The fact then, my 
dear friend, is, ISIrs. Wolstenholme is a 
lady whom I would rather see the wife of 
another than my own, although elle est 
belle au cqffre; and in addition to these 
generally-resistless charms, she has, besides, 
much personal loveliness. By chance I 



49 

fell into the snares she is in the habit of 
spreading for those who strike her fancy. 
Remember I am not to be accused of pup- 
pyism, as it is to oblige you I reveal the 
truth ; but as what is easily attained is 
seldom, I believe, from the perverseness 
of human nature, much valued, I soon 
got tired of the lady's partiality, and, in 
order to have a pretext for breaking with 
her, pretended business to the Continent, 
and bade adieu. But this is all under the 
seal of secrecy, or, rather, I give you leave 
to make what use you please of my infor- 
mation, provided my name be not called 
in question." 

Kenmore readily gave the assurance he 
required, and thus imprudently put it out 
of his power to vindicate himself from un- 
pleasant suspicions, in case what he ad- 
vanced from him should prove to be in- 
correct ; but of his veracity not a suspi- 
cion crossed his mind ; he had reason to 
believe him of a gay, perhaps dissipated 
turn ; but of the baseness and temerity of 

VOL. II. D 



50 

slandering a virtuous woman of exalted 
rank, he could not think him capable. 

How to act, in consequence of what he 
heard from him, perplexed him for some 
time; he feared the shock it would be to 
his father's feelings to impart it to him, 
and at length decided on writing to the 
lady herself His letter was as follows : â€” 



" To 3Irs. Wolstenholme, 

" Palermo, Obtober. 
" MADAM, 

"As the son of lord Monteagle, 
most reluctant do I feel to interfere with 
your engagement to him, aware, as I am, 
from this circumstance, of the misconcep- 
tion my motives are liable to for any in- 
termeddling in the affair: but this con- 
sideration, though a most powerful one, 
cannot influence me to appear indifferent, 
where the happiness of one so nearly con- 
nected to me is at stake. That this could 
not be prompted by his union with you, 
I have but too much reason, madam, to 



51 

believe; why, I am rather induced to 
think it must be unnecessary for me to 
explain. Should the contrary, however, 
prove the case, by his addresses being still 
permitted, I shall then, without further 
hesitation, be more explicit. Trusting, 
however, the painful necessity for this will 
be prevented, I have the honour to sub- 
scribe, 

" MADAM, 

" Your obedient servant, 
" Frederick Kenmore." 



Restless and unhappy, however, lest 
this precautionary step for the prevention 
of so disgraceful an union should not avail, 
he, shortly after, decided on following to 
England. 

On reaching London, he forbore going 
to his father's, until he had first ascertained 
that his marriage had not yet taken place. 
Rejoiced to find it had not, he no longer 
restrained his impatience to behold him ;

52 

but the pleasure of meeting was quickly 
damped by the coldness and constraint of 
the earl's manner. 

Could he have believed that the guilty 
consciousness of Mrs. Wolstenholme would 
have permitted the disclosure of his letter, 
he should have been tempted to imagine 
it was revealed to him ; but the silence of 
the earl on the subject confirmed the per- 
suasion under which it was written, name- 
ly, that she must be afraid to mention it ; 
and he could no otherwise, thinking this, 
account for what so wounded every feel- 
ing, than by supposing his father's affec- 
tion for him already on the wane. 

Stung to the heart by the surmise, he 
hesitated whether he should not withdraw 
from the paternal roof; but the feelings of 
nature were yet too powerful for the im- 
pulse of resentment. Still clinging to all 
he had loved, he shrunk from the thought 
of rushing upon life, a solitary, isolated 
being. 

Not however to diminished affection, 
but suppressed indignation, was owing the 



58 

alteration in his father's manner. Prepa- 
rations for his nuptials had commenced, 
when he received a letter from Mrs. Wol- 
stenholme, acquainting him that all far- 
ther idea of an alliance between them 
must be relinquished. His surprise at the 
receipt of such a one may well be ima- 
gined, unconscious, as he was, of any cir- 
cumstance to justify a change in the lady's 
sentiments. 

To submit without inquiring into the 
cause was, of course, out of the question; 
justice, both to himself and her, demand- 
ed an explanation; but in vain this was 
sought; neitlier entreaties nor expostula- 
tions were of any avail ; and after making 
what he determined should be a last effort 
on the subject, he was quitting her house, 
in a state of the greatest irritation, when 
he encountered Miss Pigot, a lady who 
resided with her, and who, interposing to 
prevent his precipitate departure, made 
him turn back with her into an adjoining 
apartment, where, with much anxiety, 
she demanded whether his interview with 



54 

her friend had obtained for him the satis- 
faction he sought? 

On being answered in the negative â€” 
*' You really have cause for complaint 
then," said she ; " but it is not to you only, 
but also towards herself, Mrs. Wolsten- 
holme acts injuriously, by her obstinate 
silence on a matter so essential to the feel- 
ings of each party to have fully elucidated. 
I admire generosity, but still I think there 
are bounds to it, as well as to every thing 
else ; we are not expected to be so com- 
pletely abstracted from self as entirely to 
immolate ourselves to it. I know I shall 
risk Mrs. Wolstenholme's displeasure by 
what I am about revealing ; but really I 
cannot be any longer withheld, by this con- 
sideration, from doing her that justice she 
refuses to do herself. You accuse her at 
present of caprice and inconstancy, where- 
as it is from real anxiety for your happi- 
ness that she has acted so as to incur these 
imputations;" and, vsrithout further pre- 
face, she proceeded to inform her deeply- 
interested auditor of the letter addressed 



55 

by his son to her friend, and her imme- 
diate determination, on the perusal of it, 
to give up all further idea of her intended 
union with him, yet without explaining 
why, lest embroiling the unhappy young 
man with him, to whose disinclination, 
from selfish motives, to the marriage, she 
entirely imputed the letter. 

It would be difficult to say what werQ 
the predominant feelings of lord jNIont- 
eagle on this explanation, whether he was 
most pleased at finding he still retained 
his place in the affections of JSIrs. Wol- 
stenholme, or hurt at being compelled to 
accuse his son of art and selfishness. 

^lore enamoured than ever of the fair 
widow, from the proof thus afforded of 
her noble and generous nature, he insisted 
on being readmitted to her presence, when, 
with all the eloquence of love, he pleaded 
his cause, and implored the renewal of 
their engagement â€” but in vain, though, 
by resisting his solicitations, it was evident 
]Mrs. Wolstenholme did violence to her 
inclinations ; but a bitter experience of the 



56 

misery attendant on rivalling interests 
conapelled her to this inflexibility. Mr. 
Wolstenholme, at the time of his propos- 
ing for her, was a widower, with a large fa- 
mily ; and the misery she had gone through, 
in consequence of the jealousy of his chil- 
dren, had determined her never to subject 
herself to the like again ; her feelings, 
naturally attempered to all that was ami- 
able, making her shrink, with a degree of 
horror, from dometic broils, which, as she 
felt persuaded, she should have to encoun- 
ter with lord jMonteagle, from the mo- 
tives to which she ascribed the letter of 
his son. 

In the first transports of his rage, at 
thinking he had lost her through his 
means, he would probably have uttered 
some rash vow respecting him, but for the 
interference of Mrs. Wolstenholme, who 
protested, if she had to accuse herself of | 
being the cause of the slightest misunder- 
standing between them, she would never 
see him more ; and whilst allowed to visit 
her, he could not altogether resign a hope 



57 

of yet prevailing on her to change her re- 
solution. But though, in conformity to 
her commands, or rather his promise to 
her, he refrained from speaking to Frede- 
rick on the subject of the treachery he ac- 
cused him of, he could not meet him with 
his usual manner ; and struck by the chill- 
ing change, the indignant and afflicted 
Kenmore fled to solitude, to conceal the 
anguish it occasioned. Good God ! and 
had his father united with fortune to de- 
press him ? Was it not enough that he 
had been precipitated from the proud emi- 
nence on which birth seemed to have pla- 
ced him, but that he must also be beat 
down by paternal unkindness ? The idea 
was not endurable â€” he could not think of 
remaining where he now seemed only to- 
lerated, and where, for a moment, it was 
impossible to avoid contrasting the past 
with the present ; and nothing but his in- 
ability to come to any immediate decision 
relative to his future plans, withheld him 
from immediately quitting his paternal 
home,

CHAPTER III. 



At this juncture, a friend, to whom Ken- 
more was warmly attached, arrived in 
London. 

Count Tulla was the descendant of a 
noble Irish family, but whose religion, at 
the period we are speaking of, not per- 
mitting their services to be devoted to 
their king, he, at an early age, entered 
the Austrian service, where, in progress 
of time, he attained distinguished rank. 

Through the imposition respecting her 
father, he had long supposed himself re- 
lated to the countess of Monteagle; and 
such was the regard he evinced for her> 
that little doubt was entertained of his 
being well inclined to lay his laurels at 
her feet, could he have flattered himself 
that the ambitious views entertained for 
her by her family would have permitted 



5d 

his addresses to be accepted. However 
this might be â€” whatever were the secret 
feehngs of his soul, he manifested none 
other for her than such as laid claim to 
her lasting esteem and friendship, enjoy- 
ing which so insured him the earl's, that 
he knew no other home than his when- 
ever in England. 

Frederick soon became to him not les& 
dear than were his parents ; he loved him 
for his own sake as w^ell as theirs, fre- 
quently declaring, as he played with him, 
that it was a pity he was born the son of 
a peer, as prosperity in him had spoiled a 
hero. 

AVith his warm feelings, and experien- 
cing what he did for the family, it may 
readily be conceived the shock he sustain- 
ed on learning the sad reverse in their do- 
mestic happiness. He would instantly 
have hastened to them, to offer such con- 
solation as was in his power, but for the 
impossibility of then obtaining leave of 
absence. 



60 

ISfonths elapsed after the countess's de- 
cease ere he could procure it ; at length it 
was obtained, and on the wings of friend- 
ship he hastened to make known his ge- 
nerous resolve respecting Kenraore. He 
had never married â€” never meant to mar- 
ry; and to make some compensation for 
what the ill-fated youth had been deprived 
of, he proposed adopting him for his son. 

The meeting between him and the ob- 
ject of his intended kindness was agitating 
in the extreme. The unavoidable con- 
trast drawn by the latter, between the 
warmth of his manner and the now-chill- 
ing coldness of his father's, was too much 
for him ; he groaned in agony of spirit, 
and bursting from his embrace, flung him- 
self upon a sofa, to hide, against its arm, 
the tears that burst with unrestrainable 
violence from him. 

Unutterably affected, the c*ount hung over 
him ; he bent beside him, and called upon 
him, by all that was noble and energetic 
in the nature of man, to raise himself from 



61 

this trance of grief, nor suffer an ill-judging 
world to suppose he placed such entire 
value on adventitious circumstances. 

Kenmore impatiently struck the arm of 
the sofa â€” " Oh, you know not â€” you know 
not!" he exclaimed; " deeper is the source 
of anguish in my soul; my father " , 

He tried to stop himself; but his heart 
was in that state of bursting sorrow that 
renders the expression of its feelings irre- 
pressible; and ere he was well aware, he 
had revealed to the count the cause of his 
augmented anguish. 

The sympathizing Tulla would have 
tried to persuade him that he was mista- 
ken in the idea that he tortured himself 
with; but for the new alliance he now, 
for the first time, learnt the earl had me- 
ditated, this was an offence to the memory 
of the departed he could not forgive. He 
that could forget â€” so soon forget, such an 
angel, might easily indeed be estranged 
from his son. â€” " And we will away," he 
indignantly exclaimed, as soon as he could 
trust himself to speak after the disclosure 



ear 

of Ken more, " we will away from these 
shores; and with a new father, a new 
home, a new country, I trust, my dear 
boy, all bitter remembrances of the past 
will speedily be effaced." 

No time was lost in making the neces- 
sary preparations for their departure, each 
goaded on, by resentful indignation, to ex- 
pedite it. This feeling for a moment was 
subdued in the mind of Kenmore, when 
the minute for taking leave of his father 
â€” of renouncing his home and his country, 
arrived ; but in the sterner soul of the 
count it was unappeasable ; he could not 
pardon the earl's quick forgetfulness of the 
deceased, and more anxious to evince than 
conceal his real feelings, parted from him 
with the most frigid coldness. 

The earl tried to stem his feelings ; but 
scarcely had the door closed upon his son, 
ere they burst forth with a violence not to 
be restrained. In the sad hour of perhaps 
eternal separation, all was forgotten in the 
terrible pang it occasioned. No more to 
see him â€” no more to hear him â€” him to 



63 

whom his heart now clung with all the 
fondness of revived affection â€” to lose what 
still seemed to connect him with the dear 
departed â€” oh, insupportable! and yield- 
ing to the agony imparted by the thought, 
he made an effort, but a useless one, to 
pursue and overtake him. 

The sudden exhaustion occasioned by 
the violence of his feelings had a salutary 
effect upon him ; his composure gradually 
returned, and he presently began to feel 
pleased that he had not been able to carry 
his recent wish into effect; aware, from 
what had occurred, that he could not 
place that confidence in his son requisite 
for social enjoyment, or compensate to 
him for the advantages he must have re- 
linquished, by declining the generous 
kindness of count Tulla. But had they 
been more explicit with each other, the 
cruel suspicions that empoisoned the mind 
of each would in all probability have been 
dissipated. 

The want of candour often leads indeed 
to incalculable misery ; the delicacy that is 



64 

sometimes pleaded as an excuse for it 
must certainly, therefore, be considered 
erroneous, as, indeed, whatever must, that 
tempts us to act contrary to truth and 
plain -dealing. By a trifling explanation, 
how often might distrustful friends be re- 
conciled, and invidious schemes detected 
and frustrated ! In this instance, had ex- 
plicitness been practised, Kenmore would 
probably have discovered that he had been 
the dupe of a villainous scheme, and his 
father, of course, convinced that in what 
he did he was unactuated by selfishness. . 

The brother and nephew of lord Mont- 
eagle had spies upon the actions of each, 
for the purpose of being timely apprised, 
should any project, hostile to the hopes so 
suddenly inspired, be in contemplation. 
Herbert was a creature of theirs ; of course, 
it must be unnecessary to say, that it was 
through their contrivance that he became 
the companion of Kenmore, in his excur- 
sion to the Continent, and afterwards 
his confidential intimate there. 

On learning of the earl's intended change 



65 

of condition, as soon as rage and resent- 
nient would permit them to collect them- 
selves, they set about devising how it 
might be prevented, and quickly decided 
upon the plan, which, for the present, had 
the effect intended. 

They knew enough of Kenmore to 
know, where his confidence was obtained, 
he might readily be imposed on ; and on 
this easiness of belief, where he entertained 
an opinion, built for the success of their 
nefarious plan. 

No being could be more calculated to 
prove a consolatory friend than count Tul- 
la, to tenderness of heart uniting strength 
of mind, and that exalted sense of religion 
that teaches us to bear, and instruct others, 
the vicissitudes of life with composure and 
fortitude ; and Kenmore absolutely clung 
to him with filial fondness. 

He had been a few months in Ger- 
many, and had got himself enrolled in the 
same regiment with the count, when a 
formal communication was received of his 
father's marriage with a lady, for whom, 



66 

on at length being convinced there was no 
hope relative to JNIrs. Wolstenholme, he 
had suddenly proposed. 

Though this was what Kenmore might 
now have expected, still it had all the ef- 
fect of a shock upon his feelings, making 
him feel as if a deathblow had been given 
to all hope of a perfect reconciliation now 
ever taking place between him and the 
earl. He strove to banish the bitterness 
of the reflection by plunging into dissi- 
pation ; and from the avidity with which 
he seemed to enter into this, none perhaps 
could have suspected his motive for it: 
but soon he had a cause for grief, that 
checked, perhaps providentially, this ca- 
reer. His kind, his generous friend, was 
seized with a dangerous illness, which, in 
the course of a short time, terminated fatally. 

Every worldly matter had previously 
been arranged, and, in consequence. Ken- 
more found himself, on his death, enno- 
bled by his title, and heir to his ancient 
castle in Ireland. But these were circum- 
stances that could not reconcile him to the 



6T 

loss of such a friend. To a heart consti- 
tuted Hke his â€” early accustomed to affec- 
tion, it was absolutely indispensable to 
have a bosom-friend â€” one who could feel 
and inspire a mutual interest; now none 
such remained to the afflicted Kenmore, 
and the world, in consequence, seemed a 
blank to him. 

The heightened esteem and admiration 
with which circumstances concurred to 
make him regard his character after his 
decease, aggravated his grief for his loss. 
Collected to the last, he evinced, through- 
out his dying moments, the most disinte- 
rested benevolence of disposition, express- 
ing his wish to have his paternal castle in 
Ireland kept up, for the sake of the poor 
people that were immediately dependent 
on the family ; and desired that a picture 
that would be found next his heart might 
be buried with him. â€” " And should cu- 
riosity, my dear lad," he said to his adopt- 
ed son, with the faint smile of nearly- 
exhausted nature, " induce you to exa- 



68 

mine it, perhaps the sight of it will not 
lessen your regard for your second father." 

This intimation was sufficient to excite 
the curiosity he alluded to; but how was 
Ken more affected â€” how surprised, when, 
in this loved picture, he beheld the like- 
ness of his mother ! The vague hints he 
had previously received of the count's ro- 
mantic passion for her were now confirm- 
ed; and with heightened admiration he 
viewed the character of a man capable of 
a love so pure and so constant, though so 
despairing; when he contrasted this hope- 
less constancy with his father's apparently- 
early forgetfulness of her, how much did 
the latter sink still farther in his opinion ! 

As he contemplated the lovely counte- 
nance of his mother, it seemed to him as 
if, adorned with celestial beauty, she had 
just started into life again, for the purpose 
of smiling on him. â€” " Angel of life and 
light !" he cried, as he bedewed the crystal 
with the fast-falling tears of renewed sor- 
row, " darksome and forlorn has been the 



69 

soul of thy son since this countenance was 
hidden from hiiA ;" with trembling lips he 
kissed, and then replaced it on the cold 
bosom of the gallant Tulla, to be with 
him shrouded in the grave. 

The affliction he experienced for his loss 
was so intense, that his health shortly be- 
came affected, and he was advised to ap- 
ply for leave of absence, to see what change 
of scene would effect for him. 

For a little while he hesitated to follow 
this advice; but a lingering wish to re- 
view the scenes endeared by memory, to- 
gether with the obligation he conceived 
himself under to see the wishes of the 
count carried into effect in person, prevail- 
ed ; and applying for the required leave, 
he obtained it, and set out for England. 

The weather was tempestuous, and off 
his native shores, the vessel in which he 
embarked was wrecked ; and of the num- 
bers that filled it, none escaped with life 
but himselfâ€” how, or by what means, he 
knew not. He was taken up, to all ap- 
pearance, lifeless, near a fisherman's hut. 



70 

at a considerable distance from the spot 
where the fatal occurrence took place, and 
for hours after evinced no symptoms of 
returning animation. 

A wild idea then took possession of his 
mind, to see how his death would be 
borne by his father. He saw, by the pub- 
lic papers he purposely procured, that his 
name was amongst those who perished in 
the recent calamity; and he felt that if 
that regret he allowed himself to imagine 
was manifested for it, it would be a means 
of reconciling him to life. 

As soon as able to travel, he set out, in 
disguise, for the seat of his father in the 
West, where he contrived to learn he now 
was. It was evening when he drew near 
it ; and the first sound that struck upon 
his ear was the merry pealing of the vil- 
lage bells in its vicinity. It was discor- 
dant to his feelings ; and stopping in his 
path, for he had alighted at some distance, 
he inquired of an old labourer, who was 
passing at the moment, the occasion of 
what he heard. 



71 

" Bless your heart ! you be a stranger 
then in these here parts to ask this ques- 
tion !" was the observation of old Hodge. 
" Why, zir, the ringing of these here bells 
be for joy of a young hek being born to 
the lord of the place." 

Kenmore started. â€” " What! to lord 
Monteagle?" 

*' Yes, sure, zir, to lord Monteagle 
himself; and in good time the young un 
is come, for my lord, but a little while 
ago, was quite beside himself with grief 
for the death of another son that was lost 

at sea â€” one that was But 'tis too long 

and too sorrowful a story to be telling 
now, for all the pubUc-houses, you see, 
zir, be thrown open, by my lord's order, 
to the villagers, and my old dame will be 
expecting me, after work, to take her to 
have a little jollification with the rest." 

" Well, I wont detain you, only just 
to ask, is lord Monteagle then quite com- 
forted and consoled for the son he has lost 
hy the birth of this one ?" 

" Oh yes, zir, quite! They do say 



he be quite himself again, as hearty and 
joyous as ever since he was born. And 
there is to be such a to do when my lady 
sits up again â€” such a power of fine folks 
expected at the christening !" 

Kenmore inquired no further ; he want- 
ed to hear nothing more to prove what he 
wished to have remained ignorant of, that 
he was no longer an object of interest or 
affection to his father. He rushed on, 
heedless, from the sensations of the mo- 
ment, whither he was going, till he found 
himself within the deep gloom of his na- 
tive woods â€” those magnificent woods, a- 
mongst whose romantic glades some of 
the happiest hours of his early youth had 
been passed, when all was gay and joyous 
â€” when no cloud rested on his prospects, 
and yet each succeeding day was expected 
to be brighter than the last. Now how 
changed ! how reversed the scene ! isolated, 
unconnected, exiled for ever from his na- 
tive home ! for, after what had occurred, 
never more could he bear to revisit it â€” 
never to re-enter a place where he had so 



73 

soon been forgotten, ere the weltering waves 
that were supposed to have entombed 
him had well almost time to have closed 
over him. And were the ties that con- 
nected him with existence really broken? 
and did a home or a country no longer re- 
main for him? There was anguish bor- 
dering on madness in the thought, and he 
precipitately fled the spot that gave birth 
to it. 

The inn where he put up was on the 
coast, and within sight of it was a vessel 
waiting for a fair wind to pursue its course 
to Ireland. He took a passage in it ; but 
on reaching his destination, the ancient 
habitation of his departed friend, he shrunk 
from entering it, on learning it was in the 
midst of a populous neighbourhood, that 
would not permit his arrival to be un- 
marked by hospitable greetings. Unable, 
from the feelings he had indulged, to en- 
dure the idea of entering society again, 
(for what, he argued with himself, should 
he do so ?) he forgot that whilst we live 

VOL. II. E 



'74 

we have duties to perform, and finally 
resigned himself entirely to despair. 

Rosalind was not forgotten, but her 
idea only aggravated his feelings. She 
was the first who had given him to know 
what he had to expect from his altered 
fortune; and while his imagination still 
dwelt on her exquisite loveliness, he thought 
of her perfidy with all the rancour of in- 
dignant resentment. Had she acted dif- 
ferently â€” had she made that return for his 
disinterested regard he had a right to ex- 
pect, how very different would his present 
feelings have been ! But she â€” she for whom 
he had encountered the resentment of his 
family, for whose sake he had been ready 
to sacrifice so much â€” she had been the first 
to make him know the anguish of disap- 
pointed confidence. But was she really 
to blame ? was her perfidy the impulse of 
her own heart, or the suggestion of her fa- 
ther? Oh! if he could but ascertain ! If, 
after all, he found her what he had once 
conceived her to be, what bliss â€” what 



75 

happiness, might not yet be his ! or if not, 
surely it would be some gratification to 
reproach her again for her baseness, and 
make her feel something of that pain it 
had occasioned him. 

One wild idea succeeded another ; he 
kept from all the secret of his escape, and 
leaving the place he had first visited, went 
wandering on towards Dunamore.

CHAPTER IV. 



In the meanwhile, colonel Glenmorlie had 
taken possession of his recovered property ; 
and in superintending the improvements 
they proposed making in the place, he and 
JMrs. Glenmorlie found agreeable occupa- 
tion for themselves; but how imperfect 
was the happiness Rosalind had anticipa- 
ted from the circumstance ! Contrary to 
the delusive expectations of vanity, she 
heard nothing â€” she saw nothing of lord 
Dunamore, and doubt and incertitude 
racked her mind ; yet she was not calcu- 
lated to make a slight impression; but, 
after the positive manner in w^hich she had 
rejected him â€” the way in which she had 
treated him, how could she alone possibly 
flatter herself that he would cherish, or 



77 

again give way to the passion she had in- 
spired ? 

It is not to be supposed that the admi- 
ration she had previously excited was less- 
ened by her having now become the 
heiress of considerable wealth: wherever 
she went she was followed, and more 
than one splendid offer was made her; 
but while she delighted in the general 
homage paid to her charms, she declined 
the most distant idea of changing her 
state. 

Her father and mother would have been 
more surprised than they were at the cir- 
cumstance, but that they imputed it to 
some lingering remains of attachment to 
Kenmore, her real sentiments concerning 
whom they still remained in utter igno- 
rance of, and of course wdthout having a 
suspicion of the real cause of the marriage 
between them being broken off. Anxious 
to do justice to his feelings to lord Mont- 
eagle, colonel Glenmorlie had made more 
than one effort for the purpose of ascer- 
taining this, but which the vigilance of 



78 

Rosalind, who, aware of the terrible con- 
sequences of an explanation between them, 
continued for ever on the watch, had ren- 
dered unavailing, but without her almost 
deriving any comfort from the circum- 
stance, owing to the reflection of the un- 
lucky chances that often take place in life, 
and that one moment might undo all she 
had been doing. 

But neither this apprehension, nor the 
incertitude she was in .about lord Duna- 
more, w^ere her only sources of uneasiness ; 
the fear she was under of Mr. Woodburne, 
and the dislike she had conceived to him, 
from the moment of his making the disco- 
very she had dreaded, had created a dis- 
like and shyness to visiting at the house, 
that, occurring just after the termination 
of the lawsuit, led to such a belief of her 
being influenced by circumstances, as hurt 
Mrs. Woodburne in a manner she could 
not conceal, like all warm-hearted people, 
resenting in proportion as she loved, and 
ignorant of her having given any cause of 
offence. 



79 

Colonel and Mrs. Glenmorlie, in their 
turn, became so offended with her con- 
duct, imputing it, as they did, to captious- 
ness of temper, or some unjustifiable sus- 
picion of their integrity, that by degrees 
a coldness took place on every side ; and 
they quitted the neighbourhood, without 
any wish being expressed by either party 
for the continuance of the intercourse that 
had once subsisted between them. 

Rosalind could not think of having 
been the secret cause of this coldness â€” the 
means of interrupting this ancient friend- 
ship, without the bitterest pangs of re- 
morse. Though she dreaded the severity 
of Mr. Woodburne, she yet considered 
him a truly-estimable character, and most 
affectionately loved his wife and daughter ; 
but this was not the only reason of her re- 
gretting the coldness that had taken place ; 
but for it, she conceived she should, from 
time to time, have probably been able to 
learn some intelligence of lord Dunamore; 
and this consideration heightened the un- 
happiness it occasioned her. At length. 



80 

languishing, on many accounts, for a re- 
newal of the intimacy that had existed 
between them, she prevailed on her father 
and mother to let her accept an invitation, 
which, the autumn after her leaving Du- 
namore, she had received from lady Dun- 
drum to follow her there; for her ladyship 
had left it with them, with the kind in- 
tention of remaining long their inmate, 
had not business, that was not to be ne- 
glected, very unexpectedly recalled her 
home. 

Scarcely had she alighted from the car- 
riage that conveyed her to her, ere, yield- 
ing to the impulse of her feelings, she 
flew out of the house to see the Wood- 
burnes. To her great joy she found Mrs. 
Woodburne and Anna alone-^she rushed 
into the parlour where they were sitting; 
and as she threw herself alternately on the 
neck of each, embraced them with a trans- 
port that was not to be resisted. 

Mrs. Woodburne could not behold the 
joyous tears she shed at beholding them, 
without being tempted to believe she had 



81 

wronged her by her recent suspicion ; and 
with a feeling of mingled reproach and 
delight at the idea, pressed her again and 
again to her heart. 

Mutual emotion having a little subsid- 
ed, conversation ensued. An hour sped 
dehghtfully, when Rosalind began to re- 
collect the promise she had made lady 
Dundrum, of returning immediately, and, 
under a hope of being asked to break it, 
carelessly mentioned it. 

" Well, we shall soon see you again," 
was the observation in reply. 

Rosalind involuntarily repeated the ex- 
pression to herself; it was not what she 
had expected ; and with a feeling of dis- 
appointment she knew not how to con- 
ceal, she looked alternately at the mother 
and daughter; both, she thought, looked 
confused, and the kind of consciousness 
she thought this indicated, of their not 
evincing towards her the wai-mth she had 
a right to expect, was very near producing 
some little appearance of resentment on 
her side ; but suddenly recollecting herself, 
E 3 



and the many errors she had been betrayed 
into, by hastily yielding to her feelings, 
she checked her inclination to this ; and as 
she shook hands with them at the door, 
pressed them to come to lady Dundrum's 
in the evening. 

" No â€” not this evening ; we can't in- 
deed," said Mrs. Woodburne. 

" Well, suppose," cried Rosalind, " if 
you wont come to her, I endeavour to 
prevail on her to '' 

" Oh, we will soon give you a.call !" 
exclaimed Mrs. Woodburne, eagerly and 
evidently for the purpose of preventing 
the proposal she was about making, and 
retreating, as she spoke, from the door. 

Rosahnd again felt vexed ; it was evi- 
dent they did not desire to see her again 
that day, and she could not help being 
hurt at the idea, from the anxiety she felt 
to pass it with them. But they might be 
under some disagreeable engagement, or 
expecting some disagreeable visitor, they 
wished her to know nothing about; for 
she would not believe that a perfect re- 



83 

conciliation had not taken place between 
them. Yes, it must be owing to this, or 
something of the kind, that they had e- 
vinced that little shyness that had vexed 
her; and giving way to the persuasion, 
she presently recovered from her discom- 
posure. 

She was sitting listlessly at a table, ap- 
parently listening to the chitchat of lady 
Dundrum, but in reality paying veiy little 
attention to it, when she was roused from 
her abstiaction, by her ladyship suddenly 
starting from her chair, and exclaiming â€” 
" Good God ! is not that lord Dunamore 
galloping across the strand towards Mr. 
Woodburne's?'* 

Rosalind flew to a window. â€” " Yes, it 
â€” it is him indeed!" she cried, almost 
breathless from emotion. " But why are 
you so surprised at seeing him ?" 

"Why! Why, because it is such a 
length of time since he has been here." 

" A length of time !" repeated Rosalind, 
who, though a thousand times his name 
had hovered on her lips during her visit 



84 

to the Woodburnes, had yet been deter- 
red, by various feelings, from giving ut- 
terance to it, and who accordingly had left 
them without any gratification to the in- 
tense anxiety she experienced to know 
something of bis proceedings. 

" Yes, a considerable time." 

** But notwithstanding his intercourse 
with the Woodburnes was not interrupt- 
ed," cried Rosalind. 

" No, certainly not." 

" And they were apprised by you of the 
exact day I would be here?" 

" Yes, assuredly : it w^ould have been 
odd if I had not told them, knowing how 
anxious they -were to see you." 

Rosalind nodded assentingly, while the 
flush of pleasure diffused itself over her 
countenance, and her eyes sparkled with 
delight. 

Ever prone to give way to the sugges- 
tions of vanity, the circumstance of lord 
Dunamore having been so long without 
paying a visit to the place, and then mak-. 
ing his appearance there again on the very 



85 

day of her arrival, led to the most flatter- 
ing conclusions on her side. It was â€” ^it 
must be on her account he had come, else 
why, after so long seeming to have desert- 
ed the place, choose the very day of her 
arrival to pay a visit to it ? 

So whispered Vanity, and her whispers 
were too delightful to be disregarded. 
Yes, he had heard about her from the 
Woodburnes ; and they, from their know- 
ledge of his sentiments for her, expecting 
what had occurred, had forborne wishing 
to see her again that day, lest he should 
wish for some little explanation ere they 
met again. Well, as she had previously 
thought, how unnecessary were any ap- 
prehensions about him! Forget her â€” give 
her up ! Oh, yes, that was very likely â€” 
very probable â€” very possible indeed ! No, 
no! chains linked by beauty and attrac- 
tions like hers were not very easily to be 
severed. Yet it was fortunate, after all, 
that she had paid her present visit to lady 
Dundrum; for there was a pride â€” evi- 
dently a stubborn pride, in his nature, that 



86 

might have made him hold out much 
longer, without seeking himself for an 
opportunity of coming to an explanation 
with her; but the chance one that was 
now afforded, he would eagerly avail 
himself of; and his real sentiments once 
fairly stated to her father, there would be 
an end of all further coolness at his side, 
and every thing would turn out as she 
could wish. 

Lost in the most delightful imaginings, 
she forgot she was not alone, till restored 
to the recollection by lady Dundrum re- 
suming her conversation with her. â€” " His 
intercourse with the Woodburnes discon- 
tinued !" she cried, adverting to w hat Ro- 
salind had just said ; " oh, no ! there was 
no great likelihood they would permit 
that; and if rumour is to be believed, the 
result of the intimacy has been very fa- 
vourable to the ambitious views of the fa- 
mily." 

Rosalind started â€” " How do you mean ?" 
she exclaimed. 

*^ Why, you have heard nothing then ; 



87 

Miss Anna made you no communication 
â€” gave you no hint this morning." 

" No ; she hinted nothing particular." 

" Really ! Well, to be sure, that ra- 
ther strengthens me in my unbelief of 
what I have heard." 

" What is it?" demanded Rosalind, im- 
patiently. 

" Why, what, if true, would prove that 
it was not for nothing that Miss Anna re- 
fused the late splendid offer that was made 
her; for I suppose you know the affair be- 
tween her and sir William Le Fleming is 
at an end." 

" Yes ; but that her refusal of him pro- 
ceeded from having no inclination at pre- 
sent to change her state." 

Lady Dundrum laughed, sneeringly â€” 
" Yes, so I know it has been asserted; 
but I confess I want faith in the asser- 
tion. To whatever motive it was owing, 
I am convinced it was not to that, but to 
an ambitious hope, originating in the in- 
timacy between his lordship and her fa- 
ther ; in short, to the young lady's think- 



88 

ing that supporters on a carriage were 
much more ornamental than a bloody 
hand, and the title of countess beyond 
that of dame." 

*' What ! do you mean to insinuate," 
exclaimed Rosalind, starting from her 
seat in the utmost agitation of spirits, and 
pacing the room with unequal steps, " that 
she aspired to lord Dunamore ?" 

" Yes, nothing less ; and not only that, 
but that, if report is to be believed, he 
has proposed for her." 

" Proposed for her !" exclaimed Rosa- 
lind, almost in a tone of shrillness, and 
suddenly stopping short as she was pacing 
the room ; " oh, impossible ! impossible !" 

" Yes, that is what I have declared," 
said lady Dundrum; " with lord Duna- 
more's right to fastidiousness, it was ut- 
terly impossible he could ever think se- 
riously of a girl with so little to boast of, 
either fix)m birth or accomplishments ; but 
then, in refutation to this, I have been 
reminded of the two splendid offers she 
has already had." 



89 

" And the capability of lord Dunamore 
to do justice to merit," cried Rosalind, 
suddenly recollecting herself, as, trembling 
with agitation, she flung herself upon a 
seat ; " Anna has sufficient merit to justify 
any offer that could be made her." 

" Yes, I know there is a great deal of 

seeming But, for my part, I am not 

very fond of your demure, quiet kind of 
people, as I always think there is some- 
thing sly in them. However, be that as 
it may, I should conceive a man of lord 
Dunamore's exalted rank would require 
something more than simple merit in the 
object of his choice â€” something brilliant; 
and you will acknowledge there is no- 
thing of that in Miss Anna, owing to her 
father's ridiculous whims about her educa- 
tion, making quite a study of it, as if, in 
reality, it was any consequence how a girl 
like her was brought up. I have no pa- 
tience with the arrogance and affectation 
implied by such conduct, or having it as- 
serted that what she wants in showy ac- 



90 

complishments, she makes up in superior 
sense and learning." 

Rosalind could listen to no more ; under 
the pretext of its being time to dress for 
dinner, she suddenly started up, and re- 
treated to her chamber; but it was long 
ere she could there bring herself again in- 
to any state of composure â€” ere she could 
get the better of the agitation and alarm 
communicated to her feelings by lady 
Dundrum's intimation. 

At length, by dint of arguments with 
herself, or rather the powerful influence of 
vanity, she was enabled to conquer her 
emotion, and recover the tranquillity that 
had been interrupted. Yes, through this 
she suffered herself again to be persuaded 
of the impossibility of being easily forgot- 
ten, or rivalled by a person so certainly 
inferior to her in striking attractions. She 
acknowledged Anna to be lovely â€” the 
justice that had been done to her by others 
would have compelled her to do so ; but 
then there was nothing brilliant about her. 



91 

and she knew lord Dunamore to be an 
admirer, not merely of grace, but anima- 
tion and spirit ; and then such an enthu- 
siast with regard to music, of which, 
through the caprice of her father, as, like 
lady Dundrum, she was now inclined to 
think it, poor Anna knew scarcely more 
than the theory. No, no; when she re- 
flected on all this, she felt convinced the 
fear she had given way to was absohitely 
ridiculous. Lord Dunamore, knowing 
the intimacy that had subsisted between 
her and Anna, had continued to pay atten- 
tion to the latter on her account ; and ig- 
norant of the motive for this, the gossips 
of Dunamore had, with the usual prone- 
ness of characters of their description to 
make up matches, and account for what 
they knew nothing about, given them to 
one another; and thus arguing with her- 
self, and finally completely settling the 
matter to her satisfaction in her own mind, 
she regained her spirits, and set about the 
pleasing task of decorating herself 

By patching, and piecing, and altering, 



and adding, lady Dundrum had converted 
her habitation into what she styled a cot- 
tage cyrne. Amongst the ornamental ad- 
ditions she had made to it, was a balcony, 
attached to the drawing-room, and into 
this, on completing her toilet, Rosalind 
stepped, for the secret purpose of exhibit- 
ing herself to the admiring eyes that her 
fluttering heart fondly whispered to her 
were eagerly watching to catch a glimpse 
of her. 

Under the idea of being observed by 
lord Dunamore, she was here playing a 
hundred coquettish tricks, when she was 
suddenly interrupted by the voice of Mr. 
Woodburne, underneath the balcony, ex- 
claiming â€” " What a pity that there should 
be such a display of grace and loveliness 
for nothing ! and to my knowledge," ad- 
vancing further into sight, " there is not, 
at this instant, any one in any of the ad- 
joining houses whose admiration would be 
worth obtaining." 

" Pshaw !" exclaimed Rosalind, affect- 



93 

ing to laugh, but colouring violently, and 
feeling even distressingly confused, at the 
idea of being surprised in such a manner; 
" is it for the sake of admiration you sup- 
pose I have been amusing myself here?" 

" And can you deny " 

** I will neither deny nor confess. But 
is this the way in which you welcome me 
to Dunamore again ?" 

" Could I welcome you in a more pleas- 
ing way than by speaking of your loveli- 
ness ?" 

" Ah, I see you are just what you were !" 

" I return the complim.ent." 

"Yes; but after what you have just 
said, the compliment to me is rather an 
equivocal one, I think. However, to 
shew you I feel no anger, come up, and 
fet me shake hands with you." 

" No, thank you, not at present ; for, 
by this time, I dare say my folks are on 
their way home." 

"Why, are they out?" anxiously de- 
manded Rosalind. 

" Yes ; they went out about an hour 



94 

ago, with a visitor who had just arrived, 
for a distant stroll; but, I dare say, as I 
have just said, they are by this on their 
way back." 

" A visitor just arrived!" So, after all, 
she had been rendering herself ridiculous 
for nothing; for, from the sudden chill 
thrown upon her feelings by what she had 
just heard, she could not help considering 
herself so, for the way in which she had 
been acting. 

Confused and mortified â€” confused to 
think that her coquetry was detected, and 
that instead of being anxiously on the 
watch to catch a glimpse of her, as she had 
flattered herself would be the case, lord 
Dunamore was amusing himself abroad, 
she hardly heard Mr. Woodburne bidding 
her good-bye : but she did not long per- 
mit herself to be cast down ; Mr. Wood- 
burne, after all, did not probably think 
what he had said, for he was in the habit 
of speaking in this manner ; and as to lord 
Dunamore, he might have been unable to 
avoid going out, and so she again became 



95 

all gaiety and expectation; she was not 
without hopes of the evening bringing 
him; but it advanced without this hope 
being realized. Well, this was only an 
additional proof of his deep resentment of 
her conduct, and she could not feel a pang 
at a circumstance occasioned by such a cor- 
roboration of the strength of his attach- 
ment. Fancy pictured him at once long- 
ing, yet unwilling to seek her ; indulging 
this idea, would it not be compassionate 
in her, she thought, to terminate the strug- 
gles he was enduring from pride? and so 
she suffered herself to be induced, in the 
course of the evening, to go out, scarcely 
doubting, that though he could not seem 
voluntarily to seek her, yet that what ap- 
peared a chance opportunity for joining 
her would not be neglected. 

She was not sorry that she had a pre- 
text for not going beyond the house of 
^Ir. Woodburne, for she was alone ; lady 
Dundrum, who would have thought it an 
absolute loss of so many hours of her ex- 
istence, not to have passed her every even- 



96 

ing at cards, being engaged at home with 
a loo party; but she paced the silver 
strand, without the meditations she ap- 
peared to be indulging being interrupted, 
and at length returned home, fatigued 
with her idle expectations; but still she 
would believe that it was to pride â€” stub- 
born pride alone, was owing their disap- 
pointment, and, under this persuasion, 
rose the next morning with renovated 
spirits. 

Lady Dundrum's dejeune was hardly 
over, when the Woodburnes made their 
appearance. â€” " And now for the pleasure 
I was compelled to deny myself yester- 
day," said Mr. Woodburne, extending his 
hand as he entered. 

After chatting for some time in a lively 
and general way â€” " I suppose," he cried, 
addressing himself to her, " you know of 
the visitor we have ?" 

" Yâ‚¬s, I believe so," returned Rosalind, 
with seeming carelessness ; " lord Duna- 
more; some one, I think, said he was 
with you." 



97 

** Yes, he is now with us, and deputed 
me to present his compliments, and say, 
that but that he was particularly engaged 
in writing letters, he would have had the 
pleasure of accompanying us to pay his 
respects to you." 

" Oh, there's no occasion for an apolo- 
gy ; whenever he is at leisure to call, of 
course I shall be happy to see him ; and 

so " and with seeming indifference she 

turned, and addressed some trifling ques- 
tion to Anna. 

But dissembling was not her talent â€” her 
anxiety to hear something further â€” some- 
thing more particular about him, in short, 
to obtain that gratification for her vanity 
she anticipated, was not to be suppressed, 
and accordingly interrupting herself in 
what she was saying to Anna, she sud- 
denly turned again to Mr. Woodburne â€” 
" And it is a long time since lord Duna- 
more has been to pay a visit here," she 
said, with a smile of involuntary signifi- 
cance. 

VOL. II. F 



98 

" Yes, and might have been much 
longer, but that " 

" Did he tell you so ?" impatiently ex- 
claimed Rosalind, and with sparkling ey^ 
on his pausing for an instant, through a 
slight cough. 

" What?" asked Mr. Woodburneâ€” 
" did he tell me what?" 

" Why, that " Here she suddenly 

recollected herself, blushed deeply, and 
became silent. 

" No, he did not tell me," resumed Mr. 
Woodburne, calmly ; " because I know 
myself, that, as he does not like this place, 
and can enjoy the society of the friends he 
has in it elsewhere, he would not have 
paid this visit to it now, but that he posi- 
tively engaged himself, some time ago, to 
accompany Anna to the ball that takes 
place to-morrow night here." 

" Engaged himself to Anna !" And was 
it in consequence of his engagement to 
her, and not to the flattering motive to 
which she had ascribed it, that his present 
visit was owing ? She turned pale â€” her 



99 

lip quivered, and with difficulty could she 
prevent herself from still further betray- 
ing what she felt at finding her vanity had 
again betrayed her. Was it true then 
that an attachment had been conceived 
for her? But, no; she would not admit a 
belief so torturing â€” so almost maddening; 
it was complaisance â€” mere complaisance, 
had induced him to act as he had done; 
and when they met, she should still find 
that she had not been mistaken in imput- 
ing the attentions he had paid her entirely 
to herself. 

Her colour revived at the consolatory 
idea; and by quickly entering into con- 
versation again, she trusted she had pre- 
vented any suspicion of the disorder into 
which she was thrown. She had pre- 
viously heard of the intended ball, but 
till now had scarcely bestowed a thought 
on it ; but now it was no longer a matter 
of indifference to her, and her thoughts 
immediately became occupied about her 
appearance there. Bursting upon him in 
F 21 



100 

a full blaze of beauty, how would his daz- 
zled senses be able to resist the eflfect she 
was calculated to produce upon them? 
Yet should he strive, would not the dread 
of rivalry effect what she wished ? Yes, 
it must â€” ^it would, and with delight she 
reflected on having it amply in her power 
to excite this. 

The duke of Blackwater had lately 
come over to visit his Irish estates ; part 
of them lying in the neighbourhood of 
her father, they had become acquainted ; 
and on hearing of her intended visit to 
Dunamore, he had mentioned his inten- 
tion of being at the approaching ball, with 
an intimation that it would be entirely 
on her account. He was just the kind of 
rival that must be considered formidable 
â€” of exalted rank, splendid fortune, and 
great personal attractions ; and while she 
anticipated with ecstacy the effect of her 
coquetting with him, she felt almost a 
sensation of delight, at having, as she 
conceived, a plausible excuse for this co- 



101 

quetry, and indulging her insatiable rage 
for universal admiration. 

Having looked over her adornments, 
and selected those she thought the most 
becoming â€” most calculated to set off and 
improve her natural charms for the next 
evening, she went out to pay some visits 
with lady Dundrum. 

On her return, she found lord Duna- 
more's card on the table. She was pleased 
he had called, but felt no regret whatever 
at not being at home to receive him, from 
what she meditated the next night. But 
while, through the suggestions of vanity, 
she looked forward to this night, with all 
the impatience of anticipated happiness, 
Anna, a stranger to any feeling of the 
kind, thought of it with one of a mingled 
description â€” with something of alarm, as 
of an ordeal which might chance to be the 
destruction of her hopes of felicity. 



102 



CHAPTER V. 



It may be remembered, her engagement 
to sir William Le Fleming was condi- 
tional ; but such was the sweetness of her 
manner towards him, that he scarcely en- 
tertained a doubt of its yet being fulfilled. 
It was her ardent desire that he should 
not find himself disappointed, both from 
the happiness she knew it would afford 
her friends to see her united to him, and 
the wish she felt to be under an impera- 
tive necessity of conquering a secret at- 
tachment for another. This attachment 
had stolen upon her; scarce had she got 
the better of her first unfortunate one, ere 
lord Dunamore became personally known 
to her, surpassing every idea she had 
formed of him, gifted with every grace 
and accomplishment that could render him 
dangerous to a young and susceptible mind. 



103 

For some time she deluded herself into( 
a behef that her delight in seeing â€” in 
conversing with him, were the effect of 
previous prepossession, and, under this 
idea, suffered herself to be drawn into the 
engagement already mentioned; but when, 
through various circumstances, convinced 
of her mistake, how impossible to describe 
her distress at finding she was attached 
where she never had been wooed, or en- 
couraged to bestow her affections ! From 
the first she had been aware of the heart 
of lord Dunamore being attached to an- 
other ; how then, from this consideration, 
and that of the difference of their rank, 
could she excuse to herself the weakness 
she had been guilty of! for to love with- 
out hope or encouragement, she conceived 
a weakness of the most degrading des- 
cription ; she forgot, in the harshness with 
which she reviewed her conduct, that love 
is involuntary ; that though it may be re- 
strained, and finally subdued by reason, 
it waits not at first for its slow approval. 
The discovery of her real sentiments made 



104 

her at first think with terror of the en- 
gagement she had entered into; but upon 
reflection she was rather happy at it, from 
the hope of its proving an additional sti- 
mulus to her overcoming a passion so hu- 
miliating to her. 

On accompanying her father and mo- 
ther on their annual visit to his kinswo- 
man, sir William obtained leave to follow. 
Mrs. Marsden's house was in the vicinity 
of a fashionable Spa; sir William therefore 
found no difficulty in prevailing on his 
mother and sisters to allow him to take a 
house for them there for the season. 

The former, a mere woman of the world, 
was excessively provoked at first on hear- 
ing of the choice he had made ; but, upon 
reflection, the probability there was of be- 
ing treated with greater deference by a 
daughter-in-law, who must consider any 
notice she took of her as a condescension, 
than by one of a more exalted rank, re- 
conciled her, in a degree, to the circumÂ« 
stance, and made her gradually, after her 
introduction to her, treat her with a de- 



105 

gree of kindness that agreeably flattered 
sir William, and could not but flatter 
Anna, from what she saw was her dispo- 
sition and usual manner to those she con- 
ceived inferior to her; while the young 
ladies, satisfied that they should not find, 
in their intended sister-in-law, any com- 
petition for the admiration they were so 
anxious of obtaining in the fashionable 
circles she was to be introduced to, through 
her connexion with them, deigned to con- 
duct themselves to her as a person worthy 
of some regard. 

But in proportion to the dissatisfaction 
they had felt at the idea of this connexion, 
was the delight of Mrs. Marsden at the 
contemplation of it. The same with lady 
Dundrum ; she could not think of being 
allied to a family of consequence, as 
through this marriage would be the case, 
without absolute ecstasy. She had pre- 
viously kept up an intimacy with Mr. 
Woodbume, merely because, as a man of 
business, she found it convenient at times 
to consult him about her affairs; but the 
f3 



106 

scene was now changed ; he was now not 
Mr. Woodburne, a kind of agent of hers, 
but her dear friend and valued kinsman ; 
while Mrs. Woodburne, from being a 
poor, stupid, inanimate being, who could 
only be tolerated on his account, was a 
dear, excellent-hearted, sensible creature, 
whom every one must love for her own 
sake; and Anna, darling Anna, instead 
of being a poor uninteresting thing, an 
absolute angel, that, to have been matched 
according to her merits, would have ob- 
tained a much more splendid offer than 
sir William's. 

Parties were given on every side, and 
Anna was everywhere introduced by lady 
Le Fleming as his intended bride. She 
tried to rejoice in what seemed to give to 
so many others pleasure; but her heart 
refused to obey her wishes : yet she did 
justice to the merits of sir William ; she 
was sensible of his worth, and truly grate- 
ful for his disinterested affection; and 
where there was esteem and gratitude, 
surely, she thought, love must follow; 



107 

yet still she drew back from fixing an 
exact period for the completion of his 
"wishes. 

Sir William began to grow impatient ; 
and as a proof that he would not admit of 
a much longer delay, began to give orders 
relative to their nuptials. Amongst va- 
rious articles, which in obedience to these 
were sent down from town, was a splen- 
did set of ornaments, which, for many 
reasons, he chose to make his mother the 
medium of presenting to her. 

Lady Le Fleming, ostentatious in eve- 
ry thing, took care not to offer them till 
there was somebody by ; but, to the asto- 
nishment of Mrs. Marsden, who, in her 
very best days, would have given herself 
to age and ugliness, for the sake of pos- 
sessing such decorations, instead of re- 
ceiving them with the flush of transport 
she thought they were so well calculated 
to excite, Anna turned pale on their be- 
ing offered to her, and finaUy accepted 
them with an air of irresolution and dis- 
tress, that absolutely enraged as well as 



108 

astonished this lady, from the insensibility- 
she conceived it argued to her good for- 
tune. 

Anna was indeed distressed, from the 
conviction they forced upon her mind, of 
the absolute necessity of coming, without 
any further delay, to a positive decision 
about sir William. She believed she had 
already done this; but the agitation she 
felt at this moment convinced her of the 
contrary, and, in a state of indescribable 
distress, she eagerly availed herself of the 
first moment she was alone to consider 
what was to be done. Now that the po- 
sitive moment was come, in which she 
must either finally accept or reject sir 
William, the invincible repugnance she 
felt to ratify her engagement convinced 
her she must either compel herself to the 
latter, or render herself miserable; and 
yet how could she do so, after the tacit 
encouragement she had given to his ad- 
dresses â€” how, without subjecting herself 
to the most injurious strictures â€” the re- 
proaches of her awn heart â€” his bitter up- 



109 

braidings, and, above all, tbe deep dis- 
pleasure of her father ? She now wondered 
how she could have been terapted to act 
as she did â€” how, without a certainty of 
being able to requite his regard, she had 
suffered herself to enter into any kind of 
engagement with him. 

Perplexed, embarrassed, she remained 
shut up by herself till summoned by her 
father. Sir William had not been able to 
forbear complaining of her coldness, and, 
in consequence, he deemed it but right to 
speak to her on the subject; the result 
was an involuntary confession of what she 
was enduring. *' 

Mr. Woodburne was agitated in the ex- 
treme by what she revealed. The match 
with sir William, with all his paternal 
pride, was far beyond what he had ever 
expected for her. Still, notwithstanding 
this, his natural anxiety for such an alli- 
ance, how, after what she had acknow- 
ledged, could he bring himself to persuade 
her to it ? He hesitated, deliberated, and 
at length finally decided on being candid 



110 

with sir William, conceiving he should 
act a much more honourable part, by- 
breaking off the affair, than, where so 
much was due for disinterested affection, 
allowing him to attain a reluctant hand. 
Had Anna and he been more on an equa- 
lity, with regard to fortune, he perhaps 
might have been tempted to act different- 
ly; but aware, from the disparity there 
was between them in this respect, of the 
construction that might be put upon his 
using any undue influence with her, he 
decided on acting as he did. 

Sir William, as may be supposed, did 
not bear his disappointment with calm- 
ness; his pride, exclusive of any other 
feeling, was deeply wounded by it, and 
he parted from Mr. Woodburne, under 
the impression of having been excessively 
ill-treated. But if he resented the con- 
duct of Anna, how still more bitterly did 
his mother ! she had not terms strong>e- 
nough to express the astonishment â€” the 
indignation, it excited. To have had him 
refused, where his slightest notice would 



Ill 

have been such an honour, really it was 
not endurable; there was one pleasure, 
however, to be derived from the thought, 
the hope that it would be the means of 
preventing any thing of romantic prepos- 
sessions for the future; and so ordering 
her carriage, and bidding the amiable 
young lady and her delectable connexions 
good-bye, she whirled off after him, with 
her daughters, to a more attractive place. 

Sarcastic, however, as were her com- 
ments, there was scarce any thing of ma- 
lice in them, when compared with Mrs. 
Marsden's ; her rage at what had occurred 
was not controllable â€” not because she was 
deeply interested about Anna, but be- 
cause she anticipated a variety of pleasant 
circumstances to herself from the union. 
She knew not whether to consider her 
most as a fool or a jilt, she said ; in either 
light, however, she considered her as a 
person no longer worth taking any trouble 
about. Her conduct on a former occasion 
had been quite ridiculous enough, refusing 
the advantageous offer that had been 



112 

made her, merely because the gentleman 
was not a saint ; but on the present it ex- 
ceeded credibility, for who would believe 
that any one in their senses could reduce 
themselves to the necessity of returning 
such splendid proofs of affection as sir 
William had given ? but there were some 
people fated to be always stupidly blind 
to their own interest ; and as to think of 
serving such would be out of the ques- 
tion, she begged leave to intimate, that 
whatever kindness she had the power of 
shewing should in future be reserved for 
those who had worldly wisdom enough to 
appreciate it properly. 

AH this grieved and agitated Anna; 
she was hurt to think of having appeared 
to deserve censure, and afflicted at the 
idea of being the means of any injury to 
her father ; and though the very reverse 
of worldly-minded, circumstances had oc- 
curred to render his continuing to stand 
well with Mrs. Marsden an object. Her 
unhappiness was aggravated by the per- 
suasion of his imputing her rejection of 



11.1 

sir William to some lingering remains of 
her first attachment. However, this could 
not be helped, for she almost preferred be- 
ing suspected of this, rather than the one 
she had had the weakness to give way to. 

The discomposure of her mind aiFected 
her health ; her father had certainly keen- 
ly felt the disappointment of his recent 
expectations concerning her; but he no 
sooner became sensible of this, than, sub- 
duing all further appearance of displeasure 
or vexation, he proposed an excursion of 
some weeks from home, under the hope 
of change of scene and varied objects 
having a salutary effect upon her spirits. 

At length, after digressing about for 
some weeks, they became stationary for a 
short time, in a very romantically-situated 
place, not very remote from the metropo- 
lis. 

It so happened that lord Dunamore, 
about this period, had paid a visit to this 
place; he did not, however, entirely con- 
fine himself to it, but made frequent ex- 
cursions from it, to view the enchanting 



114 

^enes in its neighbourhood. In one of 
those, as he was straying about by him- 
self, after having made up his mind to 
stopping for a few days in the lonely but 
beautiful village at which he had ahghted, 
he suddenly found himself, on passing 
through a thick shrubbery, on the edge of 
a rapid stream. Pursuing its course, he 
continued to proceed, till he found him- 
self in a spot that involuntarily arrested 
his steps. It was a solitary vale, scattered 
over with the ruins of a once-extensive 
abbey, interspersed with ancient trees, 
thickly clustering together in many places. 

Lord Dunaraore looked around him, 
but without observing any object that 
could interrupt the train of reflections the 
scene was calculated to excite. The ruins 
were widely scattered, and he began to 
amuse himself with endeavouring to con- 
nect them, and ascertain what tlie build- 
ing had been in its original state. 

While thus employed, the sky loured, 
and a thunderstorm coming on, he was 
glad to take shelter within the arch of one 



115 

of the gateways. On one side, through a 
small grated door, a narrow winding stair 
presented itself to his view. He ascended 
it, and found himself in a small apart- 
ment, which he immediately pictured to 
himself as having been the lodge of the 
porter, where many a devotee and wan- 
dering pilgrim had been questioned ere 
they could obtain admission to the place. 
The river expanded into a breadth before 
it, that gave it the appearance of a beau- 
tiful lake ; while, above the high and pic- 
turesque banks, the battlemented roof of a 
distant mansion was just seen ; but from 
viewing what was without, lord Duna- 
more quickly turned to view what was 
within ; a chair and table, scattered over 
with books, drawing materials, and draw- 
ings, gave evident proof of the place be- 
ing the favourite resort of some one of 
taste; and under this persuasion he be- 
gan to examine what he saw; but how 
impossible to describe his surprise, when, 
after looking over several of the drawings, 






116 

many of which he could not help thinking 
were intended for different sketches of 
Dunamore Abbey, he discovered amongst 
them a beautifully-finished likeness of 
himself ! 

People, it is said, cannot know their 
own likeness ; be that as it may, that this 
was intended for him was beyond a doubt, 
by his name being written on the back, in 
a hand that proved it to be a feminine 
one. Who was it that could have paid 
him such a compliment? The idea of 
Rosalind obtruded on his imagination, but 
he dismissed it with impatience ; after her 
conduct to him, it would have been a ri- 
diculous â€” an extravagant one indeed, to 
suppose it had been her. His curiosity 
was excited; whoever it was, it was as- 
suredly some one at present in the neigh- 
bourhood, and he determined to set about 
trying to discover. 

The storm soon passed away, and a full 
burst of melody from the adjacent thickets 
announced the joy of animated nature at 



117 

the circumstance. Lord Dunamore did 
not remain long after its subsiding; he 
was quitting the spot, when the sight of 
a female, advancing through the distant 
trees, made him involuntarily pause. She 
had not seen him, and he directly stepped 
back, in a direction that permitted him to 
observe her, without being himself disco- 
vered. Her looks inclining towards the 
ground, together with a large bonnet and 
veil, prevented his seeing her face, until 
she was pretty near him, when, suddenly 
uplifting her head, she disclosed to him 
the features of Anna. 

It was some time since there had been 
any correspondence between him and her 
father; his mind was sore and vexed by 
the conduct of Rosalind, and till he could 
bring himself to think of her with temper, 
he did not like to renew a correspondence 
that might compel him to mention her; 
of course he knew nothing of the move- 
ments of his friends at Dunamore. But 
the surprise he felt at so unexpectedly be- 
holding Anna was inferior to what h/e 



118 

felt at the discovery of her being the per- 
son to whom he was indebted for the com- 
pliment that had so much excited his cu- 
riosity, for that it was her he could not 
doubt. This, however, was no time for 
musing or reflecting; he instantly stepped 
forward, to express his pleasure at the 
unexpected meeting. 

The emotion of Anna took from her, for 
a moment, the power of replying to him. 
It was not wonderful, however, that she 
should be surprised at the suddenness with 
which he had presented himself to her 
view ; and to surprise alone he would have 
imputed the agitation she betrayed, but 
for the flurried manner in which, on learn- 
ing he had been compelled to seek shelter 
from the storm, she proceeded to inquire 
whether he had been within the place by 
which they were standing ? 

Lord Dunamore hesitated â€” stole a 
glance at her, and then compelled himself 
to answer in the negative. 

Her agitation subsided; she informed 
him of the tour they had been taking, and. 



119 

pointing out a still more extensive part of 
the ruin than he had yet examined, men- 
tioned its having been rendered habitable, 
for the purpose of letting occasionally, and 
its being now taken for a few weeks, at 
her particular request, by her father. 

He did not require to be invited to ac- 
company her back, so sure was he of al- 
w^ays being welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. 
Woodburne. On their account he con- 
tinued longer than he had originally in- 
tended in the neighbourhood, and, on 
quitting it, returned to be their inmate. 

He had never had such opportunities, 
nor such an inclination, for attentively ob- 
serving Anna before. The discovery he 
had made, or, rather, the suspicion it had 
excited, had created an interest for her 
till then unknown; and he soon found 
that the more intimately she was known, 
the more lovely and amiable she appeared ; 
the diffidence, or rather gentleness of her 
disposition, preventing any ostentatious 
display of what she was. Till now, in- 
deed, in consequence, he had no idea of 



120 

the real strength or energy of her mind, 
or its varied attainments, encouraged as 
she was by his efforts to draw her out, and 
unsuspicious as she was of any thing that 
could have confused or thrown a restraint 
on her. 

But the pleasure he took in her com- 
pany soon became interrupted by the al- 
tering manner of her father. He must in- 
deed have been much less observant, less 
penetrating than he was, if the quick al- 
teration that took place in her appearance 
and manner, on this unexpected meeting 
again with lord Dunamore, had not gra- 
dually led to a suspicion of the error he 
was under, with regard to the real cause 
of her rejection of sir William, and finally 
made him feel unhappy at their increasing 
intimacy. The attentions which, but for 
this, he would have been flattered by lord 
Dunamore paying her, now rendered him 
miserable, from the too great probability 
there was of their confirming her attach- 
ment; and while he knew not, from her 
regard for him and delicacy to her, how 



121 

to check them, he involuntarily betrayed, 
by his manner, the dissatisfaction they oc- 
casioned. 

Lord Dunamore could not but surmise 
the cause of this, and was, in consequence, 
impelled to consider what his intentions 
^vere concerning her, or whether he had 
any serious ones ? He could not speedily 
determine; and since in doubt, he decided 
on acting as feeling and honour required, 
by immediately terminating his present 
visit. 

But the society to which he returned 
afforded him no compensation for that 
which he had relinquished. There was a 
charm in the manner â€” in the gentle con- 
verse of Anna, that had impressed itself 
upon his imagination, aided as it was by 
the softening, the flattering idea of the 
sentiments he had inspired, without any 
effort on his part. There could be no 
doubts of any other motive than pure, ar- 
dent, disinterested affection leading to 
the acceptance of his hand. Why then 
throw from him what he was so covetous 

VOL. II. G 



to possess. He hesitated, deliberated, and 
finally came to a sufficient explanation* 
with Mr. Woodburne, to obtain his per-^ 
mission to become a candidate for the fa- 
vour of his daughter. 

We shall pass over what Mr. Wood- 
burne felt on this occasion ; suffice it, eve- 
ry anxious fear was at an end, and Anna 
returned home in a very different frame 
of mind from that in which she had quit- 
ted it, yet still with the same quietude of 
manner that had always distinguished her; 
and through this, and the unboastful si- 
lence of her parents, who did not choose 
to speak on the subject of lord Duna- 
more's addresses, till a positive period had 
been fixed for their union, nothing certain 
was known concerning it. Rumours pre- 
vailed; but, like almost Â«all rumours, they 
were alternately believed and contradicted, 
according to the various wishes or dispo- 
sitions of those who heard them. 

The less ostentatious Anna was of her 
happiness, the more truly perhaps she felt 
it; yet it was not without alloy. She 



123 

could not but think that there was more 
of the calmness of friendship than the ar- 
dour of passion in the attachment of lord 
Dunamore for her ; yet still as it occurred, 
she strove to dismiss a thought that, like 
dark vapours stealing on the horizon of a 
summer sky, only started to cloud and dis- 
turb her mind. Yet what but affection â€” 
real affection, could have induced lord 
Dunamore to propose for her ? She had 
no rank, no riches, if indeed those could 
have had that effect, to allure him ; and 
still, as often as unpleasant thoughts would 
obtrude, she sought to encourage the re- 
flection. But notwithstanding the confi- 
dence she reposed in his sincerity, or tried 
to persuade herself she reposed, she did 
not see Rosalind again at Dunamore with- 
out agitation. Should it be the pride she 
had wounded that had hurried him into 
forming another engagement, or if he had 
mistaken resentment for the subjugation 
of passion ; but no â€” he was not a light, a 
trifling character, to yield to hasty im- 
G 2 



124 

pulses, or act in any manner to occasion 
repentance to himself or misery to others. 
Still she wished the first meeting between 
them over ; this would decide â€” this would 
prove ; yet should it confirm the fears that 

would obtrude yet, if there were any 

grounds for them, how much better to 
have them now confirmed, than when too 
late for the avoidance of lasting wretched- 
ness ! 

Various feelings, though not perhaps 
revealed to either, had prevented both her 
and her mother from introducing the name 
of lord Dunamore during the visit Rosa- 
lind had paid them immediately after her 
arrival, or encouraging her to come back 
when they were expecting him, lest of 
any embarrassment to either party from 
an unexpected meeting. 

At length her arrival was mentioned by 
her father to him. The eyes of Anna 
were fixed on him at the moment, from 
being aware, owing to a previous question, 
of what it was about. 

" Indeed !" he said, in a tone of calm- 



125 

ness, and the flutter of Anna's bosom in a 
degree subsided. 

If he could see her with the same com- 
posure with which he had heard her arri- 
val announcedâ€” but how wide a difference 
between only hearing her name mentioned 
and actually seeing her â€” seeing her im- 
proved in every grace â€” matured in beauty 
â€” lovely almost beyond imagination to 
conceive! Well, the next evening would 
be the test of this; and with mingled 
anxiety and apprehension she looked for- 
ward to it. 

It came, and the duke of Black water, 
who, with a large party, had arrived in 
the course of the day at Dunambre, and 
been immediately to pay his compliments 
to Rosalind, was her escort to the ball. 

It was so late before she chose to go, 
that dancing had commenced ; and the 
first set being over, the company were dis- 
persed in detached parties about the room. 
The instant she entered, her eyes were 
cast round, in quest of those she was so 
interested about. She soon perceived 



126 

them engaged in conversation with a par- 
ty at the upper end of the room ; thither 
she directly advanced, but she was not 
immediately observed. At length, lord 
Dunamore, glancing round, perceived her, 
and started with a degree of emotion that 
crimsoned his whole face at beholding her 
so suddenly. Rosalind, laughing, turned 
to shake hands with Anna, and speak to 
some others of the party she knew ; then 
addressing lord Dunamore â€” " You did 
not exactly expect to see me this evening, 
I believe, my lord," she said. 

" Why do you imagine so ?" he replied, 
but evidently in some little agitation ; "it 
was a pleasure I certainly was led to ex- 
pect." 

" Indeed ! but, as a matter of no conse- 
quence, you did not let your thoughts 
dwell on it; for had you been thinking of 
seeing me," and she again laughed, with 
something of malicious coquetry in her 
look, " you would not have been so sur- 
prised when you actually beheld me." 

Lord Dunamore tried to return a rally- 



127 

ing answer, but he felt disconcerted ; he 
was vexed that there should be any thing 
like emotion in his manner at seeing her, 
though certainly it was owing to his not 
having been aware of her approach. Yes, 
he would have been still more hurt, in- 
deed, had he been able to impute it to 
any thing else, even though not under the 
obligation he was from honour to think 
no more of her ; for, after trifling with his 
feelings as she had done, what w^eakness 
to have still persevered in an attachment 
to her ! and yet, if loveliness could have 
excused â€” could have justified such a weak- 
ness â€” but he suddenly turned away, as if 
to speak to some one else, and Rosalind, 
with a nod to Anna, and a smile of secret 
satisfaction, wheeled off to another part of 
the room. But whatever were the secret 
tieelings of lord Dunamore, he soon regain- 
ed an appearance of composure ; had 
Rosalind seemed to participate in them, 
the case indeed might have been different ; 
but she was utterly mistaken in the con- 
duct she adopted for trying to obtain a 



128 

triumph over him. In proportion to the 
levity and coquetry she displayed was the 
disdain she inspired ; and when, after long, 
perhaps involuntarily watching her, his 
looks again reverted to Anna, it was with 
a glance that seemed to say, he congratu- 
lated himself on the exchange he had 
made. Her unassuming manner, the 
chaste correctness of her dress, her retiring 
air, that seemed to say she wished but to 
be assured of the homage of one, formed 
a contrast, at the moment, with the levity 
of Rosalind, that failed not of having its 
due effect upon him. 

She had declined dancing again, under 
the pretext of its being too fatiguing to het* 
from the heat of the room ; and he now 
offered his arm to her to walk about. A 
mountain seemed at the instant lifted from 
her breast, for she had not been unobser- 
vant of what was evidently passing in his 
mind, and this quick reverting of his 
thoughts and attentions to her dissipated 
every uneasy doubt and apprehension. 

The meeting she had dreaded had taken 



129 

place^ not without some indication of emo- 
tion certainly on his side ; but it was too 
natural, from what had occurred, and too 
transient, to permit her to let it give her 
any uneasiness. While, in consequence, 
she strove to dismiss it from her thoughts, 
Rosalind clung to the reflection as the 
only means of keeping her from the de- 
spair of thinking, that, after all, there was 
some truth in the report respecting her 
and lord Dunamore, with so much calm- 
ness, so much composure, almost after 
the first moment of meeting, did he meet 
her eye whenever their looks seemed ac- 
cidentally to encounter, and with so vague 
or unimpassioned an air did he listen to 
her, as from time to time, in the course of 
the evening, their respective parties again 
came in contact ; but still â€” still she would 
not believe that this was aught but the 
semblance of indifference. The emotion 
he had evinced at seeing her, through his 
being taken so unawares, that he had not 
time to collect or compose himself, was a 
confirmation of this supposition. If he no 
g3 



130 

longer experienced any interest about her, 
why evince the agitation he had done? 
and what agitation â€” what emotion, had not 
his start at the instant â€” the sudden flush 
that overspread his cheek â€” the indistinct 
exclamation that hovered on his lips, be- 
trayed ! Yes, he might look cold, and ap- 
pear reserved, and seem unconcerned ei- 
ther by what she said or did ; but he had 
discovered too much, when off his guard, 
to permit this to affect her. 

Elevated by the thought, she attempted 
not to check her natural volatility, and, 
from the encouragement she gave the 
duke, left him no reason to doubt his gal- 
lantries being acceptable. The supposi- 
tion could not fail of having the effect she 
wished upon lord Dunamore, she conceiv- 
ed ; and the next morning, after a little 
further struggle with pride and resent- 
ment, would bring him in alarm to her 
feet. 

She was sitting at a late breakfast with 
lady Dundrum when he was suddenly 
announced. â€” " I was not wrong then in 



131 

the persuasioo I gave way to," she cried 
to herself, as involuntarily she stooped 
over her cup, to conceal the deep suffusion 
which his appearance, from the motive 
she ascribed it to, occasioned. He brought 
a message from Anna, that she would soon 
follow, and this confirmed the delusive 
belief of Rosalind ; for if not impatient 
for an interview â€” if not requiring to see 
her by herself, why should he have come 
till Anna was ready to accompany him ? 

She looked impatiently at lady Dun- 
drum, to see if there was any likelihood 
of her soon concluding her breakfast, when 
there might be a chance of her quitting 
the room ; but she shewed not the smallest 
inclination to finish it in a hurry ; and Ro^ 
salind perhaps would not have been able 
much longer to conceal the petulance her 
loitering over it so occasioned, when, for- 
tunately, her ladyship was called out of 
the apartment on business. â€” " And now," 
thought Rosalind, and her heart began to 
throb with violence â€” " well, if I served 
him right, I believe I should punish his 



132 

stubborn pride, by keeping him some time 
longer in suspense about my real senti- 
ments ; but I think I must be gracious." 

Her graciousness, however, was not put 
to the test; lord Dunamore, who was 
standing at a window at the moment of 
lady Dundrum's quitting the room, was 
not immediately aware of it ; and when he 
missed her, it was only to cast a careless 
glance round it, and turn again to the 
window, to watch the progress of a distant 
sail he had just observed. What! was 
she then mistaken ? had she deceived her- 
self? was the internal exclamation of Ro- 
salind. But no ; she could notâ€” she would 
not believe she had ; he was only trying 
to collect himself; and her heart began to 
palpitate with increased emotion when 
the door opened and Anna entered ; and 
ere mutual greetings were well over, Ro- 
salind had the inexpressible mortification 
to learn, that, instead of lord Dunamore 
having eagerly preceded her, as she had 
permitted herself to imagine, he had mere- 
ly come on before her, in consequence of 



133 

her stopping at a house where there was 
a person sick she wanted to inquire after. 
To what severe mortifications does va- 
nity subject us ! But for the overweening 
idea she entertained of herself â€” the abso- 
lute belief she entertained of the impossi- 
bility of any one who once admired her 
being easily alienated from her, and that 
beauty was an equivalent for a thousand 
defects, she would not have experienced 
the pang she now did. With difficulty 
she controlled her feelings â€” with difficulty 
prevented the bitter tears of mortification 
and disappointment from gushing from 
her ; but though she suppressed her emo- 
tion in a degree, she could not altogether 
disguise it; and on Anna tenderly inquir- 
ing whether she was not unwell, she caught 
at the suggestion, and affecting an incli- 
nation to try the repose that was recom- 
mended to her, she was shortly, in conse- 
quence, left to herself. But repose was 
not for a mind distracted like hers ; and 
unable either to remain in a quiescent 
state, or endure the idea of the intrusions 



134 

she was liable to, if she remained withiii 
doors, she hastily put on her bonnet, and 
hurried to a solitary part of the beach. 
Unconsciously she proceeded, till she sud- 
denly found herself at the spot where the 
last meeting between her and Kenmore 
had taken place; involuntarily she drew 
back, and would have retreated from it, as 
a place calculated to awaken recollections 
and reflections she could ill support ; but 
at the instant she fancied she heard foot- 
steps behind her, and unwilling to be seen 
by any one in the state of agitation she 
was in, she forced herself to seek the re- 
treat it afforded. Whenever the idea of 
Kenmore occurred, as quickly as possible 
she strove to banish it her thoughts, con- 
nected, as it was, with remorse and seli>-up- 
braidings; but she now found it impossi- 
ble to do so, from the manner in which it 
was forced upon her by the recollections 
that were here awakened â€” the terror, the 
fright she had here endured, and could 
never think of without trembhng. Of the 
death of his mother â€” the marriage of his 



135 

father, she had heard, and she sighed to 
think that her conduct perhaps had been 
a cruel aggravation of what he had been 
destined to endure. â€” "Yet, if I did give 
him cause of complaint," she said, " may 
he not yet be amply avenged ? or, alas ! 
rather, is he not so at this very instant ?" 

The tears that had been long struggling 
for vent gushed from her ; and covering 
her face with her hands, she wept bitter- 
ly. Her heart, bursting with feelings she 
dared not disclose to any one, required the 
relief of tears. To acknowledge that she 
had to endure the tortures of remorse, and 
the anguish of disappointed love â€” no ! 
she would sooner die than humble herself 
to do so ! She uncovered her eyes. The 
summer waves were stealing with a stilly 
murmur towards the cove. â€” " Oh that I 
were as I was," she cried, " when first I 
listened to the murmur of those waves, 
and gazed upon this boundless expanse of 
water, as free from blame, as unconscious 
of any cause of regret " 

She started, for at the instant she fan- 



186 

cied she heard some one close to the cave ; 
she looked out, and, to her unutterable 
confusion, beheld lord Dunamore in a 
leaning attitude near the entrance. Oh ! 
if he had overheard what she had been 
saying, her exclamations against herself â€” 
her regrets about another! and overpow- 
ered by the thought, she tottered back, 
almost fainting against the rocky wall 

Lord Dunamore rushed to her support. 
â€” ." I fear I have startled you," he cried, 
*^ by my unintentional intrusion." 

Rosalind turned her almost-closing 
eyes upon him, and eagerly examined his 
countenance. There was nothing of dis- 
dain or indignation in it ; and revived by 
the conviction â€” " No," she replied, " it 
was not that â€” but this place â€” that is, I 
niean"-i â€” In extreme confusion she added 
â€” " One cannot sometimes review the 
early scenes of their childhood, without 
feelings being awakened that sometimes 
nearly overcome them." 

Lord Dunamore assented to the truth 
of the observation. â€” " Yet this can never 



137 

be the case/* he said, " except where the 
present ones form a distressing contrast to 
the innocently tranquil and happy ones 
then experienced â€” a cause for emotion, on 
reviewing the scenes of your childhood, 
that I must trust and hope you neither 
have now, or ever will." 

Rosalind sighed involuntarily, and shook 
her head ; but the subject was too delicate 
a one to be pursued, and so hastily chan- 
ging it, she stepped from the cave. In their 
way back, she inquired for Anna. He had 
left her engaged with some morning visi- 
tors, was the reply. Then to not having 
the power of enjoying her conversation in 
the way he wished was his coming out 
owing to, perhaps; yet when, in a few 
minutes after, on his offering her his arm, 
she fancied she felt it tremble, she was 
again almost tempted to believe it might 
be imputed to another cause. Her vola- 
tile feelings, in a moment depressed or 
elevated, she wanted nothing more than 
this persuasion to restore her to herself; 
and by the time her walk was ended, there 



138 

were but little traces of iinhappiness in 
her looks or manner. But to bring lord 
Dunamore to the explanation she requir- 
ed, she now began to see she must adopt 
a very different line of conduct from that 
on which she had first decided; that it 
was not by alarming his jealous fears, but 
by inspiring him with confidence in her 
regard, she could hope he would be expli- 
<jit. As she yielded to the conviction, she 
wondered this had not struck her before ; 
but it was not too late to retrieve what 
her coquetry had endangered, and she al- 
most regretted that the departure of the 
duke of Blackwater prevented her having 
an opportunity of proving there was an 
end of this. 

There was now no further restraint be- 
tween her and her old friends ; but though 
she continually saw lord Dunamore, there 
was still no effort, no attempt, on his part, 
to bring matters to a conclusion between 
them. Still, however, misled by vanity, 
she would persist in believing that this 
was owing either to some lingering re- 



139 

mains of resentment, or else a (^oubt of 
her regard, through her recent conduct. 
This latter surmise had the effect of in- 
ducing her to assume a still-greater soft- 
ness in her manner towards him, and evince 
the happiness his attentions afforded. 

Lord Dunamore no longer felt disdain 
or anger, but he almost wished he could 
have continued to do so. He had come 
with an avowed intention of stopping for 
a week or two at Mr. Woodburne's ; but 
that he had, he certainly should not have 
delayed his return to the abbey; but 
though he was constrained, at least, so he 
persuaded himself, to remain, there was 
no necessity for his being constantly in the 
company of Rosalind â€” there certainly was 
not, and so he determined rather to shun 
than seek her; yet notwithstanding this 
determination, it so happened that he ne- 
ver went out alone â€” that, through some 
means or other, he either did not see or 
meet her ; and in the solitary and often- 
protracted rambles that ensued, there were 
often involuntary allusions and references 



140 

that had but too often a softening effect 
on each. 

Lord Dunamore no sooner became fully 
sensible of this, than he became equally 
so of the necessity there was for terminat- 
ing this dangerous intercourse. What- 
ever had been the previous motives of 
Rosalind for rejecting him, he had innu- 
merable reasons for now believing a second 
rejection would not have been experien- 
ced, and no sooner became impressed with 
the conviction, than he decided on acting 
as honour required. That she knew no- 
thing â€” suspected nothing, of his engage- 
ment to Anna, was evident ; but it was re- 
quisite she should no longer be kept ig- 
norant of it: yet he wished it had not 
been left to him to reveal ; but how could 
he urge the Woodburnes to the disclosure, 
as if he did not take pride or pleasure in 
it himself? They need not have been so 
scrupulous, he thought, as to decline men- 
tioning it till he had fixed decidedly on a 
day for the union ; it would have saved a 
vast deal of misapprehension and perplex- 



141 

ity, and perhaps unhappiness, if they had 
been less reserved. But his petulance was 
but transient â€” while he continued silent on 
the subject, how would it have been con- 
sistent with either pride or delicacy for 
them to have mentioned it ? . and from be- 
ing angry with them he now became an- 
gry with himself. But in vain he was 
impelled, by the most powerful considera- 
tions, to explicitness with Rosalind. As 
often as his lips opened for the purpose of 
making the requisite disclosure, something 
still occurred to prevent it â€” some look, 
some glance from Rosalind â€” some evidence 
of imagined love and confiding tenderness, 
to send back the secret to his heart ; but 
it must be told, and finding he had not 
the power of absolutely mentioning it, he 
desperately adopted another method for 
making it known. 

He had ordered some splendid orna- 
ments fi-om Dublin for Anna; they ar- 
rived, one evening, when both Rosalind 
and lady Dundrum were expected at the 
cottage: he accordingly did not produce 



142 

them till after they came, and then under 
the pretext of wishing to know whether 
they met the approbation of the party. â€” 
" Approbation ! Why, my dear lord," cried 
lady Dundrum, with her usual flippancy, 
^'they are absolutely beautiful â€” quite like 
a bridal present!" 

Lord Dunamore smiled. â€” " I trust they 
will be considered as such, ma'am," he re- 
plied, in a tolerably-collected voice ; and 
instantly closing the boxes, he put them 
into the hand of Anna. 

There was a silence for a minute ; Anna 
and her mother were agitated, and lady 
Dundrum and Rosalind transfixed through 
surprise. For a moment she thought she 
must have sunk beneath the terrible shock 
of that instant; for a moment her sight 
grew indistinct, and her ears seemed to 
ring with hollow murmurs ; but a violent 
effort enabled her to recover herself Oh ' 
had she sunk beneath what she endured 
at the instant, she felt she must have died 
with shame and regret ! 

" Well, really," exclaimed lady Dun- 



drum (the first who regained the power of 
utterance), " I am so delighted ! Permit 
me, my dear creature !" and she kissed the 
flushed cheek of Anna, "to congratulate 
you on your happy prospects ; and you, 
my lord," turning to address lord Duna- 
more, who had walked involuntarily, per- 
haps, to a window, " but that I might be 
accused of flattery, I would tell you that 
you will certainly be considered as one of 
the most enviable of men." 

Lord Dunamore bowed. â€” " I need no 
assurance of that, my dear ma'am," he re- 
plied, with a smile, and forced himself 
again to join the party. 

" And we may now reckon, I presume," 
continued her ladyship, still addressing 
Anna, " on keeping your friend a little 
longer with us ; for I am sure she will not 
leave us now, when she must know you 
will wish her to remain." 

"Certainly not," Rosalind tried to say; 
but again a mist seemed to spread itself 
before her, and she turned sick ; she wish- 
ed to have asked for a glass of water, but. 



144 

fearful, or rather shrinking from the 
thought of drawing observation upon her, 
she hastily snatched up the cup of tea that 
was lying before her, and eagerly swallow- 
ed it. â€” " Certainly not," she then said, 
again recovering herself; " I never like to 
break a promise, and I â€” I â€” long ago pro- 
mised Anna to be her brideraaid." 

Lady Dundrum had engaged herself to 
another party that evening, where there 
were cards. Rosalind had at first decided 
against accompanying her, but her mind 
was now changed ; she was too confused, 
too bewildered, too agitated, not to dread 
betraying herself, except she had the power 
of collecting herself She took leave of 
Anna as usual ; but on lord Dunamore of- 
fering his hand, she involuntarily shrunk 
back ; she was sorry, the next moment, she 
had not had a greater command over her 
feelings, lest he should conceive she resent- 
ed : yet had she not a right to resent ? 
But how could she betray resentment with- 
out also betraying regret? and would she 
not rather die than let him suppose he had 



145 

excited that ? She wished to have return- 
ed home immediately, but from the con- 
struction that might be put upon the cir- 
cumstance, she resolved on remaining. 
Yes, cost her what pangs it would, she 
determined on staying till she had wit- 
nessed the marriage ; it would be a means 
of not only saving her from still deeper 
humiliation, but of inflicting on her the 
punishment she merited ; for, but for her- 
self, what, at this moment, might not her 
feelings have been ! how different â€” how 
enviable! and more than once she was 
again tempted to exclaim that Kenmore 
was indeed amply avenged. Yet there 
were moments when her indignation and 
anger became transferred from herself to 
lord Dunamore. To so soon forget her â€” 
attach himself to another, without making 
an effort to introduce himself again to her. 
notice, what insensibility did it not argue? 
and then to so nearly lead her into betray- 
ing herself by his insidious attentions; 
but, no â€” they were not ; she had allured 

VOL. II. H 



146 

him into paying them by her altered 
manner ; and accuse him of what she might, 
she could not of want of feelingâ€” of gene- 
rosity and honour. 

There were races about taking place at 
this time at Covetown, and the whole 
party, that is, the Woodburnes, lady Dun- 
drum, and Rosalind, were invited by lord 
Dunamore to the abbey on the occasion. 

Rosalind, aware of what she was likely 
to endure from its acceptance, would have 
declined it, but for the motive to which 
she feared her doing so might be imputed. 

She was not mistaken in the pang she 
anticipated to herself she should endure 
from finding herself again at this delight- 
ful place, and seeing the paradise that love 
had created for her enjoyment â€” a love that, 
from the very first, she had returned with 
all the energy and fervour of passion now 
devoted to another; but whatever were 
her regretful, her resentful feelings, such 
were the exertions the powerful stimulus 
of pride enabled her to make, that never 
had she appeared more amiable, more en- 



147 

gaging, more captivating, than at the pre- 
sent time. 

But how deceitful is the human heart ! 
While she imagined she was only wishing 
to hide what was passing in her own heart, 
she was, in reality, wishing to make lord 
Du nam ore draw comparisons between her 
and Anna â€” wishing to make him sensible 
of the difference there was, in all that was 
brilliant and dazzling, between her he had 
lost and her he had gained. In vain she 
thought of the wrong she was doing her 
friend by such conduct; she could not 
forego the soothing gratification it would 
be to her pride, to think she had not been 
utterly relinquished with indifference. 

Every look, every word, was now cal- 
culated to charm â€” all her powers, her too 
exquisite powers of captivation, were called 
forth; caprice was banished; she was all 
that was gentle, endearing, and compla- 
cent, taking an affectionate interest in the 
happiness of all about her, and apparently 
regardless of the general admiration she 
H 2 



148 

excited ; and a thousand times lord Du- 
namore, as he now observed her â€” now 
gazed at â€” now listened to her, thought 
within himself he must have mistaken her 
character â€” that had he allowed himself a 
little further time to study it â€” that had 
he not suffered himself to be offended, be- 
cause she was offended â€” justly offended, 
he could not now help thinking, for the 
deception that had been practised on her, 
he would have found she was all that he 
had pictured to himself he should find her, 

and But it was treason to his Anna to 

pursue the thought ; yet he could not help 
wishing that Kosalind had not again cross- 
ed his path. 

In this wish poor Anna secretly joined, 
not that she was capable of suspecting her 
lover of any thing dishonourable, or her 
friend of any thing treacherous ; but from 
what she now saw, she could not avoid 
fearing, at times, that she was not always 
recollected by them. Could she be assu- 
red of this â€” assured that lord Dunamore, 
in the least degree, regretted his engage- 



149 

ment ! but except she was â€” no, she could 
not give such a shock to the feehngs of 
her parents, as breaking with him would 
impart â€” could not relinquish her own 
bright visions of felicity. If at one mo- 
ment she doubted, the next she became 
reassured, lord Dunamore never becoming 
sensible of any inattention to her, that he 
did not redouble his tenderness and assi- 
duities; but this state â€” this tormenting 
state of doubt and hope, confidence and 
distrust, was not destined to be of long 
continuance. 

The races were over, and she and Rosa- 
lind, and lord Dunamore, after strolling 
about, one morning, till the heat became 
overpowering, took refuge from it in the 
cottage already described. The moment 
they entered, Rosahnd, as she tossed off 
her bonnet, seated herself at the harp, 
w^hich, on a musical party being given 
there a few evenings before, had been sent 
there for her. 

Lord Dunamore at first seemed only 
vaguely attentive; but by degrees his at 



150 

tention became completely engrossed by 
the syren before him, and he ceased to re- 
collect who else was present. 

" Warm on her cheek the sultry season 
glowed;" and but too conscious of her 
dazzling beauty at the moment, Rosalind 
determined to aid it by every fascination 
in her power. 

Anna observed him, and became agitat- 
ed, but determined not to give way to 
her emotion : at length, after a long silence 
â€” " You are fond of music," she ventured 
gently to say. 

" Yes, I adore it," replied lord Duna- 
more, involuntarily. 

A deep sigh as involuntarily escaped 
Anna, and recalled him to recollection. â€” 
" That is, I mean," he added, colouring 
violently, and in extreme confusion, " I 
love it where there is a natural taste for 
it ; not where it is cultivated, as some au- 
thor, Richardson, I believe, observes, as 
a mere maidenly attraction or accomplish- 
ment, to be given up when the lady 
changes her state." 



151 

Anna tried to smile. â€” ** Certainly," 
she said ; " because in that case there can 
be no natural taste or genius for it, as, I 
believe, we are seldom known to abandon 
what we have either for â€” that genius 
which," and again she sighed, " I almost 
envy those who have been born with." 

" You have no occasion," cried lord 
Dunamore, warmly, " to envy any one ; 
you are already too highly gifted to ren- 
der any additional ones requisite to make 
you all that is amiable and attractive." 

" What is that you are arguing about?" 
demanded Rosalind, suddenly pausing. 

" Nothing of any consequence," was the 
reply. 

" Well, I am glad of that," she cried, 
starting up, " as I can stay no longer here; 
for I must seek a cooler station till cooler 
hours advance;" and as she spoke she 
bounded out before them. 

At a little distance were a series of ro- 
mantic caves, much visited by the curious 
and inquiring, from the variety of fantas- 
tic appearances they presented to the view. 



152! 

and the beauty of the shells and pebbles 
with which they were strewed. They 
were dangerous to resort to, however, from 
the suddenness with which the tide flowed 
in upon them on its return, except to 
those who were aware of the circumstance, 
more than one instance hemg- on record of 
the fatal consequences of ignorance of it. 
Into one of these, bearing a strong resem- 
blance to an ancient hall, or the long- 
drawn aisle of a cathedral, from the fis- 
sured rocks that extended to its extremity, 
like a series of pillars, for the support of 
its fantastic roof, Rosalind now led the 
way ; and as she seated herself on a stone, 
with a bed of glistening sand beneath her 
feet â€” " I have been wanting, this some 
time, to shew you this place, my lord," 
she<jried, addressing lord Dunamore, " to 
see whether it could not be converted into 
an occasional retreat. I have given it the 
name of Amphitrite's Bower; and here, I 
think, it would be delightful, in the heat 
of summer, to breakfast and dine at times, 
and have evening parties, and music 



153 

mingling with the ripple of the waves, 
and dancing, if not upon the yellow, at 
least upon the silver sands." 

Lord Dunamore laughed â€” " Assured- 
ly," he said, " there would be nothing to 
take off from the pleasure but a shght ap- 
prehension of danger." 

" Oh, as to that, that could be guarded 
against by a little watchfulness !" 

Lord Dunamore assented ; and in laugh- 
ing and chatting, and pretending to talk 
over her plan, and consider of what inno- 
vations could be made in the adjoining 
caves, for the purpose of rendering this 
one more commodious, they utterly for- 
got where they were, till recalled to the 
recollection by loud shouts from the cliffs 
above. 

Lord Dunamore started up, and at the 
same instant Rosalind, casting her eyes 
towards the entrance, beheld the waves 
rolUng in upon them, A wild and ap- 
palling shriek burst from her â€” " We are 
lost," she exclaimed, " for I know there is 
not a boat at hand." 

h3 



154 

Lord Dunamore cast a look of agony at 
her and Anna ; he hesitated for an instant; 
then snatching her up in his arms, he 
rushed with her through the waves, and 
succeeded in bearing her to a place of 
safety. 

For an instant her senses had forsaken 
her. What she felt when, reviving, she 
found herself safe â€” found lord Dunamore 
supporting, bending anxiously over her, 
may easier be conceived than described. 
The bliss, the rapture of that moment, 
which gave to her the assurance again of 
being dear and precious to his heart, com- 
pensated to her â€” amply compensated, for 
all of previous pain or agony she had en- 
dured; her head involuntarily sunk back 
against his bosom, and her eyes closed, to 
hide the delicious tears that filled them. 
But she was not long lost in this selfish 
indulgence of her feelings; she suddenly 
started from his arms ; and as she wildly 
cast her eyes around her, uttered the name 
of Anna with a piercing shriek. 

Lord Dunamore started, as if his heart 



155 

had been transfixed, at the moment, by a 
scorpion's sting ; and striking his forehead, 
rushed from the spot 

He knew not what he meditated, when 
the sight of Anna, in safety, restored him 
in a degree to himself. The man who 
had aroused them to a sense of their dan- 
ger had hastened to her rescue. 

Lord Dunamore sprung forward the 
moment he beheld her, and attempted to 
take her hand. For an instant she shrunk 
back, as if wishing to avoid his touch; 
then, as if recollecting herself, gave her 
hand. 

" Can you forgive " lord Duna- 
more was about exclaiming, but checked 
himself No; if she saw his conduct to- 
wards her in the light he saw it himself, 
she could not forgive him ; and under the 
faint hope she might not, he determined 
on not giving utterance to an expression 
calculated to render her sensible of it ; but 
the result proved he was deceived in this 
hope. To be deserted at such a moment 
â€” left to chance-humanity for preserva- 



156 

tion, what a proof of his being indeed 
mistaken, with regard to the real nature 
of his sentiments for her! but with the 
pangs attendant on this conviction, came 
a gleam of consolation at the thought that 
he had betrayed himself ere it was too late. 

Rosalind slowly â€” reluctantly followed 
him, almost unable, from the conscious- 
ness she felt at the moment, to endure 
the idea of encountering the eyes of Anna, 
lest of meeting the flash of scorn from 
them â€” that scorn which, if situations had 
been reversed, she was well aware she 
would herself have experienced at the mo- 
ment. 

But it was not by scorn Anna meant to 
express what she felt; yet most difficult 
did she find it to carry the resolution she 
had formed into effect ; when she thought 
of the terrible blow it would be to the 
fond hopes and expectations of her parents, 
her breaking with lord Dunamore, she 
faltered in her determination, and pride 
and female delicacy almost came to her 
md in vain. To end the struggle, she at 



157 

last took a solemn vow to let no earthly 
consideration â€” no persuasions â€” no assu- 
rances of unaltered regard, induce her, 
either now or ever, to become the wife of 
lord Dunamore. Of course, there could 
now be no further hesitation, and she ac- 
cordingly sat down to compose a letter to 
him. In this she besought him not 
to impute to pique or resentment, at 
what had recently occurred, the resolution 
she avowed, but entirely to a conviction 
that their happiness could not be promoted 
by an union. She felt, she said, that she 
was by no means qualified for the exalted 
rank to which he would generously have 
elevated her, and to which neither her 
humble birth nor attainments gave her any 
just pretensions; but whilst she decidedly 
declined his further addresses, expressed 
her hope of ever retaining his friendship ; 
and concluded, by entreating him not to 
be the means of occasioning her any use- 
less disquietude, by attempting to make 
her change a resolution that was unalter- 
able. 



158 

This letter she sought an immediate op- 
portunity of putting into his hand. His 
surprise, or rather the shock he expe- 
rienced on its perusal, was indescribable. 
He had tried to flatter himself that what 
had occun-ed might be passed over; but 
to find he was mistaken â€” that it had pro- 
voked such an entire renunciation of him, 
overwhelmed him with shame, confusion, 
and remorse. 

He now, in his turn, sought Anna ; but 
he soon found that she was sincere, when 
she had said that her determination was 
not to be shaken. Finding she was not 
to be moved by his entreaties or argu- 
ments, he had recourse to her parents; 
but she was beforehand with him, and the 
explanation that had taken place w4th 
them effectually prevented any atten- 
tion to his solicitations. Having obtained 
an assurance that there would be neither 
resentment nor expostulation, she pro- 
ceeded to confide to them what she thought 
and felt, and so thoroughly succeeded by 
her explanation, in convincing them of 



159 

the propriety of her decision, that how- 
ever grieved or disappointed they were by 
it, they knew not how to condemn her 
for it ; although, when Mr. Woodburne 
reflected on the disclosure that terror and 
sui-prise had extorted from RosaUnd, and 
what reason there was, in consequence, to 
apprehend she might not prove worthy of 
the sacrifice â€” the sacrifice he feared his 
daughter had made for her, he could scarce 
refmin from an expression of censure. 

Since the affair had thus terminated, 
they rejoiced to think of the little publi- 
city it had obtained. Fortunately for 
them, lady Dundrum, who was not more 
anxious to hear than to disclose, had been 
confined, almost from the time of hearing 
it, to their own immediate party; and 
Mr. Woodburne now took upon himself, 
laughingly, to persuade her they had been 
practising on her credulity when they had 
mentioned it to her. 

Nothing could be more distressing than 
the awkward predicament in which lord 
Dunamore now felt himself; but he was 



160 

soon in a degree relieved from this by 
Mr. Woodburne's declaring, that if they 
wished them to prolong their visit, which 
he was solicitous to do, in order to prove 
that what had happened had in nowise 
altered his sentiments of esteem and re- 
gard for him, he would deport himself as 
usual; but he shrunk back, as if with a 
feeling of dread, from the renewal of any 
particularity with Rosalind ; and it would 
have seemed as if, by a strange perverse- 
ness, now that he was at full liberty to 
woo her regard, he no longer felt a wish. 
The delicacy that occasioned this con- 
duct was however soon seen through, 
and Anna undertook bringing every thing 
about as she wished. Having exerted her- 
self to make him believe that her mind 
was in a perfect state of tranquillity, and 
that it was her wish for both of them to 
foi'get they had ever been more than 
friends to each other, she gradually led to 
the mention of Rosalind ; and having at 
length awakened his fears, by hinting the 
general admiration she excited, and the 



161 

little probability there was of her friends 
not shortly becoming importunate with 
her to make a choice, drew him to confess, 
that since there was no chance of her al- 
tering her determination, he should cer- 
tainly prefer, from the jarring interests 
the union would be a means of reconciling, 
making an offer of his hand to Rosalind 
to any other person. 

This was all Anna wanted to effect the 
rest ; and through her contrivance, the lo- 
vers, ere well aware of what they were 
about, were betrayed into a mutual ex- 
planation. 

This was no sooner brought about than 
Mr. AVoodburne took upon himself the 
task of explaining to colonel Glenmorlie 
all those particulars relative to lord Dun- 
amore, of which he was yet ignorant; 
the interest with which he had early been 
inspired for him â€” the risks he had incur- 
red to evince it, and the ardent solicitude 
he had long felt for the termination of all 
further jealousies or complaints between 
them, by a still nearer alliance. Colonel 



162 

Glenmorlie scarcely required to be convin- 
ced of the injustice he had done lord Dun- 
amore, to give his joyful consent to this 
proposed union â€” an union which would 
afford him the pleasure of thinking that 
his descendants, at least, would enjoy 
what he had been unjustly deprived of. 
He and Mrs. Glenmorlie had previously 
been meditating going themselves for Ro- 
salind â€” Mr. Woodburne's letter induced 
them to hasten their journey. Their in- 
tention was no sooner known at the ab- 
bey, than the party there, accompanied 
by lord Dunamore, proceeded to Mr. 
Woodburne's, to be in readiness to receive 
them, w^hence, after passing a few days, 
they repaired to the abbey with lord 
Dunamore, accompanied by the rest of 
their friends; and where it was decided 
the approaching marriage should be cele- 
brated. 



163 



CHAPTER VI. 



There was no longer any contention be- 
tween love and ambition in the breast of 
Rosalind. In the wildest, the most ex- 
travagant dream of her imagination, she 
had never pictured to herself happiness 
beyond the present; but hardly did she 
feel assured of it, ere a thousand agitating 
fears and corroding reflections started up, 
and suggested themselves, to disturb and 
embitter her enjoyment of it. The feli- 
city she had now to lose made her more 
than ever dread any discovery relative to 
Kenmore; while the conviction, that to 
his utter ignorance on the subject, she 
was indebted for the triumph now afforded 
her by lord Dunamore, prevented her from 
almost feeling any exultation at it. There 
was besides a painful, a humiliating, an 



164 

abashing consciousness of insidiousness in 
her conduct towards Anna, that made her 
fancy, in every look, in every glance, at 
least, of Mr. Woodburne, she saw scorn, 
and contempt, and reproach ; and almost 
she wished, from what she was enduring, 
that she had not met lord Dunamore again. 

The constraint she was obliged to put 
upon herself rendered her feelings still 
more painful; for at such a crisis, what 
construction might not be put on any in- 
dication of gloom or abstraction in her 
manner? and while she sought to fly from 
her thoughts, she, at the same time, often 
felt it a relief to be by herself 

The gentlemen often rode out on a 
morning, or made parties to shoot on the 
mountains; and on these occasions she 
frequently stole away, to give vent to the 
feelings that oppressed her, within the 
deep recesses of the woods about the ab- 
bey, and where the deep gloom and lone- 
liness of all around seemed often to have 
a tranquillizing effect upon her perturbed 



165 

mind. Would she ever, in reality, be the 
mistress of these enchanting shades? a 
thousand times she asked herself; and as 
often an ill-divining spirit, such as she had 
once alluded to in meeting with lord Dun- 
amore, seemed to reply in the negative ; 
but this was idle â€” this was ridiculous ; she 
would not be a screech-owl to herself â€” a 
prophet of evil ; and then she would fly 
from the solitude she had just before per- 
haps eagerly sought, and rush into some 
sudden scheme of pleasure, with a cheek 
flushed with the hectic of agitation, and 
eyes sparkling from the excitement of the 
moment. 

It was at this period that the supposed 
disastrous fate of Kenm^ore became an- 
nounced to the public. Rosalind's first 
sensation on hearing it was relief â€” the next 
horror at herself, for having been capable 
of experiencing one of the kind at the 
death of any one, more especially a person 
who had given himself such claims, from 
his disinterested attachment, on her last- 



166 

ing gratitude and esteem. She fancied 
every eye was fixed on her at the mo- 
ment, as if penetrating what was passing 
in her heart; and forgetting the caution 
she had hitherto regarded, she suddenly 
rose, and fled the apartment. 

How indeed could she remain, and re- 
tain any appearance of composure, while 
she heard lord Dunamore speaking in such 
terms of regret and commiseration about 
Kenmore, with whose disastrous story he 
had, like the rest of the public, become 
acquainted, as convinced her, if he but 
suspected how much she had been the 
means of increasing his sufferings â€” per- 
haps of involving him in the catastrophe 
that had taken place, love and tenderness 
would quickly yield to abhorrence ! But 
her mother, on missing her from the apart- 
ment, for neither she nor her father hap- 
pened to be present at the instant, might,, 
under an apprehension of her being ill, 
come to seek her in her chamber ; or An- 
na might be officiously sent after her by 



167 

Mr. Woodburne ; and yielding to her fear 
of this, she hastily deserted it, and fled to 
her usual refuge in the woods. 

Ever and anon she paused, as she pro- 
ceeded, to listen whether there was any 
one following; but she heard no sound 
indicative of pursuit, and continued to ad- 
vance till she reached one of the lonehest 
spots in the place; here, panting, trem- 
bling, agitated almost to exhaustion, she 
threw herself on the grass, and, burying 
her face in her hands, gave way to the 
violent emotions of the moment. Oh, 
could she exclude reflection, as she could 
the light of day from her eyes ! But, no ! 
no ! she sighed aloud, that could never be ; 
never, never could the recollection of de- 
ception and ingratitude be lost; for ever 
must it haunt her, to poison â€” to embitter 
But, gracious Heaven ! had she be- 
trayed herself? for, at the instant, she 
heard a rustling in the bushes, and, in 
wild dismay, she started from the ground ; 
but great as was the terror inspired by 
this idea, it was faint, compared to what 



168 

she felt, when, within a few paces of her, 
she beheld the form of him who, but a 
few minutes before, she had been led to 
believe buried amidst the wdld waves of 
the deep ! Could she credit her eyes, or 
w^as it a vision, conjured up by her dis- 
turbed imagination? or had he really been 
spared, to cross her path with reproach â€” 
to avenge liimself by the blight, the de- 
struction of her happiness? 

But w hile her eye continued to glare 
on him, she involuntarily attempted to 
draw back. Not to let her fly him, how- 
ever, had Kenmore haunted her steps ; in 
secrecy and disguise, pursuant to his in- 
tention of ascertaining her sentiments ere 
he came to a decided determination rela- 
tive to himself, he had come ; and he re- 
solved not to lose the opportunity he had 
at length obtained for the purpose. 

In tracing her to Covetown, he had heard 
of her intended marriage with lord Duna- 
more, and the intimation made him hesi- 
tate for a little while; but he was ac- 
quainted with the history of her family. 



169 

and from this he did not conceive it alto- 
gether improbable that the persuasions of 
her friends, as much as any other circum- 
stance, might have been the means of 
bringing this about, and accordingly de- 
cided on persevering in his original inten- 
tion. At first he meditated addressing 
her by letter; but when, through the se- 
cret inquiries he contrived to make in the 
vicinity of the abbey, he understood she 
was in the habit of often straying about 
through the grounds by herself, he rather 
preferred watching for her, from the 
chance there was of a letter not imme- 
diately being delivered, or else the risk 
there was of its being at a moment when 
perhaps its contents could not be concealed 
from others ; but from the extent of the 
grounds, and the chance manner in which 
she rambled about, several days elapsed 
ere they met. 

He saw her at a distance, and, gradually 
approaching the spot where she was, had 
full leisure, ere he was noticed, to observe 

VOL. II. I 



170 

the state of agitation she was in. Her 
heavy sighs â€” the impatient clasping 
of her hands â€” the tears he perceived 
streaming down her cheeks, all proclaimed 
her miserable, at the moment at least. 
The inference was natural, that her mar- 
riage with lord Dunamore was a forced 
one ; and, amiable and attractive, and eve- 
ry way deserving, as he understood his 
lordship to be of her affections, it follow- 
ed that her averseness to it must certainly 
proceed from an attachment to another. 

Emboldened by the conclusion, he rush- 
ed forward, and prevented her retreat, 
tempted from what he saw â€” from what 
he inferred, to believe that he had indeed 
wronged her, when he derided her asser- 
tion of having resigned him through the 
commands of her father; and that but for 
the indignation he had inspired by doing 
so, he would, long ere this, have ascer- 
tained the truth. But it was not too late 
to acknowledge his error ; if she regarded 
hill), his submission for it would be ac- 



171 

cepted â€” his arguments, his solicitations, 
attended to, and happiness again be his. 

Forced to remain â€” forced to listen to 
him, Rosalind tried to coUect herself. The 
impetuosity of his feelings did not permit 
him to be either tedious in the tale he had 
to tell, or in revealing the hopes and 
wishes that had led him to seek this meet- 
ing ; and again Rosalind saw how he had 
suffered a sanguine imagination to deceive 
him. 

She hesitated how to act â€” she wished 
to be candid; but when she reflected on 
the scene that had occurred in their last 
interview, she trembled to think of again 
probably provoking his indignation, from 
the consequences she apprehended from it. 
To attempt now to undeceive him, and 
must she not betray the deception that, 
from the first, she had practised on him ? 
and could she hope â€” could she flatter her- 
self, after what she had already witnessed, 
that he would calmly endure the discovery 
of the wrong she had done him? 
J 2 



172 

Yet would it not be cruel to temporize 
with him? Did not principle, honour, 
feeling, all alike demand that she should 
be candid with him ? But then, to run 
the risk of her happiness â€” to have him 
burst perhaps into the very presence of 
lord Dunamore with reproaches! No â€” 
she could not incur such a one; and yet to 
practise further duplicity â€” to persevere in 
what was so repugnant to her nature â€” she 
wrung her hands in agony, and found, too 
late^ that, once involved in the labyrinthian 
path of dissimulation, there is no extrica- 
tion for the foot. 

But she must come to a decision ; a 
much longer delay, and she would doubt- 
less be sought, and then how unavailing 
perhaps any further consideration ! In 
short, she suffered him to believe all he 
wished ; that she had always been attached 
to him ; that her hesitating to fulfil her 
engagement to him had been entirely ow- 
ing to the harsh commands of her father; 
and that her acquiescing in his wishes for 
a union between her and lord Dunamore 



173 

had been entirely owing to her belief in 
his death. â€” " But now that I know the 
falsity of that, you may rest assured," she 
forced herself to add, " the engagement it 
led me to form will never be ratified. I 
will not, however, be urged into a clan- 
destine one with you, at least till I have 
tried what a candid statement of facts may 
effect with my father. But for this I must 
be allowed some little time ; and during 
the interval of suspense, should think it 
advisable," she artfully insinuated, " your 
quitting this, lest of any premature disco- 
very." 

Grateful, enraptured, exulting, the im- 
passioned Ken more was ready to acquiesce 
in any thing she wished or desired ; but 
ere he could bring himself to depart, he 
implored another interview, that he might 
be assured he was not deceiving himself â€” 
not under the influence of an intoxicating 
dream. 

This, most reluctantly, Rosalind grant- 
ed. Fear, however, induced her to do so, 
and they parted, her mind somewhat re- 



174 

lieved from its previous terror, by the 
hope she entertained of being able to get 
him out of the way till after the celebra- 
tion of her marriage, when the uselessness 
of reproaches would, she trusted, prevent 
any from him ; and when, at all events, 
he would not have the power of doing her 
the mischief he now had. 

Yet she abhorred herself for her trea- 
chery to him, and almost felt, as even in 
her bosom a doubt of the superintendence 
of Providence would rise, if happiness were 
the result of conduct like hers; but she 
strove to fly from the appalling thought ; 
this was the last lapse she should have to 
accuse herself of, and then all would be 
correct, and the past retrieved by the fu- 
ture. 

Had a doubt of her sincerity been har- 
boured in the mind of Kenmore, her man- 
ner in this second interview would have 
succeeded in dispelling it. He departed, 
but had not been two days gone, when, 
contrary to his promise of not returning 
till he heard from her, he decided on re- 



175 

tracing his way to Covetovvn. He had 
nothing to do elsewhere, and felt miser- 
able at a distance from her; but he did 
not intend she should be acquainted with 
his disobedience to her commands, or, of 
course, to relax in the precautions he had 
previously taken for concealment; keeping 
within during the day, he did not venture 
out till at an hour when he conceived there 
was little danger of encountering any one 
whose recognition he feared ; it was then 
a delicious indulgence to him to repair to 
the abbey, and wander through its roman- 
tic grounds. 

In the meantime, the day fixed for the 
marriage of lord Dunamore and Rosalind 
was at hand. The nearer it approached, 
the more restless and unhappy the latter 
became i haunted by apprehension â€” cast 
down by a consciousness of unworthiness, 
she more than ever sought opportunities 
of being alone, as if hoping, by eluding 
observation, to regain composure. Her 
dejection and languor, notwithstanding 
her efforts to conceal them, were at length 



176 

too apparent not to excite the notice she 
dreaded. Her parents spoke to her on 
the subject ; but her answers satisfied them, 
inducing them to believe that what had 
alarmed them was merely the effect of 
nerves long painfully pressed on. But the 
anxiety of lord Dunamore was not so 
quickly relieved ; the positive rejection 
his first overtures to her had met with 
now recurred to his thoughts, and finally 
decided him on coming to an explanation 
with her, if he did not see a speedy alter- 
ation in her looks and manner; but in 
vain he watched for this ; and on catching 
a glimpse of her, one evening, from a win- 
dow, as he was repairing from the eating- 
room to rejoin the party in the drawing- 
room, hurrying from the house, towards 
a gloomy part of the grounds, he deter- 
mined on there seeking her for the purpose. 
Unaware of being followed, or that the 
party in the dining-parlour would have 
broken up so soon, Rosalind proceeded till 
she came to a grotto, at some distance 
from the mansion. Turning into it, she 



177 

threw herself on the moss-covered seat, and, 
â– with looks uplifted to heaven, was on the 
point of exclaiming on her wretchedness, 
when the voice of lord Dunamore, as he 
advanced within the porch, arrested her 
utterance. Good God ! she started in dis- 
may from her seat, as if she had betrayed 
herself A minute, however, served to dis- 
sipate this fear, and in a degree to reassure 
her; but when lord Dunamore, after a 
few desultory remarks, merely to give 
her time to recover from the agitation he 
saw his unexpected appearance had given 
her, began gradually to lead to the subject 
he was intent on speaking on, how violent 
became her emotion ! Had the imperfect 
light permitted a full view of her varying 
countenance, she would have felt it im- 
possible to support herself. But her situa- 
tion was a desperate one ; she must collect 
herself or be lost â€” distrust, she saw, had 
found admission into the heart of lord 
Dunamore, and, impelled by this convic- 
tion, she was presently enabled to make 
i3 



178 

efiertions for the purpose of dispelling his 
uneasiness. 

Actuated by real tenderness, there was 
no protestation that love could desire that 
she was not ready to make â€” that she did 
not make, to assure him of her regard. â€” 
** No !" she passionately and involuntarily 
exclaimed ; " whatever I may have to re- 
proach myself with, I certainly cannot 
have to reproach myself with e\^er having 
feigned for you other sentiments than I 
really felt. I did hope that a surmise so 
injurious could never be entertained ; but 
since it seems it has, it is but justice to us 
both to call Heaven to witness, that, as a 
lover, you are the only being for whom I 
ever entertained a preferable regard, or, 
without reluctance, could have thought 
of giving my hand to." 

" Enough, enough !'* cried lord Duna- 
more, fondly clasping her to his bosom. 
** You have indeed restored me to perfect 
happiness ; and for having yielded, for a 
moment, to the doubt that interrupted it. 



179 

you must forgive me, in consideration of 
the circumstances that occasioned it." 

Immediately behind them, on a pedes- 
tal of rock-work, was an antique vase, 
partially concealing an inlet to another di- 
vision of the grotto, leading out to the 
rocks amidst which it was constructed. 
At this instant, just as lord Dunamore 
was on the point of adding something 
more in deprecation of the resentment he 
might have inspired, it fell with a crash 
so tremendous, as if overturned by some 
sudden violence, as to startle not only his 
companion but him also. â€” " How did this 
happen !" he exclaimed. " There was no 
movement â€” no winds, to occasion the ac- 
cident; surely it is not owing to there 
having been some other person in the 
place besides ourselves." 

" Oh, no, I am sure not !" cried Rosa- 
lind, the idea of Kenmore occurring at 
the moment, and, in consequence, makingv 
an effort to stop him from trying; but he 
would not be prevented. In a minute al- 
most, however, he returned to her, say- 



180 

ing, he could not discover that there had ; 
and they presently after quitted the place, 
Rosalind pretty well recovered from the 
panic that had seized her at the idea that 
had occurred, from persuading herself that 
Kenmore would not break his promise 
about returning. 

That it was he, however, who had oc- 
casioned their recent alarm, need scarcely, 
we fancy, be explained. On hearing ap- 
proaching footsteps, he had taken shelter 
in the grotto, and was retreating from it^ 
through the other outlet, when the conver- 
sation that had commenced occasioned him 
to pause; and involuntarily listening, he 
gradually discovered the cruel deception 
that had been practised on him. The mo- 
tives for it were obvious ; and in the first 
transports of his indignation, he was 
tempted to rush forward with reproaches 
for her perfidy; but no â€” he would not 
expose to the world that he had suffered 
himself to be made so great a dupe of. In 
retreating, the agitation he was in occa- 
sioned the accident of the vase. But scarce 



181 

had he retreated, ere he ahuost regretted 
not having obeyed the first dictates of his 
resentment; but, nevertheless, though he 
had not yielded to them, he would not 
suffer himself to remain totally unreven- 
ged ; he would see her once more ; yes, at 
the altar, while she was in the very act of 
pledging her vows to another, he would 
face her, and, by one withering look of 
scorn, give her to understand his full de- 
tection of her baseness ; and then, bidding 
a last adieu to Europe, join the patriots 
of South America, and with them either 
seek an early grave, or create for himself 
some new interest in life. 

Such was his scheme ; and to obtain the 
gratification it promised, he constrained 
himself to remain a little longer in a place 
that was now become hateful to him, and 
where hisfeelings were continually wrought 
upon by the preparations that were going 
forward for the approaching nuptials. At 
length the day fixed for their celebration 
arrived ; on the one preceding it, Rosa- 
lind employed herself in composing a let- 



182 

ter to him, to be dispatched to him imme- 
diately after her marriage; in which he 
was entreated to believe that this was 
owing entirely to the arbitrary authority 
of her father, and not by any means to 
her own inclination ; that for his sake she 
would wilhngly have resigned the rank, 
and wealth, and splendour, to which it 
elevated her; but finding this was impos- 
sible to do without incurring the absolute 
malediction of her father, she trusted, in 
consideration of this, he would generously 
forbear all reproaches, and, for the sake of 
both, let there be an end of all further in- 
tercourse between them. 

At some little distance from the abbey 
was an inlet of the sea, known by the 
name of the Back Strand, and divided 
from the sea by low rocks, or rather accu- 
mulations of loose stones and gravel, cast 
up by the waves, intermingled with sand 
hills, looking, in the sunshine, like so 
many piles of clear glittering silver. When 
the tide was out, it was fordable, but only 
with safety to those acquainted with the 



183 

rapidity with which it flowed in upon it 
on its return, and the pits and quagmires 
with which it abounded. 

On the edge of this was a lonely and 
partially-decayed chapel, but still enriched 
with some ancient monuments of the Glen- 
morlie family, and containing their burial- 
place ; and here it was decided the mar- 
riage of Rosalind should take place. 

A gay and splendid cavalcade assembled 
at an early hour to attend her to it; but 
in vain she strove to participate in the 
feeling of general joy and pleasure around 
her. There was a weight upon her heart 
she could not shake ofi ; but she tried to 
believe it was owing to any other cause 
than the real one â€” a dread, a misgiving, 
she could not divest herself of ; for had she 
not managed matters so as to leave herself 
little cause for fear ? Yes, it must be ow- 
ing to the violent agitation her nerves had 
lately undergone, or it might be occasion- 
ed, in a degree, by the cheerless aspect of 
the day, that, ere the dawn, had nigh ren- 
dered the adjacent headlands and contigu- 



184 

oiis scenery visible, but again veiled them 
in a heavy mist of drizzling rain. 

The ceremony commenced, and she 
strove to be collected ; but when it reach- 
ed that part where the couple about being 
married are so solemnly required and ad- 
jured, as they will answer at the dreadful 
day of judgment, when the secrets of all 
hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of 
them know of any cause why they may 
not be joined together, they shall then re- 
veal it, how impossible to describe her 
sickening sensations, convinced, as she was, 
that if the secrets of her heart were dis- 
closed at the moment, lord Dunamore 
would shrink with abhorrence from all 
further idea of an union with her. Con- 
scious of her confusion, she involuntarily 
averted her looks ; and at this instant they 
encountered the fixed and stern ones of 
Kenmore, as pale and apparently rigid as 
the monumental effigy that, near the side 
of the altar, concealed him from general 
observation. 

She had just power to suppress the ex- 



185 

chmation that must have betrayed her, 
but no further to command her feelings; 
she distinguished nothing more, neither 
knew what was said, or she repeated, till 
recalled to something like consciousness by 
the crowding of her friends about her, and 
their warm gratulations on the conclusion 
of the ceremony. 

She dreaded to encounter the looks of 
Kenmore again â€” those looks so declara- 
tory of the discovery of her treachery ; 
yet, in spite of this feeling, she could not 
help glancing back as she moved from the 
altar ; but he had disappeared. 

Well, he was satisfied perhaps with the 
cruel shock he had given her feelings, and 
would spare them another; she wished 
she could be assured of this ere she entire- 
ly departed, for there was terror to her in 
the pallidness of his brow â€” the smile that 
curved his lip. Oh ! should he meditate 
any thing dreadful ! in this way, should he 
seek to be revenged on her, what would 
become of her ! She shuddered â€” she hesi- 
tated ; yet how could she impart her fears 



without betraying all she wished to con- 
ceal? 

The carriaoje that was to receive her 
drew up; she lingered â€” but her conduct 
was calculated to excite wonder ; and she 
was on the point of setting her foot on the 
step, when, at that instant, her eyes again 
encountered Kenmore, evidently on the 
point of crossing the Back Strand. The 
tide was coming in, so that in a few mi- 
nutes it would be overflowed ; and con- 
cluding him aware of this, Rosalind's im- 
mediate conjecture was, that his intention 
in crossing it was to shock her by the 
sight of his destruction, whereas it was, in 
reality^ being ignorant of the danger of 
the attempt, to avoid the bridal cavalcade 
that filled up the way to Covetown. 

All further command over herself was 
at an end ; she shrieked aloud, in the wild 
agony and terror of her soul, and called 
out to have him saved. The object of ge- 
neral attention herself, till then he had 
not been noticed ; but now every eye was 
simultaneously turned on him, and several 



187 

of the party, in obedience to her outcries, 
rushed to the spot. 

Enraged, exasperated, yet without 
knowing what was meant, from not dis- 
tinguishing her exclamations, Ken more 
plunged forward. The tide was rushing 
in â€” agitation rendered him heedless, and 
ere the lapse of another minute, he was 
lost to the view in one of those frightful 
chasms already mentioned. 

The horror occasioned by such a catas- 
trophe may easily be conceived ; but how 
faint was what others felt compared to 
what Rosalind felt, with her conscience 
accusing her of being the cause of it ! 

She was conveyed from the spot in a 
lifeless state, and only revived to utter the 
wild ravings of a distracted and agonized 
spirit. These ravings, in a great degree, 
betrayed the fatal truth, and what they 
did not disclose was fully revealed by the 
letter addressed to the unfortunate Ken- 
more, w^hich had been left by her on her 
toilet, for the purpose of being dispatched 
to him immediately on her return from 



188 

church, and was there accidentally disco- 
vered by lord Dunamore, as he disconso- 
lately turned from the couch on which she 
was laid to try and collect herself. 

The shock of that moment baffles de- 
scription ; to have his fears, his doubts, his 
misgivings, thus confirmed, was indeed 
more than he could immediately endure 
with any degree of calmness. Confidence, 
once destroyed, could never, he was aware, 
be restored ; and how without mutual 
confidence was there to be any chance of 
happiness, in the near and intimate con- 
nexion he had formed with the unfortu- 
nate being before him ? But he almost felt 
as if he merited what he suffered â€” merited 
it, for having suffered himself to be tempt- 
ed to act contrary to the dictates of real 
honour and feeling â€” for having suffered 
the fascination of his eye to be the means 
of alluring him from her whose probity 
and ingenuousness he never had reason to 
doubt. 

But neither resentment nor indignation 
could overpower humanity ; and the shock 



189 

of this discovery a little got over, no exer- 
tion was wanting that could benefit the 
sufferer, or soothe the feelings of others into 
equal forgiveness and pity for her. With 
the mother he soon succeeded, but her fa- 
ther could only think of her with indig- 
nation ; for a long time she remained in- 
sensible to all this ; but at length her rea- 
son was restored, but only, as it seemed, 
mercifully to permit her to prepare herself 
for the hour that was rapidly approaching. 
But a short time before, and with what 
horror would she have contemplated be- 
coming so soon the inmate of the gloomy 
tomb ! But now she welcomed the thought, 
as one that promised to relieve her from 
shame, and scorn, and reproach. Widely 
as she had deviated from integrity â€” inso- 
lently, arrogantly as she had conducted 
herself â€” confidently as she had relied on 
the omnipotence of her beauty, she had 
not feelings to enable her to bear up 
against, or brave the contumely she had 
incurred. No ; the silent grave was now 
the only place for her â€” her death the only 



190 

means she beheld of evincing the sincerity 
of her penitence, and awakening that ten- 
derness in the bosoms of those she loved, 
that should prevent her being thought of 
with detestation. Her father held out to 
the last ; but when assured hope was over â€” 
that a few short hours, and the final scene 
must close, the stubborn feelings of resent- 
ment gave way to those of nature, and he 
hastened to mingle his tears with those of 
the other mourners around her, and im- 
part to her expiring spirit the consolation 
of his forgiveness. 

Thus, the victim of her own perfidy, in 
the possession of all that could render life 
desirable, died the unhappy Rosalind â€” a 
proof, if indeed daily experience renders 
one requisite, that the winding ways of 
dissimulation can never end in aught but 
evil ; that the moment in which we seem 
to withdraw ourselves from the superin- 
tending care of Providence, by presump- 
tuously relying alone on our own contri- 
vances, to bring about the accomplish- 
ment of our wishes, tliat moment we lay 



191 

up for ourselves certain remorse, and mi- 
sery, and disappointment. 

The body of Kenmore was recovered, 
and interred near where he had perished; 
and in a little w4iile after, the remains of 
her who had paid so dearly for her injuries 
to him were deposited near the spot. 

" By the brook of the hill their graves 
are laid ; a birch's unequal shade covers 
their tomb. Often on their green earthen 
tombs the branchy sons of the mountain 
feed, when midday is all in flames, and si- 
lence on the hills." 

What changes â€” what alterations, do a 
few years occasion in the world! what 
numbers do they see swept off from exist- 
ence ! what numbers springing into it, to 
begin the race that others have so recently 
ended! what friends â€” what intimates do 
we miss after any long sojourn from a 
place! what unknown faces do we en- 
counter, where we expected to have been 
greeted by the social smile of warm friend- 
ship and affection ! It has been, perhaps 
feelingly, said, that we should never return 



192 

to any place from which we have been 
long absent ; yet how impossible to resist 
the impulse that leads us back to the 
scenes of our eai;!^ recollections, where, 
perhaps, all we t-W* tasted of real happi- 
ness was alone enjoyed, and where what is 
recalled to mind, though it may occasion 
regret, awakens no remorse ! 

Such were the reflections of Anna, as, 
after a long â€” long absence from her native 
country, she revisited Dunamore Abbey, 
the wife of sir William Le Fleming, whose 
disinterested and persevering attachment 
at length met with that return it merited 
from her. She was cautioned of the me- 
lancholy her visit to the abbey would pro- 
bably excite, but she could not resist the 
wish that urged her to pay it, so interest- 
ing to our feelings is the place where the 
varied influence of joy and sorrow has been 
experienced by us, and we have enjoyed 
the converse of those whom we shall no 
more see; besides, her daughters had 
heard of Rosalind, and she wished to ren- 
der still more impressive what they had 



193 

heard, by pointing out the actual scene of 
her affliction ; for there was a moral she 
conceived connected with her story, that 
rendered her desirous of having it iii'^press- 
ed on their minds. * â€¢' 

We complain of the sorrows to which 
we are doomed, when, let us calmly review 
and reflect, and we shall probably And, 
that but for ourselves, we should have but 
little cause for complaint. 

The fate of Kosalind was mentioned as 
a proof of the uncertainty of human hap- 
piness; but who had occasioned tliat fate 
but herseh ? 

So vivid was lady Le Fleming's recol- 
lection of all that had occurred at the ab- 
bey, that it seemed to her as if it had been 
but the preceding day that she had wit- 
nessed the marriage-procession arranging, 
heard the vows that were so soon to be 
dissolved, and seen the dying struggles 
of the lamented Kenmore; yet what a 
time had elapsed since theni what ties 
been dissolved, and new ones formed!

were no more; and the colonel, now sole 
Iieir to the long-divided possessions of his 
family, was again married, and consoled 
for those he had lost by new claimants 
on his affection. 

Lord Dun am ore, immediately after the 
death of Rosalind, had joined his regi- 
ment, contrary to his intention previous 
to his marriage, of quitting the army, and 
in an encracrement with it on the Conti- 
nent, had fallen; and Mrs. Glenmorlie 
survived her daughter but a short time. 
And of those, whose every look and ges- 
tare were still so fresh in her recollection 
â€¢ â€” whom she almost fancied she still sav/ 
and heard â€” whom so recently, as it seem- 
ed to her, she had actually seen in all the 
majesty of stately beauty, did a heap of 
dust now alone remain? was the passionate 
demand of lady Le Fleming, as, with a 
gush of tributary sorrow, she wandered 
through the now-deserted apartments of 
the abbey, the remembrances it excited 
having induced the colonel to abandon it 
entirely; she could not look â€” she could 



195 

not move, where some affecting recollec- 
tion was not recalled ; and with truth she 
might have said, that the very sound of 
tlie waves, the murmur of the woods, 
brought back tlie memory of the past. 

Sir William and her parents would have 
hurried her away; but she could not be 
induced to depart till she had revisited 
every well-remembered spot, explored 
every w^ ell-remembered chamber; and 
still, as she proceeded, she could almost 
have fancied she heard the bounding steps 
of Rosalind along the long-receding gal- 
leries, and seen her playfully flitting from 
room to room, as she was wont ; and still, 
as she thought of her, she rejoiced, that, 
short-lived as was the happiness she was 
destined to enjoy, still she had not been 
a means of depriving her of it. 

AVhen our friends are gone, and repara- 
tion out of our power, we doubly feel any 
selfishness or unkindness we have been 
guilty of towards them.

jL am sorry, my dear girl," said M\\ 
Elmore, " that the loss I have lately sus- 
tained compels me to break up house- 
keeping, and accept the offer I have re- 
ceived, to go to America for a year or 
two on business for a friend. As far as 
you are yourself concerned, however, this 
need give you no uneasiness, as you will 
still be secure of an eligible residence; my 



200 

kinswoman, Mrs. Perkins, having kindly 
invited you to remain with her; and 
tiiough a person in business, you will be 
respectably and comfortably situated with 
her." 

" Respectably situated in the house of 
a trades-person !" and the pure and elo- 
quent blood of Emily boiHng in her veins 
at the idea of such a residence being pro- 
posed for her, v>'ro light, we wont say 
so divinely at the moment, that had the 
eyes of Mr. Elmore been on her, it w^ould 
not have been a difficult matter to have 
seen what she really thought at the sug- 
gestion. Indignation, however, could not 
entirely overcome gratitude and respect; 
slightly bending her fine neck â€” " I thank 
you, sir," she said, " for your solicitude 
for me ; but there is no occasion to tax the 
kindness of your connexions on my ac- 
count, when I have some of my own to 
serve me. Mr. O'Brady will, I dare say, 
be happy at this opportunity of evincing 
his regard." 

" 1 dare say he will, my dear," returned 



201 

Mr. Elmore ; " so settle the matter as you 
please ; to know you are where you will 
be safe and happy, is all I require." 

The parents of Emily were of ancient 
Irish families; but a kind of feudal ani- 
mosity subsisting between them, the mar- 
riage of the young couple was against 
their consent, and they were, in conse- 
quence, thrown off by them. St. Orme, 
however, who was in the army, was not 
destined long to suffer under the unkind- 
ness of fortune ; he was killed in the Pen- 
insula war, leaving his wife with but 
little more than the pension of a captain's 
widow for her support and her child's. 

This melancholy event, however, fail- 
ing to produce any effect on those they 
had offended, in the disdain and resent- 
ment of her heart at their conduct, she 
decided on remaining in Penzance, in 
Cornwall, where her husband had left her 
when embarking with his regiment for the 
Continent. Here Mr. Elmore, then but 
a short time returned from the East In- 
k3 



2021 

dies, where he had realized a moderate 
fortune, had also taken up his abode; and 
here, by chance, they got acquainted; the 
acquaintance gradually led to an attach- 
ment, and the attachment to an offer, 
which neither prudence nor inclination al- 
lowed of being rejected. 

They had no children ; but the affec- 
tion which Mr. Elmore early conceived 
for his little stepdaughter scarcely per- 
mitted him to regret the circumstance; 
and by every one it was concluded she 
would be his heiress. She was about 
eighteen when she lost her mother. The 
dissolution of the tie that had connected 
them, however, occasioned not the slight- 
est alteration in his conduct towards her; 
and through his unremitting kindness, she 
was just beginning to recover from her 
affliction, when the unfortunate event 
took place that compelled them to separate. 

Mr. Elmiore, as a sleeping partner, had 
embarked the principal part of his fortune 
in a mercantile house in town. The house 
suddenly failed, and the loss of almost the 



203 

whole of his income consequently obliged 
him to break up his establishmeiit, and 
think of making some exertions for liim- 
self. 

The relation to wliom Emily alluded, 
on the scornful rejection of the kindness 
of his, was a cousin of her mother's. Slie 
liad no personal knowledge of him ; but to 
know he was of her family was quite suf- 
ficient to prevent any doubt of his re- 
spectabihty ; wliile the friendly correspon- 
dence he had kept up with her mother, 
convinced her of his being of an affec- 
tionate disposition. 

But notwithstanding the high blood that 
Ho wed in his veins, he was literally but a 
soldier of fortune. After many hard buf- 
fetings with the world, liowever,. his un- 
expected conquest of the soft heart of an 
yielding fair one, who, on the death of 
her parents, had come up from the coun- 
try, to exhibit her charms to the gaze of 
admiration in London, where, on being 
put on half-pay, he had continued loiter- 
ing, in hopes of something lucky turning 



204 

lip, promised to reward him for all former 
privations. 

Unlike many in the world, his senti- 
ments remained unaltered by circum- 
stances; where he had professed a regard, 
he still coiitinued to profess it^ as a proof,, 
his friendly correspondence with the El- 
mores was still kept up, and repeated in- 
vitations given them to SuiTey, where he 
settled. 

Various circumstances prevented the ac- 
ceptance of these; but now that Emily 
found herself under the distressing neces- 
sity of being compelled to put herself un* 
der an obligation, she decided on letting 
him know she was now ready to pay him 
a visit, if he was as inclined as ever to re- 
ceive her. 

Her letter, to this effect, was answered 
by return of post, and answered exactly 
as she had expected ; Mr. O'Brady assured 
her it gave him and Mrs. O'Brady the 
sincerest pleasure to hear of her intention, 
and that it was the earnest wish of both 



1205 

her journey might not be unnecessarily 
delayed. 

We shall pass over the parthig scene 
between her and i\Ir. Elmore, whose own 
departure was only delayed till he had 
seen her safely off to her friends. If ever 
taking a last leave of a home to which we 
have been indifferent gives a pang to the 
bosom, and it surely does, what must be 
the anguish of the heart, in bidding a last 
farewell to one long endeared by happi- 
ness and affection I 

Such w^as the anguish that rived the 
heart of Emily, at the moment that was 
tearing her away from what might be call- 
ed her native bowers, and deluged hev 
face with tears, as i\Ir. Elmore, unable to 
utter the benediction he attempted to re- 
peat, silently handed her into the stage- 
coach, in which, for the sake of protec- 
tion, she was compelled to travel. We 
would not, for the world, offend her dig- 
nity, by having it supposed there was any 
other reason. 

In this said coach she was literally 



206 

launched into life; for till the period of 
entering it, she had never known what it 
was to be thrown on herself for protection 
or exertion of any kind. But the terror 
that might have assailed another mind at 
the thought was, in a great degree, check- 
ed in hers by the confidence she had in 
the advantages she possessed ; she was too 
wxll born and too attractive, she conceived, 
to allow any apprehension to be enter- 
tained of ever being either insulted or 
overlooked. Distinction and admiration 
were her due, and to the first, at least, she 
always determined to assert her claim. 

Her age has been already mentioned ; 
to the natural advantages of youth she 
united a great share of beauty ; she was 
really what is called a fine girl, tall, full- 
grown, with a clear complexion, expres- 
sive eyes, and fine dark luxuriant hair, 
wuth a great deal of natural gracefulness, 
improved into a very dignified, command- 
ing air by the pride of birth. 

This pride was what w^as likely to be 
her bane; arrogance, presumption, and 



207 

self-conceit, were the result of it ; and we 
need not say the thousand dangers which 
they provoke, both from the enmity they 
excite, and the temerity to which they 
lead. Her mother had neither neglected 
her understanding nor principles ; but un- 
fortunately she had allowed herself to im- 
bue her with all her own early prejudices, 
so that Emily grew up, not merely with 
a contempt, but absolute horror, of any 
one in business. This might have been of 
little consequence to the heiress of Mr. 
Elmore's thousands, from the expectations 
she would have had a right to form ; but 
for the possessor of but a few solitary hun- 
dreds, it seemed likely to prove a very 
unfortunate circumstance. 

Her mother, when too late, became 
sensible of the error she had committed, in 
laying such a stress upon birth, and sought 
to rectify it, by recommending meekness 
and humility; but the mischief was done 
â–  â€” the tares had grown up with the wheat, 
and attained a strength and stubbornness, 
ere she noticed them, that rendered a more 



208 

powerful hand than hers requisite to ex* 
tirpate them. 

The journey of Emily passed nearly in 
silence and abstraction; she had many 
matters to muse on ; and to notice persons 
travelling in such a vehicle as a pubhc 
coach, was out of the question. 

On the third morning she reached 
Hounslow, and, as directed by ]\Ir. El- 
more, quitted the stage here, and, taking 
a chaise, struck across the country, to the 
road she had to pursue to Mr. O'Brady's. 

The day was fine â€” the season delight- 
ful; the mild beauties of spring were just 
beginning to be enriched vÂ»dth the more 
glowing ones of summer; and in the agree- 
able contemplation of soon finding herself 
seated in a mansion of elegance and hos- 
pitality, Emily was restored to sufficient 
complacency and cheerfulness to be able 
to enjoy them. Every thing combined to 
render the short remainder of her journey 
pleasant; the road she was pursuing being 
considered one of the finest pieces of in- 
land road in the kingdom, presenting, in 



209 

a most pleasing and agreeable succession, 
to the eye of the admiring traveller, va- 
rious seats of the nobility and gentry, beau- 
tifully ornamented with woods, sheep- 
walks, parks, and gardens. But when, 
leaving Dorkin behind her, she found 
herself, after proceeding a few miles fur- 
ther, entering Copsely, the village where 
Mr. O'Brady resided, she began to feel a 
damp thrown on her pleasurable sensa- 
tions: lying in one of the wildest parts of 
the Holm ward, she saw nothing in it of 
that elegance, neatness, or comfort, she 
had expected to find in the place where 
he had fixed his residence. 

But though English travellers, of course, 
are acquainted with the Holmward, yet, 
as there may be some amongst those who 
have not yet crossed the Channel, that 
know nothing about it, we shall proceed 
to say, that it is a wild track, stretching 
to a considerable distance, between skirt- 
ing chains of hills, projecting far into the 
bordering counties â€” was, in former times, 
distinguished for many things, and still 



210 

retains, in many places, the same wild, 
savage countenance it may be presumed 
to have generally worn a thousand years 
ago. In the first place, tradition says, 
out-lying red deer were found here in the 
days of king James the Second, and pre- 
served by him for the chase ; in the next, 
that though now overgrown with furze, 
that it was once famous for producing such 
quantities of strawberries, that they w ere 
carried to market by horse-loads; and^ 
thirdly, that it was, in ancient times, one 
of the retreats, for many ages, of the na- 
tive Britons, against the Romans, and af- 
terwards of the Saxons against the Danes. 
Emily looked about her with dismay 
and apprehension ; no elegant mansions â€” 
no beautiful enclosures, met her view ; no- 
thing but a few mean cottages, and old 
farmhouses, wdth fields, that were nothing 
but patches cleared out from amongst the 
"woods, the oak being here reckoned the 
weed of the soil. She saw nothing grand 
but the altitude of Leith Hill, rising in 
cold, and bleak, and solemn majesty, with 



its lonely tower pre-eminently conspicu- 
ous above the chain of adjacent hills. Had 
she been a tourist, like the delightful Syn- 
tax, she might have been enchanted with 
what she saw; for here, in the rudely-con- 
structed cottages â€” the antique straggling 
farmhouses, furred with moss â€” the ancient 
church, half-clad in ivy, with its sombre 
screen of r.v^eval yews â€” the gaudily-painted 
inn, with its flaring sign flapping to and 
fro, there was all the roughness, and rude- 
ness, and broadness, requisite for the pic- 
turesque. But it was not for this that 
Emily was in search at the moment â€” she 
was looking for the light, the elegant, the 
tasteful, but looking, as it seemed, in 
vain ; but doubtless the residence of Mr. 
O'Brady would suddenly burst upon her, 
with all the elegance with which she had 
decked it in her imagination : yet it was 
odd she could not catch a glimpse of it, 
for he had expressly said it was in the vil- 
lage, close upon the road, and she could 
see from one end of this to the other, but 



212 

without seeing any thing that at all an- 
swered her idea of it. 

The chaise went on till it got to about 
the middle of the village, when it sud- 
denly stopped before a range of red brick 
cottages, fenced off from the road, and di- 
vided from each other by a low paling. 
The heart of Emily misgave her ; but, no â€” 
it could not be, recovering from her panic 
at the persuasion the man had mistaken 
the way, and had merely stopped here to 
inquire it. 

While thus deciding, a plainly-dressed, 
formal-looking little woman came out, 
and, opening the gate, announced herself 
to be Mrs. O'Brady, by welcoming Emily 
to Copsely. 

Not one of Ovid's metamorphoses was 
ever more sudden than the change which 
now took place in the looks of Emil}^; 
she seemed indeed, for a few minutes, to 
be transformed to stone, so utterly mute 
and motionless did she remain, staring at 
Mrs. O'Brady with astonishment and dis* 



213 

in ay. But we will not dwell on the first 
bitterness of her disappointment, or the 
wild ideas that for a little while made her 
hesitate to quit the chaise. With recoil- 
ing, disgust she at length forced herself to 
do so. 

The chaise discharged, JSIrs. O'Brady 
proceeded to inform her, that Mr. O'Brady 
was out, looking a'ter some timber he had 
lately made a purchase* of; but that he 
would be back by dinner; and, in the 
meanwhile, desired to know if she would 
not like some'at â€” a morsel of bread and 
cheese, or a ham sandwich, with a glass 
of currant wine; but at the same time add- 
ed, if she had rather not, she wouldn't 
press her, as, casting her eyes upon a table^ 
clock, mounted upon the top of an old- 
fashioned corner cupboard, filled with 
showy mugs, jugs, and glasses, it was 
then two o'clock, and they should dine at 
three ; and it would be a pity she should 
spoil her appetite, for, expecting her, she 
had got a pair of Dorkin fowl, and a nice 



2U 

bit of veal, with a tongue of her own 
curing, for dinner. 

" Dine at three !" repeated the horrified 
Emily. 

" Yes," was the reply ; " but, to be 
sure," mistaking the cause of her surprise, 
" it is rather a latish hour, at least for us 
good folks here in the country ; but it all 
comes of JMr. O'Brady, who, being a mi- 
litary man, can't, by no means, bear din- 
ing earlier, though I've often begged it 
on him as a favour. However, while you 
are here, I dare say hell obhge you. Miss 
St. Orme, by doing so ; for men are ge- 
nerally more complaisant to others than 
to their own wives." 

" Good God, ma'am !" exclaimed the 
indignant and disgusted Emily, " do you 
think I have been brought up amongst 
Goths?" Then looking for a bell, and not 
finding one, she haughtily demanded 
where she should find a servant to shew 
her to her chamber? 

Mrs. O'Brady, without replying, went 



215 

out into the passage, and called out, " ]\Ia- 
rian !" No Marian immediately appear- 
ing, she repeated the call in still-shriller 
accents, crying out â€” " What, in the name 
of Heaven, are you doing on, JNIarian, 
that you don't come ?" 

At length a poor, pale, evidently- scared- 
looking girl made her appearance, and was 
soundly rated for not having come at once. 
She tried to excuse herself, by saying, she 
had been scrubbing out the nursery, as 
desired, when she got the child to sleep ; 
but her mistress flatly contradicted her, 
protesting she knew, from her new top- 
knot being pinned on, she had been look- 
ing out of the window, instead of mind- 
ing her business; but she should take care 
to prevent such tricks for the future. 

The exasperated feelings of Emily found 
vent the moment she found herself alone; 
she had been deceived â€” imposed upon, 
and her anger and resentment were ex- 
cessive. She had taken it into her head, 
that the abode of Mr. O'Brady was a beau- 
tiful cottaj^e, embowered in sweets; his 



216 

wife a pretty, sentimental little woman, 
just fit to ornament such a dwelling; and 
he himself a fine soldierly man, half-sports- 
man, half-scholar, ranging over the coun- 
try of a morning with his gun, and diver- 
sifying the evening with a book or his 
flute ; instead of which, here was a place 
like a hedge-alehouse â€” a woman only fit 
to scold in a kitchen â€” and a man, she con- 
cluded, from all she had already seen, only 
half-civilized, with a brogue a mile long, 
and blurting out blunders at every word. 

Oh, Heavens ! oh, earth ! to be betrayed 
into such a habitation, and obliged to as- 
sociate with such beings ! She could infi- 
nitely better â€” yes, no comparison, better 
have assimilated with ISIrs. Perkins ; she 
had once passed a little time under her 
roof with her mother; and despite of pre- 
judice, she had been compelled to acknow- 
ledge, that her manners were by no means 
amiss, or her style of living. She con- 
trasted her respectable-looking houseâ€” her 
handsome, spacious, well-furnished draw- 
ing-room, where even occasionally she en- 



217 

tertained some of the most respectable in- 
habitants of the town, so highly was she 
estimated for her character, with the place 
v/here she was ; and her scornful rejection 
of her proffered kindness came atinvart 
her mind with a mingled sensation of re- 
gret and shame. â€” " Yet, after all," slie 
cried, trying to excuse hei'self, " it v/as but 
natural for me to refuse it, as certainly a 
residence with her would not have been 
at all the thinor for a girl entitled to such 
an introduction to life as I am." 

Still, however, she could not help \\ ish- 
ing she had not done so so decidedly. Well, 
she had, and she found herself in a place 
very different to what she expected ; and 
what was to be done? Why, since she 
incurred the trouble of such a journey, 
she believed she must remain quietly 
where she was, till she at least heard from 
JMr. Elmore, who had promised, as soon 
after his arrival in America as possible, to 
send her a remittance, as she rather feared 
what remained in her purse, after her re- 

VOL. II. L 



218 

cent disbursements, would not be quite 
adequate to meet the expences of a fa- 
shionable boarding-house in London, whi- 
ther her imagination immediately trans- 
ported her. In the meanwhile, she should 
prevent any annoying familiarity, by the 
reserve of her manner ; it was due to her- 
self to let Mr. O'-Brady see he was indebt- 
ed for her visit to misapprehension. 

Thus loftily determined, she received a 
summons to dinner; her habit was not 
yet off, so she could not immediately obey 
it. She was just ready, when a second 
came from Mrs. O'Brady, begging her to 
liasten, as the child was crying for some'at, 
and master wouldn't let the covers be 
taken off till she came down. 

Down at last she went ; Mr. O'Brady 
received her at the parlour-door; a glance 
was sufficient to let her see he much better 
answered the second than the first idea 
she had conceived of him. Whatever of 
elegance, however, there might be want- 
ing in his manner, there was nothing of 
cordiality; rather too much of this, in- 



219 

deed, considering the distance at which 
she meant to keep him. He shook her 
warmly by the hand, welcomed her most 
kindly, and leading her forward, introdu- 
ced her to the party that had been invited 
out of compliment to her, consisting of the 
doctor of the place, his wife, and an excise- 
man. Heavens! v/hat a set to be intro- 
duced to her! how did she draw back, 
and stare, and shrink within herself, at tlie 
moment ! The party seated, Mr. O'Brady 
was proceeding to ask her what she would 
be helped to, when Mrs. O'Erady rather 
peevishly prevented him, by desiring he 
wouldn't be teazing the dear babe no 
longer, but help her at once to something. 

" Why then, I\Irs. O'Brady, I wonder 
at your manners ; but since, for the sake 
of pase, I suppose I must, what's she to 
be helped to ? though I thought she had 
a cutlit already, and I am sure that was 
thousands for her." 

"Well, never you mind that â€” so she 
had ; but that was two hours ago, and by 
l2 



220 

this time she must be hungry again, I am 
sure, dear babe !" Then stooping to the 
child, who was sitting by her â€” " What 
Avill you have, love? â€” a bit of that," point- 
ing to the bottom dish, " or a bit of this, 
white chick-a-bittee?" 

" Both," the young lady very plainly said, 
and to both she was accordingly helped. 
But a view of the dinner occasioned no 
little consternation to the master of the 
house, the fowls being done to rags, and 
the veal raw. â€” " Well, to be sure !" he said, 
with a groan. " Why then, Mrs. O'Bra- 
dy, is this a specimen of the good dinners 
you are always boasting of giving your 
friends ? the fowls ready to pulverize, and 
the veal only just fit to be sent back to 
the fire! Ah then, woman alive, if I was 
Job himself, I couldn't but be angry !" 

" Lord, my dear! what a fuss you put 
yourself into ! I v/anted a drop of chicken 
broth for the babe, so I had the fowls just 
get an extra boil ; and as to the veal, I'm 
sure it's done enough for mincing to-mor- 
row." 



221 

" Zounds, ma'am ! it was for to-day, not 
to-morrow, it was drest ; but so your brat 
is attended to, you don't care the devil for 
any one else." 

Mrs. O'Brady set up a roar. â€” " The 
brat ! to be calhng the dear babe a brat ! 
But I know how it is â€” nothing; is right 
here, because you want to be getting me 
to your own country ; but I'll die first be- 
fore you shall get me to any such outland- 
ish place. No, no, I have seen enough of 
one Irishman not to wish to see more of 
them." 

" Troth ! and I am sure one Irish mar\ 
has seen enough of you to wish he hadn't 
seen so much. But what's to be done, 
]\Iiss St. Orme ?" drawing his chair in again 
to the table ; " I don't see the least chance 
of your getting a taste of dinner." 

Emily, a little pitying his distress, said 
the fowl was not too much done for her, 
and she was accordingly helped to some. 
JNIr. Walker, the exciseman, then begged 
he might have the honour of sending her 
a slice of tongue â€” JMrs. O'Brady's tongue, 



222 

which, of course, was all that was requisite 
to know it must be liked. 

Mr. O'Brady burst into a loud laugh. 
" Liked because it is hers. â€” Ah, then, Tom' 
Walker, you are a devil, to be sure â€” but 
come, let's see what's that before you." 

The tongue, however, inexorably resist- 
ed all attempts at making an incision in 
it, and, in a rage, ^ir. O'Erady ordered it 
away. As the servant was obeying him, 
Mr. Walker gravely requested it might 
carefully be laid aside for him, to be sent 
as a curious petrifaction to a friend who 
was furnishing a museum. 

At length, this agreeably-seasoned dinr 
ner over, and JNlrs. O'Brady brought to 
h.erself by the kind attentions of Mr. Wal- 
ker, she drank to the good health of Miss 
St. Orme, with a hope that she would ex- 
cuse what had past, in consideration that 
such things would happen at times in the 
best-regulated families, as slie would yet 
know one day, when she came to have 
one of her own. She then proceeded to 
bring forward her pet to notice. â€” " I see 



22S 

by your look, ^Miss St. Orme," she said; 
" that you are fond of children, and this 
dear little thing Vv^ill delight you ; we had 
her up to town this spring, and you never 
knew the like. Tell the lady, dear, what 
the men cried when you were going up 
to bed, and you shall have wine out of 
papa's glass." 

" Pash't six o'clock !" 

" And what did the man with the long 
beard, and the bag under his arm, say of a 
morning at the window ?" 

" Ole closhâ€” ole closh !" 

" That's a darling ; well, now go and 
kiss the lady," setting her down for the 
purpose. Emily, however, instinctively 
drew back from her greasy little paws; 
and Mrs. O'Brady, all indignation at her 
being so affronted, hastily snatched her 
up in her arms, and marched, or rather 
waddled off with her. 

Mrs. Mallows then made an effort to en- 
ter into conversation with Emily, but 
which was haughtily repulsed ; but short- 
ly after, on the introduction of pipes, she 



224 

ivas obliged to speak to her in her own de- 
fence. They went out, and continued 
walking backwards and forwards before 
the door, till JNIr. O'Brady called to them 
they might come in, as smoking was over, 
and tea ready. Tea however W'as not 
ready ; the tea-things were laid, but Mrs. 
O'Brady was still absent from the parlour, 
nor, though repeatedly sent to by her hus- 
band, returned for a considerable time. 
When, at length, she did condescend to 
make her appearance, without the slightest 
upology for her absence, she immediately 
commenced an attack on her husband for 
his keeping such a worriting, when he 
knew the child wasn't asleep. 

" Hang the child [" he cried ; " there's 
more plague with her than there was with 
Phin llyan's ould horse that always want- 
ed patching up." 

*' Hang the child ! hang the dear babe !" 
exclaimed the exasperated mother, and 
again she set up a roar â€” " but this is only 
wiiat 1 expected." 

" Ah ! then why the plague are you 



225 

surprised at it? But come, be after mak- 
ing tay, ^Irs. O'Brady, I beg, or I'll be 
saving you the trouble. Here's Mrs. Mal- 
lows and Miss St. Orme choking, I dare 
say, by this time, for a dish." 

"No, that you sha'n't," she said, nimbly 
jumping up, and snatching the caddy out 
of his hand ; " no one shall make tea for 
me, or sit at the head of my table, as you, 
are always wanting, with your Irish cus- 
toms, but myself." 

The moment tea was over, a rubber 
of whist was eagerly proposed by Mr. 
O'Brady. Doctor Mallows had left them. 
Mrs. O'Brady positively refused playing, 
and Emily was accordingly pressed, but she 
held out in her assertion of never doing so. 

"Then you must," said Mr. O'Brady, 
turning gruffly to his wife, as she was 
making her escape as fast as she could out 
of the room, to liave a little gossip with 
the servants, jerking, as he spoke, a pack 
of cards out of a case, the sight of which, 
if even previously disposed to oblige him, 
L 3 



226 

would now effectually have prevented 
Emily from doing. 

" Who, I ?" cried Mrs. O'Brady ; " not 
I indeed. Miss St. Orme has nothing 
else to do ; and you know our great wash 
is to-morrow, and I have the servants to 
speak to abovit it. Besides, I made a vow 
I'd never play again with you, such a 
player as you are ; and so hot, and so has- 
ty, bouncing about, bless us ! like a parch* 
ed pea, grumbling and fighting when you 
lose, when 'tis all your own fault, never 
leading through an honour, or bringing 
out a trump, except forced." 

" Well, now that you have said all that 
you could, be off with yourself!" cried the 
incensed husband, "and I'll take what, 
God knows, I wish I could always keep 
in your place, Dumby." 

Just as the clock struck nine, and they 
were getting into the spirit of the game, 
at least, Mr. O'Brady, whose partner, Dum- 
by, had achieved wonders for him, Mrs. 
O'Brady reappeared, with a demand if 
they knew what o'clock it was? 



227 

" Ah ! then do vou think we are bother^ 
ed that we don't ?" was the reply of her 
husband. 

" Lord ! my dear, how yon talk ! but 
when once you get to cards, you never 
think how time goes. Recollect, the maids 
must be up betimes to-morrow to begin 
the wash. The bread and cheese is just 
coming in, so you may as well put by 
now." 

" D â€” n the bread and cheese !" he cried, 
in a fury, throwing down the cards, know- 
ing, when once she was set upon a thing, 
there was no use in resistance, " and the 
maids ! and " But recollecting him- 
self a little â€” " Pray have we nothing but 
this ould crust of cheese for supper?" 

" Lord ! my dear, what a fuss you are 
in ! jyirs. JNlallows, no more than myself, 
is no supper body; and as to Miss St. 
Orme, after drinking tea so late, Pm sure' 
she couldn't be inclined for any thing. But 
if you like, you may have all that's in the 
pantry brought in; but if you do, you'll 
want, I promise j^u, for I sha'n't go to dio 



228 

no such thing as to take the maids from 
the wash to dress a fresh dinner for you 
to-morrow." 

Here Emily, completely disgusted by 
all she had seen, called for a bed candle, 
and leaving her to the repose she needed, 
we shall close this chapter. 



CHAPTER II. 



" He saw her charming." 

She was awoke the next morning by Mr. 
O'Brady's knocking against the ceiling to 
make her get up ; for, considering her as 
a mere girl, he did not think much cere- 
mony requisite with her. Of a contrary 
opinion, however, Emily was so enraged 
at this disrespectful mode of treating her, 
that a considerable time elapsed ere she 
could bring herself to go down. When 
at length she did, she found the happy 



229 

couple seated opposite to one another, with 
the pet by her mother, amusing herself 
with slopping the tray, and dropping her 
bread and butter on the cloth. â€” " Well, 
Miss St. Or me, 1 hope you haven't hur- 
ried yourself this morning," said Mr. 
O'Brady, as she passed to a chair. 

" No, sir, I never do," was the cool and 
contemptuous reply. 

]Mrs. O'Erady never went out, except 
to the shop ; and Mr. O'Brady, who hated 
a walk, for the mere sake of a walk, per- 
suaded himself he had no time for ram- 
bling; Emily passed two days without 
absolutely knowing what to do with her- 
self, when Mr. O'Brady, beginning to 
think some amusement should be contriv- 
ed for her, proposed engaging Mrs. Mal- 
lows, who was fond of gadding, to walk 
about with her: wishing to see something 
of the country, the proposal was accepted. 

Their first ramble was to Leith Hill; 
two young assistants of the doctor's, styled, 
by Emily, Pestle and Mortar, attended 
them. 



230 

They set out early, in order to be there 
by noon, at which time exactly, if the day 
be fine, and there is a good glass, the sea 
can be seen, through Shoreham Gap, tho' 
at the distance of thirty miles. 

The walk was about five miles, but 
none of the party thought any thing of 
this ; at all events, no carriage was to be 
procured in the place. Instead of taking 
the high-road, they proceeded through 
copses and bye-lanes, w4uch had never* 
known the impression of any other wheel 
than that of a broad- wheeled waggon, till 
they came to Oakley Church, where they 
paused, for the double purpose of resting 
themselves in the old porch, and letting^ 
Emily examine whether any vestiges of 
the custom, that had once prevailed here, 
of planting rdse-bushes on the graves of 
young, unmarried persons, still remained â€” 
a custom supposed to be derived from the 
Greeks and Romans, who, according to 
their poets, Anacreon and Ovid, thought 
roseSj planted upon graves, perftuned and 
protected the ashes of the dead. She could 



3S1 

trace nothing of the kind, however; but 
the wide range of prospect that was hence 
commanded was in itself alone worth 
stopping to contemplate. Hence, passing 
the site of an old castle, the moat of whiclv 
is still distinctly to be traced, they entered 
the village, the quietude, rural neatness, and 
beauty of which, with the fine viev/ it 
affords of Leith Hill, which, though at a 
distance, seems pressing on it, enchanted 
Emily. 

At length they gained the object of 
their walk ; but on reaching the base, they 
were obliged, from its perpendicular ele- 
vation, to wind round to a fine broad road, 
that gradually advanced them to the sum- 
mit. On gaining it, Emily thought her- 
self well compensated for all the trouble 
and fatigue of the walk, by the glorious 
prospect that burst upon her view ; but of 
this an abler pen will give an idea. 

" In a late journey which I took into 
the wilds of Sussex," says an eminent wri- 
ter, " I passed over a hill, that shewed 
me a morc transporting sight than ever 



232 

the country had before shewn me, either 
in England or Italy. The prospects which 
in Italy pleased me most are those of the 
Valdanno, from the Appenines ; that of 
Rome, and the Mediterranean, from the 
mountain of Viterbo (of Rome at forty, 
and of the JMediterranean at fifty miles 
distance from it) ; and that of the Cam- 
pagna of Rome, from Tivoli and Frescati, 
from which two places you see every foot 
of that famous Campagna, even from the 
bottom of Tivoli and Frescati, to the very 
foot of the mountain of Viterbo, without 
any thing to interrupt your sight. Bat 
from a hill which I passed in my late jour- 
ney into Sussex, I had a prospect more 
extensive than any of these, and which 
surpassed them at once in rural charms, in 
pomp, and in magnificence. The hill 
which I speak of is called Leith Hill, and 
is about five miles southward from Dor- 
kin, about six from Box Hill, and near 
twelve from Epsom. It juts out about 
two miles beyond that range of hills 
which terminates the North Downs to the 



233 

south. When I saw, from one of these 
hills, at about two miles distance, that 
side of Leith Hill which faces the Northern 
Downs, it appeared the most beautiful pro- 
spect I had ever seen ; but after we had 
conquered the hill itself, I saw a sight that 
looked like enchantment and vision, but 
vision beatific. Beneath us lay open to 
our view all the wilds of Surrey and Sus- 
sex, and a great part of that of Kent, ad- 
mirably diversified, in every part of them, 
with woods, and fields of corn and pas- 
ture, and ever}^ where adorned with state- 
ly rows of trees. 

" This beautiful vale is about thirty 
miles in breadth and sixty in length, and 
is terminated, to the south, by the majes- 
tic range of the southern hills and the sea ; 
and it is no easy matter to decide, whe- 
ther these hills (which appear at thirty, 
forty, fifty miles distance, with their tops 
in the sky) appear more awful and vener- 
able, or the delicious vale between you 
and them more inviting. 

" About noon, in a serene day, you m^y. 



234 

at thirty miles distance, see the very wa- 
ter of the sea, through a chasm of the 
mountains; and that which, above all, 
makes it a noble prospect, is, that at the 
same time that, at thirty miles distance, 
you behold the very water of the sea, at 
the same time that you behold, to the 
south, the most delicious rural prospect in 
the world, at that very time, by a little turn 
of your head towards the north, you look 
full over Box Hill, and see the country 
beyond it, between that and London; 
and over the very stomacher of it, see St. 
Paul's, at twenty-five miles distance, and 
London beneath it, with Highgate and 
Hampstead beyond." 

It was about five when the party got 
back to dinner, at which the doctor and 
Mr. Walker were invited to meet them. 

" Lord-a-mercy, what have you all been 
about!" was the first salutation of Mrs. 
O'Brady on their entrance; " staying out 
so late, when you knew the dear pet would 
be wanting her dinner !" 

"Ah, then, Mrs. O^Brady, be asy!" 



235 

said her husband ; " is it for such a pin- 
keen of a thing they were to have been 
hurrying themselves !" 

" Lord, Mr. O'Brady, don't be calling 
the child names ! I'm sure I don't know^ 
not I, what's to be seen at Leith Hill, 
not I ; any one might see enough of it, I 
think, from the village ; a cold bleak place, 
I'm sure ; the day I was got there, it blew 
such a hurricane, I was glad to sit down 
on the ground." 

A few evenings after this, as Emily was 
strolhng about by herself till tea (Mr. and 
Mrs. O'Brady, if they did not quarrel, al- 
ways commencing cribbage the moment 
dinner was over), just as she had gained 
the edge of a steep hill, through which 
the road advancing into the countr\^ w^as 
cut, leaving high precipitous banks on 
either side, overgrown with matted vege- 
tation, with here and there an old tree of 
the soil waving its massy arms over the 
hollow below, a very elegant travelling- 
carriage, in the direction for town, with 
outriders, and every thing betokening its 



236 

belonging to a person of fashion and con- 
sequence, made her stop to look at it; and 
as she did so, she saw a gentleman in it 
earnestly regarding her; she blushed at 
the intentness of his gaze, and instinctive- 
ly turned away, but not without an agree- 
able sensation at the idea of the admira- 
tion with which she had evidently been 
regarded. But to be seen was all that was 
requisite to obtain this ; and so entitled, 
and so certain as she was of the homage 
and the respect of the elegant and the 
fashionable, what a pity that she should 
be longer doomed to waste her sweetness 
on the desert air of Copsely! but she 
should not be much longer obliged to sub* 
mit to so mortifying a penance. 

Consoling herself with the hope, her 
thoughts reverted with complacence to the 
advantage with ^vhich she must have ap- 
peared, as the carriage was passing, stand- 
ing on an elevation, that gave full effect 
to her figure, with her scarf disposed 
in graceful drapery about her, and her 
complexion, as she felt, heightened by the 



237 

air. Yes â€” no wonder she should have 
struck the stranger â€” no wonder he should 
have looked, and no wonder if she should 
hear something more about him. 

Just as she conceived tlie possibility of 
this, she turned round, on hearing some 
one behind her, and started at beholding the 
identical stranger she was just then think- 
ing of, making his way up the ascent. 
The idea of impertinence immediately 
struck her; and taking advantage of his 
bein<T entan^rled in the briars and brambles 
of the bank, from not knowing the path 
through them, she darted into a less em- 
barrassed one, nor stopped again till she 
found herself at Mr. O'Brady's gate, when, 
glancing behind her, she was not sorry to 
find she had been followed ; for if he wish- 
ed to follow up the adventure, here was a 
clew^ to obtain a proper introduction to her. 

" Well, Miss St. Orme," said Mrs. 
O'Brady, w^ho was putting aside the crib- 
bage-board as she entered, and preparing 
to make tea, '*' we were wishing for you 
since." 



** Were yon, ma'am?" said Emily, coldly. 

" Yes, that you might have seen the 
duke of Holmsdale; he has just spanked 
by, in his handsome travelling-carriage." 

" The duke of Holmsdale !" repeated 
Emily, with the vermilion of surprise and 
delight overspreading her face and neck. 

Â« Yes^ie's lord of the manor here, and 
has a fine castle on the coast, so he's al- 
wavs drivincr backwards and forwards." 

" And if he was to see you, I suppose," 
said her husband, " we should have him 
running away with you ; for he's a devil, 
they say, for gallantry." 

" Lord, my dear, how you talk ! He's 
not worse than his neighbours, I dare say." 

But Emily heard nothing more of what 
either said about him ; she was lost in an 
absolute tumult of delight, at discovering 
he was the person whose admiration she 
had attracted. 

The flutter of her spirits would not al- 
low her to settle to any thing. She awoke 
the next morning in the same ; and hav- 
ing dressed herself with studious care, sat 



239 

in momentary expectation of some agitat- 
ing announcement. But the minutes sped 
without any thing of the kind, and she at 
last decided on going out : she would not 
subject herself to the vulgar jokes of Mr. 
O'Brady, by asking any questions at home, 
but abroad she might chance to hear or 
see something that might put her out of 
suspense. But supposing she should hear 
the duke was gone to London, that should 
not mortify or disappoint, when there was 
no knowing the moment he might be 
back; and then 

A little apart from the village stood 
the cottage of Mr. Chillingworth, a Lon- 
don solicitor, exactly such a one as Emily 
had pictured to herself Mr. O'Brady's, 
light, elegant, with verandas and awnings, 
and all the voluptuous embellishments of 
mpdern taste; and as she passed and re- 
passed it continually, with an admiring 
eye, as often she wished to know its in- 
mates. 

From this wish, of course, it must be 
understood she had never exactly heard 



S40 

any particulars about them. ]\Ir. Chilling- 
worth was one of the duke of Holmsdale's 
numerous agents; and Fame did whisper, 
that in marrying his lady he had relieved 
his grace from an encumbrance. 

Be that as it may, Emily was now saun- 
tering past the cottage, when she was over- 
taken and stoj)ped by Mrs. Chillingworth 
herself, who, having apologized for stop- 
ping her, but with a hope that when she 
heard her reason she would excuse it, pro- 
ceeded to express the ardent wish she had 
felt for her acquaintance, from the first mo- 
ment of seeing her, but which her not vi- 
siting at Mrs. O'Brady's had hitherto pre- 
vented her making any effort for. 

She was handsome and fashionable, and 
not less prepossessing in her address than 
appearance, and, of course, Emily could not 
but be flattered by the wish she had ex- 
pressed : she turned back with her to the 
cottage, the interior of which, in elegant 
decorations, surpassed even the exterior- 
sat some time with herâ€” ^and finally pro- 
mised to call on her in the evening â€” spend 



241 . 

as much time as possible with her, and 
say nothing of their acquaintance to Mrs. 
O^Brady, lest, in pique at hers never hav- 
ing been sought by Mrs. ChilHngvvorth, 
si.e should attempt to interrupt it. 

'* \Vell, one should never despair," 
thought Emily, as she was bending her 
steps homewards. " How wonderfully 
matters are improving in this stupid place ! 
Here I have made quite a delightful ac- 
quaintance â€” one that it is quite a delasse- 
vient to one's spirits to think of sitting with 
now and then, after being cooped up so 
long with the O'Bradys, and " 

She blushed to herself, as vanity finish- 
ed the sentence. 

" The evening is delicious,'' said Mrs. 
Chillingworth, as they were sitting at tea. 
" I'll take you to Woodhouse, if you like 
it â€” it will just be a pleasant walk." 

" Woodhouse !" said Emilv. 

"Yes ; have you never heard of it? It 
is a wild, romantic- looking place, belongs 
ing to the duke of Holmsdale ; he has it 

VOL. II. M 



242 

fitted up for select parties, and occasionally 
passes a few days there, in his way back- 
wards and forwards to town." 

" Some one said he passed yesterday," 
observed Emily, but rather looking down 
as she spoke. 

" Yes, he did. Mr. Chillingworth wrote 
me word he was expected in town." 

Nothing further was said on the subject. 
They went out, and after proceeding for 
about a mile, by a very pleasant road, 
struck through a light, elegant gate, into 
the plantations of Woodhouse. A cir- 
cuitous avenue of considerable extent 
wound through them, divided from them 
by a chain fence ; a great deal of beautiful 
garden scenery was displayed at either 
side, backed by fine masses of wood ; but 
at the end of this mazy avenue, there was 
an end of all further intermingling ; they 
plunged at once from it into the deep 
bleak gloom of a wild-tangled wood, about 
the centre of which the house was built, 
on the side of a hill, a strange, rambling, 
curious-built place, so constructed, that 



243 

from the hill, against which it was built, 
there was ingress to every part of it behind. 

" Come," said Mrs. Chillingworth, after 
Emily had gazed about her for a few mo- 
ments with wonder, " now that you have 
seen something of the outside, 1 will give 
you a peep at the inside ;" and bounding 
up amongst the trees as she spoke, she 
beckoned her to follow. 

Emily obeyed ; and they scrambled on 
till they came to a large Vv^indow, which 
Mrs. Chillingworth threw up. â€” " What ! 
in this way are you going to enter the 
house?" said Emily, in a tone of surprise. 

" Yes, there is no danger, even if we 
should encounter any of the servants, for 
they all know me, and," laughing, " that 
I am one of those entitled to the entreT 

" Well, let me also look about me here 
too," said Emily, " for a minute or two, 
before I go in ;" and the scene she stopped 
to contemplate was indeed deserving of 
admiration. â€” the still-gorgeous west, with 
the dazzling glories it shed upon the op- 
m2 



244 ^ 

posite chain of hills, of Avhich the spot 
where slie now stood commanded a full 
prospect, forming a contrast, of the most 
impressive description, to the blackness of 
the woody gulf from which she had emer- 
ged below, where, even in the meridian 
of day, it seemed scarcely possible that a 
solitary sunbeam could wander through 
the gloom, while the effect of the scene 
altogether was heightened by the tinkling 
of rills in the dells of the hill, and the 
song of the nightingale, that w^as already 
thrilling from the sequestered thickets, 
most musical, most melancholy. 

" Well, come, now that you have gazed 
on the sublime, let me lead you to the 
beautifnl," said Mrs. Chillingworth, again 
laughing. 

Emily stepped after her into the house; 
and after going up stairs and down stairs, 
and round about, owing to the construc- 
tion of the building, they at length reach- 
ed the duke's favourite sitting-room. It 
was a long, lofty apartment; the trees, 
just before the grand range of windows 



245 

Avere just sufficiently cleared away to pre- 
vent any interception to the prospect it 
was elevated enough to command. Its 
style of decoration was of the most volup- 
tuous description ; and beyond, through 
light pillars, it led to a colonnade, stretched 
along the now-moonlight brow of the hill, 
with seats for sitting to contemplate the 
view, and whence, like a censer, the even- 
ing air flung the scents of the plants that 
lined it through the apartment. 

Emily was charmed, and taken by sur- 
prise, expressed a little more admiration 
than she might otherwise have done, lest 
of having it supposed she was not perfectly 
accustomed to things of the kind. â€” " His 
grace is fond of music, I presume," she 
said, observing some musical instrum.ents 
in the apartment. 

" Yes, he often has concerts here ; and 
the effect is delightful, I assure you, as 
you sit in the colonnade. This is the harp," 
laughing, " he loves so well ; let me hear 
you touch it, for, you^ know, as we were 



246 

coming along, you acknowledged you 
played. You should like the harp, for 
you are just the figure for it, putting one 
in mind of Ossian's white-armed maids." 

Emily laughed as she drew the superb 
instrument towards her. â€” " Well," she 
thought, as her fingers wandered through 
the strings, " if the duke was to appear 
now, that would be indeed an incident." 

At the instant she saw a shadow in the 
colonnade opposite to which she was sit- 
ting; she kept her eye on it â€” it moved 
to the pillars, and she half saw a figure 
gazing through them. A scream escaped 
her, and she made a spring towards the 
door by which they had entered ; but ere 
she had gained it, the person she had seen, 
rushing forward, threw himself before it, 
and called out to her not to be alarmed. â€” 
" Mrs. Chillingworth," he said, " pray tell 
your lovely friend she has no cause for 
apprehension." 

" My God ! your grace here !" exclaim- 
ed Mrs. ChilHngworth, starting from the 



247 

sofa on which she had thrown herself. 
" Why, I thought, long before this, you 
were in London." 

" I meant to be; but just as I got here, 
I felt myself so unwell, I decided on stop- 
ping for a night or two, but without in- 
tending to let it be known, as I wished 
to remain quiet." 

" Then I am sure I have many apo- 
logies for breaking in upon your grace." 

" Now how can you talk so? Don't 
you know you are always welcome? that 
those we esteem and admire can never 
break in upon us? Indeed, I had it in 
contemplation, this very evening, knowing 
Chillingworth would not be jealous at 
your paying me a visit in his absence, to 
have sent for you, to sit an hour or two 
with me, but for an unexpected letter I 
was obliged to answer immediately. But 
introduce me to your beautiful friend, and 
give me reason to congratulate myself on 
having remained, by the attainment of a 
happiness I was longing for." 



248 

" How is that ?" demanded Mrs. Chil- 
lingworth, with quickness. 

His grace laughed, and explained. 

" Oh, if I had known all this," she re- 
sumed, " I might have seen there was no 
occasion for my recent apology I" and she 
proceeded to name Emily. 

The ceremony of introduction over, seats 
w^ere resumed, for his grace would not 
hear of the ladies leaving him immediate- 
ly ; it would be barbarous â€” cruel, he said, 
and neither were inclined to be inflexible. 

The flutter of Emily, at the suddenness 
of her introduction to him, w^as presently 
got the better of â€” at least sufficiently so 
to enable her to display her agremens to 
advantage; she laughed, and chatted, and 
sung, and played, and returned rallying 
answers to the compliments he paid her, 
and rendered herself perfectly captivating. 
What a stimulus had she for doing so, to 
complete or secure the conquest she saw 
she had made ! 

His grace, without being either very 



249 

young or veiy handsome, had a dignified 
person, and an imposing elegance of 
address, well calculated to further his 
wishes ; his rank, however, was certainly 
at present his chief charm in Emily's eyes; 
in time, it was to be supposed his other 
recommendations would have their effect ; 
but at present that was all she thought of 

The minutes sped imperceptibly; the 
Grecian lamp and alabaster vases of the 
apartment were lighted, and an elegant 
collation was brought in. At length the 
ladies must peremptorily go ; but the duke 
would not release them till JNIrs. Chil- 
lingworth had promised to come the next 
evening, and bring her beautiful friend 
along with her. He would then, despite 
of his indisposition, see them through the 
grounds, and would have gone on to the 
village, but that Mrs. Chillingworth told 
him there were reasons for rendering that 
improper, which she should take another 
opportunity of explaining. â€” " Yes, we 
must tell him," she said to Emily, on his 
M 3 



250 

leaving them, " exactly how you are situ- 
ated, that there may be no dilemmas : but 
what do you think of him ?" 

" Oh, that is not a fair question for his 
friend to ask," replied Emily, laughing. 

" Well, it is easy enough to see what 
he thinks of you. Yes, that is perfectly 
clear. But you are quite a beauty to his 
taste â€” dark-eyed and dark-haired ; flaxen- 
haired and blue-eyed ones have no place 
in his imagination. If ever he marries, it 
will be for love, I am sure." 

Vanity and inexperience gave to Emily 
all the credulity that could be desired. 
Her delicious reveries, in consequence, 
may easily be imagined. Their effect 
upon her was to render her still more en- 
chanting; and the duke perhaps could 
not, if he would, have disguised the im- 
pression she had made on him: He seem- 
ed quite to have forgot he had any busi- 
ness in London. 

A week passed away delightfully, the 
greater part of every morning, and the 
whole of every evening, being spent in 



251 

â€¢ 

his apartments; no doubt, no suspicion, 
occurred to damp or darken the enjoy- 
ment of Emily ; she was all confidence â€” 
all certainty â€” enchanting, intoxicating 
certainty. She had heard, it is true, of 
plots and plans, laid by the artful and fla- 
gitious, for the destruction of innocence ; 
but for a person connected as she was to 
fear any thing of the kind, would have 
been quite absurd. She had taken care 
to apprise Mrs. Chillingworth of her pre- 
tensions ; and who would dare venture to 
offer an insult, or meditate an injury a- 
gainst a person who had to boast of the 
noble blood of the Ballyhackets, and Bal> 
lyhewans, and Ballyturberts in her veins, 
and who had only to turn over the leaves 
of Irish history to point out the numerous 
abbeys, and churches, and castles, that were 
founded, and endowed, and elevated to 
renown, by her ancestors? No, the idea 
was quite too ridiculous to be conceived. 
The duke wanted not fortune; and in 
every respect but that there would be no- 



252 

thing unequal in an alliance with her; 
there was no reason, therefore, to think 
it improbable or undesigned. 

Once or twice there was a little some- 
thing in the manner of the dukeâ€” a fer- 
vour in his language â€” an attempt at free- 
dom, that nearly startled her; but the 
moment she shrunk back, like the coy 
Mimosa, that moment his manner became 
as usual; and what had occurred passed 
off as the mere effect of feelings of a pe- 
culiarly-impassioned description. 

At length, one morning, on calling, as 
usual, on Mrs. 'Chilling worth, her feelings 
received a shock she had not the power to 
conceal, by the abrupt information of the 
duke having departed for London. She 
felt herself turn pale, and IMrs, Chilling- 
worth saw it. 

Her panic, however, was not of long 
continuance; Mrs. Chillingworth, satis- 
fied with seeing, did not w^ant to prolong 
it, and quickly relieved her from it, by 
saying â€” " But he will be back in a day 



253 

or two, else you may be sure he would not 
have gone in this manner; yes, time 
enough to escort us to the ball." 

" What ball?" demanded Emily. 

" AVhy the one given annually by the 

hunting club belonging to O . There 

is always a great display of fashion at 
them, and that next Thursday is expected 
to be the most brilliant thing of the kind 
that has been yet given." 

"But how can T go," said Emily, "with- 
out betraying what it seemed expedient 
to us to conceal ?" 

" Oh, nothing easier ! Mrs. O'Brady's 
maid, Phillis, once lived with me ; she's a 
good-natured girl, and may be trusted. 
When the family have retired, she can let 
you out, and at O you can dress." 

Emily made no objection â€” could make 
no objection to a proposal so delightful; 
her very heart panted with pleasure at the 
thought of exhibiting herself, in all the 
brilliancy of a ball-room, to the admiring 
eyes of the duke. She danced incompar- 
ably, had a beauteous dress, just fit for the 



254 

occasion, and every requisite ornament to 
make her appear to advantage; and, in 
short, if he was not already her decided 
captive, that night must ensure him hers ; 
he would then see what eclat she would 
give to his rank â€” how well her brow would 
become the coronet he could place upon it. 

With the most eager impatience she 
looked forward to the eventful night ; the 
very secrecy and difficulty of going only 
served to heighten the pleasure. How 
delightful, while the O'Bradys imagined 
her stupidly sleeping away, like them- 
selves, to be figuring away in an elegant 
ball-room ! 

Well, the duke returned at the ex- 
pected time, and was in raptures at seeing 
her again, and in raptures at her conde- 
scension in accepting a ticket for the ball. 
The night at length came for this, and the 
appointed hour for going ; and Phillis 
proved herself worthy of being the attend- 
ant of a distressed damsel in romance, so 
adroitly did she manage to get her out 
without noise or disturbance. 



255 

At a little distance from the house, the 
expected carriage was in waiting for her; 
his grace was at the door, ready to hand 
her in. He handed her in, hastily follow- 
ed, the door closed, and the postihons set 
off; and at the instant of their doing so, 
Emily discovered there was no one else in 
the carriage but herself and the duke. 



CHAPTER III. 



Take heed â€” take iieed !" 



She almost screamed at this discovery, and 
desiring the carriage to be stopt, demand- 
ed the reason of this. 

" Why this breathless alarm, my an- 
gel ?" said his grace. " I'm really quite 
hurt by it ;" and he would have taken her 
hand as he spoke, but Emily hastily drew 
it back. "The fact is, Mrs. Chillingworth 
was so afraid, when it came to the point. 



256 

that either your courage would fail you, 
or that you would not be able to get out, 
that she suffered herself to be prevailed 
on by another lady, to whom she also gave 
a ticket, to precede you to O ." 

" This was acting very unkindly," said 
Emily, resentfully ; " and had I been aware 
of her not waiting for me, I should not 
have come; and as it is, I should mucli 
rather get out than go on." 

" Oh, certainly!" replied his grace, 
proudly, "if you think it unsafe to entrust 
yourself for a few minutes to my care. 
But I am not conscious how I have me- 
rited this mistrust ; my actions must very 
much have wronged me, if they ever 
evinced any want of that due reverence 
and esteem I feel for Miss St. Orme." 

" No, certainly â€” assuredly they never 
did. I never meant to intimate any thing 
that could offend your grace; I only meant 

that But you are sure Mrs. Chil- 

lingworth will, at all events, be waiting 
to receive me at the inn." 

" Oh, certain ! I have her positive assur- 



257 

ance that she would not think of entering 
the ball-room till out of suspense about 
you." 

" Oh, well then !" and she said no more 
on the subject. 

A few minutes brought them to O . 

The inn was rendered conspicuous by the 
blaze of light that issued from the win- 
dows, casting a yellow radiance on the 
green before it, and the number of carri- 
ages that were already drawn up about it, 
announcing to the delighted Emily, that 
the ball there, as assured by Mrs. Chilling- 
w^orth, would indeed be a splendid affair. 
But instead of stopping here, as she had 
fully expected, what was her surprise at 
the carriage driving on ! â€” " Stop ! oh, 
stop, for mercy's sake!" she exclaimed, 
making an effort, but an unsuccessful one, 
to let down the front glasses â€” the carriage 
dashed on. 

" For what, my angel?" demanded his 
grace, throwing one arm round her w^aist, 
and with his other hand seizing hers. 

" For what!" shrieked Emily. " Did you 



258 

not tell me Mrs. Chillingworth was wait- 
ing for me at the inn ?" 

" No â€” did I ? If I did, I made a mistake. 
Mrs. Chillingw^orth could not procure an 
apartment at the inn to dress in, and so 
she's gone on a little further to the house 
of a friend." 

A sickness came over Emily. This con- 
tradiction â€” this prevarication, aroused the 
most fearful suspicions. Pushing aside 
his arm, and forcing away her hand, she 
looked from the window ; but there was no 
house â€” no being within sight at the mo- 
ment, and she determined, if possible, to 
constrain her terror till she saw a chance 
of its utterance being useful. 

They went on a little further, when 
something getting wrong with the traces, 
the postilions were obliged to stop. The 
duke impatiently put his head out of the 
window to see what was the matter. 

Emily was on the watch. The glass at 
her side was already down ; she put her 
hand out, and softly opening the door, had 
sprung upon the pathway, and darted up 



259 

a lane, near which the carriage had stopt, 
ere an effort could be made to prevent her. 
At either side of this lane were thick 
coppices of oak, the skirtings of wild ram- 
bling woods, through one of which Emily 
quickly recollected having passed in one 
of her rambles with Mrs. Mallows, in her 
way back to Copsely ; and believing she 
could now readily do the same, and get 
some one at the cottages it led to to see 
her safe the remainder of the way, she had 
no hesitation in making her way over the 
first stile she came to ; but she had not got 
far when she became perfectly convinced 
it was not in the direction she wanted she 
was proceeding. Her confusion and dismay 
at the idea of having lost herself were in- 
describable, aware, as she was, of the woods 
in this direction being notorious as the 
resort of smugglers, and other desperadoes 
from the coast. Shuddering with dread, 
fearful of stopping, yet fearful of advan- 
cing, lest she should plunge unawares into 
some one of the deep gullies that intersect- 
ed the place, and which there was not 



260 

light enough for her now to discern, she 
knew not what to do. In this dilemma 
she heard a shrill whistle, and immediate- 
ly after a hoarse masculine voice replying 
to the signal. Life seemed to forsake her 
at the moment, and she knew nothing 
further of what passed till she felt some 
one lifting her from the ground. Her 
terror however was needless; the party 
that had so alarmed her having nothing 
worse in their thoughts than a little cheat- 
ing, being a farmer belonging to O , 

and two smugglers, whom he had met 
there by appointment. 

While looking about for a snug place 
in which to deposit the contraband articles 
he had made purchase of, Emily was dis- 
covered. At first they thought her dead; 
but on raising her, perceived their mistake. 
The air presently revived her, on her face 
being exposed to it ; but on perceiving 
by whom she was supported, she was 
dropping off again, when farmer Black- 
thorn, giving her arm a httle shake, bade 
her take heart, for she had nothing to fear. 



261 

â€” " But how, in the name of fortin, my 
lass," cried he, " did you come to be by your- 
self in such an unked place at this hour?" 

Emily, trying to collect herself, briefly 
informed him, that is, she said she had 

been to O ; and wishing to return the 

shortest way to Copsely, had entered the 
wood, and lost herself. 

" Dang it, and no wonder, if not well 
acquainted with it, at such an hour; nor 
that you should have been so cruel fright- 
ened, when you found yourself astray. 
But come, my lass, take my arm, and 
I'll see, when I get home, if I can't get 
some one to see thee safe to thine, for I 
am so cruel tired myself, after a hard day's 
work, I am not able, else I shouldn't 
make much of doing so, though," laugh- 
ing, *' I am not a bachelor." 

A few minutes brought them to his 
comfortable dwelling ; they found his wife 
sitting by herself, evidently dressed in her 
best, and busily employed ornamenting a 
stiff muslin cap with innumerable bows of 
poppy-coloured ribbon. 



262 

Laughing heartily at the look she gave, 
at seeing him so accompanied â€” " Well, 
dame," the farmer cried, " thee seest I've 
not been out wooding to-night for no- 
thing." 

" Lauk-a-mercy ! who be this young 
lady, Jacob?" demanded the astonished 
wife. 

" Who be she !" and after trifling a 
little longer with her curiosity, he pro- 
ceeded to inform her. 

" Well, lauk-a-mercy !" was again her 
exclamation, with uplifted hands, and 
eyes expressive of terror, after she had 
listened to him â€” " Why, I do wonder, 
Miss, instead of sounding, you didn't die 
outright. I wouldn't take a king's ran- 
som, not I, to go to these here woods by 
myself at night, though my master here 
don't mind it a bit, not he." 

" Pooh ! why should I ? But, come, 
stir about, misses, and give us some'at to 
take. A drop of hot elder wine will be 
comfortable after our fright." 

The wine was directly got. While 



263 

mulling it â€” " Well, to be sure, Jacob, I 
thought, for certain, you would never 
come back to-night," said his wife ; " for 
Mrs. Boniface has asked me over to have 
a peep at the fine folks in the ball-room ; 
and I couldn't go till you came back, the 
men being all gone home, and Bet to see 
her sick mother." 

" Dang it, that he's unlucky, for I 
wanted one of the lads to see Miss here 
home." 

" Oh, that be a thing unpossible to- 
night, they are all a-bed by this ; but in 
the morning you beest going, you know, 
early to Dorkin, and you can take her 
with you, and drop her, by the way, at 
Copsely." 

This was an arrangement, however, 
Emily could not by any means approve; 
in spite of her unwillingness, however, 
she was forced to submit to it; there was 
no alternative; she could not possibly 
think of venturing back to Copsely by 
herself; and to get any one to see her 
there was out of the question. Tears of 



264 

absolute passion burst from her at the pre- 
dicament in which she found herself; but 
there was no use bewailing it to strangers ; 
and she at length consented to be shewn 
to a bedchamber, by the impatient, though 
good-natured Mrs. Blackthorn. 

Without undressing, she threw her ex- 
hausted frame on the bed, but sleep closed 
not her eyelids ; her mind was all distrac- 
tion and resentment, shame and confusion; 
she saw it was impossible to have what 
had passed concealed from the O'Bradys, 
and she shrunk from the thought of their 
comments on it. 

But her dread of these, their jeers, and 
gibes, and sarcastic observations, was not 
her acutest cause of agony ; still more gall- 
ing, more insupportable, was the idea of 
the dupe she had been to her own vanity, 
the wound her pride had received, in find- 
ing her high pretensions were not quite 
as loftily estimated by others as she had 
imagined; for if they had, would the duke 
have meditated such an injury as be had 
intended ? No â€” and she winced at the 



265 

thought, and felt more indignant with 
him, perhaps, for being the occasion of 
mortification to her pride, than from any- 
other cause. But he should not humble 
her; no, it was not because he did not 
exactly know the consequence she was of, 
that she should lower her pretensions ; and 
assuredly it must be owing to some mis- 
conception of this, some doubt, some du- 
biousness, that he had acted as he had 
done â€” Yes, no doubt, to some fear, some 
surmise; it was not, as was represented, 
owing to her being the inmate of such be- 
ings as the O'Bradys ; the belief brought 
comfort and consolation along with it. 

But as she dismounted, the next morn- 
ing, from farmer Blackthorn's chaise-cart, 
at the entrance of Copsely, all her inquie- 
tude and dismay returned, and she had 
scarcely power to proceed to the house, 
which, by this time, was all in commo- 
tion, from her having been missed, and 
Phillis compelled to tell the truth. 

Just as she entered, Mr. O'Brady was 

VOL. II. N 



266 

about sallying out in quest of her. â€” " So, 
Miss St. Orme," with a countenance pale 
with rage, he cried, " so you've had a 
fine freak of it." 

The spirits of Emily were too com- 
pletely overcome to enable her to bear 
any attack, and, sinking on a chair, she 
burst into an hysterical passion of tears. 

But we shall not dwell on the scene 
that followed ; suffice, Mr. O'Brady swore, 
by the blood of their illustrious ancestors, 
that, but for the injury it might be to her 
to give publicity to the affair, he would 
make the duke pay dearly for his conduct ; 
and that after what had happened, he 
could not think of allowing her to remain 
any longer at Copsely. 

Emily oould scarcely support herself at 
this declaration ; her nearly-exhausted 
purse had as yet received no reimburse-* 
ment, and till it had, a removal from his 
house must be attended with very serious 
inconvenience; but to acknowledge this â€” 
to honour a place she bad taken so littte 
pains to disguise her despising, by ex- 



267 

pressing a wish for a longer continuance 
in it, no, that was a humiUation her proud 
spirit could not submit to: besides, to do 
so would be to betray what she had care- 
fully guarded, and felt she would rather 
die than have known the change which 
had taken place in INIr. Elmore's prospects ; 
she therefore, though almost sinking with 
dismay at the thought, expressed her rea- 
diness to depart immediately. 

" There will be coaches passing in the 
course of the morning," returned Mr. 
O'Brady ; " so the sooner you begin pack- 
ing, the better, JNliss St. Orme ; for after 
what has passed, I shall not be at peace 
till I see you safely out of this." 

Emily hemmed, and coughed, and rose, 
and hesitated, and then, despite of her af- 
fected airs of independence, falteringly 
asked Mrs. O'Brady if she knew of any 
boarding-house in town, where she could 
be accommodated for a short time â€” yes, a 
very short time â€” just till some friends she 
wished to be with arrived from the coun- 
try. 

N 2 



268 

" Boarding-house !" repeated INIrs. O'Bra- 
dy. " I don't think, my dear," turning 
to her husband, " but that the house where 
you and I were boarding, in SaHsbury- 
court, before we were married, would do 
for Miss St. Orme. There's always a very 
decentish, indeed rather smartish set of 
young men there; and Mrs. Moffat keeps 
a very good table; you are always sure of 
a hot joint there every day, with generally 
a bit of fish, and a toss up or two." 

" Pshaw, INIrs. OBrady ! how often 
have I told you not to be speaking of your 
hot joints ! 'tis monstrous ill-bred and vul- 
gar of you. But all my good advice is 
thrown away; you'll never know what 
the etiquette of the thing is, or polite 
breeding, till I take you over to Ireland ; 
and then to be introducing Miss St. Orme 
to a set of Cockney clerks â€” arrah, woman, 
but your knowing no better must excuse 
you !" 

" Oh, as to that, my dear, if you talk 
of polite breeding, it's not from you, I am 
sure, 111 learn it, for you are as rude as a 



269 

bear; but I see what you want; you want 
to have an excuse for going up to town 
yourself with Miss St. Orme ; but you 
shan't. You'd say, as usual, I know, it 
would only be for a day; but your day 
would turn out seven. INIy cousins, the 
Tibbses, will be passing through this to- 
day, in their way up from Worthing to 
London ; and, to oblige me, I know they'll 
take care of Miss St. Orme so far, and 
even let her stop with them till she can 
accommodate herself elsewhere." 

The Tibbses were an elderly couple, 
with two grown-up daughters, and keep- 
ing a grocer's shop in Fleet-street; and 
with their name Emily was perfectly fa- 
miliar, from Mrs. O'Brady's frequent boast 
of the relationship. 

But a day back, and what fire would 
have flashed from her eyes at the idea of 
an introduction to such people! â€” a dealer 
in figs and sugarcandy, with a white apron 
on, behind a counter in London ; but nov/, 
such was the terror of her situation, that 
she gladly caught at it. Hitherto accus- 



270 

tomed to have every difficulty removed 
for her â€” to have people to think for her 
and act for her, and take all care and trou- 
ble off her, she absolutely trembled with 
dismay at the thoughts of encountering 
what was before her by herself 

The little grocer and his wife were 
punctual to the day they had fixed for 
coming up. Mrs. O'Brady was on the 
watch for tliem, at the inn where the 
coach stopped to change horses, and soon 
settled what she wished with them. Emi- 
ly v/as sent for, introduced to them, and 
very kindly assured, she should be wel- 
come to remain with them as long as she 
pleased. 

Emily, w^ith her unsubdued air of kau- 
teur, bowed her thanks for this friendly 
assurance ; it was the only way in which 
she could bring herself to express them to 
beings she considered as almost a distinct 
species with herself â€” beings to whom no- 
thing but the most awkv/ard, most dis- 
tressing predicament could possibly have 
allowed her to submit to the horrors of an 



271 

introduction. But as it was the first, so 
she trusted it would be the last time in 
which she should be compelled to submit 
to any thing so revolting; and, in the 
meanwhile, she hoped, whilst forced to 
remain their guest, she should be able, by 
the coldness and stately reserve of her 
manner, to keep them at an awful dis- 
tance, and impress them with a due sense 
of the honour she did them in accepting 
an obligation from them. 

Totally unsuspicious of the light in 
which she regarded them, the little, fat, 
kind-hearted grocer, and his equally good- 
natured and good-humoured wife, did all 
in their power to make her feel comfort- 
able on her taking her seat beside them. 
Comfortable ! she deemed the word odious, 
from the ideas of snugness it suggested to 
the imagination. Besides, to be comfort- 
able, the sixth in a stage-coach, wedged 
in amongst beings such as she had always 
had an absolute horror of coming in con- 
tact with ! Heavens ! the idea was ridi^ 
culous! and leaning back, she neither 



272 

spoke, nor stirred, nor seemed to notice 
any thing. 

Having tucked in her petticoats, and 
compressed, as much as possible, the well- 
stufFed pannier by her side. â€” " I hope I 
don't squeege you much, my dear," cried 
Mrs. Tibbs ; " but indeed to help doing 
so a little is unpossible. I always think," 
she added, speaking generally, and laugh- 
ing aloud, " that elderly folks look all the 
better for being a little jolly. But then, 
to be sure, when one is travelling, it would 
be conwenient enough to be slim like Miss 
here." 

" Aye, aye, so it would," assented an- 
other of the passengers, an elderly man, 
evidently born within the sound of Bow- 
bell. " Wery conwenient indeed if they 
could chop and change about, like the 
weasel in the fable; but I must say, they 
should certainly give us more elbow-room 
in these here coaches; as I says to my 
wife, says I, 'tis not always Pharorah's 
lean kine that is to fill them. But, bless 
your hearts ! you're all in clover to what I 



273 

was when I was going down to Worthing, 
three weeks agone, for business will never 
let me stop long; no, just a dip, as I may- 
say, and then off again. Why, we had 
not less than nine insides." 

" Nine !" repeated j\Irs. Tibbs, almost 
gasping at the idea, and wiping her face; 
" lauk-a-mercy ! that was being stived up 
indeed !" 

" Aye, you may say indeed; not less 
than nine, and some of them not the small- 
est; six full-grown-up people, two chil- 
dren, and a pug-dog; as fat as my lord 
mayor's fool." 

" Oh, well, come," cried Mrs. Tibbs, 
" the pug couldn't be reckoned one." 

" No ! Faith, then, they had her down 
in the way-bill as one ; and a troublesome 
one too, I promise you, she was; now up 
in her mistress's lap, then down, fidget- 
ting in the straw amongst us, while, if 
any touched her, she had a snap at them 
in a moment." 

" Aye, monstrous disagreeable indeed," 
said i\Irs. Tibbs. " As I say, I like these 
n3 



274 

poor little beastes of dumb creatures very- 
well in their way, but not by no means in 
a carriage. And as to these here pugs, I 
am always in a kind of taking when I am 
in company with them, for they keep 
such a wheezing and sneezing, that it al- 
ways makes me think, poor little dears ! 
that they have got a cold in their heads, 
which I know to be one of the most dis- 
tressing things in nature." 

" Ay, so it is, ma'am," assented a fat, 
elderly woman ; " and it is to harden me 
against any thing of the kind, I always 
makes a point of giving myself a dip or 
two in the salt vater every season; for, as 
I says, what's the use of tailing and moil- 
ing, and scraping up money, if one hasn't 
no health to enjoy it?" 

*'' To be sure, ma'iam, no more it isn't," 
eried Mrs. Tibbsr " and it's on that ac- 
count my good man and I gives ourselves 
tl>e recreation of going every season, for a 
few veeks, to Worthing ; and a charming 
place it iÂ«, ma'aiÂ»; as 1 say, those who 
dont like it can't have no taste at all ; 



275 

for nothink can come up to the South 
Down mutton ; and then the fish jumping 
alive in the basket; for my part, it does 
so vascinate me, I don't know how to 
leave it. But turn about is fair play ; for 
till we have had our pleasure, the young 
uns at home, our dorters, couldn't haven't 
have theirs; and, God bless their little 
hearts ! if they were long kept out of it, 
they would so pout and so fret!" 

" Ay, ay, no doubt," returned the 
Cockney; " young ladies be generally 
pretty humoursome till they get married, 
ban't they. Miss?" addressing himself to 
Emily. 

" Miss ban't well, I'm afeard," said Mrs. 
Tibbs, finding she did not answerâ€”" ban't 
you, my dear? But when you gets to 
Ashted, and rests yourself a bit, and eats 
a morsel of dinner, you'll find yourself 
better." 

" Ay, so she will, ma'am," said the 
other female passenger ; " a bit of dinner al- 
ways does one good ; and very good din- 
ners they gives on this here road." 



276 

In this way they got on till they reach- 
ed Ashted ; when, oh, the consternation, 
the dismay, the confusion of Emily ! A 
large party of gentlemen, on their way to 

the races at , were loitering about 

the inn, while dinner was preparing for 
them, and to be seen by them was horri- 
fying. It is true she knew none of them; 
but that might not be the case after she 
had once made her debut in fashionable 
life ; and to be recognized by men of such 
superior consequence as their equipages 
announced them, as a person whom they 
had seen stepping out of such a vehicle as 
a stage-coach, was insupportable to her 
â€¢imagination. â€” " No, I cannotâ€” I will not 
get out !" she exclaimed to Mrs. Tibbs, 
who, on finding she did not follow her, 
turned round to see what prevented her. 
â€” "Not get out, my dear!" cried Mrs. 
Tibbs, in a tone of surprise ; " why, sure 
^ou ban't thinking of going on to London 
-without no dinner. I promise you, you 
-will get something hot and comfortable 
here; so do get out, my dear, and have a 



277 

bit ; it will be eight o'clock full before we 
get to town, and it would be enough to 
make any one sick to fast till then." 

Thus teazed, or rather fearing, by the 
persistence of Mrs. Tibbs in arguing the 
point, that the very observation she wisli- 
ed to avoid would be drawn on her, Emi- 
ly at last reluctantly consented to alight, 
but not till she had first drawn her bonnet 
farther over her face, and ascertained that 
the attention of the party was diverted 
from her at the moment, by a race that 
had just commenced between two pigs, 
for some decayed apples that were thrown 
out of a neighbouring cottage. But though 
she entered the parlour, nothing could in- 
duce her to make one of the party at din- 
ner. As far as possible she seated herself 
away from it, trusting, by so doing, if 
any one came in, she should not be sup- 
posed to belong to it. 

A few minutes after, as sir Herbert 
Euston, one of the party, whose notice 
she had wished to avoid, was sauntering 
past the window, he had a glimpse of her. 



278 

and almost instantly after turned into the 
house, and entered the parlour. 

He was by no means deficient in fa- 
shionable assurance. Approaching her, 
he expressed his hope that he did not in- 
trude in her particular part of the room, 
as he wished to remain there for some of 
his friends. 

Emily bowed; she saw clearly this was 
pretended, in order to have a pretext for 
introducing himself to her, but she could 
not be displeased with what was flattering 
to her vanity. A desultory conversation 
ensued; the usual topics between stran- 
gers were discussed, accompanied with 
looks from the gentleman that agreeably 
flattered the lady. Had she previously 
doubted his not imagining her belonging 
to the party at the table, his at length be- 
ginning to laugh at them would have im- 
pressed her with the conviction. She af- 
fected to join in the laugh ; but when she 
reflected that he might stay long enough 
to discover how misplaced it was in her, 
she heartily repented having exposed her- 



279 

self to the derision that must follow such 
a discovery. Sickening at the thought, 
she suddenly drew back with an altered 
manner ; but in vain she strove to shew it 
was no longer agreeable to her his remain- 
ing there; he continued, and every mo- 
ment she became more miserable at the 
idea of what she had apprehended. 

She had not feared without cause. Mrs. 
Tibbs having finished her dinner, sudden- 
ly rose from table, and approached the 
window near which she was sitting with 
a glass of negus in her hand. â€” " Thankee, 
sir, thankee!" she cried, as the elegant 
stranger, with something bordering on a 
look of horror, drew a little aside at her 
approach. " Don't let me disturb you; I 
only just wants to cool myself a bit at the 
winder before I gets into the coach again, 
for 'tis monstrous hot," wiping her face as 
she spoke, with a handkerchief that bore 
evident marks of her having used it as a 
napkin at table. " But, lauk-a-mercy, my 
dear!" addressing herself to the almost- 
sinking Emily, who would have been sa- 



280 

tisfied to have been wedged like an offend- 
ing sylph in the eye of a bodkin, to have 
escaped the mortification of the moment, 
" I am so wexed you didn't eat a bit of 
dinner ; I am so terribly afeared you'll be 
sick fasting, before we reaches town ; not, 
to be sure, but that if you feel qualmish, 
we can get you a biscuit at Epsom or 
Ewell, but you'd have had something com- 
fortable here ; but, to be sure, I'm mon- 
strous fond of ribs of lamb and grass ; we 
always makes a point of going every sea- 
son to Battersea, to have one good feast 
of it there. But your health, my dear ; 
and, sir," nodding to the baronet, " my 
good sarvice to you. 'Pon my word, they 
have made this here negus very good ! Do 
take a sup, my dear," offering the tumbler 
to Emily, just after taking it from her 
own lips. 

With recoiling disgust, Emily turned 
away from her, and at the same moment 
the passengers were summoned to the 
coach. Anxious to escape as soon as pos- 
sible from such a scene of mortification. 



281 

Emily hastily rose to obey it. But not 
in the manner she wished would sir Her- 
bert allow her to leave him ; seizing her 
hand, in a very altered tone he entreated 
to know where he could see her in town, 
adding, he should be miserable if they 
parted without her telling him. 

Forcing away her hand, Emily scorn- 
fully pushed him aside, and hurrying af- 
ter Mrs. Tibbs, was in a moment in the 
coach. It may readily be believed this 
incident did not tend to render her more 
agreeable; she had scarcely ever indeed 
been more mortified, and scarcely ever 
did she wish more earnestly for any thing 
than that she might never encounter sir 
Herbert again. 

In due time the coach arrived at the 
Elephant and Castle, w^here, for a moment, 
her senses became absolutely bewildered 
by the scene of noise and confusion she 
there became witness to. 

Relieved from the terror imparted by 
this, she could not help, as she found her- 
â€¢self quietly proceeding along Blackfriars- 



282 

road towards Fleet-street, and looked 
about her, and listened to her companions, 
sighing, to think that in such a way, un- 
der such auspices, should be her first in- 
troduction to this grand emporium of the 
empire â€” this seat of regal splendour, and 
of taste, and elegance, and magnificence â€” 
London. But it was no consequence; 
she should not long be constrained to re- 
main in a situation so recoiling to her feel- 
ings, and, in the meanwhile, none need 
know the mortifying circumstance but 
herself

But the Marquis and tha Chevalier were averle from that courfe, as they «ireaded the poffibihty of an encounter with Julian, who had fled towards thofe patts Julian's proft-lfion ot km dred to Claudio, had diminiilietl m the latter that poignant horror, which pof-

Ihe Cavalier's private wifhes to pafs over Switzerland, endued his recom¬ mendations with fuch energy, that hit timorous opponents were redargued ; and Cr.nilla's componile in difcuduig a meafure they fo much feared, foamed them to a compliance. Accordingly preparations for a mountainoiu journey were immediately agitated.

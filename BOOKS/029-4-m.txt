and mildew. They feemed more imme¬ diately to relate to Rofaline, after the dread¬ ful tranfadions and difcoveries of the laft chapter. When they became more legible, they pertained to Paulina, and thus went on. It feemed that Rudolph, uftirping Baron of Ednioadyill*, had, in his latter hours of Jife, felt the flings of an upbraiding con¬ fcience ; and as ihe enormity of his crimes appeared in all the horrors of a guilty foul ^oalaim his fears, and awaken him to a fenfe of his treachery and barbarity, he washeaid to lament deeply the injuries and forrows he had inflided on his brother, whom to redrefs and ..reflore to his long defpoiled inheritance, became the peculiar villi of his heart; and ftrange though * OS it fcemtd, as the ulurper became more ] enitent for his unnatusal deeds, his daughter's rancorous hatred againft her wronged uncle ine tea fed ; and thofe early feeds of mi!chief and cruelty, which himfelf had early implanted in her mind, grew with her years, and became too firm in a har¬ dened
tlened foil to be ever after eradicated, where ambirion and power were the only ruling qualities of her difpofition. She had, fiom infancy, been taught to confi ier herfelf as born to the fplendours of illuftrious greatnefs; and it became fo habitual to her nature, that to maintain her power, and fecure its continuance, no facrifice was thought too great, no difficulty fo entirety infurmountable, that perfeverance might not in time overcome; and when h} confi¬ dence her father informed lief how totter¬ ing and unfounded were her hopes, how unjuft her claims to the inheritance of Ed¬ mondville,'(lie peremptorily refufed to relin- q ui th her i i 0 h t, nor would con lent to acknow¬ ledge any other than herfelf as heireis to their poileflion. The foul of Helen Paulina, for fo (lie was in reality entitled (though the former name had, from the haughtinefs of her nature, 1rcen funk on her father's accefiion to the fuperior title of Earl of Othin) was afpiring, n ii flexible,
inflexible, and daring; and her heart was asdmperious as the high fortunes of her fate were fuperior to her merits. But when in¬ formed that her father really meant to reftore tb their rightful mafter his fraudulently gained poffeflions, her rage, though it dared not openly fliew itfelf, was, if poffible, more dreadful, becaufe concealed; and the ef¬ forts of the Earl to difcover his brother were perhaps rendered ftill more unfuccefsful, from her fecret counteractions of his defigns. Some unguarded expreflions of Philip, who was, though faithful to an rmpious mafter, a real friend to the oppreffed Lord Alfred, re¬ lating to liis knowledge of the latter, Paulina was made acquainted with, who, on a pre¬ tended fufpicion of difaffection, fucceeded in obtaining his baniihment from the Caftie of Edmondville ; and hence it was that Philip was deprived of knowi g the true defigns of the Earlof pthin, which might perhaps have faved Sir Alfred's life to a longer peiiod, and fecured Rofaline from the fu¬ ture perfections of the remorfelefs Paulina $ who,
who, with unfdtal joy, received the news of her father's illnefs, and approaching death. She had long trembled for the confequences of the purfuit, that, fliould it prove other- wife than fruitlefs, muft, if her father iivui, compel her to refign the grandeur of hcr f unn lawful inheritance, but whicii, on his decease, fhe,niight ftill deceive the world, and ft.11, by pneftretch of arbitraly power, retain. Rudolph, in his lateft moments, ftrongly enjoined Paulina to ftnilh the fearch he had fo unfuccefsfuily be^un, aud reftore to his wionged brother ihj only means of reparation in his power now to make Irin, folemnly conjuring her, as ihe valued his future peace, as well as her own, to enter a houfe of religious penitents ; where, by the pious devotion of herfelf, the guih and vio* lent outrage of her own birth might be atoned, as well as the crioies of her fa* ther's mifpent life, by the felf-iacnfiec ofhis daughter, find mercy and forgivcnefs\
b 3 Rudolph
Rudolph died foon after, in all the torture of a mind long overcharged with crimes, and agonized by the recolledion that his inhuman cruelty to a brother, who had not, in the fliphteft degree, injured him, could never, durirg his life, be repaired; and what would be his future fate he fhuddered to ponder on. The fearch that had been made for the wronged Lord Alfred, during his brother's life, was fuccefslefs; and Rudolph died in the pmiic vt \m t'»av'?» with crdy z fhott re* pen tance, whilft his treachery and ingratitude went unatoned with himfelf to the grave; for Paulina ordered home thofe mifBoo- aries fent on the fearch of her uncle, refolved that her father muft himfcif be anfwerable for his own mifdeeds, fince in her ambi¬ tious, haughty bofom no pious fentiments arofe to prompt her to the fulfilment ofhis commands or his injundions; whilft the magnificence and fplendour in whicii flie had been educated, taught her to*exped, as her right,
right, an inheritance* that fhe was refolved never to refign, whilft the power of retain¬ ing it was now foleiy vefted in herfe!f: and fchemes of violence, oppreffiori, and d m- ger entered her thoughts, for the further fecurity of thefe ill-gotten poffeffions from every poflibi.ity of a chance of being hereafter deprived of them, With a mind that had naturally acquired a habit of thinking for herfelf, Lady Paulina became, from tlie hour of her father's dif¬ covery, r^ferved and diftant of man* ners* and fpeech;—the gay and buoyant de¬ lights of happy youtii fled from a heart where corrofive care alone retained a feat; and after fhe had arrived at the age of fixteen, flie was feldom feen to fmile, nor did the gleam of fudden unexpeded joy ever brighten her gloomy countenance. Her- whole thoughts, bent on one objed alone, rendered the touch of pleafure a ftranger to -her foul, which was employed in tne fecret formation of plans for her own ilcurity, E 4 that
that fo flic might render abortive the wifhes and endeavours of her father, to do at length an ad of juftice and reparation for the guilty horrors ofhis crime-ftained adions. ' With a mind naturally haughty, imperious, and inexorable, it now became fevere, and af¬ fumed a charader that threatened the fafety of thofe fhe fo much dreaded; whom ta remove from every future fear of moiefta- tion to herfelf, flie failed not io the exertion of every effort of her prolific brain, which teemed only vvith milchiefs ruinous and deadly, to get the wronged fulferers into her power, For the lovely Matilda flie had imbibed an implacable averfion ere fhe few her ; but when in Rofaline St* Ofwythe flie was* fated to find the objed of her fears, and the fiic- cefsful rival of her love, then it was that the long'fmothercd paffion of inceffant hatred overbore *evexy oppofing fentiment of pity or remorfe ; and to deftroy a being fo doubly a caufe of abhorrence and appre- henfion*
henfion, became th@ conftant fubjcct of her deepeft meditations, well-affwred, from every collected circumftance, as well as the title which Lord. Alfred had affumed, together with his private manner of living on the domains of her mother, that he was the in¬ jured uncle fhe had fb long been in fearch of. Paulina debated with herfelf in what manner flie fhould proceed in her dreadful defigns upon his liberty and life 5. and for fome time after her arrival at the Caftie of Urbandine, fhe employed herfelf in the dif¬ ficult tafk of ftudying minutely the cha¬ racter of Otho/whkh, after a ftrong fcrutiny, fhe fancied was fuch as would lull her pur¬ pofes ; a^nd when flie fliould once have fe¬ cured the afliftance >of a mind fo congenial to her own, (he reflected that, Ihould fhe marry either Gondemar or Conftantine, it would then become the intereft of tlieir father to conjoin with herfelf in mutual endeavours to extirpate a rival fb doubly dangerous to his expected hopes in the aggrandizement of his own confequence and b 5 fortunes s
fo.owcs, by an alliance of his fon with her¬ felf. Having well weighed thefe thoughts in her mind, as well alfo'as the ur¬ gent neceffity of poffefiing the approv¬ ing concurrence of a Noble of fuch power and intereft s whofe friendfliip would fupport her pretenfions, and fcreen the enormity of her guilt from the meddling landers of the prying\vorld, flie at length, under binding refiridions, acquainted the Biron vvith her real fituation, at the fime time alluring him that her eledioii in the choice of one ofhis fons for the partner of her future life, refted foleiy on Conftantine. Otho, the fubt'e, unfathomable Lord of Caftlenuco, liftened, with inward amaze¬ ment, to this ftrange, unthought-of con- feffion. His behaviour, however, to Paulina fuffered no diminution in courtefy arid re- fped ; nor did he-fail, witn the infinuating plau Ability of his charader, to affure her of his readinefs .to aid her caufe :-~but 0<* o had not vieived, unmoved, the refiftlefs beauties of the wronged orphan , and when afterwards
afterwards he found thac Paulina's wealth and patrimony would not fwtll the ftrtutie's of tbe Houfes of Urbaridine and CaftIe:iuco by her marriage with Condantinc, which tbe latter had rejected* he brgan to waver wlie- ther he fliottfd receive-as a daughter a being, whOj by her own atknowledgment # was the ■ufurper'of another's rights, of whicii there was at leaft a probability the would one day bt deprived* .'He ilill, however, contioued to keep up an out ward decep'tive. femblance of fiietidihtp with Paulina! whofe never flumbering jeaiouiy and fears kept her fron> obferving the vifible change m the itianners of the Baron » and they Hill con¬ tinued at midnight to meet in the library of the Caftte, to plot Ireih fchemrs of mif- chief for the rum of the innocent Rofaline, which, as the Baron feemin-ijv gave into. Iris deception was not at firit dtfeovered, though Iris love for Rolalinc led hin to counter €t» in fecret,. the plots and de%ns of Pauhaa for herdeilrucVion. Thefudden but.. Jailing paflion- the Baron had felt for b 6 Rofaiine*
Rofaline, eveu before his knowledge of whom flie really was, had proved her fafe- guard from the machinations of Paulina.—« It ha* been, feen wich what refined artifice he had deceived her generous mind, and obtained a cruel confent* to forego for ever her hopes of Conftantine—a promife that, in¬ fpired by his Ovvn felfifh wifhes,die was re-^ folved to gain, and on which refted his future hopes of fuccefs, It is even poffible that, had fhe not been the objed ofhis own paf¬ fion and deepeft regards, he would (after the difcovery of her birth) have accorded his approbation of Conftan tine's choice of Ro-* feline for his future bride; particularly as . ftie was heirefs of immenfe wealth and Lord- fhips, that, from the confeffions of Paulina, he knew might eafily be regained :—but Rofaline's too fafcinating charms he had reierved for his own pofreffion, regardlefs of the mifery he fhould entail upon his fon t or the cruelty and injuftice of his condud to an illuftrious woman, not only unexception¬ able in high birth, but equally fo in the endowments
endowments of her perfon, as well as the virtuous perfections of her mind. His deep-laid fnares, however, were not yet in train for execution, nor did he fcruple to make Paulina and her defigns neceffary inftruments of his own plans;—• for fince (lie would ftill retain the poflef- fions of Othin after thofe of Edmond¬ ville were reftored to their legal heirefs, he refolved, more eagerly than ever, to en¬ force her unipn vvith Lord Urbandine, as the firft and only promifing profpect of fuccefe in his own with Rofaline, whofe pliable and yielding difpofition of foul he vainly hoped would piove, in the end, fa¬ vourable to his wiflies. Flufhed with ex- ultingtriumph at the increafe of power and honour which his fucceffes in the late war? had gained him, he became impatient for the attainment of his ruthlefs purpofe?, although he coulc* not but tremble for the near chance of their total fruftration, in the fecret union fo nearly concluded between his
his fon and Rofaline. The fu Iden difap¬ pearance of the former, and the lon^ con¬ tinuance of hi> fuppofed abfence, were fa¬ vourable to his plots -, whilft the fhort re¬ moval of Paulina alfo from the Caftie gave additional fecurity to their profperous ter¬ mination, and was too fortunate to be re¬ gretted. The indignity of Ruithvina*s trial oad proved, contrary to his expectation, a clxck to his own growing ambition; and- the difgrace of that action recoiled in dif¬ appointment on-hirnfe f ilbce the dignified purity of the character of tho Baronets fe¬ cured'her from the effects-of her Lord's calumnies 5 and the poAer of Holy Church withheld from his eager grafp the fortunes ofRuiihvina, in whom alone was vefted the right of their difpofal,. till they became the inheritance of her fon. This lofs, how¬ ever, Otho knew he fliould amply fupply in his union with the real heijef* of Edmund- ville, whofe poffeflions he meant fo appro* prute entirely to himfelf. A viciou>paf» fion had firft infpired his mind vvith guilty wifhes $
wifhes i but the knowledge he afterwards obtained of the fortunes of its objed, Don converted that love into an honourable re¬ folution to make both them, as weil as the perfcn who inherited them, a part of him* felf j and hem earofe thofe deep-laid fchemes, and dangerous trials in which the unfufped- ing Rofaline had been involved. The daring foul of Otho, veiled in a deceptive mdk infcrutable to wor'diy comprehenfion, was but too capable of ads of injuftice and ini¬ quity ; nor was the long ftudied, well-con* Cealed artifice of his charader expofed to the view of his deflined vidinis, till, enfnarcd in hk treacherous devices, they were beyond the power cf aid, redrefs, or efcape $ nor was it till too late to amend or prevent their confequentes, tliat Paulina at length dif¬ covered, and deeply regretted, hermifplaced confidence in tlie Baton j—and tremblingly alarn ed for the fate ot her kcret, lhe hur¬ ried back to Uk Caftie, upon the receipt of the infotmatii ii which her fpies, w l cm fhe had placed over the adions of Otho, gave her
her of his intended union with Rofaline, hoping tbat, by her prefence, (lie fliould awe the Baron from his purpofes till fome means were found to fruUrate them en¬ tirely. The Caftie, at once the &at of war and luxury, was but ill calculated for tlie refi-* dence of Paulina in the abfence of its in* jured miftrcfs ; for it now became a place c>f 'unreftrained lieentioufnefs and diflblute voluptuoufnefs. Its midnight banquetings, ending in riotous caroufals, and difordered alarming difcords, received fecret encou* ragement fiom the Baron, whole clefignswere to roufe fhe pride of Paulina, in the ex¬ pectation that lhe would agam withdraw herfelf completely from the Caftie, where her preience now marred the completion of his defigns;—for though he had experienced the fevereft difappointment in the difcovery that Rofaline was of a firm and, in fome refpeds, unyielding temper, nor quite fo pliant as his wiflies wduld have found her * yet
yet fince he had ultimately refolved that no power fliould deprive him of their de¬ termined gratification, and fince alfo he was weil convinced that voluntarily flic never would become the Baronefs of Caftle¬ nuco, his only hope of accompli filing his purpofes refted on the arbitrary and defpo- tic power of his will, which the prefence of Paulina alone prevented the enforcement of; and by her remaining at the Caftie, proved, for afbort time, the fecurity of the doubie- deftined .vidim of both their perfecutors, whofe fchemes clafhed with their mutual interefts, and often counteradecl the defigns of each other. His intentions, in reducing Rofaline to a total dependance on himfelf, that no alternative might remain for her fafety, or means of exiftence, are too evident to need aYurther elucidation ; and ill was he prepared to experience, in his intended vidim, fiiv.h a noble, praifeworthy contempt of riches, at the facrifice oi fuch a purchafe, which muft have been procured by an adion that would diihouour for ever her name, with
with a ftain doubly oppmbrio is, and too dilgraceful ever to be cancelle 1. Befides, he was now taught how fuperior the mind ofa virtuous fcm.de could foar above the vain poffeffions of worldly grandeur, when procured at the expence of every feeiLig of delicacy, fendment, or refinement. Paulina had long fufpeded the difaffec¬ tion of the Bar *»n to her interefts;—her pene¬ tration at length enabled her to fee beyond the fine-fpun web of his artifices $ and when, on her demanding the refignation of Rofaline, the Baron refufed compliance, flie foon difcovered its caufe, and, in the fury of her firft ungoverned rage, formed feveral plans for the deftrudion of her hated rival, whom now more than ever flie re¬ folved to get fecietly into her own power; and as flie poffeffed ample and unbounded means of gratifying her moft unlimited wifhes, fhe foon piccured mercenaries fuited to her purpofe. Not an inftant was to be loft; the following day was, ihe had difcovered, deflined
deftined for the forced union of R/ faline with the Baron; and her own ufurping claim, by fuch an alliance, trembled on a rock, whofe power and ftrengn would crufli to atoms her now threatened bark, and ulti¬ mately deftroy herfelf in the perilous fliip- wreck, unlefs the objed that had r.iilcd the fudden ftorm was fpecdily removed from the magnet it had attraded. f An unhappy, or rather an over-ruling fate, drove the haplefs Rofaline from the power of one perfecutor to the hop^d-for refuge of the other; and in her own domains fhe endured the horrors ofa dungeon, where alone Nature and right had taught her to exped a flicker from every danger, as well as a kind proteding reception, with a fecure home. The Countefs no fooner became ac¬ quainted that Rofaline was the heirefs whofe prerogatives fhe ufurped, than entering the Abbey fecretly foon after the death of Sir Alfred,
Alfred, with a refolution to be, if poffible, convinced by ocular demonftration, Ihe had concealed hei felt in the ruins during the evening, whilft the avenues, were yet un- faflened; and as foon as all in the interior of the building became quiet, and the hour of midnight rendered her approaches fafe fiom difcovery, fhe ventured from her hid* ing place, and at length, after prowling about the galleries and chambers of the Abbey, when all its inmates were Si buried in profound repofe, flie difcovered, by the black trappings ftill remaining^ the chambers of her deceafed uncle, A large number of keys, that fhe had brought with her, foon enabled her to fit one to ,the lock ©f Sir Alfred's cabinet in the turret cham¬ ber j which on opening, flie there found fuf¬ ficient proofs to put beyond all doubt the conviction flie received, that the fuppofed St. Ofwythe was in reality the Baron of Edmondville. The papers contained mat- teis of the utmoft importance to Rofaline, and led to many dilcovenes. One among the
the reft was a particular defcription of the fecret department concealed in the wainfcot of the weft faloon, and was, in reality, the approach to the vaults, where was fecreted every teftimony of Lord All red's birth, as well as the hiftory of his wrongs and naif- fortunes. Paulina perufed fome few affeding paf- fages, that made her tremble, and for once feel that the awful hour of anticipated re¬ tribution had power to conjure up imagi¬ nary horrors, if not real ones, to terrify the guilty. She was about to deftroy all the papers;—but whether it was her confcience, or that fhe did in reality fee what fhe fan¬ cied* flie did, is uncertain ; but a fudden tre¬ mor fhook her frame, which, with the lone ftillnefs of the place, the melancholy latenefs of the hour, together with the upbraiding flings of that inward monitor of the heart, who will not filentiy acquiefce in an ad of injuftice and crime, pidured to her mental and corporeal fight, a pale white form, whofe
whofe, ghaftly countenance, caft in angry glances * oh her, alarmed her from her purpofes, and throwing her unfinished work into tlie cabinet from whence flie had taken them, flic hurried, with affrighted Ce* lerity, from the gloomy chambers, leaving the mutilated papers in the condition they were afterwards difcovered by Rofaline. Her confidant met her at the appointed rendezvous; but though of an un¬ daunted and courageous mind, and poffeff- ing the means to purfue ftill further her re- fearches for the papers of Sir Alfred in the vaults, (lie found no effort of intereft, how¬ ever preffing, could tempt her, after the late fpectacle fhe had feen, to enter thofe dreary * *» • regions | and certain that fhe had deftroyed every paper relative to their direction or dif* covery, as well as fecured the key of the re*> pofitory that guarded the myfterious records, from the poffibility of Rofaline's fearch, fhe refolved, for the prefent, to reft fatisfied with this fecurity, fince without thefe proofs flie
flie well knew the Baron of Caftlenuco could never make good any legal clai ns he might attempt to eftabliih in the behalf of Rofaline* Triumphing at length in the fuccefs of her deep-laid fchemes, fhe beheld them profper vvith an inward glov of fatisfadion, that for the laft two years of her life flie had been a ftranger to ; and Rofaline, deceived and betrayed, was hurried from one extreme of danger to be expofed to others more fure in their confequences, and direfully certain in their events; whilft the rage of Otho, in the lofs of a being he had regarded as his vidim, became unbounded and dreadful. Every domeftic in the Caftie was fufpeded, and underwent the ter¬ rible effeils of their Lord's difappoint¬ ment ; nor did even his guefts, efcape the general fury of his anger. One of the Knights in particular, from the open ex¬ preflions of his admiration of the beauties of Rofaline, whom he had feen on the night he entered the Abbey in feaah of Queen Margaret,
Margaret, fell under the ftrongeft fufpiciofis of the Baron, as being the caufe of her efcape from his power; and as foon as the latter was convinced that Rofaline was irrecover¬ ably loft, he, with impatient language, up¬ braided Sir Etheldred, the Knight fufpeded, in terms fo furious, that confequences the moft dreadful and fatal to both feemed to promife a very ferious refult. Sir Etheldred was a laird of Scotland, Whofe hot blood, and high-mettled bravery of foul difdained to brook, even in idea, the (lighted ilnr upon Irs character or honour, He was young, handfome, valorous, full of animated fpirit and pride, and, till the even¬ ing of their quarrel, the firm friend of the Baron j but the taint the latter had caft upon his fame, in a fufpicion of his faith, had occafioned, in his mind, the ftrongeft indignation, and the moft implacable re* fentment. He arofe from the banquet with a rage that lightened in his full dark eyes, and fiercely fpoke the anger of his thoughts for
for the injury he had received, which he was determined fliould not pafs un¬ atoned by the offender; and draw ng his fword, made a furious plunge at Otho, who, with calm colleded intereft, returned the ftroke, which, being the fignal of hof- tility, the hall loon filled with the clan of Sir Etheldred, as well as the warriors of the Baron, and a fcene of terror, confufion, and bloodfhed enfued* *t Sir Etheldred had, at the inftance of the Baron, brought with him from his caftie in -Scotland the dower of his tenants and re¬ tainers, to fight, in equal command with Otho, beneath the banners of the Houfe of York, who no fooner beheld the ftiifc be¬ tween their Chief and the Biron, than mill¬ ing into the banquet hall, they refolved ro defend and fupport their beloved Lord at the expence of theii lives; for tho numbers of the Baron were more than trebly fupe¬ rior to their own, whom the latter, in felt- defence, had been compelled to oppofe againft the imj atient fury of hi* opponent, vot. iv, o The
The wild contention raged to uproar** and Otho, feeing no hope of appealing iris gucft, fummoncd his people to the attack, and a defperate rencounter enfoed, which ceafed not till the hall, dreaming with blood, re¬ ceived its maddened Loal, who, vanquilhed by the fiery Scot, funk to the ground, over¬ come by the \alourbf his atlverfary. Sir Etheldred, in a moment, ceafid the bloody contention; and reftoring the fword of his now vanquilhed enemy, generoufly defifted from the advantage he might,have taken, but bade .him remember, from that moment, tlieir ancient friendlhip was at an end, and the field of battle ihould decide tleirprelent ftrife when next tiny met, in oppoiition to each other j then fummoning nearly all hi* people, for very few had fallen in the engagement, he indignantly quitted the Gallic, and haftened to prefent his fer¬ vices to the Royal llandard of Queen Mar¬ garet, as a fit revenge for the Baron's dere- lidion,
fiction, and a fmall atonement for the injury he had fu framed. Otho's wound, though trifling, was fuf¬ ficient to detain him from the purfuit of Sir Etheldred, whom he really fuppofed to be the caufe of Rofaline's efcape ; whilft on Paulina not even the flightefr fufpicion had fallen, who, having fent a munificent bribe to the warden of the terrace poftern, to en- fure his fecrecy, which, together with his own terror of the confequences of the Baron's rage, fliould he difcover tliat he had, though ur knowingly, aided the efcape of the Lady Rofaline, kept him filent on that tranfaction : nor aid the Baron ever difcover any thing to the con¬ trary | and thus the plots of Paulina were effected with fecurity and certii.ryj— whilft Otho imarted with indignation and difappointment at the total abolition ot his deep-laid fchemtrs, and now half repent¬ ed of the too haily anger he had ilievvn to his principal ally and friend, whofe c 2 withdrawn
withdrawn forces confiderahly thinned the garrifon, and weakened the ftrength of his army againft the attack the Caftie might fliortly exped; for the Lancaftrians had once more colleded all their powers^ and had lately gained many advantages over their enemy's advances $ fo much fo, that Urbandine's nearnefs to the feat of war made it again but too probable that Mar¬ garet would certainly avenge the late defeat of her forces, on a fortrefs fo hoftile to her caufe, and fo obnoxious to her feelings, from the implacable refentment fhe felt towards its traiterous Baron. Under fuch circum¬ ftances, therefore, the lofs of an hundred men, in a time of fuch expeded need, be¬ came a matter of ferious confequence to his own fecurity, and the fuccefs of the Duke of York's caufe j particularly as that princely Chief could now fpare no forces for the defence of Urbandine: and thofe "vho remainec daily became more dif¬ fatisfied with the tyranny of their com- mauler, whofe utmoft vigilance could fcarcely
fcarcely retain them in allegiance and lub- jedion. Repeated accounts of the fucceffes of the Lancaftrians now filled his mind with fe¬ rious alarms; for already had they gained two battles over the enemy, and were now on their march towards Ui band ine, which latter place Queen Margaret was refolved to reduce to allegiance. Things now wore a very different appearance j and even Otho began to tremble, whiift the continued abfence of both his fons filled his mind with fufpenfe and wonder. Paulina ftaid in the Caftie fome days after the difappearance of Rofaline, that her too foon withdrawing herlelf might not give the Baron caulc of fufpicion. At length, under pretence of leaving the Caftie, from her fear* of the con¬ fequences of the liege, that was Ihoitly ex¬ peded, flie took leave of her guardian, vvith a defign, as fhe exprefLd, of haflemng for fecurity to Edmondville Cattle $ but in reality flie went no further than the Abbey, c 3 t vvhiui
vvhich flie took pofTeffion of as a fit place for the execution of ber dark defigns,. where fhe knew flie could fhun detedion, and never occafion a fmgle veftige of the dread¬ ful deeds flie meant it fhould hide the com*- miflion of.—-Death \\$$ the allotted por* tion of her haplefs vidim ; and willing, if poffible;, to obliterate the recollcdion of the near connedion that fubfifted between.her¬ felf and the objed of her remorfelefs perfe* cutions, (lie would have allowed her no re* fpite from the completion of her cruel defigns, had not fome fudden ftarts of nature,. ftruggling with her favage intentions, made her fluduate in their execution, whilft a mo* mentary remembrance of the pale form fhe had feen in the chambers of Sir Alfred, now darted aTofs her heart, and confufed her defperate purpofes in a wild chaoi of fenfa¬ tions, that for a time turned the murderous, dagger from its deflined vidim, deep into the upbraiding foul of her intended murder¬ efs j and fome time longer was fuffered to pafs away in deep and fullen hefications* that

In an agitated, irrefolute ftate of. mind, fhe at length refolved to fearch the vaults for the fecret records of Lord Alfred, For this purpoie flie entered the recefs of their repofitory, attended by Agnes j and c 4 having

defpairing hope, to the door of her cap** tive*s prifon, which foftly opening, a: tide of ruthlefs unrelenting joy crofted her trembling foul, at finding that the in> jured fufferer was fafe in her chamber, and ftill in her power.

A fenfation.
A fenfotion that attended the fight of an event fo blading to every future hope, might welt have aroufed the dumb to utter an expreilion of the agonizing indignation of their feelings at fuch a moment ; and Rofaline in reality endured that indefciib- able anguitli and mifery of emotion which alone muft be truly felt to be underitood, but cannot juftly be detailed.

Their neareft . approach to the fouthern ruins was through the great Church of the monaftery, and by a fecret pafiage, known only to Agnes. Paulina
Paulina hurried through the dark paffages and vaulted ifles of the Abbey, which flie had taken entire pofteffion of, having long fince difmiffed the ancient domeftics of Rofaline, and now entered the great Church; while, as fhe paffed along, ten thoufand horrid ideas floated on her imagination, and made her again tremble with alarm and dread. Her fteps, the fteps of guilt and confofion, be» came unfteady ; and as flie walked down the middle aifle of thefe dreary manfions of the dead, her foot fuddenly flipped, and fhe fell * with a violence, that created a hollow found, tipon the pavement; when, as Agnes held her lamp ftill lower, to help the Lady Pauiina to rife, the latter, with fliuddering horror, read aloud, as her eyes were caft upon a black marble ftone— SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ALFRED LORD ST. OSWYTHE. She paufed, nor read again; and if the grave had fuddenly opened, and raifed to
to her view the ftlenU injured dead r to wake her into penitence and re* niorfe, it could not, for a moment, more powerfully have influenced her j—ihe trem¬ bled, paufed, became irrefolute; and con¬ fcience once more would have triumphed, had not Agnes been prefent. Paulina, filentiy pointing to the ftone, turned afide her head with fear and. horror * whilft Agnes, with a fmile of outward expreffed malice, whatever might be her mward feel* ings, thus ejaculated l— ** Thou knoweft, Paulina, I loved the living being, whofe inanimate form now lies in death beneath us j thou alfo knoweft he dared to injure, to refufe my offered affec¬ tions. Know alfo that were he now a*ive, and kneeling at my feet, my hand fliould plunge a dagger to his heart, in the death ofhis child, as a fit atonement for the un- appeafed wrongs I, through him, have fufr fercd." After a paufe, in which her eyes again loft ihe fiery flafhes that had, but the moment
moment before, illumined them, fhe took the arm of Paulina, and violently fhaking it, thus ftcrnly continued, as the frown of her brows increafed in their furious ex¬ preffion:—" Weak, undetermined lady, re¬ flect, fliould you idly fuffer your rival to exift, Conftantine is loft to you for ever, and Otho will reftore the idol of his love to the inheritance flie is heirefs of.'* " Enough !** replied Paulina firmly, the two laft confiderations overcoming every other fenfation but thofe they excited,-— * c Enough!" fhe repeated j " flie dies, and the grave of her father fhall foon become her laft refting-place,—Hark!——" Whether it was fancy, or the difmal hor* rors of the place, illumined now and then by the ftrong glare of the lightning piercing through the fliattered ivy-man* tied cafements, and all together con- fpiring with the evil of their own feel¬ ings and reflections, to add increa;e of hor¬ rors to the Unrounding ^loomj but t! ey both
both fancied they had heard a deep groaft near the fpot on which they flood. It was indeed a fcene that might truly Snlpirc them with ten thoufand horrible imaginings; as thus, vvith direful intents, they were ftealing to the performance of a deed of darknefs, which, but to think on in fuch a place as the defolate aides of the church, might well appal their fenfes with the delu* lions of fancy, M Let us quit this place,*' fearfully ex¬ claimed Paulina, hardly articulately, and hurrying forward. Agnes now quickly led her to one of the moil diftant pillars, at which (he flopped, and, to the amazement of Paulina, threw open a fmall narrow aperture, concealed from all obicrvance bv the fretwork. In the bulk of the circumference this fecret paffage had a narrow flight of fteps, ancl was evi¬ dently
ANCIENT RECORDS* 45 dently formerly a concealed communication with the fhrine of a celebrated long-buried Saint, fixed immediately in the arch under the pillar, and another adjoining in the body of the Church s and was doubtlefs the fecure means of practifing the frauds of prieftcraft upon the unfufpccling worihippers, who came to lay their pious offerings at the altar of the facred ilirine, as they viewed the mira¬ culous performances of its wonder-working virtues, nor knew that behind the fecret repofitory of the Saint, lay all the infpired charts that were^ achieved by living in- ftruments. This communication, which led to the fouthern angle, had been dif~ covered by Agnes during a former fearch among the ruins. A place, fo extraor¬ dinary and wonderful in its formation, ftfuck her as being Angularly uncom* mon; but the had too long been ufed to the impoftures of the Monks, to be in doubt as to the intent of its purpofes. Hither then ihe conducted Paulina, and after afcend-
ing fingly to the top, they reached the gal¬ lery rafters of the vaulted roof of the Church; and foon afier defcending a flight of flairs at a contrary end, entered the upper part of the fouth ruins, which led them to the door of the haplefs victi n's prifon. " Give me the key/' ejaculated Paulina, * £ and do you retire, and await my call ia the gallery." In filence flie received her demand, and, in the like manner, Agnes fullenly and haughtily retired. When alone*Paulina for a moment pauled, and liftened to the fighing of the wind, as it moaned through the dreary paffage?, and increafed to a loud blaft, as it apjtated ihe trees of the foreft, and fweot alon£ the tottering turrets of the ruins. Fa- tally bent on accomplifhing her unrelenting ckfign, flie at length quickly and filentiy fixed the key in the door, which (lowly creaked on its rufty hrige% and made her dart. Yes, thcpoweiful Paulina, the un¬ daunted,
daunted, immoveable, inexorable Helen hit the enervating influence of guilt, and trembled at the creaking of a door 1— Fearful that her light might awake her vic¬ tim if flie flept, flie ihaded it with her robe, as (lie entered, with gliding fteps, the dif- mal chamber. All within was filence pro¬ found, and pitchy darknefs, which were alone difturbed by the wind and lightning, as they forced their way through the bioken cracks and crevices of the boarded windows. The iLUboding bird of night fat fcreech- ing on the battlement of the prifon tower, whofe harfli diicordant note was echoed by the hoarfe croakings of the ominous raven. There is fomething fo awful in virtue, that its influence will inilinctively imprefs the mind of the evil deligner with fear and confcious unworthinefs in the prefence of its reprefentarive. Guilt is ever cowardly and appre hen five ; and Paulina, though de¬ termined to periorm her deadly intents, en¬ tered the chamber of death with a flow ilep and
and an involuntary inference flie was un¬ confcious of, though its influence now go¬ verned her approaches to the couch on which the innocent Rofaline lay reclined in a deep and heavy flumber i except that the image . of fome frightful vifion diftorted the fweet ferenity of her beauteous counte¬ nance, and her eyelids became moiftened with tears. Paulina, with fenfations wild and difor¬ dered, viewed the fleeping unconfcious ob* jedof her dreadful perfecutions. She drew forth her fatal weapon, as if the adion of grafping it could infpire her with increafed refolution. No power oppofed the fatal blow 5 no aid was nigh to fave the haplefs Rofaline ; the time, the place, and its entire fecurity all befriended her perfecutor. Rofa* line was herfelf unable to refift the ftroke,and lay profoundly fettered in the flumber of a trance, unconfcious of her danger. At
At length Paulinmmifed the fatal inftru- ment; but ere its horrid point had reached the bloody (heath, flie again became irrefQ- lute, and paufed. A faint cry broke from the lips of tlie trill fleeping Rofaline, whofe dreams feemed to portend her danger; for, in a torn of horror and diftreft, (lie ex¬ claimed aloud-— ** Forbear 1 Oh pity andTparc Hie !** Then (inking for a moment to an ahnofl deadly ftillnefs, (lie lay as a being quite de¬ prived of refpiration, till again her vifion became horrid, her features (welled to agony t>f expreffion, ihe flirieked aloud, and rifing Wildly On her knees, awoke—awoke to be¬ hold her vifion realized, and view tlie dag¬ ger's point of her murderefs about to enter her fnow-white bofom.—" Oh God'" the faintly and defpairingly ejaculated^ as the fudden horrible furprife of fuch ** moment 'deprived her of fortitude, a: ^ rendered her refiftlefs to the ftroke of t.cath- 4 -** Gh God 1 my vifionary prefacing picture is ful- vol. iv. i> filled!

Think, Oh think, whoa* it is you would

Till
Till this moment the accumulated^ guilt of her actions never had impreffively*(truck her daring foul with conviction of the rnonftrous crime tbe meditated s but now, for the firft time, flie remembered, as the laft fentence of Rofaline recalled its cer¬ tainty to her mind, that the fame mother that had borne herfelf, was -alfo the pa¬ rent of her victim, and they were cer¬ tainly fifters. Without dnring to caft her guilty glances on the fuffering Rofaline, (he was retreating from the latter, when the demoniac Agnes ruihed into the chamber, and fei&ing the dagger, faid— " Hadft thou refigned this act to me, it had, ere this, been executed." " Then be it foP* replied Paulina, in fear¬ ful hurried tones, as fhe retreated.—-" Do as thou wilt, fo I never behold her more.** , Saying thefe words, die darted from the dreadful fcene, unable herfelf to perform, or witnsfs its conclufion.
Too
Too well Rofaline. knew in Agnes (he fliould find that invincible foe who had fworn eternal enmity to her parents and their helplefs offspring. Agnes had long panted for an unjuft re¬ venge of the flight to her love, which had never been deceived by even an offer of a promifed return; and though bound by no tie, file voluntarily enlifted herfelf to the intereft of Ru.iolph and Paulina, as inftru* ments of her own defire, for the gratification of the implacable hatred fhe had conceived to the man. whom fhe had qpce adored to diftraftion, but whofe marriage with Lady Matilda St, Ofwythe had proved the bane of her own peace and future happinefs, as well as that of Sir Alfred's; and from an enemy fo long concealed, and fo unrelent¬ ingly bent on the dreadful means of \engeance, Rolaline faw how little meicy or forbearance fhe muft hope for; and Agnes, feizing her vidim in her ftrong grafp, exclaimed— o J « My

What penitence or contrition wilicleanfe the foul, ftained with blood and crime, from the dreadful retri* butxon of murdered innocence ?" feebly pronounced Rofaline. ** I need not abfolution," replied the fiend with a hollow, deep-toned voice % *< elfe could the hypocritical Monks of s $t> Stephen, for a bribe, abfolve me of every guilt, and pray my foul from purgatory. 1 ' <* Vain hope! as impotent as futile," re* plied Rofaline, with a flight re-animation.—• «* Will the Eternal accept of a purdiafed abfolution from crimes which he himfelf muft one
one day be the awful judge of ? Will the throne of Heaven's Majefty open its gates to the foul of an impenitent criminal, blood- ftained, and died with the guilt of a life of murder and irjuftice ?

With a Mow of tender fenfations not ia be defcribed, fhe caft her eyes over the foreft, and viewed with anguifli the once be¬ loved, endearing fcenes of her happy youth, now made the fad prifon of their wronged miftrefs's dreadful captivity. She watch¬ ed the fun, as it flione refpfendeat in glory, in the midway of* the heavens, and darted its refulgent warmth in fparkling vivid animation, on all around ; the beau¬ tiful foliage of the foreft trees received innumerable variegations from the daz¬ zling beams of the golden luminary, whilll the young zephyrs, gently agitating the leaves, and opening into bloom the wild flowers of the foreft, fpread their foft and balmy treafures around, and breathed over the tranquil fcene, the calm, delightful ex* halations of advancing fumoier. Deeply fighing to the fen flu ions which the charming fcene infpired, (he felt and owned ' how fweet were the bleffings of liberty-—how little
little truly valued rill loft; and, from the ferenity of all without, fhe now turned from the unwelcome view and gloomy horrors of all within, nor did flie ever once, during the day, attempt to withdraw herfelf from the window, till the mellow glow of the fetting fob proclaimed the approaches of evening, which had not yet quite faded into night, when, as'flie wiped away the drops of forrow which- had filentiy trickled down her haggard, grief-worn ' coun¬ tenance, flie quitted the window, and approaching the little fecret recefs, where flie had concealed the lute from the fury of Agnes, flie took it from'its hiding-place, together with the papers ihe had formerly found, which fhe now kiffed vuth filial fer* vency, convinced, from former as well as prefent circuiuftances, that they were the difordered fragments of her mother's efforts, as well as that the lute had been the only folaceof her fufferings, whilft writhing, per¬ haps in thi* very apartment, bene-uh the in¬ flidions of ixei relen leis, jealous rival. 3 The
The chords of the lute now produced a few melancholy wild ftrains, as lightly flie paffed her fingets over them. " Ah, my fainted, fuffering mother!** fighed forth the weeping Rofaline, " how little did you imagine, when laft ydur fingers touched thefe trembling firings, how little did you imagine they would become alike the. foothers of your daughter's, as well as your own unhappinefs." A precious tear of pity for tlie miferies of her parent fell upon the inftrument, whilft a look, that expreffed the melting feelings of her foul, was caft upon the objed that awakened it to life* and fpoke the inward fenfations that now anguifhed her mind. * She pla}*ed for a few moments fome pen- five ftrains ; but her heart writhii.g with the contending ftruggles of painful recoiledions, pity and mdignatiun rendcicd her, for the firft time, indifferent to the power cf mufic - t for

envelope of the miniature refembkuices of her hufband and infant* Rofaline, as die gazed upon the ptdure of her father, immediately knew it* from the ftrong likenefs that frill remained to the beloved perfon of a parent, whofe once living features, imprefled on her tender memory, could never be era fed whiift affec¬ tion furvived the wreck of his diffolution, and lived as forcibly in the heart of his daughter, as if Sir Alfred had really not ceafed from exiftence. The features were beautiful beyond any thing that Rofaline had ever conceived -, for her father, broken and ruined in his Jook^ by the conftant mifery he had known, though ftill handfome-to the lateft moments qf his life, had entirely loft that vivid, ani¬ mating glow of happy youthful beauty which tbe miniature repiefemcd ; and which, in¬ deed, as far as pcrfonal attractions might e^cufe the dotage of a mifguided paflion, A;>nes f s.
Agnes's here found an extenuation; for in his more youthful days, Sir Alfred, or ra¬ ther the real Baron of Edmondville, evi¬ dently was a being, both in mind and per¬ fon, formed to delight the eye* and engage attention and love from all that were capable of admiring the fparkling manly graces of his wit and countenance ; and Rofaline, as with a deep-drawn figh, flie thought upon tiie admired features of the loft Conftantine, could not but acknowledge that even his, pcrled in excellence as they were, were furpaffed when compared with thofe which flie now found her father had been gifted with. She kiffed the precious memorial of bis once living features; and that no fudden accident mi^ht^rob her of her valued trea¬ fure, after having bathed it with the tears of love, fhe placed it in her bofom, and took up a fmaller pidure, which, on examination, was that of an infant of two years old, fo fpeci¬ fied upon the back of the ivory, with the name of Matilda placed at the bottom.
Rofaline
Rofaline knew this to be herfelf; and rather difappointed that it had not been her , mother, fhe hurried it into her veft, as, with the light of day that ftill remained, flie once more approached the broken cafcment that admitted it, and, with emotions of unequal¬ led mifery, began to perufe the manufcript which feemed to have been written only at fudden ftarts of monentary infanity, and was totally devoid of any regularity or con¬ nexion whatever. The firft paper wa* in- • coherent, and its contents fpoke the wild diforder of the mind that had didated its expreflions. Jt thus began :—
u They killed him before my very eyes % I could not fave my worfhipped Alfred !— but my heart, burfting its prifon, let fall its mingling ftreams of blood with his, and I vainly hoped that I had died with all that on earth wis dear "to mc.

Lii-eSs fo exprcffive of the fufferings of her murdered parent, almoft rived in twain the heart of the too fufceptible Rofaline j no*v fa'al'y convinced that, though her father feemed to hive expiefled no fufpicion that the ruins of the Aboey had been made tiu piifon of the haplels Matilda, yec was fhe herfelf well affured that, from thefe papers,. and fome former dark hints that accidentally
fell from the lips of Agnes, this very cham¬ ber was alike the dungeon of herfelf, and had been alfo the fame to her fuffering mother. Several lines of the records became ex> tinct through damps and mildew; and when again lhe was able to proceed, Rofaline could only here and there gather a Tew almoft obliterated characters and uncon¬ nected fentences.
" Great God of Mercies, fliut not the light of thy divine influence from me, but aid, with thy healing ftrength, my weakened fenfes, that I may trace fome of thofe hor¬ rors 1 have endured, ere my faculties again defert me, and I quite forget ail knowledge # ofmyfelf!~~It will not be* e\c:, dieie poor melancholy means of fad employment are denied $—1 cannot write ; and the feelings of ,my foul are drowned iu floods of hor¬ ror !—What am 1 ?

[Here again the papers failed, from the damps and mildew that obfcurcd their elm* racttr-. Rofaline turned over two pages* totai'y obliterated, and at length, in the fuc¬ ceeding, was able to proceed as follows:]- ---- * " They tore my child from my arms, and bore me from the Caftie I know not whither.—-No pitying angel interpofed in my behalf i they robbed me of all on earth thatl adored, and Toned me to the remote ruins of St. Ofwj the's monaftery, where, in this dreary prifon, 1 gave life to the hated offpring of ihe accurfed Rudolph—the pledge of guilt, violence, and outrage !

In the hour of infamty it was brought into life, for I felt not the throes of Nature j nor did a mother's yearnings heave my heart with joy for the birth of her child, whofe on'y look was de¬ teftation and abhorrence, and her bleffings converted ro deep-fouled curfes.

Here the papers' abruptly concluded.-— The violence of Rofaline's feelings cannot be defcribed, and for fome time (lie re¬ mained deeply abforbed in refleding on v» hat (lie had read $ and fo much were her thoughts engaged on the afflidion their dreadful contents had occafioned, that (lie was totally regardlefs of all around her, till darknefs and night foon' pre¬ vented her view of the furrounding ob* jeds, while her eyes were caft ia tears
tears upon the outlines of the profpect, as it faded into obfeurity, and became cen- denfed and entirely indiftinct. She conti¬ nued in a jftupid torpor of filent grief, that rendered her unconfeious of all that pafled i nor did fhe hear the opening of her, prifon door, or perceive the prefence of any one, till a harfh voice founded clofe upon her ear, and recalled her to reco!lection, as the glare of his lamp fhone on the dark countenance of Ruffo, the villain who had conveyed her from the Caftie of Urbandine to her prefent melancholy prifon. With a * look of ftern ferocity, he bade her defcend from the window, and follow him. " Whither?'* faintly afked Rofaline, alarmed at the fight of a being whofe un- promifing afpect made her tremble, as fhe inwardly concluded that this wretch was now employed by her foes to do the bloody deed themfelves bad feared to perform.** ** You will know, ere long,** roughly re¬ plied the man, as he forcibly feized her arm ; £ 2 and
and by that adion feemed to foy his defigns fhould not bc difputed; Rofaline, from long experience, was too well affured how fruitlefs was refiftance to the power of her lawlefs oppretfbrs/ Without fpeaking, there¬ fore, flic followed her guide, who led bcF'in filence from,the dreary chamber, along the winding corridors, and down a diftant flight; oi flairs. As they entered a vaulted vcftibule that led to another long paffage, Rofaline looked fearfully at-the countenance of her , frowning fierce companion, whofe dark bufliy eyebrows overhung a pair 1 of deep funk eyes, that doj idurctl to her view the foul of defigning cruelty and unrelenting treachery ;*and almoft certain of the horrid fete that awaited her, (he tried to withdraw' licr arm from his firm grafp, with a refolu¬ tion to efcape, if poffible, through the dark winding labyrinths of the Abbey; but he retained too fecurely his hold, and ihe uaftd not ftruggle for freedom,' left fhe fhould
ihould provoke fome fearful act dcftructive to her prefent fafety. Obliged, therefore, to fubmit, ihe had only time to recommend herirlf to the direction cf Providence, ere he forcibly led her down what appeared a piazza or long vaulted gallery, fuppoited by thick and cumbrous pillars of ftoix, that were Gothicdiy arched to the roof, which was comprefled and low, and feemed like an ifle that had formerly led to the cells of the monaftery ; for many of the (mail grated arches ftill remaining, feemed to fmction the fuggeftion, and gave to the whole a more for* lorn and dreary afptct than Rofaline had yet {em in any of the other parts of the ruins i which, together with the akrm of her mind for the confequence of this adventure, almoft appalled her heart vvith the melan¬ choly horrors of fuch a place. Many large figures of fculptured images and fajnts filled' tlie arched rcceilcs oi the walls j and at the branching of another gallery, of di- mcnfions a'nd extent as long as that ihe was palling down, Rolalinc beheld the patro.i £ 3 ii*i .ns
flirine of the Saint of the Abbey.' It was entirely ftripped of the ornaments and of¬ ferings which had once enriched it''from the prodigal bounties of pious pilgrims and vifiters; but fome of the limbs ant| features of the ftatue were ftill remaining^ the teft of their well-wrought execution, which Time had not yet b^cn able to'deftroyj and as the lamp had firft gleameil on the Kcumbent figure, Rofaline,. unprepared for fuch an object, ftarted, and flhrunk back, for it feemed to breathe animation ;— and at firft flie really thought it fome myf* terious being that had the power of hfe, whi'ft the reft, as fhe paffed, appeared, as the mifty rays of the lamp enabled her to diftinguiih them, ready to ftart from their receftes, and to frow n, in grim folem- nity,' upon the difturbcrs of their filent, gloomy habitations. Arriving at the clofed door of a room or ceil, Rolaline heard the faint.cries of fomr. perfjii in evident pain^ proceeding from the
the interior. Ruffo, (lowly unelofing tfie door, led her down a few fteps ; and Rofaline, cafting her eyes round, be¬ held herfelf in a fmall vaulted recefs, where at one corner a female form was ftretched upon a low couch, whofe groans befpoke the extreme pain and anguifti (lie endured. u Are you then fo pitiful as to approach a dyingfinner ?" exclaimed a voice, fami¬ liar to the ear of Rofaline. The man now quitting the cell, and dofing the portal, the anguifhed perfon again by name called for Rofaline to ad¬ vance towards her; who, as fhe did fo, be¬ held, by the feeble rays of a fufpended lamp, the ghaftly diftorted countenance and form o Agnes, now penitent and dying, " Approach," flie cried, with an enfeebled, flow tone of voice, " ap- proach^ poor, injured being! a.,d now e 4 behold

The aftoniftiment of Rofaline at a fcene fo unexpected, had for a moment fufpended te faculties % but her foul, melting to the e 5 touch.

It was the fight of this objed that had alarmed her fears on the preceding night, and made her paufe on the bloody deed fhe meant to have perpetrated, had not the avenger, conicience, fuddenly tilled her mind with unufual hor¬ ror, as the recoiieclion of thac dark ir^uf- ft'-Lion

It was fufpended over the- ruined ftaircafe that led to her late prifon j aud now, with 1 palpitating alarm, flie paufed, to debate whether flie fliould advance further, or feek fome other-means of enlargement, for (lie dreaded the too probable chance of being perceived by Ruffo, i\nd again immured in her dungeon. This path feemed evidently the ncarcft and moft familiar j whilft, fliould (he in/a back, ihe might entirely deprive hcrfeil of the only means of efcape that re¬ mained, and lofe herfelf in the unavailing effort to attain ii. Proceeding forward, (he cairclo tlie door ot the ruined chamber, uhcre (he Lad firft relied on the night that (lie
flie had been compelled to enter its dilapi¬ dated walls. A gleam of light fhone througk a broken crevice; and foftly approaching it* fhe caft her eyes within, and beheld the grim form of Ruffo, fleeping before tlie wide hearth of the fire, as he lay reclined on a broken couch near it. Haftily pafling on¬ wards, vflie entered the veftibule, and hurry¬ ing up the fteps that led to thp door, which 3iow was all that ftood between her and liberty, fhe fummoned her every remaining effort of ftrength and fortitude, and began to unbolt the heavy faftenings. Her eager impatience once more to regain her freedom rendered her incautious and forgetful; and as fhe drew afide the bars with a fudden noife, that echoed through the dreary build* ing, its found aroufed the flumbering Ruffo, who, in a moment, was feen rufhing through the portal where Rofaline had beheld him, as the latter, now urged by def, eration, wrenched back the laft oppofing bolt. The door giving way, fhe darted up the remain¬ der of the fteps, and in a moment beheld vot. iv. f hcrielf

Not a found broke upon the folemn ftillnefs of the night; all nature (lumbered" in a deep repofe, unagitated by the (lighted afpirations of Zephyr f and Rofaline, pauf- ing in mute admiration, pondered as (he recovered a (light degree of compofure, upon her own uncommon fituatiotv The death of Agnes, fo fudden arid unexpected, with her own wonderous efcape, and the piefent
prefent metamorphofe, feemed to her afto- nifhed fenfes rather the work of enchant¬ ment than reality; and it was fome nio-^ ments ere flie was convinced that all was not a dream, and herfelf enjoy ing once more the foul-thrilling blefTings c r liberty. To a mind fo long enfeebled, fo long familiarized with affliction, and to whom all hope of happinefs was for ever annihilated, the tafte of a plea¬ fure fo defpaired of and unexpected was a tranfport almoft too great for her fufcep¬ tible feelings to bear with firmnefs and com* pofure \ and the fudden rufli of joy for feve¬ ral moments overwhelmed her fpirits. When again Ihe was able to think, Qio debated whither fhe could now go for pre¬ fent fecurity, from the fearch that would foon be made after her, Paulina, flie knew, from the deceafed Agnes, had fraudulently taken poffeflion of the Abbey, which now afforded no flicker to its defolate, wander¬ ing miftrcfs. In the Callle of. Urbandine flie had no maternal friend to oiler her f 2 pR)t; , clion,

Auftin s monaftery, though at a greater diftance, was open to her aid, and would afford her a fecure retreat, " Ah could I but once readh its friendly gates,** flie foftly fighed, " I fhould again tafte the bleffings of peaceful fecurity; there, loft to m> felf, and forgotten by the world, 1 fhould no more become the mark for .treachery and guilt to flioot their en¬ venomed deadly poifons at, and the wretched daughter of a ruined Houfe would find an only retreat from the accumulating hor¬ rors of a perfecuted deftiny. There may her wearied fpirit reft from its worldly miferies, and, in the cheerful performance of religious duties, find a healing balm for thofe bitter loffes and agonizing afHidions, which, in a deceitful world, the has endured, bereft of every hope in life, and dead for ever ,to the fenfations of happinefs, deftroyed beyond redemption.** Inwardly

She had for fame time been in a happy ftate of torpid forgetfulneft, when a loud refounding flu ill whittle echoed through the woods, and awoke her from her fliort infen- fibility to a momentary re-animation of llrength. Some perfons pafled the glade where flje lay reclined) and Rofaline (for - f 4 every

At firft (he wasunheard, and the ftrangers paffed, heedlefs of her cries | but again repeating, with a rather louder tone,«' Have pity on -me ere I die V* fome rough looking men at length ap« proaclied; one of them, difplaying a dark lantern, difcovered the fufferer, and advancing ftill nearer, Rofaline, as (he. caft her languid eyes upon his fierce counte¬ nance, which the light faintly (hone upon^ almoft repented that (he had folicited help from a being whofe appearance filled her with terror and alarm* The ftranger, however, drawing from his reft a leathern flafk* forcibly held it to the lips of Rofaline, and in harfli tones bade her drink the contents, which he affured her were a fovereign cordial for all difeafes, Rofaline, $ot fufficiently fenfible to know exactly what paffed, didashe defired, and foorji indeed

Say, yourgSir, whence came you, and wherefore alone, in this forlorn condition, do you tempt , the dangers of this unfrequented foreft ?" Rofaline trembled ftill more, for there was a ferocity in the manner of the delivery of the ftranger, as w*ell as in his looks, and thofe ofhis companions who crowded round her, that not a little alarmed her ; and flie hefitated how to anfwer, which the ftranger perceiving, thus continued :—" I ice thou art unwilling to truft us.

They* became irrefolute, and confulted with each other apart from the affrighted trembler. Mercy, however, at length prevailed ; they flieatiied their fan¬ guinary weapons, and Oliver, the foremoft of the party, again advancing, roughly pro¬ nounced— " Since thou feemeft in need of help, and haft fued for mercy, acknowledging our power, thou (halt not lack it.

" Gracious God !" inwardly ejaculated Rofaline, u become an affociate of rob* bers! Oh Providence! for what am 1 re* ferved ?'* Her foul (huddered at the fearful pic¬ ture of her thoughts, but refiftance was ufelefs; nor did (he dare again to (peak* left Oliver, the foremoft robber, who had already been attentively fcrutinifcing her whole perfon, (hould difcover, in reality, that fhe was not what fhe feemed to be.-— Expreflions of difhke or abhorrence ihe kit Would be dangerous to her fafety; and fhe fubmitted to be raifed from the earth* though tfye wounds flie had received 3 from
from the thorns and briars rendered her at firft nearly unable to ftand, which her ferocious guides perceiving, from tho blood that iflued from her torn hands and legs, they had humanity fufficient to help her onward through the brambles and fliort underwood that impeded their progrefs. As they proceedec) forward, Oliver thus continued, addrefBng his difeourfe to the fuflfering Rofaline:— * c Our Captain is noble, and will foon, if he finds thee willing, make thy fortune, which, it feems, thou art much in need ofi if we may judge from the emptinefs of thy purfe. He is indeed fometimes given to melancholy moodj, and fhuns our jolly focietiesi but he never hinders our mirth, nor do any of us pre fume ever to queftion him.

If thou knew the terrible effeds and danger of exciting his refentment, thou wouldft thank my well-meaning inftrudions, which
which now inform thee how to avoid, them." Rofaline liftened to this account in filence^ for as flic was well,allured no prayers or efforts would procure her liberty, fhe made none to engage their pity : fince, as her fcx, flie hoped, was undiscovered, fhe might ftill efcape more terrible dangers were flie to continue the deception^ which a fruitlefs importunity might perhaps have rendered abortive j and Hie now refkd- ed 5 as the terrors of her mind began to abate, that degrading as muft bc a fate fo little ex* peded, and deeply as flic regretted it, yet even in a den of lawlefs robbers, the fhould be ilxr more fife with the ihield of a pro- teding Providence, and an unfuliied con¬ fcience for hcrguaid, than ihe could have been, had Hie remained in the Abbey. A knowledge of the certain doom that there awaited her now, from comparifon, recon¬ ciled her to the Idler evil flie had fallen into; and
and the change, though lamentable, was certainly for the better, for die had efcaped the cruel hatred of her unrelenting fitter; and as long as her difguiie continued'to fcreen her from infult, ihe hoped all per- fonal dangers were now ended, Obligd to-yield to imperious neceility^. Rofaline ftill continued to uie the fupport of her fanguinary conductors, who guided her fafely through the woods till they reached their utmoft boundaries; and as- (lie was led to the exterior verge ot their outikirts, ihe was enabled to diftinguimr the tall gigantic figures of her fearful- companions, whofe fteel armour and- cuiraffes glittered in the reflection of a brilliant moonihine, and added fiercenefs to their ftrong and mufcular limbs. The out¬ lines cf their features were all that ihe could* clearly diftinguiih ; for their rufty helmets hid much of their ferocious looking coun¬ tenances, though fufficient was left un¬ covered
covered to difplay them but too exprefEve ,of their defperate and lawlefs pradices. The robbers quitted not the edge of the foreft borders, but led their trembling pri¬ foner in filence to the outfide of its fkirts,, till, after a length of time elapfed, they ar¬ rived at the brink ofa deep fhaded dell, on whofe fummit they halted ; whiift Rofaline, liftening in fearful dread to the echoed blafts of the leader's flirill horn, caft her eyes in expedation over the tranquil fcene, bi ightly illumined by an unclouded moon, and be¬ held, at no great diftance, the frowning ruins of fome old towers, which, from their fituation, fhe doubted not weie the remains of St. Ofwythe Caftie. The freedom 'of conjedure, however, was but of fhort dura« tion; for Oliver, feizing roughly her arm, led her down a fteep and rugged descent, whofe lofty trees, as they wildly Ipread nieir branches in clofe entwined embiaces, foon fliut the beams of Cynthia from their thick embowering receffes^ aud as Rofaline reached^

Rjofaline r
' Rofaline, as the ftrong glare of the lamps fhone upon their wild unfeminine forms and countenances, felt {hocked and difgufted at the lawlefs fcene of guilt and infamy; nor could flie refrain from comparing the whole contour of their looks and habits, ns well as their adions and fierce appearance, to the fabled histories of the fallen angels of dark* nefs, and this their cave to tlie hnnicaiurable region of their horrific habitation. The return of the banditti, however, dif- tuibed their ferocious employments, and each cf them arofe to meet her feparatecompanion, and greet his welcome return vuth the fearch of frefli expeded fpoils, and plundered booty. How was the refined fenfibility and deli¬ cate mind of Rofaline wounded, as fhe was compelled to hear their licentious con- verfe, and liften to the language of the Women, who, with unfhrinking boldnefi, replied to the wanton irregular quef¬ tions
tions of the robbers, and then demanded u what victories tiiey had gained, what pil¬ lage taken, or what chicken-hearted tra¬ veller had met his fate, in refifting their brave champions of juftice. ,, Oliver, now approaching a tall woman of a heauiifuf but fierce' afpect, and large fpark ling eyes, exclaimed, ** Here, Elfrtda, I prefent you my fpoils/* taking Rofaline, with rude civility, by the arm, and leading her towards the latter j " I picked up this^ young trembler in the foreft i *t\$' a timid youngfter that has, I fuppofe, de¬ ferted from lome old guardian* In mere compaffioa I have fpared his hfe till our noble Captain relolves wnetherto keep him* or not; fo do thou adminifter to his needs 5 for he feems in a dejecled plight, and much requires afllftance*'* Elfrida, with fiercenefs, at firft: viewed the trembling Rofaline* till in a moment her features

Rofaline
Rofaline heaved a deep figh of forrow and regret, as thefe loved objeds of loft felicity met her aching fmht. Tears of agony fell from her eyes as, hopelefs, fhe paflfed the dv^y in reviewing! though at a diftance, the endeared and well-remembered fcenes of infancy. * The difcovery of her difguife rendering her prefent habit no longer of fervice to the •caufe for which unwillingly it had been •afiumed, Rofaline quitted the larger cham¬ ber for the one appointed for her own ufe, and with teal fatisfadion again refused her proper (hape; for the innate delicacy and refinement of her mind had been greatly pained by the metamorphofe which the peculiarity of her circumftances had com- pelled her to adopt* In a large cabinet (he found a drawer filled with female apparel of the richeft texture: one from among the reft, the jJaineft flie could difcovet, flie made choice of; but even this had a pro* i ufenefs of ornaments that ill-fuited her to make
makt ufe of, fince flie felt an invincible repugnance to habiting herfelf in thofe veftments which had doubtlefs been plundered by the hands of lawlefs oppref* fion and depredation, A loofe flowing robe $f grey coloured Perfian filk, with a drapery of black, was foon ftripped of all its former fplendid decorations $ and Rofaline once more beheld ' herfelf dreffed in a female attire, which well*fuited the double occa¬ fion of her melancholy caufe of grief and mourning. Having bound her veft with a t;one of black bugles, and confined her auburn trelfes with the fame, fhe threw a fable veil over her head, and Jook^d, as in* deed flie was, the living reprefentative of pentive, meek, fubmitting melancholy and forrow, if poffible more impreffively en¬ gaging to the tafte of refinement and fenfi¬ bility, than when adorned in the richeft apparel, and blooming in the fpark- ling brightnefs of animating happinefs, .^naEoyed by a fingle grief,
In this chamber Rofaline found not a veftige of hope to encourage the poftibiiity of an efcape. It feemed to be a nook tur* ret appertaining to the great tower of the tether chamber, and by the many receffes of the walls* plainly dif|3layed it to have been a place appropi iated to the keeping of war (lores, and was evidently, from the vaftlbbftance of the cement, and durability of the whoCe building, the tower of defence during for* mer tic$t&+ P^ofaline apprcmched the deep indented recefs of the window frame, which, with ibme difficulty, (he climbed up to, and cafting her eyes through the narrow cafe- ment, found the tower was furrounded by a deep trench filkd with a ftagnant water, which at once rendered abortive every vain hope of enlargement. ' Fears and appre* bended dangers no-v filled her heart with ther torturing inflictions fur the otife* que s ces of a fit nation, where c^cy alter r *n* tive was denied her, and where alfo but little
little favourable to her fafety was to bc ex¬ pected from the wavering forbearance of Gondemar, whofe mind, though it had for once yielded to the ftruggles of confcience fiom a knowledge of its fallen and felf-de* graded ftate, was yet but half a penitent, and ftill governed by the fearful impetuofity of criminal and guilty paffions. She trem¬ bled alfo at the threats of Oliver, and the too fure means his iawleft courfe of life afforded ' for the execution and fuccefs of any daring plans he might fet on foot for the attain¬ ing his deteftable purpofes:—whichever way her thoughts turned to find a fecure refting-place, ihe found only an empty void, or profpects alone that prefented the teem¬ ing pictures of danger and diftrefs to her future peace, whilft the only real circum¬ ftance that could now affc rd relief to her an¬ guifhed reflections, was the change of her laft confinement for the prefent, which at leaft; exempted her from aflbciatmg with the* dtfguftiug beings that inhabited the cavern*—a fmall but acceptable compcnfatio.n vol* iv* u tor

It was impoflible to fuppofe that they were unac¬ quainted with its fituation; and although the recorded accounts of its being the refort of unquiet fpirits mi^ht alarm the fearful cottager

It was on the third night after the horrible aft which had made him a fratricide, that, walking gloomily through the foreft, and deliberating on the wreck of his loft peace* he was iud~ h 3 denly

Having accorded with their demands he (lowly and fecretly watched them to the* very brink of their abode, and carefully remarked its exact fituation* The horrid iktd he had* committed, appalled his foul 1 he trembled at the dreadful murder he had perpetrated, and in every tree of the fore ft fancied was concealed an officer of juftice, ready to inflict the punifli- ment his crimes had merited. To enter again the towers of Urbandine, no con fide r- ation, no effort of intereft, ambition, or affection could induce him} for he felt bimfelf unable to the fearful talk of braving, with his blood-ftained prefence, the light of his fire, in whofe fcrutinizing glances (fo fearful had guilt made him) he trembled to read the difcovery of his crimes. This, however, was not penitence* for his only fenfation of regret confifted in the mercy he had (hewn to Rofaline; and he now re¬ pented that he had not, as (he lay infenfible upon the mangled manes of a murdered brother,

Love* hatred, and fear, all combined in one objed that excited their paffions in his breaft, became too ftrong to be fob med, and what the one infpired, the commiflion of the other as powerful y oppofed ; but although his own fafety demanded her life to fecure it, yet his love withheld the deadly ftroke, and by turns he adored her with all the inflamed vehemence of an hopelefs paf¬ fion, and feared her wiih all^ the terrors of a guilty mind, trembling with fufpicious ap¬ prehenfions for the difcovery ot its fatal fecrets ; and, in addition to his other dreads, were the nflick and never-ceafing c: *e t f „u awakened, appalled confcience, vvhich, blu¬ ing heavy on his fevered mind, rendered h,s adions fubfcivicnt to its commands, and conftantly prefented to his ha?affc 1 fight the bleeding form of Lis mirJead vidim h 4 Secreang
Secreting himfelf in the gloomy interior' of the eaftern tower, which conftantly kept alive the memory of the fcene of hor¬ ror and outrage there performed, he awaited thcconc'ufion of his fate, and in all things was doomed to feel the curfe of his heinous enormities; for the proud tOvvers and lordfhip of Urbandine—the glittering b,ut thathad caily filkd his mind with rancour, r.nd Ivs haul with deflation of their i «,b!c heir, was dcftincd„ irrevocably, to fall Ir.ck into the original channel that inherited them i fince, in the feparation of the Baron from the illuftrious injured Ruithvina, flis sgain poffeffed their free, undoubted dif¬ pofal, and Conftantine, the murdered, haplefs, noble-minded Conftantine, had died in vain; nor could his remorfe¬ lefs brother now ever lay a claim to that ambitious fortune, that had goaded him on to the commiffion of fratricide.

Remember the words of thy bro* ther, and refign thy guilty purpofes for ever, 1 ' Gondemar did indeed, with fliuddering horror, remember them, and in mad defpair pronounced a curfe upon the deed that caufed them. An overwhelming fenfe of his crimes at this moment deprived him of the aid of reafon ; he threw afide the m\\g* nia of his high rank, and muffling himfelf in a long concealing mantle, and covering his face with a vifor, rallied, in wild diforder, to the dm of the robbers, demanded ad* mit tance, and only enjoining them to ior~ h u beat
bear enquiries, offered himfcif freely to be¬ come a member of their lawlefs employ-t ment. It fo happened that the Captain of tlie band had, on the preceding night, been fhot by a traveller whom he would have plundered. There was, in the ftrong gigantic figure of Gondemar, a command-* ang fuperiority, that involuntarily impreffed the robbers with a rude kind of reverence to his perfon, whilft the boldnefs ofhis man¬ ners, and the intrepid adion by which he had undauntedly placed himfelf at their mercy, won the moft of the troop to an in¬ ftant refpeft for his courage and valour.— Oliver was the 'next in command to the deceafed Chiefs and but for the fudden, unexpeded appearance of this welcome ftranger, would have been promoted to the vacant ftation. The robbers, however, had long been diffatisfied with the infolent fu¬ periority ofhis behaviour, and many of them, with joy, embraced this unexpeded Oppor¬ tunity
tunity to prevent him from becoming their 'Chief, by railing an opponent of their own choice, /rom whom they expeded lefs feve¬ rity than from Oliver* Two parties were therefore formed; and the majority giving their voices in favour of the new comer, Gondemar was inftantly eleded ; and he, who, in a moment of infamty, had flown from the fancied purfuit of retributive juf¬ tice, novv found hhnielf the head of a law¬ lefs band of fanguinary ruffians, whom to defert, were he fo inclined, would be to en- fure an almoft inftant punifhment in death ; but to his mind, naturally cruel, and now debafed by crimes the moil horrid, a fitua¬ tion fuch as he now unexpededly found him¬ felf in, had little to excite repugnance or (hame; and Gondemar, whole afpiring, ambitious mind, but fallen, defperate for¬ tunes, now but ill aflmulaLed, found a real gratification to that love of power he pof¬ feffed, in the future unlimited authority of his new fituation*
Here.
Hera, guarded by a numerous fee of fan¬ guinary beings, avowed enemies to either juftice or pity, he knew he fhould be fafely fecured from the confequences of his dark mifdeeds, even were they difcovered ; and having, in a little time, gained an almoft entire afcendency over the minds of his hardened companions, he firm began to lay the formation of many dangerous fchemes for the ulrimate deftrudion of the haplefs Rofaline, whom he had refolved to force from the Caftie fecretly, by the means of Harold, whom he ftili retained at Urbandine as a fpy; when chance, be¬ friending his wiflies, faved him further trouble, and, beyond his hopes, conduded the lucklefs maid fecurely to his dreadful rendezvous. It fo happened that on the very night Rofaline was forcibly conduded down the cavern, Gondemar, from the reft- leffnefs of a guilty, tortured mind, had, in gloomy, difcontcnted meditations, quitted the
the apartments allotted for his ufe, to prow the caverns that were the habitations of his companions, which, being large and fpacious, permitted him freely to walk unmolefted and unfeen* The robbers were already bound in the flumbers of repofe, and for fome time he paced the fubterraneous paf- feges, whofe echoes returned no other founds or noife than the flow tread of his feet, and the groan which guilt and confcience fent from the inmoft recefles of his foul; nor would it be controuled. Pafling for¬ ward, however, he beheld a diftant moving light; and watching the perfon who carried it, knew it to be that of Oliver, who, at this moment entering the cell of Rofaline, was as quickly followed by Gondemar.— - Oliver had in reality fufpeded the difguife of, Rofaline, and now determined to take advantage of the hour and place, fhould the ftranger, vvhich the delicacy of his ^perfon and manners feemed well to warrant the conclufion of, be a woman, m

The unexpected appearance of Gonde¬ mar, however, rendered abortive his brutal defigns: Oliver detefted him. as the uoftart who had alone withheld him from the com¬ mand he (hould otherwife have had over his fierce colleagues. He did not, however,, dare difpute their choice, or ihew difobe- dience to his Captain, although, his heart filled with rancour againft him, he had now" nearly cxprefied his bitter deteftation, par¬ ticularly as Gondemar immediately dif~ covered in the features who in reality the fuppofed youth was; for no fooner had his eyes beheld Rofaline, as (lie lay afleep, than Ire joyfully recognized her, and gave the ftricteft command to Oliver, as foon as (he (hould be recovered from her in- fallibility, to remove her to his own apartments, for purpofes too open to adr mit of doubt. But in the very moment when, defence!efs, and at his mercy, (he knelt before him, and no obftruction remained to oppofe his guilty wiflies, an inward judge withheld

A fecond battle had again been fought on the plains of Urbandine. Marguet had recovered almoft all her late loffes, and, by one decifive blow, again placed Hcsry ths Sixth on the throne of Albion, whilft the powers of York, weakened and difpirited, ftill made a vigorous effoit 10 withitaiid their foes j and its grand Ciitel, joining all his forces-with his aides, was battening to meet th$ intrepid Queen, and ftem, if poflibk, the

The field of battle was again contipu us to the fortrefs of Urbandine;. and Margaret, in her progrefs to the former, palled within a league of the latter, before which lhe refolved.again to pitch her tent, and cither humble its proud towers to allegiance and fuhmiffion, or bury its haughty commander in the ruin flie determined to hurl upon his traiterous difarHction, that had rendered unfuccefsful her valiant efforts to reftore her Henry to his throne. The garrifon of Urbandine had lately re* ceived a fmall fupply, and its lofty battle* ments once more proudly frowned defiance on the warlike Margaret ; "but the latter had been fo fudden in her marches, that her tents and ftandards, with all the magazine cf war, had, in the courfe of one night, unknown to the enemy, been raifed on the phin before their gates: and no fooner had the bright luminary of day glitteicd on the tuirets of Urbandine, thm it

He had prepared for war, but not of fo fpccdy a nature; and thofe fuc- cours, which he knew would Have given fecurity to his caufe, had they arrived, weie, by this fudden attack, entirely prevented from advancing to his aid, fmc& their only pafs to the Caftie was by fea, and that now rendered impracticable by the enemy, who were advantageoufly placed on the heights, and oppofed their landing by a power which it was impoflible to with¬ ftand. The forces of Queen Margaret were nu¬ merous ; but with that magnanimity which ever governed her actions, fhe fent an offer of truce to Otho* and promifed him and his * fupporters a free pardon, if they laid down heir
their arms, and acknowledged Henry as their Sovereign. The Baron, however, ftill vainly hoping that the Duke of York would come to his afliftance, in the defence of a place of fuch confequence to himfelf, refufed nil terms of capitulation, and peremptorily denied rhofe propofed. The refent¬ ment of Margaret, once roufed, was fetal in its effeds to thofe who caufed it.— Wrath and indignation inftantly filled her breaft, and lhe refolved to unloofe the rigour of infulted Majefty to the deftrudion of her daring and hoftile oppo¬ fer, and, with her accuftomed fearleft aclivity, (he gave the fignal for the bloody ftrife. The Caftie, feated on a high rocky eminence, and built on the very brink of the fea, was of itfelf nearly impregnable to affault on any fide, but from the round toweis or the gates and ramparts. A 'nu¬ merous and conquering army* however, was lufficient for the moft invincible obftruc- tions, and the decline of day witneffed the dreadful havoc and carnage made among the
the defenders of the Caftie. It was on this very eve that Gondemar, and half the forces of his fierce companions fk ! lied to the coverts of tlie woods, to await the fate of battle, as they expeded "a large booty from the dead of either party, and from thofe who might be vanquiflied. Gondemar, from the fecret ftation where he ftood to ob ferve the fate of war, viewed its furious contefts with emotions incompre- henfible, and burnt anew to fignalize him¬ felf in the valiant deeds which were that day performed. His foul, inflamed to ardour, panted to ru ft* into the niidft of the battle $ but the calling remembrance that he was a robber, an outlawed murderer, damped his impitient, daring fpirit; for now he dreaded to expofe himfelt in honourable combat, left the Knights, who once had witneffed the ga ? lant proweis ofhis arm, Ihould difcovej his fallen,degraded iuuatun.
The
The battle raged long, and was obfti* nately fought by either fmrty. At length, however, victory decided for Margaret, and Only defcending night and darknefs faved the flight of the garrifon from the fwords of their fu ious conquerors, who, precipi¬ tately hurrying back to the Caftie, awaited, in defpairing hope, the fate of a now cer¬ tain fiege. The debafed mind of Gondemar could not long fuftain the fight 5 and, leaving his people to their own command, he precipi¬ tately retreated to the cavern, with thoughts darkly portentous to the fafety of the luck* lefs captive. Meanwhile Oliver, who, with nearly twenty men, were left, with ftrict command to purfue a different adventure, difdained any longer to yield obedience, but ufed the prefent moments to convert them fuccefs- fully to his own purpofes. He had long beheld
beheld his Chief with the deteftation of a rival, who had fnatched from him the com¬ mand that would have given an unli¬ ccnfed plenitude of po^er to his aipirtng paffions* Refolved, if poffible, to avenge him¬ felf for the indignity and degradation he had fuftained, he in fecret intrigued and formed parties among the difaffeded of the banditti, and at len 0 th, by alarming their fears, that the Chief they had chofen was a difguifed Noble, who had entered their ren¬ dezvous with a defign to betray them to the ofiicers of offended juftice, he fucceeded in creating doubts and fufpicions in the minds of moft of the robbers, who now, with jealous fcrutiny, began to watch the adions of their leader, and partly believed the truth of Oliver's infinuations. The abfence of Gondemar, with thofe of the robbers attached to his intereft, on this evening from the cavern, feemed favourable to the purpofes of Oliver $ whiift the being, who
who had aroufed him to the conclufion of his long projeded fchemes, would now be completely at his mercy, if they fucceeded. The rare perfections and uncommon beauties of Rofaline had fired Ids licentious heart with wifhes to poffcfs a treafure of fuch furpafling lovelinefs ; and, tike the fiend of old, he now entered the cave, to tempt his colleagues to the ruin of an angel. Summoning the ruffians left under his com¬ mand, and feat ing himfelf on the vacant chair of their Sovereign, he, in an appro¬ priate voice of fury, demanded— *• How long, my galhnt comrades, will you fubmit to the galling yoke of our im¬ perious oppreffor—-how long continue to bow beneath the weight ofhis tyrannic fway, who ufurps the power which I alone ought to poflefs ?

It was a fcene of wildnefs that 'might have appalled the foul of Sin itfelf to wit¬ nefs.

Some, refting on their battle fpears, looked on with envy of their* colleague's happier chance; whilft others, with indifference, beheld the fcene, or rejoiced in the ruin they had helped to effeds aad none attempted, even in thought, to aid the diftraded maid.

Rofaline, cafting her eyes feebly up to* the ftranger, beheld the countenance of one of the Knights Ae had known as thecompa* nion of the Baron of Caftlenuco* She thanked hini with a warmth and grace fuitable to the very great fervice his prefence afforded to he§

Sir Etheldred, having hd her from the cave once more to the reviving breath of Heaven's light and air, (lie joy- fully welcomed the hoped-for bleffing of liberty. The warrior gave directions to fome of his people to convey the re¬ mains of the defperate horde to the camp, whilft the reft received orders to clofe up the mouth of the cave for ever, which, with fome difliculty, was at length accom- pHilied*.

Sir Etheldred now, in profound filence, conduded his lovely charge along the out- fkirts
!fkirts of the woods towards the Monafterf; His labouring mind feemed teeming with fome unrevealed fecret he was eager to im- part j and he was often on the point of un- folding its import, md as. often awed from liis purpofe, by the filent melancholy he beheld in the grief-worn countenance of his companion. Sir Etheldred, warmly fuf* ceptible of the power of beauty^ had viewed Rofaline with eyes of love and honourable regard, and long wifhed for an opportunity t>f being in reality her guardian and pro¬ tedor from the felfifh, difhonourable de-. figns of Otho. He had infenfibly imbibed a growing paffion for the lovely orphan, wlio certainly held an influence over his adions and c'ondud j for viewing, with abhorrence, the oppreffions and fubde artifices of the defigning Baron of Caftlenuco, he quitted the Caftie of Urbandine, the determined enemy of the latter, and fhe avowed avenger and protedor of the defencclefs objed of his wiflies. Sir
Sir Etheldred was young, of ftrong muf¬ cular beauty, and gigantic of perfon* His manners, however, were neither polifhed norrefined j and had not the goodnefs of his heart tempered the high-mettled fpirit of his adtons, they would have borne the ftamp of cruelty and injuftice: but charaderiftics fuch as thefe, in days fo unenlightened, would have pafled for manly hardihood and feudal prerogative, where the unbending relaxations of knowledge, obtained by a fu¬ perior education, would have been confi- dered as weaknefs and effeminacy. The refentment of Sir Etheldred once roufed, was feldom to be appeafed but by the moft abjed fubmiflions and a£know« ledgments. He had quitted his powerful Lordfhip in Scotland, at the perfuafive in- (lances of Otho, and, deceived by the lat¬ ter, had brought with htm near a hundred of his clan to fight the caufe of the Houfe of York$ but Sir Etheldred, though a warlike Chieftain in his own nation, knew but little

But the affront he had received turned to deadly hatred. His former dif- affedion to the Baron* and his haughty, - gallant fpirit ill-brooking the. unguarded fufpicion which Otho, h the firft tranfports ofhis rage and difappointment, had caft upon him, he determined to take a double vengeance for the ftain his honour Jiad been marked with; and leaving the Caftie full of indigmtion, he haftened, as the firft proof of his, refentment, to tlic royal ; tent of Margaret, to whom he offered him¬ felf and hisclanas volunteers, and were with gladnefs received by that politic Princefs.*-* The firft guft of his anger, though a little appeafed
appeafed>,by this means of revenge, for the infult he had received, was not to be en¬ tirely fubdued j and he now burnt, vvith in¬ flamed e?gernefs, to efface, by van- quifhing Otho, the tarnifh his fame had en¬ dured. This night's difcovery of the being who had aflifted in widening the flame of ven¬ geance in his breaft into hatred, enkindled alfo an unquenchable flame of paflion for its loverinfpiring objed; and as he conducted Rofaline towards the Abbey, he ventured, in hefitating re(pedfui language, to declare the ftrength of a paflion her fafcinating charms had given birth to* , Rofaline's mind, bent foleiy on the late occurrences, and deeply harafled by the fears and terrors (lie had endured, was ill prepared to receive fuch an unwelcome teftimony of her beauty, which recalled but too forcibly to her heart the loft happinefs vou IV, & j&lQ

The latter, difappointed and vexed by a refufal he was ill prepared to meet with, and as ill difpofed to fubmit to, impetuoufly demanded if (he loved another. Rofaline felt
and did not deign to anfwer—a filence that confirmed Sir Etheldred in the truth of his fiilpicionS and queftion. She fighed in¬ wardly* and ioftly pronouncing the name of Conftantine, became loft in a train of mournful recollections and meditations, that engaged too ftrongly her undivided atten¬ tion to regard with a thought the angry looks of Sir Etheldred; who, - now con¬ vinced there was for him no chance, of even a hope of fuccels, fullenly continued iil^nt till the towers of the Abbey appeared in fight, and turned the courfe of his ideas into ano¬ ther channel 5 when he entreated permifiion to vifit her at the grate as often as time would allow, till ihe again reftored herfelf to the world—an event that Rofaline had refolved never ihould take place. She, how¬ ever, gracefully repaid her thanks for the very great fervices his timely aid had afforded, adding an aifurance that ihe ihould ever hold herfelf bound to receive, as a friend, the generous being, to whofe merciful inter- k 2 ference
ference flie owed what was dearer to hm than life. Tlie firft dawnings of a grey morning dis¬ played to the welcome fight of Rofaline the fpircs and walls of the Convent of |t# Auftin, fituated on the verge of a high pro¬ montory, that overlooked the boundkfs profped of the ocean. A grateful, fervent prayer of inward thanks was offered up to Heaven for the long*defired attainment of this peaceful bourne of her heart's wither; and as the portrefs admitted her through the gates, flie again took a grateful leave of her admiring protador, who,, whilft he adored, defpaired; and feeling as though flie had caft a fearful load of mifeiy from her foul, flie, with light footfteps, eroded the filent courts with fenfations that feemed to aflure her the long-fuffering agonies of her wearied fpirit would here at length find a lafting refting-place, and the bitter afflidion® flie had endured, no longer opprefs her breaking heart i no longer would fhe tremble at the hateful
feteful approaches of powerful vice, nor again writhe beneath the inflictions of the vengeful Paulina, who, unfearing, might now fecurely enjoy her ufurped poffeffions, and revel in the rights of an injured filler, fince that fifter, tired of the miferable load of life, and feeking only a retired ftelufion from every threatening evil, meant foon to enter into a profeflion, whofe facred engagements rendered the poffeflion of all worldly title or grandeur alike indifferent and unneceffary. Providence, in mercy to her paft fufferings,and patient humility under them, had at length conducted her to the Ipng wifhed-for refuge of the completely wretched, and already fhe felt the blifs of returning peace revifit her fad foul, with a promife of a calm and lafting continuance for the reft of her life. The Superior of the Monaftery received Rofaline with that true pious pity and re¬ fpect fhe had long been prepared to Ihew to a being with whofe misfortunes fhe was well k 3 acquainted.
Acquainted* The Lady Abbefs was of ^ mild, benignant afpeft, and gentle of man,* ner$ and addrefs, with eyes that fpoke the glowing -emanations of a mind of honour and inborn virtue. The motherly tendernefs of her blefllng adecl as an encouraging balm to the foul of Rofaline; and flie had no fooner entreated the future protedkm of the Superior, than fhe eagerly demanded to fees the Lady Ruithvina. The arrival of a long expeded ftranger at the Abbey foon flew throughout the whole Community, The Baronefs had long beeft in expedation of the coming of Rofaline ; and fcarcely had the latter mentioned her name, than fhe found herfelf clafped in the maternal embraces of the only real friend flie poffeffed* The meeting between them was affeding in the extreme; and tears of mutual ten* dernefs and joy choked, for a time, th© power of utterance, The Lady Abbefs, thinking
thinking it prudent to put an end to the excefs of their feelings, now inter¬ pofed her gentle authority, and forbade aft further intercourfe till they had recovered their almoft overwhelming tranfports of mutual joy and grief, Rofaline, though ftill fafcinatingly beau¬ tiful, the Baronefs remarked inwardly, was much changed fince laft fhe faw her. A httkd melancholy had taken poffeflion of her once animated features, which now wore the expreflive ftamp of the fenfa¬ tions paffing in her heart; and as fhe fixed her ^& tenderly on the pale grief-wora countenance of the lovely orphan, flie read too legibly the effects of a mind that had endured long fuffering and dreadful cala¬ mity ;—whilft Rofaline* in the ftill remain^ ing uncommon beauties of the Baronefs, beheld a face wan, ihrunk, and deeply marked with exprefiive grief, that feemed long to have preyed in lecret on her fading fornix and rendered dim the luftre of her k 4 once
once enchanting eyes, Each longed for the moment of unreftrained confidence; and when the hour of matins no longer detained the Abbefs in the parlour, the; Baronefs, with graceful dignity, bowing to fhe former, led* Rolaline to her own' apartments. Here thefe beloved friends again funk into each other's arm?* and again wept over" their unexplained miferies. At length- the Baronefs exerting herfelf to regain com¬ pofure, fupprcfled her own emotions for a time, as attentively fhe liftened, with fenfa¬ tions indefcribable, to the fad narration of Rofaline's account of her parent's fufferingt,. With grief, indignation, and amazement, Ruithvina heard the harrowing relation, whiih indeed had often been interrupted by the gufts of overwhelming forrow it occa¬ fioned in the breafts of both.

This aflertion gained belief, and Ruithvina lamented it as a,real truth.—* Hence it was that the ufurper's claims to the Lordfhip of his brother was never difputed, and his fuccerlion, as the only remaining branch of the Houfe of Edmondville, ad¬ mitted, and firmly fecured* Ruithvina had not yet married the Baron of Caftlenuco y and the fettled melancholy Which took deep root in her mind, for the irrecoverable lofs of her friends, for a fhort time longer gave her a refpite from the un¬ willing neceffity of becoming his bride $ and

But her paffion, how* ever, had not efcaped the keen perception of Agnes, who was herfelf a jealous* quick- fightcd lover, and too weD acquainted m the myfteries gf the wayward heart, to re* main blinded to the motive of Ruithvina's actions, and fecret, genfive unhappinefs v which, in a being fo young, excited her^ misjudging fufpicions, and her malign, heart found a demoniac gratification in difcovering to Otho that which nothing but her jealoufy could ever have enabled her to have become acquainted with. Hence'it was that Otho early.
early imbibed that unfortunate prejudice, which afterwards led to the commiffion of ads, that even his own vicious heart con¬ demned, and filentiy repulfed; and when, through the indifcreet confidence of Paulina, he arrived to ,the knowledge of whom Sir Alfred in reality was, it ferved to enkindle to a blaze that latent fpark which led him to imagine the fuppofed defedion of Ruith¬ vina from the exalted purity of her en¬ nobled condud, would excufe the pre* meditated blacknefs of his own intended cruelty. The aftonifhment and fecret joy of the Baronefs, on the firft evening of her arrival at the ancient Caftie of Urbandine, in meet* ing a being raifed, as it were, from the dead,. and ever lamented as fuch, can only be con¬ ceived in the event of her unexpeded in¬ terview with an objed fo entirely beloved, lb endearingly regretted, as that which in¬ troduced to the recognition ofa friend, whole abfence and death flie had for ten years deplored*

After this interview, Lord Alfred explained to the Baronefs, in manufcript, fuch parts only of his fufferings ancl concerns as had no reference to thefe dreadful afflic¬ tions, which his oath compelled him never to reveal, while living, to his daughter s to whom Ruithvina had folemnly engaged her¬ felf as a guardian, though alfo binding her¬ felf, by a^i inviolable proaiife to Sir Alfred* ' never to make known to Rofaline the real dignity of her birth, till time, and his own death, fliould have no longer rendered fecrecy neceffary: and the records of Lord Alfred, with the promifed fupport and friendfbip of Rtilrhvins, fteuid, as fix*! « they «r§- found by Rofaline, condud her fafely to thq reftoration of her rights. This moment of el ucklation, Lord Alfred innately felt, was not far diftant - $ but, till it arrived, the Baronefs was not at liberty, from the ftridt promife fbe had made, ever to make knowa the real name and title which Rofaline muft one day ultimately regain poffeffion of*
It
It was m that fatal night that Sir Alfred fo fuddenly quitted the foreft, in fearch of retribution for his own and his unconfcious, daughter^ wrongs, that after his departure from the Abbey, he at midnight met, by a fudden appointment ofhis own, the Lady Ruithvina, in the woods near the northern poftern of the Caftie. Here, in the moft impreffive and folemn manner, he com¬ mitted Rofaline to her friendlhip, and conjured her, by all the regard fhe had once poffeffed for the deceafed Matilda, i^Ot to forfake her child. This was the only meeting that ever took place fince the arrival of either at the Abbey and the CiftSc i\»rf- their parting was .affefting in the extreme-.— Lord Alfred's leave of Ruithvina was folemn and impreffive, from the inward convidion that it was the laft and only time he fliould ever be permitted again to part from a friend fo loved, fince the journey that now occa¬ fioned it, was but the prelude to that; &i bourne from whence no traveller e'er wa$ fuffered
Baronefs's w*as tender to excefs j who, con¬ fcious that flie ftill loved with unabated' affedion and warmth, was now fo deeply agitated, and weakened by forrow, as to be unable calmly to fupprefe the long pain¬ fully reftrained feelings of her heait. It was 1 on this very night that Otho, unexpededfy* returning from the camp, pafled through the- beaten track of the foreft, near the place* where the friends were thu* engaged,«•«** Surprifed at a circumftance fo unufual, he- condefcended to liften to their difeourfe, which the jealous temper of his mind? made him fufpicious of; and though con¬ vinced of the ftrid, unbiemifhed purity and honour of Ruithvina*s words and adions*, and well aflured that this interview was only meant to fecure to Sir Alfred's daughter the: noble friendlhip of the Baronefs, yet did it: roufe various conjedures in hi&mind ; for he refleded that the meeting was a fecret one, and at the hour of midnight—two circum* ftances certainly unfavourable to Ruithvina y and
mnd although well fitted of her innocence of a ] l intentional wrong, and that the requeft of Sir Alfred, at a time fo unkdon ble, originated in his fudden departure, yet did he, with determined malice, treafure the circumftance in his thoughts, and the fubfe- quent tranfactions of ids conduct but too clearly have difplayedthe ungeneious ufc he uiade of it. Ruith/ina had received the lovely Rofa¬ line vvith the affectionate kiudneft of a mo¬ ther, as the child of him for whom alone (lie felt the plow of a conftant and real paf- fion ^ and though ftill conftraincd to keep fecret thofe parts of Lord Alfred's uniinppy fate with which (lie was acquainted, lhe refufed not her approbation to the par* tiality of her Cm for the fufceptible Ro- filine; well knowing that fplcndhlas might be the fortunes of the young Countcfs of Othin, thofe of Rolalinc, or rather Matilda of Edmondville, were, and would be equal, if not fuperiorj a chcumfiance which, in her
her generous bofom, never had found a place to reft on, had flie not known that the mind of Otho was fordid, and, in the choice of his fon's election of a ' fide, the wealthieft was to him the moft preferable* Paulina, in whom pride was a leading principle, had totally funk the name of Helen of Edmondville, in the fuperior title of Countefs of Othin j and hence it was that Ruithvina, who had for fo many years lived in total feclufion and retirement, was unac¬ quainted that the ufiirper Rudolph had found a ftronger fecurity for his guilty enor¬ mities, in the rifing promotion of a higher title, that mafked in greatnefs his long profpered wickednefs i and thus it was that by the politic Otho's introducing Paulina to the Baronefs only as the Countefs of Othin, the latter knew not, till undeceived by Rofaline's relation, that fhe had received to her hofpitality the offspring of the deftroyer, Who had annihilated the happinefs of friends (he
fkt had fo dearly loved, and ferved with the fidelity of the ftrideft friendfhip. Tn liftening to the dark tale of their fuffer¬ ings, the tears of horror and indignation fell with thofe of the weeping Rolaline, as fhe often preffed her to her fofom, and fbared, in idea, the dreadful daugeis the Jatter had been plunged im The injury the Baronefs had fuffered, in being fo degradingly repudiated from her Lord, and compelled to quit the feat of tier great progenitors, would, to f >me minds, have 'been an affliction, under which not e\en the certainty of unbiemifhed innocence could have fupported them; but in the foul of Ruithvina there was a confeioufnefs of reditude and virtue, which proudly and nobly fupported her in an hour ot fuch in¬ jurious trial and iniuh : whilft the only real caufe of gnef ihe fuffered herlelf to expe¬ rience, was in the deep regret flie felt at the impoffibility and iil fuccefs of her effoits to free
free her lovely ward from the dangerous fnares fhe \vell knew were defigned by Otho to attain poffeflion of the orphan heirefs.~ The long abfence of her beloved fon, and the final death of Lord Alfred, were ftrokes which no effort of fortitude could, for a time, overcome ; and the latter, as being an event inevitable and inevocab'e, weighed for a length of time on her foul, and had produced that expreffion of grief fo ftrongly marked on her features, although, till this moment, its fecret had never been dif- lodged from herown fid heart, where forever it would have been buried, if the welcome arrival and confequent confidence of Rofaline had not at length drawn forth the heart* rending coufeffion of its uurevealed fuffer* iritfs. The endearing virtues of the Baronefs had created for her many warm fupporring friends during the time of her unmerited degracation ; and the Fathers of St. Auftin had watc^fuJy guarded her perfon and her fame
feme from the effeds of the Baron's calum¬ nious defigns; but as the pious fubmiffion of Ruithvina had in all things yielded to his tyrannic inflidions, the Monk St. Henry, in whom was vefted the power of fulfilling the edid of the Holy Pontiff, determined - to ad only as the illuftrious honour of her unfuliied charader demanded, and Otho,, for the future, was permitted no longer to triumph in open violation of every law-of truth or juftice, The long feparatcd friends having thus curforily poured into each other's cais a mutual confidence, found -a relief in this balmy lenient for the many afHidions they hr.d fo long endured; but Rofaline, un¬ happy Rofaline 1 was yet doomed to an increafe of wretchednefs, from the cruel kindnefs of the unfufpeding Baronefs, whofe heart now vibrating to the magic touch of hope, plunged ftill deeper the corrofive farg of unrevealed anguifli to the foul of Ma¬ tilda, by the recalled idea of that happinefs vol. iv. & fhe
flic now expreffed fier hopes might yet, though long delayed, reward them all for paft fufferings, in the anxioufly wiflied re¬ turn of her fon from his long myfterious abfence. " Ah, God 1" inwardly ejaculated the haplefs Matilda, " how little, unhappy pa¬ rent of a murdered fon, how little do you imagine he will never again return V* Her heart fwelled almoft to burfting, whilft the anguifli of her mind -fhook her frame to convulfive ftarts of mifery; and now that fhe was no longer withheld by dreadful vows to unburthen the fecret of the guilt of Gondemar, flie was oa the point of undeceiving the vain hopes of the unlufpeding Ruithvina : but her lips trem¬ bled and quivered, and her heart and tongue refufed to pronounce the defpairing fentence. She found no effort of fortitude fufficient for the trial; nor could flie bear to afflid ftili deeper the already ftricken heart
lieart of Ruithvina, who, although delicacy reftrained her from all open expreflions of forrow for the fettled grief fhe in reality en-* durcd, yet was it too apparent to one (b long familiarized with woe, to doubt its cxifting caufe; and flie now trembled for the event, fhould an increafe of forrow be added to thofe that already feemed to have overpowered the (enfitive nerves of her laft only remaining friend. She was therefore unable to reply to the cheeringly meant re¬ marks of the Baronefs ; flie fat the dumb image of curelefs grief, whiift every feeling of her anguiflied foul was torn with con¬ tending emotions of defpair and agony ;—- ruither did ihe dare, at thr> moment, to mah^ known her fixed determination of fpecdily nfluming the lacred profefiloa of a Con¬ ventual life, left fo fudden a refolution fliould occafion a fufpicion of the truth of its caufe, and alarm the Baronefs too abruptly with the fatal certainty of her mifery, and the dif¬ appointment of all her hopes - 9 who now, deeply engaged in planning fchemes for their t 2 future
future happinefs, did not at firft perceive the change that marked the pallid counte¬ nance of Matilda, wh), ftruggling vainly with h^r feelings, no longer could endure their excefs of mifery % ancl her heart ftill obliged to retain the fatal (ecret within her own breaft, rendered the conflict ftill more torturingly affltdive.

one decifive blow, he expeded to regain his fame, and triumph in the pofteffion of thofe glittering honours, which, under the reign of Edward of York, he hoped, by fuch a vidory, ftill to enjoy.

final deftruction* Even the fecurity of its fecret paflcs and weakcft parts were dif¬ covered by its royal foes, who, having, by ftratagem, ta en prifoner one of its out¬ pofts, had gained fufficient information to in fure fucceis. The fignal of battle was given by the in¬ trepid Queen, who, on a fmall eminence, at a little diftance from the Caftie, ftood waving her triumphant banner as flie viewed the havoc of the engagement, and fpirited her foldiers by her preience to the daring enterprife. Otho, from the barbacans ofhis fortifica* tions, in vain thundered down the red hot fire of his cannons on the foe. The lofty height of his battlements fent tlie balls high above the heads of the befiegers, who, unhurt, were fecured in the vale below, and only the diftant woods ot St. Ofwythe weie ftormed by their def >hthg attack.

At length Sir Edieldred, infpired by a new courage, again renewed the attack s
attack; and as their fwords met in fierce contact, he loudly exclaimed— u I figlit for a juft King, and am infpired^ by the injuries of Rofaline, to avenge them/* Otho, provoked at the laft fentencc* raifed his dreadful fword to fell his ad ver* fury j which inevitably had proved fatal to the latter, had not Sir Etheldred warded the blow, a:id in a moment after re¬ gained a double advantage, and cleft in twain the crefted helmet oi Oiho, who, re¬ treating, was as furioufly purfued, yet again made a laft tremendous effort to vanquifh his valiant foe, but was overcome, and funk, weakened from lofs of blood, upon hk knees—-a pofture, however, he not long re¬ mained in j for, forcing Nature herfelf to aid his haughty foul, he rufhed furi- otdy on his he. The detachment offuc- cours, huwxver, had le-animated the army of Sir Ethcidral by their timely arrival, and the battle ngmn raged on either fide with dreadful
dreadful fury and (laughter. At length. the befieged gave over the contention, and precipitately retreated towards the poftern of the fortification that overhung the fea; but with fuch rapidity were they purfued, that fighting backwards as they went, to fecure their retreat, they met an inftantaneous and dreadful death ere they were confcious of their fate; for driven, in tht heat and fury of the fight, to the very brink of the rocky acclivities, and fteeps of the (bore, many of them fell over, and funk, as did their leader, to au inftant md watery grave, who already, nearly van¬ quished, and finking with repeated wounds, was even infenfible in death, ere he had half reached the dreadful gulph of all his prefent, all his after wilhes:—fuch was the fate of Otho. So fierce had been the engagement, that even the victors, from an unconfeioufnefs of their danger, had neaily fliared the fate of the vanquilhed, many of whom lay dead
upon the hanging rocks, half way down their fides j whilft thofe who had fallen into the angry empurpled fea, juft faintly drag¬ gled vvith the waves for a moment, and breathing out their laft (igh, funk inftantly to their gravel The remainder of his people no fooner beheld the fall of their great commander, than, trembling for their own, they gave over all further refift- snee, threvv open the gates of Urbandine, and calling down their arms, fued for mercy. A ceffation of hoftilities was proclaimed by the found of the trumpet; and the Ama¬ zonian Anjou found herfelf amply avenged for the (hame of a late defeat, in theprclent brilliant tucccifcs of fuch a victory. Shouts of triumph reibunded to the heavens, and the towers of lofty Urbandine opened v.ide their gates to the royal conqueror, who, re-, numbering that, in the time of peace, flic had honoured Ruithvina, their noble pro- prietor, with fiicndlhip andeiteem, refigned not
nit the Caftie to the plunder of her foldiery, well knowing that neither the Baronefs nor hi r fon were implicated in the treafonous diiaffcdion of Otho; and her noble mind dildained to inflid on the innocent die pu¬ nifhment due only to the gudty. Having invefted the command oi the gam (on in the hands of one of her warriors, with orders to refign it to the heir of the Caftie, ihe quitted the latter to prepare for her departure to¬ wards the capital. It was on the decline of this day's battle, that, as the Royal Margaret was bellowing the juft honours and praifes due to her va*- liant fupporters and ibldicrs, a ftranger of plain habiliments, but feeming courteous addrefs, arrived at the confines of tlie camp* and eagerly befought admiflion to the royal preience. He wore an helmet unorna- nicnted, and clofely drawn over his face. His form and figure were hid beneath a loofe concealing mantle, depending from the ihoulder, and girded by a ftccl belt entirely round
round him. His apparel, though it befpoke him not of rank, could not difguife a nobi¬ lity of afpcd that was depidured in his whola appearance; whilft the humility and me¬ lancholy that ftrongly marked the lower part of his countenance, feemed to com¬ mand reverence, and engage attention. * Margaret had beheld the ftranger pafs the lines of the camp ; and now, when his requcft was made known to her, commit* iioned her own Knight to condud hi n to her prefence. With graceful etf; and dig* nity of deportment, the ftranger advanced, and kneeling before the Queen, prefented to her a folded paper, which humbly he befought her to perufe. Rather fur- prifed at an adventure fo extraordinary, the warlike Margaret, as flic received ir, caft her commanding eyes piercingly on the proftrate ftranger, then on the paper, which flie at length deigned gracioufly to unfold, and read with caraeft attention. She ftarted, frowned, then

then paufed, and again read the papery when, fixing her eyes more intently on the unknown, lhe earncftly afked— "Canft thou, vvith certainty, prove the truth of what is here deciphered ?

The Queen, placing the paper of the ftranger in the hand of Sir Etheldred, bade him retire with the unknown to perform the execution of its requeft, which Sir Ethel¬ dred, with amazement, read nearly to this effect.—It fpecified, after a ftrong petition to the clemency of the Sovereign, that there were ilill in exiftence indubitable and important teftimonics that Rofaline St. Ofwythe was the wronged inheritrefs of the pofieflkms of Edmondvil!^ and that were mx,
an inveftigation permitted to fearch into the reality of this dark tranfaction, the ftranger, at the forfeit of his life, promifed' to produce fuch proofs as fliould incon- teftibly eftahlifh the truth of his bold after- tions, and reftore the long injured heirefs to* her ancient rights. The Royal Margaret, as flie perufed this myfterious paper, remembered that to the* magnanimity of Rofaline St. Ofwythe, in. a moment of extreme danger, fhe was be¬ holden for the prefervation of her own and her fon*s life and* liberty ; and her princely. bofom, not flo^v to recollect a fervice of fucb eminence, with fatisfadion received the account of the ftranger's petition, anxious* to load with royal favours a being for whctin* fhe filt an efteern warmer than that whiclv tlie fervice fhe had rendered, created. For- tunatelv for the caufe of Rofaline, Sir Ethel- dred was the Chief deputed vvith royal power. to execute the mandates of her will.
As*
As foon as the latter had read the paper, he turned to the ftranger, and, with a tone of pleafure and triumph, demanded how he was to proceed 5 adding, (C I am -iiiyfelf well acquainted with the prefent <abodeof the lovely Rofaline, and flia'l njjice in being made the inftrument of her ex¬ altation " " Mother of God 1" eagerly, and with strong emotion of voice and manner, inter¬ rupted the ftranger, * 6 am I indeed io fortu¬ nate to meet in you, Sir Kniglit, the only being who could perhaps diied my anxious fearcn for the hap.efs wanderer. Oh fpeak ! tell me did die indeed alive efcape the hor¬ rid den of the robbers f" Sir Etheldred, amazed at fuch a quellion, now turned, with increafed cunotity, to the myfterious ftranger, who he now con¬ cluded muft either have been a prifoner of the robbers, or elfe a robber himfelf, and had found means to efcape the cavern by fome unknown outlet* He was, however, unable
unable to judge truly, for the ftranger had clofed the vifor ofhis helmet; and when he had a'ifwcred his laft demand, remained to¬ tally fdent to the queftions which Sir Ethel¬ dred in turn would have had anfwered ;-* only faying, with an impreffive tone, as he gave the ring of the Queen to the latter— i( I am myfelf fettered, from circumftan¬ ces unneccfiary to be explained, openly to •appear the champion of injured virtue ; but to thee, Sir Etheldred, I refign that envi¬ able title. As thou regardeft the honour of un ftained Knighthood, I charge thee neg¬ lect not the power vvith which our gracious Sovereign has invefted thee, and at the hour % appointed, the found of the trumpet fliall be the figral when I will again appear to make good the truth of what 1 have depo- fed—when the fcene of long triumphed vil¬ lany and urqu'tv (hall be brought to light, and the arm of Juftice at length redrefs the wrongs of oppicited innocence.'*
With
With thefe words, delivered in a flow and almoft awfully ex pre 01 ve tone and manner, the ftranger flightly bowing, quitted the fpot, and fuddenly gliding among the tents ©f the foldiery, wao inftantly loft to fight* Sir Etheldred hid liftened, with atten* tion and wonder, to tlic fore^oioo; inftruc- tions of the ftranger, who had directed him to the Abbey of Sh Ofvythe, as being ihe prefent refidence of Paulina of Othin ; but the latter pait of his words, and the folem- nity of tlv/ir delivery, rivet!ed him, as it were, in amazement, to the fpot. He had marked the pale countenance cf the ftranger on his finl ;u*iival at the royal teat; and now found himfcif inefiliiblv imuclled to comtjly widi injunctions which, tliwr.^h they were myfterious, were fo peculiarly impreffive, that he hefitated not an' iallant to obey them. There was in the foul of Sir Ethtldred a principle of chivalry and love of gaibnc exploit,
ploit, that was alone the ruling directed of all his actions; and to redrefs the wrongs of the injured, and deftroy, wherever he found it, the power of oppreffion, was one of the chief employments of his life ; nrr did his valour and activity ever flumber in the defence of innocence and virtue : whilft, in becoming the champion of the lovely Rof dine, whom he regarded with a paflion the moft ardent and finccte, he was raifed to the very fummit of his wiflies ; and*from its confequences he drew the happieft pre* fages of fuccels to his future hopes, that from the tender affiduity of his unwearied love, he might yet be rewarded with a hap¬ pier conclufion to his perfifting importu¬ nities. Having difpatched proper mif- fionaries to fummon Paulina on the morrow to appear at the royal ttnt % he haftened him* felf to communicate to Rofaline the change fo likely foon to take place in her concerns, and to conduct her himfelf to the appointed ftation of the expected trial,
The
The' cares of the Baronefs had recalled Rofaline to animation and feeling.— They were both mutually employed on pleafing and painful retrofpection, when their feclufion was broken in upon by the entrance of Sir Etheldred, who, in joyful terms, hailed Rofaline Baronefs of Ed¬ mondville, and explained the aftonifh- ing meaning of his unexpected vifit.— A fudden trembling and violent agitation (hot through the heart of Lady Rofaline, as Qif liftened to this wonderful account j and for a few moments it fo far fufpended her faculties, that fhe funk unrefiflingly on the bofom of the Baronefs, who, having, with joyful emotion, heard Sir Etheldred'* rela¬ tion, now, in a few words, related to the latter every particular concerning Rofa¬ line, as well as her parent's unhappy ftory $ and as the finiflied this undeniable teflimony, which indeed verified in his mind the actions of the (Iranger, flie declared her re¬ folution to accompany the Baronefs Matilda {for fuch in future Ihe in right muft be vot,. iv* m entitled)
entitled) to the throne of Margaret, as a fure fupport er of the wronged orphan's claim! to the juftice and retribution (he had Cq Jong been defpoiled of* But Rofa¬ line felt no touch of joy in the opening profpects which promifed her a reward for all her paft fufferings i the only wi(h oi her foul was the hope, that in the facred" and peaceful ieclufion of a monadic life, (he might be permitted to regain that only chance of meutal compofure, which in thi& world was all. (lie had to expect of felicity t and with a degree of refolution and forti* tude, that fpoke the ftrength of her mind, flie declared her determination never again to expofe herfelf to the horrors and dangers from which ihe had efcaped j adding, that as (lie well knew every document of her pla'tns was loft, (he never meant again to enter rhe buiy fcen.% or diipute with Heka Paihina hei j uft inheritance. This refolution, however, was foon over¬ ruled by her two friends. Sir Etheldred de¬ clared
dar^d that the mandate of the Queen for her appearance on the fucceeding morrow, muft not be difputedj and the Lady Ruithvina reminded her that in this &iio- nifhing, unlookfedfor turn of her affairs, ihe was called updn, by duty and affection, to> eftablifih the fame and honour of her parents* as well as redrefs, if it fhould prove the means were in her power, the dreadful -in¬ juries they had fuftained. This laft argu- ment ^ad its defired effect. She recalled to mind the ftrong, and even folemn in-* junction contained in her father's p&jjers for that purpoie, and (he no longer refufed to comply with the wifhesof her friend. Sir Etheldred, promifmg early on the enfuing morning to be at the Abbey, now took his leave j and Rofaline, filled with agitating fears, retired to her pallet, but not to fleep for a length of time. She lay reflecting on the events of her life, and the confequences of the fucceeding morrow.—- The recovered fplcndours of wealth and u 2 title
title could npt reftore ruined happinefs fc* her heart, or fill the gloomy vacuum which the loft Conftantine had left. She felt alfo<that,a$he was too furely loft to her for eyer, tjte walls t of a convent were now the onty boundaries of her wifhes, and beyond tlieir utmoft limits fhe had no wifli to pafs, fipce ^ world to her afforded no profpect to comfort a mind de&d ti> every fenfe of happinefts not had, it power to charm her to a longer fojoqrn inrit \ but fince the re- merqbrance of her parent's wrongs now loudly cried for retribution and redrefs, flie refolved to fummon to her aid the fortitude of injured virtue, and obey the laft only commands of th*t parent, whofe memory was dearer to her heait than all the world befides; and when ihe ihould have performed tlris„ pious duty, ihe would no lorser he fit ate to declare to the Baronefs the dread ul fecret that corroded on her heart a d take f r ever the facred vows of n^onafUc fwdufion.
She
She arofe early 5 and having habited her fine form in flowing robes of deep mourning, defcended to the parlour of the Abbey, where awaited the Baronefs and Sir Ethel¬ dred, who delicately endeavoured to cheer a&'^ encourage the lovely orphan for the enfuing fcene; but Rofaline trembled in¬ wardly as fhe recollected againft whom it was Che was about to prefer the claims of juftice, as the living avenger of her fariier's wrongs; and though ihe exprefled, by grateful looks, her fenfe of the trindnefs of her friends, fhe made no effort to Ipeak, fince the inward agitations of her mind de¬ nied her the ufe of language to exprefs her feelings which were deeply afflictive, frovtx the refult of c.rcumftanees fo painfully dif- trefling to remember. She for 4 long time endeavoured to conjecture who was the myfterious ftranger that had occafioned the fenfations his wondeiful conduct gave birth to. At length fhe remembered the laft: tranfactions of the cave of robbers, in which one of them, who called himfelf Philip, m 3 boldly
boldly ftood up in her defence, and who^ flie now doubted not, was the promoter of thefe ftrange proceedings! for fhe recol- leded, in her father's records, he had more than once been the preferver of both their lives 5 and from his aftonifhing queftions in the cavern, fbe, with certainty, concluded him to be the unknown who had thus fud¬ denly ftood forth theredreffor of her injuries. And now infpired with the pious fervour of filial love, fhe regained that compofure, and firmnefs in the trying fcene fhe was about to enter upon, which alone could have fupported her under fuch circumftances, fince, confcious of innate reditude and in¬ nocence, and thus upheld by friends fincerely devoted to her fervice, tbe refolved not to defert her own caufe in the moment of ap¬ proaching neceffity; and though fhe felt, on her own account, indifferent as to the favourable iffue of the event (fince, could her claims not be jufHfied, and fhe herfelf ftill were doomed to fink beneath the op- preflions
pre/Eons of a perfecuted fate) fhe had"ftill one peaceful alternative in ftore, where all the reft of her days to come would at leaft: be peace, and where fhe ihould be fecured for ever from the cruel perfecutions of a profperous, unrelenting enemy. With & mind inwardly calmed by thofe aids which virtue lends, the affiided Ro¬ faline once more quitted the Monaftery, aud accompanied*by powerful friends and fupporters, purfued her way to the auguft prefence of the Monarch* The morning was uncommonly beauti¬ ful ; and the fun, with refulgent, unclouded glory, Ihoue bright on the finning fcene, invigorated and enlivened by his golden beams. All Nature wore a face of joy, and myriads of voices carolled their glad war- blings to the vault of their great Creator ; — all around was harmony and peace ; and the tbundera of war, that but the day before had fhpok the foreft with its dread rebound, * - * * - m 4 now
now flept in a calm and dead repofe. Roft* line felt 4he fweet contraft dilate her forrow- ful heart witli unufual ferenity % and m fhe proceeded through the beloved woods of her own domain, (he experienced a pleafing, painful, tender thrill of joy at the appear¬ ance of fcenes fo doubly endeared to her memory and fight, becaufe fbe n?ever ex* peded again to behold them.

But vain and futile are the foundations of ambition, when built on a foil that has not virtue for its fup* port:—the attainment of its wifhes may, for % time, dazzle reafon, in the outward glare of fplendour and acquired grandeur; but the inward monitor of the heart will damp, with its upbraidings, the crime-ftained mind, and render* unfubftantial, the joys t© which it bad

The
The morning came with all its cheerful attributes. A large open pavilion wa$ pitched in the middle of the plain; and in a regal chair, placed under a canopy of ftate, fat the auguft confort of Royal Henry, the judge and decider of the approaching trial* Her majeftic peffon was cloathed m flowing robes of gold and purple; her veft and ihoulder were incafed in a richly emboffed filver armour, ftudded with jewels and pre* cious (tones -, whilft her brows fuftained a helmet of gold, encircled by a triple tiara, that was ibrmounted by a towering plumage of golden coloured purple and white feathers^ and, as (he fat upon the feat of judgment* (lie looked awful in majefty, as (lie had proved herfelf great in arms* Near to her throne flood the Senefchal of Normandy, the Earl of Clifford, with the Dnke of Suffolk, and others of her noble warriors; whilft^ on the other fide, ftood the ladies of her fuite, with her train-bear* ers, ftandards, and war trophies* The line& of
of the pavilion wert filled and -crowded by the Ofiicers, Knights, and fuppon^s, that had long fought tbe battles of their Illuftri¬ ous Sovereign, Helen, haughty and inficxib'e Helen, trembled as fhe was led through the multi¬ tude of fpeftators to the prefence of the Queen. Fears, unfelt before, now filkd her Ibul, and racked it with ail the terrors of a guilty confcience* She bowed humbly to the throne, as the commiftkmers concluded her to the fmall raifed gallery appointed for her to fit in* Timidly (he caft her eyes around* and, in the extraordinary prepara¬ tions, and fcrutinizing glances that every where met her eyes, both from the order of the Court, and the look of the fpeftators turned peculiarly on herfelf, (he trembled at die reality of approachingdanger, and now felt her heart fill with horrid doubts that Agnes had deceived her with a falfe account of Rofaline*5 death. But how was the cer¬ tainty of thofe doubts, and the horror and defpair
defpair it occafioned augmented, when, frorm a little diftance, flie perceived the well* known perfon of the injured Matilda, fup¬ ported by the Baronefs of Urbandine and Father St. Henry, attended by feveral vene* table Monks, approach the royal pavilion. Matilda was indeed advancing* The: wronged orphan of an oppreffed mid ruinedi fire, acting from the principles of love and nature, had laid afide, for a moment, all the* weaker fejcoal feoftbiliues of a too iuXcep- tible heart, refolved firmly to perform an ad of duty before every $iher confideratioii of fel&conccra * and entering the royal; tent with the dignified confcioufneft o£ iinfullied rectitude and purity, ftie pro** ftrated herfelf before the throne- of the; Queen* who, with a gracious Xrnile, en¬ couraged and raifed her,, and bade ,het* hope for juftice and redrefs.—*A recep*. tion fa fla|tering gave her additional con*, rage* and bowing low and gracefully to* di the Court, fhe was conducted by Su, Henrf
Henry to the ftand appointed for her by th© Herald of the Queen. The illuftrious Ruithvina, having paid her homage to the Monarch, was gracioufly received ; and after fome time converfing with Margaret, (lie crolied the circle of ther pavilion, and joined Matilda, who, in a mo* ment, feemed to have engaged and won the admiration and pity of every beholder pre¬ fent. . Her iable (lowing robes fot offthe fine fymmerry of her perfon $ and her fea-* tures, bearing the (lamp of melancholy iuf* fering, created in the fpectators an univerial refpect; whilft the mild fpeaking eloquence- of her eyes, though long robbed of their brilliant luftre, fpoke in an expreilive language fo interfiling* that thofe of the Court, who were acquainted with her inju-» ries, caft glances of marked contempt and reproach upon Paulina, whilft on Matilda tbey were turned with reverence and com-* laUeration.
The
The intrepid Queen Margaret, acquaintecl with the injuries of Muilda, had graciouflf refolved to trace, if poffible, the dark deeds of the. Earl of Othin to their fpring and fou>ce; and in the full expedation that the claims of the injured orphan would be in¬ difputably eftahlilbed, fhe had determined herfelf to be the adminiftrator, of juftice, for fhe had recognized, in the perfon of Ma¬ tilda, a being who poffeffed a foul capable of the moft magnanimous and exalted adions. No fooner had the murmuring whifpers of audible applaufe ceafed, which the ar* rival of Matilda in the Court had occafioned, than Margaret, making a fignal to the Herald of Arms, the latter, ta the name of his auguft miftrcfs, demanded aloud of Paulina her name and title. Paulina, now trembling, pale, and almoft fubdued, had fupported herfelf only by m effort of uncommon pride, from finking to

But what words can exprefs the painful excefs of tranfport and joy that filled the long benighted foul of Matilda, which, as flie again recovered to fenfe, and conviction that what (lie had beheld was nality, and not a delufiye, tranfitory vifion of fancy, roilied, like an overwhelming torrent, through her brain, and almoft whirled the umpire of reafon from its throne;—- for when, with much difficulty and tender affiduity, (he was again recovered to fenfe and

of Matilda, to whom maybe attributed the prefervation of Conftantine's life, fince it is but too probable that, had Gondemar fuf¬ peded his firft blow was not fatal, it would again have been repeated. The wound, though deep and ftunning to the apparent fenfe of jife, was not mortal; and Harold, when left to the difpofal of the body from the dreadful chamber of murder, found, on his attempt to remove it, fome faint breath¬ ings of life ftill remaining. Shocked at the bloody deed, to which he had been mutely acceffary, and now feeling fo'me touch of remorfe awrake his confcience to penitence for tlie heinous ac"L he refolved to make fome atonement, and preferve, if poffible, the life which ftill remained in the body of the murdered Conftantine—an under¬ taking of extreme difficulty to perform, fince he dared not betray the fecret of his employer, by procuring other aid than his own. With much .trouble, however, he fucceeded in conveying Conftantine to one of the fecret caverns of the fubterraneous vaults
vaults of the Caftie, where, applying a powerful ftiptic to the dangerous wound of his prifoner, he ftanched its bleeding, and Conftantine to his care owed the preferva* tion of his recovered exiftence; but when* after a few days, he found himfelf fufficiently reftored to fpeech and realon, and demanded to be removed from the cold dreary cham¬ ber of a rocky cell to the comforts of the interior of the Caftie, he difcovered that the former was to be the extent of his liberty; and although Harold, in a moment of penitence, had preferved his life, yet was this proof of mercy purchafed at the total lofs of freedom ; fincc 9 as he was bound by ties, the moft horrid and indiffoluble, to the interefts ofhis impious employer, he wa& refolved never to reftore Conftantine to liberty, nor ever difcover him to his brother; whofe dreadtul vengeance, had he known of Conftantine's exiftence, would fiave been tlie lure tiled of hi* (Harold's) deftrudion. He therefore kept fiknt on a fecret of fuch fatal iuiport to himielf,as well n 6 as
as to his Lord, whofe charader and unre-i lenting nature he was too well acquainted with to hope to efcape the confequences, fliould he reveal the part he had aded in Conftantlne's prefervation: and that his own life might be fecured alfo from the effeds which a difcovery on either fide niight have occafioned, he immured his captive in one of the deepeft receffes below the foundations of the rocks themfelves, where not the fmalleft particle of Heaven's light and air had ever been admitted. Here, with only a pallet of ftraw, and a feanty fupply of provifions, did he fecure his cap¬ tive % and as he well knew that the caverns were often frequented by Gondemar, he permitted not even the poor indulgence of a lamp to cheer the gloomy horrors of a dreadful midnight darknefs, left, through fome unknown crevice of tlie rock, its rays fhould difcover the fecret that was concealed within. There was no other entry to this den of darknefj but through the trap ofa fmall cavity, which, having a mov¬ ing 3
ing ladder of fteps to its defcent to the bottom, Harold, at pleafure, drew them up whenever he returned from his vifit to the unfortunate prifoner, and thus fecured every poffible chance of his efcape. Touched* however, with fomething like companion, Harold, after much entreaty, permitted the young Baron to pafs from his cell, and have the exercife of his limbs, in a fliort parade, at certain hours, through the vaulted paflages of the rocks, from one of whofe fmall openings, whicii faintly admitted a pro- fpeft of the fea, he often partook the air of its refrelhing breezes* In an indulgence of this nature Harold knew he was well fe¬ cured from all fear of his captive's effecting an efcape, fhould he even make the attempt; fince he was too much weakened and ex¬ haufted from the lofs of blood his wound had occafioned, and which, being in the fide near the heart, rendered it impoflible for him to endure the flighted exertion, that would have favoured fuch a defign,
About
About the middle of the perpendicular fea cliffs, on which the Caftie ftood, was a fmall hollow opening, whofe cavity was concealed by an overhanging projedion of rock, that ran in an extendvc diredion along the (hore^ though confiderahly above thefurface of the waters, or the lower recefTes where Con¬ ftantine was confined. Hither the latter^ accompanied by Harold, often came; and to the reviving exhalation of air, and exer- cife, he owed his flow, though fure reftoration to health, and the ufe of his limbs | but as the ftrength of his corporeal ailments be* came more invigorated, the torture of his mind augmented. His thoughts, tenderly bent on Rofaline, found increafe of mifery in the certain apprehenfion of her danger, and the impoflibility of his being able to preferve her from the dreaded evils which the well-remembered words of Gondemar threatened her with. To fuch a pitch of diftraftion and diiorder was his mind redu¬ ced, at the bare idea of what had been her late,
ANCIENT RECOR0S. Ijg fate, that, finking on his knees before Harold, he befought him, with all the earneft eagernefs of defpairing entreaty, and , every offered, every promifed bribe that riches could beftow, to be reftored once more to freedom, with a folemn affurance to fcreen him from the vengeance of his Lord, and in future take the care of his for¬ tunes and perfon under his own protedion. Harold, however, was immoveable to every promife of aggrandizement or riches. He had already fo deeply familiarized his foul with guilt, that his mind, degraded to its pradice, was loft beyond the power of mercy or virtue to reclaim it * whilft the only real quality he poffeffed, was fidelity to an im¬ pious employer, which, had it been prac~ tifed in an honourable caufe, might have redeemed his chaiader, and proved he had ftili fome fenfe of innate goodnefs left. I le was, however, inexorable to the petitions of Conftantine, and repelled, with fierce threats, his attempts to bend fo hard a hcarf to pity and nature. Some
a8o" AHCIENT ItEOOUBS, Some days from this period paffed in lift* lefs, torpid forrow* At length Harold,, finding, from the affairs of the Caftie, that Lord Gondemar would never be its owner, became, on a fudden* more relaxing iti hi$ behaviour to his haplefs prifoner, for now it was that he found Gondemar had deceived him, when the latter,, to procure his aid in the murder of his brother, had affured his agent, that as foon as he became poffeffed of the Lordfhip of Urbandine, he, Harold, fhould be rewarded with a fhare of one third of its immenfe hoards, as a compenfation for the afliftance he fhould lend in the only means that could fecure to either their blood-bought purchafe, but of which every hope was fruftrated, in the Baron's divorce from the heirefs of Urbandine, v^hoie for¬ tunes and tides again returned to their orl* ginal inheritors, and were totally hindered from any of the heirs oi Caftlenuco, En¬ raged at this difappointment, Harold lif* tened attentively to the perfuafions of Con» ftantine, who, well knowing that he muft never
never exped to be reftored voluntarily to freedom, had formed in hh mind a final! fchemefor the fecurity of the haplefs Rofa¬ line, whom he meant, though myfterioufly, to proted from the defigns of Gondemar.— At length Harold, upon certain conditions, ennfented to their enforcement, though he took good care that his vidim fhould be deprived of every means of efcape y and having fuft bound him, by folemn oaths, never to attempt the difcoveiy of himfelf, he next proceeded to confine his arms and legs with leathern thongs, fo as to prevent him from running, or mak¬ ing any kind of refiftance j yet ftill to give fufficient liberty to the joints of his limbs, as alfo to permit of their ufe and pliancy, whilft with a loaded piftoi in each hand, held clofe to the perfon of Conftan¬ tine, he confented to his revifiting the Foreft of St* Qiwythe,and even the Abbey, although the latter place but feldom j—for after Ro¬ faline's return to the Caftie, he confined hii \ifits to its eaftern chambers and towers, tliat, by a fecret paffage, had an inlet to^ thofe
thofe which (he inhabited, and to the various* departments that ran round the galleries and walls of the ftmcture. Harold, difappointed in the immenfe re¬ wards which Gondemar had proirifed him, became lefs obdurate to the offers of Con* ftantine; and though he ftili dreaded the vengeance of the former, and was withheld, by the apprehenfion of its confequence, from difcovering to him the exiftence of his bro¬ ther, yet, as he reflected that Conftantine, from fome fudden turn of his affairs, might again be retrieved from fo dreadful an im* prifonment, the juftice of his anger towards the perfon who had fo long held him a cap* five, might be as equally perilous as that which he dreaded from Gondemar:—he therefore refolved to be lefs rigid in his de¬ portment, that, (hould a change take place, he might fecure to himfelf tho giatitude and' forbearance of Conftantine for the former inhuman actions of his conduct. Prom/ tliis felfifh motive, therefore, he complied in
part with the wiflies of the young Baron ;— and having after the manner which ha« been defcribed, fecured his prifoner from all chance of efcape, and alio bound him, by folemn oath, never tod»fcover himfelf,mould he be fcm by any of the inhabitants of the Caftie, in fuch vifits as his jailer allowed him to make, Conftantine, under thefe reftrto- tions, again was pei nutted tiie tafte of a temporary freedom* It was the night on which he death of Matilda was attempted, that, guide by an over-ruling Providence, Conftantine vifited the fecret palfages of the Caftie, and at a diftance purfued the form of Gondemar, as it funk through a fmall open pannel in the wainfcot of the veftibule, which opened into the chambers of Matilda. Forgetting, In a moment of fuch intereft to his heart and love, the reftriclions under which he was bound, he was rufhing into the chamber, when Harold, \vl&> was always the attendant of thefe midnight occupations, prefenting he
the inftruments of death to his prisoner's breaft, fwore, with horrid imprecations, to ftrike him dead on the inftant, if he be¬ trayed him* Conftantine knew full well the danger of provoking his jailer, and the fatal impoflibility of preferving his de¬ voted Rofaline, fhould he difcover himfelf as realty living to her reaiorfelefs lover; for, weakened by his former wound, and now totally defencclefs, and with his arms and legs confined, it was impoflible that he could withftand two foch foes as Gondemar and Harold, whofe dagger, though its firft ftroke had not been fetal, would doubtleft, if he provoked its repetition, clofe on him for ever the fcem of life: whilft Harold* trembling with his dread ofa difcovery, yet not daring openly to oppofe the adions of his prifoner, left himfelf fhould be betrayed, fuffered his captive to pafs through the fecret entry to the interior of the chamber, and concealing himfelf in a dark angle of the paffage, awaited, with fear and terror, the event*
event, yet deeply repentant for the indul¬ gence he had granted. The fuppofed fupernatural appearance of Conftantine awed the dreadtul purpotes of Gondemar, who never fufpeded, in the re* appearance of his brother, that he beheld the reality, and not the flndow of a guilty- fraught confcience; whilft Conftantine, convinced that his own fifetv depended on maintaining, uurevealed, the delufion under which Gondemar was deceived, at a diftance followed the latter to the chamber of the eaft tower, where, for the better protedion of the haplefs orphan, he had pronounced, in awful folemnity, thofe terrific words, whofe fuppofed preternatural breathings had implanted in his guilty foul the horrors of a temporary remorfe, rendering irrefolute all his dark defigns; and, in a moment of exquifite, terrific retribution, he had flown, as the laft re fource of his crimes, to the den of robbers, as the only fecurity fiom the fancied puntihmems that avenging juftice had
had prepared for his blood-ftained enormi¬ ties. Harold, freed from his fears, and well proteded againft every effort his prifoner might make for his reftoration to liberty, now began to feel fome touches of compaf- fion, and often permitted his captive the free ufe of the vaulted boundaries of the caverns* It was in melancholy diforder of mind that Conftantine, pacing the bowels of the earth, had wandered from the Caftie recefleb to thofe of the Abbey, where he once had, by a fecret department, been imperceptibly led into the woods, and va¬ rious parts of the ruins* Thefe he had tra- verfed at midnight with feniatbns not to be defcribed; and as often as his keeper would permit, made them his favourite retorts. At other times his nights were fpent in the caverns that overhung the rocky declivities of the fteeps, where, in melancholy harmony, he foothed the forrows of his mind by an exertion of thofe vocal talents Nature
Mature had fo largely endowed him witl|; ^nd his mind, loft in a vertex of grief and defpair, broke forth in fadly penfivc melo« dies, whofe melting ,oul breathed fir uns exprcffive of the fufferings of a mind difeafed and unhappy j whiift echo was herfelf re¬ echoed through the fpacious lofty caverns, where he fung and reverberated, in dying* fweet refponfes, the drains, whofe en¬ chanting founds captivated the fafcinateel, wondering fancy, and impelled belief that fuch fcuWiibduing breathings were of more than mortal execution. Twice had Con* ftantine myfterioufly warned Matilda; and his was the mufic which, at her efcape from the Caftie, fhe had liftened to with fuch en* rapt attention i but Conftantine, when informed by Harold of her dilappearance from the Caftie, fearfully fufpeding that the was in the power of G< ndema% was rufhing, in mad defpair, from his dungeon, in tlie faint hope of outfpcediug his fierce jailer, and once more, if poffible, of regaining Jus own and his Matilda's freedom. The attempt,
attempt, however, was impoflible; for his limbs, enchained, forbade the effort. He fell; and Harold, again forcing back his captive, for a long time denied him every little advantage lie had till then allowed him, morofely increafing the rigour of his dread¬ ful imprifonmenl:, and regardlefs alike of the threats of the injured noble youth, as he was deaf to the voice of pity : and Con¬ ftantine, vainly ftruggling with his chains, was foon convinced how neceffary was a calm and patient fubmiffion to an evil which he had not power to withftard ; and at length he fo far fucceeebd in all outward appearance of refignation to his fate, that Harold, after long entreaty, was again prevailed on to permit his former indul¬ gences. Conftantine, well affured that Matilda had really departed from the Caftie, no longer confined his midnight wanderings to y the eaflern chambers; and though totally unconfcious that, at the Abbey, the haplefs Rofaline
.Rofaline was indeed a prifoner, yet thither he bent his melancholy excurfions, where, for hpurs, he ftrolled round each favourite" fpot, that had been the rcfort ofhis beloved Matilda; and certain it is that had he known, whilft gliding through the ruins of St. Ofwythe, his voice had attraded the attention of Rofaline on the night that flie had heard it, whilft employed in the fruitlefs effort to efcape her prifon, he would have braved the danger of Harold's piftols, and ftruggled once more for his own and his Matilda's freedom. But unconfcious that he was fo very near the objed of all his - never-eeafmg cares and love, he, at the ac- mftorned hour, obeyed the command ofhis" keeper, and returned again to his dreary prifon > whilft, from the affuraniui of Harold, that Rofdinc was free from the rower of Gondemar, his mind be^an asratu gradually to recover' as much eafe on her account as the gloomy flate of citgjmfLnces would admit.

It
It is here proper to explain that Harold was well acquainted with the adions and defigns of Gondemar, who, though he ftill retained himfelf as a domeftic of the Caftie of Urbandine, where the latter had com¬ manded him to remain a fjpy upon its tranf- a&kms, was yet the conftant attendant of his Lord even in the ruins of the Caftie of St Ofwythe 5 and it fo happened that on the very night the banditti received their final punifhment and fate, he was himfelf a witnefs of his matter's death, as well as bis affociates: for Harold had entered, with his employer, the den of the robbers, and, by his repeated demands for the promifed rewards of his former iniquitous adions, Jerved, as a retributive vengeance in the mind of Gondemar, for the blood-ftained crimes of his guilty deeds j and the flave, 'whom he had made his. inftrument of murder, now became alfo, by the juftice* dealing arm of Providence, an inftrument of puniihment to his fratricide mafter, who* unable to repay the promifed accurfed bribe by
hy which he had bought the confcience of hh agent, how felt an exquifite pang of re¬ quiting mifery in the fears that filled his mind, left his dark accomplice (hould be¬ tray the fecret of his guilt* Harold, as has been before explained, had witneffed the final penalty of his Lord's enormities j and now it was that he refolved to infure his own fiature fafety, by reftoring the injured Baron voluntarily to hisjiberty 1 and hurry¬ ing to the dungeon ofhis captive, he made fuch ierms as Conftantine, in the over* whelming joy of recovered freedom, hefita* ted not to accede to* It may be remembered that Conftantine, on the fatal night of his entry into the eaftern chambers, had difcovered fome papers that had deeply engaged his atten¬ tion s and whatever were their contents, he bad no fooner regained his liberty, than, haf- tening to the royal tent, he aded as has already been feen : for although he had been well informed, from Harold, of all the events o % that
thif paffed hi the Caftie during hii inapri-* fmment, hehad grfered ov>r the jndtgm- ties 6f his iliotheri and learned alfo the fates of the B&fon and his brother ; and greatly as he venerated the former, yet the wrongs of his Rofaline fbperfeded every other affedion of his heart, and demanded an inftant redrefs, which even the procfa$ tination of an hoUrmight totally deftroy the hope of; and ere he revealed himfelf, he refolved to appeal to the bnly power from whence a hope of fpeedy retribution was to be obtained. His joy /in once more clafp* ing to his bofom an objed fo tenderly be* loved, can only be truly conceived by heaits in unifon with fuch exalted feelings, but the power of language would render futile an attempt fb vain to defcribe it ; whilft the Baronefs at length arrived at the real know** ledge of what had been the fate of her fon-** wept, by turm, with horror, joy, and won** der, at his fufferings and miraculous efcape and prefervation—a thoufand times praifing that all-merciful Being who had fo wtmder*. 1 fully,

Lord Alfred, impelled from the.tfcftJefe and doubting ftate of his mind, and perhaps really fearful of what would be the event if Matilda difcovered not, or was deprived of * the Records he had concealed in the cheft ia the vaults of the Abbey, had, from thefe and fimilar prophetic feelings, placed thefe late difcovered papers in the cabinet of the eaftern chamber of the Caftie, where they mere fo wonderfully difcovered by Con¬ ftantine.

Conftantine had learned fiom the Baronefs Rukhvina the fufferings of hk adored Rofaline; and, not doubting that this was the object fo affectingly defcrifoed in the records of Lord Alfred, he, with re* verential delicacy to the feeling? and peace of Ms angel daughter, had fearched the myf- tcry of the cheft, and in it found the ccfe of a fkeleton. No doubt could be entertained as to whom it had belonged; and at length the remains of this unhappy victim of jealoufy and love were pioufiy laid by the fide of their deceafed partner. The filial tribute of forrow was largely paid by* Matilda in this laft office of duty to the obfequies of her murdered mother % and her heart, relieved from the weight of thia frffRicfcing circumftanee, now began intper* ceptibly to recover from the heavy preffure of thofe forrows that nearly had bowed her wtth despair to the tomb.

The munificence of the Baronefs of Ed¬ mondville, though little deferved, purfued her with a lifter's care and love even here $ and to her mild influence Paulina, owed many indulgences that the ftridnefs of die order would elfe have forbidden, and- her utmoft wiflies were, with lavifh profufenefs, ever fupplied. But Paulina was incapable of feeling or tendernefs; fhe curfed thefe proofs of forgivenefs in an injured* fifter § and, till the final clofe of her ill-governed life brought her at length to a fenfe of her crimes, fhe continued to wifh that fhe had never fuffered imaginary terror to ftay the uplifted dagger from the means of filencing for ever the hated being who had deprived her of rank, riches, fame, and liberty.

The ce¬ remony ended, the hall fhook with repeated peals of joy from the happy tenantry and vaffals, and Matilda became indiffoiubJy the partner of ber adoring Conftantine; and if^ for a moment, an unwelcome thought on the paft would intrude its way to her me¬ mory, and fend the tear of regretted filial affedion to her eye, or the figh heaved gently to the recollcdion of her father's fuf¬ ferings, accompanied by a wifh that a being fo loved had lived to have been rewarded for his paft fufferings, they were but the fuf¬ ceptible emanations of confcious prefent Jiappinefs, that defired not to fhare alone that exquifite

" We part but for a brief season,' said the gratified lover " Bear up, dearest the wings of love outstrip the vv ings of the wmd When 1 return to San Angelo, we part no more " My prayers will bear thee fello vship, my heart, my liopes, will journey with thee, sighed the tendei Rosilita " At matin and vesper song, I sliall think ot thee, Arthur—ah, vvhen shall I not think of thee ' ' " When the evening stir twinkles in the blue sky, vvhen the lull moonshine dances on the light wave, then, Rosalita, worshipped Rosalita, be our thoughts one, then let us apostrophize each other, then, flymg from all the world can urge or offer, let us gare upon tne same bnght planet, and muse upon the same fond hope' " Ay. until vve meet again, and Rosa¬ lita sobbed in the paitmg embrace of her lover Thrice he turned away, and thrice he returned
returned and folded her anew in that fond and parting embrace, for it felt as though life and spirit were passing from him, as though the vvorld, and the vvorld s hopes, were fading swift away He bared her polished biow, he kissed off the tears which gemmed her full-orbed eyes ; anxi¬ ously, eagerly, he gazed upon " the ap¬ paritions of her cheek," for the rose flush¬ ed and faded, alternately glowing, alter¬ nately yielding to the lily's sway —" Of a truth,' and he sti ove at pleasantry, " one would suspect me starting on pilgrimage to distant Asia, rather than to the peace¬ ful haunts of my ovvn hereditary home Sure, thou ait a witch, Rosalita, foi thou hast spell-bound my heait, almost my ac¬ tions ' "Ifl were a witch, Arthui, ' and Ro¬ salita sweetly smiled, " I would chain tliee here at San Angelo, as the caded child holds lus captive bird, I vvould hold tliee m a leash of silk " Anon it will be so," whispered De la в 2 Pole,
Pole, joying in her emotion " When next I depait from San Angelo, my bnde will bear me fellowship" Rosalita bent her beautiful eyes on the ground, as a soft sigh heaved the lawn on her bosom *' Bear up, fairest, dearest,' he pursued " rich m a mother s blessing, I return to love and to thee ' And then again he held her for a brief moment to his breast, till doubtful of his own fiimness, 1 e start¬ ed and broke away Rosalita uttered a faint cry, she looked up—he was gone, she fled fiom the tham ber , she mounted to the highest turret ol the castle she stood waving hei kerchief, and watching anj gizmg aftei lnm, until even imagination could pierce no fuither until the proud war-horse he bestrode, and the armed retinue who shadowed him, dwindled to a spetk, and vanished m the haze of distance " When— и hen shall I see thee more ? ' she murmured, and she pressed her hand upon her heart, for she felt a weight at her heatt, which almost crushed
crushed her—" when—when shall we meet again ?" " The signor will retira ere the bridal robe be ready," said Heitna, striving to assure her gentle mistress " 1 ake heart, dear signora told gnef is a bitter foe to maiden s bloom , hkt the pitiles« frost, it nips and withers evtry blossom ' " 1 know not vv by, Helena," and Rosa¬ lita sunk weeping on the netk of her young attendant, " but all my spirits have vanished with him I never felt so sad and lonely When my dear father has journeyed to Palermo, I could touch my lute, and sing and smile—now I can only weep " " Love is a strange, inexplicable pas¬ sion," gravely remarked Helena " I have heard tell, hovv that love addles men's wits, and scoffs at men's reason." " Love ' ' repeated the ai tless Rosilita " sure I love my dear kind father, sui с ----' " Ah, but not with the love you bear the signor Arthur de la Pole 1 ' eigerly в 3 inteirupted
interrupted Helena · " the one is all calm and still, the otliei all wild and blissful · the one gives charm to life; the other is life" " It is indeed life," sighed, or nther felt Rosahti ; and then she descended from the turret, foi she he.ird bei tatheľs voice be¬ low " I have been seeking thec, dear one,' said the count Delia Monti " "Tıs a heivy day to us yet the sun shines on the ti ick of De la Pole " Rosahti brushed a tear fioin her eye " A dutiful son, my darling tluld," continued the tount, " mak¬ eth ever a kind husband If I vvere sick and sonow nig, wouldst thou not fly to tend me 5 ' To the end of the world,' exclaimed Rosalita, and she cast hei anns around the netk of liei fathei, and hid her tearful face upon his bosom " 'llien wilt thou suiely mike a far less effort to keep me well, and to see me happy,' lejoined the count, " then wilt thou suiely banish this tast of care, and look

murmuring. I never hear thy voice, my girl, bat I thank God for the blessing he Ba's spared me." " I fear mc my voice is out of tune," said Rosalita, smothering down a sigh. * When last I sung-----" She paused, ahd quick emotion burnt upon her cheek. " I can enter into all thy feelings," said the count, soothingly : " De la Pole was herb to hear and to applaud : anon," and hé fixed his eyes steadfastly upon her, " De la Pole may be here, and thy old fa¬ ther may be wanting." Rosalita snatched his hand, and pressed it with fervour to her lips.—" Then—then," she faltered out, " will my heart be quite desolate ; then hope will no longer sooth me." " It is an ordination, wise and irrever¬ sible," gravely replied the count ; " gen¬ dered in sin, and established from the fall. Man, forgetful of his obedienee, and di¬ verging from the straight track of his duty, reaped to himself shame and death. The

" Hope bettei of me, dear—deal father —snd I too will hope,' and she tried to smile " Hope," rejoined the count, " is a che¬ rub of the sky, it pilots through many ι storm , it shines through many «i daiker scene than the present Hope in thee my daughter, has led me on to endure afflic¬ tion, and to combat human injustice.

" although thou hast never known any other home than San Angelo, San Angelo was not always a home to me " " Now I have indeed infected thee, my dear father," exclaimed Rosalita, starting up, and clasping his hand between both her own ; " now, thou dost indeed look sad and thoughtful Ah, and a tear too 1 " and as she spoke, she bowed her lips to his hand, and she kissed it with such fond and dutiful affection, that from gall it changed his tear to balm. " Solace of my heart and hfe '" he mur¬ mured, snatdnng her with fervour to ťis bosom " Let me see thee smile—let me know thee happy, and all will be well with me " " I am happy—almost happy now," ex¬ claimed Rosalita, and she flew to the shelf, and lifted down ber lyre " Come, I will play to thee'—and she swept a few wild chords; then turning her beamy eyes to¬ wards him—" First promise thou wilt talk no
no more of age and death, and I will sing till sunset ' The count smiled —" I grant tıs a dis çordan* theme to youth and promise,' he said, " but trutii is often unseemly " Nay, not truth, and Rosalita spoke with eagerness and feeling " Tather Eus- tache of Santo Nicolo has numbered nearlv twice thy years, and Aithur says, he looks as full of vigour, md as strong m life, as though he had been real ed ııı qtber than restriction " Temperance and self-restriction, said the count, " is the best prop to life, and the wisest, suiest pass to honourable age ' Ah ' Out not the restriction of the cowl, replied Rosalita , " not the iigidity of the pnesthood ' All—any resti iction which tends to moderat лп and sobriety of life, said the count, " which subduing the fever of the passions, regulates to o«bedienceand to or der ' But the austenty is so severe, the в 6 watching

we will beguile time present with antici¬ pations ofa bright future; we will talk of De la Pole, and follow the track of De la Pole, through all its mazy windings." Rosalita smiled and sighed, and softly sweeping the chords of the lyre, m a voice ti emulous with native sensibility» sang— '· Youth is a flowei uli brief tmd bright, it sparkles like the ¡Jow-worm я light, It duw ns, it beams, it disappears, And vamslies ία growing yeara And when 'tis past wlnt docs it seem'— К tlııı b ol nought— t fleeting dream, lliat cheats the sense, and mocks the »ght And fadts away in morning light " It in the zenith of lier pow'r, In jouth s bright, brief, and sunny hour, At Virtue 9 siinne wt. seek ttie charm, Ί bat shields alike from guilt nnd harm, " Ibcn when item winters frost appears, And all our hopes and all our fears.

CHAP II ------------------ Now hear «ne «ela e Mj story «vi ch tl ou 1 ast not beard Milton Тнг blue waves of the Mediterranean were all bright and luminous with the rosy lustre of the setting sun and the rocks and the hills and the picturesque varieties of wood and pasture glowed in the like fairy tints, when soothed by the cheering converse, and upheld by the arm of her father, Rosalita quitted the castle A few hours before De la Pole had passed through the same gate, a tear sprung to her eye, and an ice-chill ran cold thnugh her heart, when she recalled his parang glance, his parting sigh, yet she spoke not, she even tried to smile, when emer¬ ging from the deep shadow of the arch¬ way,
way, the count pointed out the broad ex¬ panse of sea, as blue, and almost as tran¬ quil, as the heaven which slept twice-told upon its bosom " Tıs a scene to sooth every jarrmg passion, said the count, " a scene to awaken giatitude and adoration I never gaze upon the calm glories of sunset, but I thmk of the dose of a well spent life, calmly, serenely, placidly dropping into the night of eternity, like yon resplendent planet dropping beneath the line of the horizon " My dear father, said Rosalita, and she strove to assume a cheerfulness she could not feel, " I think of it as the sea¬ son of rest, and I look forward to the dawning of a new day with hope and in terest " At your age I saw it with the like hope and interest, rejoined the count, " because at youi age, eveiy flower was bright, and every brier was hidden but expenence and care will gather m this our pass
pass to the tomb—will gradually file away the burnish which muffles our better rea¬ son one by one, dearest, the huks must be severed, the haze too roughly dissipa¬ ted, life would scare with its barrenness ' " One by one, ' faltered Rosalita, and she raised her eyes to the face of her fa¬ ther, and she iead nought save thought and sorrow " This is not our iest," piously pronoun- e-d the count, pausing, and glancing up waids, " the vexations and v icissitudes of tune and chance, bid us to a better and a surer resting-place —Beyond the sky, my tluld, beyond the leath of mortal ill and mortal endurance ' " Sure, even here, on earth,' sud Rosa¬ lita, mildly, " there is much to hope, much to live for " " Ay, if hope be fixed on othpr than man's promises, on other than pnnces' smiles '—and the count spoke with deep feeling " In the world, my girl, there are quicksands, and gins, and snares, which innocence
innocence cannot dream of,—and false fnends—and false reliance—and false hopes —and false promises He ceased, and he turned aside his face to hide his deep emo¬ tion " But not here, dearest father, replied Rosalita " we have no false friends—no false promises here " God forefend ' ejaculated the count, starting back into himself " Here, at San Angelo, we have all harmony, all love, all peace I was thinking of the world such as men make it—of the ag¬ gregate of human society in tiuth, my girl," and he forced a smile, " the lapse ot years altogether was forgotten I had wandered back to the busy bustling scenes of early life, to the vicissitudes and per- plexitits of the past, and broken ι eliance and misplaced confidence sadde ned the re collection " " Thtn why harbour the recollection ? earnestly questioned Rosalita —" why not shun
shun it>—why not shnnk from it, ω the foe to peace ?" " I believe it were the wiser maxim, mournfully rejoined the count, " hut the thoughts are not always within our own keeping, alack ' they will run restive, and spurn at the curb-rein, they will re¬ vert to the past, even though it crush the spirit withm us. But now of a brighter theme, a theme more befitting your age and promise—the signor De la Pole think you"—and he gazed archly in her blushing face—" the signor De la Pole will long tarry m England ? " Oh no '" said Rosalita, " De la Pole goes but to crave the blessing of his mo¬ ther he speeds on the wmgs of the wind, he—he ------" She ceased, or rather, wo man's baehfuiness withheld the promise confiding love had registered " He quits the green bowers and social comforts of England, to return to Sicily and to us," concluded Delia Monti " 'Tıs a blessed harbour, my child, and promises a teem-
a teeming fruitage — а blessed harbour to me, in the dutiful affection of my child¬ ren , a blessed harbour to my children, in their devoted affection to each other—God grant, ' and he raised his hands and eyes to the Heaven he invoked, " it long prove a blessed harbour to us all ' ' " I would not change it for the range of a whole world, exclaimed Rosalita, encompassing in one glance, sky, and sea, and earth, teeming with nature s lavish- ments " Not for the home of De la Pole '" ask¬ ed the count Rosalita paused irresolute, then feeling¬ ly resumed—" Sicily will ever be the ihome of my heart and my preference " " There lurks a magic in the scenes of first remembrance, observed the count, " winch time or chinee can ne er efface a lingering softening sentiment, clinging around the heart, md mingling in all its better feelings—mingling, did I say ? Ah ' rather, it becomes a feeling, it becomes a passion
paasion in itself; for base is the mind, which loves not, joys not, in the witchery of early association; it sheds balm midst the throes of adversity, for it reflects scenes of calmness and peace. Heaven knows, I have dwelt upon it, until every angry pang has been subdued, until the fever of resentment, and the malevolence of party- hate, has ceased to wound and to rankle." " Sure, my father," and Rosalita spoke in the warmth of filial love, " the wrath of man could never harm you." Delia Monti mused for many moments, then, with a deep-drawn sigh—" Once, dearest," he resumed, " I was v hat I have lorjg ceased to be—a courtier. Basking in the smile of the prospei ous and the mighty, sycophants paid me homage; like sum¬ mer-flies they buzzed around the sunshine of my prosperity ; they called me great, and I fancied myself happy." " And was you not ïeally happy?" ask¬ ed the attentive girl. " Encompassed by friends,
friends, and girded in with power, could you be other than happy ?" " Said I not they were as summer-flies?" quick rejoined the count—" said I not they did but buzz in the sunshine of pros¬ perity ? Like summer-flies, when the storm gathered, when the зип of favour veiled his face, they scudded away-—they left me to all the desolateness of broken fortune " " All—say you all, my father ' Alas ' alas' is man so heartless'—is human na¬ ture so base ?" "All, save one, deaiest — one tender friend upheld me — one devoted heart clung to me in vv eai and w о The saint I have lost—the mother who gave you being, she who vv as iny solace, she, whose bosom pillowed me amid tlie storm of fate, she-----" " No more—I beseech you, no more a fitter season—a better season," and Ro¬ salita dissolved into tears " I know no season better or fitter than the
the present," said the count. " Cheer up, my girl. 1 have buffetted the ill, and the narration cannot harm me. When I glance back upon tbat period of turmoil and perturbation, of hope, and doubt, and torture, it seems as a feverish dream of the night." " Sure then 'tis unwitting to look back upon ugly dreams," remarked Rosalita: " better they die away and be forgotten." " Not when the revisai fashions the heart to gratitude," rejoined her father. " I never recall the past peril, but I hum¬ bly thank God for the chastening mercy which drew me to himself. Had the prince I served been ever gracious, had no invidious foe shed venom in my path, the policy of the world—not the schooling my own heart—had been my life's sole study. I might have been richer, greater, more powerful, more exalted among men ; but less happy, because less moderate, less humble. 'Tis adversity, believe me, which teaches man his dependence, which con¬ strains
strøms mm to look up to that Power whence every blessing ¡flows be he sor¬ rowing, or ailing, or destitute, or aggrie¬ ved, religion balsams his heart-pangs" He tried to smile, yet he concluded with a sigh, that evinced deep feeling and sad recollections " Dear father, you would make me al¬ most woo the crosses of this world," said Rosalita. " Of a truth, prosperity seems as a flower begirded precipice "Ίο many it proves a flower-begirded precipice, returned the count, " for it paints life in false colours, it displays all the sunshine, and shuts out all the sha¬ dows Man at best is blind and weak, he believes what he wishes, he turns from the home conviction of his reason sure if there be a pang humbling to self love, tıs when awakening from the trance of trusting reliance, we find the shallowness of human pi ofession 'I hat pang has been mine, my Rosalita I have fallen from the dizzy height of pre-eminence, from the

in the rult of his own diotess, he cleansed from every species of optn profligacy, he visited the hospitals and diurthes, he re heved the necessities of the poor he pub¬ licly degiaded all coriupt judges, and in then stead appointed men of distnteiested- ness and known probity Though ele¬ vated to the archbishopric of Toledo, next to the papacy the richest dignity in the Romish church, m lieart and spirit he lived a simple brother of St Fiancis for the splendour of his high station could not lurt hım from his monastit duties Be¬ neath the pontifical robe he wore the hnr cloth and coarse frock of his order, nightly did he woo sleep upon the baie boaids and daily partaking of nought s ive the leutal fare of privation, did he set to all dasses of men, a rare and undeviating ex¬ ample of foibearance and virtue ' ' And yet he excited malice, he aroused the snakes of envy and of hatred, and Rosalita shuddered as she spoke " He excited the envy and the hatred of
ofthe sordid,' resumed the count "of men, who jealous of their own prerogative, aimed at other than their country's weal but in his own heart he bore a rich recom¬ pence—the prosperity of thousands' the aggrandizement of Spain ' His whole life was one close link of active virtues the lover and promoter of learning, he found¬ ed the college of St lldephonso —and at Alcalá he éretted a famous university — the senate-house and the market pince at Toledo, too, deep cut m marble, bear his high eulogium for gifted with stringe prescience, at Toledo, '1 orrelaguna, and Alcalá, on the eve of a fearful scarcity, he erected public granaries, and filled them with corn at his ovvn expence ' And next, in one, we hail him a conqueror and a sa¬ viour, for he buckled the sword upon his priestly vestine, and headed the army of Spain he besieged and carried Oían, a city of Algiers and he converted tlnee thousand Mahometans to the worship of the true faith ' ' с 2 « Oh,
" Oh, he ıs blessed—thrice blessed ' ' ex¬ claimed Rosalita, yielding to the enthusi¬ asm of her feelings " Dear father, did you see—did you know, that great man ' ' The count breathed a heavv sigh —" I saw him m an evil hour," lie mournfully continued, " for it was my destiny to shed blight upon his high hopes I have said that I landed at Villa Viciosa in the train of Charles the Fifth William de Croz, lord of Chievres, his prime minister, and a numerous assemblage of Flemish nobles, eager to share his bounty and his favour, swelled the pageant From every quar¬ ter of the kingdom, the Spanish nobihty hastened to greet the sovereign It was a gay scene, a scene of magnificence and splendour a scene dazzling in grandeur and display Yet beneath external smiles, counter passions rankled m many a breast, jealousy, and hate, and envj, and fear' The cardinal Ximenes, too great, too good, too much the fuend and champion of his country to escape the biting fang of human malice,
malice, was the secret source of inquietude and dismay It was the interest ahke of the Spanish and the Flemish courtiers to bar him from the eai of the king and when, spite of the infirmities of advanced age, joying in the arrival of the loyal Charles, and hailing in his presence a balm and blessing to his country, he hastened towards the coast to pour forth Ins gratu¬ lations, the malice of fiends was aiming at his overthrow I will not lead you through the subtle cabals and crooked po¬ licy of aitful men tliose neaiest the throne poured invidious poison into the ear of the youthful and misjudging Charles, and as though Heaven, foi some deep ind hidden end, suffeied then machinations to pre¬ vail, at Bos Equillos, the cardinal Ximenes was stricken with almost mortal ailment Incapable of advancing, yet ahv e to the urgency of the case—for his mind pirtook not of his body's weakness—he penned a letter to the king, therein boldly advising him as to the line of his futuie conduct, с 3 and
and demanding an early interview, for the sole purpose of disclosing the true state of the nation, and the feelings and temper of the Spanish people But the lord of Clnevies Killed not the explanation and the bpamsh and Flemish nobility, alike jealous of the wisdom, magnanimity, and integrity of the prelate, diligently strove to prevent the interview Quick followed ons cold unerring system of neglect, indif¬ ference, almost insult The cardinal Xi¬ menes removed to Aranda and there, wriMung in the smart, enfeebled by dge, and iv asted by disease, did his great spirit bleed under the killing blight of ingrati¬ tude Perhaps it vv<ti, madness on my part to venture at expostulation, jet pre suming on past favour and past indul gence, in behoof of humanity and justice I dared the hazard I pleaded for Xi menes, and the malice of hell was let loose against me—I trod, as it were, amid a brood of scorpions, and how could I es cape the death-sting ' Alas, my child ' and

—He did forget it, for in a few hours he was a corse " A corse ' ' echoed the sympathizing Rosalita " Holy Virgin ' what thought —what felt the king ?

of king Henry and his courtiers, it was his queen, the «oyal Cathenne, or rather, it was the maid of honour tending the footsteps of the royal Cithenne, who mo¬ nopolized all my thoughts and all my wishes Your mother, my Rosalita, young, beautiful, and accomplished, was the or¬ phan niece of Edwaid Stafford, duke of Buckingham She was wooed—she was admired—she was caressed but not all the splendour of the field of the cloth of gold, not all the feats of chivalry, the pastimes, the exercises, the gallantry, which she had marked, and in which she had mingled, had rifled the calm of her pure bosom With a pulse unquickened, with a heart untouched, she had witness¬ ed the famed interview held between Guisnes and Ardres by the kings of J ranee and England she had smiled at the mad rivalry of two nations emulous to excel in elegance and splendour, she had marvel¬ led at that wasteful prodigality, which in tbe little span of a few days, wantonly lavished
lavished the luxuries and comforts of a life. At Gravelines, all the politic ι de¬ signs ofthe emperor, my master, the tricks and intrigues of rival ministers and rival powers, were lost in the one usurping sway of self. I loved the gentle Mary Stafford—I rend in her beamy eye, in her blushing cheek, a language which nature best ean read—it was the language of'lrti fant passion ; the first birth, the first burst' of woman's love ! Ah, the joys of that bright brief dream ! the dizzy, the thril· ling exultation, when she singled me amid the titled throng who started up in rival- ship! When I contrast it with present lone¬ liness, it seems as a speck in my pilgriittJ age of earth too dazzling to look upon." " Loneliness.," murmured Rosalita, and sorrow and reproach beamed in her eye. " The heart despoiled of its kindred heart can feel nought save loneliness," and the count spoke with sadness. " This earth is a blank to the true mourner; when the sun rises, when the stars shine, upon
upon the grave of the loved and lost, all bfe is loneliness Alas ' I could fill whole volumes, were I to dwell upon individual feelmg may you never experience the fearful void '—may the path of your life be ever dappled vvıtlı flowers ' But the night thickens, my child, and my story is but half told At the pressing instance of the king of England, the emperor and his court passed from Gravelines to Ca¬ lais, and after a sojourn of some days, parted in mutual good wdl Aix-la-Cha- pelle was appointed by the golden bull for the coronation of the royal Charles, and though wedded with boylike fond¬ ness to the place of his nativity, ambition, the darling mistress of his soul, beckoned from the Netherlands We proceeded to Aix-la-Chapelle, a. ' amidst the pomp and solemnity with which the Germans ever mingle up their ceremonies, the erown of Chailemagne was placed on the brow of the chosen and exulting emperor. It was a seene of splendour even to dazzling, the
the riches of fairy land seemed concen¬ trated in one bright point, for the powers and the w talth of every principality met as it vvere in nval emulation I will not touch upon the first act of the emperor s admimstiation, lest I become tangled in the theological controversies and sellólas tic disputations, which for so long a pe¬ nod, m the pestilent heresies of Martin Luther, aimed at the overthrow of our re¬ ligious faith Other calls, other impulses, nearer and dearer, drew me from the scene of action I besought and I obtained per¬ mission to quit Worms whilst yet the diet was sitting and the arraigned cul¬ prit, bold in his heresies, and unshaken in his zeal, firmly adheied to his opinions I cared not for the edict which deprived him of the privileges of the subject, which drove lnm from the empire, branded and disgraced I marvelled how lesser pas¬ sions could sway the actions of men, hovv hghter hopes could engross their being— England
England was the loadstone of my attrac¬ tion— England, enshrining the saint I worshipped · Prosperous gales wafted me to the bright haven of my hopes—I land¬ ed in England, and buoj ant and eager I sought the court of the royal Catherine Again I beheld all that my heart coveted in womaii—Mary Stafford, fair, and pure, and bashful, and innocent, with every charm to captivate, every virtue to ι ivet ' I vv ooed her with no common passion—I won her from every richer candidate ' Ours was a compact of hearts a deep, deep interchange of hopes and feelings not mere beauty, not perishable fascina¬ tion it was the soul, tht spn it witlnn , it was that fixed, that immutable prefe¬ rence, which extends to—whith enriches after life ' Ah, when 1 recall th it dieam of bliss · when I think of England—the broad banks of the meandenng 1 hames— the bowers and gloves of Windsor—the far-stretching park, the lofty trees embo¬ soming
soming Whitehall*—now, even now, like baseless visions, they flo it, to mock me with their barrenness ' He paused, he turned to woo the breeze, his face was tinged with the purple light of evening, his eyes were fixed upon the curhng waves, breaking and sporting at his feet Rosalita rose from the mossy cliff on which they had long been seated, she placed her hand upon the arm of her fa¬ ther—" To moirow we will think of Eng¬ land, she said " now let us return home the sun has quite set, the star of evening twinkles do, my father—d,o ¡et us ieturn home ' Го England first, and then home," re¬ joined the count " Listen to me, my child it eases the pang here, pointing to his breast, and then he diew her gently towaids him " I would
" I would but spare you," said Rosalita, again seating herself upon the rock " Dearest father, my heart, my interest is with you," and she clasped his hand as she spoke, and bowed her lips upon it " Thp queen of England,' resumed the count, " wished to rob me of my pnze, because I was a foreigner, and because she loved your mother, and feared to lose her. but when she saw the fire of her eye grow dim, and the roses of her cheek fade, she forgot all of self, and graciously vouch¬ safed her sanction We were marned— and the landing of the emperor Charles the Fifth, at Dover, m his passage to Spain, first drew us from the blessed calm of retirement Great was the contrast blazing forth m the splendour and gran¬ deur of the pageant all the magic beauty of the countiy, the bowers and pure streams, the meads and the woods, and the sweet carol of the buds, all, all, w ere exchanged for pomp and empty show. " The king of England, anxious to show favour
favour to the nephew of queen Catherine, met the emperor at Dover, conducted him in great state to London, and lodged him in one of his ovvn princely palaces in Black- fnars Feasts and merry-makings, jousts, banquets, and masks quick succeeded each other duty led me to the presence of my royal master, and Mary, my inno¬ cent beautiful Mary, bore me fellowship At Windsor, as in London, the like round of pleasure prevailed Begirt m the mantle and garter, the two monarchs, knit ш the closest bond of fellowship, re¬ ceived the holy sacrament, and pledged themselves m strictest covenant, to the support, welfare, and interest of each other —and though in tenderest infancy, the j oung princess, the lady Mary, the only surviving child of kmg Henry and queen Catherine, was formally affianced to the emperor Charles* "But
" But why descant on the tricks and intrigues of policy ?—why waste time on the dark intricate movements of courts and courtiers ? Alas ! to unreave the riddle of the human heart belongs alone to the Almighty ! Man notes the sur¬ face ; beneath no eye can penetrate ! The period for quitting England approached : Spain needed the presence of her king; she was torn, she was tortured with intes¬ tine commotions, and a war was pending with France. My Mary wept vvhen she knelt at the feet of the royal Catherine ; the queen wept with her ; perhaps it was that mysterious prescience, warning of ills to come, vvhich damped the spirits of the unfortunate princess. They parted never to meet again !" The count paused for many moments ; he bowed his face upon his breast ; fond recol-

recollections choked articulation, his heart, his eyes weie full, then struggling down the pang—" Life," he pursued, " at best, is a scene, checkered with few pleasures— with many crosses We compare it to the succession of day and night, to the change of the seasons Vain, false hypo- thesis' Day and night succeed each other, sunshine and darkness, the sea¬ sons alike alternate winter destroys— summer restores. Man—man, has but one summer—the desolation of the heart one winter ' In this early parting from her country and kindred, my Mary droop¬ ed , but she left them in health and in prosperity the duke of Buckingham, her uncle, firm in the favour of king Henry, the queen, hei giacious mistress, buoyant in the hope of re-umon I have said that the lord of Chievres was the heart s coun¬ sellor and prime minister of the emperor I ought to have said, that at the death of cardinal Ximenes, his nephew, William de Croz, had been installed m the arch¬ bishopric
bishopric of Toledo He was a man"— and a low shudder crept over lnm—" but let his actions speak for him He sought my friendship, he visited us in Castile, he professed a brother s love alike for me and for Mary How could I suspect it other than brother's love ?—How could I dive amid the black secrets of that fakæ — false heart ' ' " How ? false ' ' said Rosalita , " thr archbishop of Toledo, the highest digri- tary in all Spain, false '" " False as hell, ' exclaimed the count, and all the colour fled away, his brow, his lips, his cheeks, were marble-white Rosalita pressed close to his side, she clung to his aim, she looked anxious and sorrowing m his face " You teinfy me," she said " Dear—dear father, I never saw you thus " The count turned towards her her voice was as a spell upon his passions, it soothed, it moulded him to gentleness he cast his arms around her—he clasped her
her to his bosom—" My cherub ' my com¬ forter ' he whispered—" relic of my lost wife ' ' and then he drooped his head upon her shoulder and wept " This is indeed a sorrowful day, a me¬ morable day," sobbed Rosalita, as their tears mingled " Arthur gone—you so wretched " " Not wretched—say not wretched, dear one, rather, grateful for the blessing that is left ine '" and his eyes and his clasped hands were raired to heaven, then strug¬ gling down the " sweet and bitter thoughts" that rose to mock him—" It grieves me," he resumed, " to note the mk-blots in this glonous theatre, the world, so perfect, so pure m loveliness, so honoured by tbe Ci eatoi, so polluted by the creature ' Alas ' the fury of the elements are less terrible than the fitful passions ofthe human heart , tbe devastations of the raging tempest, less desolating than man's crimes without the curb of reason and of honour, hurried on, and tangled in the labyrinths oi sense,

seek the solitude of her chamber when the archbishop visited at the castle Once I remonstrated her exciine seemed frivo¬ lous and idle it was the first time I thought prejudice and temper swayed her—I chided, and she wept Would to God she had lifted the veil'—would to God she had whispered the treachery of him who sought her rum ' That period—tbat woe-fraught period I must not dwell upon Fate it¬ self seemed to conspire against me A war with France had broken out the whole kingdom of Navaire had yielded to the arms of the Γιβηοΐι general, the gal¬ lant lbsparre and joung and ardent, dazzled with success, he had passed the confines, and entering Castile, had laid siege to the town of Logrogno I had an enemy, subtle as fate, remorseless as death the plot, long brooding, burst like thunder in a summer sky, for there was no threat¬ ening, no intimation, the peal, the as¬ tounding peal, broke, as it were, upon the sunshine False witnesses swore against vol id me
me. I was accused of a crime, black as the beart in which it gendered, of treason to my anointed prince, of secret commune with the foes of Spain. All who had cal¬ led themselves friends, deserted me in the hour of persecution ; not one in the huge catalogue outlived the ruin of my fortune : bereaved of the favour of the emperor, every courtier was my foe. I would have turned for succour to him who had pro¬ fessed so highly—to the archbishop of Toledo; but Mary, my own Mary, lay gasping at my feet ; she clung wildly to my knees ; she clasped me with maddened fervour.—' Let us fly—let us to England,' she implored. ' The queen, my mistress, will befriend us; the duke, my uncle, will receive us.' I spoke not—I tottered back—I buried my face in the agony of my feelings. The duke—the duke— Holy God !—the duke of Buckingham had fallen from his high preeminence; his wealth—his honours—his life—his glory—all—all had set ! A tissue of lies «nd
and absurdities, gendered in the malice of cardinal Wolsey, had wrought his over¬ throw. Arraigned of high treason, of plotting against the life of the king, he had been tried by his peers—had been condemned—had been beheaded on Tow- er-hill ! At such a moment I dared not tell her—I dared not blast the slender hope that was left. ' No—no—not fly,' I exclaimed; ' urge it not, my Mary,' raising and straining her to my heart. ' Let guilt fly ; innocence needs no co¬ vert.' But, alas ! I was wofully convin¬ ced, innocence, destitute of friends and power, is often confounded with guilt. I was cast into prison : the light of my eyes —the joy of my heart ; you, my child ; you and your angel mother were tom from me." Again he ceased; Rosalita could only sob ; even De la Pole was for¬ gotten ; she lived but in the sorrows of her parents. " When I think of that long and dis- mal week," pursued the count Delia Mon- e2 ti,

though its first streaks scarce pierced through its garb of mist, he wrapped him¬ self in his cloak, and he wandered forth into the solitude Past and present swam before him, the scenes of his infancy—the misfortunes of his family—those who were gone to rest —those who still lingered in the pang of bhghted expectation it was a bewilder ing, a torturing contemplation, it prayed on mind and spmt, he shuddered, for a veil of blood seemed still impending over him and over his whole race As he stood, facing the sterile waste spreading betwixt him and Etna, a tall figure, hood¬ ed, and close muffled in a dark cloak, gli¬ ded across the path immediately before him He started, for the tread was sound less, it broke upon him, like " some spirit of the lull, moving in mist and shade He was not supeistitious, yet he lived in an age of superati' юп, and awe and won der seized him The servants and follow ers who bore lnm fellr ivship, he had left in

of woe, like unto the denouncement of Cain, for ever md for ever " Thou knowest not what thou sayest,' urged De la Pole, willing to sooth his bleeding spirit " Though thy sins be of scarlet, true repentance shall bleach them to snow lake comfort, trust in the promised mercy remember, twa., for the redemption of guilty man, the expiatory sacrifice was iccepted " Who art thou, who wouldst pour balm into the giping wound ' demanded the recluse then turning, and gazing stedfistly on him, Ins face blackened, his features grew convulsed " Avaunt ' avaunt he exclaimed, shuddering, and starting into frenzy—" Cannot death bind thee?—cannot my pangs appease thee' Oh, that 1 were in thy grave, smned against not sinning ' " Tliou aı t deceived, ' said De la Pole, mildly, and he bent over the penitent, as he lay gasping and panting beside him " I am

" Sure, boy, thou art a sophist, if thou wouldst credit fancy with the fell fiends which haunt my midnight. Mar¬ ry ! thou must not sin, and think to for¬ get ; thou must not kill, and call it fancy. Seek me at nightfall ; ay, and thou shalt read a lesson, sball make thee cling to rectitude, in despite of racks and devils." " At nightfall, with God's grace, I shall be far hence," said Arthur. " True, thou hast said so ; thou art bound for England—for the land of my temptation and my fall." He ceased—he shuddered—and for whole moments he stood buried in deep abstraction : it seem¬ ed as though his was "the gimwiiig of remorse—tile (Itoltiiiij swell Of pilssloas strong, «vhu« sense aud reason swim In «Ircur; di*zineis~-lhc tanctcd spül Which misi«l around Ins lieu«! ene luriuus fiends of ln.ll " Suddenly starting, and grasping tight the arm of De la Pole—" When thou

" True," said the monk, rallying nto re¬ collection , and then be pressed his hand to his forehead, as though to concentrate his ideas " I do remember the field—I do re- memberthe stiuggle the lion grappled with the white boar, and long was the vantage doubtful Oh, twas a bloody field' Many a brave heart ceased to beat, many a brave liead was laid low but justice tiiumphed, and the boar tumbled headlong from his lll- raised glory I saw him in the death-pang, struggling, panting, wallowing m blood and dust, devils tugging at his heart¬ strings , hell opening in the shout which proclaimed king Henry ' I saw him -----" " Thou wert a soldier then," mteirupt- E 2 ed

The monk turned abruptly towards him ; he spoke not, but there was strong feeling, 'there was mingled and indefinable emotion in his look and manner. « " Thou didst fight in Bosworth field," iresumed Dé lu 'Pole, attentively regarding· him ; "perchance in siding against the just cause, thou didst gender all these heart- pangs." ' The monk groaned aloud ; he wrung his hands, but still he spoke not. " If such did befall," continued Arthur, " much may exist to palliate prejudice ; parly-work—false judgment'—self-inte¬ rest." ' " The bait—the accursed bait with which the devil urged me!" ejaculated the monk, and frenzy flashed in his eye. " Listen to me, boy," and wildly he spoke, and more wildly he looked'—·*" take warn¬ ing by my overthrow ; build thy strength upori my'weakness.

Arthur knelt beside Mm ; Ъе drew beck the cowl; he tore open th* vest; be shuddered, as he marked the skeleton form, girt with à penance-girdle, end close wrapped in hair-cloth. *I afn better—I am well," said the monk, feebly ; and then he strove to rise, but almost powerless, he clung to the firmer arm of De la Pole. " Suffer me to tend thee back to San Nicolas," urged Arthur. " The holy brothers ------" « Ntl—no—no '" interrupting him ; " not with the brothers of San Nicolas ; I am not meet to mingle with the brothers of San Nicolás. To my own den of woe; tti my own chosen abiding-place." He moved forward as he spoke, still clinging to the shoulder of his supporter. *' Come on," he said, for De la Pole hesitated ; " I will be a true pilot to thee^—I will but show thee the just recompence of sin. Oh ! if thou art, as I fain would believe thee, free from ought save the weakness of man's fallen
fallen nature, preserve the blessmg unim¬ paired; 'tis better than power; 'tis better than all that wealth can give thee. Come on !—come on !" and then he struck into a narrow defile, winding betwixt two green cliffs, close mantled with briars and trail¬ ing plants, and upon whose lofty summits the wild vine spread its luxuriant foliage. The path was so gloomy, and the stillness so profound, that a mind givesn to super¬ stition, might have peopled it with forms of another world; no sunbeam could pierce—no health-bearing breeze could dry up the moisture: fit haunt it was for the venomous adder and noisome toad: and when, by a felled tree, tbe monk crossed a running stream—when he paused before a low dark archway—when, with his shrunken hands, he put baok the screen of briars and night-shade that nearly choked up ihe entrance—when, crawling on hands and knees, he prepared to enter the black opening, De la Pole started back in utter dismay.

Then grasping tight the arm of Helena, she led into a small ¡oratory immediately adjoining the chamber of the count. '1'is for man to adventure," she pursued; "«'tis for woman to pray success upon his dar¬ ings." And, sure, never did heart or lips breathe forth more pious and fervent as¬ pirations, than did the heart and lips of Rosalita, as she lay prostrate before the altar of her worship, and thought upon the hapless mariners, tossed and buffetted by the raging storm. She prayed for mercy in their uttermost need ; she prayed for resignation in their hour of doom : and though the thunder crackled ovei head, and the lightning quivered round her, she heeded not the shrill and frequent ciies of Helena, for her wrapt spirit soared above all of earth and earthly things. An hour and an hour wore away ; for time speeds in peril as in joy, in endurance as in the season of brightest fortune : the like hours, the like minutes, the like seconds, com- G 5 priseth
priseth the diurnal span, whether the sun shine, or whether the tempest low er mu¬ table man may change, but the immutabb decree of Heaven stands firmer than the globe itself ' " Hark ' how the run patteı s ' -xclaim- ed Helena, creeping dose to the side of her mistress " Sure my lord the count, and poor Giovanni, will get deluged for the painstaking " I trust me they will leap far more for the painstaking, observed Rosalita, " for the consciousness of a good intention bringeth peace to the heart " May it bnng peace to the house' sighed, or iather, sobbed Heleni " Alack, signora 1 ' and an inward shudder bleached hei cheek, " the Virgin grant this storm pass away, and morning dawn upon us unhurt' I know not why, but I feel α strange fear, a strange misgiving at the heart Signora, and she laid her cold hand on the arm of her mistress, and her voice

The altar, and the priest] and the marriage-ring, remained; but not the signor De la Pole—dear sig¬ nora, not the signor De la Pole. I saw a man, dark, and wild, and frowning : hap¬ piness flitted at his approach; calamity and despair bore him close fellowship : he spoke, and the bright sky vanished, and the sun dipped beneath a darkened cloud, and all the flowers in the bridal chaplet, drooped, like unto the first emblems of spring,
spring, when nipped by the frost 1 of ий-· gering winter.' 1 i m ' " What Athen?— «what then?'' ίπτρϋ tiently questioned Rosalita, almost Uncon¬ sciously lending her ear and interest tolthei night-vision ot her attendant. ι ' « " What then," repeated Helena, ľ Ah, signora '" and she shook her head in mourn¬ ful earnestness, " must I tell you what then?' "Av, girl, speak out: dreams at best: are but vague and idle mockeries: not all your dreams can harm or scare me." ' Yet as she spoke, the ice-chill at her heart, and the dedth-tmt o'er ber features, gave lie to the boast she uttered. " I would I had half your courage, sig¬ nora ' Such a dream had scared me out of dear life." " No matter ; proceed, Helena ; I would hear unto the end. In trutb," and she tried to smile, " ypu hold me in despite of my better judgment " " Well, signóra," and Helena glanced timidly
timidly around, 't this man, tbi« fearful stranger, moved as the blast of fate. A deep abyss opened at your feet. I heard you shriek—I saw you totter—I saw my lord the count Delia Monti, and the signor De la Pole, fly to save you : but the stran¬ ger held you fast ; he laughed in fiend¬ like derision, and then he leaped with you into the«gulph; he——" • At that instant tbe bell at the outer gate sounded, and Rosalita and Helena, klike impressed witb wild fancies, started, and uttered a fearful cry. " "Tis my father," said Rosalita, quick regaining strength and firmness ; and tben she fled away to the casement, and looked down into the court-yard below. The thunder had ceased to peal, and the rain to deluge; yet still the inky blackness of the heavens tokened of storm, and strik¬ ingly contrasted the broad bright glar« of tbe torchlight. She saw her father mov¬ ing at the side ofa kind of« litter borne by the itrvants, and active in the labour of benevolence,
benevolence, supporting on his own wm, a head, listless and wan, as though death's cold hand bad already stilled all its hopes and all its passions. Slowly they crossed the court-yard, and yielding to her own native thrill of heart and feeling, she diet them ere they reached the centre of the hall. > ' " This is no sight for you, my child," said the count, gently putting her back. " 'Tis the sad remnant of a whole boat's crew. Alas ! the art of man, I fear me, can avail but little." " Heaven is all-merciful !" exclaimed Rosalita. " Dear, dear father, the spirit, the life may linger." " We will essay all that human power can essay," said the count ; " the issue lies beyond our reach.

For a few brief years, the royal Mar¬ garet, the last of the line of Plantagenet, and heiress to her hapless brother's wealth, partook of something like peace—the sem¬ blance, if' not the substance ; for even in the arms of the husband she loved and honoured, the blight, which like an un¬ wholesome mildew, had bowed to the grave, father, mother, and brotlier, cast shadow on the transient sunshine. She was not happy — she never could be happy ; for nature had gifted her with a reflective mind and a feeling heart. She trembled for her sons in after-life ; she anticipated evil in every show of dawning ambition ; and often, folding them in Ifor arms, and bedewing them with her tears, would she pray, fervently pray, that they might inherit their father's meek and un¬ aspiring
aspning virtues, that they might live un¬ marked , that they might descend to the gnive m talm and tempered obscurity ' But alas' the nobleness of her birth foibad the liidulge'ice of retirement duty and policy led to othei scenes and often was she compelled to forego the peice and stillness of Stoveiton Castle, for the splen¬ doui and brillimcy ofthe court, to mingle in the heartless joyless iound of gaiety,the jousts, the mummings, and the pageants, which impeiioiis fishion cl issed as pleasure But it is not foi иь to linger ovei the days of her early youtii, to swell our pages, by nuidting the perplexities and troubles, arising in the forced intercourse with the man and the sovereign, who had chased from earth the last lepiesentative of her family's honour We lead in the chronicles of the olden time, that the royal Margaret, created countess of Salis¬ bury, eie yet 'ier first boin, Henry lord Montacute, had attained the age of twenty- one, was left a widow, that she lived at H 2 Stoverton
Stoverton Castle in Staffoidshire, the sole guardian of bei children, ber mmd divorced fıom every call of pleisure, and toiling unceasingly in the rough tiack of her duties We read also that in the > eign of king Henry the Li B hth, whilst ht yet lived in bonds of concoid nd love with lus quten, С itlienne of Ai nj. on Marg iret countess of Salisbury, esteemed md ie spected, was ıııtı usted with the tne of then only child, the princess Mai} —that for man} }eirs, spite of the iluctuations and capricious humours of tb monoicii the smile of fivour, unclouded and un broken shone upon the fortunes of her family —that hei last boni son, Reginald more especially patronized by the king at the age of seven yeais wis sent to a Cai thusian monasteı } at Sheene near Rich mond from thence to Magdalen College m Oxford —that passing his degiee of bachelor of arts, and admitted to deacon s ordeis, in the brilliant spring of youth, he was made prebendary of Salisbury, dean of
ot Wimborne, and dean of Exeter —that in compliance with the fashion of the times, and more especially to perfect his studies, he long sojourned at the univerzity at Padna in Italy, sustained by the muni¬ ficence of his loyal kinsman in almost princely splendour and though so highly gifted, and though so highly favoured, no incipient lealousy lui ked in tbe bi easts of the brothers, no aim at ι lvilry, no desire to supplant ' It was a family of love, for love united all its members ' At an early age, the lord Montacute wedded the lady Jane Neville, daughter of the baron ot Abeigavenny, and Geoffiy de la Pole, among the youthful beauties of the court, singled out, and sighed for, the fair Ca¬ therine Patkenham But Arthur, unfix¬ ed, unfixing, like the summer zephyr, sported around the sweetest blossoms, with d spint light and a heait untrammelled Eminently brave, and emulous of martial fame, and fashioned ahke by nature and by education to delight and excel in the h 3 manly

splendour, and the fairy pageant, and the dream-like illusion, had yielded to staid and sober reality Perhaps it was the glowing phantasy which still lived in the mind of Arthur, for he had no weightier call to supersede it or it might be the golden bugle he had won, or the royal hand which had bestow ed the guerdon, but certain it is, w htn he quitted the palace, to cross to his own place ot sojourn, he widely diverged from the beatened track, nor did he per¬ ceive hovv fai he had wandered, until he heard the splash of water, and suddenly emei ging from the close embowering trees, he beheld the silvei moonshine shedding a glowing sheet oer the bold broad Thames It was a picture strangely op¬ posite to the one he had so recently quit¬ ted , for it was— 11 e negl „u «л. ol Vutnre w de and v ld VV 1 ere und sg d 1 y n «ule ort sl e spreads Unbounded beauly lo tl с τον g ej" As he stood, inhaling the breeze, and h 4 marking

if they could have opened the page, and perused the destined trials of their aftei lives, similarity of sorrows, and similarity ot injuries, had cemented their hearts in twin biothers love But merciful is tht dispensation which veils all foreknowledge from human eye, «>lse had hfe been made up of bitters, and this our pass to the tomb uncheered by one gleam of sunshine' Π t few succeeding years which inter vened prior to Arthur de la Pole s quit¬ ting England, comprises much in feeling, but little in narration and yet it furnishes ibundant matter to the philosopher and the morahzer, for it shews the weakness of human principle, when beset by passion, and undefended by religion The youth and beauty, and versatile graces of Anna Boleyn, had maddened the feelings of the despotic Henry and the wedded Cathe nne, the wife of his youth, and the mother ofhis child, was to be sacrificed to a new and self-created dogma After a lapse of eigh teen years, passed in undisturbed harmony, H 5 scruples
scruples of conscience was the vam mock ery on which he grounded his claim for divorce He had espoused the widow of his brothei, Arthur punce of Wales, and a new and an overwhelming passion novv stamped that espousal as unlawful and unholy Every code, human and divine, was sifted and lansdoked to yield force to his scruples eagerly did he íesoit to the aid ofthe church, to prelates too worldly to stem the stieam of power himself a casuist, he carefullj conned the Mosaical law, and he founded his arguments, and lie grounded lus reasonings, on the prohi¬ bitions contained in Liviticus But his perseverance and his power, his heartless persecution of the virtuous and unoffend¬ ing Catherine—his acknowledged supre inacy m England—his conflicts with the see of Rome—Ins war with the clergy— his invasion of all ecclesiastical authority —his suppression of the monasteries, and his appropriating to his own especial will the long amassed treasuies of the chinch, no
no further concerns our story, than that it sheds light on that seemingly wanton per¬ secution, which precipitated his own kin¬ dred from prospenty and peace, into the lowest depths of calamity and endurance I have said, that to the patronage and lavish favour of king Henry the Eighth, Reginald de la Pole owed his quick nse and elevation m the church, that pleased with the brilliant genius which in early life gave promise ot a bright maturity, and proud of talents so rare, and anxious to setuie to bis touit and to his kingdom an ornament so striking, the kmg showered upon him benefices and favouis, the more especially to secure him to himself, and to bind him, body and spirit, in the adaman¬ tine bonds of gratitude But Reginald de Ια Pole could not succumb his princi¬ ples to his interest he was a man who looked beyond the favour and the patron¬ age of this world, a man who dared to descry and to deprecate sin even in a mo¬ narch against the secret whispers of his ιι ύ conscience,
conscience, he could not side with his be¬ nefactor , he could not lend aid in over¬ whelming and crushing the weak he could not sanction the tyranny and injustice prac¬ tised against the unfortunate Catherine We read, and we admire, in Phillips s Life of Reginald de la Pole, the point ot principle, and the religious zeal, which alienated him from his country and from his king but the subject is too deep, and too intncate, for us to attempt more than lightly to skim the surface Reginald de la Pole was a zealous Catholic, and king Henry s bold and hardy defalcation from the Papal yoko filled lum with dismay He reprobated tbe sin whilst he wept over the sinner and with every feeling of his soul roused and wrestling within him, he withdrew himself from England, the more effectually to escape the dreaded contro¬ versy Like the thunder, long rumbling, ere the bolt fell to annihilate, king Henry j lelded not to the full malignity of his nature,
nature, he withheld not the pension he had granted to De la Pole, he deprived him not of his deanery of Exeter, he even vouchsafed him permission to remain in Italy, under colour of pursuing his studies dnd on the countess of Salisbury, and her family, he continued to lavish the like tokens of undiminished favour, for it was the evil bent of his natuie, ever to smile on those predestined to destruction W«· trace throughout Ins whole reign, dissi¬ mulation and cruelty combined, in one the hypocrite and the tyrant, employing ever the most elaborate artifices to fulfil his secret purpose The indignities expenenced by the un¬ fortunate Catherine, and which she ever met with the meek resignation of the saint and the martyr, sank deep into the heart of Arthui de la Pole He honoured her for her virtues, he loved her for her gra- ciousness and condescension, and when he saw her neglected and forsaken, de¬ prived of her regal state, and exposed to the
the chilling slights which ever attend those banished the sunshine of a monarch's fa¬ vour, when he knew her, alone and deso¬ late, sojourning at More Park, at East Hampstead, and at Ampthill spies meanly planted among her household, her move¬ ments watched, her words, her actions, cruelly distorted, it needed all the rheto¬ ric of a fond and doting mother, to with¬ hold him from vindicating her cause, and openly standing forth her champion Arthur was young in j ears, and young in policy, an utter stranger to that world¬ ly prudence which enjoins the curb-rein upon the heart's genuine impulses The smile of the queen and the mistress associ¬ ated with the happiest hours of his child¬ hood he could not but remember how oft sbe bad noticed him, how oft alike upon him and the princess Mary she had lavish¬ ed her fondest caresses, how oft, amid the sylvan shades of Havering Bower, on May mommg, with the first earol of the lark, he had borne from the woods the fragrant bough
bough to win her smile All then had been harmony and peace, no jealous pang had arisen no discrepancy of sentiment to scare mirth from the heart the king him¬ self had often joined in the jocund frolic, for the court, in compliance with ancient usage, on stated festivals, had condescend¬ ed to adopt the traditionary customs of the people Tiembling lest the effervescence of youthful feeling should hurry headlong into rum , lest Arthur, joining in the dis tontents which prevailed, should forget his allegiance, and provoke death, the countess ot Salisbury carefully smothered down herown griefs and sympathies in the wrongs and sufferings of the persecuted queen —and whilst the wretched Cathe¬ nne, ìepudiated and slighted, pined away her life at Kimbolton, m Huntingdon¬ shire , whilst, without a murmur, she en¬ dured her complicated trials, whilst her nval falling the throne, loyed in the bnef season of her triumph—on some especial calling,
calling, planned for the politic purpose, she dispatched Arthur from England, un¬ der colour of bearing a mission eo his bro¬ ther in Italy Associating with the friends of that enlightened brother, during his long sojourn at Padua, Arthur de la Pole devoted his time to improvement and study and when, from mingled cu nosity and pleasure, he visited Sicily, it was with a mind enlarged, and a heart sensitively alive to its vivid and pictu resque beauties, for nature and feeling taught him to worship the Creator in the sublimity and greatness of his works ind abundant scope for worship and for praise, lay in that sunny land, where— Untaught to μ ant to turn tl e g ebe a d uw Tbey all the r products to free atu e owe The «oil unt U d the ready ha vest y elds W th wheat and barley wbtl the golde fi 11« Spontaneous «vines from «ve gl ty clusters j o r A d Jove delcends n each prol no «how r But if heretofore calm and temper¬ ed feelmgs had swayed the mind of Ar¬ thur de la Pole, chance speedily put to flight
flight the season of his quietude and his indifference In his own native England, beauty, hke a gay and brilliant flower, had excited the mere admiration of the eye —in Sicily, it was destined to sink into the heart, and to colour the hopes and the anxieties of his future life The sun had set, md day was fast sink¬ ing mto the purple haze of evening, when he stopped at a small fashing village, crouch¬ ing at the base of the mountain of Tin- daro Sheltei fiom the night dews, clean stiaw to rest on, fruits, milk, and dned fish, were the humble offei mgs spontane¬ ously held forth Tbey were bestowed with a lavish hand, and accepted with a grateful heart, and never, on the silken couch of luxuiy, had his slumbers betn more calm and more unbroken At day- dawn he purposed proceeding to San Marco, but the morrow was the festival of Santa Agatha, and he heard from his humble hostess, that on the morrow, in the
the nigh convent of Santa Maria di Tin¬ daro, a novice was to be professed. It might be cunosity, or it might be fate, for often does the die of a moment impart colour to our whole lives ' De la Pole resolved to witness the inauguration of the novice, and he arose with the dawn, to join the gay throng hastening towards the monastery The air was balmy it sighed amid groves of fragrant blossoms, it came freighted with a thousand sweets The eye too wandered over smiling and teem¬ ing regions on the one side, the sea, blue and calm, as the cloudless heavens, on the other, the prospect bounded by lofty mountains, over which, Etna, in lordly triumph, was seen to rise ' But neither the sublime or beautiful possessed a spell wherewith to beguile the attention of De la Pole his thoughts, his whole soul, was full ot the being who was about to immo¬ late all this л orld's joy on the altar of ho¬ liness, to snap the ties of habit and orna¬ ture,
ture, to renounce all intercourse with man —and when he passed into the cha¬ pel—when he beheld tht high altar deck¬ ed in the sparkling treasures of the sacris¬ ty—when he heaid the loud swell of the organ, and the choral chant of the nuns, his every feature partook of his inward sadness We will not seek to paint the imposing rites which closes the Catholic candidate for heaven from the temptations and turmoils of the flesh —the severing the flowing hair—the disfigurement of na¬ tive beauty—the shroud hko veil, symbo¬ lical of the living death, 'tis enough, that Arthur felt the solemnity, that abstract ed from the pursuits and callings of a busy world, he bosomed that elevation of senti ment, which notes tbe soul's true wor ship In the breaks and pauses of the ce¬ remony, his eai caught the deep sobs of sympathy and feehng, and when his eye sought the direction, it ι ested on a crea¬ ture almost too perfect for earth Young, light, beautiful, with a skm, white as " snow

Heaven had warred against him, in the loss of those friends who now slept beneath the wave and she would feelingly con¬ trast lus isolated state with her own bright promises, until tears, like summer dew, would bang upon her chtek " Alas ' lady, be w ould excl im, ar dently perusing her varying features, " the happy can ill guess the thorn which ran kles amid grief and desolation it chokes up all of promise it obscures all of pros¬ pect Far away from country—shut out from hope, vvhat, save despan, can ıeıgn? " Sure, not beyond reach of countiy— not beyond ι each of hope,' soothingly urged Rosalita " The darkest night, signoi, has its close, the heaviest storm yields to sunshine ' " True, true, lady, the cloud scuds over it no more, my sun may agam arise, brightness, noontide bfightness, may be mine '' As he spoke, a ray, almost daz zhng, shot from his eyes, and beamed о er his features, he looked like one, proudly pre-eminent,
pre-eminent, presumptuously wrapped in the invulnerability of his own btrength, spurning alike at time and fate Rosalita trembled as she marked him, an apprehensive chill ran cold at her heart, she tried to speak, but she could not, she met his eyes, and hers shrunk timid from the glance " Lady, ' he pursued, and he spoke al¬ most mward, " I could abide here for ever, but there are other calls, other du¬ ties I must away to a distant land—I must adventure life—I must resign this haven of calm and blessedness, for a ser¬ vice of hardihood and peril Lady, sweet lady'—and his look was beseeehirg— " when thou sbalt know me on the wide sea, tossed by the wave, and buffeted by the tempest, will thy thoughts wing to¬ wards me'—will thy prayers tend m v wanderings ? ' " The prayers of our church, signor, are for the unhappy, the wayfarer, and the sore-laden," said Rosalita ι 3 " But
" But wilt thou pray for me indivi¬ dually ? urged the stranger—" wilt thou think of me individually? ' I wil) think of you, and speak of you, said Rosalita, artlessly, " as of one, whom I once knew, and in whose fate I once felt interest Ay, signor, I shall often think of you for the remembrance of youi pre¬ servation will be ever coupled with the active benevolence of my dear fatlier " " And no further, lady?—wilt thou think of me no furthei ? and the stranger frowned and gniwed his lip then quick recovering self presence, and forcing the ready smile—" Alack ' I shall thmk of thee, in eveiy vicissitude of my strangt fortune amidst war and death, my tlioughts and my heart will linger here Long after Rosalita had lost sight of the stranger, did she muse upon his words and dwell upon his look and sigh of sor row, till imagination, ever busy, pictured him the slave of corroding grief, and com passion, and meie humanity, imposed the nectssity
necessity of kindness and conciliation She would meet him w ıth a smile, she would listen with patience and quiescence to his strange wild wanderings, to his flights of love and thivalry, alike begin mng and ending in the power of beauty and omnipotence of pission Sometimes she would inarvtl at the warmth and glowing tneigy of his language, at the vivid colouis in which he would bedeck his distint home —the beauties of Sicily, the gioves, the mountains, the rocks, the rivers, were as a desert, compared to the perpetual verdure and never-varying May of his native Lesbos ' Artfully would he strive, in exciting her curiosity and her inteiest, to awaken the wish to see and mingle in scenes so glowing and so se¬ ductive but Rosahta was content and happy no change of clime did she sigh for, no propensity to rove marred her qmet the love of De la Pole, the appro¬ val ot her father, was the earthly bliss she coveted, was the acme of this world's good ι 4 " And
" And why not return, signor ? asked Rosalita, artlessly raising her ev «s to his face—" Why not seek again the haunts which memory and childhood have so en¬ deared ? ' " I could not return to them with the same heart, with the same feelings, re¬ phed the stranger, " perchance I could not view them with the same eyes There are scenes, there are actions, there are oc¬ currences in life, which casts shadow upon every after-thought Ah, lady ' when I quitted Lesbos, the world lay open before me ' I was free, unshackled, light as wind, and buoyant as fancy now I am held down against my j ldgment, now I am fettered with an iron chain ' " An iron chain ' ' echoed Rosalita, and her look betrayed amazement " Ay, lady, a chain, firmer, stronger, more durable than iron , for its links are muffled m roses, it holds captive the rea¬ son and the heart Sweet lady,' and he cast
cast himself at her feet, " thou dost hold me in a chain, binding unto death !" Rosalita started back; she shrunk from his touch ; every feeling of her nature was outraged. " Hold !" she exclaimed, " this is a language, I dare not—I will not hear. Signor," and she spoke with sternness, " to the affianced ear, ought of love is in¬ sult." She fled away ; she tried to escape, but again he cast himself before her " Explain — explain," he implored ; " doom me not to the hell of incertitude. Cruel, barbarous Rosalita ! why call me back to life, if destined to make life ray- less ?" He lay at her feet ; he filled up the pathway ; his face was pale, and care and sorrow hung upon his brow. Rosalita glanced timidly around : they had quitted San Angelo; they had half climbed a rugged and romantic height o'er- topping the sea : all around was wild and lonely ι with her father, with De la Pdle, often had she tracked the same path : now, she stood and trembled. ι 5 " Spurn
*' Spurn not the bleeding heart," im¬ plored the stränget ; " trample not on the lowliest, the most devoted of thy slaves. Hear me, lady; hear me swear, lasting, eternal, unalterable love; hear me ------" " I cannot—I must not," interrupting him ; " nay, unhand me, signor ; drive me not to regret the confidence so unwitting¬ ly placed in a stranger." Again she would have passed, but still he barred her pas¬ sage. " Hear me—only her' me, ' he pursued. " If wealth can win that gentle heart, if gold and preeious gems can purchase one smile—all—rail shall lay at thy feet. Lady," and he spoke with proud triumph, " I have power—I have possessions—I have—" " My heart cannot be bought," said Ro¬ salita, coldly, and she turned away her faoe, beautiful and glowing, in the scorn which flashed from her eye. " But it may be won ; sure it may be won," urged the stranger, v Hint the service; limit the servitude: if to the earth's
CTrth s farthest range, I fly to prove my homage no peni can daunt me no suf sering can scare me Name but the ser vitude, lovely, angelic Rosalita, and death alone shall stay me ' death—did I say death? and his voice grew tn mulous and broken—* ah lady ' the last sigh the last struggle, the last thought, will be for thee —will be of thee ' When these mortal conflicts shall have ceased in the grave— whether it chance beneath the wave or m the dust—belike a tear may be given to my fate He ceased be looked up into the face of her he sought to soften all of disdain and anger had fled, and grief and pity lived in her eye Deceived, mistaken Rosalita 1 she be¬ lieved the pang ıeal and her gentle na ture shrunk in the infliction Sne knew not how, yet she longed to pour balm into the wound There lurked no pride of conquest, no woman s coquetry in her bosom pure and unsophisticated all heart, %11 feehng, she would have awarded hap. ι b piness
piness to every created being, had the gift of happiness been within her reach. " You distress—you pain me," said Rosalita, vain¬ ly striving to repress her tears. " Signor, I have said this language is unseemly. If you would not banish me your presence, and for ever, trust not the repetition. Suffer me to return to San Angelo, or the count my father-----" She started; she half shrieked; for at the instant, the sudden flash and report of a gun, ran in echoes along the shore. She turned ; she beheld a vessel, scudding before the breeze, the sails unfurled, and white as the sportive wave, first swelling to meet, then breaking beneath her bow. A second, and a third gun, flashed o'er the "ocean-path;" and almost rath the like velocity, the stranger sprung from the earth. One bound, and Rosalita saw him on the very pinnacle of the rock above, grasp¬ ing to the stunted herbage, and poising himself upon the brink of th« 1 - precipice : he held a white kerchief in his hand, and he
he waved it to-and-fro high above his head The sea foamed and roared be¬ neath the bleak, the precipitous rook, bulged and bent o'er the bed of waters one step—one false footing—pne loosen ing and yielding of tbe weak and pensh able roots to which he clung, and death, awful, terrible death, awaited the plunge No cry, no word escaped her, she stood, tintless as marble, her breath, her very pulse, suspended, and when again the gun fired, she buried her face in her hands, to veil the mortal struggle, to shut out the death pang A voice, sorthing, murmuring, grate¬ ful, called her back to recollection, she looked up, she met the eyes of the stranger, all radiant with delight and rap¬ ture, a crimson glow burnt upon his cheek, every handsome feature betrayed the exultation within " Would my death have been so mourn ed ? ' he spftly whispered " Angel lady ' fairest, loveliest of created beings ' would my
щу bier htve been gemmed with such precious tears? Ah, that T had indeed diedi rather than awaken to less than blessedness '" " You mistake—strangely mistake me, ' said Rosalite, quick recovering voice and recollection " Condemnation of the liar. dihood was lost in dread of the effect A fellow-mortal in such strait must awaken pity" " And no more?" asked the stianger " No more," said Rosalita, firmly, and she turned and proceeded rapidly down the cliff The stranger moved silently at her side The path, as I before said, was wild and wiading, alţernatşly edging the precipitous chff, and commanding the bold broad ex¬ panse of sea, or hemmed in, and lost, amid thickets of olive and cork trees " Forgive me—only forgive me," urged the stranger, when first the walls of San Angelo peered amid the foliage " I have offended· lady, and my heart fbels it " "Be
" Be the subjeot altogether forgotten, and my pardon is freely grant«»},' said Rosalita, and she held forth her hand as she spoke The stranger took it—ho held it for a moment tight clasped within his own, then relinquished it, as though doubtful of himself " I will obey—I will strive to obey, he said, m a voice agitated and broken ' It must be in distance—lady, I must part hence, if I would not turn rebel to thy order Thy friendship, re¬ spect, grant them to me—I would win them at the peril of life ' " You have them—you may command them, said Rosalita, and a tear trembled in her eye, and a blush, beamy and beauti¬ ful, as the first tint of morning, glowed upon her cheek Again the stranger relapsed into rap ture, hopes and supplications rose, then died upon his lips, he saw her frown, he saw the tear and the blush fast yielded to cold and pitiless reprehension ; and startled at
at the change, he fell back into quiescence and order. " Pardon—pardon," he im¬ plored ; then, in distance, and in seeming humbleness of spirit, he bent his knee, and bowed his foce almoet to the sward. " I wpuld deprecate wrath," he pursued ; " I wpuld be all submission to thy will. Lady, I fly to provt my heart's devoted¬ ness." As he spoke, he glanced towards the vessel, which still, like some scared and restless bird, hovered in the offing. Rosa- lita's eyes intuitively followed the di¬ rection of his eyes, and then she fixed them on his face; but she deciphered not the glow and the smile, which passed, swift as the lightning's flash, o'er his features. Some might have read exulta¬ tion and triumph, but her heart was too innocent to read ought beyond what she saw. " One request further," urged the stranger, pausing almost within the shadow of San Angelo. " I could wish, lady, to quit
quit Sicily without questioning. When tar away, say to the count Delia Monti,, I lpved unfortunately — I loved without hppe. Let him guess the rest. When far away—remember, not till then ; I pray, not till then ! Lady, indulge me ; 'tis the last favour I may ever crave—'tis the last favour thou mayest ever grant me." Rosalita paused irresolute; a secret from her father filled her with dismay; yet she read agitation, almost agony, in the face before her, and she feared to irri¬ tate. " Thy answer, lady," said the stranger. " Grant what I ask—promise what I re¬ quire." " I do promise, never to name you— never to think of you—never to recall this moment," said Rosalita, timidly. The stranger frowned; reproach rose to his lips, but he feared to give utterance. " A better—a fitter season," he mused ; then stifling down the ebullitions of anger —" I must be remembered," he pursued; " a heart
" a heart like thine cannot shpt opt mis¬ fortune : yes, when the wind blows, and thp tempest gathers—vvlien thou shalt kneel and pray for t'. e shipwrecked and the nutcast, my image will revive. Ah, lady! I had hoped—but no matter, my hopes and my sorrows bide vvith me." He turned away as he spoke, and he moved many paces frpm ln?r. " We shall meet again," said Rosalita, soothingly. " Sure, you quit not Sicily οη the instant." " To-day, and perchance for ever," ex¬ claimed the stranger, pausing, and turn¬ ing, and gazing attentively at her. " To stay, lady, is to burden nature beyond heľ bearing— ris to please the eye and martyr peace. If years of servitude could win—- if patience and endurance could eke out the blessing, here, in Sicily, would I so- joum ; (tere, in Sicily, would I live and dit. Gild but the future with one ray of sun¬ shine; bold forth one hope; say to me, time may»—" "It
" It would be false bope," interrupted Rosalita " No, no, signor, I cannot—I dare not mislead with false hope I owe it to you—to myself—to him to whom all my /ows are ph L ted. P'gnor," and in¬ nate rectitude rose paramount to woman s bashfulness, " I am the betrothed of Ar¬ thur de la Pole " " Betrothed, not wedded," muttered the stranger, and then he sank into moody silence His arms were folded, his cheeks pale his brow knit, he looked proud, al¬ most threatening " Let us part in peace, implored Ro¬ salita, stealing to his side and stretching fortli her hand—" However my heart be with De la Pole, my friendship, my re¬ spect tends on the worthy ' " Thou dost not scoff at my passion— thou wilt not betray me to the count thy father, noi hold me up in mockery to the happy envied De la Pole The stranger spoke with vehemence, and as he spoke he held her hand in л grasp almost painful "No,
" No, no," said Rosalita; " we part in amity ; we part in mutual good will." " In mutual good will !" echoed the stranger: then,after a deep pause—"Fare¬ well!" he pronounced; " sweet handmaid of charity, farewell ! Bear to the count Delia Monti, my thanks and my best wishes. I return to my native Lesbos, there to tutor my heart to forget." He bowed his lip to her hand as he spoke, and then he darted away, and bounding down the path, disappearted among the cliffs.

He «taite, v>itr> heliul« «ancour ioimineiit, Го lutercept tly waj Miltom In the early part of the sixteenth century, men's wit and ingenuity had not at¬ tained the toppling height which now in¬ verts the order of things ! England wore a wild and a savage aspect : its face was covered with shaggy woods, and wolves prowled in its forests ; its towns too were scantily scattered and scantily populated, and scarce a village smiled in the dis¬ tances. Then, to wander from the nurse- cradle, to traverse its bleak and barren wastes, was labour and peril ·, for no bea- tened track tokened of safety ; no mail transmitted
transmitted the thoughts from county to county ; no public conveyance, by steam, nr by horses, speeded through the land ; nor rest be sought at the kindly inn, nor strength and energy recruited by the kind¬ ling blaze of spirit-cheering fire. To jour¬ ney, was to hazard life, was to brave strange and wild vicissitudes. De la Pole landed at Plymouth : but how, in an era so barren and so desolate, he penetrated into Staffordshire, we will not seek to ex¬ amine ; neither will we attempt to trace, the Convents, hospitals, and chantries, which yielded the largess of shelter and refreshment: that he travelled with all speed, his mission be bis warranty ; for his heart was full of Rosalita and happiness, and his boon, to crave the blessing and sanction of his venerated mother. Of pub¬ lic matters he tarried not to question ; for policy sealed his lips, neither did he pro¬ claim his own name or bearing, lest he might furnish cause wherewith to stay his progress: but spite of all the throbbing pulses
pulses at lus heart, spite of the hopes and transports of prosperous glowing passion, ofttimes the spint would sink and the lieart would fail, and the boding words of the conscience stricken Tirrel— во not to England, savour of death and ruin In vain he strove to conquer the weakness, it would scare bim in sleep, and he would awaken, with ι start and a shudder, and emphatically bless God that the phantom existed no longer Ί he last golden burnish of the sun was fast fading in the West when Arthur came within ken of home, when, on the verdant banks of the Stour, he traced images and objects coupled With the dreams of earliest remembrance The boundary of his walks, the haunts, vvhicli associating with mother and with sister, flooded his eyes With ten¬ der thrilling feelings even Sicily vas for¬ gotten Nature usurped her undivided empire to pass into the presence of that dear mother, of that no less dear sister, to gaze upon them—to hear them—to hold
hold them in the tight clasp of aflection ' —it needed not even the bnlhant beauty ol Rosalita to perfect the dreamy happi¬ ness ' Hope kindled in his eyes, and glowed о er every feature, when the dark turrets of Stoverton Castle appeared in the distance, when, like some giant outline towering into view, it cast its lengthened shadows о er the broad bed of the river He struck his rowels into his jaded beast he paused not till he had gained the draw bridge and then he flung himself from the saddle, and rang eagerly for admittance Че listened, he could almost hear the beatings of his own heart, he rang again, and again suspense grew into agonj All the fire of his eye vanished all the bloom of his cheek faded it magnified minutes into hours, it wound him to a pitch verg¬ ing on madness " Mother of God ' he ejaculated, mea¬ suring with his eyes the drear cold battle ments, and baring his ears to catch each commg sound but all was still and grave¬ like,
like, the very guiglingof the water audi¬ ble as it rippled among the ι ushes — " AVhat may all tlm mean?" mused Ai¬ timi, once more raising his arm, and pull¬ ing the ponderous bell It sounded deep and hollow, and then, as before, it ceased, and it died aw ay —" What may all this mean ?

and drank of the cup, and grown grey m the service of the countess of Sahsbury — " Sure, tliou art stiff in the joints, good Baptist," exclaimed Arthur, striving at pleasantry but, alas ' he met no responsive smile and when he crossed into the couit yaid, vvlien he maiked the rank j,iass springing midst the stones, he startpd back m utter dismay Baptist spoke not, he turntd away his face, and beckoned onwards, and vv hen Arthur again reached his side, he saw that his face was bathed m tears —" What am I to learn ' he faltered out " Answ er me, Baptist, is my mother on Püitli, or m heaven » Fear not, I can btn it only—only answer me'" and he piessed his hand upon his heart to still its thiob¬ bings '1 he old man strove to speak—strove to stifle dovvn his sobs, but he could not, he could only beckon with his hand, and lead onvv ard De la Pole tottered a few paces, and then he stopped in the middle of the court

But no more of this I would alone of my mother—I would alone of the overthrow of this our house " " I know nought of the charges brought igainst my lady countess," returned the vvai den " I only know, that the king's blasphemous enmity to the church of Rome, awakened mortal panic here at Stoverton that my pious good lady- nay, that every member of the household, mourned the suppression of the monas¬ teries, colleges, chantries, and hospitals, together with the expulsion and persecu¬ tion of the holy brothers, in sackcloth and ashes The day we heard of the pillage of St Thomas à Becket's rich shrine at Canterbury—of bis name being expunged from the calendar—his bones being bin »it —his ashes being scattered to the win ay,
ay, and of the breaking of the rood of grace at St Paul's cross, so long and so religiously preserved by the white monks of St Mane's, at Boxley, that very day ------" De la Pole writhed with impatience, he started upon his feet, he moved to¬ wards the door " I must go hence, ht said, " this procrastination is torture " Not for a king s ransom ' ' exelaimed the old man, casting himself before the door " No, no, no, master Arthur, not for a king's ransou« ' Hovv know I but spies may be planted here at Stoverton ' Is it not enough, and he sobbed by steri cally " that my lady countess—that iny lord Montacute—that master Geoffrey, are all—all prisoners ' The tale, the astounding tale, was told, and the pause was long unbroken, save by the deep sighs and anguished sobs of De la Pole Here was bereavement, here was indeed the luin of his race, the annihilation of Ins promises, the overthrow of
of all Ins neh and glowing prospects Not even the love of Rosalita could re- compense the despoliation, noi charm of fter life fill up the fearful blank And my sister—iny poor Ursula, he gasped out, when the powers of speech leturned The lady Ursula is safe from the stoim, replied Biptist "safe ш the holy kttping of her lord and husband Husband' echoed De la Pole ' My sisttr, my loved Ursula, marned ' Ay, master Arthur, and married to thy ovvn valued friend, the lord Henry Staffoid God be praised foi that one blessing ' ejaculated De la Pole " One kindly h ind will chase her tears ' His own flooded over as he spoke, and then again, for miny moments, his voice was lost m overwhelming feeling, till smothering dovvn the weakness—" Now ofthe prison, he puisued— ' now alone of my mother and my brothers I can bear all—I can hear
hear all delay, good Baptist, is false hu¬ manity " " My lady countess,' resumed the war den, " here, at Stoverton, mourned m bit¬ ter gnef the wanton spoliation of holy things for m this our own county of Staffordshire, master Arthur, the emis sanes of the king's highness have been nght busy, plundering, suppressing, driv¬ ing adrift into the world, the professed servants of God At Stafford, the black canons of St Thomas the martyi, and the grey friars of St Mane at Tamworth, the veiled virgns of St Wolpbade, at Burton on Trent, the black monks of St Modwen at -----' " Of my meither's prison—I beseech alone of my mother's prison, ' urged De la Pole " I cry pardon, master Arthur The wrongs of hoiy churcii he heavy, but God will avenge in his own good time, God will bare his arm, and hurl his lightning ' Alack · trace we not the judgment, in the
the woful overthrow of queen Anne Bo¬ le} n' Гют a throne to the scaffold, mastei Arthur ' Poor thing ' poor thing ' liei tnumph was as a dream in the night Iwas an unholy deed, forsooth, and the tax was he ivy ' De h Pole shuddered, his lips, his cheeks giew bloodless, the name of α oCiffold brought with it the denounce¬ ment of Tirrel, and a hair, thin as the attenuated line of the spider, did indeed seem to hold the axe impending over mo¬ ther and brothers " Father ' Almighty Father ' he aspnated—" Thou, who art the tiuth, the wdy, and the life' Thou, who seest whit is best befitting thy blind and fillen creatui es, hear us' aid us' Baptist fell upon his knees, his hands clasped, his whole soul elevated to that oven uhng Power so emphatically invo¬ ked nor did he return to the trials and the troubles of the flesh, until De la Pole, in ι ' aim farm voice, besought him to dis close
close all he knew connected with the im¬ peachment of his family ' Alack ' master Arthui," continued the warden, " I am but a sorry tale-teller, nevertheless, if thou wilt grant me pa¬ tience, I will, with all speed, bring my tale to a mournful issue ' " Go on," said De la Pole, " tell it even as thou hsteth, good Baptist I am all ear." And he folded his arms, and he bridled down the impatience of his feel¬ ings " I have said that my lady countess took on soiely at the hardihood nf the king's grace,' resumed the warden, " and so did all England, master Arthui, al though the grief was pent-up and smo¬ thered for very fear of the judgment Well, here, at Stoverton, whilst the storm was raging, did we pray, and fast, and groan m the dust, and supplicate for his highness, a heart of flesh, and an amended spirit ' And the very day that the news reached us, how that the rood of grace was
was broken and pulled to pieces at St Paul s cross, by John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, that very night-fall, master Arthur, when we were all assembled in the chapel, the pursuivants arrived at the castle gite, and arrested my lady countess m the king s name She offered no oppo¬ sition, although she was surrounded by her own tried and faithful servdnts, but she went away, like a lamb to the sham¬ bles, without questioning, and without complaining Alack ' alack ' such a scene of outrage and violence ' such sifting, and diving, and searching of papeis' such ran¬ sacking, and such pillaging ' They bore away with them, master Arthur, all the letters, and pnvate communications, be¬ twixt my honoured lady and her right levei end son, my lord cardinal and they arrested, in the king s name, and sent to prison, very many of the household and those who remained bthind, ere day-dawn fled iway, fearful, lest returning, they should share the same condemnation Saints
Saints and martyrs ' what a change—what a woful change, when the moirovv's sun rose upon the turrets of Stoverton ' I was the warden still, master Arthur, and the castle walls stood as they were wont but I was alone and lonely, with wakeful eyes and achmg beart, no fuend to consult, no companion to solace I dragged my weaned limbs to Stourbridge, and I bore back with me a hoard of fresh sorrows and fresh cares —for the bruit ran, that my lord Montacute, and master Geoffrey, to¬ gether with the marquis of Exeter, sir Nicholas Carew, and sir Edward Neville, brother to my lord Abergavenny, were all arrested, and lodged in the Tower of Lon¬ don, charged with conspiring against the king's life and realm, by maintaining α treasonable correspondence with the car¬ dinal, my lord Reginald de la Pole ay, and they further gave out, to cover the monstrous outrage, how that my lord car¬ dinal, by means of a marriage with the princess Mary, aspired to the crown, and how
how that the insurrection in the north tounties, headed by Robert Aske, and called the Pilgrimage of Grace, was stnred up and fomented by his eminence Ay, master Arthui, and my flesh creeps, and my blood boih, now, even now, whilst I tell, of what I heard, and what I saw, in the nigh town of ¡stoui bridge—proclama¬ tions, forsooth, m the king s name—bills, posted, and bandied by every passing knave, for thee— -for thee, mister Arthur —five hundred mirks for thee, and they called thee rebel and traitor God's grace light upon us all ' I had like to ba\ e felled to the earth, the varlet trumpeting the foul lie in the public market " Tıs well thou hadst some little guard upon tliy actions, good Baptist, said De la Pole, sonowfully, " else hadst thou diagged dovvn the uun upon thine own head ' Lack of powei—lack of power, alone, master Arthur,' quick rejoined the war¬ den " I was a lone man, and penned up, as
as it were, by the rabble Wo is me ' the busy throng, who, a mort of times, have lined and followed the track of iny ladv s palfrey, shouted out for the king s grace, and a downfall to all traitors " The common crowd, good Baptist, smd De la Pole, " like a feather tossed m the mr, yields lightly to the prevailing gust nor judgment, nor heait, nor dis¬ cretion, sways the multitude " For the honoui of human kmd I could wish it counteı wise, resumed Bap¬ tist ' But by the mass, master Arthur I do believe me, there hves now at Stoui bndge, those, who for the paltry lucre, would turn rebel to their own blood ' I would not know thee, master Aithur, in the streets of Stourbridge, for the value of the whole town " And yet I must dare the peril, said De la Pole, firmly ' I tannot hide my head, and cower, like one stricken in con scious crime, good Baptist I must share the
the fortune of my family, be it prosperous, or be it adverse " " Sure, thou wouldst not dare the fangs of the tigtr, thou wouldst not leap into the lions' den,' exclaimed the terrified warden " No, no, master Arthur, to put life in such fearful strait, is to sheath steel m thme ovvn heart I do beseech thee, master Aithur, hie thee back to Italy, and seek shtlter with my lord cardinal It cannot vantage thme own km, though thou shouldst tairy here, and '.tlut the vengeance of thine enemy ' " I have no enemy—I know of no ene¬ my—I never rightfully armed man a- gainst me, said De la Pole " Neither," eagerly rejoined Baptist, " did the abbots and the monks of the suppressed monasteries, yet, master Ar¬ thur, we hear tell of racks, and persecu¬ tions, and burnings Alas ' alas ' ' and lie spoke with heaviness of heart, " alike m king as m subject, man, in straying from the right path, yields up to the guidance of
of the evil one Ay, master Arthur, when the king s grace put away his own lawful wife, and wedded with mistress Anne Boleyn, he gave up the mastery of him¬ self, he yielded up body and spirit to Sa¬ tan's service The curse, the astounding curse, lights upon us all—the cursp of the church —and who can abide it' He shuddered as he spoke, foi his sc ired and superstitious fancy, read universal ruin and death, in the thunders of the V ititan For a long period De la Pole sat buned in profound thouglit, deif to the lament of Baptist, and lost to the pressure of pre¬ sent peul, for it was the dream of the past whicli spoke in the altei nate flushing and fading of his cheek, and when again the warden pronounced—" The cuise of holy church, master Arthur, speaks in this overthrow of oui house, he started, and he groaned aloud " But it may not overwhelm trunk and branch,' pursued the warden, " it may not sweep in one common ruin Thou mayest flv the jeo¬ pardy ,
pardy, thou-----" He ceased, or rather, the frown, which like a summer cloud, gathered on the brow of De la Pole, scared him " I cry pardon—I cry pardon, mas¬ ter Arthur I would not wound pride or honour Mine be the counsel of age: winter's frost, master Arthur, has stilled and quenched the fire of my blood Be¬ like I speak unwittingly It is not fitting I press counsel upon thee, yet—yet ------" and his voice was choked with emotion. " On my soul, master Aithur, I lack nought of respect and reverence ' I would but save thee—I would but snatch thee from the death-doom I—I—" He cast himself on his knees, he clasped his hands m supplication " Master Arthur, I would ransom thy life with my own. I beseech thee—I do beseech thee, act not in rashness " " No, no, not in rashness, my worthy, my excellent friend," and De la Pole, as he stretched forth his hand to raise him, was softened almost to weeping " This vol. í L solicitude,
solicitude, good Baptist, unmans me — to the latest hour of my life, this solici¬ tude will be dear to memory " Ah, master Arthur ' and the old man strove to smile through the tears which blinded him, " if thou wilt but promise to do nought m rashness, I may be con¬ tent" " I w ill—I do promise, eagerly re¬ turned De la Pole " Be of good heart my friend secure in thy faith, I promise to ponder whole hours ere I act

ter beings so uncongenial to mj nature ' Would that Arthur were here, that I might tell him all this strange man has utteied tlmt 1 might crave counsel it his hands, whether to letain the secret of his flight, oi forthwith to declare ill to my fither ' Mistaken, misjudging Rosalita ' the first seciet, the first concealment, was the first step to aftei regret and misery В it why anticipate in a reflection, to which eveiy day casualties bear record ' False deli caey, and false honour, did retain the se eret and the count Delia Monti marvelled at the stianger's absence, until time effaced the stranger and lus absence alike fiom memory The next incident which broke upon the blank of De la Poles departuie, was ι courier fiom Palermo, bearing a dispatch of loves own penning It was foi warded to San Angelo, at the instant De la Pole stepped on board the vessel, destined to bear lum to England, and it was warm and
and flowing, m all the eloquence of youthful passion, full of regret at ab¬ sence, full ot hope of return Minutely did he detail the progress ofhis journey, his thoughts, his feehngs, as dis¬ tance stretched betw een them He spoke of his night's sojourn with the brothers of San Nicolas della Rena , of lus wakeful¬ ness of his attendance at the nocturn service, of his lone ramble among the bleak and sterile lava of Etna but lightly did he touch of the melancholy ascetiek, who, like an unquiet ghost, had ciossed his path in the solitude, and scared with evil bodement, lest the timid fancy of Ro¬ salita, catching the infectious weakness, should magnify the threatened ill, and ıob her of her quiet No, he wrote to give peace to the gentlest of human bosoms, to impart to his betrothed, the sanguine colour of his own anticipations and though in the magic calendar oflove, hours and days were magnified into ages, still did the buoyant pencil of young hope, L 3 track
track out the pathway he himself was about to traverse He spoke of distant Englind, in all the thrill of patriotic feel¬ ing of Staffordshire, of Stoverton Castle, the home of his heart, the nurse-cradle of his infancy, the scene of his earliest fond¬ est recollections, of his brothers, with proud and happy confidence, of his mo¬ ther, with an enthusiasm almost amount ing to idolatry of his sister, young, gen¬ tle, lovely, as the being in whom all the kindliest feelings of his nature were cen¬ tred He spoke too of his own bright and cloudless fortune, ofa monaich's smile of all imparting prosperity and splendour to eirly life, ot friends and associates, en¬ nobled ihke by deeds as by birth " All—all, will pant to know you, my Rosalit i, he wrote " to behold you , to welcome you to Enghnd, to receive you at my hands to chase away every ves¬ tige of care and sorrow from your brow Would that the hour were come, to bear you hence—to transport you into the bo¬ som

England in their names Dwell then, I do beseech you, upon the coming hour of reunion, and take peace and consolation to your bosom, and stabhsh them in con¬ fidence and trust, that the smile, like April sunshine, may dissipate every cloud, and every shower A little space, a few bnef weeks, and we meet to part no more that balmy, heavenward hope, will cheer me on the wave, and m the desert, will give zest and energy to languid feeling, will abide with me, through eveiy vicissi tude of time and chance Farewell ' dear¬ est, best beloved' When the evening star twinkles in the blue heaven.,, though oceans roll betwixt us, oui heaits will be full of each other—our eyes will rest upon the one pure planet' 1 Rosalita was sitting at an open lattice, with the precious letter m her hand, in¬ haling the balmy bretze of evening, and gazing on the calm sea, novv bearing on its undulating bosom, the loved and the lost She thought of De la Pole—of sea and
and land perils—of distant England, un¬ til her spirit drooped, almost to weeping, and all the vivid ι iys of hope and pro¬ mise failed Hers w ıs that sickening of the heart, that lowei in¿ of the imagina tion that misgiving of the fancy, which, like an eclipse of the sun, sometimes casts cloud upon the brightest dawn of youth , was that nameless, that indescribable fore- bodence of ill, which scares and quails the very spirit within us It chased the rich bloom from her cheek, the light hope from her heart, it decked life, and all of after¬ life, ш gloom , yet could she not embody her fears, or tell of the pang which smote her Heedless of the flight of time, she sat, until all was wrapt in that doubtful light, which Sbadowy sets olF ti e face of things ! her eyes alternately raised to the fast fading glories of the west, or bent upon the wild and picturesque scenes before her The cliffs clothed in verdure, the thickly- L 5 shaded
shaded terrace, skirting the garden, and overhanging the calm blue sea that ter race, on which she had so often lingered from which she had so often listened to the songs of the mariners, where De la Pole had breathed forth his vows of truth —where she had smiled enwrapt upon his passion ' Every tree, every shrub, was dear to memory, the soft ripple of the waves, the silver moonshine sleeping upon its surface the past houis of beamy love, the past vows of eternal constancy " Gone—all gone, murmured Rosalita, and then a fresh flood of tears followed " Dear lady—dear, sweet signora, if you take on so, you will break my heart And Helena, who had stolen unperceived to her side, wept with her " Alack ' what will the signor De la Pole say, when he returns, and finds the eye dim and the cheek faded ? Rosalita looked up, her eye no longer dim, her cheek no longer faded , for the mere mention of her lover, and her lover's return
return, brought back the thrilling tide of hope and blessedness " And what will my lord the count Delia Monti say to all this waste of be-iu ty ? pursued Helena, heedless of the emo¬ tion of her youthful mistress " Blessed St Agatha ' if I were my lord tlie count Delia Monti, I should be sore, and jealous of the signor De la Pole ' " Tealous —my father jealous ι echoed Rosalita " Sure, Helena, you have lost your wits " " Jealous of the signor De la Pole s in¬ fluence,' quick resumed the flippant gnl " for vvhen at San Angelo, we saw neither cloud or shower all was joy, and mirth, and sportiveness, your looks light your heart happy Now------ List, list, signora,' bending suddenly forward " Sure as death, I saw a human form flit across the far end of the terrace ' It cannot be Gio¬ vanni, for I left lnm below in the hall, nor Petrom, my lord the counťs lackey, nor ------Hah · agam, agam ' See, yondei L 6 he
he wends, now upon the very brink of the precipice, now, like a shooting star, he darts amid yon grove of olives " " It must be some fisherman from the nigh hamlet, ' remarked Rosalita, after the pause of a moment, her eyes still resting on the spot wheie the form had disap¬ peared " Belike his bark is moored upon the beach I like to listen to the songs of the fishermen,' she pursued, for Helena stood silent and thoughtful " the sounds rise so sweet amid the booming of the waves " " I trow it be otlier than a simple fisherman, said Helena " Deai signora, how dare a simple fisherman intrude upon the terrace of the count Delia Monti '" " He kens not that we are wakeful and watchful," and Rosalita smiled at the aristocratic principles of her handmaiden ' Of a truth,' continued Helena, " the sight scares me Such strange wild stories go abroad, signora Giovanni, when last at Cefalu, heard tell of men, they call pirates,
pirates, infesting the seas, landing, and pillaging, and murdering, and spreading such feirful devastation, that one's blood curdles, and one's spini quails at the hearing ' " I wage they move other than yon solitary man, said Rosalita " Pirates, my good girl, are robbers, who go upon the seas, overwhelming and crushing those who are weakei than themselves They choose other seasons than moonlight nights, and come on other embassies, than to pace ten ace-walks, and woo the night- breeze " " I have heard tell, of pirates, landing, and spiriting away young men and maidens, and selling them into slavery," quick re¬ joined Helena , " of Turks and infidels, ransacking whole villages, and bearing the youthful and the handsome to their horrid masters Blessed St Agatha ' such a fate would kill me ' Dear, dear signora, such a fate ------' She ceased, for the stranger —if stranger «t was—emerged from the deep
deep shadow of the olive-trees, and stood in open moonshine, his face turned towards them yet so completely veiled in the thick folds of his muffling hood and his whole form so closely wrapt in his long flowing cloak, that nought, save his Height was distinguishable Long he stood, hke some statue, chiselled out of stone, so mo tionless, and so silent, and w hen he did move, it was with so slow and so measured a step, that the sound scarce rose m the stillness " What cm he seek э whispered He¬ lena " Dea« signora, my very heart trembles withm me " I see no ciuse for fear, said Rosalita, yet as she spoke, she shrunk deeper into the shade, for the eyes of the unknown seemed bent upon the casement " Belike some lover in disguise, ' re¬ marked Helena, " some would be nval of the signor De la Pole ' " How wild—how very wild you talk ' ' But though reproof spoke m the voice and
and look of Rosalita, the remembered passion of the shipwrecked man, arose, like a ghost, to scare her " Dear, sweet signora, yours is not the face to see and to forget," resumed He lena " When the signor De h Pole first beheld you in the chapel of Santa Mana di Tindaro, though his peace was at stake, he could not rest until agun he dared the peril Love, signora, comes not at our own bidding, else would it be always pi udent and always happy and why may not the like love which seized upon the heart of the signor De la Pole, seize also upon this ----- " Peace, peate, Helena ' this is worse than folly , it wounds, it offends me Such surmises are idle and mischievous Yon stranger ------ ' she ceased—she bent forward—she scarce dared to breathe, for doubt and apprehension sprung out of the coming moment A shrill whistle rose and rang among the rocks, and then the splash of oars sounded, and the stranger, quick as light, turned and fled down the terrace
terrace and as he turned, the night- breeze blew aside his cloak, and the moon¬ beams darting on something of steel or jewelry, shone almost to dazzling He paused not until he had gained the far- end of the terrace, and then, with one bound, he cleared the blossoming shrubs and bushes, and disappeared down the steep, whose green bosom sloped into the waves More than an hour waned in vain con jecture, that night the stranger came no more, and Rosalita retired to her bed, unsatisfied whether the rays of the moon had shone upon tempered steel, 01 upon the jewelled ensigma of nobility Yet she slept, and she dreamt of the wander¬ ing De la Pole for he was the hero of her fancy, and the hope of hei soul s rest Perhaps had her heart been fiee and un¬ trammelled, with an imagination so buoy¬ ant and so enthusiastic, she had conjured much m the romantic incident of the past night as it was, it arose, and it flitted upon
upon memory, like half-forgotten dreams, and when at the breakfast board, she spoke of it to her father, it was as a mere casualty which scarce deserved the nam¬ ing " Some stranger, lured by the fairy imagery of our coast," remarked the count " Fen spots are so replete m native beau¬ ty , so rich m the harmonious contrast of land and sea ' When first I visited Si¬ cily ; when I gazed upon her forest- clothed heights, bedecked with fruit trees, vineyards, and corn-fields, her gioves, mountains, rivers, rocks, and islands—I hailed it, in the glee of my heart, the richest garner heaven e'er bestowed on man '" " He who shared our hospitality, and stole so uncourteously away, spoke of a spot more bright and dazzling," said Ro¬ salita , " of Lesbos, as far outvying all our sweets " " He spoke the language of prejudice, perchance of nature," rejoined the count " Magic
" Magic dwells in the land of our nati¬ vity, and cold must be the heart, and dead the feeling, which joys not in the sacred claim ' Lesbos was the bourn of his hopes and wishes is it marvel then, that her fields are greener, and her bios some bnghter, than any othei land ? " I have heard De la Pole tell of Eng¬ land, sud Rosalita, starting from deep thought " of Stoverton Castle, the chosen home of the countess his mother of Ha venng Bower, the loved retreat of the good queen Catherine, ay, and of Italy too—of the palace of the cardinal his bro¬ ther but De la Pole, and the glow of happy exultation bnghtened on her fair cheek, " never indulged prejudice at the expence of truth The count smiled Where exists a stronger prejudice than love ? yet he spoke not, for observation told him, De la Pole, in heart and principle, merited every panegvnc " De la Pole never paints England in other
other than her pwn true ami versatile hues," pursued Rosalita " He speaks of her, as a land pf blessedness, not of beau¬ ty , he enumerates her comforts, yet he yields the palm to the bright skies of Italy' " It may chance so," sud the count " yet on my life, England lies neaiest his heart But more of tin» stranger I would he had moved in sunshine, that memory, i» after-time, might hive blended hospitality with the fairy scenes of Sicily' You heard the splash of oars, and ypu lost him at the extremity of the terrace Did you track the boat ? Did you mark, whether it struck out to sea, or scudded along the shore ?" " I saw him leap the bushes, and 1 saw him no more, ' said Rosalita " My fan¬ cy was scared with strange wild images, ' and then she hinted at the tales of pirates and coi sairs, which Giovanni had heard at Cefalu The count listened attentively he too had
had heard and trembled at the depreda¬ tions of the barbarians, of the vast arma¬ ments from Afi ica, traversing the seas, and spi eading nun and flame, of whole villages ransacked and depopulated, of whole families sold into slavery But the storm heretofore had been distant, and he feared even to hint at the growl of the thunder, lest % ague and conjured terrors should mar Ле peace of life " You must not give ear to such strange stories," he observed " Helena is a dreamer, and doles forth ill Sure, the chance visit of one solitary stranger, could not give rise to such fearful inferences " " I told Helena, ' said Rosalita, eagerly, " that pirates moved not m moonshine, that they came not singly and in peace, that they------" " God forefend they come at all ' ' and the count Delia Monti shuddeied at the bare possibility Then rising, and lead¬ ing towards the door—" Let us to the terraœ, ' he pursued " The moining sun shines
shines bnght, and the breeze is balmv Belike tbe stianger may retuin, and mea sure our tlifls in open day Tliey proceeded to the ferrate for more than an hour they paced the teirace, but no passing shadow checkered the pathway the glassy sea too was motionless and calm no sill scudded ovei it, no boat ploughed its bosom Fiom Sicily they passed to England—for what can bind the flight of thought ' 1 hey talked of De la Pole—of the countess of Salisbury—of the young and gentle Uisula—of all to warm and inteiest the heart and the count softened into retollectious of the past, reverted to the brief dream of his own sojourn in the court of Henry the Eighth to the nobles and courtiers then filling the empty pageant and many a question wis asked and answered of things long gone by, ot persons long cradled in dust They talked of the princess Mary—of her years of brilliant promise, ofthe queen, the
the then happy and joyous Catherine, sur¬ rounded by her maidens, and planning and ministering to the pleasures of her impe¬ rious lord, of Havering Bower of the more princely domain of Windsor —and then they as suddenly diverged from Eng¬ land to the storm and to the shipwrecked stranger —and the count questioned so closely, and watched so narrowly, that Rosalita, without knowing how, became entangled in the mystery of his strange and unceremonious departure She was confused, agitated, her native candour foi¬ sook her, she bowed her head almost to her breast, to hide the fluctuations of her cheek 'lhat timid consciousness, tliat tearful sad emotion, revealed what her lips did not utter, that vision of beauty, so bright, so dazzlmgly resplendent, un¬ cloaked the secret 1 A new hght broke upon the senses of the fond father—Love, unreturned love, blighted in its cai liest dawnmgs, explained away every mystery ' " Speak out, my child, urged the count, " tell
" tell me all ? What did he dare to say ? —What did he dare to offer ? ' " Nought to move you thus, my dear father,' replied Rosalita " He spoke a strange language which my heart could not answei , he spoke of love, and I felt it profanation, for my thoughts were in England with De la Pole ' " Proceed, said the count, attentively regarding her " Did he submit as one without hope? or did he clmg to possi¬ bilities ' Maiden bashfulness spoke in the mo¬ dest blush and downcast ey es of Rosalita , yet her courage grev , and her heart felt lightened ofa heavy load, as she revealed all she knew of the stranger, and when she dwelt on the closing scene—on his re¬ giet and his despair—some touch of pity mingled m the indignation of the father He lemembeied his own deep absorption, his own passionate devotedness to the beauty and the gentleness of Mary Staf¬ ford and as he gazed upon the child of Mary

No matter we caie not whither he bends his rebel steps, so he comes not here Yet know¬ est thou not what countiy he inhabits?" "No my liege, ' replied Han y Ra venspur, for by that appellation we must distinguish bun fiom bis bi other. "I dispatched a messenger after him some two months past—nay moie, to trace his steps When my servant returns jour Highness shall know wheie he resides, and his means of subsistence, for I fear, my liege, your second message depnved lnm ofthe powei of making a piovision foi himself The puiport of rny mes- sengei s journey was to bear to him a small sum of money ' " 'Twas ill done," ıeplıed the King sharply " Alas « my liege," resumed the hypo¬ critical Heniy, " Alas, he is my brother '
" Well, resumed the King, " say no moie upon the subject Where is thy Countess ? ' " She has this instant left the Queen,' re|Oined Ravenspur, "to prepare for our departure. To monow, with youi Highness sleave,wepurpose to commence our joui ney to the north " " Not so soon,' replied the King, ' another week and then you shall de¬ part, wait till the messengei returns you say he has been gone two months, but see, the lady Ravenspui approaches. What beai s she m her arms > By my holi¬ dam, it is an infant cherub The Countess of Ravenspur in good truth did bear an infant cherub, and lay¬ ing it at his Highness s feet, asked " if ever he saw a moie lovely eieature but, my liege, you look with astonishment upon the b»ibe, w ill you hear its history As 1 left the palace even now, I met one of your Higl.iesss guaids, beanng in his arms that smiling babe.

6 The messenger entered even in his travelling dress, and having made his obeisance, he waited for the woid of command ere he opened his lip.«. " Well/ said his master, " where is my unhappy bi other f ' " No one knows, my lord, ' was the reply, " since his departure fiom the Flemish town, where first he landed, I have not been able to trace his route , I have posted sea and land, and tra velled day and night, but have not been able to learn aught of him, or any ot his suite " Ravenspur s apprehensions were qui¬ eted by this discreet reply, but he was thunderstruck when he found, upon ques¬ tioning his servant m private, that he had literally spoken the tiuth " Didst thou go to Milan—Venice— Naples ? ' " I did more, my loid, I applied in Italy to two tiusty fellows, and sent them several ways,—but all m vain , I
7
have even now dispatched two mto Spam, and another into Prance, to dis covei them, but I fear, my loid, that the puisuit will be in vain Their depar¬ ture from Flanders was so secretly con¬ ducted, that no trace whatever remains of then route Neithei loids nor la¬ dies, neither peasants nor soldiers, ap¬ pear to have been entrusted with their seciet " " Now by my hohdam, but this is strange," ejaculated Ravenspur " I must send thee off agam— they must be found—I cannot live in peace I a-n not safe while he is thus at laige Didst heai aught of Bohngbioke ?" " He is at the Fiench court, my lord," said Oliver, " and much m favour there; men say he is about to marry the Duke of Bern's daughter ' " Indeed 1" said Ravenspur, " that must be told the King Well, fellow, begone' tell thy lady I would see her ' в 4
8 Oliver bowed and withdrew,and Henry Ravenspur pacing the room, meditated on the most likely means ot discovenng his uuhappy bi other His «searches were however fruitless , no tidings could be procured of bis destiny till many years afterwards, when vague reports reached the ears of Henry Earl of Ravenspur A traveller having obtained an audience, declared that Ravenspur had embiaced the Mahometan faith, and was killed in an engagement with the Spaniards, another time he had perish ed in Barbary, while a third report consigned him to a cloister The lady Ravenspur, it was whispered, had died in childbed, leaving an only son, but where that son was, Henry Ravenspur never could ascertain But we are an ticipatmg events Richard, upon hearing that Boling bi oke was on the point ol marriage with the Duke of Berns daughter, imme diately commenced his opeiations to
9
prevent this alliance this he accom¬ plished and thus put the finishing stroke to the indignation of tht bravi and daring Hany Bohngbioke. It seemed indeed as if the unhappy King was resolved on accomplishing his own nun, but we have at present little moit to say of lum, than to lament Ins un timely cud and to hope that Ins suflu ings weie accepted as an atonement toi the errois of his life Ravenspur and Ins lady having dis¬ patched a part ol their tiain before them to Ravenspur Castle, in order to make some anangements agreeable to the Italian taste of Ins lady, one of the fellows who was appointed to this im¬ portant office enteied the castle with all the ins of one in petty authouty. ' Here, you fellow, ' said he, address mg one of the servants, " pull off my boots, and bung us a glass of Florence, old Sobriety, and hark'ye, you rascal, в 5
10
when next you pull my boots off, get a cushion for my foot to rest on " A cushion ' ' said the astonished man, " my late lord never used a cushion, not even when he said his prayers " Your late lord ' exclaimed Nico lai, the name of the new comer, ' what care I for your late loid , a bud in the hand is worth two in the bush , 1 ques tion whether he has got a boot to put on no «ν —they do say he is dead The colour fled the cheeks of Ro¬ bert and Maigery as Nicolai with the utmost coolness proceeded thus ' But it may be true or not, foi aught]! know I did hear that he had been guilty of some crime, and was put m confine ment " 'Tıs false said old Mai gei y, ti em blıng with passion , * tıs false, 1 tell you, he was the bravest noblest man that ever lived

" Aye, by my troth ami he was, added old Robert, fire flashing fiom Ins keen giey eye, " and you, sir, if )ou dare to say as much again, 111— " And so," said Clod, " you are fool enough, Robeit, to take the part of a condemned man , will you never leain discretion?

12
more to be compaied to our master that is, than light to daikuess " " Ah '" said Nicolai, " that's an odd comparison, Clod , look'ye, my master», I am heie as my lord's deputy, and 111 not suflèi myself to be imposed upon nor insulted." " Give us another flag- gon of Florence," quoth Clod, " and let us drink," said he, giving as a toast — *< May tlie hollow-hearted knave never prosper Nor the coward traitor succeed, May the right lord of this castle be hspjiy Nor с er lack a friend in ha need " Drink, Nicolai, drink , thou canst not ïefuse to dunk this toast noi you, Robert and Mai gei у , come, pledge mı» in a bumper do )ou not know which way the wind blows when you see a weathercock? Pshaw, nonsense, you old tool, Robert," (Robeit was wiping Ins eyes), "111 bet my cap and bells against your old cap, that I am the wisest man in the company lis merry inthe hall When beards wag all

" But, Nicolai, fuend, why look you so glum ' There, Robert and Margei y, get you gone, well have none of you I and the discieet Nicolai must lay oui heads togethei, lo make preparations foi his old master, and our new lord You, Maigeiy, must biush up the old Upestry, and stievv the looms with fiesh iiishes " Rushes and tapestry 1 ' exclaimed the niajoi domo , " I have brought vel vet and scailet cloth ' And you have done wisely, quoth Clod, " take down the old knights in the best loom, Maigery , it would be a pity they sho ild keep company with people they ¿o little ìesemble, as then intended occupieis " Take down the tapestry ' exclaim¬ ed Margery ' where Hildebrand, Loid R«ivenspur as laige as life slaying the huge Saraeen, and the lady Gertiude by his side on liei knees, exhoiting the vile idolatoi to turn Christian—oh, it w ould break my heart''

" Who talks of hearts now-a-days ? ' interrupted Clod , " they are only fat for daws to peck at Go, woman, and do our bidding Thou knowest the fate of the jay that was decked m bon owed plumes , wouldst thou have my loid, who can afford to buy his own, be under obligations to his ancestors ? Fie Mar gery, thou shamest me Go and dress the oak walls m sattın and velvets, and pic pare for the leception of a new lord m the newest fashion Tuck up thy pin¬ ners, and put on a veil after the Italian fashion. they who go to Rome, must do as they do at Rome ' Old Margery left the room, followed by Robert, while Clod continued altei iiately to excite doubts in tlie mmd of his companion, as to his own sentiments with regard to the new loid, and then to dispel them At lengtn the day arrived upon which the lord of Ravenspur was to take pos¬ session of this castle All was bustle and
15
preparation by the dawn of day Ni¬ colai, accompanied by Clod, was busy as a bee, while the lattei strove to hide an aching heart under the masque of folly " Ah ' ' said he, as he viewed the apai t ments destined (01 Angelina, " heie is indeed something worth looking at In stead of the grim tapestry, or tlie ster lmg plain and honest oak, heie we have silks, and sattins, and velvets ' Why, Maigery, art m.id ? why put those two cushions ? thiukest thou iny loid and lady can pray hei e > Here, where my lord's biothei that was, used to piay ami sleep ? I tell thee nay, they will pray in the chapel, where piayers should be said Thei e the Italian confessoi will take the place of Fathei Nicholas Maigery, do you know why people go to confes¬ sion ?" " That then sins may be forgiven them," replied Margery, with a sen-
16
timent which was genuine and heart¬ felt " Take my cap and jingle the bells, Maigeiy, thou ait a fool Dost know why a man eats his dinner ?' ' Why truly. Clod,' said Margery, because he is hungiy, as I suppose " Yet he wíl' eat a dinnei to moi row, resumed Clod, " then wheie is the use of eating a dinnei to day f What did the Roman Emperor do, one ol Nicolai s ancestois' Fie, Maigery, I shame to tell thee what he did , but lie eat moie dinnei s in a day than one Canst guess now why a man goes to confession ' Thou ai tdull Seest thou not he gets nd ot Ins old sins, that he may have the pleasme of sinning agam ' Nicolai knows this as well as any lord in Chus tendom. Where is Margery, tby daugh¬ ter ? Nicolai admii es her Tell the hunts man to look to his dcei and be sure, Margeiy, you do not oftend my lady s
17
tirewoman, by calling her nicknames So go to, thou hast thy lesson ; and let me have a posset anon " As Maigery left the apartment, Nico¬ lai asked Clod, " why he told the old cat he admired her kitten ' " To give you moie spoit in the chase,' was the reply, " dost think that the kitten, Margeiy, does not more ad- inn e thy nut brown face, and jet black eyes, than the small grey ones of Thomas ? Go to, we have not giown up togethei gul and boy, but she has learned to profit by my wit " " Thou art a queer fellow," replied Nicolai , " and 1 do desire a better ac¬ quaintance with thee If thou wilt be tuie, thou and I may feather oui nests well, and enjoy ouiselves comforta Ыу " I do desne an union between wis dom and folly, ' quoth Clod, " I sliall profit by our fnendship, depend upon it So I hear the trampling of horses now

for our lord Nicolai hastened to the pönal, and soon after he haa taken his post, Henry Ravenspur and his Countess entered tho great court yard With an air of condescension the former recog mzed old Robeı t and Margery " Ah, Robert, my old friend," said Henry Ravenspur, " thou art looking as fresh as when 1 left thee and Margery, too, is grown young again methinks. Thou remembrest me Robert, when I was no bigger than this urchin," he continued pointing to his son, who was about two year«, old " In good truth I do mv lord/ replied Robert, " my late lord 1 remember too And is that youi loıdshıps daughter? 1 knew not that you had two children ' " What a sweet babe '' exclaimed Margery, " and ш truth 'tis veiy like your lordship, very like indeed. ' The conversation of old Robertand his dame raised a cloud on the Earl s brow, and the smiles which had illumined Angelina's
19
countenance, fled as Margery gos¬ siped " Lead on," said Henry Ravenspur, " lead on. Where is Clod ?" " I thought he was at hand," re¬ plied Nicolai, and see. my lord, he approaches " How now, sirrah," said lus lordship, " where hast thou been that thou wert not ready to welcome us?" " Ihave been setting spnnges to catch woodcocks," quoth Clod, "an art I learned at court If your lordship will become my scholar, I will teach you Many a scholar has outshone his master, the chief mystery is in concealing the trap, and placing enticing bait I have failed sometimes—but not often to be suie old birds are not caught with chaff, but some othei time for this My lord, I have got a bunch of fresh coxcombs in my cap You may have these sun flowers, I gathered them for myself, forgetting they savour too much of

21
" But he pinched it even now, re plied Margery, <.s she presseli the little gnl to her bosom " Pshaw, nonsense, woman, it is but a foundlin » " Hold thy peace, fool, ' said Ange¬ lina, unable any longer to disguise hei inortitication, " hold thy peace, or else begoi)" and trouble us not ' " We II have thee whipped, sinah, if thou leain not better manuels, added Ravenspui Tliey luid by this time readied the hall when Heniy Ravenspur with a look of exultation welcomed his Coun- l»ss as mis'ress ot the castle Angelina with a icsjymsive look retuincd Ihe pressure of his hand, while her husuaiid pioudly suiveyed thesuitsot mail which adoined the hall Striding haughtily past them, he e«£plained to his lad) to whom they had belonged, but he stopped befoie one which was incom

plete " Who bas done this f" said hp, with changing cheek and point.ng to the suit of armour from which Raven¬ spur had taken the gauntlet and sword No one replied for some time, at last a buzz of voices protested, that they had not done it " It is of no consequence " said An¬ gelina, " youi armouiei can soon re¬ place it, and theie ate pei feet suites now without it " " You know not what you say," re¬ joined her husband, "but relire, jou must need lepóse Maigeiy, shew thy lady to hei chambei " Margery cuit- sicd, and pioceeded up the great oak staircase with trembling steps Pulling a string, she opened a door, then lifting the cloth hangings, she begged her lady would enter, and expressed a hope sht would find all things to hei liking " Now, deai lady," said Jacquelina, "and this is indeed a superb apaitment
23
Thou hast done well, old Margery, ' said tho tirewoman with an encouraging smile " I am glad you think so, my late lady was always pleased with my ex¬ ertions Is not that a handsome quilt, my lady > it used to be on the spare bed, but I thought you were used to the best of every thing My lady did eveiy stitch of it herself" " You may go now, my lady is weary, ' cried Jacquelina, observing ibe expression of Angelina s countenance " Take it off the bed instantly," ex claimed the Lady Ravenspur, " that,Ge- raldine, has been the bane of my hap¬ piness, even before I saw htr I U not stay here, at every step 1 take, old Mar¬ gery will be talking of hei late lady lllnotenduieit, Jacquelina, she shall quit the castle or I This room I think too large, it shall be appiopriated to my son and the little foundling " Dear me, Signora," interrupted Jacquelina,

" I am sure this is a beautiful apart¬ ment , and see, my lady, what a fine oratory, the window reminds me of that in your own apartment at Frescati Ah, my loved inistrees, why did you quit your" native land ' There you might have wedded some of our Italian nobles, and shone the gayest of the gay But here all is solemn gi andeur, and though the Earl has broke through the gothic customsof these English lords, and dines with you alone, yet uie must mix even with the ploughboys, and the lowest serving maids, while that tom¬ fool Clod will be ever ready to make his game at all " The Lady Ravenspur sat for some time immersed in thought, regardless of the observations of her attendant She then rose, and entenng the oratory, she did think that every thing was so com¬ plete, it would appear capricious were she to wish it changed " I will e'en content me here this visit, and when I
25
come again to Ravenspur, I will i,ive orders that allottici apaitment shall be prepaied for me I am quite weary, Jaquelina and yet m truth moie *ad than weary Fetch young Henry h eie ' Jaquehu ι disappeared, and quickly re¬ turned vv ith lhe boy, who, spoiled and riotous, was soon dismissed, and An¬ gelina miseiable, though in the gra tification of two of the most power¬ ful passions of the human heart, le¬ veuge and ambition, m vain sought repose upon liei splendid couch, the visions of her sleeping fancy were of Geraldine happy in the possession of the love of the exiled Ravenspur, and rich beyond all othei desue in the en¬ joyment of lus boundless confidence Staiting fiom her couch she exclaim ed, "111 sleep nomore^—her hated form pursues me everywhere' Oh Raven¬ spur' fiom my soul I hate thee ' and yet I could have joined my destiny to thine, and thought such a fate the extiemc of vol ii e

But why should your lordship trouble yourself about such stories ? I think 1 hear my lady coming—your lordship does not want ine now." " Stay," said Henry Ravenspur stern¬ ly, " stay Robert, while I repeat the words of the tradition, for now 1 think I can recai them too :—' When the gauntlet and sword from Hildebiand's armour are taken away, and riches, and glory, and honour increase, let the two youths bearing the same name who shall meet in close fight remember the old proverb, titles ill got profit not; for tbe younger shall supplant the elder, and with the hand of justice and power shall level the honours of lhe elder even with the dust.' Thus it runs, I think." " True, my lord/' said Clod, who had

About а month after the arrival ofthe family of Ravenspur in Yorkshire, as the Earl and his lady were one day walk¬ ing in the environs of their castle, a pil¬ grim apparently much fatigued was seen bending his sleps towards them. His figure was above the middle sizes his steps were feeble, and supported by his pilgrim's staff. His long white beard flowed upon his breast, which ever and anon, as the wind blew, concealed the lower part of his face. A long russet robe enveloped his bending form, and c 4

the slouched hat which shaded his fca tuics was adoined with a cockleshell He passed by the Loid and Lady Ra¬ venspui wilhout making any obseiva- tion or salutation and continued his journey stiaight Γοι wai d to the castle, when he enteied the gieat court, he was met by Clod, who, touching his bonnet, «aid, ' Save you, holy pilgnm, from whence comest thou ? ' " Benedicite, ' replied the pilgrim " I am come fiom a long pilgnmage, and journey homewaids I have been to the tomb of our Lady of Loietto, and there paid my devotions, but my vow is not complete, foi I have swoin to open my lips but to one and the same person m the course of foui and twenty hours, ho'ťevei gre.it may be my necessities Thou ait the hist person to whom 1 have spoken since the clock struck twelve at night, therefore till the houi of mid night strikes again, thou art the only peison whom 1 must address

The fool was much aflected ' if," said he, " I dare, and in this public place, I'd kneel and call thee lord, good pilgrim."

He had not howevei slept long, when he was awakened by voices seemingly in
64
high dispute He stai ted from his re¬ cumbent posture, and a« the wind brought a few words to his cars dis¬ tinctly, ho listened with profound alten tion " He cannot bave quitted the beach, ' said one of two persons who were descending a narrow road cut through the cliff, " or you 01 I must have seen him " The person who spoke this was not an Englishman , the pilgnm discoveied this by his accent, and in a few seconds he saw Nicolai pacing with inquisitive steps the beach He immediately con¬ ceived he was the object of whom they weie m search, and he therefore resolved to keep his position, supposing his ene mies would be tued of expecting him theie, provided he remained concealed till daybreak Nicolai m the meanwhile was ie solved on finding his victim, and there fore paced in every direction on the top of the cliff, while his companion
was stationed at the bottom , but dis¬ liking his situation he too mounted the clilf, and not bemg mterested enough m the pursuit to be veiy diligent, he contented himself with taking a seat in a conspicuous situation, which com¬ manded an extensive view on each side of hnn, and at last he fell fast asleep But the evil spirit which animated Nicolai prevented him from falling into the same eiror, he again and agam trod the narrow road, and dou¬ bled every projecting nook, but at length weary of the search, he stretch¬ ed himself for a few minutes on the ι dge of the cliff All now was still —no sound stole upon the eai of the anxious pilgrim, save the gentle lash¬ ing of the waves against the foot of the clifls, foi some time he remained in the cave, till, impatient at the delay, and feeling assured that all was safe, he rose softly, and with cautious steps
66
appi oaehed the entrance of lie cave, the tide had, liowever, risen smce his entrance to a consideiable height, and it was no longer practicable to descend the cliff In his boyish days he had often scrambled upward upon the like occasion, but even if he could now accomplish this he might be discovered by his enemies The stranger had fear¬ lessly faced death in many shapes, but there is something appalling even to the bravest, in the poignaid of the assassin Long, therefore, did he lin¬ ger at the mouth of the cave, but when the first rosy tint glowed in the cast he emerged from his place of conceal ment, and with some difficulty climbed the cliff, upon gaming its summit he found himself close to one of his pursuers, he stopped not to see which ot them it was, but with hasty steps ran along the edge of the precipice When he had left this man at some little
67
distance he paused for breath, and hu indignant check was flushed with rage and shame at the idea of stealing away like a coward from dangei,—he who had dared it in so m.uiy shapes While he VV.IS indulging these thoughts he hcaid some one appioaclung and turn¬ ing ι ound he perceived Nicolai almost close to lnm, for one instant the pil- f,11111 hesitated but no longei, tuin in,, fieicely round, he grappled wilh his enemy, wienched the poignard from his grasp, and hurled it into the sea The contest now became most inter¬ esting, and the pilgrim having thrown Ins adversary to the ground, there held Iıını toi a shoit tunc, as he exclaimed, Villainous coward, why dost thou seek my lile > thine is now in my power, but I scorn to take it, yet my own saletv demands that thou shouldst be disabled from pursuing me " As the pilijiim said this, he unloosed
68 Ins own girdle, while tht prostrate Nicolai, with a fiend like smile, ap peared to submit to necessity, as he said, " I know thee, Richard Ravenspur, thou couldst not deceive my piercing glance, thou dost tiiumph but for a few moments, thy fate is at hand " At this moment the second villain aimed a blow at the throat of Raven¬ spur, but the words of Nicolai had caused the Earl to turn a little round, andthe poignard glanced slightly against his arm, still however he was com¬ pelled to loose his hold, and Nicolai springing from the ground, rushed upon him, and with the assistance of his companion huilcd him headlong from the top of tho cliff Anxiously and with fiend-like joy they saw him whirl round in the air, then plunge into the briny deep—sink and rise no moie Foi a few minutes they gazed upon the watery element, but fearful of ie-

Ravenspur and his lady seldom made longvisi ts at Fitzhugh Castle,andstrange reports were abioad The servants beard frightful noises in the long galleries The north west tower was declared to be haunted, and once when the Italian priest was saying mass, a groan, so long and so loud, interrupted him, that the terrified domestics fled from the chapel The priest closed the book, and began a mass for the soul of the departed Earl of Fitzhugh, when the groan was re-

saken, the castle of Fifzhugh in solitary majesty sat mistress of its own fate, no one daring to approach it Harry Ravenspur s son and the found¬ ling, in the meanwhile, grew up together iu all the intimacy of brother and sister. The former was handsome, fiery, impe¬ tuous, and overbearing the latter was beautiful, gentle, and unassuming , yet she had been known more than once to oppose the commands of young Harry with a firmness which Angelina called obstinacy, and for which she was fre¬ quently confined to her own apartment, but this was no punishment to Gertrude, loi it was spacious and airy, and com¬ manded a fine view of the surrounding countiy It was indeed that which had been piepared foi Angelina, on her first ai ι îval at the castle, but which she had clianged foi anothei in the opposite wing fiom the adjacent nunnery When Gertrude was about sixteen years ot age, the lady Abbess sent a
75
message to the lady Ravenspur, re¬ questing she would pci mit the orphan Gertrude to spend one month in bei copvent Angelina, who was herself generally actuated by some particular motive when she stepped out of hci usual line of conduct, was rather puz zled as to the reason the Abbess could have, m thus demanding the society of a young gnl to whom she was a stran ger Mistiess of intugue upon all oc casions, and generally suspecting that every one was like herself, she partly granted the request and partly refused it She allowed Gertrude to visit the Abbess for one и epk only, and she was then to be accompanied by Jacquelina To this anangement uo objection could be made, and with a heart gay and buoyant, Gertrude set off for Raven spur nunnery, although she was accom pamed by Jacquelina Light as the fawns which frolicked îound her, she bounded through a part E 2

of the neighbouring forest " Ah," she cried, " how delightful it is to wander thus at large, and gaze upon the clear blue sky, and feel the wind upon my check, and see the waving trees Oh, I feel so happy ! Jacquelina : see how brightly and beautifully the sun shines upon yon distant sails; oh, what a lovely prospect !" " It is the same prospect you beheld but yesterday," replied Jacquelina. " Ah ! but it did uot look the same ; it did not seem so beautiful : I don't know why, unless it were that Lord Henry was by my side ; I never enjoy my walk so much when he is with me; he is not a great deal older than myself, but he is so grave and solemn ; and then be will not let me speak to those I meet. and I like to talk to the peasants, for they seem all rejoiced to see me, and ьау I am so like the exiled lady Ra¬ venspur." "Truly, youog lady," replied the
77
waiting-woman, " it seems a strânge reason you bave given, which makes the sun shine brighter to day than yesterday. But you vvill think otherwise at some future time." " No, never, never," resumed Ger¬ trude quickly, " it is quite impossible, unless Lord Henry change his nature. I am sure he never heard any of the tales which Robert tells of the great Hildebrand, whose armour is in the hall, nor of Richard, Lord Ravenspur that was, for though they were brave as lions in war, yet they were always gentle as doves to ladies." " But you are no lady," said Jacque¬ lina, sharply, " you are only a poor peasant girl, and he has a right to speak to you as such." Gertrude's colour roseto crimson, and her eyes sparkled with indignation as she replied thus : " If I am no lady bom, I am а woman, and noble or ignoble, that e 3

should protect me fiom the tyranny of any man in Chiistendom Lord Henry will never be a true knight, if he abuse his power, but I need not care for that, foi when I am grown a woman I shall—" But the smile on Jacquehua's coun¬ tenance pieveuted Gertrude from saying what she should do, and highly offended the lattei turned abiuptly fiom the ser¬ ving woman and left her Her elastic spints howevei soon regained their for¬ mer tone, and ere she reached the nun- nei y she was as bly the as the little birds which hopped around her The Ab¬ bess welcomed her with a mothei's af¬ fection, and ïeceived Jacquelina with ci vility Thei e vv as something in the man- neis of this nun vvhieh subdued the flippancy of the Italian, and when a lay sister was summoned and desiied to pay every attention to the stiangei, she 111- sliuttively and silently followed, al¬ though highly offended at being con-

the conversation upon the beauty ofthe castle, and the surrounding scenery. This was a theme which suited the ge¬ nius of the enthusiastic Gertrude. She loved to climb the mountain's brow, to scale the cliff; to watch the light clouds skimming on the surface of the deep. She delighted in penetrating the thickest gloom of the forest, or to skim lightly o'er the level mead : she loved to see the rosy rising sun; its golden mid-day brilliancy ; its purple evening glow ; she would gaze wrapt in a pleasing en¬ thusiasm on the crescent moon, or watch with exstacy its rising, when its full orb like a ball of fire gleamed par¬ tially through the forest trees. She sighed responsively as the evening breeze swept through the foliage, or with a thrilling delight listened when its invisible power shook the monarch of the forest, and levelled its leafy ho¬ nours with the dust. Charmed with her enthusiasm, the Ab-
DI bess listened attentively to all she des¬ cribed, and when the subject was ex¬ hausted, " daughter," said the amiable woman, "daughter, thou hast a mind capable of enjoying the wide expanded bounties of heaven ; thou hast α heart tremblingly responsive to every gene¬ rous, noble feeling. Let reason guide thy actions : such feelings as thine may lead thee far astray, unless under the guidance of that sober monitor; thou art frank and ingenuous, but these vir¬ tues may also lead thee into error. Let not thy speech unnecessarily wound thy superiors, I have no fear that it should grate harshly on those beneath thee; but remember, that although falsehood should never be spoken, yet neither should truth be spoken at all times, pru- dentia docet feminam." "Ah dear lady," replied Gertrude, " you could make me good, and prudent too; but at the castle I am teazed by ε 5

" Whom do you mean by the real lady Ravenspur ?

duct you to the apartment, where the boarders are assembled. My children," said the lady Abbess, as she entered the room in question, " I bring you an addi¬ tion to your society, the lady Gertrude ; to your care I commit her You will shew ber into the garden, and pay her every attention." When the lady Abbess left the apart¬ ment, the young ladies gathered round Gertrude, and each put some question to her. Gertrude had been used to so¬ ciety, and was soon perfectly at ease with her young companions, and when dinner was announced she accompanied them into the refectory. This day, and the following one was spent in a delight¬ ful succession of study and amusement, but on the third Gertrude was surprised at sightof Father Andrew. Jacquelina had insisted upon accompanying Gertrude into the garden on the two preceding days, much to the annoyance of the young lady, who although she was na-
85
tın ally disposed to bc kind and friendly to all, she never could relish the society of this waiting woman, who invariably made it a rule whenever she could to talk of Gei ti ude s low birth This was a subject which always irritated the pla¬ cid, cheeı ful temper of the lovely girl, for it was always accompanied by a pio- por lionate share of scorn Father Andrew, however, assured Jac- quelina that he should not permit her to accompany Attn, and therefore bade her depart " Retire," said the monk with the tone of authority, " and do thou young lady follow me " Gertrude obeyed, and Jacquelina was too much in awe of the monk to dispute his authority In silence he led the way, and a thousand suspicious arose m the bosom of his companion as to the nature of the monk's visit At length he slackened his pace, and finally halted quite " Gertrude," said he, " thou hast wit beyond thy years, but not dis-

action, else would I tell Ilice, why I brought thee hither, thou must there¬ fore only listen and obey, thou must ask no questions, make no remarks, noi, as thou valuest thine own safety and mine, declare to mortal being what passes here betweeu us " This was a solemn appeal to a gul of sixteen , but what did pass between them appeared so tunul, or at least so little woith re¬ peating, except to old Robeit, Margery, or Clod, that Gertrude wondered the monk should think it necessary to make a secret of it Having led her to a cross which was planted on a using giound, he bade her kneel down, and say a piayer for the house of Ravenspur, he then told her to use and follow lnm to that part of the garden which overlooked the sea shore " See'st thou aught, my daughter, on the wide stretched ocean ? ' " Nought, holy fathei," she replied, except the fisher's barks?" See'st thou, ' he cried, pointing to the beach, yon
87
palmer clad in lobes of grey ? Untie thy rosary, and diop it at his feet " In astonishment Gertrude obeyed, and the palmer looking upon her stedfastly a few moments picked it up, put it in his bosom,andturmngliastily away wassoon out of sight " Take Ihou this rosary/ cned the fathei, " and every time thou di oppest a bead, folget not the house of Rav enspui Return, fan daughtei, to the convent, and remember thou be discreet When she entered the building with the fiither, he led hei to the apartment oí the Abbess, and having given hei л benedicite, witlidiiw, leaving hci with luu ι ied spints, and inastate of sensa¬ tion she had never before expei lenced At night Jacquelina was exceedingly in quisitive asto what the fathei could have to say to hei , but Gertiude evaded giving an explicit reply, obseivmg, "that what passed between her and her father con¬ fessor could not possibly be of any ím- poilance to the serving-woman "
88
" I shall tell my lady, then," rejoined Jacquelina, " that you would walk m the garden without me, and that— ' " Tell her what you please, Jacque¬ lina, only leave me now, foi I am very weary, very sleepy, and I am sure you will fand me very stupid " Why as for that part of lhe story, it would not be the first time I have thought you stupid , for if you were not so you would make a fuend of me, seeing what influence I have over my lady' Gertrude opened wide her half clo¬ sed eyes as Jacquelina concluded this speech, theu quietly closing them again she said " good night,' and the indig¬ nant waiting-woman left the room, clos¬ ing the door after her with violence " She shall rue this insolence, I am re solved," said Jacquelina to herself as she bastdy proceeded to the small apart¬ ment assigned her "A foundling, a nobody-knows-who, to give herself

Gertrude expressed a wish that she were to remain in the convent for evei, kissed the Abbess's hand, and joined her youthful companions. " Heaven bless thee, sweet scion of a noble stock," said the Abbess, crossing herself, " would to heaven I dare detain thee here; but the vvill of heaven must be obeyed " Early on the following moining Ger¬ trude retraced her steps to the castle, and with a sigh entered the great hall, where the lord and lady Ravenspur then were ; having paid her respects to them, she hastened to her own apartment, and at dinner time she took her usual seat by Lord Henry.

This drew upon her the severe ïe- proofs ot Angelina, and the taunting jeers of Jacquelina, who was constantly recalling to her the meanness of her origin, and the high birth ot the young Loid Heniy " Now I am ashamed of you," she would say " What' when the young loid would condescend to walk with you as his companion, you shun hun ? know yourself better, young lady, 01 I can tell you my lady will send you to Raven¬ spur Nunneiy, and you will bs obliged to take the ν eil Why my lady says she

" All things," said she, " are smiling around me Ah, happy Clod ' there he is, free to say and do what hr pleases. Happy tool, I envy thy humble lot

Would to heaven I had wings and could fly away from this stately castle. But whither should I go ? I have no friend, no parent, no one that really loves me, except old Robert and Margery, and they will soon be dead,—what will then become of me > ' These melancholy musings softened her heart to tears, and she wept silently for some time. She was however at length roused from her revene by the rustling of the arras, which was slowly lifted, and to "hei astonishment Clod stood before hei, he stopped at the entrance with his cap in hand, and icspectfullv lequestedshe would repair to old Robert, who was suddenly taken ill, and wished to see hei " " Old Robert ill · ' she exclaimed, " he must not die, he is almost the only living friend 1 have in lhe world Lead me to him immediately " Clod again raised the arras, and opening the door, Gertrude passed on,

Old Robert was not more deeply la mented by Margery his wife, than by Gertrude The old man had alwaj«, looked up to her, even when an infant,
123
as a cherub fallen from heaven, and as she advanced in jears, he considered her little less than angel, both as far as related to her mind as well as person He gathered the earliest blackberries for her, and when autumn had ripened the hedge nuts, he would take her with him, and sci amble down the highest boughs, sometimes at the risk of his neck, that she might pluck the invi¬ ting fruit With many tears she followed him to the grave, and would gladly have shut herself up with old Margery for the rest of the day, but Angelina, who mocked her gnef, forbad her to quit the withdrawing room, and Lord Henry proposing a walk, Gertrude was com pelted to accede to his request " Which way, Gatty, will you walk ? said young Heniy as he entered the court-yard " I care not whither," replied Ger о 2

" I am an orphan, friendless, paient- less, and can you ask what cause I have to mourn ' Alas ' I never knew a mother's love, nevei knew the bliss ot kindled love Nay, my good loid, howu not thus I know the loid and lady Ravenspur have been kinder to me than my lowly Ые deserved But

I am undeserving of the favours that are lavished on me, and would therefore rid them of their burthen. I could wish, my lord, that you would stand my friend in this, and ask permission of my lord, your father, that I might hide roy humble head within the walls of Ravenspur Nunnery." Gertrude had not raised her eyes to Henry as she spoke ; ehe did not there»· fore observe the burning blusb of indig¬ nation, succeeded by the paler hue of anger, which alternately flushed and blanched his cheek ; nor that his arched eyebrows scowled over his fine dark eye, and his quivering lips, which re¬ fused their office, were colourless as the lily. She became, however, sensible to bis shaking frame, and raising her eyes, his aspect was so terrible to her gentle spirit, that she made an attempt to withdraw her arm from within his, but he held her fast, and in broken ac¬ cents exclaimed, " I request that you
m
should quit the castle, and hide yom- self m a nunnery ! Never, by heaveiii Gertrude, shall you quit our roof no, 1 love you, and my mother has waved your lowly birth, and promised that m two years more you shall be my bride Yes, Gertrude, ' he continued, as he looked around, " you shall be mistiess ofthis brave domain,—Countess of Fitz¬ hugh, for Richard has said as much Why tremble thus, my beloved Gatty ? 'Tn joy, you did not anticipate such overwhelming news, I see, but believe 'tis true, Yet you are cold ! cold as ice, your lips turn pale lean, bear on me, my love Oh, heavens, she faints' the joy's too much for her' Wake, dearest Gertrude, awake, 'tis Henry calls " But in vain he called, and now lifting her from the ground, he bore her to a using knoll, and there left her while he ran for help Clod was within hearing, and answered his call. At sight of Ger¬ trude, whose lips were just resuming a
128
slight flush, he asked his lord, " what caused the lady's swoon ? ' " Fetch water, fool, and icmove the evil, heed not the cause/ replied young Henry. By the time he returned, Gertiude was rev ived , while the impassioned and delighted Henry kissed hei hand, and was supporting her by one aim round her waist In vain she endeavoured to disengage herself from his hold he still persisted, till at last Gertrude, exerting herself, said, " Loid Henry, tins is un¬ manly , I request you will release me ' Fue flashed from the young lord's eyes as Gertrude freed herself tioin his hold, and, staggering forwaid, refused to take his arm " 'Tıs well," be said , " you play the Countess soon ' but, Gertrude, beware, the piey is not yet gia«ped Clod, be gone, we want not you, but a look from Gertrude declared she did want lnm, and the fool left them lor a short

" So, Gertrude, said the famihar waiting woman, " so you have greatly
131
offended my young lord, and be has just told the lady Countess, his mother, of your wish to go to a nunnery ; and, i 'faith, its my opinion you will be sent there, whether you like it or not, for my lady is greatly offended with yon ; and declares that when she quits the castle you shall not accompany them to court." Gertrude's heart bounded with de¬ light at this intelligence, though she forbore to give vent to her feelings upon a subject she had so much at heart ; and Jacquelina, misconstruing this as the ef¬ fect of regret, promised " to speak a word for her ;" but neither did this act of friendship elicit a reply ; and the tire¬ woman flounced out of the room with indignation, and hastened to her mistress. About a quarter of an hour before din¬ ner, Gertrude was summoned to attend the Earl of Ravenspur in the withdraw¬ ing room. When she entered he was pa¬ cing tbe chamber with haughty steps, and с 6
ш
for tlie first few inmutes after hei arrival he took no notice of her, there was something so stem ni his look that she shrank from advancing, aud still held the arras in her hand as if she wished to se¬ cure a retreat, when he stopped short befoie her, and bade her let go the ta¬ pestry and advance " Gertrude, said his Lordship, ' 1 am told you Hiernach upon our favour, and fancy that our love may w vrraiit pride m you Lord Htm y compi uns you treat btm with contempt, yet whe ι ever the heir of the house of Ravenspui speaks or looks at you, he pei forms an act of condescension ' Gertrude was bai ely seventeen, and she may theiefore be paidoued for feeliii D so completely subdued by the haughty and ungeneious lau H uiige ot her patron, as to be deprived ot the powei ot speech Her beating heart, however, betrayed bow much she felt, and hei crimson biovv bespoke her indignation The lord of

Ravenspur had never deigned to waste much ot his breath upon so liisignificaut a being as Gertrude, and »is he paused, she concluded he had alleati y said all he might have to say, and that there- loie her presence was uo longer neces¬ sary , anxious to be gone, she turned towards the door, when his voice agam airested her ' Stay, Gertiude, whither would you go ?

134
"Gertrude," cried Lord Ravenspur, fixing bis eyes on the orphan girl, " Ger¬ trude, know you what you say? now by my holidam," he continued, "but that fragile form encloses a spirit of a stubborn cast—but it must be subdued, and shall. Mark me, and hear our pur¬ pose : orphan as you are, and found¬ ling too, whose parentage no one knows, yet thus nameless and parentless, the heir of our noble house loves you, Ger¬ trude, and two years heuce you shall be his bride. He has honour enow to ennoble even y ou, and since you are the chosen lady of his love, look to it, or a nunnery shall teach you obedience. You are young: you must be taught your duty, if you know it not. What ! scorn the proffered love ofthe youthful Henry i Next week we go to court: you will re¬ main behind, yet not here, to flaunt you in the forest, nor pace from room to room at will ; no, in good sooth, a convent's walls shall answer for yonr safety and
135
your conduct: for methinks the girl who could refuse a suitor chosen by her friends, aye, and benefactors too, would be much inclined to chuse without their leave. To your chamber till the bour of dinner." v Gertrude gladly obeyed thia last com¬ mand, rejoicing in her own heart at the punishment she had brought upon her¬ self. So light indeed were her spirits, that her cheerfulness was attributed to the wish of appearing more amiable, in order to change the intentions of her patrons. But Angelina was resolved on making the luckless girl sensible of her power, and she therefore never addressed her, except once, and that was to tell her her " that her disobedience and unman¬ nerly conduct towards Lord Henry must be extenuated by penance in Ravenspur Nunnery." Lord Henry was highly offended at this arrangement, which would separate him from the object of his love; he
136
loved in good sooth after indeed so rude a fashion that his love scarcely deserved tbe name He bad hoped Geitrude would have been compelled to obey his beck and call, but the lady Angelina imagined that the seclusion of а шш tiery was better calculated to subdue hei spirit than the unceasing ptotestations of love from her son She also munit to give directions to the lady Abbes·! that Gertiude s situation should be made as sti ict as possible, ш order to indue hei to seek e>unestly foi a leturn to tlic woild, which could only bf effected by means of the Ravenspur family, and positively forbad all intercourse with ľather Andrew The day, thcietoie preceding her departuie for Loudon, she îepaired to the convent with Gertrude who, without a sigh, paited from thon; wilh whom she had lived чпсе infancy Geitrude was not ungrateful she felt the obligations she was under to the Ľ id and his Countess but then late
137
unkindiiess and tyranny, her dread of lord Heniy, and the disgust she felt at his selfish love and ungenerous conduct, made her forgetful iu some degiee of the obligations she really was under to them As tbe Countess left the con¬ vent pai lour, Gertrude felt relieved from a weight of anxiety, and when the tramp¬ ling of the horses was no longer heard, she fetched a deep breath, it could not be called a sigh, as if she had suspended respiration until hei oppi essors were be¬ yond hearing She then turned round, and with a smile approached the lady Abbess " Daughter," said the Abbess, " thou hast heard the orders of the Countess, retire then to the cell appointed for thy leception Except thaT thou ait not lo take the veil, young as thou art, the iules of oui holy Older aie to be strictly followed " ' Äly good mother,"replied Gertiude, who saw, oi fancied she saw, that tho
138
Abbess was no ways so stern as she af¬ fected to be, " My dear mother, most I gladly would 1 accept the alternative of taking the veil rather than wed Lord Henry." " Daughter," resumed the Abbess, " this is a style of language unbefitting your tender years, and unfitting for me to hear. To-morrow I will have some conversation with you, but to-day your spirits are too much agitated, too much flurried to fix your attention to aught that I could say. Remain here a short time and I will fetch a sister, to whose charge I shall more particularly consign you." The person of the Abbess was «tall and commanding ; her voice was sweet, yet firm ; her face was oval, her eyes dark, and her complexion sallow ; her general expression of countenance was benevo¬ lent, and her manner of address pleasing. She had passed the meridian of her days, and was in every respect well calculated
139
to fulfil the duties of her arduous situa¬ tion. Her mode of conducting herself towards her nuns was affectionate and kind ; but she was steady in her resolves, , and just in' her judgments. That she more admired some of her community than others was true—but she was im¬ partial in the distribution of her favours. álmost the whole of her society was composed of females born in tbe supe¬ rior ranks of life. Of these, the greater part had been educated within the con¬ vent, and had never known the pleasures of social life and kindred love : for this reason they were happy. There were, however, a few who had been permitted to enter this religious house, when they had been nuns some years; but Леве instances were rare, and were sanctioned from some extraordinary concurrence of circumstances. Of this number was sister Agues, with whom the Abbess, after a short absence, returned and intro¬ duced to Gertrude. " Daughter." said
140
the «Vbbess, addressing the nun, " you will instiuct Geitiude in the pcilonn- ancc ot those duties which it is the Countess s commands she should pci- lorin , as, however, I considei hei too young to endure the rigours enjoined by our holy ordei to your disdettoli I commit her Geitrude, you will look upon this sister as a second mother, in myself 1 trust you will find another the bour of vespers is at hand, sister Agnes will conduct you in the mean time to the small apartment adjoining her own cell, and there you must re¬ main at all times, unless she to whom I depute my authority in part, shall give you leave to join the rest of the community " Gertiude s spirit died within her at this speech, she had anticipated the pleasure of lenewing hei former ac quaiutance with many ol the young la dies at the convent, who weie about her own age, and with whom she hail
141
hoped to join in uinoeent amusement she had promised to herself lhe delight¬ ful walks they should have m the ex¬ tensive pleasure grounds belonging to the convent, and had flatteicd herself she was about to associate with those, who«)e bosoms could beat íesponsively to hers when her enthusiastic mind painted in glowing colours, lhe beauties of nature In an instant the fairy scene she had conjured up appeared lo vanish, and the form of Lord Henry presenling itself to her view, as seen in her late stroll with lnm, could alone have indu¬ ced her to submit graciously to that necessity winch immured her m a con vent's walls In silence she bowed to lhe lady \bbcss and sister Agnes, whose face was pai tiy concealed by her veil " Sister," said Ihe nun, taking Gei¬ trude by the hand, " I will lead thee to thy cell, there thou wilt find the dress of a novice of St Dominic, for so the Countess wills "
142
The Countess appeared indeed to have taken the most studied pains to render the situation of Gertrude as un¬ comfortable as she could, and the feel¬ ings of the latter were consequently greatly irritated against Angelina,- strug- ling however with the sensations which swelled her heart, she bowed to the lady Abbess, and following sister Agnes, left the apartment.

Ravenspur Nunnery was a supeib monastic building of the gothic style of architecture. The foundation of the monastery itself might be called square, although a gothic projection upon three of its sides and four round towers at the corners prevented the formality of this
144
shape To the fourth side the chapel was attached The principal entrance was opposite this chapel through a noble gothic arch, which extended through the whole of the building, and opened into the beautiful and sacred place of wor¬ ship Two other cloisters crossed the building in the middle, each terminating in a large gothic window, beneath which was a small door of entrance, that led into llie extensive gardens of the mo¬ nasteiy On the lower story was the Abbess s silting room, adjoining the cha¬ pel Opposite to this was the ìefectory, one portion of the remainder of the ground floor was adapted foi the in¬ struction of boarders, and the other was appropmted to the domestic purposes of the kitchen, buttery, &c &c The ascent to the upper part of the house was through a narrow passage close by the two painted windows, con¬ nected with a winding stair in the round towers, and led to the nuns' cells There

On the following morning Gertrude was indulged with the promised ramble in the garden, and, bounding with the lightness of a lawn along the fine avenues which adorned the extensive grounds of the nunnery, she vepaued towaids that pait which commanded a view of the sea This was an object which always gave her pleasure, and
162
thithei she often repaired. One evening in paiticulai she had wandeied about lor some time, but at length took hei station opposite the ma|eslic ocean , it was covered with fishing boats, and in the distance was a vessel making slowly for the shore , but the layy wind flapped idly and lightly m its sails, and at length a little boat was hoisted out " I wish/' said Gertiude, as she watched the gathering clouds and neai appioachot the sea-gulls towards the land, " I wish the manners would not put out a boat, I hate to see the white wings of the sea- mews shine so bnghtly against the daik, dark sky I am suie 'twill be a storm, the fishing boats aie making fast for land Oh, heaven presei ve them all 1 " she continued, crossing herself A few large diops ot tain fell upon her extended hands, and a slight flash of lightning was followed by the thunder muttering in the distance Gertiude now hastened to the stump of an old

and lhe lady Abbess desiied the porlicss would admit Clod to the grate Thithei Gertiude lepaired, and found Clod, cap in hand, full of intelligence "How does old Margeiy?' was the first question Geitiude put, which being answered, was followed by many inqui¬ nes respecting the favourite hawk, spa¬ niel, greyhound, &c. " Well, all well, vv as the reply, " but, lady, there is a messenger just come from Wales, and the King is made prisoner they say by Bohngbroke, and Шц y Ra¬ vcuspui has left King Hiehaid, and gone no one knows wlntliei anil the lady too, and the loid Henry all -uc gone it is said that Bolnigbioke will be king, and a messenger came last night beanng the present Eail of Ravenspui s signet and packed up all the jewels, and gold and silver cups, and took them away with him The whole countiy is in alarm, and heaven only knows what will be the end of all this tuimoil.

throughout the convent struck an awe upon her heait, which for ono instant de¬ terred her from executing hei purpose " Why should I fear > she exclaimed, and instantly closing the dooi, she be¬ gan her nocturnal adveutuie All how¬ ever was so death-like that she again hesitated but renewing her courage, she lightly trod the gallery, and with cautious steps descended the winding stan , when she leached the bottom of the last flight, and had passed through the little passage which led into that which crossed the chief corridoi, she fancied she heaid a low rustling noise Hei heart now beat so violently that she could scarcely endure the sensation, and creeping closely behind one of the reed like columns, which rose from the flooi and suppoited the aiched roof, she saw a figuie Ilıt along the principal aisle Great as was her feai, her cuno¬ sity was greater, and gliding fiora her

On the following morning, at five o'clock, when the nuns and novices weie assembled at matins, Gertrude was missing Si&ter Agnes,who was re¬ stored to health j went to seek her, but she was not in her cell " Gracious heaven defend me," exclaimed the nun, as she hastily scanned every thing in the loom. rf Gertrude !" she called two or
188
three times, opening the door of every cell as she passed through the gallery " Gertrude ' ' she ïepeated as she de¬ scended the windmg stan aud hav ing searohed eveiy part of the house, and inquired of all tliose peisons who were not in tho chapel, she uished into the midst of the nuns, and just aiticulatcd " Gertrude is gone, ' and fell senseless All was now confusion, everv one has¬ tily left the chapel, and the house was again and again searched through and through, but no tiace of Gertrude re¬ mained The nuns then dispersed them¬ selves m every part of the garden, with the like ill success The Abbess was m despair, and sister Agnes sunk into a state of despondency, which threatened hei existence, she would suffer none to approach her, ex¬ cept the lady Abbess and her confessor Every inquiry was made m the neigh¬ bourhood!, but without the least satis faction, and Gertrude's departure was
189
attnbuted to a supematuial agency Sister Frances was now fully confirmed in her belief that she had really and actually seen a ghost, and many of the sisterhood, who had hitherto considered her stoi y as the effect of a superstitious credulity, were now proselytes to her opinion After this event they were never seen but in pairs as evening ad¬ vanced and sister Frances piotested that Gertrude had provoked bei fate by her daring conduct, in venturing at mid¬ night to meet a spirit Sister Agnes soon after this melancholy event retui n ed to her foimer convent, and the lady Abbess sunk into a depression of spirits which was unusual to hci. In this dilemma we must leave the convent of Ravenspui, and letrace our steps by accompanying the lord and lady Ravenspui fiom their castle, to join King Richard Then journey was however m vain, for the King was not arrived from Ireland, and instead of re-
190
turning to Ravenspur nunneiy, they went to Titzhugh Castle, tliey ι emani - ed here however but a short time, for the news of Bohngbioke landing in England completely alteied then plan of action The lady Ravenspui advised they should unmediatel) convert then propeity into money and sail to Italy for Frescati but Henry Ravenspur pro¬ posed offering his services to Bohng¬ broke, and thus secure his favours, as he was however aware that Bohng¬ broke was no less politie than brave, he thought it advisable to send to him rather than to visit lnm The answer of Bohngbioke was ambiguous "Let the Eail ot Ravenspui feai nothing, the biave and loyal will ever find a fnend in Heniy Bohngbioke " " I like not this answei, said Raven spur, addressing his lady " Then it is time we should quit Cn gland, ' replied Angelina " 1 would ad¬ vise that we should send Jacquelina and
101
Nicolai to Ravenspur Castle, to secure what ticasure is needful, and to cmbaik with it forthwith for Italy Clod too should accompany them , he is a trusty knave But what think you, ' then she continued, after a shoit pause, " think you that Bolnigbioke alludes to Richard Ravenspui, and calls him Earl of Ra¬ venspui ' ' " I do, ıeplıed her husband , " and if I had been wise, I should have attend¬ ed to those reports, which I, deceived by Nicolai s tale that he was drowned, deemed idle tales yet now, methinks, 'tis not too late 1 would give the half of all that I possess to be assured that Richard's bones were mouldering in the dust Would to heaven some tiusty friend— " Hush, my Lord," interrupted Ange¬ lina, " walls may have ears, and low¬ ering her tone, she proceeded thus " If Gertrude were wedded to our Harry, all
192
yet might be well ; were she but here, we could compel her to submit : 'twas ill judged to leave her at the monastery." " Most true," resumed her lord ; " thou shalt to Ravenspur and fetch her. Send hither Clod, he may be faithful ; but there are some who are most honest when most they are watched, and so methinks is he." Their plans thus arranged, were soon carried into execution ; and the lady Ravenspur arrived at the castle the day after Gertrude was missing. Clod was absent upon one of his solitary excur¬ sions, and the Countess having dispatch¬ ed Margery to the convent for Gertrude, her surprise may be imagined, when in¬ formed by the terrified and heart-broken Margery, " that the lady Gertrude had been spirited away by α ghost." She was loud in reproaches and lamentations upon the subject; and threatened to lay a complaint against the lady Abbess
193
before lhe general of the ordei, of the inattention and lax discipline of her convent Her anger, howevei, evapoialed in thieals, and aftei continuing one week only at Ravenspui, she ïeceived a mes¬ sage fiom hei loid, desinng her attend¬ ance at the castle of Fitzhugh " I have icceived ceitain intelligence of the ai rival of Richaid Ravenspur in Eng¬ land, ' said he, " and have, besides, an idea that the ghost of Geraldine, which has been seen in the castle and at the convent, is Geraldine heiself, come, therefoie wilh all speed to Fitz¬ hugh, and piepaie instantly to quit England Heniy is with me, and a guest you will little expect to see but of this be suie, one whom you will think a welcome one Haste theu, deai chuck, and join youi own tiue " Henry " Just befoie Angelina left the castle Clod leturned home, he looked haiassed vol u n.
194
and dejected, and scarcely could find an answer to his lady s salutation She smiled snicastically upon lnm as she said, " Clod, you too look as if you hnd seen a ghost " The fool clianged colour, tliough he pretended not to hear, and passed on to old Margery s apartment while Angelina, entering her litter, jour ncyed towards her lord She was no sooner gone than Clod declaied very solemnly that he had real ly and truly seen a spirit Old Margery s flax fell from her hand, as she mtreated lie would explain the whole of his ad ventures to her " You know, said Clod, " how I laughed at the story of the nun s seeing a ghost, and at the idea of all such non¬ sense hut, Holy Virgin defend me,— lhe fust night after I got to the other castle 1 was awaked by a low moaning noise of some one in distress, I started up but my hair stood on end, for at the foot ol my bed was the lady Geraldine, with
195
her hair dnpping wet, and her whole form looking precisely as if she was just dragged from the ocean she looked mournfully at me and vanished 1 was so terrified that I could not move foi some time, and when I did recover, I lose and went to another apartment till morning 1 should have thought this was a dream, but the next night I saw it again, and on the following day the spirit of the lady Gertrude appeared in one of the galleries, it, too, looked distressed Spirit of the lady Gertrude ■ it must be she hei self, ' answered Mar- gei y ' You have been so long away, Clod, you do not know what has been „oing on here Why the lady Gertrude went to look after a ghost at the imu¬ nei y, and she was herself spirited away, and is no where to be found, and lhe lady Ravenspur was exceedingly angry ' Say no more, ' said Clod, " get me a stoop of wine, give me a luncheon of к 2
196 bread, and my staff III be back to FitzhughCastleunmediately Send some one to Father Andrew, and III go and see what I can do for hei in the mean¬ while Quick, good Margtry, quick. ' While Clod pursues Ins second jour¬ ney, and old Maigery dispatches some oue to the monastery, we shall explain how Gertrude's spirit, which was still enclosed in its beautiful prison house, ap¬ peared to poor Clod, whose senses had been so much affected by the repetition of the appearance of the spuit of his much loved lady, that he could not dis¬ tinguish the real foun of Gertrude fiom that of a ghost, and in oidei to accom¬ plish this, we shall give the simple nar¬ rative of facts which befel Gertiude on the memorable evening of hei noctur¬ nal adventure in the convent When she recovered her senses, she found herself enclosed in a covered litter, which was moving apparently at a brisk pace Once or twice some ono undrew the
197
curtains and looked in, as if to see whether she hid ïecovcicd her senses, but no one spoke to her Food was offered to her at break of day There aie always coiruptible persons every where, and one of the lay sisters, who was portress in Ravenspur Nun¬ nery had admitted Fathei Rupert into the convent, and concealed lnm, that be might be ready to profit by an opportu¬ nity which might offer of carrying away Gertrude, because although the Carl of Ravenspur could have demanded her re¬ turn, yet he wished not that it should be known she was wilh lum , he had his reasons for being secret, and Father Rupeit, who was his confessoi, undei- took to execute his lord s behest». The stoi y of the ghost of the lady Raven¬ spur he laughed at, though he aftei waids saw a similar appearance himself, but, at any iate, he thought as Geitrude in¬ tended to go spirit-hunting, her curiosity upon this sub|ect might possibly assist кЗ
198
his nefarious plans. The lay-sister con¬ trived that he should quit the convent unseen, in order that he might make arrangements with some of his country¬ men, who were in the service of Raven¬ spur, and himself was again admitted by the lay-sister. He saw the spirit of the late lady with feelings not quite at ease, but yet still without fear. When Gertrude followed it, he did not dare to stop her then, knowing that she must return that way; and as he suspected the spirit might possibly have a mortal frame, he thought it advisable not to disturb its progress by the little bustle which the seizure of Gertrude might produce. With exultation he beheld her tottering steps as she issued from the chapel, and saw with pleasure that her colourless cheek bespoke great terror. When she turned down the right hand passage, he hastened to direct his mi¬ nions to that side of the garden ; and the lay-sister having opened the door to him,
199
Gei ti ude was, as vv e have seen, conveyed from the convent In this mysterious manner she jour¬ neyed for several hours, and when the litter was lifted fiom the horse, a thick veil was thrown over hei, and she was conducted to an apartment, the windows of which were so high from the floor of hei chamber that it was impossible to look out of them Here she remained alone the whole day, musing on her ex¬ traordinary adventure, and listening with intense anxiety, as she heaid doors in different parts of the building open and shut At length some one approached her chamber, her heart beat quickly as the lock slowly turned, and the arras was lifted, but she retreated to the farthei end of the apartment as ľatliei- Ru¬ pert entered, holding in his hand a ti ípod lamp, which threw a strong glare on his expressive featuies, although its feeble rays illumined but a small part of her B.4
200
extensive apai tinent Of all men m the world, Fathei Rupeit was the man she most disliked and dieaded the stern¬ ness of the Earl of Ravenspui was less ten ific to her, than the penetrating glance and cool repioof of the monk who now approached her "Daughtei, said the father, as he placed the lamp on the table, and seated himself in a narrow, vet high oaken chair, ' Daughtei, 1 am the bearer of a message from the Earl of Ravenspur, he himself is too much indisposed at pre¬ sent to visit you, as he has just received certain intelligence of the death of his brother, who was killed fighting against the Spaniards in the Mooiish anny Here the father crossed himself, and he added, " Heaven forgive the base deser¬ ter of the religion of his fathers Geitrude was speechless at this intel¬ ligence " He fell resumed the luar, " as a co wai d should tall, in ignominious flight.
201
" I do not believe it," said Gertrude bursting into teais, "for he was one of the bravest knights that ever wore a belted swoid" " Daughter,' interrupted the monk, " do you dare to doubt my word ? Per¬ haps too you will dispute the truth of lady Ravenspur s death m ihild-biitb ! ' At this moment the lamp burnt faintly, and thè quivering flame became in a few moments extinct The fuar ex¬ claimed, " Presumptuous girl ' a super¬ natural power is even now"—But he said no more, for the fuither end of the apartment was gradually illumined, and there appeared a knight in a Moorish habit, whose features boi e an exact re¬ semblance to the picture of Richard Ra¬ venspui, yet the countenance was fiercer Gertrude was horror struck, and the monk, diawing his cowl over his face, was mutteiing at»e marias as fast as bis lips could articulate them While Gei- K 5
302
trude gazed, the vision stalked sullenly away, and seemed to vanish at the other end of the apartment ; it was followed by a female figure, who with a dejected countenance crossed herself, and a soft sigh stole upon tho ear of Gertrude. "It is the lady Ravenspur !" she exclaimed, and rushing forwards to clasp the benign form, she found it " not palpable to feel- ingastosigbt/'butmockingheiOinbrace, and eluding her grasp, it vanished into " airy nothing." Getti ude's highly-wrought feelings were too much for her, and she fell on the ground, half fainting. Her fall roused Father Rupert from his prayers, and groping about, he at length exclaimed, " Daughter, where art thou î" But an no one answered, he raised his voice, calling for a light, when the lamp gra¬ dually became self-illumined, as it should seem, and he hastened to raise the terrified girl, and place her in a chair.
203
He then left the apartment, and dispatch¬ ed a female attendant to Gertrude, him¬ self hastening into the chapel. • Jeannette, the attendant of Gertrude, was terrified at the pallid cheek, and half suppressed, yet heavy groans of the lady. As G ertrude refused to explain the cause of her alarm, the girl at last asked " if she had seen a ghost ?" Gertrudeshud- dered, and Jeannette drawing closer to her, looked fearfully round the room. " This castle," she whispered " is full of them, ever since the old lord died ; and they do say he did not come fairly by his end. But 1 will sec if Father Rupert is gone quite away, for he would never forgive me if he heard me say so." Jeannette raised the arras, and be¬ tween it and the door stood the father. Something between a laugh, a scream, and a ery burst from Jeânnette's lips, and falling on her knees, she intieated lie would be merciful. " Begone," said the father; a command к 6
204
she very readily obeyed ; and hastening to the kitchen, she there gave vent to her feelings, and protested that she be¬ lieved old Father Rupert had dealings with the devil. But we shall leave her to hold forth at her discretion, and re¬ turn to the chamber, where Gertrude was again tête-à-tête wilh the monk. " Daughter," he began, " I have re¬ covered the dismay into which the su¬ pernatural appearances vve lately wit¬ nessed had thrown my spirits, and shall now therefore proceed to execute my commission. 1 come from the lord of Ravenspur, to tell thee thou must in¬ stantly prepare to quit England, which is uo longer a safe habitation for the friends of the falling Richard. We are bound for Italy, and to-morrow (after tliat thou art united in bands of holy matrimony with Lord Henry) we shall commence our journey." Had all the ghosts in Christendom appeared before Gertrude at this mo-
205
ment, they would have passed unno¬ ticed, so much does the sense of a greitei and a leal evil destroy the power of a »mallei one The expiession, of her countenance was so woe begone, and hei whole frame so violently agi¬ tated, that the father rose, and placing a chair, he bade her be seated Gertrude s trembling knees refused to bear her slender weight, and sbe would have sunk to the giound ere she reached the of¬ fered seat, had not the fathei extended his aim to save her yet she did not faint, but shrinking fiom his touch as though it were death to come in con¬ tact with him, she summoned courage to say, " she was better, and begged he would îelease her and depart " Daughter, resumed the monk sternly, " there are those, aye, and those of rank, too, who would not refuse the protection of my all powerful aim your betters, lady, rest upon it as upon a powerful start- which can eithei make
206
or mar them You are not aware of my kuowledge, and therefoie know not my power, yet dread it, and avert it, lest you feel it Rise, Geitiude," he continued, endeavouring to place her in the chair, " rise, and listen to me. Lord Henry loves you, you, a poor, friendless, unknown girl biought up on the bounty of his noble parent«; and they, scorning the vulgar prejudices which are usually allied to high nobi¬ lity, as to what lelates to noble blood, consent that you should wed him And you, ungrateful as you are, spurn his prollered love, and reject with scoi n the honour they would confei upon you ' Learn to be more rational, foi of this bc sure, that you will remain a prisoner, until you frame your mmd to yield com¬ pliance to their wishes " Gertrude was sooverwhelmedbyallshe heard, that she allowed the father to reach the door ere she could attempt to speak to him, then darting forwards, she sprang

towards hım, and seizing lus black cloak, she implored hnn " to have pity on her ' " Alas, father, she cried, " alas, I have uo fuend to save me from the wiath of lord Henry, but vou Oh, lis¬ ten to me, turn not thus away obtain delay at least,—not to monow! oh, for mercy s sake not to-morrow, father, ' and falling at his feet, with upraised hands, she continued to supplicate his pity, till the agony her countenance ex¬ pressed, kindled some spaik of feehug in the heart of Father Rupert his brow gradually unbent his close pressed lips relaxed tbeir tension, and m gentler accents he bade her rise " It shall not be to moirovv, then, but for this indulgence I expect thou wilt resolve to obey my next commands îenedıtıte, daughter, ' added the monk as he raised the arras When he was gone, Gertrudes grief found vent in a flood of tears and she wept long Her whole soul she now bent to the
208
finding means to avoid the hated alli¬ ance with lord Heniy She trimmed the lamp tlie monk had left, for its flick¬ ering flame kindled fiesh fears, and brought a train of thought to her ima¬ gination which increased hei sadness The late lord and lady Ravenspui were then no more they bad at least found rest, and their banished frames reposed m a far distant land, but tht u- spirits sought the mausious of then early youth, and had appealed to her, as if to con¬ vince hei that all hope of relief fiom them was vain , foi, involuntaiily, she had hitheito looked forward to their re¬ turn, with an anticipation of good but now all was a blank, there appealed to be no one left in the wide world really to love hei, except old Margery and Clod, and how could they assist her? yet she would have given a gieat deal to see the latter What Clod was deficient in powei, he could perhaps accomplish by bis wits, if he did but
209
know where she was " Oh, that I could tiust Jeannette' but I tremble lest she should beti ay me " \¿aui hei lamp buint dimly She cast bei eyes slowly lound the laige and gloomy apaitmeut, the daik green dra- peiy ot the bed was closely drawn, and she feared to appioach it, for her mind, weakened by hei late teriois, be«gan to yield to the powers of superstition to a painful degiee Her weary limbs and her harassed spints needed repose, and she at length summoned coinage to rise and cioss her gloomy apartment At this moment the moon, emeiging from a daik cloud, stieamed bnghtly in at the lofty window Gertiude paused to gaze upon its ghtteiing beams, and sighed as the recollection of the free and 10- ìnantic rambles of hei childhood lose befoie hei The teais softly streamed fiom hei eyelids, and she was hastening to thiow herself on the bed, when a slight Jingling of little bells was heard

was expetled on the following day In bnet speech slit told her tale ot woe, to which Clod listened most attentivtly, and when she had concluded, he replied to her thus :— 1 Lady, dear, subdue your gnef, Ţo morrow eve shall bnng relief, Fear not, lady, help Is nlgb, Dry up your tears, anc cl eck tliat sigh, Tliough none were here to help beside, You si ould not bc Lord Henry β bnde Гог in your cause the babe would fight.

212
Abbess would give me an asylum fare well, good Clod ' Clod bowed respectfully, and setting off at full speed, he soon disappeaied fiom the view of Gertrude, who watched his progress with anxiety Some htlle time after he had ili-appeal ed she con tmued at the window, and then with cautious steps descended, so intently were her thoughts occupied, that she did not obseive that one of the chairs she had placed at the foot of the bed was removed to the opposite end of the room, till tho word " daughtei ' ' broke upon her ear , and the firm giasp of the fuar stayed her, as she directed her steps to¬ wards the bed, upon which she was going to thiow her weary limbs A shuek of affright burst from hei lips, and the deep momentary red and burning flush which had been produced by his seizure, was quickly supplanted by an ashy paleness, and the coldness of death A silence of a few moments

Clod made the best of his way to Ravenspur, and foitunately escaped the vigilance of the monk s emissaries, who weie sent to buiy him back to the castle of Fitzhugh. AVithout appioaclung his home he wentstiaight to Ihe convent,and demanded an audience of ťalhei «Viidrew He was instantly admitted, and m tew

words declared the purport of his er¬ rand " I had supposed no less," re¬ plied the monk, " for as to the idea that Geitrude was carried off by a su¬ pernatural agency, the tale was only fit for silly nuns and idle gossips I have ď '' da messenger to him who has n, с to interfere in this affair, and ». ~,i await his reply before we com¬ mence proceedings " " Another day will be too late," said Clod, " and I promised the lady help by this night Preparations are fast making foi their departure the lord Heury is arrived, and another day will see the lady Geitrude bride to him " The father mused , at length he said, " Thou shalt leturn, good Clod and tell the lady Geitrude to resist their machi nations to the utmost tell her we will soon be with her, and be prudent, Clod They, you know, who have to do with foxes, must proceed with caution VOL и L

"Ti-ue,"said Clod; "and as I strongly suspect I was discovered, for I saw two men endeavouring to overtake me, I must doff my fool's coat, and play the friar, good father, with your permission, and be'the bearer of a message to the lord of Ravenspur from you. Heaven knows how I shall succeed, father, I could, if I thought you would not mock me, disclose what I have seen in Fitz¬ hugh Castle. I told you bow I enacted the Earl's ghost, and how terrified both priest and laymen were. Would you believe it, father, that I need not have taken so much trouble to have played this boyish trick, for the castle abounds in spirits; nay, father, 1 myself bave twice seen my late lady's spirit." " Psbaw, nonsense, Clod," replied the friar; "I am surprised a man of your sense should be so credulous." But the fool was not to be talked out of the evidence of his own senses ; and
219
having procured a monk's dress, he again set forward, mounted ou a mule, for Fitzhugh Castle Previous to Clod's return Angelina had arrived, and was told that the guest she expected to see was no less a person than Gertrude herself " Every thing is piepared for the solemnization of her nuptials with Lord Henry, impatiently he waits till to-monow's morn, when all our hopes and fears upon that sub¬ ject will be quieted for ever Some of our attendants are gone on to Calais there a vessel awaits to convey us to Flanders, from whence we shall direct our steps to Italy, there to enjoy, fiee and unmolested, all those pleasures which thy fair clime, wealth, and rank, can procure for us How now, my An gelina thy looks are sad ' Why defer the solemnization of the nuptials till the morrow?

And m a very shoi t time this branch of the house of Ravenspur quitted ΓιΙζ- hugh Castle Their cavalcade consisted of three covered hoise Utters, and about a dozen attendants on horseback The monk did not accompany them They travelled at a brisk pace, stoppin,«; merely to take that refreshment and rest which nature compelled them to Then journey was neaily completed, indeed they were withm one post of Dovei, when they saw in the distance a troop of armed men making towardb them at α bnsk trot Harry Ravenspur and bis son recognised the crest of their family on the domestics' coats, and the former began to recai the words of the tradition and to suppose its completion was now about to be fulfilled , for his son imme diately rushed on to meet a young and gallant knight, who, mounted a milk white steed, rode boldly up, and bade the guides ofthe litters halt ' Who is it,' said Lord Henry, " that
224
dares to bid the retainers of the Earl of Ravenspur to halt ?" " 1," replied the youth, " Richard Ra¬ venspur, sou of the lawful Earl ; stand back, and let me pass, or by St. James I will compel thee." " Thou compel me," replied the fiery youth, " thou ! Begone." " Thou art of tbe same noble blood as I," returned Richard Ravenspur; "lam loth to die my spear in its red current : yet cross not my path, for I am cliole- lic, and perchance may do thee harm.— Stand, I say," he continued, riding up to one of the horse-litters ; when An¬ gelina undrawing the curtains, Richard stepped back; but ere he reached the other two litters, he was obliged to de¬ fend himself, for Lord Henry rushed upon him, with so much fury, that it re¬ quired all his well earned skill to keep his seat. Yet he acted solely upon the defensive ; while Henry, wilh the utmost impetuosity, strove to wound his
22Ь
noble cousin the latter at length, find¬ ing there would be no end to this com¬ bat, put forth his strength, and dexte¬ rously unhoised bis opponent He then rode off, leaving Henry to the care ot Ins attendants, while he hastened to join his »athei, who had reached some dis¬ tance, and was conducting away oie ofthe litters " Well hast thou done, my gallant son," said the banished Ravenspui (now returned to his native land in tii¬ umph), addiessing Richard, " thou hast acted nobly let them go in peace, that littei contains the treasute we have sought, but we will not undraw the curtains till we reach good father An¬ drews Gertrude will be in no haste to open them, for I heard Jacquelina tell her lady she had given hera sleeping potion, and that therefore she need not teai that Gertrude would awake She would be terrified to be awaked by strangers armed like us So now let s l 5
226
travel more at leisure, we have left them far behind Thou didst not wound yon fiery youth ?" " No," was the reply of Richard, " not that I know of, my speai almost faltei cd m my grasp I thought it stiange, most strange, that Ravenspui should hght against Ravenspui ' " The tradition is now fulfilled,' said the lawful Earl of Ravenspur, " thou hast heard so oft, and every paitiele is now accomplished So, how weai s the time ? Seest thou yonder monk ' and by my troth 'tis Fathei Andrew, and behind him, jingling his bells, comes our faithful Clod " The monk quickened his pace as he saw the noble Earl, and then approach¬ ing the litter, he bade them stand a little back gently he shook the cui- laius and called on Geitrude, but no one answeied "She sleeps," said Ravenspur, " peace, good father ''
227
" Sleeps'" repeated the monk, cross ing himself, " that I shall asseitam eie we proceed further " As he said this, he undiew the curtains, and looked withm the litter, but no Geitiude was then The pai ty stood aghast, while Richard, tuinmg round his boises bead, was retracing his steps with all speed, when Fathei Andiew tailed to lnm to stop. " Let us, ' he added, " take good coun¬ sel ere we proceed Alas ! this ¡s a me¬ lancholy conclusion of oui journey Poor Gertiude' Ofthis you may be suie, iny lord, Geitrude has not left England Father Rupert is the ara¬ tri ver of this iniquitous scheme, he feai - ed Clod's intelligence would induce you to pursue them, and he has secieted the lady Geraldine somewheie m this countiy ' " Old Rupert," said Clod, " is a great villain Cry you mercy, fathei, lor calling one of your fraternity by so I 6

harsh a name; but I know he is a cruel, barbarous villain. Ob, that I knew where he had concealed the lady Gertrude : 1 would break through the stone walls of Fitzhugh Castle itself, and attack all the ghosts which haunt it, in order to get a glimpse of her. Oh, my lord, what shall we do? The poor Countess ! how will she bear the dread¬ ful news?" " While we ponder thus, time is lost," said young Richard. " I'll to Dover and follow the fugitives; while you, my lord and father, must hasten to my mo¬ ther, and console her under this fresh affliction." With a melancholy heart the Earl of Ravenspur bent his steps to his castle in the north, while Father Andrew and Clod went to Fitzhugh Castle, where they inquired for Father Rupert. *' He is in the chapel," said Jean¬ nette, whose countenance was the pic¬ ture of grief,- he has never left the cha-
229
pel, except to sleep, since my lord de¬ parted , he is performing penance all the day; at night he throws himself on a tiuss of straw, which lies just outside the door of his former sleeping apait- ment " " Indeed « ' said Clod, " I suppose he is afraid of some of the ghosts which walk about this old place ' " Peace, fool," interrupted the friar " Jeannette, do thou inform the father I would speak with him " " The Holy Virgin defend me '· re¬ plied Jeannette, " I could just as soon go into a lion's den, as intrude upon the monk Ho would enjoin me a pe¬ nance so severe it would kill me, if I ventured near the chapel when he is occupied by his devotions " " Well, well," said Clod, " I U go to him But, Jeannette, have you seen any thing of the lady Gertrude lately » ' " No, ' resumed Jeannette, bursting into tears, " I have never seen her
230
since that day she saw the ghost of the late lord and lady Ravenspui, and now I nevei shall again, foi she is gone with my loid, and—" Clod had not stayed to hear the re¬ maindei of the poor gui s lamentations, but hastened on, looking howevei vei y cautiously around hnn lor although he was now convinced that he had not seen the lady RiivenspL s ghost, yet he had an idea that Father Rupert dealt with the devil, and that he could coiqure up spirits, even fiom the deep. He knock ed at the chapel dooi twice, when the monk said, " who is i{ that intrudes upon my puvacy· 1 who is it that by then unmanneily behaviour interrupts the performance of our vow ? ' " 'Tıs I, father," said Clod, opening the chapel door " Stand back," exclaimed the father, " let not folly dare to enter these sacied walls " " Now, in good truth," replied Clod,
231
" folly had better enter within them tlian villainy but, good father, we come for the lady Gertrude, aud expect you will give us a caudid answer upon this subject." " Avaunt !" said father Rupert, his eyes kindling with rage, " avaunt, fiend, nor dare to enter hei e What' thiukest thou I, who pass my tune in prayci and penance, can find idle time to think of liei you mention, a silly, wilful girl? Begone my time's too precious to be wasted upon thee " " Well," reşpmed Clod, " here is the reverend Abbot of Ravenspui, who is come upon the same errand as niyself you will answer him " The monk leplied not, but quitting the chapel, he hastened to the great parlour, and there awaited the anival of Father Andrew " " My son," said the lattei, entering the apartment, "we aie come with sor ìowfiil hearts in search of the lady Ger- -İjmL.^l^.ı^rf 11, ----------„1.1 „f I --------1.....

of concealment 5 her departure fiom llie castle > ' " Reverend father, ' returned Father Rupert, " I have other things to attend to than to think of her, my days are spent in prayer, my nights in penance She left the castle with my lady Coun tess, and I fear some foul knave has lured her from their care ' Clod, who was standmg behind the monk s chair, obseived that the lights burnt dimly " But,' íesumed the fnar, lowenng his voice, " thus much 1 can tell you, whether she lives or dies, foi by an art I learned m Italy, I can call the «pints of tlie dead before me ' Father Audrew looked amazed, and Clod's han bustled as he listened " Wouldst thou have this fact ascer tained > Speak and if hei spirit has left its fi ail tenement of clay, thou shalt see her rise before thee " " No, no," exclaimed Clod Fathei Andrew was silent At length he said — "¿Ч—™-~~-™> Ь»™ "" «»'sh tn

lead you to commit so great a crime if she is dead, which heaven forefend, peace to her manes, it she lives, and tliou knowest aught of her present dwelling-place, by all thy hopes of pai¬ don, tell us where we can find her ' Father Rupert frowned, and fixing bis eyes upon bis religious companion, he said, " for my own satisfaction I shall try the spell, ifthouart afraid ofthe shadow of a shade, thou mayst retire " With that the fnar rose, and approach¬ ing the further end of the room, he caused both the lamps instantly to dis¬ appear, while the extremity ofthe apait- ment became illumined with a pale blue light, and the form of Geitrude ap¬ pealed to rise from the floor, and after lemaimng half a second motionless, she again sunk, and the room was in an instant enveloped in daikness "She has become one of the unearthly seraphs/ said father Rupert, in a hollow voice, and as he leached the table the lights gra-
234
dually revived, and disclosed to the spectatois their own pale counte¬ nances " Are you convinced ? ' added the father, " or would you search for the dead among the living í I will remain h- e if you think she is concealed in any part of the castle. Theie are the keys Jeannette will conduct you ' Clod, temfied as he was, took the keys and left the apartment. A silence of some minutes followed his departure, during which Father Rupeit remameli witb crossed hands and upraised eyes, while the Abbot stedfastly gazed upon bis companion The former at length broke the silence by a heavy sigh, to which the latter replied thus " My son, does that sigh proceed from contrition ?" " Contrition!" repeated the monk, with the expression of astonishment, " contrition I for what reason ? No, reverend father, it proceeded from soi sow and grief of heart, that you should
235
suspect me of concealing a gewgaw of a girl—and for what purpose ? what in¬ terest can I have in her concealment?" " The interest of your patron may in¬ duce you to do that which to yourself is of no farther importance than to se¬ cure to you their favour," said the Ab¬ bot. " 1 am well convinced, brother, that humility should be one ofthe character¬ istics of the votaries of St. Francis ; but I know, and you know, that the human heart is accessible to pride and ambition, in all conditions of life. Monks have become abbots, generals of their or¬ der, cardinals, and even popes." "Submission under undeserved re¬ proof," resumed the father, " is one of the virtues I can at least convince you I possess and practise. Say on, good father ; I deserve this humiliation, not for the crime you accuse me of, but for those sins which daily I commit, for which 1 pass my nights in prayer and my days in solitude. Proceed, good
236 father, proceed Spare me not, yet when you think of Father Rupeit, thmk at least he bowed submissively to the hand and heart which heaped scoi n and reproach upon lum, without a pi oof that he deserved them What can I do to convince you of my innocence? I have permitted that Tom fool to search the castle , I have humbled our holy order to the dust, by condescending to argue with a fool, a kuave, and idiot, I bave disgraced myself by holding con¬ verse with this jingling Clod , and this, to justify myself not m bis opinion, but ra your's, good father Surely you, who know the holy life our fathers lead, will own this condescension is unparal- lelled " " My son," replied the Abbot, " you are warm in your defence, and through your feigned humility I espy a dis position which ill accords wilh your professions But I have no right to dictate to a votary of the order of St
237
Francis, I have no jurisdiction ovei you —else—" " In tiuth," replied the monk, using, "you should have lemcinbered that befoie, the same idea glanced m my mmd, but ıe^pect for join lank chained my lips Yet when the supenoi of my convent knows this, as sure he will, he will tepi inland mc for my foil), which wojUI thus saciifice the dignity of St Francis Will it please you to assist jour favourite Clod in his leseaiches ? " No," replied the Abbot, " it does not please me to quit this chamber.

same time, that I have not the power to compel you to declare hei fate,—for that you are privy to her concealment, I would not scruple to declare before a whole chapter of your ordei Do you think the votaries of St Dominic would shrink from a contest with those of St. Francis ? No, no , and since you refuse to speak the truth, and do but aggravate your cnme by an obstiuate and pertinacious adherence to error, I shall hold no fur¬ ther converse with you " " As you please," was the reply, and both remained deeply engaged in pon¬ dei mg on the result of Clod's researches. Father Rupert paced the room impa¬ tiently, stopping ever and anon, as if lis¬ tening , while the Abbot with clasped hands leaned forwards, as if to catch the most distant sound Thus they ìe- mained, till Clod s voice was heard in the corridor, when the eyes of each were directed to the door of entrance.

Clod was ìesolved no coiner should go unsearched , and having called Jean¬ nette, who was born ra the castle, and knew every nook and corner in it, they commenced then operations But Jean¬ nette had been so terrified of late by ghosts, that at every step she paused tieinbled, and looked around, as if she expected some fiightful object to start up before her " Come, ' said Clod " don t be alarmed, Jeannette , the holy Virgin will defend you from all attacks of evil spirits, and good ones will not

harm us Let us first search above stairs " " Hold thy peace, Clod, I intreat," said Jeannette, " you will never be quiet till some fughtful sight terulies you to death " " Why, to say the truth," replied her companion, " 1 do not veiy much relish bemg in this castle, it is as full of hob¬ goblins as )ou are full of trrcks, you kitten " At this moment Jeannette caught hold of his aun, saying, " Hush, lurk,— heaid je no noise, Clod ? " " Lh '" quoth the fool, listening, " noise f No, none, except, indeed, the hooting of the owl, and the croaking of the laven , )et, truly, theie is an odd kind of moaning " ' The holy Virgin defend us,' said Jeannette, " as sure as my name s Jean nette we shall see some homble sight Theie am, Clod , 'tis like the rustling of silk, and I dare say it «s the ghost ol

The fool strained his eyes lo the utmost to pene¬ trate the distant obscurity, aud animateti by the hopes of discovenng the lady Gertrude, he lost all his fears, and shaking off Jeannette passed so rapidly along the gallery, that his lamp was nearly extinguished by the cui rent of atr which his own motion produced, he instantly placed his hand before it to save it and thus prevented its rays from vol u m

" You sliall go with us, Jeannette " replied Clod , " old Fathei Rupert sliall not prevent you ' " Shall 1, indeed," said Jeannette , " come then, let us see what is in here " The gloominess of tlie apartment struck a chill upon then hearts, and as they cautiously entered, Clod hung the arras over a chau, and propped Ihe door open with another Everv part of this apaitment was thoioughly seaiched ; they undiew the dark gieen cm tains of the bed, raised the arras in eveiy pait of the chambei, to see if theie weie any other dooi than that by which the) had enteied, hut could discover none , tust as they weie leaving the apartment, they heard as they imagined a faint scieam, but all was again still yet for some minutes Clod remained motionless, his eyes fixed on ťiat ¿a t of the room liom whence it appeared to issue, while u 2

Jeannette clung to hım, unable to arti¬ culate " It was fancy, ' said Clod, as he slowly tinned, but he halted at the door, and again listened with the most intonse anxiety, where he lingered foi some time, and again the rustling of silk was heard Jeannette s terror now in¬ creased evei y instant, and she appeared to be sinking to the ground, when Clod hastily putting down the tripod lamp he earned, in order lo support her,, it was suddenly extinguished, and the door be¬ hind them shut lo, violently forcing the two chairs into the passage The con¬ fusion of Clod was now indesciibable, he called loudly on Jeannette, but no Jean¬ nette replied, and he was fcaiful of mov¬ ing lest he should fall over the chairs which had tumbled into the passage The noise he made, howevei, brought the «two monks to his assistance, and Jeannette was cai ι led into the kitchen ta ıı state of insensibility Father Ru-

When lie left Ravcuspui Castle, it was lus mtention to wander for a timo ııı the midst of scenes which were so dear, so familiar to lain, till the hour of ma¬ tins he then proposed having an in¬ terview with the Abbot, and consuldrg with him as to the best means of reco¬ vering his daughter The villainy ot Nicolai, the ready instrument of his lord's will, prevented his carrying this resolution into effect When he was hurled from the top of the cliff he sunk to the bottom, as we have seen, but his enemies were too much afraid of being discovered, to watch long to see whether he would use again When he did so, his strength was so nearly exhausted, that had he not been seen by a fisher¬ man's boy he must have pensbed, but the lad was strong, and dragged him to the land he then chafed his hands and feet, and so soon as returning life evinced it»elf, he was hastening away, N 2

dissipate her anxiety, said, without wait¬ ing for her« question, " Thy child is well, my Geraldine ; I have seen it." " The heavens be praised," replied the exiled Countess ; " but wheie is it, my lord ?" " In England," was the reply. " In England !" exclaimed the lady Geraldine, bursting into tears; "Alasi my lord, why did you leave her there ?" Ravenspur then briefly described his journey, and ite results. "Thus you see, my dear Geraldine, some other plan must be adopted. You are acquainted with the lady Abbess of the nunnery of Ravenspur ; send а trusty messenger to her; and beg that'she will watch over dat lovely offspring. I fear it would be in vain to attempt bringing her here, for to no living being save myself Would I entrust so arduous, so perilous, so important an undertaking. But you, my Gerttldine, make a coward of me.
271
What would become of you, should tbe assassin's blow reach tho heart of your own true Ravenspur ?" The lady Geraldine shuddered ; and, painful as was the alternative, she yielded for a time to the reasoning of her lord. " And now, my lord, what tidings bring you from my sire ?" " He is sick, my love, and ill at ease," replied Ravenspur. " I did not visit him, for I found that his state of health was so precarious that the sight of me might basten his end. Alas ! my Geraldine, weep not thus, our portion in life is steeped in sorrow ; but submission to the decrees of heaven will teach us to bear what seems so hard. I did intend to visit him before I left my native land, but was prevented." The fact was indeed this ; Ravenspiţr had learned the death of Fitzhugh, but was unwilling to iliajress his lady by the certain intelligence of her father's de¬ cease until her mind had recovered N 4
272 somewhat of its natural tone. The loss ofiher child preyed upon her health and spirits, and the first smile which illu¬ mined her countenance after her ar¬ rival in France, was when the faithful Jacques returned from England, bearing a message from the Abbess of Raven¬ spur, promising to watch over the in¬ terests, health, and happiness of little Çlytrude. " Gertrude is her name, then?" said the lady with a sigh. "Alas, my child,-thou wilt never hear thy mother's name pronounced but with opprobrium and shame." ι "Think not thus," interrupted Ra¬ venspur, "the lady Abbess, Robert, Margery, Clod, will all remember you, and speak of the exiled lady Raven¬ spur in terms of love and praise. Oh, iny Geraldine, add not thus so bitterly to щу regret by Щ gentle murmurings. Alas, the mind which thus feeds on its own griels, neglectful of the bles-
273
sings that lemuin, sins against heaven s all-wise decrees, and misfoi tunes, which erst were gentle chastisements, become deseivedly llie seveie punishment of our discontents. Γοι thine own sake, foi mine, yield not thus to unavailing soi - low how wilt thou be able to beai the furthci tuals which heaven may heap upon oui heads ? The daughter of the biave Fitzhugh should beai a noblei soul, and shew a couiage which con¬ firms hei bn th " " Say no more,' inteirupted Geial dine, " say no more I blush at my own weakness , but thou shalt have no futuie cause to chide thy love Believe me, dearest Ravenspui, 1 am not insensible to the blessings I possess, and beyond them all I prize thy love " As the lady Geialdine said this, hti head tank upon her loid s shouldei Teais of tendei ness bedewed his manly cheek, and mingled with those of the subdued Geialdine From this time the lady n ä
274
Ravenspur struggled nobly with liei soi - lows, aud found m the effort the rewaid of her exertions, every day brought somo alleviation to hei griefs, and her delighted lord exeitcd every power which he possessed to give her pleasure, and vary the dull monotony of her life At the end of one twelvemonth she received a fresh stimulus to hei exer¬ tions, for she had the happiness of pre¬ senting to her beloved Ravenspui a lovely boy Yet this happiness was not unalloyed. Every strange person who approached the house she fancied an emissaiy of Angelina, no intreaties could pievail upon her to allow the in¬ fant to sleep any where except in hel own apartment, and it requned hei ut¬ most elloi ts, and the most decided con¬ duct of her husband, to prevent hei fall¬ ing into л state of anxiety, as destructive »is that pioduced by her foi mei depres¬ sion of spints In order, therefore, to change the scene and diveit hei mind,
275
Ravenspur proposed journeying into Spain, and seeking an asylum m that part which was still in the possession of theMoois This pioposal wasreceived by Geraldine with delight " There," she exclaimed, " I shall be under no apprehension there Angelina's villainous spies will never discovei us. Let us begone, dear Richard , Ihe Chris¬ tian may learn to practise the lights of hospitality fiom the unfoi tunate misled votaries of Islamism ' Pieparations for their depaituie were made accordingly, and Ravenspui and his family providing themselves with dresses fitted for the occasion, set out from the fair plains of Champagne as pilgums on their way to our lady of Montserrat.

thiough the thick foliage Yet they lacked not amusement, for the entertain ing conveisation of Le Blanc, and the amusement afforded by Richard Raven¬ spur, beguiled the time till they reached the summit But how shall vve describe the scene which burst upon them, when they gained the brow of the hill ■ To wards the south, the Pyrenees raised then lofty heads, their glittering tops covered with snow , at their feet lay the plain they had left, rich with the fruits of au¬ tumn Yet when they fiist looked round them, a thin veil of mists gave but a par tial view, till the sun s lays, gradually absoibing the fleecy moisture, the îural prospect glowed in all its beauty Round the diffeient cots they could distinguish gioups of lively playful children, by whose side frolicked the grandsire and his aged spouse In every direction the peasants were hastening to their labour, and all nature seemed just arisen fresh fiom the hands of the Creator Behind

Hieni lay tlie Gaioune, covcied with little fishing boats, that had just left the shoie, while on their rights upon the lull itself, rose the grey toweis of the convent For some moments they stood entranced, and to compleie their cnthu siasm the voices of the nuns stole upon then ears, chanting a m itm hymn Me¬ chanically they paused, and with pro¬ found attention listened till the song of piaise was ended The convent was a low building, consisting of two stories , only the windows weie small, and of the gothic form, as was the cuti ance , but the chapel fiom whence the sounds issued was illumined by one window only, and that at the east end, foi it was excavated out of tbe lock itself, as were many ot the nuns' cells ' See you yon little cabin ?" said Le Blanc, pointing to a little cottage that was neaily hidden fiom then view by the luxuriant foliage which surrounded it, " that is the peaceful abode I

" Here, indeed, said Ravenspur, " we shall es¬ cape the prying eye of malice, hei e our Richard may find health and strength, and if we pass oui days in peace, our society shall soon be enlarged, and our happiness be increased by the presence of another beloved object Geialdine sighed, and Ravenspui hav¬ ing put down his boy upon the glass, the latter soon called for all the atten¬ tion of its mothei But, impatient to lew tlie whole of her domicile, she caught lnm up in her arms, and over¬ taking Ravenspur and Le Blanc, she enteied the cottage at the same time as they did A common sitting room a kitchen, a daily, and a celiai, foimed the lower story above these were the sleeping apartments At the back of the house was an extensive lawn, skirted by a thick shiubbery, thiough winch, on the north vol n о

My little Louison will miss hei com painon Richaid, she added, " and 1 ti usf you will sometimes allow lum to spend a day with us ' Louison can come here/ replied Ra¬ venspui " we shall be always happy to see liei as well as yourself, Louise, but it would not be discreet for us, who arc only halting on oui pilgnmage, to bi gadding about theiefore you and Le Blanc must be our guests as often as you can , in the meanwhile, do not folget lhe two cows vou promised to send us о 2

" I shall not folget them," she ıeplıed, smiling, " neither shall I forget your invitation Adwu, adieu, Monsieur, adieu, Madame, adieu, petit marmot," she con¬ tinued, kissing Richard, who struggled manfully to get from her that he might go to Louison It was evening when Ravenspur and his lady were left alone, and it was a beautiful evening too, and arm in arm they wandeied down to the banks of the Garonne, when they had seen their little boy put to bed Having kissed bis rosy cheek, Geraldine said a prav er for his safety, and lightly pressing the turf, joined hei husband at the end of the lawn For some time they pursued their walk ш silence, lost in that plea sing meditation which the calm of even¬ ing, and pai ticulaily by the water's side, so generally excites upon pure and vir¬ tuous minds. Geraldine -was the first to break the delightful spell, but in
293
such gentle accents, that the neigh bom ing nightingales ceased uot their song ' At such an hour as tins, ' she said, " 1 always thmk of my deai father I dieamt last night I saw him borne to the silent tomb, and then rny little Ger¬ tiude rose before me like an angel, and hovering ovei Fitzhugh Castle, seated heiself upon one ot the highest towers What may this dieam mean ? ' " Di earns are idle stuff," replied Ra¬ venspur , " daily 1 expect to hear from England, where I trust that all is well But see, my Geraldine, the fishing boats are retaining Hark! how the voices of the fisheimen swell gradually on the ear, keeping sweet melody with the music of the oars It is the vesper hymn they chaunt " The song now increased, and Raven¬ spur and his lady concealing themselves behind the trees, as they passed close in o3

the southern shoie of the nver, listened with delight as the voices giadually de¬ creased, and nt length totally ceased. They then ìesuined then walk, and wandering they knew not vvhithoi, yet keeping certain trees ш then mind's eye as a guide for their return, they at length enteied upon open space, this they tra¬ versed without seeing any peison to interi upt them The banks of the nver at length rose, forming a low kind of cliffy bank, this they followed till they were startled at the sound of voices close to thein Geraldine hesitated whether they ehould proceed, but Ravenspur turned short round the piojecting bank, and his lady could not iernam behind The scene which piesented itself was interesting a little iow-tbatched cot¬ tage, the door of which was open, and by a bright blazing «¡he sat an old giey- headed man and woman mending fishing nets, while a young woman was bioil-

The former en tered into conversation with the fishei man .is to his sports, and asked to be permitted to join them Flatteied by this compliment, they expressed them selves warmly in thanks for this maik ot confidence, and having leaint that Monsieur Perdu inhabited the white cottage, they intieated that as often as he and Madame would like the sport, о 4
296
they would, strø ceremonie, repair to then hut, and that the boats should be at their disposal The old man was very intelligent, and although turned of sixty, lie with all the agility of sixteen, kept pace with Ravenspur, as he and his-soa accompa¬ nied the stränget s through the wood on their return home. Charmed with this ramble, though somewhat fatigued, Ravenspur and his lady sat down to the frugal îepast which had been prepared for them by their devoted attendants, who had exerted themselves m ordei to arrange the fur¬ niture of the humble dwelling to the best advantage They enjoyed the sweet reward of their labours m the smiles of then noble lord and lady Blessed with mmds of the most exalted cast, and heaits glowing with the most unbound¬ ed charity, the lllustiious exiles were the idols of all who had the happiness

of being acquainted with their virtues, and although they had assumed the humble garb of peasants, and suited then beanng to their homely guise, yet oould tliey not conceal their supenonty even from passing strangers When they were alone, their attendants gladly relinquished that degree of familiarity which then mutual safety demanded, and with pnde of heart Jacques there- lore took his wonted station behind bis lord when the latter seated himself at the upper table Gei-ililme praised the arrangements which had been made, and thè expedi¬ tion with which they had been per¬ formed The two maul servants were busy above stairs, and when Ravenspur and his lady entered their sleeping apartment they were sui prised to see the decorations and cotnfotts which had been so speedily prepaied for them In good truth, said Geraldine, ad о 5

dressing the nurse, who wae rocking the little, Richard in his osier cradle, " in good truth, Margaret, you have played the witch here. See, my lord, our bed is canopied like that at Raven¬ spur, and the spiced cup so cheering, and all the gewgaws of my toilet set out iu state ; you forget, we are peasants uow, Margaret." " The more's the pity," replied Mar«· garet ; " times must be bad indeed when might makes right. Ah, dear, my lady, and you to be so cheerful, and so happy, and so contented with your humble lot; and my lord, too, clad in russet robes, when he should be cased iu steel, and presiding in the great hall at Ra¬ venspur ! Ah, woe is me ! but the throne which can only be supported by the banishment of the best and bravest, must to my mind be in a very tottering condition." " Nay, Margare!, but you speak
299
treason," said Ravenspur, smiling ; "were Richard, or those he calls his friends, to hear you, they would deem you worse than mad " " And by my troth they may call mo mad, aye, and fool too, but I could give them a keener name ' " And what is that ?" asked Geraldine " Nay, lady, ' said Margaret, " were 1 to tell you that, the tei m fool might be well bestowed upon me, by my faith and 1 have not In ed so long with Cod (poor tool), without profiting by his wit many a time has he said to me, Maigaiet 1 will give thee twopenny- worth of ai ice Tell not all thou knowest, lakchecd what thou shewest, lie careful what Ihou sow est, And wl at see 1 thou stre est I est the tale tliou tellest, And the secret tliou belrayest, And the trcth thou fülest And the grains thou renpest, All prove that tl ou kennest, Nought hovi tins world goetl

I should tire you, my lady, to say more, and my lord's patience is like my me¬ mory, failing; the holy virgin guard thee, my lord, and all the saints have thee in their keeping." When Margaret left the room, Ra¬ venspur and Geraldine retired to rest. Not so their faithful servants ; drawing the settee from the wall they placed it opposite the wood-fire, which still blazed cheerfully, and in language at once affectionate and strong they descanted on the virtues and injuries of their exiled lord and lady. " I'faith," said Jacques, " I saw the storm long before it burst upon them, and so did some one else, I trow, poor soul," he added, after a pause ; " but she is at rest now, I hope ; for 1 fear she had little rest in this world, although her lot fell among the great ones of this world." " Do you mean the lady Victorine ?"
SOI
inquired Margaret, in an undei-tone ; " I always thought she took particular notice of my lord and lady." " Even she," replied Jacques ; " and it is my belief she would gladly have changed her ducal coronet for the ra¬ ven crest. She gave me particular orders to entice my lord to Italy, if he should be unfortunate, and so 1 did, but he said, ' no, Jacques, 1 shall never visit Italy again ;' and he sighed and looked so melancholy, and waved his hand thus, and then he left me." '■' And pray," said Margaret, sharply, " do you mean to hint that the lady Victoriile liked my lord better than her husband, and that my lord knew this, and that he sighed about her? Now, and if he did, I should wonder muci, with such a lady of his own too ! it's pity he did not mate with some of youi- dark countrywomen, and—" " Prithee peace," replied Jacques, " do not be so choleric, Margaret; there

" Harm 1 ' quoth Dorothy, diawing herself up, " it was a shame, so it was— die in his arms '"

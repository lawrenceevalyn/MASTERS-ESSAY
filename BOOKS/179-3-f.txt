" I do, said Rosalita, solemnly ' and welcome ıs it to my stricken spirit, as the mountain spring to the parched hps of the thirstv traveller buffer me to pass, hdy, tha' I prostrate my soul before it " Not yet—not yet impatiently re turned Zuhma " I brought thee hither, to act, not to pray If thou dost anchor faith on that image, look at it well- sv ear by it honestly ' Swear, repeated Rosalita · -ihs lady ' what must I swear > " Swear to my salvation, or swear to thy own perdition quick rejoined Zuh ma ' Didst thou not say, when last we met, thou hadst never beheld Hayradm Barbaross i' Now sweir it to me here girl and swear it on this emblem of thy worship And as she spoke, she dragged Rosalita to the foot of the altar ' Swear —swear—I adjure thee, swear and snatching up the f rucifix, she held it to her lips " I eannot—I dare not, said Rosalita, shuddering back
" How ' dare not ' ' and Zuhma turned her dark eyes upon her, and the fire of those dark eyes was almost scathing " Hast hou played me false?—hast thou laboured to deceive me? ' Oh, no lady ' tıs circumstances alone I could have sworn it then but not now Last night, lady— and every feature was convulsed— last night rent away the v eil I cannot—I dare not swear it now " Last night, ıepeated Zuhma, and hei eyes grew wilder, and her features sterner " didat thou see Hayradm Bar barossa last night? Did Hayradm Bar baroka pass those hours with thee, whicli ought to have been mine—only mine ' " Last night, said Rosahta, proudly, ' unseen, I beheld Hayradm Barbarossa and hailed m Hayradm Barbarossa, the secret, the relentless persecutor of my life " Then thou hast known him—then thou ha^t aeen him, and Zuhma ques tioned almost breathlessly " Seen him ' blessed Virgin ' yes, yes, B2

the truth, the fatal truth, what sorrow had been spared us ' We-----" " Had denounced him to the state," in¬ terrupted Zuhma, "and I had lost htm for ever " " Not so, lady," and Rosahta looked reproach , "you judge us wrongfully We had not nursed hıra into life to yield him to the c-caffold had we known him the conqueroi of Algieis, wc had quitted San Angcio, and fled beyond the reach of his powei ' " Would it have cosi thee no pang ' ' eageil) questioned Zuhma " Wou'd not the smile of his lip, the fiie of his eye, have pierced «nto thy retreat, and scatter ed mildew on thy promises' Answer •ne, Rosahti Delia Monti—and answer me, b) the heaven thou ciavest after, dost thou not love Ha) radm Bai barossa ' Yet stay —stay," checking her impulse to speak, " thou canst not love Hayradm Barbarossa as I love htm ; thou canst not sacufice for Hayradm Barbarossa what I have sacri¬ ficed.'
t" Fear me not," proudly exclaimed Ro¬ sahta- "had my heart been free to choose, it had never yielded to Hayradm Barba¬ rossa Heai me to the end, lady, and eveiy fear must cease" " A), to the end, urged Zultma, " from the season of peril, from the paroxysms of delirium, until row " " Abiding upon the coast of Sicily, in almost hermit seclusion," resumed Rosa hta, " we knew little passing among men, else the ravings of delirium had betrayed the shipwrecked stianger an agent m the fell tragedies passing m Algiei s , foi with the name of Eutemt, he coupled murder and usurpation " " Eutemi, faltered Zuhma, but her accent was so low and broken that Rosa¬ hta looked fearfully up Zuhma was changed indeed, palsied, seemingly death- stricken , her f) es closed , her cheeks and lips colourless " Why this emotion ?" asked Rosahta, pressing to hei side, and soothingly striving to support her but kind words
and gentle offices stilled not the storm withm all there was wild and unhallow¬ ed the sport of passion, unstayed, un¬ checked, by the only helm which can steer through the billows and breakeis of the world —the light of Chnstian grace had nevei arisen to mellow and to temporize ' Suddenly she snatched at the arm of Rosahta, hei look was mingled sorrow, remorse, and eainestness " Dreams and ι avings are as one, ' she exclaimed " I have heard tell they often lecoid facts. In the fierce ι agings of his fever, did Barba¬ rossa spcik of Eutemi, as though the life- blood of Eutemi had dyed his own hands? Answ et me, girl Life—more than life is at stake a bi othei's blood cues out at the judgment-seat " " A brother," repeated Rosahta, her own heart thrilling m the like hoiror " A brother—a dear, an only brother," wildly ïesumed Zuhma " Eutemi, king of Algiers, was my brother say not then, that Barbarossa —my husband, Hayradm вЗ
Barbarossa, was the murderer of Eutemi Oh, no, no ' ' and every feature was con¬ vulsed, " hell is not more false '" " I ady, I would but speak of self, ' said Rosoitta, timidly ** Alas ' I have di¬ verged into a lab) nnth which scares me Until I landed a ciptive in Algiers, I knew little of the history of Algiers ' " And what hast thou learnt,' quick m terrogated Zuhma, " sav e rum and mas¬ sacre' Tell me the tale to which thou hast listened ' Tel' me the tongue which has dared to bandy ought m disparage ment to my lord and husband ? Belike, and a more than wonted fire sparkled in her eyes, " the secret verőm has coupled my name in the foul—foul deed " No, on my life ' ' exclaimed Rosahta " I have heard tell, that Aruch Barbarossa, under the show and mask of service, de¬ posed and muidered the king Eutemi,— that when Aruch Barbarossa was slain on the banks of the Huexda, Hayradm Bar¬ barossa was chosen m his stead "

bursts of tears choked utterance When she did look up, the wild flashings of her dark eyes, and the rapid fluctuations of her features, betrayed opposing feelings " Tell me,' she abruptly asked, " what thou hast heird of Zuhma, the sister of Eutemi—the affianced bride of Muley- Hascen ? ' " Until we met in this garden, solemn¬ ly pronounced Rosalita, " I never heard the name " Zuhma writhed m the bitterness of wounded pride — " Too fallen—too ab¬ ject," she murmured Then struggling down the heart-pang—"She who bore evidence to the glory of Zaplnia, she ex¬ claimed, "judged it tie.' meet to tell thee, that T, Zuhma, the sister of the royal Eutemi, quitted Algiers, the betrothed of the king of Tunis—returned to Al giers, the bnde of Hayradm Barbarossa ' Well may est thou stai t , well mayest thou turn thme eyes from me Ay, mark, and marvel at the humiliation ' I quitted Algiers m bndal pomp, loved, honoured,
my dreams, my hopes, my anticipations, full of Muley Hascen, of him whose throne I was hastening to share I pic¬ tuied not the gathering of the tempest so young so buoyant, so confiding, how could I picture ought of ill ' ' She paused for a moment, then, tiemulous, almost ra¬ diant in emotion, pursued— ' Shut in the silken folds ot my litter, and listening to the song and the light piatile of my faithful Tatuna I heeded not time oi distance I felt not the burning sun, 01 the and blast, as it swept through the ranks of my re¬ tinue no—all for me seemed made up of love md promise—not bnghter weie the flowers which blossomed on my brow, than the hopes which sprang in my bo¬ som ' lhe lone vvllderness in which we nightly rested, served but to contrast the richness of m) piospects ,11 was joy and fullness noi till the mosques and mina¬ rets of Tunis, catching the askaunt rays of the sun, glittered in distance, did we learn ought of the revolution which had despoiled Muley Hascen of his kingdom
It was the eve itide ot the very d»y m which Hayradm Barbarossa, heading the (orces of the sultan Solyman, anchored with two hundred and fifty vessels in the bay of Tunis, the very day, when partly by address, partly by treacheiy, the fort of Goletta falling into his hands, gave him the key of the city But tıs the feel ings of the heart I would porti^y, not the strifes ind struggles of nations the one belongs to the lnstouan, the othei be the province of weak and timid woman Elate and buoyant, the loud acclamitions of the Turkish soldiers, and the sudden dis charge of artillery, which planted upon the rampai ts, Baroaiossa turned upon the too-late aroused inhabitants of '1 unis, we mistook for distinctions and honours offer ed to ourselves, not until we had passed through the gite, and ι eached almost to the citadel, did we know that Muley Hascen had fled, and that Tunis h id sub¬ mitted to the victor Oh, the agony of that astounding conviction ' It fell like the blast of the desert ' Fierce, but brief
was the resistance of my retinue: the «ild jhneks of my slaves mingled with the clash of aims, the dm, the conflict, the deafening shouts of the exulting Turks ' Was it marvel, that when my eyes open¬ ed fiom the death swoon, my heait throb bed with gratitude to him who snatched me from the peul' Was it marvel, that armed in all the dangerous lure of gene¬ rosity and powei, Hayradm Barbarossa from tint moment became my fate' Days and « eeks woi e away as a gay bright dream —Tunis was fairy-land— Barbarossa the potent rmgician who held spell upon my senses I never spoke of Muley-Hascen, because the name of Muley Hascen, pro¬ nounced by me, inflicted heart-pangs on him I loved Too sure 'twas fascination, too sure 'twas all a subtle mist to beguile and blind me, and it did beguile, and it did blind me, to my own despite' She paused, or ι ather, sad recollections, press¬ ing on each other, checked the powers of speech ner heait was full of " sweet and bitter feelings," and the tear of blighted
love, and outraged sensibility, hung trem¬ bling in her eyes " Lad), I can guess the -est," said Ro¬ sahta, willing to spare her " At Tunis, tranced in dreamy bliss, Algiers was for gotten ' " All in life was forgotten save Hayra¬ dm Baibarossa,' eagerly resumed Zuhma, " for all in life was concentrated m Hayra¬ dm Barbarossa's love Again she paused then, with a shuddering sigh, pursued— " The events pass ng in Algiers reached me not in Tunis, my bower of bhss, on the banks of the Guadtlcarbar, was close shut away from all of evil tidings there, amid blossoming sweets—just epitome ot this world s happiness—I hved, forgetfu' of Muley Hascen's claim—forgetful of all save Barbarossa s promises Oh ' twas an eternity then ' 'tis a dieam now ' Like figures upon the sand, a passing bieath has effaced them ' ' Again her voice failed her, and all of sound died away in an hys tene sob. " Why probe the wounds ofthe past?"
gently whispered Rosahta " Why rend away the cicatrice which time has wrought?" Zuhma looked up and smiled self love and woman's pnde spoke m that smile it seemed to say, till now no wound was there to cicitnze " And suie'—mused Rosahta, gazing on that sunny smile, on that matchle"» beauty, foi N ver v s for n о del cat Fasl l ш dre π or story to creute VV I г а I lov o ι а no jealous pang can live beyond the in¬ stant no eye can turn from thee, and seek another' " On the banks of the Guadilcarbai,' said Zalima, returning again to her cares and to her story, " amid all that ait and nature could collect and blend together to entrance and to captivate, Hayradm Bar¬ barossa, forgetting the conqueror in the obsequiousness of the lover, wooed my virgin favoui—wooed with no common feivour—for he swore to me, by all we held most sacred, that I should reign sin-
gly in his home, as I did m his heart- that he loved me as man never loved wo¬ man and I believed him—I wedded him —I garnered all my hopes ш his promises —I pictured his faith pure as my own, the offspring of the fondest, truest love that ever waimed a human bosom ' But I weary you, without doing justice to my own feelings I returned to Algiers with Barbaross t I saw through his eyes the changes which had transpired , and sooth ed by the endearments of passion, I be¬ came reconciled to ever) sport of destiny I was told that Eutemi fell in honouiable warfare that Zaplnia died of α broken heart that—that----- Sorrowing recol lections crowded in, and voice and forti tude failed—' That to stay the triple curse of cıvıl contention, again resumed Zuh ma, " in right of myself, Hayiadm Bar barossa assumed the government of Al giers, vacated by the death of his brother Aruch 'lime wore away—my infant Sehm was born—my destiny was all sun^ shine for I leigned the undisputed mis
tress of Barbarossa's heart I feared not the dazzling beauties of the harem the mazy dance, the siren song, all were culled for my p'easure all were dedicated to my service Sometimes here, but oftei er within the palace in Algiers, I awaited the return of Barbarossa from his occasional absences—anxious for Ins safety—gazing on the feathery surf—listening to the dis¬ tant waves—watching for the gilded gal ley to shoot into the mole Ah what could I thmk, when I was told ,t was Baibarossa s will that I came no more to this Elysium that the gate was barred aga nst me that it was given, as tbe re¬ ward of service, to the favoured Escander? Doubt arose, and jealousy, the grave of peace' The whispeis of my slaves awa kened a scoi pion brood within my heart I heard tell of a Sicilian slave, young and beautiful, captured by Escander, and kept in utter seclusion withm the palace For a season I combatted the floating rumours implicating Barbarossa witn this hidden stranger, and warring against my quiet,
till even my faithful Fatima shrunk away from me, to hide her sorrowing sympathy Stung almost to madness, I resolved to seek conviction , to prove the faith of Bar. barossa, or to expose and to upbraid him w ith his treachery Assisted by ti ied and trusted friends, my plans were speedily formed, and almost as speedily executed In the absence of Barbarossa, closely dis¬ guised, I stole away from Algieis, and hastened hither A duplicate key admit ted me through the pnvate pass into the dell and when I first encounteied thee, my pooi gul, so sad and shadowy —and as she spoke, and placed her hand upon the arm of Rosalita, a smile of gentleness imparted light ard splendouı to her beau¬ ty—" I was suspicious, proud, unbending for all ray migl ty wrongs gnawed and festered m my bieast We parted, and I was happiei but ah, that happiness fled with the coming hour' Barbarossa re tuined fiom Constantinople, returned to Algiers, but not as heretofore—not to seek his wedded Zuluna. That night I
tossed upon a restless pillow sleep forsook my eyes, and peace my heart the hours of darkness were hours of torture all that I had ever heard recurred, and in the in¬ dignity of outraged feeling, I upbraided thee with filsehooc! Again I lent a ready ear to ey ery idle circulation the whisper¬ ed scandal gathered— Barbarossa sighed foi the Sicilian captive, and my bram whnled ш madness I dare not tell the wild and shapeless schemes which rose and weie ι ejected passion mastered every bettei principle and for α season, goaded on to deeds of blood and muider, I would destroy thee—I would destroy myself—I would ι end the heart of Barbarossa, through the annihilation of all he best loved But my boy, my darling Sehm, plucked me back to better thoughts and better feel¬ ings How could I clip the string of his young life, oi cast him mto the worlds rough billows, without the stay and safe¬ guard of a mothers love' Tears, blessed tears, like ram upon the parched earth, melted the stone within ' ϊ would seek
thee ν et again—question thee yet again , and through the imposing emble-as of thy own idolatrous worship, sift trutii from falsehood Fatima was my ready agent m all the needful preparation Through ч Christian slave, Fatima obtained yon cross and missal, and hghted up the altar as though for midnight worship and here, before this altar—for hearts remain the same, howe\ er the rite may vary—by thy God, and mv God, even to the despite of my mortal life, I swear to serve and aid thee through this pending peril No words —no thanks, ' checking all effort to speak ' 'Tıs for thy sake, and my sake, and the sake of one who was brought hither, to reach thy heart, if it proved invulnerable to all beside ' She clapped her hands suddenly as she spoke, and a long drapery of cumson tuf- feta, flowing and closing in a nook of the temple, was as suddenly drawn aside and upon a couch, "all redolent in sweets, watched by the faithful Fatima, lay a cherub boy, blooming and lovely as the
gay and fragrant blossoms, which, as a rich garnish, la/ scattered around" " My child · the child of Hayradm Barbarossa « ' tremulously pronounced Zuhma then snatching him to her bosom, and covenng his fair face with kissess, she held him forward " Thou wilt not rob me of his father, she pursued " thou wilt not doom his infant years to blight and sorrow." " Never —never ' ejaculated Rosahta " I will die rather than do tliee wrong "

Doubtless the promises and the seciet power of Zuhma gave her heart and cou¬ rage to meet the coming trial; for she murmured not, neither did she give words to the indignity of her feelings, when told that Hayradm Barbarossa would m person welcome hei to Algiers, that he would seek her that night, and ciave, in her coveted smile, some recompence foi past perils and past disappointments Not a single observation did all the glowing eu¬ logies of Gulnara excite, she accepted hei proffered services, and without struggle or seeming reluctance, decked herself m robes of spotless white, clasped with her own hands the pearl incriisted rivets, knotted up her raven hair, and cast around her brow a veil of gossamer lightness She moved with a firm and steady step, and she took her station at an open b ilcony, seemingly attentive to the sweetly melt¬ ing melodies, which from invisible musi¬ cians, filled and floated on the ambient air Suddenly the mazy dance began, and light and sylph-like forms, guised in fan-
tastic masquerade, gliding from tmbosom- ïng shrubs, met on the sward beneath All ivas gay illusion the dance, a kind of allegory—at least Rosalita fanuied it to be so—for thorns and crosses were thick scatteied in the path of one wearing the rainbow tints and bearing the bow and quiver of young Love, the torch, half extinguished, half borne down by Time and Chance till Constancy, in robes of azure, fanning the dying flame, it glowed anew and quiete blazed out in almost day¬ light brightness ' One gliding form, close veiled, and sparkling in siher tissue, hke stai s m night s dark cinopy, advanced with mea¬ sured step, then paused beneath the bal¬ cony A shower of sweets ensued, for rich in summers bright and beamy em¬ blems, Flora shook on high her teeming cornucopia and all that was rare and ex¬ quisite to sight and smell, flew in wild disolder ' One bouquet of orange-flowers lay at voi in с

forest trees, the sloping sides mantled with olives, vineyard», and corn the snow- dappled myrtle, the ied blossoming olean¬ der, fringing the nver s banks and ever and anon, through sudden and pictu¬ resque gaps, like sapphires set in an eme¬ rald ground, the shining waves of the blue sea, breaking and sporting on the pebbled shore ' But De la Pole bad no nerve for con¬ templation, else might he have mused long and not unaptly at the gradu il de cline of a bnght day, sinking and deepen¬ ing into mght and likened it to the sunset of worth and holiness, worn out in spirit, and passing from time to eternity ' Once, in the gtthertng loneliness, the sudden and shrill shriek of α solitary sea gull sounded as evil bodement to his ear, his colour faded and his spirit drooped it seemed as though it wailed his return to Sicily, and as the sickening pang came over him, he checked rein for he read sorrow in the augury As the bird ho¬ vered over lum, it shrieked again, and
De la Pole shuddered, as though a death- knell sounded He was not superstitious; perhaps at any other season he had smiled at tlte casualty, but now, all seemed dip¬ ped and died in gloom Since Ins depar¬ ture from S m Angelo, peril and calamity had so crowded on each other, that his health and his spirit weie alike woin, and his v et y anticipations clouded The black bed of ashes, which lay spread between the villige of Nicolost and the monastery of San Nicolas della Rena, recuired to memory—the night he had passed in that convent—the shadowy ind ilmost super- humm being, who had crossed his path m the w iste of hva, md doled forth woe Alas' the prophet) had been duly accom¬ plished heedless ot the denouncement, he had dared the landing in England, and he had escaped from England, with for¬ tune w recked, and every feeling outraged Was it indeed the living breathing murderer 'l n rei' or was it the spectre- vtsitaitt of another world ? As these ap¬ palling fancies crossed him, the springs of
life seemed to wither up and fail, death- damps oozed from his forehead, and every limb trembled When he revived to consciousness and to power, he found himself on the green sward, and his hoise browsing quietly be¬ side him He sprung upon Ins feet and looked around, his eyes fell upon the high hill of San Calogero, and the view brought with it the dream of the past Bosalita mingled in every scene—shone through the light and wavy mists winch veiled creation, past hours revived hours, en¬ deared to memory houi s, brief and bi ight, as Поме sof parad sc 1 yt u о and when again he vaulted into the saddle, all of gloom hid passed away, smiles lighted up hi» features, for hope played anew in his heart Not for an instant did he tarry in the little fishing town of Cefalu but clapping spurs to horse, eie the last burnish of pi t- ìng day had faded m the west, he beheld

not heı look of wild despair , he stooped down, he held her for a moment to his bosom, and then be kissed her brow of snow, and hurried from the palace Long did Kos.ıiıta lay on the ottoman, with ears bared, with breath suspended, listening to the wild acclamations which rose and rang through the distant city , shuddering, almost shrieking, at the din¬ ning bursts, sounding the knell of all her hopes Hour after hour passed—the mght— the next day—and the bashaw returned not, neither did balm reach her heart through the gentle offices of the princess Zuhma Gulnara was her sole attend¬ ant, and Gulnara could only talk of Bar- barossa's renown and glory—of the splen¬ dour of his great deeds—of the universal¬ ity of his conquests,—how, step by step, he had mounted the ladder of fame, how, when an unknown corsair, with one single galley, he had ploughed the deep, and biaved the flags of eveiy nation under heaven ' Alas · what was the swollen list

Zealand ardour of his accumulating hordes: a s*xong body of horse and foot needed but the call to enter the field : and though he well knew, that such light troops, op¬ posed to the veteran infantry and heavy- armed cavalry of the imperial army, could essay but little, his confidence lay in the strength of his fortresses, and in the dis¬ cipline and determined courage of his Turkish allies. The sounds of war and vengeance dissi¬ pated all the golden dreams of love and pleasure : a new world seemed to open ; new hopes, new scenes, to supersede the voluptuous languor of the past. Rosalita heard nought, save the loud clash of the distant kettle-drum, and the shrill braying ofthe warlike trumpet. If she ventured ought of question, she was told of zealots hastening to the unfurled standard of the corsair, of the hardy confidence and bold daring of the Turkish soldiery, of their past deeds of intrepidity and valour, when opposed to the knights of St. John, the enrolled and sworn champions of Chris¬ tendom.

floahng in warm and close conjunction, as tbough the animosities of Chnstian men were smothered down and silenced in the one common cause ' Fieedom to the cap¬ tive' vengeance on the infidel foe' To have mounted the battlements of the cas¬ tle of Cagliari —to liave cast eye upc n the mustenng of that vast armament—to have marked the proud and costly banners, darkening and dappling the waves, had been to have foigotten the ills and strifes of life, to have dreamt back upon the Christian world, the ìeign of universal peace and concord ' The pen ot the chronicler informs us, that the emperor Chailes the Fifth, m preparation for the long projected enter¬ prise against the corsair Baibarossa, gi- thered together all the united strength ot his vast dominions —That ittended by the flower ofthe Spawsh robiht), he em¬ barked at Barcelona, and that Clusten- dom, emulous to share in the renown and the glory, poured in her subsidies,—that the infant don Louis headed a consider-
ible squadron from Portugal,—that the veteran bands of Italians and Spaniards crov^ded tbe galleys of Sicily and Naples, —that the Flemish fleet bore the German infantry fiom the ports of the Low Coun¬ tiy ,—that Andrew Dona, appointed high admiral of the fleet, conducted his own gullies —thatPennode Ponte, then grand master of Malta, furnished eighteen bri¬ gantines of different sizes, four Maltese gallies, all manned with his bravest knights, togethei with a vessel, called the gieat earrack, equivalent in itself almost to a squadron ' But thei e was one eye dim, thtre was one heart sad, although it throbbed with tnmitv and bitter bate,—that heart beat beneath the non corslet of Arthur de la Pole He gazed upon the assembled forces he buckled on his own the bleed¬ ing wrongs of thousands, he entered into ill the proud bearing of the enterprise, yet he felt that more than revenge was wanting to his happiness—that the anni¬ hilation of Barbarossa, that the annihila-
tion of the whole of the states of Bar- bary—from the extremest point of, Mo¬ rocco, even unto Barca— could not give back his treasure, or restore the peace he had lost. A bright aod gay sua—casting the full tide of his splendour upon the light and feathery wave, in earnest, to minds versed in types and auguries, of forthcoming glory without shadow—shone upon the unfurl¬ ed ensigns of the combined fleets, as proudly they sailed from the port of Cag¬ liari. It was on the sixteenth day of July 1535, and on the twenty-fifth day of July 1535) the eventful blow was struck, and the power of the corsair Barbarossa shaken ' The great fame and mighty darings of Charles the Fifth, had lighted up in every breast enthusiasm and expectation. As in the crusades of the olden time, the one 'Unanimous spirit glowed and burned in the common cause: all that could bear arms, all who could boast of honours, had rallied to the standard of the sovereign : the eyes and the interest of all Europe
were fixed on the stupendous project ; and the policy of Francis of France, and the bold impiety of Henry of England, were forgotten, or unheeded, in this warfare of grace and charity. It was to give liberty to tbe oppressed; it was to file off the chains of slavery, to blunt tbe rangs, and curb the giant strength of the infidel Turk; and all who bore in their bosoms the love of Christ, and of justice, lent arm and sword and interest to the calling. Rumour, which fails not to bandy with almost incredible speed the movements and the motives ofthe great, long ere the Christian fleet appeared before Tunis, had sped the threatening tidings to the ear of Barbarossa; and vigour, and intrepidity, and active diligence, had aroused that mighty chief from the enfeebling trance of passion. He called in all his corsairs ; and withdrawing from Algiers all the forces which could be spared, with the flower of his strength passed by sea to Tunis. Presents and promises he scattered with a ready hand amid Moors and Arabs : and
such was the magic of his aiguments, that the bigoted and ignorant chiefs of the wild tribes, looked to him, as the man singled out by Heaven for the preserva¬ tion of their faith, and the avengement of their prophet Soon did a mighty crowd of men and horse sui round him but too well did he know tlie ti ied cou¬ rage and discipline of the veteran tioops he had to encoimt<4, to pm much faith upon such raw and iiii_xpeiienced bands his dependensi lay in his Tuikish soldiers, trained and armed m the European fa¬ shion, and in the strength of his fort, the Goletta, into whicli he threw, undei the command of Sınan, a renegade Jew, and the best experienced of his corsairs, six thousand Turkish soldiers The name ot Muley-Hascen, the deposed king of Tu¬ nis, whose cause and claims were sup¬ ported and upheld by the special favour of the empeior Charles, and who was known to be on board the fleet, acted on the galled minds of the bai banans as oil cast upon fire· for the pohcy of 1> Hba-
rossa had declared him — and his close leagti w ith the Christian forces had con¬ firmed him—an open apostate to his faith, and an abettoi of the huge powei, whose aim and object was said to be the extirpa¬ tion ofthe Mahomedan religion In the common events, and common enmities of common life, flymg and irri¬ tating cmrencies fail not to widen and «-xtend the breach —can we i-nvcl then, that fierce ind unqualified hale gendered alike in the breasts of Christian «imi лт- cM tint never, when giapphiig urno death on the pi uns of P destine, did they inticipite the meeting in a more savage ind mote bitter mood' From the extant records ot tbat heroic siege, wc gle in, that the disembarkation of the Christi in foices on the coast of Bar¬ bary, headed by the emperor Charles the Fifth, was followed by the close and im¬ mediate invesrure of the Goletta, that three se piuite attacks were concerted, and severally committed to the Gei mans, Spa¬ niards, and Italians, each alike emulous ot
renown, goaded on by religious zeal, and vying with each other in courage and mi¬ litary discipline The sea, commanded and scoured by an able and prosperous fleet, under the direction and control of the brave Andrew Dona, pouted into the Chnstian camp, all the necessaries, and all the luxuries of life, so that men marvel led, and above all, Muley Hascen, the exiled king of Tunis,—who among tl e strifes and wars of his wild tnbes, had never seen the like of magnificence and order,—gazed upon the emperor Charles, as one supremely rich, and gifted far above the ordinary blessings of oidmary men' Warm and fieri vere the stiuggles for supremacy and honour The nobles of each nation, crowding around the warnor sovereign, contending the posts of dangei, and panting for the coming strife, their spirits nerved and stimulated, even to the dizzying height of middening enthusiasm, by the waving ensigns of Mahomet, thick planted on the walls and ramparts of the Goletta by the spreading town ard fleet

of the Turkish banner, and battered and close pressed by the Maltese gallies By means of a barca-longa, backed by the furious fire of the great earrack, a breach was soon effected and scarce was it wide enough to scale, when with one simulta¬ neous rush, heided by the standaid-bearer of the order, the knif'its leaped from the sides of their gillies mto then long boats, and from thence into the sea—sw ord in hand—buffeting the waves—wading above their girdles to the shore—moving with the fleetness of light, with the furv ofthe devastating whu 1 wind—clinging to the tottering walls—springing from point to point, spite of the missiles, and boiling pitch, and sweeping fire of the «sailed ' Ahke devoting limb and hie to tbe cause of Christendom, Arthur de la Pole, begiimed with dust and blood, planted foot upon the battlements of the great tower, at the instant the standard of the crescent fell, and the w hite cross of St John waved above it He saw a wairior, dad ш sable, snatch at the Turkish stand-
ard, and rend and trample it beneath his feet, then, amid the pealing acclamations of the victors, amid the dinning clash of sounds, he saw him leap from the tower, and he lost him in the smoke and dust of conflict The next instant, the warrior again appeared with a turbaned head upon ins lance it wis the head of the janizary commanding the Turkish soldiers, and the second in iánk to Sman, the renegade Jew, and he held up the bleeding trophy, with a shout and a yell, which spoke the malice and the spirit of a demon One bound, and he stood at the side of De la Pole, Iip viewed him stedfastly sternly, then casting the head at his feet—" Seest thou this head' he demanded -" seest thou these hands, steeped in infidel blood ' Answer me, grandson of Claience, will this blood wash out the blood of the mur¬ dered '—will this deed appease the ghosts of tbe slain ? As he spoke, he raised bis visor, and Arthur recognised the shrunken, wasted, spectre-face of 1 m el No longer the self-
devoted''penitent, macerating strength arid'life by severe and endless endurance ; buttile champion ofthe cross, toiling out redemption in the blood of the bre. doomed*. The pause was the pause of a moment —Tirrel dropped his visor, and bounded away, with the laugh and the shout of a maniac. De la Pole looked after him—call¬ ed after him, but in vain : all was blood, and smoke, and ruin : the work of war went on, and stronger duties claimed him. He too waded amid the carnage ; he too joined in the task of human de¬ struction : he saw the wo.ste of blood and lives, but he fought for the cross—he fought for Rosalita : relenting pity found no harbour in his bosom : the infidel cor¬ sair, swooping upon his treasure, had de¬ spoiled him of hope, and revenge fell as balm on the festering wounds of memory.
Stimulated almost to frenzy, he sought, he plunged into the thickest of the fray, hee'4tìss of the stones, lances, and arrows, flying around—heedless of the sweeping devastation of the musketiy life was as d thing not woi th the holding, foi life held forth no chai m it was cold, blank, and rayless—to him a world without a sun ' Stubborn and uii)ielding, Sınan, the tiusted oflicer ot Bnbarossa, brave even to the despite of life, manfully and tena- ciousl) resisted the b itteniig fire of the assailants, now striving to sweep the be siegers from the lampaits, now in fre¬ quent sallies, pouring down fire and death on the Chnstian camp But vain were his eifot ts , v am the strides of his giant stiength, vain his loud haiangues, vain the unfurled trophies of his pronhet nought could stay the ι aging whirlwind it scittered blast md t um , it foamed and it tossed, like the eddies of the ocean , the an scoi clung with flame the dense smoke, rolling m huge volumes, burn- voi in к

Often would Rosalita forget her own woes, in tbe studied offices of kindness and good-will, which so strikingly con¬ trasted the outward seeming of her com¬ panions ; often would she smile upon the courtesy, whioh in pity to her slight form and accredited weakness, would compel her to mount the camel, and ride at the side of Cadiga : and then she would lend ear to the quaint remarks and peevish garrulity of the old woman, and laugh— for even mirth is contagious—at the pi¬ quant wit and random pleasantry, with which heedless and flippant youth will assail the staader habits of .age. But these indulgencies were brief and rare, for self- commune was ever the surest balm to her sick soul. When resting in the heat of the day, she would steal away from the tent, to ponder on her duties, and strive
by every power of reason to strengthen her mmd to the fulfilment of the task el- lotted to her, to pray for grace and strength m every coming ill But though youth be the season in which we pluck flowers in the roughest road, no flower gemmed the dreariness of her road The kindly beings around her might bear her to Tunis—through their means she might return to Sicily—but barrenness awaited her there Alas' the once bright hues of this world were wofully changed, all its enchantments were broken, all its hopes destroyed hfe lay befoie her in its naked meagre reality—beyond life she looked, and there alone did her tried and worn spirit picture rest ' Sometimes tbe remembrante of the fa¬ tal ceremony, which by the sacred rite of her own church, had bound her to the fortunes of Barbarossa, would arise, and press upon her like a mound of lead tben would her spirit again feel to die within her, and her brain to whirl almost in mad¬ ness Was it — could it be cnme, to
dwell on the past scenes of love and pro mise — to dream over again, the mere dream of happiness, past and gone—to cherish in her heart s core, the image and the faith of De h Pole—to gaze on the evening-star, and muse upon the hour of parting, till tears, dimming hei sight, would shut out that bright stai, and stream in torrents down her pale cold cheek ' There were peuods, when the sombre habit of religion would offer the only pro¬ per covering to her woes, when her mind, full of pious grititude for past escape and present safety, 'urn to the well known cloister ita Maria dl Tindaro with trusting с etence —there to pray for the friends from whom fate had sever¬ ed hei, there to devote the remnant ot her days, to the uinufflecl waveless calm of devotional exercise Then again, the image of her father, sold into slavery, lingering out life in privation and chains, would impart a new colour to her feelings, would make her, in the heroism of filial

The bare anticipation nerved her with courage under every existing trial : though she felt and mourned the false vain worship of those with whom capricious fate had leagued her—though she wept " to think of the lasting bitterness of its fruit"— prayer, humble fervent prayer, stiffing the jarring tumult, reconciled her to present forbearance, enveloped all in the one uni¬ versal mantle of charity. The frequent struggle, and secret in¬ dulgence of emotion, was marked and pitied by Cadiga : even Aben-Amet, rough-cast and ungentle by habit and by natuie, yielded consideration and patience to the preying griefs of his youthful charge. The tale of stolen love and awakened jealousy, framed by the cautious policy of' Fatima, had cast around the supposed Ibrahim, the misty haze of ro-
mance Wild and ideal colourings were given to the source of feeling he was a lover, despairing and alone, severed in the season of hope from all that hope best pictures, destined, hy the fiat of power, to long and heavy trial—belike, to eternal separation from the being beloved " Bear up, said Cadiga, long marking in sdence the cast of care and melancholy which pervaded the features of Rosalita " This is the season for rest of body be it also the season foi rest of mind The tent lay spread in a waste, so drear and wild, in a solitude so profound, that sickly fancy might bend ear and listen for those A y to gu s that syl able raen s an ев О sa lis a ti silo e a fl dese t w rlernesses.

exterminating firebrand, aiming tbe over throw of their temples and their worship —as a sweeping, an overwhelming power, which like the waves of the mighty ocean, buffetting and breaking the barriers would inundate and lay waste, their trea sures and their liberties, then, and for ever The records of that period, so faithfully handed down by our penman, holds to our scared view the swollen muster roll of ten thousand Christians, then dragging the chains of their slavery in the streets of Tunis! It further tells us, that che walls of funis, though of great extent were too weak to stand a siege and that Barbarossa, aware of the hazard, and find mg himself at the head of fifty thousand men, boldly resolved to meet the enemy, and rest the fate of himself and kingdom on the issue of a battle But though in courage and intrepidity we light upon few hi&üompetitois, we are compelled, in following the line of strict veraaty, to cast mky blackness on his
fame—not as a politician, not as a warrior —but as a man The ten thousand Chns> ttan slaves, shut Up by his order in the ci tadel, were doomed by him to massacre he dreaded mutiny dunng the absence of his army, and he urged the base precau¬ tion, in the midst of the council he had called together One thrill of horror pervaded the whole assembly though familiar to the barba¬ rous trade of pnaey and bloodshed, the cold deliberate murder filled them with dismay the policy was overruled—the Chnstian slaves spared—and Barbarossa, with a conscience comparatively clean, heading his arm), marched out of Tunis The white tents ofthe European legtons were broken up at the first dawning of day, and the preparations for a rapid match began All was bustle and energy withm the camp the loud blasts of the trumpets echoing along the shore; the shrill fife and animating drum, arousing every slumberer to action A veteran band of Spanish soldiers were left to gar-
rison the Goletta, and according to the forms and usages of war, every means were essayed, and every precaution taken, to prevent the possibility of surprise, foi well they knew, ambush, and tieachery, and sudden incursion, to be the practised warfare of the foe—well they knew, thf swoop of the hell kite to be less deadly, than the blast and fire of piratical hate ' The sun but dimly shone through the mists of ocean, when the troops marched forth, with spints braced unto death, and minds tempered for endurance—led by the brave and ardent Charles, rich in past conquests, and panting for conquests to come '—tnals and hardships of climate un thought of, the burning sands and hot blasts of the desert despised, every pulse attuned to war—every hope and every an¬ ticipation bent on battle ' But though energy and courage may be wound to almost superhiimaii-eiTorts, strength and nature may fail m the task ing The march lay through an unknown country, flat and barren, over a waste of
sand, without tree, or shrub, or rock, to shelter—without stream or spnng to slack intolerable thirst a cloudless fiery sun, blistering, and burning, and scorching in¬ to fever If they halted, if they glanced around, it w as to measure miles of steri¬ lity it was to gaze on a yellow stagnant plain, unruffled by a breeze—unchequered by a track—uncheered by a single beacon yet did they manfully toil, hour after hour, nspired by the harangues, and ner¬ ved by the example of their leaders and when, like the sparkling of a thousand stars the sunbeams fell upon the glitter¬ ing columns of the enemy, the shout they threw up to heaven, savoured of ought save exhaustion ' We read that the Moors and Arabs, e-nbolde ed by their vast supenonty in numbers, rushed on to the attack that with the whoop and the yell of wai, they fell upon the Chnstian hosts, and soon rued the hardihood of their undisciplined courage The veteran forces, trained from the wars of Europe, were as a bulwark of
steel ; the steady charge and fire of their guev sweeping all before them. In vain Barbarossa sought the hottest points of conflict ; in vain, with desperate valour, he urged back to the attack : all gave way—Moors, and Arabs, and Turks, in one tumultuous rush—the rout was uni¬ versal : Barbarossa himself, muttering the curses of execration and hate, was forced by the common stream, and borne back to¬ wards the city. Sttange and wild were the vicissitudes of that day ; like a scene in a drama, or the changing shifting caprices of a dream. The city held forth no harbour for him The Christian captives, desperate through oppression and misery, in the absence of the one common tyrant, had burst their bonds —knocked off their fetters—overpowered the Turkish garrison—seized upon the citadel, and turned the artillery of the fort upon those who had so lately been their mastéťsV 1 Barbarossa fled away towards Bonâf; arid a deputation, explaining the noble efforts and recovered liberty of the
slaves, and beanng the keys of Tunis, met the victorious Charles, as with precaution —.the growth of experience—he was slow¬ ly advancing on his march, little calculating on a levolution so favourable to his inte¬ iest To dip deeper into the page of history, is to dip into a sea of blood Some fatal eiror, some luckless indecision on the part of the emperor Chailes, dimmed the lustre of the conquest, in pounng outrage, rum, and flame, on the defenceless city One ι mpulsive rush of the distempered soldiery, and all was massacre, all was commotion, wild and lesistless as the waves ofthe sea, when buffeting the storm One crowd- one trampling—one universal cry ' Merpy and pity winged from earth, and despair and death îemamed Like Milton's apos¬ tate angel, 1 re a, te fu с err Ые as 1 cil one dark form was seen striding through the din, tauntmg the suffering—rending, outraging the dying—collecting, tearing,

CHAPTER II
Wf must now return to our hero, who was sailing with line weather and a fur Tund to the Cape As he dined at the captain's table, and appeared to be placed under his particular cbarge, he was treated with politeness bv all on board, and most kindly by general Morningthorpe, to whom h° devoted much of his time, and had he been assured tbat he was not regretted at Channg, or rather had his conscience suf¬ fered Inm to feel quite easy under his sense of ingratitude towards his mother, the ba¬ ronet, and some other of Ins friends, he might have been comparaţii ely hippy yet, were lord Walbngford to lie believed, be must have acted right, but then again, might not the earl have bten blinded by prejudice? Ought he to have bten solely guided by bis wishes, when his own heai t spoke m fivour of his mothei and sir Htr-
bert ?—He now felt tbat he had insensibly been drawn on to follow the earl s lead and Injunctions, the secrecy required ought to have appeared suspicious, and he should at least have consulted with Selby, if not with Dr Margiam then again, as he tdt assuied of nis illegitimacy, be almost re¬ joiced at Ь ing retimi ed ftom the \ ortex oí lus for nei fnends , and as his father bad undertaken to provide foi him, he en¬ deavoured to feel satisfied Still the futuro appeared vciy indistinct, and he could not help regretting Ins precipitancy, when re¬ collecting the gipsey w oman, he hoped her prophecy, thnt should he ever b-, in trouble, his conduct to-taids hei would prove Ins sttfetTiiard, would be fulfilled, he resolved tht ι Aire to trust to that Power who so often bungs good out of evil, and to con¬ ti n e some means, through the medium of general Momingthorpe, of letting Dr Margram know he was bvmg, and in the road to preferment, as the general grew daily more attached to bim, and found great resources from the tedium of a long «ıı лце in lus com ersation and continued
attention, while his nephew openly ex¬ pressed nis dislike of India, finding no amusement but in recapitulating bis school pranks, few of winch redounded to bis ho¬ nour, and many were, by our heio, deemed disgracelul specimens ot low fun and of а spirit of mischief At first this hopeful youth found great amusement m what he deemed quizzing his excellent uncle to his face, and turning him mto ridicule behind his back but the general s silent contempt and cool uidiffei- eiice soon cured lum of the first, and our heros senous remonstrances prevented bis giving way to the latter propensity he therefore contented himself with mimick¬ ing Henry to those whom he could thus amase, frequently advising htm to ex¬ change his swoid for a pen, he was much more fitted to dnidge at a desk than to shine in tbe field he ought to have been a lawyer, as his early gravity exactly fitted him for a judge Henry turned a deaf ear to lus rattle, not chooi»ng to tal e offence at tbe silly effusions of this scbuolooy, wlio 1 incied
tl at lus uncle s rank anıl his uncles money gave lum the liberty of q iizzing (his fa¬ vounte word) all those he deemed bis m- fenors, till the serious resentment of the general put α hn il cheek to his imperti¬ nence and induced hnn to treat every one with politeness Conscious that be was going among per¬ fect strangers and that his advancement solely depended upon his talents and ex¬ ertions, our hero seriously appi ed himself to the study of the eastern languages, in winch he was greatly assisted by the ge¬ neral, from whom he acquired much ne cessary and useful knowledge, and who kindly promised to second bis exertions and to recommend him to many of his friends Mr Henry Percival, who thought Ins uncle an old proser, generally left them tete à tete and he could not have done a w iser thing since he bad a most strenuous advocate in Henry, who found nuch bet¬ ter excuses for his levity than he ever brought forward himself, and gloss«! ofer lus more senous faults with infinite ad¬ dress
His generous endeav ouis were not over looketl bj the general to whom be soon liecame almost necessai у since he felt him self so much at bis ease w ıth this excellent man that he had never appealed to greater advantage With sir Herbert С harici ille he'was always niitltr α tle 0 ıee oi restraint never having been precisely unare what reul degree of connexion or iffimtv existed between them till his fathei had told him how nearly he was related to luly Charle ville with whom be bad always been less at his ease than with the baronet since, tliough dotingly fond of lum she always affected resene and tffectuilly reptile d his advances to greatei intimacy Dr Margram s age and authority h id prevent cd famíliái ity Selby alone was therefoie aware of his naln e drollen Ins talents fe r conveisation and the real powers of Ins mind wluth giadually became apparent to his new U acquired friend ¡lossibly bis having been reared anion,? stiangcis ind never baung had a fnend if we exctpt Selby, was all in his favoni as he was the moie giateful foi the generals notice, the
more an »uns to improve his regard, and the more desirous to eontnbute to his tomfort while his nephew, trusting to their relutionship, neglected to cultivate Ins esteem or to minister to Ins pkasures, thinking be made a sufficient sacrifice wlien he ceased to turn the old gentleman into lnhcule besides Femberton, who w ıs as great a qui» as the old one, was al¬ ways ready to listen to his descnptions of Indiai and to attend to his cautions as to himself He had accompanied his unde, because be had no option, but the old man would soon discov er tbat he had bet¬ tor have left lum behind and if he eould but induce hnn tp send bim bome with а handsome provision, he would readily ti"4isfer his expected nubtaiy rank and promise of gloiy to Henry Pembeiton, w ho hav ing by lus own account, nothing to lose, must despise danger 4ome few listened to hnn, and some ар pliiuded lum, wishing to raider Inm more presumptuous when, to bis gieat joy, th» Asia came to an anthor m Table Baj, am! the passengei s, as usual, landed at Cap
Town, when the captain, having under stood that a sort of epidemical complaint vi as prevalent in one ot the q larteis ol tbe town peculiarly appropriated to the mba bitants of colour and the lower class ot European,settlers, particularly cautioned lus crew and younger passengers against approaching that district No one felt in¬ chned to infringe his orders or slight his request but Harry Percival, wbo laughed at what he deemed sueb absurd cautions, telbng Henry that most of the ft ее houses of entei tainment were situated in this pro¬ hibited quarter therefore he surmised his uncle had induced the captain to hold out a fever m Urrarem, to prevent lum from enjoying himself, declaring he would not be so disappointed of his amusement, and urging Henry to accompany him in his peregi inatiojis Our hero declined the invitation, telling him that he understood from undoubted authonty many oieople had fallen victims to the disorder, the nature of which was hardly understood, as it varied according
to the strength or constitution of those at¬ tacked. ľereival guessed he would side witli the greybeards, declaring he believed he was some old fellow, who, fbr his former sins, was obliged to do penance under the ap¬ pearance of a youth, and condemned, like Tantalus, never to gratify any of his wishes on appetites; or else, like lord Angelo, he scarce ¡confessed that his blood flowed, or that his appetite was more to -bread than stone. " I would only liave you remember, that ytìur own life and that of many others are at stake." " You may as Well preach to the winds, Harry Graveairs; my unde may relish your morality—I despise your hypocrisy." Henry, though seriously offended, made no reply, gratitude towards the unde ren¬ dering him much inore indulgent to the nephew's faulte, who did contrive, un¬ known to tbe worthy general, to spend a couple of nights at some low house of en¬ tertainment within the proscribed quarter, of which he boasted to our hero when they
returned on board, appearing to consider it meritorious the having dared risking bis existence, declanng he was a predestinarían, therefore felt convinced that be should not die a minute the soonei foi having run into danger, though be hid neither seen any ete ill, nor heard of any one being attieked by this imaginary complaint — Henry hoped he had not been so rash as he wished to make him believ e, caution ing lum against mpntioning bis folly to any one else, smce, weie it even suspected that he had brought any infection 01 board, it would render the passengers and crew ι cry uncomfortable Foi once he afreed to the justice of oin hero s remarks and when, at the expiration of three daj s, he began to fi.ar he had imbibed this certainlj dangerous complaint, his dread of deatii was not likely to accelerate his cure Henry, who alone knew how nchly he deserved to suffer, now cautiously revealed the truth to the general, requesting he would as yet appear the dupe of the inva lid, since any agitation ot the mind must Ulerease lus disoidei The geneial was ex
eessivcly provoked, but being still more därmed, be agreed to the propriety ol Henry s suggestions, and affetted to sup¬ pose Perenni s headache und otlier symp¬ toms arose from indigestion and fortu n itch aiailoi, who liad been equally im¬ prudent, was attacked still mole violently, is this removed the dreidful stigmn of b ivm^ lwariled the safety of all on board from tlie invalid Percival who kept about till tbe seaman was pronounced to bc at¬ tacked with the much dreaded complaint, when the gener il declared his nephew had sickened of the fright, which the surgeon did not contradict, and every precaution human prudence conld suggest w as adopt¬ ed to pievent the infection bom spreading, unfortunately without having the desired effect and w hat was more to be lamented, the first surgeon was among the fiist vic¬ tims to this imprudent youth's folly, though the sailor, who had soon paid the debt of nature, was even more guilty, and be boie all the blame, and certainly iather reconciled the general to Ins now suflermg nephew
The surgeon s mates yvere supposed to be skilful, but bad not had the same ex ¡lenente, andas the disolder spiead like wildfire among the passengers and officers, the alarm and distress doily mere ised A total separation took place between those w ho hatl bitbci to enjoj "d good health, and those who were in the slightest degree nt tucked The sailors bore up much the best they were more in the an, less alarmed at the ideu of dying, and were better able to submit to the neeess u v re gimen and precautions to insure then safe ty Captain Molesworth was mdefitigable in his endeavours to jiresene those most useful people from contagion fumigations of every kmd und sort were constantly employed, and be maintained the stnctest discipbue among his men, till he also nn bibed the complaint, owing to bis not having taken many of the precautions he so strongly enforced, the agitation ot Ins mmd having also contributed to his sei zure, and he proved the eighteenth л ittim to this virulent disordei m the course of six weeks
Our hero, who had been the constant attendant upon the imprudent Peruval, was reported not to have long survived the surgeon, since, after a time, the few survivors hardly knew who had died or who were convalescent Many were sup¬ posed to have expired for want of medical assistance, others were suspected to have been unskilfully treated fortunately, as it appeared, general Mormngthorpe pre¬ served both his health and spirits, possibly from being the only one on board who had either the means or the skill to ward off the complaint His principal attend¬ ant, a man of colour, was no despicable surgeon, and the general had made a great study of physľ- , still they weie unable to preserve the captain's hfe though Harry Percival was supposed to be convalescent, at least he existed, but in so weak and precanous a state, tbat no one saw lum but his uncle and his valet, the other at¬ tendant having been among the first vic¬ tims to the complaint, but, owing to the generals judicious advice and very wise VOL III с
precautions, the first mate was merely slightly attacked, and was never confined, but be only appeared a» second uı com¬ mand to tlie general, wbo soon became aH and every thing on board, acting n cap¬ tain, cbaplam, and physician tie alone had kept a regular register of the deaths, and he alone had listened to the dying in¬ junctions of tbe captam, surgeon, and many more, no corpse had been committed to the deep without a due regard to tbe ntes of rehgion, and the few survivors among tlie petty officers declared they owed their existence to tins excellent man, nor were tbe crew less grateful and as, owing to his excellent management and skilful arrange¬ ments, every dread of future infection was removed before they reacbed Bengal, they were, merely upon the general β represen tahon, subjected to a short quarantine, from which he was first released, and land¬ ed, with his weak and helpless patient and faithful attendant, at the least likely spot to endanger the safety of others, and as a farther precaution, he took up his abode in an almost solitary habitation, whither
he had the invalid removed, and wheţe tliey received no visitors till the general thought he might safely wait upon the governor-general ; when, having delivered in bis report to that nobleman respecting the business which had taken him to Eng¬ land, and entered into some distressing de¬ tails respecting the mdancholy condusion of bis voyage, he departed, with his hardly- recovered invalid and proper attendants, for his government.
CHAPTER III.
No event of importance occurred in Eng. land connected with our story, till strange and unsatisfactory reports got abroad re¬ specting tbe mortality which had occurred on board the Asia. It wks already known that a very contagious disorder, which had proved fatal to many, had raged at the Cape before the medical men resident there ca
had been able to stop its progiess, and it was also ascertained that tbe Asm bad been met in the Indian seas, when, grievous to relate, the same disorder prevailed on board, at least such was the mere verbal commu¬ nication which had passed betw een the two vessels, to which was added, that several of the passengers and officers had died, and among others, Mr Walsmgham, the sur¬ geon No one felt more anxious to learn who were the suivivois than lord Wallmgfoid, and he was theiefore among the first to make inquines at the India House, the moment he heard that news had arrived direct from Bengal The director to whom he applied was sorry he could not set his mmd at ease (as he acknowledged himself to be much interested in one of the latest nominated cadets), since the dispatches, which bad been sent off by a ship on the point ot sailing when the Asia reached Bengal, and which did sad while she was perfoimmg quarantine, merely contained general accounts of the misfqrtune, Cap tain Molesworth, Mr Walsingbani, and
some others whose names w ere particularly mentioned, had died during the passage, but nothing authentic was known respect¬ ing the more inferior officer) nor tbe ca¬ dets General Morningthorpe bad kept a proper registi r, they were informed, and when he w nted upon the governor-gene¬ ral, they sliould le im every pirticular, at present, they could not satisfy any inqui¬ ries, as they had resolved not to propagate what might prove erroneous The earl, like many mor'e therefore remained in suspense during the tnsiung three montbs, when another ship brought over general Morningthorpe s ow n actoiint of this dis tressing voyage, to which was subjoined the naines of the deceased, among whom appeared that of Henry Pembei ton, cadet, &c and as a farther proof, had any been wanting, a packet containing his few valu¬ ables, and а journal, which perfectly ex¬ plained why he bad sought the protection of lord Walbngford, and whith ivas brought down to the day he was taken ill, was for¬ warded to his friend Selby, with instruc-
tions to send the whole to sir Herbert Oorlevdle George Selby was not surprised to leam his friend had gone to India, but most sincerely did he gneve to leam, from the few lines addressed to himself officially, if it might be so termed, that Henry was no more With his fathers full consent, be set off immediately tor Channg, and having first proceeded to Elm Grove, he requested the doctoi to convey the packet, and the melancholy tidnigs addressed to himself, to sn- Herbert Dr Maigram readily came into his plans, and cert unly succeeded in preparing the baronet for the shock he received, when informed that his protegé bad preceded lum to tbe giave His journal was such an exact transcript of bis feelings, and so satisfactorily accounted for bis sudden de partire from Chiring, that the baronet could ouly grieve he had ever fallen into his fathers tods, though his having done so half reconciled him to his demise Lady Charleville was perfectly resigned, and agreed that be might have been spared
many sorrows, and was now, she hoped, reaping the reward of his many virtues, and perhaps she felt the more reconciled, from suspecting that his deatii would de¬ range many of his father's plans Nor was she mistaken, as the earl was both grieved, surprised, and wofully disappointed, when he learnt the cadet was no more, since he might always have held him out ra tet ro- rem to lady CbarleviHe, should slıe be left a widow, and might have made lus own terms w ıth eithei her or his son Upon reflection, he became moie reconciled, lie was now effectually removed, and without any odium attaching to himself, smce Mrs Molesworth would testify how strongly he had recommended him to her late husband, who had, when dying, entrusted the money he had received from the earl to general Momingthorpe, who had, m consequence of the cadet's demise, remitted it to the proper people, to be restored to bis lord¬ ship this must tell in his favour, and he might now make a merit of letting sir Herbert and lady Charleville know how amply he had provided for his son
In consequence of this idea he again ad¬ dressed the baronet, artfully glossing over his late malicious attacks upon lady Char¬ leville, by acknowledging that he had been grossly deceived bj people, doubtless in the pay of bis wife, respecting her sup¬ posed levity, &c nay it had been told him, knowing his relationship to sir Herbert, that the lady who bore his naine w as not his wife, wbich, added to the baronets evident wish to shun him, had led to his addressing hnn ш such tinautlioi ¡zed terms of reprobation respecting lady Charleville He next proceeded to declare that he had never doubted the tale of bis son's death, till chance threi, lum in his way as hewas accidentally riding through Channg, when he was struck with a stone aimed at Henry Pembroke, and had thus been led to con¬ sider hım veiy attentively, when be strong¬ ly reminded lum of his beautiful mother, which Jed to his seeking an opportunity to address him, till, by degrees, their mere casual acquaintance npened mto intimacy, and he thus discovered that he supposed himself an orphan, a ward of the baronet
He appeared, from the first to suspect that he was purposely kept in the dark respect¬ ing Ins origin, and seemed untosy and dis¬ contented, so much so, that ns soon as he (the earl) was convinced he was Ins son (which his account of bis early life placed beyond а doubt, and which e sight of his mother further confirmed), be offered to remove him from Charing, representing himself as the fnend of his fatlier, and really thought he bad been doing both sir Herbert, lady Charleville, and his son a favour, when be sent the latter out a cadet to India, in consequence of his having thrown himself upon his protection, ow¬ ing, as he understood, to a violent quarrel having taken place between Inm and the baronet, whose answer to his certainly m temperate and imprudent disclosure ot many past e\ ents had convinced lum that he had merely made himself very officious, and been as much misled by bis son s re presentations as he had before suffered himself to be by lady Chaileville s ene¬ mies he had therefore become extremely с i
anxious to restore him to his mothers arms Unfortunately the ship had pro¬ ceeded too far on her voyage to admit of his recalling the s outh, who hád, by his desire, resumed his own name of Henry Pembertoni but he bad wntten by the first conveyance to Bengal, to request cap tain Molesworth would either bring the cadet home with hnn, or satisfactory and explanatory letters to sir Herbert arid lady Charleville, if he chose to remain abroad Unfortimately.nelther the captam.to whom he bad particularly recommended lum, nor his son, lived to reach Bengal having, with many others, fallen viotims to the disorder which had proved so fatal on board the Αβια he could therefore only lament hai mg ever encouraged the poor youth to leave England, though he had evinced his real regard for hnn, by the ample provi¬ sion he had made for his present and future wants Sir Herbert might easily convinte bimself of the truth of these assertions, by making the proper inquiries at the India House, or of Mrs. Molesworth, of Milton Terrace, Gravesend the widow of the late
commander of the Asia Hoping, there¬ fore, that be should stand acquitted of every evil intention, since precipitancy had been his sole error, he concluded his letter, to which, by return of post, he received the following answer — " MY LOSO, " Your explanations were render¬ ed unnecessary, by our having previously received a voluminous packet, consigned to us by the lamented deceased He consı dered you as α friend — I consider you as having been his evil genius I shall not endeavour to awaken your conscience— when she does rouse herself, you will be sufficiently to be pitied—so to business The money you sent Miss Barhaven for the use of her son, principal, interest, and compound interest, is now standing m the three per cent consols, in your name, the calculation has been nicely made, and will, I trust, prove accurate, since lady Charle¬ ville, but for her son, would never have retained the money, and now returns it with my full approbation I require no

More than five years now elapsed without any event oceurnng wortliy a place in our story Di Mai gram having found limi¬ seli unequal to undertaking any more pu- Jiils, had, at this penod, just dismissed his last but his excellent curate, who had marned Miss Andrews some years before, received two young gentlemen at the par¬ sonage, and bid fair even to rival the doc-
tor in the pulpit Mr Cummings had not been successful in his agricultural pursuits, indeed, so far from improving, he had, by his imprudent speculations, greatly dimi¬ nished his wife's income, and was now talking of selling the farm and sinking the money m an annuity for their joint lives, as a means of keeping up their respectabi¬ lity Tlie Hoskinses still grumbled on he had of late paid more frequent visits to the Charleville Arms, his home growing daily less pleasant, and she wearied all those she could prevail upon to listen to her with complaints ofher poverty, of her husbands neglect, and of the ennm she expenenced in being so much alone, hard¬ ly feeling grateful for tbe many favours she daily received from the baronet and bis lady, who ptovided her with coals, to whreh they added candies, vegetables, and many other comforts, Which were justly appre¬ ciated by some other inhabitants of cot¬ tages similar to her own, but she denved more mortification from reflecting upon the past, than advantage from her present -benefits The Medlicotts vrere become
more intimate at the Abbey, as they im¬ proved upon acquaintance, nnd now fre¬ quently enlivened the famdy-cirde, smce the brtrdnet, thougli in apparent good health, was imperceptibly breaking! and required all the care and attention of lady Cliarleville and her now lovely protegee to minister to his comforts and convenience. George Selby, who contmued a great favourite with Dr Margruni had often visited the Abbey, where be always met with a very cordial welcome, as the baro¬ net felt a mournful pleasure in talking with him of Henry Pembroke, who, be ofteti dedared, would have been a hero had he lived Selby merely understood that a relation of his father, who knew himself to be the heir to his property if he died under age, had contnved to fire his mmd with descriptions of India, till, led away by bis dazzling accounts, Henry had unwanly given mto his plans, and thus enriched his wdy adviser This statement was so near the truth, the baronet did not scniple to relate it to all those who felt any interest in eur hero's ftte
The lost time Selby visited Channg, he had been exceedingly struck with Anna Farnham, now in her seventeenth year, whose countenance, glowing with beauty, health, and animation, while grace and harmony seemed to pervade every move¬ ment of her fine easy figure, nevei appear¬ ed to greater advantage than while singing the most popular airs of the day to the harp Or the piano, to amuse the worthy baro¬ net Lady Charleville once the most ad mired singer in England, had been her sole instructress and as she had a fine and powerful voice, а good ear, and great taste, she now excelled in music she also drew from nature and having read history and studied botany with sir Herbert, who had formed her mmd and directed her taste in reading, she was much better infoimed than most girls of her age Nor had lady Charleville suffered her to neglect the use¬ ful among her acquirements she was her own dressmaker and milliner, and even equalled Mrs Pennell in making pastry, &c The same sweet disposition and the same gaiety which had made her so many
friends in childhood, rendered her still the most unassuming and the most cheerful companion, and she felt all bei desires bounded, her wisbts gratified, und her happiness complete, in the society of а woman whom she equally admired, loved, and respected, md m the truly paternii regud of sn Hei bert whose veıy superior att ıınments she fully appreciated content was therefore the inmate ol her bosom, he uth bloomed m her cheeks and virtue ¿uiiled her at tions Selby therefore saw and admired looked and gazed, till he was half in love, before be was aware of lus dangei, as they frequently talked of Henry Pembroke, of whom Anna retained the most perfect recollection, often recurring to their fiist meeting, and, not unfrequent. ly with tears to then last inten lew fhe trifles be had given her she considered of inestimable value, as they ever reminded bei of lum to whom she was mdebted foi the protection of sir Herbert and his lady Selby was astonished at the pertinacity of her memory respecting his lamented friend she gave lum, at his request a
sketch of him in crai ons leaning over his once-fuvounte horse, w bo was now allow¬ ed the range ot the park in summer and a warm shelter in winter, out of regard to his master He shewed the drawing to bis fittticr (who was looking forward with very reasonable hopes to the wools ick) when he returned to town, and did not fail to speak m very wnrm terms of admi¬ ration of Anna her talents were almost miraculous, and her fi B ure be deemed per¬ fection The counsellor took the alarm, but pru¬ dently concealing his suspicions, merely observed that the young woman had been extremely fortunate in having excited the notice of Pembroke, since having been turned adnft by the drunken carpenter had led to her being thus educated and encouraged He hoped sir Herbert would make a decent provision for her, else she must exert her talents for the benefit of youth She might, to be sure, marry, yet what man of family, fortune, or good con- nexions, could present such a mere beggar girl, and of such doubtful ongin, to his re-
lativcs ? and he feared she would not in¬ cline to match with her equals Гог lus own part he conceived she would be much happier were she to continue at the Abbey and to > emani single, smce neither her beauty, of which he made no doubt, nor her iccomphsbments, which might be equally rire, would induce the world to overlook the obscurity of her origin '1 hese lunts had the desired eflect, since they induced Selby to resolve not to re visit Charing till he could consider Anna Farnhttin with as much indifference as he did the Miss Margrams whom he merely thought fine lively girls, who were agree¬ able partners m a ball room, and pleasant companions to their fathers visitors, but who possessed neither sufhcient beauty nor any talents likely to render them the he¬ roines of a ıomance they were extremely intimate with Anna Farnham, whose ac¬ knowledged infenonty prevented their feeling jealous of her very supenor ac¬ quirements, which she contnved to render either amusing or beneficial to all her ac¬ quaintance, she was therefore the Miss
Maigrams' oracle m point of dress, often assisting at their toilets upon grand occa sions, and displaying her ingenuity as а milliner for their advantage Nor w ıs she less sought after by Mrs Cummings, who still w ished to appear the belle of Charing but as Anna had no talents for дик mg, their taste in dress did not exactly agree she wished to banish flowers, featheis, pink, and every youthful elegance from her maturer fnend s toilet, who tenaciously clung to the attire of her j ounger da) s still, thanks to her young fnend, sbe some times mad» a respectable appearance, and was taught by her juvenile adviser many little works to beguile the tedium of her lonely hours, as she seldom saw Mi Cum mmgs, except at meals To Mrs Hoskms Anna often made useful presents, and w as ever ready to assist her m new modelling her now scanty wardrobe, which so won upon the heart of this discontented wo man, that sbe had been known to regiet to Mrs Nelson, that so handy a girl should be a beggar Mrs Nelson felt assured Anna would
never want—indeed with her talents, she never could, md as she privately worked for every poor person m the v ulage, and knew the use anil ι ropertics of all the common herbs, she w as often ot great ser vice to the indigent, smce she not unfic quently prevented tlieir having ıecouıse to dangerous ι medu s, and was besides, being deputy almonei to sir Herbert, as generally respected as the benevolent wi¬ dow, nay peihaps, su lı ıs the charm of youth und beauty, she was more generally beloved With Mis Nelson she could fieely talk of Pembroke the good widow hoi Uy felt satisfied with the tale respect¬ ing bis deatli—not th it she doubted the fact, but she had been surprised at the for¬ titude of sir Herbert anil lady Chaileville, who h id pieviously appeared baldly able to survive the loss o/ then taiountc, often relating to the attentive Anna the gipsey adventure, and othei proofs of then regaid toi their ward, and tben—as she did not scruple to tell hei present favourite—and tben to duve hım in a manner from Cha¬ nng, because sir Herbert supposed he had
broken his own horses knees was wonder ful —she could not fithom the mystery, and much as she respected the baronet and his lady, she could not approve of their conduct to a youth upon whom they once haidly suffered the wmd to blow Anna generally deft uded her patrons, alleging she understood Mr Pembroke had been deceived or misled by some rela tion who was bis heir and that, to this day, both sir Herbert and Ins lady eleeply regretted Ins death and could not, nt times bear tlie most distant allusion to his me mory at others they appeared to liave a mournful pleasure in recapitulating his early excellencies and ns a proof of his regard to the deceased, she really thought sir Herbert had never enjoyed the same health nor the same spirits since his ilepar ture Mrs Nelson acknowledged she had no right either to blame or condemn tbem— they knew best how far Mr Pemb-okc had erred but while admitting these pal hatives for their conduct, she generally con eluded with—it was altogether a strange
business so least said was soonest mended, and certuinly, could Anna Farnham have allowed herself to even suppose her bene¬ factors could do wrong, she would have been an absolute ι ouvert to tirs Nelsons vvay of thinking but she had seen and witnessed the silent anguish of lady Char leville if Pembroke was casually mention¬ ed, and had heard the deep sigh of the ba¬ ronet if he caught sight of bis horse she was therefore certain he was not forgotten and tliough sbe had never been able to dis¬ cover why so bttle respect appeared to have been paid his memory still she felt assured tint he lived in the hearts of tliosc she most loved, respected, md revered Nor was his memory less dear to the menials at the Abbey, who had each some trait of Ins wortii to record, or some pleasing anecdote torelate The maids w ho considered them selves indebted to him for their existence, always mentioned him mth tears of grati¬ tude two of them had marned from the Abbey, but they had never forgotten then- preserver Nor were the men less grateful fbr the lenity they then expenenced, ow-
ing to his representations Mrs Pennell carefully preserved a pocketboek, hm fair¬ ing that very year, and was never happier than when relating various incidents m which he was concerned sometimes per¬ mitting herself to wonder anything had occurred to render the dear young gentle¬ man desperate, which he must have been when he quitted Channg she blamed no one, but she must be permitted to say, it was strange—five years not having sufficed to banish him from the minds of his early friends, nor to reconcile them to his de¬ fease

A few months after Selby had so wisely resolved to keep out of the way of temp¬ tation, and to eat out his terms at the Temple, merely suffenng himself to anti¬ cipate the honours of tbe woolsatk as a ne¬ cessary prehmuiary to his marrying Anna
Farnham, sır Herbert Charleville w аз most agreeably surpnsed by а very unexpected visit from а very old friend, though а much younger man than himself He was read¬ ing a new and interesting work to lady Charleville and Anna, as they were sitting after breakfast, one fine summer morning, when colonel Fitzmaunee was announced " Fitzmaunee' eagerly repeated sir Herbert, " it must be my former friend and protegé, Edwin Fitzmaunee, whom you have so often heard me mention, Ellen—who I feared was no more, smce the accounts from India mentioned bis having been severely wounded m a ıecent engagement Shew him in immediately, I could not have had a more welcome guest ' The entrance of the stranger, who was а fine-looking man, not more than forty, but who appeared to have seen hard service, having lost his left arm, and a large patch over his left eye, of which he had lost the sight, did not improvp nis very sallow countenance Sir Herbert made a sort of VOL III D
retrograde movement, os' if disappointed iti his expectations Lady Charleville and Anna, who were standing, supposed this was not the gentleman he expected, till the colonel ciied out, in a gay tone—" I pereen e I am чо mueh embellished sirice we parted, you do not recollect me, sn Herbert " My dear Edwin,' rejoined the baronet, rushing forward, " though I re illy did not know you I cannot be mistaken in the voice ' " No, my teeth are still stitiomn so that remains tbe same " Yon certainly left me, about ten years ago, sound w ind and limb " I am now rather the worse foi weir and tear, but heart w lióle md is grateful foi past favours and as much your fi iend is ever " And I trust, my dear Fdwm y oii will find that my heai t still retains all its edrlj affections but my bist surprise was very naturi], since the accounts from India led mc to fear you were no more " I am ot the feline species therefore a

with this exception—I have no orders to draw attention towards my mutilated frame; but, such as I am, it shall be my endeavour not to disgrace my old friend's recommen¬ dation." " Your misfortunes do not seem to have depressed your spirits," replied the baro¬ net ; " so tell us when you came to Eng¬ land, and where you reside." " All in good time," inteirupted the co¬ lonel ; " first introduce me to that young lady, who may ere this have recovered from the shock my appearance probably occasioned her, as I arn still un beau gar- ton*, and I have heard of ladies who have not been scrupulous about eyes and arms; in fuct, I sliould prove such an excellent foil to a beuutiful woman, that it would be to the interest of any belle to accept my hand." Sir Herbert called Anna fonvard, who had retreated during lady Chorleville's in¬ troduction, and presented her to his friend, as bis adopted daughter and cherished pro¬ tegee. Tbe colonel, who had now а . full
view of her features, gave an involuntary start, exdaiming—" Has this young lady never reminded jou of Annabella Hert lord, baronet'" ' Your remark has led to my perceiving the resemblance, which I have nevei before noticed, as this dear girl bus grown up un der my yes, and in childhood it was less perceivable But, not to revert to melan¬ choly r< minisccnces, tell us bow you escaped death, f, as report led me to believe, you were mortally wounded' I have lived so many years in almost bennitic retirement, that I am very little au fait of what is passing in England, much less what is passing in Indostan, and I could not ad¬ dress the directors merely to inquire whe tber y ou were no more ' " Like me, you prefer remaining m doubt respecting misfortunes for which tiiere ıs no remedy I was certainly des- jierately, though not mortally wounded in the engagement of which you read the details, and have survived to be my own historian, thanks to one of the finest young fellows and one of the best soldiers in tbe

overt act of disobedience Edwm was not, however, suffered long to enioy this short dream of felicity, as tbe lovely Annabella died in childbirth of a daughter before the expiration of a fortnight, and for a time I feared he would not have survived his loss fortunately a war broke out between our people and the restless Mahrattas, which culled hım into actual service, he was pro¬ moted to the nnk of captain, and his mi btary ardour restored his reason, and ulti mately proved of the greatest benefit to his constitution " Before he took leave of me, he settled all Ins worldly concerns and I had pro mised to take charge of the infant, who was placed at nurse with the wife of а non¬ commissioned officer Should he fall, I was to watch over the babes interest, and to make her existence known or not, as my judgment might direct, to sir Charles Fitzmaunee Ί he war did not prove of long duration but thange of scenp, con tinual occupation, and his natural spirits, had rendered Edwm himseli again ere he returned to me, though the sight of his
daughter, а fine child, then in her second year, put his newly recovered fortitude to the tnal but he endeavoured to shake off unpleasant recollections, and to the w orld appeared the some gay lively rattle he had ever done I alone read his heart, and I knew lice s ce» s г lee li 1 cl 1 re ll I gl or »I e I n В 1 ye c n I I ! I o π I theiefore as а means of weaning his mmd from the memoiy of his departed wife strongly advised his sending the child to 1 ugland as a very fair opportunity soon offered the widow of an infenor officer who had been killed m the late war meant to return home by one of the hrst ships and had undertaken the charge of a boy about four years of age, the son of her late husband s colonel, whom she was to deb ver mto tbe care ot bis grandfather I had seen Mrs Winter some few times, and had thought her much the gentlew oman, and, to appear nice, lier manneis and accom plishments w ere much supenor to her si tuation m life I therefore seriously urged
L ltzmaunce to place his daughter under ber care, recommending her being placed at an airy preparatory school when she reached England or, as Mrs Winter bore a most exiellent character, it was finally decided she might remain under her care till she was five years old " Edwin was liberal m his arrangements foi the child s passage, and placed wbat I thought much too large a sum of money m this persons bands to provide for the infants future wants When I remon strated with bun upon what I called his extravagance, he told me he did not wish to be called upon for seven years, and be had given Mrs Winter proper instructions to place tbe pnncipal in the funds, as the interest would be more than sufficient for the child s expences, as she grew up, he should make other arrangements— thisť? ifte would be a sort of nest egg tow ards ber fu ture provision, and lie maintained he had taken c -ry prudent precaution, and hud happily steered between profusion and the reverse He was stdl very young, very sanguine, and, wbere his child was con
cerned, very unpersuadable; therefore I Buffered him to make his own arrange¬ ments, thinking he would be mone in¬ clined to follow my ι advice at α future period. " Sir Charles generally wrote him once or twice a L yenr, and seemed much more reconciled to what he termed his freaks and tollies,'since they, or his merit, had led him-into bhe road to prefennent; but he never sent liitn any money, wishing, he wrote, to render liim prudent and atten¬ tive to the main chance; and as he· made Sueli a handsome provision for him in bis will, I am inclined to believe bis assertions. "In due com se Edwin received intelli¬ gence of the 'Siife arrival. of his child in England, in a very satisfactory well-written letter from Mrs. Winter; and he felt per fectly reconciled to her 'absence, when, on the · retimi of' the ship to India in wbicb she had sailed, one of' the petty officers sought him, ant,> to relate the melancholy intelligence of the child's death, who liad nob long'survived 'Mis. Winter, to wbom his'-wife iwas'ivery ineatly related, and to
whom she had intrusted the baby upon her deathbed The little girl had died of water in the bead, neither he nor his wife had spared any expence to save her, as they hod had daily consultations of all the first physicians in London, and had finally buned her as became the daughter of cap tarn Fitzmaunee, producing a long account for boaid, lodging medical advice, nurses, apothecaries' bills, and finally, a very long one from a London undertaker, amounting in the whole to a very considerable sum " Having rather recovered from the shock the account of his child's death had given him, our fnend examined the bills, and then said—' I cannot blame your ex travagance, as there is still a balance due to me, and you were perfectly nght in sparing no expence to save the child '— ' A balance due to you, captain ' ened the fellow —' w here was it to come from ?— Mrs Winter, who was as extravagant a jade as ever broke bread, died in debt—we were obliged to bury her by stealth, and we should not have taken charge or care of the chdd, if I had not known whose it

worthy steward was punctual to his ap¬ pointment, and having paid Ins compii ments to the ladies, sat down to his meal, which he hardly allowed himself to begin ere he told the baronet—" The Grange farm is actually for sale sir Herbert, Mr Cummings called upon me yesterday, that I might give you the refusal, should j on be inclined to purchase The estate lies in a ring fence, and he has expended some money upon the house If he does not speedily dispose of it by private contract, he means to put it up to auction " And what is to become of his wietch¬ ed dupe of a wife ? asked the baronet " Her trustees have agreed to sink the money in an annuity for their joint lives he does not make both ends meet at farm ing, and the land is running out '1 here are a hundred and ten acres, more or less some fine timber, and it is all freehold nor do I thmk him unreasonable in his demands " Then close the bargain immediately, Andrews, since, if it does not suit or please colonel Fitzmaunee, I can annex it to my ĽS
Own estate ; but, by your account, it will be the very thing for him, and he may alter, amend, and improve at leisure. I am going to fetch him from Southampton; be can look over the grounds and see the house ; should he like the situation, the business may be settled immediately. I am really anxious to fix such a long-tried friend in the neighbourhood." Mr. Andrews promised to give the ba¬ ronet and the colonel the meeting at tbe Grange, where he was to receive bis final instructions, and now departed, to rejoice Cummings witb the news of sir Herbert having agreed to become the purchaser at his own price.
CHAPTER ΥΠ.
At tbe appointed time sir Herbert drove to Southampton, and found the colonel anxiously expecting him at the principal iun. —'' Where is Mr. Saville ?" (the Win-
ehester gentleman) inquired the baronet, tinding his friend alone " I foresaw that I sliould be turned idnft, ıeplıed the colonel, " so I prudunj- ly sccuıed betler qu irt«» yesterday 1 he 1 ict is, Saville ıı as summoned express last iu B ht to attend the deathbed oi his fathei, at İus seit m the north, and I desnej lııın to take bis goodwife with hmi, knoumg you would gne me house mom for the piesent, so when he returned toWmehc tor, lie -cut my sen ant and my buggi^e here, and I shall older both to the Abbey " You cannot oblige me more, and tliough I grieve foi tlie cuuse of Mr Sa villes absence, I cannot ι egret it, so let us return to Channg, as I have made » pinchase there this morning, winch, for a proportionate adv nice of price, I will trans fcr to y ou, as you will soon increase y om income by farming " No doubt But is tiiere a habitable house upon tins said farm ?

" Which will be fihe amusement, so tell me how are the ladies?" " Very well, and very anxious to be better acquainted with you " " You have been a good puffer, though I agree my countenance is an excellent recommendation Is Miss Farnham any relation?—She is a beautiful girl, ami, what I most admire, modest but not bash tul' Sır Herbert briefly related when and how she had f tlien under their protection, dwelling very slightly upon Mrs Bnck¬ land s tale, merely observ ing —" She was doubtless а natural child, whose parents hid availed themselves of the sei oolmis- tresss death to throw her upon the mercy ol stiangers " Her little romance has terminated vi ry fortunately Her knight enant was the у outli you sent out to India, I sup¬ pose, as jou saj he died on boaid the Asia' " He did, but thereunto bangs a tale w hich I do not feel myself at liberty to reveal, and maj I also request J ou will

marry the beggai's brat at the Abbev, wbo must not be too nuœ —she had only to look to the main chance Mrs Nelson soon made herself an interest in his regard, she had been indefatigable while her men w ere in Ins employ, and actually sat up with him two nights when he was confined by a fever and sore throat, and had forbidden the visits of the Charleville familj At the expiration of the seeond jcar, he declared he bad never spent bis time so pleasantly as since his resilience at Cha¬ nng, though he saw veiy little company, and spent some hours each day at» the Abbev reeling v ery anxious to contri¬ bute to sir Herbert s amusement, be had twice visited London, and had once ac¬ companied bis titled brotliei to his seat in Lincolnshire, but w ıs so surfeited with kindness, be told sir Herbert, he w ıs obliged to shorten his staj , that be might not forfeit the good opinion of his dear relatives, teDnig the baronet in confidence, tint he did not like to give them false hopes, as he bad fin illy detenmned to Ľ3

dissipated, more averse to senous reflec¬ tion, nay, and moi e self willed, than Edwin Fitzmaunee » whom I now beheve to be one of the bravest officers and most honest men in the Company s service * My recollections of that same giddy Edwm render me very indulgent towards Percival, who is in very high favour with the Company, soicly upon the score of his own ment and supenor mihtary talents He is promoted to the rank of major, antl will bc a general ere he is forty Should he be his uncle s heir, he will be almost too rich for comfort, sinee I suspect Mormng¬ thorpe is bona fide a nabob, but the most kmd 1 earted unassuming being in exist ence his nephew is his counterpart " I make no doubt he deserves all your praises but should he inherit his unde s property you do not mean to add jour diop to the ocean f " No, if I survive the general I shall be guided by tlie disposition he makes of his property, but sliould I go first, Harry Percival ıs my hen· ' Sir Herbert did not pursue the subject,.
thinking it would be needless to renew it while the genend lived when he died, he might adduce otlier arguments m behali of lus friend s relatives, whom he deferred inviting mto Hampshire till his improve¬ ments were completed, as he wished them, he told them, to see his farm to the great¬ est advantage, and they had the policy not to force themselves upon him The road betw een the Grange and the Abbey had been rendered extiemely good, either for driving, riding, 01 walking at first the colonel only kept a gig and a pan of saddle borses Was not he a faimei g then he w as \ ery luxurious, he maintained, if rallied upon bis dislike of shew But one daj , when driving his gig to the Ab¬ bey, he was met by some tarmu s loaeled waggons, which from not, as be contciv td, sufficiently breaking the load, caught one of his wheels so fast that tbey diagged linn some yards back before tbe waggoner could stop his hoi ses On his arrival at sn Hei¬ bert s, be related what had occimed, and declared lus intention of punishing tbe

considerable stockholder, and had a friend whom lie w ished to serve, be chose to ex eit ill his own and sir Herberts interest in Ins behalf and having succeeded to his utmost wishes he returned into Hamp slure in α very elegant post chariot, in which he stopped at the Abbey before he went home, declaring that be had made the purchase solely to gratify lady Charle niles wishes, who he saw was ashamed of acknowledging а mere gig acquaintance Having related his friends success and told the baronet he had been advised to become a candidate for the same honours, whieh he had modestly declined, he thus proceeded —"I have had a long letter from Fherton who is in a veiy declining way and seems anxious to retuin home He Ins not been very successful I am very willing to exert my interest m Ins behalf, but we never did nor ever shall assnmlite " Why, your marrying tn о sisters w as no proof of the similarity of your disposi tions, rejoined the baronet Theie now you have divulged my

in this hazardous trade, tbe small sum 1 had reserved excepted, whicli I was moie than evei bent upon concealing, expecting we should soon be reduced to absolute po¬ verty, as he would not hear of my takın * a school, nor of my entering into any line of business Since he ЬаД barely sufhcient to set bim a going, I was to make myselt useful by disposing of what he brought over but my talents in this line were nt ver exerted, since, during his first voj age to Dunkirk, he \\ as met at sea by α reve¬ nue cutter, and though his boat was to have outsailed eveiy thing, owing to there bcmg too much or too Uttle wmd, they were overtaken and commanded to bnng to Rendered desperate, as then property and liberty were at stake, they refused to surrender an engagement ensued, during whicli several lives vi ere lost on both sides when my wretched husband having been killed, the rest were obliged to ask for quarter, three of whom were afterwards banged Thus was I released from my matrimonial fetters, and fortunate it w ıs that I had made a resene, with which,

wonderful discovery w Inch bad taken placc to the household while tbe colonel and his lovely daughter again received the con¬ gratulations of their kind friends, and again did the colonel hear repeated how his An¬ nabella had been thrown upon their- mercy, he only w ished Henry Pembioke had lived to share in their joy, and be now traced а great likeness to his wife in Ins daughter s (ountenancc, who related all she lemem¬ bered of Mrs Smith, who, she still mam- lamed, had cv er treated her with the great est kindness The evening soon passed aw ay in these now pleasing recapitulations, and never had eithei the colonel 01 bis daughter re¬ turned thanks to their Maker with moi o heartfelt gratitude than when they retired on tin«, to tbem, memoiable night
CHAPTER X
The next morning the colonel, who had slept at the Abbey, declared he felt ten years the younger for tlus very fortunate and very unexpected discovery, adding— " And I am not sorry this renovation of youth and spirits succeeded instead of pre¬ ceding this happy event, since, being more than half in love with the young gipsey, who knows into what errors the blind god and my vanity might have led me ' and, after all, what claim have I either to her affection or regard, m companson to you, my dear baronet, and you, my best lady Charleville, who have so kindly supplied the place of both her parents? How shall I ever convince you how deeply I feel your kindness, as I shall not affront you, sir Herbert, by offering to repay you one farthing of the money you have expended upon our daughter? Henceforth I stand
bound to maintain her, so you must decide whether she continues your inmate, or is to âo the honours of my cottage " " I cannot resolve to part with her yet," hastily resumed the baronet—" her society is almost become necessary to my existence She cannot yet take upon herself the charge of your house, and you can see her every day and every horn ' " Me depnve you of such a solace, ba¬ ronet'—not I, truly, nay, I feel proud of у ош reluctance to part with the dear girl. But you must spare her to me now and then ; I shall require no more " The truly grateful Anno, m a warm and animated speech, now recapitulated the obligations she was under to both the ba¬ ronet and lady Charleville, acknowledging that she should severely feel being removed from their protection " Had you been less grateful, you little witch, I ehould «ot have loved you half so well Continue te Aeserve tiie regard of your generous benefactors, and you will render youiodi stall more dear to «ne,' ten¬ derly embracing her, while tears of rapture
bespoke the feelings of his heart. " Now it is settled that you remain a fixture here, it may next be necessary to consult whe¬ ther Briçkbmd's evidence and Mary Win¬ ter Smith's confession will suffice tp esta¬ blish your identity. My brotber-in-lawy Elverton, gave me your mother—I must write to bim for the necessary certificates; general Morningthorpe also knew of my marriage; so did you, baronet; but your evidence miglit be deemed partial, and Γ know my kind relatives will expect chap¬ ter and verse, and the strongest proofs, ere they admit my Annabella's legitimacy. Hy the way, I wonder whether sir Charles will hear of tbe discovej-y wliich has taken place before he comes down?" " I sliould not suppose he couldv (¡bough it is doubtless already the news of' Cha¬ ring," replied sir Herbert. " Trou must letain Blickland in your bouse; the man may be led to improve his habits. He is certainly a material evidence, should any doubts arise; and you will do well to write to Mr. Elverton and to general Morning¬ thorpe."
" I mean to do so I have heard jon mention α young man of the nune of Sclby, as a shrew d, intelligent, and honest lawj er , you shall gii e me a letter to him, sir Herbert, as to morrow monung I shall start for London, since I do not hke to lose a moment m α mattéi of such impor¬ tance ' " You cannot apply to a more likely person to advnse you how to proceed Sel¬ by's fither is now· a judge, and j on will have the benefit of Ins opinion as w ell as his son's ' " Then I will start m the mail this 11 en¬ ing, spenel two daj s in town, and return m the d i)-coach to Southampton on Satur¬ day I sliall not feel comfortable till 1 have caneehYd my present к ill, and made an¬ other, so I will nde home to impart the late events to mj household, and give or¬ ders previous to my departure I shall re¬ turn to dinner ' Sir Herbert agi eed he was right m using dispatch The colonel therefore mounted his horse, desiring Brickland to follow him home, 1еалищ Ins daughter to rejoice at
having every mj steıy respecting her on¬ gin thus satisfactorily de ircd up Bnckland s having acknowledged who she was, with many exaggerations, had already reached Clnung Dr and Mrs Mai gram had received un invitation to dme nt the Abbey, and a summary ac count of what had occurred, the Medli cotts had been equally f ıı oured the Cum mingses thought it veiy strange the Hos¬ kinses, as usual, were the lenst rejoiced, and where they dared, declared they thought the w hole story а fabneatıon, and that tue girl was the baronets daughter, whom the colonel had either chosen to fathei, or been deceived into believing his own Mrs Nelson hastened to the Abbey to offer hei sincere congratulations to the whole party, and when the colonel re¬ turned tiiere, he desired her to distribute twenty pounds among the poorer class, that their hearts might beat in unison w ıth bis own, he was therefoie both cheered and congratulated by all the poorer mha bitants, as he drove through the village tint evening, in his way to Southampton,
much to the annoyance of the discontented Hoskinses, who repined at the good for¬ tune of any one they considered their su¬ perior, and who envied the industrious poor who partook of the colonel s bounty No accident having occurred upon the road, colonel Fitzmaurice was set down at the White Horse Cellar, Ficcadill), by seven the next morning, when, havını, dressed and breakfasted, be piocecded to George Selb) s, who had diambus in Kings Bendi walk, Temple, since, in con¬ sequence of lus fither s promotion, he had obtained α deputy s situation m the same court, whicli had tluown him into а great deal of business, more as a sobcitor tlian a counst 1, and which he found so lu- uativeas well as honouiable, that he no longei w ished to exert himself as an ora¬ tor, not having been fai oured with Ins fa¬ ther» eloquence Colonel ritzmaunce, the most intimate fnend of sir Herbert Char leville, was received Λνιιΐι due lespeet, and our young lawyer listened with the most gratify nig attention to his account of the restoration of his daughter, which led to
lus dwelling with be arttelt regret upon the early eleath of liei bist protector, whom he desenbed m tlie most Iavourable co lours to the no less attentive colonel, who ouly wished he had been spared to see her restored to her natui d piotector, and w ho now leamt the degree of mystery which had att idled to tins mudi regi etted youth, since he had ofttn heaiil hnn casu illv men tioned at Channg and aln lys with praise 1 he colonel next discussed the proofs of bis daughtei s birth helby thought them very satisfactoiy —Brickland s es ldence was m itself a host foi safety he mieht repeat his account upon oath beiore а magistrate, m the event ot bis death, this would be making eveiy thing secure It would also be very proper to write to India foi the certificates—in ease of disputts tliey would be required general Morningthorpe could only give cucumstantial evidence, which would not be required but upon the facts already ascertained, Stlby was convinteci that any will tbe colonel might make in favour of his dauglitei must be deemed ι ıhıl She w as almost ol age still, it
might bc necessary to nominate other ex editors For gre iter satisfaction he would state the circumstances to lus f ¡ithei, w ho would point out any errors ni lus conilii- чоп', promising to dine with the colonel the next day, at the hotel wheie be had taken up bis abode, when be w ould bring hnn his fathers opinion nnd the will, for which he now received instructions, w Inch be might wish to shew sir Heibert Char¬ leville before he signed it The colonel was much pleased with the joung lawyers unassuming manneis, and fully convinced that he possessed gieat legal knowledge, therefore, m eonsequence of his advice, he wrote a long e\pl inatory letter to Ins biother in law, Elverton, point¬ ing out what documents he required, which he lequested might be forwarded by the first ship which sailed after tbe receipt of his letter He also wrote at gieat length to general Momingthorpe, dwelling with heartfelt gratitude upon his obligations to his nephew, who had preserved his life for the benefit of Ins daughter, whose claims
ι ould neier luve been satisfactorily siili- bt.mtntcil had he died in battle The nc\t morning he canted Ins letteis biniseli lo the India House, wheie, to bis infinite ıclıtt, he leunt that general Moi- ningthoipe had depirltd this hie for a bet¬ ter, and tliat his nephew, whom he had constituted lus hen, and who hail, in com¬ pii mee with lus will, assumed his name and nuns, was now, it was supposed, on bis passige to England, with the regiment of the line mto whidi ht had exchanged from the Compiny s sci ι ice, bun;, inxious to earn α few moie lauids in Europe, since, as it was supposed he was now one of the nebest commoncis m the Bntish domi nions, be could luvt no reason for conti¬ nuing in the East The colontl prt sumed liehad no intention of returning abroad, since, being thus amply provided foi, he ought to take his health into consideration, which was not likely to improve m an eastein cimiate, though he might be rathei seasoned to it, but having requested to be infoi med when be amved in England, om colonel returned to Ins hotel to give Selby
the meeting, who was punctual to the mi¬ nute of his appointment, and v» ho brought the colontl his father s opinion m writing, wlueh exattly coincided with his own 'Ihe w ill was exactly what Ins client could have wished, and to make all sure, he ie solved to execute it that night, Mi bilby would be the puncipal witness, he might send for Ins clerks to put the mushing- stroke, and thty might make a copy, w Inch he could also sign, and leave m his hands Having dined, and put the fiiiisluiig- stroke to all business, the colonel lepeated what he hid leaint it the Ini'ii House, telling Selby how greatly lit w ıs indebted to muir Moniingthoipr, whom he Rally longed to see again, though he thought it veiy piobable tbey should not know each other weie tbey to mett accidentally, as he was a mere youth when be saved bis lift, and the ma]or bad never sten hım since be had recoveicd of the wounds winch had certainly iather alteied the chai aeter of his countenance Selby had nev er spent a pleasantcr ev en ing and upon tbe colonel wishing lum to

that Pembroke's nearest paternal rel ition had removed him from Charing—who that was, has ncvei transpired, 1 only know that the supposed illegitimacy ot Ins birth rendered poor Harry very miserable — Well, ' / shall nevci look upon his like again! and I dare believe Miss Titzmau rice still retains a most grateful recollection of hun " " I am sure sbe does, was the reply but as they weie to rise at an early hour, they did not sit late, and at the appointed time tbey took their seats in the coach, and were soon upon the road to South ampton
CHAPTĽR КГ
A DLCi NT woman of the second order, and a well-dressed man, between thirty and forty, were their travelling compa¬ nions , the fineness of the day and beauty of the villas near London furnished tbem
with subjects for conversation, till tbey stopped to change horses at Hounslow Seieial people were standing before the mn, some lauglung, others talking loud enough to enable the colonel to catch a [ew words, which led to his putting some questions to the speakeis, who readily told the party in the coach, that а gentleman and lady, who had slept there the over¬ night, bad st irtcd at sunrise in then own gig for Southampton, they undeistood, and soon aftei their departure, two gentle¬ men had amved in a chaise and-four, who h id made such minute inquines respecting this couple, and seemed to be so w ell con- v meed that they were the people they were in pursuit of, that they had followed them to Hartford Bridge, and from what they could undeistand, the one was the husband and the otlier was the brothei of the lady, who had, it should appeal, eloped with some favoured lover " Ihey will never come up with them,' said an hostler—" I dare say they were no more gomg to Southampton than I am " And if they are, said another by-
stander, turning to the colonel, " a j oung fanner m this neighbourliood, who was talking to a friend at this very gate, gal loped foiward '»efore the postchaise start ed, meaning to put the lovers upon thou· guard so I nm convinced then· pursuers will neither learn tale nor tidings of them " Some dopement in high hfe, observed the female passenger " and they aie so common tbey hardly suffice to hll α news paper This seems to have been very badly managed and the husband must bave been л ery anxious to proclaim his dishonour to make himself known The colonel agreed to the justice of the remark, and the coach proceeded on its journey " I should like to see lhe parties, said the third male passengei I dare say I know some of them " Indeed ' said Selby, w ıth an ıncredu lous look " but tins adventure remind» me of a ludicrous circumstance, of whicli I was a witness a few months back Chance led me into a pastrycook s shop in the city where I was eating a bun and drinking
some whey, when a short country looking man cime in, and after looking round him, inquired for Mr -------- (I am a lawyer, therefore am cautious howl mention names) A man who was st mding behind the co in ter, md who bad just poured me out some whey said—' That is my name, sir what do you please to w ant ' —' Your name, Mi WlnppcT snappei ' none of J our saucy jokes I desire you won t take me m w ıth \oiir cockney tucks—we Welcbmen aie not so easily duped Though I never w as in I ondon befoie, I have seen my son in¬ law in Wnles, and be must be deucedly altered in tw o j ears if he beais any resem¬ blance to v on I never saw а finer stout fellow of Ins inches, so I do admire such ι little ugly, surly looking fellow as j ou hoping to deceive mi ' Why, Mr -------- st mils five foot nine and a half without bis shoes foi I measuied him nnd the mark is still to be seen at mj house at Kidw cllj " As the Welchman nthei addiessed himself to ine, perceiving I was an atten tue listeiiei to his remaiks, I agreed there ior ш n
seemed to be some mistake, hardly know¬ ing what to say, while the master of the shop, for such the little man really was, said he had no wish to impose upon lum, he must have mistaken the house, he would call Ins wife to settle all disputes, leaving us together, when the Welchman looking round him, said—' I am sure tlus is No — I certainly never was in town before, nor should I have been here now, if I had not been summoned as a witness upon an im¬ portant tual My daughter Winifred has lived in London from a girl, she was taken into lady Morgan s service at fourteen, and she married a Mr-------- , a pastrycook, about seven years ago, with whom she cime down m her own chaise two years since to Kidwelly, where she spent a fort¬ night, and I was quite taken with my son-m law, who invited me very kindly to ι ısıt hım m town, but I told hım I should never go so for from home, little expecting I should travel at free cost ' The retuin of tbe pastrycook prevented his proceeding ' My wife will be down in a minute, sbe is just putting on hei things I have
not told her who was below, thougli I sup¬ pose, from what you have said, sir, you suppose she is your daughter'—* Not if she is your wife, Mr Cnbbage-face ' " Wishing to see the denouement, I took a seat and a jelly, which I had scarce¬ ly done, when a very good looking well- dressed man w alked mto the shop, calling —' How are j on, James ' how is tbe wife' I have ----- 1 lit Welthma i, who had been stanng the new comei in the face, now extended his hand, exdaiming—' Why, you are the veil man I tame to visit How are you, mj 1 id ?—But none of j our tricks upon tiavellei s, if you please remember I am α Welchman " The stranger did not so immediately recollect the old gentleman, as he coloured, stammered, and at last declared he had the advantage of hnn He was still speaking, when a veiy smalt woman, putting her head w ithout the parlour door, asked— Who is it wonts me, James?'—' Why me, my dear Winny, ened the father, rush- n 3
mg forward ' You look brav cly but vve seem to be playing at cross purposes-»· that fellow behind the counter wants to make me believe he is your husband " Hogarth alone could have done justice to the countenances of three of the party, no one spoke, till the supposed son in law rallying his spirits, turned upon his heel, and left tbe shop, declanng be could not comprehend the old mans meaning — ' But I can, stammered the justly pro voked husband ' Two years ago 1 ist July, my wife went into Wales to see her pa¬ rents, she was gone a month and three diys she went by the Swansea mail, as she told me, and returned by the same convej ance, for I gave her the meeting at the inn But I will soon be at the bottom of this busmess " Mrs Winifred hardly suffered hun to eonclude, before she di igged him into the parlour by main force, calling to Molly to take his place in the shop Whether be was satisfied by the explanation she gnve him, I cannot take upon me to say, I left
the shop highly amused by the absurd qui pio quo" Colonel Fitľmaunce was no less dn ertoti by thi tale " Such scenes are not uncommon in high life, said the third gentleman ' I am in¬ timate with а nobleman who con assume anv character, or any disguise, to carry on m intiigue If I wtre to relate half the scrapes he has been m, j on w ould think I was romancing High or low, beauty is all he requires, ard he sticks at nothing to cairy bis point be has been twice cast in damages for cum con though no man bribes higher He is going out to Spam with his regiment, and there, I dai e saj, he will keep up the ball " I should hope he w ould be bettei em- jiloyed,' said the colonel " Oh, he is a very biave officer—I make no doubt of bis doing his duty, but if ho has any leisure, the pretty gnls will baie no peace "A bacheloi, of course? observed Selbv ' No, faith, sir, be is both a husband

fortunately tbey almost immediately be gan to ascend a very steep lull, and the colonel, by soothing the terrified animals, soon made them slacken their pace to α walk, when he desired the sailors to get down as quietly as possible, and to take different sides of the carnage, by which means they myht, whtn the) reached the summit, take hold of the hoists htads, and stop them till the coachman came up foi 1 ldding their attemptini, to meddle w ıth tnem while asteiiding the hilf, for feir they should increase their dangei by thenr rishness and want of skill ami as be h id addressed them with both kindness and good humour tbey strictly adhered to his directions and in about ten minutes the coachman cime up with them, dnprin^ wet and very dirty He gave the man who bad occasioned bis misfortune a veiy sivage look swearing he would give him α d ----- d good hiduig when be got to the end of his stage Juek abused hım m re turn, calling lum л dumsy landlubber— tliough, if the rain did but continue at the same rate, ш another hour he would be

" Now have not I made a very hand¬ some apology, sir," cried Jack, turning to the colonel and Selby, who were standing by him, " admitting I did carry the joke too far?" " A man can only say he is sorry for what he has done," replied the colonel; " so come, coachman, do not bear malice, since, if the poor fellow was rather heed¬ less, he had no wish to endanger your safety." " No, upon my soul, I would not wil¬ fully hurt a hair of your head," rejoined the sailor. " I was to blame, I agree ; so now take tbe glass, or let us strip, and fight it out, no matter which—only take your choice. I have said more in excuse to you than I ever did to any man since I could box the compass, because I know I was in the wrong." " I bave another stage to drive, so I cannot fight," replied the coachman ; " but as I can drink, here goes, and here's my hand;" and thus tliis practical sea-joke aided, much to the satisfaction of all pre¬ sent.
Jack, who bad been considcnng the co- lonel, who wore a bine frock, asked— " Have we ever sailed together, mess¬ mate?' " Never, to mj knowledge " " Yet you seem to have seen service, and so have I, but I have been more for¬ tunate, thougli I ain no timelier' " I w as in the anny,' said the colonel " You would have done credit to our service, as I am sure J ou are staunch to the backbone, or you yiould not have been so disfigured you пел er tuined your back upon the enemy " The passengers being requested to re. sume their seats, the conversation dropped, and the lady, as shp bad continually dui- mg the last eight miles, a^ain reverted to then narrow escipe " Were you at tbe Heldei business ? ' asked the valet " No, I did not ıeceıve my wounds m Kurope ' " Oh, you were with Abercrombie in Egypt'—Well, I have no ambition to be¬ come a hero, and, m fact, 'tis such as 11s

" We will tnke a chaise from hence,' •laid the colonel, addressing Selby —" it will be a saving of time We tan dme •/bile it is getting ready " Tins they did with the valet, who dc- ( lared he was very sorry they were going another way, but as they felt no regret at parting with lum, they were pleased to hnd themselves tête-a-tCte in a postchaise on the road to Channg, where the colonel was to set Selby down at Elm Grove, while he proceeded to the Abbey, whci e he made hnn promise to join them at supper

humble bow, as they passed him on their way home During dinner, our j oung lawyer, some thing apropos having led to the subject, mentioned his engagement entenng into α few details respecting the lady, and re eeived the congratulations of all present but felt mortified by perceiving Annu seemed the most gratified of tbe partj us she gaily reminded bun ot his promise to the Miss Margrams that they should dance at his wedding, which be could onlv pei form by bringing bis bride to Chinili} when she- would petition the colonel to give a ball, merely to redeem his word The colonel declared he was ready to enter into any engagement for such а ры pose and as he kept up the ball with his usual gaiety, all present were soiry when his carnage drew up to convey Sclby to Southampton, where he had engaged a seat m the mail and as the colonel bad not been home since Ins return from tow n, he left the Abbey with him, promising to ride ovei the next morning as soon ns he hod iei lus house in older VOI III ι
On lho Tuesday the colonel received n very long letter from his brother, to in form hnn they meant to reich Southamp ton by then usual ebimci hour on Tliurs d ıy requesting ıs he bad engaged а cook and housimnid with the bouse, tint be would gut the necessai) oidcis, and tint he would still fuither oblige tlicin by fa¬ vouring thtm with his company—peihaps be could give them the meeting at Win¬ chester, us lady Fit7m? u ice and his daugh¬ ters fully participated in bis impatience to see him Having skimmed over these effusions of fiaternal regard, our colonel hastened to the Abbey, where, putting the letter into Annas hands, be desired her to read it pio bono publico When she had contluded—" Now, ought not I to be very grateful foi such proofs of sir Charles s regard ?—By the way, we must not drop a lunt of my having been m Lon¬ don, as I did not leav e my name in Man¬ chester square ' " We will bo upon oui guard, ' replied sir Herbert, " he does not seem to have heard of the recent discovery '
" If he has, he is too politic to allude to the sub]ect, ns he will continue a sceptic till officially informed of bis niece s resto- ration to her family Suppose I give them the meeting at Winchester, and a dinner tiiere, and invite them to spend the next day at the Grange ? I feel convinced that thev will pal licipate m my /oy, and will be very anxious to be introduced to Anna, whom )ou must allow, lady Charleville, to do the honoms ofmy house to her aunt and cousins " Most assuredly, colonel and I highly approve ot youi going to Wmchestei, as Anna would feel very awkwaid were she presint during the necessary explanation which ought to precede her introduction to these relations I " Agreed—then /oy might overpower liei and I now know, by expenence, that excess of happiness is very nearly akin to excess of gnef But I must nde to South ampton, to give ordeis to h ive every thing in re idmess against sir Ch irles s arnval, as I wish them to feel comfortable, for though our reconciliation is deficient in the grand
ingredient to perfect esteem—real affec¬ tion, it is calculated to keep up that ne¬ cessary bond of society—harmony." Sir Herbert agreed with the remark, but ivould not suffer tlie colonel to depart till he had promised to return to dinner. " Why, as you have certainly а prior right to my daughter, it is but charity to indude me in your hospitality, though I feel so perfectly happy, and so satisfied with my lot, that I devote all my solitary moments to fomiing plans for the future benefit and welfare of my darling girl." " Who can never be sufficiently grate¬ ful for such continued marks of your love, my dear father," replied the lovely Anna, smiling through her teais; and as lady Charleville had business at Southampton, she proposed accompanying the colonel, who readily dismissed his horse and groom, and took his seat in the barouche, with her ladyship and his daughter, whom he left at a milliner's while lie proceeded to the house he bad taken for bis brother. The front door was open ; he therefore entered the hall without knocking, and turned

CHAPTER XIII
0\ the Thursday our colonel proceeded to Winchester, and to the principal mn, where he ordered dinner for the expected party, w ho arrived, as they had wntten him, about foni, and were, or affected to be, overjoyed
to see him the young ladies displayed all their courtesy, but their dress was too fa¬ shionable to please their uncle and he hid not forgotten what Mr Bramston s house¬ keeper had told her cousm As he had not ordered dinner till five, he seized the op¬ portunity briefly to relate when and how be had discovered that his daughtei was still living and tliough both the baronet and his family affected the greatest sur pnse, he was not their dupe, as he per eeived they had heard of the circumstance When be had finished his relation, sir Charles hoped he would beheve no one eould be more interested m his happmess he trusted he bad not been imposed upon —he made no doubt the proofs of Miss Fitzmaunee s identity were perfectly satis factory he should require no more than his brothers word, but the world were not so eusib satisfied Bnckland was such α poor devil, and so worthless and had acted so strangeh, that really, had he been the colonel he should hardly have dared to believe h» assertions " But I could believe my own ej es su
Charles Annabella ıs the very image of her late mother, and very like her aunt Eheiton llie trinkets I gave Mrs Win¬ ter foi her use and that woman s letter to me will be convincing even to а jury should yon oblige either me or my daugh ter to go to law to prove her right to my name and fortune You will nevei reason coolly my dear Fdwin rejoined the moie calm baronet you are pist the same warm impetuous good hearted ere ıture you w ere when α boj you never take time for reflection Surely I did not say any thing likely to make vou suppose me or mine meant to dispute your daughter s nghts ? I am truly happy she is so like her mother the trin kets are presumptive proofs, and I feel assured oui biother Richard will feel as convinced as I do, that no imposition has either been meant or practised The dear girl has been most fortunate I had heard of her before but was then told she was α natural daughter of яг Herbert Charle villes which fully accounted for his adop¬ tion of her and for his gn ing her so supe
nor an education I presume sir Herbert is quite satisfied of the truth of Brickland s tale?' The colonel was still warm, but curbing his inclination to quarrel with Ins doubting brother, he calmly lepeated how bis daugh¬ ter first attracted the notice ot sir Herbei t, dwelling very foicibly upon that gentle man s visit to Walton, and upon bis an\ icty to discover who the child was he next related Mrs Brickland s tale, which the baronet, for his own satisfaction, had caused his late ward, Henry Pembioke, to commit to writing in the afternoon of the day she had told it them and, finally, he repeated Brickland s reasons for concealing the ti uth, adding—" I have already taken counsels opinion upon tbe business, and have written to Indi» for the necessaiy certificates to establish my daughtei s legi¬ timacy Are уоц now more satisfied, sir Chailes? ' Perfectly so, my dear impatient Ľd- win, and I believe I may ¡inswer for lady litzmaunce and my daugliteis, vi ho w ill
feel happy at being introduced to tin» newly recoveicd relative ' The ladies said all that was proper, and endeav oured to soften down sir Charles s implied doubts, therefoie our colonel chose to appear satisfied An excellent dinner raised tbe baronet s spuits almost above par, and led to his hinting to the colonel thai he w as by no means satisfied w itb the conduct of their othei brotliei—" He makes himself so sure of his eldest son inheriting the title and estate, he has taught the youth to treat me with rt illy gross neglect I did wish to have brought about а match between Ма πα, mj eklest girl, and my supposed heir, but the young gentleman chose to express his dislike to mtcimarrying-with relations, so your gnl will stmd no better chance, l'dwin " Τ entertain the same objection to such alliances, and I thmk it veij probable mj Anna and Mr Richard Fitzmaurice may never meet, except m public, or by mere chance Miss Fitzmaimco thought heiself called
upon to express her indifference towards this ungracious cousm but as time wore, lady Fitzmaunee urged the necessity of proceeding to Southampton, whither the colonel accompanied them, and tiiere be left them, dtligkted with their house, after declining to dnnk Ins tea with them, which they were so far from resenting, that they hardly required asking to spend the en suing day at the Grange Our colonel rode directly to the Abbey to give m lus report, and while Anna was making his tea, be repeated what had pass ed at Wincbester Sir Hei bei t b td sup¬ posed sır Chailes would have had more policy than even to hint Ins doubts so early they should have anscn gradually, and from circumstances, and then beeni mentioned with regret " The fact is, he does not enteitam any however, I am obhged to bim for putting me upon my guard, he may now depend upon my making all secure But will you, lady Charleville, afford my girl, οι ια- thei yours, your countenance to moirow, by doing the honours of my bouse to these
unwelcome guests?—I do not ask you to join in the penance, sir Herbert but Anna will feel very uncomfortable among so many jealous relatives, and such total strangers ' Lady Charleville readily promised to oblige her friend, as she also thought it necessary to convince this family she did not participate in their doubts Never bad our heroine appeared to more advantage than when sbe made her appear¬ ance at the Grange with her kind protec¬ tress few* people understood d.ess better than lady Charleville, and Anna was noiv attired with her usual elegant simplicity, still as became colond Fitzmaunee s daugh¬ ter , and never had he ièlt moie proud ot the relationship, noi more obhged to lady Cliaileville Sir Chailts was punctual to a minute his daughters displayed their shoulders, urns, and ancles, and certainly looked very fashionable but their mother with gnef perceived they were totally eclipsed by then rustic cousin, who she had assured these belles of fashion must hear strong

Having taken their tea, the party broke up. The colonel returned to the Abbey with lady Charleville and his daughter, and the baronet proceeded with his family to Southampton. The young ladies declared their cousin was a very pretty automaton, and, like such figures, excelled in music. " I never heard a better comparison)" replied their mother, " only that she was not so graceful. She reminded me of a figure wliich was exhibited when I was your age, girls, in Spring Gardens, that played divinely upon the piano, and was always dressed by the first milliner of tbe day." " The girl has a modest countenance, and is not a bad figure. To humour my brother, 1 shall, nt present, consider her as my niece ; but 1 must have chapter and verse, and better authority, before I shall allow her to inherit bis estates. Sir Her¬ bert Charleville is a most eccentric charac¬ ter: who else would have adopted such a mere beggar girl, if he really knew no more about her than we are led to be-
lieve? —But I shall be particular in my inquiries, now I am in the neighbou; '.ood. Edwin was once a protegé of the old ba¬ ronet, and he talks so much of gratitude, I should not wonder if he had adopted a mitoral child of the latteri ' " He says the girl is 1 like her mother," Tcsumed lady Fitsmaurice—»" we cannot contradict him: but I shall pick up some¬ thing in the neighbourhood. Edwin is so easily offended, we must go cautiously to work : ho wus always a strange headstrong mortal, the dupe of any artful sycophant, and has never forgiven being sent out to India, thougli he made his fortune there, and acquired no small share of military re¬ putation." The young ladies thought him rather unpolished, and wondered he suffered his only daughter to continue a humble com¬ panion to lady Charleville. " There is some mystery, which it shall be my business to fathom;" noi did the baronet change his mind, or allow any time to dapse ere he began his inquiries, since he moimted his horse immediately
after breakfast the next morning, and rode to Channg It was near a mile from the village to the Grange, as well as to the Abbey, he therefore put up bis horse at the Charleville Arms, and enteied into conversation with the landlord —" A verj neat village,' he observed " Yes, sir, 'tis reckoned a very pretty place, and we have a very good lord of the manor, and an excellent rector Melk¬ sham Abbey is well wortii seeing " So I have been told Sir Ilei bei t Charleville ıs reported to bc very dm ntable ' And tıs no more than the truth he has founded almshouses and a school, not to mention Ins eveıy tliy tion itions " Nor bis having brought up a vuy nice young gnl " Miss I ltzmaunce I suppose ) ou mean ? Ay, it seems but yesterday since master Pembroke sent her to an old woman s, who did keep that little shop opposite, when Bnckland turned her out of doors bn Herbert bad her to the Abbey the very next tlay, and would haye provided for
her, I dare say, if Bnckland had not told и ho she w as Well, God bless her ' say I, and her wortliy father, who is always doing good, and hnding employment for the poor '1 bis man was too partial to both fami¬ lies, it appeared to sir Challes, to be an unprejudiced ludge ot their actions, he therefore W alked forward, and having taken rather a private potb, soon reached the houses where the Hoskinses now resided, thanks to the benevolence ol sir Herbert Mrs Hoskins was at her door, conversing with α neighbour, and from some words winch he caught while puiposely loitering to admire the prospect, he guessed this good latly w is not so ρ irtiul as my landt /old therefore, when hu neighbour walk¬ ed forward, be addressed her with an in¬ quiry respecting the road to Southampton ' Vou me tutimig your back upon it, su , this path Only leads to the Abbey ' " A veiy fine seat, I hai e been infoimed I am a stranger in this part of the world " A Londonéi, I suppose, sir 3 many come don u m the summer I once hveej

" Indeed' I am sorry you have been unfortunate. 'Sir Herbert eould not bo aware lie was doing you an t htjury ; he bears a general good character ; not that I always place implicit faith in the reports of those who arc in some measure depen¬ dent upon him— few such people have the courage or the honesty to speak their real opinion.'' " He will not stop my tongue, I can assure you. The fact is, a nephew of my husband, and a lad, who, they said, was a Ward of sir Herbert, had a quarrel; and fought it oitt, whicb made the baronet owe us a grudge ; and this trifling circum¬ stance led to all our after-misfortunes. 'Tie too long a story, or I could give jou proof of what I advance."

lady should have been thrown upon the mercy of the good sir Herbert and his ex¬ cellent wife Brickland was only an agent in the business his reasons for concealing who she was, and turning her out to starve, were clear enough however, as he has taken up, why, I do not wish to revert to the past tıs a long lane that has no turn¬ ing, as I have often told you, Mrs Hos¬ kins, when you have been abusing your nephew, who, I agree, paved the way for j our rum " I tlunk j our former favourite, master Pembroke, had as much to answer for as Thomas " Then I say you do not speak the truth, and are very ungiateful into the bargain your husband would tell you your tongue had been your greatest ene¬ my, and I believe he was nght ' " My tongue indeed' I would have you to know, Mrs Nelson, that if I am reduced m tbe world, I wdl not be insulted I say master Pembroke first set sir Herbert against us I don't eay Thomas was not

CHAPTER XIV Α λιοντη had elapsed since the ainval of the Fitzmaunee family at Southampton, who broke so frequently upon the retire ment of the colonel, and were so urgent to see him at then house, that he declared he looked forward with delight to their de parture when, dunng the sixth week of their residence m his vicinity, he received а letter from one of the East India direc¬ tors, with whom he corresponded, which informed him that the purser of the India- man was arrived at tbe India House, and th it the ship was coming round to Ports mouth, having on board lieutenant colonel Morningthorpe • I will proceed immediately to town cried the colonel, having hastily summoned
lus valet— 'I can call at sir Charles s in my way through Southampton, and while his servant was packing up, he read a se cond letter, which, from not knowing the writing, he had thrown aside, as of least importance ' My dear sir afforded lum no satisfaction, he therefore hastily turned to the signature, " Edward Hertford "— ' Hertford' Can it lie any relation ofmy wife?' mentally exclaimed the rather agi tated colonel, reading as follows — " MY DEAR SIR, " Though a perfect stranger to your person, I am not so to youv family and character Your late w ife w as my first cousin my fatlier w ıs left the guardian of her and Mrs Llverton, from wbom he learnt her mainage and demise As his was a inere honoiary title, he never ad¬ dressed you upon the subject, since, so far from having any pecuniary concerns of the sistei s to manage, he assisted m fitting tbem out foi India, as he highly respected the] memory of their parents, whose po¬ verty did not originate in any misconduct,

would prevent sir Charles from danng to express any farther doubts The Kev Mr Fitzmaunee had displayed infinitely more sense and much greater policy, as he had wntten а most friendly congratulatory let ter to the colonel, merely reproaching him for having withheld such agreeable mfor mation till he had introduci d his daughtei to sır Charles, adding, by way of postscript — ' Your girl must be the very reverse of what I expect, if she does not totally eclipse her fashionable cousins " But to return to colonel Hertford's let ter, which was no less gratifying to lady Chaileville, and which our colonel chose to answ ei immediately, declaring he would dine in Spring Gardens the ne\t day, and as bis letter was a transcript of his feelings, and he made Anna wnte the postscript, be flattered himself that this kmd relative would feel that his friendly notice of his young cousm w as duly appreciated — " Now I have so far acquitted myself of my duty, I will hie me to Southampton, to make su Charles paiticipate in my feel ings towaids colonel Hertford By the
way, I have some other very agreeable intelligence to communicate Moming¬ thorpe is certainly ere this landed in Eng land, and if I can hut prevail upon him to visit my cottage, I shall not have a wish vmgratified The baronet lenewed his congratula¬ tions, observing this w as certainly one of his fortunate days, and as he had many things to airange and some further oiders to give at home, he departed, promising to drink tea, sup, and sleep at the Abbev, from w hence he should start at six Sir Charles ľit?maunee was mucli less ci itified by the communication of colonel Heittovds kind intentions, observing, he ç,ave hnn cied t for bemg still very roman¬ tic, smce he had determined, upon the moie faith of a flying report, to make а total stringer Ins heir —" But you will do \\ ell, my dear bdwin, to take advantage of his folly I have heard bim mentioned as ι very brave officer, but aa a strange eccentric being Shall you anawer his let¬ ter as he desnes?' Our colonel declared his intention of
starting the next morning inquiring whe ther he could do any thing for the baronet in town ? Not any thing tbat I can now recollect my deai Edw in but I positively did not suppose you were so worldly minded I am glad to find you are grown wisei than when you went abroad then you would h ive scorned to have crossed the way for any bribe that could have been held out— now you are all anxiety to avail yourself of the invitation ol a person j ou hardly know by name br mse he wntes he shall make your elaugl ter his hen Our sentin ents an 1 feelings diffci so widely sir Charles that I shall not tnke the trouble to explain mine upon the pie sent occasion Had I not heaid from colo¬ nel Hertford I sl ould equally have pio ceeded to town as the officer wlio pre served my life m Indostan has just landed in Fngland and I am all impatience to see him I am happy you have two strings to your bow, was the rejoinder, as I think

How else can I be disappointed? since, believe me, I do not covet his money—merely his friend¬ ship , so good-moming—my compliments to the ladies,' and thus the brothei s part ed, the colonel despising the really worldly- minded enviouB baronet, who had never been so completely mortified This ob¬ scure girl would, he foresaw, be drawn into notice, and might marry much above her meats, through the spirit ot romance that pei vaded this relation In any othei company colonel Fit/mau- rice would have been silent respecting what had passed at Southampton, but his heart was so generally upon bis lips at the Ab¬ bey, that he gave a ludicrous account of sir Charles s suppressed anger, desuing his daughtei would continue upon the same terms with her cousins dunng his absence, adding—" and that you may not be obliged to satisf) their cunositj, I shall reserve all I maj have to say respecting j our new ly-

lected an engagement in the neighbbitr- hood, therefore left them together, pro¬ mising to return in an hour. ' Diiring his absence, Selby founrlhis new client perfectly aw fail of business, end hé promised åo'have the will, Ibrnwhich he güve' direction's, ready for signatura' that evening, when he agreed to'sup with' hini at the ■- Coffeehouse, that he might receive various papers, &c. wbich he cx- pedteduvould be in town by that bour. ' Mtømaurice ratller exceeded his hour, but was happy to learn that Selby hoped lo have made everj· necessary arrangement by six o'clock the next evening ; agreeing that it was very right to be prepared, in case a bullet should have received α special commission, though he considered Mor- mngthorpe as a peculiar favourite of for¬ tune, reverting to his arrival in India, and to their first acquaintance. " If I mistake not," said Selby, " the late general Momingthorpe and you, colo¬ nel, went out in the Asia, and by a miracle escaped with youi lives. Do yon remem¬ ber a cadet of the name of Pembroke, who
went out in that ship, and died during the Voyage a ' " Perfectly, but I cannot at present spare time to answer even the most friend ly questions as I have an appointment for every hour between this and tinnier w hub I take with my colonel I sbull drink my tea with niy military agent, and hope to see you at supper ' which Selb) again pro mised, blaming himself for having led to uny subjeet foreign to his clients own af¬ fane, situated us be was, and when Ins mind, thoughts, and time must be so fully occupied Ь ltzmaunce parted with his favounte, as he openly styled t^e young soldier, aţ the War Office, and devoted his morning to writing to sn Herbert, to whom he de dared, that to see his Anna the wife of Morningthorpe was now the only wish he had ungratified requesting he would not drop а hint of the kind to his daughter, whom he hoped to present to colonel Hert¬ ford, at the Grange, before tbe expiration of another week When Momingthorpe came to dinner,
he presented Fitzmaurice with the letter he had mentioned, and а ring of inesti¬ mable Value, that had been given tbe ge¬ neral by one of the native punces, and wluth he requested, in his posthumous address, that he would wear in remem¬ brance of an old friend " Ever the »ame kind, and considerate, and worthy man," said l· ltzmaunce " Лб I told you last night, Morningthorpe, I needed no recommendation to induce me to consider you as my son, so suffer me at once to slide mto the place of the deceased, and to request I may hear from you, by every convenient opportunity, while in Spain " This Morningthorpe readily promised, merely regretting he could devote so little time to such a fnend, without whom he should have been really a stranger at home " I mean to accompany you to Ports¬ mouth, we can start at your own hour, the moon is nearly at the full, and I shall enjoy the jaunt " Morningthorpe was much gratified by the proposal, and as our readers w ould not
be amused by our detailing the progress of bis preparations, nor by our recapitulating bis instructions to their old acquaintance George Selby, who never again ventured to nsk a question unconnected with Ins client's business, suffice it to say, that, af¬ ter taking an early tea with tolonel Hert¬ ford, who gave hnn several letters of re¬ commendation to some of his own officers, but more particulaily one to the com¬ mander-in-chief and to some other gene¬ rals—Fit7inaunce, who had served with tins tiuly great commander m India, also wrote bun a long letter, and Morning¬ thorpe had received some fiom the War Office addressed to his lordship, naj, had even brought some to lum from India— w ben, ,is we before said, having taken bis tea m Spring Gaidens, be stepped into α chaise and-foiu with his eaily fi iend, leav¬ ing Ins valet to follow in the mail with the remainder ol Ins baggage, anil depart¬ ed for Portsmouth. As soon as they weie off the stones, Fitymaunce candidly asked Ins comp unon why he had volunteered his sei vices at
such a moment's warning, particularly hav¬ ing so much to do in Englund, and having so lately mhented such an immense pro¬ perty » aelding—" These were inquiries I could not make before Hertford but I own, upon reflection, I think you have been rather precipitate, antl much more attentive to the interests of your country than to your own ' " When I left India, it was with а de¬ termination to enter upon active service in Europe, even as a volunteer, should I fail of being sent out and this the governor- general, from whom I brought letters to the commander in chief, particularly men tioned The regiment into whicli I bad exchanged was a mere skeleton, and will not be fit for actu il service for some months, I theiefore eagerly availed myself of the gratifying offer made me of my present command, since I shall thus immediately proceed to Spam, the goal of all my wishes I need not tell you, my kind friend, that I have no relatives only а few fnends, to mourn my loss, should I fall, and surely such unconnected beings are the most pro
per people to nsk their lives in battle I am, besides, veiy partial to an active life —I should at present be miserable, were I required to sit down quietly as you have done, and I have no lehsh for the gaieties and dissipations of London Ten years hence I shall be less restless and should I live so long, I will tben settle in your neighbourhood, and endeavour to render my vist inheritance a blessm¿ to those ω ound me ' Fitzmaunee agreed that, situated as he was, he had only acted with proper spmt, again, at his request, detailing every occui- rence connected with himself and daugh ter, whom he described as a most amiable affectionate girl, but neither dwelt upon her beauty nor her accomplishments Mormngthorpe then told lum that he had left orders and full powers with Selby to dispose of his estate m tlie north, as the house would require great altérations be¬ fore he could reside there, and the situa¬ tion was far from pleasant, stdl, as the land was very good, and was lütdy to selb l3
well, he did not care how soon it changed owners, as he could always meet with a purchase more to his mmd, acknowledging tbat be was ricbei than he had ever hoped, w ished, or expected to be, as the general, independent of tins estate, had died wortii upwards of tw enty thousand α year 'i he colonel w as no less confidential m Ins communications, and felt half soirj when they drove up to the mn at Ports mouth, from whence the corpse of the gentleman Morningthorpe had succeeded had been that very morning remov ed in a heai se, on its way to the family-vault in Somersetshire The senior captain was waiting the arrival of his new commander, whom he greeted with respectful cordiality, and from whom he received a letter from colonel Hertford, which would alone have sufficed, he told Morningthorpe, to make hnn rejoice at the change which had taken place, but as even moments were precious, the instant the mail amved, the new colo¬ nel, the captain, and their servants, pre ceeded on board the vessel in winch they •were to sail, and Fitzmaunee having seen
them under way with a very fair wind, returned to town, amusing himself dunng his journey with building various castles, and laying vanous plans for the future, in which Mm ningthorpe was alw ays included Accoiding to promise, he drove imme diately to colonel Hertford s, to whom he presented a few lines from bis friend, and as many more from captain Wolsey, and tben told him that be hoped ere this they bad reacbed the Land s End " I nev ervt as more pleased with any man, dunng so short an acquaintance, as with your hero —for whom, by the way, I have α packet to give you, and there is alio a parcel, or rather package, to j om address, containing Indian ranties, I suppose ' Fitzmaunee had thought he had talked over every thing of consequence with his young fnend, but instantly broke open bis packet, which inclosed a sealed copy of his will, Morningthorpe wrote him, which, as he had appointed him one of his executors, he w ished to leave in Ins possession—the original remained m the hands of Mr Selby He next alluded to a few Indian
shawls and muslins, which he bad brought over for no particular purpose, and whicli he now gladly made ovei to lum, to divide with bis daughter and her beloved protec¬ tress, signing himself his obliged friend " I tlnnk I am the most obliged, ob¬ seıved ritzmaunce, who made а point of seeing Selby veıy fiequently, and of af¬ fording hım eveiy assistance towaids set¬ tling Ins clients business during his stay m town when feeling himself rathei bet¬ ter, or perhaps fai eying he was so, colonel Hertford agreed to accompany lum home, and to spend at least a week m Hamp¬ shire He wrote ev ery particular to sir Her¬ bert, lequestmg Anna might give them the meeting at the Giange, w bei e tbey hoped to arnve to dinner the day after they left London Sir Herbert was very happy when lie bad fixed the day of his return, as he greatly missed his society, and though much entertained by bis let¬ ters, and feeling greatly interested in every thing concerning Momingthorpe, he was very anxious to have bim again m the
neighboui bood, as peihaps, out of tbc spi¬ nt of contradiction, peiceiving she was very aveise to leave bei fuend» at the Ab¬ bey, su Chirles Titzmauiice and Ins lady seldom suffered a day to elapse without sending for their niece, affecting to feci both hint and offended if she endtavouied to excuse beiself fiom obeying then sum¬ mons and as she derived no pleasure from the nitercouise, and both sir Heibert and lady Charleville ìegretted her frequent ab¬ sences, she was in hopes that her father would exonerate her from the continual penance she underwent, to gratify, not the regard, but the capnce of her uncle and aunt She was at the Grange at the appointed time, and must bav с been much more fas¬ tidious thin she had ever appeared, had she not been highly flatteied by the kind address of her cousin, who biought her a variety of expensive presents, and seemed, at their first meeting, to consider her as а beloved daughter, declaring she was the image of her mother, and during the aftei- ijoon he was enraptured by her convei sa-
tion, which was wholly devoid of affecta¬ tion, but remarkably fascinating and en¬ tertaining—indeed, no female ever possess¬ ed, in а gieater degree, tbe secret ot pleas¬ ing, without any shew or display of her numerous accomplishments yet it le- quued some time and а great deal ot pe¬ netration to discover the full extent of her supenonty, which bad not even been suspected by her aunt and cousins The next morning, as colonel Hertford was in excellent spirits, be îeadily agi eed to accompany his host to the Abbey, where he found himself a no less welcome guest than at the Grange, and as he required no pressing to stay dmnei, I itzmaunte requested leave of absence for a couple of hours, as he must let sir Charles know he was returned 'I he baronet affected great joy upon his entrance, and soon evinced his cunosity to leain whether bis London journey had* answered his expectations Our colonel entered mto a few bnef details, which were by no means gratifying to the en¬ vious baronet, who made no objection to
dining at the Grange the next day, ас knowledging he was anxious to be in¬ troduced to colonel Hertford, vino he suspected was not so fond of lighting as Morningthorpe—indeed the latter appear¬ ed to lum a military Quixote, who fan¬ cied honour was oniy to be acquired at the cannon s mouth " Do \ ou mean to flatter or to oblige me, sir Orarles, by thus criticizing two men whom I rank among mj particular friends?—Colonel Hertford s bravery, skill, and courage are too well known to be like¬ ly to suffer from your censure You may deem Morningthorpe a Qui «rte for hav¬ ing exposed bis own life to save mine, since on no other occasion has he been equally lash indeed his military talents, cojrage, and experience, render him a very valuable acquisition to our army in Spain " How can you fancy me in earnest, Fdwin'—I dare say he desenes all the pr use j ou so often lavish upon bim But remember I shall be seuously jealous uf

CHAPTER XVI
HAViNOintroduced colonel Morningthorpe to the notice of our readers, and we liojie interested them in his fate, we will take the liberty of following him to Sjiaui His officers had become intimate with him dur¬ ing the voyage, anil tbey, one and all, re¬ joiced ut the exchange which had, fortu¬ nately for them, taken place, as their late commander had пел er been abroad, conse¬ quently had never seen actual seıvıce, and at times, particularly if in hquoi, he was half a madman like Morningthorpe, he bad
exchanged out of .motber regiment, tlieif former lieutenant colonel having given the preference to the heavy cavalry—tbat is, as tbey told Morningthorpe in confidence, he bad been completely cut by all the subal¬ terns ; so, perhaps to pumsh tbem, he hud persuaded Ins cousin to change situations with bun, well knowing tint be would prove even α more disagreeable substitute Their passage was both pleasant and expeditious, which was the more fortu¬ nate, as they had been so long wind bound at Portsmouth, but a fine steady breeze attended them the whole way , and they were surpnsed to leain, on landing at -------- , that the earl of Wallingforel's re¬ giment, which had sailed at least a month before, bad not been in Spam more than ten days—that some of the horses had died during the passage, and many were so ex¬ hausted that they had remained at -------- to recmit, till they received such pressing orders, they had begun their maich to join the army three dajs befoie, Morningthorpe, who felt assured that Ins presence was no less required at head-
<)11гвЧй'9, : resolved to proceed with all coni veulent expedition ; anet he ivas the'retbre touch gratified when informed tbat there was not*« man lipon tbe siek list, nor had they tast asin^lb horse, though sotrie bad not bflrnfc ithei voyage so well as others. Lord WaUingford, ho understood, had submitted implicitly to the advice of his veterinary professors : he was not so corn- pla'isrint, not conceiv ing that either bleed¬ ing, &e. would streng then'the animals; therelbrei having assembled his men, to each of whom he made a tiifiing present, and to each ot' whom he had something guy and apropos to say, feeling proud of having the command of four hundred and sixty fine young fellows, and all his country¬ men, when, addressing them in a body, he pointed out the necessity ot' their imme¬ diately proceeding on tlieir march, declar¬ ing that he would take upon himat If all responsibility respecting tbe horses, who were, like themselves, merely rather stiff for the want of their accustomed exercise ; he thereloie proposed their walking a few miles in the evening, each leading tlieir
horse, which Would prove of real benefit to both themselves and the animals A general shout of applause succeeded his speech and as he attended to every minuţia connected with tbe comfort and well being of his men and their beasts hn slightest w ish became a law to tliese brave fellows, who soon appreciated the real me nt of then commander and felt proud of being led on by such a man Neither they noi then horses suffered by their expedition mj, Alormngthoipe thought they both looked the better for their march on the fourth evening w hen be was met by a messenger from the com mander m chief to request be w ould hasten forward but wbo expn ssed real astonish ment at their being so far on tbe loid it not being supposed they had starteli fro n -------- , smce thej w ere onlj tu o cluj s be lund loi d Walhnglord s corps whose hoi ses he snid had not stood the fatigue ne ir so well as those belonging to this regiment Morningthorpe wis very much elated by having thus early had an opportumtv of displaying his real in tbe service, and
having summoned his principal officers, they all «greed with Inm that the corps w as now sufhciently recruited to admit of their in iking a forced march the next day, and as the colonel seized every opportum¬ tv to ease his own horse by frequently dis¬ mounting, they all followed bis judicious example and were thus en ibled и reach headquaiteis long before thev baa been even expei ted, since lord Walbngford had barely gamed twelve hours advance upon them noi w re either his men oi hoi ses moie fiesh or more fit for immediate ser- \ ice tin y hai ing both lacked the minute and kind attentions of tlieir commander, as the cui, though still indefatigable in the puisuit ot pleisuic, was not unmind¬ ful of Ins ow n ease, and w ıs more anxious to avoid peisonal fatigue than to attend to the comioi te ot his soldiers be was besides, though he considered liiui°dt in the pinne of life, no longer so aetıı e oı so vigorous as be h id been at hve and tw etit), nor had he seen much seıvıce, tliough be had been nbiojil m the veiy commencement of the present wai, but he was not, like Mor-
ningthorpe, mured to a military life and tbe attendant pnvations, and, still less like hnn, more attentive to the welfare of his men than to his own personal comforts, in¬ deed, his wish to obtain the rank of geneial had alone induced hmi to seek gloiy in the Peninsula, since, 111 reality, he would have piehrred remaining at home Of Ins biavery ht hod given lepeated proofs, but as j et ht b id seldom had otcasion to dis¬ play it 111 the held, and the ftai less duellist may be a very mdifttitnt coi inlander Momingthorpe was admitted to an im¬ mediate audience by the victorious heio who had the duel command, who had fought under his uncle 111 tho East, and bad been beai d to ìemark that bis nephew was а scion from the same brave stem, in¬ deed he was impatient to see а young man who h id acquired so much military fame, and whose zeal and expedition were coi¬ tam proofs ot his anxiety to second all his measures he required no letters ot recom mcndation, he politely told the j oung co¬ lonel, to induce him to ai precíate his me¬ rit—his services in India were a sure pass-
port to his favour, and he made no doubt ol' bis equally distinguishing himself in Europe, entering into some familiar de¬ tails respecting the campaign, and giving bim his opinion of tbe French generals, of whom he spoke as brave enemies and ex¬ cellent soldiers. " Yet they have never been able to re¬ sist the British since your lordship has had tbe command," remarked Morningthorpe, But as we should swell our tale out of all bounds, were we to dwell upon the praises of' the hero of Britain, we shall only ob¬ serve, that this interview convinced him that Morningthorpe was wortliy of bis no¬ tice, and likely to execute his orders, with¬ out even considering the peril that might be attached to bis obedience-, nor do we mean to detail either battles or sieges, con¬ scious of our inability to do justice to such subjeets; we shall merely relate a few in¬ cidents connected with either, in which Morningthorpe took an active part Scarcely bad he joined the army ere one of those engagements which will be handed vol. in. ÌI
down to the remotest posterity took place; and as every officer proved themselves he¬ roes, Morningthorpe must have done won¬ ders, and have displayed very superior in¬ telligence, very great talents, and consum¬ mate valour, to have been distinguished by his great commander, who particularly mentioned him in his dispatches, and even publicly declared that he was greatly in¬ debted to his intuitive knowledge, which bad enabled him to render the orders he had received so critically useful. The earl of Walbngford, who was equally eager to distinguish himself, but who could not boast tbe same coolness in action, by pursuing up an advantage which he had obtained, suffered himself to be surround¬ ed, and must have been cither killed or taken prisoner, had not colonel Morning¬ thorpe hastened to his assistance, and by a most skilfbl manoeuvre extricated his lord¬ ship, who had been severely wounded dur¬ ing the contest, and enabled him to effect his' retreat to the camp unmolested, ere the fate of day was decided. We need not add that the British arms were victorious;
and when be bad paid every requisite and many gratifying attentions to every man and officer belonging to his own corps who had been wounded during the en¬ gagement, Momingthorpe having escaped unhurt (though a ball had carried away one of his epaulettes, and a second had grazed his cap), understanding the wound¬ ed earl wished to see him, paid him a visit; and certainly his lordship was not sparing of his acknowledgments for the very essen¬ tial service he had rendered him, assuring bis visitor that he was convinced he sliould have died under the hands of a French surgeon ; besides, as the enemy had been so completely beaten, hours must have elapsed ere be could have obtained assist¬ ance, therefore he might have bled to death; whereas now he hoped to renew his acquaintance with his new friend in England. Morningthorpe merely hoped his lord¬ ship would not be a very «Vere sufferer; but soon took his leave, as he had been or¬ dered to be kept very quiet, and was to be M 2
removed m a litter to the nearest town, there to remam dunng his confinement Possibly the earl would have been se» verely mortified, had he heard the stric¬ tures one of the many able generals who commanded on this occasion made upon his rashness to the hero whose presence alone insured success—" Such parade-dis- ciplmanans generally commit errors them¬ selves, and never inspire those under them with any degree of mihtary ardour, while Mormngthorpe seemed to liave infused his own courage and skill into all under his command, as every man in his regiment performed wonders, without being at all aware that they were doing more than their duty * Colonel Fitzmaunee was among the most rejoiced m England, when the news of this important victory reached Channg Sir Charles was gone into Lincolnshire, and colonel Hertford was returned to town, but Ъе had his friends at tbe Abbey, to wham he could conlmunicate his joy, and had Morningthorpe been his son, he could not have exulted more ш lus success,
dwelling upon every sentence in the Ga¬ zette m which bis name was mentioned, nnd declaring that he had felt convinced be would do wonders As to his having pr vented loid Walbngford from being taken prisoner it wis 11 very well though he should have seriously gneved bad be suffered for his humanity, as his lordship s valet had not prepossessed hnn in his favour " If he is severely wounded, which the Gazette seems to signify, it may work a temporary reform in his morals, ' said sir Herbert and thus the subject dropped. The next day brought Fitzmaunee a short letter from Momingthorpe, nnd a longer one from colonel Hertford, who en¬ closed the epistle he had received from his second in command, who he declared, bad more than surpassed his most sanguine ex¬ pectations he therefore blessed the chance w Inch had led him, at so cntical a moment, to Portsmouth, as he had feared his men would not have been ably HI forward The poorei classes at Charing had also reason to rejoice at the complete success of tlie Bntish arms, since, independent of the
usual ringing of belk, &c both the baronet and the colonel weie very hbenl to all those who required their aid, and a supper and beer were givtn to the noi king purt of tlie tommunit)
CHAPTER XVÏÏ
Fitzm idrici· liHd nevei felt so anxious respecting the Lonelon papers as since his hei о had been m Spam, and as he w as α remarkably good readei, and bis renurks upon the fashionable scandal of the day weie very amusing to sir Herbert, lie lie¬ quently had his own letteis and papers taken to the Abbey, m hopes be might cull something from one 01 the other to divert the baronets thoughts from lus m ci easing mhimities About а fortiiojit aftei he bad rejoiced over Monnngthoipe s newly-acquired lamels, he became, as usual lecturer at the Abbey, wheu he read with some surprise the recent death of the epui)
tess of WaUingford, who had breathed her last at her seat near Windsor, having long been in very declining health, the public were also informed that she bad left three children—loid Domers the Kev William Danvers, wbo bid pist tiken orders, and lady Mana Danvers, now in her twentieth year, between whom her large property was now equally divided, according to tbe tenor of her father s w ill The earl s being m Spain was of course alluded to, where he was confined in consequence of a veiy severe wound, with many more îmnutiœ respecting her family, which, if not very interesting, served to fill the columns of the paper " Poor woman ' said sir Herbert, w ıth a sigh—*' I think she was desen mg a bet¬ ter fate ' Lady Charleville seized the first opjior- tunity to retire, but so unaffectedly, that the colonel did not suspect she felt at all more interested rejpeetwg the deceased than he did, when he obsei ved —" Then I sliould not suppose her lord s danger Jias- tened her demise ? '
" I dare say she merely learnt it officially, or, at most, from the earls valet, as they were not only a fashionable but а miser¬ able couple, as far as she was eoneeined, and I tlnnk de ıth must, to lier, h iv e prov cd a release from pain The entrance of Mr Andrews changed the subject he came to inform the baronet that his son in law Mr Stapylton, the cu rate of Channg, had just been appointed to the viluable living of --------, in the >,ew Forest and that Dr Margram meant, in consequence, to nominate the Kev Mr Courtney one of his earliest pupils, to the curacy adding—" '1 bat will be but fair, as rinnoin says tbat gentleman is paying Ins addresses to Miss Margram, whom he fie quently met vn town last winter, and which has led to his verj recently taking up his abode at Southampton * The usu il congratul itions being offered by all present, Fitzmaunee asked bis daugh ter if she had heaid of her fnentls hai mg a lover? " It has been hmted to me, sn, and I rejoiced at the circumsta.ice, as I know the
doctor will feel more comfortable, should either of his daughters marry " " He certainly visibly fads," resumed Mr Andrews, " and he might think a son¬ iti law would prove both a comfort and н protector to his widow. Mr Stapylton would not have put him to any inconve¬ nience, he would rather have employed a curate himself, but it was the doctor s own wish to engage Mr Courtney " This was confirmed in the afternoon by the Dr and Mrs Margram, when the for¬ mer told his patron that his new curate had proposed for Ins daughter, and as be was a man of family and some fortune, he had freely given his consent The village cotone was so much dimi¬ nished, since the Hoskmses were too re¬ duced in circumstances to join the parties, and Mrs Cummings was fiom necessity obliged to give up company,- that there were only the Medlicotts and a London family, who had taken Hoskms s former villa, to sit in judiiment upon this match, if we except the surrounding j eomamy, M á
and these all hoped it woitld prove fortu- nate, as did the excellent Mrs Nelson, who had just married her daughters, the one to a master carpenter at Walton, tbe other to a budder at Southampton When she gtew old and unable to attend to her business, she meant to resign in favour of her eldest daughter, and her savings she should be stow upon her youngest She continued in equal request at the Abbey, and was m no less favour at Elm Grove and the Grange, where she owned she felt ratlier mortified at Miss Margrams leading up the dance, as she had hoped Miss ritz¬ maunce would have set her the example " I do not wish my daughter should nm ry while sir Herbert lives, the colonel told her, " as he is never happy when she is absent from the Abbey, and her very secluded life has prevented her fiom see¬ ing any man likely to make her happy, or whom I should like for а son in law Mrs Nelson hoped her gratitude to the Charlevilles would be amply rewarded, de¬ claring that, much as she had blamed, sbe was now much more inclined to pity Mis
Cummings, who, from enjoying real afflu¬ ence, was now often pushed for a shilling —" Miss Fitzmaunee often sends her very acceptable presents, and so does lady Char- levüle, else she would often dine with duke Humphrey—Well, God will reward tbem both," tins was her usual consolatory prog¬ nostic, and with which she generally either began or ended Sir Herbert cbose, contrary to his now sedentary habits, to attend divme service at the parish church the first day that Mr Courtney officiated, and, in common w ıth every one present, he was exceedingly gra¬ tified and much edified by Ins sermon. Thouj,h a comparative young man, he had an excellent deliveiy, and his heart seemed so perfectly in his subject, be gave general satisfaction, and received an immediate in vıtatıon to the Abbey, where hè became a daily guest Truth obliges us to declare, that, had he not been senously engaged to Hornet Margram, be w ould have beeh m dangei of disposing of bis heart m favour of Anna Tıt/ıııaunce —nay, perhaps b did tiot escape a random shot ol the blind
archer, notwithstanding he was strictly upon his guard, when, fortunately for his peace of mind, he recollected that Anna would certainly not select a humble cu¬ rate when she made her election ; and as she evidently was not equally struck with his merits, he contented himself with ad¬ miring, but ceased to love her. Meanwhile the earl of Wallingford was pr .lounced in a fair way of recovery ; but as he did not recruit his strength so fast as he could have wished, and was perforce obliged to recollect that he had existed more than half a century, which he usually endeavoured to banish from his memory, he readily agreed in his surgeon's opinion, that be was rendered unable to bear up against the fatigues of the campaign ; and as his superior officers had no wish to de¬ tain him in the Peninsula, not through their fears tbat he would dispute their laurels with them, but ratlier because they doubted his ability to second their plans, he had therefore made up his mind to re¬ turn home as soon as he was able to travel, when he received the intelligence of the
countess s death, for which he certainly did not gneve, since he thought it a most for tunate circumstance, as it enabled him to make a most honourable retreat from the hardships and dangers to tvhich tbe Bn tish army were constintly exposed, which even his love of gloiy could not make him tolerate the fact is, it u as too late in life for him to be able to endure the great fa tigue, frequent pnvations &c attendant upon his profession lo tbe woild at least to the few who were admitted into his apartment he appeared reasonably gneved for his loss he had too much sense to affect great sorrow but he expressed his fears that his misfortune had accelerated the countess s dece ise and as he was still a very Proteus, and could enact any part suitable to his interest he was considered as paying every decent tribute to the me mory of Ins late wife Never had time hung so heavy upon his hands as dunng the interval whicli elapsed after he learnt his wife s death while he continued unable to endure the fatigue of travelling The army had long removed
from his vicinity, a few sufferers like him¬ self only remaining behind tbey some¬ times visited him when able to tike any exercise, but tbey were mere everyday acquaintance, and only ciiculatcd to en¬ liven a vacant hour by taking a hand at piquet His steward s letters afforded him no amusement the Southampton widow, Mis Ashden, was the only correspondent whose epistles interested his feelings, and ns she htld out hopes that evei y succeed¬ ing one would announce the death of sir Herbert Cli niellile, he amused himselt with for ning plans to dupe bei lad\slnp into m ıkın,; bim her second choice From this lady he learnt I it/maiuice's sort of connexion with Morning thoipe, who, be agreed, was a veiy bi ive fellow—a second Hotspur, who would " Пи к it «с с ne »vit i» 1 pliiik I r tilt li и u I ro Ilt | Ic I ilmi,, and who seemed to set his hfe at nousrht m search of fame He agreed, when talk¬ ing of him, that at bis ige it was natural to w ish to obtain а n ime —a title or West¬ minster Abbey wtre giatify ing perjpee-

merely of necessary explanation and upon matters of business, and nothing else was discussed between the father and son As the countess s fortune bad been stnctly secured to her children, he told the young clergyman he thought tbey were all amply provided for, and as the countess had also purchased him a living out of her savings, since he was well aware none of her family would have given him one, he ought to thmk himself extremely well off if his conduct met his approbation, he might di vide his personals between hnn and Ins sister, though she had imbibed all the countess» prejudices, and was equally stiff and tii„id William had mhented no small share of his fathers polity therefoie as he might gain and could not lose by continuing upon good tenns with linn, he endeavour¬ ed to render himself agreeable, and so far succeeded, tint the earl proposed his ac¬ companying lum into Dorset hire, where he meant to spend the ensuing six months to recruit his strength, ind m the retire ment decency for a time required, when,

While he was daily forming and as dady rejecting \ anous plans in embryo, colonel Hertford pud the debt of nature rather suddenly, one of his diroiiual complaints having flown to his stomach, which car¬ ried bun off within a few hours after I itz- maunce, m consequence of bis basty sum mons, had taken his station by Ins bedside Upon opening Ins will, our colonel found that he had, according to promise, left the bulk ot his fortune, which was chiefly in the funds, to his daughtei to hinself and Mrs Elverton he had left five thousand pounds each, with legacies to all his ser¬ vants, and a hundred pounds for a ring to Morningthorpe. His effects amounted to between forty and fifty thousand pounds,
therefore our colonel thought Ins daughter would be amply provided for, and rather wished sir Herbert might not distinguish her m his will, as he conceived (not being aware of the real reasons for sir Herberts dislike to lord Walbngford, though he en¬ tertained but a very poor opinion himself of the earl s principles) that, at lady Cbar- leville's decease, the estate ought to centre in that family But having settled all his business in town, and left Selby to dispose of the house in Spring Gardens and the furniture as soon as decency admitted, not liking the situation, nor thinking his daugli¬ tei required a town-bouse, he returned to the Grange Having w ntten α very long letter to Momingthorpe while in London, as he had beard at the Wai Office he was immediately promoted to the chief com¬ mand of the legiment, he mentioned his bequest, and desired his orders upon the occasion and to him he indulged his usual gay satirical vem respecting brd Walhng- ■ford, whom he felt convinced was the sounder of bis own praises expressing his fears that sir Herbert would soon follow
colonel Hertford, as, grateful as he felt to the lattei, be considered bis death as a mere memento of moitdity, when compared to the loss he sliould sustain m the baronet, desiring to hear whenever his friend found leisure to write, as he felt interested in all lus concerns

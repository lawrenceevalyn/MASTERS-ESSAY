* difficult task: Henry Pemtiroke became as familiar to liim as Henry Pemberton, and Mrs. Wilson, the name his protectress had assumed, he had been accustomed to style nurse, and could he have seen mamma, he would have preferred the plea· »ant village of Mortlake to the residence which he had Formerly inhabited. But vvhen, at the expiration of four months, he was informed his beloved mother was no more, he evinced a degree of grief hardly to have been expected in so young a child. He recollected every instance of maternal affection, whieli had even escaped the me¬ mory of Mis. Wilson ; and had hebeen old¬ er, this innocent deception might liave cost hiin his life,and had not his sorrow yielded to time and the endearments of liis alinost- materoal friend, probably all his mother's future.'plans would have been fmstrated, and he would have been restored to her arms; hut much as she Hoved, nay, ¡dob izedj him, the fait theolmoet-iraperioia no-) cesaty of. kbejluig him' im total· ignorancii of the stigma annexed to his birth, and of many other circumstances wliieh- Might,

member of this coterie, fehè took tip her abode with Mrs. Meredith, in Leicoster- sqtiaťe, and Harry Pembroke was intro- duced'.to the closely-veUed lady as to the dearest friend of his motlier, and his future guardian and protectress. Mrs. Meredith had in early life been ac¬ quainted with а gentleman Whose expec¬ tation» of rising in the world having lieen damped by the early death of bis father/ had devoted his talents to the benefit of the Using generation—first, as assistant in acolebrated academy, and latterly as the master of a preparatory school. He had ¿mrried α lady perfectly * caléulated to as-' sist his efforts by her care and attention to the health, diet, cleanliness, and minor morals of his'juvenile pupils. Wellsdown House (which was within а short distance of the sea, in the finest part of Dorsetshire) was at 'this "period /in very ι high and fle-' bervéd repute. Jiri!

He is handsomely piovided for, and will, I make no doubt, do both her and you credit." Sir.

Mrs. Meredith's reply being perfpqţly satisfactory, and her answer to Hepryi proving most gratifying to the child's feel¬ ings, he resolved to study very hard to deserve a continuance of her regard.

Mrs. MttftídHh Was very closely veiled, át which he was nöt surprised. She ap¬ peared a tall, ahd rather ft stout figure, stooped as she walked, with the aid of a crutch stick a»d Mrs. Wilson's arm ; but having recovered from the exertion she had made, she absolutely forbade his send¬ ing for Mr*.

As he had gi ovi n up, and unelerstood the na¬ ture of his obligations to Mrs Meitehtli, he had more than once asked Mis Wil¬ son, when visiting his protectress, where his father and mother had hved—whethir he had any brothers and sisters, uncles or aunts, or any friends besides Mrs Mere¬ dith ? As these n ittiral questions had been foreseen, pıopeı answers had been fiamed —His paients had lived in London—did

CHAPTER VI
WiiiLr our heio is making himself an inteiest in the rcgoid of the doctor and his lady, becoming acquainted with his juvenile companions, and displaying his stoik of knowledge, vve will introduce oui îeadirs to some of the inhabitants of Charing, viho may now and then be mentioned in the course of ош narrative, but befoie wc proceed to the present, vve
will take the liberty of reverting to the past. Mr Melmoth, the late owner of Melks- h im Abbey, had lived the close and re¬ cluse life ot a miser his establishment hod been m unison with his ideas, so had his fuiniture, dress, and appearance he had tome mto possession of this beautilul plate m consequence of his great-untie having disinhciitcd Ins ow n grandson, the f.ithu of sir Herbert Chaileville, in fivoui ot tins more distant relative, who, fcaiful, we must suppose, he should not lulfilthi will ol the diceascd, if he did not endt iv oui to prevent the estate fiom ctnteiing in the Chaileville family, which it w ıs to ilo in case he left no male hen, he ω in nd his housekeepei, but not till she was ш a likely way to increase his Iamily 1ιι„ pre¬ caution proveel abortive, as she died m childbirth, and her infant w ıs inclosed m the same coffin, and thinking he was vi¬ sitei! for the sins of lus uncle, he never made anothei choice, but diagged on a miserable, melancholy life, suffering both VOL I.

CHAPTER X
The ensuing week the baronet regaled all his tenants at the Abbey We shall not detail what passed upon the occa¬ sion suffice it to say, they all retired perfectly satisfied with ll -чг new landlord and Ins worthy steward, and each resolv¬ ing to do sir Herbert ampli justice, as they wished to deserve a continuance of his regard The peasantry had also a dinner al fresco and a dance, and last, though not least in love, our hero and his companions were invited, and treated as suited their age and situations in life Henry was on this occasion presented with a key that would admit lum into the home grounds,
and had leave given lum to bring any of his friends with lum Lady Charleville by degrees threw off her reserve, though Dr Margram thought she vvas moie actuated by a wish to oblige sir Herbert in her behaviour towards his ward, than by any real regard for the boy» and Mrs Margiam thought it natural she should be iather jealous of their pupi), since she could uot help fancying he was nearer related to sir Herbert than he chose to acknowledge This the doctor would not admit, though he agreed there was a mystery he could not fathom, but as it did not con¬ cern them, they never hazarded these con- jictures but when Ше u-tête , and by mu¬ tual consent they eveiy day displayed more kindness towaids their promising pupil Our village party had neither been idle with their tongues nor their conjectures during the rejoicings or feasts at the Ab T bey Some envied the tenants, and re¬ gretted that sir Herbert was not their landlord, while those who lived in houses
of their own affected to rejoice that they were independent of the great man, who seemed very anxious to render lnmstlt popular among the lower classes, w hile aH these httle or would-be gentry were very mueh mortiftid at not having been in eluded in the festivities Dr Mar^r im replied to all those who applied to him, that sir Herbert's weak he:! f h rendered retirement and quiet ab¬ solutely 4ecessary to his comfort, he had therefoie detennmed neither to receive or pay visits These excuses did not absolutely pass current among his hearers, as they attri¬ buted the baronet s reserve to pride, but each hoped that they should be exceptions from the general rule They were there¬ fore all anxious to see and be seen by the new-comers, therefore looked foi ward with great impatience to the ensuing Sunday, the morning ot which was ushered m by the nnging of bells " And such people would not have stretched the bell ropes," said Mr Hoskms, " if they had not either received orders
from the stev ard, or had hoped to be well paid ' Mrs Hoskins protested she did not fare tliree pins about these fine folks, she would not cross her threshold to see them, nor go α step out of the way to oblige them, nevertheless, she bravely resolv id to out Herod all their finerj, therefore dressed in a new silk, displaj ed all her finest laces, not omitting three fine shew y ι ings, which she had reserved when they left off business Never had the church of Channg been more crowded, when, mortifying to relate, the great lady made her enti ее in plain white muslin, possibly the materials of her dress might bc of а supenor quality, and possibly it was more elegantly fashionable than those of her much finer neighbours a large straw bon net, over which was thrown a Brussels lace veil, prevented those who came to gaze from having a perfei t v iew of her features, which was no small disappoint¬ ment to the congregation, who unani¬ mously agreed that sir Herbert looked very ill and veiy old
As they were the only people who cune in а с linage, the village gently madt a halt in the ihmchj aid aftei they had driven away, to communicate then sentiments to each othei Miss Graham maintainid lady Cimile ville was very h mdsome Mis Hoskins thought hei α poor mean looking body, much too stiff and foi mal while Mrs Medhcott declared she had never seen я more perfeitly elegant woman the lieu¬ tenant s lady, Mrs Trogmore vvavered m her opinion, observing that sir Herbert was by no means α pohte man, since he ought to have distinguished and noticed her husband, and if he did not invite them to the Abbey, she should think hnn vastly ungenteel Mrs Hoskms saw no reason vhy she should expect to associate vv ith these gran dees, hinting that Mr Hoskins could vie m expence with halfa dozen lieutenants upon half pay, throwing out othei imien does less to the credit of this louple, whom ícpoi t belied if they weie not ia ilici too p u tul lo th bottle
The officers lady retorted, and some unpleasant truisms were uttered on both sides Miss Graham prevented a downright quanti and the party separated to praise or entiche the great folks as their opinion or capuce dictated The poorer classes were mudi more unanimous in their opinion as they de clared sir Herbert ias one of the best as well as most nanta^le of men and as Ins unboiindca libeiality must in time lower the poor rates Hoskins agreed that though be verified the old proveib of A fool and his money are soon pat ted hi might eventually be of serv ce to the village and if Andrews played his game v ell he must leather bis nest undei the foolish fellow As to mother Nelson she was s ire to fall upon hei feet one or other of her men was always at woik at the Abbey and she was besides deputed to distribute lady Charleville s bounty to sick and lying m women yes she would make a snug thing of it as he dared say she knew that chanty began at home F3
Thus did this envious soul vent his spleen, and most ably was he seconded by his better half Tlie Medhcotts, as friends of the rector, declared themselves warm admirers of the benevolence which their confined means did not allow them to practise The lieutenant rather sided with the Hoskmses, but Miss Graham became a decided convert to the Medhcotts opinion in consequence of the following (to her gratifying) occurrence She was very exact in returning Mrs Margram s visits, and be ing a morning call in that lady s debt, she took the earliest opportunity to make her appearance at Elm Grove Mrs Margram received her with her usual urbanity, and was politely listening to some of her vil¬ lage tales, when lady Charleville was an¬ nounced and m the room before Miss Graham eould decide whether to stay or go vvhen recollecting what a fund of con versation she might obtain, she rose, ex¬ pecting, with some tremor, to be introduced to this great lady, who kindly reproaching Mis Margram for having suffered three
days to elapse without bavmg visited the Abbey, added—" The fineness of the morning tempted me to make my personal inquiries after your health ' Mrs Margram made a very suitable re¬ ply, inquiring after the baronet, and finally mtroducing her visitors to each other Miss Graham bridled, simpered, and smirked, endeavouring to say something indicative of her internal satisfaction, while lady Charleville assured her that Mrs Maigram had mentioned her in such high terms, she was very hippy chance had stood her friend, adding—" We see no company, Miss Graham, but if you will aecompanj Mrs Margram to the Abbey whenever it suits jour and hei conveni enee, I shall feel myself the obliged per¬ son Had our spinster heard aright ? She was half dubious, so much was she elated by this very unexpected invitation What a triumph ' how she should be env ted by her less fortunate neighbours ' The bare idea rendered her eloquent, and she de plored the cause of lady Charleville s se-
elusion with at least the appearance of feeling "The baronet had rode out, and was upon the whole improved in health since his arnval in Hampshire," said hei lady¬ ship, who next inquired for our hero, for w hom her servant had brought a book su Herbert had sent lum " The doctoi has not yet dismissed his pupils, but I will summon Mr Pembroke, if your 1 idyship is m haste ' " By no means, my time is of no con sequence, while every moment that he devotes to stuely is of importance to my xtard ' Miss Graham eageily seized the oppor¬ tunity to launch out ui f ıvour of oui he ro, vvhen the sound of a bell induced Mrs Margram to bıe ík in upon her encomiums, by saying, " that is the signal foi the doc¬ tor s groom to prepare Ins horse, so I will summon Mr Pembroke," who made his appeaiance at the moment Miss Graham was taking her liave, who contrived, in an audible whisper to Mrs Margram, to pay hım a very high-flown compliment, which
cei tainly made our hero smile, if it did not increase his vanity since I e had learnt from Mrs Nelson that fie speaker was one of those good sent of ttontcn whose curiosity and propensitv to gossip render¬ ed her all in ill to cve'y body H tving paid lus respects to lady Char- lev llie, he next inquired after sir Herbert, and ixpressed his gıatıtude for his kind remembrance he had long been wishing tor tins veiy boo> md his guardian was so kind he anticipateli all his wants I am happy vou arc so truly sensible of sir Heibeits attention, rejoined her ladyship so what say you to escorting me home > You m iy return by your din¬ ner hour, lb I know this is not an after¬ noon you art illowed to devote to plea¬ sure Henry w as much gratified by the invi¬ tation, and having ran for his hat, he left 1 lm Grove with her ladyship, and as then conveisation was probably more im¬ proving to our hero than it would be amusing to our readers, we shall suffer them to pursue their way while we return
to Miss Graham, who, at the risk of spoil ing her dinner, did not return home till she had imptrted her good fortune to her neighbours their being engaged m eating she considered of no importance, since she actually forced her way past Mrs Hos¬ kms s maid, to gratify this agreeable cou pie with her interesting intelligence, ts She could not have home they sliould have heard of her triumph second hand, nor would it have been half so complete if she had not witnessed their mortui cation Out of breath with the speed she had made, she htstily rekited wh it h id otcu red at the rector s, running on m praise of lidy Chaileville s elegance of manntrs of expression, and of dress till she completely sickened her hearers, who tssund her they did not envy her good fortune they did not wish to assonate with suih high and mighty folks, and to be suffeied in stead of courted α baronet was piily α man, and this was a snkly meagre looking invalid, who seemed eat up with the by p, and they did not wish to conti lbute to his

dead, to make the villain swing. This sa¬ gacious cur went with me, trotting on be¬ fore, and I knew he would have given me warning, haă any one been loitering about. Having reached the haycock, I felt about, and found you were still tliere. My heart died within me, but upon a far¬ ther examination, î found you were still warm, and your pulse fluttered under my fingers. This so cheered my spirits, that being accustomed to carry large packages at my back, and fortunately being pre¬ pared with my straps, I fastened them round you, and with your head leaning upon my shoulder, I reached the tent just as day dawned, and have never suffered any one but myself to enter it since. I have been both your doctor and nurse, and to the best of my abilities, I have done my duty, independent of every hope of reward, since yon took my fancy from the first, as I thought I had never seen so fine a looking lad before. Yonr money I spent, as 1 have already told you, and must acknowledge I have been more than once tempted to claim tbe large reward

the baronet , " the innocent shall not suf¬ fer for the guilty, sooner or later the wretch will meet with his deserts we vvll give him an opportunity of abandon¬ ing his vicious courses " Mrs Nelson was afraid he was too old to mend She had also seen and remark¬ ed the couple and their dog —" The wo man, who has a good deal to saj' for her¬ self, wanted to tell my girls' fortunes They were not so silly as to encourage her, but I gave her a tnfle to get nd of her, as such wretches can be very spiteful, but there seems more good than evil m her composition ' " I wonder whethei she has left this neighbourhood." said Mrs Andrews " We will soon know,' replied the ba ronet, nnging the bell, and as oui hero was able to point out wheie the tents were pitched, a groom vias immediately dispatched on hoiscbatk to the place, to whom sir Heibert gave tin pounds foi the woman, with stnet oideis to ask hei no questions, and to make haste vol I II
The man returned within the hour, he had easily found the spot descnbcd, but the tents wei e gone, a few cold ashes and a few rags being all thev had left behind The money w as therefore given to Mrs Nelson to disti lbute among the pool, not foigettmg her own men and their fami¬ lies Mr Marsden was punctual to his ap¬ pointment, and as he advised his patients retinng, the party broke up, and never had Henry been more sensible of the lux¬ ury of a good bed than while taking pos¬ session of the one prepared for Inm at the Abbey, w here it was settled he should re¬ mam till he was allowed to leave off his bandages, as his head was hardly equal to the resuming his studies
CHAPTER XIII Our heros return afforded all dialing α subjett for conversation The poor had substantial reasons for rejoicing and the rich« classes, who w lshid to obtain a foot ing at the Abbey, were not baikwai d m testifying their satisfaction Mrs Hos kms alone elcilarcd there was too muih fuss, by one half, made about the impudent urchin, w ho, she made no doubt, had pro voked the gipsey-fellow to strike him Mibs Giaham filed—·' Did she mean to defend α murderei ^ ' " A mutilerei ' why, is not the boj aliv e and well' fis istrángé tale, make the best of it Ι α n t so easily duped as these great folks, I would hayepuisued the gip sies, but little mastei was afiaid his stoiy might have been contradicttd, so he pei- suaded that silly old baronet to let them escape n 2

sır Herbert and his lady, having actually drank tea and supped at the Abbey during our hero s convalescence, and was requested, when she departed with Dr and Mrs Margram, to repeat her visits »Mis Hoskms soon learnt every parti cular of the treat, as Miss Graham did not spare her the slightest mmutia, declaring that every thing was upon an almost legal scale, and that she never ate such fruit, 01 drank such wine before Mrs Hoskins thanked God that she could content Iierselt with such fruit and wme as her own gar¬ den and cellar produced , she was too in¬ dependent to flatter and cringe to the great, else she might have shoved her nose m at the Abbey, like «ome other folks, but she always had, and always should, speak her mind Satisfied with having excited hei envy, Miss Giaham suffered hei to vent liei spleen, not appearing to understand her when she was gross, noi attempting to contradict her when she was positive, no quarrel, theiefore, ensued but Mrs Hos¬ kuld s mortification was still doomed to in-
crease, since Mr Medhcott chanced to meet the baronet one morning at his steward's, and he offered his congratulations upon the restoration of our hero with such propn- etj, and bestowed such just and appro- priate praise upon the Abbey grounds, and the structure itself, that the gratified sir Herbei t told hım he was at liberty to walk in tin former, and over the latter when¬ ever it suited his convenience, adding— " Any friends of Dr Margram require no farther introduction, either to my notice or regard ' Medhcott made a very judicious and polite reply, and returned home a much greater man, in his own opinion, than he had left it Of course, he did not conceal what had so greatly increased his self-con¬ sequence, therefore the Hoskmses fancied themselves exceedingly ill used, though most of the slights they met with ongi nateti entirely in cheir overbearing inso İmce, which they denominated proper spi nt, equally mistaking their sordid avarice for superior management They were be¬ sides so very uncharitable towards both poor
and rich, that though they were still gene¬ rally vierteil, they were as generally des¬ pised, while the poorer classes held them in abhorrence But to return to the hero of our tale At the expiration of a month, he returned to Elm Grove, having perfectly recovered from the effects of the gipsey's wrath, though, as Mr Marsden had foretold, he continued to bear the mark of the wretch's prowess —Little of moment occurred du¬ ring the ensuing twelvemonth Henry was pronounced to be as good a scholar as his friend Selby, who was by this time nearly as welcome a guest at the Abbey as Pembroke, and as they were seldom asunder, they generally called there once, and frequently twice in the day, to inquire after the health of sir Herbert and his lady, and to take a stroll in the grounds During this spi mg, Henry began to learn hto manual exercise he had also а fènung-master from Southampton, and vv is practising arihery with his fricnel, xm- dir the baronet s inspection, who had pre¬ sented them with bows and arrows, and
had a proper butt erected m the park, where they once or twice а -week displayed their skill The gipsies had quite forsaken that part of Hampshire, as no one had ever seen either the man, woman, or dog, since they had taken their departure, still sir Her¬ bert never could divest himself of some degree of apprehension respecting the sa¬ vage ruffian Lady Charleville also gave Henry fiequent cautions to be upon his guard, which Dr Margram strongly en¬ forced, having strictly forbidden any of his pupils to venture out after dark. Hen¬ ry often told Selby, only that he did not ilioose to disoblige his guardian, else he should set the doctor s orders at defi¬ ance, since surely they two were now а match even for the razor-grinder, as our hero had provided himself with an excellent ash plant, too tough to be easily broken, and which he had tapered to such a point, that he declared it would do almost as much execution as a sword, but this was α secret known only to belby, since a long ferule, which he had made at Southamp-
ton, and which he could take off in л moment, concealed what he termed his lance Selby frequently cautioned him against using this really-dangerous weapon wantonly, and he assured him tlmt he ne¬ ver intended to display it except ш self- defence, he might agam meet a surly iur, and he would trust to his lance, even should he stumble upon his former enemy He was besides so good tempered, and so very well disposed, that he was a geueral favourite, and the pride of his worthy mas¬ ter, who declared he would prove a most excellent soldier, as he united bravery, hu¬ manitv, and every necessary talent to ac¬ quire military renown No one was more frequently engaged in what might be deem¬ ed sportive mischief, but he never wilfully injured any one, and if he did so uninten¬ tionally, he was sure to make them ample amends Returning one fine summei morning from the Abbey, with ma Fides Achates Sel¬ by, they saw, as they were crossing the last field, a chubby, heavy-lookmg boy, h8
rather their junior, fastening a dog to a sort of cart he had filled with stones — " What is that young fellow going to do with my favourite Sancho?" exclaimed Henry, knowing the dog belonged to Mrs Nelson, and was so good-tompered, that he suffered all the children in the village to do what they pleased with him " I wonder the animal does not bite some of his tormentors, resumed Selby , " but I never recollect seeing that fat pursy lad before " While he was speaking, the boy having arranged the harness to his mind, desired Sancho to follow him, but this bemg a kind of sport the dog had not been accustomed to, nor did not seem to like, he lay down, wagging his tail, and appearing to implore mercy The boy, who was a savage even in his sports, began to flog him with a whip he held in his hand " Let that dog alone, you sir," cried our now-enraged hero, " except you wish to have your whip laid across your own shoulders " " Mind your own business,' was the
impudent retort, laying on upon the now- howhng animal with redoubled fury Rushing upon him, Henry soon disarm ed hım, and, as he had threatened, gave hnn two or three hearty strokes while Selby cut the harness, and liberated the overjoyed Sancho, who capered round them both, though his traces rather im peeled his jumping " Come, my poor fellow, said our hero, ' we will see you safe home, and tell your mistress how ill you have been used, un known to hei, I am sure ' His late tormentor now made the air resound with his screams, calhng them cowards, blackguards, and vowing he would complain ol them to the doctor They made him no replj, but proceeded to Mrs Nelsons with their delighted companion, who seemed very anxious to get nd of his harness '1 he good woman was m her yard, and greeted them with a laugh, saying—" I am afraid, gentlemen, Sancho does not go very well in harness Our hero explained how and where they
had found him, repeating all that had pass¬ ed, inquiring if she knew who the boy was? " The nephew of Mr Hoskins, who is come to spend the Midsummer holidays at Charing Do not you remember him, Mr Selby ? He has been at school for the last eighteen months but I think you must have seen him before " Not to my recollection, but I have heard him mentioned as one of the most cruel mischievous boys tliat ever existed " You have heard his true character He spent a few months here when they first came to their villa, as tiey call their house but he was so audacious, and they had so often to pay for his cruel fun, that they sent him to school at Winchester I believe, however, he does not seem to be much mended He once killed a whole brood of chickens, because the hen made a peck at him for coming among them, and kicking them about but I should never have done, if I was to repeat all bis wicked pranks He had always Ins poc¬ kets crammed with stones, and whpn he
thought himself unperceived, he did not care what he killed or maimed Many of the neighbouring farmers have often de¬ clared, that a gang of gipsies were more harmless neighbours They did sometimes meet with redress, if they complained, but not unfrequently had their wrødøws broken the next day, and they could not always bruig his pranks home to him Да fe r the poorer children, he used to beat and bruise tliem continually, under spine false pretence or other, it was a mercy he never lamed any of them but be was a child then, m comparison to what he is now, therefore I think he will cometo the gallows, if he is suffered to go pn m his wickedness " " Do his uncle and aunt never correct him ? ' asked Selby " They pretend to do eo when they cannot excuse lum, his aunt screens him very oftep, contenting herself with calling lum a naughty boy Now and then, when he has had to pay damages, his uncle has given lum a sound horsewhip¬ ping, but Ue »s up sullen and »> pteu-
nate, that he generally contrives to re¬ venge himself upon those who occasion his punishment, and very often he has escaped, from not having been seen doing the in¬ jury. As you are' gentlemen of conse¬ quence, his precious uncle and aunt may overlook your having so properly chastised their audacious nephew, else I have heard them threaten vengeance against any one who should dare to take the law into their own hands : but if they should get upon their high ropes, I am very ready to come forward to state facts ; and I shall not let master Thomas's cruelty to Sancho pass unnoticed." " They must act as they please,"resumed our hero. " I was certainly wrong in striking the savage ; but I did it in the cause of humanity— Sancho could not speak : should they take ihe before a ma¬ gistrate, they will not meet with much en¬ couragement, since men, much less boys, are not permitted to torment animals of any description with impunity." But as it grew late, the friends took leave of the worthy woman, and hastened home,
resolving, dunng their walk, not to men¬ tion their canine k.ught errantry, as the doctor might blame them for having broken the peace, since liberating the dog was one thing, and flogging the boy another Such were the remarks of the young counsellor, whde Henry declared he would engage him to defend his cause, not supposing that Hoskins would be so absurd as to blame bim for having taught the young savage not to give way to h s cruel pro penalties
CHAPTER XIV.
Our hero and his fellow pupils were still at table, when Dr Margr im, who had on this day (his wife and daughters bemg gone to Southampton) dmed with them, was informed that Mr Hoskins was in the parlour, and requested to see hnn immedi¬ ately upon business of tht utmost import¬ ance Henry glanced at Selby, as much
as to say, hold yourself in readiness, while the doctor desired Mr Hoskins might be shewn into his study, be told he was at dinner, and that he would join Inm as soon as he had said grace, which having done, and drank a glass of wine, he repaired to his study He had no sooner left the room than Henry, who had, with Selby, also risen from table, asked the latter m a whisper— " Whether he ought not to follow the rec¬ tor, and relate what had occurred ' ' " Certainly not, you are not supposed to know Mr Hoskins s business, let him state his grievances—we as defendants are to reply, and as we shall tell the truth, I thmk we shall shame the black gentleman and his imps ' Henry gave up to his fnend's judgment, but, no more than Selby, did not feel quite at his ease, as the doctor would be vexed, if not displeased, and their Quixotism might be productive of unpleasant urcumstances While they were thus reasoning upon causes and consequences, the doctor, who was at A loss to guess tp what to attribute
this very unexpected visit, entered lus study Mr Hoskins was pacing the room, evidently m no very dulcet humour The day was warm, and he appeared to have perspired very freely Pointing to a chair, the doctoi politely reejuesttd his guest would be seated " I had rather stand," was the retort courteous, again (his anger apparently in¬ creasing) havmg recourse to lus silk hand¬ kerchief " I am come, sir———" he paused, as if at a loss for words sufhuently ex¬ pressive of his wrath-—" I am come, sir,' he repeated, with increasing arrogance, " to ask you, who profess to be a teacher -----' " Do not forget yourself, Mr Hoskms, or I may endeavour to teath you better manners I am not to be frightened by impudent bluster, so come to the point at once, if you wish mi to answer your in¬ quiries ' There was a calm dignity about Dr Margram, which rather awed the over¬ hearing fellow, who resumed in a milder tone—" I am not come to make inquiries, sii.buttodemandjustice I merely wished
to ask what you pretend to teach those impudent boys under your care?' " A vtrv modest question, and very po¬ litely worded," coolly replied the doctor " So let me ask what any of the gentle¬ men under my care can have done, to ex cite this unauthorized ebullition of wrath ' therefore be brief, if you either wish or ex peil me to give you a patient hearing ' Haskins wished he d íred have knocked the rector down, but as that would be be¬ ginning at the w rong end, he gave a gulp, while he resumed—" I may be too hasty, doctor—I am naturally of а warm disposi¬ tion—you have more command of your temper, but that is neither here nor there Perhaps I should have done wiser to have gone at once before a magistrate, but I wish to live we'l with my neighbours, and had always ι other compromize matters than go to law " I give y ou great ciedit foi sopeacealle α disposition, but I am still in the daik respecting the nature of the offence you have reeeived ' " I will soon explain what your young
gentlemen have been guilty of, at least one of them, whom I take to be the son of that banker who so lately stopped payment, and whom you keep out of chanty, I sup pose Tliere was another looking on and whde there is either law or justice in this kingdom, no one belonging to me shall be insulted, flogged, and ill treated, as my poor nephew has been by these young ty¬ rants They may thmk, because they are under y our protection, that they are autho¬ rized to do as they please, and to take the law into their own hands, but they shall find, to their cost, that I will not suffer any relation of mme to be so grossly mal¬ treated, without seeking redress I am an independent man—I have honourably, and by my own industry, acquired a large for¬ tune, and I will expend it all m law, before my nephew shall be so abused If I chose to keep a school for impudent, hulking, overbearing boys, I might keep a carnage as и ell as other folks but this is going from the point I only wish to ask what you now have to say in defence of your gentlemen?'
Thodoctor, though never more provoked, succeeded in appearing perfectly calm, while he coolly replied—" You must condescend to enter into a more accurate detail, Mr Hoskins, since I am unable to understand what Mr Brackenbury (against whom you seem most inveterate) has done to provoke your wrath His father s misfortunes ra¬ ther entitle him to commiseration than re¬ proach " " That is fine talking, doctor, but I say neither he nor his companion deserve to meet with any lenity—two great cowardly blackguards, men grown in comparison, to set their wits against my nephew, a mere baby, and as haimless innocent a cbdd as any in the village ' " If Mr Brackenbury, 01 any of my pupils, unprovoked, struck y our nephew, I shall call them to a very severe account, so pray tell me when, when, and bow the assault onginated? ' " When, why about two hours ago— wheie, in farmer Nichols s close, and as to the how, why they knocked the child down, after first wresting his whip from hun,
which they laid about him pretty hand somely the marks of their cruelty are very visible both upon his back and arms ' Did they receive no provocation to induce them to proceed to such unvvar ίαη table lengths? None in the world doctor the boy was not doing any thing th it could either annoy or in|ure them he was merely play nig in the close w ith a little cart and α dog which he wis teaching to draw when they came up and fell upon him as I have re lated since I am sure the child who never told me а he did not say 01 do any thing to offend their high mightinesses I theie fore expect if y ou do not wish mc to take out a warrant against them tint you will oblige them to ask mine and my nephew s paidon as the least punishment their cruel ty and audacity desei ves As yon state the tase Mr Hoskins they have certainly been greatly to blame and I shall not suffer them to go unpumsh ed you have а right according to your own statement to receive their apology
Was lt your old spaniel the child had m his cart? No it was a nasty cur belonging to Mrs Nelson which I have wished hanged a thousand times there is such a noise and screaming vvhen the children of the village are at play with Inm Your dislike to the dog is irrelevant to the case m point Was any person pre sent when your nephew was so beaten? Not a soul the young rogues took care of that Mr Brackenbury you suspect to be the greatest culprit ' The looker on you do not know ? I cannot affirm it was Mr Bracken bury who committed the assault I merely suspected Inm fro n the child s description I did not see eithei of them I only wish I had they should have had reason to re member ill treating my boy 11 at would have been falling into their error and lenient as you have shewn yourself it may have been fortunate vou did not as you threatened to apply to a
magistrate, since you have made use of expressions that must have greatly injured your cause " When I am thoroughly provoked, I neither know nor care what I say " Then you may sometimes have brought yourself into difficulties Now, though your nephew never addressed these young men, he might contuve to provoke, and throw them off their guard Mr Brack enbury you accuse merely upon suspicion I think he will h ive no Jilhculty m proving an alibi as he was wilting m this room at the tune the ass uılt was committed, and is not, as y ou conjeitured, at all indebted to my chanty, since his mothers brother has taken upon himself the charge of his education So now tell me how the youths you complain of were dressed' Your ne phew must hav e been able to tell you that ' If he is to be depended upon, one was m dark green I went to mother Nelson s to leain who they were, as they took the cur home just to make misiluef As she threatens to apply to a lawyer, let her I know why she is ready to throw dirt in
the face of me and mine—I never employ her, she would not answer any of my queries ' " Probably you did not so word your inquines as to entitle you to an answer, but if she mentioned a lawyer, I must sup pose your nephew, whether he be to be depended upon or not, is not so free from blame as you make him out, at aH events, I do not wish the errors of my pupils to go unpunished Possibly the child, as you style him, may be able to identify their persons, though he has already led you into an error by his description " " He will know them again I wished him to have come w ıth me, to have pointed them out, but he was afraid, as he is na¬ turally very timid " How old is he 5 ' " Just turned of twelve but very little for his age, and he was always very sickly and weak " " What, is it the lad who came with you to Charing you have been talking about' I supposed it had been his infant brother If you call lum innocent and

stranger s complaint, the stolen rabbit, and all that had ocuirred tlie preceding morn ing she w ts therefore very happy he was gone to Southampton vvhen she saw Mr Andrews crossing the front court, having t sort of presentiment that his visit was connected with those occurrences, having tontented herself with giving f ornas α very serious lecture which she had wisely interi irded with so many expressions of dislike towaids oui hero, md of anger to¬ vi ards the insolent sti anger fcllou, that the boy lilt ıssın ed he might set one or both ot them at defiance She received liti deal fnend as she styled the steward with eveiy demonstration of joy, inquired ifter the ladies tnd had so much to say, th it it was some time before her guest could inquire foi All Hoskins He will be so sony when lie hens voti Inve been here he was from home he is gone to Southampton he was sum lnoncel there yesterd iy upon rather an un pitas ıııt business, it huh, to say the truth, his so unsettled me that I have hardly known either vv hat have I done or said since

CHAPTER XIX. " To make myself understood, I must go back a few years, though it is trespassing upon your patience, sir ; but I will cut my story as short as possible. About thirty years ago, my father was one of the first timber-merchants and greatest builders in London, and thought to be exceedingly rich : he had married a lady of good family and fortune, by whom he had one daughter, who was brought up at some great school, and considered as very accomplished. When her mother died she was in her sixteenth year, and not old enough to manage the concerns of her father, who married again to my mother within the twelvemonth. " My mother was between thirty and forty, and bad been some time a widow. She had a pretty income, which she of
course gave up to her busband, not think¬ ing of having any thing secured to her¬ self, since she supposed she had married a man rich enough to leave her in afflu¬ ence; but in less than five years he be¬ came a bankrupt, and died broken-hearted before he obtained his certificate. The creditors, taking into consideiation my mother's deplorable case, agreed to allow her a small annuity ; and as she had a re¬ lation living at Southampton, she remov¬ ed thither witli me, then in my fourth year. I had bad a brother, but be died before my father. My sister-in-law, who had been courted by men of rank and for¬ tune, now married a young officer, with whom slie immediately went abroad, and I never knew even whether she was liv¬ ing till about fifteen months ago. " But to return to myself. My mother died when I was nbout nineteen, leaving me what little property she possessed. My present husband, who was then a very good-looking man, and had a very good business as a master carpenter, had M 2
already singled me out and as soon as decency would permit, we were marncd, and might now have been living upon the fat of the land, if he would but have minded his business and kept out of bad company but he soon failed, and became journeyman to his successor, declanng he was happier than when a master, hav¬ ing less care and being sure of his money on a Saturday night But he soon quar relied with his then mastei, when, to my gieat joy, Mis Nelson, of Charing, took him into hei employ, for he is allowed to be one of the best woikmen m England She, God bless her ' did and said all she could to woi к a reform in him ЛУе had а nice cottage close to her yaid she gave us milk and vegetables, and if he or I were ill, she was both our doctor and nurse but Brickland was soon toed of doing well, he got drunk and affronted the customers, and when she remonstiatcd vi ith him in a kind friendly manner, why, he abused her, so, m self defence, she was obliged to discharge him, and vve removed hıtheı, where a carpenter and wheelwright,
irat much better than Brickland, offered him work ; and we just made shift to exist, when, about fifteen months ago, I received a letter from my sister-in-law, whom I had supposed dead long before, never having heard from her since her marriage. She wrote me, that she had long since learnt where and how I lived, and wished it had been in her power to afford me any assist¬ ance, but requested I would come to her upon receipt of this letter, as she was all anxiety to see me, being confident she was not long for this world, and she had something of the utmost importance to communicate to, ще, concluding by in¬ forming me she had long been a widow, and now resided at Kingston-upon-Thames. " I lost no time in obeying her sum¬ mons ; and had we hod the money, my husband would have accompanied me, as he foresaw, if she died, we should be her lieirs. Her direction gave us to under¬ stand that she kept a boarding-school, and no one was better qualified for such a situa¬ tion. If I had but had one quarter of her learning, I should liave been much better
off but my mother could not afford to put me to a good sthool and often said ts I was to live among the low er sort of trades folk, she did not wish to set me abovi them—But I am w anelenng from my story Bnckltnd hoped my sister w as nth this I should soon disiover he said and I w as to let Inm know as soon as possible, and we were to bc guided by circumstances ' During my journey I resolved to be very candid with my sister in-law, in hopes she might be induced to leave me some thing m my own power, independent of my husband, well aware that he would soon squander whatever fell into his hands I ara sure sir you will rot abuse my con¬ fidence for if Bnckland was ever to dis cover that I have let you into the light of things he would murder me, I do be heve The baronet gave her his word that he should consider all she told hirii as sacred, and became answerable for Henrys dis cretion She therefore thus proceeded — " I reached Kingston about nine о tlock in the evening, and found my poor sister
in the last stage of a dropsy, looking the image of death, and certainly bearing no resemblance to the handsome young wo¬ man I just recollected She was bolstered up in a laige arm-chair, being unable to lie down in a bed, but made an effort to welcome me I was quite shocked and affected by her appearance she also shed tears, and then entered into a few particu¬ lars that convinced me she was indeed my once-beautiful sister —' I wieh I had not deferred sending for you when I found my disorder increasing, but till within these few days mv medical attendants gave me hopes Just before I wrote you, they were obliged to acknowledge all vv ould soon be over ' She spoke with dif¬ ficulty, and was some time before she could recover bei breath She then made some inquiries respecting my cirium- stances, but without waiting for my an¬ swer, she proceeded to tell me, that, fear¬ ful she might die before I came, she hod mude a will, in which she had left all she possessed, even to a darling child, to my husband and me.
" She saw me start vvhen she mentioned t child, since, how could we be her heirs if she had α child ' Without giving me tme to asK an explanation she continued, fearful her strength or intellects might ful liei— 'The child I allude to is no rela¬ tion of mme still I tin in duty bound to provide for her to the best of my abili ties' " Here she burst into tears, clasped her hands and seemed either entreating a blessing, or forgiveness of her sins I was tt a loss what to say or how to comfort her, since, m fact, I was qmte m the dark however, I assured her that, to the best of my poor abilities, I would fulfil tU her wishes, if God did not see fit to raise her up " She sighed as if her hent would break, telling me, in a more inward voice, that all would soon b* ovei but if it pleased the Almighty to grant her another daj, she would enter upon a story she had not now strength to begin " At that moment Anna Tarnham came into her room with soine medicine, saj ing
—' It is ,time you took your mixture, mamma.' " My sister sewed the glass, swallowed the draught, and then, pressing the child to her bosom, gavé me such a look, I shall never forget her if I live to be a hundred. Perfectly understanding her meaning, I I also embraced the little girl, declaring she was a sweet child, and that I loved her for her mamma's sake. ' You have removed a heavy weight firom my heart,' said my poor sister, weep¬ ing afresh ; ' only be kind to my poor child. I have made a trifling provision for her in my will, and there are some papers —but I cannot enter into any details this evening*—my strength and breath are quite exhausted." She uttered these last words in so faint a voice, that if the child had not repeated thein, I should not have understood her meaning. She next whispered a wish that I would take some supper and go to bed. I wished to have sat up with her, but she would not hear of it, as I was just come . Mä
off a joitVnèy. She had a regular nurse to attend her in the night, and Anna attend¬ ed her in the day ; indeed she never liked to take any thing but from her hands; I afterwards learnt, tor she died during the night, sitting Up in her chair, and went off so quietly, her nurse at first hoped she was asleep. " Though fully prepared for her death, I wa .ery much at a loss how to act, till finding the servants and the nurse knew I was their late mistress's sister and heir, and in consequehce applied to me for di¬ rections, I ventured to give the necessary orders, but sent off immediately for my husband, who, sot as he now is, has been very well brought up, and has had very good learning, and he had told me when I left home, that 1 could not take upon mc to act without his orders. " He joined me the third day after the poor soul's decease, when I related all that had passed between us. ' Ay, ay, all gammon, I dare say,' was his answer, blaming me for having ordered such a handsome coffin, before I knew whether
she had left enough to pay the expence : beside«, being a carpenter, he thought he could have made a better bargain. " Unfortunately, I am a very poor scho¬ lar—rindeed I am hardly able to read in a printed book, and can make no hand of writing, which is all my own fivult ; but I never gave my mind to it. This pre¬ vented me from looking over the will, or the papers she mentioned. I only took tlie precaution to keep every thing locked up, and Anna pointed out where to find every thing of value or moment. " The first thing my husband did was to read the will, which he did to himself, refusing to let me hear the contents, merely saying-—' Why, what can you learn more than that ail she has left is •ours? We are to take care of the child tifi she is old enough to go into the world —a pretty encumbrance truly ! however, as jou were such a fool as to promise you would, why she shall go home with ns, and we will do the best we can ; no one is required to do more.' "Aito what money there might be in
the house or elsewhere, I really cannot say, for I hod not had the heart' to tuni' mage over her things before my husband came. As she had been ill some time, she had been obliged to give Up her school} anil there was very little money upon her books. I was most curious to learn to what papers my poor sister had alluded, as being connected with the child. Brick- land declared none of lier papers that he had looked ihto mentioned 'the gill, though there were os many letters and otfier wri¬ tings as would have filled a bushel, which he thert threw into a sort of chest hè had taken a fancy to because of its strength, telliiig me he woulil look them all over at his leisure when we returned home, as he should be very glad to discover the right owner to the girl. But, not to tire your honour, he managed every thing his own way, as no one cartie forward to dispute our claims. The lease Of tlie house, furni¬ ture, and manv more articles, Were imme¬ diately sold, and I am sui e they brought in a good round sum ; I never ltnew ex¬ actly what. Indeed Brickland gave out,
when vve ıetuıned here, tint he should hardly be paid foi his time when every thing Was settled, and were saddkd with α chikl to maintain But neither I nor our ntighboius were his dupes, snte he has never gone sober to bed since my poor sister s death, and sometimes he lias not woiked for a week Just now he has got a luciative job, else he would have been at the alehouse ' She paused " What belarne of ttie cheşţ and the pa¬ peis? asked the baronet ' They are all burnt, Ί homas tells me He certainly did bui η а gnat heap soon after we came home, which lie said w ere trumpery not worth Keeping ' " Cannot you ascertain whether he told jou truth, by looking mto the chest? I should like very muih to know whether he kept any in reserve ' " I only wish I had it in my power to oblige jou, an , but the day after vve came home, Thomas employed himself m stniv- mg this very chest down to the floqr of one of oui uppet rooms, he also fastened tıı о padlocks to it, for fear I should he

Should any thing transpire hereafter—your husband must have his unguarded mo¬ ments—I will amply reward you for any intelligence You aie truly to be pitied, m iking her a handsome present as he bade her adieu She called down blessings innumerable upon his head, declaring she w ould n ateh more strictly than ever, and let him know if Brickland dropped а word relating to the child " Wei!, Henry, said the baronet, as they rode homeward, " if w e have not ob¬ tained much s ıtısfactıon, we have certainly every reason to believe that there is some mystery attached to y our pi otegée, which probably Mrs Smith s papers would have elucidated I hardly thmk that drunken brute has made away with them, y et were vve tc attempt to force him to produce them, he would instantly destroy them Were it to his interest, I dare say he w ould be as communicative as wc could w ıslı but as, most probably, he has grossly vi ranged the poor child, he will keep his ow n counsel, so we must have pahenee

Should she lay hold of these mystic keys, I feel as¬ sured she will sene all the papers, at the risk of being knocked on the head ' " Should she be so doniig, I sliall advise her not returning home again, smet I will ι undertake to prov ide for her, and to Send her out of Blicklands reaih * " Drunken as he is, 1 thmk he has dis¬ played wonderful cunning, first in getting hold of all the property of the deceased, and next in so safely securing the chest, which must, hke Falkland s famous ' Iron Chest,' toutain some damning proof of his v lllany, else he w ould nevu have bestowed the pams or expence of screws and pad¬ locks, to prevent his vv lie from examunng the contents, resumed Henry When they reached the Abbey, lady ClnileviUe was madt acquainted with the result of their visit She pronounced Bnikland a compiile rogue, but felt
